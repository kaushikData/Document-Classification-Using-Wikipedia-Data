Teams taking part in the final rounds are known to have included Otangarei United, Blockhouse Bay, North Shore United, Papatoetoe, Hamilton Technical Old Boys, Kahukura (Rotorua), Eastern Union (Gisborne), Moturoa, Hastings United, Wanganui United, St. Andrews (Manawatu), Wellington Marist, Nelson Rangers, Christchurch Nomads, Timaru Thistle, Northern (Dunedin), and Invercargill Thistle. It is known that unfancied side Otematata, from Otago's Maniototo district caused a surprise by reaching the last 16 stage.\nDuring the early 1960s North Shore were by far the strongest team in the country. This was their fourth final in five years, and with the Chatham Cup they completed a treble which included the Auckland regional league and the Rothmans Cup competition. They easily accounted for the Christchurch team of Nomads in the final, and with the exception of the tail-end of the first half dominated the match. The only goal of the first period came through Shore's Middleton (some sources say winger Peter Oden), but the lead was doubled ten minutes after the break through a header from Peter Maynard. McNicholl (some sources say Oden) added a third and North Shore coasted for the remainder of the match, allowing Nomads' Robin Muirson to gain a consolation goal for the southerners.\n\n\"Note: Some sources, such as Hilton (1991), give North Shore's goalscorers as Oden 2, Maynard.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "5804911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5804911", "title": "Barton Hall", "text": "Barton Hall\n\nBarton Hall is an on-campus field house on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. It is the site of the school's indoor track facilities, ROTC offices and classes, and Cornell Police. It also served as the location of the former band room, once used by the Cornell Big Red Marching Band and the Cornell Big Red Pep Band. However, the summer of 2013 saw the completion of a new building for the Big Red Bands adjacent to Schoellkopf Field. For a long time, Barton Hall was the largest unpillared room in existence. The interior of the building covers almost , and includes a 1/8 mile (200m) indoor track.\n\nThe New York State Drill Hall was designed by the official State Architect of New York, Lewis Pilcher. It was built to provide military instruction to Cornell students, as required by Cornell's status as a land-grant institution. Its drill shed originally contained 362 x 228 feet of open floor space, large enough to accommodate 1,000 men. The building is made of local limestone with double trusses spaced 40 feet apart to support the roof. The Architectural Record called the \"splendid drill hall\" a \"notably modern achievement in American architecture.\"\n\nIt was built in 1914 and 1915 and was originally designed as a drill hall for the Department of Military Science. Upon its completion it was often referred to as the \"New Armory\". In January 1940 it was named for Col. Frank A. Barton, Class of 1891. Colonel Barton was one of the first two Cornell students to receive an army commission in Cornell's Military Science Program, and was the first ROTC commandant at Cornell from 1904 to 1908. During World War I, Barton Hall functioned as an airplane hangar and it served the ROTC as an armory during World War II.\n\nBarton Hall was well-known to all Cornellians. In the days prior to online course registration, each student would come to Barton Hall at the start of the semester to register for classes. This process would involve placing punched cards into bins for each class positioned on tables throughout the hall. Student organizations would also recruit members at these events. In the first part of the 20th century, \"drill\" was mandatory for all male students, and it would be conducted in Barton Hall. Also, until 1974, graduation was conducted in Barton Hall, until it was moved outdoors to Schoellkopf Field. For many years, it also hosted graduation ceremonies for Ithaca High School.\n\nBarton Hall was home to Cornell Basketball between 1919 and 1990 when the new field house, later named Bartels Hall, was completed. In 1995, Barton received another major change with the construction of the H. Hunt Bradley Track Center under the south bleachers. The center includes a Hall of Fame/meeting room/study facility for track, an office, a library and a weight room.\n\nIn the Spring of 1969 members of the Afro-American Society (AAS) occupied Willard Straight Hall, the Cornell Student Union, in protest against judicial sanctions against several black students and to demand a black studies program. Two days after the students left Willard Straight Hall, a Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) meeting became a \"student takeover of Barton Hall\" and the Barton Hall Community was formed.\n\nOn May 11, 1972, Barton Hall was again the site of anti-war protests, and one protestor threw a rock through a window. The rock thrower was mistakenly identified as physics major James R. Bean, who was later suspended and placed on trial for first degree riot, a class E felony. Bean was acquitted after a four-day trial. Before the end of the trial, the District Attorney subpoenaed the defense witnesses to appear before the grand jury to further investigate the protest. The Bean trial was a high point in political tensions between the town and the campus and marked an end to efforts to prosecute anti-war protestors off-campus.\n\nFor many years, Barton Hall had a non-operational deck gun used in Navy ROTC Training which was fenced off from the general public. On May 1, 1969, as a protest against the Vietnam War, members of the Students for a Democratic Society broke into the fenced area and painted anti-war slogans on the gun . In a departure from the practice of handling student disciplinary issues with the campus judicial system, eight of the protesters were prosecuted in the city courts for trespassing, but charges against them were dropped. In September 1969, the week-long trial attracted great publicity because the defense called as witnesses a large number of administrators, trustees, President Dale Corson, and former President James A. Perkins to testify.\n\nBarton Hall also serves as a concert venue for the Cornell Campus, with concerts produced by the Cornell Concert Commission. It has hosted acts such as The Grateful Dead, Ludacris, Bob Dylan, and The Flaming Lips.\n\nThe Grateful Dead's concert at Barton Hall on May 8, 1977 is widely considered to be the greatest of their career. In 2011, a recording of the concert was one of 25 recordings selected that year for preservation in the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress. The concert is available in full on the band's 2017 live album \"Cornell 5/8/77\".\n\nIn 2009–2011, Barton Hall underwent a $8 million renovation, including structural repairs, work on the gutters and masonry, and replacement of the roof and windows.\n\nBarton Hall now contains a 200 m track, basketball courts, the Hart Memorial Library, and the Wortham Museum. After the opening of Newman Arena, the building was remodeled into a premier indoor track facility. The Recaflex track features eight 42-inch lanes, one of the few indoor 200-meter tracks in the country with eight such lanes. Barton also contains a throwing cage with a cement circle and crusher dust landing sector surrounded by a high chain link fence. The interior of the track has a Recaflex runway for the pole vault, two long and triple jump pits and multiple high jump areas. The track itself has a raised aluminum curb and a common finish line.\n\nBarton Hall is also home to the three ROTC Detachments on campus: Army, Navy, and Air Force. Each branch has a dedicated corner of the building where classes are held in their respective fields. Lead labs and drill labs also occur in Barton Hall whether on the track floor or within the detachment buildings themselves.\n\nBarton Hall also contains an indoor challenge course, that has similar elements to those found outside at the Hoffman Challenge Course owned and operated by Cornell Team & Leadership Center. The Barton Hall Challenge Course has several unique, exciting elements.\n"}

However, the train was stopped a little late, so the townspeople pushed the train depot over to cheer for their honored guest. \nA hen with a blue bonnet is swooned with Dizzy Dan, but her boyfriend Claude, carrying a gnarled bat for the match, grumbles at his girlfriend's idolizing.\nDizzy Dan plays the song Boulevardier from the Bronx to brag his likeness, with some clucking sounds.\n\nLater, at the baseball match, Dizzy Dan is pitching. He lets the rest of his team back off as he prepares to pitch against a pig batter with a Babe Ruth Caricature. The first pitch was a strike (the ball sent the turtle catcher flying from the reaction), and Dizzy Dan cackles at the batter. Dan pitches again and Strike Two. At the third pitch, Dan struck the batter out, while the ingenious catcher uses a metal chimney pipe to return the ball back to the pitcher, with Dan cackling again.\n\nAt the next inning, Claude is pitching against a dachshund batter. He pitches, but nearly beans the batter for Ball One. Claude tries again, but the dachshund connects the hit. Claude tries to catch the ball, but many baseballs fell to the ground and ultimately dropped the chance for an out. The dachshund manages to stretch from base to base and has made a single run to the home base, leaving Claude scratching his head.\n\nLater, Dizzy Dan is at bat while Claude is pitching. Dan arrogantly lets himself have two strikes and then he hits the ball, sending Claude to the back of the stadium wall, dropping the ball from the hard impact. The hen tries to tell Dan to run, but he is biding his time before he manages to complete a single run, along with a familiar cackle.\n\nIt's the last half of the inning and the Hickville team has 3 men on base and 2 outs (the score was 3–0, Giants). Dizzy Dan is pitching against Claude, who is getting really tensed in anger against the pitcher. Dan winds up and throws a fastball; Strike One. Dan then throws a slowball that is true to its name. Claude tries to swing it, but it curves for another strike; Dan cackles again. Then Dan pitches a hard fastball; that was when Claude makes a clean hit for a Grand Slam Home Run, conclusively winning the game.\n\nAnd Claude gives Dizzy Dan the last cackle.\n\n\"That's all, folks!\"\n\n\n"}

It lies just east of the A286 road north of Chichester. It is in the civil parish of Lavant. East Lavant has a collection of historic cottages and a public house. The manor appears in Domesday as Loventone.\n\nSt Mary’s Church was founded in the 12th century. The North aisle was added in the 13th century - one of the columns separating the nave from the north aisle remains, the others are 19th-century. The lancet window is also original. The 15th century appears to have brought the five stalls with their misericords.\n\nThe south tower was constructed in 1671 and the south west window nave window was inserted at the same date. Most of the north aisle, the arcade between the nave and the north aisle, much of the nave and chancel seems to have been rebuilt in 1863.\n\nIn 1628, an ecclesiastical case is preserved that relates to a game of cricket being played at East Lavant on a Sunday. Two defendants, Edward Taylor and William Greentree, were charged with playing cricket at the time of evening service. Taylor argued that he had not played during evening prayer time but only before and after. It did him no good as he was fined the statutory 12d and ordered to do penance. Doing penance involved confessing his guilt to the whole East Lavant congregation the following Sunday.\n\nThis restaurant is called \"The Royal Oak\". It is believed to be haunted by a lady in white who appears in a front upper floor bedroom. In the 1940s it drew national attention due to the famous \"Drinking Pig\". A local farmer used to give one of his pigs, the runt of the litter, a drink of beer to build it up. A national paper heard the story and sent a reporter. Unfortunately the beer had worked and the pig had been slaughtered. The resourceful farmer merely found another pig and this appeared in the newspaper article. Thus a fine picture of the pig and the farmer appeared in the paper, with the landlord, James Pafford and his family standing proudly behind the bar.\n"}
{"id": "3221574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3221574", "title": "English Football Hall of Fame", "text": "English Football Hall of Fame\n\nThe English Football Hall of Fame is housed at the National Football Museum, in Manchester, England. The Hall aims to celebrate and highlight the achievements of the all-time top English footballing talents, as well as non-English players and managers who have become significant figures in the history of the English game. New members are added each year, with an induction ceremony held in the autumn, formerly at varying locations, but exclusively at the Museum itself following its move to Manchester's Urbis building in 2012.\n\nThe Hall is on permanent display at the Museum. An accompanying book, \"The Football Hall of Fame: The Official Guide to the Greatest Footballing Legends of All Time\", was first published in October 2005 by Robson Books. Authored by football historian Rob Galvin and the Museum's founding curator Mark Bushell, it is updated every year with the newest inductees, containing an in-depth profile about the career and reputation of each one, along with a select exhibit from the Museum which relates to their achievements.\n\nMembers of the Hall of Fame are chosen by a panel. Initially, this comprised ex-players Jimmy Armfield, Sir Trevor Brooking, Jimmy Hill, Mark Lawrenson and Gordon Taylor, all of whom had become professional pundits and/or senior figures in football after retiring.\n\nIn subsequent years, former England national team manager Graham Taylor and former England international Steve Hodge have also served stints on the panel, though it is now chiefly a grouping of eminent football historians. The current panel features Neil Carter, Tony Collins, Jeffrey Hill, Peter Holme, Dick Holt, John Hughson, Simon Inglis, Alexander Jackson, Gary James, Graham Kelly, Tony Mason, Kevin Moore, Martin Polley, Dil Porter, Dave Russell, Matthew Taylor, Jean Williams and John Williams.\n\nAll surviving inductees to the Hall are granted an additional place on the panel. Two players have been inducted as the 'Fans' Choice', following polls on the BBC Sport and Sky Sports websites.\n\nInitially, there were three main categories of induction; a mass of 'Players' and 'Managers' from the men's game, together with one figure from the women's game (Sir Alf Ramsey is noted as the only figure to date honoured in both of the main male categories). To be considered for induction, players must be either retired or at least 30 years of age. All inductees must also have played/managed for at least five years in England.\n\nIn 2007, two other regular categories were established. Chiefly, this was in recognition of football's central role in English culture, extending Hall of Fame honours to those who have contributed greatly to the English game outside the more obvious fields of play. The Community Champion category – sponsored by the Football Foundation – honours professional players who have donated their spare time and money to the grassroots level of the sport, while the Football for All Award – sponsored by The Football Association – is presented to pioneers of the various forms of football played by disabled people.\n\nSince 2009, the Museum has also commemorated great teams from history alongside its awarding of individual players and coaches. The criteria for a team's induction is that they must have played at least a quarter of a century prior. 2013 saw the first induction of a referee, while 2017 saw the first induction of a figure from the football media.\n\nOn occasional circumstances there will also be a presentation of a 'special award', usually to mark significant anniversaries. Jimmy Hill is to date the sole recipient of an honour styled as a Lifetime Achievement Award, in celebration of his unusual polymathic career in the game.\n\nIn 2004, Sepp Blatter, then president of FIFA, was inducted to mark the world federation's centenary. He became the first figure outside the English game to be honoured by the Museum.\n\nIn 2007, the Football Foundation Community Champion award was created, with its inaugural holder being Niall Quinn. The following winners were Peter Beardsley (2008), Robbie Earle (2009) and Graham Taylor (2010). The award has been inactive since then.\n\nAlso in 2007, the Football for All Award was created, with its inaugural holder being Stephen Daley, a Northern Irish-born English footballer whose professional career was ended by loss of vision at 18, and later became the captain of the partially sighted England national team. In 2008, Steve Johnson, a regular member of the England squad for amputee football and the leader of Everton's charity venture, Everton in the Community, won the award. In 2009, Ronnie Watson, a footballer who has learning disabilities, won the award. He had been training with Oldham Athletic, in preparation for the 2008 European Learning Disability Championship, where he would captain the England LD side. In 2010, George Ferguson won the award. Ferguson is a long-time member of Everton's blind football team and secretary of the Visually Impaired Football League. 2013 saw David Clarke, captain of Great Britain blind football team, win the award. From 2014 to 2017, members of the England cerebral palsy team were honoured, with Matt Dimbylow, Gary Davies, Martin Sinclair and Alistair Patrick-Heselton winning.\n\nThe presentation of a special award would happen sporadically over the years. In 2007, Sheffield, the world's oldest football club was commemorated for reaching its 150th anniversary. In 2008, Michel Platini, then president of UEFA, became the second figure outside the English game to be honoured by the Museum in an one-off European Hall of Fame ceremony. Two years later, Jimmy Hill was honoured with a special lifetime achievement award. In 2013, the special award was used three times. Firstly, to Civil Service, the only surviving club of those represented at the official formation of the Football Association in 1863. Secondly, to Ebenezer Cobb Morley, the first secretary of the Football Association and often considered to be its founding father, inducted to mark the governing body's 150th anniversary. Thirdly, to William McGregor, the founder of the Football League was inducted to commemorate the organisation's 125th anniversary. In 2014, the Football Battalion, a group of professional footballers and fans who fought in the Battle of the Somme, were honoured. In 2015, Sun Jihai, the first Chinese player in the English game, was made \"Anglo-Chinese Football Ambassador\". His surprise induction was announced as part of the state visit to the United Kingdom by Chinese President Xi Jinping. The decision caused controversy on social media with Labour's shadow minister for sport Clive Efford suggesting that the award had been bought by the office of Prime Minister David Cameron. A spokesman for the museum explained that Sun had been recognised for his \"ambassadorial role in enhancing the profile and popularity of English football to a Chinese audience\". In 2016, two clubs were honoured: Cambridge University, for their unofficial claim to be the world's oldest club; some documents in their archive suggest a foundation year of 1856, the year before Sheffield began, and Notts County for their status as the world's oldest club currently playing at a professional level; founded in 1862.\n\nTeam awards were introduced in 2008, as part of a one-off European Hall of Fame ceremony. Manchester United and Liverpool's European Cup winning sides of 1968 and 1978 were the first teams inducted. In 2009, Manchester United's Busby Babes squad of the 1950s and Manchester City's cup-winning squad of the late 1960s and early 1970s were inducted.

Players perform it by using the outside of their dominant foot to push the ball towards their dominant side, then quickly move the dominant foot around the ball and using the inside to push the ball to their non-dominant side. Although the footwork is the most distinctive aspect of the flip-flap, its success as a feint also relies heavily on the attacking player having an explosive acceleration from a stationary position.\n\nThe move was invented by the Japanese-Brazilian football player Sérgio Echigo. In 1964, Brazilian playmaker Rivellino learned the move from Echigo, who was his Corinthians teammate in the youth team, and performed it to a global audience during the 1970 FIFA World Cup. Interviewed on the television series \"Football's Greatest\" in 2012, Rivellino states; \"He [Echigo] says now that he invented it, but I perfected it\".\n\nRivellino was an idol to a number of Brazilians, and the trick was popularized in the late 1990s and 2000s by high-profile players such as Romário, Ronaldo and Ronaldinho among others.\n\nIn Africa, especially Nigeria, the move has been referred to as a \"Snakebite\" or \"Zigima\" because of the in-and-out feet movement of the perpetrator. However, it is now more commonly called \"The Gaúcho\" – after Ronaldinho (Gaúcho).\n\n"}

In his former career, he was a centre-forward from 1978 until 1995, most notably in an eight-year spell at Wimbledon F.C. in which he won the FA Cup in 1988 and scored over 100 goals in all competitions.\n\nHe also played for Norwich City, Miramar Rangers, Lincoln City, Crystal Palace, Millwall and Aston Villa. He scored 134 league goals in a career lasting 17 years. He was also capped twice at senior level by England, but failed to score on either occasion.\n\nFollowing his football career he went on to co-host British television show \"Gladiators\" in the 1990s, and between 2003 and 2004 he managed his own Sunday league football side \"Fash FC\" on Bravo.\n\nFashanu was born in Kensington, London, the son of Pearl Gopal, a nurse from British Guyana and Patrick Fashanu, a Nigerian barrister living in the UK. When his parents split up he was sent, together with his older brother Justin to a Barnardo's home. When he was five, he and his brother were fostered by Alf and Betty Jackson and were brought up in Shropham near Attleborough, Norfolk.\n\nFashanu's footballing career began at Norwich City in 1979, and he turned professional two years later – just as his brother Justin was transferred to Nottingham Forest from the relegated Carrow Road club.\n\nNorwich were promoted straight back to the First Division in 1981–82, but Fashanu managed just five league appearances and scored once. He managed two appearances in the 1982–83 First Division campaign – which would be his last for the club.\n\nHe had brief loan spell with Crystal Palace and also played in the English off-season in New Zealand with Miramar Rangers, with whom he played in the final of the local equivalent of the FA Cup, the Chatham Cup (he remains the only player to have played in the final of both the English and New Zealand major cup competitions). He joined Lincoln City on a free transfer on 23 September 1983, when they were in the Third Division. He scored seven goals from 26 league games that season, and managed four from 10 league games the following campaign before his £55,000 transfer to Third Division promotion challengers Millwall on 30 November 1984. It was an exciting first season at The Den for Fashanu, who scored four goals in 25 games but helped the Lions reach the FA Cup quarter-finals (where they lost at Luton Town in a game marred by fans who invaded the pitch) and secure promotion to the Second Division. He managed eight goals from 25 games in 1985–86, before leaving to join Wimbledon.\n\nFashanu made a £125,000 move to Second Division promotion contenders Wimbledon in March 1986, when they were pushing for a third promotion in four seasons as they looked to complete a rapid rise from the Fourth Division to the First. At the time, he was the club's record signing.\n\nFashanu's four goals from the remaining nine league games helped Wimbledon seal the final promotion place and they were a First Division side a mere nine years after being elected to the Football League - only the second club in Football League history to be promoted three divisions in four seasons.\n\nFashanu and his colleagues settled well into the First Division, surprising all the observers by finishing sixth in the league (briefly topping the table in early September) and finishing above traditional big clubs including Nottingham Forest and Manchester United. Fashanu was Wimbledon's top scorer with 11 league goals, and would be a regular goalscorer in the top flight for the Dons for a further seven seasons.\n\nIn 1988, Fashanu helped Wimbledon win the FA Cup, beating Liverpool in a final that was billed as a \"rags versus riches\" affair, although the two clubs were separated by just six places in the First Division - as Liverpool had been the dominant side in English football for some 15 years whereas Wimbledon had played just two seasons in the First Division and only 11 as a Football League club. He performed well in the league, scoring 14 goals.\n\nHe also scored Wimbledon's goal as Liverpool defeated them 2–1 in that year's Charity Shield. Fashanu claimed two England caps – against Chile and Scotland in a friendly tournament in May 1989.\n\nDuring his time at Wimbledon, Fashanu scored 126 goals. His best season was 1990–91, when he was the First Division's second highest scorer with 20 goals as his side finished seventh.\n\nHe received criticism during the (1993–94) when a clash with Gary Mabbutt, then Spurs captain, in an aerial challenge left the Spurs defender with a broken skull and eye socket. Fashanu had already established a reputation by that point of being an aggressive and physical striker, and this was seen as another example of that behaviour. At that time synonymous with Wimbledon's \"Crazy Gang\" which had built up a reputation for this sort of play, also exhibited by the likes of Vinnie Jones and earlier on by Eric Young.\n\nOn 4 August 1994, just before the start of the 1994–95 season, Fashanu was sold to Aston Villa for £1.35million. However, injury restricted him to just 13 games and 3 goals for a Villa side who narrowly avoided relegation that season. He managed a goal on his Villa debut when they drew 2–2 at Everton on the opening day of the Premier League season, his other two goals coming in successive games against Queens Park Rangers and then Nottingham Forest in January.\n\nFashanu's last game was on 4 February 1995 away at Manchester United in a Premiership game that they lost 1–0. In a tackle with Ryan Giggs he snapped his knee ligaments and was stretchered off. After the end of the season, Fashanu retired as a result of injury.\n\nIn 1995 he hit the front pages as well as the back when \"The Sun\" published allegations of match fixing against Fashanu, fellow Wimbledon player Hans Segers and Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar. All three players were eventually cleared of the allegations in a subsequent court case.\n\nFashanu represented England at full International level gaining two caps – against Chile and Scotland in the 1989 Rous Cup, due to his good form at club level for his then club Wimbledon. He was also eligible to play for Nigeria and since retiring he has expressed regret in not being able to do so.\n\nFollowing retirement from the game through injury, Fashanu became a television presenter. He presented the UK edition of \"Gladiators\" alongside Ulrika Jonsson in the 1990s. In 2003, he came second in the second series of \"I'm a Celebrity... Get Me out of Here!\". Later that year he presented \"Fash's Football Challenge\", a reality television show that followed Fashanu managing an amateur football team. Also in 2003, he fronted a six-part series for ITV1 based on the American format \"Man vs. Beast\", however following protests from animal rights groups, the series was never broadcast. He also released a video \"Focus on Fitness with Fash\". He is now host of \"Deal or No Deal Nigeria\", airing on M-Net Africa.\n\nSince retirement Fashanu has also maintained his sporting connections, becoming involved with the Nigeria Football Association, and as chairman of Welsh football team Barry Town for one year, vacating this post in 2003.\n\nIn 2000, he also compiled, all with an investigator, a report on corruption in Nigeria in the 1980s and 1990s that came to be known as the Fashanu Report. In 2003, he became the manager of his own Sunday league football team Fash FC as part of a television reality show.\n\nIn September 2005 Wimbledon Old Players’ Association was launched. John is involved in the Wimbledon Old Players' Association, an organisation set up by the Wimbledon Independent Supporters Association. He said: \"It’s going to be great to be back as part of the Wimbledon family. As an ex-Wimbledon player, I know all about the heroics of the likes of Roy Law and Dickie Guy in the old days, as well as what the new boys have been doing at AFC Wimbledon\".\n\nIn 2007, \"The Times\" named him 22nd out of the 50 worst footballers to have played in the Premier League.\n\nIn August 2009, Fashanu, who in 2000 accused Bob Minton and Ibrahim Babangida of stealing money from Nigeria, apologised saying \"I can say it again and again, that there was nothing like debt buy-back or any billions stacked away in any account anywhere.\" Minton said that Fashanu was given false information by the Church of Scientology to attack him.\n\nWimbledon\n\n\nFashanu, who was the younger brother of Justin Fashanu, disowned his brother after the latter came out as gay, telling \"The Voice\" that Justin was \"an outcast\". After Justin took his own life in 1998, Fashanu expressed remorse for abandoning his brother.\n\nFashanu has two sons, Amir and Akio, and two daughters, Alana and Amal.\n\nFashanu has been married three times, according to a documentary on football culture made by his daughter Amal. He met his first wife, a Spaniard, when they were both 18. That marriage broke up when Amal was two years old.\n\nFashanu is also an accomplished martial artist who holds a black belt in Karate.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12534726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12534726", "title": "Key square", "text": "Key square\n\nIn chess, particularly in endgames, a key square (also known as a \"critical square\") is a square such that if a player's king can occupy it, he can force some gain such as the promotion of a pawn or the capture of an opponent's pawn. Key squares are useful mostly in endgames involving only kings and pawns. In the king and pawn versus king endgame, the key squares depend on the position of the pawn and are easy to determine. Some more complex positions have easily determined key squares while other positions have harder-to-determine key squares. Some positions have key squares for both White and Black.\nIn an endgame with a king and pawn versus a king, the key squares are relative to the position of the pawn. Assume that White has the pawn. If the white king can occupy a key square, he can force the promotion of the pawn but accurate play is required. Whether or not the white king can reach a key square depends on the position of the pieces and which player is to move .\n\nAn advanced generally has two key squares: the two squares on the adjacent that touch the promotion square, i.e. b7 and b8 for a white a-pawn, and g7 and g8 for a white h-pawn. The key squares are indicated by the black dots in the position in the diagram. If White's king can reach either of the two key squares, he can keep Black's king away and the pawn will promote. If the Black king can reach any of the squares marked with a dot or an \"×\", it stops the pawn – either by blocking the pawn or preventing the white king from reaching a key square . \n\nPawns other than rook pawns have more key squares. If the pawn is on the second, third, or fourth , there are three key squares – the square two squares in front of the pawn and the squares to the left and right of that square. The key squares are indicated by the black dots in the diagrams above. If the pawn is on the fifth or sixth rank, there are six key squares: the square in front of the pawn and the squares to the left and right, as well as the square two squares in front of the pawn, and the squares to the left and right of it, see the middle diagram. When the pawn is on the seventh rank, the key squares are the squares on the seventh and eighth rank that touch the pawn's square (see the diagram on the right).\n\nAn easy way to remember the key squares is to note that if the pawn is not beyond the midpoint of the board, there are three key squares that are two ranks ahead. If the pawn is on the fifth or sixth rank there are six key squares on the two ranks in front of the pawn. If the pawn is on the seventh rank, the adjoining squares on the seventh and eighth ranks are key squares .\n\nThere is an exception to the key squares rule with a on its sixth rank, the defending king in the corner, and the defender to move. In the diagram, with the white king on either the square indicated or the square marked by \"×\", the position is stalemate if Black is to move.\n\nThis position from a game between Svetozar Gligorić and Bobby Fischer illustrates key squares. Black to move can keep the white king from reaching a key square by 57...Kb8, so the game is drawn . If the white king moves to the fifth , Black takes the opposition. (See Opposition (chess)#Example for more details of this game.)\n\nIn a position with a blocked pair of pawns (opposing pawns on the same , the key squares for a player's king extend for three files on either side of the opponent's pawn. In this position, the first king to reach one of his key squares will win the opponent's pawn and protect his own. Even though the white king is farther away from the pawns, White wins if he moves first:\nThe white king reaches a key square.\nWhen both kings can reach a key square, a position of mutual zugzwang may occur. The first king to attack the opposing pawn must save a square for attack and defense (the squares marked \"×\"). With White to move:\nThe only winning move; all other moves lose. For instance, if 1.Kd6 then 1...Kf5 puts White in zugzwang and Black wins.\nNow Black is in zugzwang.\n\nIn this example, White would win if his king could get to any of the key squares (marked by the white dots). But Black is able to prevent this and draw the game – with or without the move. For example:\nThe only move to draw.\nThe only move to draw.\nThe only move to draw .\n\nIn this example, f6 is also a key square for the white king. White to move wins; Black to move draws. (All of Black's moves are the only move to draw.)\nWith a king and pawn versus a lone king, it is important to get the attacking king to \"any\" key square and the path to a key square is not always direct. For instance, in the diagram, the key squares for the white king are b5, c5, and d5. Black can prevent the white king from reaching a key square directly, for example:\nTaking the opposition; however, the white king can reach a key square (b5) by going on the other side of the pawn:\nOpposition, and Black is in zugzwang.\nor \nand the white king has occupied a key square and has a winning position .\n\n\nBibliography\n"}

It is situated in the Adelaide suburb of Morphettville, and is about 10 km from the Adelaide city centre. It is home to the South Australian Jockey Club.\n\nAfter years of using grounds at the East Parklands (\"The Old Adelaide Racecourse\", later known as Victoria Park) rented from the Adelaide City Council, a group which became the South Australian Jockey Club began using a racecourse (\"Thebarton Racecourse\" or \"The Butchers' Course\") at present-day Mile End formed on grazing land owned by E. M. Bagot and Gabriel Bennett near the River Torrens from 1859 to 1869, when the course was abandoned due to insufficient patronage. After five or six years of existence in name only, the SAJC acquired, thanks to the generosity of Sir Thomas Elder, its own freehold property at Morphettville (\"The Bay of Biscay Course\") and held its first meeting there on 3 January 1876. A breakaway group, which became the Adelaide Racing Club, continued to hold race meetings at \"The Old Racecourse\".\n\nIn 2008, firstly Victoria Park, and then in 2009 Cheltenham Park were discontinued as racing facilities in South Australia, and now races are conducted only at Morphettville.\n\nThe course proper at Morphettville is a long, flat course with a circumference of 2,307 metres. The track is 32 metres wide and features wide turns with a camber of 4% that provide every chance for strong finishers. A retractable winning post with hydraulics enables the SAJC the flexibility to alternate the running of races with minimal damage to both tracks especially with races taking place mid week and increased racing through the winter months. It was installed in 2009, and is a world first.\n\nThe second track, known as \"The Parks\", was official opened in June 2009. The Morphettville Parks track has a circumference of 2100 metres, and the track is 25 m wide and 5% chamber on the turns. It provides a fair chance for all runners. A chute through the centre of the course that runs between the 850 m and 1,550 m points provides for 1250, 1300 and 1400 metre starts.\n\nThe Morphettville Racecourse Wetland was an initiative of the Patawalonga Catchment Water Management Board and the South Australian Jockey Club. It was constructed by the Board and the Jockey Club during 2001/2002. The wetland covers an area of 3.5 hectares, in the middle of the racecourse on the corner of Anzac Highway and Morphett Road. Costing $2.4 million to construct, it includes 100,000 plants, with the soil excavated being used to raise the level of the racecourse track.\n\nThe catchment area for the wetland includes stormwater flow from two drains in Bray Street, south of the racecourse. Water enters a sediment pond where floating litter is collected in a net and large materials settle out. The water is then piped into the wetland, where it travels through a series of deep and shallow marshes. An aquifer storage and recovery system (ASR) has been constructed at the wetland. The water flowing out of the wetland is ideal for irrigation as it has very low salinity. During winter months, water is captured and pumped into a tertiary limestone aquifer below the racecourse. During the summer months, the water in the aquifer is recovered and used for irrigation. Up to 600 megalitres of water a year is recharged into the aquifer, which exceeds the amount required to irrigate the racecourse.\n\nThe racecourse is just off Anzac Highway, Morphett Rd, Morphettville. Entry is via Morphett Rd entrance or Tramway entrance. The Glenelg Tram operates throughout the day from North Tce, and Victoria Square (Adelaide), through to Moseley Square (Glenelg). The tram stops on Morphett Road adjacent to the Morphettville Racecourse (Stop 12). A taxi rank is located inside the Members' Car Park, where taxis will make pick ups and drop offs throughout the day. Car parking at Morphettville can be found at the following locations: Morphett Road Adjacent to the Members' entrance on the opposite side of the road to the racecourse.

{"id": "536759", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=536759", "title": "Pride Park Stadium", "text": "Pride Park Stadium\n\nPride Park Stadium, commonly known as Pride Park, is an all-seater football stadium in Derby, England, that is the home ground of English Football League club Derby County. With a capacity of 33,597, it is the 16th-largest football ground in England and the 20th-largest stadium in the United Kingdom. Located on Pride Park, a business park on the outskirts of Derby city centre, the stadium was built as part of the commercial redevelopment of the area in the 1990s. Derby County have played at the ground since it opened in 1997 as a replacement for their former home, the Baseball Ground. Due to sponsorship, the venue was officially known as the iPro Stadium between 2013 and 2016.\n\nPride Park has hosted two full international matches, England vs. Mexico in 2001 and Brazil vs. Ukraine in 2010, and several England under-21 matches. It was also the venue of the 2009 FA Women's Cup Final.\n\nBefore moving to the Pride Park Stadium, Derby County had played at the Baseball Ground since 1895. Although at its peak the ground had held over 40,000 (the record attendance being 41,826 for a match against Tottenham Hotspur in 1969) the Taylor Report, actioned after the 1989 Hillsborough Disaster had seen the legal requirement for English football stadia to become all-seater by 1994–95 season resulting in its capacity dwindling to just 17,500 by the mid-1990s, not enough for the then-ambitious second tier club. An additional problem came with the ground's wooden components (considered unacceptable in the wake of the Bradford City stadium fire in 1985) and, in February 1996, chairman Lionel Pickering made the decision to move the club to a new stadium, having originally planned to rebuild the Baseball Ground as a 26,000-seat stadium.\n\nThe club originally planned to build a purpose-built 30,000-seat stadium at Pride Park, with 4,000 car parking spaces, restaurant and conference facilities, a fitness centre, a supporters club and new training ground. A year later the stadium plan was changed to become part of a £46 million project by the Stadivarios group that would also include a 10,000-seat indoor arena. Peter Gadsby, however, the club's associate director at the time and head of the Miller Birch construction company, felt the project was both too ambitious and expensive and instead plans were drawn up by new Chairman Lionel Pickering to modernise and extend the Baseball Ground to hold 26,000, at a cost of £10 million. However, despite signing a construction agreement with Taylor Woodrow, Gadsby suggested the club make a second attempt at securing the then-redeveloping Pride Park business park, settling with Derby City Council for a smaller site than previously agreed. On 21 February 1996, prior to a match against Luton Town at The Baseball Ground, the club announced to supporters the decision to move to a £16 million state-of-the-art stadium for the start of the 1997–98 season.\n\nDerby City Council were paid £1.8 million for the land and the club's four directors – Lionel Pickering, Peter Gadsby, Stuart Webb and John Kirkland each paid £2.5 million towards a package deal to pay for the stadium. The stadium itself was based upon Middlesbrough's Riverside Stadium, which opened in 1995, though it had more than 30 amendments to the original plans. After toying with the idea of naming the new ground \"The New Baseball Ground\", it was settled that the club's new home would be called The Pride Park Stadium.\n\nEngaging the same architects as Middlesbrough (The Miller Partnership) Derby's plans predominantly followed those of the Riverside Stadium, with the first stage being a detached main stand facing a horseshoe running unbroken round the other three sides, with the possibility of the corners being filled in later and the ground's capacity being increased if and when necessary by raising the horseshoe roof.\n\nPickering laid the foundation stone in November 1995 and, after decontamination, the first of the more than 1,000 pre-cast concrete piles was sunk in September 1996. This was followed by 6,500 tonnes of concrete and more than 2,100 tonnes of steelwork as the ground began to take shape. Tapping into the excitement amongst supporters, the club set up a visitors centre which included a computer-generated tour of the stadium taking shape and attracted more than 75,000 fans. The opportunity was also made available for supporters to buy special bricks – on to which they could engrave a message of their choosing – which would be set around the outside of the completed stadium.\n\nThe weather of the 1996 winter was not kind to the contractors but extra urgency was provided by the news that the stadium was to be opened by the Queen. This news – the first time the Queen had opened a new football stadium – ensured that the workers, at one point behind schedule, had to pull out all of the stops to get the stadium completed in time. The pitch stood at long and wide, meeting the requirements for an international venue, and measured longer and wider than the pitch at the Baseball Ground. It also came with a grass margin.\n\nThe Queen opened the stadium on 18 July 1997 in front of 30,000 spectators. By this time the south west corner, which stood between the main stand and the horseshoe, had been completed. The interest from potential corporate clients had been so high that Pickering pressed the board to go the full distance with the stadium, raising the final initial costs of completing the stadium to £22 million. Work was still in progress on the remaining corner on the opening day, leaving Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh to jokingly ask Taylor Woodrow contract manager Ross Walters, \"Haven't you been paid yet?\" An overture to the opening ceremony came two weeks later, on 4 August 1997, with the first ever game at Pride Park Stadium being played against Italian side Sampdoria, the match ending in a 1–0 defeat with Vincenzo Montella scoring the only goal of the game. The attendance of 29,041 was the highest for a Derby County home game in 20 years. The fixture kicked off a tradition of pre-season friendlies being held against European teams at the ground, with Barcelona (twice), CSKA Moscow, Athletic Bilbao, Lazio, Ajax and Mallorca all visiting the stadium over the next six years.\n\nThe first competitive fixture to be completed at the new stadium came on 30 August 1997 and ended in a 1–0 win against Barnsley in front of 27,232, with Stefano Eranio scoring the only goal from the penalty spot. The stadium's inaugural competitive fixture against Wimbledon was called off with the score at 2–1 after the floodlights went out in the 11th minute of the second half. Referee Uriah Rennie abandoned the match following a delay of more than half-an-hour while engineers tried unsuccessfully to restart two failed generators. Gadsby said, \"We had 11 maintenance people on duty including six electricians but nobody has yet worked out why both generators failed. There was a bang of such strength that it fused them both.\" This proved to be the only major problem with the new stadium, which delivered everything which had been promised of it and went on to gain international recognition. Later additions to the ground raised the capacity to 33,597 and a final cost of £28 million.\n\nAlthough the financing of the stadium's construction was carefully structured so that the club paid and owned the ground without encroaching on funds reserved for the development of the team, the club's eventual relegation from the top flight in 2002 saw it enter financial crisis and eventually it was temporarily entered into receivership by The Co-operative Bank, who instantly installed a new board composed of John Sleightholme, Jeremy Keith and Steve Harding, for the cost of £1 each. Financial circumstances worsened as the debt spiralled to £30 million plus and an unpopular refinancing scheme was put in place which saw the stadium sold to the \"mysterious\" Panama-based ABC Corporation and the club paying rent of £1 million a year to play there, which local journalist Gerald Mortimer described as \"an affront ... to those who put everything into building [the ground]\". The ownership trio of Sleightholme, Keith and Harding were dubbed \"The Three Amigos\" and, after came under increasing criticism from the Derby's support, in the form of two separate supporters groups, the RamsTrust and the Rams Protest Group (RPG), they eventually sold out to a group of local businessmen, dubbed \"The League of Gentlemen\" by the local press, led by former board member Peter Gadsby, in April 2006. The Gadsby-led consortium returned Pride Park to club ownership. Three years later, Murdo Mackay, Jeremy Keith and finance director Andrew McKenzie were charged with taking a secret commission worth £440,625 from the club and were sentenced to a combined seven-and-a-half years in prison. As of August 2009, the club still owed £15 million on the mortgage of the Pride Park Stadium which was later revealed to be due to be paid off in 2016.\n\n During the 2006–07 season, in which Derby earned promotion back to the Premier League after five years, the club released details of a proposed £20 million development of the area surrounding the stadium, to include the building of a 165-bed hotel, bars, restaurants and office space, to create a local service centre for employers located on the Pride Park business park. Three squares would also be introduced which would be named after legendary figures associated with the club – all-time leading goalscorer Steve Bloomer, the club's greatest manager Brian Clough and former chairman Lionel Pickering, who had died in 2006. The club insisted no money would be taken away from the team to pay for the development. On 9 November 2007, Derby City Council agreed to let the plans go ahead. Following promotion to the Premier League in the 2006–07 season, the club announced plans to expand the capacity of the stadium up to 44,000 for the start of the 2008–09 season, if the club successfully survived. The plans included adding rows of seats to the north, south and east stands and would have allowed the club to break its current club record attendance. The club, however, failed to maintain its top-flight status and when, in January 2008, was sold into new American ownership, in the form of General Sports and Entertainment both the plaza plan and the ground expansion initiatives were scrapped.\n\nIn 2008, a nine-foot-high bronze statue of Brian Clough and Peter Taylor – who had managed the club between 1967 and 1973 – was commissioned to adorn the north west portion of the ground to be called Unity Plaza. The statue was designed by Andrew Edwards and features both Clough and Taylor holding the League Championship trophy which they won with the club in 1972. It was unveiled on 27 August 2010.\n\nIn 2009, Pride Park was earmarked as a possible FIFA World Cup venue when Derby County announced its intention to apply to be one of the host cities as part of England's bid for the 2018 World Cup Finals, with Derby chief executive Tom Glick saying, \"What we [the board] know is that Derby already has the core elements to be a host city ... We are going to find out what the requirements are but we are certainly expecting that the requirement would be at least 40,000 seats. The ability to do that at Pride Park Stadium exists, the land exists. So we know that if we were successful, that is something that could be done.\" To qualify as a host stadium, the ground would need to expand to at least 40,000 capacity and the club announced that three methods could be undertaken to achieve this, two of which would leave the stadium permanently expanded. Option A would see the additional capacity supplied by temporary stands erected behind each goal, removing the current roof, and be supported by steel structures, with all the stands removed after the World Cup and the original roofing replaced. Option B would also see temporary seating built in the north and south stands as well as an additional structure placed on the east stand which the club could choose to keep, increasing the capacity to 39,000. The final Option, C, would see the removal of seating from the north, south and east stands and three new 20 row decks placed in each stand. This again came with the option of retaining the east stand expansion, raising the stadium capacity to a permanent 37,000. The club itself stated that it preferred to explore temporary, rather than permanent, expansion, saying \"We'd like to meet the World Cup standards for matches when it comes to expansion but then perhaps scale down the stadium to something closer to where we are right now. That way, we can keep the intimacy and special atmosphere that has almost become a hallmark of going to a Derby County match. When the team play at home, having a full stadium is a huge advantage because it creates a brilliant atmosphere. What we wouldn't want to do is have a stadium that all of a sudden was too big after the World Cup had gone.\" On 16 December 2009, Derby's campaign was rejected by the FA, along with Hull and Leicester to local rival bid by Nottingham Forest. Tom Glick later commented, \"We're all greatly disappointed. Thousands of hours of hard work has been put in across the city from a number of agencies. We need to get some feedback as to why the bid was not successful.\"\n\nThe club was later unsuccessful in its attempt to be the Midlands football venue for the 2012 Summer Olympics, losing out to Coventry City's Ricoh Arena, with the selection committee citing the fact the stadium \"has fewer dressing rooms and no hotel\" in comparison to the Coventry-based stadium.\n\nOn 17 January 2009, a bust of Steve Bloomer was unveiled next to the home dugout.\n\nOn 3 October 2011, Derby County announced that they had submitted plans to Derby City Council for a £7 million development of land outside the stadium, which the club named \"The Plaza @ Pride Park\".\n\nThese plans include five cafes/restaurants, two convenience stores and 2,000 square metres of office space. These plans have been scaled down from the planned £20 million pound development proposed in 2007. Derby County CEO Tom Glick said that these plans would help the club deal with the new Financial Fair Play regulations which will be introduced in the Football League from 2012, as revenue from the plaza will be reinvested back into the club.\n\nThis planned development also coincides with a plan from the city council to build a multi-use sports arena on the same site as the proposed plaza.\n\nOn 12 January 2012, Derby City Council's planning control committee gave planning permission for the development, Derby County chief executive Tom Glick said that the club had moved to the next stage of the development, finding a development company to build the plaza.\n\nIt was announced on 3 May 2013 that the first phase was to be launched after the last game of the 2012–13 season when Derby County faced Milwall. Located in the north east corner of the stadium and close to the DCFC megastore, the initial phase will provide a mixture of retail and restaurant units totalling 7,000sq.ft. The development is being undertaken jointly by the club and Cedar House Investments, part of former chairman Peter Gadsby's Ark Capital group of companies. John Vicars, chief operating officer at Derby County, welcomed the launch by saying, \"We see this development attracting perhaps a convenience retailer, and a restaurant to complement the facilities already available on Pride Park and to provide a greater choice. With the opening of the new multi-use sports arena and velodrome adjacent to the club, there will be even greater demand for these facilities.\" Peter Gadsby said: \"The area is already a proven destination for leading occupiers including Greggs, Frankie & Benny's, Subway and Starbucks. I am particularly keen that this scheme will add to the success of Pride Park and provide further amenities for the 10,000 people that are working in the area. It is good news that this phase of the development will create a further 25 jobs.\"\n\nA phase 2 of the plaza will be considered once the velodrome has opened and will add further to the vitality and vibrancy of Pride Park. Derby-based FHP have been appointed as letting agents for the scheme.\n\nOn 7 December 2013, Pride Park was renamed the iPro Stadium in a £7 million sponsorship deal with global sports' drink company iPro. The club announced the cancellation of the sponsorship deal on 18 November 2016, reverting the stadium's name back to Pride Park.\n\nThe highest attendance at Pride Park Stadium for a competitive Derby County match is 33,378 in a Premier League match against Liverpool on 18 March 2000.\n\nIn a testimonial for Ted McMinn, on 1 May 2006, former players of both Derby County and Rangers contested a match at Derby County's Pride Park Stadium in which a record 33,475 spectators attended – around 10,000 of them being Rangers fans.\n\nAs one of the largest football grounds in the Midlands, Pride Park has also hosted some notable matches not connected to Derby County.\n\nPride Park has hosted one full England international; a 4–0 friendly victory over Mexico on 25 May 2001, when the national side toured the country during the building of the new Wembley Stadium. The match also holds the record for the highest attendance at the stadium: a full-house of 33,598.\n\nThe ground has hosted six England U21 matches. The results were as follows;\nPartly as a result of Derby's successful hosting of international U21 football, Pride Park was selected as a host venue as part of the English bid to host the 2013 European U21s Championship.\n\nAway from the England national side, the stadium hosted a friendly between Brazil and Ukraine on 11 October 2010. The match ended in a 2–0 victory for Brazil, with Dani Alves and Alexandre Pato scoring the goals, in front of a crowd of 13,088 live spectators and TV viewers in over 100 countries. Though Brazil coach Mano Menezes bemoaned the low turnout (\"I expected more fans but I think it was a good game\") though Derby chief executive Tom Glick declared himself relatively pleased with the turnout, saying \"I think everybody was hoping that we'd have a sold out crowd of over 30,000 but, realistically, time was working against us. We only had 13 days to sell the tickets and a big crowd just wasn't on the cards. But I think we've proven that we can turn it around, operationally. The promoter, Kentaro, has seen that. So we have done ourselves a favour in terms of bringing something else like this back again and we will continue to pursue things like this.\"\n\nAway from international football, on 4 May 2009 Pride Park hosted the 39th FA Women's Cup Final, which saw Arsenal run out 2–1 victors over Sunderland to win the cup for a record fourth consecutive time, in front of a crowd of 23,291.\nAlthough primarily a football venue, Pride Park Stadium has also hosted events away from sport. It first hosted singer Rod Stewart on 26 June 2005 while touring his \"\" album. This was followed by Red Hot Chili Peppers, who played at the ground as part of the tour for their \"Stadium Arcadium\" album on 5 June 2006. Monster Jam came to Pride Park Stadium on 28 & 29 May 2011. \n\n"}

The new sports complex replaced the old UST Gymnasium which was built in 1933.\n\nSince 1933, the university only had the old UST Gymnasium, which was considered then as the biggest gymnasium during its time, as venue to hold practices for its athletes, as well as to hold non-sporting events.\n\nIn recent years, the student population increased to 40,000, prompting university officials to recognize the need for a new sporting facility within the campus.\n\nA groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 29, 2008 after the Vatican gave its \"blessing\" to the project as UST is a pontifical university, directly under the supervision of the Holy See.\n\nThe location of the sports complex lies on the former site of the Engineering Sports Complex that has an open field for softball and football, outdoor basketball courts, a tennis court, a covered basketball court with bleachers, and a canteen.\n\nIt was originally named as the UST Sports Complex, but the Council of Regents announced on October 18, 2011 that the new building will be called the Quadricentennial Pavilion.\n\nRev. Fr. Rolando V. de la Rosa, the former Rector of the University, described the then yet to be built facility as more than just a place for events and ceremonies as it will serve as a monument to \"the unique and unparalleled holistic\" sports development program of the university. The facility was planned to be the home of the UST varsity players and the Growling Tigers starting academic year of 2012.\n\nThe Quadricentennial Pavilion was designed by chief architect Carmelo Casas, who also designed the UST Carpark Building. The first architectural plan for the facility was made in 2007. For three years before the groundbreaking of the facility in July 2008, Millenium Sports Universal Co. coordinated with Casas in the planning and design stage where they were tasked to create a sporting facility of at least 5,000 seating capacity.\n\nThe structure has four storeys with its first floor being elevated to address potential flooding. The dimensions of the sports facility is 65.98 x 76 square-meter and stands on a lot. A double wall design, by devising two walls separated by a space, was employed for the interior walls of the structure for noise insulation. To minimize solar exposure to the sports venue's interior, louvers were utilized as part of the building's façade. This feature was also used to highlight to emphasize the building's exterior.\n\nThe project manager the facility was Asian Technicon Managers & Consultants, Inc.\n\nThe dance hall for the Salinggawi Dance Troupe as well as training halls for badminton, fencing, judo, table tennis, and taekwondo are located in the ground floor of the Quadricentennial Pavilion. There is also a two-level fitness center on this floor and a gymnastics room. Five lecture rooms for IPEA (Institute of Physical Education and Athletics) is also located on this floor. On the third level, the facility features a two-lane overall track encircling the building. The first floor training facilities and dance hall has a of rubberized flooring.\n\nFour-storey sports complex mainly features a maplewood hardcourt basketball court on the second floor with rows of seats rising up to the fourth level of the building. The topmost section are accessible from the fourth level while the middle section is accessible from the third level. The court is surrounded by a tiger-stripe border with a tiger's head as another design element. The basketball venue is surrounded by orange, red and yellow seats.\n\nIn total the Quadricentennial Pavilion has a seating capacity of at least 5,792 people. local-distributor Millenium Sports Universal Co., provided retractable rows of 1,562 polyprothylene chairs. Outside the playing court, the flooring is made up of engineered wood by Robbins which was also responsible for the wooden court. Maine-base Hussey supplied the retractable rows and chairs up to the fourth level. S'portable Scoreboards supplied the 4-sided scoreboard of the facility.\n\nThe second floor holds the offices for IPEA, guidance counselors, and sports science. The institute have a faculty room and other multimedia rooms for students. This floor also hosts two dug-outs and two lounges for coaches.\n\nThe new gym also serves as a museum that enshrines all the trophies, medals and other memorabilia of various UAAP championships the university has won. Championship banners will also hang from the rafters of the gymnasium. On the third level, the facility's windows holds posters and memorabilia displaying sporting events and selected Thomasian athletes.\n\nOn one side facing the Roque Ruano Building are retail spaces for banks and restaurants. The facility is also capable of hosting non-athletic events such as concerts, graduation ceremonies, conferences, and the University mass.\n\nIts toilets and faucets inside the lavatories and restrooms are automated and the entire vicinity is controlled by a centralized air-conditioning system. A closed circuit television (CCTV) system is also installed in selected areas within the sports venue for security. The CCTV network is controlled from the Information Technology Data room which is located in the second floor of the facility.\n\nThe main lobby of the facility features a steel sculpture named \"Campione\" (Spanish: \"champion\"), designed by Thomasian artist Joe Datuin. The sculptor won in the 2008 Olympic Committee Sports and Arts contest.\n"}

The test was originally developed by the \"Academy of Ratzeburg rowing\", Germany in 1971. It was employed by the Great Britain Junior rowing team selectors in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nEach element of the test was supervised by one of the GB junior rowing selection team. All parts of the test were completed in succession during an afternoon. The sequence was a timed 3,000 metre run on an athletic track, then a weight lifting test, followed by a gym circuit test.\nThe weight lifting test consisted of successive power clean lifts at increasing weight until failure. At a given weight, recorded in pounds, a maximum of 3 failures were allowed.\n\nThe circuit test counted the number of repetitions performed in one minute for each of the followin exercises:\nIf any repetition did not meet the standard required it would not be included in the circuit repetitions count.\n\nThe subject’s height was measured in centimetres from the floor up to the clavicle (just below the neck) and the subjects weight in kilograms.\nParticipants were required to score a minimum index value of 20.0 in order to pass to the next stage in the selection process.\n\nEach element of the test had a specific “constant value”. Each empirical value of an element taken for a subject had the respective constant value subtracted to emphasize better scores.\n\nThe calculation was performed as follows: \n\nRatzburg Test Index Value =\n(\n(Subject_Height_Value – Subject_Height_Constant) x\n(Subject_Weight_Value – Subject_Weight_Constant) x\n(Power_Clean_Value – Power_Clean_Contant) x\nDivided by\n( Run_Time_Value – Run_Time_Constant) x 1,000\n\nThe test penalised lightweight rowers who would provide a lower weight value into the calculation. This encouraged participants to attempt to increase body weight during the winter season, only losing the weight again after the testing period had completed.\n\nIt did however allow those who were physically appropriate for international rowing to be recognised, and created a focus on all round physical fitness in the winter training period rather than only specific rowing fitness.\n"}

It is located on the east bank of the River Usk in Newport city centre. The ground is on Rodney Road, a short walk from the city's central bus and railway stations via Newport Bridge or Newport City footbridge. There is no spectator car park at the ground but a number of multi-storey car parks are nearby.\n\nRodney Parade is the home ground of Dragons regional rugby union team and rugby union club Newport RFC. It is also the home ground of Newport County football club, and is the second-oldest sports venue in the Football League, after Deepdale. However, stadium capacity is reduced for football matches.\n\nNewport Squash Club has four courts at Rodney Parade.\n\nRodney Parade has two covered stands: the two-tier Hazell Stand (west) and the Bisley Stand (east) which are along the touchlines of the pitch. The upper tier of the west stand is seated with 1,996 seats, including 40 Press seats and the lower tier is a standing terrace. The east stand is all-seated with a 2,526 capacity including 144 seats in 13 hospitality boxes, food/drink outlets and a gantry for television cameras. The cameras are therefore pointing westward and often show the sun setting over Newport city centre.\n\nThe North Terrace is uncovered standing and adjoins the uncovered standing terrace on the west touchline alongside the west stand. The south end of the stadium houses players' changing rooms, a media centre and the small uncovered Sytner stand with 222 seats for away football fans. Away football fans are also sited in block F of the east stand giving a total capacity of 1,300 for away football fans. A large video screen was erected at the south end in December 2013.\n\nThe hospitality suite is located in the north end of the east stand on the upper level.\n\nThe rugby ticket office and club shop is located at the north end of the East Stand accessed via the main gate to the ground (Gate 4) off Grafton Road. The Newport County ticket office is a separate building just inside Gate 4.\n\nTo the north of the North Terrace is a floodlit grass training area. Further north, parallel to Grafton Road, is the Rodney Hall function room and the rugby clubhouse/office facilities.\n\nIn 1875, the Newport Athletic Club was created, and two years later they secured the use of land at Rodney Parade from Godfrey Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar for their cricket, tennis, rugby and athletics teams. In October 1879 Newport RFC played Cardiff RFC in a floodlit game at Rodney Parade; the first ground to have floodlights installed in Wales.[10] Newport rugby club enjoyed six highly successful seasons, having been unbeaten for six consecutive seasons. Newport sustained their first defeat in the 1870s, they were again unbeaten in seasons 1891-2 and 1922-3. Monmouthshire County Cricket Club played at Rodney Parade from 1901 to 1934. Newport RFC provided internationals for every one of the four home countries at Rodney Parade, as well as South Africa. Newport were once scheduled for a regular fixture, against Bristol - a team drawn from Welsh, English, Irish and Scottish internationals. The powerful All Blacks of 1924, and the strong Springboks of 1960 were considered fortunate to evade defeat at Rodney Parade.\n\nThe cricket ground which was on the south of the site no longer exists as the new Maindee primary school was built on the site in 1993 and Newport Cricket Club relocated to Newport International Sports Village.\n\nFollowing the introduction of regional rugby union teams in Wales the Newport Gwent Dragons regional team were formed on 1 April 2003 and shared Rodney Parade with Newport RFC for the 2013-14 season onwards.\n\nOn 4 September 2007 it was announced that the Rodney Parade site was due to be redeveloped into a 15,000-capacity stadium by the beginning of the 2010-11 rugby union season. The redevelopment was backed by Newport City Council, Newport Unlimited, Newport RFC and Newport Gwent Dragons. The application received planning consent on 11 March 2009. The plan included construction of covered stands at the north and south ends and to provide cover on the currently uncovered stretch of the west touchline terrace. In August 2010 it was announced that the target finish date for the first phase had been put back to the beginning of the 2011–12 rugby union season with the full redevelopment planned to take several years. The new east stand was opened in October 2011 and named the Bisley Stand for sponsorship purposes.\n\nIn May 2012 it was agreed that Newport County football club would relocate from Newport Stadium and play its home fixtures at Rodney Parade in an initial three-year deal, the first time that the stadium would host association football matches on a regular basis. In February 2013 Newport County agreed a further 10-year lease to play at Rodney Parade.\n\nIn April 2013 Newport Athletic Bowls Club relocated from Rodney Parade to Caerleon.\n\nIn the summers of 2013 and 2014 new drainage and irrigation systems were installed under the grass playing surface. Despite that, serious drainage problems occurred at the end of 2016. Newport County's matches against Barnet on 3 September and Morecambe on 10 December were abandoned at half-time because the pitch was waterlogged and the English Football League stepped in to help identify the problem.\n\nIn March 2017 sale of the ground to the Welsh Rugby Union was agreed following a vote of Newport RFC Shareholders. The deal included the WRU wholly owning both the ground and the regional rugby union team which was renamed from Newport Gwent Dragons to Dragons. The takeover was completed on 27 June 2017 and work started to install a hybrid grass pitch for the 2017-18 rugby and football season.\n\nRodney Parade has hosted six full-cap rugby union international matches for the Wales national rugby union team:\n\nIt has hosted one match for the Wales women's national football team:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4230717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4230717", "title": "Silver Stadium", "text": "Silver Stadium\n\nSilver Stadium was a baseball stadium located at 500 Norton Street in Rochester, New York. It was the home stadium for the Rochester Red Wings of the International League from 1929 to 1996, and for the New York Black Yankees of the Negro National League for their final season in 1948. The ballpark also briefly hosted professional football as it was the home field for the Rochester Braves (second American Football League) in 1936 and the Rochester Tigers (second American Football League) in 1936 and 1937.\n\nThe facility opened May 2, 1929, as Red Wing Stadium. It was renamed Silver Stadium on August 19, 1968, for Morrie Silver, then the president of Rochester Community Baseball, Inc. Silver Stadium hosted its final event, a Governors' Cup playoff game between the Columbus Clippers and the Red Wings, on September 10, 1996, and was demolished in late 1997 and early 1998. The site is now an industrial and office park.\n\nSilver Stadium cost $415,000 to construct and opened on May 2, 1929, as Red Wing Stadium. At the time, the stadium had a maximum capacity of 15,000. The park was built in the middle of a thriving urban residential neighborhood, which like most suffered a decline in the latter half of the century. Plentiful parking for automobiles, not a huge concern at the time it was built, became an issue as more and more fans drove their cars to the ballpark.\n\nIn late 1956, the St. Louis Cardinals, then the major league affiliate of the Rochester Red Wings and also the owners of Red Wing Stadium and the Red Wings, were exploring the possibility of removing the franchise from their minor league system. In response, Morrie Silver, a Rochester businessman, spearheaded an effort to purchase both assets from the Cardinals. A total of 8,222 stockholders, including Silver, came together to form Rochester Community Baseball, Inc. (RCB) The effort was ultimately successful as RCB purchased both assets on February 27, 1957, ensuring that the team would remain in Rochester for the 1957 season and beyond. Red Wing Stadium was renamed Silver Stadium in Silver's honor on August 19, 1968.\nMajor League Baseball mandated changes to minor league ballparks in the 1990s to both upgrade the field of play and the facilities that the players used. Even though it was renovated in the mid-1980s, Silver was deficient in a number of these areas. Like most old ballparks of its era, it did not have any corporate luxury suites. The official story is that public sentiment in Rochester was in favor of building a new ballpark somewhere closer to the downtown area, with plenty of parking and access to expressways. However, at various times, proposals were made to build the new stadium in one of Rochester's suburbs, namely Greece, Avon and Victor.\n\nGround was broken on Frontier Field, a new stadium located in downtown Rochester next to Eastman Kodak's world headquarters, in 1995. Frontier Field opened on July 11, 1996, allowing Silver Stadium to close on September 10, 1996. Silver Stadium was demolished in late 1997 and early 1998, and the site is now an industrial and office park.\n\nThe Rochester Red Wings of the International League moved from the Bay Street Ball Grounds to Red Wing Stadium following the 1928 season. Red Wing Stadium opened May 2, 1929, with a regular season game between the Red Wings and the Reading Keystones. Rochester lost, 3–0. The Wings continued to play at the facility until the 1996 season. On August 30, 1996, the Red Wings lost, 8–5, to the Ottawa Lynx in the final regular season game at Silver Stadium. Rochester also lost the final game ever at Silver Stadium, game two of the Governors' Cup Finals on September 10, 1996, by a margin of 4–0 to the Columbus Clippers. The Red Wings moved to Frontier Field for the 1997 season.\n\nThe New York Black Yankees of the Negro National League played at Red Wing Stadium in 1948. The season was the last in the team's history.\n\nOutside of baseball, the ballpark briefly hosted professional football as Red Wing Stadium was the home field for the Rochester Braves (second American Football League) in 1936 and the Rochester Tigers (second American Football League) in 1936 and 1937.\n\nThe largest attendance at the stadium was 31,000, for a concert by The Grateful Dead on June 30, 1988, eclipsing their previous record of 30,100, on July 2, 1987.\n\n"}

The stadium has 44,000 seats and is located in the centre of Sofia, on the territory of the city's oldest and most famous park - the Borisova gradina.\nThe Bulgaria national football team's home matches and the Bulgarian Cup finals are held at the venue, as well as athletics competitions. It was used as the home venue for Levski Sofia's Champions League games, and is often used for important derbies between the big clubs from Sofia, instead of their own home stadiums.\n\nVasil Levski National Stadium was officially opened in 1953, extended in 1966 and renovated in 2002.\n\nPrior to their demolition by the Communist authorities during the 1940s and 50s, two other stadiums stood on the ground where the current national stadium lies. One of those was Levski Sofia's club stadium, called Levski Field (Bulgarian: \"Igrishte Levski\", completed 1934), and the other - the Yunak Stadium (built 1928), which lay partially to the southwest. The latter used to host national football team matches with its capacity of about 15,000 seats. Levski were compensated for their loss with a place in the suburbs of Sofia where they were allowed to build a new stadium - the present day Georgi Asparuhov.\n\nThe Vasil Levski stadium was completed in 1953 with an announced capacity of 42 000. Originally, only the lower tier of stands was built (roughly half the height of the current stands), and, due to the uneven lie of the land, the western end of the pitch and stands were below ground level. \nThe upper tier was built about a decade later, with the current floodlight towers built in the late 1960s.\n\nThe Vasil Levski stadium was used for athletics competitions immediately after its official opening on 5 July 1953. The first football match played there after its opening was a friendly between Dinamo Sofia and and, a month later, it also began being used for league games. The first international was a world cup qualifier on 6 September against Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe stadium offers also judo, artistic gymnastics, basketball, boxing, aerobics, fencing and table tennis halls, as well as a general physical training hall, two conference halls and three restaurants.\nIt hosted the 1957 European basketball championship.\n\nIt was the proposed venue for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies in Sofia's bid for the 2014 Winter Olympics.\n\nIn July 2011 plans were announced to build a new, state of the art 40000-seater national stadium in the Sofia suburbs, but was later scrapped.\n\nThe stadium has hosted music shows by a number of regional and world stars.\n\nThe most successful concert in Bulgaria ever and thus at the Vasil Levski stadium was held by Yugoslav superstar Lepa Brena on 24 July 1990 in front of 110,000 people. This record remains unbroken to date. The curiosity of the concert was the way Lepa Brena arrived at the stadium - by landing from the helicopter directly to the stage.\n\nAmerican metal band Metallica held one of the most successful concerts in Bulgaria in the stadium as part of their 2008 European Vacation Tour, attracting 50,000 people.\n\nAmerican superstar Madonna had a very successful concert here as part of the second European second leg of her Sticky & Sweet Tour on August 29, 2009. She performed in front of 54,000 people and was warmly welcomed by her numerous fans. After the show, the grass was badly damaged, which caused some discontent amongst football fans, national team players, coaches and staff.\n\nOn 14 May 2010, Australian rock band AC/DC played the Bulgarian capital Sofia, in front of nearly 60,000 fans as part of their Black Ice World Tour.\n\nA festival, under the name \"Sofia Rocks\", part of Sonisphere Festival took place on the Vasil Levski National Stadium. The festival was held over 2 days on the 22nd and 23 June with live performances by world-renowned bands such as Rammstein, Metallica, Manowar and Alice in Chains among others.\n\nThe Big Four, Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, performed all together during the Sonisphere Festival.

{"id": "1974631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1974631", "title": "Wade Stadium", "text": "Wade Stadium\n\nWade Stadium is a baseball park located near the intersection of Grand Avenue and 34th Avenue West in the West Duluth neighborhood of Duluth, Minnesota. The stadium was built in 1941 and holds 4,200 people. It is the home of the Duluth Huskies of the Northwoods League and The College of St. Scholastica baseball team who have won 19 straight Upper Midwest Athletic Conference (UMAC) regular season and 18 straight post-season titles. \"The Wade\", as it is sometimes called by fans, was also the home of the Duluth–Superior Dukes of the reincarnated Northern League from 1993 until 2002, and the home of Dukes of the original Northern League from 1941 until 1970. One of a dying breed of Works Progress Administration (WPA) constructed stadiums, \"The Wade\" is noted for its short distances (especially from home plate to center field), its high fences, and the cool, damp weather generated by nearby Lake Superior.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, the U.S. federal government used the WPA to fund projects to boost employment. One of these projects was the removal of the brick roadbed from Grand Avenue, which was then paved with asphalt. During the fall of 1940, road crews removed 381,000 bricks from the surface of Grand Avenue. Another WPA crew used these bricks to build Wade Stadium.\n\nThe decision to build Wade Stadium originated with a 1938 study commissioned by Walter Chantigney, chairman of Duluth's Citywide All-Sports committee. The study found that the Duluth Duke's existing stadium, Athletic Park, was obsolete. According to the study: \n\nChantigney gathered more than 7,500 signatures to place a construction bond measure on the November, 1938, ballot. After voters approved the bond measure, money was gathered over the next two years from bond sales, the state of Minnesota, and the WPA. The site selected for the new stadium was located directly across Grand Avenue from Athletic Park.\n\nA construction budget totaling $163,232 was set. But, due to cost overruns, the final cost of the stadium was $230,880. During construction, the project received several bailouts. One bailout came from Duluth's newly elected mayor, Edward H. Hatch, who purchased the materials needed to finish construction.\n\nThe stadium's original name was Duluth All-Sports Municipal Stadium. It was renamed Wade Municipal Stadium in 1954 in honor of former Duluth Dukes owner Frank Wade, who died in 1953.\n\nThe Duluth Dukes played their first game in the new stadium on July 16, 1941. Their first opponent was their local rival, the Superior Blues. When the Blues folded in 1955, the Dukes (known as the White Sox during the 1956–59 seasons) became the Duluth–Superior Dukes. The original Dukes played in Wade Stadium from 1941 through the 1970 season. The only break came during the 1943–45 seasons when the Northern League suspended play due to World War II. The stadium was the home of three teams in the Twin Ports League, the only Class E league in the history of baseball, in 1943.\n\nWhen television began carrying Major League Baseball games in the 1950s, minor league baseball suffered from a drop in advertising revenue. Many of the smaller minor leagues around the country folded. The Northern League became one of these casualties when it was announced prior to the 1971 season that it was ceasing operations. After the original Northern League disbanded, the stadium was rarely used over the next twelve years. It was being threatened with demolition when the newly created Northern League awarded Duluth a franchise in 1993. The Stadium has had a tenant every year since. When the Dukes moved out of the Stadium in 2002, the void was filled almost immediately by the Huskies.\n\n"}

{"id": "2458048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2458048", "title": "White coat", "text": "White coat\n\nA white coat or laboratory coat (often abbreviated to lab coat) is a knee-length overcoat/smock worn by professionals in the medical field or by those involved in laboratory work. The coat protects their street clothes and also serves as a simple uniform. The garment is made from white or light-colored cotton, linen, or cotton polyester blend, allowing it to be washed at high temperature and making it easy to see if it is clean.\n\nSimilar coats are a symbol of learning in Argentina and Uruguay, where they are worn by both students and teachers in state schools. In Tunisia and Mozambique, teachers wear white coats to protect their street clothes from chalk.\n\nLike the word \"suit\", the phrase \"white coat\" is sometimes used as a synecdoche to denote the wearer, such as a scientist working in a high-tech company.\n\nWhite coats are sometimes seen as the distinctive dress of both physicians and surgeons, who have worn them for over 100 years. In the nineteenth century, respect for the certainty of science was in stark contrast to the quackery and mysticism of nineteenth century medicine. To emphasize the transition to the more scientific approach to modern medicine, physicians sought to represent themselves as scientists, and began to wear the most recognizable symbol of the scientist, the white laboratory coat.\n\nRecently, white coat ceremonies have become popular amongst those starting medical school.\n\nThe modern white coat was introduced to medicine in the late 1800s as a symbol of cleanliness.\n\nA study conducted in the United Kingdom found that the majority of patients prefer their doctors to wear white coats, but the majority of doctors prefer other clothing, such as scrubs. The study found that psychiatrists were among the least likely to wear white coats and when they are worn, they are typically worn over the scrubs. Some medical doctors view the coats as hot and uncomfortable, and many feel that they spread infection.\n\nSome patients who have their blood pressure measured in a clinical setting have higher readings than they do when measured in a home setting. This is apparently a result of patients feeling more relaxed when they are at home. The phenomenon is sometimes called \"white coat hypertension,\" in reference to the traditional white coats worn in a clinical setting, though the coats themselves may have nothing to do with the elevated readings.\n\nThe term is also used as verbal shorthand for psychiatric orderlies or other personnel and may be used, in a usually jocular manner, to imply someone's lunacy or paranoia.\n\nUntil the mid-1920s, students who were examining cadavers would wear black lab coats to show respect for the dead. Black lab coats were used in early biomedical and microbiology laboratories. The \"whiteness\" and \"pureness\" concepts that were established in medicine pervaded that environment at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries and physicians changed the black for the white coat.\n\nA white coat ceremony is a relatively new ritual that marks one's entrance into medical school and, more recently, into a number of related health-related schools and professions. It originated at University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Medicine in 1989 and involves a formal \"robing\" or \"cloaking\" in white lab coats.\n\nStudies have shown that doctor's coats worn in hospitals can harbor contagions including MRSA.\n\nIn 2007, the UK National Health Service started banning long-sleeved coats.\n\nIn 2009, the American Medical Association investigated banning coats with long sleeves to protect patients, but did not institute a ban.\n\nA study published in 2011 investigating the effectiveness of the NHS ban showed no statistical difference in contamination levels between residents wearing long-sleeved coats and those wearing short-sleeved scrubs.\n\nIn an effort to reduce the contamination of healthcare uniforms, ASTM International is developing standards to specifically address liquid penetration resistance, liquid repellency, bacterial decontamination, and antimicrobial properties of such uniforms.\n\nWhen used in the laboratory, lab coats protect against accidental spills, e.g., acids. In this case they usually have long sleeves and are made of an absorbent material, such as cotton, so that the user can be protected from the chemical. Some lab coats have buttons or elastic at the end of the sleeves, to secure them around the wrist so that they do not hang into containers of chemicals. Short-sleeved lab coats also exist where protection from substances such as acid is not necessary, and are favoured by certain scientists, such as microbiologists, avoiding the problem of hanging sleeves altogether, combined with the ease of washing the forearms (an important consideration in microbiology).\n\nFor added safety, a variant of the lab coat, called a \"Howie\" style lab coat is often adopted. It is called such after a 1978 report commissioned by the UK department of Health and Social Security to codify standard clinical laboratory practices, chaired by J. W. Howie. Among the codified standards was protective clothing; the type of wrap-around full coverage lab coat that had been in use in the UK for over a hundred years was nicknamed the \"Howie-Style\" coat to indicate its compliance with the provisions of this report. It has the buttons on the left flank, elasticated wrists and a mandarin collar, and is quite similar to a chef's uniform. It is designed to minimize pathogen contact with street clothes.\n\nWhite coats which resemble lab coats are worn by students and teachers of most public primary schools as a daily uniform in countries like Argentina, Uruguay, Spain, Bolivia and Morocco. It also was formerly worn during past decades in Paraguay and Chile.\n\n\n"}
