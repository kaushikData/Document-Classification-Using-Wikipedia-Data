It took place in Tunis, Tunisia. Qatar, after a good performance in 1992, did not send a team to the competition. A total of 42 athletics events were contested, 23 for men and 19 for women.\n\nThe women's 10,000 metres was restored to the programme after a break in 1992. A women's triple jump was contested for the first time. The men's 20 km road race made its third and final appearance at the championships, as junior road events were largely dropped from international competitions. The men's hurdles finals were only recorded to the tenth of a second due to technical limitations. Wind affected parts of the competition, particularly the 200 metres races and the horizontal jumps.\n\nIn line with increased participation, the standard of performers at this event improved. Hadi Soua'an Al-Somaily won a men's hurdles double for Saudi Arabia and won multiple Asian titles as a senior. Ali Hakimi defended his 1500 metres title and added the 800 metres crown; he was an Olympic finalist two years later. Younès Moudrik took the men's long jump title – an event he would win twice at the African Championships in Athletics. Seventeen-year-old Abderrahmane Hammad was runner-up in the high jump but later became the first Arab to win a medal in the high jump at the Olympics.\n\nOn the women's side, Fatma Lanouar won the 800 metres in Tunis and was a two-time Mediterranean Games champion as a senior. The runner-up in that event, 16-year-old Hasna Benhassi of Morocco, had even greater success in her career, which included two Olympic and two World Championships medals. Future African champion Aïda Sellam of Tunisia won the javelin throw and a shot put bronze medal on home turf. The winner of the women's walk, Nagwa Ibrahim Ali, would become a prominent athlete in her discipline regionally, with three African titles to her name.\n"}

{"id": "25451514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25451514", "title": "All-weather running track", "text": "All-weather running track\n\nAn all-weather running track is a rubberized artificial running surface for track and field athletics. It provides a consistent surface for competitors to test their athletic ability unencumbered by adverse weather conditions. Historically, various forms of dirt, grass, sand and crushed cinders were used. Many examples of these varieties of track still exist worldwide.\n\nThe proper length of the 1st lane of a competitive running track is . Some tracks are not built to this specification, instead some are legacy to imperial distances like . Prior to rule changes in 1979, distances in Imperial units were still used in the United States. Some facilities build tracks to fit the available space. One of the most notable examples of this is Franklin Field where the 400 meter distance is achieved in lane 5. Olympic tracks in the early 20th century were of other lengths. Each lane of the track could (by IAAF rules should) be as wide as , though the majority of American tracks are built to NFHS high school specifications that allow smaller lanes. The IAAF also specifies a preferred radius for the turns at 37 metres, but allows a range. Major international level meets are conducted and world records are allowed to be set on tracks that are not exactly 37 metres, but do fall in the range.\n\n\nStarting in the late 1950s, artificial surfaces using a combination of rubber and asphalt began to appear. An artificial warm-up track was constructed for the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia. During the 1960s many of these tracks were constructed; examples still exist today. \n\nIn the mid-1960s Tartan tracks, surfaced with a product by 3M. The name \"Tartan\" is a trademark, but many have misused it as a genericized trademark. This process was the first to commercialize a polyurethane surface for running tracks, though originally conceived for horse racing. Many Tartan tracks were installed worldwide, including at many of the top Universities in the United States. Among that list was a Tartan track installed in the Estadio Olímpico Universitario, home of the 1968 Summer Olympics at Mexico City, which were the first global championships to use such a track. Olympic shot put champion Bill Nieder was instrumental in developing the product and selling it for this first use in the Olympics. An all-weather surface has become standard ever since. \n\nAnother Tartan track was installed on a temporary basis for the 1968 United States Olympic Trials held at altitude at Echo Summit, California, before being moved to South Tahoe Middle School, where it survived for almost 40 years. An original Tartan track is still in place at \"Speed City\" San Jose State University on a satellite to the campus at 10th Street and Alma. Years of the abuse of tractors tearing it and cars parked on it shows the durability of this original product.\n\nSurfacing tracks has become an industry with many competitors.\n\n\nAnd there are other techniques that distribute small chunks of rubber then adhere them in place with various Polyurethane or latex substances.\n\nThe International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), international governing body of the sport, publishes very specific regulations for the conduct of a Global Championship or International level track meet (which is their jurisdiction of the sport).\n\nSince the early 1980s, the manufacturer of the surfaces selected for most championship meets has been the Italian company, Mondo, again the trademarked brand name becoming misused as a genericized trademark. Mondo's track surface is called Mondotrack. The surface differs from the particles stuck in adhesion techniques, in that they are more of a rubber carpet, cut to size then tightly seamed together (in the linear direction along the lane lines). This form of construction gives a more consistent bounce (or energy return) and traction. Because of the tight fit specifications required for manufacture, construction surrounding these sites also has to be of a higher standard, making a Mondotrack one of the most expensive systems to use. Examples of Mondotracks were used for the 1996 Summer Olympics (since removed from the Centennial Olympic Stadium) in Atlanta, Georgia, United States; 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece; 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China; 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\nAnother player in the marketplace is BASF-owned Conica, which can boast the 2009 World Championships in Athletics in Berlin, Germany (where Usain Bolt improved his 100 meters and 200 meters world records), along with other record hosting venues like Stadio Olimpico in Rome, Italy \n\n\n"}

The movie was based on an original idea by Busy Philipps and she \"fleshed out the screenplay.\" However, Jeff and Craig Cox dropped her name from the script. The movie was produced by MTV Films, Red Hour and Smart Entertainment and released on March 30, 2007, by DreamWorks Pictures.\n\nAt the 2002 World Winter Sport Games, rival men's singles skaters Chazz Michael Michaels, a skillful skater but raunchy sex addict, and Jimmy MacElroy, an equally talented but sheltered and effeminate skater, tie for gold. While standing on the awards podium, the two have an argument that escalates into a fight and ends with the World Games mascot being accidentally set on fire. As a result, the National Figure Skating Association strips both men of their medals and bans them from men's singles competition for life. Jimmy's competitive adoptive father, billionaire Darren MacElroy, immediately disowns him and leaves him stranded on the side of the road.\n\nThree and a half years later, both men have grudgingly taken on alternative occupations: Jimmy is working at a winter sporting goods store. He gets demoted to stockroom duty when he refuses to listen to a little girl when she tells him her skating boot has been tied too tightly. Chazz plays the role of \"The Evil Wizard\" in a children's skating show called \"Grublets On Ice\", until he is fired for ruining the show by being in a drunken stupor on stage. \n\nJimmy's obsessive stalker, Hector, tells him of a loophole in the ban allowing him to compete in pair skating. In hopes of entering the upcoming World Winter Sport Games, Jimmy contacts his old coach, Robert, but is unable to find a partner. Jimmy's search for a last-minute partner leads him to Chazz, and Robert convinces the two to skate as the first-ever same-sex pairs team, because the regulations fail to state the genders of the pairs.\n\nRobert informs them that to win, they will need to get along and perform an element that has never been performed successfully: The \"Iron Lotus\", an extremely complicated maneuver that Robert developed years ago. However, it is also dangerous: the only attempt of the maneuver was \"behind the Bamboo Curtain\" in North Korea, and resulted in the man decapitating the woman with his skate blade. Nonetheless, they decide to attempt it as Robert is convinced that two males would be better suited for the move because of the physics of a same-sex team. In the meantime, brother and sister competitors Stranz Van Waldenberg, and Fairchild Van Waldenberg are worried that their spot as the top team is threatened when Jimmy and Chaz perform well at a Winter Sports Games qualifier, command Katie Van Waldenberg, their younger sister, to disrupt the duo by going out with Jimmy and then having sex with Chazz. \n\nSince Katie has fallen in love with Jimmy after going on a date with him, her elder siblings threaten to harm him if she does not comply. Katie gets Chazz's attention after attending a sex addict's meeting as the newest member, then invites Chazz to her room, and tries to seduce him. Chazz refuses out of respect for Jimmy, delighting Katie, but cannot resist grabbing her breasts. Jimmy witnesses this and is outraged at Chazz's and Katie's betrayals. Chazz attempts numerous times to apologize to Jimmy, but is unsuccessful.\n\nIn an attempt to sabotage the performance the following day, Stranz and Fairchild kidnap both Chazz and Jimmy, but both are able to escape. Chazz and Jimmy arrive in the ice rink just in time to compete, where they reconcile quickly and begin their routine. Fairchild, seeing the two doing well, throws pearls onto the ice, causing Chazz to trip and break his ankle, rendering him unable to perform his role in the Iron Lotus. Jimmy then offers to switch places with him. \n\nAlthough they have never practiced the other's roles, they perform it perfectly, winning the competition. Jimmy reconciles with Katie, and Stranz and Fairchild are arrested due to the kidnappings and Stranz accidentally shooting a mascot. Stranz and Fairchild begin arguing, then kiss each other incestuously before they are handcuffed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Jimmy and Chazz receive the gold medal and fly off into the sky via rockets on their skates. During the credits, Hector is seen playing with dolls of himself, Jimmy and Chazz.\n\n\nThe film's cast and crew includes dozens of people with backgrounds in skating:\n\nThe movie was based on Busy Philipps' idea and she worked on the screenplay. However, in an oral history about the movie for Nerdist, Craig Cox fully attributed the idea of Blades of Glory to his Jeff Cox. The oral history has since been updated with information about Philipps' contributions. \n\nAll of the scenes at the National Figure Skating Championships and World Wintersport Games were shot at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. The stadium used for the outside shoots is the unique Montreal Olympic Stadium, built for the 1976 Olympics. The outdoor chase scenes were also shot on-location in Montreal. The building used for athlete housing in Montreal was the unique Habitat 67, built for Expo 67. The film was delayed for a small undetermined period of time when Jon Heder broke his ankle while doing a skating program for the film.\n\n\"Blades of Glory\" grossed $118.2 million in the U.S. and Canada and $26.3 million in other territories, for a total of $145.7 million.\n\nThe film grossed $33 million on its opening weekend on March 30–April 1, 2007, with 3,372 theaters, averaging $9,790 per screen, beating out Disney's \"Meet the Robinsons\" to be the number 1 film. It made $22.5 million in its second weekend, losing only 32% of its audience and retaining the Number 1 spot.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 70%, based on 183 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Thanks to the spirited performances of a talented cast - particularly Will Ferrell and Jon Heder as rivals-turned-teammates -- Blades of Glory successfully spoofs inspirational sports dramas with inspired abandon.\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 64 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n\"The Monthly\" critic Luke Davies accepted the film as a fun romp, comparing it to Will Ferrell's previous movies \"\" and \"\" and wrote positively of Ferrell's performance, describing that \"there is a parodic exhilaration to everything Ferrell does; there's always the sense that any scene is precariously close to being a blooper reel.\" However, Davies conceded that, like the other two films, the plot was \"formulaic ... [with] an obviousness to the set-ups, a no-nonsense compression, a sometimes clunky transition from one sequence to the next\" but that it was the film's ability to \"venture to fantastically absurd places – to set aside the rapid and hokey forward movement – and there to idle in neutral, in zones of pure comic exploration\" and offer \"moments of expansive hilarity ... that made the films worthwhile.\"\n\nThe film was released on DVD and HD DVD on August 7, 2007, and released on Blu-ray Disc on May 20, 2008.\n\n\n"}

These people, generally speaking, are free to entertain offers from all other teams and to decide with whom to sign a contract.\n\nThe specific rules of restricted free agency vary among the major professional sports, but in principle it means that a player is currently signed to one team but is free to solicit contract offers from other teams; however, this player cannot sign with the competing club if the current club matches (or in some leagues, comes within 10% of) the terms of the offered contract. For a restricted free agent, some leagues require the competing team to offer to the original team one or more draft picks, when an offer is not matched, as compensation for losing the player.\n\nPlayers who are not drafted in a league's annual draft of amateur players are considered to be unrestricted free agents and are free to sign contracts with any team. In most North American professional sports, players are drafted by sequencing each team from worst to best (according to the teams' immediately preceding season record, sometimes invoking a draft lottery factor to avoid having teams intentionally lose their last games to gain higher draft position) and allowing said teams to claim rights to the top players entering the league that year. Players that pass through an entire draft (usually several rounds) without being selected by any of the league's teams become unrestricted free agents, and these players are sometimes identified simply as an \"undrafted free agent\" (UDFA) or \"undrafted sportsperson\" and are free to sign with any team they choose. The term \"undrafted free agent\" is most common in the National Football League, where rookies enter directly into the NFL and do not play in a minor league system. It can also occasionally be seen in the National Hockey League, which increasingly uses college hockey as a source; the NHL Entry Draft usually drafts players during high school age (i.e., junior leagues), which allows overlooked players who excel at the college level or in European professional leagues to bypass the draft and sign directly with the NHL.\n\nIn the European Union, the 1995 Bosman ruling by the European Court of Justice established the right of free agency for association football players in all EU member nations. The Bosman ruling has since been extended to cover other professional sports and players from Eastern Europe. Players were still tied to their clubs unless their contract ran out until the Webster ruling allowed players the opportunity to move between nations, though it does not allow free players to move within the national league in which they currently play.\n\nIn professional association football, a free agent is either a player that has been released by a professional association football club and now is no longer affiliated with any club, or a player whose contract with his or her current club has expired and is thus free to join any other club under the terms of the Bosman ruling.\n\nFree agents do not have to be signed during the normal transfer window that is implemented in some countries' leagues. If they are signed by a team, the team signing them does not have to pay any fees – sometimes this is known as \"a free transfer\".\n\nIf a player is released from their club when the transfer window is closed, they cannot sign for another team until the window reopens. A notable case of this being Sol Campbell who in September 2009 was released from Notts County, just after a month from signing on a free transfer. He signed for his former club Arsenal in January 2010 during the winter transfer window, after spending a few months training with the team to maintain his fitness.\n\nThe Australian Football League introduced free agency at the end of 2012.\n\nOut-of-contract players who are not within the top 25% paid players at their club will become unrestricted free agents after eight seasons of service at one club; out-of-contract players who are within the top 25% paid players at their club become restricted free agents after eight seasons, then become unrestricted free agents after ten seasons. Clubs receive compensation in the form of draft picks for the loss of out-of-contract free agents. Players who are delisted will become unrestricted free agents, regardless of length of service; clubs are not compensated for the transfer of such free agents.\n\nFree Agency in the MLB came out of the aftermath of the Flood v. Kuhn Supreme Court case. One of the landmark decisions in the aftermath was the Messersmith/McNally Arbitration also known as the Seitz Decision which effectively destroyed the \"reserve clause\" in baseball. With the destruction of the reserve clause, the players and the league negotiated a new CBA in which was signed on July 12, 1976. It gave players a broader range of options as free agents. \n\nIn Major League Baseball, free agents were previously classified as either Type A, Type B, or unclassified. Type A free agents were those determined by the Collective Bargaining Agreement to be in the top 20% of all players based on the previous two seasons. Type B free agents were those in the \"next\" 20%. Unclassified free agents were those in the bottom 60% of players.\n\nTeams that lost a Type A free agent to whom they had offered arbitration received the top draft pick from the team that signed the free agent, plus a supplemental draft pick in the upcoming draft as compensation. Teams losing Type B free agents to whom they had offered arbitration received only a supplemental pick as compensation.\n\nTeams that have lost unclassified free agents, or who did not offer arbitration to classified free agents, did not receive any compensation.\n\nThe current collective bargaining agreement between MLB and its players union, signed on November 22, 2011 and taking effect with the 2012 season, dramatically changed free agent compensation. Players are no longer classified by type, and if a player has six or more years of major-league service (on the team's 40-man roster) and not under contract for the following season is automatically a free agent. They can offer them an arbitration salary if they want to be able to receive draft pick compensation. The offer must be at least equal to the average of the 125 richest contracts. However, if a player is traded during the final season of his contract, his new team will be ineligible to receive any draft pick compensation. There are more rules than just compensation rules that are included in MLB free agency. One of those rules is that \n\nThe NFL's current free agency system was introduced on March 1, 1993.\n\nExclusive-rights free agents (ERFAs) are players with two or fewer seasons of service time and whose contracts have expired. If their team tenders a qualifying offer (a one-year contract usually at league-minimum salary) the player has no negotiating rights with other teams, and must either sign the tender with the team or sit out the season.\n\nRestricted free agents (RFAs) are players who have three accrued seasons of service and whose contracts have expired. RFAs have received qualifying offers from their old clubs and are free to negotiate with any club until a deadline which occurs approximately a week prior to the NFL Draft (for the deadline was April 15), at which time their rights revert to their original club. If a player accepts an offer from a new club, the old club will have the right to match the offer and retain the player. If the old club elects not to match the offer, it may receive draft-choice compensation depending on the level of the qualifying offer made to the player.\n\nUnrestricted free agents are players with expired contracts that have completed four or more accrued seasons of service. They are free to sign with any franchise.\n\nUndrafted free agents are players eligible for the NFL Draft but who are not selected; they can negotiate and sign with any team.\n\nPlan B free agency was a type of free agency that became active in the National Football League in February 1989 to 1992. Plan B free agency permitted all teams in the NFL to preserve limited rights of no more than 37 total players a season; if a player was a protected Plan B free agent, he was incapable of signing with another team without providing his old team the first opportunity to sign him again. The rest of the players were left unprotected, liberated to negotiate contracts with the rest of the teams in the league.\n\nEight players sued the NFL in U.S. federal court, stating that Plan B was an unlawful restraint of trade. In 1992, a jury found that Plan B violated antitrust laws and awarded damages to these players.\n\nIn the NHL, between 2005 and 2008, the age of unrestricted free agency declined from 31 to 27. As of 2008, any player who is at least 27 years old or has at least seven years of service as an NHL player, and whose contract has expired, will become an unrestricted free agent. On July 1 of each year the free agency period begins, and unrestricted free agents are free to negotiate and sign contracts with any team. Under the old collective agreement, which expired in 2004, draft picks were awarded as compensation when a team lost an unrestricted free agent; however, under the current CBA teams losing unrestricted free agents do not receive any compensation.\n\nIn addition, any player at least 22 years of age who has not been selected in the NHL Draft can sign with any team as a free agent.\n\nAny player who is not entry-level, but does not meet the qualifications of unrestricted free agency becomes a restricted free agent when his contract expires.\n\nThe economics of free agency are disadvantageous for team owners; it can lead to bidding wars—and increased player salaries mean decreased owner profits. Restrictions on free agency have therefore been preferred by North American team owners since the abolition of the reserve clause. For example, a draft can be used to keep young and talented players from generating bidding wars and causing higher player salaries throughout the league. Furthermore, some teams which play in large market cities, and hence have a larger revenue stream, would be able to outbid other teams for talented players. Some leagues, such as the National Football League and the National Basketball Association have imposed salary cap rules in order to avert such bidding wars (the NFL itself was created in an effort to prevent bidding wars that had crippled preceding regional leagues like the Ohio League and Pittsburgh circuit).\n\nIn Europe, the wages of the top players have increased dramatically since the Bosman ruling, although this is partly because of increased television revenues. As in North America, the number of transfers involving a fee are on the decline since clubs can wait for players to finish their contracts and become unrestricted. Also in Major League Baseball the larger and more successful teams often trump the lesser income teams from lack of a salary cap.\n\nIn some leagues, free agency has deadlines. For example, under the most recent NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement, restricted free agents who do not sign contracts by December 1 of a given year will be ineligible to play in the National Hockey League for the balance of that season. However, other leagues (such as the National Basketball Association) have no such restrictions.\n\nIn Europe, players can only move during transfer windows—during the close season and halfway through the league season. There are exceptions for unsigned professional players in the lower divisions.\n"}

It honors players and contributors to the sport of tennis and includes a museum, grass tennis courts, an indoor tennis facility, and a court tennis (or real tennis) facility.\n\nThe hall of fame and museum are located in the Newport Casino, which was commissioned in 1879 by James Gordon Bennett, Jr. as an exclusive resort for wealthy Newport summer residents, and was designed by Charles McKim along with Stanford White, who did the interiors. In 1881, the Real Tennis Court (housing the National Tennis Club) and the Casino Theatre were constructed at the east end of the campus. The club was opened on July 1, 1880 after just a six month construction period and quickly became a fashionable venue for Newport Summer residents. The United States Lawn Tennis Association had held its first championships at the Newport Casino in 1881, an event that would continue through 1914, by which time tennis had become the key attraction at the resort.\n\nHowever, by the 1950s, the retreat was struggling financially and was in danger of being demolished for modern retail space, but the building was purchased and saved by Jimmy Van Alen, a wealthy Newport summer resident and sportsman, and his wife Candy. In 1954, Jimmy Van Alen established the Tennis Hall of Fame and Museum in the Casino. The combination of tennis matches and the museum allowed the building to be saved. It is an example of Victorian Shingle Style architecture.\n\nVan Alen intended the facility to be \"a shrine to the ideals of the game\", and was elected president of the hall in 1957. The International Tennis Hall of Fame was officially sanctioned by the United States Tennis Association on its foundation in 1954, and recognized by the International Tennis Federation in 1986. The first Hall of Fame members were inducted in 1955; as of 2017, there are 252 inductees from 23 countries.\n\nMartina Hingis became the first Global Ambassador for the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nThe current Board of Governors includes former professional tennis players Todd Martin, Stan Smith and Katrina Adams.\n\nThe museum houses a vast collection of artifacts and memorabilia – including videos, photographs, audio recordings, tennis equipment and apparel, trophies, and art – highlighting the history of tennis from its origins up through the modern era. The collection is displayed year-round in the museum's of exhibit space.\n\n\nThe Hall of Fame hosts several tournaments, including the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships. Part of the men's ATP World Tour, the tournament is the only grass court event in North America. Top male players come to Newport directly from Wimbledon to compete for the Van Alen Cup at the International Tennis Hall of Fame. Past champions include Americans John Isner, and Mardy Fish, as well as two-time champion Fabrice Santoro of France.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3457511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3457511", "title": "Interval training", "text": "Interval training\n\nInterval training is a type of training that involves a series of low- to high-intensity workouts interspersed with rest or relief periods. The high-intensity periods are typically at or close to anaerobic exercise, while the recovery periods involve activity of lower intensity. Varying the intensity of effort exercises the heart muscle, providing a cardiovascular workout, improving aerobic capacity and permitting the person to exercise for longer and/or at more intense levels.\n\nInterval training can refer to the organization of any cardiovascular workout (e.g., cycling, running, rowing). It is prominent in training routines for many sports, but is particularly employed by runners.\n\nFartlek training, developed in Sweden, incorporates aspects of interval training with regular distance running. The name means 'speed play', and consists of distance running with \"bursts of harder running at more irregular points, lengths and speeds compared with interval training\". For example, a Fartlek training session might consist of a warm-up for 5–10 minutes; running at a steady, hard speed for 2 km; rapid walking for 5 minutes (recovery); sprints of 50-60s interspersed with easy running; full-speed uphill for 200 m; rapid walking for one minute; repeating this routine until the time schedule has elapsed (a minimum of 45 minutes). The development of aerobic and anaerobic capacities, and the adaptability of Fartlek - to mimic running during specific sports - are characteristics it shares with other types of interval training. \n\n\"Walk-back sprinting\" is one example of interval training for runners, in which one sprints a short distance (anywhere from 100 to 800 metres), then walks back to the starting point (the recovery period), to repeat the sprint a certain number of times. To add challenge to the workout, each of these sprints may start at predetermined time intervals - e.g. 200 metre sprint, walk back, and sprint again, every 3 minutes. The time interval is intended to provide just enough recovery time. A runner will use this method of training mainly to add speed to their race and give them a finishing kick.\n\nHigh-intensity interval training attempts to decrease the overall volume of training by increasing the effort expended during the high-intensity intervals. The acronym DIRT is sometimes used to denote the variables : D = Distance of each speed interval, I = Interval of recovery between speed intervals, R = Repetitions of speed intervals, and T = Time of each.\n\nSome experts believe aerobic interval training may benefit exercisers by allowing them to burn more calories in a shorter period, and by improving aerobic capability at a faster rate, when compared with continuous-intensity exercise. In overweight and obese individuals, high intensity interval training employing 4 sets of 4-minute intervals has been shown to improve VO2max to a greater extent than isocaloric moderate continuous training, as well as to a greater extent than with a protocol using shorter, 1-minute intervals \nSome exercisers find interval training less monotonous than continuous-intensity exercise. A number of studies confirm that in young and healthy individuals, sprint interval training appears to be as effective as continuous endurance training of moderate intensity, and has the benefit of requiring a reduced time commitment. There is some evidence that interval training is also beneficial for older individuals and for those with coronary artery disease, but further study is required.\n\nInterval training can improve many aspects of human physiology. In athletes, it can enhance lactate threshold and increase VO2max. Lactate threshold has been shown to be a significant factor in determining performance for long distance running events. An increase in an athlete's VO2max allows them to intake more oxygen while exercising, enhancing the capability to sustain larger spans of aerobic effort. Studies have also shown interval training can induce endurance-like adaptions, corresponding to increased capacity for whole body and skeletal muscle lipid oxidation and enhanced peripheral vascular structure and function.\n\nThere is increasing evidence that interval training assists in managing risk factors of many diseases, including metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes. It does this by improving insulin action and sensitivity. Generating higher insulin sensitivity results in lower levels of insulin needed to lower glucose levels in the blood. This helps individuals with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome control their glucose levels. A combination of interval training and continuous exercise increases cardiovascular fitness and raises HDL-cholesterol, which reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThis method of training may be more effective at inducing fat loss than simply training at a moderate intensity for the same duration. This is due to the metabolism-boosting effects of high intensity intervals.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6062252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6062252", "title": "NASCAR on television and radio", "text": "NASCAR on television and radio\n\nThe television and radio rights to broadcast NASCAR on television and radio are one of the most expensive rights of any American sport, with the current television contract with Fox Sports and NBC Sports being worth around .\n\nIn the early days of the sport, sports programs like CBS Sports Spectacular and ABC Wide World of Sports would air video highlight packages of NASCAR races. These packages were typically 15 to 30 minutes long that were cut from film of the entire race. This is similar to video packages created by NFL Films. For major races, like the Daytona 500, ABC Sports would show it live for a certain number of laps at the beginning and come back to it to show the end of the race. There had been a few races shown in their entirety in the 1970s, but these were always recorded and shown days or weeks later.\n\nIn 1979, CBS Sports televised the entire 1979 Daytona 500 live from start to finish. When ESPN came along in 1981, more races began being shown live in their entirety. Since 1992, all NASCAR races have been shown from start to finish, and all have been shown live since 1997. Until 2001, race tracks struck individual agreements with networks to broadcast races, but NASCAR wanted to capitalize on the growing popularity of the sport and announced in 1999 that television contracts would now be centralized; that is, instead of making agreements with individual tracks, networks would now negotiate directly with NASCAR for the rights to air a package of races.\n\n\nOne of the earliest telecasts of a NASCAR race was the 1960 Daytona 500, parts of which was presented as part of \"CBS Sports Spectacular\", with announcer Bud Palmer.\n\nIn the ensuing years, but before 1979, there were three main sources of NASCAR telecasts:\n\nThe following table is a list of races from NASCAR's top three series that have been broadcast partially or in their entirety on television during the 1960s.\n\nCBS Sports President Neal Pilson and motor-sports editor Ken Squier believed that America would watch an entire stock car race live on television. On February 18, 1979, CBS presented the first flag-to-flag coverage of the Daytona 500. Richard Petty won NASCAR's crown-jewel race for the sixth time, but the big story was the post-race fight on the track's infield between Cale Yarborough and Donnie Allison, who crashed together on the final lap while leading. The race drew incredible ratings, in part due to the compelling action both on and off the track, and in part because a major snowstorm on the East Coast kept millions of viewers indoors.\n\nAs time passed, more Winston Cup races ended up on TV. ESPN broadcast its first race in 1981, from North Carolina Motor Speedway (its first live race was later in the year at Atlanta International Raceway), and TNN followed in 1991. All Cup races were nationally televised by 1985; networks struck individual deals with track owners, and multiple channels carried racing action. Many races were shown taped and edited on \"Wide World of Sports\" and syndication services like Mizlou and SETN, but almost all races were live by 1989. By 2000, the last year of this arrangement, six networks televised at least one Cup series race: CBS, ABC, ESPN, TNN, TBS, and NBC.\n\nAlso, a growing number of races in the Busch Grand National Series and Craftsman Truck Series were made available for broadcast, and some track owners even threw in support races in lesser series. Likewise, Winston Cup qualifying aired on regional sports network Prime Network.\n\nNASCAR wanted to capitalize on its increased popularity even more, so they decided that future deals would be centralized; that is, the networks would negotiate directly with NASCAR for a regular schedule of telecasts.\n\nOn December 15, 1999 Fox Sports, FX, NBC and Turner Sports agreed to pay $2.4 billion for a new six-year television package, covering the Winston/Nextel Cup Series and Busch Series schedules.\n\n\nESPN retained the rights to the Craftsman Truck Series through 2002 under a separate contract. Beginning in 2003, Speed Channel bought out the rest of ESPN's contract and became the exclusive broadcast home of that series.\n\nInitially, practice and qualifying sessions would alter between Fox Sports Net and FX during the Fox/FX portion of the season and between TNT and CNNSI during the NBC/TNT portion of the season. By the end of 2002, Speed had replaced Fox Sports Net and, due to CNN/SI shutting down in the spring of 2002, a deal was arranged with NBC/TNT to move most practice and qualifying sessions to Speed as well using NBC/TNT's production team and Speed graphics.\n\nThe centralized TV deal caused consternation among many longtime NASCAR fans. The biggest criticisms include an increase in commercial breaks, emphasis on the more popular drivers and teams to the exclusion of others, and the de-emphasis of actual racing coverage in exchange for more fluff and hype.\n\nLate in 2005, NBC announced that they no longer wanted to carry NASCAR races on their schedule. ABC/ESPN took the opportunity to regain the series. On December 12, 2005, NASCAR announced its next TV contract: eight years, $4.8 billion with Fox/Speed Channel, ABC/ESPN, and TNT. This time, the deal bundled the Camping World Truck Series in with the Sprint Cup and Nationwide series:\n\nNBC and FX no longer carried NASCAR as a result. NBC was paying $2.8 billion for six years of Sunday night telecasts of the National Football League starting in 2006. Both the new NFL and old NASCAR deals overlapped in 2006, which forced some postrace coverage at NBC races to air on CNBC. FX stopped airing sporting events from 2006 to 2010. (It did show the ninth inning of a rain-delayed Fox game between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox when it conflicted with the start of the 2008 Subway Fresh Fit 500, as well as other games which overran into the starts of NASCAR races. Beginning in 2010, Fox's MLB games during NASCAR Saturdays were shifted to early in the afternoon.)\n\nThe new contracts increased the amount of coverage from each weekend's races. When the 2007 season began, all practices for NASCAR Cup Series races were televised, whereas only the final practice (\"happy hour\") was carried before. In addition, all Nationwide Series final practices and qualifying sessions were also shown; before, a few qualifying sessions were not seen and only a handful of practices were seen. Most, if not all, truck series time trials are also broadcast.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2010, average race viewership fell from 7.85 million at its height to 5.99 million in 2010, according to the \"Sports Business Journal\".\n\nIn August 2013, Speed was replaced by Fox Sports 1, and Fuel TV by Fox Sports 2. Camping World Truck Series races remained on Fox Sports 1, while practice/qualifying sessions and regional series races alternated between Fox Sports 1 and 2 depending on scheduling. For North American markets outside of the United States, coverage of some NASCAR events carried by Speed at the time remained on an international version of Speed (now Fox Sports Racing) that operates in the regions.\n\nIn 2014, the Sprint Unlimited moved to Fox Sports 1. Also, owing to the increased viewership of qualifying sessions under the new \"group\" knockout format, and being the first restrictor plate race under the new system, coverage of qualifying for that year's Aaron's 499 was moved to Fox, marking the only other race besides the Daytona 500 to have a qualifying round televised on broadcast television.\n\nThe broadcast teams for each package are as follows:\n\nBill Weber was forced to leave TNT shortly before the 4th race of TNT's schedule. Officially, Turner says it was due to a personal matter; however USA Today reported that it was due to an incident at a hotel the night before the race. Ralph Sheheen stepped in as announcer for the last 3 races on TNT in 2009. Adam Alexander filled in on pit road for the last 2 races, before moving to the announcer booth for 2010 and beyond. Sheheen returned to pit road, where he remains today. The NASCAR on TNT Live show has been discontinued and morphed into an hour-long Countdown to Green which is hosted by Alexander.\n\nOn October 15, 2012, NASCAR and the Fox Sports Media Group (FSMG) announced a new $2.4 billion eight-year deal, a 30% increase from their previous deal. On July 23, 2013, NASCAR and the NBC Sports Group announced a new $4.4 billion ten-year deal. Ten days later on August 1, 2013, NASCAR and Fox extended and expanded their agreement, paying an additional $1.4 billion to do so, to complete NASCAR's new TV package through the 2024 season. NBC reportedly bid over 50% more than ESPN and Turner for their portion of the package, despite Turner and ESPN expressing interest about continuing their relationship with NASCAR.\n\n\n\n\nESPN and TNT will no longer broadcast NASCAR for the foreseeable future. The new contract succeeded a partnership with Turner Sports and ESPN which it was paid by $4.8 billion that was covered by the previous contract which was eight years that began in 2007.\n\nBelow is a table (1988-present) of each race and the network upon which it was broadcast (Note: this reflects the networks upon which each race was predominantly shown, and does not reflect in-race movements and pre-emptions due to time constraints or other commitments):\n\nCurrently, two separate networks cover NASCAR races on radio:\n\nFrom 2002—2006, all races were heard on XM channel 90 across the continental United States. In 2007, national satellite radio rights moved to Sirius channel 90. Among the programs on \"Sirius NASCAR Radio\" are a weekly program co-hosted by TV pit reporter Matt Yocum and Tony Stewart, and a morning drive time show formerly hosted by David Poole of \"The Charlotte Observer\" and Marty Snider of NBC and TNT. \"The Morning Drive\" is now hosted by MRN turn announcer Mike Bagley and MRN lead writer Pete Pistone. PRN's Jim Noble and Richard Childress Racing museum curator and former fueler Danny \"Chocolate\" Myers host the afternoon show called \"Tradin Paint.\" Longtime MRN turn announcer Dave Moody hosts \"SiriusXM Speedway\". PRN pit reporter and turn announcer Brad Gillie co-hosts the \"Late Shift\" with Kenny Wallace. He's also the regular host of the weekend show \"Press Pass\". Pat Patterson, also PRN turn announcer, hosts the weekend show \"The Frontstretch\".\n\nFollowing the merger of XM and Sirius, \"Sirius NASCAR Radio\" is heard on the XM through the \"Best of Sirius\" package on channel 90.\n\nBoth networks also have affiliation deals with hundreds of local radio stations. Many stations sign with more than one of these networks to ensure coverage of the entire season. However, for Indianapolis, if there is a conflict between the INDYCAR Radio affiliate and the radio station that carries NASCAR races, the INDYCAR Radio affiliate has first choice of carrying the race.\n\nWhile NASCAR does not produce a \"world feed\" broadcast, it does have 23 international broadcast partners. Among them are NTV, TSN, Premier Sports, Motorvision TV, Sportsnet, The Score, Bell TV, Speed Latin America, Fox Sports Latin America, ESPN Middle East, Fox Sports Australia, AB Moteurs, ESPN America, Eurosport, Viasat Motor, Ziggo Sport Totaal, Sport TV, StarHub, Dubai Sports Channel, SNTV, Fox Sports Asia and American Forces Network. Neo Sports in India start broadcasting NASCAR races in March 2010 at Martinsville.\n\nAll international broadcasts are directly taken from the domestic feed. Although the graphics are from NASCAR and without advertising.\n\nThese are the broadcasters for the 2017 NASCAR season:\n"}

{"id": "8484097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8484097", "title": "Opposition to hunting", "text": "Opposition to hunting\n\nOpposition to hunting is espoused by people or groups who object to the practice of hunting, often seeking anti-hunting legislation and sometimes taking on acts of civil disobedience, such as hunt sabotage. Anti-hunting laws, such as the English Hunting Act 2004, are generally distinguishable from conservation legislation like the American Marine Mammal Protection Act by whether they seek to reduce or prevent hunting for perceived cruelty-related reasons or to regulate hunting for conservation, although the boundaries of distinction are sometimes blurred in specific laws, for example when endangered animals are hunted.\n\nThe term \"anti-hunting\" is used to describe opponents of hunting; while it does not appear to be pejorative, it is widely used as such by pro-hunting people. Supporters of hunting contend that opposition is based on emotional reactions to the individual kill which may be eaten by the hunters, and that opponents ignore that modern hunting activities are regulated by scientifically guided legislation resulting thus in improved and increased habitat and growth in the number of individuals of each species that is legally hunted.\n\nIt is difficult to compare strength of anti-hunting sentiment in different countries, for example because the word \"hunting\" carries different meanings in the UK and United States. Nonetheless, it is more possible to compare the strength of the anti-hunting movement in different countries, with some having stronger organization, such as in the UK, and some being nearly without it, such as New Zealand. However, as can be seen in the results table, opinions can vary widely on different surveys even within the same country, and as in all market research, consideration must be given to the wording of the questions, which can influence results.\nThe Burns Inquiry analysis of the opposition to hunting in the UK included social class, sometimes proposed as a differentiating factor between hunting in the UK and hunting in the United States, as one among many anti-hunting concerns. Furthermore, they showed the UK's anti-hunting movement was itself only part of a wider, grassroots opposition to hunting in the UK. The Burns Inquiry reported that:\n\nOpposition to hunting is not new. Victorian era dramatist W. S. Gilbert remarked, \"Deer-stalking would be a very fine sport if only the deer had guns.\"\n\nThe UK government's response to the call for bans on hunting, notably rabbit and hare coursing, has historically been to show its support for the interests of farmers, according to political historian Michael Tichelar. As recently as 2005, one anti-hare coursing organisation referred to coursing supporters as being made up of \"10% Nobs and 90% Yobs\".\n\nAn element of class is absent from the hunting debate in the United States where there are not many obvious class differences in hunting habits. Instead the differences in anti-hunting sentiment relates to urban sprawl and increasing population density. Because of the abundance of public land in the United States, as high as 75% of the land in some states, one need not be wealthy to have access to huntable land in less densely populated areas.\n\nThe democratic perspective on hunting in the United States started as a result of the reaction against English laws restricting game to the crown. This is one of the aspects of American culture which formed as a result of that nation's original high number of enclosure refugees from the UK and Ireland. A further distinction between the context of debate on hunting in the UK and US is that US hunting is generally licensed by government agencies, providing licence fee revenue. In contrast to this, hunting in the UK has broadly required only the permission of the landowner or the owner of sporting rights over the land.\n\n"}

{"id": "7245013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7245013", "title": "Prison handball", "text": "Prison handball\n\nHandball is a popular sport in many North American prisons; typically it is a simplified version of American handball. The popularity of handball in prisons can conceivably be attributed to its ease of play (requiring only two or four players to start a game), availability of suitable areas to play (prison courtyards almost always include at least one brick or cement wall to play off) and the low cost of the racquetball required to play (often supplied by the institution).\n\nEach team has two players. They are alternated in a row facing the playing wall, i.e. from the left you have a player of team one, second to the right is a player of team two, third to the right is the second team one player, and farthest right is the second player of team two.\n\nService is started when the far left player from team one throws the ball to the playing wall. Unlike in standard American rules, the ball is thrown directly to the wall, not requiring a bounce before service. The only requirement of a serve is that it contacts the playing wall before bouncing off the floor. Service must be to the opposing player directly beside the server. (The two center players serve to the outside players). If the serve is faultytoo low or out of boundsthe server is allowed to re-serve.\n\nPlay continues until a player faults. Usually a limit is designated on the wall by a landmark to determine the out of bounds limit. Players can fault by failing to reach the play wall after striking the ball, or by hitting the play wall outside of the boundary. When the ball returns from the play wall, one bounce anywhere in the playing area is allowed before the receiver returns the ball.\n\nOnly the serving team can score a point when the opposing team faults during the rally. If the serving team faults during the rally, the opposing team gains the serve, but no points.\n\nGames are usually played until one team scores 15, this is often lowered when there is a limited amount of time.\n\nSometimes there is a condition that if you receive the ball, and are able to strike an opposing player (without bouncing) on your return strike, your team receives \"two\" points and the serve. This helps to prevent opposing players from standing in front of the receivers.\n\nCommonly fixtures such as sconces, windows, and doors on the playing or side wall are not considered out of bounds. If the ball bounces off this type of feature and continues in a reasonable way play continues. In some cases the feature might cause the ball to go out of bounds or move in a way making unplayable, this is usually grounds for a re-serve.\n\nBecause prison courtyards are often open-air and without any ceiling, or the walls are of limited height, there is the risk of the ball going over the wall. In many cases there exists a rule that any player who sends the ball outside the yard (irretrievable) must do push-ups or some similar punishment.\n\nIn Texas Prisons, while serving, the server must bounce the ball on the ground before hitting it towards the wall. He or she, \"AK\", must serve behind the line, hit the ball above the line on the wall, and make the ball bounce back past the servers line, and on the receivers half of the court. If the server is short, i.e. if the rebounding ball comes short of the serving line or does not reach the opponents half but is within bounds, he gets one additional try. Being short twice awards a point to the receiver, who then has the right to serve. A crack balla ball that bounces in the crack between the two wallsis counted as short on the first, but not on the second serve when the server can serve again. A point must be scored by the serving team, otherwise the serving right passes to the opposing team, the teams swap places and no point is awarded.\n"}

{"id": "1102335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1102335", "title": "Semi-professional", "text": "Semi-professional\n\nA semi-professional athlete is one for whom sport is not a full-time occupation. They are not amateur because they receive regular payment from their team (company), but at a much lower rate than a full-time professional athlete. As a result, players may have (or seek) a second full-time job. A semipro player/team could also be one that represents a place of employment that only the employees are allowed to play on. In this case, it is considered semipro because their employer pays them, but for their regular job, not for playing on the company's team.\n\nWhen applied to vocational tools and equipment, it refers to products that lie between the amateur and professional levels in both quality and cost, though nowadays the term prosumer is often used instead.\n\nThe San Francisco Olympic Club fielded an American football team in 1890. That year, the Olympic Club was accused by a rival club of enticing athletes to jump to its ranks with offers of jobs. An investigation by the Amateur Athletic Union ruled that the Olympics' practice was not actually professionalism but only a \"semi\" form of it, inventing the term \"semi-pro\". Although the Amateur Athletic Union did not like the idea very much, it decided that clubs could indeed offer employment without losing their amateur status or compromising the athlete.\n\nIn North America, semi-professional athletes and teams were far more common in the early and mid-20th century than they are today. There are many benefits, such as collegiate eligibility and the attendant scholarships, in maintaining amateur status (unlike the Amateur Athletic Union, the NCAA forbids any sort of compensation outside of scholarships, including job offers tied to their playing). Eligibility for participation in the Olympics in some sports is still dependent upon maintaining a purely amateur status (although far less so than was previously the case), and such athletes may be supported by government money, business sponsorships, and other systems. At the same time, professional sports have become such a massive and remunerative business that even many low-level feeder teams can afford to have fully professional athletes.\n\nSemi-professionalism is most prevalent in junior ice hockey, in which the top levels of Canadian (and European as well) junior hockey (most of whom are teenagers still in, or just out of, high school) are paid at a semi-professional level. This is not the case in the United States, where college ice hockey dominates at that age group; the junior leagues in the United States generally operate as fully amateur teams to maintain the players' eligibility to play in college.\n\nLower-end minor leagues and more obscure sports often operate at a semi-professional level due to cost concerns. Because the cost of running a fully professional American football team is prohibitive, semi-pro football is common at the adult levels, particularly in the indoor variety, providing an outlet for players who have used up their NCAA eligibility and have no further use for maintaining amateur status; as a sport that normally plays only one game per week, football is especially suited for semi-pro play. The National Lacrosse League, whose teams also typically play only one game per week, pays a salary that is enough to be considered fully professional, but players also are able to pursue outside employment to supplement their income. The lowest levels of organized baseball are also effectively semi-professional, as the short summer seasons and low salaries require players to hold jobs in the offseason to make ends meet.\n\nThere are several hundred semi-professional football teams at non-League level. The bottom division of The Football League (the fourth tier of the English football league system) has traditionally been the cut-off point between professional (\"full-time\") and semi-professional (\"part-time\") in English football. However, many teams in the top non-League competition, the National League have become \"full-time\" professional clubs in an effort to achieve League status.\n\nWomen's football in England is semi-professional at the top levels, as finances depend on promotion and relegation both of parent male teams and of the female teams themselves. Full professionalism for women is still in the planning stages; top female players often depend on other sources of income (such as coaching and physical training), and many attend university or college while playing.\n\nIn Scottish football, semi-professional teams compete at all levels below the Scottish Premiership, with most teams below the Scottish Championship being semi-professional.\n\nHistorically, English rugby league and rugby union have had one full-time professional division, with semi-professional divisions at the next level down. The second tier of union, the RFU Championship, became fully professional beginning with the 2009–10 season.\n"}

{"id": "4112888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4112888", "title": "Stick It", "text": "Stick It\n\nStick It is an American teen comedy-drama film starring Jeff Bridges, Missy Peregrym, and Vanessa Lengies. It was written and directed by Jessica Bendinger, writer of \"Bring It On\"; the film marks her directorial debut. It was produced by Touchstone Pictures and Spyglass Entertainment and was released in theatres on April 28, 2006.\n\nHaley Graham (Missy Peregrym) is a rebellious 17-year-old who has a run-in with the law when she and two friends go biking through a residential construction site. Haley is arrested and forced by a judge to return to the regimented world of competitive gymnastics. Haley was once considered one of the most talented gymnasts in the US. One year earlier, she made it to the World Championships, but she walked out of competition in the middle of the finals, costing the American team the gold medal and leaving many people hurt and crushed, making her one of the most hated people in gymnastics.\n\nHaley goes to the elite Vickerman Gymnastics Academy (VGA) in Houston, her ultimate nightmare, run by legendary coach Burt Vickerman (Jeff Bridges). Haley has a talk with Coach Vickerman, who convinces her to take up the sport once again – at least until she can enter an upcoming invitational competition. Vickerman convinces her that she can use the prize money from the competition to repay some property damage debts she still owes and leave gymnastics once and for all. Disliking the sport's rigid rules and intense training schedule, Haley is reluctant to come out of retirement. Her attitude toward her fellow gymnasts – as well as her past – causes conflicts. After getting the cold shoulder the first day at the gym, Haley realizes what she is up against.\n\nAt the invitational, Haley's talent shines and her return from gymnastics retirement seems for the better. But all is not what it seems in the scoring system. She starts to remember one of the many reasons she retired – the flaws in judging. The panels do not look at the difficulty of the move nor do they look at the technique; they merely take deductions for unimportant minor errors. As Haley says, \"It doesn't matter how well you do. It's how well you follow \"their\" rules.\"\n\nIn addition, Haley is severely stressed by her domineering mother, who has arrived to watch the meet. Her conduct at the World Championship (\"Worlds\") has not been forgotten by the other athletes, and they treat her with open hostility. Haley finally breaks down in the middle of her balance beam routine and, in a repeat of the World Championships, leaves the arena before completing the competition. Before she leaves, she reveals to Vickerman the reason she walked out of Worlds: she had just discovered that her mother was having an affair with her then-coach, and her parents got divorced as a result.\n\nHaley then goes back to the judge who sentenced her to the gymnastics academy to inform her that she has dropped out and wants to be sent to either a juvenile hall or military academy. But the judge tells Haley that someone (obviously Vickerman) had just paid off all of her debt for the property damages in her incident with the law, that she is no longer under any legal issues, and that having jerks for parents doesn't need to ruin her life. Haley then approaches Vickerman, who confirms it by claiming that he used the money that her father had paid him for her gymnastics training. Vickerman persuades Haley to remain with the academy a while longer so she can continue with her training to reach Nationals.\n\nAlthough she did not complete the invitational, Haley continues to train and, with three of her teammates Mina (Maddy Curley), Wei Wei (Nikki SooHoo) and Joanne (Vanessa Lengies), qualifies for the National Championships. The biased judging leaves her far back in the all-around standings, but this does not keep her out of the event finals. In the first event final, vault, Mina executes an extremely difficult maneuver perfectly but receives a low score (9.500 out of 10). When Vickerman questions the judges, he learns that Mina was penalized on the technicality of showing a bra strap. Haley is next up. However, instead of vaulting, she shows her bra strap to the judges and forfeits her turn in disgust (otherwise known as a \"scratch\"). One by one, the other gymnasts follow suit, earning a string of zeroes and forcing the judges to award Mina the vault gold medal anyway.\n\nHaley's bold action sparks a movement. The gymnasts talk among themselves and realize that if they could choose the winner, the judging would be fair. They convince all the others in the competition to do the same, choosing one person from each event who they, by consensus, deem the best to be the \"winner\". The winner completes her routine; the others jump on and off the apparatus and scratch. It seems the movement will be ruined when Tricia Skilken, a longtime judges' favorite and Haley's former teammate and best friend, arrives and threatens the choice of winners by competing herself. Trisha finally comes to her senses, though, and realizes that scratching is for the good of the competition to make a point.\n\nWhat started out as a gymnastics competition turns into a small revolution for the rules and Haley. Her talents are recognized once more and her future seems to be set with numerous colleges offering her athletic scholarships to compete in NCAA gymnastics.\n\n\nDoubles\n\nCameos\n\n\nThe movie also features brief pieces of other songs, which were not included in the soundtrack, including Green Day's \"Brain Stew\" and \"Holiday\", My Morning Jacket's \"One Big Holiday\", and Fall Out Boy's \"Our Lawyer Made Us Change The Name Of This Song So We Wouldn't Get Sued\" and \"I Slept With Someone in Fall Out Boy and All I Got Was this Stupid Song Written About Me\".\n\n\"Stick It\" was released on April 28, 2006 and grossed $10,803,610 in the opening weekend. The movie grossed $26,910,736 total in the domestic market and $5,066,112 internationally for a total of $31,976,848 after 13 weeks at the box office. The film had the highest per screen average on its opening weekend with 2,038 movie theaters, making an average of $5,301 per screen.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes it has a score of 31%, based on 100 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. On Metacritic it has a score of 52 out 100, based on reviews from 25 critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave it a grade B+.\n\nCritic Nathan Lee of the \"New York Times\" gave the film a positive review stating, \"A spry teenage comedy that gets everything right, 'Stick It' takes the usual batch of underdogs, dirt bags, mean girls and bimbos and sends them somersaulting through happy clichés and unexpected invention.\" \n\n\n"}
