The champions were the Boston Americans (now the Boston Red Sox), who repeated their 1903 AL championship, and the NL's New York Giants (now the San Francisco Giants).\n\nDue to a business rivalry between the two leagues, especially in New York, and to personal animosity between Giants manager John McGraw and American League president Ban Johnson, the Giants declined to meet the champions of the \"junior\" (or \"minor\") league. McGraw said his Giants were already the world champions because they were the champions of the \"only real major league\".\n\nDuring spring training in March 1904, Giants owner John T. Brush said \"there will never be a series\" between \nthe New York-based teams—his Giants of the National League and the American League's New York Highlanders—in response to a preseason offer from Highlanders co-owner Frank J. Farrell. In July 1904, as reported in \"Sporting Life\", Brush stated that his NL club would not play the AL club \"if each wins the pennant in its respective league\", in contradiction of a preseason agreement for a championship series between the leagues. At that point in the season, the Giants were comfortably on top of the NL standings, and the Highlanders (now the New York Yankees) were just games behind the Boston Americans. The AL race went down to the wire, and the Highlanders temporarily took over first place on October 7 when they defeated Boston. But the Americans won three of their four remaining games to clinch the AL pennant, and finished games ahead of the Highlanders (who lost three of their final four games) in the final standings of October 10. The Giants, who had won the NL by a wide margin (13 games), stuck to and broadened their plan, refusing to play \"any\" AL club, either the champion Boston team or the crosstown New York team, in the proposed \"exhibition\" series (as they considered it).\n\nBoston had defeated National League champion Pittsburgh in the 1903 World Series, a contest arranged by the two champion clubs, not by the leagues themselves.\n\nThe Giants maintained that the rules for the World Series were haphazardly defined. In the 1903 series, as well as postseason series between the National League and the American Association in the 1880s, the rules for a given season's \"World's Championship Series\" had been whatever the two participating clubs had agreed upon. The World Series was not a compulsory event and was not governed by an authoritative body, thus the Giants were free to refuse to participate in such an event.\n\nStung by criticism from fans and writers, Brush drafted rules that both leagues adopted in mid-February 1905. The rules compelled the two winning clubs to participate and governed the annual determination of sites, dates, ticket prices and division of receipts. These new rules essentially made the World Series the premier annual Major League Baseball event.\n\nBoston slumped in 1905, while New York repeated its NL championship and won the 1905 World Series against the Philadelphia Athletics. The two teams eventually met in the 1912 World Series with the Red Sox winning in seven games. The Series has been played every year since except , when a 232-day players' strike ended the season in mid-August.\n\n"}

{"id": "8600277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8600277", "title": "1950s Topps", "text": "1950s Topps\n\nTopps joined the sports cards market in the 1950s becoming a rival to Bowman. After competing with each other for five years Topps bought out Bowman in 1956. Competition still remained however, in the form of Parkhurst hockey cards. Topps produced cards of the United States-based National Hockey League teams while Parkhurst covered the Canadian teams. Topps had produced multi-sport photo cards prior to 1950, namely the 1948 Topps Magic Photos but each set was very small and not considered a major set. This trend was consistent with their first baseball and college football issues: the 1950 Feltbacks resembled college pennants; 1951 Magic football included a scratch-off game on the reverse; Red/Blue Backs intended to be a card game; Connie Mack/Current All-Stars are foldable stand-ups. It was in 1952 that Topps released their first truly major card set. In the autumn of 1951, Woody Gelman and Sy Berger, then a 28-year-old veteran of World War II, designed the 1952 Topps baseball card set on the kitchen table of Berger's apartment on Alabama Avenue in Brooklyn. \nThe 1957 Topps set featured dimensions of 2½ by 3½ inches which has become known as the standard card size. Below is a list with brief descriptions of Topps trading card products for the 1950s.\n\n Pack type(card quantity)<br> # indicates varying quantity\n\nBeginning in 1959, Topps began permitting the printing of cards by a printer (Benco) in Venezuela on account of it being a viable baseball market. The most significant difference from the U.S. issue was the card stock quality used for the Venezuelan cards. Two distinctly different card stocks were used (one with gray backs, the other with cream backs), and both were of much lower grade. Cards from this set have a duller finish on the front due to no gloss being applied. Approximately half of the set has a copyright designation which states the card was printed in the US, while the other half state 'Impreso en Venezuela por Benco CA'. The 1959 Venezuelan set features cards 1-198 from their U.S. counterpart. (It has been long believed that the set consisted of only 196 cards, however, it has been found to have been incorrectly documented for years with card #198 having been validated by independent third-party agency PSA as being from the set). Size: 2.5 × 3.5 inches.\n\nTopps' first basketball issue was released for 1957-58. The set has 80 cards of NBA players and was issued in 5-cent packs. Over half the set is rookies with 47. There were also 22 cards in the set that were double printed. The player's name and team appear in the lower portion of the photo in adjacent long and short trapezoid shaped bars respectively. The backs offer biographical player data with year and career statistics. Also on the backs, the card number appears on a backboard style design and a drawing of a player standing in front of a ruler indicates the player's height. After this issue, Topps did not release another basketball set until 1969. Size: 2.5 × 3.5 in.\n\n\nThe players in these sets are from the four U.S. based teams of the NHL. Bilingual backs(English/French) feature previous season statistics, a short player biography and a cartoon question and answer section.\n\n\n\n\n1951 Topps Ringside\n\nTopps' only boxing issue came out in 1951 and was called 'Ringside'. The set featured current and former boxing stars as well as wrestlers. The set totals 96 color cards with biographical information on the back. Some of the cards depicted a championship belt above the athlete's name indicating their weight class and year(s) they held the title.\n\n1955 Hocus Focus\nThe second issue of Magic Photos came in 1955. This set included 23 baseball players and a number of other series covering several topical areas. Size: ×  inches\n\n1956 Hocus Focus\nThis set was similar in that it was a series of subsets featuring various sports and non-sport subjects. Among them are aircraft, buildings, world leaders, actors, submarines, automobiles, and famous landmarks. Size: ×  in (2.2 × 3.7 cm)\n\nThe sets listed below cover a variety of subject matter from Television and Movie personalities to Cars and Planes. Topps' offerings for non-sport sets were not limited to cards. A number of the issues were tattoos, stamps, coins and the well known Bazooka Joe and Archie Comics. Set information is listed here by Year, Set Name, Quantity of Cards(#), and the card's Dimensions in inches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1029280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1029280", "title": "Albert Henry Baskerville", "text": "Albert Henry Baskerville\n\nAlbert (Bert) Henry Baskerville (born as \"Baskiville\") (15 January 1883 – 20 May 1908) was a Wellington postal clerk, a rugby union forward, author of the book \"Modern Rugby Football: New Zealand Methods; Points for the Beginner, the Player, the Spectator\" and a pioneer of rugby league.\n\nPrior to becoming the administrator of the 1908 tour Baskerville played rugby for the Oriental club in Wellington and was said to be on the verge of provincial selection. His father had been killed in 1903 and Bert had been the main income earner for the family since then. His book, \"Modern Rugby Football: New Zealand Methods; Points for the Beginner, the Player, the Spectator\", was published in 1907 and gave him somewhat of a national profile. After the success of this project he moved on to his next ambitious idea, a professional rugby tour of Great Britain.\n\nBaskerville wrote to the Northern Union and asked if they would host a touring party of New Zealand rugby players. The Northern Union were excited by this proposal and quickly agreed. After this Baskerville began to work on organising the tour full-time, leaving his job at the Postal Department and severing his connection with the Oriental Football Club. The Wellington Rugby Union moved quickly to attempt to stop him from attending their grounds and he received a life ban from the New Zealand Rugby Union. Despite this he managed to put together an impressive touring party that included eight All Blacks, including four from the 1905 tour of Great Britain. The team was dubbed the All Golds by the Sydney press, a derogatory play on the New Zealand rugby union team's nickname the All Blacks.\n\nThe tour was a great success both financially, each player earned roughly £300, and on the field, where the touring side won consecutive Test series against Great Britain and Australia. For most of the tour Baskerville was busy with the administration work and it was not until the final game of the British leg, against St Helens R.F.C., that Baskerville played, scoring a try. On arriving in Australia he then played in the first ever trans-Tasman test which was the debut match of the Australia national rugby league team, again scoring a try. Tragically that was to be the only time that Baskerville would represent New Zealand in a Test match. Baskerville contracted pneumonia on the ship taking the touring party from Sydney to Brisbane and, after several days in hospital, died aged 25 in Brisbane, Australia on 20 May 1908. His body was taken by manager Harry Palmer and a group of players from each province back to Wellington. The rest of the touring party stayed in Australia to complete their remaining fixtures. Like five other members of the touring party Baskerville is buried at Karori Cemetery.\n\nOn their return from Australia the remaining members of the tour party held a memorial game, the first game of rugby league in New Zealand, and raised £300 for his widowed mother.\n\nThe Courtney Goodwill Trophy, international rugby league′s first, was presented for the first time in 1936 and depicted Baskiville, along with other pioneering greats of the code, Jean Galia (France), James Lomas (England) and Dally Messenger (Australia).\n\nHe is commemorated by the naming of the Baskerville Shield, the trophy awarded when Great Britain and New Zealand meet in test series. In 2001 Baskerville was inducted as one of the NZRL Legends of League.\n\n\n"}

Thus, they are usually able to use their bats to make contact with the ball (hence the name \"contact\" hitter) to put it in play, and then run fast to reach base. As a result of their focus on putting the ball in play, they usually have fewer home runs than power hitters.\n\nTony Gwynn is the leading example of a modern contact hitter. Although he had 135 career home runs, Gwynn accurately described himself as a contact hitter who could hit to all fields. He rarely struck out (just 434 times, once every 21 at-bats) and his goal was to put the ball in play and move baserunners over. Gwynn's success as a contact hitter landed him in the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\n"}
{"id": "4382662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4382662", "title": "Denman Arena", "text": "Denman Arena\n\nDenman Arena was an indoor arena located in downtown Vancouver, British Columbia. The arena was located at 1805 West Georgia Street at the northwest corner with Denman Street. It opened in December 1911 and was destroyed by fire in 1936. Its primary use was for ice sports such as ice hockey. It was the home ice rink of the Vancouver Millionaires professional ice hockey team, and was the location of 1915 Stanley Cup championships. The arena was also used for other sports, musical performances and public assemblies. It was an assembly point for Canadian servicemen during World War I. The 10,500 seat arena was the largest in Canada at the time, and introduced mechanically frozen or \"artificial\" ice to Canada.\n\nIn January 1911, Joe Patrick sold his Nelson, British Columbia lumber business for $440,000. The Patrick family moved to Victoria and the decision was made to use the proceeds of the company sale to go into the business of professional ice hockey. The family built the Denman Arena to support the new Pacific Coast Hockey Association professional ice hockey league, to be run by Joe's sons Frank and Lester Patrick. Both Frank and Lester were professional ice hockey players and had played in the National Hockey Association and other early professional leagues in Eastern Canada. Simultaneously, the Patricks also built the 4000-seat Patrick Arena in Victoria.\n\nTo build the Vancouver arena, the Patricks bought a parcel of land consisting of thirteen lots from the water's edge of Coal Harbour to Georgia Street, bounded by Denman and Chilco Streets. The location was near Stanley Park to the west, and was connected to the downtown business district by a streetcar line along Georgia Street. The site was previously the location of the Kanaka Ranch, which was settled in the 1860s by Hawaiian families, who grew fruit and vegetables, and produced charcoal, on the site.\n\nTo finance the construction of the Arena, the Patricks formed the Vancouver Arena Company Limited, capitalized at $200,000. The company was divided into 1000 preferred shares and 1000 common shares, with a 10% annual dividend. The company issued an initial share offering, but by September 1911, the offering had only raised $1400. Two more investors signed on, but it was up to the Paticks to take the rest. To facilitate the playing of ice hockey in Vancouver's moderate climate, the Patricks imported mechanical ice freezing equipment that Frank and Lester Patrick had seen in operation at New York's St. Nicholas Arena. The Denman Arena opened on December 20, 1911, attracting 1500 people for a session of public ice skating. Denman Arena held 10,500 people, making it at the time, the largest indoor arena in Canada, one of the world's largest indoor arenas, and the second largest indoor arena in North America, after the second Madison Square Garden in New York City. The Arena was built at a cost of $226,382.\n\nIn 1927, the Patricks built the 2,500 seat Denman Auditorium next to the Arena. The Auditorium, which was multi-purpose, survived the fire of 1936 and was renovated in 1952. It re-opened on September 10, 1952 as the Georgia Auditorium concert hall. It only lasted seven years before it was demolished in 1959, after the construction of the Queen Elizabeth Theatre.\n\nThe Arena was the permanent home of the professional Vancouver Millionaires of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association. The Arena was also the home of the New Westminster Royals from 1911 until 1914. The Patricks had hoped to set up teams in Calgary and Edmonton in the PCHA for the opening season, but the plans fell through. To avoid having a two-team league, the Patricks formed the Royals, to represent the neighbouring town of New Westminster and encourage fans to come to the Arena. Although the Royals were an unexpected necessity, the Royals were the winners of the first PCHA championship. The Royals were disbanded in 1914, when the PCHA formed a team in Portland, Oregon. The Millionaires were later renamed the Maroons and were disbanded in 1926 when the Western Canada Hockey League discontinued operations.\n\nThe Arena hosted the Stanley Cup \"World Series\" championship series four times. The 1915 series pitted the Millionaires versus the National Hockey Association's Ottawa Senators, the first Stanley Cup series held west of Winnipeg. The series was won by the Millionaires, and remains the only Stanley Cup won by a Vancouver team. The Arena also hosted Stanley Cup series in 1921, won by Ottawa, the 1923 series won by Ottawa and game two of the 1925 series, won by the Victoria Cougars.\n\nDuring construction, the Patricks organized a four-team amateur ice hockey league, the Vancouver Amateur Hockey League, composed of the Vancouver Athletic Club, the Bankers, the Columbians and the Vancouver Rowing Club. In 1921, the Arena hosted the first international women's championship of ice hockey, organized by the PCHA. After the collapse of the Western Canada league, a new Pacific Coast Hockey League was organized, with the Vancouver Lions playing out of the Arena. The PCHL lasted three years. In 1933, the Lions were revived in the North West Hockey League. The Lions continued after the destruction of the Arena, and a reconstituted PCHL began operations with the Lions as a member.\n\nTwo other ice sports clubs had their start at the Denman Arena. The Arena also had four curling rinks in the basement and the Vancouver Curling Club was established in December 1911. Curling was discontinued during World War I to make way for the armed forces. The Club re-organized in 1931 at the Pacific National Exhibition's Forum. The Club built its own facility in 1949. The Connaught Skating Club also was established in December 1911, and celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2011. During the 1920s, the Club held competitions and an annual \"Carnival\" show at the Arena. After the Arena burned down, Connaught moved to the Forum as well, and in 1965 moved to Richmond, British Columbia to Richmond's Minoru Arena.\n\nThe Arena and Auditorium were also used for boxing and wrestling matches. The North Shore Indians of the Inter-City League played box lacrosse in the Arena in the 1930s.\n\nIn 1914, the Arena was used to house over 1,000 soldiers who were assembling to form the 23rd Infantry Brigade. The soldiers left Vancouver in August 1914 to be deployed as the first Canadian troops in World War I.\n\nOn October 21, 1924, the Arena was the site of a political radio broadcast by Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, who spoke at Denman Arena during a tour of the west. It may have been the first political broadcast in Canada. Later that year, the telephone line installed was used for the first radio broadcast of an ice hockey game in British Columbia.\n\nOn April 28, 1935, over 16,000 assembled at the Arena for a political rally by the CCF, the largest indoor gathering in Vancouver up until that time.\n\nThe Denman Auditorium was taken over during World War II by the Canadian navy, then used as storage by Boeing Aircraft. It was bought in 1945 by H. M. Singer, who converted it back to a venue. Two notable rock and roll concerts took place in 1957, by a touring group of musicians known as \"The Biggest Show of Stars.\" The lineup included Paul Anka, Chuck Berry, Eddie Cochran, Fats Domino, The Drifters, The Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, Buddy Knox and others. The Vancouver Symphony Orchestra regularly played at the venue during the 1950s. The final event at the Georgia Auditorium took place on June 19, 1959. It was a free show by the CBC Talent Caravan.\n\nOther musical performances at the Arena and Auditorium included performances by Maurice Ravel, Dizzy Gillespie, Glenn Gould, Charlie Parker, Oscar Peterson, Ella Fitzgerald, Jeanette MacDonald, Margaret Truman and others.\n\nThe Arena was built of wood in 1911. Not long before 1936, the Arena was clad in brick to reduce its risk of burning due to fire. On the night of August 19, 1936, 4,000 fans had attended a boxing match by Max Baer. By 1:30 AM that night, a fire had broken out in the adjacent Coal Harbour area. Despite the recently added brick veneer, the fire spread to inside the Arena. The interior exploded into flame and the Arena could not be saved by Vancouver firemen. Stan Patrick, the youngest brother of Frank and Lester Patrick, and manager of the auditorium, attended the fire and was quoted as saying \"You think this is a good fire? You should have seen the one in Victoria. That was a pip!\" A lack of wind prevented the huge fire from spreading into downtown Vancouver. The overall damage of the fire was estimated at $500,000. Two persons were killed and three firemen injured. The Arena was destroyed, along with seven industrial buildings, two homes and fifty-eight small boats. The concrete floor of the Arena was not destroyed, and it was adapted into an outdoor dance floor named the Starlight.\n\nIn 1945, the site of the arena was sold by Lester Patrick to Vancouver theatre owner H. M. Singer for $80,000. Singer planned to build a $1 million sports arena on the site, but the arena was never built. Singer managed the Auditorium as a concert venue until 1959.\n\nThe site today is now part of Devonian Harbour Park. A historical marker has been placed at the foot of Denman Street, with information about the Arena, the Georgia Auditorium and Coal Harbour.\n\n"}

All-star challenges between Canada and the United States were held. On many occasions, special matches between postal employees and former National Hockey League players helped to generate awareness and attract spectators. Funds raised went towards health care research and to assist those with physical or mental disabilities.\n\nThe 25th Anniversary of the tournament was held in Montreal from April 13 to April 15, 2001. The 2006 edition of the tournament attracted 76 teams and 1300 players to London, Ontario.\n\nTo commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the event, Canada Post issued a commemorative envelope to mark the event.

The trophy's namesakes are Dean James E. Foy, V, who served at both Auburn and Alabama and the father of photojournalist Mary Lou Foy, and Omicron Delta Kappa (ODK) National Leadership Honor Society, which has circles at both universities. In years of Auburn victories, the trophy is displayed at the Auburn Arena in the Jonathan B. Lovelace Hall of Honor, and following Alabama victories, the trophy resides in the Paul W. Bryant Museum.\n\nThe trophy was established in 1948 by the two circles of Omicron Delta Kappa to signify a good relationship between the two schools despite the bitter rivalry. In 1978, upon his retirement from Auburn University, the trophy was dedicated to Dean James Foy because of his importance to both schools. Foy graduated from the University of Alabama and served there as the Assistant Dean of Students before serving as Dean of Students at Auburn University. Foy also served as the Faculty Secretary, the key faculty officer for ODK, for both circles.\n\nEach year, the trophy is presented to the winning school by the losing school at the winners' home basketball game in the Iron Bowl of Basketball, and then resides at the winning university through the following year. The ODK president from the losing school presents the trophy to the ODK president of the winning school during halftime of the basketball game, and tradition dictates that the presenter also sing the fight song of the winning school. This tradition is seen at University of Alabama SGA as President James Fowler sings the Auburn fight song in 2011.

Bundesliga. He is most remembered for his key performance at 2010 FIFA World Cup representing the North Korea national team. He is currently playing for and is the Captain of Shimizu S-Pulse.\n\nJong was born in Nagoya, Japan to Korean parents residing in Japan. Although some reports indicate that Jong's parents and Jong himself have South Korean citizenship, Jong has said that he is not South Korean, but North Korean as his family identify themselves as North Koreans. His mother sent him to attend a private school in Japan run by Chongryon, a group closely tied to the North Korean government – where he started football at its elementary school club. He later attended Korea University, a private university in Tokyo also funded by Chongryon.\n\nChongryon, North Korea's de facto embassy in Japan, issued a North Korean passport to him. This made him eligible, per FIFA rules, to play for North Korea and resulted in \"de facto \"dual nationality.\n\nJong is fluent in Korean and Japanese. He also knows how to speak Portuguese which he learned from his Brazilian teammates at Japan's Kawasaki Frontale. He also speaks German from playing in Germany. He speaks cursory English, due to his trial in Blackburn.\n\nJong publicly emphasized the separation between sportsmanship and politics after the disputes before and during the match between North Korea and Japan on 15 November 2011.\n\nAfter joining Kawasaki Frontale in 2006, the striker quickly rose to become one of Kawasaki's best players and one of the best strikers in the J-League. Jong went for a trial with English club Blackburn Rovers in early 2010. After the 2010 World Cup, Jong joined German club VfL Bochum. After one and half seasons in the 2. Bundesliga, Jong transferred to 1. FC Köln in the 1. Bundesliga in January 2012, following an injury to German international Lukas Podolski. However, his time at 1. FC Köln was marred by a lack of playing time.\n\nOn 3 January 2013, Jong announced that after he would start playing for the first-division South Korean K-League club, Suwon Samsung Bluewings. He had expressed interest in the move for several months before the announcement, and the Bluewings and Ulsan Hyundai FC had both been negotiating with him. Jong joined the South Korean outfit on 10 January 2013 for a reported fee of €300,000 from 1. FC Köln. After deliberation by K League 1 and FIFA authorities, Jong was registered as a South Korean (domestic) player in the K-League and AFC Champions League competitions.\n\nOn 6 April, he scored his debut goal for Suwon in a 3–1 home win against Daegu FC. Two weeks later, 20 April, he scored a hat-trick in a 4–1 win at Daejeon Citizen.\n\nOn 8 July 2015 he was bought by Shimizu S-Pulse as an emergency signing as Shimizu were in the drop zone after total points calculation from both stages of the season. He was inserted into the starting lineup on 25 July, Matchday 4 of the 2nd stage, away to his former club Kawasaki Frontale which ended in a 2–3 defeat.\n\nJong's first international appearance was on 19 June 2007, during a 2008 East Asian Football Championship qualifier match against Mongolia and he scored his first international goal in that game. He went on to score a total of four goals which Korea DPR won the match 7–0. Jong also played at the 2008 East Asian Football Championship and scored two goals in three matches for Korea DPR, receiving top scorer honors along with Park Chu-Young, Yeom Ki-Hun and Koji Yamase.\n\nBefore FIFA 2010 World Cup Jong was also the key figure in Korea DPR's 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, as they qualified for the World Cup South Africa for the first time in 44 years. Jong had made himself famous for sobbing uncontrollably when the North Korean national anthem was played before the kickoff of Korea DPR's first group stage match at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, against Brazil. In that match he assisted Ji Yun-Nam's goal in a 2–1 defeat.\n\nAlthough nicknamed \"the People's Rooney\" by the English press, he likened his style of play to Didier Drogba.\n\n\"Updated to 22 February 2018\".\n"}

Robinson, Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart and, in the title role, rising newcomer Wayne Morris. It was scripted by Seton I. Miller and directed by Michael Curtiz.\n\nIt was remade in 1941, this time in a circus setting, as \"The Wagons Roll at Night\", also with Bogart, and in 1962 as an Elvis Presley musical. The original version was re-titled The Battling Bellhop for television distribution in order to avoid confusion with the Presley remake.\n\nIn Florida, boxing promoter Nick Donati (Edward G. Robinson) gets doublecrossed by his boxer, who throws a fight for a $25,000 bribe from gangster Turkey Morgan (Humphrey Bogart). Nick and his girlfriend \"Fluff\" (Bette Davis) decide to throw a wild, days-long party with the money they have left, before looking for a new boxing prospect. Nick orders naive young farmer turned hotel bellhop Ward Guisenberry (Wayne Morris) to mix some drinks, but he does not know how, as he does not drink. Fluff kindly helps him out. When Morgan, underling Buzz Barret (Ben Welden), and Chuck McGraw (William Haade), his fighter and new heavyweight champion, arrive uninvited, Ward does not like it when the somewhat drunk McGraw pushes Fluff, so he punches him, knocking him to the ground. Nick is impressed, and persuades him to try boxing.\n\nFor his first bout, Ward is up against McGraw's experienced brother. Much to everyone's surprise, he wins by knockout. To protect him from Morgan's wrath, Nick sends him, Fluff and ringside assistant Silver Jackson (Harry Carey) to New York City by train. However, Morgan is waiting outside their usual hotel. He tries to get Ward to sign with him, but Ward knocks him down, insisting he will only sign with Nick.\n\nDesperate, Fluff decides to hide the handsome young man at Nick's mother's farm. There he meets Nick's sister, Marie (Jane Bryan), fresh from a convent education. They clash. When Nick finds out, he is furious. He does not want his family to have anything to do with boxing. He takes Ward back to the city.\n\nWard, rechristened \"Kid Galahad\", wins a string of fights by knockout. He tells Fluff that his goal is to earn enough to buy a farm. Fluff falls for him, and is crushed when he confides to her that he is in love with Marie. She hides her disappointment, and with her encouragement, he drives up to tell Marie. It turns out that she is just as much in love with him. Fluff leaves Nick, confessing to him that she loves Ward and cannot bear to be around the young man. She gets a job singing in a nightclub.\n\nIn Ward's next fight, Nick orders him to just box and win on points, as knocking his opponent out would build public pressure to fight the champ too soon; Nick wants more time to train his fighter. However, Morgan tells his foe what to say to infuriate Ward. As a result, Ward wins by knockout.\n\nMarie sees the fight; afterward they go out on the town. When she asks to see Fluff, Ward takes her to the nightclub. By coincidence, McGraw is in a private room there, drunk and with a couple of girls. When Morgan shows up to get him, McGraw spots Ward and pushes him to the floor. The two are separated, but Ward offers to fight within the month. Newspaper photographers take pictures of Ward with both Marie and Fluff. As a result, Nick finally learns that Ward has been seeing his sister.\n\nInfuriated, Nick secretly turns on his boxer, agreeing to a title bout. He orders Ward to come out slugging, knowing it is a losing strategy. When Morgan discovers that Nick has placed substantial bets against his own fighter, he visits Nick. He learns that Nick wants to get back at Ward, and decides to bet $150,000 himself. During the bout, Ward faithfully follows Nick's orders and is knocked down repeatedly by McGraw. Fluff and Marie attend the fight together. When Fluff realizes what Nick is doing, she and Marie plead with him to stop. Nick finally comes to his senses and changes tactics. In the end, Ward knocks McGraw out and becomes world heavyweight champion.\n\nAfter the fight, an armed Morgan arranges to be alone in the changing room with Nick, Ward and Silver. Nick is prepared though, and also has a gun. They exchange shots, fatal on both sides. Before he dies, Nick gives his blessing to Ward and Marie.\n\nAccording to his \"New York Times\" obituary of December 3, 1975, the playwright and screenwriter Lawrence Riley, famous for his Broadway hit \"Personal Appearance\" (basis of Mae West's \"Go West, Young Man),\" contributed to \"Kid Galahad\"'s screenplay, although uncredited.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reviewer Frank S. Nugent applauded Morris's \"natural and easy performance. Time Out considered the film a \"none too subtle exposition of the now well-worn theme of corruption in the boxing-ring\", but conceded that \"sleek direction and excellent performances keep it enjoyable.\" Dave Kehr of the \"Chicago Reader\" disagreed, characterizing it as \"pretty much all genre and no nuance\", though he found Curtiz's direction \"surprising soft and light.\"\n\n"}

It is also set to host Super Bowl LV in February 2021.\n\nRaymond James Stadium was built to replace Tampa Stadium at the demand of the new Bucs owner Malcolm Glazer. It is located adjacent to the site of the old stadium on the former location of Al Lopez Field, a minor-league baseball stadium that had been demolished in 1989. Once completed, the final cost of the new stadium was $168.5 million, with the entire cost publicly financed.\n\nIt was known as Tampa Community Stadium during construction, but the naming rights were bought for US$32.5 million for a 13–year deal by St. Petersburg-based Raymond James Financial in June 1998. On April 27, 2006, an extension was signed to maintain naming rights through 2015. In May 2016 the Buccaneers announced that the naming rights were extended an additional 12 years ensuring that Raymond James Financial's name will continue to appear through 2028.\n\nThe stadium officially opened on September 20, 1998, when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Chicago Bears, 27–15. The stadium hosted its first soccer game on March 20, 1999, when the Tampa Bay Mutiny lost to D.C.

In 2010, no home game achieved a ticket sell out, so none could be broadcast on local television. The streak carried over until week four of the 2011 season, when it sold enough tickets for its Monday night game with the Indianapolis Colts on October 3 to avoid a local blackout.\n\nThe Monster Jam tour for monster trucks holds an event at the stadium.\n\nOne of the most recognizable features of the stadium is a , 43-ton steel-and-concrete replica pirate ship in the north end zone. Each time the Bucs score points, enter the other team's red zone, or win a home game, the replica cannons on the ship are fired off. The cannons fire once for each point scored. In addition, when the Buccaneers enter their opponent's red zone, stadium hosts hoist team flags around the perimeter of the upper deck. During various times throughout the game, the song \"Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)\" is played on the stadium public address system (taken from Pirates of the Caribbean), which signals patrons on board the ship to throw beads, t–shirts, and other free prizes to the people below. The segment is also known as a \"Mini Gasparilla\" to most fans. An animated parrot sits on the stern of the pirate ship. Controlled by radio and remote control, the parrot picks fans out of the crowd and talks to those passing by.\n\nDuring Super Bowl XXXV on CBS, the pregame, halftime, and post-game desk reporting took place from aboard the pirate ship. NBC's Super Bowl XLIII and ESPN's 2017 College Football Playoff National Championship coverage also emanated from the ship.\n\nThe two \"Buc Vision\" Daktronics video displays were among the largest in the league when they were built. In 2016 they were replaced with 9,600-square foot, high-definition video boards in both end zones. 'Buccaneer Cove' features a weathered, two–story fishing village facade, housing stadium concessions and restrooms. All areas of the stadium are ADA compliant.\n\nTemporary bleachers were erected in the end zones for Super Bowl XXXV, which set a then-record stadium attendance of 71,921. The stadium attendance record has since been surpassed by the 2017 College Football Playoff National Championship, which also made use of temporary seating.\n\nIn 2003, the corner billboards in the stadium were replaced with rotating trilon billboards and these were replaced in 2016 with new high visibility displays.\n\nRaymond James Stadium boasts the second-best turf in the NFL, according to a 2009 biannual players' survey.\n\nIn early 2016, the stadium was given an extensive facelift. The most notable improvement was the replacement of the video displays with state of the art, high visibility video displays in both the north and south end zones along with the addition of a new video tower in each corner. All together, the video displays cover more than , making Raymond James Stadium the third-largest video displays in the NFL. The original sound system and the stadium's luxury boxes were also upgraded. A second round of improvements are planned for after the 2016 season is complete.\n\nThe stadium is referred to as \"Ray Jay\" or \"The New Sombrero\", a spinoff from \"The Big Sombrero\", the nickname of Tampa Stadium. Somewhat derisively, it has been occasionally referred to as \"the CITS\", a name coined by long-time local sportscaster Chris Thomas which stands for \"Community Investment Tax Stadium\", referring to the fact that the stadium was entirely financed by local taxpayers.\n\n\n\nThe stadium was also home to the former Tampa Bay Mutiny of Major League Soccer and continues to periodically host other soccer matches due to its accommodating field dimensions. For example, on June 8, 2012, it hosted the United States men's national soccer team's opening qualifying match against Antigua and Barbuda for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, which the United States won 3-1.\n\nIn October 11, 2018, the Colombia men's national soccer team played against the United States men's national soccer team (4-2) to set the current attendance record of 38,361 for a soccer match at this stadium.\n\nRaymond James Stadium has hosted several large scale concerts, with the largest attendance (72,000) coming at a show by U2 in 2009. Other performers at the venue have included Kenny Chesney, Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, NSYNC, and One Direction.\n\n\n"}
