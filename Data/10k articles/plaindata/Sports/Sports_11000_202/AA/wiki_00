The primary tenant is the Denver Broncos of the National Football League (NFL). It opened in 2001 to replace Mile High Stadium and was largely paid for by taxpayers. Invesco paid $120 million for the original naming rights, before Sports Authority secured them in 2011.\n\nDespite its sponsor's liquidation and closure in 2016, the Sports Authority name remained on the stadium for two years afterward because of regulatory hurdles. Nevertheless, the Broncos announced on January 2, 2018 that the stadium's exterior signage would be removed. The stadium took on its current name on a temporary basis on June 20, 2018 after the city's stadium authority approved the change, hoping to resell naming rights.\n\nMany fans opposed a corporate name and wished to retain the previous venue's name, \"Mile High Stadium.\" \"The Denver Post\" initially refused to use the Invesco label and referred to it as Mile High Stadium for several years before changing its policy and adding Invesco to articles.\n\nOn August 16, 2011, the Metropolitan Stadium District announced Invesco would immediately transfer the naming rights to Englewood, Colorado-based Sports Authority in a 25-year agreement worth $6 million per year. In August of 2016, the Denver Broncos paid $3,601,890 to the Metropolitan Football Stadium District to purchase the naming rights to the stadium.\n\nIn 2016, several Colorado legislators attempted to pass a bill in the Colorado State Legislature that would require the \"Mile High\" moniker regardless of any naming rights deal, citing the large public contribution to the stadium's construction; the bill failed to pass out of a Senate Committee in May 2016.\n\nThe stadium is used primarily for American football games. It is the home field for Denver's National Football League team, the Denver Broncos. The stadium also hosts the city's Major League Lacrosse team, the Denver Outlaws. In college football it has hosted the rivalry game between the Colorado State University Rams and the University of Colorado Boulder Buffaloes. It is also used for the CHSAA class 4A and 5A Colorado high school football state championship games, and has been used for the CBA Marching Band Finals.\n\nIn addition, it has been used for the Drum Corps International (DCI) Championships in 2004 and the annual Drums Along the Rockies competition. It is also used for concerts, music festivals and other events, and was home to the city's Major League Soccer franchise, the Colorado Rapids, before that team built and moved into Dick's Sporting Goods Park in suburban Commerce City.\n\nOn the 23rd June 2018 England defeated New Zealand 36-18 in Rugby League.\n\nThe construction of the stadium marked the completion of a six-year sporting venue upgrade program in Denver, including the construction of Coors Field and of Pepsi Center. As with the other venues, the stadium was constructed to be easily accessible. It sits along Interstate 25 near the Colfax Avenue and 17th Avenue exits. It is also bordered by Federal Boulevard, a major Denver thoroughfare, on the west side. A dedicated light rail station also serves the stadium. The stadium is located in the Sun Valley neighborhood.\n\nA home game tradition (carried over from the original Mile High Stadium) is the \"Incomplete Chant.\" At Bronco home games, when the opposing team throws an incomplete pass, the stadium announcer will state \"Pass thrown by [the opposing quarterback] intended for [the opposing intended receiver] is...\" at which time the fans complete the sentence by shouting \"IN-COM-PLETE!!\".\n\nThe stadium has sold out every Denver Broncos' home game since its inception in , extending the \"sold-out\" streak that began during the team's tenure at Mile High Stadium, where every home game had been sold out since (though due to NFL policy, local TV broadcasts of sold-out games did not start until ). In a tradition carried over from Mile High Stadium, the stadium's public-address announcer will give the final official attendance for the game, including the number of unused tickets; in response, Broncos fans \"boo\" the no-shows.\n\nDuring the stadium's first years, in another tradition was carried over from Mile High, Broncos fans on one side of the stadium would chant \"Go\" and fans on the other side would respond \"Broncos,\" back and forth chanting for several minutes. That tradition has since died out. Another long-term tradition is famed rowdiness of fans seated in the \"South Stands,\" although this tradition has diminished significantly as well.\n\nFinally, especially in the upper two decks, the fans create their own 'Mile High Thunder' (and warm themselves) by stamping their feet on the stadium's floors. The old Mile High Stadium was built with bare metal, and the 'Thunder' reverberated readily. The new stadium was built with steel floors to preserve this unique acoustic feature.\n\nOn December 21, 2012, the Broncos announced a $30 million renovation project prior to the start of the 2013 season, including a new high-definition LED video board on the stadium's south end zone that triples the size of the old video board.\n\nIn 2013, it was revealed that a Neil Smith Kansas City Chiefs jersey was buried somewhere near the 50-yard line by a couple of out-of-state contractors during renovations, despite Smith's play on the Broncos' Super Bowl XXXII and XXXIII-winning teams. The curse the contractors hoped to create did not occur as the Broncos won another Super Bowl two years later, Super Bowl 50.\n\nOn September 10, 2001, the stadium hosted its first regular season NFL game, in which the Broncos defeated the New York Giants 31–20. In a pre-game ceremony, Broncos legends John Elway, Steve Atwater, Randy Gradishar, Haven Moses, Billy Thompson, Floyd Little, Dennis Smith, and Karl Mecklenburg helped to \"Move the Thunder\" from the old Mile High Stadium to the new home of the Broncos.\n\nThe stadium has hosted several NFL playoff games. It hosted the 2005 AFC Divisional playoff game, in which Denver defeated the New England Patriots 27–13. The following week, it hosted the AFC Championship Game, which the Broncos lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers, 34–17. On January 8, 2012, the stadium hosted its third NFL playoff game, an AFC Wild Card playoff game against the Steelers. The Broncos won in overtime, 29–23. On January 12, 2013, the stadium hosted its fourth NFL playoff game, an AFC Divisional playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens. The Broncos lost to the Ravens 38–35 in double overtime.\n\nOn October 29, 2007, a record crowd of 77,160 watched the Broncos lose to the Green Bay Packers 19–13 on Monday Night Football on the first play from scrimmage in overtime.\n\nOn November 26, 2009, it hosted its first Thanksgiving game, when the Broncos took on the Giants. The game was televised on NFL Network, which the Broncos won by a final score of 26–6.\n\nOn January 19, 2014, the Broncos defeated the Patriots in the AFC Championship Game, 26–16 in front of 77,110 fans in attendance, advancing to their first Super Bowl since they began play in the new stadium.\n\nOn January 17, 2016, the Broncos defeated the Steelers in the AFC Divisional playoffs, 23–16 in front of 77,100, advancing to the AFC Championship Game for the 10th time in franchise history.\n\nOn January 24, 2016, the Broncos defeated the Patriots in the AFC Championship Game, 20–18 in front of 77,100, advancing to Super Bowl 50, which they won two weeks later.\n\nOn July 26, 2014, Sports Authority Field at Mile High hosted a soccer match between Manchester United and A.S. Roma which was part of the 2014 International Champions Cup and Manchester United won the match 3-2.\n\nThe stadium hosted an international rugby league match between New Zealand and England on June 23, 2018.\n\nThe stadium has held several concerts. \n\nThe stadium has hosted other sports events. The first football game held was the Rocky Mountain Showdown, when the University of Colorado Buffaloes defeated the Colorado State University Rams 41–14. On July 2, 2005, it hosted the 2005 Major League Lacrosse All-Star Game. In 2006, Major League Lacrosse placed the expansion Outlaws in Denver.\n\nIn August 2004, it hosted the Drum Corps International (DCI) World Championships, and every July hosts Drums Along the Rockies, which is a major competition in the annual DCI summer tour. \n\nOn August 28, 2008, Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama accepted the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States here, moving the 2008 Democratic National Convention from Pepsi Center. Approximately 84,000 people attended Obama's speech, exceeding the normal capacity of the stadium due to the placement of audience on the field.\n\nThe Denver Broncos Ring of Fame was created in 1984 by team owner Pat Bowlen to honor former players and administrators who played significant roles in the franchise's history. The names and years of service (and in most cases, jersey numbers) of the men inducted into the ring are displayed on the Level 5 facade of the stadium. There is no specific number of new members that may be chosen for induction in any given year; in many years, no new members were inducted.\n\nWhile the Ring of Fame was carried over from the old stadium to the new, the names were re-ordered to separate the inductees who served the team during the pre-Pat Bowlen (the team's current owner and founder of the Ring) era from those who served during Bowlen's ownership. One of the most noticeable changes was the move of John Elway's name to the center of the ring, located directly between the goalposts of the north end zone.\n\nThe Colorado Sports Hall of Fame Museum opened in August 2001. It is located at Gate #1 on the west side of the stadium.\n\n\n"}

The \"Butchers\" reference is celebrated at a designated home game once a year, when the stadium floor is sprinkled with saw dust and fans are invited to wear white overalls and hairnets. During Droylsden's recent F.A. Cup tie against Leyton Orient, broadcast live on ESPN, two fans invaded the pitch at the end of the match dressed as butchers. It has partial or full cover on three sides of the pitch, terracing on four sides and seating along the centre of one side, plus a public house.\n\nThe ground is named after the Butcher's Arms public house, whose landlord in 1892 instigated the formation of Droylsden FC to play on land behind the pub, which became the ground. After the Second World War the lease of the Butchers Arms was sold to Belle Vue F.C., who renamed themselves Droylsden United. And that club took over playing at the ground, forcing Drolysden to move to the nearby Moorside Trotting Stadium. However, the town wasn't big enough for two clubs, especially with bad feeling between them, and after the local council bought the ground, a merger was negotiated and Drolysden returned to the Butcher's Arms ground in 1952, after it had been renovated and the pitch had been rotated to its present position, finally eradicating a long-standing drainage problem.\n\nThe record attendance is 4,250 for an FA Cup first round match between Droylsden and Grimsby Town in 1976.\n"}

The podcast is produced and edited by Nicholas Jenkins with additional help from Rosianna Halse Rojas. First released in June 2015, Hank and John Green answer questions e-mailed by listeners, give \"dubious\" advice and talk about the weekly news for the planet Mars and the 3rd tier English football club AFC Wimbledon. Episodes are typically around 45 minutes in length. Upon the podcast's debut, it reached the number 4 position on the US iTunes performance chart and hit a peak position of number 2 two days later. \"Dear Hank & John\" has also been charted on iTunes in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Spain, Australia and Brazil. The podcast is primarily funded through the crowdfunding website Patreon, though the majority of the pledges go towards the video production budget of Complexly. Since November 2018, the podcast is a co-production of Complexly and WNYC Studios.\n\nThe podcast follows a general format which starts with an opening section. It usually changes every two or three months. As of now (ep. 148), John tries to give good news and Hank tells a “dad joke”. The main portion of the show then has the brothers offering comedic advice to questions received from listeners. Usually, at some point in the question segment, the brothers 'plug' various 'sponsors' of the show in a humorous manner that references topics from that week. The show then moves to the news segment, with Hank delivering the news about Mars and John the news about the AFC Wimbledon football club. Finally, the brothers discuss 'what they learned today', before reading the credits at the show's close. The brothers' schedule has sometimes led them to miss several episodes (notably for John during the summer of 2015 due to the \"Paper Towns\" publicity tour, and for Hank in late 2016 for his paternity leave); various friends of the brothers have filled in for each missing host on those occasions.\n\nIn March 2017, a 'bonus' supplemental podcast, titled \"This Week in Ryans\", started to become available for those who support the podcast on Patreon at the $5/month level or higher. In each episode, a person or thing named Ryan is selected to be discussed and analyzed by the hosts in a short segment.\n\nAn exclusive Dear Hank & John episode has been made as a perk for the annual Project for Awesome fundraising campaign each year since 2015.\n\nOn John's book tour for \"Turtles All the Way Down\" (October 10 - November 2, 2017) the Green brothers put on about a two hour long performance filled with monologues, silly songs, and a live version of Dear Hank & John. This live production of their podcast included taking real questions from real Nerdfighters who were in attendance in the audience at that particular stop of the tour. Segments that were recorded across the tour were later edited into a single podcast, and released as its 114th episode.\n\nDear Hank and John is available to listeners on a multitude of platforms. Most commonly streamed on iTunes the podcast also has thousands of \"views\" on the Dear Hank and John YouTube page where they upload episodes several days after the initial release on iTunes.

It plays games out of Deerfoot Stadium which is located off of Deerfoot Trail & 32nd Ave. NE. There are currently 11 teams in the league, whom each play a 22-game schedule prior to playoffs. It runs from early May until the end of August.\n\nIn 2017, the Calgary Cardinals won the FMBA Championship defeating the Calgary Dukes in the final, 2 games to 1. \n\nThe league currently plays a balanced 22 game schedule. \n\nThe league was started in 1979, when Doc Cody and Ron McCartney petitioned the City for a more permanent baseball facility for amateur players over the age of 18. At that time, the three original teams in the league: the Cardinals, Caseys & Odeons played out of Optimist Park before it was decided they needed to do something about the need for more playing space.\n\nIn true Calgary form, volunteers from the community stepped forward and offered to construct a major league size park on City land. The main sponsor and benefactor was Jim Wilfley, with able assistance from other sports enthusiasts such as Hank Bassen, Gem-Sod, Alberta Treasury Branch, Coca-Cola, Conmac and others. The park was built on traditional ball park lines with wooden fences, stands and a press box. The project was started in the Fall of 1982 and finished in August 1984. The entire facility was built with donated labor and funding. The league opened for play, debt free, thanks to the dedicated generosity of its sponsors.\n\nThe first president was Ron McCartney. Glen Hansen took over in 1982. Many people over the years have contributed their volunteer efforts to keep the league going.\n\nIn 1991, the facility was partially destroyed by a fire set by vandals. The reconstruction work that followed changed the appearance of the park radically as all the wooden fences and structures were removed in favor of vandal-proof facilities. The present facility was reconstructed under the presidency of Ray Brisson with funds from the fire insurance and a generous grant from the Saddledome Foundation.\n\n\n"}

He currently serves on the boards of philanthropic bodies, including the Ian Potter Foundation since 1991 and the Deafness Foundation Trust since 1993, and is patron of others.\n\nBiographer Geoffrey Bolton argues that he has played multiple roles as an Australian historian:\n\nBlainey was born in Melbourne and raised in a series of Victorian country towns before attending Wesley College and the University of Melbourne. While at university he resided at Queen's College, and was editor of \"Farrago\", the newspaper of the University of Melbourne Student Union.\n\nAfter graduating from university, Blainey took a free-lance writing assignment and travelled to the Mount Lyell mining field in Tasmania. This first major project in the 1950s was, as an author and researcher working on the history of the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company, at Queenstown, Tasmania, when a significant number of the older residents could remember the beginnings of the community. The resultant book is the only local and regional history in Australia to achieve six editions, each being updated.\n\nIn 1954, Blainey published his first book, \"The Peaks of Lyell\". He then wrote a history of his university: \"The University of Melbourne: A Centenary Portrait\" (1956).\n\nBlainey has published over 35 books, including his highly acclaimed \"A Short History of the World\". His works have ranged from sports and local histories to interpreting the motives behind the British settlement of Australia in \"\"; covering over two centuries of human conflict in \"The Causes of War\" (1973); examining the optimism and pessimism in Western society since 1750 in \"The Great See-Saw\"; Aboriginal Australia in \"Triumph of the Nomads\" (1975) and \"A Land Half Won\" (1980); and his exploration of the history of Christianity in \"A Short History of Christianity\" (2011). He has also written general histories of the world and the \"tempestuous\" 20th century.\n\nThroughout the course of his career, Blainey has also written for newspapers and television. \"The Blainey View\" was a history of Australia shown in ten episodes on ABC television.\n\nIn 1961, he began teaching economic history at the University of Melbourne, was made a professor in 1968, and was given the Ernest Scott chair in history in 1977. In 1982 he was appointed dean of Melbourne's Faculty of Arts. From 1994 to 1998, Blainey was foundation Chancellor of the University of Ballarat. He was visiting professor of Australian Studies at Harvard University.\n\nIn the academic field, he was on the board of the Melbourne University Press in the early 1960s, deputy dean of the Economics Faculty in the early 1970s, president of the council of Queen's College in the University of Melbourne from 1971 to 1989, and on the national selection committee for the Harkness Fellowships from 1977 to 1989 (chairman 1983–89).\n\nBlainey was invited by Prime Minister Harold Holt in 1967 to sit on the advisory board of the Commonwealth Literary Fund, serving until its abolition in 1973 (chairman 1971–73). He then became inaugural chairman of the Literature Board of the Australia Council for the Arts (Later called Australia Council), set up by the Whitlam government. He served on the Council from 1977–1981. Following Whitlam's election promise to introduce a Public Lending Right Scheme for authors, Blainey was appointed chairman of the committee representing authors, publishers and librarians that, in 1973, recommended the scheme adopted by the government a year later. Australia's scheme differed from the pioneering scheme adopted in Denmark in 1946. Blainey represented writers on the small group instructed to find the new national anthem that Whitlam had promised. From that initiative came a public poll supporting the long-standing Australian patriotic song, \"Advance Australia Fair\".\n\nIn December 1973, Blainey was an Australian delegate to the first UNESCO conference held in Asia, in Yogyakarta, Java; it recommended cultural policies for Asia.\n\nBlainey was deputy chairman in 1974 and 1975 of the Whitlam government's Inquiry into Museums and National Collections, whose report ultimately led to the completion in Canberra, in 2001, of the National Museum of Australia with its emphasis on indigenous history. Most of the Inquiry's report had been drafted by Blainey and his colleague, Professor JD Mulvaney.\nIn 1976, he became an inaugural commissioner on the Australian Heritage Commission, set up by the Fraser government to decide on conservation and environmental matters. On the first council of the National Museum set up by the Hawke Government in 1984 he was a short-term member.\n\nHe was chairman of the Australia Council for four years and Chairman of the Australia-China Council from its inception in 1979 until June 1984. In 2001, he was the Chairman of the National Council for the Centenary of Federation. From 1994 to 1998, he was the Foundation Chancellor of the University of Ballarat.\n\nIn 2001, Blainey presented the Boyer Lectures on the theme \"This Land is all Horizons: Australian Fears and Visions\".\n\nUnder the Howard government, he served as a member of the council of the Australian War Memorial in Canberra from 1997 to 2004, an appointment initially criticised in parliament by Laurie Brereton of the Labor opposition but approved in other circles. There was no opposition when his first three-year term was renewed. \nAt the Constitutional Convention, held in Canberra for 10 days in February 1998 to debate and vote on whether Australia should become a republic (and if so what kind of a republic), he was a non-elected delegate. He argued that Australia was already a \"de facto republic\" and that any further change should be made only if the case was very powerful. With his ally, George Mye from the Torres Strait Islands, he was the leading critic of the adopted proposal that any citizen whose name was on the general electoral roll, even a migrant of only two years' standing, should automatically be eligible to be president of the proposed republic of Australia. After the decisive failure in 1999 of the referendum to make Australia a republic, Blainey and the constitutional lawyer, Professor Colin Howard, were singled out by the Australian republicans' leader, Malcolm Turnbull, as deserving a special share of the blame. He alleged that the pair had unduly shaped the official information posted to all electors. In their defence, it was contended that their influence was fair, for they operated in an official committee chaired by the neutral Sir Ninian Stephen, lawyer and former governor general.\n\nBlainey served on the National Council for the Centenary of Federation from 1997 to 2002 (chairman from May 2001, succeeding Archbishop Peter Hollingworth), and chairman of the Council of the Centenary Medal from 2001–03. Later appointments included membership of the History Summit in Canberra in 2006 and the federal committee set up in 2007 to recommend a national curriculum for teaching Australian history. \nHe sat, from 1997 to 2004, on the Council of the Royal Humane Society of Australasia which recommended awards for acts of civilian bravery. \nIn the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, he was a weekly or fortnightly columnist for \"The Australian\", the \"Melbourne Herald\", or the \"Melbourne Age\"; he also wrote often for the \"Sydney Bulletin\", the \"Australian Business Monthly\" and other national journals. Booklets listing these articles and other works have been published by the library of Monash University. The latest booklet was last updated in about 2001. As a book reviewer, he has written for many Australian, UK and US publications. His ten-part series on Australian history, \"The Blainey View\", appeared on ABC television in 1982–83, the ABC's most ambitious venture so far on Australian history. Graham Kennedy, the television star, narrated the continuity script.\n\nBlainey is well known for speeches, often without notes, on historical and contemporary topics. In most anthologies of notable Australian speeches, present and past, one of his addresses is reprinted. On television and stage in later years, Max Gillies the comedian cleverly mimicked some speeches.\n\nHe currently serves on the boards of philanthropic bodies, including the Ian Potter Foundation since 1991 and the Deafness Foundation Trust since 1993, and is patron of others.\n\nBlainey has, at times, been a controversial figure too. In the 1980s, he queried the level of Asian immigration to Australia and the policy of multiculturalism in speeches, articles and a book \"All for Australia\". He was said by leftist critics to be closely aligned with the former Liberal-National Coalition government of John Howard in Australia, with Howard shadowing Blainey's conservative views on some issues, especially the view that Australian history has been hijacked by social liberals. As a result of these stances, Blainey is sometimes associated with right-wing politics. Blainey himself is a member of no political party.\n\nOn 17 March 1984, Blainey addressed a major Rotary conference in the Victorian city of Warrnambool. He regretted that the Hawke Labor Government in \"a time of large unemployment\" was bringing many new migrants to the areas of high unemployment, thus fostering tension. He blamed the government, not the migrants themselves. Criticising what he viewed as disproportionately high levels of Asian immigration, then running at 40 per cent of the annual intake, he added: \"Rarely in the history of the modern world has a nation given such preference to a tiny ethnic minority of its population as the Australian Government has done in the past few years, making that minority the favoured majority in its immigration policy\".\n\nThree days later, in response to the prediction of the \"increasing Asianisation\" of Australia made by Labor's Immigration Minister Stewart West, Blainey argued: \"I do not accept the view, widely held in the Federal Cabinet, that some kind of slow Asian takeover of Australia is inevitable. I do not believe that we are powerless. I do believe that we can with good will and good sense control our destiny... As a people, we seem to move from extreme to extreme. In the past 30 years the government of Australia has moved from the extreme of wanting a white Australia to the extreme of saying that we will have an Asian Australia and that the quicker we move towards it the better\".\n\nBlainey's speech, along with subsequent articles and a book on the subject, ignited nationwide controversy, especially in the Australian federal parliament which had not debated the principles of the immigration policy for many years. Most critics argued that Blainey's views were moderate and not racist. \"All peoples of the world are worthy and deserve respect\": that was the prime principle set out in the book, \"All for Australia\", which he wrote on the topic.\n\nHowever, in \"All for Australia\" he criticised the belief that \"immigration policy should primarily reflect the truth that all 'races' are equal. On the contrary, an immigration policy should not, any more than a trade or tariff policy, be designed primarily to reflect that fact\". According to Blainey, the Australian government's immigration policy was increasingly being influenced by multicultural ideology to the detriment of the national interest and the majority of Australians. He argued: \"We are surrendering much of our own independence to a phantom opinion that floats vaguely in the air and rarely exists on this earth. We should think very carefully about the perils of converting Australia into a giant multicultural laboratory for the assumed benefit of the peoples of the world\". Blainey also warned that the \"crimson thread of kinship\" invoked by Sir Henry Parkes was being undermined, stating: \"The cult of the immigrant, the emphasis on separateness for ethnic groups, the wooing of Asia and the shunning of Britain are part of this thread-cutting.\"\n\nHis views were to receive the support of a majority of Australian voters, both Labor and non-Labor voters, as a national Gallup poll confirmed in August. Victorians especially disapproved of the University's conduct in this matter.\n\nIn contrast, while Blainey was briefly in Europe in May, a professor and 23 other history teachers from the University of Melbourne distributed a public letter distancing themselves from what they called his \"racialist\" views. Other historians, including lecturers in Asian history, refused the request to sign the letter.\n\nAfter a crowd of left-wing students and marchers, mostly from outside the University of Melbourne, broke into the heavily guarded building where Blainey was conducting a tutorial in historical research, he was advised by the university on security grounds that it must cancel all his future addresses within the University for the rest of 1984. In Brisbane on 5 July, when he gave a memorial address in honour of a deceased Queensland businessman in the Mayne Hall at the University of Queensland and chaired by the chancellor Sir James Foots, noisy protesters tried to dislocate the meeting. These and similar protests were major items in the national television news. Blainey continued to express his views periodically on television, radio and his own newspaper columns but not in his own university. He retained his main position as Dean of the Faculty of Arts.\n\nBlainey and his family were subject to threats of violence, prompting him at the police's request to remove his name and address from the public telephone book and organise security for his home. According to fellow historian Keith Windschuttle: \"The immediate consequence of all this was that Blainey, easily Australia's best and most prolific living historian, was effectively silenced from speaking at his own university... This violation of academic freedom, clearly the worst in Australian history, provoked no protest at all from the university's academic staff association, nor from the university council, let alone his own departmental colleagues.\"\n\nOn the so-called \"Blainey affair\", Australian prime minister John Howard would remark: \"Nowhere, I suggest, have the fangs of the left so visibly been on display as they were in a campaign based on character assassination and intellectual dishonesty through their efforts to trash the name and reputation of that great Australian historian Geoffrey Blainey.\"\n\nIn December 1988, Blainey resigned from the University of Melbourne and resumed his former career as a freelance historian. In 1994, the Victorian government appointed him to the honorary position of foundation chancellor of the new University of Ballarat.\n\nSubsequently, in December 2007, the University of Melbourne granted a Doctor of Laws to Blainey and declared that he was, in Australia, probably a unique professional historian, noting that he had fostered wide public interest in history. The citation observed that \"few graduates of this University have exerted greater influence on national life\".\n\nBlainey has been an important contributor to the debate over Australian history, often referred to as the History Wars.\n\nIn his 1993 \"Sir John Latham Memorial Lecture\", Blainey coined the phrases \"Black armband view of history\" versus the contrasting \"three cheers\" view (see History wars). The phrase \"Black armband view of history\" began to be used, pejoratively or otherwise, by some Australian commentators and intellectuals about historians and journalists, judges and clergymen, whom they viewed as having presented an unfairly critical portrayal of Australian history since European settlement.\n\nBlainey coined the term the \"Black armband view of history\" to refer to those historians and academics, usually leftist, who denigrated Australia's past to an unusual degree and even accused European Australians of genocide against Aborigines. Former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser described the Australian history wars as a branch of the \"culture wars\" and attributed Blainey with having initiated the wider wars in his immigration speeches of 1984.\n\nReflecting on the Australian Bicentenary in 1988, Blainey accused some academics and journalists of depicting Australian history since British settlement as essentially a \"story of violence, exploitation, repression, racism, sexism, capitalism, colonialism, and a few other 'isms'.\" Blainey also accused multiculturalists of having \"little respect for the history of Australia between 1788 and 1950,\" claiming that in their eyes \"Australia was a desert between 1788 and 1950 because it was populated largely by people from the British Isles and because it seemed to have a cultural unity, a homogeneity which is the very antithesis of multiculturalism.\"\n\nBlainey referred to the contrasting positive histories as the \"three cheers\" school.\n\nCritics of Blainey's article claimed that it was anti-Aboriginal. Yet, Blainey applauded the \"many distinctive merits\" of the traditional Aboriginal way of life. Moreover, Blainey's earlier book \"Triumph of the Nomads\", was highly sympathetic to Aboriginal people, as the title indicates. It is still said to be the only narrative history of Aboriginal Australia before 1788, and a pioneering work. It was listed by the National Book Council in 1984 as one of the ten most significant Australian books of the previous 10 years.\n\nDuring the launch of his 2015 book \"The Story of Australia's People Volume 1: The Rise and Fall of Ancient Australia\", Blainey predicted the History Wars would continue in the public arena for some time as \"it is in the nature of history and of most intellectual activities, and the more so in a nation where the main strands of history — Aboriginal and European — are utterly different.\"\n\nGeoffrey Blainey was made a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society of Victoria in 1967. In 1975 he was made an Officer of the Order of Australia for his contribution to Australian literature. He was awarded a Companion of the Order of Australia in the Australia Day Honours list of 2000 for his service to academia, research and scholarship. The following year he was awarded a Centenary Medal for his services to the Centenary of Federation, of which he was Council chairman in 2001 and previously a member.\n\nAt the United Nations in New York in 1988, he was one of five intellectuals, including the American economist John Kenneth Galbraith and the Mexican poet Octavio Paz, who were awarded gold medals for \"excellence in the dissemination of knowledge for the benefit of mankind\". Blainey's book \"The Causes of War\", much read in military academies and American universities, was said to be one reason for the award.\n\nHe is an emeritus professor of the University of Melbourne, and a fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities and of the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia.\n\nIn 2002 the degree of Doctor of Letters was conferred on Professor Blainey in recognition of his contribution to the University of Ballarat and the community in general.\n\nIn 2010, Blainey was Victorian State finalist for Senior Australian of the Year.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1799743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1799743", "title": "International Practical Shooting Confederation", "text": "International Practical Shooting Confederation\n\nThe International Practical Shooting Confederation (IPSC) is the world's second largest shooting sport association and the largest and oldest within practical shooting. Founded in 1976, the IPSC nowadays affiliates over 100 regions from Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania. Competitions are held with pistol, revolver, rifle and shotgun, and competitors are divided into different divisions based on firearm and equipment features. While everyone in a division competes in the Overall category, there are also own separate awards for the categories Lady (female competitors), Junior (under 18 years), Senior (over 50 years) and Super Senior (over 60 years).\n\nIPSC's activities include international regulation of the sport by approving firearms and equipment for various divisions, administering competition rules and education of range officials (referees) through the International Range Officers Association who are responsible for conducting matches safely, fair and according to the rules. IPSC organizes the World Championships called the Handgun World Shoot, Rifle World Shoot and Shotgun World Shoot with three year intervals for each discipline.\n\nThe sport of practical shooting originated from competitions in California in the 1950s with the goal of developing handgun skills for defensive use, but quickly evolved into a pure sport with little grounding in the original purpose. The sport soon expanded to Europe, Australia, South America and Africa. IPSC was founded in May 1976 when practical shooting enthusiasts from around the world participated at a conference held in Columbia, Missouri, creating a constitution and establishing the rules governing the sport. Jeff Cooper served as the first IPSC President. Today there are over 100 active IPSC regions, making practical shooting a major international sport which emphasizes firearms safety highly. Through international rules concerning firearms, equipment and organizing of matches one tries to unite the three elements precision, power and speed, which is also the motto of IPSC that is \"Diligentia, Vis, Celeritas\" (DVC), Latin for \"precision, power, speed\". Only full caliber firearms are used, i.e. for handguns 9x19 mm is the smallest caliber, and the competitors try to achieve most points in the shortest time possible.\n\nAccuracy and speed is reflected by the comstock scoring method, while power is reflected by the minimum power factor requirement. Competitors fire the stages one at a time, and the scoring system is based on achieving most possible points in the shortest time.\n\nThe scoring method is called comstock, named after its inventor Walt Comstock, which means that the competitor has unlimited time to complete the stage and can fire an unlimited number of rounds. The time is measured from the start signal until the last shot fired using special shot timers with microphones, and this way the competitor can influence the total stage time. Since the number of rounds is unlimited, the competitor can re-engage the same target in order to get more points, but at the cost of using more time. Usually the two best scoring hits count for each target.\n\nCompetitors are ranked for each stage by their hit factor, which is the ratio of points per second. The hit factor is calculated by summing the points (target scores minus penalties) and dividing by the time used.\n\nformula_1\n\nFor example, if a stage has 12 paper targets, requires two scoring hits per paper taget, and since an A-hit gives 5 points, the stage will have 12 × 2 × 5 = 120 points available. If a competitor scores 115 points and uses 25.00 seconds he will get a hit factor for that stage of = 4.6. The competitor with the highest hit factor wins the stage and gets all the available stage points (in this case 120 stage points), while other competitors are given stage points based on their hit factor percentage compared to the winner. For the overall match score, stage points are added for all stages, which means that each stage is weighted by how many stage points that are available.\n\nThe scoring method allows for a precise gradation of performances across the match, but requires a computer and software to do in a timely fashion. Matches can either be scored on paper and manually transferred to the official IPSC Match Scoring System (WinMSS), or can be scored directly on electronic devices like smartphones and tablets with the WinMSS Electronic Score Sheet (ESS) app or third party scoring systems like Shoot'n Score It or PractiScore.\n\nThe power factor is the momentum of the fired bullet as it's moving through the air, which contribute to the recoil of the firearm (together with the propellant gases stemming from the amount of gunpowder). Thus, the power factor in a way reflects recoil. The power factor must exceed certain thresholds, and is calculated by measuring the \"bullet speed\" using a chronograph and measuring another of the competitors bullets on a weighing scale to find the \"bullet mass\", thereafter calculating the \"power factor\" by the formula:\n\nThe official unit used for the power factor is the imperial unit \"kilo grain feet per second\" (kgr·ft/s). \"Grain feet per second\" (gr·ft/s) can be obtained by measuring the \"mass\" in grain (gr) (equal to pound), and \"velocity\" in feet per second (ft/s), but since their product yields a very large number it is common to multiply by a factor of , obtaining the power factor in \"\"kilo\" grain feet per second\" instead.\n\nTo measure the muzzle velocity the competitor's ammunition must be fired in the competitor's firearm, since velocities can vary slightly from one firearm to another. In for instance handgun competitions the ammunition must exceed 125 kgr·ft/s for minor scoring, and at least 160 or 170 kgr·ft/s for major scoring (depending on division). Extra scoring is not given for exceeding the threshold. A competitor declaring major, but who fails the threshold, have their score re-calculated at minor. A competitor who fails the threshold of minor is given a score of zero for the match.\n\nTo achieve a varied, challenging and exciting sport there are no fixed target arrangements, distances or shooting programs, making every match unique. Paper and steel targets can be mixed in the same stage, and may be static, moving or partially covered by targets called no-shoots that give minus points if hit.\n\nPaper targets have the three scoring zones A, C and D with points per hit varying slightly depending on power factor. A center hit for both minor or major is five points, but hits in lesser scoring areas are rewarded more for major than minor with the A-C-D zones being scored 5-4-2 for major and 5-3-1 for minor (see table below). A competitor who has declared minor must therefore either shoot more \"A\" hits or shoot faster than one who has declared major in order to make up the scoring disadvantage.\n\nSome typical examples moving target setups are swingers, bobbers, clamshells, movers and drop turners.\n\nSteel targets score 5 points and must fall to be scored. (For rifle some steel targets may score 10 points).\n\nFor paper targets, the octagonal IPSC Target in typical cardboard color is used throughout all the disciplines, and a 2/3 scaled down IPSC Mini Target is used to simulate a full size target placed at a greater distance. Additionally the Universal Target can be used for rifle or shotgun, while the A3 and A4 paper targets are approved for shotgun matches only.\n\nFor steel targets, there are two standardized knock down targets, the IPSC Popper (85 cm tall) and the 2/3 scaled down IPSC Mini Popper (56 cm tall). Metal plates are often circles between 20–30 cm in diameter or squares between 15x15 cm to 30x30 cm for handgun, and circles between 15–30 cm in diameter or squares between 15x15 cm to 30x45 cm for rifle and shotgun.\n\nFor many years IPSC was fired with whatever firearm the competitors chose, but as equipment became more and more specialized various equipment classes was introduced. The equipment classes in IPSC are called \"divisions\". All divisions fire the same stages, on the same days, as all other divisions, in a match. However, when calculating match standings, only divisional stage scores are compared. Thus, the top competitor in Open on a stage is the measure for all other Open competitors, the best Standard competitor is the measure for all other Standard competitors and likewise for all other divisions.\n\nIn handgun there are currently one division for optical sights and four divisions for iron sights. The minimum caliber is 9x19 mm for all handgun divisions. During competition the handgun must be worn in a holster securely attached to the competitor's belt. The holster needs to cover the trigger guard, the heel of the gun needs to be above the top of the belt and the belt has to be attached through at least three belt loops. Men must wear the holster, magazine holders etc. in the belt at waist level, while female competitors may choose to wear their equipment either at hip or waist level. During competition the position of the holster, magazine holders etc. can not be moved or adjusted from stage to stage. For all divisions except Open and Revolver the foremost portion of the handgun and all magazines must be placed behind the hip bone. Race holsters are permitted in all divisions\n\nOpen division is the handgun equivalent to the Formula 1 race car where most modifications are permitted to achieve a faster and more accurate gun. It's the only division which permits optical and electronic sights (such as red dot sights) and recoil reducing muzzle brakes (also called compensators). The division facilitates the highest magazine capacity, placing a restriction of 170 mm maximum overall length measured at the rear of any magazine. Shorter magazines, i.e. 140 mm, are also popular because of easier handling and often more reliable feeding, leaving the competitor a choice of equipment according to the stage at hand.\n\nOpen and Revolver are the only two divisions where 9 mm bullets (.355\") can be used to achieve major scoring, and hence .38 Super (or some variant) or 9x19 mm loaded to major power factor of 160 kgr·ft/s are popular cartridges for the pistols in Open. The 9 mm caliber cartridges provides higher gas pressures and better magazine capacity over 10 mm calibers. Open handguns are often expensive custom builds with parts and features specifically designed for competition, and with the maximum magazine length of 170 mm some 9 mm/ .38 Super magazines can hold up to 28 or 29 rounds.\n\nThe Open division was formally adopted at the General Assembly following the 1992 European Handgun Championship in Barcelona, Spain, and became a recognized division starting in 1993. Any handguns complying with the previous rules were included, for instance there was placed no restriction on handgun size or type of sights. Later the 170 mm maximum length was introduced.\n\nStandard division allows any handgun that fits inside the IPSC box, and most modifications are permitted (except optical sights or compensators). Light match triggers are common, and modifications such as slide rackers, thumb rests (\"gas pedals\") and grip tape on the slide can sometimes also be seen. The IPSC box has internal dimensions of 225 x 150 x 45 mm in length × height × depth with a tolerance of +1 mm, -0 mm (approximately 8.86 x 5.91 x 1.77 inches). The handgun must fit with the slide parallel to the longest side of the box and hammer cocked if applicable. The handgun must fit the box with any of its magazines inserted, which means that for instance on 2011 pattern pistols either 124 or 126 mm magazines usually will give the maximum capacity and still fit the box.\n\nMinimum caliber for minor scoring is 9x19 mm loaded to a power factor of 125 kgr·ft/s while minimum caliber for major scoring is a 10 mm (.40\") cartridge loaded to a power factor of 170 kgr·ft/s, making for an interesting choice between minor and major scoring taken in mind the differences in recoil, magazine capacity and scoring points. An example of differences in magazine capacity depending on caliber can be seen when comparing stock 126 mm STI 2011 double stack magazines, which according to the manufacturer yields a capacity of either 12 rounds for .45 ACP, 14 rounds for .40 S&W or 17 rounds for 9x19 mm. Magazine capacity can be further increased using aftermakert springs, followers and basepads as long as they still fit the box. For a 2011 pattern handgun, aftermarket parts and magazine tuning can increase capacity from 12 to 16 rounds for .45 ACP, from 14 to 19 rounds for .40 S&W and from 17 to 21 rounds for 9x19 mm. It is common belief that major scoring using the .40 S&W will give better scores for most competitors over the 9x19 mm, but at the cost of more expensive ammunition.\n\nThe Standard division was formally adopted at the General Assembly following the 1992 European Handgun Championship in Barcelona, Spain, and became a recognized division starting in 1993. One of the intentions of the Standard division was to create an own division for more \"stock\" firearms, since it up to then had been no equipment divisions, and the sport had started to become dominated by custom built race guns with compensators and optical sights. However, the Standard division was later criticized for also having become a \"race division\" somewhat like Open, dominated by custom built guns and specialized gear. Major caliber .40 S&W dominates, since it is seen as a much better alternative scoring-wise, but is more expensive than regular minor scoring 9x19 mm (price difference varies, but usually 50-60% more expensive). Also, from a practical standpoint, the .40 S&W can be difficult to obtain when travelling to international matches, while the 9x19 mm round on the contrary is perceived as affordable and available all around the world. This made way for the Production division starting in 2000, which has minor scoring only, allows fewer modifications and has a common magazine limit of 15 rounds.\n\n\nProduction division is the most popular division as of 2016. The division allows very few modifications and is limited to typical \"off the shelf\" service pistols which has to be explicitly approved and listed on the IPSC Production Division List. Maximum barrel length is 127 mm (5 inches). The handgun must be double-action (DA/ SA, DAO or striker fired), and is required to have a minimum trigger pull weight. Striker fired handguns have a minimum trigger pull of 1.36 kg for every trigger pull, while DA/SA handguns are required to have a minimum trigger pull of 2.27 kg only for the first double action trigger pull (no weight limit for subsequent single action trigger pulls).\n\nProduction is the only division with minor scoring only, which means that anyone can be competitive with affordable and readily available 9x19 mm factory ammunition, without having to worry about handloading to make major. Together with (in general) affordable handguns, Production therefore makes for a popular division. Different models of handguns have variance in magazine capacity, but this is evened out by limiting competitors to load their magazines to a maximum of 15 rounds (15 in each magazine plus 1 in the chamber).\n\nPermitted modifications are limited to the application of grip tape in limited areas around the grip, replacement of sights that do not require gunsmithing to be installed (i.e. milling to the slide) and the replacement of internal components only available as a factory option from the original manufacturer. After-market magazines are allowed. Minor polishing and fitting of trigger components is permitted. Note that there are differences in approved handguns for IPSC Production division and USPSA Production division, as well as permitted modifications.\n\nFrom 2019 the Production division has been divided into Production, Production Optics and Production Optics Lite. Production Optics is based on the Production rules, but with an optical sight allowed.The optical sight can only be mounted to the un-modified slide. Racking handles or other protuberances from the optical sight or its mounting is not permitted. Regular Production handguns without optical sights can also compete in this division. Production Optics Lite is similar, except that the complete handgun must satisfy a weight limit of 1000 grams\n\nThe Production division was introduced at the General Assembly after the 1999 Handgun World Shoot in Cebu, Philippines, and became a recognized division starting in 2000. Production Optics was accepted as a trial division in 2017, and both Production Optics and Production Optics Lite were definitively accepted in 2018.\n\nIntroduced in 2011, the Classic division was modelled after the USPSA Single Stack division and is limited to handguns visually resembling the single stack 1911 form. The handgun with any of its magazines inserted has to fit inside the IPSC box. The competitor can choose between maximum 8 rounds per magazine for major scoring or 10 rounds per magazine for minor scoring. Minor scoring can be achieved with a 9 mm projectile loaded to a power factor of 125 kgr·ft/s, while major scoring requires a 10 mm or larger projectile loaded to a power factor of 170 kgr·ft/s.\n\nHandguns must have a one piece metal frame, slide with stirrup cuts and the dust cover (with or without an accessory rail) can have a maximum length of 75 mm from the leading edge to the rear of the slide stop pin. Magazine wells cannot exceed a maximum outside width of 35 mm. Permitted modifications are shaped slides (i.e. flat-top or tri-top), shaped trigger guards (i.e. squared or undercut), bob-tail backstraps, bull or coned barrels, external extractors, finger-grooves (machined, add-on, wrap-around etc.), custom magazine release buttons, triggers, hammers, single/ ambidextrous thumb safeties, any iron sights, extended slide lock levers and thumb shields provided they do not act as a thumb rest. Cosmetic modifications are permitted.\n\nProhibited modifications / parts are slide lightening cuts, weak hand thumb rests and slide rackers.\n\nIn the Revolver division double action revolvers in caliber 9x19 mm or larger of any capacity can be used. Muzzle brakes or optical sights are not permitted. Competitors may declare major with a 9 mm (.355\") bullet loaded to a power factor of 170, but a maximum of 6 rounds can be fired before a reload is required. From 2017, there is no limit on rounds fired number of rounds fired before a reload is required, but revolvers with a capacity of 7 rounds or more will automatically be scored as Minor power factor. It is common to use moon clips for faster reloads. The Revolver division was introduced at the General Assembly after the 1999 Handgun World Shoot in Cebu, Philippines, and was a recognized division starting in 2000, initially under the name \"Revolver Standard\" before it was renamed to \"Revolver\" around 2009.\n\nNow obsolete, the Modified division was a mix between Open and Standard. Handguns were allowed to have compensators and optical sights as long as they would fit in the IPSC box with any of its magazine inserted. The Modified division was formally adopted at the General Assembly following the 1992 European Handgun Championship in Barcelona, Spain, and became a recognized division starting in 1993. The division saw some use in southern Europe, but was otherwise not very widespread, and was retired after the 2011 World Shoot XVI in Rhodes, Greece. Competitors with Modified handguns would then afterwards compete in Open.\n\nImportant elements in rifle include the use of prone, off hand and supported shooting positions. Starting position is usually with the butt of the rifle touching the hip. Knowledge of the firearms ballistics is a key element to succeed at the long range targets. The recommended balance of target distances is that 30 percent of the targets are placed closer than 60 meters, 50 percent of the targets between 60 and 150 meters and 20 percent of the targets between 150 and 300 meters. Most competitors zero their sights at 200 meters. Being an outdoor sport, the weather can have a profound effect on competitor scores due to wind or different lighting conditions, especially on long range targets. Therefore, top ranked competitors are often squadded together in order to achieve the most similar conditions.\n\nThere is no minimum caliber, but the ammunition has to make a power factor of 150 kgr·ft/s for minor or 320 kgr·ft/s for major scoring (formerly 160 and 340 kgr·ft/s respectively). Since two hits per target is normally required, rifles with minor power factor calibers dominate on the shorter ranges in most of the divisions due to less recoil and shorter recoil impulse. Minor ammunition being most common means that anyone can be competitive with affordable and readily available .223 Remington factory ammunition, without having to worry about handloading to make major. Ammunition loaded to major power factor has more recoil and a longer recoil impulse, but have the advantage of better ballistics at long range targets. Major scoring may be more competitive in the manual divisions since normally only one hit is required per target, lessening the importance of a small recoil impulse.\n\nIn the beginning competitions were fired with whatever rifle the competitors chose, and while the type of rifles mostly have remained the same sighting systems have changed a lot. For a while rifles equipped with optics and iron sights competed side by side, but were divided somewhere around the 2000s into an Open division for optic sights and a Standard division for iron sights. Open and Standard were the only two rifle divisions until the 2004 season when similar divisions were introduced for manually operated mechanisms. The Open and Standard division was then renamed to Semi Auto Open and Semi Auto Standard, while the new manual divisions was named Manual Action Open and Manual Action Standard. Around 2011 a provisional division named \"Manual Action Standard 10\" was approved for evaluation as a testing ground for development of the Manual divisions.\n\nSelf-loading rifles are used in the Semi Auto Open and Semi Auto Standard division, while the manual divisions are limited to manual action types.\n\nSemi Auto Open, usually simply referred to as the \"Open divison\", is the most popular rifle division. Optical sights are allowed together with bipods and muzzle brakes. Bipods can be taken on and off during a stage, and on some stages it can even be advantageous to switch between different bipod sizes. Many top competitors use rifles with 46 cm (18\") barrels in order to run the longer rifle length gas system and achieve a softer recoil impulse. An adjustable gas system is popular. Some also use low mass bolt carriers and buffer weights, which may however cause reliability issues if not tuned correctly.\n\nLow power scope sights with a variable magnification starting at 1x are popular, with day time bright illuminated 1-6x or 1-8x scopes being the most popular. Usually only the center of the reticle is illuminated. Some reticles have milliradian based wind holds or holdover marks to compensate for wind and bullet drop on long range targets, while others prefer reticles with a simple dot and crosshair and choose to dial long range adjustments on the turrets instead. Turrets are often exposed and lockable, having ballistic drop compensation (BDC) and a zero stop, while some competitors choose to use capped turrets for the wind adjustment. Important optical characteristics are true 1x or 1.1x low end magnification, while on higher magnification it is important with a large field of view and a large exit pupil. Some other important scope qualities are weight and stray light performance.\n\nTo avoid having to adjust magnification up and down when transitioning between several long and short range targets during the same stage, some combine a scope with a 45 degree side mounted red dot optic, but the effectiveness of this is debated and there are both top competitors who use it and not. For instance Raine Peltokoski uses only one optical sight, and in such situations instead uses a technique called \"Occluded Eye Aiming\" where one blocks the objective (i.e. with a lens cover or by hand) so that one only sees the illuminated dot with one eye and the target with the other eye.\n\nRifles with non-magnified red dot sights as the primary optic also compete in Open and are very competitive at short ranges, but the lack of magnification is a big disadvantage at longer ranges.\n\n\nThe Semi Auto Standard division usually simply referred to as the \"Standard division\", tests the added skill of using iron sights only. Also, bipods are not allowed and muzzle brakes have to be within the maximum dimensions of 30x90 mm (approx. 1x3.5 inches). A long sight radius is desirable as it helps even target and sight focus due to larger depth of field, and thus iron sighted rifles often have longer barrels with the front sight attached to the end of it. Many Standard top competitors use the longer 50 cm (20\") barrel over the 46 cm (18\") to achieve longer sight radius. Any iron sights can be used, and both \"globe\" and \"post\" front sights are popular, as well as aperture, ghost ring or diopter rear sights.\n\nThe manual divisions test the added skill of using a manual action, meaning that the rifles must be operated by physical manipulation, with some examples being bolt, pump or straight pull actions. Manual Action Open, usually simply referred to as the \"Manual Open division\", allows optical sights, muzzle brakes and bipods. Turn bolt actions require the competitor to perform both rotational and linear motions during the loading cycle, while pump and straight pull actions can be cycled back and forward without rotation of the bolt handle by the competitor. This reduces the number of movements from four to two, but comes at the cost of often having either poor or no primary extraction. increasing the risk of malfunctions. A turn bolt action on the other hand has a mechanical advantage used during chambering and primary extraction, which makes for more reliable feeding and extraction. Both types of mechanisms have won championships. Bolt action rifles usually also have a much shorter lock time than hammer fired pump and straight pull actions, which can play a significant role in accuracy on long range targets.\n\nManual Action Standard, usually simply referred to as the \"Manual Standard division\", is limited to iron sights only, and no muzzle brakes or bipods are allowed. Manual Action Standard 10 (MAS10) (between 2012 and 2017) was a trial division that allowed iron sights only, a magazine capacity of 11 rounds (10 in the magazine plus 1 in the chamber) and factory fitted muzzle brakes only.\n\nStarting position is usually with the shotgun in one hand and the butt of the shotgun touching the hip. There is only one power factor of 480 kgr·ft/s, and all targets are scored as major which means that anyone can be competitive with affordable and readily available 12 gauge 70 mm (2-3/4\") ammunition. Different options on shotgun chokes and ammunition (from different pellet sizes and up to slugs) makes for interesting choke and ammunition choices based on the stage at hand where the competitor has to consider the spread of the choke relative to the distance. All divisions have limits of the number of shells loaded at the beginning of the stage, but the limits are removed after the start signal. For instance some may choose to run 10 or 11 round tubes in the Standard division which is limited to 9 rounds in the tube at the start signal.\n\nThe Open division allows optical sights, muzzle brakes, and is the only division which permits detachable magazines or the use of speed loaders for tube magazines. The maximum overall length of the shotgun is 1320 mm (approximately 52 in) measured parallel to the barrel. Detachable magazines must not contain more than 10 rounds at the start signal, while shotguns with fixed magazines may have an initial load of 14 rounds. After the start signal detachable magazines can be loaded up 12 rounds, while there is no limit for tube magazines.\n\nThe Modified division allows muzzle brakes and optical sights, but is limited to internal tube magazines. The maximum overall length of the shotgun is 1320 mm. Modifications of the floor plate to facilitate loading is permitted, given that the modification doesn't exceed 75 mm in length or protrudes more than 32 mm from the shotgun frame in any direction. Maximum 14 rounds can be loaded at the start signal (13+1, 13 in the tube plus 1 in the chamber), but more can be loaded after the start signal. Until 2017 the division was limited to iron sights, but from 2018 optical sights are permitted.\n\nThe standard division is the most popular division as of 2017. The division is limited to iron sights and internal tube magazines, and muzzle brakes are not allowed. The shotgun model has to be factory produced of at least 500 units. Maximum 9 rounds can be loaded at the start signal (8+1, 8 in the tube plus 1 in the chamber), but more can be loaded after the start signal.\n\nThe Standard Manual division, usually simply referred to as the \"Manual divison\", is the only shotgun division limited to manual actions. Limited to iron sights, internal tube magazines and no muzzle brakes, the shotgun model has to be factory produced of at least 500 units. Maximum 9 rounds can be loaded at the start signal (8+1, 8 in the tube plus 1 in the chamber), but more can be loaded after the start signal.\n\n\nThe safety of all competitors, officials and spectators are always of the highest importance in competitions. Eye and ear protection is mandatory for both competitors and spectators. Firearms are kept unloaded until on the firing line under the direct supervision of a Range Officer, and can otherwise only be handled in designated safety areas. The safety area contain a direction with a secure backstop where competitors can handle unloaded firearms for example for packing or unpacking, holstering, cleaning or repair, dry firing or training with empty magazines. Handling of ammunition is expressively prohibited within the safety areas, including any dummy rounds. Outside the safety area ammunition can be handled freely to load magazines, but firearms may only be handled under the direct supervision of a Range Officer. The strict separation of firearms and ammunition prevents accidents like accidental discharge (AD). Violations result in disqualification from the competition.\n\nA match consists of a mix between short courses (lowest number of targets), medium and long courses (highest number of targets). The approved balance for a match is a ratio of 3 short courses to 2 medium courses and 1 long course (i.e. 6 short, 4 medium and 2 long courses for a level 3 match). Since the number of targets dictate the available points for that stage, and therefore Long courses potentially can have a have great impact on the overall standings. Short courses have fewer points available, and tend not to be as critical for the overall standings. Short courses are often more technical, offer many different stage solutions, or include challenging elements such as \"empty chamber\" or \"empty magazine well\" starts, or \"non-freestyle shooting\" elements such as strong or weak hand only. Medium courses are something in between, while long courses will have the highest round count. Long courses tend to be more freestyle and straightforward as far as different stage solutions. The shooting challenges may still not necessarily be easy, and a match can be lost or won at a long course since there are so many points available.\n\nCompetitions are held at all levels from club matches and up to the world championships. Level 3 matches and up require official IPSC pre-approved match level sanctioning in regards to courses, IROA-range official etc.\n\n\nThe World Shoots are the highest level shooting matches within IPSC. Held since 1975, it is a multi-day match where the best IPSC shooters from around the world compete for the World Champion title.\n\nThe International Range Officers Association (IROA) is a part of IPSC with the responsibility to train and certify their own dedicated range officials, who are responsible for conducting matches safely, fair and according to the rules. In addition, each IPSC region have their own National Range Officers Institute (NROI) under the IROA. In a match range officials from IROA and NROI can work alongside in the ranks:\n\n\nThe official ICS classification system (IPSC Classification System) allows athletes to be ranked both nationally and internationally based on previous results. Competitors are ranked from top to bottom as either Grand Master, Master, A, B, C or D. This way, shooters can measure progress and compare themselves with other shooters of the same classification in the match results. A classification is division specific, and an athlete may therefore have different classifications in different divisions.\n\nIn order to be classified, you must first register an ICS alias which must be used when signing up for matches. An athlete is then classified within a division after the 4 first classification results. A classification result can be achieved in three ways:\n\nOnce initial classification has been achieved, the classification will be updated based on the average of the 4 best of the 8 last results. The ICS system is dynamic, and can change based on the results being reported. For example, a result from a CLS stage will at any given time be calculated based on the highest hit factor ever shot for that particular CLS stage. In order to maintain their classification, an athlete each calendar year at least have to achieve a result in either one classification match or two CLS stages.\n\nIPSC Rating.com is a third party rating service based on performance in actual competitions and advanced rating algorithms. Results from IPSC level 3, 4 and 5 matches plus major USPSA matches are processed, with the last IPSC World Shoot as the most trusted and representative source. Scores of competitors in other matches are compared to known \"key competitors\" who are already rated to achieve global rating percents. To be ranked one must compete in at least two level 3 matches, and old results will expire if they are not updated with following matches.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "723442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=723442", "title": "Methyltestosterone", "text": "Methyltestosterone\n\nMethyltestosterone, sold under the brand names Android, Metandren, and Testred among others, is an androgen and anabolic steroid (AAS) medication which is used in the treatment of low testosterone levels in men, delayed puberty in boys, at low doses as a component of menopausal hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms like hot flashes, osteoporosis, and low sexual desire in women, and to treat breast cancer in women. It is taken by mouth.\nSide effects of methyltestosterone include symptoms of masculinization like acne, increased hair growth, voice changes, and increased sexual desire. It can also cause estrogenic effects like fluid retention, breast tenderness, and breast enlargement in men and liver damage. The drug is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It has moderate androgenic effects and moderate anabolic effects, which make it useful for producing masculinization.\nMethyltestosterone was discovered in 1935 and was introduced for medical use in 1936. It was synthesized shortly after the discovery of testosterone and was one of the first synthetic AAS to be developed. In addition to its medical use, methyltestosterone is used to improve physique and performance, although it is not as commonly used as other AAS for such purposes due to its androgenic effects, estrogenic effects, and risk of liver damage. The drug is a controlled substance in many countries and so non-medical use is generally illicit.\n\nMethyltestosterone is or has been used in the treatment of delayed puberty, hypogonadism, cryptorchidism, and erectile dysfunction in males, and in low doses to treat menopausal symptoms (specifically for osteoporosis, hot flashes, and to increase libido and energy), postpartum breast pain and engorgement, and breast cancer in women. It is specifically approved in the United States for the treatment of hypogonadism and delayed puberty in males and the treatment of advanced inoperable breast cancer in females. It was also approved in low doses in combination with esterified estrogens for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause in women in the United States, but this formulation was discontinued and hence is no longer used.\n\nThe dosages of methyltestosterone used are 10 to 50 mg/day in men for common medical uses like hypogonadism and delayed puberty as well as physique- and performance-enhancing purposes and 2.5 mg/day in women for menopausal symptoms. Higher dosages of 50 to 200 mg/day have been used to treat women with inoperable breast cancer that has failed to respond to other therapies, although such dosages are associated with severe irreversible virilization.\n\nMethyltestosterone is used for physique- and performance-enhancing purposes by competitive athletes, bodybuilders, and powerlifters, although it is not commonly used relative to other AAS for such purposes.\n\nMethyltestosterone should be used with caution in women and children, as it can cause irreversible virilization. Due to its estrogenicity, methyltestosterone can also accelerate epiphyseal closure and thereby produce short stature in children and adolescents. It can worsen symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Methyltestosterone should not be used in men with prostate cancer, as androgens can accelerate tumor progression. The drug should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing hepatotoxicity, due to its own potential for hepatotoxicity.\n\nAdverse effects of methyltestosterone include androgenic side effects like oily skin, acne, seborrhea, increased facial/body hair growth, scalp hair loss, increased aggressiveness and sex drive, and spontaneous erections, as well as estrogenic side effects like breast tenderness, gynecomastia, fluid retention, and edema. In women, methyltestosterone can cause partially irreversible virilization, for instance voice deepening, hirsutism, clitoromegaly, breast atrophy, and muscle hypertrophy, as well as menstrual disturbances and reversible infertility. In men, the drug may also cause hypogonadism, testicular atrophy, and reversible infertility at sufficiently high dosages.\n\nMethyltestosterone can sometimes cause hepatotoxicity, for instance elevated liver enzymes, cholestatic jaundice, peliosis hepatis, hepatomas, and hepatocellular carcinoma, with extended use. It can also have adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. AAS like methyltestosterone stimulate erythropoiesis (red blood cell production) and increase hematocrit levels and at high dosages can cause polycythemia (overproduction of red blood cells), which can greatly increase the risk of thrombic events such as embolism and stroke. With long-term treatment, AAS can increase the risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. Violent and even homicidal behavior, hypomania/mania, depression, suicidality, delusions, and psychosis have all been associated with very high dosages of AAS.\n\nAromatase inhibitors can be used to reduce or prevent the estrogenic effects of methyltestosterone and 5α-reductase inhibitors can be used to prevent its potentiation in so-called \"androgenic\" tissues and thereby improve its ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity and reduce its rate of androgenic side effects. Antiandrogens like bicalutamide and cyproterone acetate can block both the anabolic and androgenic effects of AAS like methyltestosterone.\n\nAs an AAS, methyltestosterone is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), similarly to androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It is a substrate for 5α-reductase like testosterone, and so is potentiated analogously in so-called \"androgenic\" tissues like the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland via transformation into the more potent AR agonist mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT). As such, methyltestosterone has a relatively low ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity, with a similar ratio to that of testosterone (close to 1:1), and this makes it among the most androgenic AAS. Due to efficient aromatization into the potent and metabolism-resistant estrogen methylestradiol (17α-methylestradiol), methyltestosterone has relatively high estrogenicity and hence potential for estrogenic side effects such as gynecomastia and fluid retention. The drug possesses negligible progestogenic activity.\n\nDue to its combined disadvantages of a relatively poor ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity, unusually high estrogenicity, and the potential for hepatotoxicity (as with other 17α-alkylated AAS), methyltestosterone has not been used as commonly as many other AAS either in medicine or for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes.\n\nMethyltestosterone has dramatically improved oral bioavailability and metabolic stability relative to testosterone. This difference is due to the C17α methyl group, which results in steric hindrance and prevents metabolism. The oral bioavailability of methyltestosterone is about 70%, and it is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Methyltestosterone can also be taken buccally or sublingually. Although effective orally, methyltestosterone is more effective by these parenteral routes, which are said to approximately double its bioavailability. Although methyltestosterone is much more potent than testosterone by the oral route, it still has relatively low potency among AAS when taken by mouth; the recommended dosage of methyltestosterone for androgen replacement in men is more than 10 times lower than that of the closely related AAS fluoxymesterone (25 mg/day buccally and 2 mg/day orally, respectively). It is highly protein-bound, by approximately 98%. The drug has low but significant affinity for human serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), about 25% of that of testosterone and 5% of that of DHT. The biological half-life of methyltestosterone is approximately 3 hours (range 2.5–3.5 hours). The duration of action of methyltestosterone is said to be 1 to 3 days, and is described as relatively short among AAS. It is excreted 90% in the urine as conjugates and other metabolites, and 6% in feces.\n\nMethyltestosterone, also known as 17α-methyltestosterone or as 17α-methylandrost-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic, 17α-alkylated androstane steroid and a derivative of testosterone differing from it only in the presence of a methyl group at the C17α position. Close synthetic relatives of methyltestosterone include metandienone (17α-methyl-δ-testosterone) and fluoxymesterone (9α-fluoro-11β-hydroxy-17α-methyltestosterone).\n\nMethyltestosterone and ethyltestosterone (17α-ethyltestosterone) are the parent structures of all 17α-alkylated AAS. Major 17α-alkylated AAS include the testosterone derivatives fluoxymesterone, metandienone (methandrostenolone), and methyltestosterone and the DHT derivatives oxandrolone, oxymetholone, and stanozolol.\n\nA chemical synthesis of methyltestosterone from dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) with methandriol as an intermediate proceeds as follows:\n\nMethyltestosterone was first synthesized in 1935 along with methandriol and mestanolone. It was the second synthetic AAS to be developed, following mesterolone (1α-methyl-DHT) in 1934, and was the first 17α-alkylated AAS to be synthesized. The drug was introduced for medical use in 1936.\n\n\"Methyltestosterone\" is the , , , , and of the drug and its generic name in English and Japanese, while \"méthyltestostérone\" is its and French name and \"metiltestosterone\" is its and Italian name. The generic name of the drug is \"methyltestosterone\" in Latin, \"methyltestosteron\" in German, and \"metiltestosterona\" in Spanish. Methyltestosterone is also known by its former developmental code name \"NSC-9701\".\n\nBrand names under which methyltestosterone is or has been marketed for medical use include Afro, Agovirin, Android, Androral, Mesteron, Metandren, Methitest, Methyltestosterone, Methyl Testosterone, Oraviron, Oreton, Oreton Methyl, Testormon, Testovis, Testred, and Virilon, among others.\n\nMethyltestosterone is available at a low-dose in combination with esterified estrogens for the treatment of menopausal symptoms like hot flashes in women under the brand names Covaryx, Essian, Estratest, Menogen, and Syntest.\n\nAlthough it is not commonly used, methyltestosterone is one of the few AAS that remains available for medical use in the United States. The others are testosterone, testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone undecanoate, nandrolone decanoate, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, and fluoxymesterone.\n\nMethyltestosterone has also been marketed in many other countries throughout the world.\n\nMethyltestosterone, along with other AAS, is a schedule III controlled substance in the United States under the Controlled Substances Act and a schedule IV controlled substance in Canada under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "617673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=617673", "title": "Waverley Park", "text": "Waverley Park\n\nWaverley Park (originally VFL Park) was an Australian rules football stadium in Mulgrave, Victoria, Australia. For most of its history, its purpose was as a neutral venue and used by all Victorian based Victorian Football League/Australian Football League clubs. However, during the 1990s it became the home ground of both the Hawthorn and St Kilda football clubs. It ceased to be used for AFL games from the 2000 season, following the opening of Docklands Stadium. It is currently used as a training venue by Hawthorn. The main grandstand and oval are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. The seating capacity is now 8,000, down from a peak of 72,000.\n\nWaverley Park (then VFL Park) was first conceived in 1959 when delegates from the 12 VFL clubs requested the league to find land that was suitable for the building of a new stadium. In September 1962, the VFL had secured a 212-acre (860,000 m²) block of grazing and market garden land in Mulgrave. This area was chosen because it was believed that with the effects of urban sprawl and the proposed building of the South-Eastern (later called Monash) freeway, the area would become the demographic centre of Melbourne. The VFL reportedly lobbied the state government to construct a train connection to the stadium, but this never occurred.\n\nThe original plans were for a stadium catering for up to 157,000 patrons, which would have made it one of the biggest stadiums in the world. To accommodate the large number of patrons the members' stand was to be extended around the whole ground. However, in 1982 and/or 1983 when the extensions were due to commence, the Government of Victoria (led by Victorian Premier John Cain who was a member of the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC)) refused to approve the plans for the upgrade because it would have threatened the Melbourne Cricket Ground's right to host the VFL Grand Final (the league owned VFL Park had originally been built with the intent of replacing the MCG as the permanent home of the grand final, but the Victorian government, with interests in the MCG, refused to allow its capacity upgrade). Hence, no further development ever occurred and the capacity was set at just over 100,000 patrons (later reduced to 72,000).\n\nThe playing surface of 200 metres long and 160 metres wide was the biggest in the league. This caused some controversy and the boundary lines were repainted and goals were relocated to make the playing area a similar size to the MCG's playing surface .\n\nUnder the direction of architect Reginald E. Padey, work was started at the site on 5 January 1966 when the VFL President Sir Kenneth Luke turned the first sod. On construction of the stadium, a total of of topsoil was excavated and the surface of the oval was lowered to a depth of from the surrounding area. The soil was used to form the banks for some sections of the stadium.\n\nThe foundations for the K.G. Luke stand were laid in 1969 and more than of solid concrete terracing was laid around the ground. Finally, on 18 April 1970, Fitzroy and Geelong played the first game at Waverley Park, to a crowd of 25,887. However, the stadium was far from completed. In fact the only section of the actual grandstand that was built was the first level of the K.G. Luke Stand. The rest of the stadium had only been completed on the ground level.\n\nThe Public Reserve Stands encircling the rest of the stadium were finished at a cost of $4.5 million in 1974 and the car parking was extended to fit a total of 25,000 cars. Lighting was added in May 1977, at a cost of $1.2 million, for the first of the 1977 night series televised matches. In 1982 a monochrome video matrix scoreboard was in operation at Waverley Park for the first time in VFL history, displaying instant replay highlights. In 1984 the arena was re-turfed and the drainage system upgraded. Two years later a mosaic mural perpetuating many great names of VFL football was installed on the grandstand facade above the members' entrance. During the 1988 season automatic turnstiles were introduced at the members' entrance.\n\n\nIn its history, 732 AFL/VFL matches were played at Waverley Park, 70 of which were finals and one a grand final.\n\nWaverley Park hosted many special events other than Australian rules football. These included:\n\nPerhaps the beginning of the end for Waverley Park was in 1988 when concrete cancer was discovered in the Southern Stand at the MCG. This provided the opportunity to replace the 50-year-old stand with a state of the art facility that was completed in 1992 at a cost of $150 million, subsequently named the Great Southern Stand. This affected Waverley Park's attendances as the ground once hosted many blockbuster games and finals, they were then mostly moved to the more modern, larger and more centrally located Melbourne Cricket Ground where the ground could handle up to 100,000 spectators compared to 72,000 at Waverley.\n\nIn 1999 the Australian Football League announced that it would not schedule any further matches at Waverley Park. Instead it would aim to\nsell the ground and its surrounding land, hoping to raise a sum of $30 – $80 million to go towards the construction of a new stadium under construction at Docklands at the western end of the Melbourne central business district. Later the League would also argue that a portion of the income from the sale of Waverley\nwould provide further finance for the development of AFL football as a national code in Australia. The last official AFL game was played in 1999 between Hawthorn and Sydney in front of a sell-out crowd of 72,130.\n\nAfter the decision to close the venue was made by the AFL, the ground's drawbacks were highlighted. Despite an excellent playing surface and its own water storage, focus shifted to its unfavourable position, and its antiquated corporate and spectator facilities, such as the 17-year-old sepia-toned video screen. Even though Waverley Park was only 20 minutes from the Melbourne CBD and was serviced by the Monash Freeway, successive governments had failed to provide adequate public transport to the venue. The stadium's car park was large enough to service its crowds, but the access roads were incapable of dispersing them, and long delays for driving spectators were common. Spectators felt distanced from the game in the huge arena, and seating was only partly undercover giving it the unflattering nickname \"Arctic Park\" which was due to its location on an exposed site, with the prevailing south-westerly winds bringing rain to Melbourne's eastern suburbs directly from Port Phillip.\n\nIn 2000, AFL pre-season cup matches were played at the venue, and Victorian Football League games also took place there, including finals and the grand final. Melbourne's Eastern Football League also played division 1 and division 2 Grand Finals at the venue at the conclusion of the 2000 season. The 2000 VFL Grand Final was the last official game of football played at the venue. After the 2000 VFL Grand Final, Waverley Park was not maintained and vandals broke onto the site smashed windows, sprayed graffiti on walls and one of the super boxes got trashed. The playing surface, once one of the best in Australia, was reduced to a field of weeds. Victorian MP Mary Delahunty called on the AFL to mow the dilapidated stadium, as it was still under their control.\n\nOn 10 December 2001 the AFL confirmed that the land was sold to housing developer Mirvac to assist in financing the construction of the now complete Docklands Stadium. The ground was demolished starting on 11 December 2002. While often seen as something of a failure, Waverley Park actually served an important strategic purpose for the VFL/AFL. With a viable alternative venue for the Grand Final and other events, the AFL possessed a critical bargaining chip in negotiations with the Melbourne Cricket Club over MCG access.\n\nFollowing its cessation as a venue for AFL football, the stadium fell into a state of disrepair, and anticipating complete demolition, the City of Greater Dandenong, on behalf of football patrons in southeast Victoria, moved quickly to nominate the whole of the facility and its grounds for heritage listing. The basis for the nomination is that the stadium was the first major stadium purpose built for Australian rules football, that its construction and ownership by the VFL provided the basis on which the league built its power base and eventual evolution to become the AFL, that it hosted the 1991 AFL Grand Final, that night time cricket games were first held at the ground, and that the members' (or K.G. Luke) stand features a mural of football legends by noted artist Harold Freedman. The state level heritage listing of Waverley Park has been cited by the Executive Director of Heritage Victoria as the seminal case for an understanding of the cultural heritage significance of 20th century places.\n\nSuccessful lobbying saw Heritage Victoria grant legislative protection to the site and, beginning in December 2002, portions of the stadium were demolished except for the members' stand and the members' stand mural. The surrounding car park has been replaced by suburban housing, including 1400 new dwellings for 3500 people. In homage to the original place and its purpose, the street layout mirrors the original car park and street names honour Waverley's patron Sir Kenneth Luke, architect Reginald Padey and other associations with football and cricket. The members' stand is visible from the nearby Monash Freeway, however due to new noise walls being installed on the freeway alignment, the stand's visibility from the freeway has been significantly reduced.\n\nThe oval itself and the remaining section of the members stand have been redeveloped into a state-of-the-art training and administrative facility for the Hawthorn Football Club and the local community. The facility incorporates an MCG-dimension oval, the size of the playing arena having been reduced from its original size, and includes a 25-metre heated indoor swimming pool, four refrigerated ice tanks, a gymnasium with a 60-metre running track and a warm-up area with projection and screen facilities to simulate match-day conditions. The grandstand has seating for around 2000 patrons with the seating in the top level of the grandstand having been retained.\n\n\n"}
