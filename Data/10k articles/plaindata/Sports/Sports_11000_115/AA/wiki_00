Founded in Seattle in 2007, ADNA began by training young tennis athletes, which evolved into sponsoring Select Junior Tennis players, and then expanded to manufacturing clothing for youth and adult tennis players. ADNA has since spread to professional tennis, and currently sponsors players on the ATP Tour & WTA Tour.\n\nAthletic DNA is run by former University of Illinois tennis player Mike Calkins, New Zealand Davis Cup representative; former University of Idaho tennis player Dan Willman; and Karl Wiersholm, father of nationally ranked junior tennis player Henrik Wiersholm. The company began in Seattle when founders Calkins and Willman partnered to form an academy for junior tennis players. The academy was successful, producing four No. 1 players in five years. Wiersholm then approached Willman and Calkins about branding what they had done with their junior tennis players. Weirsholm noticed that in the general population of tennis players their work ethic and character traits were changing while at his academy positive work ethics and character traits seemed to be essentially part of their DNA. This is what inspired the name Athletic DNA. With a noticeable lack of apparel targeted towards youth, ADNA began designing and manufacturing apparel for juniors and sponsoring the top young players in the sport.\nADNA manufactures clothing for juniors and adults, and introduced a new line of tennis apparel for women in January, 2012.\n\nSince most people involved in the company have an extensive tennis background, either through coaching or playing, ADNA heavily invests in the development of their sponsored players. Junior tennis players in the top 500 of rankings qualify for sponsorship and clothing discounts through the company’s Select Program, which is open to the public for application. The ADNA Select Program currently includes over 200 junior tennis players.\n\nADNA produces its clothing specifically for high-performance athletes. Their colors initially heavily leaned towards red, black and white. However, in recent line releases, their tops, bottoms, Hoodies and warm-ups expanded to a variety of designs and colors, and feature the recognizable ADNA “double helix” logo. The clothing is typically less traditional, abandoning the “country club” look, with bright colors and bold designs, and is geared toward comfort and performance as much as portraying attitude.\n\nIn addition to the over 500 juniors sponsored by ADNA, the company’s apparel is also seen on the ATP tour. A list of current and former ATP tennis players and coaches who are, or have been, sponsored by ADNA include:\n\nCurrent & Affiliated Pros: Lleyton Hewitt, Brian Baker, Alex Bogomolov Jr., Lauren Embree, Evan King, Daniel Kosakowski, Grace Min, Dennis Nevolo, Rajeev Ram, Tennys Sandgren, Samuel Groth, Danielle Lao, Daniel Nguyen, Jesse Witten, Derek Huang\n\nFormer Pros: Ryler DeHeart, Amer Delić, Peter Luczak, Robert Kendrick, Alun Jones, Phillip Simmonds\n\nCurrent Coaches: Nick Fustar, Tim Mayotte, Brad Stine, Peter Smith, Brian Wilson\n\nIn 2013, ADNA sponsored the United States Tennis Association Collegiate Team for the first time. It included Jarmere Jenkins, Dennis Novikov, Nicole Gibbs, & Lauren Embree among others.\n"}

{"id": "23762005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23762005", "title": "Biological passport", "text": "Biological passport\n\nAn athlete biological passport is an individual electronic record for professional athletes, in which profiles of biological markers of doping and results of doping tests are collated over a period of time. Doping violations can be detected by noting variances from an athlete’s established levels outside permissible limits, rather than testing for and identifying illegal substances.\n\nAlthough the terminology \"athlete passport\" is recent, the use of biological markers of doping has a long history in anti-doping. Maybe the first marker of doping, that tries to detect a prohibited substance not based on its presence in urine or blood, but through the induced deviations in biological parameters, is the so-called testosterone over epitestosterone ratio (T/E). The T/E has been used by sports authorities since the beginning of the 1980s to detect anabolic steroids in urine samples. A decade later, in 1997, markers of blood doping were introduced by some international federations, such as the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) and the Federation Internationale de Ski, to deter the abuse of recombinant erythropoietin that was undetectable by direct means at that time. It is only in 2002 that the concept of using biological markers to detect doping became known by the term \"athlete passport\". The merits of this testing paradigm were exposed in the scientific literature and the terminology adopted by the World Anti-Doping agency.\n\nMany believe that the athlete passport provides an excellent alternative to ensure fairness in elite sports. While a new drug test must be developed and validated for each new drug, the main advantage of the athlete passport is that it is based on the stability of the physiology of the human being. New drugs are produced at an unprecedented pace today and there is often a lag of several years between the availability of a new drug and the application of an effective detection method. In contrast, the physiology of the human being remains the same through several generations and all biomarkers developed today in the athlete passport will remain valid for at least several decades. For example, the blood module of the passport is already sensitive today to any new future form of recombinant erythropoietin, as well as to any form of gene doping that will enhance oxygen transfer to the muscles. Also, while a negative drug test does not necessarily mean that the athlete did not dope, the athlete can present his/her passport at the beginning of a competition to attest that he/she will compete in his/her natural, unaltered condition.\n\nThe athlete passport received a lot of attention when its blood module was established at the beginning of the 2008 racing season by the UCI. In May 2008 they revealed that 23 riders were under suspicion of doping following the first phase of blood tests conducted under the new biological passport.\nThe blood module of the athlete passport aims to detect any form of blood doping, the steroid module any form of doping with anabolic steroid and the endocrine module any modification of the growth hormone/IGF-1 axis. Each of these modules are however at different steps of development, validation and application in sports.\n\nAccording to the World Anti-Doping Agency, the athlete biological passport is administered to establish whether an athlete is manipulating his/her physiological variables without detecting a particular substance or method. The biological passport uses the standardized approach of urine sampling to determine steroid abuse. The objective of this testing is to identify athletes in a haematological module and a steroidal module.\n\nThe haematological module tests for certain markers in the body that identify the enhancement of oxygen transport. The specific markers the module tests for include haematocrit, haemoglobin, red blood cell count, percentage of reticulocytes, reticulocytes count, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, mean red cell distribution width, and immature reticulocyte fraction.\n\nThe steroidal module collects information on markers for steroid doping and aims to identify endogenous anabolic androgenic steroids. The specific markers the module tests for include testosterone, epitestosterone, the testosterone/epitestosterone ratio, androsterone, and etiocholanolone.\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency recently released the 2014 Prohibited Substances list and it will take effect on 1 January. In the new list, the agency modified the definitions of exogenous and endogenous steroids being tested for in the steroidal module of the biological passport.\n\nUnder the new rules, registered riders have to give the Union Cycliste Internationale daily information about their location and provide a one-hour window for possible testing. They have to submit a form every quarter year saying where they will be every day of the next quarter and they must notify the UCI if they change their whereabouts on any day. This means the whereabouts information provided in the whereabouts filings is accurate and sufficient in detail to enable any relevant Anti-Doping Organization to locate him for testing on any given day in that period of time. This is the most invasive testing programme in the history of any sport, but the UCI feels this invasion of privacy is justified as previously implemented anti-doping regimes have failed to detect every doping violation.\n\nThe biological passport programme has allowed the UCI to sanction riders for committing an anti-doping rule violation. Riders have also been targeted with further doping controls based on their biological passport.\n\nDuring the first three years of UCI's bio passport program 26 riders were found positive for EPO. In 20 out of the 26 cases, it was the abnormal blood profile which raised suspicions leading to a targeted doping test.\n\n\nThe International Association of Athletics Federations introduced their Athletes Biological Passport programme in 2009, and they announced the first sanction under the passport in May 2012. The Portuguese marathon runner Hélder Ornelas became the first track and field athlete to get suspended for doping based on the biological passport. He received a four-year suspension in May 2012.\n\nIn March 2014 the Spanish athletics federation cleared Marta Dominguez in a bio passport case. El Pais reported that IAAF were going to take the case to CAS.\nIn February 2014 IAAF announced they would appeal Aslı Çakır Alptekins ABP related doping case to CAS after the Turkish federation had cleared her. IAAF also suspended her provisionally. An IAAF spokesperson in January 2015 confirmed that Russian race walker Sergey Bakulin was provisionally suspended since December 2012 in an ABP related doping case. IAAF otherwise doesn't publicly announce provisional suspensions. In February 2015 Turkish press reported that Ümmü Kiraz, Bahar Doğan, Semiha Mutlu and Meliz Redif were under investigation in bio passport cases.\n\nIn 2012 USADA sanctioned the American triathlete Mark Fretta \"after variations in his individual longitudinal blood profile as well as other documentary evidence indicated the use of Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents\". Fretta received a four-year ban, and his results from 18 August 2010 onwards were annulled.\n\nIn 2014, the biological passport was introduced in the 2014 FIFA World Cup; blood and urine samples from all players before the competition and from two players per team and per match were analysed by the Swiss Laboratory for Doping Analyses.\n\n"}

In September 2012, the stadium was approved for $25 million in funding from the Minnesota Legislature. The remainder of the funding for the $64 million project was shared between the city and the Saints. \n\nThe construction of this new ballpark was prompted in part by the deteriorating state of the Saints' original ballpark, Midway Stadium, which was built in 1982. Midway Stadium was located in an industrial area of Saint Paul, near the Minnesota State Fairgrounds. A groundbreaking event was held by the Saints on May 10, 2014, with the first concrete being poured on the site. \n\nOn September 8, 2014, it was announced that local Fortune 100 business CHS Inc. had acquired the naming rights to the ballpark. The Saints played their first game at the park on May 18, 2015 against the Sioux City Explorers in an exhibition match. The first regular season game was against the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks on May 21, 2015.

Generally, the jaw portion of the skull, and specifically the point of the chin, is the area most vulnerable to a knock-out blow and therefore having an exceptional tolerance to punishment in this area is a great advantage to a fighter.\n\nA \"bad chin\", \"suspect chin\", or \"glass jaw\" refers to fighters with limited ability to absorb punishment to the chin or jaw. Many clubfighters and journeymen may have glass chins, although it may depend on weight class or sometimes legs. Some boxing experts, such as Teddy Atlas, believe it to be a mindframe. Additionally, some fighters have been known to have better chins as a result of moving up to a higher weight class.

The game is often played where marshmallows are readily available, such as around a campfire. Variations include similar-sounding phrases such as Fluffy Bunny, Fuzzy Bunny, and Chubby Monkey.\n\nAlthough the origins of the game are unknown, a 1959 \"Peanuts\" comic strip shows Snoopy's mouth being filled with an increasing number of marshmallows while Charlie Brown keeps count.\n\nIn the game, each participant usually places a marshmallow into their mouth and says 'chubby bunny'. If they are able to state the whole phrase, usually in a comprehensible manner that the other participants wholly concur to, they pass that round. Each successful player then adds an additional marshmallow to the ones already in his or her mouth and repeats the phrase. A player who fails to complete the phrase is eliminated from the game. The process continues until only one player remains. After the penultimate player loses the game, the winning player might have to place one more marshmallow into his or her mouth and may have to state the phrase once more. The winner of the game is the player who fits the most marshmallows into his or her mouth. Some variants of the game require the winner to actually ingest the marshmallows.\n\nAt least two people have died of suffocation from choking on marshmallows.\n\nOn June 4, 1999, 12-year-old Catherine \"Casey\" Fish died after choking on four marshmallows while playing Chubby Bunny. The contest was scheduled for the annual Care Fair held at Hoffman Elementary School in Chicago's North Shore area. It was to be supervised, but Casey and some of her friends began playing while the teacher was momentarily away. She collapsed, and was taken to Glenbrook Hospital, where she died a few hours later.

It was used for temporary exhibitions, and in winter, housed an ice skating rink.\n\nThe building was designed by Montreal architect John William Hopkins. It had an iron framework, a tinned barrel-vaulted nave and two galleries, each twenty feet wide, extending all the way around the interior. Its design was inspired by The Crystal Palace in London. Its main facades were of iron and glass. Its side walls were of white brick with rose-coloured contrast, with the iron and wood elements painted to match the brick. Its bays were subdivided by three arches, with only the centre arch glazed. Constructed in 20-foot modules, the Crystal Palace was intended to be 180 x 200 feet, but was constructed with shorter transepts, reducing its dimensions to 180 x 120 feet.\n\nThe Industrial Exhibition displayed agricultural and industrial products from the then British North America. The displays ranged from minerals, native woods, seeds and grains, preserved birds and fish, oils and foodstuffs to textiles and leather goods, furniture, clothing, machinery, iron work, tools and crafts. As part of the exhibition the Art Association of Montreal, the future Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, organized a display of Canadian art. The Prince of Wales visited Montreal that year and officially opened the exhibition.\n\nThe large open space of the exhibition hall was suitable for other uses. In later years, the hall would house a natural ice skating rink in the winter, and was one of the first indoor skating rinks in Canada. The skating rink was used by McGill University students to play ice hockey and the rink is the site of the first known photograph of ice hockey players in hockey uniforms, taken in 1881.\n\nThe rink also housed the Crystal Skating Club and Crystal Hockey Club, more commonly known as the Montreal Crystals which played men's senior-level amateur hockey in the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada.\n\nIn 1878 it was dismantled and moved to Fletcher's Field, part of which is now known as Jeanne-Mance Park. In July 1896, the Crystal Palace was destroyed by fire, as London's original Crystal Palace would be. The site of the Crystal Palace, between Mont-Royal Avenue and Saint-Joseph Boulevard, was developed for housing a few years after the fire.\n\nThe original downtown location later was home to the Palace Theatre, a movie house, and today contains an alley named Ruelle Palace.\n\nSee photographs at the McCord Museum website:\n"}

It is located in Enschede, Netherlands, at the Business & Science Park, near the University of Twente. The stadium has an all-seated capacity of 30,205 with a standard pitch heating system and has a promenade instead of fences around the stands. It hosted the final of the UEFA Women's Euro 2017.\n\nDe Grolsch Veste replaced the old Diekman Stadion as FC Twente's home ground on 22 March 1998. Plans had been afoot to expand and to renovate the old and now demolished Diekman Stadion. However, with a growing fan capacity and with arguments that the location of the Diekman stadium was not strategic enough, the idea was conceived to build a new arena for the FC Twente fans. The Diekman ground also faced problems with its seating plans as a result of previous FIFA regulations which imposed a necessity to construct a seating tribune behind each goal post.\n\nThe cost of the construction is estimated to have been around 33 million guilders and it took fourteen months to complete, with its foundation stone having been laid on 31 January 1997. Due to the tight budget available, the layout of the stadium was constructed in such a way that future expansions would be possible without the necessity to tear down entire stands.\n\nThe first match played at the stadium was a 3–0 victory by the home team against PSV on 10 May 1998 in an Eredivisie match. The first goal in the new stadium was scored in the 14th minute by FC Twente player Chris De Witte.\n\nOn 1 October 2006, the stadium was updated with two big flatscreen video-walls.\n\nIn May 2008 the Arke Stadion was renamed to De Grolsch Veste with beer brewery Grolsch as sponsor. The brewery is located in the club's hometown Enschede. The name \"Veste\" (fortress) is a reference to Groenlo, a former fortified town that was often besieged and where Grolsch was first brewed.\n\nOn 5 September 2009 for the first time ever an international (friendly) match was played in the FC Twente stadium when the Netherlands beat Japan 3–0.\n\nIn 2006 plans were unfolded to increase the stadium capacity to 24,000 seats. The expansion started in January 2008 and was completed in September 2008, just in time for the start of the 2008–2009 season.\n\nFC Twente is aiming to start a new phase in the stadium expansion in the summer of 2011 which will result in a capacity of 32,000 seats.\n\nAs part of the combined Netherlands and Belgium bid to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the stadium was one of five stadiums in the Netherlands selected by the KNVB to host games. This would mean that the stadium capacity needed to be expanded to the minimum required seating of 44,000.\n\nThe city of Enschede announced on 11 September 2009 that it would officially be a candidate city and that it would fully support FC Twente's ambition to expand the stadium capacity to the minimum required seating of 44,000. In December 2009, IAA Architecten released computer generated images of the proposed 44,000+ stadium with an arched 3rd tier, to complete the main stand.\n\nThe Grolsch Veste was expanded during the summer of 2011. On 7 July, when working on the construction of the stand, the roof suddenly collapsed, killing two workers and injuring 14 people. The collapse was probably caused by too much weight on the unfinished roof. After an investigation of a month, the roof was taken away and work continued. FC Twente played the first few competition matches partly without a roof. The new stadium was officially opened on 29 October with a competition match against PSV Eindhoven (2-2). A year after the accident, a monument was unveiled.\n"}

{"id": "944363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=944363", "title": "Fair catch", "text": "Fair catch\n\nA fair catch is a feature of American football and several other codes of football, in which a player attempting to catch a ball kicked by the opposing team – either on a kickoff or punt – is entitled to catch the ball without interference from any member of the kicking team. A ball caught in this manner becomes dead once caught, i.e., the player catching the ball is not entitled to run with the ball in an attempt to gain yardage, and the receiving team begins its drive at the spot where the ball was caught. A player wishing to make a fair catch signals his intent by extending one arm above his head and waving it while the kicked ball is in flight. The kicking team must allow the player an opportunity to make the catch without interference.\n\nThe primary reason for the fair catch rule is to protect the receiver. A receiver directs his attention toward the incoming punt and cannot focus on the defenders running towards him. He is quite vulnerable to injury and is also at risk for fumbling or muffing the kicked ball if the punter intentionally makes a high short kick to allow defenders time to hit the receiver. A second reason for a fair catch, on a punted ball, is to prevent the ball from rolling toward the receiving team's goal and being downed deep in the team's own territory.\n\nThe XFL removed the fair catch in an effort to attract fans who disliked the rule. Canadian football and arena football also do not have fair catch rules, with the XFL and Canadian football preferring a five-yard \"no-yards\" rule instead.\n\nIn rugby union and Australian rules football, a loose equivalent to a fair catch is called a \"mark\"; see mark (rugby) and mark (Australian football) for more information (however in Australian Rules Football the player is not protected from the opposition team while attempting a mark). Fair catches featured in some extinct forms of football, and they have been abolished in other modern codes. In Rugby League the defensive player attempting to catch the ball cannot be tackled whilst in the air, though the attacking players can contest the ball by attempting to catch it themselves. A player who successfully catches the ball is able to be tackled only once they have landed on the ground. A player who does not leave the ground in attempting to catch the ball is able to be tackled as soon as the ball is caught.\n\nIn American football, a member of the team receiving a punt or kick, may signal for a \"fair catch\". This is the receiver's choice in which he gives up the right to advance the ball in exchange for protection from being tackled when he is focusing on the incoming ball and thus vulnerable to serious injury.\n\nTo signal a fair catch the receiver must raise one arm fully above his head and wave it from side to side while the ball is in flight. If the receiver fails to give a proper signal (arm not fully extended) the receiving team is penalized five yards for an invalid fair catch signal, marked from the spot of the signal, and the player is not protected from being tackled.\n\nAn opponent tackling or making any contact with a receiver who has given a fair catch signal is guilty of a personal foul carrying a 15-yard penalty. If the interference is deemed flagrant, the kicking team member can also be ejected from the game.\n\nIf the receiver attempts to advance the ball after signalling for a fair catch he is penalized five yards for \"delay of game\", because the fair caught ball becomes dead once caught.\n\nRegardless of whether a fair catch signal is made, no opponent may interfere with anyone attempting to catch the kicked ball, his path to the ball, or with the flight of the ball. This is the foul of \"Kick Catching Interference\" which is a \"personal foul\" carrying a 15-yard penalty. If the interference is deemed flagrant, the kicking team member can also be ejected from the game.\n\nA player signaling for a fair catch is not required to catch the ball; however, after making the signal, he may not initiate contact with any member of the kicking team until the ball is touched by another player. If he does he will be penalized 15 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct. If the ball hits the ground or a member of the kicking team, the fair catch is off and rules for kicked balls apply. If the receiver \"muffs\" the ball (touches it, but then fails to obtain control of the ball), then the ball can be recovered by either team once the ball touches the ground.\n\nA fair catch may be followed by a snap or a type of free kick — the fair catch kick — at his team's choice, and an expired playing period may be extended if the free kick is chosen. The NCAA abolished the fair catch from its version of American football in 1950, but restored it in 1951, minus the option of kicking from the mark of the catch, which is retained in rules of the National Federation of State High School Associations and the National Football League. \n\nIf the kicking team commits kick catching interference on a returner who has given a valid fair catch signal, the receiving team retains the right to a fair catch kick from the yard line where the ball is spotted following the penalty. \n\nThe fair catch signal can be used as a legal form of deception: If the receiver has no intention of actually fielding the ball, but wishes it to roll into the end zone for a touchback, he may signal for a fair catch in front of where the ball will land, making the kicking team think it will not reach the end zone.\n\nA fair catch on a kickoff return is used primarily on short kickoffs to prevent a ball kicked high in the air from being recovered by the kicking team. Since the 2018 college football season, fair catches are now commonly employed on kickoffs that do not reach the end zone, but are perceived (for whatever reason) as having little potential for a successful return. This was the result of an NCAA rule change which treats a fair catch on a kickoff between the receiving team's goal line and 25-yard line as a touchback, with the ball being placed on the 25.\n\nVarious forms of football descended from certain English school football games of the 19th century have had a fair catch. It was abolished early in the development of soccer, then in the middle of the 20th century by Canadian football, and slightly later by rugby league. Forms of football retaining a form of fair catch (also called \"mark\") include American (outdoor), rugby union, and Australian rules. The American-invented intramural games speedball and speed-a-way have some of the flavor of the original fair catch, which was to allow handling of the ball in games where handling was otherwise forbidden. Australian rules, speedball, and speed-a-way do not require that the kick be from an opponent. American football requires that the catcher signal in advance, as did Canadian football before that game abolished the fair catch. Rugby union requires a player to signal a fair catch by catching the ball and shouting \"Mark!\".\n\nIn some forms of football a player fielding an opponent's kick must be given a certain circular unobstructed space around him in which to do so by either some or all opponents. In rugby union, rugby league, and Canadian football this applies only against members of the kicking team who are offside, and applies whether the ball is in the air, bouncing, or rolling. In Arena Football, there is no fair catch; however all members of the kicking team must refrain from penetrating the five-yard line in coverage, but only while the ball is in the air.\n\nThe various games differ as to the conditions under which a fair catch will be awarded — for example, whether the ball must be caught \"cleanly\", i.e. without juggling. Rugby union requires a clean catch. American football allows the ball to be juggled, but not to be intentionally batted forward to improve the position of the catch (as for a free kick at goal). Australian rules is most generous, allowing unlimited hand play with the ball before it is caught, and allowing the kick to be from any other player, regardless of team (however, the ball must have travelled 15 metres) and the ball can even be dropped so long as the player is deemed to have sufficient control of its fall. In the 19th century in rugby, and into the 20th in American and Canadian football, a fair catch was allowed from certain kicks of a teammate—a punt-out or punt-on.\n\n"}

It has a seating capacity of 12,000; this was temporarily expanded to 17,000 during 1974–75, while the Seattle Sounders, of the North American Soccer League, played at Memorial Stadium, before moving to the newly constructed Kingdome. Similarly, an A-League reincarnation of the Sounders franchise played at Memorial Stadium, before moving to Qwest/CenturyLink Field. It currently hosts Seattle School District high school football games and adult recreational leagues, and is the home field for Seattle Reign FC of the National Women's Soccer League and the Seattle Cascades of the American Ultimate Disc League.\n\nThe stadium was designed by Seattle architect George W. Stoddard, also known for his work on the Green Lake Aqua Theater and the south stands of Husky Stadium. The stadium opened on September 26, 1947, during a \"jamboree\" featuring eight of the city's high school football teams. Memorial Stadium was dedicated later that year in memory of the Seattle youth who gave their lives in World War II. A memorial wall at the east end is inscribed with the names of over 700 fallen individuals. The following year, the stadium hosted first widespread local television broadcast in the Puget Sound region, the Turkey Day high school football game between West Seattle and Wenatchee.\n\nThe stadium was the venue for much of the opening ceremonies for the Century 21 Exposition, a World's Fair held in Seattle in 1962. In 1967, it became the first high school stadium in the country to install artificial turf.\n\nIn 1992, the scoreboard was replaced and the field was rededicated as \"Leon H. Brigham Field\", in tribute to the long-time high school football coach who pushed to build Memorial Stadium while serving as the Seattle School District's first Director of Athletics.\n\nIn 2017, the Seattle School District and the city of Seattle announced plans to build a new high school and stadium at Seattle Center in response to major population growth in downtown Seattle. While no timetable has been set for construction, and no site has yet been chosen, the current Memorial Stadium site was seen as a likely location for the new project because the city and school district had agreed in 2009 that the current stadium should be torn down.\nThe facility is not operated by the Seattle Center itself, but is owned by the Seattle School District and still serves as the \"home field\" for some high school football games played within the district. Memorial Stadium also hosted the first AAA (now 4A) state championship game for high school football in 1973, the first year of the state playoff system. The top-ranked Wenatchee Panthers were upset by the Kentridge Chargers, 26–24. Entering the title game, Wenatchee had given up just seven points all season and had been the top team in the state polls for four years.\n\nAs well as hosting two iterations of the Sounders franchise, Memorial Stadium has served as home to several other pro and semi-pro sports teams. The Seattle Majestics, a women's American football team, played home games at Memorial Stadium from 2007 to 2009 before moving to French Field in nearby Kent. Beginning with the 2014 season, Memorial Stadium became the home to Seattle's NWSL soccer team, Seattle Reign FC. The stadium's capacity is limited to 6,000 for Reign matches. As of 2015, the AUDL's Seattle Cascades use the stadium for the majority of their home games. In addition, the stadium hosts adult recreational league soccer and flag football.\n\nMemorial Stadium serves as the finish for the Amica Insurance Seattle Marathon.\n\nThe stadium is also used periodically for concerts, particularly in connection with festivals held at the Center, like Bumbershoot.\n\n"}

In 2016, the 55th Mondial attracted around 15,000 participants and 150,000 spectators.\n\nThe Mondial was first held in July 1961 with the support of the daily newspaper \"La Marseillaise\", after which the event is named.

{"id": "841074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=841074", "title": "Muscle fatigue", "text": "Muscle fatigue\n\nMuscle fatigue is the decline in ability of a muscle to generate force. It can be a result of vigorous exercise but abnormal fatigue may be caused by barriers to or interference with the different stages of muscle contraction. There are two main causes of muscle fatigue: the limitations of a nerve’s ability to generate a sustained signal (neural fatigue) and the reduced ability of the muscle fiber to contract (metabolic fatigue).\n\nMuscle cells work by detecting a flow of electrical impulses from the brain which signals them to contract through the release of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Fatigue (reduced ability to generate force) may occur due to the nerve, or within the muscle cells themselves.\n\nNerves are responsible for controlling the contraction of muscles, determining the number, sequence and force of muscular contraction. Most movements require a force far below what a muscle could potentially generate, and barring pathological nervous fatigue, is seldom an issue. But in extremely powerful contractions that are close to the upper limit of a muscle's ability to generate force, nervous fatigue (enervation), in which the nerve signal weakens, can be a limiting factor in untrained individuals.\n\nIn novice strength trainers, the muscle's ability to generate force is most strongly limited by nerve’s ability to sustain a high-frequency signal. After a period of maximum contraction, the nerve’s signal reduces in frequency and the force generated by the contraction diminishes. There is no sensation of pain or discomfort, the muscle appears to simply ‘stop listening’ and gradually cease to move, often going backwards. As there is insufficient stress on the muscles and tendons, there will often be no delayed onset muscle soreness following the workout.\n\nPart of the process of strength training is increasing the nerve's ability to generate sustained, high frequency signals which allow a muscle to contract with its greatest force. It is this neural training that causes several weeks worth of rapid gains in strength, which level off once the nerve is generating maximum contractions and the muscle reaches its physiological limit. Past this point, training effects increase muscular strength through myofibrilar or sarcoplasmic hypertrophy and metabolic fatigue becomes the factor limiting contractile force.\n\nThough not universally used, ‘metabolic fatigue’ is a common term for the reduction in contractile force due to the direct or indirect effects of two main factors:\n\nSubstrates within the muscle serve to power muscular contractions. They include molecules such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glycogen and creatine phosphate. ATP binds to the myosin head and causes the ‘ratchetting’ that results in contraction according to the sliding filament model. Creatine phosphate stores energy so ATP can be rapidly regenerated within the muscle cells from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ions, allowing for sustained powerful contractions that last between 5–7 seconds. Glycogen is the intramuscular storage form of glucose, used to generate energy quickly once intramuscular creatine stores are exhausted, producing lactic acid as a metabolic byproduct.\n\nSubstrate shortage is one of the causes of metabolic fatigue. Substrates are depleted during exercise, resulting in a lack of intracellular energy sources to fuel contractions. In essence, the muscle stops contracting because it lacks the energy to do so.\n\nMetabolites are the substances (generally waste products) produced as a result of muscular contraction. They include chloride, potassium, lactic acid, ADP, magnesium (Mg), reactive oxygen species, and inorganic phosphate. Accumulation of metabolites can directly or indirectly produce metabolic fatigue within muscle fibers through interference with the release of calcium (Ca) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum or reduction of the sensitivity of contractile molecules actin and myosin to calcium.\n\nIntracellular chloride partially inhibits the contraction of muscles. Namely, it prevents muscles from contracting due to \"false alarms\", small stimuli which may cause them to contract (akin to myoclonus). This natural brake helps muscles respond solely to the conscious control or spinal reflexes but also has the effect of reducing the force of conscious contractions.\n\nHigh concentrations of potassium (K) also causes the muscle cells to decrease in efficiency, causing cramping and fatigue. Potassium builds up in the t-tubule system and around the muscle fiber as a result of action potentials. The shift in K changes the membrane potential around the muscle fiber. The change in membrane potential causes a decrease in the release of calcium (Ca) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.\n\nIt was once believed that lactic acid build-up was the cause of muscle fatigue. The assumption was lactic acid had a \"pickling\" effect on muscles, inhibiting their ability to contract. Though the impact of lactic acid on performance is now uncertain, it may assist or hinder muscle fatigue.\n\nProduced as a by-product of fermentation, lactic acid can increase intracellular acidity of muscles. This can lower the sensitivity of contractile apparatus to Ca but also has the effect of increasing cytoplasmic Ca concentration through an inhibition of the chemical pump that actively transports calcium out of the cell. This counters inhibiting effects of potassium on muscular action potentials. Lactic acid also has a negating effect on the chloride ions in the muscles, reducing their inhibition of contraction and leaving potassium ions as the only restricting influence on muscle contractions, though the effects of potassium are much less than if there were no lactic acid to remove the chloride ions. Ultimately, it is uncertain if lactic acid reduces fatigue through increased intracellular calcium or increases fatigue through reduced sensitivity of contractile proteins to Ca.\n\nLactic acid is now used as a measure of endurance training effectiveness and VO2 max.\nMuscle weakness may be due to problems with the nerve supply, neuromuscular disease (such as myasthenia gravis) or problems with muscle itself. The latter category includes polymyositis and other muscle disorders.\n\nMuscle fatigue may be due to precise molecular changes that occur \"in vivo\" with sustained exercise. It has been found that the ryanodine receptor present in skeletal muscle undergoes a conformational change during exercise, resulting in \"leaky\" channels that are deficient in calcium release. These \"leaky\" channels may be a contributor to muscle fatigue and decreased exercise capacity.\n\nFatigue has been found to play a big role in limiting performance in just about every individual in every sport. In research studies, participants were found to show reduced voluntary force production in fatigued muscles (measured with concentric, eccentric, and isometric contractions), vertical jump heights, other field tests of lower body power, reduced throwing velocities, reduced kicking power and velocity, less accuracy in throwing and shooting activities, endurance capacity, anaerobic capacity, anaerobic power, mental concentration, and many other performance parameters when sport specific skills are examined.\n\nElectromyography is a research technique that allows researchers to look at muscle recruitment in various conditions, by quantifying electrical signals sent to muscle fibers through motor neurons. In general, fatigue protocols have shown increases in EMG data over the course of a fatiguing protocol, but reduced recruitment of muscle fibers in tests of power in fatigued individuals. In most studies, this increase in recruitment during exercise correlated with a decrease in performance (as would be expected in a fatiguing individual).\n\nMedian power frequency is often used as a way to track fatigue using EMG. Using the median power frequency, raw EMG data is filtered to reduce noise and then relevant time windows are Fourier Transformed. In the case of fatigue in a 30-second isometric contraction, the first window may be the first second, the second window might be at second 15, and the third window could be the last second of contraction (at second 30). Each window of data is analyzed and the median power frequency is found. Generally, the median power frequency decreases over time, demonstrating fatigue. Some reasons why fatigue is found are due to action potentials of motor units having a similar pattern of repolarization, fast motor units activating and then quickly deactivating while slower motor units remain, and conduction velocities of the nervous system decreasing over time.\n\n"}

It was primarily used for baseball, and was the home field of the Oakland Oaks Pacific Coast League baseball team. It opened in 1913 and held 7,000 people. The Oaks played there until 1955.\nThe ballpark was located within the city limits of Emeryville, between Oakland and Berkeley. The site was on the block bounded by 45th Street (north, first base); San Pablo Avenue (east, third base); Park Avenue (south, left field); and Watts Street (west, right field). The stadium did not front directly on San Pablo where a strip of various small commercial buildings stood, now replaced by a single one-story commercial building with several chain businesses.\n\nOaks Park was highly accessible, as a major streetcar line ran on San Pablo Avenue, and a station serving several of the Key System's transbay commuter rail lines existed a few blocks south at Yerba Buena Avenue.\n\nThe Oaks had been playing most of their home games (except Thursdays and Sunday mornings) at Recreation Park in San Francisco, starting when that new ballpark opened in 1907. Even after moving back to Oakland, the Oaks would play a number of games each year in San Francisco. PCL founding father J. Cal Ewing owned both the Oaks and the San Francisco Seals from 1903 until sometime in the 1920s, at which point the Oaks began playing all their games in Oakland.\n\nThe park was not well maintained in its later years, causing a steep decline in attendance. These factors forced the Oaks to move to Vancouver in 1956. That move proved prescient, as the New York Giants moved to San Francisco two years later and would have likely displaced the Oaks in any event.\n\nUntil recently, the site of the park was partly an empty, fenced-off lot, with Pixar Studios overlapping it where Watts Street used to run through. Currently it is part of the Phase II of Pixar Studios expansion and will be a parking lot with a public bicycle path and park on the San Pablo side of the property.\n\n\n"}

It was most recently home to the Texas AirHogs, a professional baseball team and member of the American Association, and the West Texas A&M Buffaloes baseball team, which is a member of the Division II Lone Star Conference. It was home to the Amarillo Dillas of United League Baseball until 2010. It broke ground in 1948, and opened in 1949. It is nicknamed \"Dilla Villa\", dating back prior to Amarillo National Bank's purchase of naming rights when the Dillas made their first appearance in Amarillo in 1994.\n\nFollowing the 2016 season it was announced the AirHogs would not be returning to Amarillo citing “deplorable” field conditions.\n\nThe Potter County Memorial Stadium was home to several minor league baseball clubs before hosting the modern Amarillo Dillas squad. In PCMS's first season to host baseball, the Amarillo Gold Sox were in business. The Gold Sox would spend 1959–1965 and 1976–1982 hosting AA professional baseball in the Texas League. The Gold Sox had also played in Class A and B leagues in 1955–1958.\n\nThere are several features of the Amarillo National Bank Dilla Villa that are architecturally unique. The stadium however is one of the few classic stadiums left from the older baseball era and unfortunately is dealing with its share of difficulties.\n\nThe Amarillo National Dilla Villa seats 8,500 people, with three levels of seating. It features 17 field level box seat sections. Situated just above the box seats, are the club level seats. These seats range from sections A to M, and house the better majority of the stadiums seats. The stadium features two general admission bleacher sections on the first and third base sides. Directly behind home plate in the upper level are 4 levels of luxury boxes used for groups and parties. On either side of the home plate luxury boxes are sections of the blue fold down seats, the only covered seats that are fold down. Aside from the main grandstand, metal bleachers and box seats sit further down the third base line, and a party deck further down the first base line.\n\nThe Dilla Villa houses one of the few non-major league stadiums in the country to have an upper and lower level concourse. The lower level concourse is the major one, leading to the main grandstand. It also houses 5 concession stands, 2 bars, and a souvenir shop. The upper level concourse is only accessible from the upper level, or from two staircases at the front of the ballpark. The concourse houses a beer stand, a concession stand, and the stadiums' bathrooms. No smoking is allowed in the ballpark, but there is a designated section behind the metal bleachers along the third base line.\n\nThe Potter County Memorial Stadium underwent a major renovation in the winter of 2005, replacing many of the badly needed renovations. The Central League's Dillas left behind many problems that the United League's Dillas successfully tackled. Numerous seats in the stands were broken, cracked, or were stolen. Bleachers in the upper section had been separated and the paint was chipped. The grass was in poor shape, and the field itself was in bad shape. The backstop behind home plate was wooden, and was also rotting, and there were also numerous holes in the nets. Despite easily redoing these problems for the United League team, problems have begun to plague the Dillas.\n\nThe Dillas were left with a barely active, older electronic scoreboard, which was in use back in the early 1990s. They made do with the scoreboard until the 2007 season, in which they bought a smaller, standard scoreboard just displaying score, inning, and strike-ball-out counts. Before the 2008 season began, a circuit board was stolen out of the scoreboard, which made it inoperable. The manufacturer would not sell the Dillas a new one because the scoreboard had never been paid for. Nonpayment of the scoreboard was due to the bankruptcy of the ULB's President Bradley Wendt.\n\nSeveral problems have existed with the field lighting fixtures and the concourse lighting at the Dilla Villa. Problems became apparent after a game between the Dillas and the Coyotes was cancelled after hurricane-like weather blew in. That night, two of the transformers powering the Dilla Villa exploded. Afterwards, three subsequent games were cancelled due to light failures at the stadium.\n\nRumors of a new ballpark being built along the Interstate 27 and Hollywood Road parts of Amarillo have been spurred by the serious advancement in the revitalization of downtown Amarillo, Texas. Several case studies were conducted on whether or not a new ballpark would be feasible in downtown Amarillo. The study revealed that a multipurpose event venue such as a ballpark would be a feasible investment. Some rendering of a possible downtown set-up have shown a ballpark just south of the Amarillo Civic Center at 8th Avenue and Buchanan St. A ballpark, along with many other projects, have become serious discussion and construction could take place as soon as 2016.\n\n"}

{"id": "20892221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20892221", "title": "Skishing", "text": "Skishing\n\nSkishing is a variant on saltwater shorefishing that involves wearing a buoyant wetsuit and swimming out from shore with flippers to fish with rod and reel (typically a surfcasting rod), often using live eels. It is practiced as a means of getting further out to sea in order to increase the chances of catching a fish and can be dangerous. The term skishing is a portmanteau of water-skiing and fishing because when hooked the stripers pull the angler through the water. Skishing has been described as extreme surfcasting.\n\nOne enthusiast of skishing believes that \"hard core\" surf casters aren't fond of the activity and consider it cheating.\n\nSkishing was the subject of an article in \"Forbes\" magazine. The activity was invented by Paul Melnyk, a cabinet maker from Montauk, New York. Melnyk, has explained that the activity is similar of skiing because \"if you hook a fish over thirty pounds, it will generally take you for a ride\".\n\nA description of skishing on Stripercoast Surfcasters web forum as told by Jacob Freeman.\n\n\" It really has to be experienced to be understood, but it's definitely not for everyone. I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is not at least a little crazy. But for me, skishing is to surfcasting, as a hurricane is to a windy day.\n\nTo be immersed in the element that holds your quarry, bass sometimes swimming so close to you that you can kick them, feeling the raw power of a big bass pull you around, wrestling one on one with a big fish in their element is unreal. They don't give up when they're still in the water, and you can't lift a big bass out of the water when you're swimming, so it can become a friggen wrestling match until you get your hook out if the fish is still green. I always crush the barbs of my hooks for an easier release anyway, so sometimes you can just give them some slack and they'll release themselves if it's just a lip hook. With an 11' rod, you really have a lot more leverage than most would think, and with some practice you can horse a fish in (or pull yourself closer to it) rather quickly.\n\nSkishing also provides the surfcaster with access to many very fishy areas that are not accessible from shore or frequented by boats due to the hazardous rocks and reefs. How many times have you been standing on a rock or on the beach and the fish are busting beyond your casting range? That's frustrating. Skishing lets you get out to where they are.\"\n\nSKISHING description by Paul Melnyk - Montauk, N.Y.: \"It was an extraordinary feeling for me to be floating weightless in this dynamic sea, and I felt as thought I had shed every pound of excess baggage as I rode the tide . . . Fighting a substantial fish while swimming is a unique experience. A balance must be achieved between the hunter and the prey. Any variation to this equilibrium causes a loss of control as the fish pulls. I was kicking hard to keep myself upright, fighting the fish while using my whole body as leverage. . . A swarm of splashing bodies soon surrounded me.\" \n\n"}

The home venue of the Pacific Tigers was constructed in 1950 for football and later hosted women's soccer; it was closed in 2012 and demolished two years later.\n\nPacific Memorial Stadium was built in 1950 after the successful fund drive which netted $165,000. Most of this money was through the sale of pre-ordered tickets (scrip), which were usable over a 10-year period. Construction began on the earth-filled structure in May 1950. Astonishingly, it was finished on time for the home opener (fifth game of the season) on October 21, a build time of less than six months.\n\nThe stadium originally seated 35,975 with room for expansion to over 44,000, but renovations reduced the capacity to a configuration of 28,000. It was the venue for a 1997 friendly match between the Brazil National Football Team and the Honduras National Football Team. Notably Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima commonly or simply known as Ronaldo, scored 6 goals as Brazil ran out 8–2 winners.\nThe Pacific Club, which was added to the east-side of the stadium in 1973, was donated by Alex Spanos at a cost of $250,000. It sat up to 300, featuring glass walls and a great view of the stadium. When not in use for sporting events, it also held many university functions and gatherings. The scoreboard in the north end zone was erected in 1982 at a cost of $140,000 and measured .\n\nThanks to donations from athletic boosters, lighting power at the stadium was upgraded from 35 to 75 footcandles in August 1986.\n\nPacific Memorial Stadium was officially renamed in 1988, to Amos Alonzo Stagg Memorial Stadium on October 15, to honor Amos Alonzo Stagg. He ended his coaching career at \"College of the Pacific\" in 1946 and donated the land for the stadium to be built in 1950. Stagg is widely regarded as a pioneer in the development of sport, not only in football, but also in basketball and baseball.\n\nOn February 26, 2012, the university announced it would close Stagg Memorial Stadium to conduct a feasibility study to assess needed repairs, upgrades and changes required to make the facility meet modern standards in conjunction with a financial assessment to determine if the stadium could be repaired or if it should be replaced.\n\nThe university began removal of Stagg Memorial Stadium on February 24, 2014, to make room for new athletics facilities, including a dedicated tennis center with 12 courts and a clubhouse, and new fields for soccer and field hockey. The first Pacific field hockey home game on the new turf field at University of the Pacific was played on September 12, 2014 versus the University of Albany. The groundbreaking ceremony for the Eve Zimmerman Tennis Center was held on October 17, 2014.\n\nThe stadium was home to the Pacific Tigers football program, beginning in 1950, until it was discontinued following the 1995 season. For many years it was also the home football field for nearby Stagg High School. The stadium was the sole home to the women's soccer team until its closure in 2012.\n"}

The band of material is often elasticized to prevent the material around the foot from tearing. Stirrup pants were originally sportswear for women, and remain sportswear for horse riding and skiing. However, they have come in and out of fashion during the 20th and early 21st centuries, peaking in popularity as street fashion during the 1980s.\n\nStirrup pants were first worn as jodhpurs for horse riders. The purpose of the strap under the foot was to hold the pant legs in place in the boots of the rider. As ladies moved away from riding sidesaddle, they began wearing riding breeches in the 1920s in a similar style to those worn by men. By 1934, Jodhpurs as riding pants with foot straps were being advertised in the United States mail order catalogue for Sears. Horse riding breeches are still made with an elastic foot strap in some designs. Stirrup pants for skiing were introduced at the 1936 Winter Olympic Games in Germany.\n\nStirrup stretch pants were a mainstay of ski wear for both men and women during most of the 1960s and part of the 1970s. In the 1960s this style was used for women's and girls' stirrup pants. They were popular for several years as shown in clothing catalogs of the day, such as J.C. Penny, Sears, and Montgomery Ward.\n\nStirrup pants became a popular casual fashion for women in Europe and America from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s. In 1985, Linda Pender wrote in \"Cincinnati Magazine\" that stirrup pants were \"being touted as \"the\" wardrobe basic of the year, and \"every\"body is buying them\". On the one hand, the style was promoted as being \"easy to wear\" and giving \"most figures a long, lean line\"; on the other hand, a salesclerk pointed out to Pender that the style was not flattering unless the wearer was \"slim and fit\". Leggings in general became fashionable streetwear during the 1980s, as did sweatshirts, leg warmers, and other items that originated in sports and dance studios.\n\nFrom about 2010 on, stirrup pants, stretch or not, have become just another style of pants for use by women and men for sports, running or general wear.\n"}
