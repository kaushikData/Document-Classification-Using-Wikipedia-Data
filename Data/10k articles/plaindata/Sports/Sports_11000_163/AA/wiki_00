{"id": "5320597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5320597", "title": "BadJocks.com", "text": "BadJocks.com\n\nBadJocks.com is a website that covers sports-related misconduct and crime at all levels, from professional to children's, by not only the athletes themselves but coaches and spectators as well. Creator and content provider Bob Reno has since 2000 written daily items on not only well-covered events such as the rape charges against three Duke lacrosse players and the Minnesota Vikings \"love boat\" scandal but less-reported local events as well, with video clips sometimes included. While the site's news and audience are primarily U.S.-based, foreign news, particularly soccer-related, has been covered as well. He bills the site as \"Where \"COPS\" Meets \"SportsCenter\"\". In 2008 \"Time\" chose the site as one of 25 in its first annual blog index, and in 2009 \"Sports Illustrated\" named the site one of the decade's five most influential blogs.\n\nGenerally, the site's tone is light-hearted, featuring Reno's acerbic commentary on the various occurrences culled from other media. Reno keeps an annual tally of several types of stories that occur on frequent basis each year, with three (\"drunken outbursts\", \"naughty cheerleaders\" and \"streakers and naked people\" at the moment) typifying much of the content. However, the fourth, high school coach sex scandals, have been treated more and more seriously by Reno as many involve relations between adults and students, and he was taken aback when these numbers regularly approached 200 each year, so much that he stopped keeping count in 2007. He has sometimes posted commentary and analysis of the phenomenon, with input from readers. He followed the Pamela Rogers Turner case closely since she was a gym teacher, and also the Debra Lafave case, which like non-athletics-related scandals he had devoted considerable space to on BadJocks's sister site, DumbAssDaily.com. In the former, Reno posted a cell-phone cam video of Rogers dancing provocatively, one of several attempts to contact her victim that had gotten her parole revoked, as well as her MySpace, which officials there had taken down.\n\nIn 2005, Reno began searching on Webshots using the search strings \"initiation\" or, less frequently, \"hazing\". These eventually yielded albums of members of various colleges' sports teams putting freshman members through hazing rituals. Many of these involved women's teams, and Reno posted the pictures on his website in case the originals were taken down. Most featured the players wearing lingerie outside their clothes and with various things, some obscene, written on their bodies with marker as they performed some humiliating task. The Catholic University of America was seriously embarrassed by photos showing their school's women's lacrosse team cavorting with a thong-clad male stripper, and later suspended the entire team for three games.\n\nSince some showed alcohol consumption by students who were underage, in violation of liquor laws and school policies, investigations were started by the respective colleges. Most stopped short of finding any serious wrongdoing and gave the students involved the benefit of the doubt.\n\nHowever, in May 2006 a reader of the site found pictures of the Northwestern University women's soccer team putting its freshmen through hazing more serious than other colleges, and Reno posted them. The young women were shown drinking tequila and other hard liquor and going through similar rituals as their counterparts elsewhere, with penises drawn on them in marker. In some shots, though, they were blindfolded had their hands tied behind their backs with duct tape and were apparently performing simulated sex acts and giving fully clothed lap dances to players on the men's soccer team.\n\nOther sites started making similar searches and posting the results. Reno merely linked to those, but the media often mistakenly credited BadJocks anyway.\n\nThe publication of the photos led to the coach's resignation. Northwestern suspended the team. Reno and the site earned national attention. Many commentators said they were profoundly shocked to see women engaging in such degrading conduct.\n\nBadJocks became so closely associated with the hazing pictures and the ensuing scandals that, in April 2007, the University of Minnesota at Duluth's athletic director specifically referred to it when explaining a new request that student-athletes not use Facebook or MySpace. Reno responded that he doesn't troll either site and usually finds the pictures, if he's the one to do so, on Webshots.\n\n"}

{"id": "8876936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8876936", "title": "Bicycle suspension", "text": "Bicycle suspension\n\nBicycle suspension is the system, or systems, used to \"suspend\" the rider and bicycle in order to insulate them from the roughness of the terrain. Bicycle suspension is used primarily on mountain bikes, but is also common on hybrid bicycles.\n\nBicycle suspension can be implemented in a variety of ways, and any combination thereof:\n\nBicycles with only front suspension are referred to as hardtail and bicycles with suspension in both the front and rear are referred to as dual or full suspension bikes. When a bicycle has no suspension it is called rigid. Bicycles with only rear suspension are uncommon although the Brompton folding bicycle is equipped with rear only suspension.\n\nAlthough a stiffer frame is usually preferable, no material is infinitely stiff and therefore any frame will exhibit some flexing. Bicycle designers intentionally make frames in such a way that the frame itself can absorb some vibrations.\n\nBesides providing comfort to the rider, suspension systems improve traction and safety by helping to keep one or both wheels in contact with the ground.\n\nAs early as 1885, the Whippet brand of safety bicycle was notable for its use of springs to suspend the frame.\n\nFront suspension is often implemented using a telescopic (i.e., telescoping) fork. The specifics of the suspension depend on the type of mountain biking the fork is designed for and is generally categorized by the amount of travel. For instance, manufacturers produce different forks for cross-country (XC), downhill (DH), freeride (FR) and enduro (ND) riding which all have different demands for amount of travel, weight, durability, strength, and handling characteristics.\n\nTelescopic suspension forks have become increasingly sophisticated. The amount of travel available has typically increased. When suspension forks were introduced, 80–100 mm of travel was deemed sufficient for a downhill mountain bike. This amount of travel is now common for cross-country disciplines, whereas downhill forks typically offer 200 mm of travel for handling the most extreme terrain.\n\nOther advances in design include adjustable travel, allowing riders to adapt the fork's travel to the specific terrain (e.g. less travel for uphill or paved sections, more travel for downhill sections). Many forks feature the ability to lock out the travel. This completely eliminates or drastically reduces the fork's travel for more efficient riding over smooth sections of terrain. The lockout can sometimes be remotely controlled by a lever on the handlebars via a mechanical cable, or even through electronics.\n\nAs with all shock absorbers it usually consists of two parts: a spring, and a damper. The spring may be implemented with a steel or titanium coil, compressed air, or even an elastomer. Different spring materials have different spring rates which have a fundamental effect on the characteristics of the fork as a whole. Coil-sprung forks keep an approximately constant (\"linear\") spring rate throughout their travel. The spring rate of air-sprung forks however increases with travel, making them progressive. Titanium coils are much lighter but much more expensive. Air-sprung forks are generally lighter still.\n\nAir springs work by using the characteristic of compressed air to resist further compression. As the spring itself is provided by the compressed air rather than a coil of metal it is much lighter; this makes their use popular in cross country designs. Another advantage of this type of fork design is that the spring rate can easily be adjusted by changing the air pressure within the fork. This allows a fork to be effectively tuned to a rider's weight. To achieve this in a coil sprung fork, one would have to swap out different coils with different spring rates. However air pressure naturally controls both spring rate and preload at the same time, requiring air forks to have additional systems to adjust preload separately, adding to its complexity. Another disadvantage of air-sprung forks is the difficulty in achieving a linear spring rate throughout the fork's action. As the fork compresses, the air held inside is compressed. Towards the end of the fork's travel, further compression of the fork requires ever greater force. This results in an increase in spring rate and gives the fork its progressive feel. Increasing the volume of the air inside the spring reduces this effect but the volume of the spring is ultimately limited by the need to be contained within the fork. The use of two air chambers within the system has allowed a more linear feel to air suspension, this is achieved by having a 'reserve' chamber that becomes connected to the main chamber when it reaches a certain amount of compression. Once achieved, a valve opens and effectively makes the chamber larger. By linking the two, the force needed to compress the air in the chambers is reduced which reduces the exponential spring rate feel traditionally associated with air systems when approaching the end of the suspension's travel.\n\nThe amount of preload on coil-sprung forks can generally be adjusted by turning a knob on top of one of the fork legs. Air sprung designs have various ways of dealing with preload. Several systems have been designed to influence preload, such as separately pressurizing different chambers, or systems that automatically set sag after changing the air pressure.\n\nA damper is usually implemented by forcing oil to pass through one or more small orifices (also called ports) or shim stacks. On some models the damper may be adjusted for rider weight, riding style, terrain, or any combination of these or other factors. The two components are often separated by housing the spring mechanism in one of the fork's legs and the damper in the other. Without a damper unit the system would rebound excessively and would actually give the rider less control than would a rigid fork.\n\nTo prevent water and dirt from damaging the suspension, gaiters have been used to cover the fork's stanchions. However even when properly sealing the stanchions and sliders, the gaiters have to have small openings in them to allow air to move in and out of the cavity between gaiter and stanchion as the fork moves through its travel. Some water and grit may find its way in through these holes, staying trapped inside and accumulating over time. Since modern dust wipers and seals keep out water and dirt adequately enough by themselves, and since gaiter-less stanchions are generally regarded as more aesthetically pleasing, gaiters have fallen out of favor.\n\nSome manufacturers have tried other variations to the telescopic fork. For example, Cannondale designed a shock absorber build into the steerer tube called HeadShok, and a single-sided fork with just one leg, called Lefty. The stanchions of both systems are not round but have flat faces machined onto them which slide on needle bearings instead of bushings, this prevents the wheel from rotating in relation to the handlebars. Both of these systems claim to offer greater rigidity and better feel, with lighter weight. Others such as Proflex (Girvin), Whyte and BMW, have made suspension forks that employ four-bar linkage systems instead of relying upon telescopic fork legs, much like BMW's Duolever. The Suntour Swing Shock fork is based on a coil cantilevered swing set-up, and suspension is given by a coil spring which is located within the steerer tube and can be accessed from the top, technology which was originally used for suspension on early motorcycles.\nBicycles with rear suspension typically also have front suspension. Recumbent bicycles with suspension are an exception and often employ rear-only suspension.\n\nMountain bike suspension technology has made great advances since first appearing in the early 1990s. Early full suspension frames were heavy and tended to bounce up and down while a rider pedaled. This movement was called pedal bob, kickback, or monkey motion and took power out of a rider's pedal stroke — especially during climbs up steep hills. Input from hard braking efforts also negatively affected early full suspension designs. When a rider hit the brakes, these early suspensions compressed into their travel and lost some of their ability to absorb bumps. This happened in situations where the rear suspension was needed most. When braking efforts cause the suspension to compress it is referred to as brake squat, when braking causes the suspension to extend it is called brake jack.\n\nProblems with pedal bob and brake jack began to be controlled in the early 1990s. One of the first successful full suspension bikes was designed by Mert Lawwill, a former motorcycle champion. His bike, the Gary Fisher RS-1, was released in 1992. Its rear suspension adapted the A-arm suspension design from sports car racing, and was the first four-bar linkage in mountain biking. This design reduced the twin problems of unwanted braking and pedaling input to the rear wheel, but the design wasn't flawless. Problems remained with suspension action under acceleration, and the RS-1 couldn't use traditional cantilever brakes since the rear axle, and thus rim, moved in relation to the chainstays and seatstays. A lightweight, powerful disc brake wasn't developed until the mid-1990s, and the disc brake used on the RS-1 was its downfall.\n\nHorst Leitner began working on the problem of chain torque and its effect on suspension in the mid-1970s with motorcycles. In 1985 Leitner built a prototype mountain bike incorporating what became known later as the \"Horst link\". The Horst Link is a type of four-bar suspension. Leitner formed a mountain bike and research company, AMP research, that began building full-suspension mountain bikes. In 1990, AMP introduced the Horst link as a feature of a \"fully independent linkage\" rear suspension for mountain bikes. The AMP B-3 and B-4 XC full-suspension bikes featured optional disc brakes and Horst link rear suspension very similar to the Macpherson strut. Note that the sliding piston in the shock absorber represents the fourth \"bar\" in this case. A later model, the B-5, was equipped with a revolutionary four-bar front suspension fork, as well as the Horst link in the rear. It featured up to 125 mm (5 inches) of travel on a bicycle weighing around 10.5 kg (23 pounds). For 10 years AMP Research manufactured their full-suspension bikes in small quantities in Laguna Beach, California, including the manufacture of their own hubs, rear shocks, front suspension forks and cable-actuated-hydraulic disc brakes which they pioneered.\n\nA soft tail (also softail) relies on the flexing of the chainstays of a regular diamond frame to create suspension travel, sometimes incorporating a specific flexing member within the chainstays. A shock absorber (or elastomer) is placed in line with the seat stays to allow the chainstays to move up and down, and for shock absorption. As the suspension moves through its travel the seat stay and shock absorber move out of alignment. This misalignment creates a mechanical lever for suspension forces, causing torque on the joint between chain- and seatstays. This is an inherent structural disadvantage of the soft tail design and severely limits the amount of travel possible, typically around 1 to 2 inches. Soft tails have few moving parts and few pivot points making them simple and requiring little maintenance. Some notable examples include the KHS Team Softail, Trek STP and the Moots YBB. Some bikes (such as the Cannondale Scapel, Yeti ASR Carbon and older Yeti bikes) use a four-bar suspension design where one of the pivots is replaced by a flexing link.\n\nThe unified rear triangle or \"URT\" for short, keeps the bottom bracket and rear axle directly connected at all times. Suspension action is provided between the rear triangle, which unites rear axle and bottom bracket, and the front triangle, which unites seat and front axle. This design uses only one pivot, which keeps the number of moving parts down. The fixed length between bottom bracket and rear axle gives the URT the advantage of zero chain growth and consistent front derailleur shifting. Additionally the bike is easily modified into a single-speed. However, as the URT's suspension moves, the distance between seat and pedals changes, detracting from pedaling efficiency. Furthermore, when the rider shifts any weight from the seat to the pedals, he or she is shifting weight from the sprung part of the bike to the unsprung parts. As such, part of the rider's weight is no longer suspended by the suspension system. Since pedaling itself is a shift of this weight, the design is very prone to suspension bob.\n\nNotable examples of bikes with this type of suspension include the Ibis Szazbo, Klein Mantra, Schwinn S-10, and Trek Y.\n\nThe single pivot is the simplest type of rear suspension. The rear axle is held by a swingarm which is connected to the frame via a single pivot located near the bottom bracket. When the suspension moves through its travel, the path the rear axle describes is a circle around the pivot point. The rear triangle can be directly attached to the rear shock for a fairly linear leverage ratio between wheel travel and shock absorber travel.\n\nThe main advantage of the single pivot design is its simplicity. It has few moving parts, few pivot points, is relatively easy to design and has good small bump compliance. Challenges with this design are brake squat and chain growth.\n\nDue to its simplicity, many inexpensive department store bikes use this design.\n\nAnother implementation of the single pivot design attaches the swingarm to the shock via additional linkages, typically creating a four-bar linkage actuating (\"driving\") the shock to create a more progressive leverage ratio between wheel travel and shock absorber travel. This design is referred to as linkage driven single pivot, colloquially called faux-bar. It employs a four-bar linkage but the rear axle is held in a swingarm and still describes a circular axle path. The four-bar linkage serves only to actuate the shock and has no role in governing the axle path. Manufacturers of the linkage-driven single pivot often use the word \"four-bar\" in their marketing campaigns, which gave rise to the design's nickname \"faux-bar\".\n\nNotable manufacturers well known for their long-time use of this suspension design include KHS, Kona, Jamis, Diamondback Bicycles and older Trek Fuels.\n\nThis variation of single pivot suspension places the pivot in front of and above the bottom bracket, at a height above the smallest chainring or higher. This gives the design a significant amount of anti-squat when pedaling in smaller chainrings, which helps reduce loss of energy due to squat. This is of particular importance on steep climbs, when one would use the smaller chainrings. However, this is a trade-off since the pivot's placement causes the design to suffer more from pedal kickback. Notable examples are Santa Cruz's Heckeler and Superlight as well as Orange's entire line of full suspensions.\n\nThe split pivot design is a special case of linkage-driven single pivot in which one of the four-bar's pivot points coincides with the rear axle. This allows for the disc brake caliper to be mounted on the floating linkage (also called coupler) instead of on the swingarm. As a result of this the braking torque now interacts with the suspension via the floating linkage. The linkages can be designed such that this has a positive effect on suspension performance under braking, typically reducing brake jack. Furthermore, the relative rotation between brake disc and brake caliper as the suspension goes through its travel is different from that in single pivot designs. The four linkages in a split pivot design influence how braking torque is transmitted, how the brake caliper moves in relation to the disc and influence the leverage ratio between wheel travel and shock travel. Since these influences may have a different optimum linkage design, the bike's design has to strike a balance. Dave Weagle designed a split pivot which he named \"Split Pivot\". Trek Bicycle Corporation also released a version of the split pivot design called \"Active Braking Pivot\" (ABP) in early 2007. Cycles Devinci has released a licensed implementation of the \"Split Pivot\" design which Dave Weagle managed to patent.\n\n\"Horst Link\" suspension is a type of four-bar linkage suspension. It is characterized by having both connecting links pivot on the seat tube, with the lower pivot located above the center of the bottom bracket, and the rear axle being located higher than the pivot connecting floating link and lower connecting link.\n\nSpecialized has bought several of Leitner's patents which they use for their \"FSR Suspension\". Several manufacturer had licensed the design from Specialized. Some European manufacturers, such as Cube and Scott, do use the same suspension design, but couldn't import it to the United States until 2013 due to patent protection. Norco, Canadian bicycle manufacturer also licensed the design from Specialized but further optimized the FSR system, calling their own system Advanced Ride Technology (ART).\n\nAlthough not necessarily sharing any general suspension characteristics, these designs all share a certain structural benefit. Because the connecting links are so short, the floating link comes in the form of a rigid rear triangle big enough to encompass the rear wheel. This allows the rear triangle on both sides of the wheel to be rigidly connected together as one piece, before attaching to the connecting links of the four-bar. This significantly increases lateral and torsional stiffness of the rear, often a weakness of four-bar designs, and reduces the load on the pivots, connecting links and joint between rear axle and frame.\n\nThe \"Virtual Pivot Point\" or VPP, is the name given to a four-bar linkage suspension with relatively short links connecting the rear triangle to the frame. It is characterized by having a chainstay lengthening effect and an 'S' shaped axle path. Some variations may have the links rotate in opposite direction as the suspension moves. The instant centre of rotation, as found in all linkage systems, is also called virtual pivot point. The \"Virtual Pivot Point\" suspension was developed by Jamie Calon and James Klassen for Outland Bikes in the nineties and the associated patents are now owned by Santa Cruz Bicycles.\n\nDave Weagle's \"DW-link\" is another four-bar suspension system with two relatively short links, which typically co-rotate. It is characterized by an anti-squat response that varies with suspension travel and is designed to reduce loss of energy resulting from squat during pedaling. It typically has higher anti-squat at the beginning of suspension travel, and less thereafter. The DW-link was originally used by Iron Horse Bicycle Company. The company filed for bankruptcy in early 2009 and was acquired by Dorel Industries in July 2009.\nThe DW-link is now licensed to Ibis, Independent Fabrication, Turner Suspension Bicycles, and Pivot Cycles.\n\nAnother variation using short, co-rotating, links is employed by Giant Bicycles called \"Maestro\". Dave Weagle sued Giant for patent infringement after Giant consulted with Dave Weagle of DW Link. In 2014 the lawsuit was dropped after a lengthy and costly battle.\n\nYet another variation of short link design is the \"Switch link\", found on some Yeti bikes like the SB-66 designed by Dave Earle. In the original form, the rear triangle is connected to the frame using an eccentric lower pivot, effectively creating a very short lower link whose length is that from the centre of the eccentric to the attached pivot. The lower link would initially rotate upwards and backwards slightly. The links counter-rotated such that the top link would rotate forwards and upwards initially. As the top link rotated further it would move downwards reversing or \"Switching\" the lower link's direction downwards and forwards. In the more recent form, the lower link has been replaced with a linear bearing based on shock technology from Fox Racing Shox. This linear bearing simply moves up initially and then down towards the end of the suspension travel.\n\nTrek bicycles' \"Full Floater\" is a system where the rear shock is only attached to the rear triangle. The chainstays pivot on the seat-tube, and then extend into the front triangle, and the lower shock bushing attaches to the chainstays. The seatstays are attached to an \"Evo\" link, which then attaches to the shock top bushings. This system enables finer tuning of suspension kinematics, as the shock angle relative to the linkages during the travel changes in a more linear fashion. Trek also combines \"Full Floater\" with its \"ABP\" rear axle, where the rear suspension pivot is the rear axle, which reduces pedal feedback and prevents the braking forces on the wheel from altering the suspension movement. It also provides better traction and control through braking over rough terrain.\n\nThe \"Equilink\" suspension system was developed by Felt Bicycles for their full suspension line. The system employs a \"Stephenson-style\" six-bar linkage suspension system. Equilink gets its name from the dog bone shaped bar that ties the upper and lower links together. Early models included a pivot between chain- and seatstay whereas in later, carbon fiber, models the chain- and seatstays are one piece, creating pivoting action by flexing. Felt contends that the system holds its pedaling efficiency in any gear combination.\n\nBikes with a 'floating drivetrain' or 'floating bottom bracket' can use any type of suspension system to suspend the rear wheel from the frame, but use linkages to connect the crank assembly to the frame and rear suspension. Since the linkages are connected to the rear suspension, suspension movement causes the crank assembly to move as well. The floating drivetrain is often employed to compensate for the disadvantages of a particular rear suspension system so the design can make better use of its advantages.\n\nThe \"Independent Drivetrain\" (or \"IDrive\") is a four-bar suspension system for bicycle crank assemblies, the rear wheel itself is suspended as single pivot suspension. It was developed by mountain bike suspension designer Jim Busby Jr. and was a direct result of the limitations encountered with the GT LTS (GT Bicycles' \"Links Tuned Suspension\") four-bar linkage design used by GT Bicycles from 1993 to 1998. The IDrive attempts to maximize the efficiency of the transmission of energy from the rider to the rear wheel. The bottom bracket is placed eccentric in a bearing within the swingarm, the distance between the center of the bearing and the bottom bracket effectively creating a very short link, and the swingarm itself creating another. A link between bearing shell and frame then completes the four-bar linkage with the bottom bracket on the floating link and the linkage as a whole actuated by movement of the swingarm.\n\nThe \"Monolink\" made by Maverick Bikes and designed by RockShox founder Paul Turner, is a variant of the Independent Drivetrain suspension, and is a variation of the MacPherson strut. It uses three pivot points and the sliding action of the shock to provide the fourth degree of freedom. This design places the bottom bracket on the link (the Monolink) connecting the frame and rear triangle. Any load on the cranks is partly unsprung since it is also a load on one of the suspension's parts itself, and actively works against the suspension. However, because of this there is less bob during out-of-the-saddle sprints. Once again it is an attempt at maximizing drivetrain efficiency, compromising other areas. Notable bikes using this design are the Maverick ML7, Durance, ML8 and the Klein Palomino.\n\nThe \"Pendbox\" is found on several of Lapierre's linkage driven single pivot bikes in which the crank assembly is hung from the frame using a 'mini-swingarm'; the Pendbox. A link connects the swingarm and Pendbox such that they form a four-bar linkage.\n\nSuspension may be implemented at the saddle either using a suspension saddle or a suspension seatpost.\n\nThe effectiveness of saddle or seatpost suspension depends on the rider placing their weight on the saddle. For this reason, this style of suspension is most popular on more upright styles of bicycle, where the rider spends the majority of time seated.\n\nSuspension may be provided in the hub of a bicycle wheel. One manufacturer offers 12 mm to 24 mm of travel.\n\nIn mountain biking the term 'suspension hub' was used in the 90s to describe hubs with oversized axle ends and a thicker axles than were customary at the time. These hubs were designed to stiffen up suspension forks, which were still somewhat of a novelty, by rigidly holding the fork legs in position relative to each other once the wheel was fitted, improving steering response in the fork. This term is no longer used as this function is no longer an exceptional requirement for mountain bike front hubs, so all current mountain bike hubs are suspension hubs.\n\nSeveral terms are commonly used to describe different aspects of a bicycle suspension.\n\nTravel refers to how much movement a suspension mechanism allows. It usually measures how much the wheel axle moves.\n\nPreload refers to the force applied to spring component before external loads, such as rider weight, are applied. More preload makes the suspension sag less and less preload makes the suspension sag more. Adjusting preload affects the ride height of the suspension.\n\nRebound refers to the rate at which the suspension component returns to its original configuration after absorbing a shock. The term also generally refers to rebound damping or rebound damping adjustments on shocks, which vary the rebound speed. More rebound damping will cause the shock to return at a slower rate.\n\nSag refers to how much a suspension moves under just the static load of the rider. Sag is often used as one parameter when tuning a suspension for a rider. Spring preload is adjusted until the desired amount of sag is measured.\n\nLockout refers to a mechanism to disable a suspension mechanism to render it substantially rigid. This may be desirable during climbing or sprinting to prevent the suspension from absorbing power applied by the rider. Some lockout mechanisms also feature a \"blow off\" system that deactivates the lockout when an appropriate force is applied to help prevent damage to the shock and rider injury under high unexpected loads.\n\nBob and squat refer to how a suspension, usually rear, responds to rider pedalling. Squat usually refers to how the rear end sinks under acceleration, and bob refers to repeated squat and rebound with each pedal stroke. Both are undesirable characteristics as they rob power from pedalling. Many suspension systems incorporate anti-bob, anti-squat, or \"platform\" damping to help eliminate bob.\n\nPedal feedback describes torque applied to the crankset by the chain caused by motion of the rear axle relative to the bottom bracket. Pedal feedback is caused by an increase in the distance between the chainring and rear cog, and it can be felt as a torque on the crankset opposite to forward pedalling.\n\nCompression damping refers to systems that slow the rate of compression in a front fork shock or rear shock. Compression damping is usually accomplished by forcing a hydraulic fluid (such as oil) through a valve when the shock becomes loaded. The amount of damping is determined by the resistance through the valve, a higher amount of damping resulting from greater resistance in the valve. Many shocks have compression damping adjustments which vary the resistance in the valve. Often, lockouts function by allowing no or very little compression.\n\nUnsprung mass is the mass of the portions of bicycles that is not supported by the suspension systems. At one extreme are road bicycles with no suspension in the frames, very little in the tires, and none in the saddles. By raising themselves off their saddles, riders may provide suspension with their knees, making their mass be sprung mass, but all of the mass of the bicycles remains unsprung mass. At the other extreme are full suspension mountain bikes. With front and rear suspensions the only parts unsuspended are the wheels and small parts of the front forks and rear chain-stays. Even then, as mountain bikes have large low-pressure tires which allow much more travel than small high-pressure road tires, the wheels are sprung to some extent as well.\n\nIn general, bikes are so light compared to their riders that travel is a much bigger motivator than unsprung mass in determining where to put the suspension and how much to use. The exception to this is that on recumbent and tandem bicycles where the riders are either unable to lift themselves out of their seat or unable to see in advance when that will be needed, the riders' mass can no longer be expected to be supported by their knees over road irregularities. These bicycles generally have some sort of suspension system to reduce unsprung mass.\n\nMany newer mountain bikes have a full suspension design. In the past, mountain bikes had a rigid frame and a rigid fork. In the early 1990s, mountain bikes started to have front suspension forks. This made riding on rough terrain easier on a rider's arms. The first suspension forks had about 1½ to 2 inches (38 to 50 mm) of suspension travel. Soon after, some frame designers came out with a full suspension frame which gave riders a smoother ride throughout the ride.\n\nNewer suspension frame and fork designs have reduced weight, increased amount of suspension travel, and improved feel. Many lock out the rear suspension while the rider is pedaling hard or climbing, in order to improve pedaling efficiency. Most suspension frames and forks have about 4-6 inches (100–150 mm) of suspension travel. More aggressive suspension frames and forks made for downhill racing and freeriding have as much as 8 or 9 inches (200 or 230 mm) of suspension travel.\n\nMany riders still prefer to ride a hardtail frame, and almost all mountain bicycle riders use a suspension fork. Notable suspension fork manufacturers include Manitou, Öhlins, Marzocchi, Fox Racing Shox, RockShox, and (to a lesser extent) X-Fusion, RST, Suntour and Magura. Some bicycle manufacturers (notably Cannondale and Specialized) also make their own suspension systems to fully complement and integrate the bike set-up.\n\nAlthough much less common, some road bicycles do incorporate suspensions, particularly the Soft Tail variety mentioned above. One example is Trek Bicycle Corporation's s.p.a (Suspension Performance Advantage) rear suspension, offered on some of their Pilot models, but the system was removed for the 2008 model year.\nVirtually all bicycles produced by Alex Moulton bicycles also have very effective full suspension, due to the low unsuspended mass of the small wheels and high pressure tires, a characteristic of the unconventional design of these bicycles. A recent design is the cantilevered 'swing shock' on some modern hybrid bikes.\n\nMany recumbent bicycles have at least a rear suspension because the rider is usually unable to lift themselves off the seat while riding. Single pivot is usually adequate when the pedaling thrust is horizontal - that is, forwards rather than downwards. This is usually the case provided the bottom bracket is higher than the seat's base height. Where the bottom bracket is significantly lower than the seat base, there may still be some pedalling-induced bounce.\n\nShort-wheelbase recumbents benefit from front suspension more than long wheelbase recumbents because the front wheel (often small diameter which further magnifies the need for suspension) is taking a much larger portion of the loads than in a long wheelbase recumbent.\n\nThe Softride Suspension System was launched at the Interbike 1989 bike show. The original SRS systems consisted of two foam filled fiberglass boxes bonded together with a viscoelastic layer. Originally intended for the use in mountain bikes, Softride produced its first full-fledged mountain bike, the PowerCurve, in 1991. During 1996 Softride released its first aluminum frame road bike, the Classic TT. The Softride Suspension System is used almost exclusively for triathlon racing. Softride ceased bicycle production in 2007 after the design was banned from UCI races.\n\nA very closely related suspension design to the Softride is the Zipp 2001, a contemporary competing beam bicycle, where the suspension was in the hinge, rather than in flex of the beam itself.\n"}

{"id": "222488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=222488", "title": "Camp Nou", "text": "Camp Nou\n\nCamp Nou (, \"new field\", often referred to as the Nou Camp in English) is the home stadium of FC Barcelona since its completion in 1957.\n\nWith a seating capacity of 99,354, it is the largest stadium in Spain and Europe, and the third largest football stadium in the world in capacity. It has hosted two European Cup/Champions League finals in 1989 and 1999, two UEFA Cup Winners' Cup finals, four Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final games, five UEFA Super Cup final games, four Copa del Rey finals, two Copa de la Liga final games, twenty-one Supercopa de España final games, five matches including the opening game of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, two out of four matches at the 1964 European Nations' Cup and the football competition final at the 1992 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe construction of Camp Nou started on 28 March 1954 as Barcelona's previous stadium, Camp de Les Corts, had no room for expansion. Although originally planned to be called the Estadi del FC Barcelona, the more popular name Camp Nou was used. The June 1950 signing of László Kubala, regarded as one of Barcelona's greatest players, provided further impetus to the construction of a larger stadium.\n\nThe architects were Francesc Mitjans and Josep Soteras, with the collaboration of Lorenzo García-Barbón.\n\nIn May 1972, Camp Nou hosted its first European Cup Winners' Cup final between Rangers and Dynamo Moscow. Rangers won the match with a score of 3–2. The 1970s marked a turning point for Barcelona with the signing of a new player, Johan Cruyff, in 1973. Electronic scoreboards were installed in the stadium two years later.\n\nThe stadium underwent an expansion in 1980, in anticipation of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, which added boxes, VIP lounges, a new press area, new markers and the construction of the third tier, which was smaller in height than the original design by 6 metres (46.60 metres compared to the original design of 52.50 metres). The expansion of the stadium added 22,150 new seats, taking the total seating capacity to 71,731, and the standing capacity was expanded by 16,500 to 49,670, taking the total stadium capacity (seated and standing combined) to 121,401. FC Barcelona's record attendance was set on 5 March 1986 in the European Cup quarter-final against Juventus in front of 120,000 spectators, just 1,401 shy of the stadium's capacity.\n\nCamp Nou was one of several stadiums used throughout the 1982 World Cup, hosting the inauguration ceremony on 13 June. It also hosted more matches in that tournament than any of the 16 other stadiums used all over Spain, including the opening match, where the traditional opening ceremonies took place (including the releasing of a dove). In front of 95,000, Belgium upset the defending champions Argentina 1–0 in that opening match. It then hosted three round-robin matches between the Soviet Union, Poland, and Belgium, which Poland ended up winning and qualifying from to reach the semi-finals, where they played Italy at the Camp Nou, losing 2–0; Italy went on to win the final match, which was played at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid.\n\nThe stadium's capacity has varied greatly over the years, opening at 106,146, but growing to 121,401 for the 1982 FIFA World Cup.\n\nApart from hosting Barcelona, Camp Nou is home to the Catalan team. The stadium is frequently used for other football events. The European Cup final between Milan and Steaua București was held on 24 May 1989, with the Italian club winning 4–0. Camp Nou hosted part of the football competition, including the final, in the 1992 Summer Olympics. In preparation for these matches, two additional tiers of seating were installed over the previous roof-line.\n\nCamp Nou underwent little change after 1982, except for the opening of the club museum in 1984. The stadium underwent a facelift in 1993–94, in which the pitch was lowered by 2.5 metres (8 feet), the security gap that separated the lawn from the galleries was removed, and standing room was eliminated in favor of individual seating. A new press box, renovation of the presidential grandstand and boxes, new parking under the main grandstand, and new lighting and sound systems were completed in time for the 1998–99 season. In 1999, UEFA outlawed standing sections in stadiums, and Camp Nou's capacity settled to its current level. The stadium hosted the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final later that year where Manchester United played Bayern Munich. United won 2–1, coming back from 0–1 down in injury time.\n\nDuring 1998–99, UEFA rated Camp Nou a five-star stadium for its services and functionalities. However, as per the 2010 regulations, UEFA does not publish a list of the top venues.\n\nIn 2000, fans were polled concerning the stadium's name. Of the 29,102 votes the club received, a total of 19,861 (68.25%) preferred Camp Nou to Estadi del FC Barcelona, and thus the official name was changed to the popular nickname.\n\nThe facilities now include a memorabilia shop, mini-pitches for training matches, and a chapel for the players. The stadium also houses the second-most visited museum in Catalonia, FC Barcelona Museum, which receives more than 1.2 million visitors per year.\n\nOn 1 October 2017, Barcelona's league match against Las Palmas was played in an empty Camp Nou due to political turmoil in the region.\n\nThe club issued an international tender to remodel the stadium as a celebration of the stadium's fiftieth anniversary. The objective was to make the facility an integrated and highly visible urban environment. The club schemed to increase the seating capacity by 13,500, with at least half of the total seating to be under cover. The intention was to make it the third-largest stadium in the world (in terms of seating capacity), after the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in the USA (297,000 capacity), and the Rungnado May Day Stadium in North Korea (114,000 capacity).\n\nOn 18 September 2007, the British architect Norman Foster and his company were selected to \"restructure\" Camp Nou. With an estimated cost of €250 million, the plan included the addition of roughly 6,000 seats for a maximum capacity of 105,000. The FC Barcelona board approved the sale of their former training ground (the Mini Estadi) against significant opposition in order to finance the remodeling. The project was planned to begin in 2009 and to be finished for the 2011–12 season. However, due to the 2008 financial crisis, the sale of the training ground was postponed and likewise the remodeling project. In May 2010, Sandro Rosell, then a candidate for president of FC Barcelona, dismissed the possibility of selling the Mini Estadi, saying it would be indefensible to \"sell the crown jewels\", and his election on 30 June 2010 effectively halted the plan to remodel Camp Nou.\n\nIn January 2014, Barcelona's board of directors rejected the option of building a new stadium due to financial constraints and instead opted to remodel the Camp Nou to bring the capacity up to 105,000. The project is expected to run from 2017 to early 2021, with a cost of around £495 million (€600 million), making it one of the most expensive expansions on a per-seat basis. A refined plan was released on 26 May 2015, showing plans to add a canopy over the stands, and showing the plans for seating expansion in greater detail. Construction started in the summer of 2018, and estimated completion won't be until the start of the 2021-2022 La Liga season.\n\nCamp Nou has been used for various purposes other than football, often hosting major concerts. Pope John Paul II celebrated mass for a congregation of over 121,500 at Camp Nou on 17 November 1982, on the occasion being made an honorary citizen of Barcelona.\n\nIn 1983, Julio Iglesias played for 60,000 people, in what was described as a \"most beautifully orchestrated\" concert. Other high-profile performances at Camp Nou include those by Bruce Springsteen on 3 August 1988 during his Tunnel of Love Express Tour; and again on 19 and 20 July 2008 during his Magic Tour. On 9 August 1988, Michael Jackson appeared at the stadium in front of 95,000 fans during his Bad World Tour. On 10 September 1988, a charity concert organised by Amnesty International to support human rights featured, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Peter Gabriel, Youssou N'Dour, Tracy Chapman, and El Último de la Fila. A concert by the Three Tenors – Josep Carreras, Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti – was held on 13 July 1997. On 3 August 1988 Bruce Springsteen appeared in front of 90,000 people on the Tunnel of Love Express Tour. He came back on 3 September 1988 to appear in front of again 90,000 on the Human Rights Now! tour.\n\nU2 performed at the stadium three times: the first one was on 7 August 2005 during their Vertigo Tour, in front of a sold out crowd of 81,269 people. The second and the third were on 30 June and 2 July 2009 during their U2 360° Tour, in front of a total crowd of 182,055 people. The encore performance of \"I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight\" from the second 2009 show was filmed for the music video of the single.\n\nOn 4 November 2014, Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR), which operates France's professional rugby union leagues, announced that the 2015–16 Top 14 final would be held at the Camp Nou on 24 June 2016. The Top 14 final is traditionally held at the Stade de France in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis. However, the scheduling of the 2015 Rugby World Cup caused the 2015–16 French season to be shifted by several weeks, in turn causing the Stade de France to be unavailable because it would be a major venue for UEFA Euro 2016. The match ultimately drew a crowd of 99,124, setting a new record for attendance at a domestic rugby match.\n\nApproximately 680 metres from Camp Nou there is the Trambaix Avinguda de Xile station (lines T1, T2 and T3).\n\nThe stadium is accessible from the Barcelona Metro with the closest stations to Camp Nou are Palau Reial, Maria Cristina and Les Corts, on L3; Badal on L5 and Collblanc on L5 or L9 \nL9. All are 500 to 1,000 metres from Camp Nou, depending on which of the gates (accesses) to Camp Nou are used. Usually metro services are increased when there is a match with significant passenger congestion nonetheless.\n\nClosest station to each access:\n\nCurrently a station for Camp Nou is under construction, on L9 and L10.\n\nThe bus lines with a stop close to Camp Nou are:\nTMB lines:\n\nAMB lines:\nNitbus (approximately 22.30h-5h):\n\nUsually the lines 15, 43 and 56 service is stepped up, depending on the demand that may occur. Apart from that there are two special lines to Mossèn Jacint Verdaguer Square and to Catalunya Square when there are matches.\n\nThe stadium is a significant away from the El Prat International Airport which is a 40-minute drive considering the city's traffic. It is possible to use the L9 from the airport directly to Collblanc, and walk for about 9–12 minutes to the stadium as an alternative route.\n\nThe stadium was one of the venues of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, and held the following matches:\n\n\n"}

It is currently used primarily for football matches and is the home ground of Macclesfield Town F.C.. The stadium holds 6,355 and was built in 1891, making it one of the oldest grounds in the Football League.\n\nThe Moss Rose first hosted Football League action when Chester City played home games at the stadium between moving from Sealand Road to the Deva Stadium from 1990 to 1992. The first such match was a 2-1 win for Exeter City on 1 September 1990. Later in the month, Arsenal played at the Moss Rose in a Football League Cup tie, winning 1-0. Macclesfield were a non-league side at the time and fixtures were arranged so Chester were at home when Macclesfield were away and vice versa. The Moss Rose pitch was having to contend with more than 50 first-team matches a season from the two sides.\n\nDespite hosting Football League matches in this period, Macclesfield were denied entry to the Football League in 1995 after winning the Football Conference after the stadium requirements were tightened (a reciprocal offer by Chester to allow Macclesfield to play at the Deva Stadium while the necessary improvements were made was also rejected by the league). Macclesfield were champions again two years later and the Moss Rose was now up to the required standards. The Silkmen beat Torquay United in their first home league match on 9 August 1997 and the Moss Rose continues to host professional matches today.\n\nThe ground consists of four stands. The Silk FM stand (traditionally known as the London Road or Main stand) runs along one side of the pitch. It is usually given over entirely to home supporters, unless the travelling support is particularly large, in which case the right-hand side of this stand houses some away fans. There is terracing along the entire length of the pitch, with a small stand at the back of the terracing. The Macclesfield Audi Stand (traditionally known as the Star Lane End) is to the left of the Silk FM stand, and is used by the home support. Opposite the Silk FM stand is the Henshaw's Stand (originally known as the McAlpine stand, named after the architects that also designed the ground of Huddersfield Town). This is all-seated and covered, and houses home supporters, and a small number of travelling fans. At the opposite end to the Macclesfield Audi Stand is the Silkmen Terrace, which is an open terrace and is given to away fans. Unfortunately, as Macclesfield is often struck by wet weather, this can make for an uncomfortable spectating experience for visiting fans. There are plans to introduce some seating at the back of the Silkmen End and build a leisure complex and hotel behind it, but currently the finances required to do this do not exist.\n\nIn August 2007 the club announced initial talks about moving to a purpose built home on the nearby South Macclesfield Development Area. This would see the club moving a little over a mile to the south west of its current location. The plans continued to develop and in September 2010 the local council announced that 65% of people questioned as a part of a public consultation process were behind a new stadium in the South Macclesfield Development Area.\n\n"}

{"id": "4789355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4789355", "title": "Palmerston Park", "text": "Palmerston Park\n\nPalmerston Park is a football stadium on Terregles Street in Dumfries, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. It is the home ground of Scottish Championship club Queen of the South, who have played there since 1919. South of Scotland League club Heston Rovers have shared Palmerston since 2013. The stadium has a capacity of of which 3,377 are seats.\n\nPalmerston Park was first opened in 1919, when Queen of the South were formed, although football had been played on the site since the 1870s. The site of the ground was formerly a farm called Palmers Toun. This is on the Maxwelltown side of the River Nith in Dumfries. Jimmy McKinnell, Tom Wylie and Willie McCall were all sold to Blackburn Rovers around the same time by Queen of the South. This combined with the sale of Ian Dickson to Aston Villa helped to fund the purchase of Palmerston Park in 1921 for £1,500.\n\nThe Portland Drive Terrace was covered in the late 1950s. Soon afterwards, floodlights were installed and these were first used in a match against Preston North End in October 1958. These are the tallest free standing floodlights in Scottish football, standing at 85 feet. The current main stand was constructed in 1965, soon after the original had burned down.\n\nOn the east side of the ground \"Jimmy Jolly's Bullshed\", later known as the \"Coo Shed\", was originally named after one of the founder members of the club in 1919, when it was built around 1933 as the club reached the first division for the first time. This was replaced by an all seater stand in 1995 and was named the East Stand. A challenge game was held in April 1995 to commemorate the opening of the new stand and Queens' 75th anniversary against Rangers. Guest players for Queens in the 2–2 draw included Davie Irons, future managers Rowan Alexander and Ian McCall, Ted McMinn, Andy Thomson. Scenes from the film \"A Shot at Glory\", starring Robert Duvall, were shot at Palmerston Park during 1999.\n\nThe club was relegated to the Scottish Second Division in 2012, but carried out some remedial work to the stadium, including new water systems and ticket offices. A redevelopment of the 1960s main stand is planned. During March 2013, Queen of the South were given approval to install a new 5G artificial pitch at Palmerston Park for the start of the 2013–14 season. After the club's final home game of the 2012–13 season, the club sold the turf for £10 per square yard as well as auctioning seven special lots. These were the four corner plots, the two penalty spots and Ryan McCann's 84 yard spot.\n\nOf the capacity, there are 3,377 seats. Up until the late 1990s the stadium had a capacity of 8,352, but this was reduced when the Terregles Street end terracing was closed. It was given a safety certificate in September 2014, adding standing capacity of 1,968.\n\nThere are 2,192 seats in the all seated East Stand. For the 2012–13 season this stand was known as the Galloway News Stand, then from 2013–14 until the 2017-18 season this stand was known as the Rosefield Salvage Stand. For the 2018-19 season, Queens centenary, the stand will be known as the BDS Digital Stand. \n\nOpposite this is the main stand, built in 1965, which now has 1,185 seats. The main stand is a small, classic looking covered stand, where the seating area is raised. There are standing terraces for fans to the left and in front of this stand. Since the 2013–14 season the main stand has been known as the Gates Power Transmission Stand. \n\nThe Portland Drive Terrace, with a capacity of 3,345 is a traditional standing area and is now the largest area of covered terracing in Scotland and is reminiscent of all British football grounds prior to the Hillsborough disaster. The terrace is notable for the clock face mounted in the centre of the roof that used to be an advert for a local hostelry, where Time to Visit The Hole I' The Wa' was written underneath the clock. Since the 2015–16 season the terrace has been known as the Oakbank Services Terrace. \n\nThe grass playing surface was widely recognised for its good condition. Iain McChesney described the surface as simply a 'Good park'. Jocky Dempster later said in an interview that among his reasons for signing for Queens was, \"I liked the park at Queens. As you know it’s a good park, a good surface.\" Crawford Boyd said, \"It was a lovely park, it was a treat to play on that park, a lovely playing surface.\" Ted McMinn commented, \"Palmerston was like a bowling green, you knew when you went to kick the ball you wouldn’t get a bobble.\"\n\nCrowds for Queen of the South fixtures are normally around 2,000 people, unless there is a major cup game against higher league opposition. The first league game against local rivals Gretna at the end of August 2006 attracted almost 5,500 spectators, which was the highest league attendance since 2002. There was a full house at Queens' match against Hibs in the 2006–07 Scottish Cup. Similarly, over 6,000 watched the victory over Dundee in the 2007–08 Scottish Cup.\n\nModern attendances are small in comparison with Queens' heyday in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. For example, 10,948 watched the team featuring Willie Savage, Willie Culbert and Willie Ferguson in Queens first ever game in the top flight of Scottish football in 1933, the 3–2 win against Celtic. 13,000 watched a Queens side managed by George McLachlan and captained by Savage knock Rangers out of the Scottish Cup in January 1937. The highest recorded attendance at Palmerston Park was set on 23 February 1952, when a crowd of 26,552 squeezed very tightly in to see Queens play in a Scottish Cup third round tie against Hearts. Jackie Oakes scored the only Queens goal in a 3–1 defeat.\n\nThe stadium held its first live concert in June 2015, with performances by Status Quo, Big Country and Reef.\n\nDumfries railway station, which is served by trains on the Glasgow South Western Line, is the closest railway station to Palmerston Park. The walk between the two sites takes between 15 and 20 minutes. The A75 road bypasses Dumfries; people travelling to Palmerston from the north or east should follow the A76 road (Glasgow Road) into Dumfries, then the A780 road and Terregles Street lead to Palmerston. Car parking is available in surrounding streets and in the Ice Bowl behind the Rosefield Salvage Stand.\n"}

{"id": "42414957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42414957", "title": "Ringball", "text": "Ringball\n\nRingball is a traditional South African sport that stems from basketball and has been played since 1907. The sport is now promoted in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, India, and Mauritius to establish Ringball as an international sport. The sport is played by both men and women teams.\n\nRingball is a non-contact sport played by both men and women teams in separate games. It is similar to the game of netball and can be played on an all weather, grass, or in-door court. The court is divided into three sections. A team consists of three goal scorers, three centre players, and three defending players. The objective of the game is to throw the ball from one player to another and finally through the ring or hoop of the goalpost. A goalpost is placed at both ends of the court.\n\nThe South African game of ringball is played by two opposing teams consisting of nine (9) players on a side. Three players of each team play in each of the three sections of the court (three (3) goal shooters, three (3) centre players and three (3) defenders). These players may at no time during play, touch ground in any adjacent section, step on or receive the ball over the lines separating the sections.\n\nThe ball is passed through the air from player to player and is caught with the hands, such that the ball does not touch any other part of the body. In passing the ball, a player may not move forward or backward, feint a pass, or be in possession of the ball for longer than two (2) seconds during the attempt to pass the ball.\n\nTo score, the ball must fall through the ring from above. A goal shooter may attempt to score a goal from any position in the goal section and outside the semicircle. Both hands (from below upwards) must be used when shooting a goal and must be attempted within five (5) seconds from the time the ball is received. When a penalty goal has been awarded, any of the three opposing goal shooters can attempt a goal from any position outside the goal circle. A penalty goal must be attempted within three (3) seconds. A goal shooter can also attempt a penalty from behind the penalty line within three (3) seconds.\n\nPlayers may try to gain possession of the ball without hitting or snatching the ball from the opponent's hands. Players are not allowed to hold, push away or obstruct their opponents in any manner to prevent them from passing the ball. Two (2) players of the same team may not touch or hold the ball simultaneously. It is an infringement if the ball crosses the section without being touched by a player in that section.\n\nWhen players of both teams commit a transgression simultaneously, it is called a double fault. The referee then tosses the ball into the air between two opposing players where the transgressions occurred. The two opposing players then attempt to gain possession of the ball by hitting or catching the ball on the descend.\n\nA match consists of two-halves of 25 minutes each with an interval of three (3) minutes. After each successful goal, the players must take up position as shown on the image. The centre player stands in the half circle facing his own goalpost. At the blow of the whistle the ball must be passed to one of the wings within two (2) seconds. It is an infringement when the ball is passed to another section without passing to a wing first.\n\nWhen the ball goes out of play crossing the outside lines, an opposing player from that section puts the ball into play on the spot where it has left the court.\n\nThe team with the highest score at the end of the match is the winning team.\n\n1. The court is 27 m x 18 m in size and is divided into three (3) equal sections (9 m x 18 m). The two goalposts are situated in the middle of each short side of the court against the outside line. Each goalpost has a steel ring of 450mm in diameter attached at the top, exactly 3 m from the ground. With the goalpost as pivot a half circle (the goal circle) with a radius of 4,5 m is drawn. The penalty line is short line in the goal section 1 m in length and 2 m from the middle inside line directly in line with the middle half circles. The two side sections are called the goal sections and the middle section is called the centre section. Exactly in the middle of the centre section, a circle of 1 m diameter and in the middle of the two inside lines, two half circles with a diameter of 1 m are drawn. On either side of the centre circle two \"V”-lines with legs of 1 m long are drawn and this is referred to as the \"V”. See the diagram below for the position of the goalposts.\n\n2. All-weather, gravel or grass courts, or adapted netball courts may be used. The surface of the court must be even. Gravel courts must be free of grass and must be well compacted. Slip-free all-weather courts are recommended. Netball courts can be used with minor adjustments.\n\n3. Within a distance of 1,5 m around the court there should be no obstacles such as trees, light poles, walls, fences, wires or steps (also see the spectators section).\n\n4. All lines must be clearly marked in white or yellow. The width of these lines should be between 25 mm and 50 mm.\n\n5. The goalposts must be of 3 m circular steel pipes with a diameter of 75 – 90 mm. The goalposts must be placed in a vertical position in the centre of the 18 m outside line. The inside edge of the goal post must form a tangent with the inside edge of the line.\n\n6. The ring on the goalpost must be of a sturdy round metal bar with a maximum of 18 mm thickness and an inside diameter of 350 mm. Flat steel rings are not allowed. The ring must be horizontally fixed (level) to the top of the post and should not hop up when the ball bounces on the ring. The rings should be painted white or silver.\n\n7. The nets must be large enough to allow a number 5 ball to pass through and must be correctly fixed to the goal ring. White or yellow nylon nets are recommended. Balls could be shot out when the nets are affixed too tightly.\n\n1. A ball made of leather or synthetic material should be used. Rubber balls are not permitted (Wet leather balls and balls inflated too hard stretch while underinflated leather balls stretch at the seams).\n\n2. All teams play with a number 5 ball, with a circumference of between 69 and 71 cm and a mass of approximately 450 grams (Balls with loose laces or uneven surfaces are not allowed).\n\n3. The u/9, u/11 and u/13 teams play with a number 4 ball, with a circumference of 64 cm.\n\n1. A ringball team consists of nine (9) players, viz., three (3) goal shooters, three (3) centre players and three (3) defenders. Only three (3) players of a team are allowed in each section.\n\n2. At least eight (8) players of a team must be present at the start of a game. A player who arrives late, is allowed to join the game only when the ball is out of play and with the permission of the referee. No team is allowed to play with seven (7) or less players after the game has started with eight (8) or nine (9) players; e.g. in the event of two (2) players of the same team being disqualified during the match. The team with the disqualified players forfeits the league points and the opposing team wins the match.\n\n3. No player is allowed to leave the court without the permission of the referee.\n\n4. A maximum of three (3) players of a team may be substituted at any time during the match. The substitution player may only join the team when the ball is out of play and with the permission of the referee.\n\n5. In the event of a sick or injured player who is unable to continue play, a substitute may immediately take up his place. A disqualified player may not be substituted.\n\n6. If the injured player only receives treatment and wants to return to continue play, no substitution player may take his position. Play continues with his team consisting of eight (8) players until he is ready to return to his position to continue play.\n\n7. In the event of all three (3) substitutes already participating any of the original players may return to the game. An injured player, if sufficiently recovered, may return at own risk. No new substitutes may be used.\n\n8. Injury time of two (2) minutes is allowed on court. In the event of a serious injury, time must be granted for the player to receive medical treatment on court or to be removed. Injury time shall be added to the half in question.\n\n9. A player experiencing any type of a bleeding must leave the court immediately and can be substituted. As soon as the bleeding has stopped, the player may rejoin the game with the permission of the referee. In the event of the player not returning within five (5) minutes, the substitute will then complete the game.\n\n1. A qualified neutral person should officiate at matches as referee.\n\n2. The referee shall enforce the rules and his decision is final. The referee's responsibility comprises, inter alia:\na) enforcing the rules and regulate the game uniformly.\nb) ensuring that the match progresses orderly and obviating irregularities.\nc) promoting the fluency of the match.\nd) ensuring that the court and the ball are suitable for play.\n\n3. The referee blows the whistle only:\na) to start or end the match.\nb) after a goal was scored.\nc) when any infringement of a rule occurs.\nd) when the ball goes out of play.\n\n4. The referee is ultimately responsible for the time and the score and, after consultation with the scorekeepers concerning the time and score, his decision is final.\n\n5. The referee must verify the time with the linesman during the match.\n\n6. The referee must verify the score during the interval. In the event where all three (referee and two (2) scorekeepers) differ, the referee’s score shall be accepted. When the scores of the two (2) scorekeepers are the same, their score shall be accepted after consultation.\n\n7. An appeal against a referee can only be lodged on the grounds of incompetence and/or for any prejudice against and/or favouritism towards a particular team. Any appeal or objection must be lodged in accordance with the controlling body’s constitution as well as the prescribed instructions.\n\n1. All matches consist of two periods of 25 minutes each with a half-time interval of three (3) minutes. The teams change ends at half-time.\n\n2. Should there be a tie during semi-final and final games, play will continue – 10 minutes on a side without half-time. Should it happen that it is still a tie after this additional time, the ball will be thrown up by the referee at the centre circle and the team that then scores the first goal, is the winner.\n\n3. Injury time should be added to the specific period of play. (In competitions where a siren is used to control the time for the matches, the competition rules should include rules concerning injury time.)\n\n4. Any intentional time wasting is penalised with a penalty. The following is considered as time wasting:\na) Taking time to get ready for the restart of the game\nb) Changing of players in the event of injury or voluntary substitution\nc) Putting in of the ball at the outside lines\nd) For the changing of shoes, clothes, etc.\ne) Tossing the ball away\n\n5. When time of play has run out, the game can only be ended as soon as the ball goes out of play or when a goal was scored.\n\n1. A successful goal counts two (2) points.\n\n2. A successful penalty goal counts two (2) points. A goal shooter may attempt a penalty goal from any position outside the goal circle when it is awarded at the first deliberate offence.\n\n3. At the second occurrence of inadmissible play, another penalty is awarded and the offending player is yellow carded.\n\n4. When the same player continuous with inadmissible play, another penalty is awarded. The offending player is red carded and disqualified for five (5) minutes.\n\n5. If the goal shooter attempts the penalty from behind the penalty line and is successful, three (3) points are awarded. It is the goal shooter’s own choice to attempt the penalty from behind the penalty line.\n\n6. A warning, yellow or red card can be awarded by the referee even after a goal has been scored.\n\n1. The referee\n\n2. Two (2) responsible scorekeepers – one (1) from each team who must present themselves to the referee just before the start of play. Team scorecards are not exchanged and the scorekeepers keep score independently.\n\n3. A linesman. The referee shall be assisted by a linesman with a flag. He assists the referee on the opposite side of the court by indicating when the ball is out of play. He shall thus indicate where and which team has to put the ball into play.\n\n4. The linesman must also assist the referee with time keeping.\n\n1. Spectators must remain one (1) metre from the outside lines of the court.\n\n2. Team managers must take up position on the opposite side from where the referee moves and one (1) metre from the outside lines of the court.\n\n3. Spectators are not allowed to interfere or hinder a goal shooter in his attempt to score a goal.\n\n4.

Lou Scheinfeld, former President of the Spectrum, explained that the name \"Spectrum\" was selected to evoke the broad range of events to be held there. \"The 'SP' for 'sports' and 'South Philadelphia,' 'E' for 'entertainment,' 'C' for 'circuses,' 'T' for 'theatricals,' 'R' for 'recreation,' and 'UM' as 'um, what a nice building!\" Scheinfeld also said that a seat in the city's first superbox initially cost $1,000 a year: \"For every Flyers game, Sixers game, circus, you name it, you got 250 events for $1,000.\" The Flyers won their first ever home game in this arena by defeating the Pittsburgh Penguins, 1–0. Bill Sutherland scored the arena's first goal.\n\nOn March 1, 1968, wind blew part of the covering off the Spectrum's roof during a performance of the Ice Capades, forcing the building to close for a month while Mayor Tate fought with then-Philadelphia County District Attorney Arlen Specter over responsibility for the construction of the roof, and the damage was repaired. The 76ers moved their home games to Convention Hall and to the Palestra, but neither of those arenas had ice rinks at the time, and there were no other NHL-quality sites in the Philadelphia area. Thus the Flyers hurriedly moved their next home game (against the Oakland Seals) to Madison Square Garden in New York followed by a meeting with the Boston Bruins played at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto before establishing a base at Le Colisée in Quebec City, home of their top minor league team, the AHL Quebec Aces, for the remainder of their regular season, marking the first NHL games in Quebec City in over four decades, and years before the Quebec Nordiques joined the NHL. (The roof was repaired in time to permit the Flyers to return to the Spectrum to open their first Stanley Cup playoffs against the St. Louis Blues on April 4, 1968; the opening faceoff came just as Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated in Memphis.) Similarly, in 1993, the Flyers played a day game against the Los Angeles Kings during a blizzard. A piece of flying debris smashed out one of the concourse windows, cancelling the game just after the first period.\n\nIn the 1970s, the venue's location on Broad Street and the reputation for fisticuffs that the Flyers had developed led to the nickname \"Broad Street Bullies.\"\n\nA plaque inside The Spectrum stated that it held the world record for the fastest conversion from Hockey to Basketball.\n\nThe Spectrum, along with the Met Center and The Forum, was one of the first sports arenas to have a scoreboard with a messageboard. Furthermore, the messageboards on the Spectrum scoreboard were the first dot matrix screens in pro hockey or basketball, capable of photos, animation, and replays as well as messages. This was replaced in 1986 with ArenaVision, which consisted of six 9-by-12-foot rear-projection videoscreens at the top and a four-sided American Sign and Indicator scoreboard at the bottom. Inside the videoscreens were General Electric projectors located 15 feet away from each screen.\n\nThe Flyers won their first Stanley Cup at the Spectrum on May 19, 1974, defeating the Boston Bruins, 1–0, in Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals in front of a then-capacity crowd of 17,007. Perhaps the most important and emotional hockey game—or sporting event of any kind—ever held there, however, came at the height of the Cold War on January 11, 1976, when the Flyers became the first NHL team to defeat (by 4–1) the vaunted hockey team of the Soviet Central Red Army (ЦСКА). Two games in the inaugural Canada Cup hockey tournament were also held at the Spectrum in September of that year, as the U.S. took on Czechoslovakia and the USSR.\n\nTen NHL or NBA playoff championship series were hosted at the Spectrum. The Flyers competed in the Stanley Cup Finals in , , , , , and . The 76ers played in the NBA Finals in , , , and . The 1976 and 1992 NHL, and 1970 and 1976 NBA All-Star Games were also held here. The AHL Phantoms also won their first Calder Cup title on Spectrum ice before a sellout crowd of 17,380 on June 10, 1998, by defeating the Saint John Flames, 6–1.\n\nThe Spectrum is the only venue to host the NBA and NHL All-Star Games in the same season, doing so in 1976, when it also hosted that year's Final Four. It is also one of a handful of venues to host the Stanley Cup and NBA Finals at the same time, doing so in 1980 (all four major Philadelphia teams would reach the championship round of their respective sport in the 1980 season).\n\nThe Spectrum was used for many basketball tournaments, including Big Five games, eight Atlantic 10 Conference tournaments (1977, 1983, 1997–2002), the 1975, 1980 and 1992 NCAA East Regional (site of the famous last-second shot by Christian Laettner of Duke to beat Kentucky), and the 1976 and 1981 Final Fours (both won by Bobby Knight's Indiana Hoosiers). Smaller conferences preferred holding tournament games at this venue over the larger Center nearby.\n\nIn 2003 and 2004, the PBR brought their Built Ford Tough Series tour to the Spectrum.\n\nMany concerts were been staged at the Spectrum beginning 1960s, often praised for its acoustic properties. In the 1970s, Electric Factory Concerts became the prominent concert promoter for the facility.\n\nThe Spectrum Theater was a venue for acts not big enough to fill the entire Spectrum arena. The stage was placed in the middle of the Spectrum floor, and the other half of the arena behind the stage was closed off with curtains, creating a theater-like environment. Some of the acts that played in this configuration included Frank Zappa in 1973, 1976 and 1977; David Bowie's Diamond Dogs Tour in 1974; The Kinks' Soap Opera Tour in May 1975, Bob Marley's Natty Dread Tour in 1975 and Kaya Tour in 1978; Bruce Springsteen in 1976; The Bee Gees in 1979; Peter Gabriel's tour in 1982, Jullian Lennon with Chris Bliss on June 20, 1986, and Howard Jones in 1987.\n\nThe 1995–96 NHL and NBA seasons were the final ones for the Flyers and the 76ers at the Spectrum. The Sixers' last game was a 112–92 loss to the Orlando Magic on April 19; on May 12, Mike Hough of the Florida Panthers scored the arena's final official NHL goal in the 2nd overtime of Game 5 of the 1996 Eastern Conference Semifinals. Although both the Flyers and 76ers moved across the parking lot to the new and larger Wells Fargo Center (then CoreStates Center), the arena remained in place and was used by the Philadelphia Phantoms of the AHL, the Philadelphia Kixx of the NISL, the Philadelphia Soul of the Arena Football League for Saturday home games, and a variety of other sporting events and concerts.\n\nThe Flyers and 76ers had been in need of a new facility for some time. One reason was the need for more revenue streams to meet skyrocketing operating costs. The Spectrum had relatively few luxury suites or other amenities common in newer arenas.\n\nIn addition, the arena's sight lines left much to be desired. Some seats in both the hockey and basketball configurations (especially those added in the upper level over the years) had badly obstructed views. There was only one concourse for all three levels, making for somewhat cramped conditions whenever attendance was anywhere near capacity.\n\nOn July 14, 2008, Comcast Spectacor Chairman Ed Snider officially announced that the Spectrum would be shuttered and torn down to make way for \"Philly Live!\", a proposed retail, dining and entertainment hub. \"This has been one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make,\" said Snider. \"The Spectrum is my baby. It's one of the greatest things that has ever happened to me.\"\n\nThe Phantoms commemorated the final season of the Spectrum by wearing a special patch on their uniforms, as illustrated on the right. The team also celebrated some of the building's memorable moments throughout the season. The Flyers marked the last season by playing two pre-season games at the Spectrum. They played the Carolina Hurricanes in an NHL pre-season game on September 27, 2008, and the Phantoms on October 7 of that same year. Before the game against Carolina, the Flyers honored the team captains in the franchise's history. Those honored in the pre-game ceremony were Lou Angotti, Ed Van Impe, Bob Clarke, Mel Bridgman, Bill Barber, Dave Poulin, Ron Sutter, Kevin Dineen, Éric Desjardins, Keith Primeau and Derian Hatcher.\n\nThe last NCAA basketball game the Spectrum hosted saw the Villanova Wildcats defeat the Pittsburgh Panthers on January 28, 2009. The Sixers played one regular season game against Chicago Bulls on March 13, 2009, winning by a score of 104–101 in the final NBA game in the Spectrum. The game was sold-out and attendance was 17,563.\n\nThe Phantoms' last regular season game at the Spectrum was played April 10, 2009, against the Hershey Bears, as the Phantoms won the game, 5–2, while the last Kixx game was against the Massachusetts Twisters on March 22. The Kixx moved onto the Temple University campus and played the 2009–10 season at the Liacouras Center. The Phantoms were sold to a Pittsburgh-based ownership group, and moved to Glens Falls, New York, for the 2009–10 season.\n\n\"With this season being the final season of the Wachovia Spectrum, we will celebrate the history of the Spectrum with an exciting, year-long, celebration of events,\" Comcast Spectacor President Peter Luukko said. Phish was rumored to be among the acts to commemorate the closing of the arena. \"It is our hope and intent to bring back many of the musical acts and entertainers who have made the Spectrum 'America's Showplace. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band played two shows at The Spectrum on April 28 and 29 as part of their Working on a Dream Tour, and returned on October 13–14 and 19–20 for their Spectrum swan song. Springsteen debuted a specially-written version of the song \"Wrecking Ball\", which he had written in honor of the demolition of Giants Stadium, with revised lyrics to honor the Spectrum. Springsteen's performances were followed by Pearl Jam on October 27, 28, 30 and 31 to close the building; their opening acts included Social Distortion on the 27th and 28th and Bad Religion on the 30th and 31st.\n\nA scheduled concert with Leonard Cohen on October 22 was moved to the Tower Theatre in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, instead. On October 23, 2009, Philadelphia area musicians The Hooters, Todd Rundgren and Hall & Oates headlined a concert titled \"Last Call\". Tickets were as low as $6.00. The remaining members of The Grateful Dead; including Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann performed their final set of shows at the Spectrum on May 1 and 2, 2009; the May 2 show was their 54th consecutive sell-out at the Spectrum. The Dead closed the May 2 show with the song \"Samson and Delilah\". The song contains the fitting refrain \"If I had my way, I would tear this old building down.\" The lyric was changed by the band's singer Bob Weir to say \"I wouldn't tear this old building down.\" With the demolition of The Spectrum, all venues at which The Grateful Dead played through their career within the City Of Philadelphia, except for the Irvine Auditorium, have succumbed to the wrecking ball.\n\nOpened in 1967 as the first of the five modern facilities to be built at the South Philadelphia Sports Complex between 1967 and 2004, by the time it closed in 2009 the Spectrum was the oldest of the four venues still standing of the two indoor arenas and four outdoor stadiums built at the South end of Broad Street since 1926. The complex's total area expanded with the addition of each new facility and now takes up the entire SE quadrant of the grounds occupied in 1926 by Philadelphia's Sesqui-Centennial International Exposition, a massive 184-day World's fair built on 700+ acres of until then largely undeveloped city owned swamp and park land (including League Island Park) adjacent to the U.S. Navy Yard bounded by 10th Street, Packer Ave., 23rd Street, and Terminal Avenue. The Spectrum itself occupied the portion of the Exposition's grounds on the south side of Pattison Avenue between Broad and 11th Streets that in 1926 served as the fair's main trolley terminal operated by the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company.\nFor its first 25 years, the Spectrum overlooked the 102,000-seat John F. Kennedy Stadium (known prior to 1964 as \"Municipal Stadium\") located roughly 600 feet south of the indoor arena. Opened on April 15, 1926, the stadium was also the Sesqui-Centennial Exposition's only intentionally permanent facility. The site of 42 Army–Navy Games between 1936 and 1979, JFK Stadium eventually fell into disuse in favor of the newer nearby Veterans Stadium, was condemned in 1989, and demolished in 1992 to make way for the Wells Fargo Center which opened four years later in August, 1996. Known earlier as the \"CoreStates Center\" (1996–1998), the \"First Union Center\" (1998–2003), and the \"Wachovia Center\" (July 2003 – June 2010), the 20,000-plus-seat indoor arena replaced the Spectrum as the home of the Flyers, 76ers, and Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League beginning with each club's 1996–97 season. With the demolition of the Spectrum, the Wells Fargo Center has now become the oldest of the complex's three current venues.\n\nThe Spectrum's closest sports complex neighbor was Veterans Stadium (opened 1971, closed 2003, demolished 2004) which was located north of the arena directly across Pattison Avenue. The 60,000-plus-seat \"Vet\" accommodated MLB's Philadelphia Phillies and the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles for just over three decades before it was itself replaced by two new facilities. In 2003 the Eagles moved to Lincoln Financial Field, a purpose built football/soccer stadium located SE of the Spectrum site directly across 11th Street from the Wells Fargo Center. The following year, the Phillies relocated to Citizens Bank Park, a dedicated baseball stadium completed in 2004 and located diagonally across from the Spectrum site at the northeast corner of Pattison Ave and Citizens Bank Way (11th St.), immediately east of the former Veterans Stadium site which now serves as a parking lot for the entire complex. In 2017, the Phillies' spring training complex in Clearwater, Florida was renamed Spectrum Field after Bright House Networks was purchased by Charter Communications. While named for Charter's residential service, the name invoked memories of the Spectrum arena.\n\nAlthough the Spectrum formally closed on October 31, 2009, demolition of the structure did not begin for more than a year with internal work commencing on November 8, 2010. Two weeks later a public \"wrecking ball ceremony\" attended by some of the athletes who made the building famous such as Hockey Hall of Famers Bernie Parent and Bob Clarke of the Flyers and Hall of Famer Julius Erving of the 76ers, was held in the adjacent parking lot \"H\" on November 23, 2010, to formally begin its external demolition. However, unlike Veterans Stadium, its one-time neighbor, which had been located immediately across Pattison Avenue from the Spectrum before it was imploded on March 21, 2004, the almost half-year process of demolishing the then-44-year-old arena, done without the use of explosives, was completed in May 2011.\n\nA 300-room hotel is planned to eventually be built on the demolished Spectrum's site (which is now occupied by a parking lot) as an adjunct to the \"Xfinity Live!\" project the first portion of which was opened in April, 2012, at the SW corner of 11th Street and Pattison Avenue.\n\nA statue of Sylvester Stallone, depicted in his role of Philadelphia boxer Rocky Balboa, stood for many years in front of the main (Pattison Avenue) entrance of the Spectrum, which had been represented in the movie as the site of Rocky's first and second fights with Apollo Creed. (The fight sequences were actually filmed at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena.) The statue was removed several times over the years to be used in the filming of sequels to the original film. In September 2006, it was given a new home in an area near the base of the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art not far from where a spot on the plaza at the top of the Museum's steps where it had appeared in the film \"Rocky III\". Since the statue was not deemed \"art,\" it was moved around the corner of the museum on Kelly Drive. Other statues that stood in the arena area included:\n\n\nThe statues have been incorporated into the design of \"Xfinity Live!\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3442519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3442519", "title": "Walt Disney World Speedway", "text": "Walt Disney World Speedway\n\nWalt Disney World Speedway was a racing facility located on the grounds of the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida, near Orlando, Florida.\n\nIt was built in 1995 by IMS Events, Inc., a subsidiary of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Corporation, and was designed primarily as a venue for the Indy 200 at Walt Disney World, an Indy Racing League event.\n\nThe circuit's primary use was as a venue for the Richard Petty Driving Experience, and the Indy Racing Experience, programs that allows fans to drive or ride in real race cars. After the 2000 racing season, it was no longer used as a track for major motorsports racing series, but was used by many racing teams from IndyCar to NASCAR as a test venue due to the warmer climate than other tracks around the United States during the off season for racing. The track closed permanently on August 9, 2015.\n\n\"AutoWeek\" magazine and the \"Orlando Sentinel\" dubbed the track \"The Mickyard\" (a portmanteau of the Disney icon Mickey Mouse and Indianapolis Motor Speedway's nickname, the \"Brickyard\").\n\nThe track was a three-turn tri-oval, designed by Indianapolis Motor Speedway chief engineer Kevin Forbes, and the location was chosen in September 1994 by Greg Ruse of Buena Vista Construction. The track was situated on a triangular plot of land adjacent to the Magic Kingdom's parking lot near Disney's Polynesian Resort. Plans for the track were first announced on January 23, 1995. The track was designed to fit within the boundaries of the existing infrastructure, requiring minimal rerouting of existing roads.\n\nOn June 27, 1995, Indianapolis Motor Speedway Chairman of the Board Mari Hulman George took part in a groundbreaking ceremony. She presented the track with one of the original paving bricks from the famous \"Brickyard.\" In a rather compact schedule, the one-mile (1.6 km) track was completed with ten miles (16 km) of safety restraint cabling, of fencing, of concrete for outside walls, of concrete for pit walls and 5,200 tons of asphalt for the track surface. Despite 1995 having the wettest June–July in Orlando on record (75 inches of rain), including Hurricane Erin, the construction was completed on-time, with final paving completed October 18, 1995.\n\nThe track was dedicated on November 28, 1995. Indy Racing League drivers Arie Luyendyk, Eddie Cheever, Eliseo Salazar, Lyn St. James and Davey Hamilton drove a five-car \"Flying V\" formation amongst fireworks. Initial testing at the facility for the Indy Racing League took place November 27–December 9, 1995.\n\nThe race track hosting its first car race, a Formula Ford 2000 support race on January 26, 1996 followed the next day with the Indy Racing League's Indy 200 car race. On February 7, 1997, the first racing experience program, the Richard Petty Driving Experience, opened at the Speedway.\n\nOn March 27, 2015, it was announced that the speedway would close on August 9, 2015 and be razed. Demolition began late August to make way for \"transportation improvements\", namely expanding and reconfiguring the Magic Kingdom parking lot and parking entrance.\n\nWalt Disney World Speedway was constructed on a very limited budget. By design, permanent features of the facility were built at a minimum. The track plans called for only the track surface, retaining wall, and catch fence to be constructed. The remainder of the facility, such as seating areas, restrooms, and race support areas would be built on a temporary, as-needed basis. This strategy had never been used on an oval race track, but had been widely successful for years in temporary street circuits (such as Long Beach). No permanent garages were built on the premises, but this was not entirely unusual. Race teams would simply work out of their transporters, a practice used frequently at street circuits and other tracks without garages.\n\nThe initial savings in construction costs was significant. Temporary bleachers and restroom facilities would be erected each year beginning in November, in preparations for the races in January. The lack of permanent grandstands also allowed track officials to adjust the configuration and capacity of seating annually reflecting ticket demand. This practice, however, would prove to be inconvenient and increasingly expensive in the long run since the grandstand area encompassed a portion of the Magic Kingdom parking lot. That area of the lot would be unusable for nearly three months, including during the busy Christmas and New Year's holiday season at the theme park.\n\nThree linked ponds in the track’s infield are formed in the shape of Mickey Mouse. The pond, dubbed \"Lake Mickey\", was built a year after the track opened due to drainage concerns.\n\nInitially, the track location, which was adjacent to the Magic Kingdom parking lot, was seen to be convenient. However, after a couple of years, traffic control on race days became overwhelming. Because race spectators would arrive at the same time and place as regular Magic Kingdom theme park guests, overflow parking was required. In 1996–1997, Disney officials reacted by parking all race spectators in the Magic Kingdom parking lot, and diverting all Magic Kingdom guests to the Epcot parking lot. Race spectators would walk to the nearby Speedway, while all guests to the Magic Kingdom were required to take the monorail or a bus from Epcot to the Transportation and Ticket Center. There, they would transfer to a monorail on the Magic Kingdom loop, a somewhat circuitous trip which resulted in numerous guest complaints. In 1997, the IRL race was shortened by a sudden rainstorm, causing fans to hurry to their cars and resulting in severe traffic gridlock on World Drive and surrounding roads which lasted for several hours.\n\nStarting in 1998, race spectators were diverted to park at Epcot, and were taken by shuttle bus to the Speedway while guests to the Magic Kingdom were directed to park, as usual, in the Magic Kingdom parking lot. While this eased many theme park guest complaints, it was now inconvenient for race spectators as it necessitated them to arrive earlier to account for the additional travel time. It additionally resulted in a significant cost increase in race operations, as the Disney Transport bus fleet was not big enough to accommodate the race shuttle operation. As a result, outside bus companies had to be hired to run the race shuttle service.\n\nIn its first few years of operation, the track was used frequently as a year-round test facility, due to the warm winter weather in Orlando. However, the track suffered three major accidents. During a week of preseason testing, on January 11, 1997, IRL driver Eliseo Salazar crashed in turn one. He suffered a fracture of his lower back, and missed two races. Two weeks later, on January 23, 1997, IRL driver Davy Jones broke his neck after a practice crash in turn three. On January 6, 2000, IRL driver Sam Schmidt was paralyzed after a crash in preseason testing. The track was built before the SAFER barrier was introduced, which many feel may have lessened the injuries in all three cases.\n\nAfter the 2000 IRL season, series officials and Walt Disney World were not able to come to an agreement for a race date for 2001. IRL officials were unsatisfied with the January date, as it was seen to be too early for most teams to be prepared for the season. There was typically a six-week gap until the second race of the season. Disney officials also were concerned with the impending conflict with Super Bowl XXXV, to be held in Tampa presumably the same weekend. Initial talks planned to move the race date to Labor Day weekend, and ultimately to a new facility to be built near U.S. 192. The NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series had already declined to renew its contract with the Speedway for similar reasons after 1998. The talks quietly ceased between the IRL and Disney, and the race was not scheduled for 2001. It was ultimately removed from the IRL schedule permanently.\n\nDuring the off-season in 1997, the track began hosting the Richard Petty Driving Experience, a stock car-based racing organization that allowed the general public to drive real NASCAR machines, or ride along with a professional driver and served as the track's primary function, year-round. It was the only track used by the \"RPDE\" that, weather permitting, operated roughly 365 days a year. To assist in the increased ingress and egress, a one-lane automobile tunnel was built for the 1997 season. In the summer of 1999, a new visitor's center and gift shop was built to permanently house operations for \"RPDE\". A new modest garage facility was built for them also. The operation had previously worked out of trailers and tents, without significant utilities.\n\nOn November 13, 2008, it was announced that track would be shared with the Indy Racing Experience, a similar program to \"RPDE\". The IndyCar two-seater machine would be used for fan ride-alongs, and Indy cars would also be available to be driven by fans. After appearing at various tracks on a largely irregular schedule, the Indy Racing Experience made the track its permanent year-round home.\n\nOn January 16, 2012, a new driving experience started business at Walt Disney World Speedway geared towards high end \"supercars\" called the Exotic Driving Experience. Modifications were made to the speedway's infield to create an \"Exotics Course\" which was a one-mile layout that ran clockwise and combined part of the oval with a street-style course.\n\n\n\nThe Indy Racing League IndyCar Series Indy 200 was the first event held at the track. The 1996 running marked the first race conducted by the IRL, and the original intent for the facility.\n\nThe Chevy Trucks Challenge was a NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series event held at the track from 1997–1998. It served as the season opening event of both years. The race was discontinued after 1998 due to the wide gap (10 weeks) it created until the second event of the season.\n\n\nThe Formula Ford Walt Disney World Challenge was a 50-lap, race for the USAC Formula Ford 2000 series. It was held as a support race to the Indy Racing League event for the first three years of operation.\n\n\nThe Silver Bullet 50 was a 50-lap, race for the USAC Silver Crown Series. During its first running, it was held in support to the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race. For 1999–2000, it was held as a support race to the Indy Racing League event.\n\n\nFrom 1995–2015, the track experienced one fatal accident. On April 12, 2015, driving instructor Gary Terry, 36, was fatally injured after a crash during a run as part of the Exotic Driving Experience. Terry was riding in the passenger seat of a Lamborghini Gallardo LP570-4 Superleggera, when the driver lost control and crashed into a metal guardrail. Terry died at the scene while the driver, identified as 24-year-old Tavon Watson, was transported to the hospital with minor injuries. Florida Highway Patrol investigated and announced that, while the decision to run vehicles clockwise (instead of counterclockwise as the track was designed for) may have been a factor in the incident, it was an accident and no charges were filed against the driver since it was on private property.\n\n"}

Mostly a volunteer organization, Adaptive Sports USA works in conjunction with local and regional sports organizations to develop and promote sanctioned sporting events for youths and adults with a physical disability. The mission of Adaptive Sports USA is to engage, evolve, and empower individuals with a disability to be involved in adaptive sport through education, coaching and advocacy. By creating a community outreach program, Adaptive Sports USA increases opportunities for individuals with a disability and are a gateway to regional, national and international multi-sport competitions.\n\nEach year Adaptive Sports USA sponsors the Adaptive Sports USA Junior Nationals (formerly the National Junior Disability Championships [NJDC]), the longest continually run competition for athletes with a physical disability in the United States.\n\nAdaptive Sports USA has a long and storied history in providing competitive sports opportunities to individuals with a disability. Founded in 1956 as the National Wheelchair Athletic Association, the early years of wheelchair sports were successful in large part due to the efforts of Benjamin Lipton, the Bulova Watch Company and the Bulova School of Watchmaking. Mr. Lipton was the Executive Director of the Bulova School of Watchmaking and served as the Chairman of NWAA for the first 25 years of its existence. Mr. Lipton ensured the viability of the organization during the early years by making the Bulova Company a primary financial supporter of NWAA. The initial impetus to organize NWAA grew out of the interests of athletes with disabilities - many of whom were veterans of World War II. They wanted to participate in sports other than basketball, a sport that had seen rapid growth in the early 1950s through teams sponsored by veterans hospitals and other rehabilitation agencies. General Omar N. Bradley was one of the leaders of the early efforts to develop wheelchair sports programs, principally for servicemen injured during the war. In the early days, many wheelchair basketball players saw participation in individual wheelchair sports as supplementary training for their primary interest in basketball. However, the NWAA program appealed to even greater numbers of athletes with disabilities due to the incorporation of women and athletes with quadriplegia, populations that could not be easily accommodated by Basketball. Europe’s first organized wheelchair sports program was introduced in 1948 by well-known neurosurgeon, Dr. Ludwig Guttman, founder of the Spinal Injury Center in Stoke Mandeville, England. The first Stoke Mandeville Games included only twenty-six participants, and few events (shot put, javelin, club throw, and archery) but growth in both the number of events and participants developed quickly.\n\nIn 1952, a team from the Netherlands was invited to compete with the British team. This was the first International Stoke Mandeville Games, an event that is generally recognized as the precursor to the present day Paralympic Games. The focus for NWAA and later, WSUSA, during the first four decades was competitive sports opportunities in the identified “core sports” for individuals utilizing wheelchairs for mobility. Following Mr. Lipton’s tenure, the national office of NWAA moved to Colorado Springs, CO in 1982 in an effort to be closer to the National Governing Bodies of the core sports of NWAA recognized by the US Olympic Committee. It was during this time frame that NWAA played a key role in putting competitive sports for athletes with disabilities on the international stage by promoting a series of exhibition events in Wheelchair Track at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.\n\nFrom its earliest beginnings to the present day, Adaptive Sports USA, has been directed and developed by wheelchair athletes and wheelchair sports enthusiasts themselves, individuals with a first-hand understanding to the values of participation. By and large, the needs of the athlete with a disability are not addressed by the vast network of athletic programs available to able-bodied persons through our educational system and community recreation agencies. Instead, the athlete with a disability has, with rare exceptions, developed his or her own resources and sports opportunities, from rules and governing structure (i.e., Adaptive Sports USA) to funding travel, equipment and other expenses of competition. Adaptive sports enthusiasts are involved at all levels of decision-making in the Adaptive Sports USA, and its constituent associations. Adaptive Sports USA, has remained essentially an all-volunteer organization, drawing on the energy and commitment of the people who also benefit from its programs. Adaptive sports have also been described as the most authentic of sports enterprises because the athletes compete and develop their own opportunities for the intrinsic values of participation – and not for the promise of professional contracts or financial reward. The dreams of individual athletes have been made possible through the efforts and dedication of pioneers such as Dr. Guttman and Lipton, and the countless other organizers, volunteers, friends, and supporters of adaptive sports throughout the United States and the rest of the world. With the continuing increase in public awareness, the future of adaptive athletic competition is indeed bright.\n\nIn 1994, the organizational name was changed to Wheelchair Sports, USA to more accurately reflect the organization’s mission. As a result of several Disabled Sports Organizations (DSO’s) dissolving that represented the sporting interests for a specific segment of the disabled population, including organizations representing athletes with Cerebral Palsy and “Les Autres” athletes, Wheelchair Sports, USA found its mission changing dramatically from providing sports opportunities to individuals using wheelchairs to serving as a comprehensive competitive sports organization for all individuals with a disability, both ambulatory and non-ambulatory. As a result, in 2010, the organizational name was changed to Wheelchair & Ambulatory Sports USA and in 2015 to Adaptive Sports USA in an effort to better describe the mission that evolved for the organization. It was also within this time frame that Adaptive Sports USA entered into a formal relationship with the International Wheelchair & Ambulatory Sports Federation (IWAS), an offshoot of the International Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Sports Federation. By virtue of this relationship, Adaptive Sports USA found itself with a mechanism for providing quality competitive opportunities for athletes seeking to establish themselves on an international stage. This relationship continues to the present.\n\nAdaptive Sports USA has managed to host the preeminent competitive sports event for junior athletes (6 - 22) with a disability in the United States continuously since 1984. Now known as the Adaptive Sports USA Junior Nationals (formerly the National Junior Disability Championships [NJDC]), the event has had several titles in its nearly 30 years of existence. The Junior Nationals is a week-long competition including Archery, Powerlifting, Swimming, Table Tennis, Track & Field, and other sporting events.\n\nJunior Nationals is an avenue for young athletes to showcase their abilities through sport and to promote physical activity and socialization. Additionally, the Championships serve as an opportunity for individuals to advance along the athlete pipeline that may one day lead them to compete at the international level and the Paralympic Games.\n\nJunior Nationals began in 1984 with three sanctioned events for wheelchair athlete’s ages 7 to 19 and is now the largest annual multi-sport event for juniors with physical disabilities and/or visual impairments in the United States. Junior Nationals is contested in a different city annually in July. This provides an opportunity for athletes to explore diverse areas of the country, travel costs to remain neutral and allows various Local Hosts the opportunity to gain experience in event management and build a legacy. Below is a history of the host cities:\n\nAdaptive Sports USA has three Regional Point Organizations (Western, Central and Eastern) dividing the United States for the purpose of coordinating, assisting and implementing local & regional meets; sanctioned, qualifying meets; and workshops & clinics for athletes and coaches in order to develop skills and knowledge. Adaptive Sports USA also serves as support and consultation to state high school associations, conferences and schools that desire to provide inclusive opportunities to their student-athletes in the areas of Archery, Powerlifting, Swimming, Table Tennis and Track & Field.\nAdaptive Sports USA is divided into three Regional Point Organizations: \"Western, Central and Eastern\".\n\n"}
