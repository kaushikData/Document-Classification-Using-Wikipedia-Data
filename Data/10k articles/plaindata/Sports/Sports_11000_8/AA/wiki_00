Malaysia is the eighth and the last FESPIC organisation member to host the FESPIC games after Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, China, Thailand, and South Korea. Around 3,641 athletes from 46 nations competed at the games which featured 19 sports. The games was opened by Prime Minister of Malaysia, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi at the KLFA stadium. \n\nThe final medal tally was led by China, followed by Thailand, South Korea, and host Malaysia. Several games and national records were broken during the games. The games were deemed generally successful with the rising standard of disabled sports competition among the Pacific and Asian nations for other active sports tournaments. With the games concluded, the FESPIC organisation was officially defunct, and since then, the Asian Countries participate at the Asian Para Games held after every Asian Games, beginning with the 2010 Asian Para Games in Guangzhou, China.\n\nIn 1999, Malaysia, New Zealand and Hong Kong formally submitted the bid for the games. With the withdrawal of New Zealand and Hong Kong from the bid, the hosting right was awarded to Malaysia which named its capital, Kuala Lumpur as the host city.\n\nThe KL'06 9th FESPIC Games Organising Committee was formed to oversee the staging of the games.\n\nThe 2006 FESPIC Games used a mix of new, existing and temporary venues. Most venues were public-sporting facilities which will revert to public use after the games. No major retrofitting work were done in most venues as most had been used to host major multi-disciplinary events such as the 1998 Commonwealth Games, 2001 Southeast Asian Games and the 2001 ASEAN Para Games.\n\nAt the centrepiece of the activities was the National Sports Complex. Incorporating the new 87,411-seat national stadium, it hosted most of the events.\n\nA games village was not built. Instead, a \"village in the city\" concept saw athletes and officials housed in 13 hotels across the Klang Valley. They are physically near to the assigned sports venues of the games, and was hoped that it will add vibe to the hosting venues and reduce post-games costs in converting a dedicated games village to other uses.\n\nThe Final FESPIC Games had 20 venues for the games. 11 in Kuala Lumpur, 7 in Selangor and 1 each in Putrajaya and Negeri Sembilan respectively.\n\nThe 2006 FESPIC Games logo is a heart-shape image which represents the spirit, passion and tradition of the FESPIC Games. The initial KL in the logo, represents Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of Malaysia as the venue of the Games, '06 represents to the year 2006, the heart shape in the '0' portrays the loving, caring and hospitality of the people of Malaysia, while the brush stroke sphere represents unity of the Malaysians.\n\nThe official mascot of the 2006 FESPIC Games is a pair of mousedeer named \"Ujang\", the male one and its female counterpart, \"Cek Mek\". The mousedeer is a native animal in Malaysia locally known as pelanduk or kancil which is shy, but very agile and quick thinking. It is a favourite character in local folktales commonly known as \"Sang Kancil\", noted for its intelligence, wit, cunning feints and quick reaction to escape from all kinds of danger, especially from its enemies. The adoption of mousedeer as the games mascot is to represent the courage of the Paralympic athletes in overcoming challenges and the odds. The names of the mascots, Ujang and Che Mek, are common nicknames for local Malay youths.\n\nThe opening ceremony was held on 25 November 2006 at the KLFA Stadium. The ceremony begins with the marching of the Malaysian Armed Forces along with the mascots of the games. This was followed by the firework display and the marching of the contingents of the participating nations. Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, then Prime minister of Malaysia, declared the games opened. Lee Seng Chow, the blind discus throw athlete then take the oath on behalf of the athletes. Finally the torch was lit by four Malaysian paralympic athletes, Razali Jaafar, Hisham Khaironi, Choo Kam Chan and David Wang.\n\nThe closing ceremony was held on 1 December 2006 at the KLFA Stadium. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA total of 1476 medals, comprising 542 Gold medals, 476 Silver medals, 458 Bronze medals were awarded to athletes. The host Malaysia's performance was their best ever yet and was placed fourth overall amongst participating nations.\n\n\n"}

It is currently the fourth biggest football stadium in Mexico by capacity.The stadium has been the host of the 1970 FIFA World Cup and the 1986 FIFA World Cup. From November 2014 – 2015, the stadium went through massive renovations.\n\nAs of November 2015, Cuauhtémoc Stadium is considered to be an innovation in textile design and sports architecture in Mexico, since it is the first and only stadium in Latin America to have a facade totally covered with ETFE.\n\nEstadio Cuauhtémoc has been the home for Puebla F.C. for the last 40 years and has witnessed various national and international tournaments the stadium has located in Puebla, Puebla Mexico.\n\nThe Stadium was originally designed in 1965 by architect Pedro Ramírez Vázquez, who also designed El Estadio Azteca and the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe.\n\nIt was inaugurated on October 6, 1968 during the pre-inauguration of the 1968 Summer Olympics. It is named after the Mexican brewery Cuauhtémoc-Moctezuma, who paid for most of the construction.\n\nIn its first years of existence the club had a capacity of 35,000, which was expanded in 1986 for the 1986 FIFA World Cup. A mural that had been painted by Jesús Corro Ferrer, which represented the human race, had to be covered up. The stadium has an official capacity for 42,648, though on some occasions it has had attendance of above 50,000 .The Stadium is the 4th largest, as well as the tallest, stadium in Mexico, behind the Estadio Jalisco in Jalisco.\n\nThe stadium has hosted 2 Mexican Primera División finals. The first came in the 1982-83 tournament when Puebla F.C. defeated C.D. Guadalajara\n\nThe second final was played in the 1989-90 tournament against Club Universidad de Guadalajara where Puebla managed to beat the club from Jalisco 4-3.The stadium has also hosted the now defunct Copa México tournament, which the club managed to win in 1990, becoming just the 5th stadium to host both finals and have its home team win.\n\nThe stadium has also hosted club international tournaments, such as the CONCACAF Champions League and Copa Interamericana. In 2008 the stadium was supposed to host its first Copa Sudamericana tournament, but did not after the CONCACAF decided to pull out of all CONMEBOL competitions due to the clubs' lack of interest in the domestic conference tournaments.\n\nEl Estadio Cuauhtémoc played host to the Uruguay national football team for the 1970 FIFA World Cup. In the first game on June 2, 1970 Uruguay defeated Israel 2-0. The second match was against Italy, which ended in a scoreless draw. The third match was against Sweden, where Uruguay fell 1-0. Players such as Sandro Mazzola and Luigi Riva went on to play in the finals against Brazil, which they lost to 4-1.\n\nIn 1986 Mexico hosted the 13th World Cup, becoming the first country to ever host the competition for a second time. This occurred due to Colombia announcing in 1983 that they were not going to be available to organize the tournament.\n\nIn this World Cup, Puebla played a bigger role than the previous one in 1970. This time, the defending champions Italy played at El Estadio Cuauhtémoc. Italy played against Argentina on July 5, 1986, where they tied 1–1 with a goal from the football legend Diego Armando Maradona.\nThe second game was against the Korea Republic national football team, who Italy managed to defeat 3–2.\n\nIn the round of 16 match, Argentina defeated Uruguay 1-0 in El Estadio Cuauhtémoc, which was played on June 5, 1986. In the Quarter Finals, the stadium hosted the match between Spain and Belgium which ended in a 1–1 draw, sending them to extra time, and ultimately to a penalty shootout. Van der Elst would score the final and deciding goal, sending Belgium to the semi finals. In that match, the stadium registered the biggest crowd with an attendance of 45,000.\n\nIn 2012 the state of Puebla was named to host the 2013 CONCACAF U-20 Championship .\n\nPuebla FC announced a complete renovation of the stadium that was set to begin in the late 2014. The stadium was old, in bad condition, and needed a fresh new image. In early 2014, the Governor of Puebla, Rafael Moreno Valle Rosas announced the official project.\n\nThe stadium would grow in capacity from 42,648 to 51,726 spectators, and would be completely remodeled from the inside, with 2 new ramps built in the north and south side of the stadium, along many other things.\n\nInitially the facade of the stadium would be covered with crystal. \n\nDünn Lightweight Architecture, experts in sports and textile architecture in Mexico and Latin America, made a new proposal with ETFE because of the many advantages that ETFE had over other materials for that particular project. \nETFE has been used in many world renowned architectural works, such as the Water Cube for the Olympics in Beijing, and by many European stadiums such as the Allianz Arena in Munich.\n\nRenovations started in November 2014 and were initially planned to be done by October 2015. Due to the city's rainy season, construction slowed down and in August 2015 it was announced that the construction would be done by November 2015.\nAs of November 2015, the Cuauhtémoc stadium would be the first and only stadium in Mexico and Latin America to have a facade completely covered with ETFE. \nOn November 18 the stadium was reopened in a friendly match against Boca Juniors of Argentina before Puebla's final week of Liga MX Apertura 2015.\n\n\n\n\n"}

They are worn by female gymnasts on the uneven bars, and by male gymnasts on the high bar and still rings; it is rare to wear them on the parallel bars. Grips are used to enhance the gymnast's grip on the apparatus and to reduce friction, which can cause painful blisters and \"rips\", in which outer layers of skin separate and tear away from the hand. \n\nGrips are optional and are not used by all gymnasts. Some athletes substitute sports tape or gauze for grips, while others use bare hands. Most gymnasts apply powdered chalk (typically magnesium carbonate) to their grips, or to their hands if not using grips so that they do not slip.\n\nA grip consists of a wide strip of leather joined to a wrist strap. The leather strip, which covers and protects the palm of the hand, is approximately five centimeters wide and has finger holes at one end. On properly fitted grips, the finger holes will be positioned at the first knuckles of the inserted fingers.\n\nSome types of grips, known as \"dowel grips\", incorporate a leather-covered dowel rod or pipe to create a linear bump on the outer face of the grip. This bump, in conjunction with the bar, forms a detent that serves to leverage the gymnast's grip, thus reducing the hand pressure needed to maintain a hold on the apparatus.\n\nThe wrist strap is used to secure the grip to the gymnast's hand and to transfer body weight from the fingers to the wrist. The grip is enhanced when the dowel rests on the apparatus, pulling the leather tight, and transferring some of the load to the wrist, reducing the grip required during the most dynamic elements. The leather portion of the grip encircles the wrist and is then locked in place with either velcro or buckles. Gymnasts typically wear soft material, such as cloth wristbands, under the wrist straps to prevent skin chafing. Some brands of grips include soft, removable pads that fit under the wrist straps.\n\nMost competitive gymnasts wear dowel grips. On the high bar, men use grips that have three finger holes and a small dowel, whereas grips used on the still rings have a larger dowel and two finger holes. Grips used on the parallel bars (Very uncommon) have two finger holes and a small dowel. Women's grips have two finger holes and resemble men's ring grips with a smaller dowel.\n\nGymnasts at lower competition levels and those participating in recreational gymnastics typically use grips without dowel rods. Such grips provide no mechanical advantage for gripping the bar; they are used primarily to minimize friction injuries. These grips are usually less expensive and are made of thinner leather.\n"}

In addition, the team failed to win in the final stages of the season, year after year, repeated regularly and culminated in the early playoff exits. \n\nOn 3 March 2009, Innsbruck announced its intention to leave the Erste Bank Hockey League for financial reasons and resume play in the second tier, the Austrian National League.\n\nTheir return season in the new league was completed with a successful squad that consisted mainly of young Tyrolean players. The club finished the regular season first, seven points ahead of the runner-up Dornbirner EC. In the final Innsbruck were defeated by the Vorarlbergians, losing the series 3 games to 1. Two years later, the club succeeded in winning the second division National League Championship, for the first time in franchise history. A short time later it was announced that Innsbruck would return to the top-flight EBEL league.\n\nThe Innsbruck Sharks' home games are played at the OlympiaWorld Innsbruck complex, which hosted the Winter Olympic Games in 1964 and 1976. Innsbruck have the luxury to play at two home venues within the complex, after first primarily using the Olympiahalle Innsbruck which seated approximately 8,000, which was renovated for the 2005 IIHF World Championship. \n\nIn 2005, the Sharks moved to also play in the smaller capacity and purpose built Tyrolean Ice Arena which seats 3,200. The Olympiahalle is now used sparingly, specially to cater for larger crowds on important rival games or playoff games.\n\n"}

{"id": "21939688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21939688", "title": "Invictus (film)", "text": "Invictus (film)\n\nInvictus is a 2009 American-South African biographical sports drama film directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon. The story is based on the John Carlin book \"Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation\" about the events in South Africa before and during the 1995 Rugby World Cup. The Springboks were not expected to perform well, the team having only recently returned to high-level international competition following the dismantling of apartheid—the country was hosting the World Cup, thus earning an automatic entry. Freeman and Damon play, respectively, South African President Nelson Mandela and François Pienaar, the captain of the South Africa rugby union team, the Springboks.\n\n\"Invictus\" was released in the United States on December 11, 2009. The title refers to the Roman divine epithet Invictus and may be translated from the Latin as \"undefeated\" or \"unconquered\". \"Invictus\" is also the title of a poem, referred to in the film, by British poet William Ernest Henley (1849–1903). The film was met with positive critical reviews and earned Academy Award nominations for Freeman (Best Actor) and Damon (Best Supporting Actor).\n\nOn 11 February 1990, Nelson Mandela is released from Victor Verster Prison after having spent 27 years in jail. Four years later, Mandela is elected the first black President of South Africa. His presidency faces enormous challenges in the post-Apartheid era, including rampant poverty and crime, and Mandela is particularly concerned about racial divisions between black and white South Africans, which could lead to violence. The ill will which both groups hold towards each other is seen even in his own security detail where relations between the established white officers, who had guarded Mandela's predecessors, and the black ANC additions to the security detail, are frosty and marked by mutual distrust.\n\nWhile attending a game between the Springboks, the country's rugby union team, and England, Mandela recognises that the black people in the stadium are cheering for England, and not their own country, as the mostly-white Springboks represent prejudice and apartheid in their minds; he remarks that he did the same while imprisoned on Robben Island. Knowing that South Africa is set to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup in one year's time, Mandela persuades a meeting of the newly black-dominated South African Sports Committee to support the Springboks. He then meets with the captain of the Springboks rugby team, François Pienaar (Matt Damon), and implies that a Springboks victory in the World Cup will unite and inspire the nation. Mandela also shares with François a British poem, \"Invictus\", that had inspired him during his time in prison.\n\nFrançois and his teammates train. Many South Africans, both black and white, doubt that rugby will unite a nation torn apart by nearly 50 years of racial tensions, as for many black people, especially the radicals, the Springboks symbolise white supremacy. Both Mandela and Pienaar, however, stand firmly behind their theory that the game can successfully unite the South African country.\n\nThings begin to change as the players interact with the fans and begin a friendship with them. During the opening games, support for the Springboks begins to grow among the black population. By the second game, the whole country comes together to support the Springboks and Mandela's efforts. Mandela's security team also grows closer as the racially diverse officers come to respect their comrades' professionalism and dedication.\n\nAs Mandela watches, the Springboks defeat one of their arch-rivals—Australia, the defending champions and known as the Wallabies—in their opening match. They then continue to defy all expectations and, as Mandela conducts trade negotiations in Taiwan, defeat France in heavy rain to advance to the final against their other arch-rival: New Zealand, known as the All Blacks. New Zealand and South Africa were universally regarded as the two greatest rugby nations, with the Springboks then the only side to have a winning record (20–19–2) against the All Blacks, since their first meeting in 1921.\n\nBefore the game, the Springbok team visits Robben Island, where Mandela spent the first 18 of his 27 years in jail. There, Pienaar is inspired by Mandela's will and his idea of self-mastery in \"Invictus\". François mentions his amazement that Mandela \"could spend thirty years in a tiny cell, and come out ready to forgive the people who put [him] there\".\n\nSupported by a large home crowd of all races at Ellis Park Stadium in Johannesburg, Pienaar motivates his teammates for the final. Mandela's security detail receives a scare when, just before the match, a South African Airways Boeing 747-200 jetliner flies in low over the stadium. It is not an assassination attempt though, but a demonstration of patriotism, with the message \"Good Luck, Bokke\"—the Springboks' Afrikaans nickname—painted on the undersides of the plane's wings. Mandela also famously arrives onto the field before the match wearing a Springbok cap and a replica of Pienaar's #6 jersey.\n\nThe Springboks complete their run by beating the All Blacks 15–12 in extra time, thanks to a drop goal from fly-half Joel Stransky. Mandela and Pienaar meet on the field together to celebrate the improbable and unexpected victory, and Mandela hands Pienaar the William Webb Ellis Cup, signaling that the Springboks are indeed rugby union's world champions. Mandela's car then drives away in the traffic-jammed streets leaving the stadium. As Mandela watches South Africans celebrating together in the street from his car, his voice is heard reciting \"Invictus\" again.\n\n\nThe film is based on the book \"Playing the Enemy: Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation\" by John Carlin. The filmmakers met with Carlin for a week in his Barcelona home, discussing how to transform the book into a screenplay. Filming began in March 2009 in Cape Town. Primary filming in South Africa was completed in May 2009.\n\nMorgan Freeman was the first actor to be cast, as Mandela. Matt Damon was then cast as team captain François, despite being significantly smaller than him and much smaller than members of the current Springbok squad.\nHe was given intensive coaching by Chester Williams, another star of the 1995 team, at the Gardens Rugby League Club. \"In terms of stature and stars, this certainly is one of the biggest films ever to be made in South Africa,\" said Laurence Mitchell, the head of the Cape Film Commission. On March 18, 2009, Scott Eastwood was cast as flyhalf Joel Stransky (whose drop goal provided the Springboks' winning margin in the 1995 final).\nOver Christmas 2008, auditions had taken place in London to try to find a well-known British actor to play Pienaar's father, but in March it was decided to cast a lesser-known South African actor instead.\nZak Fe'aunati, who had previously played professionally for Bath, was cast as Jonah Lomu, while Grant L. Roberts was cast as Ruben Kruger, who was the Springboks' other starting flanker in 1995. Chester Williams was also involved with the project to teach rugby to those of the cast playing players who had not played it before, while Freeman and Williams also became involved with the ESPN 30 For 30 film \"The 16th Man\". Filming of the final also took place on location at Ellis Park Stadium, the actual venue for the 1995 final.\n\n'Suzie' was not a character in the film and there was no reference to the health issues in the New Zealand squad.\n\n\"Invictus\" opened in 2,125 theaters in North America at #3 with US$8,611,147 and was the largest opening for a rugby-themed film. The film held well and ultimately earned $37,491,364 domestically and $84,742,607 internationally for a total of $122,233,971, above its $60 million budget.\n\nThe film was released on May 18, 2010 on DVD and Blu-ray Disc. Special features include\nThe Blu-ray release included a digital copy and additional special features:\n\nThe film was met with generally positive reviews. Review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes reports that 76% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 237 reviews, with an average score of 6.6/10. The website's critical consensus is: \"Delivered with typically stately precision from director Clint Eastwood, \"Invictus\" may not be rousing enough for some viewers, but Matt Damon and Morgan Freeman inhabit their real-life characters with admirable conviction.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 74 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nCritic David Ansen wrote:\n\nAnthony Peckham's sturdy, functional screenplay, based on John Carlin's book \"Playing the Enemy\", can be a bit on the nose (and the message songs Eastwood adds are overkill). Yet the lapses fade in the face of such a soul-stirring story—one that would be hard to believe if it were fiction. The wonder of \"Invictus\" is that it actually went down this way.\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film three-and-a-half stars and wrote:\n\nIt is a very good film. It has moments evoking great emotion, as when the black and white members of the presidential security detail (hard-line ANC activists and Afrikaner cops) agree with excruciating difficulty to serve together. And when Damon's character—François Pienaar, as the team captain—is shown the cell where Mandela was held for those long years on Robben Island. My wife, Chaz, and I were taken to the island early one morning by Ahmed Kathrada, one of Mandela's fellow prisoners, and yes, the movie shows his very cell, with the thin blankets on the floor. You regard that cell and you think, here a great man waited in faith for his rendezvous with history.\n\n\"Shave Magazine\"s Jake Tomlinson wrote:\n\nEastwood's film shows how sport can unify people, a straightforward and moving message that leaves audiences cheering. The sports, accurate portrayal and the solid storyline earn this movie a manliness rating of 3/5. However, the entertainment value, historical accuracy and strong message this movie delivers earn it an overall rating of 4.5 stars. Definitely, worth seeing.\n\n\"Variety\"'s Todd McCarthy wrote:\n\nInspirational on the face of it, Clint Eastwood's film has a predictable trajectory, but every scene brims with surprising details that accumulate into a rich fabric of history, cultural impressions and emotion.\n\nDon Beck, who had helped the rugby team succeed in 1995 as a close friend and adviser to coach Kitch Christie and team captain François Pienaar, found the film faithful to the true story. He remarked: \"I thought it was steady and balanced.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6427823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6427823", "title": "Joseph Miller (cricketer)", "text": "Joseph Miller (cricketer)\n\nJoseph Miller (died October 1784) was a noted English cricketer who is generally considered to have been one of the greatest batsmen of the 18th century. He is mostly associated with Kent but also made appearances for All-England and Surrey. First recorded in the 1769 season, Miller made 65 known appearances (including single wicket) from then to 1783, though he certainly played in many matches of similar status whose records have been lost or are incomplete. He was unquestionably an outstanding batsman and perhaps second only to John Small in the 18th century. He made numerous good scores as the match details consistently show.\n\nThe first mention of a player called Miller in important matches was in the Caterham v Bourne match on Friday, 10 June 1768. This Miller was playing for Caterham, a Surrey team, while the \"crack\" batsman of the 1770s played invariably for Kent-based teams. Caterham won the match by 14 runs and Miller scored 3 and 20. Apart from the result and the individual scores, no other details have survived. He was next recorded in 1769 playing for Caterham against Hambledon at Guildford Bason, Hambledon winning by 4 wickets. No details of individual performances have survived except a brief report that Hambledon's victory was due to the batting of John Small and John Bayton.\n\nMore is known about Miller's career from 1772 when scorecards began to be kept on a habitual basis. The first definite mention of him is in a \"fives\" single wicket match between Kent and Hampshire at the Artillery Ground in June 1772. He took part in all three important matches recorded in the 1772 season. In the second, playing for All-England against Hampshire at Guildford Bason, he was top scorer for his team in both innings with 30 out of 126 and then 26 out of only 86.\n\nIn 1773, he scored a total of 316 runs in his 7 known important match appearances with a best score of 73 (out of 177) for All-England v Hampshire at Sevenoaks Vine on 28 & 29 June. His innings enabled All-England to win by an innings and 51 runs. When Kent played Surrey at Sevenoaks Vine in August 1773, Miller scored 42 out of 141 in the first innings and then an unbeaten 32 out of 100–4 in the second innings, leading Kent to a 6 wickets victory. Haygarth recounts how a poem called \"The Kentish Cricketers\" was composed after this match. It was in reply to a poem called \"Surrey Triumphant\", a parody of \"Chevy Chase\" which had apparently been published earlier that season. In September 1773, Miller played as a \"given man\" for Surrey v Hampshire at Laleham Burway and, again, two good scores enabled his team to win by 8 wickets. He scored 37 out of 120 in the first innings and an unbeaten 30 out of 64–2 in the second innings.\n\nMiller's best known performance was for Kent v Hampshire at Sevenoaks Vine in August 1774 when he made 95 out of 240 and enabled Kent to win by an innings and 35 runs. A week later, in the return match at Broadhalfpenny Down, Miller scored 40 and 45 out of 168 and 136–6 as Kent won by 4 wickets.\n\nMiller's innings of 95 was briefly the highest individual score recorded in first-class cricket (i.e., since the \"statistical record\" began in 1772), beating the 88 scored by William Yalden in 1773. Miller’s \"world record\" lasted only a year until John Small beat it with the earliest known first-class century.\n\nMiller was less successful in 1775 and experienced a number of low scores but he did play two notable innings of 71 for Kent v Hampshire and then 42 for Surrey against Hampshire. He had an indifferent season in 1776 but then recovered his form in 1777 when he made a total of 311 runs in 6 known appearances including scores of 65, 64 and 51 in three separate matches for All-England against Hampshire. He made a few useful scores in 1778 when his best was 59 for Surrey against Hampshire.\n\nMiller made only one more half-century which was a score of exactly 50 for All-England against Hampshire at Itchin Stoke Down in September 1780. His date of birth is unknown but, as he had been playing since the 1760s, he must have reached the veteran stage by the 1780s and his scores were less notable than they had been a decade earlier. Apart from a few useful contributions, Miller was by 1782 playing a minor role. He made 3 known important match appearances in 1783, his final season, and his last known match was Kent v Hampshire at Bourne Paddock in August. Hampshire won by 85 runs and, if the batting order in the scorecard is correct, Miller batted last and scored just 2 and 9.\n\nArthur Haygarth's biography of Miller quotes John Nyren's comment that Miller had a beautiful style and was as \"firm and steady as the Pyramids\". He was a man \"to be depended on and very active\" as well as being \"a kind-hearted and amiable man\".\n\nNyren also says that Miller and John Minshull were \"the only two batsmen (i.e., in the 1770s) that the Hambledon men were afraid of\". He comments on Miller's ability to \"cut a ball at the point of the bat\" and adds, slightly contradicting Haygarth's version, that \"although (Miller was) fully as stout a man as Minshull, he was considerably more active\".\n\nLittle is known about Miller personally except that he seems to have been a gamekeeper employed by the Duke of Dorset at Knole House near Sevenoaks. Latterly, he took up residence with Sir Horatio Mann at Bourne, probably in the same employment. His burial took place at Bridge, Kent on 31 October 1784, only a year after his last recorded match.\n\nMiller's first name may be subject to question for, although he is generally known as Joseph, he has also been referred to as Richard, though that would seem to be due to confusion with the Richard Miller (possibly his brother) who played alongside him in one match for Surrey in the 1774 season. In his \"Cricket Scores\", H. T. Waghorn records that \"Richard Miller\" played for Kent against Surrey at Laleham Burway in June 1773 but in Haygarth's version of this scorecard, he has listed the player as \"J. Miller\".\n\nThe majority of sources call him J. or Joseph although Nyren, a great admirer of Miller, uses his surname only.\n\nHaygarth, who studied all of the old scorecards and biographical material available, acknowledges that \"there seems to have been two (Millers) but it is almost certain that J was the \"crack\" and played in the great contests of the day\". G. B. Buckley does not attempt to correct Haygarth re Miller in his appendix of additions and amendments to \"Scores and Biographies\" and thereby accepts that J. Miller is the correct version.\n\n"}

It has been completed and opened to the public in December 2006, replacing the old Ernst-Grube-Stadion. It is mostly used for football matches and hosts the home matches of 1. FC Magdeburg.\n\nThe stadium is a fully covered football-only stadium, i.e. without an athletics track. It has a capacity of 25,910 people. The stadium has 64 seats for persons with disabilities. Furthermore, 40 press seats are available. The maximum distance from the pitch is 32 meters. The floodlight is attached to the stadium's roof, as well as the two 30m screens. The pitch is long and wide, it has under-soil heating. Total cost of construction was 31 million Euros. In the 2016–17 3. Liga season, Magdeburg drew the highest average home attendance (17,100), followed by MSV Duisburg (14,175) and Hansa Rostock (11,433).\n\nThe first stadium at this location had been inaugurated on 14 April 1912 as the home of SV Victoria 96 Magdeburg. In 1914, it hosted the final to the German championship between Spielvereinigung Fürth and VfB Leipzig. In 1937 it was bought by the Allianz insurance company after Victoria had gone bankrupt. During World War II the stadium was completely destroyed by bombing.\nAfter World War II the city of Magdeburg planned to erect a sports center consisting among others of a stadium with a capacity for 80,000 people and a natatorium. However, the city was unable to acquire the site originally intended and so the project was abandoned. Instead, the city decided to build a new stadium east of the Elbe river, at the site of the Victoria stadium. In order to erect the stands, about 5.3 million cubic ft of rubble were transported from the ruins of the city. The stadium was equipped with an athletics track and was opened in front of a crowd of 40,000 on 18 September 1955. Over the years, it was upgraded several times, parts of the stands were put under a roof, and floodlights were installed. However, after the reunification of Germany the stadium fell into disrepair and in 2004 the city council decided to build a new one at the same site. The Ernst-Grube-Stadion was demolished between March and June 2005, and construction of the new stadium began on 4 July 2005.\n\nThe first match was held on 19 December 2006. In front of a crowd of 13,279, hosts 1. FC Magdeburg came to a nil-all draw against Eintracht Braunschweig. In the inaugural match, 1. FC Magdeburg lost 0–3 to Bundesliga side SV Werder Bremen, this time 24,300 spectators had come. In the remaining matches of the season, 10,800 spectators came to see 1. FC Magdeburg play on average. The first international match was held on 29 July 2007 when the German women's national team beat their Danish counterparts 4–0 in front of 10,735 spectators.\n\nIn 2009, the stadium hosted the 2009 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship final.\n\nIn July 2009, local ISP and cable TV company MDCC announced they had signed a five-year sponsorship agreement with the stadium operator under which the stadium would be known as MDCC-Arena.\n\nOn 20 October 2010, the American Football Verband Deutschland e.V. announced that the German Bowl, the championship game of the German Football League – an American football competition, would be held in the MDCC-Arena for three iterations, beginning with the 2011 championship.\n\nThe kick-off spot grass patch from the 2014–15 Regionalliga promotion round match against Kickers Offenbach on 27 May 2015, was auctioned on eBay on 30 May 2016. The money raised was used for the development of 1. FC Magdeburg's youth team.\n\nFollowing a refurbishment of the guest terraces and seating in early 2016, the stadium capacity was reduced to 25,910, including 21,510 seats.\n"}

The site was previously home to Columbus Auto Parts, an OEM factory supplying the automobile industry, which stood vacant for decades between the Conrail railroad tracks and Interstate 71 before its demolition in the '90s.\n\nMapfre Stadium opened on May 15, 1999 as Columbus Crew Stadium with a match between the home side and the New England Revolution. It is the second soccer-specific stadium built in the country, after Steel Athletic Field was built in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in 1913, and the first Major Leaue Soccer stadium constructed in the United States. It has been credited with inspiring the wave of construction of soccer-specific stadiums throughout the league. In the 2010 Showcase issue of \"Stadia Magazine\", Ian Nuttall stating \"Who'd have thought when it opened in 1999 that Major League Soccer's first purpose-built stadium would kick-start the wave of dedicated soccer-specific stadiums that continue today?\"\n\nAfter nearly 15 years of the stadium not having a corporate sponsor, the Crew announced naming rights were sold to Madrid-based Mapfre Insurance on March 3, 2015. The team had been searching to sell stadium naming rights since it opened in 1999, but had been unable to come to an agreement. Mapfre maintains an office in Columbus and has its U.S. base in Boston.\n\nIn addition to hosting the Crew SC home games, Mapfre Stadium has also hosted other Major League Soccer and professional soccer events. It was the site of the 2001 MLS Cup championship and was the host stadium for the Major League Soccer All-Star Game in 2000 and 2005. Both the United States men's and women's national teams have played numerous matches at Mapfre Stadium, most notably, the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifier in February 2001 between the U.S. and Mexico known as \"La Guerra Fria\" (The Cold War) due to sub-freezing temperatures. During the 2003 Women's World Cup, the stadium was one of the venues used during the group stage of the tournament. In 2018, Mapfre Stadium was one of three sites selected to host the SheBelieves Cup. \n\nMapfre Stadium has also hosted events outside of professional soccer. The NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship was held at Mapfre Stadium in 2001 and 2003. In 2002, it hosted the Steinfeld Cup, the championship game of Major League Lacrosse. In June 2010, MAPFRE Stadium hosted the inaugural USA Sevens Rugby Collegiate Championship Invitational.\n\nThe venue is a regular site for Ohio High School Athletic Association state championship tournaments in both American football and soccer. In the local Columbus area, it is the site for the annual Westerville Football Classic, featuring the Westerville Central, Westerville North, Westerville South, and New Albany football teams. It has also been host to the local high school football rivalry of parochial schools Bishop Watterson High School and St. Francis DeSales High School.\n\nThe 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup was played in the United States. Mapfre Stadium hosted several group game matches.\n\nSince the opening of Mapfre Stadium, it has been a regular site for the United States men's national soccer team matches, hosting ten games through 2013. The men's national team held an unbeaten record of 8–3–0 in all competitions, outscoring opponents 19–1. This was until the U.S. was beaten by Mexico on Veterans Day 2016.\n\nThe stadium has hosted five consecutive World Cup qualifying matches against Mexico, with the U.S. winning four of the five matches by the same score of 2–0 (with the U.S. fans adopting the rallying cry of \"dos-a-cero\").\n\nThe national team was beaten by Mexico on November 11, 2016, by a score of 1–2, prompting Mexico's first ever win in Columbus, and the U.S.'s first World Cup qualifying defeat on home soil in 15 years. It hosted a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Guatemala on March 29, 2016, which the US won, 4–0.\n\nSince the opening of Mapfre Stadium, it has hosted two MLS Cup Finals; once as a neutral site, and once as home side Columbus Crew SC played host. The latter occurred following a 2012 MLS rules change which did away with a neutral site for the Final, and instead has the club with the best overall regular season record hosting the match.\n\nThe stadium hosts numerous concerts annually, most notably Rock on the Range, an annual festival of performances by rock bands, since 2007, and concerts by Rascal Flatts to close out the Ohio State Fair in 2006, 2007 and 2009. A permanent stage, built in 2008, was constructed in the north end of the stadium to accommodate concerts after the closing of Germain Amphitheater. The addition replaced about 2,100 seats in the north end.\n\n\n"}

The school changed from a winter-only program to a traditional school calendar in 1981, and changed its name to National Sports Academy on March 17, 1989.\n\nThe school covers grades 9-12 and is located in the former Winterset Inn, which housed Italian athletes during the 1980 Winter Olympics. The schools main building which houses cafeteria, dorm rooms and classrooms is located directly across from Mirror Lake. The average number of boarding students is around 200 Students per year. The school is located steps from the Olympic Center which is a massive sports facility which houses 3 Hockey rinks and was home to the 1932 and 1980 Olympic Hockey competitions where the United States famously won the Gold medal (1980). The Olympic Center is the home practice and game facility for all of the National Sports Academy hockey players and speed skating athletes. The varsity A boys and girls teams practice daily and host all home games on the Herb Brooks Arena which is a 13,450 seat arena with a full Olympic sized sheet of ice. Players use the weight rooms, basketball courts and other amenities in the Olympic Center to help train them off ice. Outside is the Olympic Speed skating oval which has hosted many international competitions, most notably the 1932 and 1980 Olympic games. Alpine skiers are fortunate enough to have one of the best locations in the US for the advancement of their skills. Skiers train at the Olympic Training Center which hosts winter sport athletes from the US and other countries who are living in Lake Placid or in town to train for extended periods of time.

Polo shirts are short sleeved.\n\nAll three terms may be used interchangeably. Polo shirts are usually made of knitted cotton (rather than woven cloth), usually a piqué knit, or less commonly an interlock knit (the latter used frequently, though not exclusively, with pima cotton polos), or using other fibers such as silk, merino wool, synthetic fibers, or blends of natural and synthetic fibers. A dress-length version of the shirt is called a polo dress.\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, tennis players ordinarily wore \"tennis whites\" consisting of long-sleeved white button-up shirts (worn with the sleeves rolled up), flannel trousers, and ties. This attire presented problems for ease of play and comfort.\n\nRené Lacoste, the French seven-time Grand Slam tennis champion, felt that the stiff tennis attire was too cumbersome and uncomfortable. He designed a white, short-sleeved, loosely-knit piqué cotton (he called the cotton weave \"jersey petit piqué\") shirt with an unstarched, flat, protruding collar, a buttoned placket, and a shirt-tail longer in back than in front (known today as a \"tennis tail\"; see below), which he first wore at the 1926 U.S. Open championship. \n\nBeginning in 1927, Lacoste placed a crocodile emblem on the left breast of his shirts, as the American press had begun to refer to him as \"The Crocodile\", a nickname which he embraced.\n\nLacoste's design mitigated the problems that traditional tennis attire created:\n\n\nIn 1933, after retiring from professional tennis, Lacoste teamed up with André Gillier, a friend who was a clothing merchandiser, to market that shirt in Europe and North America. Together, they formed the company Chemise Lacoste, and began selling their shirts, which included the small embroidered crocodile logo on the left breast.\n\nBefore Lacoste's 1933 mass-marketing of his tennis shirt, polo players wore thick long-sleeve shirts made of Oxford-cloth cotton. This shirt was the first to have a buttoned-down collar, which polo players invented in the late 19th century to keep their collars from flapping in the wind (Brooks Brothers' early president, John Brooks, noticed this while at a polo match in England and began producing such a shirt in 1896). \n\nBrooks Brothers still produces this style of button-down \"polo shirt\". Still, like early tennis clothing, those clothes presented a discomfort on the field, and when polo players became aware of Lacoste’s invention in the 1930s they readily adopted it for use in polo.\n\nIn 1920, Lewis Lacey, a Canadian born of English parents in Montreal, Quebec, in 1887,haberdasher and polo player, began producing a shirt that was embroidered with an emblem of a polo player, a design originated at the Hurlingham Polo Club near Buenos Aires.\nThe term \"polo shirt\", which previously had referred only to the long-sleeved, buttoned-down shirts traditionally used in polo, soon became a universal moniker for the tennis shirt; by the 1950s, it was in common usage in the U.S. to describe the shirt most commonly thought of as part of formal tennis attire. Indeed, tennis players often would refer to their shirt as a \"polo shirt\", notwithstanding the fact that their sport had used it before polo did.\n\nIn 1972, Ralph Lauren included his \"polo shirt\" as a prominent part of his original line Polo, thereby helping further its already widespread popularity. While not specifically designed for use by polo players, Lauren's shirt imitated what by that time had become the normal attire for polo players. As he desired to exude a certain \"WASPishness\" in his clothes, initially adopting the style of clothiers like Brooks Brothers, J. Press, and \"Savile Row\"-style English clothing, he prominently included this attire from the \"sport of kings\" in his line, replete with a logo reminiscent of Lacoste's crocodile emblem, depicting a polo player and pony. \n\nThis worked well as a marketing tool for, subsequently, the immense popularity of Lauren's clothing led a majority of English-speaking westerners to begin referring to Lacoste's tennis shirt as a \"polo shirt\". Still, \"tennis shirt\" remains a viable term for all uses of Lacoste's basic design.\n\nOver the latter half of the 20th century, as standard clothing in golf became more casual, the tennis shirt was adopted nearly universally as standard golf attire. Many golf courses and country clubs require players to wear golf shirts as a part of their dress code. Moreover, producing Lacoste's \"tennis shirt\" in various golf cuts has resulted in specific designs of the tennis shirt for golf, resulting in the moniker \"golf shirt\". \n\nGolf shirts are commonly made out of polyester, cotton-polyester blends, or mercerized cotton. The placket typically holds three or four buttons, and consequently extends lower than the typical polo neckline. The collar is typically fabricated using a stitched double-layer of the same fabric used to make the shirt, in contrast to a polo shirt collar, which is usually one-ply ribbed knit cotton. Golf shirts often have a pocket on the left side, to hold a scorepad and pencil, and may not bear a logo there.\n\n\n"}
