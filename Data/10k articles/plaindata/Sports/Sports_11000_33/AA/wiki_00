Each panellist votes for their top two choices; their first preference is awarded two points, and their second preference is awarded one point. The winning coach is the one with the largest points total. In the case of a points tie, the person chosen as first preference by the most panellists is the winner. If this is also a tie the award is shared.\n\nThe first recipient of the award was association football manager Alex Ferguson, in 1999. The award has been presented to a football manager on five occasions. It has been awarded to four Britons, and five of the other six winners were European. Daniel Anderson, the only winner from the Southern Hemisphere, was in his native Australia at the time of the awards, so the then St. Helens captain, Paul Sculthorpe, collected it on his behalf.

The games are open to all who wish to participate, without regard to sexual orientation, and there are no qualifying standards. Competitors come from many countries, including those where homosexuality remains illegal and hidden.\n\nThe 1994 Gay Games, held in June in New York City to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, the modern start of the LGBT movement, \"overtook the Olympics in size\" with 10,864 athletes compared to 9,356 at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and 10,318 at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.\n\nThe Federation of Gay Games (FGG) is the sanctioning body of the Gay Games. From its statement of concept and purpose:\n\nThe 1982 games took place in San Francisco from August 28 to September 5, 1982. Singer Tina Turner performed at the opening ceremonies, and Stephanie Mills performed at the closing ceremonies. The original sports that were offered at the first Gay Games were; basketball, billiards, bowling, cycling, diving, golf, marathon, physique, powerlifting, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track and field, volleyball and wrestling. 1,350 competitors whose origins ranged from over 170 cities worldwide competed in the first Gay Games.\n\nThe 1986 games took place in San Francisco from August 9 to 17, 1986. Singers Jennifer Holliday and Jae Ross were the featured performers during the closing ceremonies. There was an increase of competing athletes in the second Gay Games participants to over 3,500.\n\nThe 1990 games took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, from August 4 to 11, 1990. Approximately 7,300 athletes took part in 27 sports, with another 1,500 cultural participants attending. Opening and closing ceremonies were at BC Place Stadium (20 years later to be the site of the 2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony and the 2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony). This was the first games to be held outside the United States, and it is also notable for being the first games in which Masters world records were set (two, in swimming).\n\nThe event was also heralded by controversy from social conservatives. A Fraser Valley church's members took out full page ads in \"The Vancouver Sun\" and \"The Province\" condemning the event as proof of an \"impending sodomite invasion\" and encouraging residents to gather at Empire Stadium to pray against the event. The government of then-Premier Bill Vander Zalm refused to fund the event.\n\nOriginal video documentation, photographs, and textual records related to Celebration '90 Gay Games III, originally gathered by Forward Focus, artist Mary Anne McEwen's production company and official videographer of the Games. The items are available via VIVO Media Arts Centre's archive, both in-person by appointment or digitally online. The fond includes 143 unedited 30-minute Betacam recordings of sporting competitions, cultural events, opening and closing ceremonies, backstage activities and interviews with organizers, athletes, artists, community representatives, and opponents. The fond also includes 240 photographs, Celebration ’90 ephemera, and extensive textual materials, including the Official Program. McEwen was a Vancouver-based LGBTQ activist, Gayblevision co-founder, and co-organizer of the first Out On Screen Film and Video Festival. The footage was shot in anticipation of a feature-length documentary entitled, “Legacy: The Story of the Gay Games” that McEwen was unable to complete due to insufficient funding. McEwen, a longtime VIVO member, bequeathed her personal archive to VIVO hoping that this footage would be made widely available.\n\nThe 1994 games took place in New York City, New York, from June 18 to 25, 1994.\n\nThe games coincided with the 25th-anniversary events of the Stonewall riots and were themed on \"Unity\". Actor Sir Ian McKellen gave the closing address at Yankee Stadium on June 25, 1994.\n\nThere were over 15,000 participants that either competed in the sporting events or in cultural ceremonies in the Gay Games of 1994. Greg Louganis, a prominently known homosexual diver and world champion, competed in the 1994 New York Gay Games. The sporting events of Gay Games IV expanded to thirty one from previous years, including but not limited to, flag football, figure skating, and the first ever internationally sanctioned women's wrestling.\n\nThe 1998 games took place in Amsterdam, Netherlands, from August 1 to 8, 1998. The opening and closing ceremonies took place in the Amsterdam Arena.\n\nThe 2002 game took place in Sydney, New South Wales, from November 2 to 9, 2002. Sydney won the bid to host the games from other contenders which were Montreal, Toronto, Long Beach/Los Angeles and Dallas. The Games opening included a speech by out gay High Court of Australia Justice Michael Kirby and were officially opened by New South Wales Governor Professor Marie Bashir. When Gay Games VI was chosen to be in Sydney, Australia it was partially because of already present GLQBTI sport teams. The aspect of Western sports and culture is integrated into the Sydney Gay Games due to the advertisement, emphasizing the turnout of GLQBTI men of Western origin and that had enough money for travel.\n\nGay Games VII were held in Chicago, Illinois, from July 15 to July 22, 2006. For more on the controversy surrounding Chicago's selection as host city, see Schism in LGBT sports communities over Gay Games VII below.\n\nOn March 16, 2005, the FGG announced that Cologne, Germany; Johannesburg, South Africa; and Paris, France, were the official candidate cities for Gay Games VIII in 2010. Cologne was elected at the FGG annual meeting in Chicago on November 14, 2005.\n\nThe games were held in Cologne from July 31 to August 6, 2010. This marked the second time the games were held in Europe, with the first being in Amsterdam in 1998.\n\nOn March 17, 2009, the FGG announced that groups from Boston, Massachusetts; Cleveland, Ohio; and Washington, D.C., were finalists for the bidding to host Gay Games IX.\n\nOn September 29, 2009, at the FGG Site Selection Meeting in Cologne, Germany, Cleveland was chosen as presumptive host of Gay Games IX in 2014. The host organization, Cleveland Special Events Corporation, later expanded the host city to include nearby Akron, Ohio. They also chose to style their event as \"Gay Games 9\" rather than the traditional Roman numeral \"Gay Games IX\".\n\nOn July 31, 2012, the FGG announced that seven cities had been approved as prospective bidders. The groups were from Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Limerick, Ireland; London, United Kingdom; Orlando, Florida, United States; Paris, France; and a group proposing to host the Gay Games in either Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo, Brazil.\n\nBy August 31, 2012, a letter of intent to bid were received from all groups except those in Brazil.\n\nIn December 2012, the FGG announced that several requests from bidders to add new sports to the program of the games. Of these requests, that for the inclusion of polo was rejected, while those for archery, boxing, fencing, pétanque, roller derby and wheelchair rugby were approved. Of these, boxing, pétanque, roller derby and wheelchair rugby were included in the bids of the three finalist bidding organizations.\n\nBid books were provided by February 28, 2013 with a Q&A held over April & May 2013. A shortlisting vote took place on May 31, 2013 resulting in the shortlisting of Limerick, London and Paris as the final three cities to continue on the 2018 Bid cycle. Shortlisted cities received a 4-day visit (inspection sites) from a team of FGG inspectors (4 delegates + 1 CM) in July 2013. The final vote took place in Cleveland (Ohio, USA) during the 2013 Annual General Assembly. On 7 October, Paris was elected host city for the 2018 Gay Games.\n\nHong Kong was announced as the host city of the 11th Gay Games, at a gala event at the Hotel de Ville in Paris, on 30 October 2017. They won with a clear majority of votes, in the first round of voting. It is the first time that the Gay Games will be held in Asia.\n\nThe \"longlist\" of cities interested in bidding to host Gay Games XI in 2022 was announced in April 2016. An unprecedented seventeen cities were interested in bidding. On 30 June 2016, the Federation of Gay Games announced that eleven cities had submitted their Letter Of Intent to formally bid. Anaheim, Atlanta, Des Moines, Madison, Minneapolis and San Antonio decided not to pursue their option to bid. On 31 July 2016, 9 cities submitted their second registration fee to remain in the bid process. Both Cape Town and Tel Aviv dropped out at this stage, stating an intention to bid for Gay Games XII in 2026. On 30 November 2016, Bid Books were submitted by eight candidate cities with Los Angeles dropping out at this stage.\n\nA shortlist of three Candidate Cities was announced on 1 March 2017. Guadalajara, Hong Kong and Washington DC hosted site visits before the final decision on the host city was made in Paris on Monday 30 October.\n\nThe host city for Gay Games XII will be announced at an Annual General Meeting of the Federation of Gay Games. The meeting will take place in Hong Kong in the autumn of 2021.\n\nAt this early stage, evidence on social media exists for an exploratory bid by Brisbane, Australia and Brighton & Hove, United Kingdom. Anecdotal evidence from the 2022 bid process also suggests that Tel Aviv, Israel, will bid again, seeking to bring the Gay Games to the Middle East for the first time.\n\nDr. Tom Waddell, the former Olympian who helped found the games, intended them to be called the \"Gay Olympics\", but a lawsuit filed less than three weeks before 1982's inaugural Gay Olympics forced the name change.\n\nEvent organizers were sued by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) under the U.S. Amateur Sports Act of 1978, which gave the USOC exclusive rights to the word \"Olympic\" in the United States. Defendants of the lawsuit contended that the law was capriciously applied and that if the Nebraska Rat Olympics and the Police Olympics were not similarly prohibited, the Gay Olympics should not be either.\n\nSome, like Jeff Sheehy, coauthor of San Francisco's domestic-partner legislation and former president of the Harvey Milk Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Democratic Club, believed homophobia to be a motivation behind the lawsuit. They cited the authorized use of the word \"Olympics\" by the Special Olympics and other organizations as evidence of this homophobia.\n\nOthers, like Daniel Bell, cite the IOC's long history of protecting the Olympics brand as evidence that the lawsuit against the \"Gay Olympics\" was not motivated by discrimination against gays. Since 1910 the IOC has taken action, including lawsuits and expulsion from the IOC, to stop certain organizations from using the word \"Olympics.\" Annual \"California Police Olympics\" were held for 22 years, from 1967 through 1989, after which, the word Olympics was no longer used for the event. The Supreme Court ruled for the USOC in \"San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Committee\".\n\nA 2009 documentary film, \"Claiming the Title: Gay Olympics on Trial\", was created in the United States and was previewed at several film festivals. The subject was also included in a 2005 film by David Sector, \"Take the Flame! Gay Games: Grace Grit & Glory\".\n\nIn the years since the lawsuit, the Olympics and the Gay Games have set aside their initial hostilities and worked cooperatively together, successfully lobbying to have HIV travel restrictions waived for the 1994 Gay Games in New York and the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.\n\nPlans to launch a complementary Gay Winter Games, scheduled for February 1986 in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, collapsed, due to a lack of sufficient funding and logistical problems. There have been no subsequent attempts to launch a Gay Winter Games since, although Whistler, British Columbia, Canada, hosts an annual gay winter-sports festival.\n\nIn 2001, the bidding organization from Montreal, Quebec, Canada, won the right to negotiate with the FGG for a licensing agreement to host the 2006 Gay Games, but after two years of failed negotiations Montreal broke off talks at the 2003 FGG annual meeting in Chicago. There were three main points of contention, over which neither party could agree:\n\n\nIn a weakening global economy following international terrorist attacks, including the September 11 attacks, the FGG wanted Montreal to be able to plan for a successful Gay Games even if participation did not meet Montreal's optimistic projection of 24,000 participants, twice the level of participation of the previous Gay Games in 2002. Due to financial problems in previous events, the FGG also asked for transparency into Montreal 2006's financial activities. After Montreal refused to continue talks, the FGG held a second round of bidding in which Chicago and Los Angeles bidders, who had put forth well-received bids to host the 2006 games in the first round along with Montreal and Atlanta, chose to bid. Ultimately, the FGG awarded Gay Games VII to Chicago Games, Inc.\n\nThe Montreal organizing committee nevertheless decided to proceed to hold an athletic and cultural event without the sanction of the FGG; this plan developed into the first edition of the World Outgames, and the creation of its licensing body, the Gay and Lesbian International Sport Association.\n\nDue to limited personal and organizational resources, many individual and team participants were forced to choose between Gay Games Chicago and World Outgames Montreal, a situation exacerbated by the two events being a week apart. The closing ceremony of Gay Games Chicago on July 22, 2006, was only seven days before the opening ceremony of World Outgames Montreal on July 29, 2006. This meant that those who competed or performed in Chicago would have little recovery time before Montreal. The split resulted in a lower quality of athletic competition at both events because neither could claim the whole field of competitors. Team and individual sports were hurt alike. \n\nFew teams were able to field complete squads for both events. In wrestling, 100 wrestlers competed in Chicago (comparable to previous Gay Games), but only 22 competed in Montreal, by far the lowest number for any major international tournament.\nThere were some advantages to the games being so close together time wise and location wise. For some overseas participants who had to travel far, the convenience of the two events being only a week apart and not far from each other enabled them to attend both. Many did not attend at all. After Chicago drew 9,112 sport and cultural participants, of which 7,929 were from the USA. Montreal drew 10,248 athletes, 1,516 Conference Attendees and 835 people to the cultural component of the games reflecting more than 111 countries more 60% of the organization's original projections.\"\n\nSince 2006, the need for a secondary global multisport event has been the subject of much debate, especially after the final financial figures for 2006 were released. In 2012, a round of negotiations between the FGG and GLISA ended after a mutually agreed deadline. The board of GLISA unanimously agree to the proposal set forth by the negotiation teams, however the FGG board did not reciprocate. The Chicago Gay Games VII ended with no debt and all bills paid. In contrast, the Montreal World Outgames ended with $5.3 million (Canadian) of debt.\n\nIn addition, the lack of attendees and participants at both events resulted in GLISA (the organization which heads the Outgames) changing the years of the event to precede the years of the Gay Games, meaning that the World Outgames were held in 2009 in Copenhagen and the Gay Games held in Cologne in 2010, while the World Outgames were held in 2013 in Antwerp and Gay Games were held in 2014 in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nBefore and during the time of the 1986 Gay Games there was mass media about Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and how it was affecting the gay community. With the number of LGBT members at the Gay Games the founder Waddell took this time try and break the stereotype of the AIDS with a show of athleticism the Gay Games had to offer. This also was a time that volunteers would provide safe sex materials along with condoms to educate the public.\n\n"}

{"id": "44268016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44268016", "title": "Norwood–Port Adelaide rivalry", "text": "Norwood–Port Adelaide rivalry\n\nThe Norwood–Port Adelaide rivalry is Australian rules football's oldest and one of its most intense rivalries. It is contested between the Norwood Football Club and the Port Adelaide Football Club. Together Port Adelaide (36) and Norwood (30) have won 66 South Australian National Football League (SANFL) premierships since the founding of the competition in 1878. As the SANFL competition has been suspended due to war, only 132 seasons have been played, therefore together Norwood and Port Adelaide have won exactly half of all SANFL premierships awarded. The two clubs have met in finals 50 times with 17 of those grand finals including 2 war-time grand finals.\n\nThe two clubs first played each other in 1878. The rivalry's origins go back to 1884, when Port Adelaide ended Norwood's run of six consecutive premierships. During the 1880s and 1890s matches between Norwood and Port Adelaide would often attract around 12,000 spectators which would be equivalent to over 10% of Adelaide's population of the time. \n\nIn 1893 when describing the Norwood–Port Adelaide rivalry the Advertiser stated that \"Just as the more faithful amongst the tribes of the East feel it incumbent on them to pay a periodical visit to Mecca, so do lovers of the king of winter games feel it almost an essential duty on their part to journey to the Adelaide Oval on the Queen's Accession Day, in sunshine or rain, to witness a trial of strength between those great and old rivals the Port Adelaide and Norwood clubs.\" In 1960, Norwood would bring Port Adelaide's own run of six premierships to an end defeating them by 27 points in the Preliminary Final. As of 2017, the two clubs are the only clubs in any of the elite Australian Rules Football leagues (the SANFL, WAFL, and VFL/AFL) to win six successive premierships.\n\nPort Adelaide and Norwood are located on opposite sides of Adelaide, with the north-western side of the city traditionally being associated with blue-collar workers and the eastern side of the city white-collar professionals. This economic split is reflected in house prices with Norwood properties in 2015 commanding an average $900,000 whereas Port Adelaide properties are around a third of that at $315,000.\n\nTalk of a side from South Australia entering the Victorian Football League (VFL) was fast-tracked in 1987 when a team from Western Australia, the West Coast Eagles, and a team from Brisbane, the Brisbane Bears joined the VFL. This left South Australia as the only mainland state in Australia without a team in an increasingly national competition. By 1989 seven out of ten SANFL clubs were recording losses and the combined income of the SANFL and West Australian Football League (WAFL) had dropped to 40% of the VFL. During early 1990 the SANFL decided to wait three years before making any further decision in regards to fielding a South Australian side in the VFL until it could be done without negatively affecting football within the state. Frustrated with lack of progress, Port Adelaide held secret negotiations in the town of Quorn regarding entering the VFL in 1991. From these discussions, Port Adelaide accepted an invitation from the VFL (which had since been renamed the Australian Football League). The AFL signed a heads of agreement with the club in expectation that Port would enter the competition in 1991, meaning the Port Adelaide Football Club would field two teams, one in the AFL and one in the SANFL.\n\nDuring the 1990 preseason Port Adelaide played a practice match against Geelong at Football Park in front of 35,000 spectators. When the knowledge of Port Adelaide's negotiations to gain an AFL licence were made public, the rest of the SANFL and many other people across the state saw it as an act of treachery. SANFL clubs made an application to the Supreme Court of South Australia for an injunction against the bid, which Justice Olsson agreed to. The AFL suggested to the SANFL that if they did not want Port Adelaide to join the AFL, they could put forward a counter bid to enter a composite South Australian side into the AFL. After legal action from all parties, the AFL finally agreed to accept the SANFL's bid and the Adelaide Football Club was born.\n\nThe fallout from the failed bid resulted in some calling for Port Adelaide to be expelled from the SANFL. However, Port Adelaide continued to compete and continued to dominate. The Magpies followed their triple triumphs from 1988 to 1990 with a premiership in 1992 and three in a row again from 1994 to 1996, then again in 1998 and 1999.\n\nIn 1994, the AFL announced it would award a second AFL licence to a South Australian club. Adelaide's Channel 7 broadcaster ran a phone poll asking whether Port Adelaide should get the second licence with 74% of the 6000 respondents saying 'yes'. However a licence did not guarantee entry and although a target year of 1996 was set, this was reliant upon an existing AFL club folding or merging with another. In 1996, the cash-strapped Fitzroy announced it would merge with the Brisbane Bears to form the Brisbane Lions. A spot had finally opened and it was announced that in 1997, one year later than expected, Port Adelaide would enter the AFL.\n\nWhat was Port Adelaide's first win over Norwood in its 10th attempt would also be the point of much contestation. Norwood and the SAFA would strip the game of premiership points for a rematch later in the year. This was due to an umpire disallowing a Norwood goal kicked by Watson due to believing it was touched by Port Adelaide player Gliddon .\n\nThe final game of the 1884 season held on Saturday 30 August was essentially a playoff for the premiership as it guaranteed the winner top spot on the association ladder. Therefore, considerable interest was built up for the game with the crowd approximately 5,000 attending. Norwood, having won the last six premierships in a row, met Port Adelaide who were yet to win a premiership. The result comfortably went the way of Port Adelaide, much to the dismay of Norwood.\n\nThe first premiership-deciding match in a major Australian rules football was held on Saturday 5 October 1889 in South Australia. At the time Norwood were reigning Australian champions. The game was required as Norwood and Port Adelaide finished the season with an identical win–loss ratio. The teams entered the first break with scores level at three goals each. Only one goal was scored in the second quarter by Norwood, with the wind substantially effecting play. Port wrestled back to even the ledger during the third quarter, but only briefly as Norwood kicked a goal late in the period with the scores into the final quarter being five goals to four. Norwood had the ascendancy in the last period of game and although Port kicking its fifth goal it was to no avail. The final score was seven goals to five in Norwood's favour. The match was one of the seeds to the intense rivalry between Port Adelaide and Norwood.\n\nThe 1904 Grand Final was a memorable one for Norwood who were down by 35 points at three-quarter time against traditional rival Port Adelaide. Norwood then produced an extraordinary burst of football with a goal by centre half-forward Dean Dawson followed by two goals each from full forward, Bill Miller and half-forward flanker, Stan Robinson. Norwood was only two points down with a minute remaining. Tommy Gibbons held a mark on a seemingly impossible angle. His kick sailed through the goal posts to give Norwood a four-point victory, 9.8 to 8.10.\n\nThe 1957 SANFL Grand Final holds the record for the largest crowd of 58,924 between the two clubs. This remains the fourth largest crowd for a football match in South Australia. Norwood led the match for the majority of the day but Port Adelaide's five-goal-to-two final quarter allowed them to win by 11 points claiming their fourth premiership in a row.\n\nPort Adelaide had finished the home and away season as minor premier and looked on track to make rebound from the previous week's loss against North Adelaide to attempt to win its seventh consecutive premiership. Norwood, who had finished the home and away season in third place was desperate to beat Port Adelaide in the preliminary final in order to prevent the Magpies from bettering its run of six consecutive premierships set from 1878 to 1883. The weather was unfavourable, with a large amount of rain causing the ground to become slush. Commentators considered it one of the most brutal finals played in memory. The game was in the balance heading into the final quarter with the scoreboard reflecting the scrappy nature of the game; Norwood 3.14 (32) lead Port Adelaide 3.10 (28). Norwood managed to adapt to the conditions in the final quarter kicking 5.1, whereas Port Adelaide could only muster 1.2. The final scores were in favour of Norwood 8.11 (59) to Port Adelaide 3.14 (32). It is a coincidence that Norwood brought an end to Port Adelaide's run of six premierships from 1954–1959 as Port Adelaide did the same to Norwood's run of six between 1878–1883. After the match during the dark of night Haydn Bunton Jr and John Vickers went to Black Diamond Corner in Port Adelaide and painted it red and blue.\n\nThe game was close all the way through and Norwood was leading by two points deep into time on when Trevor Growden gave Scott Hodges a free kick in the north-west pocket of Football Park. Scott Hodges from 45m out on an angle of 45 degrees kicked the goal after missing easier shots throughout the match. This would be the two clubs final encounter before Port Adelaide entered the Australian Football League.\n\nThe vast majority of the games played between Port Adelaide and Norwood have been at Alberton Oval, Norwood Oval, Football Park, and Adelaide Oval.\n!1\n!0\n!2\n!2\n!5\n!3\n!6\n!1\n!3\n!3\n!4\n!3\n!4\n!1\n!5\n!3\n!1\n!1\n!6\n!2\n!3\n!1\n!3\n!6\n!2\n!3\n!8\n!1\n!5\n!3\n!1\n!2\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!1\n!5\n!1\n!5\n!2\n!1\n!1\n!3\n!3\n!1\n!1\n!4\n!2\n!3\n!1\n!7\n!2\n!4\n!1\n!5\n!2\n!4\n!2\n!2\n!5\n!3\n!4\n!3\n!3\n!6\n!8\n!9\n!49\n!55\n!22\n!15\n!5\n!10\n!24\n!26\n!6\n!2\n!36\n!10\n!50\n!4\n!6\n!31\n!47\n!15\n!16\n!6\n!4\n!16\n!32\n!20\n!28\n!13\n!14\n!14\n!28\n!12\n!21\n!38\n!5\n!37\n!50\n!20\n!4\n!31\n!27\n!48\n!15\n!39\n!36\n!38\n!81\n!37\n!61\n!70\n!29\n!26\n!19\n!22\n!20\n!46\n!8\n!83\n!2\n!38\n!61\n!9\n!8\n!10\n!29\n!2\n!43\n!41\n!8\n!6\n!7\n!5\n!28\n!48\n!33\n!5\n!41\n!1\n!3\n!101\n!19\n!11\n!26\n!9\n!31\n!45\n!11\n!68\n!13\n!16\n!5\n!10\n!25\n!63\n!31\n!1\n!41\n!54\n!8\n!29\n!28\n!7\n!64\n!27\n!17\n!24\n!43\n!31\n!2\n!24\n!21\n!12\n!19\n!59\n!6\n!25\n!10\n!12\n!34\n!2\n!48\n!26\n!28\n!16\n!12\n!3\n!10\n!22\n!57\n!21\n!22\n!21\n!9\n!16\n!5\n!44\n!9\n!29\n!11\n!9\n!10\n!57\n!22\n!2\n!18\n!24\n!63\n!39\n!109\n!41\n!42\n!10\n!117\n!11\n!29\n!45\n!42\n!45\n!93\n!41\n!3\n!29\n!3\n!27\n!41\n!3\n!40\n!2\n!22\n!60\n!16\n!61\n!57\n!30\n!2\n!5\n!38\n!20\n!10\n!12\n!1\n!58\n!29\n!20\n!10\n!18\n!26\n!20\n!38\n!36\n!22\n!54\n!68\n!35\n!36\n!34\n!68\n!26\n!18\n!86\n!30\n!41\n!31\n!74\n!82\n!2\n!10\n!15\n!69\n!41\n!34\n!37\n!33\n!6\n!108\n!90\n!55\n!18\n!36\n!1\n!46\n!7\n!22\n!112\n!19\n!7\n!2\n!62\n!43\n!32\n!9\n!25\n!32\n!25\n!80\n!66\n!29\n!6\n!82\n!29\n!34\n!8\n!52\n!29\n!60\n!5\n!74\n!60\n!46\n!27\n!82\n!15\n!21\n!16\n!22\n!7\n!43\n!43\n!75\n!22\n!27\n!60\n!42\n!17\n!58\n!92\n!7\n!16\n!88\n!74\n!13\n!4\n\n!3\n!18\n!28\n!9\n!63\n\n"}

It started as an organised activity in Sweden around 2016 and spread to other countries in 2018, following increased concern about plastic pollution. As a workout, it provides variation in body movements by adding bending, squatting and stretching to the main action of running.\n\nAuthor David Sedaris combines litter picking with exercise in the Parham, Coldwaltham and Storrington districts of West Sussex, taking up to 60,000 steps a day in pursuit of local rubbish. He was so effective in keeping his neighbourhood clean that the local authority named a waste vehicle in his honour. The Lord Lieutenant of West Sussex, Susan Pyper, said \"The sign on this truck is a very fitting way to say a huge ‘thank you’ to David for his tireless efforts ... he is a real local hero.\"\n\nErik Ahlström started plogging in the Swedish capital city, Stockholm, when he moved there from the Åre ski resort. He created the website Plogga to organise the activity and encourage volunteers.\n\nThe Keep America Beautiful organisation is now promoting plogging to its affiliates and has found that some already combined exercise with clean up, such as the \"Trashercize\" program in Tennessee. In New York, a Meetup group, \"Plogging NYC\", had about 100 members in 2018, with events in four boroughs. In Indianapolis in 2018, a Summer of Plogging was organised by the November Project and the local affiliate of Keep America Beautiful.\n"}

This is a kind of Rugby World Cup for the over-35s.\n\nThe island is also quite small measuring no more than twenty-one square miles.

{"id": "10031721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10031721", "title": "Tomato can (sports idiom)", "text": "Tomato can (sports idiom)\n\nIn boxing, kickboxing or mixed martial arts, \"tomato can\" or simply \"tomato\" or \"can\" is an idiom for a fighter with poor or diminished skills (at least when compared with the opponent they are placed against) who may be considered an easy opponent to defeat, or a \"guaranteed win.\" Fights with \"tomato cans\" can be arranged to inflate the win total of a professional fighter. Similarly, a fighter whose record consists of wins over easy opponents is referred to as a \"can crusher\".\nThe phrase originates in the childhood pastime of kicking a can down the street—a boxer is advancing his career with minimal effort by defeating a \"tomato can\" and notching a win. \"Tomato\" refers to blood: \"knock a tomato can over, and red stuff spills out.\"\n\nA \"tomato can\" is usually a fighter with a poor record, whose skills are substandard or who lacks toughness or has a \"glass chin.\" Sometimes a formerly successful boxer who is past his prime and who has seen his skills diminish is considered a \"tomato can\" if he can no longer compete at a high level. Such an individual is an attractive opponent if his name still carries prestige but his diminished skills make him an easy conquest. When referring to a distinguished fighter, opponents with passable careers who simply aren't at the same level can also be considered \"tomato cans\". \nMost fighters who are considered \"tomato cans\" are heavyweights, because at lower weight classes one must maintain a certain level of fitness in order to make weight, whereas a heavyweight who once fought at a trim 205 pounds could conceivably gain 150 pounds and still fight in the same division.\n\nOne characteristic which may account for the use of the \"tomato can\" metaphor for a bad boxer is the tendency to leak \"tomato juice\" (i.e., blood) when battered.\n\n\"Tomato cans\" are similar to jobbers in professional wrestling in that they serve to enhance the stature of someone the promotion uses to draw a crowd.\n\nVictory over a \"tomato can\" is not a certainty. Journeyman boxers generally regarded as \"tomato cans\" have been known to provide surprising challenges to champions and in several instances, cause shocking upsets against supposedly superior opponents.\n\nOn March 24, 1975, Muhammad Ali faced Chuck Wepner, a lightly regarded but popular boxer from New Jersey. A former nightclub bouncer, Wepner was nicknamed \"The Bayonne Bleeder\" and was considered a washed-up contender with a mediocre record. Don King selected Wepner as a \"tomato can\" to provide an easy victory for Ali after his famous win over George Foreman. In a surprising turn of events, Wepner scored a disputed knockdown in the ninth round, and survived 19 seconds short of the distance, before losing by TKO in the 15th round. Wepner's bout with Ali provided the inspiration for Sylvester Stallone's movie \"Rocky\".\n\nIn a fight on February 11, 1990, Mike Tyson lost his championship to James \"Buster\" Douglas in Tokyo. The victory over Tyson, the previously undefeated \"baddest man on the planet\" and the most feared boxer in professional boxing at that time, at the hands of the 42–1 betting odds underdog Douglas, has been described as one of the most shocking upsets in modern sports history. Douglas was widely regarded as a \"tomato can\", lined up to provide an easy victory for Tyson at that time. Later, Douglas lost his first title defense against Evander Holyfield and was never able to successfully compete at such a high level again.\n\nThe biggest upset in mixed martial arts is considered by many, including UFC president Dana White and ESPN, to be Matt Serra's TKO victory over UFC Welterweight Champion Georges St. Pierre at UFC 69 on April 7, 2007, as an 11–1 underdog.\n\n"}

It was also a charity. The Federation organised the World Strongman Cup one of the main competitions in the field of strength athletics boasting participation from some of the foremost strongmen around the globe. It was a separate competition from the World's Strongest Man, the Strongman Super Series (producing a World Champion) and the IFSA World Championship). It has since been replaced by the World Strongman Federation's World Cup.\n\nUntil completion of the 2004 World's Strongest Man competition, the IFSA managed the annual World's Strongest Man contest. However, that year saw an acrimonious dividing of the sport with the IFSA forming its own competition and with the World's Strongest Man (\"WSM\") continuing to be organised by TWI, an IMG Media company. The WSM itself was never a federation, but an event organised commercially. When the IFSA formed their own competition and banned their contracted athletes from competing in the WSM, the World Strongman Cup Federation (\"WSCF\") filled a void and signed up many of the non-IFSA athletes. At the 2005 WSM finals, two thirds of the athletes were under contract with the WSCF. Since its inception the WSMCF has organised events in many countries including: United States of America, Canada, Germany, Austria, Russia, Serbia, Poland and Spain. Its flagship event was the World Strongman Cup.\n\nFollowing a financial dispute with the World Strongman Cup Federation Vlad Redkin, one of its chief organisers, left to found the World Strongman Federation. Following Vlad's departure, the WSCF ceased to promote events and effectively disappeared from the strength athletics landscape. In September 2007 an event in Khanty-Mansijsk formerly affiliated to WSMC and featuring its athletes was promoted by Vlad Redkin. This event had its name changed at short notice from WSMC to the Grand Prix of Khanty-Mansijsk (Russia) and in effect was the first WSF event. The reason given after the competition by Redkin was that a combination of financial reasons as well as concerns over WSMCF's stated aim of forming closer ties with the International Federation of Strength Athletes led him to part company with WSMCF. He initially planned to cooperate closely with the World Strongman Super Series in 2008, but in fact set up a new federation called the World Strongman Federation.\n\nThe World Strongman Cup has been run since 2004. It is organised as a tour event with many competitions held throughout the globe. The overall winner is ascertained through the cumulation of points scored across the season.\n\n\n\nOriginally, another event in Khanty-Mansijsk in September 2007 was affiliated to WSMC and featured its athletes. However, the promoter of the event, Vlad Redkin, changed the name from WSMC to the Grand Prix of Khanty-Mansijsk (Russia). The reason given was that after the competition Redkin was parting company with WSMC due to his concerns over WSMC wanting closer ties with the International Federation of Strength Athletes. He also cited that he had lost money with WSMC. He initially planned to cooperate closely with the World Strongman Super Series in 2008, but in fact set up a new federation called the World Strongman Federation.\n\nDate: 8 September 2007\n\nThe charity aims to reduce and tackle obesity in children by helping more children to take part in sporting activities. It is the charity's belief that \"As these children become more interested in and able to enjoy sports of their choosing, their physical and emotional conditions show significant improvement. This provides a strong foundation for improved self-confidence and happiness for all participants.\" The federation believes that their athletes can act as positive examples.\n\n"}
