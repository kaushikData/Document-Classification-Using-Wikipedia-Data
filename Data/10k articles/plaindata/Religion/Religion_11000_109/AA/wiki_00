Segal (August 2, 1945 – February 13, 2011) was a scholar of ancient religions, specializing in Judaism's relationship to Christianity. Segal was a distinguished scholar, author, and speaker, self-described as a \"believing Jew and twentieth-century humanist.\" Segal was one of the first modern scholars to write extensively on the influences of Judaism (including Second Temple Rabbinic texts, Merkabah mysticism, and Jewish apocalypticism) on Paul of Damascus.\n\nSegal was born in Worcester, Massachusetts. He attended Amherst College (B.A., 1967), Brandeis University (M.A., 1969), Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion (Bachelor of Hebrew Letters, 1971), and Yale University (M.A., 1971; M.Phil., 1973; and Ph.D., 1975). At the time of his retirement, Segal was Professor Emeritus of Religion and Ingeborg Rennert Professor Emeritus of Judaic Studies at Barnard College and held a concurrent appointment as Adjunct Professor of Scripture at Union Theological Seminary. He had also taught at Princeton University and the University of Toronto. \n\nSegal was an expert in the field of history and religious traditions of Judaism and Christianity of the Roman period, and on the Semitic languages in use in Israel in that period. His scholarly reputation commenced with his landmark book, \"Two Powers in Heaven: Early Rabbinic Reports About Christianity and Gnosticism\" (1977), in which he explored early references in rabbinic texts that he proposed were directed against beliefs of Jewish Christians and gnostics. His 1986 book, \"Rebecca's Children\", was a sensitive study showing that rabbinic Judaism and early Christianity were sibling developments from the parent biblical tradition. His award-winning book, \"Paul the Convert\" (1990) was Editor's Choice and main selection of the History Book Club's summer 1990 list, and a selection of the Book of the Month Club. The 368 page text is a collection of studies that interprets Paul within the context of Jewish mysticism and history, providing unique depth and insight for Biblical exegetes and Jewish historians. His last book, \"Life After Death: A History of the Afterlife in Western Religion\" (2004) was a massive study of beliefs spanning from ancient near-eastern civilizations to the present and across various religious traditions. Life After Death is \"considered one of the definitive treatments of that weighty subject — and was weighty in its own right, at 731 pages.\" It was a selection of the History Book Club, the Book of the Month Club, and the Behaviorial Science Book Club. It also featured on the Leonard Lopate Show, Talk of the Nation, and was the cover story of the Globe and Mail Book Review Supplement (Toronto). In addition, he wrote numbers articles and chapters in scholarly books.\n\nSegal gave conference presentations and lectures internationally. He was a founding member of the Society of Biblical Literature program unit on Early Jewish and Christian Mysticism, and the SBL program unit on Divine Mediators in Antiquity. In 1988, he was the first Jewish member of the Society for New Testament Studies to address the society. He was elected a member of the American Society for the Study of Religion and the first American living outside Canada to be elected President of the Canadian Society for Biblical Studies.\n\nUntil Segal's book \"Paul the Convert\" was published in 1990, most modern Biblical scholars failed to take into account the Jewishness of Paul and the vast majority of Jewish historians ignored Paul altogether because of his perceived anti-Semitic writing. Segal argues in \"Paul the Convert\" that despite Paul's polemical rhetoric, the Jewish community must nevertheless consider the historical value of Paul's epistles because of the insights he provides into first century Hellenisic Judaism. \n\nSegal's exegetical concern is with the Jewish context of Paul's religious struggle following his conversion. He reads Paul's epistles in light of the social sciences, borrowing from modern sociological and psychological studies (especially those pertaining to conversion). He also examines Paul through the lens of Jewish Merkabah mysticism and the Rabbinic tradition – a pioneering method of study of the New Testament. Segal argues that in order to understand Paul thoroughly, one must understand the circumstances of his time and culture. Segal draws similarities between things like Paul's description of his conversion on the road to Damascus (2 Cor. 12:1-9) and Ezekiel and Enoch's heavenly ascent. He argues that Paul's emphasis on the Glory of God (Kavod) in these stories is characteristic of the Merkabah mystic tradition. The type of exegesis that Segal engages in provides a rare insight into first century thinking.\n\nSegal understands Paul as part of Jewish history; he interprets Paul's conversion as an apostasy and a break from Judaism because of his insistence on transformation in Christ, although Paul never perceived his actions as outside the Jewish community (Acts 21:24). Paul, Segal argues, never felt that he had left Judaism, \"He began as a Pharisee and became a convert from Pharisaism. He spent the rest of his life trying to express what he converted to. He never gave it a single name.\" Paul's conversion experience, Segal argues, forced him to re-evaluate his faith and understanding of the Torah; he was made to reconcile his revelation with his Pharasaism.\n\nSegal was a frequent media commentator on St. Paul and other issues to deal with early Christianity and Judaism. Segal, who wrote on Christian and Jewish beliefs in an afterlife, explained to reporters that belief in an existence beyond death persists among Americans no matter how little they observe their religion.\n\nDuring September 2007, Segal became part of the controversial tenure battle concerning Barnard anthropology professor Nadia Abu El Haj. Segal, who was opposed to Abu El Haj's tenure bid, told \"The New York Times\" that \"there is every reason in the world to want her to have tenure, and only one reason against it — her work, I believe it is not good enough.\" Segal wrote a critique of Abu El Haj's book \"Facts on the Ground\" for the \"Columbia Daily Spectator\", in which he said that the reasons for which he opposed tenure for Abu El Haj were professional, not personal.\n\n"}
{"id": "435921", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=435921", "title": "Altar server", "text": "Altar server\n\nAn altar server is a lay assistant to a member of the clergy during a Christian liturgy. An altar server attends to supporting tasks at the altar such as fetching and carrying, ringing the altar bell, among other things. A young male altar server is commonly called an altar boy, whereas a young female altar server is commonly called an altar girl.\n\nThe role of altar server can perhaps be traced back to the third century: Pope Benedict XVI spoke of Saint Tarcisius as \"presumably an acolyte, that is, an altar server\". While the function is commonly associated with children, the function can be and is carried out by people of any age or dignity.\n\nThe practice, reaffirmed by Pope Benedict XIV in 1775, of excluding women from serving the priest at the celebration of Mass, has now been generally abandoned. In 1994, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments clarified that, in line with the 1983 revision of the Code of Canon Law, service at the altar is to be considered one of the liturgical functions (such as those of lector and cantor) that, according to canon 230 §2 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, lay people, male or female, may perform. At the same time the Congregation pointed out that this canon of the Code of Canon Law is only permissive and does not oblige to admit female altar servers. In 2006, the only United States diocese that excluded women from service at the altar was that of Lincoln, Nebraska. Even where the bishop does not limit the permission granted by general canon law, the priest in charge of a church is not obliged to avail of it. Traditionalist Catholic groups such as the FSSP and the Institute of Christ the King and some individual priests do not.\n\nThe term \"acolyte\" is sometimes applied to altar servers, but in a more precise sense it means an \"instituted acolyte\", someone who has received the instituted ministry of that name, usually reserved for those who are to be promoted to the permanent or transitory diaconate. These must receive the ministry of acolyte, which formerly was classified as a minor order, at least six months before being ordained as deacons. In the \"General Instruction of the Roman Missal\" the term \"acolyte\" is treated as distinct from the term \"server\".\n\nIf a priest celebrates Mass at which a congregation does not assist, he should not do so without a server except out of serious necessity.\n\nIn the absence of instituted acolytes, some of their functions at Mass may be carried out by altar servers.\n\n\nThe vestment common to all ordained and instituted ministers of whatever rank is an alb, which is to be tied at the waist with a cincture unless the alb is made to fit without cincture. Acolytes, readers and other lay ministers (such as altar servers) may wear either an alb or other appropriate attire as determined by the local episcopal conference. All who wear an alb should use a cincture and an amice, unless the form of the alb makes these unnecessary.\n\nServers often wear cassock and surplice, with black and red being the most common colors for a server's cassock.\n\nIn the Byzantine Rite, altar servers assist the higher clergy during services. They might carry the cross, candles or liturgical fans in processions and entrances; maintain the censer, ensuring it has enough live charcoal, loading it with incense and handing it to the priest or deacon when required; preparing the hot water (\"zeon\") in time for it to be added to the chalice at the Divine Liturgy; prepare the antidoron for the people to receive after Holy Communion; and any other necessary tasks so that the priest need not be distracted during the service. An altar server is vested in the sticharion only.\n\nIn the early Church, before someone could be a server he had to be tonsured. Nowadays, in many places it is not necessary to be tonsured before one is allowed to serve (since the tonsure must be done by a bishop or higher-ranking priest). The rites of \"Setting Aside a Taper-bearer\" and \"Tonsuring a Reader\" have now been combined into one service. It is the custom in some traditions, such as the Greek Orthodox or Melkite Catholic, to allow tonsured altar servers to also vest in the orarion, worn crossed over the back like that of a subdeacon but with the ends hanging parallel in front. Among the Russians, however, the orarion is not usually worn by servers, but only by duly ordained subdeacons and deacons, with the exception that laymen who are blessed to perform some of the functions of subdeacons may sometimes be blessed to wear the orar.\n\nBefore vesting, the server must fold his sticharion and bring it to the priest for him to bless. The priest blesses and lays his hand on the folded sticharion. The server kisses the priest's hand and the Cross on the vestment, and then withdraws to vest. Any server who has not been tonsured must remove the sticharion when he receives Holy Communion, because communicants receive the Mysteries according to their order within the Church (so tonsured clergy vest while laymen remove their vestments). Before divesting at the end of the service, the server must receive the priest's blessing.\n\nThe minimum age varies by local circumstance, but boys must be mature enough to carry out their duties without disrupting the sanctity of the altar. Although it is common in North America for boys to act as altar servers, in some places this practice is virtually unknown and these duties are always carried out by adult men. In other places where altar servers are normally boys, adult men will not vest if called upon to serve. In yet other places, boys are not permitted to serve in the Altar on reaching their teens on the grounds that the young man is no longer innocent enough to serve in the altar. \n\nAltar servers, regardless of age, are subject to all the normal restrictions for those not of higher clerical position. Anyone who is bleeding, or has an open sore, is not permitted to enter the altar. They may not touch the altar table or anything on it under any circumstances, nor the prothesis without a blessing. They may not touch the sacred vessels, the chalice and diskos (paten) at any time. They may not stand directly in front of the altar table or pass between the front of it and the iconostasis, but must cross between the altar and the High Place if they need to move to the opposite side.\n\nIn general, women do not serve in the altar except in women's monasteries. In that case they do not receive the clerical tonsure (though they must be tonsured nuns), and do not vest in the sticharion, but wear their normal religious habit for attending services, and serve at a certain distance from the actual altar table. Normally, only older nuns may serve in the altar; but the Hegumenia (Abbess) is permitted to enter even if she is younger. A few parishes have begun to use women as altar servers.\n\nIn many Anglican churches, and Lutheran churches, all who serve in the above positions are called acolytes.\n\nIn Anglo-Catholic and some Episcopal Churches however, the vast majority of roles associated with an altar server are the same as those in the Catholic Church, and the same titles for each individual role are retained from Catholic tradition – mostly restored during the Oxford Movement in the 19th century.\n\n"}

Its literature gives a principle of universal and compulsory education, which is identified as one of key principles alongside monotheism and the unity of humanity.\n\nBahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith wrote:\n\nThe Bahá'í teachings focus on promoting a moral and spiritual education, in addition to the arts, trades, sciences and professions. The emphasis on education is a means for social and national improvement. Since all Bahá'ís have the duty to do work that is useful to humanity, Bahá'í education is meant to prepare Bahá'ís to perform such work.\n\nOne purpose of universal compulsory education is implied in the Bahá'í Short Obligatory Prayer which states that the God's primary reason for creating humanity is so that each of us would come to know and love Him. Clearly one purpose of education would be to facilitate this process. But religious education, however critical, should not lead to division and conflict. Bahá'u'lláh writes:\n\nThis principle is most commonly applied by Bahá'ís in the form of social-welfare projects and children's classes. The emphasis on education as a means for social and national improvement is shown in the following quote by `Abdu'l-Bahá, the son and appointed successor of Bahá'u'lláh:\n\nThe type of education that is written about in the Bahá'í writings does not point to one particular type or method of education.\n\nThe Bahá'í teachings focus on promoting a moral and spiritual education, in addition to the arts, trades, sciences and professions.\n\nChildren, and the requirement to give them a proper education, is particularly emphasized in many of the Bahá'í writings. Children's classes have become common-place in most Bahá'í communities, and were named by the Universal House of Justice in 2001 as one of the four core activities that Bahá'ís should focus on.\n\nBahá'í individuals have created the noted book \"The Family Virtues Guide\", which is dedicated to the spiritual education of children. Its multi-religious content has brought it enough popularity to sell over 100,000 copies and to win the authors an interview on The Oprah Winfrey Show. \n\nAll Bahá'ís have the duty to do work that is useful to humanity. A major goal of Bahá'í education is therefore to prepare Bahá'ís to perform such work.\n\nThis is by no means the only goal (as the categories above and below indicate), or even necessarily the overriding one, but Bahá'ís are warned against courses of study which \"begin and end in words\":\n\nThe seventh \"Ishráq\" of Bahá'u'lláh's \"Ishráqat\" stipulates as follows:\n\nWhile there do exist a number of preliterate or non-literate cultures, Bahá'ís assume the spread of literacy to be one of the signs of an \"ever-advancing civilization.\" For example, a priesthood is not needed in this era because the ability to read and write is no longer restricted to a professional class, with the masses reduced to auditors of their sacred texts.\n\nBahá'ís expect the world's governments to one day cooperate in selecting an international auxiliary language to be used in global communication. After this is done, that language, along with one's mother tongue will be taught in schools all over the world.\n\nAlthough Bahá'u'lláh rued the necessity of spending many years learning multiple languages, when only one could be selected, various authoritative writings do assume foreign languages to be included among the \"useful subjects\" which Bahá'ís will probably study.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith has not yet endeavored to describe an ideal school curriculum, though its writings assume the usefulness of a wide variety of subjects.\n\nBahá'í writings variously allude to mathematics, science, technology, commerce, industry, the liberal arts, and religion as suitable subjects for inclusion in an educational curriculum.\n\nIn education theory, in addition to what is taught, it is also important to note how education is taught. In addition to the traditional mode of education, other forms of education exist such as alternative schools, unschooling, homeschooling, Montessori, and Waldorf education. The Bahá'í requirements for education do not necessarily reject any of these possibilities.\n\nThe father is attributed with the responsibility for every child's education and should he fail to execute his responsibility to educate his children he can be compelled and even lose his rights as father. Mothers are acknowledged as the \"first educators\" of humanity, and their responsibility is equally confirmed. Beyond this, responsibility also falls to the community as a whole, as embodied in its Bahá'í institutions:\n\nIn the unfortunate event that parents and/or their communities cannot educate all their children, Bahá'í law stipulates that girls are to be given priority over boys.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá wrote about school uniforms, cleanliness and courtesy:\n\nAmong the four core activities that Bahá'ís are currently urged to focus on, supporting children's classes and engaging in a sequence of courses known as study circles has become part of the community life of Bahá'ís around the world.\n\nThe most common sequence is called Ruhi (meaning: of the spirit), which was originally developed in Colombia and currently consists of 7 courses, with the themes from the Bahá'í writings of prayer, education, history, and more.\n\nThe following sequence of courses is:\n\n\nBook 8 and 9 are in development and are slated for release into the community gradually, the topics to be covered are the Covenant and the Family, respectively.\n\nThe United States has developed a set of curriculum for children's classes known as the core curriculum. \n\nAnother sequence of courses uses for education of the Bahá'í teachings is called Fundamental Verities. This sequence was developed in the United States, and is not as common as the more widely used Ruhi sequence.\n\nThe Bahá'í House of Worship is an institution alluded to in the writings of the Bahá'í Faith. In its entirety, it represents a temple for worship, hospital, university, hospice, and other humanitarian and educational structures. It will serve as the city center for future Bahá'í societies.\n\nSome of the more mature and able Bahá'í communities around the world have taken on the task of Social and Economic Development (SED) projects. These can vary from place to place depending on the needs of different areas. Some examples include programs for the free education of migrant workers, the employment of the homeless, or the support of displaced refugees. Individuals have also worked to reform educational practices in society, such as Dr. Dwight W. Allen, a Bahá'í, who co-authored \"American Schools: The 100 Billion Dollar Challenge\" with William H. Cosby, Jr in 2000; and the work of Dr. Daniel Jordan in the ANISA Educational Model. The Bahá'ís of the world have set up more than 300 academic \"Bahá'í schools\" around the world.\n\nThe Bahá'í writings give a high praise for teachers, and, in the case that no personal will has been written, provide that some of a person's inheritance goes to their teachers.\n\n\n"}

Although sources are not readily available, Buddhists are believed to constitute 0.1% of the total population in Ukraine.\n\nDespite the fact that on a superficial level Buddhism was known in Ukraine long ago due to the regular contacts of the Ukrainian Cossacks with the Kalmyks, who profess Buddhism, the interest in Buddhism in its philosophical and ethical aspects among the Ukrainian cultural and scientific intelligentsia arose not earlier than in the 19th century. Closer acquaintance with Buddhism was interrupted in the Soviet period, when any interest in religious teachings different from Soviet ideology was persecuted. As a result, such interest could not be fully satisfied and, moreover, grow into certain organizations. Therefore, the first open systematic lectures on Buddhism, sermons and lessons on Buddhist studies, date back to 1989, when the political and ideological pressure of the Soviet system was considerably eased. At that time the first Buddhist teachings took place in Ukraine, and the first secular followers of Buddhism appeared, they took Buddhist refuge in the Three Jewels: Buddha, the Teaching (Dharma) and the Community (Sangha).\n\nUkraine’s first officially registered Buddhist community was set up in the village of Ol'hynka, Volnovakha Raion, Donetsk Oblast in 1991, and in 1993 Buddhist Center Lunh-zhonh-pa (which means “The Wardens of the Commandments” in the Tibetan language) was built there. This school conducts both lay and monastic activities.\n\nToday Ukraine has nearly 100 Buddhist communities and groups, 38 of them are officially registered and enjoy the status of legal entity. The largest communities and groups belong to the Tibetan tradition in Buddhism, that is, the tantric tradition of Vajrayana (“Diamond Vehicle”). The most widespread among them are Karma Kagyu communities, the main branch of the Tibetan Kagyu-pa School. They are united into the All-Ukraine Religious Center Ukrainian Association of Karma Kagyu Buddhists. In Ukraine, the religious studies of this center are intended for laypeople. Communities and groups of followers of this tradition are present in almost all regional centers of Ukraine.”\n\nThere is a Drikung Kagyu center which was officially registered in Kyiv on 2006 in order to fulfill a joint aspiration of H.E. Garchen Rinpoche and his students. The Center is a part of global community of the Garchen Rinpoche’s Centers. During the last ten years, Garchen Rinpoche visited Kyiv four times. Many Drikung Kagyu masters and teachers has visited the Center in the past years. Among them H.E. Garchen Rinpoche, Khenchen Rinpoche, Nubpa Rinpoche, Drupon Tsering Rinpoche, Drupon Yeshe Rinpoche, Drupon Tsering Rinpoche, Lama Dawa Zang, Drupon Yeshe Zangmo, Khenpo Samdrup.\n\nNyingma school also has followers in Ukraine, in particular Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche and current Patrul Rinpochе visited Kiev. Under the guidance of Gyetrul Jigme Rinpoche \"Ripa\" center was founded.\n\nInternational Dzogchen Community also have number of its followers and communities in Ukraine. It developed as a separate Buddhist School in the West in the late 20th century through the efforts of Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, the Tibetan Lama in emigration. Like Karma Kagyu, this school is oriented to lay Buddhists in Ukraine.\n\nThere is also four Shambala centers, an international organization founded by Chögyam Trungpa\n\nIn Kiev there is Rangjung Yeshe center with followers all over Ukraine, this center conducts regular practices of Chokling Tersar Lineage. Lama Sonam Dorje visited Ukraine many times and give many teachings and practices instructions, and in 2012 Chokyi Nyima Rinpoche visited Kiev with public talk and empowerment\n\nSeveral times Dr. Alexander Berzin visited Ukraine to give general Buddhist teachings and their application in modern society.\n\nBesides Tibetan Buddhism schools there are also Zen practitioners, and Vipassana meditation followers As taught by S.N.

It is located north of Râs ach-Chaq’a’ and Herri beaches, or Theoprosopon of classical times and south of the ancient Phoenician port of Enfeh and the city of Tripoli. The origin of the word is believed to be Canaanite from the word Chikitta. Chikitta was mentioned Amarna letters in Egypt as a coastal town situated in the geographical area of modern Chekka. Until now there are no Canaanite archeological findings in Chekka backing this hypothesis. Chekka's modern history is clear. The high land in Chekka now known as Chekka Al-Atika was resettled around 300 years ago and the fertile valley of Chekka was cultivated in the intention of making Chekka a Maronite stronghold on the Lebanese coast. Many families moved from Mount Lebanon to Chekka at that time.\n\nChekka is rich in freshwater submarine springs. The American University of Beirut's Faculty of Engineering investigated the potential of sustainable exploitation of the Chekka Bay submarine springs in 2000.\n\nChekka is known for \"Râs ach-Chaq’a’\", a white and green mountain touching the Mediterranean sea and its public and private sand beaches.\n\nChekka is home to some of the largest cement and paper factories in the eastern Mediterranean. Companies such as Holcim Liban, Cimenterie Nationale S.A.L and Société Libanaise des Ciments Blancs S.A.L.B, headquartered in Chekka. The ancient process of extracting salt from the sea is still practiced in Chekka but without traditional wind powered water pumps.\n\nChekka is also an agricultural city, main productions including figs among the others. It is the headquarters of the second largest Lebanese poultry producer with a slaughterhouse, farms, hatcheries and feed mill plant located in it. Chekka is also home to large public and private sand beaches.\n\nThe Las Salinas and Florida Beach resorts provide a wide range of nautical and inland activities for which Chekka is best known. Chekka has a range of other hotels and resorts, with more than a 270 chalets, 100 cabins and a marina capable of receiving more than 70 boats.\n\nChekka is considered as the center for education for the neighboring regions. Public and private schools in Chekka include Sainte Famille Maronite and Les moines Libanais private maronite schools. Universite Saint-Esprie de Kaslik has a branch in Chekka for law and business majors and is currently considering expanding to other fields.\n\nToday Chekka has a Christian majority mostly Maronite and Greek Orthodox with few Sunni Muslims. It has many Maronite Christian, Greek Orthodox and Greek Catholic churches.\n\nAround 17,000 people are currently residing in Chekka many of which come originally from villages such as Tannourin, Zgharta and Bcharre. Chekka has a rich diaspora in USA, Australia, Canada, France and the Gulf.\n\nThere are several sports teams that represent Chekka. The Chekka soccer club have won the north district soccer championship in 2005-06, and have finished on the podium ever since. There are several other sports clubs in the region such as the Chekka ‘Saint famille’ Basketball club.

The spiritual differences can be framed within the Old Testament story of Elijah and the prophet of Baal, where the former confronted and repudiated the practices of those who worshiped idols and practiced vodou.\n\nThe revolutionary Jean-Jacques Dessalines presumptively proclaimed himself head of the church in Haiti after the Haitian Revolution. He set forward to limit the jurisdiction of priests and to appoint men to vacant positions in local church communities. He himself had caused the assassination of a large number of the missionaries by failing to stop slaughter of the white colonists. This caused a schism between the Haitian state and Rome, resulting in Rome's declining to send priests into the country. There were no priests to provide guidelines for the newly established Haitian state. As a consequence, the principles of Vodou and Catholicism were merged and Catholicism (with its Vodou influences) was made the state's official religion under the leadership of Henri Christophe.\n\nAnother cause of the syncretic connection between Catholicism and Vodou was the state's ordination of Haitian men to the priesthood – a step that the Vatican would not recognize as legitimate. However, mixture of both religions shaped the way of how Haitians practice their ritual. The Haitians were going to church, but they continued to adhere to Vodou, using the rituals of the church to mask the practices of their native traditions.\n\nThere have been several killings in the past of Christian pastors, and some Christians blame those murders on the influence of Vodou. There have also been several murders of Vodou Priests/Priestesses, most recently after the earthquake. In Haiti, some Christians consider Vodou a form of devil worship. In spite of this criticism by some Haitian Christians, many practitioners of Haitian Vodou continue to self-identify as Roman Catholic, even to the point of incorporating the Lord's Prayer and the Hail Mary into their services for the Lwa (also called \"loa\"). These people see no contradiction between the two faiths and, in fact, view it as enriching their own faith, such people refer to themselves as good Christians.\n\nHaiti has large percentages of Vodou believers. Many Christians accept Vodou as part of the country's culture, though most Evangelical Christians consider Vodou incompatible with Christianity.\n\nVodou is taken seriously, and is not considered \"black magic\" by its adherants (or at least not primarily, see bokor). Many observances are shared between the religions; for instance it is not abnormal for Vodou funerary ceremonies to be performed, followed by a Roman Catholic ceremony presided by a priest. Many Haitians celebrate Christian holidays alongside traditional Vodou holidays.\n\nOne of the essential differences between Christianity and vodou involved the use of violence. Priests practicing voduo is believed capable of summoning spirits (\"loas\") in order to inflict pain, curses, sickness, and death. To counter the destruction wrought by the \"loa\", one needs elaborate and costly rituals to avoid hardship and destruction. People, thus, live in constant fear, which goes against the Christian teaching based on hope and harmonious relationship with others.\n\nThe Church has put pressure upon the government to outlaw and disband Voduo. This is the reason its practice remain illegal since the French colonial regime. In 1896, 1913, and again in 1941 the church led its anti-superstitious campaigns to fight against Voodooism. During the campaigns, hundreds of Ounfos and ritual paraphernalia were destroyed and burned. In spite of the policy in place, the Haitian government pursued different positions throughout the years. For example, during the administration of Stenio Vincent, voduo practitioners were vigorously persecuted while Francois Duvalier merely ignored the issue. \n\nIn addition to the more common French and British the missionaries, Canadian missionaries began to move into Haiti in 1942. A Jesuit seminary was also opened in 1948. Up to this time, the church remains a major political power; this can cause major problems in country and has greatly limited its pastoral work. In the past decade the Catholic Church has taken a much more liberal stand towards Vodou, even including some minor Vodou elements in the Haitian mass.\n\n"}

In the latter type, there is often a crypt on the lower level and a celebratory space on the upper floor.\n\nThis special form of church building that was used in medieval European architecture up to the 13th century had two churches built on two levels, one above the other, usually with the same floor plan, but there are exceptions such as the Imperial Chapel of St. Ulrich in Goslar.\nThe earlier arrangement of the two chapel floors, which was purported to enable a \"separation between the lower and upper classes of the Middle Ages\", in which the lower chapel was assigned to the \"common people\" and the upper chapel to the \"feudal lords\" and their families is not substantiated by any evidence. Instead, it is more likely that the distinction was either between a public lower chapel, where the ruler celebrated mass with guests before official events or during state visits, and a private upper chapel, where the lord’s family worshipped; or between an upper chapel which was reserved for estate services and a lower chapel used as a crypt and also for requiem masses. In these Romanesque chapels the upper and lower levels were usually connected by a secondary aperture in the floor of the upper chapel.\nThe double chapel had numerous architectural successors, notably the charnel house, a combination of cemetery chapel and ossuary, but also in numerous two-storey cemetery chapels in southern Germany, Austria and Bohemia. Where they function purely as cemetery chapels, double chapels are usually dedicated to Saint Michael. The lower chapel was given the character of an ossuary, as a Late Gothic relic chapel and memorial for the fallen after the failure of the feudal crusades (e.g. Kiedrich or Görlitz).\n\nGermany:\n\nDouble chapels were mainly built in Hohenstaufen imperial palaces and castles, but also in monasteries.

Centers and churches in the United States, Canada, Central America, South America, Africa, Europe, India, Australia, and the Philippines are represented by the organization. It is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nDr. Robert Karle founded the Center for Creative Living and seminary in the Washington, D.C. area in 1977. In 1986 he started Global Religious Science Ministries for the purpose of credentialing Practitioners and Ministers of Religious Science/Science of Mind in the eastern United States, and specifically in the Washington, D.C. area. GRSM is a member of the International New Thought Alliance.\n\nRS/SOM teaches that all beings are expressions of and part of Infinite Intelligence, also known as Spirit, Christ Consciousness, or God. It teaches that, because God is all there is in the universe (not just present in Heaven, or in assigned deities, as believed by traditional teachings), Its power can be used by all humans to the extent that they recognize and align themselves with Its presence. Ernest Holmes said \"God is not ... a person, but a Universal Presence ... already in our own soul, already operating through our own consciousness.”\n\nThe Introduction to \"The Science of Mind\" text describes \"The Thing Itself\" (God or Infinite Intelligence), \"The Way It Works,\" \"What It Does,\" and \"How to Use It.\" Holmes taught that \"Love rules through Law.\" (i.e. the Law of Mind or Cause and Effect) and \"Love points the way and Law makes the way possible.\" The \"Law of Cause and Effect\" simply states that every action has a consequence — creative, destructive, or neutral. It can be described as Jesus Christ implied and what was also stated in parts of the Old Testament: you reap what you sow, the bread you cast upon the water comes back to you, and other expressions of that concept. The Law of Attraction is one aspect of that Law. It differs from the Hindu definition of karma in that it is not related to reincarnation and that it happens in this life. Personal responsibility is a major tenet of RS/SOM.\n\nRS/SOM teaches that people can achieve more fulfilling lives through the practice called Spiritual Mind Treatment (Treatment), or Affirmative Prayer. Spiritual Mind Treatment is a step-by-step process, in which one states the desired outcome as if it has already happened. In that way, it differs from traditional prayer, since it does not ask an entity separate from itself to act. It declares human partnership with Infinite Intelligence to achieve success. Treatment is to be stated as personal (first person), positive, powerful (with feeling), and present (is happening right now). The goal is to gain clarity in thinking that guides action to be consistent with the desired outcome. The Treatment is believed to set off a new chain of causation in Mind that leads one to act according to the good for which one is treating. Spiritual Mind Treatment, as currently taught in RS/SOM centers, contains five steps: Recognition, Unification, Realization, Thanksgiving, and Release. Some adherents of RS/SOM also use supplemental meditation techniques, including \"Visioning\"\n\nThe Seminary is the educational component of GRSM. It offers classroom training and\ninformal study groups. The Seminary includes all accredited full-time and part-time programs offered by its members.

The commitment may be seen as temporary and secular, or of a longer, spiritual variety, depending on the context. \n\n\"Handfasting\" is a history term for \"betrothal\" or \"wedding\". In the Early Modern history of Scotland (16th and 17th centuries), especially in the Hebrides, the term could also refer to a temporary marriage.\n\nThe verb \"to handfast\" in the sense of \"to formally promise, to make a contract\" is recorded for Late Old English, especially in the context of a contract of marriage. The derived \"handfasting\" is for a ceremony of engagement or betrothal is recorded in Early Modern English. The term was presumably loaned into English from Old Norse \" handfesta\" \"to strike a bargain by joining hands\"; there are also comparanda from the Ingvaeonic languages: Old Frisian \"hondfestinge\" and Middle Low German \"hantvestinge\". The term is derived from the verb \"to handfast\", used in Middle to Early Modern English for the making of a contract.\n\nThe term \"handfasting\" or \"hand-fasting\" has been in use in Celtic neopaganism and Wicca for wedding ceremonies from at least the late 1960s, apparently first used in print by Hans Holzer.\n\nHandfasting was mentioned in the 1980 Jim Morrison biography \"No One Here Gets Out Alive\" and again in the 1991 film \"The Doors\", where a version of the real 1970 handfasting ceremony of Morrison and Patricia Kennealy-Morrison was depicted (with the real Patricia Kennealy-Morrison playing the Celtic Pagan priestess).\n\nThe term has entered the English-speaking mainstream, most likely from neopagan wedding ceremonies during the early 2000s, often erroneously being described as \"pre-Christian\" by wedding planners. Evidence that the term \"handfasting\" had been re-interpreted as describing this ceremony specifically is found in the later 2000s, e.g. \n\"handfasting—the blessed marriage rite in which the hands of you and your beloved are wrapped in ribbon as you 'tie the knot.'\"\nBy the 2010s, \"handfasting ceremonies\" were on offer by commercial wedding organizers and had mostly lost their neopagan association (apart from occasional claims that attributes the ceremony to the \"ancient Celts\").\nThe term \"handfasting ribbon\" appears from about 2005.\n\n"}

While the caliph cannot change the religious laws and their jurisprudence, an imam also can not change the original religious laws but can derive verdicts based on Quran, Tafseer, Ahadith and Prophet's Sunnah as per new requirements or new problems faced.\n\nThe term \"caliphate\", a romanization of the Arabic word \"khalifah\" \"succession\", is often used interchangeably with the term \"imamate\".

Prior to this, he had served as Chief Rabbi of Ireland and as rabbi of the Fifth Avenue Synagogue in New York City. In addition to his official duties he was regarded as an authority in medical ethics from a Jewish standpoint. He was knighted in 1981 and became the first Chief Rabbi to enter the House of Lords in 1988 as Baron Jakobovits.\n\nJakobovits was born in Königsberg, East Prussia, Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia), where his father Julius (Yoel) was a community rabbi. The family moved to Berlin in the 1920s, where his father became rabbinical judge on the \"beth din\" of the Grossgemeinde, but fled the country in 1938 in time to escape Nazi persecutions. In the United Kingdom he completed his higher education, including a period at the Etz Chaim Yeshiva in London, studying under and receiving semicha (rabbi ordination) from the renowned Rabbis Elya Lopian, Leib Gurwicz and Nachman Shlomo Greenspan. He also studied in Jews' College and the University of London (BA and PhD, University College).\n\nHe married Amélie Munk of Paris, the daughter of a prominent rabbi, who would support his community work throughout his life. They had six children. Lady Jakobovits died in May 2010, and was buried alongside her husband, on Jerusalem's Mount of Olives.\n\nHis first position was as rabbi of the Brondesbury synagogue. In 1949, at the relatively young age of 27, he was appointed Chief Rabbi of the declining Jewish community of Ireland. This was to be a stepping stone towards a greater rabbinical career, and in 1958 he assumed the rabbinate of Hermann Merkin's Fifth Avenue Synagogue in New York, a position he held until 1966, when he was called to the Chief Rabbinate of the United Hebrew Congregation of the British Commonwealth. He held this position until his retirement in 1991.\n\nHe was knighted on 22 July 1981 and was created a life peer on 5 February 1988, as Baron Jakobovits, of Regent's Park in Greater London, becoming the first rabbi to receive this honour. In 1987 he was given a Lambeth DD by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the first Jew to receive such a degree. In 1991 he received the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion.\n\nIn the House of Lords he became known as a campaigner for traditional morality. Lord Jakobovits aroused considerable controversy when, after the discovery of a possible genetic explanation for homosexuality, he suggested that he saw no \"moral objection for using genetic engineering to limit this particular trend\". While he did not advocate abortion, he did describe homosexuality as \"a grave departure from the natural norm which we are charged to overcome like any other affliction\"; if there were genetic explanations for homosexuality, \"the errant gene\" should be \"removed or repaired\" to prevent the \"disability\".\n\nLord Jakobovits died of a cerebral haemorrhage on 31 October 1999, and was buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem.\n\nRabbi Jakobovits was also the president of the Conference of European Rabbis, in which capacity he worked on standardising and regulating religious conversion to Judaism.\n\nJakobovits was a firm adherent of the \"German-Jewish\" \"Torah im Derech Eretz\" philosophy, having a broad knowledge of religious subjects as well as secular culture and philosophy. This made him a unique spokesperson for Orthodox Judaism, as he was able to transmit ideas to a wide audience which would otherwise not have achieved dissemination.\n\nRabbi Jakobovits was the most prominent figure in 20th century Jewish medical ethics, a field he virtually created on his own. He was also a pioneer in religious bioethics. His speciality was the interaction between medical ethics and \"halakha\". Thanks to his academic training in Ireland, Rabbi Jakobovits approached his comprehensive volume, \"Jewish Medical Ethics\", in light of Roman Catholic medical ethics, with which he often compares Jewish ethics. Whether developing or disputing his analysis, subsequent Jewish bioethicists have utilised his work on abortion, euthanasia, the history of Jewish medical ethics, palliative care, treatment of the sick, and professional duties. Likewise, he is credited with popularizing the viewpoint that Judaism supports the nearly absolute sanctity of life.\n\nHis political stance was conservative, and he was particularly close to Margaret Thatcher. When a Church of England report titled \"Faith in the City\" was published in December 1985 criticising Mrs. Thatcher's policies, Jakobovits responded by attacking its underlying philosophy. Jakobovits argued that work rather than welfare should be the over-riding aim of government policy: \"Cheap labour is better than a free dole\". More controversially, Jakobovits contended that inner-city black people should learn from Jewish experiences in America. There, he argued, Jews had worked themselves out of poverty, educated themselves, integrated into the host culture and nurtured a \"trust in and respect for the police, realising that our security as a minority depended on law and order being maintained\". Jakobovits also took a conservative view on trade unions, criticised \"Faith in the City\" for not mentioning the role of trade unions, arguing that \"The selfishness of workers in attempting to secure better conditions at the cost of rising unemployment and immense public misery can be just as morally indefensible as the rapaciousness of the wealthy in exploiting the working class\".\n\nWithin Judaism, he held mildly Zionistic views. He maintained that sooner or later Israel would need to negotiate the territory it conquered during the Six-Day War; which made him a controversial figure, as he mentioned these views publicly.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Because of his diplomatic skills were chosen cardinalis in 1421 as a member of a delegation that offered the Bohemian throne to the Polish king Władysław II Jagiełło. At the end of the year he was with John of Seelau, Jakobellus of Mies and Peter Payn to the administrators of the chalice teaching. Later they banished him from Prague. Already in 1425 he represented Prague in negotiations with the Taborites. The last written reference to him is dated 1428, when he held the office of Archbishop administrator.\n\n"}

Members of the tribe prefer the name \"Malaa\".\n\nMalaa people use a distinct form of dialect un-intelligible to most of the other subgroups of Adi. There has been several theories regarding its unique dialect, however most of the Malaa people maintains that they adopted this dialect from a certain group of people called Soi-sotem who inhabited their lands long before Malaa people came and settled there and the latter migrated to other places.

The priests, called \"Madar\" in Malaa, are popularly believed to be the intermediaries between the natural human world and Spiritual and supernatural world. Male priests are connected with act of divination while the female priests are related with healing of sickness. The priesthood is hereditary practice as it passed from generation to generation in a family. The ritual of sacrificing an animal as suggested by priest to cure a disease is called \"Lulu\".

He belonged to a family of rabbis in Ostrowo, where his father, Isaac Cohen, a great-great-grandson of the Judah Loew ben Bezalel, had fled during the Polish–Cossack–Tatar War.\n\nIn 1663 Cohen fell into the hands of the Tatars, who kept him in servitude for several years. Escaping, he returned to Ostrowo, and was chosen to succeed his father as rabbi. In 1690 he was called to Posen, where he officiated as chief rabbi until 1704. There he devoted himself to the Kabbalah, and collected a large library of cabalistic literature.\n\nIn 1704 he was called to Frankfurt am Main. On the occasion of a fire which, breaking out in his house on Jan. 14, 1711, spread to and consumed the entire Jewish quarter, it was charged that, relying on the efficacy of his cabalistic charms, he had prevented the extinction of the fire by the ordinary means. He was arrested and thrown into prison, and regained his liberty only upon renouncing his office.\n\nHe then went to Prague, where many members of his family lived. There another misfortune, which embittered his life more than the loss of his wealth and position, befell him. The Shabbethaian cabalist Nehemiah Hayyun appeared in Prague, declaring himself a preacher or an emissary from Palestine, and by his duplicity gained the confidence of the credulous Cohen. Being a believer in practical Cabala, Cohen found no fault with Ḥayyun, even when the latter began to sell amulets. It is not astonishing, therefore, that when Ḥayyun asked for an approbation for his mystical work \"Mehemnuta de Kula,\" Cohen, to whom he had prudently submitted only the main text, but not the commentaries which accompanied it, and in which the author openly professed the doctrine of the Trinity, readily granted it, and gave him a glowing recommendation. Provided with this and with other recommendations secured in the same way, Ḥayyun traveled throughout Moravia and Silesia, propagating everywhere his Shabbethaian teachings.\n\nCohen soon discovered his mistake, and endeavored, but without success, to recover his approbation, although he did not as yet realize the full import of the book. It was in 1713, while Cohen was staying at Breslau (where he acted as a rabbi until 1716), that Ḥakam Ẓebi Ashkenazi of Amsterdam informed him of its tenets. Cohen thereupon acted rigorously. He launched a ban against the author and his book, and became one of the most zealous supporters of Ḥakam Ẓebi in his campaign against Ḥayyun.\n\nIn 1715 Cohen went to see August II, King of Poland, to secure reinstatement in his former rabbinate of Posen, at that time vacant; but failed because of the opposition of the leaders of the community. He then returned to the Ukraine, and in 1718 started for the Holy Land, but died on the way at Constantinople on Dec. 20, 1718.\n\nCohen was the author of the following works:\n\nCohen also edited a number of prayer-books, including \"Seliḥot\" (Penitential Prayers), with a commentary, Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1702; prayers for the Society for Burial, ib., n.d.; a prayer for the staying of the plague, Prague, 1713; and an ode on a Sefer Torah donated by Baruch Austerlitz. He also wrote an epistle directed against Nehemiah Ḥayyun. Cohen's ethical will, \"Ẓawwa'ah,\" is replete with lofty moral instructions (Berlin, 1729).\n\n"}

There are also small Protestant and Sunni Muslim communities.\n\nAccording to a 2005 World Bank report, 98 percent of the population is Catholic, 1 percent Protestant, and less than 1 percent Muslim. Most citizens also retain some vestiges of animistic beliefs and practices, which they have come to regard as more cultural than religious.\n\nThe number of churches has grown from 100 in 1974 to over 800 in 1994, with Church membership having grown considerably under Indonesian rule as \"Pancasila\", Indonesia's state ideology, requires all citizens to believe in one God. East Timorese animist belief systems did not fit with Indonesia's constitutional monotheism, resulting in mass conversions to Christianity. Portuguese clergy were replaced with Indonesian priests and Latin and Portuguese mass was replaced by Indonesian mass. Before the invasion, only 20 percent of East Timorese were Roman Catholics, and by the 1980s, 95 percent were registered as Catholics. With over 90 percent Catholic population, East Timor is currently one of the most densely Catholic countries in the world.\n\nThe number of Protestants and Muslims declined significantly after September 1999 because these groups were disproportionately represented among supporters of integration with Indonesia and among the Indonesian civil servants assigned to work in the province from other parts of Indonesia, many of whom left the country in 1999. The Indonesian military forces formerly stationed in the country included a significant number of Protestants, who played a major role in establishing Protestant churches in the territory. Fewer than half of those congregations existed after September 1999, and many Protestants were among those who remained in West Timor. The Assemblies of God is the largest and most active of the Protestant denominations.\n\nThe country had a significant Muslim population during the Indonesian occupation, composed mostly of ethnic Malay immigrants from Indonesian islands. There were also a few ethnic East Timorese converts to Islam, as well as a small number descended from Arab Muslims living in the country while it was under Portuguese authority. The latter group was well integrated into society, but ethnic Malay Muslims at times were not. Only a small number of ethnic Malay Muslims remained.\n\nDomestic and foreign missionary groups operated freely.\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respects this right in practice. Societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice occur, but they are relatively infrequent.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church in East Timor is part of the worldwide Roman Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome. There are over 900,000 Catholics in East Timor, a legacy of its status as a former Portuguese colony. Since its independence from Indonesia, East Timor became only the second predominantly Catholic country in Asia (after the Philippines) - approximately 96% of the population is Roman Catholic.\n\nThe country is divided into three dioceses; Dili, Maliana and Baucau, all of which are immediately subject to the Holy See.\n\nThe Apostolic Nuncio to East Timor is concurrently the nuncio to Malaysia. The current nuncio is the US archbishop Joseph Salvador Marino, and the nunciature is located in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nIn the early 16th century, Portuguese and Dutch traders made contact with East Timor. Missionaries maintained a sporadic contact until 1642 when Portugal took over and maintained control until 1974, with a brief occupation by Japan during World War II.\n\nPope John Paul II visited East Timor in October 1989. Pope John Paul II had spoken out against violence in East Timor, and called for both sides to show restraint, imploring the East Timorese to \"love and pray for their enemies.\" Retired bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo is a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize along with José Ramos-Horta in 1996 for their attempts to free East Timor from Indonesia. The Roman Catholic Church remains very involved in politics, with its 2005 confrontations with the government over religious education in school and the forgoing of war crimes trials for atrocities against East Timorese by Indonesia. They have also endorsed the new Prime Minister in his efforts to promote national reconciliation. In June 2006 Catholic Relief Services received aid from the United States to help victims of months of unrest in the country.\n\nIslam is a minority religion in East Timor. The US State Department and the CIA World Factbook estimate that Muslims make up 0.2% of the population. East Timor's first prime minister, Mari Alkatiri, is a Sunni Muslim.\n\nIn 2010, the Association of Religion Data Archives reported that according to the World Christian Database, Muslims made up 3.6 percent of the population. It also reported that 0.4% of the population identified as agnostic, and that Buddhism and Chinese folk religion each made up 0.2% of the population. It also reported that non-negligible populations followed the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, and Neoreligions, with each group comprising under 0.1% of the population.\n\nPrior to Christian and Muslim contact, the Austronesian people of Timor were animist polytheists with practises similar to those seen in Polynesia and Madagascar. A few prominent myths remain, such as the island's conception as an aging crocodile, but in modern times practitioners of indigenous religions constitute a very small minority.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19079549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19079549", "title": "Republic (Zeno)", "text": "Republic (Zeno)\n\nThe Republic () was a work written by Zeno of Citium, the founder of Stoic philosophy at the beginning of the 3rd century BC. Although it has not survived, it was his most famous work, and various quotes and paraphrases were preserved by later writers. The purpose of the work was to outline the ideal society based on Stoic principles, where virtuous men and women would live a life of simple asceticism in an equal society.\n\nWritten, it would seem, in conscious opposition to Plato's \"Republic\", Zeno's \"Republic\" (\"politeia\") outlined the principles of an ideal state written from the point of view of early Stoic philosophy. The work has not survived; but it was widely known in antiquity and more is known about it than any of his other works. Plutarch provides a summary of its intent:\nIt is not obvious from Plutarch's remarks whether he had read the work himself. One person who had read it was an otherwise unknown figure known as \"Cassius the Skeptic\", whose polemic written against Zeno's \"Republic\" is paraphrased by Diogenes Laërtius:\nFurther on, Laërtius makes some further remarks which also seem to be from the same work by Cassius:\nThese paraphrases by Cassius are not a neutral summary of the \"Republic\", his purpose seems to be to describe all the doctrines in the work which he found shocking. These include Zeno's denouncement of general education; his exhortation that only the virtuous can be regarded as true citizens; his view that men and women should wear the same clothes; and the idea that \"there should be a community of wives\", which in practice seems to have meant \"recognizing no other form of marriage than the union of the man who lives freely with a consenting woman\".\n\nA few other statements from the \"Republic\" are preserved by other writers. We learn from Laërtius that Zeno stated that the wise man will marry and produce children, and several writers mention Zeno's view that there is no need to build temples to the gods, \"for a temple not worth much is also not sacred, and nothing made by builders or workmen is worth much\". Athenaeus also preserves a quote on the need for a city to be built on the principle of love:\nZeno's \"Republic\" seems to have been viewed with some embarrassment by some of the later Stoics. This was not helped when Chrysippus, Zeno's most illustrious successor as the head of the Stoic school, wrote his own treatise \"On the Republic\" (probably a commentary on Zeno's work), in which (among many other things) he defended both incest and cannibalism. It is unlikely that Chrysippus urged the adoption of such behaviors; Chrysippus was probably responding to criticisms that in a society practicing free love, in which people often did not know who their relatives were, rare instances of incest would unintentionally occur; his discussion of cannibalism is probably connected with the Stoic contempt for dead bodies as an empty shell. Nevertheless, these points provided extra ammunition for those people who wished to attack both Zeno and Stoicism in general. Some blamed the influence which Crates of Thebes, the famous Cynic philosopher and teacher of Zeno, may have had when he wrote the \"Republic\": it was joked that Zeno \"had written it at the tail of the dog.\" By the 1st century BC, there was an attempt among the Stoics to downplay the involvement which Cynic philosophy had played in the development of early Stoicism; it was said that Zeno had been \"young and thoughtless\" when he wrote his \"Republic\". It was also said that \"by Zeno things were written which they [the Stoics] do not readily allow disciples to read, without their first giving proof whether or not they are genuine philosophers.\" Regardless of these views, it is clear that Zeno was one of the first philosophers in a long tradition begun by Plato of depicting an ideal society in order to understand ethical principles.\n\n\n"}

He is credited with writing fourteen texts.\n\nThe following fourteen texts are credited to Taran Svami. These texts are classified in five systems mentioned in one manuscript of \"Thikanesara\" (now at Khurai temple). Scholars have expressed doubts about his authorship of the \"Chadmastha Vani\" as it cites his death and of the \"Nama Mala\" as it contains names of his disciples. These texts are classified in five systems mentioned in one manuscript of \"Thikanesara\" (now at Khurai temple).\n\n\nThe three texts in the \"Vicara mata\" category are thirty-two verse compositions. They are the most popular texts of Taran Svami. \"Malarohana\" was composed for the marriage of Taran Svami's followers, according to the tradition. It is still read during marriage of the followers. Premi had said that during Daslakshana, the followers gather in the temple and recite \"Pandita Puja\" and \"Mamalapahuda\" in day and \"Malarohana\" and \"Kamala Battisi\" at night. K. Samaiya had equated them with Ratnatraya. Some members recite some of these texts daily.\n\nOther texts are not well-known. \"Sravakacara\" has 462 verses which defines code of conduct for lay followers which draws from earlier Digambara text \"Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra\". The \"Jñana Samuccaya Sara\" has 908 verses, and the \"Upadesha Shuddha Sara\" has 588 verses. These two texts discuss the Digambara philosophy and metaphysics. The \"Jñana Samuccaya Sara\" discusses \"Ratnatraya\", scriptures, the stages of lay spirituality, \"Anuvrata\" and \"Mahavrata\", seven types of Jain philosophy, \"Dravya\", \"Dhyana \" etc. The \"Upadesha Shuddha Sara\" discusses the path of liberation and its hurdles. The \"Tribhangi Sara\" has 71 verses which discusses the topics in triads. These four texts are close to the Digambara tradition of philosophy.\n\nThe \"Mamala Pahuda\" is a collection of songs. It has more than 3,200 verses. The \"Caubisa Thana\" discusses 24 topics of spirituality to gain liberation. It is mix of prose and verse and about 20 pages in total.\n\nThe \"Chadmastha Vani\" and \"Nama Mala\" are short prose texts about nine pages. It has information on Taran Svami and his followers and other subjects. Premi had said that \"Chadmastha Vani\" is recited by followers for five days after Diwali. The \"Khatika Vishesa\" discusses about \"Karma\" in context of the cycle of time. It is mix of prose and verse. The \"Siddha Subhava\" and \"Sunna Subhava\" are short prose. The \"Siddha Subhava\" discusses the purification of soul while the \"Sunna Subhav\" discusses ways of destoying ego.\n\nCommentaries on six of the main texts composed by Taran Svami were written by Brahmacari Shitala Prasad in the 1930s. Commentaries on other texts have also been done recently. Osho (Rajnish), who was born into a Taranpanthi family, has included \"Sunna Subhava\" and \"Siddhi Subhava\" as among the books that influenced him most.\n\nAfter death of Taran Svami, the history of the sect is unclear. The \"Nam Mala\" contains around 2000 names but its significance is unclear. Based on oral traditions, Taran Svami had disciples from varied classes and castes. His disciples were from Jain as well from non-Jain background. Some of his disciples had Muslim background. No scholarly study has constructed the early history of Taran Panth due to clear lack of literary tradition. The religious profession is also unclear in the sect. There were some associated with \"Nisaiji\" temples. There are no monks in the sect but they had some lay celibates (\"Brahmachari\" and \"Brahmacharini\"s).\n\nToday a large number of the followers of Taran Panth come from six merchant castes of Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh. Three of these – Samaiya, Dosakhe and Gulalare – were converts from Murtipujaka Jain communities, and the other three – Asethi, Ayodhyavasi and Carnagar – were converts from Vaishnava Hindu communities as informed to Jain scholar Cort. The total number of the followers of the Taran Panth range from 20,000 to 100,000. R. Samaiya had listed 131 temples and the number of followers just under 20,000 in 1989. Majority of the followers reside in Madhya Pradesh and some in south Uttar Pradesh and northwest Maharashtra.\n\nThe most important site is located in Malhargadh village in Guna district where Taran Svami spent his final years and where his last rites were performed. The shrine known as Nisaiji (\"Honoured Memorial\") is on the banks of the Betwa river. The three-days annual fair known as Phag Phulna (\"Phag Flowering\") is orhanised from Falgun Bright Fifth. In the past, there was an annual fair organised in honour of one of his Muslim disciple Ruiya Raman or Ruiya Jin but it is discontinued. Many followers visit here for Chudakarana ritual of their children. The shrine has stone windows and high canopies built in \"late medieval Rajput\" style. The style became standard for other shrines. The history of the site is written by Phulchandra who says that the shrine was initially just a \"chhatri\" (canopy). In 1817, Taracand Mallusav, a merchant from Nagpur rebuilt the shrine in its current form, the platform with twelve doors and several canopies. He had sponsored the annual fair and one of his family member, Kesaridau, died here. The shrine is simple and has a central marble altar which houses a pile of printed books. Behind it, there is an older stone altar which is considered as the original one. There are a records of patrons of fair from 1817. Since 1933, the fair is organised by the community. There are no images due to Taran Svami's emphasis on aniconism. There are three stone platforms in the Betwa river associated with events in his life.\n\nSemarkheri located near Sironj in Vidisha district has a shrine built by Banjaras. Here he spent some time engaging in spiritual activities. The annual fair is organised on Vasant Panchami. It is oldest shrine after Nisaiji and has records of the patrons of the fair dating back to 1881. Sukha near Pathariya village in Damoh district where Taran Svami preached. The old site was in dilapidated condition before the new constructions started in 1938. The annual fair is organised on Agahan Bright Seventh (November–December). The day of fair known as \"Taran Jayanti\" and is of recent origin. The shrine at Bilhari village near Katni in Jabalpur district is associated with birth of Taran Svami. The site became focus of community only recently and no annual fair is organised here.\n\nThere is a memorial dedicated to Himau Pande, one of Taran Svami's chief disciple at Chand village in Chhindwara district. The site only recently became a focus of development by local followers. There was only large platform in the past but now a large temple is built. The annual fair is organised on Jeth Dark Sixth, known as Samadhi Sixth, the death anniversary of Himau Pande.\n\nThere is also a large platform at Garaula (or Garhaula), near Tindua in Damoh district which is associated with Taran Svami's childhood days at his maternal uncle's house.\n\nThe temples are fairly simple in design with open spaces and least ornamentation. The marble altars in temple has symbols associated with generalized auspiciousness. Due to aniconic emphasis, there are no images placed in the temples. Sometimes the altar has books of Taran Svami and of other writers from Digambara mystic and philosophical traditions.\n\nThe order of the services were organised by Jayasagar in the mid-twentieth century.\n\nThe temple rituals are as follows: The follower enters the temple and bows to the altar as the sign of respect then recites three verses drawn from Taran Svami's texts known as \"Tatva Patha\" or \"Tatva Mangal\" in front of the altar. This is followed by singing \"Bhajan\"s or hymns. If there is a sermon, \"bhaiji\" or \"pande\", a local intellectual associated with temple or other intellectuals known as \"pundit\" will deliver sermons to seated followers. The sermon ends with everyone standing and singing a hymn known as \"Abalabali\". The ritual ends with the \"Arati\". The \"Arati\" has two parts; the first one is dedicated to \"Dev\" (God), \"Guru\" (teacher) and scriptures while the other part is dedicated to Taran Svami.\n\n"}

{"id": "2584160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2584160", "title": "Vusamazulu Credo Mutwa", "text": "Vusamazulu Credo Mutwa\n\nVusamazulu Credo Mutwa (born 21 July 1921) is a Zulu sangoma (traditional healer) from South Africa. He is known as an author of books on stories mixing traditional Zulu folklore, extraterrestrial encounters and his own personal encounters. His most recent work is a graphic novel called the \"Tree of Life Trilogy\" based on his writings of his most famous book, \"Indaba my Children\".\n\nCredo calls himself a \"sanusi\" (common spelling \"isanuse\") which is a type of Zulu diviner or sangoma. The term stems from a more historic time and is not widely used today, even in a traditional setting.\n\nCredo currently lives with his wife, Virginia, in Kuruman where they run a hospice clinic.\n\nHis father was a widower with three surviving children when he met his mother. His father was a builder and a Christian and his mother was a young Zulu girl. Caught between Catholic missionaries on one hand, and a stubborn old Zulu warrior, Credo Mutwa's maternal grandfather, his parents had no choice but to separate. Credo was born out of wedlock, which caused a great scandal in the village and his mother was thrown out by her father. Later he was taken in by one of his aunts.\n\nHe was subsequently raised by his father's brother and was taken to the South Coast of Natal (present day KwaZulu-Natal), near the northern bank of the Mkomazi River. He did not attend school until he was 14 years old. In 1935 his father found a building job in the old Transvaal province and the whole family relocated to where he was building.\n\nAfter falling severely ill, he was taken back to KwaZulu-Natal by his uncle. Where Christian doctors had failed, his grandfather, a man whom his father despised as a heathen and demon worshipper, helped him back to health. At this point Credo began to question many of the things about his people the missionaries would have them believe. \"Were we Africans really a race of primitives who possessed no knowledge at all before the white man came to Africa?\" he asked himself. His grandfather instilled in him the belief that his illness was a sacred calling that he was to become a sangoma, a healer. He underwent \"thwasa\" (sangoma training and initiation) with his grandfather and mother's sister, a young sangoma named Mynah.\n\nIn 1974, Credo obtained a piece of land on the Oppenheimer gardens in Soweto in order to create an African cultural village. He created many sculptures and populated the village with huts and symbols that he claimed was secret African mythology. The village was primary designed for tourism to promote African culture and was generally ignored by the Sowetan locals, partly due to the unfamiliarity of the mythology that was being represented.\n\nCredo believed that the great unrest in Johannesburg and the popularisation of communism in the black struggle drew Africans away from their traditional roots. Unlike most political activists, he actually supported a separation between white and black in order to preserve black traditional tribal customs and way of life. In 1976, students partially burnt down the cultural village after he was misquoted on Afrikaans radio, as they saw the village promoting tribalism and separate development. Parts of the village was burnt again in the mid 80's during a strike against the West Rand city council.\nFollowing the murder of his son by black political \"activists\" and the second burning of his village, Credo moved away from Soweto and developed a cultural tourist village in Lotlamoreng, Mahikeng, (known at that time as Bophuthatswana). Here he supervised the building of small cultural villages, each representing the traditional cultures of the main South African tribal peoples.\n\nThe Kwa-Khaya Lendaba cultural village in Soweto is currently being restored and is still open to the public free of charge. Tour guides are available from the caretaker of the village.\n\nAlthough many of the sculptures at Kwa-Khaya Lendaba were unfamiliar to the Africans they were meant to represent, a number of them have been said to be prophetic in nature. Most notably, was claims of predicting the coming of HIV/AIDS to South Africa. This was seen in his fictional sculptures of King Khandakhulu, who had 200 wives. He couldn't satisfy them all sexually, and so they went out and satisfied themselves elsewhere, which led to them all contracting incurable sexually transmitted infections. The sores on King Khandakhulu's penis resemble the AIDS ribbon. These sculpture were created in 1979, 3 years before scientists uncovered the human immunodeficiency virus. Claims of his other predictions include the destruction of World Trade Centres in the September 11 attacks, Chris Hani’s assassination and the ousting of president Thabo Mbeki, among others.\n\nCredo has been an active and vocal advocate in the use of traditional African medicines for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, cancer and tuberculosis. He created a trust called the Vulinda Trust in 1999 to preserve traditional knowledge and to promote the use of these traditional medicines. The primary focus of his research has been on a South African plant called \"unwele\" in Zulu (Sutherlandia frutescens). Unwele is traditionally used as a well being tonic, however has demonstrated anticancer activity through in vitro studies. Research of the efficacy of Sutherlandia frutescens in the treatment of HIV/AIDS is ongoing and phase IIb trials are being conducted at the South African Herbal Science and Medicine Institute (SAHSMI).\n\nMutwa has allied himself with David Icke's theory of a 'reptilian agenda' - i.e. that \"a reptilian extraterrestrial race has controlled the world for thousands of years\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46639", "title": "World Council of Churches", "text": "World Council of Churches\n\nThe World Council of Churches (WCC) is a worldwide inter-church organization founded in 1948. Its members today include the Assyrian Church of the East, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, most jurisdictions of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Old Catholic Church, Anglican Communion, most mainline Protestant churches (such as the Lutheran, Mennonite, Methodist, Moravian and Reformed) and some evangelical Protestant churches (such as the Baptist and Pentecostal). Notably, the Catholic Church is not a member, although it sends accredited observers to meetings. The WCC arose out of the ecumenical movement and has as its basis the following statement:\n\nThe WCC describes itself as \"a worldwide fellowship of 349 global, regional and sub-regional, national and local churches seeking unity, a common witness and Christian service.\" It is based at the Ecumenical Centre in Geneva, Switzerland. The organization's members include denominations which claim to collectively represent some 590 million people across the world in about 150 countries, including 520,000 local congregations served by 493,000 pastors and priests, in addition to elders, teachers, members of parish councils and others.\n\nThe Ecumenical Movement met with initial successes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the Edinburgh Missionary Conference of 1910 (chaired by future WCC Honorary President John R. Mott). In 1920, the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Germanus V of Constantinople, wrote a letter \"addressed 'To all the Churches of Christ, wherever they may be', urging closer co-operation among separated Christians, and suggesting a 'League of Churches', parallel to the newly founded League of Nations\". Church leaders agreed in 1937 to establish a World Council of Churches, based on a merger of the \"Faith and Order Movement\" (under Charles Brent of the Episcopal Church of the United States) and \"Life and Work Movement\" (under Nathan Söderblom of the Lutheran Church of Sweden) organisations.\n\nIts official establishment was deferred with the outbreak of World War II until August 23, 1948. Delegates of 147 churches assembled in Amsterdam to merge the \"Faith and Order Movement\" and \"Life and Work Movement\". This was consolidated by a second meeting at Lund in 1950, for which the British Methodist Robert Newton Flew edited an influential volume of studies, \"The Nature of the Church\". Subsequent mergers were with the \"International Missionary Council\" in 1961 and the \"World Council of Christian Education\", with its roots in the 18th century Sunday School movement, in 1971.\n\nWCC member churches include most of the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches; the Anglican Communion; some Old Catholic churches; and numerous Protestant churches, including some Baptists, many Lutheran, Methodist, and Presbyterian and other Reformed, a sampling of united and independent churches, and some Pentecostal churches.\n\nMany churches who refused to join the WCC joined together to form the World Evangelical Alliance.\n\nDelegates sent from the member churches meet every seven or eight years in an Assembly, which elects a Central Committee that governs between Assemblies. A variety of other committees and commissions answer to the Central Committee and its staff. Assemblies have been held since 1948.\n\nThe \"human rights abuses in communist countries evoked grave concern among the leaders of the World Council of Churches.\" However, historian Christopher Andrew claims that, during the Cold War, a number of important WCC representatives of the Orthodox Church in Eastern Europe had been working for the KGB, and that they influenced the policy of the WCC. From 1955 to 1958, Robert S. Bilheimer co-chaired a WCC international commission to prepare a document addressing the threat of nuclear warfare during the Cold War.\n\nAt the 1961 conference, a 32-year-old Russian Orthodox Bishop named Aleksey Ridiger was sent as delegate to the assembly, and then appointed to the WCC's central committee. He was later elected as Russian patriarch in 1990 as Alexei II.\n\nThe ninth assembly took place in Porto Alegre, Brazil in February 2006, under the theme \"God, in your grace, transform the world\". During the first Assemblies, theologians Vasileios Ioannidis and Amilkas Alivizatos contributed significantly to the debates that led to the drafting of the \"Toronto Statement\", a foundational document which facilitated Eastern Orthodox participation in the organization and today it constitutes its ecclesiological charter.\n\nThe 10th Assembly was held in Busan, Republic of Korea, from 30 October to 8 November 2013.\n\nIn 2013 Dr. Agnes Abuom of Nairobi, from the Anglican Church of Kenya, was elected as moderator of the Central Committee of the World Council of Churches; she is the first woman and the first African to hold this position.\n\nThe World Council of Churches held 10 Assemblies to date, starting with the founding assembly in 1948:\n\nPresidents of the current 10th Assembly are:\n\nFormer presidents of the World Council of Churches include:\n\nSince the World Council of Churches was officially founded in 1948, the following men have served as general secretary:\n\nThere are two complementary approaches to ecumenism: dialogue and action. The \"Faith and Order Movement\" and \"Life and Work Movement\" represent these approaches. These approaches are reflected in the work of the WCC in its commissions, these being:\n\nThe WCC acts through both its member churches and other religious and social organizations to coordinate ecumenical, evangelical, and social action.\n\nCurrent WCC programs include a Decade to Overcome Violence, an international campaign to combat AIDS/HIV in Africa and the \"Justice, Peace and Creation\" initiative.\n\nWCC's Faith and Order Commission has been successful in working toward consensus on Baptism, Eucharist, and Ministry, on the date of Easter, on the nature and purpose of the church (ecclesiology), and on ecumenical hermeneutics.\n\n\nJustice, Peace and Creation has drawn many elements together with an environmental focus. Its mandate is:\n\nFocal issues have been globalization and the emergence of new social movements (in terms of people \"bonding together\" in the struggle for justice, peace, and the protection of creation).\n\nAttention has been given to issues around:\n\nThe largest Christian body, the Catholic Church, is not a member of the WCC, but has worked closely with the Council for more than three decades and sends observers to all major WCC conferences as well as to its Central Committee meetings and the Assemblies (cf. Joint Working Group).\n\nThe Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity also nominates 12 members to the WCC's \"Faith and Order Commission\" as full members. While not a member of the WCC, the Catholic Church is a member of some other ecumenical bodies at regional and national levels, for example, the National Council of Churches in Australia and the National Council of Christian Churches in Brazil (CONIC).\n\nPope Pious XI stated in 1928, that the only means by which the world Christian community was to return to faith, was to return to Roman Catholic Worship. In this regard, there was the idea that the Papacy had rejected, to a great extent; the participation of the Catholic Church within the World Council of Churches. \nPious stated that the ‘One true Church’ was that of the Roman Catholic denomination, and therefore there was the implication that the Catholic Church was not permitted at this stage to engage with other denominations, which the Papacy considered to be irrelevant. The Catholic Church therefore did not attend the 1948 meeting of the WCC, in addition to the idea that all members of the church were barred from attending WCC conferences. \n\nPope John Paul XXIII took a different stance however, and in 1958 he was elected as the head of the Catholic Church. Ecumenism was a new element of catholic ideology which had been permitted, which was signified to a great extent, when John Paul XXIII met with the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher. This was the first meeting between an Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Pope in the Vatican for 600 years. John Paul XXIII later developed the office of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity; which symbolised a dramatic shift in support for the ecumenical movement, from the Catholic Church, led from the Vatican. 1961 saw Catholic members attend the Delhi conference of the WCC, which masked a significant shift in attitude toward the WCC from the Papacy. There was the idea in addition to this, that the Pope invited non-Catholics to attend the Vatican II council. This new approach to inter-denominational relations was marked within the Unitatis Redintegratino. \n\nThis document marked several key reforms within the Catholic approach: \n\nI. ‘Separated brethren’ was the new term for non-catholics, as opposed to the previously used ‘heretics’ \n\nII. Both catholic and non- catholic elements are held responsible for the schism between Catholicism and the Protestant movement\n\nIII. Non-catholics are recognised to the contributions that they make to Christian belief overall \n\nIV. The Catholic Church is no longer identified as the one true source of Christian knowledge \n\nFurther reforms have been enacted with regard to the nature of the Catholic Church on the world stage, for instance the 1965 union with the Patriarch of Constantinople, whereby the 1054 schism was undermined. In addition to this, Michael Ramsay, the then Archbishop of Canterbury, received an episcopal ring in 1966; a mark of union which had not been seen since prior to the reformation. Moreover, the Anglican, Roman-Catholic Internaitonal Committee was additionally established as a means of promoting communication and cohesion between the two denominations. This has since marked a new level of participation of the Catholic Faith in the aforementioned ecumenical movement, and therefore is the basis for increased participation from the faith, in the WCC.\n\nA \"Special Commission\" was set up by the eighth Harare Assembly in December 1998 to address Orthodox concerns about WCC membership and the Council's decision-making style, public statements, worship practices, and other issues. It issued its final report in 2006. Specific issues that it clarified were that the WCC does not formulate doctrine, does not have authority to rule on moral issues, nor does it have any ecclesiastical authority. Such authority is entirely internal to each individual member church. It proposed that the WCC adopt a consensus method of decision making. It proposed that Orthodox members be brought in parity with non-Orthodox members. It further proposed clarification that inter-confessional prayer at WCC events is not worship, particularly \"it should avoid giving the impression of being the worship of a church\", and confessional and inter-confessional prayer each be specifically identified as such at WCC events. It also clarified that the so-called \"Lima Liturgy\" is not an interfaith eucharistic service: 'the WCC is not 'hosting' a eucharist'.\n\nThe WCC is also a prominent supporter and practitioning body for Peace journalism: journalism practice that aims to avoid a value bias in favor of violence that often characterizes coverage of conflict.\n\nThe ACT Alliance, bringing together over 100 church-backed relief and development organizations worldwide, was born out of the merger of ACT International (Action by Churches Together International) and ACT Development (Action by Churches Together for Development) in March 2010. Both ACT International, established in 1995, and ACT Development (2007) were created through the leadership of the World Council of Churches (WCC). The two bodies coordinated the work of agencies related to the member churches of the WCC and the Lutheran World Federation in the areas of humanitarian emergencies and poverty reduction respectively.\n\nThe Ecumenical Advocacy Alliance was officially founded in December 2000 at a meeting convened by the WCC. There are currently 73 churches and Christian organizations that are members of the Alliance, from Catholic, Evangelical, Orthodox and Protestant traditions. These members, representing a combined constituency of tens of millions of people around the world, are committed to working together in public witness and action for justice on defined issues of common concern. Current campaigns are on Food and on HIV and AIDS.\n\nThe Ecumenical Church Loan Fund (ECLOF) was founded in 1946 as one of the world's first international micro-credit institutions in the service of the poor. Willem Visser 't Hooft, then general secretary of the \"WCC in process of formation\" played an important role in founding ECLOF. It was he who sketched the prospects and challenges for the proposed institution and gave specific ideas on potential sources of funds. His inspiration and teamwork marked the beginning of a long and fruitful cooperation between ECLOF and the WCC.\n\nThe Ecumenical Development Cooperative Society U.A (now known as Oikocredit) was developed from discussions at the 1968 Uppsala 4th Assembly, regarding church divestment from financial institutions supporting apartheid-era South Africa and the war in Vietnam. After several years of planning, the cooperative society was founded in 1975 in the Netherlands to provide an alternative ethical investment vehicle to church institutions, by providing credit to productive enterprises serving economically disadvantaged populations. Originally organized for large institutional members of the WCC, by 1976 local congregations developed Support Associations to enable congregations as well as individuals to participate. EDCS became independent from the WCC in 1977.\n\nEcumenical News International (ENI) was launched in 1994 as a global news service reporting on ecumenical developments and other news of the churches, and giving religious perspectives on news developments worldwide. The joint sponsors of ENI, which was based at the Ecumenical Centre in Geneva, Switzerland, are the World Council of Churches, the Lutheran World Federation, the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, and the Conference of European Churches, which also have their headquarters at the Ecumenical Centre. A shortage of funds led to the suspension of the work of ENI in 2012. As of 2015 ENI remains closed.\n\nThe WCC has not sought the organic union of different Christian denominations, but it has, however, facilitated dialogue and supported local, national, and regional dialogue and cooperation.\n\nMembership in a regional or national council does not mean that the particular group is also a member of the WCC.\n\nMany historians, the U.S. State Department and former KGB officers themselves have alleged and provided corroborating evidence that the KGB's influence directly, or through lobbying by means of a front organization, the Christian Peace Conference, resulted in the WCC's failure to recognize or act on calls for help from persecuted East European Christians at the 1983 Vancouver General Assembly.\n\nIt is claimed the KGB has infiltrated and influenced past WCC councils and policy. In 1992, Father Gleb Yakunin, a vice Chairman of a Russian parliamentary commission that investigated the activities of the KGB, citing verbatim KGB reports, claimed that its Fifth Directorate was actively involved in influencing WCC policy from 1967 to 1989. For example, in the 1983 WCC General Assembly in Vancouver, one cited document described the presence and activities of 47 KGB agents to secure the election of an \"acceptable\" candidate as General Secretary. The Mitrokhin Archive reveals more about the depth of the penetration and influence wielded by the KGB over the WCC. Metropolitan Nikidim was a KGB agent, codenamed ADAMANT, who served as one of six WCC Presidents from 1975 until his death. His earlier intervention had resulted in the WCC making no comment on the invasion of Czechoslovakia. As a result of his influence and that of other agents, it is claimed the USSR was rarely publicly criticised. In 1989, copies of the KGB documents claim \"the WCC executive and central committee adopted public statements (eight) and messages (three)\" which corresponded to its own political direction. Appeals from suffering dissidents both from within the Russian Orthodox Church and Protestants were ignored in 1983. Metropolitan Aleksi Ridiger of Tallinn and Estonia was repeatedly alleged to be a KGB agent codenamed DROZDOV, who in 1988 was awarded an honorary citation for services to the KGB by its chairman. Despite official disavowals, The Guardian described the evidence as \"compelling\". In 1990 he became Aleksi II, the 15th Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church. Upon his death in 2008, the WCC's official tribute, by its Council officers, described him as \"courageous\", \"supportive and constructive\" and the recipient of \"abundant blessing\", no reference was made to the allegations.\n\nThe World Council of Churches has been described as taking an adversarial position toward the state of Israel. It has also been claimed the council has focused particularly on activities and publications criticizing Israel in comparison with other human rights issues. Because the WCC never opposed or had any official comments on the destruction of Jewish religious sites in the Middle East, but has constantly complained about Israel's alleged crimes towards Christian sites in Israel, Israel has pointedly ignored the WCC for 50 years and often stated that the WCC's opinions on Israel are hypocritical to the point of being bankrupt. It is similarly claimed that it downplayed appeals from Egyptian Copts about human rights abuses under Sadat and Mubarak, in order to focus on its neighbour. In 2009, the Council called for an international boycott on goods produced in Israeli settlements, which it described as 'illegal, unjust' and 'incompatible with peace'. In 2013, the General Secretary was reported to claim in Cairo, \"We support the Palestinians. The WCC supports the Palestinians, because they are in the right.\" The WCC's Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel (EAPPI) has been criticised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews for promoting \"an inflammatory and partisan programme at the expense of its interfaith relations\". The WCC secretariat was involved in preparing and helped disseminate the Kairos Palestine Document, which declares “the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land is a sin against God and humanity because it deprives the Palestinians of their basic human rights”, and in the view of one critic, its \"authors want to see a single state\".\nOn the other hand, the WCC claims \"Antisemitism is sin against God and man\".\n\nChristian Zionism, which has long represented a substantial proportion of historic and contemporary Protestants, is characterised as a view which \"distort(s) the interpretation of the Word of God\" and \"damage(s) intra-Christian relations\".\n\n"}

Ron Hubbard\n\nLafayette Ronald Hubbard (March 13, 1911 – January 24, 1986), better known as L. Ron Hubbard, was an American pulp fiction author. He wrote in a wide variety of genres, including science fiction, fantasy, adventure fiction, aviation, travel, mystery, western and romance. He is perhaps best known for his self-help book, the #1 New York Times bestseller Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health (first published in 1950), and as the founder of the Church of Scientology.\n\nL. Ron Hubbard was a prolific writer; according to the church, his written teachings make up approximately 500,000 pages and 3,000 recorded lectures, totaling about 65 million words. He also produced a hundred films and 500 short stories and novels.\n\nAlthough he was best known for his pulp fantasy and science fiction, Hubbard also wrote adventure, aviation, travel, mystery, western and romance. He wrote under his own name and as Kurt von Rachen and René Lafayette, his principal science fiction/fantasy pseudonyms. His other pen names included \"Winchester Remington Colt (rather obviously reserved for Westerns), Lt Jonathan Daly, Capt Charles Gordon, Bernard Hubbel, Michael Keith, Legionnaire 148, Legionnaire 14830, Ken Martin, Scott Morgan or Lt Scott Morgan, Barry Randolph and Capt Humbert Reynolds.\"\n\nHubbard's first short story, \"Tah,\" was published in the Literary Supplement of The Hatchet, George Washington University's campus paper, in February 1932. In February 1934, the pulp magazine Thrilling Adventure was the first to publish one of Hubbard's short stories. Over the next six years, more than 140 of his short stories appeared in similar magazines devoted to high adventure and mystery.\n\nHubbard began publishing Science Fiction with the magazine Astounding in 1938, and over the next decade he was a prolific contributor to both Astounding and the fantasy fiction magazine Unknown. However, despite efforts by later supporters to assign to Hubbard a central role in the creation of modern science fiction, he was not a member of the small group of prime movers—L Sprague de Camp, Robert A Heinlein and Isaac Asimov—in the genre.\n\nHubbard's first major financial success came with the publication of Dianetics in 1950, after which he departed the field of science fiction writing for many years. In 1951, he refashioned the material of Dianetics into Scientology. At this time, he established his first publishing organization, devoted exclusively to his own works, and used it (and its later incarnations) to publish his own so-called \"spiritual technology,\" as well as his ideas about business administration, literacy and drug rehabilitation. His views on these topics remain a source of controversy, with supporters lauding their effectiveness and critics claiming they are useless, at best, and at worst, dangerous.\n\nHubbard returned to the field of Science Fiction writing in 1982 with the publication of Battlefield Earth, followed by the Mission Earth \"dekalogy,\" a ten-volume series, most of which was published posthumously.\n\nHubbard produced more than 250 published works of fiction in his writing career. At his peak, he wrote “over 100,000 words a month.” He is remembered for his “prodigious output\" and the \"amazing speed at which he could produce copy.” He used a special electric IBM typewriter with extra keys for common words like ‘and’, ‘the’, and ‘but.’ \n\nScientology's publishing arm has translated his work into seventy-two languages. His fiction and non-fiction books have sold millions of copies, and Hubbard holds four Guinness World Records for “Most Published Works by One Author”, “Most Audio Books Published for One Author”, “Most Translated Author in the World”, and \"Most Translated Author, Same Book\" (The Way to Happiness).\n\nCriticism of Hubbard's fiction is mixed. Georges T. Dodds, columnist for WARP, newsletter/fanzine of the Montreal Science Fiction and Fantasy association writes, \"much of [Hubbard's]science fiction and fantasy is quite entertaining, and in most cases as good or better than much of the pulp literature of the era.\" A reviewer for \"Publishers Weekly\" emphasizes \"Hubbard's ability to pack an epic into relatively few pages -- this is indeed golden science fiction from the Golden Age.\". The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction maintains that science fiction \"was clearly not Hubbard's forte, and most of his work in the genre reads as tendentious or laboured or both. As a writer of fantasy, however, [Hubbard] wrote with an occasionally pixillated fervour that is still pleasing, and sometimes reminiscent of the screwball comedies popular in the 1930s cinema.\"\n\nFinally, Encyclopedia of Science Fiction has this to say about Hubbard's last foray into the genre of science fiction: \"Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000 (1982), [is] an enormously long space opera composed in an idiom that seemed embarrassingly archaic. This was followed by the Mission Earth 'dekalogy,' a ten-volume sequence whose farcical over-egging of a seriously thin narrative thread fails to disguise a tale that would have been more at home in the dawn of the Pulp magazines, though its length would not have been tolerated.\"\n\nWhile nineteen of Hubbard's books have appeared on the New York Times best seller list, critics have called this apparent feat an illusion. Evidence emerged early on that the best-selling statuses of many of these titles were in fact rigged by Scientology and Scientologists.\n\nHubbard is credited with writing the story on which \"The Secret of Treasure Island\", a 1938 Columbia Pictures movie serial, was based, as well as the story on which one episode of the TV show \"Tales of Wells Fargo\" (1957) was based.\n\nThough both Hubbard and The Church of Scientology have made claims that he worked on a number of other Hollywood projects, there is no independently verifiable evidence to support this.\n\nThis is a partial list of Hubbard’s published works of fiction. Included are Fear, To the Stars, Final Blackout and Typewriter in the Sky, which were published in 1940 and reprinted numerous times. To the Stars was published in Astounding Science Fiction magazine in 1950. Hubbard had a total of 235 works of fiction published. Reprinted titles, reprinted by publisher Galaxy Press, include The Iron Duke, Hostage to Death, Cargo of Coffins, Brass Keys to Murder, and Under the Black Ensign.\n\nWar-ravaged Europe is the setting of Final Blackout, which Pau Walker described as \"a bleak, harsh novel of hopeless conflict and an idealistic lieutenant who fights it to its ironic end.\" A similar grim irony pervades Death's Deputy, in which an immortal, voided to punish humans according to the whims of his race, seeks in vain his own death. The short novels Typewriter in the Sky and \"Fear\" (Hubbard novella) are horrific fantasies which many critics consider to be classics of the science fiction's golden age. Fear, which relates the existence of a man who alternates between psychosis and sanity, is considered among Hubbard's finest works. Hubbard's last book of this period, Return to Tomorrow, is a \"space opera\" which anticipates future science fiction themes in its story about intergalactic traders from whom one month equals a century of earth time. Hubbard's stories written under the pseudonym of Rene Lafayette and collected in Ole Doc Methuselah (1970) relate the tales of a medical doctor who traverses time and space while opposing criminals and enemies for his profession.\n\nBattlefield Earth is a 1982 science fiction novel written by Hubbard. He composed a soundtrack to the book called Space Jazz. Initially titled \"Man, the Endangered Species\", Battlefield Earth was first published in 1982 by St. Martin's Press, though all subsequent reprintings have been by Church of Scientology publishing companies Bridge Publications and Galaxy Press. Written in the style of the pulp fiction era (during which Hubbard began his writing career), the novel is a massive work (over 750 pages in hardcover, 1000+ in paperback). It was Hubbard's first openly science fiction novel since his pulp magazine days of the 1940s, and it was promoted as Hubbard's \"return\" to science fiction after a long hiatus.\n\nThe Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction described the book as a \"rather good, fast-paced, often fascinating SF adventure yarn.\" The fantasy author Neil Gaiman wrote, \"For value for money I have to recommend L. Ron Hubbard's massive Battlefield Earth - over 1000 pages of thrills, spills, vicious aliens, noble humans. Is mankind an endangered species? Will handsome and heroic Jonny Goodboy Tyler win Earth back from the nine-foot-high Psychlos? A tribute to the days of Pulp, I found it un-put-downable. And all for £2.95\". Frederik Pohl said, \"I read 'Battlefield Earth' straight through in one sitting although it's immense... I was fascinated by it.\" Kevin J. Anderson says, \"Battlefield Earth is like a 12-hour 'Indiana Jones' marathon. Non-stop and fast-paced. Every chapter has a big bang-up adventure.\" Publishers Weekly said about the novel, \"This has everything: suspense, pathos, politics, war, humor, diplomacy and intergalactic finance...\" Science fiction author A. E. van Vogt stated, \"Wonderful adventure ... great characters ... a masterpiece.\" but later admitted that he had not actually read it due to its size.\n\nBattlefield Earth went to the top of the New York Times Best Seller list and also those of the Los Angeles Times, TIME, United Press International, Associated Press, B. Dalton's and Waldenbooks. According to Hubbard's literary agents, Author Services Inc., by June 1983 the book had sold 150,000 copies and earned $1.5 million.\n\nThe book was adapted for film in 2000, and retains a cult status, despite bombing at the box office and being critically panned. As usual for Hollywood, the film adaptation made a number of deviations from the source material.\n\nTo the Stars was first published in book format in 1954 under the title, Return to Tomorrow, it was first published in hardcover in 1975 under the same title. The book was generally positively received, and garnered a 2001 nomination for a \"Retro\" Hugo Award for Best Novella. Publishers Weekly gave the book a positive review, calling it one of Hubbard's \"finest works\", and Alan Cheuse highlighted the work on National Public Radio's program \"All Things Considered\" as a top literature holiday pick.\n\n\"Galaxy\" reviewer Groff Conklin described the 1954 edition as \"a fast-paced and grim adventure . . . just short of absurdity, but interesting nevertheless.\" Anthony Boucher panned the novel, calling it \"a surprisingly routine and plotless space opera.\"\n\nBuckskin Brigades was Hubbard's first hard-covered book, and his first published novel. Hubbard incorporates historical background from the Blackfeet tribe into the book. The book was re-released by Bridge Publications in a 1987 edition. The book was published in an audio book format by Bridge Publications and read by actor Bruce Boxleitner, ]who was hired by Church of Spiritual Technology subsidiary Author Services Inc. to read Hubbard's books on tape. The New York Times stated that, \"Mr. Hubbard has reversed a time-honored formula and has given a thriller to which, at the end of every chapter or so, another paleface bites the dust . . . (has) an enthusiasm, even a freshness and sparkle, decidedly rare in this type of romance.\"\n\nSome sources state that as a young man, Hubbard became a blood brother to the Piegan Blackfeet Native American tribe while living in Montana, though this claim is disputed. Hubbard incorporates historical background from the Blackfeet tribe into the book.\n\nDeath’s Deputy was first published in book form, in 1948, by Fantasy Publishing Company, Inc. The novel originally appeared in the February 1940 issue of the magazine Unknown.\n\nFear is a psychological thriller-horror novella by Hubbard first appearing in \"Unknown\" Fantasy Fiction in July 1940. Stephen King called the book, \"A classic tale of creeping, surreal menace and horror.\" This is possibly Hubbard's most critically acclaimed novel, receiving positive reviews from the likes of Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury.\n\nFinal Blackout was first published in serialized format in 1940 in the science fiction magazine Astounding Science Fiction. It was published in book form in 1948 by The Hadley Publishing Co. Author Services Inc. published a hardcover edition of the book in 1988, and in 1989 the Church of Scientology-affiliated organization Bridge Publications announced that film director Christopher Cain had signed a contract to write and direct a movie version based on the book. Final Blackout and Fear are often cited by critics as the best examples of Hubbard's pulp fiction works. Robert Heinlein called the book “as perfect a piece of Science Fiction as has ever been written.\" Chuck Moss of Daily News of Los Angeles called the book \"extremely good science fiction\". The book has been included in the curriculum of a science-fiction writing class at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona Karl Edward Wagner cited Final Blackout as one of the thirteen best science-fiction horror novels.\n\nKingslayer is a collection of science fiction short stories by Hubbard. It was first published in 1949 by Fantasy Publishing Company, Inc. in an edition of 1,200 copies. The title story first appeared in this collection. The other stories had previously appeared in the magazine Astounding.\n\nOle Doc Methuselah, published in 1970, is a collection of science fiction short stories by Hubbard originally published in \"Astounding Science Fiction\" from 1947 to 1950.\n\nSlaves of Sleep was first published in book form, in 1948, by Shasta Publishers, and originally appeared in 1939 in an issue of the magazine Unknown.\n\nTypewriter in the Sky was well received. \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" called it \"swashbuckling fun\", and John Clute and John Grant in T\"he Encyclopedia of Fantasy\" characterized the work as the best of Hubbard's stories from the Arabian-fantasy theme.\n\n\"Mission Earth\" is an epic science fiction novel, split into ten volumes of unequal length.\nEach volume was a New York Times bestseller. The ten volumes of the \"Mission Earth\" series, all bar the first of which were published posthumously, comprise \"The Invaders Plan\" (1985), Black \"Genesis: Fortress of Evil, The Enemy Within, An Alien Affair, Fortune Of Fear, Death Quest\" (1986), \"Voyage Of Vengeance, Disaster, Villainy Victorious\" and \"The Doomed Planet\" (1987).\n\nEstablished and sponsored by Hubbard in 1983, the \"Writers Award Contest\" is a competition aimed at discovering, and eventually publishing, deserving amateur and aspiring writers. To enter, a writer must not have professionally published more than three short stories or more than one novelette. There is no entry fee and the entrant retains all rights to their work. The L.

{"id": "8736457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8736457", "title": "Zoroastre", "text": "Zoroastre\n\nZoroastre (\"Zoroaster\") is an opera by Jean-Philippe Rameau, first performed on 5 December 1749 by the Opéra in the first Salle du Palais-Royal in Paris. The libretto is by Louis de Cahusac. \"Zoroastre\" was the fourth of Rameau's \"tragédies en musique\" to be staged and the last to appear during the composer's own lifetime. Audiences gave the original version a lukewarm reception, so Rameau and his librettist thoroughly reworked the opera for a revival which took place at the Opéra on 19 January 1756. This time the work was a great success and this is the version generally heard today.\n\n\"Zoroastre\"'s premiere in 1749 was not a success; despite the magnificence of the staging, it failed to compete with Mondonville's new \"opéra-ballet\" \"Le carnaval du Parnasse\". Rameau and Cahusac decided to rework the opera completely before offering it to the public again in 1756. Acts 2,3 and 5 were heavily rewritten and there were several modifications to the plot. This time audiences took to the opera, although the critic Melchior Grimm was withering about Cahusac's libretto: \"In \"Zoroastre\" it is day and night alternately; but as the poet...cannot count up to five he has got so muddled in his reckoning that he has been compelled to make it be day and night two or three times in each act, so that it might be day at the end of the play\". \"Zoroastre\" was chosen to open the new Paris opera house on January 26, 1770, the old one having burned down in 1763. It was also translated into Italian by Casanova for a performance in Dresden in 1752, although some of Rameau's music was replaced by that of the ballet master Adam. Its first modern revival was in a concert version at the Schola Cantorum, Paris in 1903. The United States premiere of the opera was staged by Boston Baroque (then known as Banchetto Musicale) at Harvard University's Sanders Theater under conductor Martin Pearlman in 1983 with Jean Claude Orliac in the title role and James Maddalena as Abramane.\n\n\"Zoroastre\" includes some important innovations: it was the first major French opera to dispense with an allegorical prologue and its subject matter is not drawn from the Classical mythology of Greece and Rome, as was usual, but from Persian religion. There was good reason for this. As Graham Sadler writes, the opera is \"a thinly disguised portrayal of Freemasonry\". Cahusac, the librettist, was a leading French Mason and many of his works celebrate the ideals of the Enlightenment, including \"Zoroastre\". The historical Zoroaster was highly regarded in Masonic circles and the parallels are obvious between Rameau's opera and an even more famous Masonic allegory, Mozart's \"The Magic Flute\" (1791), with its initiation rites conducted under the auspices of the wise \"Sarastro\".\n\n\"The synopsis is based on 1756 version\"\n\nThe story takes place in the ancient kingdom of Bactria and concerns the struggle between the forces of Good, led by Zoroastre, the \"founder of the Magi\", and Evil, led by the sorcerer Abramane. When the opera opens, Bactria is in chaos after the death of its king, who has left behind two daughters: Amélite, the presumptive heir, and Erinice. Both are in love with Zoroastre, who is devoted to Amélite. Abramane has taken the opportunity to send Zoroastre into exile. The sorcerer also plots to seize the throne with Erinice, who wants revenge on Zoroastre for rejecting her love. Abramane conjures up demons to capture Amélite.\n\nZoroastre is in exile at the palace of the king of the good genies, Oromasès. Oromasès tells Zoroastre to go and rescue Amélite and destroy the forces of evil. He puts Zoroastre through a magic initiation ritual to prepare him for the task. In the dungeons of the fortress of Bactria, Abramane and Erinice are torturing Amélite to force her to renounce the throne, when Zoroastre suddenly appears. He releases Amélite and destroys the fortress with his magic powers. Amélite is presented as queen to her joyful Bactrian subjects.\n\nNight. Abramane and Erinice quarrel over the disaster that has befallen their plans. Abramane hides Erinice in a cloud. At dawn, Zoroastre, Amélite and the Bactrian people assemble to worship the Supreme Being then celebrate the marriage of Zoroastre and Amélite. As the wedding ceremony takes place, Abramane arrives on a fiery chariot and kidnaps Amélite. Zoroastre prepares his magic spirits for war.\n\nIn the temple of the god Arimane, Abramane receives news that the battle between the spirits of good and evil is going badly for him. He sacrifices to the god and summons up Hate, Vengeance and Despair.\n\nErinice, now repentant, warns Zoroastre of Abramane's plan for a new battle. Abramane appears in the fiery chariot once more and reveals Amélite in chains. He calls on Zoroastre to surrender. Instead, Zoroastre calls on the gods, who strike down Abramane and his evil priests with thunderbolts. The opera ends with rejoicing as Zoroastre and Amélite are crowned king and queen of Bactria.\n\n\n\n\n"}

His name can be translated as \"boundless space treasury\" or \"void store\" as his wisdom is said to be boundless as space itself. He is sometimes known as the twin brother of the \"earth store\" bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha, and is even briefly mentioned in the \"Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva Pūrvapraṇidhāna Sūtra\".\n\nKūkai, the founder of Shingon Buddhism, met a famous monk who is said to have repeatedly chanted a mantra of Ākāśagarbha as a young Buddhist acolyte. Kūkai took a tutorial with him on Kokuzou-Gumonji (a secret doctorine method, 虚空蔵求聞持法). As he chanted the mantra, he experienced a vision whereby Ākāśagarbha told him to go to Tang China to seek understanding of the \"Mahāvairocana Abhisaṃbodhi Sūtra\". Later he would go to China to learn Tangmi from Huiguo, and then go on to found the Shingon sect of esoteric buddhism in Heian Japan.\n\nTwo Mahayana sutras are known to survive in which Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattva is a central figure:\n\nAdditionally, he appears briefly in the final chapter of the \"Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva Pūrvapraṇidhāna Sūtra\", requesting the Buddha preach on the benefits of praising that sutra and of Kṣitigarbha.\n\nThe mantra of Ākāśagarbha is popularly used by Shingon Buddhists, practitioners of Tangmi, and by artists. It is believed to give rise to wisdom and creativity, and dispel ignorance.\n\n\nAnother mantra also exists for Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattva:\n\n\n\n"}
