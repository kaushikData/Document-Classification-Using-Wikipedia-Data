He was a professor from 1856 to 1893. In his later period he belonged to the Dutch radical critics.\n\nLoman was the son of a minister in the Dutch Lutheran church. He started studying theology in 1840 and became a minister in 1846. In 1856 he became a professor at the Lutheran seminary in Amsterdam. Loman gradually lost his eyesight in the beginning of the 1870s, but continued working. From 1877 he also was a theology professor at the University of Amsterdam until his retirement in 1893.\n\nLoman introduced modern theology in the Dutch Lutheran Church. He taught almost all disciplines of theology, but concentrated after 1867 on the New Testament and early Christian literature. He wrote a book about the Muratorian fragment, but published mostly in journals. His opinions mostly agreed with the Tübingen school. When his colleague Allard Pierson in 1878 denied the authenticity of Galatians, Loman wrote a fierce condemnation.\n\nBut after 1880 his views changed. He was an advocate of the Christ myth theory and caused great consternation by a public lecture on 13 December 1881 in the building of the Vrije Gemeente where he stated that Jesus is not a figure of history and that all we know about him is second-century fiction. In his \"Quaestiones Paulinae\" (1882, 1883, 1886) he abandoned Pauline authorship of Galatians. His arguments were that the Pauline epistles are not quoted by Justin Martyr and that the first datable references are by Marcion.\n"}

The organization describes its existence as a reaction to the problem in current Islamic learning, which focuses on \"the foundational principles and the emanating discourses of a particular school of thought as well as the polemics to establish their superiority over those of others.\" \n\nThe institution as a research and educational center aims to facilitate and perpetuate the explanatory and research work on the so-called \"true understanding of Islam.\" One of its main positions articulated by its founder involved the centralization of Islamic ministry in Pakistan to address the way mosques in the country are currently run privately and that anyone can preach without permission or accountability. Ghamidi maintained that this condition promotes extremism and hatred.\n\nThe administration of Al-Mawrid Global is in the hands of its Board of Governors. The administrative system is founded on democratic principles. The President of the institution serves as the academic and intellectual patron, and the Secretary General is entrusted with its administrative affairs. Al-Mawrid Global is a charity registered in Scotland (no. SC044505), and the institution accepts contributions from all those who agree with its objectives.\n\nThe institution has its worldwide presence through its country chapters.\n\nAl-Mawrid is criticized for their progressive stand on various religious issues. Sometimes they are charged with fueling controversial topics, like calling for reform in the infamous Hudood laws. Javed Ghamidi is also referred by some as having involvement in the controversial movie 'Khuda kai liya', which brought the issue of radicalization into the limelight in Pakistan. Local and orthodox scholars often reject this school of thought and their liberal understanding of Islam. Some also refer to them as 'clean shave mullas'.\n\nGhamidi and Al-Mawrid's moderate stance on Islam led to a conflict with the Taliban, which forced Ghamidi to flee his country in 2010. Ghamidi's staff was murdered by the extremist group and Al-Mawrid is now being run through a website and its branches located in Australia, Canada, India, United Kingdom, and the United States. \n\nThe institution publishes two monthly journals.

{"id": "262658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=262658", "title": "Alejandro Jodorowsky", "text": "Alejandro Jodorowsky\n\nAlejandro Jodorowsky Prullansky (; born 17 February 1929) is a Chilean-French filmmaker. Since 1948, Jodorowsky has worked as a novelist, a storyteller, a poet, a playwright, an essayist, a film director and producer, an actor in cinematic and theatre productions, a theatre director, a screenwriter, a film editor, a comics writer, a musician and composer, a philosopher, a puppeteer, a mime, a psychologist and psychoanalyst, a draughtsman, a painter, a sculptor and a spiritual guru.\nBest known for his avant-garde films, he has been \"venerated by cult cinema enthusiasts\" for his work which \"is filled with violently surreal images and a hybrid blend of mysticism and religious provocation\".\n\nBorn to Jewish-Ukrainian parents in Chile, Jodorowsky experienced an unhappy and alienated childhood, and so immersed himself in reading and writing poetry. Dropping out of college, he became involved in theater and in particular mime, working as a clown before founding his own theater troupe, the \"Teatro Mimico\", in 1947. Moving to Paris in the early 1950s, Jodorowsky studied mime under Étienne Decroux before turning to cinema, directing the short film \"Les têtes interverties\" in 1957. From 1960 he divided his time between Paris and Mexico City, in the former becoming a founding member of the anarchistic avant-garde Panic Movement of performance artists. In 1966 he created his first comic strip, \"Anibal 5\", while in 1967 he directed his first feature film, the surrealist \"Fando y Lis\", which caused a huge scandal in Mexico, eventually being banned.\n\nHis next film, the acid western \"El Topo\" (1970), became a hit on the midnight movie circuit in the United States, considered as the first-ever midnight cult film, and garnered high praise from John Lennon, who convinced former Beatles manager Allen Klein to provide Jodorowsky with $1 million to finance his next film. The result was \"The Holy Mountain\" (1973), a surrealist exploration of western esotericism. Disagreements with Klein, however, led to both \"The Holy Mountain\" and \"El Topo\" failing to gain widespread distribution, although both became classics on the underground film circuit.\n\nAfter an aborted attempt at filming Frank Herbert's 1965 science fiction novel \"Dune\", Jodorowsky produced five more films: the family film \"Tusk\" (1980); the surrealist horror \"Santa Sangre\" (1989); the failed blockbuster \"The Rainbow Thief\" (1990); and the first two films in a planned five-film autobiographical series \"The Dance of Reality\" (2013) and \"Endless Poetry\" (2016). During the same period, he wrote a series of science fiction comic books, most notably \"The Incal\" (1980–1989), which has been described as having a claim to be \"the best comic book\" ever written, and also \"The Technopriests\" and \"Metabarons\". He has also written books and regularly lectures on his own spiritual system, which he calls \"psychomagic\" and \"psychoshamanism\" and which borrows from his interests in alchemy, the tarot, Zen Buddhism and shamanism. His son Cristóbal has followed his teachings on psychoshamanism; this work is captured in the feature documentary \"Quantum Men\", directed by Carlos Serrano Azcona.\n\nJodorowsky was born in 1929 in the coastal town of Tocopilla, Chile, to parents who were Jewish immigrants from Yekaterinoslav (now Dnipro), Elisavetgrad (now Kropyvnytskyi) and other cities of the Russian Empire (now Ukraine). His father, Jaime Jodorowsky Groismann, was a merchant, who was largely abusive to his wife Sara Felicidad Prullansky Arcavi, and at one time accused her of flirting with a customer. Angered, he subsequently beat and raped her, getting her pregnant, which led to the birth of Alejandro. Because of this brutal conception, Sara both hated her husband and disliked her son, telling him that \"I cannot love you\" and rarely showing him tenderness. Alejandro also had an elder sister, Raquel Jodorowsky, but disliked her, for he believed that she was selfish, doing \"everything to expel me from the family so that she could be the centre of attention.\" Alongside his dislike for his family, he also held contempt for many of the local people, who viewed him as an outsider because of his status as the son of immigrants, and also for the American mining industrialists who worked locally and treated the Chilean people badly. It was this treatment at the hands of Americans that led to his later condemnation of American imperialism and neo-colonialism in Latin America in several of his films. Nonetheless he liked his local area, and was greatly unhappy when he was forced to leave it aged nine years old, something for which he blamed his father. His family subsequently moved to the city of Santiago, Chile.\n\nHe immersed himself in reading, and also began writing poetry, having his first poem published when he was sixteen years old, alongside associating with such Chilean poets as Nicanor Parra, Stella Díaz Varín and Enrique Lihn. Becoming interested in the political ideology of anarchism, he began attending college, studying psychology and philosophy, but stayed for only two years. After dropping out, and having an interest in theatre and particularly mime, he took up employment as a clown in a circus and began a career as a theatre director. Meanwhile, in 1947 he founded his own theatrical troupe, the Teatro Mimico, which by 1952 had fifty members, and the following year he wrote his first play, \"El Minotaura\" (\"The Minotaur\"). Nonetheless, Jodorowsky felt that there was little for him left in Chile, and so that year he moved to Paris, France.\n\nIt was while in Paris that Jodorowsky began studying mime with Étienne Decroux and joined the troupe of one of Decroux's students, Marcel Marceau. It was with Marceau's troupe that he went on a world tour, and wrote several routines for the group, including \"The Cage\" and \"The Mask Maker\". After this, he returned to theatre directing, working on the music hall comeback of Maurice Chevalier in Paris. In 1957, Jodorowsky turned his hand to filmmaking, creating \"Les têtes interverties\" (\"The Severed Heads\"), a 20-minute adaptation of Thomas Mann's novella. It consisted almost entirely of mime, and told the surreal story of a head-swapping merchant who helps a young man find courtship success. Jodorowsky played the lead role. The director Jean Cocteau admired the film, and wrote an introduction for it. It was considered lost until a print of the film was discovered in 2006.\n\nIn 1960, Jodorowsky moved to Mexico, where he settled down in Mexico City. Nonetheless, he continued to return occasionally to France, on one occasion visiting the Surrealist artist André Breton, but he was disillusioned in that he felt Breton had become somewhat conservative in his old age. Continuing his interest in surrealism, in 1962 he founded the Panic Movement along with Fernando Arrabal and Roland Topor. The movement aimed to go beyond the conventional surrealist ideas by embracing absurdism. Its members refused to take themselves seriously, while laughing at those critics who did. In 1966 he produced his first comic strip, \"Anibal 5\", which was related to the Panic Movement. The following year he created a new feature film, \"Fando y Lis\", loosely based on a play written by Fernando Arrabal, who was working with Jodorowsky on performance art at the time. \"Fando y Lis\" premiered at the 1968 Acapulco Film Festival, where it instigated a riot amongst those objecting to the film's content, and subsequently it was banned in Mexico.\n\nIt was in Mexico City that he encountered Ejo Takata (1928–1997), a Zen Buddhist monk who had studied at the Horyuji and Shofukuji monasteries in Japan before traveling to Mexico via the United States in 1967 to spread Zen. Jodorowsky became a disciple of Takata and offered his own house to be turned into a zendo. Subsequently, Takata attracted other disciples around him, who spent their time in meditation and the study of koans. Eventually, Takata instructed Jodorowsky that he had to learn more about his feminine side, and so he went and befriended the English surrealist Leonora Carrington, who recently had moved to Mexico.\n\nIn 1970, Jodorowsky released the film \"El Topo\", which sometimes is known in English as \"The Mole\", which he had both directed and starred in. An acid western, \"El Topo\" tells the story of a wandering Mexican bandit and gunslinger, El Topo (played by Jodorowsky), who is on a search for spiritual enlightenment, taking his young son along with him. Along the way, he violently confronts a number of other individuals, before finally being killed and being resurrected to live within a community of deformed people who are trapped inside a mountain cave. Describing the work, he stated that \"I ask of film what most North Americans ask of psychedelic drugs. The difference being that when one creates a psychedelic film, he need not create a film that shows the visions of a person who has taken a pill; rather, he needs to manufacture the pill.\" Knowing how \"Fando y Lis\" had caused such a scandal in Mexico, Jodorowsky decided not to release \"El Topo\" there, instead focusing on its release in other countries across the world, including Mexico's northern neighbour, the United States. It was in New York City where the film would play as a \"midnight movie\" for several months at Ben Barenholtz's Elgin Theater. It attracted the attention of rock musician and countercultural figure John Lennon, who thought very highly of it, and convinced the president of The Beatles' company Apple Corps, Allen Klein, to distribute it in the United States.\n\nKlein agreed to give Jodorowsky $1 million to go toward creating his next film. The result was \"The Holy Mountain\", released in 1973. It has been suggested that \"The Holy Mountain\" may have been inspired by René Daumal's Surrealist novel \"Mount Analogue\". \"The Holy Mountain\" was another complex, multi-part story that featured a man credited as \"The Thief\" and equated with Jesus Christ, a mystical alchemist played by Jodorowsky, seven powerful business people representing seven of the planets (Venus and the six planets from Mars to Pluto), a religious training regimen of spiritual rebirth, and a quest to the top of a holy mountain for the secret of immortality. During the completion of \"The Holy Mountain\", Jodorowsky received spiritual training from Oscar Ichazo of the Arica School, who encouraged him to take LSD and guided him through the subsequent psychedelic experience. Around the same time (2 November 1973), Jodorowsky participated in an isolation tank experiment conducted by John Lilly.\n\nShortly thereafter, Allen Klein demanded that Jodorowsky create a film adaptation of Pauline Réage's classic novel of female masochism, \"Story of O\". Klein had promised this adaptation to various investors. Jodorowsky, who had discovered feminism during the filming of \"The Holy Mountain\", refused to make the film, going so far as to leave the country to escape directing duties. In retaliation, Allen Klein made \"El Topo\" and \"The Holy Mountain\", to which he held the rights, completely unavailable to the public for more than 30 years. Jodorowsky frequently decried Klein's actions in interviews.\n\nSoon after the release of \"The Holy Mountain\", Jodorowsky gave a talk at the Teatro Julio Castillo, University of Mexico on the subject of koans (despite the fact that he initially had been booked on the condition that his talk would be about cinematography), at which Ejo Takata appeared. After the talk, Takata gave Jodorowsky his kyosaku, believing that his former student had mastered the art of understanding koans.\n\nIn December 1974, a French consortium led by Jean-Paul Gibon purchased the film rights to Frank Herbert's epic 1965 science fiction novel \"Dune\" and asked Jodorowsky to direct a film version. Jodorowsky planned to cast the Surrealist artist Salvador Dalí, in what would have been his only speaking role as a film actor, in the role of Emperor Shaddam IV. Dalí agreed when Jodorowsky offered to pay him a fee of $100,000 per minute of screen time. He also planned to cast Orson Welles as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen; Welles only agreed when Jodorowsky offered to get his favourite gourmet chef to prepare his meals for him throughout the filming. The book's protagonist, Paul Atreides, was to be played by Jodorowsky's son, Brontis Jodorowsky. The music would be composed by Pink Floyd and Magma. Jodorowsky set up a pre-production unit in Paris consisting of Chris Foss, a British artist who designed covers for science fiction publications, Jean Giraud (Moebius), a French illustrator who created and also wrote and drew for \"Métal Hurlant\" magazine, and H. R. Giger. Frank Herbert travelled to Europe in 1976 to find that $2 million of the $9.5 million budget had already been spent in pre-production, and that Jodorowsky's script would result in a 14-hour movie (\"It was the size of a phonebook\", Herbert later recalled). Jodorowsky took creative liberties with the source material, but Herbert said that he and Jodorowsky had an amicable relationship. The production for the film collapsed when no film studio could be found willing to fund the movie to Jodorowsky's terms. The aborted production was chronicled in the documentary \"Jodorowsky's Dune\". Subsequently, the rights for filming were sold to Dino de Laurentiis, who employed the American filmmaker David Lynch to direct, creating the film \"Dune\" in 1984.\n\nAfter the collapse of the \"Dune\" project, Jodorowsky completely changed course and, in 1980, premiered his children's fable \"Tusk\", shot in India. Taken from Reginald Campbell's novel \"Poo Lorn of the Elephants\", the film explores the soul-mate relationship between a young British woman living in India and a highly prized elephant. The film exhibited little of the director's outlandish visual style and was never given wide release.\n\nIn 1982 Jodorowsky divorced his wife.\n\nIn 1989, Jodorowsky completed the Mexican-Italian production \"Santa Sangre\" (\"Holy Blood\"). The film received limited theatrical distribution, putting Jodorowsky back on the cultural map despite its mixed critical reviews. \"Santa Sangre\" was a surrealistic slasher film with a plot like a mix of Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho\" with Robert Wiene's \"The Hands of Orlac\". It featured a protagonist who, as a child, saw his mother lose both her arms, and as an adult let his own arms act as hers, and so was forced to commit murders at her whim. Several of Jodorowsky's sons were recruited as actors.\n\nHe followed in 1990 with a very different film, \"The Rainbow Thief\". Though it gave Jodorowsky a chance to work with the \"movie stars\" Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif, the executive producer, Alexander Salkind, effectively curtailed most of Jodorowsky's artistic inclinations, threatening to fire him on the spot if anything in the script was changed (Salkind's wife, Berta Domínguez D., wrote the screenplay).\n\nThat same year (1990), Jodorowsky and his family returned to live in France.\n\nIn 1995, Alejandro's son, Teo, died in an accident while his father was busy preparing for a trip to Mexico City to promote his new book. Upon arriving in Mexico City, he gave a lecture at the Julio Castillo Theatre where once again he met Ejo Takata, who at this time had moved into a poor suburb of the city where he had continued to teach meditation and Zen. Takata would die two years later, and Jodorowsky would never get to see his old friend again.\n\nIn 2000, Jodorowsky won the Jack Smith Lifetime Achievement Award from the Chicago Underground Film Festival (CUFF). Jodorowsky attended the festival and his films were shown, including \"El Topo\" and \"The Holy Mountain\", which at the time had grey legal status. According to festival director Bryan Wendorf, it was an open question of whether CUFF would be allowed to show both films, or whether the police would show up and shut the festival down.\n\nUntil 2007, \"Fando y Lis\" and \"Santa Sangre\" were the only Jodorowsky works available on DVD. Neither \"El Topo\" nor \"The Holy Mountain\" were available on videocassette or DVD in the United States or the United Kingdom, due to ownership disputes with distributor Allen Klein. After settlement of the dispute in 2004, however, plans to re-release Jodorowsky's films were announced by ABKCO Films. On 19 January 2007, the website, announced that on 1 May 2007, Anchor Bay released a box set including \"El Topo\", \"The Holy Mountain\", and \"Fando y Lis\". A limited edition of the set includes both the \"El Topo\" and \"The Holy Mountain\" soundtracks. And, in early February 2007, Tartan Video announced its 14 May 2007, release date for the UK \"PAL DVD\" editions of \"El Topo\", \"The Holy Mountain\", and the six-disc box set which, alongside the aforementioned feature films, includes the two soundtrack CDs, as well as separate DVD editions of Jodorowsky's 1968 debut feature \"Fando y Lis\" (with his 1957 short \"La cravate\" a.k.a. \"Les têtes interverties\", included as an extra) and the 1994 feature-length documentary \"La constellation Jodorowsky\". Notably, \"Fando y Lis\" and \"La cravate\" were digitally restored extensively and remastered in London during late 2006, thus providing the perfect complement to the quality restoration work undertaken on \"El Topo\" and \"The Holy Mountain\" in the States by Abkco, and ensuring that the presentation of \"Fando y Lis\" is a significant improvement over the 2001 Fantoma DVD edition. Prior to the availability of these legitimate releases, only inferior quality, optically censored, bootleg copies of both \"El Topo\" and \"The Holy Mountain\" have been circulated on the Internet and on DVD.\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, Jodorowsky attempted to make a sequel to \"El Topo\", called at different times \"The Sons of El Topo\" and \"Abel Cain\", but could not find investors for the project.\n\nIn an interview with \"Premiere Magazine\", Jodorowsky said he intended his next project to be a gangster film called \"King Shot\". In an interview with \"The Guardian\" newspaper in November 2009, however, Jodorowsky revealed that he was unable to find the funds to make \"King Shot\", and instead would be entering preparations on \"Sons of El Topo\", for which he claimed to have signed a contract with \"some Russian producers\".\n\nIn 2010, the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City staged the first American cinema retrospective of Alejandro Jodorowsky entitled \"Blood into Gold: The Cinematic Alchemy of Alejandro Jodorowsky\". Jodorowsky would attend the retrospective and hold a master class on art as a way of transformation. This retrospective would inspire the museum MOMA PS1 to present the exhibition \"Alejandro Jodorowsky: The Holy Mountain\" in 2011.\n\nIn August 2011, Alejandro arrived in a town in Chile where he grew up, also the setting of his autobiography \"The Dance of Reality\", to promote an autobiographical film based upon his book.\n\nOn 31 October 2011, Halloween night, the Museum of Modern Art (New York City) honored Jodorowsky by showing \"The Holy Mountain\". He attended and spoke about his work and life. The next evening, he presented \"El Topo\" at the Walter Reade Theatre at Lincoln Center.\n\nAlejandro has stated that after finishing \"The Dance of Reality\" he was preparing to shoot his long-gestating \"El Topo\" sequel, \"Abel Cain\". By January 2013, Alejandro finished filming on \"The Dance of Reality\" and entered into post-production. Alejandro's son and co-star in the film, Brontis, claimed the film was to be finished by March 2013, and that the film was \"very different than the other films he made\". On 23 April, it was announced that the film would have its world premiere at the Filmfestival in Cannes. coinciding with \"The Dance of Reality\" premiered alongside the documentary film \"Jodorowsky's Dune\", which premiered in May 2013 at the Cannes Film Festival, creating a \"Jodorowsky double bill\".\n\nIn 2015, Jodorowsky began a new film entitled \"Endless Poetry\", the sequel to his last \"auto-biopic\", \"The Dance of Reality\". His Paris-based production company, Satori Films, launched two successful crowdfunding campaigns to finance the film. The Indiegogo campaign has been left open indefinitely, receiving donations from fans and movie-goers in support of the independent production. The Film was shot between June and August 2015, in the streets of Matucana in Santiago, Chile, where Jodorowsky lived for a period in his life. The film portrays his young adulthood in Santiago, years during which he became a core member of the Chilean poetic avant-garde alongside artists such as like Hugo Marín, Gustavo Becerra, Enrique Lihn, Stella Díaz Varín, Nicanor Parra and others. Jodorowsky's son, Adan Jodorowsky, plays him as an adult. Jeremias Herskovitz, from \"The Dance of Reality\", portrays Jodorowsky as a teenager. The film premiered in the Directors' Fortnight section of the Cannes Film Festival on 14 May 2016. Variety's review was overwhelmingly positive, calling it \"...the most accessible movie he has ever made, and it may also be the best.\"\n\nDuring an interview at the Cannes Film Festival in 2016, Jodorowsky announced his plans to finally make \"The Son of El Topo\" as soon as financial backing is obtained.\n\nJodorowsky is a weekly contributor of \"good news\" to the nightly \"author newsreport\" of his friend, Fernando Sánchez-Dragó in Telemadrid.\n\nHe also released a 12\" vinyl with the Original Soundtrack of Zarathustra (Discos Tizoc, Mexico, 1970)\n\nHe has cited the filmmaker Federico Fellini as his primary cinematic influence; other artistic influences included George Gurdjieff, Antonin Artaud, and Luis Buñuel. He has been described as an influence on such figures as Marilyn Manson, David Lynch, Nicolas Winding Refn, Jan Kounen, Dennis Hopper, and Kanye West.\n\nJodorowsky started his comic career in Mexico with the creation of \"Anibal 5\" series in mid-1966 with illustrations by Manuel Moro. He also drew his own comic strip in the weekly series \"Fabulas pánicas\" that appeared in the Mexican newspaper, \"El Heraldo de México\". He also wrote original stories for at least two or three other comic books in Mexico during those days: \"Los insoportables Borbolla\" was one of them. After his fourth film, \"Tusk\", he started \"The Incal\", with Jean Giraud (Mœbius). This graphic novel has its roots deep in the tarot and its symbols, e.g., the protagonist of \"The Incal\", John Difool, is linked to the Fool card. \"The Incal\" (which would branch off into a prequel and sequel) forms the first in a sequence of several science fiction comic book series, all set in the same space opera Jodoverse (or \"Metabarons Universe\") published by Humanoids Publishing.\n\nComic books set in this milieu are Incal (trilogy: \"Before the Incal/ Incal/ Final Incal\"), Metabarons (trilogy: \"Castaka/ The Caste of the Metabarons/ Weapons of the Metabaron\"), and \"The Technopriests\" and also a RPG adaptation, \"The Metabarons Roleplaying Game\". Many ideas and concepts derived from Jodorowsky's planned adaptation of \"Dune\" (which he would have only loosely based upon Frank Herbert's original novel) are featured in this universe.\n\nMœbius and Jodorowsky sued Luc Besson, director of \"The Fifth Element\", claiming that the 1997 film borrowed graphic and story elements from \"The Incal\", but they lost their case. The suit was plagued by ambiguity since Mœbius had willingly participated in the creation of the film, having been hired by Besson as a contributing artist, but had done so without gaining the approval of \"Incal\" co-creator Jodorowsky, whose services Besson did not call upon. For more than a decade, Jodorowsky pressured his publisher Les Humanoïdes Associés to sue Luc Besson for plagiarism, but the publisher refused, fearing the inevitability of the final outcome. In a 2002 interview with the Danish comic book magazine \"Strip!\", Jodorowsky stated that he considered it an honour that somebody stole his ideas.\n\nOther comics by Jodorowsky include the Western \"Bouncer\" illustrated by Francois Boucq, \"Juan Solo\" (\"Son of the Gun\"), and \"Le Lama blanc\" (\"The White Lama\"), the later were illustrated by Georges Bess.\n\n\"Le Cœur couronné\" (\"The Crowned Heart\", translated into English as \"The Madwoman of the Sacred Heart\"), a racy satire on religion set in contemporary times, won Jodorowsky and his collaborator, Jean Giraud, the 2001 Haxtur Award for Best Long Strip. He is currently working on a new graphic novel for the U.S. market.\n\nJodorowsky's comic book work also appears in \"Taboo\" volume 4 (ed. Stephen R. Bissette), which features an interview with the director, designs for his version of Frank Herbert's \"Dune\", comic storyboards for \"El Topo\", and a collaboration with Moebius with the illustrated \"Eyes of the Cat\".\n\nJodorowsky collaborated with Milo Manara in \"Borgia\" (2006), a graphic novel about the history of the House of Borgia.\n\nJodorowsky spent almost a decade reconstructing the original form of the Tarot de Marseille. From this work he moved into more therapeutic work in three areas: psychomagic, psychogenealogy and initiatic massage. Psychomagic aims to heal psychological wounds suffered in life. This therapy is based on the belief that the performance of certain acts can directly act upon the unconscious mind, releasing it from a series of traumas, some of which practitioners of the therapy believe are passed down from generation to generation. Psychogenealogy includes the studying of the patient's personality and family tree in order to best address their specific sources. It is similar, in its phenomenological approach to genealogy, to the Constellations pioneered by Bert Hellinger.\n\nJodorowsky has several books on his therapeutic methods, including \"Psicomagia: La trampa sagrada\" (\"Psychomagic: The Sacred Trap\") and his autobiography, \"La danza de la realidad\" (\"The Dance of Reality\"), which he was filming as a feature-length film in March 2012. To date he has published more than 23 novels and philosophical treatises, along with dozens of articles and interviews. His books are widely read in Spanish and French, but are for the most part unknown to English-speaking audiences.\n\nThroughout his career, Jodorowsky has gained a reputation as a philosopher and scholar who presents the teachings of religion, psychology, and spiritual masters, by molding them into imaginative endeavors. All of his enterprises integrate an artistic approach. Currently, Jodorowsky dedicates much of his time to lecturing about his work.\n\nFor a quarter of a century, Jodorowsky held classes and lectures for free, in cafés and universities all over the city of Paris. Typically, such courses or talks would begin on Wednesday evenings as tarot divination lessons, and would culminate in an hour long conference, also free, where at times hundreds of attendees would be treated to live demonstrations of a psychological \"arbre généalogique\" (\"tree of genealogy\") involving volunteers from the audience. In these conferences, Jodorowsky would pave the way to building a strong base of students of his philosophy, which deals with understanding the unconscious as the \"over-self\", composed of many generations of family relatives, living or deceased, acting on the psyche, well into adult lives, and causing compulsions. Of all his work, Jodorowsky considers these activities to be the most important of his life. Though such activities only take place in the insular world of Parisian cafés, he has devoted thousands of hours of his life to teaching and helping people \"become more conscious,\" as he puts it.\n\nSince 2011 these talks have dwindled to once a month and take place at the \"Librairie Les Cent Ciels\" in Paris.\n\nJodorowsky's first wife was the actress Valérie Trumblay. He is currently married to the artist and costume designer Pascale Montandon.\n\nHe has four sons: Brontis Jodorowsky, an actor (he worked with his father in \"El Topo\" and \"The Dance of Reality\"); Teo (died of overdose in 1995, at the age of 24; he played a role in \"Santa Sangre\"); Cristóbal, a psychoshaman and an actor (interpreter in \"Santa Sangre\" and the main character in the shamanic documentary \"Quantum Men\"); and Adan Jodorowsky, the youngest, a musician known by his stage name of Adanowsky. He also has a daughter, Eugenia.\n\nOn his religious views, Jodorowsky has called himself an \"atheist mystic\".\n\nHe does not drink or smoke, and has stated that he does not eat red meat and poultry because he \"does not like corpses\", basing his diet on vegetables, fruits, cereals and occasionally marine products.\n\nIn 2005, Jodorowsky officiated at the wedding of Marilyn Manson and Dita Von Teese.\n\nFans included musicians Peter Gabriel, Cedric Bixler-Zavala and Omar Rodríguez-López of The Mars Volta, Brann Dailor of Mastodon, Luke Steele and Nick Littlemore (of the pop-duo Empire of the Sun). Wes Borland, guitarist of Limp Bizkit, said that the film \"Holy Mountain\" was a big influence on him, especially as a visual artist, and that the concept album \"Lotus Island\" of his band Black Light Burns was a tribute to it.\n\nJodorowsky was interviewed by Daniel Pinchbeck for the Franco-German television show \"Durch die Nacht mit …\" on the TV station Arte, in a very personal discussion, spending a night together in France, continuing the interview in different locations such as a park and a hotel.\n\nDanish director Nicolas Winding Refn thanks Alejandro Jodorowsky in the ending titles of his 2011 film \"Drive\" and dedicated to Jodorowsky his 2013 Thai crime thriller, \"Only God Forgives\". Jodorowsky also appeared in the documentary \"My Life Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn\", directed by Refn's wife Liv, giving the couple a tarot reading.\n\nAlejandro Jodorowsky made a thorough statement on his Facebook account on June 26, 2017, in response to the question: \"Did you rape an actress during the filming of\" El Topo?\n\nThe following excerpts are from said statement:\n\nWhere did [the people claiming that I raped Mara Lorenzio on the set of \"El Topo\" in front of the camera] find reports of this alleged incident that would have happened in 1969?\n\nIt’s very possible that they read some of the interviews I did in the United States or England back then. I produced \"El Topo\" independently. When I told the Mexican film industry that I was going to travel to New York to sell \"El Topo\", they made fun of me. “You’re crazy, only Emilio Fernandez ('El Indio') has ever managed to release a movie there and that’s why there is a statue of him. No Mexican film has ever crossed the cactus wall.” In the North American cinematographic environment of the time, Mexican cinema was despised. Hollywood dominated everything.\n\nI had to break through using the only tool I had: shock through scandalous statements. This is how I did it: I dressed up as the mystical bandit character [the titular El Topo], I introduced myself in the interviews with a beard, a mane and a black leather suit, and I said things that purposefully shocked the interviewers. “I am an anti-feminist, I hate women. I hate cats. I’ve eaten human meat tacos with Diego Rivera. \"El Topo\" is a film where things really happened: that scene of rape is a real rape! I killed the animals (that in reality I had purchased dead from a local zoo) with a fork I sharpened myself!” These aggressive, meant to be humorous declarations conquered the era’s young public who were against the establishment and affected by the Vietnam war. This is how I managed to get \"El Topo\" to be noticed and seen, and, thanks to the openly proclaimed admiration of John Lennon and Yoko Ono, my film became a cult classic. Half a century has passed and it continues to be screened and discussed.\n\nJodorowsky also offered details in that same statement on the filming of the so-called “rape scene”:\n\nFilming a scene like this is not achieved with just a cameraman, two actors and an expanse of sand. Cinema is the most costly art because a large number of technicians and artists are required to execute it. First of all, you needed a group of workers to clean a hundred square meters of desert with rakes because of dangerous snakes and spiders that were hidden in the sand. They remained for the duration of the filming, at the ready, to intervene if necessary. There was also a group of makeup artists, hairdressers and dressmakers in charge of costumes.\n\n[In the movie,] El Topo rips apart the woman’s dress in a take that lasts 10 seconds.\nIt is followed by another take of El Topo [doing the same], but from a different angle. Filming stopped for half an hour or so for the technicians to change the reflectors. That is to say that in order to shoot an action sequence that does not even last more than three minutes, several hours were needed. And it wasn’t just a single cameraman, but two cameras, each with one operator and four assistants. A total of 10 camera people. Added to this were crewmen placing rails where the camera slid, handling the counterweights of a crane, holding silver reflector cards so that each face is well-lit. There was also the assistant director, the group of set decorators, other actors, etc. A big crowd that the audience does not see. In addition, there were people holding the individual umbrellas protecting the actors from the sun, others that delivered water and food, etc.\n\nHow could I have possibly assaulted the actress in front of such a large assembly of people?   \nAt the slightest hint of any actual violence, a group of men and women would have thrown themselves at me and immobilized me. The actress would have also been defending herself, howling, scratching. And I, vile satyr, would have ended up persecuted, tried and imprisoned.\n\nIn regard to the making of \"El Topo\", Jodorowsky stated in the early 1970s:\n\nWhen I wanted to do the rape scene, I explained to [Mara Lorenzio] that I was going to hit her and rape her. There was no emotional relationship between us, because I had put a clause in all the women's contracts stating that they would not make love with the director. We had never talked to each other. I knew nothing about her. We went to the desert with two other people: the photographer and a technician. No one else. I said, 'I'm not going to rehearse. There will be only one take because it will be impossible to repeat. Roll the cameras only when I signal you to.' Then I told her, 'Pain does not hurt. Hit me.' And she hit me. I said, 'Harder.' And she started to hit me very hard, hard enough to break a rib...I ached for a week. After she had hit me long enough and hard enough to tire her, I said, 'Now it's my turn. Roll the cameras.' And I really...I really...I really raped her. And she screamed ... Then she told me that she had been raped before. You see, for me the character is frigid until El Topo rapes her. And she has an orgasm. That's why I show a stone phallus in that scene ... which spouts water. She has an orgasm. She accepts the male sex. And that's what happened to Mara in reality. She really had that problem. Fantastic scene. A very, very strong scene.\n\nIn the documentary \"Jodorowsky's Dune\", Jodorowsky states:\n\nIt's different. It was my Dune. When you make a picture, you must not respect the novel. It's like you get married, no? You go with the wife, white, the woman is white. You take the woman, if you respect the woman, you will never have child. You need to open the costume and to… to rape the bride. And then you will have your picture. I was raping Frank Herbert, raping, like this! But with love, with love.\n\nAs a result of these statements, Jodorowsky has been criticised. Matt Brown of Screen Anarchy wrote that \"it's easier to wall off a certain type of criminality behind the buffer of time—sure, Alejandro Jodorowsky is on the record in his book on the making of the film as having raped Mara Lorenzo while making El Topo—though he later denied it—but nowadays he's just that hilarious old kook from Jodorowsky's Dune!\" Emily Asher-Perrin of Tor.com called Jodorowsky \"an artist who condones rape as a means to an end for the purpose of creating art. A man who seems to believe that rape is something that women 'need' if they can't accept male sexual power on their own\". Sady Doyle of \"Elle\" wrote that Jodorowsky \"has been teasing the idea of an unsimulated rape scene in his cult classic film \"El Topo\" for decades ... though he's elsewhere described the unsimulated sex in that scene as consensual\", and went on to state that the quote \"has not endangered his status as an avant-garde icon\".\n\n\n"}

The title \"almoner\" has to some extent fallen out of use in English, but its equivalents in other languages are often used for many pastoral functions exercised by chaplains or pastors. The word derives from the ' (alms), via the popular Latin '.\n\nChristians have historically been encouraged to donate one tenth of their income as charity to the poor and the first deacons mentioned in Acts 6:1–4 dealt with the distribution of the charity of the early Christian churches to needy members. Popes, Bishops, and Christian monarchs and organisations have since employed their own officers to organise their donations to the poor and needy. Such donations were referred to as alms and the officers as almoners and the position was one of considerable status.\n\nThe Papal almoner, formally titled the \"Almoner of His Holiness\", is a member of the papal household with responsibility for performing works of charity on behalf of the pope. He is one of a small number of Vatican officials who continue in office when a pope dies or resigns. Since late 2013, the holder of the title is Cardinal Konrad Krajewski.\n\nToday in the United Kingdom, the office of Lord High Almoner still exists in the Royal Household and holder of the office is responsible amongst other things for organising the ceremony of the Queen's annual distribution of Maundy money. Associated with the Almoner's office is the Grand Almoner, an hereditary title in the hands of the Marquess of Exeter.\n\nThe position of almoner within the French royal household was that of Grand Almoner of France (\"Grand aumônier de France\") created by King Francis I.\n\nThe almoner also remains an active and important office in the livery companies of the City of London. In Masonic Lodges, the almoner's duty is to oversee the needs of the Brethren within his Lodge. He is the contact for charity and looks after the welfare of the members, including visits to the sick, aged and infirm.\n\nThe title almoner was also used for a hospital official who interviews prospective patients to qualify them as indigent. It was later applied to the officials who were responsible for patient welfare and after-care. This position evolved into the modern profession of medical social work.\n\n"}

This uprising was sparked by the fact that the Ani-Kutani had become corrupt and conducted sexual improprieties. The ancient structure of Cherokee Society and the Cherokee Clans were closely linked to the beliefs of the Ani-Kutani.\n\nThe Ani-Kutani might be connected to the Longhair Clan, or Anigilohi (ᎠᏂᎩᎶᎯ), or \"fire priests\" that existed in historic times. They were either a clerical class and/or a hereditary clan. \"Aní-\" is a prefix referring to a group of individuals, while the meaning of \"kutáni\" is unknown.\n\nFrom the writings of James Mooney, \"Myths of the Cherokee,\" section 108 \"The Massacre of the Ani'-Kuta'ni. \"Among other perishing traditions is that relating to the Ani'Kuta'ni or Ani'Kwata'ni, concerning whom the modern Cherokee know so little that their very identity is now a matter of dispute, a few holding that they were an ancient people who preceded the Cherokee and built the mounds, while others, with more authority, claim that they were a clan or society in the tribe and were destroyed long ago by pestilence or other calamity.\"\n\nThe Ani'Kuta'ni most likely supervised all religious ceremonies among the Cherokee. They may have been moundbuilders who lived in the Appalachian lands in which Cherokees settled.\n\nMooney's informants described this group as much despised, corrupt abusers of their religious power (Mooney compared this power position to be on par with the Brahmins of India). Mooney stated they were so completely wiped out that even at the mention of them by Principal Chief John Ross and Dr J. B. Evans in 1866, the story and legend were stated to be a century old and must have (due to the dimness of detail) been even older than a century even then.\n\n"}

{"id": "44242611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44242611", "title": "Baal Shem", "text": "Baal Shem\n\nBaal Shem (, Hebrew: בַּעַל שֵׁם, pl. Baalei Shem) in Hebrew meaning \"Master of the Name\", refers to a historical Jewish occupation of certain kabbalistic rabbis with knowledge of using names of God in Judaism for practical kabbalah healing, miracles, exorcism and blessing.\n\nThe unofficial title was given by others who recognised or benefited from the Baal Shem's ability to perform wondrous deeds, and emerged in the Middle Ages, continuing until the early modern era. Baal Shem were seen as miracle workers who could bring about cures and healing, as well having mystical powers to foresee or interpret events and personalities. They were considered to have a \"direct line\" to Heaven, evoking God's mercies and compassion on suffering human beings. In Jewish society, the practical theurgic role of Baalei Shem among the common folk was a mystical institution, contrasted with the more theosophical and ecstatic Kabbalistic study circles, which were isolated from the populace. The Baal Shem, the communal Maggid preacher and the Mokhiakh ((מוֹכִיחַ/preacher) of penitence were seen as lower level unofficial Jewish intelligentsia, below contract Rabbis and study Kabbalists.\n\nThe activity of Baalei Shem among the community, as well as the influence of kabbalistic ideas, contributed to the popular belief in Tzadikim Nistarim (Concealed Righteous). Hasidic tradition records Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm in the 16th century, founding a \"Nistarim\" mystical brotherhood to offer physical and spiritual encouragement to the Jewish populace, making him the first Baal Shem, and from which movement Hasidism later emerged.\n\nA few people received the title of \"Baal Shem\" among Eastern and Central European Ashkenazi Jewry. The name is most well known in reference to the founder of Hasidic Judaism, the \"Baal Shem Tov\" (\"Besht\" – \"Master of the Good Name\") – Israel ben Eliezer (1698–1760) in Ukraine. However, this is misleading. The Baal Shem Tov started public life as a traditional \"Baal Shem\", but with his teachings of Hasidism, introduced a new way into mystical thought and practice. His role is distinguished from other, predominantly earlier, Baal Shem by the addition of \"Tov – Good\" to his title. Hasidism popularised esoteric Kabbalah into a social mysticism movement. The new mystical role of the Hasidic Tzadik leader replaced \"Baal Shem\" activity among the populace, combining Kabbalist and Maggid, and replacing practical kabbalah with the Tzadik's divine intercession. The 1814–15 \"Praises of the Besht\" sets the Baal Shem Tov's teaching circle against his remaining occupation as travelling Baal Shem.\n\nThe \"Name\" referred to in \"Master of the Name\" is the most holy Four-Letter Name of God or Tetragrammaton. In Jewish tradition, this Name was pronounced only by the High Priest on Yom Kippur. With the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans in the year 70 CE, the true pronunciation was presumably lost. (Jews today do not pronounce the Name out loud and substitute another Hebrew word, usually Adonai, in prayers and texts.) In some accounts, a Baal Shem was believed to have rediscovered the true pronunciation, perhaps during deep meditation, and could use it in magical ways to work miracles. Some stories say he pronounced it out loud, and others say he visualized the Name in his mind. He also used the names of angels in such a way.\n\nThere are two differentiated streams in Kabbalah, that leading Kabbalists separated over concerns of illegitimate use of Practical Kabbalah:\nThe leading Kabbalist Isaac Luria (1534–1572) forbade people of his time to use Practical Kabbalah. As the Temple in Jerusalem is not standing, and no one possesses the ashes of the Red Heifer, people are unable to become pure. Without those things, he said, Practical Kabbalah is very damaging. Yitzchak Ginsburgh describes the connection of Jewish amulets to Practical Kabbalah:\n\nAmulets are on the border between Practical Kabbalah and an external manifestation of Kabbalah, such as name calculation. There is a source for amulets in the Torah. When a great sage writes Holy Names, without pronouncing them, on parchment and puts it into a container which is worn by the recipient, it can possess healing and spiritual powers. At the beginning of the Baal Shem Tov's life, since he was a healer, he used amulets. Sometimes the amulet works because of the faith of the recipient in the spiritual power of the amulet. At the end of his life, the Baal Shem Tov never wrote the Names of God, only his own signature, Yisrael ben Sara or Yisrael ben Eliezer. This was the ultimate amulet given by the Ba'al Shem Tov.\n\nThe Sages teach us that whoever receives a coin from the hands of Job (a tzadik) receives a blessing. This is the source in the Talmud that receiving a coin from a great tzaddik brings with it a blessing. Thus we see that there are amulets that are permissible. The determining factor is the righteousness and intentions of the person giving the amulet.\n\nA rare group of people have been recorded as holding the title of Baal Shem. The first recorded person to receive the title was Eliyahu of Chelm.\n\nOther \"Baalei Shem\" (besides the above) include:\n\n\nThe name \"Baal Shem\" mainly survives in Jewish surnames of people descending from \"Ba'ale Shem\" such as \"Balshem\", \"Balshemnik\" and \"Bolshemennikov\".\n\nIn recent years, some new age Jewish groups have revived the term as referring to the Jewish equivalent of a shaman or folk healer.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "75961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75961", "title": "Beeldenstorm", "text": "Beeldenstorm\n\nBeeldenstorm in Dutch, roughly translatable to \"statue storm\", or Bildersturm in German (\"image/statue storm\"), also the Great Iconoclasm or Iconoclastic Fury, is a term used for outbreaks of destruction of religious images that occurred in Europe in the 16th century. During these spates of iconoclasm, Catholic art and many forms of church fittings and decoration were destroyed in unofficial or mob actions by Calvinist Protestant crowds as part of the Protestant Reformation. Most of the destruction was of art in churches and public places.\n\nThe Dutch term usually specifically refers to the wave of disorderly attacks in the summer of 1566 that spread rapidly through the Low Countries from south to north. Similar outbreaks of iconoclasm took place in other parts of Europe, especially in Switzerland and the Holy Roman Empire in the period between 1522 and 1566, notably Zürich (in 1523), Copenhagen (1530), Münster (1534), Geneva (1535), and Augsburg (1537).\n\nIn England there was both government-sponsored removal of images and also spontaneous attacks from 1535 onwards, and in Scotland from 1559. In France there were several outbreaks as part of the French Wars of Religion from 1560 onwards.\n\nIn France unofficial episodes of large scale destruction of art in churches by Huguenot Calvinists had begun in 1560; unlike in the Low Countries they were often physically resisted and repulsed by Roman Catholic crowds, but were to continue throughout the French Wars of Religion. In Anglican England much destruction had already taken place in an organized fashion under orders from the government, while in Northern Europe, groups of Calvinists marched through churches and removed images, a move which \"provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs\" in Germany and \"antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox\" in the Baltic region.\n\nIn Germany, Switzerland and England, conversion to Protestantism had been enforced on the whole population at the level of a city, principality or kingdom, with varying degrees of discrimination, persecution or expulsion applied to those who insisted on remaining Roman Catholic. The Low Countries, Flanders, Brabant and Holland, were part of the inheritance of Philip II of Spain, who was a devout Catholic and self-proclaimed protector of the Counter-Reformation, and suppressed Protestantism through his Governor-general or Regent, Margaret of Parma the illegitimate daughter of Emperor Charles V, who was herself more willing to compromise. Although Protestants so far represented only a relatively small proportion of the Netherlandish population, but including disproportionate numbers from the nobility and upper bourgeoisie, the Catholic Church had evidently lost the loyalty of the population, and traditional Catholic anti-clericalism was now dominant.\n\nThe region affected was perhaps the richest in Europe, but still seethed with economic discontent among parts of the population, and had suffered a poor harvest and hard winter. However, recent historians are generally less inclined to see the movement as prompted by these factors than was the case a few decades ago.\nThe Beeldenstorm grew out of a turn in the behaviour of Low Country Protestants starting around 1560, who became increasingly open in their religion, despite penal sanctions. Catholic preachers were interrupted in sermons, and raids were organized to rescue Protestant prisoners from jail, who then often fled into exile in France or England. Protestant views were spread by a large movement of \"field sermons\" or open-air sermons () held outside towns, and therefore out of the jurisdiction of the town authorities. The first took place on the \"Cloostervelt\" near Hondschoote, in what is now the arrondissement of Dunkirk in French Flanders, very close to where the attacks later began, and the first one to be armed against disruption was held near Boeschepe on July 12, 1562, two months after religious war had broken out again over the (then) French border just nearby.\n\nThese open-air sermons, mostly by Anabaptist or Mennonite preachers, spread through the country, attracting huge crowds, though not necessarily of those leaning to Protestantism, and in many places immediately preceded the iconoclastic attacks of August 1566. Prosecutions for heresy continued, especially in the south, although they were erratic, and in some places clergy of clearly heretical views were appointed to churches. By 1565 the authorities seem to have realized that persecution was not the answer, and the level of prosecutions slackened, and the Protestants became increasingly confident in the open. A letter of July 22, 1566, from local officials to the Regent, warned that \"the scandalous pillage of churches, monasteries and abbeys\" was imminent.\n\nOn August 10, 1566, the feast-day of Saint Lawrence, at the end of the pilgrimage from Hondschoote to Steenvoorde, the chapel of the \"Sint-Laurensklooster\" was defaced by a crowd who invaded the building. It has been suggested that the rioters connected the saint especially with Philip II, whose monastery palace of the Escorial near Madrid was dedicated to Lawrence, and was just nearing completion in 1566. Iconoclastic attacks spread rapidly northwards and resulted in the destruction of not only images but all sorts of decoration and fittings in churches and other church or clergy property. However, there was relatively little loss of life, unlike similar outbreaks in France, where the clergy were often killed, and some iconoclasts too.\n\nThe attacks reached the commercial centre of the Low Countries, Antwerp, on August 20, and on August 22 Ghent, where the cathedral, eight churches, twenty-five monasteries and convents, ten hospitals and seven chapels were wrecked. From there, it further spread east and north, reaching Amsterdam, then a much smaller town, by August 23, and continuing in the far north and east into October, although the main towns were mostly attacked in August. Valenciennes (\"Valencijn\" on the map) was the most southerly town attacked. In the east, Maastricht on September 20 and Venlo on October 5 saw attacks, but generally the outbreaks were restricted to more westerly and northern areas. Over 400 churches were attacked in Flanders alone.\n\nThe eye-witness Richard Clough, a Welsh Protestant merchant then in Antwerp, saw: \"all the churches, chapels and houses of religion utterly defaced, and no kind of thing left whole within them, but broken and utterly destroyed, being done after such order and by so few folks that it is to be marvelled at.\" The Church of Our Lady in Antwerp, later made the cathedral (illustrated at top): \"looked like a hell, with above 10,000 torches burning, and such a noise as if heaven and earth had got together, with falling of images and beating down of costly works, such sort that the spoil was so great that a man could not well pass through the church. So that in fine [short], I cannot write you in x sheets of paper the strange sight I saw there, organs and all destroyed.\"\n\nNicolas Sander, an English Catholic exile who was a professor of theology at Louvain, described the destruction in the same church:\n... these fresh followers of this new preaching threw down the graven [sculpted] and defaced the painted images, not only of Our Lady but of all others in the town. They tore the curtains, dashed in pieces the carved work of brass and stone, brake the altars, spoilt the clothes and corporesses, wrested the irons, conveyed away or brake the chalices and vestiments, pulled up the brass of the gravestones, not sparing the glass and seats which were made about the pillars of the church for men to sit in. ... the Blessed Sacrament of the altar ... they trod under their feet and (horrible it is to say!) shed their stinking piss upon it ... these false bretheren burned and rent not only all kind of Church books, but, moreover, destroyed whole libraries of books of all sciences and tongues, yea the Holy Scriptures and the ancient fathers, and tore in pieces the maps and charts of the descriptions of countries.\nSuch details are corroborated by many other sources. Accounts of the actions of the iconoclasts from eyewitnesses and the records of the later trials of many of them make it clear that there was often a considerable element of carnival to the outbreaks, with much mockery of the images and fittings such as fonts recorded as the iconoclasts went about their work. Alcohol features largely in very many accounts, perhaps in some cases because in Netherlandish law being drunk could be regarded as a mitigating factor in criminal sentencing.\n\nThe destruction frequently included ransacking the priest's house, and sometimes private houses suspected of sheltering church goods. There was much looting of common household goods from clergy houses and monasteries, and some street robberies of women's jewellery by the crowd; after the images were smashed and the property occupied, \"men fed their stomachs in a carnivalesque indulgence of beer, bread, butter and cheese, while women carted off provisions for the kitchen or bedroom\".\n\nThere are many accounts of rituals of inversion, in which the church sometimes stood for the whole social order. Children sometimes participated enthusiastically, and street games afterwards became play battles between \"papists\" and \"beggars\". One child was killed in Amsterdam by a stone thrown in such a game. Elsewhere the iconoclasts seemed to treat their actions as a job of work; in one city the group waited for the bell rung to mark the start of the working day before beginning their work. The tombs and memorial inscriptions of the patriciate and nobility, and in some cases royalty, were defaced or destroyed in several places, although secular public buildings such as town halls, and the palaces of the nobility, were not attacked. In Ghent, on the one hand the memorial in a church to Charles V's sister Isabel (and so Philip's aunt) was carefully left alone, but a statue in the street of Charles V and the Virgin was destroyed.\n\nThe actions were controversial among Protestants, some of whom implausibly tried to blame Catholic agent provocateurs, as it became clear that \"the more popular elements of the dissident movement were out of control\". Protestant ministers and activists returning from exile in England and elsewhere played a significant role, and individual wealthy Protestants were widely suspected of hiring men to do the work in some places, especially Antwerp.\n\nIn some rural areas gangs of iconoclasts moved across country between village churches and monasteries for several days. Elsewhere there were large crowds involved, sometimes locals, and sometimes from outside the area. In some places the nobility gave assistance, ordering the clearing of churches on their estates. Local magistracies were often opposed, but ineffective in stopping the destruction. In many towns the archer's guild, who had a function in controlling public order, took no steps against the crowds.\n\nIn 1566, unlike the situation after the Eighty Years War and today, Protestantism in the Low Countries was mainly concentrated in the south (roughly modern Belgium), and much weaker in the north (roughly now the Netherlands), and iconoclasm in the north began later, after news of the events in Antwerp was received, and was more successfully resisted by local authorities in some towns, although still succeeding in most. Once again individually socially prominent laymen often took the lead. In many places there were, or were later said to have been, false claims of official commissions from some local authority to perform the actions, and by the end of the outbreak some northern towns removed images by order of the local authority, presumably to prevent the disorder that would accompany a mob action.\n\nAnalysis of the records of the later trials show a wide range of occupations, covering craftsmen and small tradespeople, especially in the textile trade, and also a variety of church employees, at a fairly low level. Where wealth and property are recorded, it is \"modest at best\".\n\nFollowing the 1566 attacks in Antwerp there was a further period of iconoclasm there in 1581, after a Calvinist city council was elected and purged the city's clergy and guilds of Catholic office-holders. This is known as the \"quiet\" or \"stille\" beeldenstorm, as the removal of images was carried out by the institutions they belonged to, the council itself, churches and the guilds. Some images were sold rather than destroyed, but most seem to have been lost. By the summer of 1584 Antwerp was besieged by the Duke of Parma's Spanish army, falling a year later.\n\nRarely was any thought given to the artistic heritage of these cities in 1566, though families were sometimes able to protect the church monuments of their ancestors, and in Delft the syndics of the painters' Guild of Saint Luke were able to rescue the altarpiece by Maarten van Heemskerck, which the guild had commissioned only 15 years earlier.\n\nThe van Eycks' Ghent Altarpiece, then as now famous as a supreme example of Early Netherlandish painting and already a major tourist attraction, just restored in 1550, was saved by dismantling it and hiding it in the cathedral tower. A first attack on August 19 was deterred by a small number of guards. When a larger attack was made at night two days later the iconoclasts had provided themselves with a tree trunk as a battering ram, and succeeded in breaking through the doors.\n\nBy then the panels had been removed from the frame and hidden, with the guards, on the narrow spiral staircase up the tower, with a locked door at ground level. They were not detected and the crowd left after destroying what else they could find. The panels were then moved to the town hall, and only returned to view in 1569, by which time the elaborate frame had disappeared.\n\nDespite militia guards, two of the three main churches in Leiden were attacked; in the Pieterskerk the choirbooks and altarpiece by Lucas van Leyden were preserved. In the Oude Kerk in Amsterdam an altarpiece with a central panel by Jan van Scorel and side panels painted on both sides by Maarten van Heemskerck was lost. The most important works of several painters, especially those like Pieter Aertsen who worked in Antwerp, were all destroyed, leading to a somewhat distorted view of the art history of the period. An altarpiece in Culemborg had been commissioned in 1557 from the painter Jan Dey, was then destroyed in 1566 and in 1570 recommissioned from Dey, apparently as a copy of the first. However the new work was only in place for five years before it was removed when the town went officially Calvinist.\n\nOn August 23, Margaret of Parma, the Habsburg Regent or Governor-general, whose capital of Brussels was unaffected by the movement, agreed to an \"Accord\" with the group of aristocratic Protestant leaders known as the \"Compromise\" or \"Geuzen\" (\"Beggars\"), by which freedom of religion was granted, in exchange for allowing Catholics to worship unmolested and an end to the violence. Instead, \"the outbreak of the iconoclastic fury began an almost uninterrupted series of skirmishes, campaigns, plunder, pirate-raids, and other acts of violence. Not all areas suffered violence at the same time or to the same extent, but practically none remained unscathed.\"\n\nMany elite Protestants were now alarmed by the forces unleashed, and some of the nobility began to shift towards support of the government. Implementing the somewhat vague terms of the agreement led to further tensions, and William of Orange, appointed by Margaret to resolve the situation in Antwerp, tried and failed to produce a wider settlement that all parties could live with. Instead unrest continued and the episode fed into the causes of the Dutch Revolt which was to erupt two years later.\n\nOn August 29 Margaret wrote a somewhat panicked letter to Philip, \"claiming that half the population were infected with heresy, and that over 200,000 people were up in arms against her authority\". Philip decided to send the Duke of Alba with an army; he would have led them himself but was kept in Spain by other matters, especially the increasingly evident insanity of his heir, Carlos, Prince of Asturias. When Alba arrived the following year, and soon replaced Margaret as Governor-general, his heavy-handed repression, which included the execution of many convicted of iconoclastic attacks the summer before, only made the situation worse.\n\nAntwerp was then Europe's largest financial and international trading centre, taking as much as 75 or 80% of English exports of cloth, and the disturbances created serious and well-justified fears that its position as such was under threat. Sir Thomas Gresham, the English financier who arranged Elizabeth I's borrowings, and whose agent in Antwerp was Clough, left London for Antwerp on August 23, only hearing about the Antwerp attacks \"en route\"; he needed to roll-over 32,000 Flemish pounds and borrow another 20,000 to finance her expenses in Ireland. Dining with William of Orange on his arrival, he was asked if \"the English were minded to depart this town or not\", and wrote to William Cecil, Elizabeth's chief minister, \"in alarm that he \"liked none of their proceedings\" but \"apprehended great mischief\", and urged that the English government \"should do very well in time to consider some other realm and place\" for marketing English products. It was a message that helped shape the course of events.\"\n\nThe English had found the Antwerp money market short of funds since earlier in the year, and now made use of Cologne and Augsburg as well, but as events unfolded in the next year, and the personal position of some leading lenders became precarious, the English found to their surprise that repayments were no longer pressed for, probably as the lenders were happy to keep their money abroad on loan to a secure borrower. The Dutch Revolt, which from 1585 onwards included a Dutch blockade of the River Scheldt leading to the city, was to finally destroy Antwerp as a major trading centre.\nIn many places there were attempts by Calvinist preachers to take over the ransacked buildings. These were usually repulsed in the period after the attacks. In the months afterwards there were attempted negotiations in many cities, by William of Orange and others, to allocate certain churches to accommodate the local Protestants, often divided into Lutherans and Calvinists. These had mostly failed within a few weeks, not least because Margaret's government rejected them; she had already had an earlier attempt at compromise overruled by Philip a few months earlier, and been embarrassingly forced to retract a decree. Instead there was a wave of building or adapting Calvinist \"temples\", though in the end none of these were to remain in use by the following year, and their layouts, which seem to have echoed early Swiss and Scottish Calvinist designs, are now largely unknown.\n\nOnce the revolt proper had started, there were many further instances of clearing churches, some still unofficial and disorderly, but as cities became officially Protestant, increasingly undertaken by official order, like the Amsterdam Alteratie (\"Alteration\") of 1578. Altars, to which Calvinists, unlike Lutherans, took strong exception, were typically completely removed, and in some large churches, like Utrecht Cathedral, large tomb monuments put where they stood, partly to make their return more difficult if political conditions changed. After the Eighty Years War was finally over, in the cities and areas that became Protestant, the old Catholic churches were all or nearly all taken over by the new established church of the Calvinist Dutch Reformed Church, with other congregations left to shift for themselves.\n\nThe bare and empty state of those churches left in Catholic hands after the hostilities eventually ended prompted a large programme of restocking with Catholic art, which had much to do with the vigour of Northern Mannerism and later Flemish Baroque painting, and many Gothic churches were given Baroque makeovers. In the north, now very largely Protestant, religious art largely disappeared, and Dutch Golden Age painting concentrated on a wide range of secular subjects, such as genre painting, landscape art and still-lifes, with results that might sometimes have surprised the Protestant ministers who initiated the movement. According to one scholar, this \"was not only a dramatic change in the function of art, it was the context in which our present concept of art, what the literary critic M. H. Abrams called \"art as such\", first began to take shape\", replacing a \"construction model\" where art theory concerned itself with how the maker created his work, with a \"contemplation model\" concerned with the effect of the finished work on a \"lone perceiver\" or viewer.\n\n\n\n"}

Deeply influenced by the writing of Edward Bellamy, Willard is best remembered as a principal in several utopian socialist enterprises, including the late 1890s colonization efforts of the Brotherhood of the Cooperative Commonwealth (BCC).\n\nCyrus Field Willard was born August 17, 1858 in Lynn, Massachusetts, a member of a family of six children. The Willard family moved from Lynn to Boston in 1866, where Cyrus attended public school before gaining employment as a newspaper reporter for the \"Boston Globe.\"\n\nIn addition to working as a journalist, Willard contributed occasional pieces to the periodical press, including a humorous 1887 interview with poet Walt Whitman, \"A Chat with the Good Grey Poet,\" published in \"The American Magazine.\"\n\nWillard had a wide circle of political friends and acquaintances and maintained correspondence with prominent figures of the English and American socialist and anarchist movements, including William Morris, Sidney Webb, Benjamin R. Tucker, and Peter Kropotkin. Willard was additionally fluent in German, which enabled him to attend socialist meetings in the Boston area conducted in that language.\n\nIn 1888 writer Edward Bellamy published the book \"Looking Backward: 2000–1887,\" a best-selling work of utopian fiction which depicted a futuristic American society of coordinated production and ameliorated social problems. Although the book sold slowly following its initial release in January 1888, Cyrus Field Willard was one of the first to read the novel, published as it was in his hometown of Boston. A correspondence with Bellamy ensued, in which Willard suggested the possibility of establishing a network of local political groups to attempt to put Bellamy's fictional vision of the future into practical existence.\n\nThis idea was independently shared by another Boston journalist Sylvester Baxter, who similarly wrote to Bellamy with his concept. The pair were put into contact with one another and on December 1, 1888, an organizational meeting was held for what would be the first in a vast array of Nationalist Clubs. Willard as a co-founder of the Nationalist Club No. 1 became the group's Secretary.\n\nFrom the outset Willard was deeply involved in attempts to build a broad Nationalist movement from coast to coast, contributing a regular column to the official organ of the group, the magazine \"The Nationalist.\" Willard was for a time from Bellamy and the Nationalist movement, hurt by his refusal to assume a leading role at \"The Nationalist\" and his subsequent decision to start instead a new weekly newspaper called \"The New Nation,\" making use of the financially failing magazine's subscriber list to build his own circulation. Willard lamented that Bellamy had abandoned \"his truest friends\" so as to \"play at politics\" with his Boston rivals Mason Green and Henry R. Legate, the latter of whom Willard believed to be a \"corrupt politician.\"\n\nBellamy's foray into independent publishing would prove to be a short one, with his paper forced to terminate in 1894, with the Nationalist movement falling to pieces. Even after the demise of the movement proper, however, Willard maintained close relations with the author who had inspired it, attempting to bring the ill-and-dying Bellamy into the fold of the emerging American socialist movement.\n\nIn 1897, Willard became active in the Social Democracy of America and the closely related Brotherhood of the Cooperative Commonwealth and its effort to establish a model socialist colony in a Western American state with a view to inspiring others to emulate the project and to eventually win political control of the state government. Willard was deeply committed to the colonization plan, which would ultimately lead to the defection of a minority faction to establish a more conventional political organization, the Social Democratic Party of America in 1898.\n\nTogether with Richard J. Hinton of Washington, DC, and Wilfred P. Borland of Bay City, Michigan, Willard was one of three central decision-makers in the selection of Washington as the group's target state. He and Borland were also place in charge of the purchasing of land there for colonization, making possible the establishment there of the Burley Colony.\n\nIn Washington the colonization effort abandoned the banner of the Social Democracy of America to become a new organization called the Cooperative Brotherhood. Willard played a leading role in this organization, appearing as the lead signatory on the group's deed of trust for purchase of communal land, and was additionally chosen as the first Secretary of the organization.\n\nWillard would remain a resident of the Burley Colony for two years, before giving up on the project and leaving for the sunnier climes of Southern California.\n\nFollowing his departure from the Burley Colony, Willard abandoned socialism and became deeply involved in the theosophy movement. He moved to Los Angeles and there established a local chapter of the Theosophical Society there. Willard had long been an adherent of spiritualism, having been introduced in 1884 when he first read Helena Blavatsky's seminal work, \"Isis Unveiled.\"\n\nWillard was also an active Freemason, attaining the status of 32nd Degree. On October 1, 1928, Willard joined with other leading Masons in Cedar Rapids, Iowa to launch the Philalethes Society, a Masonic research organization. The society was based upon the previously existing Académie Française and limited its membership to just 40 fellows, among whom was Willard. The organization continues to exist into the 21st Century and is regarded as the leading Masonic research and writing organization in North America.\n\nWillard died January 17, 1942 in San Diego, California. He was 83 years old at the time of his death.\n\nWillard was the second cousin of Frances Willard, founder of the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and prominent suffragist. Cyrus Willard claimed to have played a significant role in the shaping of his cousin's political views, recalling in his autobiography, \"I had a pile of correspondence with her four inches tall and converted her to the proposition that poverty caused as much intemperance as intemperance caused poverty.\"\n\n\n"}

The device is used frequently for auditing in Scientology and divergent groups. The efficacy and legitimacy of Scientology's use of the E-meter has been subject to extensive debate and litigation and in accordance with a federal court order, the Church of Scientology now publishes disclaimers in its books and publications declaring that the E-meter \"by itself does nothing\" and that it is used specifically for spiritual purposes.\n\nSuch devices have been used as a research tool in many human studies, and as one of several components of the Leonarde Keeler's polygraph (lie detector) system, which has been widely criticized as ineffective or pseudoscientific by legal experts and psychologists.\n\nElectrodermal activity (EDA) refers to the changing electrical charges observed on the surface of the skin. EDA meters were first developed in 1889 in Russia, and psychotherapists began using them as tools for therapy in the 1900s.\n\nVolney Mathison (chiropractor, radio engineer, psychologist, and hypnotist) built an EDA meter based on a Wheatstone bridge, a vacuum tube amplifier, and a large moving-coil meter that projected an image of the needle on the wall. He patented his device in 1954 as an \"electropsychometer\" or E-meter, and it came to be known as the \"Mathison Electropsychometer\". In Mathison's words, the E-meter \"has a needle that swings back and forth across a scale when a patient holds on to two electrical contacts\". Mathison recorded in his book, \"Electropsychometry\", that the idea of the E-meter came to him in 1950 while listening to a lecture by L. Ron Hubbard:In 1950 ... I next attended a series of lectures being given by a very controversial figure, who several times emphasized that perhaps the major problem of psychotherapy was the difficulty of maintaining the communication of accurate or valid data from the patient to the therapist. ... it appeared to me that the psychogalvanometer showed most promise.L. Ron Hubbard told of that encounter in a 1952 recorded lecture:This machine, the electropsychometer, has been acting as a pilot since about the first of January 1952. Very early I wanted a pilot; I had to have some method of metering preclears which was not dependent at all upon opinion or judgment. And I went out and looked at the existing lie detector equipment and I could not find anything which would do a job of work. Now, Volney Mathison out on the Coast heard a talk out there one day, and I mentioned this fact. ... I had one of the fanciest electroencephalographs made and it didn’t do anything very much, police detectors didn’t do anything very much, and Mathison went to work and he floated a current within a current. This machine is relatively simple, but it's a current floating inside another current .. And I am, by the way, very much indebted to Mathison just on this basis of all of a sudden having a pilot.Mathison began working with Hubbard in 1951 and that year filed application for his first E-meter patent, U.S. Patent 2,684,670. After the partnership broke up in 1954, Mathison continued improving his E-meters with additional patents (, ), marketing them through his own company and publications, retaining many of the concepts and terms from his time with Hubbard.\n\nIn a separate line of development, EDA monitors were incorporated in polygraph machines by Leonarde Keeler. Rigorous testing of the polygraph has yielded mixed results (see Polygraph main page), and some critics classify polygraph operation as a pseudoscience.\n\nThe E-meter was adopted for use in Dianetics and Scientology when Mathison collaborated with L. Ron Hubbard in 1951. Some sources say the E-meter was \"developed by Volney Mathison following Hubbard's designs\", or that Hubbard invented it. Hubbard falsely claimed to be the inventor of the E-meter, a claim which is in keeping with the Scientology stance that Hubbard is the \"source\", or \"the only originator of all Dianetics and Scientology material\".\n\nThe E-meter was not part of the early days of Dianetics and Scientology. Auditing was composed of conversation and not led by a mechanical device. Hubbard introduced an E-meter prototype during the 1952 Philadelphia Doctorate Course but did not introduce his transistorized version after several years later. The E-meter became \"the principal material artifact\" of Dianetics and Scientology from the 1960s onward.\n\nIn the book, \"L. Ron Hubbard, Messiah or Madman?\", Bent Corydon wrote:\n\nThough it seemed for a while that Scientology's more advanced techniques would serve without an E-meter, a few months later in May 1955, Hubbard wrote:\n\nThe Scientology meter was smaller, based on transistors rather than vacuum tubes, and powered by a low-voltage rechargeable battery rather than line voltage.\n\nFrom then on, the E-meter was a required tool for Scientology ministers. The \"Hubbard Mark II\" E-meter was christened in 1960 and the Hubbard Mark III shortly after. On December 6, 1966, Hubbard won a patent on the Mark V version under the name \"Hubbard Electropsychometer\". Corydon wrote that the Hubbard E-meter was actually developed by Scientologists Don Breeding and Joe Wallis, though the patent () does not list other developers.\n\nCorydon's account was said to be based on the memoirs of Hubbard's son, Ronald DeWolf, but in 1987, DeWolf sued the publisher to prevent publication and swore an affidavit repudiating everything in the book.\n\nThe Scientology E-meter has been redesigned and re-patented several times since its first introduction to Dianetics (e.g.: , , ).\n\nIn 1969, Scientology was accepted as a religion by the Court of Appeal and declared that the E-meter was useful in \"bona fide religious counseling\". District Court Judge Gesell, while denying medical validity to the device, returned the e-meter to the Church. All e-meters from this point forward had to be inscribed with a disclaimer that it was not for medical or scientific diagnoses, treatment or prevention of any disease. The church reformulated the disclaimer into: \"The Hubbard electrometer is a religious artifact. By itself, this meter does nothing. It is for religious use by students and Ministers of the church in Confessionals and pastoral counseling only.\"\n\nEDA meters are used in both therapist-patient and bio-feedback settings. EDA is one of the factors recorded by polygraphs, and EDA meters are often used in human studies to gauge psychological responses. EDA monitoring is on the increase in clinical applications. Hugo D. Critchley, Chair in Psychiatry at the Brighton and Sussex Medical School states, \"EDA is a sensitive psychophysiological index of changes in autonomic sympathetic arousal that are integrated with emotional and cognitive states.\"\n\nE-meters are used in Scientology and Dianetics by Scientology ministers known as \"auditors\". Scientology materials traditionally refer to the subject as the \"preclear\", although auditors continue to use the meter on subjects who are well beyond the \"clear\" level. The auditor gives the preclear a series of commands or questions while the preclear holds a pair of cylindrical electrodes (\"cans\") connected to the meter, and the auditor notes both the verbal response and the activity of the meter. Auditor training includes familiarization with a number of characteristic needle movements, each with a specific significance. Religion scholar Dorthe Refslund Christensen describes the e-meter as \"a technical device that could help the auditor locate engrams and areas of change when auditing a preclear\".\n\nSome critics of Dianetics and Scientology assert that the Scientology concepts associated with the E-meter and its use are regarded by the scientific and medical communities as pseudoscience, and that the E-meter has never been subjected to clinical trials as a therapeutic tool. Nevertheless, by 1972, more than 1500 articles on electrodermal activity (EDA) had been published in professional publications, and today EDA is regarded as a popular method for investigating human psychophysiological phenomena.\n\nScientologists claim that in the hands of a trained operator, the meter can indicate whether a person has been relieved from the spiritual impediment of past experiences. In accordance with a 1974 federal court order, the Church of Scientology asserts that the E-meter is intended for use only in church-sanctioned auditing sessions; it is not a curative or medical device. The E-meters used by the Church were previously manufactured by Scientologists at their Gold Base facility, but now are manufactured in Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n\nAccording to Hubbard, the E-meter is used by the operator for three vital functions:\nThe Church claims that the E-meter can be used to assess the emotion charge of single words, whole sentences, and questions, as well as indicating the general state of the subject when the operator is not speaking. Few users of the E-meter claim that it does anything to the subject. To most, it does no more than suggest to the operator a change of mental, emotional, or parasympathetic nervous state or activity.\n\nNew religious movement scholar Douglas Cowan writes that Scientologists cannot progress along the Bridge to Total Freedom without an E-meter, and that Hubbard even told Scientologists to buy two E-meters, in the event that one of them fails to operate. According to anthropologist Roy Rappaport, the E-meter is a ritual object, an object that \"stand[s] indexically for something intangible\".\n\nOne of E-meter's primary components is a Wheatstone bridge, an electrical circuit configuration invented in 1833 that enables the detection of very small differences between two electrical impedances (in this case, resistance). The E-meter is constructed so that one resistance is the subject's body and the other is a rheostat controlled by the operator. A small voltage from the battery is applied to electrodes held in the subjects hands. As the electrical properties (electrodermal activity) of the subject's body changes during the counseling, the resulting changes in the small electric current are displayed in needle movements on a large analog panel meter. The dial face is without numbers because the absolute resistance in ohms is relatively unimportant, while the operator watches primarily for characteristic needle motions. The voltage applied to the electrodes is less than 1.5V, and the electric current through the subject's body is less than a half a milliampere.\n\nIn the Scientology E-meter, the large control, known as the \"tone arm\", adjusts the meter bias, while a smaller one controls the gain. The operator manipulates the tone arm to keep the needle near the center of the dial so its motion is easily observed. A simple E-meter powered by direct current, such as that used by the Scientologists and the like, displays several kinds of electrodermal activity (EDA) on the one dial without distinction, including changes in conductance, resistance, and bioelectric potential. Researchers in psychophysiology are also exploring admittance and impedance aspects of EDA that can be observed only with alternating current.\n\nThe E-Meter, measuring variations in electrodermal activity (which can be highly responsive to emotion), functions on one of the same physiological data sources as the polygraph or lie detector. According to Scientology doctrine, the resistance corresponds to the \"mental mass and energy\" of the subject's mind, which are claimed to change when the subject thinks of particular mental images (engrams). One account tells about L. Ron Hubbard using the E-meter to determine whether or not fruits can experience pain, as in his 1968 assertion that tomatoes \"scream when sliced\".\n\nThe traditional theory of EDA holds that skin resistance varies with the state of sweat glands in the skin. Sweating is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, Because sweat contains dielectrics (salt, etc.), conductivity is increased when the sweat glands are activated. But some advocates argue that the meter responds more quickly than would be possible by the exudation and drying of sweat. They propose an additional mechanism termed the \"Tarchanoff Response\" through which the cerebral cortex of the brain affects the current directly. This phenomenon is not completely understood, and further research needs to be performed.\n\nThe medical establishment had been watching Hubbard's enterprises since 1951 when the New Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners prosecuted the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation (Elizabeth, New Jersey) for practicing medicine without a license. In 1958, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seized and destroyed 21,000 Dianazene tablets from Hubbard's Distribution Center, Inc., charging that they were falsely labeled as a treatment for radiation sickness.\n\nOn January 4, 1963, in service of an FDA complaint, more than 100 US marshals and deputized longshoremen with drawn guns raided the Founding Church of Scientology in Washington, D.C. and confiscated more than three tons of property including 5,000 books, 2,900 booklets, and several hundred E-meters. The FDA accused the Church of making false medical claims that the E-meters could treat physical and mental illnesses. The FDA also charged that the meters did not bear adequate directions for treating the conditions for which they were recommended.\n\nThe Church claimed that they had not written any publication that the E-meter could or would heal anything, and sued to get the property back. Years of litigation ensued. In the first trial beginning on April 3, 1967, the jury found that the Church misrepresented the E-meter and the judge ordered the confiscated materials destroyed. But in 1969, the US Court of Appeals reversed the verdict; the Church, it said, had made substantial showing that Scientology is a religion and the government had done nothing to rebut the claim. The US Court of Appeals wrote: [The Founding Church has] made no attempt to contradict the expert testimony introduced by the Government. They have conceded that the E-meter is of no use in the diagnosis or treatment of disease as such, and have argued that it was never put forward as having such use. Auditing or processing, in their view, treats the spirit of man, not his body, though through the healing of the spirit the body can be affected. They have culled from their literature numerous statements disclaiming any intent to treat disease and recommending that Scientology practitioners send those under their care to doctors when organic defects may be found. They have introduced through testimony a document which they assert all those who undergo auditing or processing must sign which states that Scientology is \"a spiritual and religious guide intended to make persons more aware of themselves as spiritual beings, and not treating or diagnosing human ailments of body or mind, and not engaged in the teaching of medical arts or sciences * * *.\"Finally, with respect to their claim to be a religion and hence within the protection of the First Amendment, they have shown that the Founding Church of Scientology is incorporated as a church in the District of Columbia, and that its ministers are qualified to perform marriages and burials. They have introduced their Creed into evidence. The Government has made no claim that the Founding Church is not a \"bona fide\" religion, that auditing is not part of the exercise of that religion, or that the theory of auditing is not a doctrine of that religion.\n\nHaving found that Scientology was a religion, the Court wrote that the government was forbidden by the First Amendment of the Constitution to rule on the truth or falsity of the Church's doctrines and interfere with its practices, provided the claims are not manifestly insincere and the practices are reasonably harmless. The Court ordered a new trial with the mandate that the trial court could not forbid auditing, use of the E-meter, or purveyance of the literature within a religious context. The FDA appealed the decision, but in 1969, the US Supreme Court declined to review the case, commenting only that \"Scientology meets the \"prima facie\" test of religion\". In his 1973 judgment, District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell ruled that:Hubbard and his fellow Scientologists developed the notion of using an E-Meter to aid auditing. Substantial fees were charged for the meter and for auditing sessions using the meter. They repeatedly and explicitly represented that such auditing effectuated cures of many physical and mental illnesses. An individual processed with the aid of the E-Meter was said to reach the intended goal of 'clear' and was led to believe that there was reliable scientific proof that once cleared many, indeed most, illnesses would successfully be cured. Auditing was guaranteed to be successful. All this was and is false.Unable to do more under the mandate from the Court of Appeals, Judge Gesell ordered all the property to be returned to the Church, and thereafter, the E-meter may be used only in \"\"bona fide\" religious counseling\". All meters and referring literature must include a label disclaiming any medical benefits:\n\nThe church adopted a modified version of that statement, which it still invokes in connection with the E-meter. The current statement reads:\n\nJudge Gesell also ordered the Church to pay all the government's legal fees and warehousing costs for the confiscated property for the nine years of litigation. He also required the church to pay the salaries and travel expenses of FDA agents who might, from time to time, inspect for compliance with the court's order. The raid was ruled illegal, but the government retained copies of the documents.\n\nIn 1979 in Sweden, a court forbade calling the E-meter \"an invaluable aid to measuring man's mental state and changes in it\" in an advertisement. The prohibition was upheld by the European Commission of Human Rights in case \"X. and Church of Scientology v. Sweden\".\n\nIn October 2009, a three-judge panel at the Correctional Court in Paris, France convicted the church and six of its members of organized fraud. The Court's decision followed a three-week trial, where two plaintiffs alleged they were defrauded by the organization. One plaintiff's complaint involved the use of an E-Meter by Scientologists with medical implications. This plaintiff claimed that, after being audited with the device, she was encouraged to pay tens of thousands of euros for vitamins, books, and courses to improve her condition. She argued that amounted to fraud. The Court agreed, and the ruling was upheld on appeal in 2013. See .\n\nIn 1964, the government of Victoria, Australia held a Board of Inquiry into Scientology which returned its findings in a document colloquially known as the Anderson Report. Psychiatrist Ian Holland Martin, honorary federal secretary of the Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, gave evidence that the E-Meter \"used for Scientology\" was a \"psycho-galvano-meter\" and was \"dangerous in unqualified hands\". He said that if the E-meter \"was suggested to possess mysterious powers\" to someone who did not understand that it had \"been thoroughly discredited as a lie detector\" then \"that person would be suggestible to ideas foisted on him by the operator\". The final report of the inquiry stated that the E-meter enabled Scientology\n\nto assume, intensify and retain control over the minds and wills of preclears. Fears of its abilities keep them in constant subjection. Its use can be so manipulated by cunningly phrased questions that almost any desired result can be obtained, and it is used unscrupulously to dominate students and staff alike. All the evil features of scientology are intensified where the E-meter is involved. When used in conjunction with hypnotic techniques, its evil impact is greatly increased.\n\nThis simple electrical device is not, of course, the sole basis for the condemnation of scientology, but without the E-meter scientology would be partly disarmed.\n\nIn 1965, Victoria banned the use of the E-meter without a license, with Western Australia and South Australia following suit. In 1969, the High Court of Western Australia ruled the ban illegal. South Australia repealed its law in 1973, and Victoria repealed it in 1982. In 1983, the High Court of Australia ruled that Scientology was a religion, and as such had the same rights and protections.\n\nWithin the Church of Scientology, the early psychoanalysts are credited with first use of the E-meter. \n\nL. Ron Hubbard credited Mathison with recreating the E-meter and bringing the first model to Hubbard for use in Dianetics. Hubbard set out his theory of how the E-meter works in his book \"Understanding the E-Meter\":\n\nHubbard claimed that this \"mental mass\" has the same physical characteristics, including weight, as mass as commonly understood by lay persons:\n\nThis text in \"Understanding the E-Meter\" is accompanied by three drawings. The first shows a man standing on a weighing scale, which reflects a weight of \"150\" (the units are not given). The next shows the man on the same scale, weighed down under a burden of \"Mental Image Pictures\", and the scale indicates a weight of \"180\". The last picture shows the man standing upright on the scale, now unburdened by \"Mental Image Pictures\" and with a smile on his face, while the scale again indicates a weight of \"148\".\n\nBob Thomas, senior executive of the church in the early 1970s, gave a prosaic description.\n\n\n"}

Since embassies are exempt from the host country's laws, they are able to provide services to prohibited and persecuted religious groups. For example, Catholic embassy chapels in Britain provided services while Catholicism was banned under the Penal Laws. A similar role was filled for Protestants by the Prussian embassy chapel in Rome, where Protestantism was unlawful until 1871. Upon laws granting freedom of religion, these embassy chapels have often then become regularised churches and parishes, such as the Dutch embassy chapel in Istanbul, which then became The Union Church of Istanbul.\n\nEarly modern embassy staff, who commonly lived in the ambassadorial residence, were permitted to have in-house chapels and chaplains, especially where, in the wake of the Reformation, they lived in a country that banned their religious faith. These soon drew members of the same faith to join the worship services in the embassy. The Dutch Republic sponsored chapels in twelve of its embassies, which acted as churches for local Reformed Protestants. Emperor Leopold I sponsored them wherever he could, \"That Catholic services might be held to comfort the Catholics of the area, and to promote the further growth of this religion.\" By the late eighteenth century, a new legal principle had come into being, extraterritoriality, according to which, \"the ambassador and the precincts of the embassy stood as if on the soil of his homeland, subject only to its laws.\" As religious freedom advanced with time, many of the embassy chapels lost their function as safe havens and were converted into churches proper or dismissed.\n\nDuring the reign of Elizabeth I, Catholicism was gradually outlawed in England, and Catholic masses and worship were prohibited, particularly after the Oath of Supremacy of 1559. With the \"Act to retain the Queen's Majesty's subjects in their obedience,\" passed in 1581, the celebration of Mass was prohibited under penalty of a fine of two hundred marks and imprisonment for one year for the celebrant, and a fine of one hundred marks and the same imprisonment for those who heard the Mass. The reign of Charles I (1625–49) saw a small revival of Catholicism in England, especially among the upper classes. As part of his royal marriage settlement Charles's Catholic wife, Henrietta Maria, was permitted her own royal chapel (the Queen's Chapel in London, as well as a chapel at Somerset House) and chaplain.\n\nAmbassadors of Catholic nations sought to provide relief for persecuted English Catholics by protecting worship at their chapels with diplomatic immunity. The English government attempted unsuccessfully several times to dissuade such use of the Spanish and Portuguese embassies between 1563 and 1611. In 1610, James I asked foreign ambassadors not to allow English priests to celebrate at, or English Catholics to attend, their chapels, but only the Venetian ambassador complied. Starting in 1624, several arrests of English Catholics leaving these embassy chapels were made, which irritated the French ambassador, the Marquis of Blainville. On March 10, 1630, an order in council forbade Catholics to hear Mass at the embassies. The next Sunday, as reported by the Venetian ambassador, guards were placed in front of the French, Venetian and Spanish embassies, and Catholics were arrested as they left the premise; afterwards the Spanish ambassador, Don Carlos Coloma, unsuccessfully tried to obtain their release. Coloma diffused the issue by taking residence in the countryside, and demanding that the English government punish those who had violated his diplomatic immunity. Five years later, on April 12, 1635, the council directed Sir John Coke to inform the ambassadors that their diplomatic rights would not be infringed upon, but that penal laws against Catholics would be pursued. When a priest who had said Mass was captured and escaped to the house of the French ambassador Henri de Saint-Nectaire, where he was then recaptured, he was set free because of the right of extraterritoriality, and his pursuers were punished. Over time, enforcement of the law became lenient; Venetian ambassador Anzolo Corer wrote in 1636 that Mass at the chapel of the Queen and at the embassies was \"frequented with freedom.\" In 1637, large crowds attended Mass daily at the Spanish embassy.\n\nIn eighteenth-century London, there were chapels in the French, Spanish, Florentine, Venetian (in the Haymarket), Portuguese (originally in Golden Square, then in South Street, Grosvenor Square), Austrian (on Hanover Street), Neapolitan (in Soho Square), Bavarian (on Warwick Street) and Sardinian embassies. In London, the streets outside the houses and house chapels of the Spanish, French and Venetian embassies were the scenes of public protests, sometimes violent. The police sometimes attempted to detain British people who attended Catholic services in the embassy chapels. Embassy chapels led to diplomatic tension between the English government and the Catholic governments who operated the embassies between 1625 and 1660. In the eighteenth century, English subjects ceased to be harassed for attending services at the Sardinian embassy. On Easter Sunday 1772 James Boswell and Pasquale Paoli \"worshipped together at the Sardinian Chapel.\" When Catholic worship became allowed in London in 1791 with the Roman Catholic Relief Act, the Bavarian, Sardinian and Spanish embassy churches were converted into churches, while the others (Venetian, Neapolitan, Imperial, French and Florentine) were dismissed.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2544835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2544835", "title": "Essence–energies distinction", "text": "Essence–energies distinction\n\nThe essence–energies distinction is an Eastern Orthodox theological concept that states that there is a distinction between the essence (\"ousia\") and the energies (\"energeia\") of God. It was formulated by Gregory Palamas of Thessaloniki (1296–1359), as part of his defense of the Athonite monastic practice of \"hesychasmos\" against the charge of heresy brought by the humanist scholar and theologian Barlaam of Calabria.\n\nOrthodox theologians generally regard this distinction as a real distinction, and not just a conceptual distinction. Historically, Western Christian thought has tended to reject the essence–energies distinction as real in the case of God, characterizing the view as a heretical introduction of an unacceptable division in the Trinity and suggestive of polytheism.\n\nThe essence–energy distinction was formulated by Gregory Palamas of Thessaloniki (1296–1359), as part of his defense of the Athonite monastic practice of \"hesychasmos\", the mystical exercise of \"stillness\" to facilitate ceaseless inner prayer and noetic contemplation of God, against the charge of heresy brought by the humanist scholar and theologian Barlaam of Calabria. According to catholic-church.org,\n\nThe mystagogical teachings of hesychasm were approved in the Orthodox Church by a series of local Hesychast councils in the 14th century, and Gregory's commemoration during the liturgical season of Great Lent is seen as an extension of the Sunday of Orthodoxy.\n\nIn Eastern Orthodox theology God's essence is called \"ousia\", \"all that subsists by itself and which has not its being in another\", and is distinct from his energies (\"energeia\" in Greek, actus in Latin) or activities as actualized in the world. \n\nThe ousia of God is God as God is. The essence, being, nature and substance of God as taught in Eastern Christianity is uncreated, and cannot be comprehended in words. According to Lossky, God's ousia is \"that which finds no existence or subsistence in another or any other thing\". God's ousia has no necessity or subsistence that needs or is dependent on anything other than itself. \n\nIt is the energies of God that enable us to experience something of the Divine, at first through sensory perception and then later intuitively or noetically. As St John Damascene states, \"all that we say positively of God manifests not his nature but the things about his nature.\"\n\nAccording to Fr. John Romanides, Palamas considers the distinction between God's essence and his energies to be a \"real distinction\", as distinguished from the Thomistic \"virtual distinction\" and the Scotist \"formal distinction\". Romanides suspects that Barlaam accepted a \"formal distinction\" between God's essence and his energies. Other writers agree that Palamas views the distinction between the divine essence and the divine energies as \"real\".\n\nAccording to Lossky, if we deny the real distinction between essence and energy, we cannot fix any clear borderline between the procession of the divine persons (as existences and/or realities of God) and the creation of the world: both the one and the other will be equally acts of the divine nature (strictly uncreated from uncreated). The being and the action(s) of God then would appear identical, leading to the teaching of Pantheism.\n\nA few scholars argue against describing Palamas's essence–energies distinction in God as a \"real\" distinction. Orthodox philosophical theologian David Bentley Hart expresses doubt \"that Palamas ever intended to suggest a \"real\" distinction between God's essence and energies\". G. Philips argues that Palamas's distinction is not an \"ontological\" distinction but, rather, analogous to a \"formal distinction\" in the Scotist sense of the term. According to Dominican Catholic theological historian Fr. Aidan Nichols, Palamas's essence–energies distinction is not a mere \"formal\" distinction \"demanded by the limited operating capacities of human minds\".\n\nAccording to Anna N. Williams's study of Palamas, which is more recent than Bentley's and Philips's, in two passages (only) Palamas explicitly says God's energies are \"as constitutively and ontologically distinct from the essence as are the three Hypostases\", and in one place he makes explicit his view, repeatedly implied elsewhere, that the essence and the energies are not the same; but Williams contends that not even in these passages did Palamas intend to argue for an \"ontological or fully real distinction\", and that the interpretation of his teaching by certain polemical modern disciples of his is false.\n\nEastern Orthodox theologians have criticized Western theology, especially the traditional scholastic claim that God is \"actus purus\", for its alleged incompatibility with the essence–energies distinction. Christos Yannaras writes, \"The West confuses God's essence with his energy, regarding the energy as a property of the divine essence and interpreting the latter as \"pure energy\" (actus purus)\" According to George C. Papademetriou, the essence–energies distinction \"is contrary to the Western confusion of the uncreated essence with the uncreated energies and this is by the claim that God is Actus Purus\".\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church distinguishes between doctrine, which is single and must be accepted by Roman Catholics, and theological elaborations of doctrine, about which Catholics may legitimately disagree. With respect to the Eastern and Western theological traditions, the Catholic Church recognizes that, at times, one tradition may \"come nearer to a full appreciation of some aspects of a mystery of revelation than the other, or [express] it to better advantage.\" In these situations, the Church views the various theological expressions \"often as mutually complementary rather than conflicting.\"\n\nAccording to Meyendorff, from Palamas's time until the twentieth century, Roman Catholic theologians generally rejected the idea that there is in God a real essence–energies distinction. In their view, a real distinction between the essence and the energies of God contradicted the teaching of the First Council of Nicaea on divine unity. Catholic theologian Ludwig Ott held that an absence of real distinction between the attributes of God and God's essence is a dogma of the Catholic Church.\n\nIn contrast, Jürgen Kuhlmann argues that the Roman Catholic Church never judged Palamism to be heretical, adding that Palamas did not consider that the distinction between essence and energies in God made God composite. According to Kuhlmann, \"the denial of a real distinction between essence and energies is not an article of Catholic faith\".\n\nAccording to Meyendorff, the later twentieth century saw a change in the attitude of Roman Catholic theologians to Palamas, a \"rehabilitation\" of him that has led to increasing parts of the Western Church considering him a saint, even if uncanonized. Some Western scholars maintain that there is no conflict between the teaching of Palamas and Roman Catholic thought on the distinction. According to G. Philips, the essence–energies distinction of Palamas is \"a typical example of a perfectly admissible theological pluralism\" that is compatible with the Roman Catholic magisterium. Jeffrey D. Finch claims that \"the future of East-West rapprochement appears to be overcoming the modern polemics of neo-scholasticism and neo-Palamism\". Some Western theologians have incorporated the essence–energies distinction into their own thinking.\n\nThe Danish Lutheran philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, widely considered the father of existentialism, expressed (pseudonymously as John Climacus) in \"Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments\" an approach to God which holds that the Father's \"hypostasis\" (existence) has logical primacy over his \"ousia\" (essence or substance). Hence the teaching that the core of existentialist philosophy can be understood as the maxim, \"existence before essence.\" This has caused many Western observers to see Eastern Orthodox Christian theology as existentialistic (since the Essence–Energies distinction also somewhat holds the view). This also accounts for other existentialist works such as Fyodor Dostoevsky's \"Notes from Underground\". In the case of Dostoevsky, his existentialist outlook would have drawn from his Russian Orthodox faith, but there is no record of Dostoevsky (and the Eastern Orthodox church in general) being exposed to or influenced by Kierkegaard's philosophical works.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "213183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=213183", "title": "Giuseppe Siri", "text": "Giuseppe Siri\n\nGiuseppe Siri (20 May 1906 – 2 May 1989) was an Italian Cardinal of the Catholic Church who served as Archbishop of Genoa from 1946 to 1987, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1953 by Pope Pius XII. Some sedevacantist groups believe a conspiracy theory known as the Siri thesis, which states that Siri was elected during the 1958 papal conclave that elected Angelo Roncalli as John XXIII. Siri never held these views and accepted the authority of John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul I, and John Paul II.\n\nSiri was born in Genoa to Nicolò and Giulia (née Bellavista) Siri. He entered the minor seminary of Genoa on 16 October 1916, and attended the major seminary from 1917 to 1926. Siri then studied at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, and was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Carlo Minoretti on 22 September 1928. Finishing his studies at the Gregorian, he earned his doctorate in theology \"summa cum laude\" and also did pastoral work in Rome until autumn 1929.\n\nUpon returning to Genoa, he served as a chaplain until he became a professor of dogmatic theology at the major seminary in 1930, also teaching fundamental theology for a year. In addition to his academic duties, Siri was a preacher, conferencist (public speaker), and professor of religion at the classical lyceums named to \"Andrea Doria\" and \"Giuseppe Mazzini\" from 1931 to 1936. He was named prosynodal examiner in the archdiocesan curia in 1936 and rector of \"Collegio Teologico S. Tommaso d'Aquino\" in 1937.\n\nOn 14 March 1944, Siri was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Genoa and Titular Bishop of \"Livias\" by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 7 May from Cardinal Pietro Boetto, SJ, at the St. Lawrence Cathedral. He became vicar general for the Archdiocese on 8 September 1944. During his tenure as an auxiliary, he was a member of the Italian resistance movement in World War II. He negotiated with the Nazi forces surrounding Genoa and met secretly with partisan leaders, eventually arranging a Nazi surrender that avoided further bombardment of the city.\n\nFollowing the death of Cardinal Boetto, Siri was named Archbishop of Genoa on 14 May 1946, and installed on 29 May of that year. Pius XII created him Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome in the consistory of 12 January 1953. At the time of his elevation, he was the youngest member of the College of Cardinals. He became known as the \"minestrone cardinal\" for his relief work in soup kitchens.\n\nSiri was noted for his staunchly conservative views. At the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965), he sat on its Board of Presidency and, alongside Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and Cardinals Alfredo Ottaviani and Thomas Cooray, he was part of the association of traditionalist Council fathers named \"Coetus Internationalis Patrum\". However, Siri once said, \"I would describe myself as an independent, a man who walks alone and is not a member of any group.\" He was also opposed to collegiality and innovation.\n\nPope John XXIII named Siri the first President of the Italian Episcopal Conference on 12 October 1959. He remained in that post until 1965. Siri, who had voted in the conclaves of 1958 and 1963, was also one of the cardinal electors in the August and October 1978 conclaves. He was a strong candidate for the papacy, or \"papabile\", in all four conclaves, in which his support lay mostly with Curialists and other conservative cardinals. Media reports suggested that Siri in fact topped the first count of votes in the August 1978 conclave before losing to Albino Luciani, who became Pope John Paul I. Following John Paul I's death, Siri was the leading conservative candidate in opposition to Cardinal Giovanni Benelli, the Archbishop of Florence and leading liberal candidate. Vaticanologists suggested that the eventual winner, Cardinal Wojtyła, who became Pope John Paul II, was chosen as a compromise candidate between the two. Shortly afterwards, Siri implied that he disapproved of Wojtyła's election.\n\nIn a biography of Cardinal Siri, Nicla Buonasorte reports that Siri was a friend of Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, but disapproved of what the newspaper report on the book called his schismatic undertakings. Up to the last minute he begged him (\"on his knees\", the Cardinal wrote) not to break from Rome, but finally accepted that excommunication of the dissident bishop was unavoidable.\nBuonasorte commented: \"In all probability, it is due to Siri that Lefebvre had no significant following in Italy\".\n\nThe same book recalls how Siri seems to have turned a blind eye to the assistance given by one or two of his clergy to members of the German National Socialist Party, including Adolf Eichmann, fleeing to South America after the Second World War. It stresses, however, that this was out of compassion for people in difficulties, and quite unconnected with his well-known conservative views, in spite of which he conducted a personal \"Ostpolitik\" of contacts with the Soviet embassy in favour of the Church in Eastern Europe, without informing Pius XII of these contacts. Cardinal Siri during the war had supported Christian-Democrat Italian resistance financially and morally. He also aided and sheltered some of his priests who tried to help rescue threatened Jews to safety in Franco's neutral Spain.\nSiri reached age 80 in 1986 and thus lost the right to participate in future conclaves; he was the last remaining cardinal elector who had been elevated by Pope Pius XII. Siri resigned from his post in Genoa on 6 July 1987, after 41 years of service. He died in Villa Campostano, Genoa, at age 82, and was buried at San Lorenzo metropolitan cathedral in Genoa.\n\nSiri was considered a strong candidate in the 1958 papal conclave held to elect a successor to replace Pius XII On the evening of 26 October, the first day of the conclave, apparent white smoke was seen coming from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel, a traditional signal to the crowds in the square outside that a pope has been elected. No announcement was made, however, and after about half an hour, the smoke turned black, indicating that there was no result. Vatican Radio corrected its report.\n\nSometime in the late 1980s, an American traditionalist Catholic named Gary Giuffre began to expound the belief that Siri was the true pope, and that he was held captive in a monastery in Rome. According to Giuffre and his followers, the white smoke that was seen on 26 October 1958 did indeed mean that a pope had been elected, and that pope was Siri, but Siri was forced to reject the papacy because of threats from outside the conclave. Roncalli, who they claimed was a Freemason, was elected instead as Pope John XXIII. It was also claimed that this occurred during the 1963 conclave that elected Giovanni Battista Montini as Pope Paul VI.\n\nSiri himself never made these claims, and accepted the authority of all popes in his lifetime. He was appointed president of the Italian Episcopal Conference by Pope John in 1959, and remained in the post under Pope Paul until 1964. He was a candidate for pope in the 1978 conclave that followed the death of Paul VI, where he is thought to have led in the early ballot, but the conclave eventually elected Albino Luciani as Pope John Paul I, and again two months later in the October 1978 conclave, where he is also thought to have come within a few votes of election before the eventual election of Karol Wojtyła as Pope John Paul II. Siri never made any reference to the \"Siri thesis\", nor was there any mention of it in his \"New York Times\" obituary, in the biography written by Raimondo Spiazzi, or in a speech given by Giulio Andreotti on the centenary of Siri's birth in 2006.\n\n\n\n"}

The cell has no windows and the monk spends his life in complete darkness.\n\nThere have been Christian references to anchorites who have immured themselves seeking a life of prayer and mediation. Usually there would be two holes in their cell, one attached to the church in order to hear and observe Mass and the other on the opposite side for visitors.\n\nThe concept of an immured anchorite was also used in the novel \"The Wheel of Darkness\" by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24006909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24006909", "title": "Interlace (art)", "text": "Interlace (art)\n\nIn the visual arts, interlace is a decorative element found in medieval art. In interlace, bands or portions of other motifs are looped, braided, and knotted in complex geometric patterns, often to fill a space. Interlacing is common in the Migration period art of Northern Europe, especially in the Insular art of Ireland and the British Isles and Norse art of the Early Middle Ages and in Islamic art.\n\nIntricate braided and interlaced patterns, called \"plaits\" in British usage, are found in late Roman art in many parts of Europe, in mosaic floors and other media. Coptic manuscripts and textiles of 5th- and 6th-century Christian Egypt are decorated with broad-strand ribbon interlace ornament bearing a \"striking resemblance\" to the earliest types of knotwork found in the Insular art manuscripts of Ireland and the British Isles.\n\nInterlace is a key feature of the \"Style II\" animal style decoration of Migration Period art, and is found widely across Northern Europe, and was carried by the Lombards into Northern Italy. Typically the long \"ribbons\" eventually terminate in an animal's head. By about 700 it becomes less common in most of Europe, but continues to develop in the British Isles and Scandinavia, where it is found on metalwork, woodcarving, runestones, high crosses, and illuminated manuscripts of the 7th to 12th centuries. Artist George Bain has characterised the early Insular knotwork found in the 7th-century Book of Durrow and the Durham Cathedral Gospel Book fragment as \"broken and rejoined\" braids. Whether Coptic braid patterns were transmitted directly to Hiberno-Scottish monasteries from the eastern Mediterranean or came via Lombardic Italy is uncertain. Art historian James Johnson Sweeney argued for direct communication between the scriptoria of Early Christian Ireland and the Coptic monasteries of Egypt. \nThis new style featured elongated beasts intertwined into symmetrical shapes, and can be dated to the mid-7th century based on the accepted dating of examples in the Sutton Hoo treasure. The most elaborate interlaced zoomorphics occur in Viking Age art of the Urnes style (arising before 1050), where tendrils of foliate designs intertwine with the stylized animals.\n\nThe full-flowering of Northern European interlace occurred in the Insular art of the British Isles, where the animal style ornament of Northern Europe blended with ribbon knotwork and Christian influences in such works as the \"Book of Kells\" and the Cross of Cong. Whole carpet pages were illuminated with abstract patterns, including much use of interlace, and stone high crosses combined interlace panels with figurative ones. Insular interlace was copied in continental Europe, closely in the Franco-Saxon school of the 8th to 11th centuries, and less so in other Carolingian schools of illumination, where the tendency was to foliate decorative forms. In Romanesque art these became typical, and the interlace generally much less complex. Some animal forms are also found.\n\nGeometric interlacing patterns are common in Islamic ornament. They can be considered a particular type of arabesque. Umayyad architectural elements such as floor mosaics, window grilles, carvings and wall paintings, and decorative metal work of the 8th to 10th centuries are followed by the intricate interlacings common in later medieval Islamic art. Interlaced elaborations are also found in Kufic calligraphy.\n\nInterlace and knotwork are often found in Byzantine art, continuing Roman usage, but they are not given great prominence. One notable example of a widespread local usage of interlace is the three-ribbon interlace found in the early medieval Croatia on stone carvings from the 9th to 11th centuries.\n\n\n\n"}

Some Jewish children had been baptized while in the care of Catholic institutions or individual Catholics during the war. Such baptisms allowed children to be identified as Catholics to avoid deportation and incarceration in concentration camps, and likely death in the Holocaust. After the end of hostilities, Catholic Church officials, either Pope Pius XII or other prelates, issued instructions for the treatment and disposition of such Jewish children, some but not all of whom were now orphans. The rules they established, the authority that issued those rules, and their application in specific cases is the subject of investigations by journalists and historians.\n\nIn 2005, \"Corriere della Sera\" published a document dated 20 November 1946 on the subject of Jewish children baptized in wartime France. The document ordered that baptized children, if orphaned, should be kept in Catholic custody and stated that the decision \"has been approved by the Holy Father\". Two Italian scholars, Matteo Luigi Napolitano and Andrea Tornielli, confirmed that the memorandum was genuine although the reporting by the \"Corriere della Sera\" was misleading, as the document had originated in the French Catholic Church archives rather than the Vatican archives and strictly concerned itself with children without living blood relatives that were supposed to be handed over to Jewish organisations.\n\nAngelo Roncalli, later Pope John XXIII, was serving as Nuncio for France, and reportedly ignored this directive.\n\nA related case was the Finaly Affair, which occurred in France between 1945 and 1953. Cardinal Pierre-Marie Gerlier and abbé Roger Etchegaray attempted to settle a dispute over the custody of baptized Jewish children by transferring the Finaly children back to Spain and to Israel, where Jewish relatives were able to raise them.\n\nPius XII personally intervened when a Polish Catholic woman, Leokadia Jaromirska, later honored as one of the Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem, wrote him a letter seeking his permission to keep a young Jewish girl she had sheltered during the war. Pius denied her permission to do so and ordered the child returned to her father. He described it as her duty as a Catholic to return the child and to do so in goodwill and friendship.\n\nAbe Foxman (born 1940), the national director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), who had himself been baptized as a child and had been the subject of a custody battle, called for an immediate freeze on Pius's beatification process until the relevant Vatican Archives and baptismal records were opened. He wrote that opening archives could \nallow orphans \"an opportunity to discover their true origins and possibly a return to their original faith while providing a magnificent story of courage by Catholics. In the hell that was the Holocaust, this is one bright shining light.\" Foxman omitted this in later statements and ADL press releases concerning Pope Pius XII.\n\nYad L'Achim, an Israeli Jewish organization, has inquired into the orphans controversy and has demanded that Pope Benedict XVI act to reveal the \"hidden Jewish children\" of the Holocaust.\n\n\n"}

It emerged in the late 1970s as a means of evangelization to the wider heavy metal music scene and was pioneered by American bands Resurrection Band and Barnabas, Swedish band Jerusalem and Canadian band Daniel Band. Los Angeles' Stryper achieved wide success in the 1980s. In the mid to late 1980s, extreme metal genres were popularized by bands such as Vengeance Rising, Deliverance, Believer and Tourniquet.

Biblical figures that are identified in artifacts of questionable authenticity, for example the Jehoash Inscription and the bullae of Baruch ben Neriah, or who are mentioned in ancient but non-contemporary documents, such as David and Balaam, are excluded from this list.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible, known in Judaism by the acronym \"Tanakh\", is the collection of ancient writings that are considered sacred by both Jews and Christians. They tell the story of the Jewish people and their ancestors, starting from the creation narrative and concluding near the end of the 5th century BCE.\n\nAlthough the first mention of the name \"Israel\" in archaeology dates to the 13th century BCE, contemporary information on the Israelite nation prior to the 9th century BCE is extremely sparse. In the following centuries a small number of local Hebrew documents, mostly seals and bullae, mention biblical characters, but more extensive information is available in the royal inscriptions from neighbouring kingdoms, particularly Babylon, Assyria and Egypt.\n\nThe deuterocanon consists of books and parts of books that are included in the Old Testament canon of the Eastern Orthodox and/or Roman Catholic churches, but are not part of the Jewish Tanakh, and are regarded as apocryphal by Protestants. In contrast to the Tanakh, which is preserved in Hebrew (with some Aramaic parts), the deuterocanonical books are preserved mainly in Koine Greek, though Hebrew and Aramaic fragments have been found among the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\nWhile the deuterocanon describes events between the eighth and second centuries BCE, most historically identifiable people mentioned in the deuterocanon lived around the time of the Maccabean Revolt (167 – 160 BCE), by which time Judea had become part of the Seleucid Empire. Coins featuring the names of rulers had become widespread and many of them were inscribed with the year number in the Seleucid era, allowing them to be dated precisely. First-hand information comes also from the Greek historian Polybius (c. 200 – c. 118 BCE), whose \"Histories\" covers much of the same period as the Books of Maccabees, and from Greek and Babylonian inscriptions.\n\nBy far the most important and most detailed sources for first-century Jewish history are the works of Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (37 – c. 100 CE). These books mention many of the same prominent political figures as the New Testament books and are crucial for understanding the historical background of the emergence of Christianity. Josephus also mentions Jesus and the execution of John the Baptist although he was not a contemporary of either. Apart from Josephus, information about some New Testament figures comes from Roman historians such as Tacitus and Suetonius and from ancient coins and inscriptions.\n\nThe central figure of the New Testament is Jesus of Nazareth. Despite ongoing debate concerning the authorship of many of its books, there is a consensus among modern scholars that at least some were written by a contemporary of Jesus, namely the epistles of Paul, parts of which are considered undisputed. However, outside the New Testament, no contemporary references to Jesus are known, unless a very early dating is assumed of some uncanonical gospel such as the Gospel of Thomas. Nevertheless, some authentic first century and many second century writings exist in which Jesus is mentioned, leading scholars to conclude that the historicity of Jesus is well established by historical documents.\n\nThese are Biblical figures for which tentative but likely identifications have been found in contemporary sources based on matching names and credentials. The possibility of coincidental matching of names cannot be ruled out however.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This theory began in the 18th century with the goal of recognizing the relative levels of civility in societies.\n\nIn world cultures, there have traditionally been many different groupings of religious belief. In Indian culture, different religious philosophies were traditionally respected as academic differences in pursuit of the same truth. In Islam, the Quran mentions three different categories: Muslims, the People of the Book, and idol worshipers. Initially, Christians had a simple dichotomy of world beliefs: Christian civility versus foreign heresy or barbarity. In the 18th century, \"heresy\" was clarified to mean Judaism and Islam; along with paganism, this created a fourfold classification which spawned such works as John Toland's \"Nazarenus, or Jewish, Gentile, and Mahometan Christianity\", which represented the three Abrahamic religions as different \"nations\" or sects within \"religion\" itself, the \"true monotheism.\"\n\nDaniel Defoe described the original definition as follows: \"Religion is properly the Worship given to God, but 'tis also applied to the Worship of Idols and false Deities.\" At the turn of the 19th century, in between 1780 and 1810, the language dramatically changed: instead of \"religion\" being synonymous with spirituality, authors began using the plural, \"religions,\" to refer to both Christianity and other forms of worship. Therefore, Hannah Adams's early encyclopedia, for example, had its name changed from \"An Alphabetical Compendium of the Various Sects...\" to \"A Dictionary of All Religions and Religious Denominations\".\n\nIn 1838, the four-way division of Christianity, Judaism, Mahommedanism (archaic terminology for Islam) and Paganism was multiplied considerably by Josiah Conder's \"Analytical and Comparative View of All Religions Now Extant among Mankind\". Conder's work still adhered to the four-way classification, but in his eye for detail he puts together much historical work to create something resembling our modern Western image: he includes Druze, Yezidis, Mandeans, and Elamites under a list of possibly monotheistic groups, and under the final category, of \"polytheism and pantheism,\" he listed Zoroastrianism, \"Vedas, Puranas, Tantras, Reformed sects\" of India as well as \"Brahminical idolatry,\" Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Lamaism, \"religion of China and Japan,\" and \"illiterate superstitions\" as others.\n\nThe modern meaning of the phrase \"world religion,\" putting non-Christians at the same level as Christians, began with the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago. The Parliament spurred the creation of a dozen privately funded lectures with the intent of informing people of the diversity of religious experience: these lectures funded researchers such as William James, D. T. Suzuki, and Alan Watts, who greatly influenced the public conception of world religions.\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, the category of \"world religion\" fell into serious question, especially for drawing parallels between vastly different cultures, and thereby creating an arbitrary separation between the religious and the secular. Even history professors have now taken note of these complications and advise against teaching \"world religions\" in schools. Others see the shaping of religions in the context of the nation-state as the \"invention of traditions.\"\n\nReligious traditions fall into super-groups in comparative religion, arranged by historical origin and mutual influence. Abrahamic religions originate in West Asia, Indian religions in the Indian subcontinent (South Asia) and East Asian religions in East Asia. Another group with supra-regional influence are Afro-American religion, which have their origins in Central and West Africa.\n\n\nOne way to define a major religion is by the number of current adherents. The population numbers by religion are computed by a combination of census reports and population surveys (in countries where religion data is not collected in census, for example the United States or France), but results can vary widely depending on the way questions are phrased, the definitions of religion used and the bias of the agencies or organizations conducting the survey. Informal or unorganized religions are especially difficult to count.\n\nThere is no consensus among researchers as to the best methodology for determining the religiosity profile of the world's population. A number of fundamental aspects are unresolved:\n\n\nThe following are medium-sized world religions: \n\n\nFollowing is some available data based on the work of the \"World Christian Encyclopedia\":\n\n\n"}

She worked as a seamstress and also served as a catechist. She lived a simple life as a Franciscan and adapted the tenets of the order's charism into her own life and social apostolate. This became even greater after she was cured of bowel cancer on 8 December 1854 (when a Marian dogma was proclaimed) and she took this as a sign of greater service to both God and neighbor.\n\nHer beatification process commenced after her death and culminated in 1995 after Pope John Paul II presided over her beatification.\nAfter her death in 1879, Pope John Paul II beatified her in 1995 after the recognition of a miracle attributed to her intercession. One final miracle is needed for her to be canonized.\n\nMarguerite Bays was born in La Pierraz - a hamlet of Chavannes-les-Forts in the canton of Fribourg - on 8 September 1815 as the second of seven children to Pierre-Antoine Bays and Josephine Morel. Her siblings were:\nHer parents were devout and were farmers; she herself demonstrated great intelligence as a student (she studied at school in Chavannes-les-Forts) and demonstrated a particular though noted inclination towards reflection and contemplation while deciding to cease interacting with her peers at school in favor of the solitude of talking to God. In 1823 she received her Confirmation and received her First Communion in 1826. It was after this from 1830 that she was in an apprenticeship as a seamstress before offering her services as a seamstress to different households.\n\nIn her room at home she made a small altar where she placed flowers and a statue of the Madonna. Marguerite would awaken in the morning to request her intercession at the statue before going outside to do the duties of the farm. In her spare time she would tell children about the life of Jesus.\n\nDespite the urgings of those around her she dismissed the prospects of becoming a professed religious. Instead it was her desire to remain single as a virgin in order to devote herself to an austere life for Jesus Christ. But pain struck their household: her sister Marie-Marguerite (known as \"Mariette\") saw the dissolution of her marriage; her brother Joseph (of a violent temper and relaxed manners) served a sentence in prison and the elder Claude had a child out of the marriage - François - of which Marguerite - then aged seventeen - took care of in terms of his education. Claude got married (aged 47 at the time) with Josette who - according to the testimonies of the relatives - was a woman of rude and indelicate character never losing the chance to humiliate and mistreat her sister-in-law. But Marguerite took care of Josette despite this for she was quite ill so as to prepare her for death.\n\nIt was during her adolescence that some peasant farmers could no longer find work due to the introduction of mechanization in agriculture. But these troubles did not hinder her efforts to serve the poor for she carried milk and bread to them while she would also wash and mend their clothes or even give them new ones to use.\n\nHer devotedness to service of the poor led her to discover the Secular Franciscan Order which she became a professed member. Marguerite attended Mass on a frequent basis despite a 20 minute walk in the neighboring village of Siviriez and she took part in the Eucharistic Adoration session following the celebration of the Mass. Marguerite also embarked on pilgrimages to Marian shrines.\n\nMarguerite devoted part of her time on teaching catechism to children and often visited those who were ill. In 1853 she contracted bowel cancer and begged the Mother of God to heal her through her intercession. But at the same time she asked that her pain be linked with the suffering of Christ for her condition was her own Cross to bear. The disease first came when she began suffering from dizziness and acuta pain in her stomach as well as nausea that caused her often to vomit. But she tried to hide this and did not even take medicine for it until the condition was discovered and she was prompted to see a doctor who made the diagnosis and ruled out an operation. On 8 December 1854 - when Pope Pius IX proclaimed the dogma of the Immaculate Conception - she found that she was cured of her illness.\n\nThe mother abbess of a convent near her (also her goddaughter) Lutgarde Menétrey and the priest Joseph Schorderet often consulted with her in the founding of the Saint Paul's Work in 1873 which was an initiative that she both supported and encouraged despite the opposition of the Bishop of Fribourg Étienne Marilley.\n\nMarguerite later discovered that she had the stigmata around 1854 and consulted with her local bishop to oversee the verification of just how authentic the stigmata were. In addition she began to fall into ecstatic raptures when she would feel the pain of Christ once a week marking His death. But she first tried to hide the wounds from the outside world though it soon slipped out and news spread about her stigmata.\n\nThe stigmata was first noticed when she felt intense burning and noticed red blotches appear on her hands as well as on her feet and at her chest. Marguerite was subjected to a medical examination on 11 April 1873 and the doctor allowed for her niece to be present for the examination. Jules Grangier visited her at her home to see the stigmata for himself sometime in 1873 after a series of requests made to see her.\n\nIn her last weeks she could have just little herbal tea as well as small amounts of milk and light bread soup. Her condition had taken a rapid spiral downwards throughout Lent of 1879 and she suffered from extreme pain during this period. Marguerite grew frail and thin and her brother Jean said she felt like a bag of bones when he had to lift her. No one knew what her condition was for she kept silent on her sufferings and instead offered her pain to God; all that was known was that she suffered from acute pain in her head as well as her throat and chest. Marguerite died at 3:00pm on 27 June 1879 following several weeks of severe suffering and her funeral took place on 30 June; her funeral saw hundreds of people attend. Her remains were later transferred sometime after her death to the parish church at Siviriez.\n\nThe beatification process commenced in Switzerland in 1929 and closed not long after also in 1929. Another local process spanned from 1953 to 1955 and the two processes were ratified on 13 December 1985. Her writings were all investigated and received appropriate theological approval on 25 November 1956 after the determination was made that her writings adhered to Church doctrine and principles. The Positio was then forwarded to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome in 1986 for further evaluation. Theologians approved the dossier's contents on 13 February 1990 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. not long after on the following 19 June. Pope John Paul II approved that she had lived a life of heroic virtue and proclaimed her to be Venerable on 10 July 1990. A miracle was investigated and the process was ratified on 12 April 1991. Medical experts approved this miracle on 25 February 1993 as did theologians on 2 July and the C.C.S. on 16 November. John Paul II approved it on 23 December 1993 and beatified her on 29 October 1995 in Saint Peter's Basilica. The miracle that led to her beatification was the cure of Bernard Pochon in 1940.\n\nThe second miracle needed for her canonization was investigated and the process closed on 27 May 2014; this alleged miracle involves a girl from 1998 who was saved after what would have been a fatal tractor accident had her grandfather not invoked the intercession of the Blessed. The documents on the miracle were submitted to Rome. The C.C.S. issued a decree that validated this medical investigation on 1 October 2015.\n\nThe current postulator for this cause is the Dominican priest Bernard Hodel.\n\n"}

He attended school in Sarajevo and studied law at the University of Zagreb. In 1912, he was arrested by Austro-Hungarian authorities over his alleged role in the attempted assassination of Slavko Cuvaj, Croatian ban (viceroy).\n\nBudak and Vladko Maček served as lawyers representing Marko Hranilović and Matija Soldin at trial amid the January 6th Dictatorship. On 7 June 1932, he survived an assassination attempt by operatives close to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Afterwards, he migrated to Italy to join the Ustaše and become the commander of an Ustaše training camp. In 1938, he returned to Zagreb where he began publishing the weekly newspaper \"Hrvatski narod\". In 1940, the authorities banned the newspaper and he was arrested. On 31 March 1941, in a joint letter to Hitler, Pavelić and Budak asked him \"to help Croatian people establish an independent Croatian state that would encompass the old Croatian regions, among them Bosnia and Herzegovina\".\n\nWhen the Independent State of Croatia was proclaimed, Budak became the state's chief propagandist and Minister of Education and Faith. As such, he publicly stated that forcible expulsion and religious conversion of the ethnic Serb minority was the official national policy. Budak signed the Ustashe regime's racial laws against Serbs, Jews, and Roma. Croatian novelist Miroslav Krleža described Budak as \"a minister of culture with a machine gun\". In a speech in Gospić on 22 July 1941, he declared: \"The movement of the Ustashi is based on faith. For the minorities we have three million bullets. We shall kill one part of the Serbs, expel the second part, and convert to Catholicism the third part of them\" This exposition of Ustaše policy is attributed to Budak.\n\nHe later became Croatian envoy to Nazi Germany (November 1941 – April 1943) and foreign minister (May 1943 – November 1943). When the Independent State of Croatia collapsed, Budak was captured by British military authorities and handed over to Tito's Partisans on 18 May 1945. He was court-martialled (before the military court of the 2nd Yugoslav army) in Zagreb on 6 June 1945 and was sentenced to death by hanging the same day. His execution the following day took place exactly 13 years after the assassination attempt on his life. During the trial, Budak claimed he was not guilty of anything.\n\nBudak was known for his literary work, especially novels and plays in which he had glorified Croatian peasantry. His works included \"Ognjište\" (\"The Hearth\"), \"Opanci dida Vidurine\" (\"Grandpa Vidurina's Shoes\"), \"Rascvjetana trešnja\" (\"The Blossoming Cherry Tree\").\n\nAbout Budak's writing, E.E. Noth wrote: \"Here we find the stubborn, spiritual-realistic conception of man and his relation to the soil on which he lives and which Mile Budak symbolizes as 'the hearth'\".\n\nAfter the war his books were banned by Yugoslav Communist authorities. Thus, many Croatian nationalists viewed Budak as a great figure of Croatian literature, equal, if not superior to the leftist Miroslav Krleža. Following Croatian independence in the early 1990s, the Croatian Democratic Union badly wanted to reinterpret the fascist Ustasha quislings of World War II as a Croatian patriotic force. \"Hence, the reissue in early 1993 of the collected works of Mile Budak,the second-in-command in the Ustasha regime. Commenting, at the time of this reissue, Croatian writer Giancarlo Kravar wrote: \"... Ustashism, in its history, was undoubtly also a positive political movement for the state-building affirmation of Croatianism, the expression of the centuries-long aspiration of the Croatian people\"\n\nFor others, Budak was \"a mediocre Croatian author\", \"a mediocre writer at best\", \"a writer of middling originality and imagination\" or a writer which literary work is \"average and without lasting value\".\n\nAs of August 2004, there were seventeen cities in Croatia which had streets named after Budak. As of August 2012, at least one street in Bosnia and Herzegovina is named after Budak (in Mostar). The Archdiocese of Zagreb declared at one point that it had no objection to the erection of a monument dedicated to the dead Ustaša leader.\n"}

{"id": "1095179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1095179", "title": "Muggletonianism", "text": "Muggletonianism\n\nThe Muggletonians, named after Lodowicke Muggleton, were a small Protestant Christian movement which began in 1651 when two London tailors announced they were the last prophets foretold in the biblical Book of Revelation. The group grew out of the Ranters and in opposition to the Quakers. Muggletonian beliefs include a hostility to philosophical reason, a scriptural understanding of how the universe works and a belief that God appeared directly on Earth as Jesus Christ. A consequential belief is that God takes no notice of everyday events on Earth and will not generally intervene until it is meant to bring the world to an end.\n\nMuggletonians avoided all forms of worship or preaching, and met only for discussion and socializing. The movement was egalitarian, apolitical and pacifist, and resolutely avoided evangelism. Members attained a degree of public notoriety by cursing those who reviled their faith. This practice ceased in the mid-nineteenth century. One of the last to be cursed was the novelist Sir Walter Scott.\n\nThe faith attracted public attention in 1979 when Philip Noakes left the entire Muggletonian archive of correspondence, general papers and publications to the British Library.\n\nThe movement was born on 3 February 1651 (old style) when a London tailor, John Reeve, received a commission from God \"to the hearing of the ear as a man speaks to a friend.\" Reeve was told four things:\nReeve believed that he and his cousin, Lodowicke Muggleton, were the two witnesses spoken of in the third verse of the eleventh chapter of the Book of Revelation. After Reeve's death Muggleton had a brief struggle for control of the group with Laurence Clarkson, a former Ranter, and subsequently with those followers of John Reeve who did not accept Muggleton's authority.\n\nThe Muggletonians emphasized the Millennium and the Second Coming of Christ, and believed, among other things, that the soul is mortal; that Jesus is God (and not a member of a Trinity); that when Jesus died there was no God in Heaven, and Moses and Elijah looked after Heaven until Jesus' resurrection; that Heaven is six miles above Earth; that God is between five and six feet tall; and that any external religious ceremony is not necessary. Some scholars think that Muggletonian doctrine may have influenced the work of the artist and poet William Blake.\n\nRecent attempts have been made to locate the movement within earlier intellectual traditions, most notably the Eternal Gospel of Joachim of Fiore. However, Dr Marjorie Reeves has examined the evidence and concludes \"the case for a recognisable Joachimist influence among seventeenth-century English prophets falls to the ground.\" There had been at least one earlier appearance of a claim about the Two Last Witnesses, which John Reeve knew about.\n\nThe six principles of Muggletonianism were perhaps best set out by George Williamson, a Roman Catholic who visited the London Muggletonians in 1913: \n\nThese principles derive from Lodowicke Muggleton, who would have added one other matter as being of equal importance, namely, that God takes no immediate notice of doings in this world. If people sin, it is against their own consciences and not because God \"catches them at it\". \n\nJohn Reeve's formulation also included pacifism and the doctrine of the two seeds (see below). \n\nAccording to Rev Dr Alexander Gordon of Belfast, \"The system of belief is a singular union of opinions which seem diametrically opposed. It is rationalistic on one side, credulous on another.\"\n\nMuggletonianism was profoundly materialist. Matter pre-existed even the creation of our universe; nothing can be created from nothing. God, identified as the Holy One of Israel, is a being with a glorified body, in appearance much like a man. There can never be a spirit without a body. A purely spiritual deity, lacking any locus, would be an absurdity (so Muggletonians vehemently told the Quakers) incapable of action in a material world. The man Christ Jesus was not sent from God but was the very God appearing on this earth. Speculation about a divine nature and a human nature, or about the Trinity, is not in error so much as unnecessary. At worst, John Reeve said, it encourages people to ascribe to the deity a whole ragbag of inconsistent human attributes expressed as superlatives. Or, as Thomas Tomkinson drily remarked, it tends to give you a father of justice just when you most wanted a son of mercy.\n\nReason stems from desire and lack. Reason is not seen as a sublime mental process but as a rather shoddy trick humans use to try to get what they misguidedly imagine they want. Angels are creatures of Pure Reason because their only desire is for God so that their lack will be totally satisfied over and over again. The reprobate angel was not at fault. God deliberately chose to deprive this angel of satisfaction so that, by his fall, the other angels would become aware that their perfection came from God and not from their own natures. \n\nProfessor Lamont sees 17th century Muggletonianism as an early form of liberation theology. Because there are no spirits without bodies, there can be no ghosts, no witches, no grounds for fear and superstition and no all-seeing eye of God. Once persons are contented in their faith, they are free to speculate as they please on all other matters. God will take no notice. And Muggletonian meetings did just that.\n\nThe Muggletonian canon is generally taken to comprise:\nHowever, Muggletonians had a distaste for scriptural literalism. One of the purposes of the third commission was to make clear what was previously held obscure in scripture. Their approach to scripture incorporated quite explicit interpretation and separated texts into positive and privative.\n\nProfessor Lamont styles the Muggletonians \"disorganized religion\". They held no annual conferences, never organised a single public meeting, seem to have escaped every official register or census of religion, never incorporated, never instituted a friendly society, never appointed a leader, spokesperson, editorial board, chairperson for meetings or a single committee. Their sole foray into bureaucracy was to appoint trustees for their investment, the income from which paid the rent on the London Reading Room between 1869 and 1918. Philip Noakes may not have been the last Muggletonian, but he was certainly the last trustee.\n\nMuggletonian meetings were simple comings-together of individuals who appeared to feel that discussion with like-minded believers helped clarify their own thoughts. \"Nothing in the Muggletonian history becomes it more than its fidelity to open debate (though sometimes rancorous).\"\n\nRecords and correspondence show that meetings took place from the 1650s to 1940 in London and for almost as long in Derbyshire. Regular meetings occurred at other places at other times. Bristol, Cork, Faversham and Nottingham are among those known, and there were many others, especially in East Anglia and Kent. \n\nIn both London and Derbyshire two types of meeting were held. There were regular discussion meetings and there were holiday meetings of a more celebratory nature held in mid-February (to commemorate the start of the Third Commission) and at the end of July (to remember Muggleton's release from imprisonment). \n\nThere remains a description of a Muggletonian holiday meeting held at the Reading Room at 7 New Street, London on February 14, 1869. There were about 40 members present, of whom slightly more than half were men. One quarter were said to have been born into the faith. Tea was served at 5 o'clock. Discussion continued until 6 when a lady sang \"Arise, My Soul, Arise\" one of the Muggletonian divine songs. Then a large bowl of port negus with slices of lemon was served and a toast enjoined to absent friends. More songs were sung by each who volunteered. Beer was brought in and supper served at half past eight. \"It was a plain substantial meal; consisting of a round of beef, a ham, cheese, butter, bread and beer. Throughout the evening, every one seemed heartily to enjoy himself or herself, with no lack of friendliness, but with complete decorum.\" No speeches were made. \"By ten o'clock all were on their way homeward.\"\n\nThere is also an account for a far older holiday meeting which Lodowicke Muggleton and his daughter, Sarah, attended in July 1682 at the Green Man pub in Holloway, then a popular rural retreat to the north of London. In addition to a goodly meal with wine and beer, a quartern of tobacco, one-fifth of a pound, was gotten through and a shilling paid out to \"ye man of the bowling green\".\n\nOutside of holiday times, meetings seem to have altered little with time and place. They comprised discussion, readings and songs. There was no public worship, no instruction, no prayer. There is no record of any participant being moved by the spirit. Until mid-Victorian times, London meetings were held in the back rooms of pubs. In the early days, this is said to have provided an appearance of outward conformity with the Conventicle Acts 1664 and 1667. The meeting would look and sound to outsiders like a private or family party. Nothing would advertise religious observance. By 1869, pub life had become irksome and the London congregation obtained their first Reading Room at 7 New Street, which was reckoned to be built on the former site of Lodowicke Muggleton's birthplace, Walnut Tree Yard. This was made possible by legacies from Catherine Peers, Joseph Gandar and the Frost family; all of whom had been active in the faith. The money invested in government stock yielded sufficient income to pay the rent and the wages of a live-in caretaker who, for most of the Victorian period, was an unemployed shoe-repairer named Thomas Robinson. 7 New Street is perhaps the only site with Muggletonian connections still extant. However, it may require considerable historical imagination from the modern passer-by to gain a mental picture of what it would have been like in Victorian times. Then, the area was full of warehouses and factories, not the smart, professional consultancies of today. For his visit in 1913, Williamson tellingly describes it as being \"in the East End\".\n\nBy May 1918, wartime inflation seems to have undermined the Victorian financial settlement. The Muggletonians moved to cheaper rented premises not far away at 74 Worship Street, to the north of Finsbury Square. They remained there until probably the autumn of 1940 when the building was destroyed by a firebomb during the London Blitz. This was the event which led to the transfer of the Muggletonian archive to Mr Noakes' farm in Kent. As a fruit farmer, Mr Noakes received a petrol ration to take his produce to Covent Garden market in central London. On the return journey, the archive was packed into the empty boxes and taken to safety.\n\nJohn Reeve reports that only he was told of his Commission by the word of God. Yet two persons, Lodowicke Muggleton and John Reeve, are appointed the Last Witnesses to fulfill the prophecy of Revelation 11:3 where no distinction is drawn between one witness and the other. John Reeve introduces a distinction of his own. \"And I have given thee Lodowicke Muggleton to be thy mouth: at that very moment the holy spirit brought into my mind that scripture of Aaron given unto Moses.\" Whilst Reeve was alive, we have no evidence that anyone took Lodowicke Muggleton very seriously except as Reeve's assistant. At their blasphemy trial in 1653, The Recorder of London, after examining John Reeve, turns to Muggleton and says, \"Let Aaron speak\". Certainly, Muggleton appears to have written nothing whilst Reeve was alive. After first attempting to take control, Clarkson eventually submitted to Muggleton completely, even agreeing to give up writing and keeping that promise.\n\nRevelation say the Two Witnesses:\n\nMuggleton and Reeve's two predecessors, the weavers Richard Farnham and John Bull, did try to live out their script particularly in their role as bringers of plagues. However, there is no evidence that John Reeve and Lodowicke Muggleton felt in any way obliged to follow suit. Contemporaries did comment adversely upon this, especially upon the death of Reeve from all-too-natural causes followed by his equally mundane funeral at the New Bethlehem Burial grounds.\n\nThe Muggletonians had a belief that they could damn and bless according to the will of God and the apparent success of such damning (apparently resulting in the death of certain religious, mainly Quaker, opponents) brought the sect great notoriety. A vigorous tract war ensued with their Quaker opponents that lasted until the death of Muggleton.\n\nWilliam Maitland's 1739 edition of \"A History of London\" gives two Muggletonian meeting-places. One, for the Southwark congregation, is in Barnaby Street. The other, for the Aldersgate congregation, is in Old Street Square. Presumably, both of these were public houses, rented rooms or private homes as no dedicated meeting room existed before 1869.\n\nIn \"The Making of the English Working Class\" E. P. Thompson says, \"The Muggletonians (or followers of Ludovic Muggleton) were still preaching in the fields and parks of London at the end of the eighteenth century.\" Those Muggletons whose lives we know about would have rejected preaching as pointless and spiritually dangerous. Were there other groups of Muggletonians who operated differently? At present, historians cannot answer, but the possibility is there. Firstly, other denominations of that era, such as Methodists and Baptists, existed in a profusion of forms as E. P. Thompson's own index shows. Secondly, contact between those Muggletonians about whom we do know was sporadic, at best. \"For example, those in Derbyshire were ignorant of the existence of any persons entertaining the same faith in London until one of their number removed thither to seek employment and, after residing there a short time, heard of the London bretheren by mere accident.\" Thirdly, the name existed widely in the public domain without much knowledge of what it meant. Sir Walter Scott received eternal damnation for his ignorant remarks in \"Woodstock\". Charles Dickens incorporates All-Muggleton into \"Pickwick Papers\". A character called Mrs Snowdrop in Douglas William Jerrold's \"Nell Gwynne\" (1833) says, \"Nothing now will serve her but to go upon the stage. Tisn't my fault. I'm sure I put the pious Mr Muggleton under her pillow every night.\" So everyone thought they knew what a Muggletonian was.\n\nDuring the nineteenth century this formerly non-proselytizing Protestant sect became increasingly vocal and published several books intended for general audiences. In 1846, for example, the Muggletonian Isaac Frost published \"Two Systems of Astronomy\", a lavishly illustrated book outlining the anti-Newtonian cosmology of the Muggletonians. This activity arose from the activity of the Frost brothers (Joseph and Isaac) who having made their fortune in the Derby Brass Foundry business proceeded to spend significant sums on publicising their sect once the family moved to London. A great quantity of books were published but very few were actually sold.\n\nNotable Muggletonian writers include Laurence Clarkson (1615–1667) an itinerant preacher born in Preston, Lancashire; John Saddington (1634? – 1679) a London sugar merchant, originally from Arnesby, Leicestershire; Thomas Tomkinson (1631–1710) a Staffordshire yeoman farmer who moved to London in the 1680s; and Isaac Frost (1793–1858) and Joseph Frost (1791–1857), brothers who ran the family metallurgy business in Clerkenwell, London. Also deserving mention is Alexander Delamaine (died 1687), a wealthy London tobacco merchant who began \"The Great Book\" in 1682, which became the Muggletonian archive.\n\nThe group survived into the twentieth century. The last Muggletonian, Philip Noakes of Matfield, Kent, died on 26 February 1979; the sect's records, which he had kept, were then transferred to the British Library. The published works of the Muggletonian Brethren are still available from Gage Postal Books of Westcliffe-on-Sea, Essex.\n\nThere may be another archive still to be found. Mrs Louise Barnes of Buffalo, NY, wrote to London in 1936 about the US Muggletonian archive kept by her father, the late Alfred Hall. This collection was clearly treasured, mainly for family reasons. It may still exist.\n\n\"In Edward Thompson's words, Muggletonianism was a 'highly intellectual anti-intellectualism', and as such remarkably well adapted for survival among the semi-educated, self-taught, self-confident London artisans of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23672", "title": "Parthenon", "text": "Parthenon\n\nThe Parthenon (; ; , \"Parthenónas\") is a former temple on the Athenian Acropolis, Greece, dedicated to the goddess Athena, whom the people of Athens considered their patron. Construction began in 447 BC when the Athenian Empire was at the peak of its power. It was completed in 438 BC, although decoration of the building continued until 432 BC. It is the most important surviving building of Classical Greece, generally considered the zenith of the Doric order. Its decorative sculptures are considered some of the high points of Greek art. The Parthenon is regarded as an enduring symbol of Ancient Greece, Athenian democracy and Western civilization, and one of the world's greatest cultural monuments. To the Athenians who built it, the Parthenon and other Periclean monuments of the Acropolis were seen fundamentally as a celebration of Hellenic victory over the Persian invaders and as a thanksgiving to the gods for that victory. As of 2007 the Greek Ministry of Culture was carrying out a programme of selective restoration and reconstruction to ensure the stability of the partially ruined structure.\n\nThe Parthenon itself replaced an older temple of Athena, which historians call the Pre-Parthenon or Older Parthenon, that was destroyed in the Persian invasion of 480 BC. The temple is archaeoastronomically aligned to the Hyades. Like most Greek temples, the Parthenon served a practical purpose as the city treasury. For a time, it served as the treasury of the Delian League, which later became the Athenian Empire. In the final decade of the sixth century AD, the Parthenon was converted into a Christian church dedicated to the Virgin Mary.\n\nAfter the Ottoman conquest, it was turned into a mosque in the early 1460s. On 26 September 1687, an Ottoman ammunition dump inside the building was ignited by Venetian bombardment. The resulting explosion severely damaged the Parthenon and its sculptures. From 1800 to 1803, Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin removed some of the surviving sculptures with the alleged permission by the Turks of the Ottoman Empire. These sculptures, now known as the Elgin Marbles or the Parthenon Marbles, were sold in 1816 to the British Museum in London, where they are now displayed. Since 1983 (on the initiative of Culture Minister Melina Mercouri), the Greek government has been committed to the return of the sculptures to Greece.\n\nThe origin of the Parthenon's name is from the Greek word παρθενών (\"parthenon\"), which referred to the \"unmarried women's apartments\" in a house and in the Parthenon's case seems to have been used at first only for a particular room of the temple; it is debated which room this is and how the room acquired its name. The Liddell–Scott–Jones \"Greek–English Lexicon\" states that this room was the western cella of the Parthenon, as does J.B. Bury. Jamauri D. Green holds that the parthenon was the room in which the peplos presented to Athena at the Panathenaic Festival was woven by the \"arrephoroi\", a group of four young girls chosen to serve Athena each year. Christopher Pelling asserts that Athena Parthenos may have constituted a discrete cult of Athena, intimately connected with, but not identical to, that of Athena Polias. According to this theory, the name of the Parthenon means the \"temple of the virgin goddess\" and refers to the cult of Athena Parthenos that was associated with the temple. The epithet \"parthénos\" () meant \"maiden, girl\", but also \"virgin, unmarried woman\" and was especially used for Artemis, the goddess of wild animals, the hunt, and vegetation, and for Athena, the goddess of strategy and tactics, handicraft, and practical reason. It has also been suggested that the name of the temple alludes to the maidens (\"parthenoi\"), whose supreme sacrifice guaranteed the safety of the city. \"Parthénos\" has also been applied to the Virgin Mary, Parthénos Maria, and the Parthenon had been converted to a Christian church dedicated to the Virgin Mary in the final decade of the sixth century.\n\nThe first instance in which \"Parthenon\" definitely refers to the entire building is found in the writings of the 4th century BC orator Demosthenes. In 5th-century building accounts, the structure is simply called \"ho naos\" (\"the temple\"). The architects Iktinos and Callicrates are said to have called the building \"Hekatompedos\" (\"the hundred footer\") in their lost treatise on Athenian architecture, and, in the 4th century and later, the building was referred to as the \"Hekatompedos\" or the \"Hekatompedon\" as well as the Parthenon; the 1st-century-AD writer Plutarch referred to the building as the \"Hekatompedos Parthenon\".\n\nBecause the Parthenon was dedicated to the Greek goddess Athena, it has sometimes been referred to as the Temple of Minerva, the Roman name for Athena, particularly during the 19th century.\n\nAlthough the Parthenon is architecturally a temple and is usually called so, it is not really one in the conventional sense of the word. A small shrine has been excavated within the building, on the site of an older sanctuary probably dedicated to Athena as a way to get closer to the goddess, but the Parthenon never hosted the cult of Athena Polias, patron of Athens: the cult image, which was bathed in the sea and to which was presented the \"peplos\", was an olivewood \"xoanon\", located at an older altar on the northern side of the Acropolis.\n\nThe colossal statue of Athena by Phidias was not related to any cult and is not known to have inspired any religious fervour. It did not seem to have any priestess, altar or cult name.\nAccording to Thucydides, Pericles once referred to the statue as a gold reserve, stressing that it \"contained forty talents of pure gold and it was all removable\".\nThe Athenian statesman thus implies that the metal, obtained from contemporary coinage, could be used again without any impiety.\nThe Parthenon should then be viewed as a grand setting for Phidias' votive statue rather than a cult site. It is said in many writings of the Greeks that there were many treasures stored inside the temple, such as Persian swords and small statue figures made of precious metals.\n\nArchaeologist Joan Breton Connelly has recently argued for the coherency of the Parthenon’s sculptural programme in presenting a succession of genealogical narratives that track Athenian identity back through the ages: from the birth of Athena, through cosmic and epic battles, to the final great event of the Athenian Bronze Age, the war of Erechtheus and Eumolpos. She argues a pedagogical function for the Parthenon’s sculptured decoration, one that establishes and perpetuates Athenian foundation myth, memory, values and identity. While some classicists, including Mary Beard, Peter Green, and Garry Wills have doubted or rejected Connelly's thesis, an increasing number of historians, archaeologists, and classical scholars support her work. They include: J.J. Pollitt, Brunilde Ridgway, Nigel Spivey, Caroline Alexander, A.E. Stallings.\n\nThe first endeavour to build a sanctuary for on the site of the present Parthenon was begun shortly after the Battle of Marathon (c. 490–488 BC) upon a solid limestone foundation that extended and levelled the southern part of the Acropolis summit. This building replaced a \"hekatompedon\" (meaning \"hundred-footer\") and would have stood beside the archaic temple dedicated to \"Athena Polias\" (\"of the city\"). The Older or Pre-Parthenon, as it is frequently referred to, was still under construction when the Persians sacked the city in 480 BC and razed the Acropolis.\n\nThe existence of both the proto-Parthenon and its destruction were known from Herodotus, and the drums of its columns were plainly visible built into the curtain wall north of the Erechtheion. Further physical evidence of this structure was revealed with the excavations of Panagiotis Kavvadias of 1885–90. The findings of this dig allowed Wilhelm Dörpfeld, then director of the German Archaeological Institute, to assert that there existed a distinct substructure to the original Parthenon, called Parthenon I by Dörpfeld, not immediately below the present edifice as had been previously assumed. Dörpfeld's observation was that the three steps of the first Parthenon consisted of two steps of Poros limestone, the same as the foundations, and a top step of Karrha limestone that was covered by the lowest step of the Periclean Parthenon. This platform was smaller and slightly to the north of the final Parthenon, indicating that it was built for a wholly different building, now completely covered over. This picture was somewhat complicated by the publication of the final report on the 1885–90 excavations, indicating that the substructure was contemporary with the Kimonian walls, and implying a later date for the first temple.\n\nIf the original Parthenon was indeed destroyed in 480, it invites the question of why the site was left a ruin for thirty-three years. One argument involves the oath sworn by the Greek allies before the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC declaring that the sanctuaries destroyed by the Persians would not be rebuilt, an oath from which the Athenians were only absolved with the Peace of Callias in 450. The mundane fact of the cost of reconstructing Athens after the Persian sack is at least as likely a cause. However, the excavations of Bert Hodge Hill led him to propose the existence of a second Parthenon, begun in the period of Kimon after 468 BC. Hill claimed that the Karrha limestone step Dörpfeld thought was the highest of Parthenon I was in fact the lowest of the three steps of Parthenon II, whose stylobate dimensions Hill calculated at .\n\nOne difficulty in dating the proto-Parthenon is that at the time of the 1885 excavation the archaeological method of seriation was not fully developed; the careless digging and refilling of the site led to a loss of much valuable information. An attempt to discuss and make sense of the potsherds found on the Acropolis came with the two-volume study by Graef and Langlotz published in 1925–33. This inspired American archaeologist William Bell Dinsmoor to attempt to supply limiting dates for the temple platform and the five walls hidden under the re-terracing of the Acropolis. Dinsmoor concluded that the latest possible date for Parthenon I was no earlier than 495 BC, contradicting the early date given by Dörpfeld. Further, Dinsmoor denied that there were two proto-Parthenons, and held that the only pre-Periclean temple was what Dörpfeld referred to as Parthenon II. Dinsmoor and Dörpfeld exchanged views in the \"American Journal of Archaeology\" in 1935.\n\nIn the mid-5th century BC, when the Athenian Acropolis became the seat of the Delian League and Athens was the greatest cultural centre of its time, Pericles initiated an ambitious building project that lasted the entire second half of the century. The most important buildings visible on the Acropolis today — the Parthenon, the Propylaia, the Erechtheion and the temple of Athena Nike — were erected during this period. The Parthenon was built under the general supervision of the artist Phidias, who also had charge of the sculptural decoration. The architects Ictinos and Callicrates began their work in 447 BC, and the building was substantially completed by 432, but work on the decorations continued until at least 431.\n\nThe Parthenon is a peripteral octastyle Doric temple with Ionic architectural features. It stands on a platform or stylobate of three steps. In common with other Greek temples, it is of post and lintel construction and is surrounded by columns (\"peripteral\") carrying an entablature. There are eight columns at either end (\"octastyle\") and seventeen on the sides. There is a double row of columns at either end. The colonnade surrounds an inner masonry structure, the \"cella\", which is divided into two compartments. At either end of the building the gable is finished with a triangular pediment originally occupied by sculpted figures. The columns are of the Doric order, with simple capitals, fluted shafts and no bases. Above the architrave of the entablature is a frieze of carved pictorial panels (metopes), separated by formal architectural triglyphs, typical of the Doric order. Around the cella and across the lintels of the inner columns runs a continuous sculptured frieze in low relief. This element of the architecture is Ionic in style rather than Doric.\n\nMeasured at the stylobate, the dimensions of the base of the Parthenon are . The cella was 29.8 metres long by 19.2 metres wide (97.8 × 63.0 ft). On the exterior, the Doric columns measure in diameter and are high. The corner columns are slightly larger in diameter. The Parthenon had 46 outer columns and 23 inner columns in total, each column containing 20 flutes. (A flute is the concave shaft carved into the column form.) The roof was covered with large overlapping marble tiles known as imbrices and tegulae.\n\nThe Parthenon is regarded as the finest example of Greek architecture. The temple, wrote John Julius Cooper, \"enjoys the reputation of being the most perfect Doric temple ever built. Even in antiquity, its architectural refinements were legendary, especially the subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the naos walls and the \"entasis\" of the columns.\" \"Entasis\" refers to the slight swelling, of , in the centre of the columns to counteract the appearance of columns having a waist, as the swelling makes them look straight from a distance. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in many other classical Greek temples, it has a slight parabolic upward curvature intended to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. The columns might therefore be supposed to lean outwards, but they actually lean slightly inwards so that if they carried on, they would meet almost exactly a mile above the centre of the Parthenon; since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the architrave and roof above: \"All follow the rule of being built to delicate curves\", Gorham Stevens observed when pointing out that, in addition, the west front was built at a slightly higher level than that of the east front.\n\nIt is not universally agreed what the intended effect of these \"optical refinements\" was; they may serve as a sort of \"reverse optical illusion\". As the Greeks may have been aware, two parallel lines appear to bow, or curve outward, when intersected by converging lines. In this case, the ceiling and floor of the temple may seem to bow in the presence of the surrounding angles of the building. Striving for perfection, the designers may have added these curves, compensating for the illusion by creating their own curves, thus negating this effect and allowing the temple to be seen as they intended. It is also suggested that it was to enliven what might have appeared an inert mass in the case of a building without curves, but the comparison ought to be, according to Smithsonian historian Evan Hadingham, with the Parthenon's more obviously curved predecessors than with a notional rectilinear temple.\n\nSome studies of the Acropolis, including the Parthenon, conclude that many of its proportions approximate the golden ratio. The Parthenon's façade as well as elements of its façade and elsewhere can be circumscribed by golden rectangles. This view that the golden ratio was employed in the design has been disputed in more recent studies.\n\nThe cella of the Parthenon housed the chryselephantine statue of Athena Parthenos sculpted by Phidias and dedicated in 439 or 438 BC. The appearance of this is known from other images. The decorative stonework was originally highly coloured. The temple was dedicated to Athena at that time, though construction continued until almost the beginning of the Peloponnesian War in 432. By the year 438, the sculptural decoration of the Doric metopes on the frieze above the exterior colonnade, and of the Ionic frieze around the upper portion of the walls of the cella, had been completed. In the \"opisthodomus\" (the back room of the cella) were stored the monetary contributions of the Delian League, of which Athens was the leading member.\n\nOnly a very small number of the sculptures remain \"in situ\"; most of the surviving sculptures are today (controversially) in the British Museum in London as the Elgin Marbles, and the Athens Acropolis Museum, but a few pieces are also in the Louvre, and museums in Rome, Vienna and Palermo.\n\nThe frieze of the Parthenon's entablature contained ninety-two metopes, fourteen each on the east and west sides, thirty-two each on the north and south sides. They were carved in high relief, a practice employed until then only in treasuries (buildings used to keep votive gifts to the gods). According to the building records, the metope sculptures date to the years 446–440 BC. The metopes of the east side of the Parthenon, above the main entrance, depict the Gigantomachy (the mythical battle between the Olympian gods and the Giants). The metopes of the west end show the Amazonomachy (the mythical battle of the Athenians against the Amazons). The metopes of the south side show the Thessalian Centauromachy (battle of the Lapiths aided by Theseus against the half-man, half-horse Centaurs). Metopes 13–21 are missing, but drawings from 1674 attributed to Jaques Carrey indicate a series of humans; these have been variously interpreted as scenes from the Lapith wedding, scenes from the early history of Athens and various myths. On the north side of the Parthenon, the metopes are poorly preserved, but the subject seems to be the sack of Troy.\n\nThe metopes present examples of the Severe Style in the anatomy of the figures' heads, in the limitation of the corporal movements to the contours and not to the muscles, and in the presence of pronounced veins in the figures of the Centauromachy. Several of the metopes still remain on the building, but, with the exception of those on the northern side, they are severely damaged. Some of them are located at the Acropolis Museum, others are in the British Museum, and one is at the Louvre museum.\n\nIn March 2011, archaeologists announced that they had discovered five metopes of the Parthenon in the south wall of the Acropolis, which had been extended when the Acropolis was used as a fortress. According to \"Eleftherotypia\" daily, the archaeologists claimed the metopes had been placed there in the 18th century when the Acropolis wall was being repaired. The experts discovered the metopes while processing 2,250 photos with modern photographic methods, as the white Pentelic marble they are made of differed from the other stone of the wall. It was previously presumed that the missing metopes were destroyed during the Morosini explosion of the Parthenon in 1687.\n\nThe most characteristic feature in the architecture and decoration of the temple is the Ionic frieze running around the exterior walls of the cella, which is the inside structure of the Parthenon. The bas-relief frieze was carved in situ; it is dated to 442 BC-438 BC.\n\nOne interpretation is that it depicts an idealized version of the Panathenaic procession from the Dipylon Gate in the Kerameikos to the Acropolis. In this procession held every year, with a special procession taking place every four years, Athenians and foreigners were participating to honour the goddess Athena, offering sacrifices and a new peplos (dress woven by selected noble Athenian girls called \"ergastines\").\n\nJoan Breton Connelly offers a mythological interpretation for the frieze, one that is in harmony with the rest of the temple’s sculptural programme which shows Athenian genealogy through a series of succession myths set in the remote past. She identifies the central panel above the door of the Parthenon as the pre-battle sacrifice of the daughter of King Erechtheus, a sacrifice that ensured Athenian victory over Eumolpos and his Thracian army. The great procession marching toward the east end of the Parthenon shows the post-battle thanksgiving sacrifice of cattle and sheep, honey and water, followed by the triumphant army of Erechtheus returning from their victory. This represents the very first Panathenaia set in mythical times, the model on which historic Panathenaic processions was based.\n\nThe traveller Pausanias, when he visited the Acropolis at the end of the 2nd century AD, only mentioned briefly the sculptures of the pediments (gable ends) of the temple, reserving the majority of his description for the gold and ivory statue of the goddess inside.\n\nThe figures on the corners of the pediment depict the passage of time over the course of a full day. Tethrippa of Helios and Selene are located on the left and right corners of the pediment respectively. The horses of Helios's chariot are shown with livid expressions as they ascend into the sky at the start of the day; whereas the Selene's horses struggle to stay on the pediment scene as the day comes to an end.\n\nThe supporters of Athena are extensively illustrated at the back of the left chariot, while the defenders of Poseidon are shown trailing behind the right chariot. It is believed that the corners of the pediment are filled by Athenian water deities, such as Kephisos river, Ilissos river and nymph Callirhoe. This belief merges from the fluid character of the sculptures' body position which represents the effort of the artist to give the impression of a flowing river., Next to the left river god, there are the sculptures of the mythical king of Athens (Kekrops) with his daughters (Aglauros, Pandrosos, Herse). The statue of Poseidon was the largest sculpture in the pediment until it broke into pieces during Francesco Morosini's effort to remove it in 1688. The posterior piece of the torso was found by Lusieri in the groundwork of a Turkish house in 1801 and is currently held in British Museum. The anterior portion was revealed by Ross in 1835 and is now held in the Acropolis Museum of Athens.\n\nEvery statue in the west pediment has a fully completed back, which would have been impossible to see when the sculpture was on the temple; this indicates that the sculptors put great effort into accurately portraying the human body.\n\nThe only piece of sculpture from the Parthenon known to be from the hand of Phidias was the statue of Athena housed in the \"naos\". This massive chryselephantine sculpture is now lost and known only from copies, vase painting, gems, literary descriptions and coins.\n\nA major fire broke out in the Parthenon shortly after the middle of the third century AD which destroyed the Parthenon's roof and much of the sanctuary's interior. Heruli pirates are also credited with sacking Athens in 276, and destroying most of the public buildings there, including the Parthenon. Repairs were made in the fourth century AD, possibly during the reign of Julian the Apostate. A new wooden roof overlaid with clay tiles was installed to cover the sanctuary. It sloped at a greater incline than the original roof and left the building's wings exposed.\n\nThe Parthenon survived as a temple dedicated to Athena for nearly one thousand years until Theodosius II, during the Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire, decreed in 435 AD that all pagan temples in the Eastern Roman Empire be closed. \nHowever, it is debated exactly when during the 5th-century that the closure of the Parthenon as a temple was actually put in practice. It is suggested to have occurred in c. 481–484, in the instructions against the remaining temples by order of Emperor Zeno, because the temple had been the focus of Pagan Hellenic opposition against Zeno in Athens in support of Illus, who had promised to restore Hellenic rites to the temples that were still standing.\n\nAt some point in the fifth century, Athena's great cult image was looted by one of the emperors and taken to Constantinople, where it was later destroyed, possibly during the siege and sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade in 1204 AD.\n\nThe Parthenon was converted into a Christian church in the final decade of the sixth century AD to become the Church of the Parthenos Maria (Virgin Mary), or the Church of the Theotokos (Mother of God). The orientation of the building was changed to face towards the east; the main entrance was placed at the building's western end, and the Christian altar and iconostasis were situated towards the building's eastern side adjacent to an apse built where the temple's pronaos was formerly located. A large central portal with surrounding side-doors was made in the wall dividing the cella, which became the church's nave, from the rear chamber, the church's narthex. The spaces between the columns of the \"opisthodomus\" and the peristyle were walled up, though a number of doorways still permitted access. Icons were painted on the walls and many Christian inscriptions were carved into the Parthenon's columns. These renovations inevitably led to the removal and dispersal of some of the sculptures. Those depicting gods were either possibly re-interpreted according to a Christian theme, or removed.\n\nThe Parthenon became the fourth most important Christian pilgrimage destination in the Eastern Roman Empire after Constantinople, Ephesos, and Thessalonica. In 1018, the emperor Basil II went on a pilgrimage to Athens directly after his final victory over the Bulgarians for the sole purpose of worshipping at the Parthenon. In medieval Greek accounts it is called the Temple of Theotokos Atheniotissa and often indirectly referred to as famous without explaining exactly which temple they were referring to, thus establishing that it was indeed well known.\n\nAt the time of the Latin occupation, it became for about 250 years a Roman Catholic church of Our Lady. During this period a tower, used either as a watchtower or bell tower and containing a spiral staircase, was constructed at the southwest corner of the cella, and vaulted tombs were built beneath the Parthenon's floor.\n\nIn 1456, Ottoman Turkish forces invaded Athens and laid siege to a Florentine army defending the Acropolis until June 1458, when it surrendered to the Turks. The Turks may have briefly restored the Parthenon to the Greek Orthodox Christians for continued use as a church. Some time before the close of the fifteenth century, the Parthenon became a mosque.\n\nThe precise circumstances under which the Turks appropriated it for use as a mosque are unclear; one account states that Mehmed II ordered its conversion as punishment for an Athenian plot against Ottoman rule. The apse became a mihrab, the tower previously constructed during the Roman Catholic occupation of the Parthenon was extended upwards to become a minaret, a minbar was installed, the Christian altar and iconostasis were removed, and the walls were whitewashed to cover icons of Christian saints and other Christian imagery.\n\nDespite the alterations accompanying the Parthenon's conversion into a church and subsequently a mosque, its structure had remained basically intact. In 1667 the Turkish traveller Evliya Çelebi expressed marvel at the Parthenon's sculptures and figuratively described the building as \"like some impregnable fortress not made by human agency\". He composed a poetic supplication that it, as \"a work less of human hands than of Heaven itself, should remain standing for all time\". The French artist Jacques Carrey in 1674 visited the Acropolis and sketched the Parthenon's sculptural decorations. Early in 1687, an engineer named Plantier sketched the Parthenon for the Frenchman Graviers d’Ortières. These depictions, particularly those made by Carrey, provide important, and sometimes the only, evidence of the condition of the Parthenon and its various sculptures prior to the devastation it suffered in late 1687 and the subsequent looting of its art objects.\n\nIn 1687, the Parthenon was extensively damaged in the greatest catastrophe to befall it in its long history. As part of the Great Turkish War (1683–1699), the Venetians sent an expedition led by Francesco Morosini to attack Athens and capture the Acropolis. The Ottoman Turks fortified the Acropolis and used the Parthenon as a gunpowder magazine – despite having been forewarned of the dangers of this use by the 1656 explosion that severely damaged the Propylaea – and as a shelter for members of the local Turkish community. On 26 September a Venetian mortar round, fired from the Hill of Philopappus, blew up the magazine, and the building was partly destroyed. The explosion blew out the building's central portion and caused the cella's walls to crumble into rubble. Greek architect and archaeologist Kornilia Chatziaslani writes that \"...three of the sanctuary’s four walls nearly collapsed and three-fifths of the sculptures from the frieze fell. Nothing of the roof apparently remained in place. Six columns from the south side fell, eight from the north, as well as whatever remained from eastern porch, except for one column. The columns brought down with them the enormous marble architraves, triglyphs and metopes.\" About three hundred people were killed in the explosion, which showered marble fragments over nearby Turkish defenders and caused large fires that burned until the following day and consumed many homes.\n\nAccounts written at the time conflict over whether this destruction was deliberate or accidental; one such account, written by the German officer Sobievolski, states that a Turkish deserter revealed to Morosini the use to which the Turks had put the Parthenon; expecting that the Venetians would not target a building of such historic importance. Morosini was said to have responded by directing his artillery to aim at the Parthenon. Subsequently, Morosini sought to loot sculptures from the ruin and caused further damage in the process. Sculptures of Poseidon and Athena's horses fell to the ground and smashed as his soldiers tried to detach them from the building's west pediment.\n\nThe following year, the Venetians abandoned Athens to avoid a confrontation with a large force the Turks had assembled at Chalcis; at that time, the Venetians had considered blowing up what remained of the Parthenon along with the rest of the Acropolis to deny its further use as a fortification to the Turks, but that idea was not pursued.\n\nAfter the Turks had recaptured the Acropolis they used some of the rubble produced by this explosion to erect a smaller mosque within the shell of the ruined Parthenon. For the next century and a half, portions of the remaining structure were looted for building material and any remaining objects of value.\n\nThe 18th century was a period of Ottoman stagnation; as a result, many more Europeans found access to Athens, and the picturesque ruins of the Parthenon were much drawn and painted, spurring a rise in philhellenism and helping to arouse sympathy in Britain and France for Greek independence. Amongst those early travellers and archaeologists were James Stuart and Nicholas Revett, who were commissioned by the Society of Dilettanti to survey the ruins of classical Athens. What they produced was the first measured drawings of the Parthenon published in 1787 in the second volume of \"Antiquities of Athens Measured and Delineated\". In 1801, the British Ambassador at Constantinople, the Earl of Elgin, obtained a questionable \"firman\" (edict) from the Sultan, whose existence or legitimacy has not been proved until today, to make casts and drawings of the antiquities on the Acropolis, to demolish recent buildings if this was necessary to view the antiquities, and to remove sculptures from them.\n\nWhen independent Greece gained control of Athens in 1832, the visible section of the minaret was demolished; only its base and spiral staircase up to the level of the architrave remain intact. Soon all the medieval and Ottoman buildings on the Acropolis were destroyed. However, the image of the small mosque within the Parthenon's cella has been preserved in Joly de Lotbinière's photograph, published in Lerebours's \"Excursions Daguerriennes\" in 1842: the first photograph of the Acropolis. The area became a historical precinct controlled by the Greek government. Today it attracts millions of tourists every year, who travel up the path at the western end of the Acropolis, through the restored Propylaea, and up the Panathenaic Way to the Parthenon, which is surrounded by a low fence to prevent damage.\n\nThe dispute centres around the Parthenon Marbles removed by Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin, from 1801 to 1803, which are in the British Museum. A few sculptures from the Parthenon are also in the Louvre in Paris, in Copenhagen, and elsewhere, but more than half are in the Acropolis Museum in Athens. A few can still be seen on the building itself. The Greek government has campaigned since 1983 for the British Museum to return the sculptures to Greece. The British Museum has steadfastly refused to return the sculptures, and successive British governments have been unwilling to force the Museum to do so (which would require legislation). Nevertheless, talks between senior representatives from Greek and British cultural ministries and their legal advisors took place in London on 4 May 2007. These were the first serious negotiations for several years, and there were hopes that the two sides may move a step closer to a resolution.\n\nIn 1975, the Greek government began a concerted effort to restore the Parthenon and other Acropolis structures. After some delay, a Committee for the Conservation of the Acropolis Monuments was established in 1983. The project later attracted funding and technical assistance from the European Union. An archaeological committee thoroughly documented every artifact remaining on the site, and architects assisted with computer models to determine their original locations. Particularly important and fragile sculptures were transferred to the Acropolis Museum. A crane was installed for moving marble blocks; the crane was designed to fold away beneath the roofline when not in use. In some cases, prior re-constructions were found to be incorrect. These were dismantled, and a careful process of restoration began. Originally, various blocks were held together by elongated iron H pins that were completely coated in lead, which protected the iron from corrosion. Stabilizing pins added in the 19th century were not so coated, and corroded. Since the corrosion product (rust) is expansive, the expansion caused further damage by cracking the marble.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31792531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31792531", "title": "Salakapurusa", "text": "Salakapurusa\n\nAccording to the Jain cosmology, the śalākāpuruṣa () \"illustrious or worthy persons\" are 63 illustrious beings who appear during each half-time cycle. They are also known as the \"triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣa\" (63 illustrious persons). The Jain universal or legendary history is a compilation of the deeds of these illustrious persons. Their life stories are said to be most inspiring.\n\nThe \"śalākāpuruṣa\" comprise 24 \"Tirthankaras\" (Teaching Gods), twelve Chakravartin (universal monarchs, emperors of six continents), nine Balabhadras (gentle heroes), nine \"Narayanas\" (warrior heroes) and nine \"Prati-narayanas\" (anti-heroes). According to Jain cosmology, time is without beginning and eternal. The \"Kālacakra\", the cosmic wheel of time, rotates ceaselessly. The wheel of time is divided into two half-rotations, \"Utsarpiṇī\" or ascending time cycle and \"Avasarpiṇī\", the descending time cycle, occurring continuously after each other. \"Utsarpiṇī\" is a period of progressive prosperity and happiness where the time spans and ages are at an increasing scale while the \"Avasarpiṇī\" is a period of increasing sorrow and immorality with decline in time spans of the epochs. During each such time cycle, these 63 illustrious persons appear and establish the religion and order in society. According to Jain cosmology, since time is eternal, infinite \"kalacakras\" have elapsed and will occur in future and hence infinite sets of these 63 illustrious persons have appeared, and will appear, to establish order and religion in their respective eras.\n\nThe word \"salakapurusa\" is often translated as illustrious persons or worthy persons or mighty persons. It is derived from the Sanskrit compound of words \"salaka\" and \"purusa\". \"\"Purusa\" means person, but \"salaka\"\" is of ambiguous etymology in this context. The primary meaning of the word salaka (Sanskrit: \"Śalākā\", Pali: \"salākā\", Prakrit: \"salāgā\", \"salāyā\") is \"stick\". In the Buddhist context it meant a ticket consisting of wooden sticks meant for voting or to distribute food; but in Jain context it was used to mean a stick and also a measurement and when combined with \"purusa\" to denote great heroes. According to 11th century Jain author, monk Acharya Hemachandra, these persons are called \"salaka\" as they have been specially marked among men. This emphasised that the names of the salakapurusas were underlined or specially significant due to their deeds. John Cort also quotes another author, S. D. Parekh, who emphasises the root meaning of voting sticks and concludes that a salakapurusa is a great person, as his greatness has been accepted by general public. Certain \"Śvētāmbara\" texts use the word \"Baladeva\", \"Vāsudeva\" and \"Prativasudeva\" to refer \"Balabhadra\", \"Narayana\" and \"Pratinarayana\" respectively. A 1975 treatise, detailing Mahavira's life and doctrine seems to imply the voting-etymology of the word, i.e. they are called \"salakapurusa\", because they are men-that-count.\n\nThe tradition of \"salakapurusas\" or Jain universal history started with the biographies of the Tirthankaras. Kalpasutra gives the names and brief biographies of only tirthankaras. It does not use the word \"salakapurusa\"s or mention them by name, but does say that the categories of Arihants, Chakravartins, \"Balabhadras\" and Vasudevas are always born in royal families, thus foreshadowing 54 of the 63 \"salakapurusas\". Furthermore, Jaini traces the origin of list of Baladeva and Vasudeva to the \"Jinacharitra\" (lives of the \"Jina\"s) by Bhadrabahu (3–4th century BCE). A notable hagiography of these individuals is Hemachandra's \"Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra\".\n\nThe following Jain texts chronicle the deeds of the \"salakapurusas\":\n\n\n\nAll traditions of Jainism now agree to the figure of 63 \"salakapurusas\". However, the number of persons is 60 as three persons (Shantinath, Kunthunath and Aranath) were \"Chakravartins\" who later on became \"Tirthankaras\".\n\n\"Tīrthankaras\" (also known as \"Jinas\") are \"Arhatas\" who are teachers and revivers of the Jain philosophy. There are 24 Tīrthankaras in each half time cycle; Mahāvīra was the 24th and last Tīrthankara of the current descending time cycle and Rishabha was the first Tirthankara. Tīrthankaras are literally \"the ford makers\", who have shown the way to cross the ocean of rebirth and transmigration and hence have become a focus of reverence and worship amongst Jains. The Tirthankara provides all creatures with the means to liberate the soul from the confines of the body and to rise towards bliss, enlightenment and release from the eternal cycle of rebirth. He advocates continence, truth, non-violence, simplicity and purity for those who seek liberation. Tīrthankaras ultimately become \"Siddhas\" on liberation. \n\nThe twenty four Tīrthankaras of this descending time cycle are:\n\nA Chakravartin (Universal Monarch) is the emperor of the world, lord of the material realm. Though he possesses worldly power, he often finds his ambitions dwarfed by the enormity of the cosmos. Jain purunas give a list of 12 Chakravartins who flourished in this descending time cycle. Golden in complexion, they all belonged to Kasyapa gotra. One of the greatest Chakravartis mentioned in Jain scriptures is Bharata in whose memory India came to be known as \"Bharata-varsha\". After conquering the whole world, King Bharata, brimming with pride, sought to inscribe his great feat on the slopes of Mount Meru. To his great dismay, he found the names of many other kings carved on Meru. Like him, they too had conquered the world. He was not the first man to do so. He was not the last. There were many before him, there were many after him. Bharata, humbled by the experience, returned to his kingdom to do his duty, aware that his actions were not unique and that his existence was not special. The names of the twelve Chakravartins as per Jain Texts are:\n\n\nIn Jainism, a chakravarti was characterised by possession of \"saptaratna\", or \"seven jewels\":\n\nSome texts cite \"navaratna\" or \"nine jewels\" instead, adding \"prime minister\" and \"son\". Some texts even further expands to 14 \"Ratna\", jewels.\n\nIn every half time cycle, there are 9 sets of \"Balabhadras\" (gentle heroes), \"Vasudevas\" (violent heroes) and \"Prativāsudevas\" (anti-heroes). Unlike in the Hindu Puranas, the names \"Balabhadra\" and \"Narayana\" are not restricted to Balarama and Krishna in Jain puranas. Instead they serve as names of two distinct classes of mighty half brothers, who appear nine times in each half of the time cycles of the Jain cosmology and jointly rule half the earth as half-chakravarti. Ultimately \"Prati-naryana\" is killed by \"Narayana\" for his unrighteousness and immorality. Jaini traces the origin of this list of brothers to the \"Jinacaritra\" (lives of the Jinas) by Bhadrabahu swami (3-4th century BCE). Jain Ramayana is based on the stories of Rama, Lakshmana and Ravana who are the eighth Baladeva, \"Narayana\", \"Pratinarayana\" and respectively. Similarly \"Harivamsa Purana\" is based on the stories of Balarama, Krishna and Jarasandha, who are the ninth and the last set of \"Balabhadra\", \"Narayana\", and \"Pratinarayana\". However, the main battle is not the Mahabharata, but the fight between Krishna and Jarasandha who is killed by Krishna.\n\nAccording to Jain texts, \"Narayana\" are generally of dark complexion and wear yellow garments. There are seven weapons and symbols of \"Narayana\", namely: conch, discus (sudarshana chakra), club, bow, sword, jewel (kaustubha mani) and a garland of flowers (vanamala). Baladevas, half-brothers of Vasudevas, are described as fair in complexion and wear garments of dark blue and have a banner of palm tree. Their symbols or weapons are: bow, plough, pestle and arrow. The two brothers are inseparable and they jointly rule three continents as half-Chakravarti. Although \"Narayana\" is the mightier of the two, \"Balabhadra\" is depicted as superior for his non-violent ways and he achieves liberation. According to the Jain \"puranas\", the \"Balabhadras\" lead an ideal Jain life. Out of nine \"Balabhadra\", eight attain liberation and the last one goes to heaven. On the other hand, \"Narayana\" go to hell on account of their violent exploits, even though they did these in order to uphold righteousness.\nThe list of Baladeva, Vasudeva and Prativasudeva are:\n\nOut of the above five classes of illustrious persons, Tirthankaras are placed at the top. They establish the religion and attain liberation. The Chakravarti attain liberation if they renounce their kingdom, or else go to hell if they indulge in sensual pleasures. Next in rank are Baladevas who are gentle heroes and devout laymen, who attain liberation corresponding to Tirthankaras. Vasudevas are also devout Jain laymen and ultimately attain liberation, but are first reborn in hell because of their violent actions.\n\nThe mother of a Tirthankara sees 16 auspicious dreams dreams (14 dreams in some traditions) when the soul descents into her womb. The mother of a Vasusdeva sees seven dreams, while that of a \"Balabhadra\" sees only four dreams.

The process of Saranagati forms the basis of devotion to Godhead in the bhakti traditions within the Sri Sampradaya, propagated by Ramanujacharya (1017–1137 CE) and the Gaudiya Sampradaya, founded by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1482–1533 CE). Ramanuja considered surrender to Vishnu and His consort Lakshmi to be the highest goal of life, while Chaitanya emphasizes surrender to Krishna and his consort Radha as supreme.\n\nThe formal ritual of Saranagati or Prapatti is a Vedic and Puranic, scriptural and tradition backed ritual called Pancha-Samskara or \"the five impressions\" and another name is Samashrayanam. The individual receives the following:\n\nSri Alavandhar Stotram/Stotra Ratnam by Bhagawad Sri Yamunacharya features following shloka which defines Saranagathi\n\nNa Dharma Nishthosmi Na Cha Atmavedi\nNa BhaktimansTvat Charanaravinde |\nAkinchanonanyagati Sharanyam\nTvat Padamoolam Sharanam Prapadye ||\n\nO Lord, I do not know Dharma, I do not know Dnyana, I do not have Bhakti in your divine Lotus Feet. All I have is I am Akinchan (one who does not have anything), and Ananyagati (One who is totally dependent ONLY on You). This akinchan and ananyagati soul is surrendered to your Lotus Feet. \n\nIn Sri Bhagavadgeeta Bhagawan Sri Krishna explains Saranagati to Arjuna after explaining in detail Karma, Dnyana, Bhakti Yogas. Sri Bhagawadgeeta is a saar of all the vedas, upanishads, puranaas. And The following shloka is a saar of Sri Bhagawadgeeta. This shloka being Saranagathi mantram offered by Lord Sri Krishna to Arjuna, it is regarded as one of the three divine mantras of Srivaishnavism. It is also called as Charam Mantra \n\nSarva Dharmaan Parityajya Mamekam Sharanam Vraja|\nAham tva sarva papebhyo moksha ishyami ma shuchaha||\n\nO Arjun, you relinquish all dharmas and surrender unto me.

You treat Only ME as your Sadhan (Upay/Means) if you want to attain Param Padam. I will release you from everything that obstructs you from attaining ME (may that be Papa or Punya. Even those punya or sukrut which take us away from the Lord should be treated as Papa or Agha). Do not worry I Shall even carry you to the Param Pad Dham.\n\nAlthough often used interchangeably in common parlance, Saranagati is different from Prapatti. Saranagati refers to the seeking of God as the ultimate means for liberation, whereas Prapatti is the surrender of one's ego to receive the grace of God. The surrender of one's ego through Prapatti leads to the opening up of the grace of God whereas the invocation of the always freely available grace of God through prayer disarms one's resistance to goodness. Charama Sloka (Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 18, Verse 66) describes Saranagati whereas the fourth injunction of Shri Krishna \"Ma Namaskuru\" (Prostrate to Me) in the previous verse (Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 18, Verse 65) describes Prapatti. Prapatti is necessary at the end of all yoga practices because all of them boosts the ego by giving Siddhi-s (extraordinary powers or perfections) which prevents the merger of the individual consciousness with God consciousness. Renunciation of Siddhi-s leads to Kaivalyam, that is, Liberation (Patanjali Yoga Sutra-s 3.50-52). When Arjuna surrendered to Shri Krishna at the beginning of the Bhagavad Gita partly because of weakness, there was not much merit to deserve anything in return other than the teaching that would empower him, whereas after hearing the teaching and after practicing the yoga to fulfill his responsibilities that would earn him security, wealth, fame etc., he could offer something to receive the grace. However, since it is almost always practically impossible to practice Yoga well enough to become perfect in one lifetime because of the sinful tendencies accumulated over countless births, sufferings that are endemic in this world, and temptations that always distracts one from the path, and since it is difficult for a great personality like Arjuna to be humble, Shri Krishna offers unconditionally the ultimate option of Saranagati for release, which is the dependence on Him, Who is an infinite ocean of love, omnipotent and infallible.\n\nIn Sri Vaisnava Tradition Saranagati is divided into six divisions:\n\nIn Goudiya Tradition Saranagati is Divided into ten Parts\n\nIn ultimate vaishnavism sampradhya the nutshell is\nSaranagathi has 6 elements -5 angas & an angi\nReference:The Hindu newspaper dated january08-Sunday-2017(article: tiruppavai lead us to sri vaikuntha)SpcialIssue vaikunta ekadasi\n\n"}

Little remains visible today.\nConstruction of the Temple of Claudius on the Caelian Hill was begun by Agrippina, the fourth wife of the Emperor Claudius, on his death in 54 AD. It was subsequently damaged by the Great Fire of Rome and further destroyed by Agrippina's son, Nero, but later rebuilt by the Emperor Vespasian, who became emperor in 69 AD. The destruction by Nero was probably due to his extension of the Aqua Claudia aqueduct to the Caelian Hill but part may also have been removed to make way for the construction of his Domus Aurea. The last mention of the temple is from the fourth century and nothing is known of what happened to it after Vespasian’s reconstruction. If still in use by the 4th-century, the temple would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire.\n\nThe area occupied by the Temple is approximately bounded by the present roads of Via Claudia, Viale del Parco del Celio and the Clivus Scauri. The temple stood on a great rectangular platform (180 x 200 meters), supported by powerful retaining walls of 15 metres or more, that are still partly visible. The actual temple was constructed on a podium 20 steps above the surrounding platform.\nThe entrance to the courtyard was from the south, through a monumental central entrance with an imposing stairway, oriented towards the Palatine Hill. The platform itself has been difficult for archaeologists to interpret but it is believed to have included equestrian statues of Claudius.\nThe known remains are of the four sides of the platform and nothing remains of the temple above. The western side of the platform was constructed with travertine and some remains were incorporated into the bell tower of the basilica of Santi Giovanni e Paolo. The northern side was composed of a row of vaulted rooms. During the time of Nero there were fountains and the remains of one of these, consisting of a ship's bow with a boar's head, were found and are now in the Capitoline Museums. Vespasian subsequently reduced the consumption of water, returning it to civilian use. The east side is the best preserved, and changes carried out by Nero can be noted here. The area was rediscovered when a new road, the Via Claudia, was constructed in 1880. Underneath the temple area there are tunnels through tufa that have recently been mapped by the Italian authorities.\n\n"}

The fortnightly Calgary edition () of \"The Jewish Star\" was the first independent Jewish newspaper published in that city; the monthly Edmonton edition () of \"The Jewish Star\" was the first independent Jewish newspaper published for the provincial capital. Both editions were tabloid-sized newspapers (ranging from 8 to 28 pages per issue) mailed on a controlled circulation basis to virtually all Jewish households in each city.\n\n\"The Jewish Star\" was founded by Douglas Wertheimer, who served as Editor and President of The Jewish Star Newspaper, Ltd., and Gila Wertheimer, Associate Editor, with start-up funding from family members, supporters and bank loans. The founding of the newspaper coincided with an explosion of economic growth in Alberta related to the oil industry. Calgary, known since 1945 as one of Canada’s fastest-growing cities, had undergone a population increase of 47 percent from 1971 to 1981. Meanwhile, the Calgary Jewish community had increased by 50 percent from 1975-79 to about 6,000 Jews. The two editions of the independent \"Jewish Star\" appeared at a time when the organized Jewish communities across Canada were \"moving to take over Jewish weeklies.\" Moreover, the state of Jewish journalism in Canada left \"a great deal to be desired,\" according to historian Stuart E. Rosenberg.\n\nCommenting on the start-up of the Calgary edition of \"The Jewish Star\", the \"Calgary Herald\" noted that the paper had \"avoided some of the more obvious first-issue pitfalls by using good layout, attractive printing free of typographical errors, professional writing by three international Jewish wire services and plenty of local content... there was [also] a heavy advertising content.\" After the launch of the Calgary edition (published from August 22, 1980 through June 1, 1990), the Jewish Community Council in Edmonton invited the publishers to produce a separate Edmonton Edition. It ran as a monthly from December 1980 through June 1990, utilizing some of the same content. While also independent, it received a guaranteed annual purchase of subscriptions (an arrangement voluntarily terminated by \"The Jewish Star\" in 1987).\n\nDuring the 1980s, the company was the sole independent publisher in Canada of more than one Jewish newspaper. From around 1984, it began taking on typesetting jobs, including typesetting and photographic services for William D. Peacock's \"Native Albertan\", the Italian-language newspaper \"Lo Stivale\", and D. Bercuson and D. Wertheimer's 241-page book, \"A Trust Betrayed\" (Doubleday, 1981). In the late 1980s, it made an unsuccessful attempt to purchase the \"Jewish Western Bulletin\" of Vancouver.\n\nFor the Calgary Edition, local news, editorial and advertising content were generated mainly by full-time \"Jewish Star\" staff, with other material for that edition coming from freelance writers and syndicated news services. For the Edmonton Edition, over the years a freelance writer provided local news coverage, and for most of the decade advertising was handled by the Dave Moser Agencies in that city. In 1988, controlled circulation for the Calgary edition averaged 1,900 copies, for the Edmonton edition 1,500. The editorial position of the newspapers was characterized as displaying “a small ‘l’ liberal stance,” with \"no religious axe to grind.\" \n\nIn \"A Century of the Canadian Jewish Press: 1880s-1980s\", author Lewis Levendel wrote of \"The Jewish Star\" editions, “The most exciting event in Canadian Jewish journalism in the 1980s has been the brave attempt by an Alberta couple to launch an independent newspaper... \"The Stars\" – by far the most attractive of Canadian Jewish papers – have been showered with praise for their appearance, editorials and news coverage... Outside Alberta, Jewish journalists and communal officials familiar with the \"Star\" expressed admiration for the paper”.\n\nDuring the 1980s, \"The Jewish Star\" (Calgary Edition) won more journalistic awards than any other Jewish publication in Canada. The editors won first place Rockower Awards of the American Jewish Press Association in 1982 (editorial writing) and 1984 (tied, editorial), an honorable mention in 1985 (design), and a second place award in 1987 (editorial).\n\nFrom its launching, \"The Jewish Star\" was one of only two Canadian Jewish publications to produce its own book reviews, rather than reprint syndicated columns. Gila Wertheimer, among the most prolific literary critics in the Jewish media (having reviewed 206 books in \"The Jewish Star\"), also had pieces published in \"Judaica Book News\" (New York) and Canadian Jewish newspapers.\n\nThe Calgary Jewish Community Council had published an in-house non-commercial newspaper, the \"Calgary Jewish News\", since 1962 (Douglas Wertheimer served as editor from 1979–80). For several years after the founding of the \"Calgary Jewish Star\", tension existed between the organized community and the independent newspaper, reflected in frank reporting on the community. Early editorials were critical of the organized community for allowing its Jewish community center to be opened on Shabbat and for its treatment of visiting Israeli officials, and provided a forum for others who sought change. Community officials characterized \"The Star\" as “a divisive force”. The newspaper also faulted the Canadian Jewish establishment for its dismissive attitude towards Western Canadian Jews and in particular for its stance on the rescue of Ethiopian Jews.\n\nIn general the Edmonton Edition of \"The Star\" was less controversial than its Calgary counterpart, although inevitably material upset community officials (including an article by an Israeli shaliach about the end of the Edmonton Jewish community).\n\nAt the end of 1982, a high school teacher in a small town between Calgary and Edmonton was fired for devoting classroom time to teaching the myth of the Jewish world-conspiracy. The case of Jim Keegstra of Eckville soon attracted national attention. One of the results was the testing, in court, of the hate promotion section of the Criminal Code of Canada. Beginning in April 1983 and for years afterwards, \"The Jewish Star\" covered the story, which included criticism of the handling of the case by the provincial government of Peter Lougheed, the Canadian Jewish Congress, and the \"Calgary Herald\". Utilizing that knowledge, research materials, and interviews, D. Wertheimer collaborated with University of Calgary historian David J. Bercuson on a book-length study, \"A Trust Betrayed: The Keegstra Affair\" (published by Doubleday in Canada and the US, 1985, ; Bantam Seal paperback, 1987, ). The book was called “a first rate account” in a \"Toronto Star\" review.\n\nEven before the Keegstra controversy forced the Calgary and Edmonton Jewish communities to coordinate activities, \"The Star\" endorsed a unifying Jewish council for the province, which was eventually created.\n\nBoth editions of \"The Jewish Star\" published their final issues in June 1990. In the following month the Wertheimers left Canada and started the independent \"Chicago Jewish Star\", that city’s first new Jewish newspaper published solely for that area in nearly 75 years.\n\n\n"}

A prolific author, he wrote extensively on a broad range of subjects, such as authenticity and death, moral philosophy and existentialism, theism and atheism, Christianity and Judaism, as well as philosophy and literature. He served more than 30 years as a professor at Princeton University.\n\nHe is renowned as a scholar and translator of Friedrich Nietzsche. He also wrote a 1965 book on Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and published a translation of Goethe's \"Faust\".\n\nKaufmann was raised a Lutheran. At age 11, finding that he believed neither in the Trinity nor in the divinity of Jesus, he converted to Judaism. Kaufmann subsequently discovered that his grandparents were all Jewish. Kaufmann left Germany and emigrated to America in 1939 and began studying at Williams College, where he majored in philosophy and took many religion classes. Although he had the opportunity to move immediately into his graduate studies in philosophy, and despite advice not to do so by his professors, he ultimately joined the war effort against the Nazis by serving in U.S. intelligence. During World War II, he fought on the European front for 15 months. After the war, he completed a PhD in the philosophy of religion at Harvard in a mere two years. His dissertation was titled \"Nietzsche's Theory of Values\" and eventually became a chapter in his \"\" (1950).\n\nHe spent his entire career thereafter, from 1947 to 1980, teaching philosophy at Princeton University, where his students included the Nietzsche scholars Frithjof Bergmann, Richard Schacht, Alexander Nehamas, and Ivan Soll. Kaufmann became a naturalized citizen of the United States of America in 1960.\n\nIn a 1959 article in \"Harper's Magazine\", he summarily rejected all religious values and practice, especially the liberal Protestantism of continental Europe that began with Schleiermacher and culminated in the writings of Paul Tillich and Rudolf Bultmann. In their place, he praised moralists such as the biblical prophets, the Buddha, and Socrates. He argued that critical analysis and the acquisition of knowledge were liberating and empowering forces. He forcefully criticized the fashionable liberal Protestantism of the 20th century as filled with contradictions and evasions, preferring the austerity of the book of Job and the Jewish existentialism of Martin Buber. Kaufmann discussed many of these issues in his 1958 \"Critique of Religion and Philosophy\".\n\nKaufmann wrote a good deal on the existentialism of Søren Kierkegaard and Karl Jaspers. Kaufmann had great admiration for Kierkegaard's passion and his insights on freedom, anxiety, and individualism. Kaufmann wrote: \"Nobody before Kierkegaard had seen so clearly that the freedom to make a fateful decision that may change our character and future breeds anxiety.\" Although Kaufmann did not share Kierkegaard's religious outlook and was critical of his Protestant theology, Kaufmann was nevertheless sympathetic and impressed with the depth of Kierkegaard's thinking:\n\n...I know of no other great writer in the whole nineteenth century, perhaps even in the whole of world literature, to whom I respond with less happiness and with a more profound sense that I am on trial and found wanting, unless it were Søren Kierkegaard.\"\n\nKaufmann edited the anthology \"Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre\". Kaufmann disliked Martin Heidegger's thinking, along with his unclear writing.\n\nKaufmann is renowned for his translations and exegesis of Nietzsche, whom he saw as gravely misunderstood by English speakers, as a major early existentialist, and as an unwitting precursor, in some respects, to Anglo-American analytic philosophy. Llewellyn Jones wrote that Kaufmann's \"fresh insights into ... Nietzsche ... can deepen the insights of every discriminating student of literature,\" and \"The New Yorker\" wrote that Kaufmann \"has produced what may be the definitive study of Nietzsche's ... thought—an informed, scholarly, and lustrous work.\"\n\nKaufmann wrote that superficially\n\n...it also seems that as a philosopher [Nietzsche] represents a very sharp decline [from Kant and Hegel] ... because [Nietzsche] has no 'system.' Yet this argument is hardly cogent. ... Not only can one defend Nietzsche on this score ... but one must add that he had strong philosophic reasons for not having a system. \n\nKaufmann also sympathized with Nietzsche's acerbic criticisms of Christianity. However, Kaufmann faulted much in Nietzsche, writing that \"my disagreements with [Nietzsche] are legion.\" Regarding style, Kaufmann argued that Nietzsche's \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\", for example, is in parts badly written, melodramatic, or verbose, yet concluded that the book \"is not only a mine of ideas, but also a major work of literature and a personal triumph.\"\n\nKaufmann described his own ethic and his own philosophy of living in his books, including \"The Faith of a Heretic: What Can I Believe? How Should I Live? What Do I Hope?\" (1961) and \"Without Guilt and Justice: From Decidophobia to Autonomy\" (1973). He advocated living in accordance with what he proposed as the four cardinal virtues: ambition/humility, love, courage, and honesty.\n\n\nAs written or published by Friedrich Nietzsche in chronological order:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They are well integrated into the Armenian society, with freedom of religion and non-interference in their cultural traditions.\n\nMany Yazidis came to the Russian Empire (now the territory of Armenia and Georgia) during the 19th and early 20th centuries to escape religious persecution, as they were oppressed by the Ottoman Turks and the Sunni Kurds who tried to convert them to Islam. The Yazidis were massacred alongside the Armenians during the Armenian Genocide, causing many to flee to Russian-held parts of Armenia. The first ever Yazidi school was opened in Armenia in 1920.\n\nThe Yezidi movement erupting in Armenia in 1988 appealed to the 3rd All-Armenian Yezidi Assembly convened on 30 September 1989 (the two previous Assemblies occurred at the dawn of the Armenian SSR's history, in 1921 and 1923) to challenge the Government for the official recognition of their identity. As a result, the Yezidis were presented as a separate minority in the USSR population census of 1989. According to this very census, the total count of Yezidis in Armenia was 52,700. Also need to note that in Karabakh war participated more than 500 yezidis by ethnicity, they have a detachment \"Jangir Agha\" headed by Aziz Tamoyan.\n\nMany Yezidis volunteered during the Karabakh conflict to fight on the Armenian side.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, there are 35,272 Yazidis in Armenia. Ten years earlier, in the 2001 census, 40,620 Yazidis were registered in Armenia. Media have estimated the number of Yazidis in Armenia as between 30,000 and 50,000. Most of them are descendants of refugees to Armenia following the persecution during Ottoman rule, including during the Armenian Genocide, when many Armenians found refuge in Yazidi villages.\n\nEthnic Yazidis have a slightly younger population compared to ethnic Armenians. Almost 54 percent is under thirty years old, while 8 percent is aged sixty or more. \n\nElection Code of Armenia guarantees one seat in the National Assembly to Yazid minority.\n\nIn 2016 a memorial for fallen Yazids is installed in Yerevan downtown in the park at the crossing of Isahakyan and Nalbandyan streets.\n\nAs of 2016, the world's largest Yazidi temple is under construction in the small village of Aknalich.\n\nUS reports on the relations between Yazidis and the Armenian government have been mixed. According to a 2004 U.S. Department of State human rights report, Yazidis are subjected to some harassment in Armenia. Attendance school rates among children in the Yezidi ethnic minority continued to be lower than average, partially due to economic reasons, a lack of Yezidi teachers and books, and the early removal of teenage girls from schools for marriage. In 2006 the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) supported the government's effort to publish textbooks for ethnic minorities, and in 2007 new Yezidi language textbooks appeared in some Yezidi schools around the country. The textbooks are Aziz. and Hasan Shex Mamude. Also through Armenian government support a first Yezidi newspaper was published named \"Ezdikhana\" (ex. name: \"Denge Ezdia\" or Yezidi Voice).\n\nAccording to a 2007 U.S. Department of State human rights report, \"As in previous years, Yezidi leaders did not complain that police and local authorities subjected their community to discrimination\".\n\nThere are 22 rural settlements in the Republic of Armenia with Yazidi majority. \nThe biggest Yazidi village in Armenia is Verin Artashat in Ararat Province with 4,270 residents.\n\nThere are 19 Yazidi-inhabited villages in Aragatsotn Province.\n\nThere are two Yazidi villages in Armavir Province: Yeraskhahun and Ferik, both in Ejmiatsin district.\n\nOn 29 September 2012 Yazidis opened their first temple outside their Lalish homeland - the temple of \"Ziarat\" in Aknalich village in Armavir province of Armenia. In August 2015 an architectural design for a new temple in Aknalich was released; the temple is planned to be completed in 2017.\n\nThe only Yazidi village is Verin Artashat, near Artashat.\n\n\n\n"}
