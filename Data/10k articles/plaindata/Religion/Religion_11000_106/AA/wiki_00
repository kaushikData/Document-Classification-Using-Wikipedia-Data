The word comes from the Greek \"aleuron\", meaning flour, and \"manteia\", meaning divination. \n\nDivination with flour is attested in cuneiform tablets from the 2nd millennium BCE. Flour was poured out in small heaps and the interpretation was based on the observation of their shapes and orientation.\n\nIn its original form, slips of paper containing philosophical writings would be baked inside of cakes or cookies, which would then be distributed to those wishing their fortunes to be told. Similarly, the Greeks would bake slips of paper with sentences on them inside of balls of flour, mix the balls nine times, and distribute them. Modern fortune cookies are a variant on these forms of divination. \n\nAnother form of aleuromancy consisted of interpreting patterns of flour left in a bowl after a flour and water slurry had been mixed in it and poured away.\n\n"}

It is located in Mazandaran Province, Iran.\n\nMullá Husayn-i-Bushru'i, one of the most prominent Bábís, marched with 202 of his fellow disciples, under instructions from the Báb, from Mashhad to the Shrine of Shaykh Tabarsí with the Black Standard raised, fulfilling an Islamic prophecy. The mission was most likely proclamatory but possibly also to rescue another Bábí leader, Quddús, who was under house arrest in Sárí. After being rebuffed at the town of Barfurush the group took up making defensive fortifications at the Shrine of the Shaykh. Upon arriving at the shrine, the Bábís, numbering a little over 300 according to Bábí and Bahá'í sources and according to court historians, were now under imminent attack from government forces.\n\nA scholarly review finds reasonable support for between 540 and 600 people present including over a hundred villagers who joined locally after those that arrived from across the country. A census of the Bábís who had traveled some distance to the Shrine shows 14 major former clerics of Islam, 122 minor former clerics of Islam, 12 nobility or high government officials, 5 wholesale merchants, 9 retail merchants, 39 guild tradesmen, 6 unskilled laborers, 6 peasants, and 152 unclassified. Different sources have some similarities of which cities/provinces they came from — the highest numbers coming from Isfahan, Boshruyeh, Miyami, and Bahnemir, though 33 locations are listed among the places of origin of the participants.\n\nSources describe the building of the fort as a matter of self-defence. The Bábí's spent many months under attack in the fort, resorting to eating the leather of their own clothes to remain alive.\n\nOver the weeks that followed, more and more Bábís joined the fort with numbers rising to perhaps six hundred. Most notable of the late arrivals is Quddús who joined after being released by Tabarsí Bábís on October 20.\n\nBahá'ís see the battle, which was led by Mullá Husayn, as a heroic stand against oppressive government forces that lasted several months.\n\nAt last, having finally been reduced to near-starvation by the encirclement, the Bábí defenders surrendered on the guarantee of safe passage — a guarantee that was immediately violated, with most of the former “garrison” massacred on the spot on May 10.\n\nIt is believed that eight of the disciples of the Báb also called the Letters of the Living were killed in the series of battles:\n\n\nQuddús was taken prisoner in the city of Barfurush. There the high priest rallied the townsfolk into a vicious frenzy. Quddus was then left to the hands of the mob who beat him to death on May 16, 1849. What remained of Quddus' body was gathered by a friend and buried nearby.\n\nThe battle is considered the most important upheaval of the Bábí religion because the Báb himself instructed Mullá Husayn-i Bushru'i to initiate it with raising the \"Black Standard\" as well as a call for support of the collective initiative of Bábís, the episode included two leading figures of the religion in Mulla Husayn and Quddús and overall nine out of eighteen of the Letters of the Living, and actually reached a widespread response from across the country. No other upheaval the Bábís suffered had this pattern of importance in it.\n\nIt was mentioned in some French language newspaper accounts from the Journal de Constantinople in March 1849.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3199094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3199094", "title": "Bhavishya Purana", "text": "Bhavishya Purana\n\nThe Bhavishya Purana (\"\") is one of the eighteen major works in the Purana genre of Hinduism, written in Sanskrit. The title \"Bhavishya\" means \"future\" and implies it is a work that contains prophecies regarding the future, however, the \"prophecy\" parts of the extant manuscripts are a modern era addition and hence not an integral part of the Bhavishya Purana. Those sections of the surviving manuscripts that are dated to be older, are partly borrowed from other Indian texts such as \"Brihat Samhita\" and \"Shamba Purana\". The veracity and authenticity of much of the \"Bhavishya Purana\" has been questioned by modern scholars and historians, and the text is considered an example of \"constant revisions and living nature\" of Puranic genre of Hindu literature. The modern addition of prophecy part in the Bhavishya Purana has been allegedly used to misguide others.\n\nThe text exists in many inconsistent versions, wherein the content as well as their subdivisions vary, and five major versions are known. Some manuscripts have four \"Parvan\" (parts), some two, others don't have any parts. The text as it exists today is a composite of material ranging from medieval era to very recent. The available versions of \"Bhavishya Purana\" are based on a printed text published during the British colonial era.\n\nThe first 16 chapters of the first part of the \"Bhavisya Purana\" is called \"Brahmaparvan\". It shows similarities to, and likely borrowed verses from some version of the Manusmriti. However, some of the caste-related and women's rights related discussion in the \"Bhavishya Purana\" is egalitarian and challenge those found in the 19th-century published manuscripts of the Manusmriti. The Brahmaparvan part of the \"Bhavishya Purana\" includes a 169 chapters compendium of Surya (Sun god) related literature, that overlaps with Zoroastrianism-related views. These Sun-related sections are a notable and important part of the \"Bhavishya Purana\", and it may be related to the migration or interaction between people of Persia and central Asia with those in Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe second part of the text, called \"Madhyamaparvan\", is a Tantra-related work. The \"prophecy\"-related third part \"Pratisargaparvan\" includes sections on Christianity, Islam, Bhakti movement, Sikhism, British rule, and considered by scholars as a 19th-century creation. The fourth part of the text called \"Uttaraparvan\", is also known as \"Bhavishyottara Purana\". This last part describes festivals related to various Hindu gods and goddesses and their \"Tithis\" (dates on lunar calendar), as well as mythology and a discussion of Dharma particularly \"vrata\" (vow) and \"dana\" (charity). The text also has many \"Mahatmya\" chapters on geography, travel guide and pilgrimage to holy sites such as Uthiramerur, and is one of the \"Tirtha\"-focussed Puranas.\n\nIn records of land grants of the fifth century CE verses are quoted which occur only in the \"Padma\", \"Bhavishya\", and \"Brahma Puranas\", and on this basis Pargiter in 1912 assigned these particular Puranas to the early centuries CE. Maurice Winternitz considers it more probable that these verses, both in the inscriptions and in the puranas, were taken as quotations from earlier dharmaśāstras, and thus argues that chronological deductions cannot be made on that basis.\n\nAccording to Maurice Winternitz, the text which has come down to us in manuscript form under this title is certainly not the ancient work which is quoted in the '. A quotation appearing in the ' attributed to the ' cannot be found in the extant text of the Purana.\n\nSome manuscripts of the \"Bhavishya Purana\" assert that it has five parts (Sanskrit: \"parvans\"), but the extant printed editions contain four parts (\"Brāhma\", \"Madhyama\", \"Pratisarga\", and \"Uttara\"). These four parts have distinctive content and dating.\n\nThe \"Brahmaparvan\" contains 215 chapters, the \"Madhyamaparvan\" has three sections with a cumulative total of 62 chapters, the \"Pratisargaparvan\" has four sections with 7, 35, 32 and 26 chapters sequentially, and the \"Uttaraparvan\" has 208 chapters. Some manuscripts of the text do not have these \"Parvans\" and have different number of chapters. The \"Madhyamaparvan\" part is a Tantra-related work, while the \"prophecy\"-related third part \"Pratisargaparvan\" is likely a 19th-century creation.\n\nThe text is sometimes titled \"\". In the \"Padma Purana\", it is classified in the \"rajas\" category, which contains puranas related to Brahma. Scholars consider the \"Sattva-Rajas-Tamas\" classification as \"entirely fanciful\" and there is nothing in this text that actually justifies this classification.\n\nDespite being labelled a purana or \"tales of ancient times\", the work relates only a few legends. It is one of several puranas in which a list of royal dynasties of the \"past\" are followed by lists of kings predicted to rule in the future.\n\nThis part of the text has 215 chapters. It covers topics such as rites of passage, ceremonies and feasts. It also covers the duties and rights of women, a discussion on the nature of people and how to identify good and bad characters, and a caste-related discussion. According to Arora, and other scholars, the caste-related and women's rights related discussion in the \"Bhavishya Purana\" is egalitarian, similar to those found in \"Brahma Purana\" and Vajrasuchi Upanishad, all three of which challenge the views expressed in the Manusmriti.\n\nThe Brahmaparvan also includes sections on festival dates and methods for worshipping Brahma, Ganesha, Skanda, and the Nāga. A considerable section deals with Sun worship in a place called \"Śākadvīpa\" which may be a reference to Scythia. This overlaps with Zoroastrianism-related views, and may be related to ancient migration or interaction between Persia and central Asia with Indian subcontinent. These chapters are the most comprehensive and important source of sun-worship tradition in India, and may be related to the escape and resettlement of people from Persia into western India during the mid to late medieval era.\n\nThe second part of the \"Bhavisya Purana\" has 62 chapters on Tantra.\n\nThis is not mentioned in other Indian text, states Hazra, to have been a part of the \"Bhavishya Purana\", and therefore he states that it may be \"a late appendage\" abounding in Tantric theories of the 2nd-millennium. However, states Rocher, the tantra sections of this Purana were likely part of the text by about 1500 CE.\n\nThe Pratisarga parvan has 100 chapters, which deal with topics such as the genealogy of the kings and sages, and prophecies. It is written as a universal history with the first and the second chapters (called Khandas) deal with old time, the third part with the medieval, while the fourth deals with the new age. This section has led scholars to question the veracity and authenticity of much of the \"Bhavishya Purana\", and as evidence that the Puranas were not scriptures, but texts that were constantly revised and of living nature, both over time and over geography.\n\nAlf Hiltebeitel, who has translated and summarized this part of the \"Bhavisya Purana\", considers that 1739 marks the terminus a quo (completed after year) for the text's history of the Mughals and the same terminus a quo would apply to Pratisargaparvan's first khanda Genesis-Exodus sequence, and the diptych in the section concerning \"Isha Putra\" (Jesus Christ) and Muhammad in its third chapter. Mention of Queen Victoria's Calcutta places the terminus ad quem (completed before year) at mid to late 19th Century. Hiltebeitel states that this part of the \"Bhavisya Purana\" was mostly likely composed in the 19th century.\n\nThe \"Uttaraparvan\" is large with 208 chapters. Though nominally attached to the \"Bhavishya Purana\", is usually considered to be an independent work, also known as the ', and as such is included among the Upapuranas (Lesser Puranas). The ' is primarily a handbook of religious rites with a few legends and myths. Rajendra Hazra characterizes it as \"a loose collection of materials taken from various sources\" that is lacking in many of the traditional five characteristics of a purana, but which offers an interesting study of vows, festivals, and donations from sociological and religious point of view.\n\nThe \"Bhavishya Purana\" also includes \"Mahatmya\" (travel guides) to pilgrimage sites such as Uthiramerur.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1134350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1134350", "title": "Body of Christ", "text": "Body of Christ\n\nIn Christian theology, the term Body of Christ has two main but separate meanings: it may refer to Jesus' words over the bread at the Last Supper that \"This is my body\" in , or to the usage of the term by the Apostle Paul in and to refer to the Christian Church. It may also refer to Christ's post-resurrection body in Heaven. Christ also associated himself with the poor of the world and this is also called the Body of Christ.“If we truly wish to encounter Christ, we have to touch his body in the suffering bodies of the poor, as a response to the sacramental communion bestowed in the Eucharist. The Body of Christ, broken in the sacred liturgy, can be seen, through charity and sharing, in the faces and persons of the most vulnerable of our brothers and sisters.” said Pope Francis on launching the World Day of the Poor. \n\nThere are significant differences in how Christians understand the term as used by Christ at the Last Supper and as developed in Christian theology of the Eucharist. For some it may be symbolic, for others it becomes a more literal or mystical understanding.\n\nAs used by Saint Paul in the Pauline epistles it refers to the Christian Church as a group of believers. In Roman Catholic theology the use of the phrase \"mystical body\" distinguishes the mystical body of Christ, the Church, from the physical body of Christ, and from a \"moral body\" such as any club with a common purpose.\n\nWhile teaching that in the bread consecrated in the Eucharist there is absolutely no change open to the senses or to scientific investigation, the Catholic Church supports the Real Presence, i.e. that the reality of the bread is changed into that of the body of Christ. The Church teachings refer to this change as one of the \"substance\" or \"transubstantiation\". It rejects the term \"consubstantiation\", which suggests that the substance or reality of the bread remains after the consecration, instead of being converted or changed into that of the body of Christ. At the same time, the Church holds that all that can be examined either directly or by scientific investigation  what in philosophy are called the \"accidents\" (as opposed to the reality)  remains quite unchanged.\n\nIn the Roman Rite, the priest or other minister who gives the consecrated host to a communicant says: \"The body of Christ\", indicating what is held to be the reality of what is given.\n\nSince the consecrated bread is believed to be the body of Christ and sacred, what remains of the host after celebration of Mass is kept in the church tabernacle. This is primarily for the purpose of taking Communion to the sick, but also to serve as a focal point for private devotion and prayer. On appropriate occasions, there may be public Eucharistic adoration.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church also believes that the Eucharistic elements of bread and wine become the actual body and blood of Christ. It has authoritatively used the term \"Transubstantiation\" to describe this change, as in \"The Longer Catechism of The Orthodox, Catholic, Eastern Church\" and in the decrees of the 1672 Synod of Jerusalem.\n\nHistorically, various Protestant theologians expressed different opinions regarding the Eucharist and the body of Christ. In contrast to Zwingli, Martin Luther reasoned that because divinity involves omnipresence, the body of Christ can be present in the Eucharist because of its participation in the divine nature. A long debate took place between Luther and Zwingli on the issue of omnipresence, with each providing a variety of theological and biblical arguments to support his view.\n\nIn current Lutheran teachings, the Body of Christ is used in a somewhat similar form to the Catholic teachings, but the Lutherans reject the Catholic teaching of transubstantiation. For the Lutheran, the Body of Christ is the formal title of the sacramental bread in the Eucharist, as seen in the Lutheran Divine Service. It is also said in the Words of Institution  see Luther's Small Catechism. A similar teaching is taught in various Methodist churches.\n\nJohn Calvin disagreed with Luther's reasoning about omnipresence and, like Zwingli, argued that human presence requires a specific location. Calvin stated that Christ's body was present in the first Eucharist during the Last Supper, but was thereafter in heaven. Melanchthon was accused of supporting Calvin, and the debates between the various groups eventually caused a further rift between the followers of Luther and Zwingli.\n\nThe first meaning that Catholics attach to the expression \"Body of Christ\" is the Catholic Church. The Catechism of the Catholic Church quotes with approval, as \"summing up the faith of the holy doctors and the good sense of the believer\", the reply of Saint Joan of Arc to her judges: \"About Jesus Christ and the Church, I simply know they're just one thing, and we shouldn't complicate the matter.\" In the same passage, it also quotes Saint Augustine: \"Let us rejoice then and give thanks that we have become not only Christians, but Christ himself. Do you understand and grasp, brethren, God's grace toward us? Marvel and rejoice: we have become Christ. For if he is the head, we are the members; he and we together are the whole man... the fullness of Christ then is the head and the members. But what does 'head and members' mean? Christ and the Church.\" In light of all this, the Catholic Church calls itself the \"universal sacrament of salvation\" for the whole world, as it dispenses the sacraments which give the grace of Christ to the recipient.\n\nSaint Paul the Apostle spoke of this unity of Christians with Christ, referred to in the New Testament also in images such as that of the vine and the branches, in terms of a single body that has Christ as its head in , and , and .\n\nAccording to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, \"the comparison of the Church with the body casts light on the intimate bond between Christ and his Church. Not only is she gathered around him; she is united in him, in his body. Three aspects of the Church as the Body of Christ are to be more specifically noted: the unity of all her members with each other as a result of their union with Christ; Christ as head of the Body; and the Church as bride of Christ.\" The Catechism spells out the significance of each of these three aspects.\n\nTo distinguish the Body of Christ in this sense from his physical body, the term \"Mystical Body of Christ\" is often used. This term was used as the first words, and so as the title, of the encyclical \"Mystici Corporis Christi\" of Pope Pius XII. In that document, Pope Pius XII in 1943 states, \"the mystical Body of Christ... is the Catholic Church.\" But in 1964 the Catholic bishops gathered at the Second Vatican Council, while acknowledging that “full incorporation” in the Church required union with the Sovereign Pontiff, described various degrees of being “conjoined” or “related” to the Church including all persons of good will, which was not something new. Following this understanding, Karl Rahner coined the term “anonymous Christians”.\n\nThe Orthodox see the description of the Church (\"Ecclessia\") as the \"Body of Christ\" as being inextricably connected to Holy Communion. According to Saint Ignatius (c. 35–107), the unity of the Church is expressed in Eucharistic terms. Just as there are many offerings made throughout the world on any given day, and yet all partake of one and the same Body of Christ, so the Church, though existing in many separate localities, is only one.\n\nIn modern teachings, the \"Body of Christ\" is used by other Protestants to collectively describe believers in Christ, as opposed to only those who are members of the Catholic Church. In this sense, Christians are members of the universal body of Christ not because of identification with the institution of the Church, but through identification with Christ directly through faith. This theology is based on several passages in the Bible, including , and , and . Jesus Christ is seen as the \"head\" of the body, which is the church, while the \"members\" of the body are seen as members of the Church. In this way, Protestantism defines the \"Body of Christ\" in a much broader way than does the Catholic Church. This has allowed for a broad base within Christianity to call themselves part of the \"Body of Christ.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2702399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2702399", "title": "Cambridge Platform", "text": "Cambridge Platform\n\nThe Cambridge Platform is a statement describing the system of church government in the Congregational churches of colonial New England. It was written in 1648 in response to Presbyterian criticism and in time became regarded as the religious constitution of Massachusetts. The platform explained and defended congregational polity as practiced in New England and also endorsed most of the Westminster Confession of Faith. The document was shaped most directly by the thinking of Puritan ministers Richard Mather and John Cotton.\n\nThe Puritans who settled colonial New England were Calvinists who believed in congregational church government and that the church should include only regenerated persons as full members. Because of this, they became known as Congregationalists and their churches became known as Congregational churches. In New England, Congregationalism was the established religion—Congregational churches were supported financially by taxation and, in Massachusetts, only Congregational church members could vote.\n\nIn the 1640s, Congregationalism came under increased scrutiny from English Presbyterians, who were gaining power as a result of the English Civil War. As Calvinists, Congregationalists and Presbyterians were nearly identical in their beliefs with the exception of church government. Presbyterian polity gave authority to elders rather than to church members. In addition, Presbyterians did not insist upon a regenerate church membership and allowed all \"non-scandalous\" churchgoers to receive the Lord's Supper.\n\nIn 1645, local Presbyterians led by William Vassal and Robert Child led a protest against Massachusetts' policies on church membership and voting. Child threatened to take his complaints to Parliament, provoking fear among colonial leaders that the English government might intervene to force Presbyterianism on New England. The Cambridge Synod was called in response to these attacks on Congregationalism.\n\nIn May 1646, a group of Massachusetts ministers asked the colony's General Court to call for a meeting of the colony's churches for the purpose of establishing a uniform set of practices. Specific points of concern involved church membership and baptism of the children of non-members. The Cambridge Synod first met on September 1, 1646, and would continue to meet periodically until August 1648 when its work was completed. Its membership included ministers and lay delegates from all but four of the 29 churches in Massachusetts, and it also had the support of the 24 churches in the other Puritan colonies of New Hampshire, Plymouth, Connecticut and New Haven. Some churches in these colonies also sent ministers and delegates.\n\nThe synod tasked John Cotton, Richard Mather and Ralph Partridge of Duxbury to each write a model of church government for the group's consideration. Ultimately, Mather's \"Platform of Church Discipline\" was adopted by the synod, and it included much that had been previously written on church government by Mather and Cotton. The General Court also requested that the synod adopt a confession of faith. By this time, the Westminster Confession of Faith, which had been written by English Puritans, had already been adopted by Parliament. The synod unanimously voted to accept the doctrinal portions of the confession, stating that they \"do judge it to be very holy, orthodox, and judicious in all matters of faith; and do therefore freely and fully consent thereunto, for the substance thereof.\" The synod disagreed with portions of the Confession dealing with presbyterian church polity.\n\nThe platform is organized into a preface and 17 chapters. The preface, written by John Cotton, counters various criticisms leveled against the New England churches and defends their orthodoxy. The first four chapters explain that congregational polity is the only form of church government authorized in the Bible. \n\nA Congregational church is defined as \"a company of saints by calling, united into one body by a holy covenant, for the public worship of God, and the mutual edification one of another, in the fellowship of the Lord Jesus.\" A local church is a \"visible political union\" that saints enter into by voluntary, mutual consent on the basis of a church covenant. This distinguished the Congregationalists from the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England, in which everyone within a certain region was given membership in the church.\n\nThe platform states that a church should operate under a mixed government, with elements of monarchy (Jesus Christ is king and head of the church), democracy (congregational governance) and aristocracy (rule by officers). The authority given to the congregation includes choosing its own officers, admitting new church members, public censure, excommunication, and restoration to church fellowship.\n\nThe two offices are elder and deacon. Furthermore, there were two types of elders: ministers (who could hold the title of pastor or teacher depending on their specific roles) and lay elders (called ruling elders). Both pastors and teachers can administer sacraments and execute church discipline, but pastors \"attend to exhortation, and therein to administer a word of wisdom\", while teachers \"attend to doctrine, and therein to administer a word of knowledge\". \n\nRuling elders, together with the ministers, are responsible for overseeing the spiritual affairs of the church, including examining any potential officers or members before being approved by the church, ordaining officers chosen by the church, receiving and preparing accusations to be presented to the church, pronouncing sentence of censure or excommunication with consent of the church, moderating church business meetings, acting as guides and leaders in church administration, and admonishing church members when needed. Deacons oversee the worldly or financial affairs of the church, which include collecting contributions and gifts, paying the ministers and distributing charity to the poor. In addition to the two offices, the platform also states that elderly widows may also have a ministry within the church, including \"giving attendance to the sick, and to give succor unto them, and others in the like necessities.\"\n\nChurch members elect their officers and can depose them as well. The platform recommends that when possible neighboring churches be consulted concerning the trial of officers. It rejects any right of government officials, diocesan bishops or patrons to appoint church officers. After election, officers are to be ordained by laying on of hands, prayer and fasting; nevertheless, the platform notes that it is election that makes one an officer, not ordination. Normally, elders are to perform the laying on of hands. If a church lacked elders, however, church members themselves could ordain their officers or the church could invite elders from neighboring churches to perform the ordination.\n\nChapter 12 requires that persons who wish to become church members must first be examined by the elders for evidence of repentance of sin and faith in Jesus Christ. The person would then be expected to give a \"relation\" or public account of their conversion experience before the entire congregation prior to becoming a member. Those who suffered from \"excessive fear or infirmity\" could give their confession to the elders in private, however. Those who were baptized as children are also required to be examined before they can exercise the privileges of full membership, such as participating in the Lord's Supper. \n\nChapter 13 describes procedures for transferring from one Congregational church to another, and chapter 14 describes procedures for censuring and excommunicating members who refuse to repent of offenses.\n\nThough distinct and without authority over one another, the platform affirms that Congregational churches should maintain communion with each other. Six ways of showing the communion of churches are identified:\n\nCongregational churches may call for elders and other congregational representatives to meet together in a synod or church council to argue, debate and determine matters of religion. Civil authorities may also call synods to provide religious advice and counsel. Because each Congregational church is self-governing, synods can only advise and recommend. Synods cannot exercise jurisdiction or authority over a local church. \n\nChapter 17 affirms that church officers many not interfere with the civil government nor government officials with the church. However, the government should punish idolatry, blasphemy, heresy, and \"the venting of corrupt and pernicious opinions\".\n\nThe Cambridge Platform was completed by the synod in 1648 and commended by the General Court as an accurate description of Congregational practice after the churches were given time to study the document, provide feedback, and finally ratify it. While the platform was legally nonbinding and intended only to be descriptive, it soon became regarded by ministers and lay people alike as the religious constitution of Massachusetts, guaranteeing the rights of church officers and members. \n\nCongregational minister Albert Elijah Dunning wrote that it was \"the most important document produced by the Congregationalists of the seventeenth century, for it most clearly represents the belief of the churches and their system of government for more than one hundred years.\" In Connecticut, it would be replaced by the Saybrook Platform of 1708, which moved the Congregational churches closer to a presbyterian form of government.\n\nThe document has real ramifications for the polity of some denominations today. For example, the congregations of the United Church of Christ and Unitarian Universalist churches, and other modern-day descendants of the Puritan churches, continue to claim congregational polity as their local church organization, but have created large denominational administrations to maintain ministerial oversight and promote intradenominational communication. When some Churches of the Standing Order in New England became Unitarian following the Unitarian Controversy, they kept a congregational polity. That polity continued to deeply influence the polity and organization of the American Unitarian Association, and, in turn, that of the Unitarian Universalist Association—an organization that, while radically different theologically than the signers of the 1648 document, nonetheless shares a great deal of the same polity.\n\nIts influence extended beyond what is today the United States. The platform helped shape the Savoy Declaration of 1658 produced by English Congregationalists.\n\n"}
{"id": "64234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64234", "title": "Concupiscence", "text": "Concupiscence\n\nConcupiscence (from Late Latin noun \"concupiscentia\", from the Latin verb \"concupiscere\", from \"con-\", \"with\", here an intensifier, + \"cupi(d)-\", \"desiring\" + \"-escere\", a verb-forming suffix denoting beginning of a process or state) is an ardent, usually sensual, longing. In Catholic theology, concupiscence is seen as a desire of the lower appetite contrary to reason.\n\nThere are nine occurrences of \"concupiscence\" in the Douay-Rheims Bible and three occurrences in the \"King James Bible\". It is also one of the English translations of the Koine Greek epithumia (ἐπιθυμία), which occurs 38 times in the New Testament.\n\nIn Judaism, there is an early concept of \"yetzer hara\" (Hebrew: יצר הרע for \"evil inclination\"). This concept is the inclination of humanity at creation to do evil or violate the will of God. The \"yetzer hara\" is not the product of original sin as in Christian theology, but the tendency of humanity to misuse the natural survival needs of the physical body. Therefore, the natural need of the body for food becomes gluttony, the command to procreate becomes sexual sin, the demands of the body for rest become sloth, and so on.\n\nIn Judaism, the \"yetzer hara\" is a natural part of God's creation, and God provides guidelines and commands to help us master this tendency. This doctrine was clarified in the Sifre around 200-350 CE. In Jewish doctrine, it is possible for humanity to overcome the \"yetzer hara\". Therefore, for the Jewish mindset, it is possible for humanity to choose good over evil, and it is the person's duty to choose good (see: Sifrei on Deuteronomy, P. Ekev 45, Kidd. 30b).\n\nInvoluntary sexual arousal is explored in the \"Confessions\" of Augustine, wherein he used the term \"concupiscence\" to refer to sinful lust. He taught that Adam's sin is transmitted by concupiscence, or \"hurtful desire\", resulting in humanity becoming a \"massa damnata\" (mass of perdition, condemned crowd), with much enfeebled, though not destroyed, freedom of will. When Adam sinned, human nature was thenceforth transformed. Adam and Eve, via sexual reproduction, recreated human nature. Their descendants now live in sin, in the form of concupiscence, a term Augustine used in a metaphysical, not a psychological sense. Augustine insisted that concupiscence was not \"a being\" but a \"bad quality\", the privation of good or a wound. He admitted that sexual concupiscence (\"libido\") might have been present in the perfect human nature in paradise, and that only later it became disobedient to human will as a result of the first couple's disobedience to God's will in the original sin. In Augustine's view (termed \"Realism\"), all of humanity was really present in Adam when he sinned, and therefore all have sinned. Original sin, according to Augustine, consists of the guilt of Adam which all humans inherit.\n\nThe main opposition came from a monk named Pelagius (354–420 or 440). His views became known as Pelagianism. Although the writings of Pelagius are no longer extant, the eight canons of the Council of Carthage (418) provided corrections to the perceived errors of the early Pelagians. From these corrections, there is a strong similarity between Pelagians and their Jewish counterparts on the concepts of concupiscence. Pelagianism gives mankind the ability to choose between good and evil within their created nature. While rejecting concupiscence, and embracing a concept similar to the \"yetzer hara\", these views rejected humanity's universal need for grace.\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) teaches that Adam and Eve were constituted in an original \"state of holiness and justice\" (CCC 375, 376 398), free from concupiscence (CCC 377). The preternatural state enjoyed by Adam and Eve afforded endowments with many prerogatives which, while pertaining to the natural order, were not due to human nature as such. Principal among these were a high degree of infused knowledge, bodily immortality and freedom from pain, and immunity from evil impulses or inclinations. In other words, the lower or animal nature in man was perfectly subject to the control of reason, and the will subject to God. Besides this, the Catholic Church teaches that our first parents were also endowed with sanctifying grace by which they were elevated to the supernatural order. By sinning, however, Adam lost this original \"state\", not only for himself but for all human beings (CCC 416).\n\nAccording to Catholic theology man has not lost his natural faculties: by the sin of Adam he has been deprived only of the Divine gifts to which his nature had no strict right: the complete mastery of his passions, exemption from death, sanctifying grace, and the vision of God in the next life. The Creator, whose gifts were not due to the human race, had the right to bestow them on such conditions as he wished and to make their conservation depend on the fidelity of the head of the family. A prince can confer a hereditary dignity on condition that the recipient remains loyal, and that, in case of his rebelling, this dignity shall be taken from him and in consequence from his descendants. It is not, however, intelligible that the prince, on account of a fault committed by a father, should order the hands and feet of all the descendants of the guilty man to be cut off immediately after their birth.\n\nAs a result of original sin, according to Catholics, human nature has \"not\" been totally corrupted (as opposed to the teaching of Luther and Calvin); rather, human nature has only been weakened and wounded, subject to ignorance, suffering, the domination of death, and the inclination to sin and evil (CCC 405, 418). This inclination toward sin and evil is called \"concupiscence\" (CCC 405, 418). Baptism, CCC teaches, erases original sin and turns a man back towards God. The inclination toward sin and evil persists, however, and he must continue to struggle against concupiscence (CCC 2520).\n\nIt should be noted that in this evolutionary era Catholic teaching on original sin focuses more on its results than on its origins. As Cardinal Ratzinger had intimated in 1981, and as Pope Benedict XVI clarified in 2008: \"How did it happen? This remains obscure... Evil remains mysterious. It is presented as such in great images, as it is in chapter 3 of Genesis, with that scene of the two trees, of the serpent, of sinful man: a great image that makes us guess but cannot explain what is itself illogical.\"\n\nThe primary difference between Catholic theology and most of the many different Protestant theologies on the issue of concupiscence is whether it can be classified as sin by its own nature. Different Protestant denominations tend to see concupiscence as sin itself, an act of the sinner. The Catholic Church teaches that while it is highly likely to cause sin, concupiscence is not sin itself. Rather, it is \"the tinder for sin\" which \"cannot harm those who do not consent\" (CCC 1264).\n\nThis difference is intimately tied with the different traditions on original sin. Much Protestant theology holds that the original nature of humanity was an innate tendency to good; the special relationship Adam and Eve enjoyed with God was due not to some supernatural gift, but to their own natures. Hence, in some Protestant traditions, the Fall was not the destruction of a supernatural gift, leaving humanity's nature to work unimpeded, but rather the corruption of that nature itself. Since the present nature of humans is corrupted from their original nature, it follows that it is not good, but rather evil (although some good may still remain). Thus, in some Protestant traditions, concupiscence is evil in itself. The Thirty-nine articles of the Church of England state that \"the Apostle doth confess, that concupiscence and lust hath of itself the nature of sin\".\n\nBy contrast, Catholicism, while also maintaining that humanity's original nature is good (CCC 374), teaches that even after this gift was lost after the Fall, human nature still cannot be called evil, because it remains a natural creation of God. Despite the fact that humans sin, Catholic theology teaches that human nature itself is not the \"cause\" of sin, although once it comes into contact with sin it may produce more sin.\n\nThe difference in views also extends to the relationship between concupiscence and original sin.\n\nAnother reason for the differing views of Catholics and certain Protestants on concupiscence is their position on sin in general. Certain Protestants (for instance the magisterial reformers) hold that one can be guilty of sin even if it is not voluntary; The Catholic Church, by contrast, traditionally has held that one is guilty of sin only when the sin is voluntary. The Scholastics and magisterial reformers have different views on the issue of what is voluntary and what is not: the Catholic Scholastics considered the emotions of love, hate, like and dislike to be acts of will or choice, while the early Protestant reformers did not. By the Catholic position that one's attitudes are acts of will, sinful attitudes are voluntary. By the magisterial reformer view that these attitudes are involuntary, some sins are involuntary as well. Since human nature (and therefore concupiscence) is not voluntarily chosen, the Catholic Church does not teach that it is sinful; some Protestants believe that, since some sins are involuntary, it can be.\n\nSome Protestants believe that concupiscence is the primary type of sin; thus they might refer to it simply as sin, or, to distinguish it from particular sinful acts, as \"humanity's sinful nature.\" Thus, \"concupiscence\" as a distinct term is more likely to be used by Catholics.\n\nThomas Aquinas in the 13th century described two divisions of \"sensuality\": the \"concupiscible\" (pursuit/avoidance instincts) and the \"irascible\" (competition/aggression/defense instincts). With the former are associated the emotions of joy and sadness, love and hate, desire and ; with the latter, daring and fear, hope and despair, anger.\n\nAl-Ghazali in the 11th century discussed concupiscence from an Islamic perspective in his book \"Kimiya-yi sa'ādat\" (\"The Alchemy of Happiness\"), and also mentioned it in \"The Deliverer from Error.\" In this book, amongst other things, he discusses how to reconcile the concupiscent and the irascible souls, balancing them to achieve happiness. Concupiscence is related to the term \"nafs\" in Arabic.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "213507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=213507", "title": "Converso", "text": "Converso\n\nA converso (; ; feminine form conversa), \"a convert\", () was a Jew who converted to Roman Catholicism in Spain or Portugal, particularly during the 14th and 15th centuries, or one of their descendants.\n\nThe majority of Spain's Jews converted to Christianity as a result of the pogroms in 1391. Those who remained openly practising Jews were expelled by the Catholic monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella in the Alhambra decree in 1492, following the Christian \"Reconquista\" (reconquest) of Spain. However, even a significant proportion of these remaining practising Jews chose to join the already large \"converso\" community rather than face exile. In order to safe-guard the Old Christian population and make sure that \"converso\" \"New Christians\" were true to their new faith, the Holy Office of the Inquisition was established in Spain in 1481.\n\n\"Conversos\" who did not fully or genuinely embrace Catholicism, but continued to practise Judaism in secrecy were referred to as \"judaizantes\" (\"Judaizers\") and pejoratively as \"marranos\" (\"swine\").\n\nNew Christian converts of Muslim origin were known as \"moriscos\". Unlike \"marranos\", \"moriscos\" were subject to an edict of expulsion even after their conversion to Catholicism, which was implemented severely in the eastern region of Valencia and less so in other parts of Spain.\n\nConversos played an important role in the 1520-1521 Revolt of the Comuneros, a popular uprising and civil war centered in the region of Castile against the imperial pretensions of the Spanish monarchy.\n\nFerrand Martinez, Archdeacon of Ecijia, directed a 13-year anti-Semitic campaign that began in 1378. Martinez used a series of provocative sermons, through which he openly condemned the Jews with little to no opposition. He rallied non-Jews against the Jews by creating a constant state of fear through riots. Martinez’s efforts led to a series of outbreaks on June 4, 1391, where several synagogues in Seville were burned to the ground and churches were erected in their place. Amidst this outbreak, many Jews fled the country, some converted to Christianity in fear, and some were sold to Muslims. Martinez set in motion the largest forced mass conversion of Jews in Spain.\n\nBoth the Church and the Crown had not anticipated such a large-scale conversion stemming from an unplanned anti-Semitic campaign led by Ferrand Martinez. The new converts, most of whom were forced, due to their large numbers, were victims of a new problem. A problem that temporarily solved the Jewish presence in Spain, however, led to the creation of a new group that was neither completely Catholic or Jewish.\n\nThe conversos, who were now fully privileged citizens, competed in all aspects of the economic sphere. This resulted in a new wave of racial anti-Semitism that was targeted at the conversos. This anti-Semitism evolved into small and large riots in Toledo, 1449, that now oppressed not the Jews by the Christians, but the New Christians (conversos) by the Old Christians. Thus, the Crown established a National Inquisition in 1478, that would test the loyalty and purity of a newly baptized Christian (converso). Due to continued oppression, some Jews and conversos fled Spain, others created a community that ensure the survival of Judaism in the Iberian Peninsula, although outwardly practising Christianity.\n\nConversas played a pivotal role in keeping Jewish traditions alive by observing many Jewish holidays like Shabbat. Conversas also cooked and baked traditional Jewish dishes in honor of the Sabbath (starting on Friday sundown), Yom Kippur, and other religious holidays. During festivals like Sukkot and Passover, Conversas participated by giving clothing articles and ornaments to Jewish women, they also attended a seder or obtained a baking matzah. Conversas also ensured that their household maintained similar dietary regulations as their Jewish counterparts, they did so by eating only kosher birds and other animals. Conversas also financially contributed to the growth of the Jewish/Converso community and synagogue. The Jewish community and the conversos exchanged books and knowledge, Jews taught conversos how to read to ensure a constant growth of their Jewish heritage. In order to take a stance against the church and its principles, some conversos performed professional work even on Sundays.\n\nThe traditional Jewish Purim was kept by the conversos in disguise of a Christian holiday, they named it: \"Festival of Santa Esterica\".\n\n\"Conversos\" were subject to suspicion and harassment from both what was left of the community they were leaving and that which they were joining. Both Christians and Jews called them \"tornadizo\" (renegade). James I, Alfonso X and John I passed laws forbidding the use of this epithet. This was part of a larger pattern of royal oversight, as laws were promulgated to protect their property, forbid attempts to convert them back to Judaism or the Muslim faith, and regulate their behavior, preventing their cohabitation or even dining with Jews, lest they convert back.\n\nConversos did not enjoy legal equality. Alfonso VII prohibited the \"recently converted\" from holding office in Toledo. They had supporters and bitter opponents in the Christian secular of general acceptance, yet they became targets of occasional pogroms during times of social tension (as during an epidemic and after an earthquake). They were subject to the Spanish and Portuguese inquisitions.\n\nWhile \"pure blood\" (so-called \"limpieza de sangre\"), free of the \"taint\" of non-Christian lineage, would come to be placed at a premium, particularly among the nobility, in a 15th-century defense of \"conversos\", Bishop Lope de Barrientos would list what Roth calls \"a veritable 'Who's Who' of Spanish nobility\" as having \"converso\" members or being of \"converso\" descent. He pointed out that given the near-universal conversion of Iberian Jews during Visigothic times, (quoting Roth) \"[W]ho among the Christians of Spain could be certain that he is not a descendant of those \"conversos\"?\"\n\nWith advances in science able to trace individuals' ancestry via their DNA, according to a widely publicized study (December 2008) in the \"American Journal of Human Genetics\", modern Spaniards (and Portuguese) have an average admixture of 19.8 percent from ancestors originating in the Near East during historic times (i.e. Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Jews and Levantine Arabs) - compared to 10.6 percent of North African - Berber admixture.\n\nSpecific groups of conversos left Spain and Portugal after the Spanish Inquisition in 1492, in search for better life. They left for other parts of Europe, especially Italy, where they were inevitably looked at with suspicion and harassment, both in their old and new communities. Subsequently, many conversos who arrived in Italian cities did not openly embrace their Judaism, since they were tempted by the advantages they could seek in the Christian world.\n\nThe first three cities to accept the conversos who openly converted back to Judaism, were Florence, Ferrara and Ancona. Most of these conversos appeared after 1536 from Portugal, and most lived in Florence. In 1549, Duke Cosimo de Medici allowed the Portuguese conversos to trade and reside within Florence. Most of the re-converted Jews lived in the ghetto of Florence, and by 1705 there were 453 Jews in the city.\n\nConversos arrived to Ferrara in 1535, and were able to assimilate with their neighbors, perform circumcisions, and return openly to Judaism, due to the Lettres Patentes issued by Duke Ercole II. After the plague in 1505 and the eventual fall of Ferrara in 1551, many of these Jews relocated North towards the economically stable ports in Venice. Venice slowly became a center for conversos who either stopped temporarily on their way to Turkey, or stayed permanently as residents in the ghetto Jewish community port. Venetian leaders were convinced to openly accept conversos to practice Judaism, because they recognized that if conversos were not welcome in Venice, they would take their successful trades to the country’s economic rival of Turkey. A Portuguese converso in Venice, named Abraham de Almeda, connected strongly with Christianity, however, turned to the Jewish members of his family when in need for financial for moral support. As a result, many of the conversos during this period struggled with their Christian and Jewish identities.\n\nConversos in the city of Ancona faced difficult lives living under the pope, and eventually fled to Ferrara in 1555. Portuguese conversos in Ancona were falsely misled that they were welcome to Ancona and that they could openly convert back to Judaism. Their fate was overturned by the succeeding pope, Pope Paul IV. The conversos in Ancona faced traumatic emotional damage after the pope imprisoned 102 conversos who refused to reside in the ghetto and wear badges to distinguish themselves. In 1588, when the duke granted a charter of residence in return for the conversos building up the city’s economy, they refused, due to accumulated skepticism.\n\n\n"}

The book aimed to, in de Lubac's words, retrieve the doctrine that \"the Church makes the eucharist and the eucharist makes the church\".\n\nThe book traces patristic and medieval uses of the Latin phrase \"corpus mysticum\" (\"mystical body\"). In de Lubac's time, especially as evidenced in Pope Pius XII's 1943 encyclical \"Mystici corporis Christi\", this phrase was typically used to refer to the Church as the \"mystical body\" of Christ.\n\nFrom his historical study, however, de Lubac argued that the phrase \"corpus mysticum\" referred initially to Christ's \"eucharistic\" body, and not to the visible Church as an institution. This association had been lost in the late medieval period. De Lubac argued that it was important to recover the pre-modern understanding of \"corpus mysticum\", according to which Christ should be regarded as mystically present and at work where and when the eucharist was being celebrated.\n\nDe Lubac's argument did not have great immediate impact, but was hugely influential in the eucharistic ecclesiology developed (or rehabilitated) at Vatican II.\n\n"}
{"id": "1861989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1861989", "title": "Dawah", "text": "Dawah\n\n\"Da‘wah\" literally means \"issuing a summons\" or \"making an invitation\". Grammatically, the word represents a gerund of a verb with the triconsonantal root \"d-ʕ-w\" meaning variously \"to summon\" or \"to invite\" . A Muslim who practices \"da‘wah\", either as a religious worker or in a volunteer community effort, is called a ' (, plural '/\"\" ).\n\nA \"dā‘ī\", as a person who invites people to understand Islam through dialogue, may be regarded as a missionary inviting people to the faith, prayer and manner of Islamic life.\n\nThe term \"da'wah\" has other senses in the Qur'an. In \"sura\" (chapter) 30:25, for example, it denotes the call to the dead to rise on the Day of Judgment. When used in the Qur'an, it generally refers to Allah's invitation to live according to His will. Thus, when used in the first centuries of Islam, it usually referred to that message and was sometimes used interchangeably with \"sharī‘a\" and \"dīn\".\n\n\"Da‘wah\" is also described as the duty to \"actively encourage fellow Muslims in the pursuance of greater piety in all aspects of their lives\", a definition which has become central to contemporary Islamic thought.\n\nDuring the Expedition of Al Raji in 625, Muhammad sent some men as missionaries to various different tribes. Some men came to Muhammad and requested that Muhammad send instructors to teach them Islam, but the men were bribed by the two tribes of Khuzaymah, who wanted revenge for the assassination of Khalid bin Sufyan (Chief of the Banu Lahyan tribe) by Muhammad's followers. A number of missionaries were killed in this expedition, either eight or, according to another account, ten.\n\nThen during the Expedition of Bir Maona in July 625 Muhammad sent some missionaries at the request of some men from the Banu Amir tribe, but the Muslims were again killed in revenge for the assassination of Khalid bin Sufyan by Muhammad's followers. 70 Muslims were killed during this expedition.\n\nDuring the Expedition of Khalid ibn al-Walid (Banu Jadhimah) in January 630, Muhammad sent Khalid ibn Walid to invite the Banu Jadhimah tribe to Islam. This is mentioned in the Sunni Hadith .\n\nMus`ab ibn `Umair was the first Muslim envoy in September 621. He was sent to Yathrib (now Medina) to teach the people the doctrines of Islam and give them guidance.\n\nAfter Muhammad's death in 632, from the available historical evidence, it appears that after Muhammad's death Muslims did not immediately embark upon da'wa activities—during and after the rapid conquests of the Byzantine and Persian lands, they ventured little if at all to preach to local non-Muslims. Da'wa came into wider usage almost a hundred years after Muhammad's death, in the wake of 'Abbasid propaganda against the then ruling Umayyad clan in the 720s. However, the 'Abbasid da'wa ceased as soon as the 'Abbasids were in power—a fact that attests to its political nature. Da'wa as a truly missionary activity, albeit still within the Muslim Umma, appeared in the form of the Isma'ili da'wa of the 9th through 13th centuries. Isma'ilis, in many ways, can be seen as the pioneers of the organized Muslim missionary activities: their highly institutionalized and sophisticated da'wa structure has hardly been repeated until today. Moreover, for the Isma'ilis, da'wa was a state priority. The Isma'ili da'wa encompassed extra- and intra-ummatic forms and blended both theology and politics.\n\nIn Islamic theology, the purpose of \"da‘wah\" is to invite people, Muslims and non-Muslims, to understand the worship of God as expressed in the Qur'an and the \"sunnah\" of the prophet Muhammad and to inform them about Muhammad.\n\n\"Da'wah\" as the \"Call towards God\" is the means by which Muhammad began spreading the message of the Qur'an to mankind. After Muhammad, his followers and the \"Ummah\" (Muslim community) assumed responsibility for it. They convey the message of the Qur'an by providing information on why and how the Qur'an preaches monotheism. Muhammad saw Islam as the true religion and mission of all earlier prophets. He believed that their call had been limited to their own people but that his was universal. His mission as the final prophet was to repeat to the whole world this call and invitation (dawa) to Islam. Muhammad wrote to various non-Muslim rulers, inviting them to convert.\n\nThe importance of \"Dawah\" has been emphasised many times in the Quran:\n\nIn the \"Hadith\" (\"sayings\") of Muhammad, \"dawah\" is mentioned to emphasise importance and virtues:\n\nMuhammad sent Muadh ibn Jabal to Yemen and told him “You will be going to Christians and Jews, so the first thing you should invite them to is the assertion of the oneness of Allah, Most High. If they realize that, then inform them that Allah has made five daily prayers obligatory on them. If they pray them, then inform them that Allah has made the payment of charity from their wealth obligatory on their rich to be given to their poor. If they accept that, then take it from them and avoid the best part of people’s property.”\n\nWith regard to Muhammad's mild nature in preaching Islam, the Quran says:\nAnd by the mercy of Allah you dealt with them gently. If you were harsh and hardhearted, they would have fled from around you. (Quran ).\n\nThe Quran says about Moses and Aaron who preached to Pharaoh, the claimant of God:\nSo speak to him, both of you, mildly in order that he may reflect or fear God. (Quran ).\n\nMuhammad was reported by his wife, Aisha to have said “Whenever gentleness is in a thing, it beautifies it, and whenever it is withdrawn from something, it defaces.”\n\nMuhammad was quoted by Jareer as saying,“One deprived of gentleness is deprived of all good.\"\n\nMuslims made it a part of their political theory (through relating da'wa to jihad) and life (using the concept of da'wa in their political agendas). Taken in general, the intertwining of da'wa and politics, then, has been a feature throughout the Muslim history, though practical implications of this have been different in different ages.\n\nA classical example of diversion in \"dawah\" can be seen in the case of Prophet Yusuf in prison when two prisoners asked him to interpret their dreams. One of them said: “I saw myself pressing wine.” The other said: “I saw myself carrying bread on my head and birds were eating from it.” They asked: “Inform us of the interpretation of these things. Indeed, we believe you are one of the righteous.” He replied: “Whenever food came to you as your provision, I informed you about it before it came. That is from what my Lord has taught me... As for one of you, he will pour wine for his lord to drink, and as for the other, he will be crucified and birds will eat from his head. This is the case judged concerning which you both inquire.” \"Sura Yusuf\" 12:35–41.\n\nDoing \"dawah\" in the right location. For example, Mount Safa in the time of Muhammad was used for announcements. So Muhammad went there to make his point. He chose that particular location because he knew the people who he was inviting to Islam. He knew their nature and characteristics, so he chose Mount Safa. He climbed up to its summit and addressed his people saying: “O people of Quraysh, if I were to tell you there was an army behind this hill would you listen to me?”\n\nModern \"dawah\" movements are varied in their objectives and activities. Examples include:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1007973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1007973", "title": "Dāna", "text": "Dāna\n\nDāna (Devanagari: दान) is a Sanskrit and Pali word that connotes the virtue of generosity, charity or giving of alms in Indian philosophies. It is alternatively transliterated as \"daana\".\n\nIn Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism, dāna is the practice of cultivating generosity. It can take the form of giving to an individual in distress or need. It can also take the form of philanthropic public projects that empower and help many.\n\nAccording to historical records, dāna is an ancient practice in Indian traditions, tracing back to Vedic traditions.\n\nDāna (Sanskrit: दान) means giving, often in the context of donation and charity. In other contexts, such as rituals, it can simply refer to the act of giving something. Dāna is related to and mentioned in ancient texts with concepts of \"Paropakāra\" (परोपकार) which means benevolent deed, helping others; \"Dakshina\" (दक्षिणा) which means gift or fee one can afford; and \"Bhiksha\" (भिक्षा), which means alms.\n\nDāna has been defined in traditional texts as any action of relinquishing the ownership of what one considered or identified as one's own, and investing the same in a recipient without expecting anything in return.\n\nWhile dāna is typically given to one person or family, Hinduism also discusses charity or giving aimed at public benefit, sometimes called \"utsarga\". This aims at larger projects such as building a rest house, school, drinking water or irrigation well, planting trees, and building care facility among others.\n\nThe \"Rigveda\" has the earliest discussion of \"dāna\" in the Vedas. The \"Rigveda\" relates it to \"satya\" \"truth\" and in another hymn points to the guilt one feels from not giving to those in need. It uses \"da\", the root of word \"dāna\", in its hymns to refer to the act of giving to those in distress. Ralph T. H. Griffith, for example, translates Book 10, Hymn 117 of the Rig veda as follows:\nThe Upanishads, composed before 500 BCE, present some of the earliest Upanishadic discussion of dāna. Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, in verse 5.2.3, states that three characteristics of a good, developed person are self-restraint (damah), compassion or love for all sentient life (daya), and charity (dāna).\n\nChandogya Upanishad, Book III, similarly, states that a virtuous life requires: tapas (asceticism), dāna (charity), arjava (straightforwardness), ahimsa (non-injury to all sentinent beings) and satyavacana (truthfulness).\n\n\"Bhagavad Gita\" describes the right and wrong forms of \"dāna\" in verses 17.20 through 17.22. It defines \"sāttvikam\" (good, enlightened, pure) charity, in verse 17.20, as one given without expectation of return, at the proper time and place, and to a worthy person. It defines \"rajas\" (passion, ego driven, active) charity, in verse 17.21, as one given with the expectation of some return, or with a desire for fruits and results, or grudgingly. It defines \"tamas\" (ignorant, dark, destructive) charity, in verse 17.22, as one given with contempt, to unworthy person(s), at a wrong place and time. In Book 17, Bhadwad Gita suggests steadiness in \"sattvikam dāna\", or the good form of charity is better; and that \"tamas\" should be avoided. These three psychological categories are referred to as the \"guṇas\" in Hindu philosophy.\n\nThe \"Adi Parva\" of the Hindu Epic \"Mahabharata\", in Chapter 91, states that a person must first acquire wealth by honest means, then embark on charity; be hospitable to those who come to him; never inflict pain on any living being; and share a portion with others whatever he consumes. In Chapter 87 of \"Adi Parva\", it calls sweet speech and refusal to use harsh words or wrong others even if you have been wronged, as a form of charity. In the \"Vana Parva\", Chapter 194, the Mahabharata recommends that one must, \"conquer the mean by charity, the untruthful by truth, the wicked by forgiveness, and dishonesty by honesty\". \"Anushasana Parva\" in Chapter 58, recommends public projects as a form of dāna. It discusses the building of drinking water tanks for people and cattle as a noble form of giving, as well as giving of lamps for lighting dark public spaces. In later sections of Chapter 58, it describes planting public orchards, with trees that give fruits to strangers and shade to travelers, as meritorious acts of benevolent charity. In Chapter 59 of Book 13 of the \"Mahabharata\", Yudhishthira and Bhishma discuss the best and lasting gifts between people:\n\nThe \"Bhagavata Purana\" discusses when dāna is proper and when it is improper. In Book 8, Chapter 19, verse 36 it states that charity is inappropriate if it endangers and cripples modest livelihood of one's biological dependents or of one’s own. Charity from surplus income above that required for modest living is recommended in the Puranas.\n\nHindu scriptures exist in many Indian languages. For example, the \"Tirukkuṛaḷ\", written between 200 BCE and 400 CE, is one of the most cherished classics on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. It discusses charity, dedicating Chapter 23 of Book 1 on Virtues to it. \"Tirukkuṛaḷ\" suggests charity is necessary for an virtuous life and happiness. He states in Chapter 23: \"Giving to the poor is true charity, all other giving expects some return\"; \"Great, indeed, is the power to endure hunger.\nGreater still is the power to relieve other's hunger\"; \"Giving alms is a great reward in itself to one who gives\". In Chapter 101, he states: \"Believing wealth is everything, yet giving away nothing, is a miserable state of mind\"; \"Vast wealth can be a curse to one who neither enjoys it nor gives to the worthy\". Like the Mahabharata, Tirukkuṛaḷ also extends the concept of charity to deeds (body), words (speech) and thoughts (mind). It states that a brightly beaming smile, the kindly light of loving eye, and saying pleasant words with sincere heart is a form of charity that every human being should strive to give.\n\nDāna is also used to refer to rituals. For example, in a Hindu wedding, \"kanyādāna\" (कन्यादान) refers to the ritual where a father gives his daughter's hand in marriage to the groom, after asking the groom to promise that he will never fail in his pursuit of dharma (moral and lawful life), artha (wealth) and kama (love). The groom promises to the bride's father, and repeats his promise three times in presence of all gathered as witness.\n\nOther types of charity includes donating means of economic activity and food source. For example, godāna (donation of a cow), bhudāna (भूदान) (donation of land), and \"vidyādāna\" or jñānadāna (विद्यादान, ज्ञानदान): Sharing knowledge and teaching skills, \"aushadhādāna\" (औषधदान): Charity of care for the sick and diseased, \"abhayadāna\"(अभयदान): giving freedom from fear (asylum, protection to someone facing imminent injury), and \"anna dāna\" (अन्नादान): Giving food to the poor, needy and all visitors.\n\nCharity is held as a noble deed in Hinduism, to be done without expectation of any return from those who receive the charity. Some texts reason, referring to the nature of social life, that charity is a form of good karma that affects one's future circumstances and environment, and that good charitable deeds leads to good future life because of the reciprocity principle.\nOther Hindu texts, such as \"Vyasa Samhita\", state that reciprocity may be innate in human nature and social functions but dāna is a virtue in itself, as doing good lifts the nature of one who gives. The texts do not recommend charity to unworthy recipients or where charity may harm or encourage injury to or by the recipient. Dāna, thus, is a dharmic act, requires idealistic-normative approach, and has spiritual and philosophical context. The donor's intent and responsibility for diligence about the effect of dāna on the recipient is considered as important as the dāna itself. While the donor should not expect anything in return with dāna, the donor is expected to make an effort to determine the character of the recipient, likely return to the recipient and to the society. Some medieval era authors state that \"dāna\" is best done with \"shraddha\" (faith), which is defined as being in good will, cheerful, welcoming the recipient of the charity and giving without \"anasuya\" (finding faults in the recipient). These scholars of Hinduism, states Kohler, suggest that charity is most effective when it is done with delight, a sense of \"unquestioning hospitality\", where the \"dāna\" ignores the short term weaknesses as well as the circumstances of the recipient and takes a long term view.\n\nAl-Biruni, the Persian historian, who visited and lived in India for 16 years from about 1017, mentions the practice of charity and almsgiving among Hindus as he observed during his stay. He wrote, \"It is obligatory with them (Hindus) every day to give alms as much as possible.\"\n\n\"Satram\"s, called \"Choultry\", \"Dharamsala\" or \"Chathram\"s in parts of India, have been one expression of Hindu charity. Satrams are shelters (rest houses) for travelers and the poor, with many serving water and free food. These were usually established along the roads connecting major Hindu temple sites in South Asia as well as near major temples.\n\nHindu temples served as charitable institutions. Burton Stein states that South Indian temples collected donations (melvarum) from devotees, during the Chola dynasty and Vijayanagara Empire periods in 1st millennium through first half of 2nd millennium AD. These \"dāna\" were then used to feed people in distress as well as fund public projects such as irrigation and land reclamation.\n\n\"Mitākṣarā\" by Vijñāneśvara is an 11th-century canonical discussion and commentary on dāna, composed under the patronage of Chalukya dynasty. The discussion about charity is included in its thesis on \"ācāra\" (moral conduct).\n\nMajor Sanskrit treatises that discuss ethics, methods and rationale for charity and alms giving in Hinduism include, states Maria Heim, the 12th-century \"Dāna Kānda\" \"Book of Giving\" by Laksmidhara of Kannauj, the 12th-century \"Dāna Sāgara\" \"Sea of Giving\" by Ballālasena of Bengal, and the 14th-century sub-book \"Dānakhanda\" in \"Caturvargacintamani\" \"The Gem of the Four Aims of Human Life\" by Hemadiri of Devagiri (modern Daulatabad, Maharashtra). The first two are few hundred page treatises each, while the third is over a thousand-page compendium on charity, from a region that is now part of modern-day eastern Maharashtra and Telangana; the text influenced Hindus of Deccan region and South India from 14th to 19th centuries.\n\nDāna as a formal religious act is directed specifically to a monastic or spiritually-developed person. In Buddhist thought, it has the effect of purifying and transforming the mind of the giver.\n\nGenerosity developed through giving leads to experience of material wealth and possibly being reborn in happy states. In the Pāli Canon's \"Dighajanu Sutta\", generosity (denoted there by the Pāli word \"cāga\", which can be synonymous with \"dāna\") is identified as one of the four traits conditioning happiness and wealth in the next life. Conversely, lack of giving leads to unhappy states and poverty.\n\nDāna leads to one of the pāramitās or \"perfections\", the \"dānapāramitā\". This can be characterized by unattached and unconditional generosity, giving and letting go.\n\nBuddhists believe that giving without seeking anything in return leads to greater spiritual wealth. Moreover, it reduces the acquisitive impulses that ultimately lead to continued suffering from egotism.\n\nDana is, as with Hindu texts like Mitaksara and Vahni Purana and in Buddhist texts, described as a virtue and duty in Jainism. It is considered an act of compassion, and must be done with no desire for material gain. Four types of Dana are discussed in the texts of Jainism: \"Ahara-dana\" (donation of food), \"Ausadha-dana\" (donation of medicine), \"Jnana-dana\" (donation of knowledge) and \"Abhaya-dana\" (giving of protection or freedom from fear, asylum to someone under threat). Dāna is one of ten means to gain positive karma, in the soteriological theories of Jainism. Medieval era texts of Jainism dedicate a substantial portion of their discussions to the need and virtue of Dāna.\n\nDāna, called Vand Chhako, is considered one of three duties of Sikhs. The duty entails sharing part of one's earnings with others, by giving to charity and caring for others. Examples of dāna in Sikhism include selfless service and langar.\n\n\n\n"}

They form nearly 21%-25% of the population of the Indian state of Punjab. and are thus the second most populous social group there after the Dalits.\n\nAccording to censuses of the British Raj period, most Sikh Jats were converted from Hindu Jats. The relationship between the Hindu, Muslim and Sikh communities of the Punjab region, and between communities such as the Jats and the more martial Rajputs, has been ambiguous over many centuries. The various groups often claim similar origins while asserting their distinctiveness.\n\nSome Jats started to follow the teachings of Guru Nanak in small numbers and these swelled after the formation of the Khalsa. They formed the vanguard of Sikh resistance against the Mughal Empire from the 18th century onwards. W. H. McLeod, basing his work on the martial race theory, says that the Jats began to join Sikhism in large numbers during the period of the sixth guru, Hargobind, but this theory has been rebutted by Jagjit Singh, a Sikh historian.\n\nAt least seven of the 12 Sikh \"Misls\" (Sikh confederacies) were led by Jat Sikhs.\n\nIrfan Habib has argued that Sikhism did much to uplift the social status of Jat people, who were previously regarded in the Punjab as being of Shudra or Vaishya status in the Hindu ritual ranking system of varna.

Löw, Loewe, Löwe, or Levai, (between 1512 and 1526? – 17 September 1609) widely known to scholars of Judaism as the Maharal of Prague, or simply The Maharal, the Hebrew acronym of \"Moreinu Ha-Rav Loew\" (\"Our Teacher, Rabbi Loew\"), was an important Talmudic scholar, Jewish mystic, and philosopher who, for most of his life, served as a leading rabbi in the cities of Mikulov in Moravia and Prague in Bohemia. Due to his unprecedented impact on Jewish study, he is considered one of the most important rabbis of all times.\n\nWithin the world of Torah and Talmudic scholarship, Loew is known for his works on Jewish philosophy and Jewish mysticism and his work \"Gur Aryeh al HaTorah\", a supercommentary on Rashi's Torah commentary. He is also the subject of a 19th-century legend that he created , an animate mythological being fashioned from clay.\n\nRabbi Loew is buried at the Old Jewish Cemetery, Prague in Josefov, where his grave and intact tombstone can still be visited. His descendants' surnames include Braude, Leib, Loewy, Loeb, Lowy, Lowi, Low-Beer, Loew, Oppenheimer, Pfaelzer, Lowenstein and Keim.\n\nThe Maharal was probably born in Poznań, Poland,—though Perels lists the birth town mistakenly as Worms in the Holy Roman Empire—to Rabbi Bezalel (Loew), whose family originated from the Rhenish town of Worms. His birth year is uncertain, with different sources listing 1512, 1520 and 1526. His uncle Jakob ben Chajim was \"Reichsrabbiner\" (\"Rabbi of the Empire\") of the Holy Roman Empire, his brother Chaim of Friedberg a famous rabbinical scholar. There is no documented evidence of his having received formal religious education, leading scholars to conclude that he was an extremely gifted autodidact.\n\nHis family consisted of his wife, Pearl, six daughters, and a son, Bezalel, who became a Rabbi in Kolín, but died early in 1600.\nHe was independently wealthy, probably as a result of his father's successful business enterprises. He accepted a rabbinical position in 1553 as \"Landesrabbiner\" of Moravia at Mikulov (Nikolsburg), directing community affairs but also determining which tractate of the Talmud was to be studied in the communities in that province. He also revised the community statutes on the election and taxation process. Although he retired from Moravia in 1588 at age 68, the communities still considered him an authority long after that.\n\nOne of his activities in Moravia was the rallying against slanderous slurs on legitimacy (\"Nadler\") that were spread in the community against certain families and could ruin the finding of a marriage partner for the children of those families. This phenomenon even affected his own family. He used one of the two yearly grand sermons (between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur 1583) to denounce the phenomenon.\n\nHe moved back to Prague in 1588, where he again accepted a rabbinical position, replacing the retired Isaac Hayoth. He immediately reiterated his views on \"Nadler\". On 23 February 1592, he had an audience with Emperor Rudolf II, which he attended together with his brother Sinai and his son-in-law Isaac Cohen; Prince Bertier was present with the emperor. The conversation seems to have been related to Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism, Hebrew: קַבָּלָה) a subject which held much fascination for the emperor.\n\nIn 1592, the Maharal moved to Poznań, where he had been elected as Chief Rabbi of Poland. In Poznań he composed \"Netivoth Olam\" and part of \"Derech Chaim\" (see below).\n\nAccording to Jewish tradition, the Maharal's family descended patrilineally from the Babylonian Exilarchs (during the era of the geonim) and therefore also from the Davidic dynasty.\n\nTowards the end of his life he moved back to Prague, where he died in 1609. He was buried in the Old Jewish Cemetery, Prague. \n\nHis name \"Löw\" or \"Loew\", derived from the German \"Löwe\", \"lion\" (cf. the Yiddish \"Leib\" of the same origin), is a kinnui or substitute name for the Hebrew Judah or \"Yehuda\", as this name - originally of the tribe of Judah - is traditionally associated with a lion. In the Book of Genesis, the patriarch Jacob refers to his son Judah as a \"Gur Aryeh\", a \"Young Lion\" (Genesis 49:9) when blessing him. In Jewish naming tradition the Hebrew name and the substitute name are often combined as a pair, as in this case. The \"Maharal's\" classic work on the Rashi commentary of the Torah is called the \"Gur Aryeh al HaTorah\" in Hebrew, meaning \"Young Lion [commenting] upon the Torah\".\n\nThe Maharal's tomb in Prague is decorated with a heraldic shield with a lion with two intertwined tails (\"queue fourchee\"), alluding both to his first name and to Bohemia, the arms of which has a two-tailed lion.\n\nIt is unknown how many Talmudic rabbinical scholars the Maharal taught in Moravia, but the main disciples from the Prague period include Rabbis Yom Tov Lipmann Heller and David Ganz. The former promoted his teacher's program of regular Mishnah study by the masses, and composed his \"Tosefoth Yom Tov\" (a Mishnah commentary incorporated into almost all published editions of the Mishnah over the past few hundred years) with this goal in mind. David Ganz died young, but produced the work \"Tzemach David\", a work of Jewish and general history, as well as writing on astronomy; both the MaHaRal and Ganz were in contact with Tycho Brahe, the famous astronomer.\n\nIn the words of a modern writer, the Maharal \"prevented the Balkanization of Jewish thought\" (Rabbi Yitzchak Adlerstein 2000, citing Rabbi Nachman Bulman).\n\nHis works inspired the Polish branch of Hasidism, as well as a more recent wave of Torah scholars originating from Lithuania and Latvia, most markedly Rabbi Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler (1892–1953) as well as Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook (1864–1935). A more recent authority who had roots in both traditions was Rabbi Isaac Hutner (1906–1980). Rabbi Hutner succinctly defined the ethos of the Maharal's teachings as being \"Nistar BeLashon Nigleh\", meaning (in Hebrew): \"The Hidden in the language of the Revealed\". That is, the Maharal couched kabbalistic ideas in non-kabbalistic language. As a mark of his devotion to the ways of the Maharal, Rabbi Hutner bestowed the name of the Maharal's key work the \"Gur Aryeh\" upon a branch of the yeshiva he headed when he established its kollel (a yeshiva for post-graduate Talmud scholars) which then became a division of the Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin in New York during the 1950s, known as Kollel Gur Aryeh. Both of these institutions, and the graduates they produce, continue to emphasize the intellectual teachings of the Maharal. Rabbi Hutner in turn also maintained that Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch (1808–1888) (19th century Germany) must also have been influenced by the Maharal's ideas basing his seemingly rationalistic Weltanschauung on the more abstract and abstruse teachings of the hard-to-understand Jewish Kabbalah.\n\nRabbi Judah Loew was not a champion of the open study of Kabbalah as such, and none of his works are in any way \"openly\" devoted to it. Instead, what they attempt to do is to make the ideas of the Kabbalah (which he held to be the most deeply true of all the Torah) accessible to the average educated reader, by presenting them in a rigorously philosophical form, couched in terms that are accessible to the public. According to R. Loew, only the greatest of Torah scholars are able to perceive the full intent of the Kabbalistic works in their complex entirety. Therefore, although kabbalistic doctrine permeates his writings, it is always presented in a rational and philosophic form. His main kabbalistic influences appear to have been the Zohar, Sefer Yetzirah, and traditions of the Chassidei Ashkenaz, as Lurianic Kabbalah had not by that time reached Europe.\n\nFaced with the Aristotelian interpretation of Talmudic Aggadot by Azariah dei Rossi, he was indignant at what he termed the trivialization of the Sages' deep wisdom. In his work \"Be'er ha-Golah\" he vigorously disputes all of dei Rossi's theses, sternly upholding the subtly allegorical nature of Aggadah and demonstrating its independence from (and superiority to) the superficial observations of natural science. At the same time he was entirely in favor of scientific research, so long as the researcher did not use his observations as permission to contradict the final authority of divine revelation. His constant thesis is that the Talmudic, Midrashic, and Aggadic teachings refer always to matters far beyond the competence of natural science.\n\nAmong his many descendants were Schneur Zalman of Liadi, founder of Chabad Hasidism. Through this paternal line, Loew is the ancestor of many prominent later Jewish individuals, including Menachem Mendel Schneerson, seventh Rebbe of Lubavitch, and Yehudi Menuhin, the famous violinist. Maharal is also the ancestor of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov.\n\nThe Maharal is the subject of the legend about the creation of a golem, a creature made out of clay to defend the Jews of the Prague Ghetto from antisemitic attacks, particularly the blood libel. He is said to have used mystical powers based on the esoteric knowledge of how God created Adam. The general view of historians and critics is that the legend is a German literary invention of the early 19th century. The earliest known source for the story thus far is the 1834 book \"Der Jüdische Gil Blas\" by Friedrich Korn. It has been repeated and adapted many times since.\n\n\nHis works on the holidays bear titles that were inspired by the Biblical verse in I Chronicles 29:11: \"Yours, O Lord, are the greatness, and the might, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and on the earth [is Yours]; Yours is the kingdom and [You are He] Who is exalted over everything as the Leader.\" The book of \"greatness\" (\"gedula\") on the Sabbath was not preserved, but the book of \"power\" (\"gevurah\") is \"Gevurath Hashem\", the book of glory (\"tif'arah\") is \"Tif'ereth Yisrael\", and the book of \"eternity\" or \"victory\" (\"netzach\") is \"Netzach Yisrael\".\n\nIn April 1997, Czech Republic and Israel jointly issued a set of stamps, one of which featured the tombstone of Loew. In May 2009, the Czech Post issued a stamp commemorating the 400th anniversary of Loew’s death. In June 2009 the Czech Mint issued a commemorative coin marking the same milestone.\n\n\n\n"}

They were run ostensibly to house \"fallen women\", an estimated 30,000 of whom were confined in these institutions in Ireland. In 1993, a mass grave containing 155 corpses was uncovered in the convent grounds of one of the laundries. This led to media revelations about the operations of the secretive institutions. A formal state apology was issued in 2013, and a £50 million compensation scheme for survivors was set up by the Irish Government. The religious orders which operated the laundries have rejected activist demands that they financially contribute to this program.\n\nThe \"Dublin Magdalen Asylum,\" (sometimes called \"Magdalen Asylum for Penitent Females\") on Lower Leeson Street was the first such institution in Ireland. It was a Church of Ireland-run institution, and accepted only Protestant women. It was founded in 1765 by Lady Arabella Denny. \nIreland's Catholic-run Magdalene asylums survived the longest. For a list of closing dates of laundries, please read this official report from Justice for Magdalene. Ireland's Magdalene laundries were quietly supported by the state, and operated by religious communities for more than two hundred years.\n\nOn laundries, James Smith asserts that the \"Irish variety took on a distinct character\". Inmates were required to work, primarily in laundries, since the facilities were self-supporting. Andrea Parrot and Nina Cummings wrote, \"The cost of violence, oppression, and brutalization of women is enormous\" and in their struggle to survive, the inmates suffered not only physically, but spiritually and emotionally.\n\nIn Belfast the Church of Ireland-run Ulster Magdalene Asylum was founded in 1839 on Donegall Pass. Similar institutions were run by Catholics on Ormeau Road and by Presbyterians on Whitehall Parade.\n\nIn the late 18th century, the term \"fallen women\" primarily referred to prostitutes, but by the end of the 19th century, Magdalene laundries were filled with many different kinds of women, including girls who were \"not prostitutes at all\", but either \"seduced women\" or women who had yet to engage in sexual activity. According to Frances Finnegan, author of \"Do Penance or Perish: A Study of Magdalen Asylums in Ireland\", \"Missionaries were required to approach prostitutes and distribute religious tracts, designed to be read in 'sober' moments and divert women from their vicious lives\". Furthermore, \"the consignment even of genuine prostitutes\" to these laundries \"seldom reduced their numbers on the streets, any more than did an individual prostitute's death\", because, according to Finnegan, \"so long as poverty continued, and the demand for public women remained, such losses were easily replaced\". Raftery wrote that the institutions were failing to achieve their supposed objective; \"the institutions had little impact on prostitution over the period\", and yet they were continuing to multiply, expand and, most importantly, profit from the free labour. Since they were not paid, Raftery asserted, \"it seems clear that these girls were used as a ready source of free labour for these laundry businesses\". Additionally, the state of Ireland and its government was heavily intertwined with religion. Finnegan wrote:\n\nFinnegan wrote that based on historical records, the religious institutes had motivations other than simply wanting to curtail prostitution; these multiple motivations led to the multiplication of these facilities. According to Finnegan, as the motivations started to range from a need to maintain social and moral order within the bounds of patriarchal structure, to a desire to continue profiting from a free workforce, Magdalen laundries became a part of a large structure of suppression. \nWith the multiplication of these institutions and the subsequent and \"dramatic rise\" in the number of beds available within them, Finnegan wrote that the need to staff the laundries \"became increasingly urgent\". This urgency, Finnegan claims, resulted in a new definition of \"fallen\" women, one that was much less precise and was expanding to include any women who appeared to challenge traditional notions of Irish morality. She further asserted that this new definition resulted in even more suffering, \"especially among those increasing numbers who were not prostitutes but unmarried mothers – forced to give up their babies as well as their lives\". And as this concept of \"fallen\" expanded, so did the facilities, in both physical size and role in society.\n\nWomen were branded as both a mother and a criminal if they happened to have a child out of wedlock. The choices the women at the time had were very limited. They had no social welfare system; therefore many resorted to prostitution or entered these mother and child homes, also known as Magdalen Laundries.\n\nSeveral religious institutes established even more Irish laundries, reformatories and industrial schools, sometimes all together on the same plot of land, with the aim to \"save the souls primarily of women and children\". Examples were Sisters of Our Lady of Charity of Refuge and the Congregation of the Sisters of Mercy, who ran the largest laundries in Dublin. These \"large complexes\" became a \"massive interlocking system…carefully and painstakingly built up…over a number of decades\"; and consequently, Magdalen laundries became part of Ireland's \"larger system for the control of children and women\" (Raftery 18). Women and \"bastard\" children were both \"incarcerated for transgressing the narrow moral code of the time\" and the same religious congregations managed the orphanages, reformatory schools and laundries. Thus, these facilities \"all helped sustain each other – girls from the reformatory and industrial schools often ended up working their entire lives in the Magdalen laundries\". \nAlmost all the institutions were run by female religious congregations,” i.e. sisters, and were scattered throughout the country \"in prominent locations in towns and cities\". In this way, according to Raftery, they were powerful and pervasive, able to effectively control the lives of women and children from \"all classes\". \nThis second incarnation of Magdalen laundries vastly differed from the first incarnation, due to their \"longevity\" and \"their diverse community of female inmates, including hopeless cases, mental defectives…[and] transfers from industrial and reformatory schools\". These particular institutions intentionally shared \"overriding characteristics, including a regime of prayer, silence, work in a laundry, and a preference for permanent inmates\", which, as Smith notes, \"contradicts the religious congregations' stated mission to protect, reform, and rehabilitate\".\nAs this expansion was taking place and these laundries were becoming a part of a large network of institutions, the treatment of the girls was becoming increasingly violent and abusive. According to Finnegan and Smith, the asylums became \"particularly cruel\", \"more secretive\" in nature and \"emphatically more punitive\". Though these women had committed no crime and had never been put on trial, their indefinite incarceration was enforced by locked doors, iron gates and prison guards in the form of apathetic sisters. By 1920, according to Smith, Magdalen laundries had almost entirely abandoned claims of rehabilitation and instead, were \"seamlessly incorporated into the state's architecture of containment\".\n\nAccording to historian Frances Finnegan, in the beginning of these asylums' existence, because many of the women had a background as prostitutes, the women (who were called \"children\") were regarded as \"in need of penitence\", and until the 1970s were required to address all staff members as \"mother\" regardless of age. To enforce order and maintain a monastic atmosphere, the inmates were required to observe strict silence for much of the day.\n\nAs the phenomenon became more widespread, it extended beyond prostitution to petty criminals, orphans, mentally disabled women and abused girls. A 2013 report made by an inter-departmental committee chaired by Senator Martin McAleese found no evidence of unmarried women giving birth in the asylum. Even young girls who were considered too promiscuous and flirtatious, or too beautiful, were sent to an asylum by their families. This paralleled the practice in state-run lunatic asylums in Britain and Ireland in the same period, where many people with alleged \"social dysfunction\" were committed to asylums. Without a family member on the outside who could vouch for them, many incarcerated individuals stayed in the asylums for the rest of their lives, many taking religious vows.\n\nGiven Ireland's historically conservative sexual values, Magdalen asylums were a generally accepted social institution until well into the second half of the twentieth century. They disappeared with changes in sexual mores—or, as Finnegan suggests, as they ceased to be profitable: \"Possibly the advent of the washing machine has been as instrumental in closing these laundries as have changing attitudes.\"\n\nAn estimated 30,000 women were confined in these institutions in the 19th and 20th centuries, about 10,000 of whom were admitted since Ireland's independence in 1922. Smith asserts that \"we do not know how many women resided in the Magdalen institutions\" after 1900. Vital information about the women's circumstances, the number of women, and the consequences of their incarceration is unknown. \"We have no official history for the Magdalen asylum in twentieth-century Ireland\", Smith wrote. Due to the religious institutes' \"policy of secrecy\", their penitent registers and convent annals remain closed to this day, despite repeated requests for information. As a direct result of these missing records and the religious institutes' commitment to secrecy, Magdalen laundries can only exist \"at the level of story rather than history\". Though Ireland's last Magdalen asylum imprisoned women until 1996, there are no records to account for \"almost a full century\" of women who now \"constitute the nation's disappeared\", who were \"excluded, silenced, or punished\", and whom Smith says \"did not matter or matter enough\" to a society that \"sought to negate and render invisible their challenges\" to conceived notions of moral order.\n\nIn Dublin in 1993, the Sisters of Our Lady of Charity had lost money in share dealings on the stock exchange; to cover their losses, they sold part of the land in their convent to a property developer. This led to the discovery of 133 corpses in a mass grave. The Sisters arranged to have the remains cremated and reburied in another mass grave at Glasnevin Cemetery, splitting the cost of the reburial with the developer who had bought the land. It later transpired that there were 22 more corpses than the sisters had applied for permission to exhume. In all, 155 corpses were exhumed and cremated.\n\nThough not initially reported, this eventually triggered a public scandal, bringing unprecedented attention to the secretive institutions. In 1999, former asylum inmates Mary Norris, Josephine McCarthy and Mary-Jo McDonagh gave accounts of their treatment. The 1997 Channel 4 documentary \"Sex in a Cold Climate\" interviewed former inmates of Magdalene Asylums who testified to continued sexual, psychological and physical abuse while being isolated from the outside world for an indefinite amount of time. Allegations about the conditions in the convents and the treatment of the inmates were made into an award-winning 2002 film \"The Magdalene Sisters\", written and directed by Peter Mullan.\n\nIn June 2011, Mary Raftery wrote in \"The Irish Times\" that in the early 1940s, some Irish state institutions, such as the army, switched from commercial laundries to \"institutional laundries\" (Magdalene laundries). At the time, there was concern in the Dáil that workers in commercial laundries were losing jobs because of the switch to institutional laundries. Oscar Traynor, Minister for Defence, said the contracts with the Magdalene laundries \"contain a fair wages clause\", though the women in those laundries did not receive wages.\n\nThe \"Irish Times\" revealed that a ledger listed Áras an Uachtaráin, Guinness, Clerys, the Gaiety Theatre, Dr Steevens' Hospital, the Bank of Ireland, the Department of Defence, the Departments of Agriculture and Fisheries, CIÉ, Portmarnock Golf Club, Clontarf Golf Club and several leading hotels amongst those who used a Magdalene laundry. This was unearthed by Steven O' Riordan, a young Irish film-maker who directed and produced a documentary, \"The Forgotten Maggies\". It is the only Irish-made documentary on the subject and was launched at The Galway Film Fleadh 2009. It was screened on the Irish television station TG4 in 2011, attracting over 360,000 viewers. The documentary's website notes that a group called Magdalene Survivors Together was set up after the release of the documentary, because so many Magdalene women came forward after its airing. The women who appeared in the documentary were the first Magdalene women to meet with Irish government officials. They brought national and international attention to the subject.\n\nSince 2001, the Irish government has acknowledged that women in the Magdalene laundries were victims of abuse. However, the Irish government has resisted calls for investigation and proposals for compensation; it maintains the laundries were privately run and abuses at the laundries are outside the government's remit. In contrast to these claims, evidence exists that Irish courts routinely sent women convicted of petty crimes to the laundries, the government awarded lucrative contracts to the laundries without any insistence on protection and fair treatment of their workers, and Irish state employees helped keep laundry facilities stocked with workers by bringing women to work there and returning escaped workers.\n\nHaving lobbied the government of Ireland for two years for investigation of the history of the Magdalene laundries, advocacy group Justice for Magdalenes presented its case to the United Nations Committee Against Torture, alleging that the conditions within the Magdalene laundries and the exploitation of their labourers amounted to human-rights violations. On 6 June 2011, the panel urged Ireland to \"investigate allegations that for decades women and girls sent to work in Catholic laundries were tortured.\" In response the Irish government set up a committee chaired by Senator Martin McAleese, to establish the facts of the Irish state's involvement with the Magdalene laundries.\n\nFollowing the 18-month inquiry, the committee published its report on 5 February 2013, finding \"significant\" state collusion in the admission of thousands of women into the institutions. The report found over 11,000 women had entered laundries since 1922. Significant levels of verbal abuse to women inside was reported but there were no suggestions of regular physical or sexual abuse. Elderly survivors said they would go on hunger strike over the failure of successive Irish governments to set up a financial redress scheme for the thousands of women enslaved there. Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Enda Kenny, while professing sorrow at the abuses revealed, did not issue an immediate apology, prompting criticism from other members of Dáil Éireann. Kenny promised \"there would be a full Dáil debate on the report in two weeks time when people had an opportunity to read the report\". Survivors were critical that an apology had not been immediately forthcoming.\n\nOn 19 February 2013, the Taoiseach Enda Kenny issued a formal state apology. He described the laundries as \"the nation's shame\" and said, \n\"Therefore, I, as Taoiseach, on behalf of the State, the government and our citizens deeply regret and apologise unreservedly to all those women for the hurt that was done to them, and for any stigma they suffered, as a result of the time they spent in a Magdalene Laundry.\"\nThe Taoiseach also outlined part of the compensation package to be offered to victims of the Magdalene Laundries. He stated: \n\"That's why the Government has today asked the President of the Law Reform Commission Judge John Quirke to undertake a three month review and to make recommendations as to the criteria that should be applied in assessing the help that the government can provide in the areas of payments and other supports, including medical card, psychological and counselling services and other welfare needs.\"\n\nIn February 2013, a few days after the publication of the McAleese Report, two sisters gave an interview for RTÉ Radio 1 under conditions of anonymity for themselves and their institute. They described the Irish media coverage of the abuse at the laundries (which they claimed not to have participated in), as a \"one-sided anti-Catholic forum\". They displayed no remorse for the institutes' past: \"Apologize for what? Apologize for providing a service? We provided a free service for the country\". They complained that \"all the shame of the era is being dumped on the religious orders... the sins of society are being placed on us\". On hearing the interview, a survivors' group announced to the press that they were \"shocked, horrified and enormously upset\" by the sisters' portrayal of events.\n\nIn a detailed commentary by the president of the Catholic League, a U.S. advocacy group, published in July 2013, it is claimed that \"No one was imprisoned, nor forced against her will to stay. There was no slave labor, ... It’s all a lie.\" The inmates are described as \"prostitutes, and women seen as likely candidates for the 'world’s oldest profession'. Unmarried women, especially those who gave birth out-of-wedlock, were likely candidates. Contrary to what has been reported, the laundries were not imposed on these women: they were a realistic response to a growing social problem [prostitution].\"\n\nIn 1955, while the abuse of inmates was still occurring, the English writer Halliday Sutherland was touring Ireland to collect material for his book \"Irish Journey\". When he applied for permission to visit the Galway asylum, Michael Browne, the local bishop, reluctantly granted him access only on condition that he allow his account to be censored by the Mother Superior.\n\nThe religious institutes, the Sisters of Mercy, Sisters of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd, and Sisters of Charity, have refused demands from the Irish government, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the UN Committee Against Torture to contribute to the compensation fund for surviving victims, an estimated 600 of whom were still alive in March 2014.\n\nIn 2011 a monument was erected in Ennis at the site of the former Industrial School and Magdalene laundry in appreciation of the Sisters of Mercy. As recently as 2015, Ennis Municipal Local Council felt confident enough (despite the findings of the McAleese and Ryan reports) to rename a road (which ran through the site of the former Industrial School and Laundry) in honour of the Sisters of Mercy. There are conflicting views to the appropriateness of these gestures in this County Clare town.\n\n\"The Magdalene Sisters\", a 2002 film by Peter Mullan, is centered on four young women incarcerated in a Dublin Magdalen Laundry from 1964 to 1968. The film is loosely based on and \"largely inspired\" by the 1998 documentary \"Sex in a Cold Climate,\" which documents four survivors' accounts of their experiences in Ireland's Magdalen institutions. One survivor who saw Mullan's film claimed that the reality of Magdalen asylums was \"a thousand times worse\".\n\nJames Smith wrote that \"Mullan offsets the long historical silence\" that allowed the laundries and the violations of the religious institutes to \"maintain their secrecy and invisibility\".\n\nThe film is a product of a collective, including the four survivors (Martha Cooney, Christina Mulcahy, Phyllis Valentine, Brigid Young) who told their story in \"Sex in a Cold Climate\", the historical consultant and researchers of the documentary who contributed historical information (Miriam Akhtar, Beverely Hopwood and Frances Finnegan), the directors of both movies (Steve Humphries and Peter Mullan, respectively), the screenwriter of \"The Magdalene Sisters\" who created a narrative (Peter Mullan again) and the actors in the film.\n\n\n\n\n\nSources\n\n\n"}

Throughout her life she suffered from debilitating diseases and was subject to various demonic possessions and visions. Her numerous visions were of Jesus Christ and through Him saw Heaven while also receiving the stigmata herself.\n\nBolognesi was beatified on 7 September 2013 and Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the beatification on the behalf of Pope Francis. The beatification cause opened under Pope John Paul II in 1992 while Pope Benedict XVI had named her as Venerable in mid-2012.\n\nMaria Bolognesi was born as Maria Semiolo on 21 October 1924 in Rovigo to Giuseppe Samiolo. Her natural father - himself illegitimate - did not want to wed her mother and split from her which left Bolognesi to live until 1929 in her mother's home with her mother's name. Her maternal grandmother Cornetto Cesira was perhaps the most influential individual in her childhood in terms of instilling in the girl a religious education and love for God. Bolognesi received the name of her stepfather after her mother married Giuseppe Bolognesi in 1929; the pair went to live with him. Her step-grandfather was Luigi Bolognesi.\n\nIn 1932 she ran a high fever and her mother at the same time had contracted meningitis and was on her deathbed. Bolognesi had begun to prepare for her First Communion at this time and the nun that was instructing her at the time told her that Jesus Christ would grant her a wish. She wished that her mother would recover and she managed to recover from the disease; Bolognesi went on to make her First Communion on 22 May 1932 with much emotion.\n\nHer stepfather often beat her mother due to his somewhat abrasive nature but he and her mother still had their son Luigi on 21 June 1940. In summer 1941 she received demonic possession and could not enter a church as a result with the blessings of priests failing to have an effect on her. She was at one stage even tied to a chair so that Father Santo Magro could bless her but this too failed. Bolognesi was taken to a mental hospital for evaluation but the Bishop of Rovigo Guido Maria Mazzocco blessed her from the window of his residence before she was taken there. The doctors later deemed her to be sane because she felt normal and was relieved of the possession.\n\nShe grew up in a poor household and was able to attend the first and second grade of her initial schooling while her peers often marginalized her. She dropped out of school as a child in order to work to support her parents and siblings and worked as an agricultural laborer in order to achieve this.\n\nBolognesi received her first vision of Jesus Christ in the evening of 1–2 April - on the occasion of Holy Thursday - bestowing upon her three rings and five rubies which was a representation of the Five Wounds. In the vision the Lord assured her that she would learn how to read and also promised her that her mother would turn from her sins - her mother began converting back to the faith on 15 March 1947. Around this time her spiritual director was the old priest Bassiano Paiato. On 8 May 1942 she had another vision of Christ. On 11 April 1942 she began to wear a black habit with the express permission of Father Paiato. Difficulties began to arise at this time for Father Magro became skeptical of her experiences and began to besmirch her in public to his parishioners. Difficulties escalated on 5 March 1948 when three male criminals attacked her while back on 27 February the Lord had warned her about this and told her that her guardian angel would be there with her. Bolognesi was knocked unconscious and was tied and muffled with flesh stripped from her legs and hands. She was left injured in the snow with two toenails almost torn off. Because people were skeptical of this the police sergeant took her to the magistrate and accused her of having faked the account though she was later absolved of these charges on 25 October 1948.\n\nIn the 1940s she began to suffer from arthritis as well as suffering from both colitis and appendicitis while almost becoming blind in 1950. For treatment she would often have to go to Rovigo and Padua. Her new spiritual director from 28 June 1951 was Mgr. Rodolfo Barbieri and her first meeting with him was less than a month after. Bolognesi looked after orphans and assisted children whose parents were without jobs and would also make frequent visits to the sick in hospitals. In 1944 she gained the pierced wound on her side while in July 1951 suffering the pain of the Lord's flagellation; this culminated on 25 January 1954 when she wrote in her spiritual journal of a wound that had opened up in her right hand - the first signs of the stigmata. In August 1954 she resided with some Augustinian nuns in Ferrara and there received the wounds in her feet; she was hospitalized in February 1955 and had a vision telling her to leave Rovigo on 16 March. She went to a spiritual retreat in Sperlinga and received the left wound of the stigmata on 2 April 1955. En route back home from Sperlinga she stopped at San Giovanni Rotondo where she had a fever and her shoes full of blood. She found an inn and remained there and had a vision of Christ on Good Friday 8 April 1955 at 3:00pm.\n\nBarberi's poor health led to Mgr. Adelino Marenga becoming her new spiritual director on 24 September 1956 and she met him in their first meeting on the following 14 October. Bolognesi received a vision of Christ again at 3:00pm on 1 November 1957 in which He took her to see both Heaven and Purgatory and in spring 1958 was bedridden until 1959. She visited the tomb of Saint Gemma Galgani in Lucca on 29 September 1959 - to whom she fostered a devotion to. On 3 July 1959 she had another vision in which Christ said He would take her to Heaven and she saw it again on the following 6 July. She saw Heaven once again on 21 October 1959 at 2:00am in which she was roused from her sleep and then again on 22 January 1960. Marenga died in 1964 and her final spiritual director was Mgr. Aldo Balduin.\n\nBolognesi suffered a heart attack in 1971. She had taken up painting in 1968 due to poor health that led to this heart attack. It was said that Padre Pio used to appear to her in bilocation in her Rovigo home even after the friar had died in 1968.\n\nBolognesi died due to a heart attack on 30 January 1980 at 2:00am and her remains were later transferred to the parish of Bosaro.\n\nThe beatification process opened under Pope John Paul II on 18 February 1992 in which she was titled as a Servant of God after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \"nihil obstat\" to the cause in which it allowed for it to open on a diocesan level.

{"id": "20775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20775", "title": "Midas", "text": "Midas\n\nMidas (; ) is the name of at least three members of the royal house of Phrygia.\n\nThe most famous King Midas is popularly remembered in Greek mythology for his ability to turn everything he touched into gold. This came to be called the \"golden touch\", or the \"Midas touch\". The Phrygian city Midaeum was presumably named after this Midas, and this is probably also the Midas that according to Pausanias founded Ancyra. According to Aristotle, legend held that Midas died of starvation as a result of his \"vain prayer\" for the gold touch. The legends told about this Midas and his father Gordias, credited with founding the Phrygian capital city Gordium and tying the Gordian Knot, indicate that they were believed to have lived sometime in the 2nd millennium BC, well before the Trojan War. However, Homer does not mention Midas or Gordias, while instead mentioning two other Phrygian kings, Mygdon and Otreus.\n\nAnother King Midas ruled Phrygia in the late 8th century BC, up until the sacking of Gordium by the Cimmerians, when he is said to have committed suicide. Most historians believe this Midas is the same person as the \"Mita\", called king of the Mushki in Assyrian texts, who warred with Assyria and its Anatolian provinces during the same period. \n\nA third Midas is said by Herodotus to have been a member of the royal house of Phrygia and the grandfather of an Adrastus who fled Phrygia after accidentally killing his brother and took asylum in Lydia during the reign of Croesus. Phrygia was by that time a Lydian subject. Herodotus says that Croesus regarded the Phrygian royal house as \"friends\" but does not mention whether the Phrygian royal house still ruled as (vassal) kings of Phrygia.\n\nThere are many, and often contradictory, legends about the most ancient King Midas. In one, Midas was king of Pessinus, a city of Phrygia, who as a child was adopted by King Gordias and Cybele, the goddess whose consort he was, and who (by some accounts) was the goddess-mother of Midas himself. Some accounts place the youth of Midas in Macedonian Bermion (See Bryges). In Thracian Mygdonia, Herodotus referred to a wild rose garden at the foot of Mount Bermion as \"the garden of Midas son of Gordias, where roses grow of themselves, each bearing sixty blossoms and of surpassing fragrance\". Herodotus says elsewhere that Phrygians anciently lived in Europe where they were known as Bryges, and the existence of the garden implies that Herodotus believed that Midas lived prior to a Phrygian migration to Anatolia.\n\nAccording to some accounts, Midas had a son, Lityerses, the demonic reaper of men, but in some variations of the myth he instead had a daughter, Zoë or \"life\". According to other accounts he had a son Anchurus.\n\nArrian gives an alternative story of the descent and life of Midas. According to him, Midas was the son of Gordios, a poor peasant, and a Telmissian maiden of the prophetic race. When Midas grew up to be a handsome and valiant man, the Phrygians were harassed by civil discord, and consulting the oracle, they were told that a wagon would bring them a king, who would put an end to their discord. While they were still deliberating, Midas arrived with his father and mother, and stopped near the assembly, wagon and all. They, comparing the oracular response with this occurrence, decided that this was the person whom the god told them the wagon would bring. They therefore appointed Midas king and he, putting an end to their discord, dedicated his father’s wagon in the citadel as a thank-offering to Zeus the king. In addition to this the following saying was current concerning the wagon, that whosoever could loosen the cord of the yoke of this wagon, was destined to gain the rule of Asia. This someone was to be Alexander the Great. In other versions of the legend, it was Midas' father Gordias who arrived humbly in the cart and made the Gordian Knot.\n\nHerodotus said that a \"Midas son of Gordias\" made an offering to the Oracle of Delphi of a royal throne \"from which he made judgments\" that were \"well worth seeing\", and that this Midas was the only foreigner to make an offering to Delphi before Gyges of Lydia. The historical Midas of the 8th century BC and Gyges are believed to have been contemporaries, so it seems most likely that Herodotus believed that the throne was donated by the earlier, legendary King Midas. However, some historians believe that this throne was donated by the later, historical King Midas.\n\nOne day, as Ovid relates in \"Metamorphoses\" XI, Dionysus found that his old schoolmaster and foster father, the satyr Silenus, was missing. The old satyr had been drinking wine and wandered away drunk, to be found by some Phrygian peasants who carried him to their king, Midas (alternatively, Silenus passed out in Midas' rose garden). Midas recognized him and treated him hospitably, entertaining him for ten days and nights with politeness, while Silenus delighted Midas and his friends with stories and songs. On the eleventh day, he brought Silenus back to Dionysus in Lydia. Dionysus offered Midas his choice of whatever reward he wished for. Midas asked that whatever he might touch should be changed into gold.\n\nMidas rejoiced in his new power, which he hastened to put to the test. He touched an oak twig and a stone; both turned to gold. Overjoyed, as soon as he got home, he touched every rose in the rose garden, and all became gold. He ordered the servants to set a feast on the table. Upon discovering how even the food and drink turned into gold in his hands, he regretted his wish and cursed it. Claudian states in his \"In Rufinum\": \"So Midas, king of Lydia, swelled at first with pride when he found he could transform everything he touched to gold; but when he beheld his food grow rigid and his drink harden into golden ice then he understood that this gift was a bane and in his loathing for gold, cursed his prayer.\"\n\nIn a version told by Nathaniel Hawthorne in \"A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys\" (1852), Midas' daughter came to him, upset about the roses that had lost their fragrance and become hard, and when he reached out to comfort her, found that when he touched his daughter, she turned to gold as well. Now, Midas hated the gift he had coveted. He prayed to Dionysus, begging to be delivered from starvation. Dionysus heard his prayer, and consented; telling Midas to wash in the river Pactolus. Then, whatever he put into the water would be reversed of the touch.\n\nMidas did so, and when he touched the waters, the power flowed into the river, and the river sands turned into gold. This explained why the river Pactolus was so rich in gold, and the wealth of the dynasty claiming Midas as its forefather no doubt the impetus for this origin myth. Gold was perhaps not the only metallic source of Midas' riches: \"King Midas, a Phrygian, son of Cybele, first discovered black and white lead\".\n\nMidas, now hating wealth and splendor, moved to the country and became a worshipper of Pan, the god of the fields and satyrs. Roman mythographers asserted that his tutor in music was Orpheus.\n\nOnce, Pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo, and challenged Apollo to a trial of skill (also see Marsyas). Tmolus, the mountain-god, was chosen as umpire. Pan blew on his pipes and, with his rustic melody, gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, Midas, who happened to be present. Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre. Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and all but one agreed with the judgment. Midas dissented, and questioned the justice of the award. Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and said \"Must have ears of an ass!\", which caused Midas's ears to become those of a donkey. The myth is illustrated by two paintings, \"Apollo and Marsyas\" by Palma il Giovane (1544–1628), one depicting the scene before, and one after, the punishment. Midas was mortified at this mishap. He attempted to hide his misfortune under an ample turban or headdress, but his barber of course knew the secret, so was told not to mention it. However, the barber could not keep the secret. He went out into the meadow, dug a hole in the ground, whispered the story into it, then covered the hole up. A thick bed of reeds later sprang up in the meadow, and began whispering the story, saying \"King Midas has an ass' ears\". Some sources said that Midas killed himself by drinking the blood of an ox.\nSarah Morris demonstrated (Morris, 2004) that donkeys' ears were a Bronze Age royal attribute, borne by King Tarkasnawa (Greek Tarkondemos) of Mira, on a seal inscribed in both Hittite cuneiform and Luwian hieroglyphs. In this connection, the myth would appear for Greeks to justify the exotic attribute.\n\nThe stories of the contests with Apollo of Pan and Marsyas were very often confused, so Titian's \"Flaying of Marsyas\" includes a figure of Midas (who may be a self-portrait), though his ears seem normal.\n\nIn pre-Islamic legend of Central Asia, the king of the Ossounes of the Yenisei basin had donkey's ears. He would hide them, and order each of his barbers murdered to hide his secret. The last barber among his people was counselled to whisper the heavy secret into a well after sundown, but he didn't cover the well afterwards. The well water rose and flooded the kingdom, creating the waters of Lake Issyk-Kul.\n\nAccording to an Irish legend, the king Labraid Loingsech had horse's ears, something he was concerned to keep quiet. He had his hair cut once a year, and the barber, who was chosen by lot, was immediately put to death. A widow, hearing that her only son had been chosen to cut the king's hair, begged the king not to kill him, and he agreed, so long as the barber kept his secret. The burden of the secret was so heavy that the barber fell ill. A druid advised him to go to a crossroads and tell his secret to the first tree he came to, and he would be relieved of his burden and be well again. He told the secret to a large willow. Soon after this, however, a harper named Craiftine broke his instrument, and made a new one out of the very willow the barber had told his secret to. Whenever he played it, the harp sang \"Labraid Lorc has horse's ears\". Labraid repented of all the barbers he had put to death and admitted his secret.\n\nThe King Midas who ruled Phrygia in the late 8th century BC is known from Greek and Assyrian sources. According to the former, he married a Greek princess, Damodice daughter of Agamemnon of Cyme, and traded extensively with the Greeks. Damodice is credited with inventing coined money by Julius Pollux after she married Midas. Some historians believe this Midas donated the throne that Herodotus says was offered to the Oracle of Delphi by \"Midas son of Gordias\" (see above). Assyrian tablets from the reign of Sargon II record attacks by a \"Mita\", king of the Mushki, against Assyria's eastern Anatolian provinces. Some historians believe Assyrian texts called this Midas king of the \"Mushki\" because he had subjected the eastern Anatolian people of that name and incorporated them into his army. Greek sources including Strabo say that Midas committed suicide by drinking bulls' blood during an attack by the Cimmerians, which Eusebius dated to around 695 BC and Julius Africanus to around 676 BC. Archeology has confirmed that Gordium was destroyed and burned around that time.\n\nIn 1957, Rodney Young and a team from the University of Pennsylvania opened a chamber tomb at the heart of the Great Tumulus (in Greek, Μεγάλη Τούμπα)—53 metres in height, about 300 metres in diameter—on the site of ancient Gordion (modern Yassihöyük, Turkey), where there are more than 100 tumuli of different sizes and from different periods. They discovered a royal burial, its timbers dated as cut to about 740 BC complete with remains of the funeral feast and \"the best collection of Iron Age drinking vessels ever uncovered\". This inner chamber was rather large: 5.15 metres by 6.2 metres in breadth and 3.25 metres high. On the remains of a wooden coffin in the northwest corner of the tomb lay a skeleton of a man 1.59 metres in height and about 60 years old. In the tomb were found an ornate inlaid table, two inlaid serving stands, and eight other tables, as well as bronze and pottery vessels and bronze fibulae. Although no identifying texts were originally associated with the site, it was called Tumulus MM (for \"Midas Mound\") by the excavator. As this funerary monument was erected before the traditional date given for the death of King Midas in the early 7th century BC, it is now generally thought to have covered the burial of his father.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10773260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10773260", "title": "Nydam Mose", "text": "Nydam Mose\n\nNydam Mose (\"Nydam Bog\") is an archaeological site located at Øster Sottrup, a town located in Sundeved, eight kilometres from Sønderborg, Denmark.\n\nIn the Iron Age, the site of the bog was a sacred place, where the weapons and ships of vanquished armies were offered to the indigenous gods in thanks for victory over the fallen enemy. Many items were deliberately destroyed (bent, broken or hacked into pieces) in ritual sacrificial acts, from the period 200 to 400 AD. Nydam Bog has played a role in the Danish national claim for Southern Jutland.\n\nThe first known finds from the bog date from the 1830s, when a local farmer gave old swords and shields as toys to his children.\n\nAmongst numerous other items, three boats were found in Nydam Bog. In particular, the 23 metre long oak boat, commonly known as \"the Nydam Boat\", maintains a distinguished position amongst Danish Iron Age finds, as it is the oldest known rowing vessel in Northern Europe. The oak (\"egetræsbåden\") boat is on display at the archaeological museum in Gottorp Castle, Schleswig, Germany.\n\nFrom 1859 to 1863, archaeologist Conrad Engelhardt excavated the bog. Engelhardt found weapons, tools, pieces of clothing and two intact clinker built boats, one made of oak and one made of pine. The weapons include lances, spears, bows, arrows and round shields. Under these finds were the remains of a third boat, which apparently had been demolished already during the sacrifice. \n\nEngelhardt’s work ceased with the outbreak of the Second Schleswig War in early 1864. Some of the discoveries from the bog were lost during the Second Schleswig War. The smaller of the two boats, perhaps 19 meters long and made of pine, was hacked up and used as firewood by troops.\n\nThe National Museum of Denmark resumed excavation of the bog in 1989. During excavation a large quantity of weapons have come to light, in the form of swords, spears, bows and arrows; and also personal effects such as belt buckles, brooches and ornate clasps. These finds originate from the Iron Age, in the period between 250 and 550.\n\nThe sacrifice site was probably used on different occasions during the years 200–450. The oak boat was the first boat found, and the only one still preserved. It has been dendro dated to 310–320. The oak boat is considered the oldest Nordic shipfind and the oldest known clinker built boat. It is 23 m long, c 4 m wide, of clinker type, and built for 15 pairs of oars. The Nydam Boat is the largest and best preserved of the boats found in Nydam Bog and is now displayed at Gottorf Castle in Schleswig, Germany. It once weighed over three tonnes and was rowed by thirty men.\n\nInterest in the archaeology of Nydam Bog has always been particularly lively in the local area. The Nydam discoveries were and remain a significant theme in the relationship between Danish and German cultures in the border region. On this basis, the \"Society for Nydam Research\" – commonly known as the Nydam Society - was formed in 1983. Through its work, this interest group has contributed to the resumption of National Museum of Denmark’s investigation of the bog.\n\nToday, the site is a green meadow. Parking is available on Nydamvej. From here, there is a path (\"Nydamstien\") to the small white house, \"Nydamhuset\", which is situated beside the site of the archaeological discoveries. It takes about 10 minutes to walk there.\n\nThe Nydam Society's long-standing desire to build a replica of the Nydam Boat has been realized. The Nydam Tveir was built employing the techniques of the time – both to exploit the material characteristics of the timber and to develop an understanding of how large vessels were built in that period. Construction of a replica of the Nydam Boat was based on the oak boat found in 1859. The construction of the Nydam Boat was divided into two phases. Phase 1 was a feasibility study to investigate the construction of the boat. Here the builders investigated prerequisites and gathered experience for use in Phase 2, which comprised building the complete boat.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1269353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1269353", "title": "Philosophy in the Bedroom", "text": "Philosophy in the Bedroom\n\nPhilosophy in the Boudoir (\"La philosophie dans le boudoir\") is a 1795 book by the Marquis de Sade written in the form of a dramatic dialogue. Though initially considered a work of pornography, the book has come to be considered a socio-political drama. Set in a bedroom, the two lead characters make the argument that the only moral system that reinforces the recent political revolution is libertinism, and that if the people of France fail to adopt the libertine philosophy, France will be destined to return to a monarchic state. In the chapter titled \"Fifth Dialogue\", there is a lengthy section where the character Chevalier reads a philosophical pamphlet titled \"Frenchmen, Some More Effort If You Wish To Become Republicans\". The pamphlet clearly represents Sade's philosophy on religion and morality, a philosophy he passionately hopes the citizens of France will embrace and codify into the laws of their new republican government. Continually throughout the work, Sade makes the argument that one must embrace atheism, reject society's beliefs about pleasure and pain, and further makes his argument that if any crime is committed while seeking pleasure, it cannot be condemned.\n\n\nIn the introduction, the Marquis de Sade exhorts his readers to indulge in the various activities in the play. He says that the work is dedicated to \"voluptuaries of all ages, of every sex\" and urges readers to emulate the characters. \"Lewd women\", he writes, \"let the voluptuous Saint-Ange be your model; after her example, be heedless of all that contradicts pleasure's divine laws, by which all her life she was enchained.\" He then urges \"young maidens\" to copy Eugénie; \"be as quick as she to destroy, to spurn all those ridiculous precepts inculcated in you by imbecile parents\". Finally, he urges male readers to \"study the cynical Dolmancé\" and follow his example of selfishness and consideration for nothing but his own enjoyment.\n\nDolmancé is the most dominant of the characters in the dialogue. He explains to Eugénie that morality, compassion, religion, and modesty are all absurd notions that stand in the way of the sole aim of human existence: pleasure. Like most of Sade's work, \"Philosophy in the Boudoir\" features a great deal of sex as well as libertine philosophies. Although there is some torture, the dialogue contains no actual murder, unlike many of Sade's works.\n\nDolmancé and Madame de Saint-Ange start off by giving Eugénie their own brand of sex education, explaining the biological facts and declaring that physical pleasure is a far more important motive for sex than that of reproduction. Both characters explain that she will not be able to feel \"true pleasure\" without pain. Then they eagerly get down to the practical lessons, with Le Chevalier joining them in the fourth act and swiftly helping to take away Eugénie's virginity.\n\nEugénie is instructed on the pleasures of various sexual practices and she proves to be a fast learner. As is usually the case in Sade's work, the characters are all bisexual, and sodomy is the preferred activity of all concerned, especially Dolmancé, who prefers male sexual partners and will not have anything other than anal intercourse with females. Madame de Saint-Ange and her younger brother, the \"Chevalier\", also have sex with one another, and boast of doing so on a regular basis. Their incest — and all manner of other sexual activity and taboos, such as sodomy, adultery and homosexuality — is justified by Dolmancé in a series of energetic arguments that ultimately boil down to \"if it feels good, do it\". The Marquis de Sade believed this was his ultimate argument: if a crime (even murder) took place during one's desire for pleasure, then it could not be punished by law. He was backed in this thought through his belief that Hobbes was wrong about mankind, that mankind is neither good or evil, it is his will that is ultimately evil. (Sodomy was illegal and punishable by death in France at the time the dialogue was written, and Sade himself was convicted of sodomy in 1772.)\n\nThe corruption of Eugénie is actually at the request of her father, who has sent her to Madame de Saint-Ange for the very purpose of having his daughter stripped of the morality her virtuous mother taught her.\n\nThe dialogue is split into seven parts, or \"dialogues\", and was originally illustrated by Sade himself. There is a lengthy section within the fifth dialogue titled \"Yet Another Effort, Frenchmen, If You Would Become Republicans\", in which the Marquis de Sade argued that, having done away with the monarchy in the French Revolution, the people of France should take the final step towards liberty by abolishing religion too. \"Frenchmen, I repeat it to you: Europe awaits her deliverance from \"specter\" and \"censer\" alike. Know well that you cannot possibly liberate her from royal tyranny without at the same time breaking for her the fetters of religious superstition; the shackles of the one are too intimately linked to those of the other; let one of the two survive, and you cannot avoid falling subject to the other you have left intact. It is no longer before the knees of either an imaginary being or a vile impostor a republican must prostrate himself; his only gods must now be \"courage\" and \"liberty\". Rome disappeared immediately Christianity was preached there, and France is doomed if she continues to revere it\".\n\nIn the final act, Eugénie's mother, Madame de Mistival, arrives to rescue her daughter from the \"monsters\" who have corrupted her. Eugénie's father, however, warns his daughter and friends in advance and urges them to punish his wife, whose person and virtue he clearly loathes. Madame de Mistival is horrified to find that not only did her husband arrange for their daughter's corruption, but Eugénie has already lost any moral standards she previously possessed, along with any respect or obedience towards her mother. Eugénie refuses to leave and Madame de Mistival is soon stripped, beaten, whipped and raped, her daughter taking an active part in this brutality and even declaring her wish to kill her mother. Dolmancé eventually calls in for a servant who has syphilis to rape Eugénie's mother. Eugénie sews up her vagina and Dolmancé her anus to keep the polluted seed inside and she is then sent home in tears, knowing her daughter has been lost to the corrupt, libertine mentality of Dolmancé and his accomplices.\n\nSpanish director Jesús Franco has made two films based on \"Philosophy in the Boudoir\": \"\" (1970), a.k.a. \"De Sade '70\" and \"Eugenie (Historia de una perversión)\" (1980). Italian director Aurelio Grimaldi also filmed it, as \"L'educazione sentimentale di Eugenie\" (2005). In 2003, a play based on \"Philosophy in the Bedroom\" titled \"XXX\" was staged in a number of European cities. It featured live simulated sex and audience interaction that caused some controversy.\n\n\n"}

As the Riots in Bombay continued, the Parsis became frustrated with their leaders, and Dadabhai Naoroji started the paper with the purpose of voicing the grievances of the poor and middle class of his people. Postal rates tended to limit their circulation to local or nearby areas, but sometimes enthusiasm for a cause led the managers of a paper to distribute several copies of each issue free. Thus, the founders of the paper lost some 10,000 rupees by distributing the first issues of the \"Rast Goftar\" free, impatient at the state of Parsi society, obviously in a hurry to reform it.\n\nIn 1857 the proprietors of \"Rast Goftar\" in Bombay converted their property into a joint-stock concern so that Nasarvanji Cama, who had financed the paper from the beginning, would not be the sole loss-bearer. K. R. Cama, Sorabji Shapoorji Bengalee, and Nowroji Fardonji all became proprietors. The local governments subsidized several vernacular journals in northern India, though only a few in Bengal and Bombay.

Hunting and logging are usually strictly prohibited within these patches. Other forms of forest usage like honey collection and deadwood collection are sometimes allowed on a sustainable basis. Sacred groves did not enjoy protection via federal legislation in India. Some NGOs work with local villagers to protect such groves. Traditionally, and in some cases even today, members of the community take turns to protect the grove. However, the introduction of the protected area category community reserves under the Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Act, 2002 has introduced legislation for providing government protection to community held lands, which could include sacred groves.\n\nIndian sacred groves are often associated with temples, monasteries, shrines or with burial grounds. Historically, sacred groves find their mentions in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist texts, from sacred tree groves in Hinduism to sacred deer parks in Buddhism for example. Sacred groves may be loosely used to refer to natural habitat protected on religious grounds. Other historical references to sacred groves can be obtained in \"Vrukshayurveda\" an ancient treatise, ancient classics such as as Kalidasa's Vikramuurvashiiya. There has been a growing interest in creating green patches such as \"Nakshatravana\" grove.\n\nThe Hindu tradition considers forests to be of three types - \"Tapovan\", \"Mahavan\" and \"Sreevan\". \"Tapovan\" are forests associated with penance (\"Tapas\"), and are inhabited by saints and \"rishis\". \"Mahavan\" refers to the grand natural forests. \"Tapovan\" and \"Mahavan\" are considered to be a \"Raksha\" (\"sanctuary\") for flora and fauna as ordinary human beings are not allowed to enter these forests. \"Sreevan\", which means, \"forests of prosperity\", consists of dense forests and groves. From the former, people would collect dry wood, leaves, forest produce and a limited amount of timber, though natural ecosystem would not be unnecessarily disturbed. Groves were considered as spaces of forests from where harvesting could be done. Sometimes, specific trees like mango trees could be planted and nurtured here. Groves were associated with religious rites, festivals and recreation. Typical recreational activities associated with these groves included \"jhoola\"/ \"jhoolan\". In the villages, \"Panchavati\", or a cluster of five trees that represented the forests, were maintained. These trees represented the five elements of Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Space.\n\nPlanting and nurturing of trees has been a highly evolved practice in ancient India. \"Vrukshayurveda\", the science of plant life and also a 10th-century treatise of that title on the subject ascribed to Surapala, dealt with various species of trees and their growth. Verses 9-23 from this text indicate how mystical beliefs and conservation of ecology was inter-connected.\n\nTypically, sacred groves are associated with the concept of a \"presiding deity\". Often these sacred deities are numerous nature spirits and guardians associated with Hindu, Jain and Buddhist deities, such as nature spirits known as Yakshas (numerous nature spirits), Nāgas (serpent guardians) and guardian tutelary deities (like \"ayyanar\" and \"amman\") are also known. There are over 1000 deities associated with sacred groves in the states of Kerala and Karnataka alone. In Kodagu district in Karnataka from time immemorial the martial community of Kodavas had maintained over a 1000 \"Devakadu\" dedicated to Aiyappa the forest god.\n\nTraditional uses: One of the most important traditional uses of sacred groves was that it acted as a repository for various Ayurvedic medicines. Other uses involved a source of replenishable resources like fruits and honey. However, in most sacred groves it was taboo to hunt or chop wood. The vegetation cover helps reduce soil erosion and prevents desertification, as in Rajasthan. The groves are often associated with ponds and streams, and meet water requirements of local communities. They sometimes help in recharging aquifers as well.\n\nModern uses: In modern times, sacred groves have become biodiversity hotspots, as various species seek refuge in the areas due to progressive habitat destruction, and hunting. Sacred groves often contain plant and animal species that have become extinct in neighboring areas. They therefore harbor great genetic diversity. Besides this, sacred groves in urban landscapes act as \"lungs\" to the city as well, providing much needed vegetation cover.\n\nSacred groves are scattered all over the country, and are referred to by different names in different parts of India. Sacred groves occur in a variety of places – from scrub forests in the Thar Desert of Rajasthan maintained by the Bishnois, to rain forests in the Western Ghats of Kerala. Himachal Pradesh in the north and Kerala in the south are specifically known for their large numbers of sacred groves. The Kodavas of Karnataka alone maintained over 1000 sacred groves in their region. The Gurjar people of Rajasthan have a unique practice of neem (Azadirachta indica) planting and worshipping as abode of God Devnarayan.Thus, a Gurjjar settlement appears like a human-inhabited sacred grove. Similarly Mangar Bani, last surviving natural forest of Delhi is protected by Gurjars of nearby area. 14,000 sacred groves have been reported from all over India, which act as reservoirs of rare fauna, and more often rare flora, amid rural and even urban settings. Experts believe that the total number of sacred groves could be as high as 100,000.\n\nIt is estimated that around 1000 km² of unexploited land is inside sacred groves. Some of the more famous groves are the \"kavu\"s of Kerala, which are located in the Western Ghats and have enormous biodiversity; and the \"law kyntang\"s of Meghalaya – sacred groves associated with every village (two large groves being in Mawphlang and Mausmai) to appease the forest spirit.\n\nAmong the largest sacred groves of India are the ones in Hariyali, near Gauchar in Chamoli District of Uttarakhand, and the Deodar grove in Shipin near Simla in Himachal Pradesh. Kodagu, a small region of about 4000 km² in Karnataka, had over 1000 sacred groves.\n\nAll numbers are quoted from the records of the \"C.P.R. Environmental Education Centre\" of the Government of India. Starred numbers are likely to increase. The centre also maintains a complete list of identified sacred groves in India, most of which is online.\n\nA Sarpakkavu or Snake Grove is a kind of holy grove found in Kerala. \n\nKavu is the traditional name given for Sacred groves across the Malabar Coast in Kerala, South India. Kavus are notable for Theyyam, the centuries-old ritual dance.\n\nThreats to the grove include urbanization, over-exploitation of resources (like overgrazing and excessive firewood collection), and environmental destruction due to religious practices. Other threats to the sacred groves include invasion by invasive species, like the invasive weeds \"Chromolaena odorata\", \"Lantana camara\" and \"Prosopis juliflora\".\n\nA large number of distinct local art forms and folk traditions are associated with the deities of sacred groves, and are an important cultural aspect closely associated with sacred traditions. Ritualistic dances and dramatizations based on the local deities that protect the groves are called \"Theyyam\" in Kerala and \"Nagmandalam\", among other names, in Karnataka. Often, elaborate rituals and traditions are associated with sacred groves, as are associated folk tales and folk mythology.\n\n"}

Lewis also known as Murshid Samuel Lewis and Sufi Ahmed Murad Chisti (October 18, 1896 – January 15, 1971) was an American mystic and horticultural scientist who founded what became the Sufi Ruhaniat International, a branch of the Chishtia Sufi lineage. After a lifetime of spiritual study with teachers East and West, primarily Inayat Khan and Nyogen Senzaki, Lewis was recognized simultaneously as a Zen master and Sufi murshid (senior teacher) by Eastern representatives of the two traditions. He also co-founded the Christian mystical order called the Holy Order of Mans. His early interest in international seed exchange and organic agriculture also established him as one of the pioneers of green spirituality. His most enduring legacy may be the creation of the Dances of Universal Peace, an early interspiritual practice that has spread around the world in the 43 years since his passing.\n\nLewis was born to Jewish parents. Lewis' father Jacob Lewis was a vice president of the Levi Strauss jeans manufacturing company. His mother was Harriett Rosenthal, the daughter of Lenore Rothschild of the international banking family. To his parents' dismay Lewis showed a keen interest in religion and spirituality from an early age and later rejected their attempts at as business career for him.\n\nIn 1919 Lewis entered a Sufi community in Fairfax, California where he met Murshida Rabia Martin, a student of the Sufi teacher and musician Inayat Khan. A year later he began Zen study with Nyogen Senzaki, a disciple of the Rinzai Zen Buddhist Abbot Soyen Shaku. The twin spiritual influences of Sufism and Zen were to remain central to him throughout his life.\n\nLewis remained in the Fairfax Sufi community through the early 1920s. In 1923 a vision of Inayat Khan led Lewis into initiation by the Pir-O-Murshid. In 1926 he collaborated with Nyogen Senzaki, a Rinzai Zen Buddhist monk, in opening the first official Zen meditation hall (zendo) in San Francisco.\n\nLewis continued to study Sufism and Zen, as well as yoga, the latter with Swami Ramdas of Anandashram. He also developed an interest in horticulture and promoted seed exchanges internationally. He was also an adherent and promoter of the General Semantics approach to psychology, language and translation begun by Alfred Korzybski.\n\nIn 1956, he visited Japan, India, Pakistan and Egypt, seeking the company of other mystics and teachers. In 1960-62, while visiting Pakistan, he reported that he was publicly recognized as a Murshid by Pir Barkat Ali, founder of Dar ul Ehsan. In 1966, after further Zen study with, among others, Sokei-An Sasaki and Sagaku Shaku, Lewis was ordained a \"Zen-Shi\" (Zen Master) by Korean Zen master Dr. Kyung-Bo Seo.\n\nIn 1967, whilst recovering from a heart attack in a hospital Lewis reported that he heard the voice of God say, \"I make you spiritual leader of the hippies.\"\n\nFor the remainder of his life Lewis traveled around California developing and teaching new forms of walking meditation as well as the Dances of Universal Peace, which draw on all the spiritual traditions he had encountered. Lewis' work in the Dances of Universal Peace was also inspired by his time with American dance pioneer Ruth St. Denis, whom he acknowledged their \"grandmother.\" In 1982, the organization now known as the International Network for the Dances of Universal Peace was founded by Saadi Neil Douglas-Klotz and Tasnim Hermila Fernandez for the purpose of promoting Lewis' vision of the Dances as a form of \"peace through the arts.\" The organization subsequently published many of St Denis' previously unpublished writings on spiritual dance and the mysticism of the body.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Lewis began initiating and training students first under the banner of Zen and then of Sufism. Just before his passing in 1971, Lewis formed an esoteric organization now known as the Sufi Ruhaniat International to help carry on his Sufi initiatic lineage in the Chishti Sufi tradition. Lewis died in January 1971 as a result of a fall one month earlier. Before his passing, he appointed his as his successor his Khalif Moineddin Jablonski, who directed the organization from 1971 until his own passing in 2001. Jablonski was succeeded by Shabda Kahn as Pir of the lineage.\n\nWhen Samuel Lewis died, he asked that his body be buried at the interspiritual community of Lama Foundation, near Taos, New Mexico. The grave (called a \"maqbara\" in the Sufi tradition) became a pilgrimage site and was rebuilt several times in the intervening years. In August 2017, work was completed on a new building, called a \"dargah,\" surrounding the gravesite. It is designed to facilitate visits by pilgrims in the same way that Sufi dargahs in other parts of the world do.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7056938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7056938", "title": "Temple of Aphaea", "text": "Temple of Aphaea\n\nThe Temple of Aphaia () or Afea is located within a sanctuary complex dedicated to the goddess Aphaia on the Greek island of Aigina, which lies in the Saronic Gulf. Formerly known as the Temple of Jupiter Panhellenius, the great Doric temple is now recognized as dedicated to the mother-goddess Aphaia. It was a favorite of the neoclassical and romantic artists such as J. M. W. Turner. It stands on a c. 160 m peak on the eastern side of the island approximately 13 km east by road from the main port.\n\n\"Aphaia\" (Greek ) was a Greek goddess who was worshipped exclusively at this sanctuary. The extant temple of c. 500 BC was built over the remains of an earlier temple of c. 570 BC, which was destroyed by fire c. 510 BC. The elements of this destroyed temple were buried in the infill for the larger, flat terrace of the later temple, and are thus well preserved. Abundant traces of paint remain on many of these buried fragments. There may have been another temple in the 7th century BC, also located on the same site, but it is thought to have been much smaller and simpler in terms of both plan and execution. Significant quantities of Late Bronze Age figurines have been discovered at the site, including proportionally large numbers of female figurines (\"kourotrophoi\"), indicating – perhaps – that cult activity at the site was continuous from the 14th century BC, suggesting a Minoan connection for the cult. The last temple is of an unusual plan and is also significant for its pedimental sculptures, which are thought to illustrate the change from Archaic to Early Classical technique. These sculptures are on display in the Glyptothek of Munich, with a number of fragments located in the museums at Aigina and on the site itself.\n\nThe periegetic writer Pausanias briefly mentions the site in his writings of the 2nd century AD, but does not describe the sanctuary in detail as he does for many others. The temple was made known in Western Europe by the publication of the \"Antiquities of Ionia\" (London, 1797). In 1811, the young English architect Charles Robert Cockerell, finishing his education on his academic Grand Tour, and Baron Otto Magnus von Stackelberg removed the fallen fragmentary pediment sculptures. On the recommendation of Baron Carl Haller von Hallerstein, who was also an architect and, moreover, a protégé of the art patron Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria, the marbles were shipped abroad and sold the following year to the Crown Prince, soon to be King Ludwig I of Bavaria. Minor excavations of the east \"peribolos\" wall were carried out in 1894 during reconstruction of the last temple.\n\nSystematic excavations at the site were carried out in the 20th century by the German School in Athens, at first under the direction of Adolf Furtwängler. The area of the sanctuary was defined and studied during these excavations. The area under the last temple could not be excavated, however, because that would have harmed the temple. In addition, significant remains from the Bronze Age were detected in pockets in the rocky surface of the hill. From 1966 to 1979, an extensive second German excavation under was performed, leading to the discovery in 1969 of substantial remains of the older Archaic temple in the fill of the later terrace walls. Ernst-Ludwig Schwandner and Martha Ohly were also associated with this dig, which continued after the death of Dieter Ohly until 1988. Sufficient remains were recovered to allow a complete architectural reconstruction of the structure to be extrapolated; the remains of the entablature and pediment of one end of the older temple have been reconstructed in the on-site museum.\n\nThe sanctuary of Aphaia was located on the top of a hill c. 160 m in elevation at the northeast point of the island. The last form of the sanctuary covered an area of c. 80 by 80 m; earlier phases were less extensive and less well defined.\n\nIn its earliest phase of use during the Bronze Age, the eastern area of the hilltop was an unwalled, open-air sanctuary to a female fertility and agricultural deity. Bronze Age figurines outnumber remains of pottery. Open vessel forms are also at an unusually high proportion versus closed vessels. There are no known settlements or burials in the vicinity, arguing against the remains being due to either usage. Large numbers of small pottery chariots and thrones and miniature vessels have been found. Although there are scattered remains dating to the Early Bronze Age such as two seal stones, remains in significant quantities begin to be deposited in the Middle Bronze Age, and the sanctuary has its peak use in the LHIIIa2 through LHIIIb periods. It is less easy to trace the cult through the Sub-Mycenean period and into the Geometric where cult activity is once more reasonably certain.\n\nFurtwängler proposes three phases of building at the sanctuary, with the earliest of these demonstrated by an altar at the eastern end dating to c. 700 BC. Also securely known are a cistern at the northeast extremity and a structure identified as a treasury east of the propylon (entrance) of the sanctuary. The temple corresponding to these structures is proposed to be under the later temples and thus not able to be excavated. Furtwängler suggests that this temple is the \"oikos\" (house) referenced in a mid-7th-century BC inscription from the site as having been built by a priest for Aphaia; he hypothesizes that this house of the goddess (temple) was built of stone socles topped with mud brick upper walls and wooden entablature. The top of the hill was slightly modified to make it more level by wedging stones into the crevices of the rock.\n\nOhly detected a (stone socle and mudbrick upper level) \"peribolos\" wall enclosing an area of c. 40 by 45 m dating to this phase. This \"peribolos\" was not aligned to the axis of the temple. A raised and paved platform was built to connect the temple to the altar. There was a \"propylon\" (formal entrance gate) with a wooden superstructure in the southeast side of the \"peribolos\". A 14 m tall column topped by a sphinx was at the northeast side of the sanctuary. The full study and reconstruction of the temple was done by Schwandner, who dates it to before 570 BC. In his reconstruction, the temple is prostyle-tetrastyle in plan, and has a pronaos and – significantly – an adyton at the back of the cella. As is the case at the temples of Artemis at Brauron and Aulis (among others), many temples of Artemis have such back rooms, which may indicate a similarity of cult practice. The cella of the temple of Aphaia had the unusual feature of having two rows of two columns supporting another level of columns that reached the roof. The architrave of this temple was constructed in two courses, giving it a height of 1.19 m versus the frieze height of 0.815 m; this proportion is unusual among temples of the region, but is known from temples in Sicily. A triglyph and metope frieze is also placed along the inside of the pronaos. These metopes were apparently undecorated with sculpture, and there is no evidence of pedimental sculptural groups. This temple and much of the sanctuary was destroyed by fire around 510 BC.\n\nConstruction of a new temple commenced soon after the destruction of the older temple. The remains of the destroyed temple were removed from the site of the new temple and used to fill a c. 40 by 80 m terrace within the overall sanctuary of c. 80 by 80 m. This new temple terrace was aligned on north, west, and south with the plan of the new temple. The temple was a hexastyle peripteral Doric order structure on a 6 by 12 column plan resting on a 15.5 by 30.5 m platform; it had a distyle in antis cella with an opisthodomos and a pronaos. All but three of the outer columns were monolithic. There was a small, off-axis doorway between the cella and the opisthodomos. In similar design but more monumental execution than the earlier temple, the cella of the new temple had two rows of five columns, supporting another level of columns that reached to roof. The corners of the roof were decorated with sphinx \"acroteria\", and the central, vegetal \"acroterion\" of each side had a pair of \"kore\" statues standing one on either side, an unusual feature. The antefixes were of marble, as were the roof tiles.\nDates ranging from 510 to 470 BC have been proposed for this temple. Bankel, who published the complete study of the remains, compares the design features of the structure with three structures that were near contemporaries:\n\n\nBankel says the temple of Aphaia is more developed than the earlier phase of this structure, giving it a date of around 500 BC. The metopes of this temple, which were not found, were slotted into the triglyph blocks and attached to backer blocks with swallowtail clamps. If they were wooden, their lack of preservation is to be expected. If they were stone, then they may have been removed for the ancient antiquities market while the structure was still standing. The altar was redone for this phase as well.\n\nIf still in use by the 4th-century, the temple would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire.\n\nThe marbles from the Late Archaic temple of \"Aphaia\", comprising the sculptural groups of the east and west pediments of the temple, are on display in the Glyptothek of Munich, where they were restored by the Danish neoclassic sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. These works exerted a formative influence on the local character of Neoclassicism in Munich, as exhibited in the architecture of Leo von Klenze. Each pediment centered on the figure of Athena, with groups of combatants, fallen warriors, and arms filling the decreasing angles of the pediments. The theme shared by the pediments was the greatness of \"Aigina\" as shown by the exploits of its local heroes in the two Trojan wars, one led by Heracles against Laomedon and a second led by Agamemnon against Priam. According to the standard myths, Zeus raped the nymph \"Aigina\", who bore the first king of the island, Aiakos. This king had the sons Telamon (father of the Homeric hero Ajax) and Peleus (father of the Homeric hero Achilles). The Greek idolize heroes who fallen at war, to die on the battleground was a great honor it depicted courage and strength. When a hero died it was though that they become immortal because they prove themselves to the Gods. The sculptures preserve extensive traces of a complex paint scheme, and are crucial for the study of painting on ancient sculpture. The marbles are finished even on the back surfaces of the figures, despite the fact that these faced the pediment and were thus not visible.\nOhly had contended that there were four total pedimental groups (two complete sets of pediments for the east and west sides of the temple); Bankel uses the architectural remains of the temple to argue that there were only three pedimental groups; later in his life, Ohly came to believe that there were only two, which was shown persuasively by Eschbach. There were shallow cuttings and many dowels used to secure the plinths of the sculptures of the west pediment (the back of the temple). The east pediment used deep cuttings and fewer dowels to secure the plinths of the statues. There were also a number of \"geison\" blocks that had shallow cuttings and many dowels like the west pediment, but that did not fit there. Bankel argues that sculptures were set on both the east and the west pediments with these shallow cuttings, but that the sculptures of the east pediment were removed (along with the \"geison\" blocks cut to receive them) and replaced with a different sculptural group. This replacement appears to have been carried out before the raking \"geisa\" were installed on the east pediment, since the corner geisa were not cut down to join to the raking \"geisa\": i.e. the 1st phase of the east pediment was replaced with the 2nd phase before that end of the temple was completed. As the eastern facade of the temple (the front) was the most important visually, it is not surprising that the builders would choose to focus additional efforts on it.\n\nThe first Trojan war, not the one described by Homer but the war of Heracles against the king of Troy Laomedon is the theme, with Telamon figuring prominently as he fights alongside Heracles against king Laomedon. This pediment is thought to be later than the west pediment and to show a number of features appropriate to the Classical period: the statues show a dynamic posture especially in the case of Athena, chiastic composition, and intricate filling of the space using the legs of fallen combatants to fill the difficult decreasing angles of the pediment. Part of the eastern pediment was destroyed during the Persian Wars, possibly by a thunderbolt. The statues that survived were set up in the sanctuary enclosure, and those that were destroyed, were buried according to the ancient custom. The old composition was replaced by a new one with a scene of a battle, again with Athena at the center.\n\nThe second Trojan war – the one described by Homer – is the theme, with Ajax (son of Telamon) figuring prominently. The style of these sculptures is that of the Archaic period. The composition deals with the decreasing angles of the pediment by filling the space using a shield and a helmet.\n\n\n\n"}

Its original name was The Order of the Fifteen, but it was later changed to The Order of Christian Mystics. Their intent was to combine Theosophy with traditional Christian doctrine. Their teachings were transmitted through Harriette by the Founder of the Theosophical Society, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, otherwise simply referred to as The Teacher of the Order.\n\nThe teachings of the order were promulgated mainly through a system of correspondence, extensive publishing of books and delivering of lectures at many centres. Their pupils numbered many thousands in over 70 countries. Mainly their works were aimed at the American esoteric fraternity, for it was believed that America would remain the spiritually dominant nation regarding Western mysticism for many years to come.\n\nThe spiritual philosophy as espoused by this Order was based on a system of personal regeneration, otherwise called spiritual alchemy, by transmuting the base creative energy, through Divine purity, prayer, devotion, study and meditation. This was put forth in the Western mystical tradition, a system of mysticism suitable for the Western culture and mindset, encompassing a new interpretation on all former teachings given under the names of Rosicrucianism, Gnosticism and the Western mystery school teachings.\n\nThe published works of their Teacher, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, was mainly aimed at making available to the Western world the ancient Teachings of the East. This new effort had as its aim the promulgation of Christian mysticism based on the life and teachings of the Master Jesus and a mystical interpretation of the Bible, especially the works of the New Testament.\n\nTogether through Hierarchy, Teacher, Order and inner circle they published 27 bound volumes of mystical teachings running over many editions, answered thousands of letters, delivered thousands of lectures, demonstrations and services across the USA over a 40-year period. It has only been in recent years (2009) that the combined works of the Order have once more seen the light of day and have been made available to all in the public domain.\n\nHarriette Augusta Curtiss, co-founder of The Order of Christian Mystics and later the Universal Religious Foundation, was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1856. Her parents were John Horace Brown, organizer of the Pennsylvania State Teachers' Association and Emma Brightly Brown. Curtiss received a cultured education and developed into a talented musician and actress. After starring in a number of amateur theatrical productions she had the opportunity to become a professional, but her mother dissuaded her from doing so. She therefore put her writing talents to use for many years, authoring a column for the Philadelphia Inquirer under the pen name \"The Bachelor Girl.\" As the years passed, Curtiss found herself to be a gifted clairvoyant, developing a direct contact with that ascended teacher known as Madame Blavatsky and eventually launched a career in the realm of mysticism. \n\nIn 1907 she married Dr Frank Homer Curtiss, and together they began working as occult teachers and writers. In the year of their marriage they founded The Order of the 15, which in 1908 became known as The Order of Christian Mystics. Harriette, who became known within the order as Rahmea, assumed the role of teacher, and her husband took the position of secretary (and was known by his order name of Pyrahmos). They worked together to prepare material for publication, though Harriette was the primary author. Throughout the rest of her life, she issued monthly lessons for students. \n\nThe Curtisses produced more than 27 books and publications. The first was compiled from Harriette's written responses to questions from students and was titled Letters from the Teacher (1909). Her early lessons were combined in The Voice of Isis (1912), which became the order's basic introductory text. Later a more advanced text was published under the title The Message of Aquaria (1921). The Curtisses wrote several books during World War I, including The War Crisis (1914) or The Philosophy of War, being a philosophical treatise on the mystical causes of war, and The Key to the Universe (1915). In the latter volume they contended that all personal experiences are expressions of one great law based on mathematical principles and that the \"unfoldment of the godlike possibilities inherent in each Soul follows, step by step, the same order of events that is followed in the evolution of the Cosmos, and that such steps are symbolized by the first 22 numbers\". Realms of the Living Dead: A Brief Description of Life after Death appeared in 1917. In 1919 they published a sequel to The Key to the Universe titled The Key of Destiny. Many more books followed in later years. \n\nDuring the war the Curtisses founded the Church of the Wisdom Religion, a less exclusive group than their earlier order. In 1929 after the Curtisses moved to Washington, D.C., the church was incorporated as the Universal Religious Foundation. \n\nAfter suffering from a long mystical illness towards the end of her life, Harriette Augusta Curtiss entered transition on the 22nd of September 1932 in Washington, D.C., and followed her Teacher, Madame Blavatsky, into the Higher Realms. She had reached the age of 76.\nDr. Frank Homer Curtiss maintained a successful healing practice until his passing in 1946 and implemented a constructive and truly holistic healing practice, side by side with the highest mystical Teachings of the Order. This encompassed specialized dieting, in vogue to this day and radionics, then still in its infancy. Frank Homer Curtiss, many years younger than Harriette, re-married in 1937 to Eleanor Chapman Stevens who helped him to continue his work until his passing. She became the sole heir and executor of his estate and it is assumed the keeper of the archives of the Order at Homers passing. Homer entered transition in 1946 at the age of 71. \n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18888280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18888280", "title": "Transgender people and religion", "text": "Transgender people and religion\n\nThe relationship between transgender people and religion varies widely around the world. Religions range from condemning any gender variance to honoring transgender people as religious leaders. Views within a single religion can vary considerably.\n\nAbrahamic religions have creation stories in which God creates people, \"male and female\". This is sometimes interpreted as a divine mandate against gender variance. The Torah contains specific prohibitions on cross-dressing and damaged genitals.\n\nThe term \"saris\", generally translated to English as \"eunuch\" or \"chamberlain\", appears 45 times in the Tanakh. It frequently refers to a trusted but gender variant person who was delegated authority by a powerful person. It is unclear whether most were in fact castrated. In Isaiah 56 God promises eunuchs who keep the Sabbath and hold fast to his covenant that he will build an especially good monument in heaven for them, to make up for their childlessness.\n\nTumtum (טומטום in Hebrew, meaning \"hidden\") is a term that appears in Jewish Rabbinic literature and usually refers to a person whose sex is unknown, because their genitalia are covered or \"hidden\". A tumtum is not defined as a separate gender, but rather a state of doubt.\n\nAndrogynos (אנדרוגינוס in Hebrew, translation \"intersex\") refers to someone who possesses both male and female sexual characteristics. The nature of the individual's gender is ambiguous.\n\nOrthodox Judaism asserts that sex/gender is an innate and eternal category based on verses in the Book of Genesis about Adam and Eve and the creation of maleness and femaleness. Sex-change operations involving the removal of genital organs are forbidden on the basis of the prohibition against “anything which is mauled, crushed, torn or cut” (Lev. 22:24). A further prohibition in Deut. 22:5, proscribes not only cross-dressing but any action uniquely identified with the opposite sex, and this would also apply to an operation to transform sexual characteristics. There are, nevertheless, Orthodox authorities who recognize the efficacy of sex reassignment surgery (SRS) in changing halachic sex designation. In 2007 Joy Ladin became the first openly transgender professor at an Orthodox institution (Stern College for Women in Manhattan).\n\nHasidic Judaism as of now, has no place for trans people as everything in the community is determined by gender roles. Most Hasidic Jews are barely aware of trans people, and the topic is never discussed altogether. The first person to come out as trans in a Hasidic community was trans activist and writer Abby Stein, who is also a direct descendant of Hasidic Judaism's founder the Baal Shem Tov. When Stein came out she was shunned by her family, and received much scorn from the Hasidic community.\n\nConservative Judaism has mixed views on transgender people. In 2003 the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards approved a rabbinic ruling that concluded that sex reassignment surgery (SRS) is permissible as a treatment of gender dysphoria, and that a transgender person's sex status under Jewish law is changed by SRS. There have not yet been any openly transgender rabbis or rabbinical students affiliated with Conservative Judaism. But the Jewish Theological Seminary, one of three Conservative movement schools, openly admits students of all sexual orientations and gender identities for rabbinical training and ordination. Also, Emily Aviva Kapor, who had been ordained privately by a \"Conservadox\" rabbi in 2005, began living as a woman in 2012, thus becoming the first openly transgender female rabbi in all of Judaism. In 2016 the Rabbinical Assembly, which is the international association of Conservative rabbis, passed a \"Resolution Affirming the Rights of Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming People\".\n\nReform Judaism has expressed positive views on transgender people. Reform Judaism's Central Conference of American Rabbis first addressed the issue of transgender Jews in 1978, when they deemed it permissible for a person who has undergone sex reassignment surgery (SRS) to be married according to Jewish tradition. In 1990, the Central Conference of American Rabbis declared that people who have undergone sex reassignment surgery (SRS) may convert to Judaism. In 2002 at the Reform seminary Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in New York, Rabbi Margaret Wenig organized the first school-wide seminar at any rabbinical school which addressed the psychological, legal, and religious issues affecting people who are transsexual or intersex. In 2003 Reuben Zellman became the first openly transgender person accepted to Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion; he was ordained there in 2010. Also in 2003, the Union for Reform Judaism retroactively applied its pro-rights policy on gays and lesbians to the transgender and bisexual communities, issuing a resolution titled, \"Support for the Inclusion and Acceptance of the Transgender and Bisexual Communities.\" Also in 2003, Women of Reform Judaism issued a statement describing their support for human and civil rights and the struggles of the transgender and bisexual communities, and saying, \"Women of Reform Judaism accordingly: Calls for civil rights protections from all forms of discrimination against bisexual and transgender individuals; Urges that such legislation allows transgender individuals to be seen under the law as the gender by which they identify; and\nCalls upon sisterhoods to hold informative programs about the transgender and bisexual communities.\" In 2006 Elliot Kukla, who had come out as transgender six months before his ordination, became the first openly transgender person to be ordained by the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. In 2007 the Union for Reform Judaism issued a new edition of \"Kulanu\", their resource manual for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender inclusion, which for the first time included a blessing sanctifying the sex-change process. It was written by Elliot Kukla at the request of a friend of his who was transgender. Also in 2007, David Saperstein of the Religious Action Center called for a trans-inclusive Employment Non-Discrimination Act. In 2015 the Union for Reform Judaism passed a \"Resolution on the Rights of Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming People\" with 9 points calling for securing and defending the rights of transgender and gender non-confirming people to respectful and equitable treatment and affirming its own commitment to continued pursuit of same.\n\nReconstructionist Judaism has expressed positive views on transgender people. In 2003 the Reform rabbi Margaret Wenig organized the first school-wide seminar at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College which addressed the psychological, legal and religious issues affecting people who are transsexual or intersex. In 2013 the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association issued a resolution stating in part, \"Therefore be it resolved that the RRA [Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association] directs its executive director and board to move forward, in cooperation with the RRC [Reconstructionist Rabbinical College] and all relevant associated entities, in educating RRA members about issues of gender identity, to urge the Reconstructionist movement to similarly educate its constituency and to adopt policies that will do all that is possible to provide full employment opportunities for transgender and gender nonconforming rabbis, and to explore how the Reconstructionist movement can best influence the wider Jewish and non-Jewish world to [be] welcoming and inclusive of all people, regardless of gender identity.\" In 2017, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association approved a resolution committing themselves to work for \"full inclusion, acceptance, appreciation, celebration and welcome of people of all gender identities in Jewish life and in society at large\"; the resolution also \"strongly advocates for the full equality of transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming people and for equal protections for people of all gender identities under the law, at all levels of government, in North America and Israel.\"\n\nIn 1998, after she won the Eurovision song competition, a serious religious debate was held as to whether, and how, Dana International (a transgender woman) should pray in a synagogue. One rabbinical authority concluded that Dana should be counted in a minyan as a man, but could not sing in front of the community since she was also a woman, according to the rabbi, and that would violate the Orthodox rule of kol isha.\n\nIn January 2015 a transgender Jewish woman, Kay Long, was denied access to the Western Wall, first by the women's section and then by the men's section. Long's presence was prevented by \"modesty police\" at women’s section who are not associated with the rabbi of the Western Wall or the site administration. They are a group of female volunteers who guard the entrance to the women’s section preventing entry to visitors who are not dressed to their idea of Orthodox modesty standards for women. The director of Jerusalem’s Open House, a community center for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, noted that Long’s experience was not unique. \"Gender separation at the Western Wall is harmful for transgender people. This is not the first story that we know of with transgender religious people that wanted to go to the Western Wall and pray and couldn’t,\" said Elinor Sidi, who expected that the battle for access to the Western Wall for the LGBTQ community would be a long and difficult one. It was later asserted that Kay Long would have been permitted in the women's section except for her clothing. \"It was not an issue of her gender, but the way she was dressed.\"\n\nSeveral non-denominational Jewish groups provide resources for transgender people. published an LGBTQ Resource Guide in 2007. Jewish Mosaic has published interpretations of Jewish texts that affirm transgender identities. Keshet, an LGBT Jewish advocacy group, has assisted American Jewish day schools with properly accommodating transgender students.\n\nThe New Testament presents eunuchs (Greek \"eunochos\", similar to Hebrew \"saris\") as acceptable candidates for evangelism and baptism, as demonstrated in the account of the conversion of an Ethiopian eunuch. While answering questions about marriage and divorce, Jesus says that \"there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.\" Discussion has occurred about the significance of the selection of the Ethiopian eunuch as being an early gentile convert to Christianity: the inclusion of a eunuch, representing a sexual minority, in the context of the time.\n\nSome Christian denominations accept transgender people as members and clergy:\n\nIn contrast, a 2000 document from the Catholic Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith concludes that the sex-change procedures do not change a person's gender in the eyes of the Church. \"The key point\", that document states, \"is that the transsexual surgical operation is so superficial and external that it does not change the personality. If the person was a male, he remains male. If she was female, she remains female.\" The document also concludes that a \"sex-change\" operation could be morally acceptable in certain extreme cases, but that in any case transgender people cannot validly marry. Pope Benedict XVI denounced gender studies, warning that it blurs the distinction between male and female and could thus lead to the \"self-destruction\" of the human race. He warned against the manipulation that takes place in national and international forums when the term \"gender\" is altered. \"What is often expressed and understood by the term 'gender,' is definitively resolved in the self-emancipation of the human being from creation and the Creator\", he warned. \"Man wants to create himself, and to decide always and exclusively on his own about what concerns him.\" The Pontiff said this is humanity living \"against truth, against the creating Spirit\". As well, in 2015, the Vatican declared that transgender Catholics cannot become godparents, stating in response to a transgender man's query that transgender status \"reveals in a public way an attitude opposite to the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the truth of one's own sexuality\" and that, \"[t]herefore it is evident that this person does not possess the requirement of leading a life according to the faith and in the position of godfather and is therefore unable to be admitted to the position of godfather or godmother.\" Catholics, nevertheless, have held a range of positions regarding transgender issues. Theologian James Whitehead, for instance, has said, “The kind of transition that trans people are talking about is very similar to the journey of faith through darkness and desert that people have been making for thousands of years.” The Roman Catholic Church has been involved in the outreach to LBGT community for several years and continues doing so through Franciscan urban outreach centers, namely, the \"Open Hearts\" outreach in Hartford, CT.\n\nIn 2006 Albert Mohler, then president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, said \"Only God has the right to determine gender\", adding, \"any attempt to alter that creation is an act of rebellion against God.\" He also stated, \"Christians are obligated to find our definitions … in the Bible. What the activists want to call 'sex-reassignment surgery' must be seen as a form of bodily mutilation rather than gender correction. The chromosomes will continue to tell the story...Gender is not under our control after all. When a nation's moral rebellion comes down to this level of confusion, we are already in big trouble. A society that can't distinguish between men and women is not likely to find moral clarity in any other area of life.\" In 2014, the Southern Baptist Convention approved a resolution at its annual meeting stating that \"God's design was the creation of two distinct and complementary sexes, male and female\" and that \"gender identity is determined by biological sex, not by one's self-perception\". Furthermore, the resolution opposes hormone therapy, transition-related care, and anything else that would \"alter one's bodily identity\", as well as opposing government efforts to \"validate transgender identity as morally praiseworthy\". Instead, the resolution asks transgender people to \"trust in Christ and to experience renewal in the Gospel\".\n\nUnitarian Universalism, a liberal religion with roots in liberal Christianity, became the first denomination to accept openly transgender people as full members with eligibility to become clergy (in 1979), and the first to open an Office of Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Concerns (in 1973). In 1988 the first openly transgender person was ordained by the Unitarian Universalist Association. In 2002 Rev. Sean Dennison became the first openly transgender person in the Unitarian Universalist ministry called to serve a congregation; he was called to South Valley UU Society, Salt Lake City, UT.\n\nIn Islamic literature, the word \"mukhannathun\" is used to describe \"effeminate men\". The term has sometimes been equated to transgender women, gay men, members of a third gender, or intersex individuals, though it does not neatly fit into any of those categories.\n\nThe treatment of \"mukhannathun\" varied throughout early Islamic history, and the meaning of the term took on new dimensions over time. In some eras, men deemed \"mukhannathun\" were persecuted and castrated, while in others they were celebrated as musicians and entertainers. In later years, the term came to be associated with the receptive partner in gay sexual practices, as homosexuality was seen as an extension of effeminacy. In the late medieval era, several Islamic scholars held that \"mukhannathun\" who had innate feminine mannerisms were not blameworthy as long as they did not violate religious laws concerning sexual morality.\n\nDue to Ayatollah Khomeini issuing a fatwa allowing sex reassignment surgery for intersex and transgender individuals, Iran carries out more sex change operations than any other nation in the world except for Thailand. It is sanctioned as a supposed \"cure\" for homosexuality, which is punishable by death under Iranian law. The government even provides up to half the cost for those needing financial assistance and a sex change is recognised on the birth certificate.\n\nIn the Baha'i Faith, transgender people can gain recognition in their gender if they have medically transitioned under the direction of medical professionals, and if they have sex reassignment surgery (SRS). After SRS, they are considered transitioned, they may have a Baha'i marriage.\n\nHindu philosophy has the concept of a third sex or third gender (\"tritiya-prakriti\" – literally, \"third nature\"). The people in this category of sex/gender are called Hijras in Hinduism. This category includes a wide range of people with mixed male and female natures such as homosexuals, transsexuals, bisexuals, the intersexed, and so on. Such persons were not considered fully male or female in traditional Hinduism, being a combination of both. They are mentioned as third sex by nature (birth) and were not expected to behave like ordinary men and women. Hijras identify themselves as incomplete men, that they do not have the desires (for women) that other men do. This lack of desire they attribute to a \"defective organ.\" If a Hijra is not born with a \"defective\" organ (and most are not), he must make it so by emasculation. They often kept their own societies or town quarters, performed specific occupations (such as masseurs, hairdressers, flower-sellers, domestic servants, etc.) and were generally attributed a semi-divine status. Their participation in religious ceremonies, especially as crossdressing dancers and devotees of certain temple gods/goddesses, is considered auspicious in traditional Hinduism. Some Hindus believe that third-sex people have special powers allowing them to bless or curse others. However, these beliefs are not upheld in all divisions of Hinduism. In Hinduism, the universal creation is honored as unlimitedly diverse and the recognition of a third sex is simply one more aspect of this understanding.\n\nWithin the Hindu context, Hijras have always been considered a part of the third gender diaspora, and hence the term Hijra, Transgender, Third gender will be used interchangeably.\n\nDue to their classification as third gender and being sexually neutral, Transgender people, especially the devotees of Lord Krishna, have been historically shown to bestow blessings. And, being sexually neutral was considered especially auspicious in Vedic culture because, the attraction between a man and woman was thought to create further attachments such as children due to procreation, and a home in terms of property, which would result in the living entities being entangled in \"samsara\", the cycle of repeated birth and death.\n\nThe people of the third sex have had a prominent role in the arts and entertainment.Historically referred to as Nartaka At the birth of a baby, N\"artaka\" dancers would arrive, and dance and sing the name of the God Krishna, and bless the baby. As per custom, they were given precious jewellery and silks by the family of the baby for their contribution.\n\nOne more example of Transgender people being portrayed in Hindu history is that of Lord Arjuna being depicted as Brihannala in the Mahabharata, who was a person of third gender. Brihanalla was shown to be an instructor singing and dancing in King Virata’s court. But, Lord Arjuna/ Brihanalla was first tested for his third-sex nature by assuring he had no lust for females, and would have been examined for testicles if he had been a eunuch. This is not the first example of the presence of a person of third gender in Hindu texts, but this example most pertains to the topic of third gender people and their auspiciousness.\n\nIn October 2013, \"India's Supreme court stated that transgenders have remained untouchable in society with restricted access to education, health care and jobs. The justices criticized the government for such discrimination during a hearing of public interest litigation filed by the National Legal Services Authority\". This problem for Hijras first began during the British rule (1757-1947) with the introduction of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code in 1860 which declared homosexuality as a crime, and had an extended listing which has declared \"Transgenders as criminal elements in society\" \n\nTransgender people have been treated as outcasts within Indian society and thus have been \"deprived of social and cultural participation for nearly two centuries.\" Many biologically male Hijras undergo a ritualized castration called nirva (sex reassignments). They have limited access to education, health care and public facilities and are treated as nonentities legally, which is in violation of the Constitution of India. Despite being recognized as legal citizens, only an estimated 25% of transgender people have obtained the national identification (Aadhar card). Transgender people are unable to \"exercise their democratic rights in marriage, adopting/raising children and utilizing financial support system such as free and subsidized health care, surgeries and medical treatments\" \n\nThere has been some support for transgender people as \"The Supreme Court has directed the central government to place transgendered people in the other backward classes (OBCs) to classify their castes denoting their socially and economically disadvantaged status in society\" as they fall within the classification of people as defined in Article 15 (4) of the Constitution of India. The Supreme Court of India has directed all Indian states to build separate restrooms for transgender people, and \"to establish welfare agencies to enhance their health and medical needs.\" \n\nMost Buddhist scripture does not distinguish same-sex sexual activity from heterosexual activity, both being seen as non-conducive to spiritual growth.\n\nIn Thai Buddhism, being kathoey (an umbrella term that roughly maps to a range of things from MtF transsexualism to male homosexuality) is seen as being part of one's karma if it should be the case for a person. The response is one of \"pity\" rather than \"blame\". Kathoey are generally seen as not likely to form lasting relationships with men, and the lay explanation of their karma is that they are working out debts from adulterous behavior in past lives. In the past they disrupted marriages, and now they are doomed to never marry.\n\nIn Thailand, kathoey are still not allowed to legally become female or marry a man. Same-sex marriage is not possible in Thailand. Transgender women however can marry their European partners, if that is legislatively possible in their partner's country, and leave Thailand.\n\nIn Theravada Buddhism monks take vows of celibacy, and self-control over sexual impulses is idealized as part of the path to nirvana. In the 1980s, in response to growing awareness of the AIDS crisis, some Buddhist writers drew on Buddhist teachings to argue that homosexual behavior was unnatural and unethical and demonstrated a lack of self-control. However, other Buddhist scholars have argued that karmic debt only accumulates around heterosexual immorality when patriarchal notions of male ownership of female sexuality are disrupted (for example, pre-marital sex is \"theft of virginity\" by a man from the woman's father). According to this view, the difficulties and pain of gender variant lives are part of how this debt is \"paid off\" in subsequent lives and as such it incurs no \"additional\" karmic debt.\n\nShinto kami associated with same-sex love or gender variance include: shirabyōshi, female or transgender kami represented as half-human, half-snake. They are linked to Shinto priests of the same name, who are usually female (or occasionally transgender) and perform ceremonial dances in traditional men's clothing; Ōyamakui no kami, a transgender mountain spirit that protects industry and childbearing (notably enshrined in Hie Shrine); and Inari Ōkami, the kami of agriculture and rice, who is depicted as various genders, the most common representations being a young female food goddess, an old man carrying rice, and an androgynous bodhisattva. Inari is further associated with foxes and Kitsune, shapeshifting fox trickster spirits. Kitsune sometimes disguise themselves as women, independent of their true gender, in order to trick human men into sexual relations with them. Common belief in medieval Japan was that any woman encountered alone, especially at dusk or night, could be a fox.\n\nOne issue that Confucianism is quite clear on is the importance of filial piety with an accompanying tradition of veneration of the dead. People are supposed to respect and obey their parents, get married, and then have children to extend their family lines. Gender variant people who are physically capable of living up to this standard would be generally encouraged to enter a marital relationship, have children, and be discreet about any additional relationships (for example homosexual partners) on the side, if absolutely necessary.\n\nEunuchs, male-bodied people castrated for royal services, existed in China from 1700 BC until 1924 AD. This social role had a long history, with a continuous community, and a highly public role. Before being castrated a Chinese eunuch would be asked if he \"would ever regret being castrated\" and if the answer was \"no\" then surgery would take place. It's an open question as to who would answer this way and why. The historical status of Chinese eunuchs was a curious mixture of extreme weakness and great power. The allure of power and influence were sometimes offered as excuses for the decision to become a eunuch. It has been speculated that Chinese monarchs trusted their eunuchs because the inability to have children left them with no motivation to seek power or riches. It is not clear to what extent eunuchs were transgender or otherwise gender-variant, but the history of eunuchs in Chinese culture is important to its views on transgender people.\n\nThe Akan people of Ghana have a pantheon of gods that includes personifications of celestial bodies. These personification manifest as androgynous and transgender deities, and include Abrao (Jupiter), Aku (Mercury), and Awo (Moon).\n\nAccording to the creation myth of the Dogon people the first 8 people on the earth, 4 men and 4 women, started the 8 Dogon families through a special arrangement with Amman where they could fertilize themselves, being dual and bisexual.\n\nThe mythology of the Shona people of Zimbabwe is ruled over by an androgynous creator god called Mwari, who occasionally splits into separate male and female aspects.\n\nThe Rainbow Serpent Ungud has been described as androgynous. Shaman identify their erect penises with Ungud, and his androgyny inspires some to undergo ceremonial penile subincision. Angamunggi is another Rainbow Serpent, worshipped as a \"giver of life\".\n\nOther Australian mythological beings include Labarindja, blue-skinned wild women or \"demon women\" with hair the colour of smoke. Stories about them show them to be completely uninterested in romance or sex with men, and any man forcing his attention upon them could die, due the \"evil magic in their vaginas\". They are sometimes depicted as gynandrous or intersex, having both a penis and a vagina. Ths is represented in ritual by having their part played by men in women's clothes.\n\nThird gender, or gender variant, spiritual intermediaries are found in many pacific island cultures, including the bajasa of the eastern Toradja people of Sulawesi, the bantut of the Tausūg people of the south Philippines, and the bayoguin of the pre-Christian Philippines. These shamans are typically biologically male but display feminine behaviours and appearance, and are often homoerotically inclined. The pre-Christian Philippines had a polytheistic religion, which included the hermaphroditic gods Bathala and Malyari, whose names means \"Man and Woman in One\" and \"Powerful One\" respectively; these gods are worshipped by the Bayagoin.\n\nThe Big Nambas speakers of Vanuatu have the concept of divinely approved-of homoerotic relationships between men, with the older partner called the \"dubut\". This name is derived from the word for shark, referring to the patronage of the shark-human hybrid creator god Qat.\n\nAmong their pantheon of deities, the Ngaju people of Borneo worship Mahatala-Jata, an androgynous god. The male part of this god is Mahatala, who rules the Upper World, and is depicted as a hornbill living above the clouds on a mountain-top; the female part is Jata, who rules the Underworld from under the sea in the form of a water-snake. These two manifestations are linked via a jewel-encrusted bridge that is seen in the physical world as a rainbow. Mahatala-Jata is served by \"balian\", female hierodules, and \"basir\"\", transgender shamans metaphorically described as \"water snakes which are at the same time hornbills\".\n\nSimilar transgender shamans, the \"manang bali\" (which literally means a transformed shaman from a male into a woman), are found in the Iban people in Borneo such as in Sarawak. \"Manang bali\" is the third and highest degree of shamanism after accomplishing the second degree of \"manang mansau\" \"cooked shaman\" and the first degree of \"manang mataq\" \"uncooked shaman\". The initiation ceremony for becoming a manang bali is called \"Manang bangun manang enjun\" which can be literally translated as the Awakened shaman, shaken shaman. After this ceremony, a manang bali dresses and acts like women and have homoerotic relationships. This makes them both the target of ridicule and respected as a spiritual intermediary. Boys fated to become manang bali may first dream of becoming a woman and also of being summoned by the god of medicine Menjaya Raja Manang or the goddess Ini Inee or Ini Andan, who is regarded the natural-born healer and the god of justice. Menjaya Raja Manang began existence as a malegod, until their brother Sengalang Burong's wife became extremely sick. This prompted Menjaya into becoming the world's first healer, allowing him to cure his sister-in-law, but this treatment also resulted in Menjaya changing into a woman or androgynous being. Menjaya was consecrated as the first manang bali by his own sister, Ini Inee Ini Andan in the first ever awakening-shaking ceremony and the first healing by a name-changing \"belian\" curing rite.\n\nIn most branches of Wicca, a person's status as trans- or cisgender is not considered an issue. Transgender people are generally magickal people, according to Karla McLaren in her \"Energetic Boundaries\" study guide. Transgender people are almost always welcomed in individual communities, covens, study groups, and circles. Many transgender people were initially attracted to Modern Paganism because of this inclusion.\n\nHowever, there are some Neopagan groups that do not welcome transgender people. In some cases, this is because of the emphasis on the union of male and female, and the exclusion of transgender individuals from such practices. Also, some gender separatist groups exclude transgender people, often on the basis that non-transgender individuals share certain spiritual qualities derived from genetic or biological sex. Dianic Wicca is an example of such a separatist group.\n\nThe patron god is Dionysus, a god gestated in the thigh of his father Zeus, after his mother died from being overwhelmed by Zeus's true form. Aphroditus was an androgynous Aphrodite from Cyprus with a religious cult in which worshipers cross-dressed, in later mythology became known as Hermaphroditus, the son of Hermes and Aphrodite who merged bodies with the water nymph Salmacis, transforming him into an androgynous being. In Phrygia there was Agdistis, a hermaphroditic being created when Zeus unwittingly impregnated Gaia. The gods feared Agdistis and Dionysus castrated her; she then became the goddess Cybele.\n\nIn addition, Norse gods were capable of changing gender at will, for example Loki, frequently disguised himself as a woman and gave birth to a foal while in the form of a white mare, after a sexual encounter with the stallion Svaðilfari. Comparison of a man to a child-bearing woman was a common insult in Scandinavia, and the implication that Loki may be bisexual was considered an insult.\n\nHuman fertility was a major aspect of Egyptian mythology, and was often entwined with the crop fertility provided by annual flooding of the river Nile. This connection was shown in iconography of Nile-gods, such as Hapi, god of the Nile, and Wadj-wer, god of the Nile Delta, who although male were depicted with female attributes such as pendulous breasts, symbolizing the fertility the river provides.\n\nGender Identity In Halakhic Discourse by Charlotte Fonrobert, part of \"Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia\" \n\"Transitional Belief: Christianity as Viewed through the Lens of a Transgender Believer\" by Mr. Ashley Ford (Jul 12, 2013)\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41358745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41358745", "title": "Zoroastrianism in India", "text": "Zoroastrianism in India\n\nZoroastrianism in India has significant history within the country. Zoroastrians have lived in India since the Sasanian period. The Zoroastrians also moved to India in successive migrations during the Islamic period. The initial migration following the Muslim conquest of Persia has been canonized as a religious persecution by invading Muslims. Zoroastrianism meanwhile suffered a decline in Iran after the conquests. Subsequent migrations also took place after the attempts by Safavids to convert their subjects to Shiism.\n\nDue to persecution of Zoroastrians in other countries and the liberal atmosphere and patronisation of India, today the largest population of Zoroastrians resides in India, where Zoroastrians have been allowed to play a notable role in the Indian economy, entertainment, the armed forces, and the Indian freedom movement during British Raj. The Zoroastrian groups are regarded as either Parsi or Irani depending on the time of migration to India.\n\nBy 632 A.D., Yazdgird III came to power in Iran but the Arab/Muslim army had already begun invading Iran. The Muslims defeated them at Nahavand and Yazdgird was slain by a miller in Merv in 652, bringing an end to the Sasanian dynasty and thus of the official history of Zoroastrian Iran. While losing their religion and script along with some Sasanian historiographical literature, the language and culture essentially survived. Between the seventh and thirteenth century, political and social pressures resulted in ascendancy of Iranian Muslim over the Zoroastrians. With the conquests, Iranians gradually lost their predominant religion. \n\nThe Zoroastrians moved to India in successive migrations in the Islamic period. The initial migration following the conquest has been characterized as a religious persecution by invading Muslims. According to the account, the Zoroastrians suffered at their hands and in order to protect themselves and safeguard their religion, fled first to northern Iran, then to the island of Hormuz and finally to India. This generally accepted narrative of migration emphasises Muslim persecution while identifying Parsis as religious refugees. Recently, scholars have questioned this explanation of Iranian origins. There is a scarcity of sources about the migration. Historians are forced to rely exclusively on \"Qissa-i Sanjan\" written in 1599 by a Parsi Priest and \"Qissah-ye Zartushtian-e Hindustan\" written more than 200 years later. This is complicated by the fact that there were already Zoroastrians in India in the Sasanian period. \n\nIranian Zoroastrians are known to have been trading with India for centuries before the dates calculated for arrival of Parsis per Qissa-i Sanjan. Ruksana Nanji and Homi Dhalla while discussing archaeological evidence for 'The Landing of Zoroastrians at Sanjan', conclude that the most likely date for the migration at the start of the middle phase of their chronology, namely the early-to-mid-eighth century. Nevertheless, they express their general skepticism about the Qissa-i Sanjan account. Scholar Andre Wink has theorized that Zoroastrian immigrants to India, both before and after the Muslim conquest of Iran, were primarily merchants, since evidence suggests it was only some time after their arrival that religious experts and priests were sent for to join them. He argues that the competition over trade routes with Muslims may also have contributed to their immigration.\n\nAlthough historically unsubstantiated, the story of how Zoroastrians gained permission to step on the shores of Gujarat continues to be critical to the self-identity of the group. Per the commonly told narrative, the Rajah of Sanjan, summoned them and demanded to know how they wouldn't be a burden on or a threat to the indigenous communities. Replying to their request of practising their religion and till the land, he showed them a jug full of milk, saying Sanjan like it was full. In one version, a dastur added a coin to the milk, saying like the coin, no one would be able to see that they were there but they would enrich the milk nonetheless. In another version, he added sugar instead and claimed that like it, they would sweeten lands of Sanjan. In both of them their settlement is approved by the Rajah who addresses certain conditions for it: they would explain their religion, promise not to proselytise, adopt Gujarati speech and dress, surrender their weapons and only conduct their rituals after nightfall. During this period, Zoroastrian traders faced execution outside India, including in China where many were killed during the Guangzhou massacre.\n\nThe immigration of Zoroastrians to India continued, and by 1477 they had lost all contact with Persia. Not until three hundred years had passed would they come into contact. Zoroastrians also played a notable role during the freedom movements of India. There were also subsequent migrations, especially resulting from attempts of Safavids' to convert their subjects to Shia Islam in the sixteenth century. This added to the Parsi population and cemented their close association with Iran.\n\nDuring the Indian Mutiny of 1857, there were attacks by Muslims on Zoroastrians at Bharuch. \n\nAccording to the 2011 Census of India, there are 57,264 Parsis in India, and the 2014 figures indicate there are now 69,000. The previous figure of Zoroastrians in the diaspora, and on the results of the Indian census of 1981, which counted over 71,630 Zoroastrians. Independent estimates are that there are at least 100,000 Zoroastrians in India.\n\nThe Zoroastrian community in India remains one of the most recognized groups, playing a part in various commercial sectors such as industry, movies, and politics.\n\nThere are two major Zoroastrian communities in India.\n\nThe word \"Parsi\" in the Persian language literally means \"Persian\". Persian is the official language of modern Iran, which is also known as Persia. The language (\"Parsi\") is commonly referred to as \"Farsi\", because, after the Arab invasion of Persia, because of the absence of the \"P / G / Zh / Ch\" sounds in the Arabic language, \"Parsi\" became \"Farsi\". Similarly, Babak Khorramdin's first name, originally \"Papak\" (Papa + Kuchak = Papak), \"Young Father\", became \"Babak\".\n\nThe long presence of the Parsis in the Gujarat and Sindh areas of India is supported by a Genetic study and it also distinguishes them from the smaller Zoroastrian Indian community of Iranis, who are more recent arrivals.\n\nAlthough the term 'Irani' is first attested during the Mughal era, most Iranis are immigrants who arrived on the subcontinent during the 19th and early 20th centuries, that is, when Iran was ruled by the Qajars and when religious persecution of non-Muslims was rampant. The descendants of the immigrants of those times remain culturally and linguistically closer to the Zoroastrians of Iran, in particular to the Zoroastrians of Yazd and Kerman. Consequently, the Dari dialect of the Zoroastrians of those provinces may be heard among the Iranis.\n\n\n"}
