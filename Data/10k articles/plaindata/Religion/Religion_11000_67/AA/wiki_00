Nevertheless, he is viewed to have been a Zoroastrian convert to Islam. A large number of couplets by him were included in the epic Shahname (Book of Kings) by the Persian epic poet Ferdowsi.

{"id": "405839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=405839", "title": "Apocatastasis", "text": "Apocatastasis\n\nApocatastasis (, from , \"apokatástasis\") is reconstitution, restitution, or restoration to the original or primordial condition.\n\nThe \"Liddell and Scott\" entry (with expansion of definitions and references), gives the following examples of usage:\n\nThe word is reasonably common in papyri.\n\nAccording to Edward Moore, \"apokatastasis\" was first properly conceptualized in early Stoic thought, particularly by Chrysippus. The return (\"apokatastasis\") of the planets and stars to their proper \"celestial signs\", namely their original positions, would spark a conflagration of the universe (\"ekpyrosis\"). The original position was believed to consist of an alignment of celestial bodies with Cancer. Thereafter, from fire, rebirth would commence, and this cycle of alternate destruction and recreation was correlated with a divine Logos. \"Antapocatastasis\" is a counter-recurrence when the stars and planets align with Capricorn, which would mark destruction by a universal flood.\n\nThe Stoics identified Zeus with an alternately expanding and contracting fire constituting the universe. Its expansion was described as Zeus turning his thoughts outwards, resulting in the creation of the material cosmos, and its contraction, the \"apocatastasis\", as Zeus returning to self-contemplation. Leibniz explored both Stoic and his understanding of Origen's philosophy in two essays written shortly before his death, \"Apokatastasis\" and \"Apokatastasis panton\" (1715).\n\nThe concept of \"restore\" or \"return\" in the Hebrew Bible is the common Hebrew verb , as used in Malachi 4:6, the only use of the verb form of apocatastasis in the Septuagint. This is used in the \"restoring\" of the fortunes of Job, and is also used in the sense of rescue or return of captives, and in the restoration of Jerusalem.\n\nThis is similar to the concept of tikkun olam in Hasidic Judaism.\n\nThe word, \"apokatastasis\", appears only once in the New Testament, in Acts 3:21. Peter healed a beggar with a disability and then addressed the astonished onlookers. His sermon set Jesus in the Jewish context, the fulfiller of the Abrahamic Covenant, and says:\nGrammatically, the relative pronoun \"ὧν\" (\"of which\", genitive plural), could refer to \"χρόνων\" (\"of times\"), in which case the central phrase would mean \"till a restitution of all times of which God spake\", or to \"πάντων\" (\"of all\" or \"of all things\"), meaning \"till times of a restitution of all things of which God spake\".\n\nThe usual view taken of Peter's use of the \"\"apokatastasis\" of all the things about which God spoke\" is that it refers to the restoration of the Kingdom of Israel and/or the Garden of Eden and not \"all things that ever existed\".\n\nThe verbal form of \"apokatastasis\" is found in the Septuagint Malachi 3:23LXX (i.e. ), a prophecy of Elijah \"turning back\" the hearts of the children to their fathers; in (\"he will \"restore\" all things\"), echoing Malachi, and in (\"that I may be \"restored\" to you the sooner\").\n\nNineteenth-century German theologian Jakob Eckermann interpreted \"the 'apocatastasis of all things' to mean the universal emendation of religion by the doctrine of Christ, and the 'times of refreshing' to be the day of renewal, the times of the Messiah.\"\n\nThe significance of \"apocatastasis\" in early Christianity is today being re-evaluated. In particular it is now questioned whether Origen, often listed as the most notable advocate of universal salvation, did in fact teach or believe in such a doctrine.\n\nFrederick W. Norris, in his article , states that the positions that Origen takes on the issue of universal salvation have often seemed to be contradictory. \"In scattered places Origen says quite clearly that he thinks all created intelligence will be restored to God at the end of time. In other places he says, equally clearly, that only souls who make the choice for God and practice the virtues God demands will come to rest in heaven. Those who do not live for God shall suffer eternally in hell or perhaps be annihilated there. If in coming years Origen's treatise on the resurrection is rediscovered, this apparent contradiction may be settled.\" He concludes: \"One could not know in advance which audience would be most likely to accept the gospel, because of the hope engendered by God's overpowering love or because of the fear stimulated by God's threat of hell coupled with God's demand for ethical living. Most audiences of hearers or readers include both groups; knowing this, Origen the pastoral preacher probably kept his view of salvation economically 'open' for a greater effectiveness.\"\n\nKonstantinovsky (2009) states that the uses of \"apocatastasis\" in Christian writings prior to the Synod of Constantinople (543) and the anathemas (553) pronounced against \"Origenists\" and Evagrius Ponticus were neutral and referred primarily to concepts similar to the general \"restoration of all things spoken\" (\"restitutio omnium quae locutus est Deus\") of Peter in Acts 3:21 and not for example the universal reconciliation of all souls which had ever been.\n\nThe term \"apocatastasis\" is mentioned in the 14th of the 15 anathemas against Origen of 553: \"If anyone shall say ... that in this pretended apocatastasis, spirits only will continue to exist, as it was in the feigned pre-existence: let him be anathema.\"\n\nA form of \"apocatastasis\" was also attributed to Gregory of Nyssa and possibly the Ambrosiaster, attributed to Ambrose of Milan. Gregory of Nazianzus discussed it without reaching a decision.\n\nA local Synod of Constantinople (543) condemned a form of apocatastasis as being Anathema, and the Anathema was formally submitted to the Fifth Ecumenical Council of Constantinople (553). Since \"apocatastasis\" had been used earlier in writers commenting on Peter's use in the New Testament, the form of \"apocatastasis\" condemned in 543 and 553 was a later development.\n\nOrigen of Alexandria's other teachings about the possibility of glorified man falling again also played a role in that condemnation. In fact, most historians today would recognize a distinction between Origen's own teachings (or at least those that have survived) and the theological positions of later \"Origenists\". Even beliefs long attributed to Origen himself, such as a Platonic version of souls existing before bodies, the possibility of a second fall, are found to be much more nuanced and difficult to pin down in Origen's own writings. The Anathema against apocatastasis, or more accurately, against the belief that hell is not eternal, was not ratified despite support from the Emperor, and it is absent from the Anathemas spoken against Origen at Constantinople II.\n\nThe Alexandrian school adapted Platonic terminology and ideas to Christianity while explaining and differentiating the new faith from all the others. Proponents cited Biblical passage in in support.\n\nThe gnostic Gospel of Philip \"180–350c\" contains the term itself but does not teach universal reconciliation:\n\nClement of Alexandria (c. 150 – c. 215) generally uses the term \"apokatastasis\" to refer to the \"restoration\" of the \"gnostic\" Christians, rather than that of the universe or of all Christians, but with universal implications.\n\nAs indicated above, the position of Origen (186–284) is disputed, with works as recent as the New Westminster Dictionary of Church History presenting him as speculating that the apocatastasis would involve universal salvation.\n\nIn early Christian theological usage \"apocatastasis\" meant the ultimate restoration of all things to their original state, which early exponents believed would still entail a purgatorial state, Both Origen and Gregory of Nyssa hoped that all creatures would be saved. The word was still very flexible at that time, but in the mid-6th century it became virtually a technical term referring, as usually today, to a specifically Origenistic doctrine of universal salvation. Maximus the Confessor outlined God's plan for \"universal\" salvation alongside warnings of everlasting punishment for the wicked.\n\nThe Vulgate translation of \"apokatastasis\", \"in tempora restitutionis omnium quae locutus est Deus\" (the restitution of all things of which God has spoken) was taken up by Luther to mean the day of the restitution of the creation, but in Luther's theology the day of restitution was also the day of resurrection and judgment, not the restitution of the wicked. In Luther's Bible he rendered the Greek \"apokatastasis\" with the German \"herwiedergebracht werde\"; \"will be brought back.\" This sense continued to be used in Lutheran sermons.\n\nLuther explicitly disowned belief that the devils would ultimately reach blessedness.\n\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries several histories published by Universalists, including Hosea Ballou (1829), Thomas Whittemore (1830), John Wesley Hanson (1899) and George T. Knight (1911), argued that belief in universal reconciliation was found in early Christianity and in the Reformation, and ascribed Universalist beliefs to Origen, Clement of Alexandria, and others.\n\nIn recent writing, apocatastasis is generally understood as involving some form of universal reconciliation, without necessarily attributing this understanding to Origen and other Fathers of the Church.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1014590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1014590", "title": "Cannabis sativa", "text": "Cannabis sativa\n\nCannabis sativa is an annual herbaceous flowering plant indigenous to eastern Asia but now of cosmopolitan distribution due to widespread cultivation. It has been cultivated throughout recorded history, used as a source of industrial fiber, seed oil, food, recreation, religious and spiritual moods and medicine. Each part of the plant is harvested differently, depending on the purpose of its use. The species was first classified by Carl Linnaeus in 1753.\n\nThe flowers of \"Cannabis sativa\" are unisexual and plants are most often either male or female. It is a short-day flowering plant, with staminate (male) plants usually taller and less robust than pistillate (female or male) plants The flowers of the female plant are arranged in racemes and can produce hundreds of seeds. Male plants shed their pollen and die several weeks prior to seed ripening on the female plants. Under typical conditions with a light period of 12 to 14 hours both sexes are produced in equal numbers because of heritable X and Y chromosomes. Although genetic factors dispose a plant to become male or female, environmental factors including the diurnal light cycle can alter sexual expression. Naturally occurring monoecious plants, with both male and female parts, are either sterile or fertile but artificially induced \"hermaphrodites\" can have fully functional reproductive organs. \"Feminized\" seed sold by many commercial seed suppliers are derived from artificially \"hermaphrodytic\" females that lack the male gene, or by treating the plants with hormones or silver thiosulfate.\n\nAlthough the main psychoactive constituent of \"Cannabis\" is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the plant is known to contain more than 500 compounds, among them at least 113 cannabinoids; however, most of these \"minor\" cannabinoids are only produced in trace amounts. Besides THC, another cannabinoid produced in high concentrations by some plants is cannabidiol (CBD), which is not psychoactive but has recently been shown to block the effect of THC in the nervous system. Differences in the chemical composition of \"Cannabis\" varieties may produce different effects in humans. Synthetic THC, called dronabinol, does not contain cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), or other cannabinoids, which is one reason why its pharmacological effects may differ significantly from those of natural \"Cannabis\" preparations.\n\n\"Beside cannabinoids, Cannabis\" chemical constituents include about 120 compounds responsible for its characteristic aroma. These are mainly volatile terpenes and sesquiterpenes.\n\nHuman intervention has produced variation within the species and some authorities only recognize one species in the genus that has had divergent selective pressure to either produce plants with more fiber or plants with greater THC content. Large variability exists within either species, and there is an expanding discussion whether the existing paradigm used to differentiate species adequately represents the variability found within the genus \"Cannabis\". There are five chemotaxonomic types of \"Cannabis\": one with high levels of THC, one which is more fibrous and has higher levels of CBD, one that is an intermediate between the two, another one with high levels of cannabigerol (CBG), and the last one almost without cannabinoids.\n\n\"Cannabis\" strains with relatively high CBD:THC ratios are less likely to induce anxiety than vice versa. This may be due to CBD's antagonistic effects at the cannabinoid receptors, compared to THC's partial agonist effect. CBD is also a 5-HT receptor (serotonin) agonist, which may also contribute to an anxiolytic-content effect. The effects of \"sativa\" are well known for its cerebral high, while \"indica\" is well known for its sedative effects which some prefer for night time use. Both types are used as medical cannabis. \"Indica\" plants are normally shorter and stockier than \"sativas\". They have broader, deeply serrated leaves and a compact and dense flower cluster.\n\n\"Cannabis sativa\" seeds are chiefly used to make hempseed oil which can be used for cooking, lamps, lacquers or paints. They can also be used as caged-bird feed, as they provide a moderate source of nutrients for most birds. The flowers (and to a lesser extent the leaves, stems, and seeds) contain psychoactive chemical compounds known as cannabinoids that are consumed for recreational, medicinal and spiritual purposes. When so used, preparations of flowers (marijuana) and leaves and preparations derived from resinous extract (e.g., hashish) are consumed by smoking, vaporising and oral ingestion. Historically, tinctures, teas and ointments have also been common preparations. In traditional medicine of India in particular \"C. sativa\" has been used as hallucinogenic, hypnotic, sedative, analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent. Cannabis sativa has been used in medical practices as a therapeutic alternative for people with mental illnesses to lift off stress which leads recreational users to believe that sativa can aid them with their stress heavy lives. However, recent ethnopharmacology studies have shown that sativa can actually cause sleep disorders and heighten neurological and psychiatric illness.\n\nA \"Cannabis\" plant in the vegetative growth phase of its life requires more than 12–13 hours of light per day to stay vegetative. Flowering usually occurs when darkness equals at least 12 hours per day. The flowering cycle can last anywhere between nine and fifteen weeks, depending on the strain and environmental conditions.\n\nIn soil, the optimum pH for the plant is 6.3 to 6.8. In hydroponic growing, the nutrient solution is best at 5.2 to 5.8, making \"Cannabis\" well-suited to hydroponics because this pH range is hostile to most bacteria and fungi.\n\nTissue culture multiplication has become important in producing medically important clones, while seed production remains the generally preferred means of multiplication.\n\nBroadly, there are three main cultivar groups of cannabis that are cultivated today:\n"}

Intermittent conflicts in the area brought widespread poverty. Her parents were Giorgio and Bilia de Ferrari Mattei. Her father was an unemployed tool-maker, while her mother was a weaver who was able to support the family. Her father was often despondent and quarrelsome, thus the family environment was usually one of conflict.\n\nShe is said to have had, at about the age of nine, a vision of Jesus, who appeared to her as a boy of about ten. She would also begin to have visions of other saints such as the Dominicans Catherine of Siena and Peter Martyr. The Virgin told her that Jesus wanted to have her as his Bride, as a token of which she was given a wedding ring, which she had all her life—but which only she could see. She began to have frequent ecstasies and visions of Jesus, who always appeared to her as the same age she was at the time of the vision.\n\nMany miracles would result from her visions: a broken dish was made whole again, and money and food would be provided when the family’s poverty was extreme. In times of trial she received great consolation from the aspiration, \"Jesus, is my only hope!\"\n\nBlessed Catherine eventually joined the Dominican Order herself, but, like St. Catherine, she was opposed in this wish by her family. As a result, instead of entering a monastery of the cloistered nuns of the Order, she became a tertiary of the Order, continuing to live with her family. As the visions increased she received the stigmata, although, the wounds were not visible until after her death.\n\nHer mystical experiences roused a storm of gossip among her neighbors, who were terrified at the lights and sounds that came from her home; even the Dominican friars began to ostracize her. Eventually she was forced out of the town and settled in the city of Racconigi. During her lifetime, Catherine was sought for counsel and prayer. She would keep in her prayers in a special way the salvation of soldiers who were dying in battle.\n\nMany miracles took place before and after her death and her detractors came to acknowledge the holiness of her life. Her cult was approved in 1810 by Pope Pius VII.\n\n"}
{"id": "218264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=218264", "title": "Christological argument", "text": "Christological argument\n\nThe Christological argument for the existence of God, which exists in several forms, holds that if certain claims about Jesus are valid, one should accept that God exists. There are three main threads; the argument from the wisdom of Jesus, the argument from the claims of Jesus as son of God and the argument from the resurrection.\n\nThe essential structure of this argument is as follows:\n\nSome forms of evangelism take this approach. Potential converts are introduced to Jesus as a historical character and the merits of Jesus' teachings are discussed. In such a context, the historicity of Jesus of Nazareth is a crucial factor in assessing the argument.\n\nThe principal objections to (1) are the suggestions that:\n\nLewis's trilemma is an apologetic argument traditionally used to argue for the divinity of Jesus by arguing that the only alternatives were that he was evil or deluded. One version was popularised by University of Oxford literary scholar and writer C. S. Lewis in a BBC radio talk and in his writings. It is sometimes described as the \"Lunatic, Liar, or Lord\", or \"Mad, Bad, or God\" argument. It takes the form of a trilemma — a choice among three options, each of which is in some way difficult to accept.\n\nThis argument is very popular with Christian apologists, although some theologians and biblical scholars do not view Jesus as having claimed to be God. Some argue that he identified himself as a divine agent, with a unique relationship to Israel's God. Others see him as wanting to direct attention to the divine kingdom he proclaimed.\n\nThe argument relies on the premise that Jesus was a great moral teacher. The structure of the argument is as follows:\n\nThose who dispute these premises suggest that:\n\nPhilosopher John Beversluis described Lewis's arguments as \"textually careless and theologically unreliable\", and this particular argument as logically unsound and an example of false dilemma. New Testament scholar N. T. Wright criticises Lewis for failing to recognise the significance of Jesus' Jewish identity and setting – an oversight which \"at best, drastically short-circuits the argument\" and which lays Lewis open to criticism that his argument \"doesn't work as history, and it backfires dangerously when historical critics question his reading of the gospels\", although he believes this \"doesn't undermine the eventual claim\".\n\nAnother argument is that the resurrection of Jesus occurred and was an act of God, hence God must exist. Some version of this argument have been presented, such as N. T. Wright's argument from the nature of the claim of resurrection to its occurrence and the \"minimal facts argument\", defended by scholars such as Gary Habermas and Mike Licona, which defend that God raising Jesus from the dead is \"the best explanation for a set of claimed historical facts about Jesus and his disciples\".\n\nWilliam Lane Craig, another advocate of this last argument, includes in the list of facts: \n\nIn light of these, he goes on to say the best explanation is that God raised Jesus from the dead.\n\nSuch arguments have had many responses which depends on the version in question. The \"minimal facts argument\", for instance, have been criticized both regarding the actual veracity of the claimed historical facts as well as the inference to the best explanation being that God rose Jesus from the dead. In the second case, people such as Gerd Lüdemmann justify their rejection based on philosophical reasons while others, such as Bart D. Ehrman, do by more methodological reasons. Regarding the claimed facts, Ehrman and others defend that the sources used in their defense (normally the Gospels) are not trustworthy and so the facts can't be credibly established, while others have provided positive reasons to attest them as false.\n\nThis is the major position in Islam, which rejects that Jesus ever was crucified. Islamic texts categorically deny the crucifixion and death of Jesus at the hands of the Jews. The Qur'an states that the Jews sought to kill Jesus, but they did not kill or crucify him, although a likeness of it was shown to them. Traditionalists believe that Jesus was not crucified but instead was raised alive into heaven. This raising is understood by them to mean bodily ascension, while some Qur'anic scholars, such as Muhammad Asad, while cross referencing the text consider it to mean being raised in honour: \nAccording to some Muslim traditions, Jesus was replaced by a double; others suggest it was Simon of Cyrene, or one of the disciples such as Judas Iscariot. Some others view it as Jesus surviving the crucifixion. A minority of commentaries of Ismaili or rationalist (\"falāsifa\") leaning affirmed the crucifixion by arguing that Jesus' body had been crucified, but his spirit had ascended. However, this interpretation was generally rejected, and according to the \"Encyclopedia of Islam\", there was unanimous agreement among the scholars in denying the crucifixion, despite famous Muslim apologist Shabir Ally have demonstrated that it is possible that Jesus was not crucified at all. Modern commentators such as M. Hayek interpret the verse to say that the crucifixion \"seemed thus to them\" [i.e. the Jews].\n"}
{"id": "6623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6623", "title": "Conservative Judaism", "text": "Conservative Judaism\n\nConservative Judaism (known as Masorti Judaism outside North America) is a major Jewish denomination which views Jewish law, or \"Halakha\", as both binding and subject to historical development. The Conservative rabbinate therefore employs modern historical-critical research, rather than only traditional methods and sources, and lends great weight to its constituency when determining its stance on matters of law. The movement considers its approach as the authentic and most appropriate continuation of \"halakhic\" discourse, maintaining both fealty to received forms and flexibility in their interpretation. It also eschews strict theological definitions, lacking a consensus in matters of faith and allowing great pluralism.\n\nWhile regarding itself as the heir of Rabbi Zecharias Frankel's 19th-century Positive-Historical School in Europe, Conservative Judaism fully institutionalized as a denomination only in the United States during the mid-20th century. Its largest center today is in North America, where its main congregational arm is the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism and the New York–based Jewish Theological Seminary of America operates as rabbinic seminary. Worldwide, affiliated communities are united within the umbrella organization Masorti Olami. Conservative Judaism is estimated to represent close to 1.1 million people, both more than 600,000 registered adult congregants and many non-member identifiers.\n\nThe term \"conservative\" was meant to signify that Jews should attempt to conserve Jewish tradition, rather than reform or abandon it, and does not imply the movement's adherents are politically conservative.\n\nConservative Judaism, from its earliest stages, was marked by ambivalence and ambiguity in all matters theological. Rabbi Zecharias Frankel, considered its intellectual progenitor, believed the very notion of theology was alien to traditional Judaism. He was often accused of obscurity on the subject by his opponents, both Reform and Orthodox. The American movement largely espoused a similar approach, and its leaders mostly avoided the field. Only in 1985 did a course about Conservative theology open in the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS). The hitherto sole major attempt to define a clear credo was made in 1988, with the Statement of Principles \"Emet ve-Emunah\" (Truth and Belief), formulated and issued by the Leadership Council of Conservative Judaism. The introduction stated that \"lack of definition was useful\" in the past but a need to articulate one now arose. The platform provided many statements citing key concepts such as God, revelation and Election, but also acknowledged that a variety of positions and convictions existed within denominational ranks, eschewing strict delineation of principles and often expressing conflicting views. In a 1999 special edition of \"Conservative Judaism\" dedicated to the matter, leading rabbis Elliot N. Dorff and Gordon Tucker clarified that \"the great diversity\" within the movement \"makes the creation of a theological vision shared by all neither possible nor desirable\".\n\nConservative Judaism largely upholds the theistic notion of a personal God. \"Emet ve-Emunah\" stated that \"we affirm our faith in God as the Creator and Governor of the universe. His power called the world into being; His wisdom and goodness guide its destiny.\" \nConcurrently, the platform also noted that His nature was \"elusive\" and subject to many options of belief. A naturalistic conception of divinity, regarding it as inseparable from the mundane world, once had an important place within the denomination, especially represented by Mordecai Kaplan. After Kaplan's Reconstructionism fully coalesced into an independent movement, these views were marginalized.\n\nA similarly inconclusive position is expressed toward other precepts. Most theologians adhere to the Immortality of the Soul, but while references to the Resurrection of the Dead are maintained, English translations of the prayers obscure the issue. In \"Emet\", it was stated that death is not tantamount to the end of one's personality. Relating to the Messianic ideal, the movement rephrased most petitions for the restoration of the Sacrifices into past tense, rejecting a renewal of animal offerings, though not opposing a Return to Zion and even a new Temple. The 1988 platform announced that \"some\" believe in classic eschathology, but dogmatism in this matter was \"philosophically unjustified\". The notions of Election of Israel and God's covenant with it were basically retained as well.\n\nConservative conception of Revelation encompasses an extensive spectrum. Zecharias Frankel himself applied critical-scientific methods to analyze the stages in the development of the Oral Torah, pioneering modern study of the Mishnah. He regarded the Beatified Sages as innovators who added their own, original contribution to the canon, not merely as expounders and interpreters of a legal system given in its entirety to Moses on Mount Sinai. Yet he also vehemently rejected utilizing these disciplines on the Pentateuch, maintaining it was beyond human reach and wholly celestial in origin. Frankel never elucidated his beliefs, and the exact correlation between human and divine in his thought is still subject to scholarly debate. A similar negative approach toward Higher Criticism, while accepting an evolutionary understanding of Oral Law, defined Rabbi Alexander Kohut, Solomon Schechter and the early generation of American Conservative Judaism. When JTS faculty began to embrace Biblical criticism in the 1920s, they adapted a theological view consistent with it: an original, verbal revelation did occur at Sinai, but the text itself was composed by later authors. The latter, classified by Dorff as a relatively moderate metamorphosis of the old one, is still espoused by few traditionalist right-wing Conservative rabbis, though it is marginalized among senior leadership.\n\nA small but influential segment within the JTS and the movement adhered, from the 1930s, to Mordecai Kaplan's philosophy that denied any form of revelation but viewed all scripture as a purely human product. Along with other Reconstructionist tenets, it dwindled as the latter consolidated into a separate group. Kaplan's views and the permeation of Higher Criticism gradually swayed most Conservative thinkers towards a non-verbal understanding of theophany, which has become dominant in the 1970s. This was en sync with the wider trend of lowering rates of Americans who accepted the Bible as the Word of God. Dorff categorized the proponents of this into two schools. One maintains that God projected some form of message which inspired the human authors of the Pentateuch to record what they perceived. The other is often strongly influenced by Franz Rosenzweig and other existentialists, but also attracted many Objectivists who consider human reason paramount. The second school states that God conferred merely his presence on those he influenced, without any communication, and the experience drove them to spiritual creativity. While they differ in the theoretical level surrounding revelation, both practically regard all scripture and religious tradition as a human product with certain divine inspiration – providing an understanding that recognizes Biblical Criticism and also justifies major innovation in religious conduct. The first doctrine, advocated by such leaders as rabbis Ben-Zion Bokser and Robert Gordis, largely imparted that some elements within Judaism are fully divine but determining which would be impractical, and therefore received forms of interpretation should be basically upheld. Exponents of the latter view, among them rabbis Louis Jacobs and Neil Gillman, also emphasized the encounter of God with the Jews as a collective and the role of religious authorities through the generations in determining what it implied. The stress on the supremacy of community and tradition, rather than individual consciousness, defines the entire spectrum of Conservative thought.\n\nThe Conservative mainstay was the adoption of the historical-critical method in understanding Judaism and setting its future course. In accepting an evolutionary approach to the religion, as something that developed over time and absorbed considerable external influences, the movement distinguished between the original meaning implied in traditional sources and the manner they were grasped by successive generations, rejecting belief in an unbroken chain of interpretation from God's original Revelation, immune to any major extraneous effects. This evolutionary perception of religion, while relatively moderate in comparison with more radical modernizers – the scholarship of the Positive-Historical school, for example, sought to demonstrate the continuity and cohesiveness of Judaism along the years – still challenged Conservative leaders.\n\nThey regarded tradition and received mores with reverence, especially the continued adherence to the mechanism of Religious Law (\"Halakha\"), opposing indiscriminate modification, and emphasized they should be changed only with care and caution, and remain observed by the people. Rabbi Louis Ginzberg, summarizing his movement's position, wrote:\n\nThis discrepancy between scientific criticism and insistence on heritage had to be compensated by a conviction that would forestall either deviation from accepted norms or laxity and apathy.\n\nA key doctrine which was to fulfill this capacity was the collective will of the Jewish people. Conservatives lent it great weight in determining religious practice, both in historical precedent and as a means to shape present conduct. Zecharias Frankel pioneered this approach; as Michael A. Meyer commented, \"the extraordinary status which he ascribed to the ingrained beliefs and practices of the community is probably the most original element of his thought.\" He turned it into a source of legitimacy for both change and preservation, but mostly the latter. The basic moderation and traditionalism of the majority among the people were to guarantee a sense of continuity and unity, restraining the guiding rabbis and scholars who at his age were intent on reform, but also allowing them maneuverability in adopting or discarding certain elements. Solomon Schechter espoused a similar position. He turned the old rabbinic concept of \"K'lal Yisrael\", which he translated as \"Catholic Israel\", into a comprehensive worldview. For him, the details of divine Revelation were of secondary significance, as historical change dictated its interpretation through the ages notwithstanding: \"the center of authority is actually removed from the Bible\", he surmised, \"and placed in some living body... in touch with the ideal aspirations and the religious needs of the age, best able to determine... This living body, however, is not represented by... priesthood, or Rabbihood, but by the collective conscience of Catholic Israel.\"\n\nThe scope, limits and role of this corpus were a matter for contention in Conservative ranks. Schechter himself used it to oppose any major break with either traditionalist or progressive elements within American Jewry of his day, while some of his successors argued that the idea became obsolete due to the great alienation of many from received forms, that had to be countered by innovative measures to draw them back. The Conservative rabbinate often vacillated on to which degree may the non-practicing, religiously apathetic strata be included as a factor within Catholic Israel, providing impulse for them in determining religious questions; even avant-garde leaders acquiesced that the majority could not serve that function. Right-wing critics often charged that the movement allowed its uncommitted laity an exaggerated role, conceding to its demands and successively stretching \"halakhic\" boundaries beyond any limit.\n\nThe Conservative leadership had limited success in imparting their worldview to the general public. While the rabbinate perceived itself as bearing a unique, original conception of Judaism, the masses lacked much interest, regarding it mainly as a compromise offering a channel for religious identification that was more traditional than Reform Judaism yet less strict than Orthodoxy. Only a low percentage of Conservative congregants actively pursue an observant lifestyle: in the mid-1980s, Charles Liebman and Daniel J. Elazar calculated that barely 3 to 4 per cent held to one quite thoroughly. This gap between principle and the public, more pronounced than in any other Jewish denomination, is often credited at explaining the decline of the Conservative movement. While some 41 per cent of American Jews identified with it in the 1970s, it had shrunk to an estimated 18 per cent (and 11 per cent among those under 30) in 2013.\n\nFidelity and commitment to \"Halakha\", while subject to criticism as disingenuous both from within and without, were and remain a cornerstone doctrine of Conservative Judaism: The movement views the legalistic system as normative and binding, and believes Jews must practically observe its precepts, like Sabbath, dietary ordinances, ritual purity, daily prayer with phylacteries and the like. Concurrently, examining Jewish history and rabbinic literature through the lens of academic criticism, it maintained that these laws were always subject to considerable evolution, and must continue to do so. \"Emet ve-Emunah\" titled its chapter on the subject with \"The Indispensability of Halakha\", stating that \"\"Halakha\" in its developing form is an indispensable element of a traditional Judaism which is vital and modern.\" Conservative Judaism regards itself as the authentic inheritor of a flexible legalistic tradition, charging the Orthodox with petrifying the process and Reform with abandoning it.\n\nThe tension between \"tradition and change\" – which were also the motto adopted by the movement since the 1950s – and the need to balance them were always a topic of intense debate within Conservative Judaism. In its early stages, the leadership opposed pronounced innovation, mostly adopting a relatively rigid position. Mordecai Kaplan's Reconstructionism raised the demand for thoroughgoing modification without much regard for the past or \"halakhic\" considerations, but senior rabbis opposed him vigorously. Even in the 1940s and 1950s, when Kaplan's influence grew, his superiors rabbis Ginzberg, Louis Finkelstein and Saul Lieberman espoused a very conservative line. Since the 1970s, with the strengthening of the liberal wing within the denomination, the majority in the Rabbinic Assembly opted for quite radical reformulations in religious conduct, but rejected the Reconstructionist non-\"halakhic\" approach, insisting that the legalistic method be maintained. The \"halakhic\" commitment of Conservative Judaism has been subject to much criticism, from within and without. Right-wing discontents, including the Union for Traditional Judaism which seceded in protest of the 1983 resolution to ordain women rabbis — adopted at an open vote, where all JTS faculty regardless of qualification were counted — contested the validity of this description, as well as progressives like Rabbi Neil Gillman, who exhorted the denomination to cease describing itself as \"halakhic\" in 2005, stating that after repeated concessions, \"our original claim has died a death by a thousand qualifications... It has lost all factual meaning.\"\n\nThe main body entrusted with formulating rulings, responsa and statues is the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards (CJLS), a panel with 25 voting legalistic specialists and further 11 observers. There is also the smaller \"Va'ad ha-Halakha\" (Law Committee) of Israel's Masorti Movement. Every responsa must receive a minimum of six voters to be considered an official position of the CJLS. Conservative Judaism explicitly acknowledges the principle of \"halachik\" pluralism, enabling the panel to adopt more than one resolution in any given subject. The final authority in each Conservative community is the local rabbi, the \"mara d'atra\" (Lord of the Locality, in traditional terms), enfranchised to adopt either minority or majority opinions from the CJLS or maintain local practice. Thus, on the issue of admitting openly Homosexual rabbinic candidates, the Committee approved two resolutions, one in favour and one against; the JTS took the lenient position, while the Seminario Rabinico Latinoamericano still adheres to the latter. Likewise, while most Conservative synagogues approved of egalitarianism for women in religious life, some still maintain traditional gender roles and do not count females for prayer quorums.\n\nThe Conservative treatment of \"Halakha\" is defined by several features, though the entire range of denominational \"Halakhic\" discourse cannot be sharply distinguished from either the traditional or Orthodox one. Rabbi David Golinkin, who attempted to classify its parameters, stressed that quite often rulings merely reiterate conclusions reached in older sources or even Orthodox ones. for example, in the details of preparing Sabbath ritual enclosures, it draws directly on the opinions of the \"Shulchan Aruch\" and Rabbi Hayim David HaLevi. Another tendency prevalent among the movement's rabbis, yet again not particular to it, is the adoption of the more lenient positions on the matters at question — though this is not universal, and responsa also took stringent ones not infrequently.\n\nA more distinctive characterization is a greater proclivity to base rulings on earlier sources, in the \"Rishonim\" or before them, as far back as the Talmud. Conservative decisors frequently resort to less canonical sources, isolated responsa or minority opinions. They demonstrate more fluidity in regards to established precedent and continuum in rabbinic literature, mainly those by the later authorities, and lay little stress on the perceived hierarchy between major and minor legalists of the past. They are far more inclined to contend (\"machloket\") with old rulings, to be flexible towards custom or to wholly disregard it. This is especially expressed in less hesitancy to rule against or notwithstanding the major codifications of Jewish Law, like \"Mishne Torah\", \"Arba'ah Turim\" and especially the \"Shulchan Aruch\" with its Isserles Gloss and later commentaries. Conservative authorities, while often relying on the \"Shulchan Aruch\" themselves, criticize the Orthodox for relatively rarely venturing beyond it and overly canonizing Rabbi Joseph Karo's work. In several occasions, Conservative rabbis discerned that the \"Shulchan Aruch\" ruled without firm precedent, sometimes deriving his conclusions from the \"Kabbalah\". An important example is the ruling of Rabbi Golinkin — contrary to the majority consensus among the \"Acharonim\" and the more prominent \"Rishonim\", but based on many opinions of the lesser \"Rishonim\" which is derived from a minority view in the Talmud — that the Sabbatical Year is not obligatory in present times at all (neither \"de'Oraita\" nor \"de'Rabanan\") but rather an act of piety.\n\nEthical considerations and the weight due to them in determining \"halakhic\" issues, mainly to what degree may modern sensibilities shape the outcome, are subject to much discourse. Right-wing decisors, like Rabbi Joel Roth, maintained that such elements are naturally a factor in formulating conclusions, but may not alone serve as a justification for adopting a position. The majority, however, basically subscribed to the opinion evinced already by Rabbi Seymour Siegel in the 1960s, that the cultural and ethical norms of the community, the contemporary equivalents of Talmudic \"Aggadah\", should supersede the legalistic forms when the two came into conflict and there was a pivotal ethical concern. Rabbi Elliot Dorff concluded that in contrast to the Orthodox, the denomination maintains that the juridical details and processes mainly serve higher moral purposes and could be modified if they no longer do so: \"in other words, the \"Aggadah\" should control the \"Halakha\".\" The liberal Rabbi Gordon Tucker, along with Gillman and other progressives, supported a far-reaching implementation of this approach, making Conservative Judaism much more \"Aggadic\" and allowing moral priorities an overriding authority at all occasions. This idea became very popular among the young generation, but it was not fully embraced either. In the 2006 resolution on homosexuals, the CJLS chose a middle path: they agreed that the ethical consideration of human dignity was of supreme importance, but not sufficient to uproot the express Biblical prohibition on not to lie with mankind as with womankind (traditionally understood as banning full anal intercourse). All other limitations, including on other forms of sexual relations, were lifted. A similar approach is manifest in the great weight ascribed to sociological changes in deciding religious policy. The CJLS and the Rabbinical Assembly members frequently state that circumstances were profoundly transformed in modern times, fulfilling the criteria mandating new rulings in various fields (based on general talmudic principles like \"Shinui ha-I'ttim\", \"Change of Times\"). This, along with the ethical aspect, was a main argument for revolutionizing the role of women in religious life and embracing egalitarianism.\n\nThe most distinctive feature of Conservative legalistic discourse, in which it is conspicuously and sharply different from Orthodoxy, is the incorporation of critical-scientific methods into the process. Deliberations almost always delineate the historical development of the specific issue at hand, from the earliest known mentions until modern times. This approach enables a thorough analysis of the manner in which it was practiced, accepted, rejected or modified in various periods, not necessarily en sync with the received rabbinic understanding. Archaeology, philology and Judaic Studies are employed; rabbis use comparative compendiums of religious manuscripts, sometimes discerning that sentences were only added later or include spelling, grammar and transcription errors, changing the entire understanding of certain passages. This critical approach is central to the movement, for its historicist underpinning stresses that all religious literature has an original meaning relevant in the context of its formulation. This meaning may be analyzed and discerned, and is distinct from the later interpretations ascribed by traditional commentators. Decisors are also far more prone to include references to external scientific sources in relevant fields, like veterinarian publications in \"halakhic\" matters concerning livestock.\n\nConservative authorities, as part of their promulgation of a dynamic \"Halakha\", often cite the manner in which the sages of old used rabbinic statues (\"Takkanah\") that enabled to bypass prohibitions in the Pentateuch, like the \"Prozbul\" or \"Heter I'ska\". In 1948, when employing those was first debated, Rabbi Isaac Klein argued that since there was no consensus on leadership within Catholic Israel, formulation of significant \"takkanot\" should be avoided. Another proposal, to ratify them only with a two-thirds majority in the RA, was rejected. New statues require a simple majority, 13 supporters among the 25 members of the CJLS. In the 1950s and 1960s, such drastic measures — as Rabbi Arnold M. Goodman cited in a 1996 writ allowing members of the priestly caste to marry divorcees, \"Later authorities were reluctant to assume such unilateral authority... fear that invoking this principle would create the proverbial slippery slope, thereby weakening the entire \"halakhic\" structure... thus imposed severe limitations on the conditions and situations where it would be appropriate\" — were carefully drafted as temporal, emergency ordinances (\"Horaat Sha'ah\"), grounded on the need the avoid a total rift of many nonobservant Jews. Later on, these ordinances became accepted and permanent on the practical level. The Conservative movement issued a wide range of new, thoroughgoing statues, from the famous 1950 responsum that allowed driving to the synagogue on the Sabbath and up to the 2000 decision to ban rabbis from inquiring about whether someone was a Bastard, de facto abolishing this legal category.\n\nThe RA and CJLS reached many decisions through the years, shaping a distinctive profile for Conservative practice and worship. In the 1940s, when the public demanded mixed seating of both sexes in synagogue, some rabbis argued there was no precedent but obliged on the ground of dire need (Eth la'asot); others noted that archaeological research showed no partitions in ancient synagogues. Mixed seating became commonplace in almost all congregations. In 1950, it was ruled that using electricity (that is, closure of an electrical circuit) did not constitute kindling a fire unto itself, not even in incandescent bulbs, and therefore was not a forbidden labour and could be done on the Sabbath. On that basis, while performing banned labours is of course forbidden – for example, video recording is still constituted as writing – switching lights and other functions are allowed, though the RA strongly urges adherents to keep the sanctity of the Sabbath (refraining from doing anything that may imitate the atmosphere of weekdays, like loud noise reminiscent of work).\n\nThe need to encourage arrival at synagogue also motivated the CJLS, during the same year, to issue a temporal statue allowing driving on that day, for that purpose alone; it was supported by decreeing that the combustion of fuel did not serve any of the acts prohibited during the construction of the Tabernacle, and could therefore be classified, according to their interpretation of the Tosafists' opinion, as \"redundant labour\" (\"Sh’eina Tzricha L’gufa\") and be permitted. The validity of this argument was heavily disputed within the denomination. In 1952, members of the priestly caste were allowed to marry divorcees, conditioned on forfeiture of their privileges, as termination of marriage became widespread and women who underwent it could not be suspected of unsavory acts. In 1967, the ban on priests marrying converts was also lifted.\n\nIn 1954, the issue of \"agunot\" (women refused divorce by their husbands) was largely settled by adding a clause to the prenuptial contract under which men had to pay alimony as long as they did not concede. In 1968, this mechanism was replaced by a retroactive expropriation of the bride price, rendering the marriage void. In 1955, more girls were celebrating Bat Mitzvah and demanded to be allowed ascents to the Torah, the CJLS agreed that the ordinance under which women were banned from this due to respect for the congregation (\"Kvod ha'Tzibur\") was no longer relevant. In 1972 it was decreed that rennet, even if derived from unclean animals, was so transformed that it constituted a wholly new item (\"Panim Chadashot ba'u l'Khan\") and therefore all hard cheese could be considered kosher.\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s saw the emergence of women's rights on the main agenda. Growing pressure led the CJLS to adopt a motion that females may be counted as part of a quorum, based on the argument that only the \"Shulchan Aruch\" explicitly stated that it consist of men. While accepted, this was very controversial in the Committee and heavily disputed. A more complete solution was offered in 1983 by Rabbi Joel Roth, and was also enacted to allow women rabbinic ordination. Roth noted that some decisors of old acknowledged that women may bless when performing positive time-bound commandments (from which they are exempted, and therefore unable to fulfill the obligation for others), especially citing the manner in which they assumed upon themselves the Counting of the Omer. He suggested that women voluntarily commit to pray thrice a day et cetera, and his responsa was adopted. Since then, female rabbis were ordained at JTS and other seminaries. In 1994, the movement accepted Judith Hauptman's principally egalitarian argument, according to which equal prayer obligations for women were never banned explicitly and it was only their inferior status that hindered participation. In 2006, openly gay rabbinic candidates were also to be admitted into the JTS. In 2012, a commitment ceremony for same-sex couples was devised, though not defined as \"kiddushin\". In 2016, the rabbis passed a resolution supporting transgender rights.\n\nConservative Judaism in the United States held a relatively strict policy regarding intermarriage. Propositions for acknowledging Jews by patrilineal descent, as in the Reform movement, were overwhelmingly dismissed. Unconverted spouses were largely barred from community membership and participation in rituals; clergy are banned from any involvement in interfaith marriage on pain of dismissal. However, as the rate of such unions rose dramatically, Conservative congregations began describing gentile family members as \"K'rov Yisrael\" (Kin of Israel) and be more open toward them. The Leadership Council of Conservative Judaism stated in 1995: \"we want to encourage the Jewish partner to maintain his/her Jewish identity, and raise their children as Jews.\"\n\nThe term \"Conservative Judaism\" was used, still generically and not yet as a specific label, already in the 1887 dedication speech of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America by Rabbi Alexander Kohut. By 1901, the JTS alumni formed the Rabbinical Assembly, of which all ordained Conservative clergy in the world are members. As of 2010, there were 1,648 rabbis in the RA. In 1913, the United Synagogue of America, renamed the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism in 1991, was founded as a congregational arm of the RA. The movement established the World Council of Conservative Synagogues in 1957. Offshoots outside North America mostly adopted the Hebrew name \"Masorti\", traditional', as did the Israeli Masorti Movement, founded in 1979, and the British Assembly of Masorti Synagogues, formed in 1985. The World Council eventually changed its name to \"Masorti Olami\", Masorti International. Besides the RA, the international Cantors Assembly supplies prayer leaders for congregations worldwide.\n\nThe United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, covering the United States and Canada, is by far the largest constituent of Masorti Olami. While most congregations defining themselves as \"Conservative\" are affiliated with the USCJ, some are independent. While accurate information of Canada is scant, it is estimated that some third of religiously affiliated Canadian Jews are Conservative. In 2008, the more traditional Canadian Council of Conservative Synagogues seceded from the parent organization. It numbered seven communities as of 2014. According to the Pew Research Center survey in 2013, 18 per cent of Jews in the United States identified with the movement, making it the second largest denomination in the country. Steven M. Cohen calculated that 962,000 U.S. Jewish adults considered themselves Conservative: 570,000 were registered congregants and further 392,000 were not members in a synagogue but identified. In addition, Cohen assumed in 2006 that 57,000 unconverted non-Jewish spouses were also registered (12 per cent of member households had one at the time): 40 per cent of members intermarry. Conservatives are also the most aged group: among those aged under 30 only 11 per cent identified as such, and there are three people over 55 for every single one aged between 35 and 44. As of November 2015, the USCJ had 580 member congregations (a sharp decline from 630 two years prior), 19 in Canada and the remainder in the United States. In 2011 the USCJ initiated a plan to reinvigorate the movement.\n\nBeyond North America, the movement has little presence – in 2011, Rela Mintz Geffen appraised there were only 100,000 members outside the U.S. (and the former figure including Canada). \"Masorti AmLat\", the MO branch in Latin America, is the largest with 35 communities in Argentina, 7 in Brazil, 6 in Chile and further 11 in the other countries. The British Assembly of Masorti Synagogues has 13 communities and estimates its membership at over 4,000. More than 20 communities are spread across Europe, and there are 3 in Australia and 2 in Africa. The Masorti Movement in Israel incorporates some 70 communities and prayer groups with several thousand full members. In addition, while Hungarian Neolog Judaism, with a few thousands of adherents and forty partially active synagogues, is not officially affiliated with Masorti Olami, Conservative Judaism regards it as a fraternal, \"non-Orthodox but halakhic\" movement.\nIn New York, the JTS serves as the movement's original seminary and legacy institution, along with the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies at the American Jewish University in Los Angeles; the Marshall T. Meyer Latin American Rabbinical Seminary (Spanish: \"Seminario Rabínico Latinoamericano Marshall T. Meyer\"), in Buenos Aires, Argentina; and the Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies in Jerusalem. A Conservative institution that does not grant rabbinic ordination but which runs along the lines of a traditional yeshiva is the Conservative Yeshiva, located in Jerusalem. The Neolog Budapest University of Jewish Studies also maintains connections with the denomination.\n\nThe current Chancellor of the JTS is Rabbi Arnold Eisen, in office since 2008. The current dean of the is Bradley Shavit Artson. The Committee on Jewish Law and Standards is chaired by Rabbi Elliot N. Dorff, serving since 2007. The Rabbinical Assembly is headed by President Rabbi William G. Gershon, as of 2016, and managed by executive vice-president Rabbi Julie Schonfeld. The USCJ is directed by CEO Rabbi Steven Wernick and President Margo Gold. In South America, Rabbi Abraham Skorka serves as Chancellor in the Seminario, and Daniel Cohn as president of Masorti AmLat. In Britain, the Masorti Assembly is chaired by Senior Rabbi Jonathan Wittenberg. In Israel, the Masorti movement is led by Rabbis Mauricio Balter and Dubi Haiyun, and chaired by Yizhar Hess.\n\nThe global youth movement is known as NOAM, an acronym for No'ar Masorti; its North American chapter is called the United Synagogue Youth. Marom Israel is the Masorti movement's organization for students and young adults, providing activities based on religious pluralism and Jewish content. The Women’s League for Conservative Judaism is also active in North America.\n\nThe USCJ maintains the Solomon Schechter Day Schools, comprising 76 day schools in 17 American states and 2 Canadian provinces serving Jewish children. Many other \"community day schools\" that are not affiliated with Schechter take a generally Conservative approach, but unlike these, generally have \"no barriers to enrollment based on the faith of the parents or on religious practices in the home\". During the first decade of the 21st century, a number of schools that were part of the Schechter network transformed themselves into non-affiliated community day schools. The USCJ also maintains the Camp Ramah system, where children and adolescents spend summers in an observant environment.\n\nThe rise of modern, centralized states in Europe by the early 19th century hearkened the end of Jewish judicial autonomy and social seclusion. Their communal corporate rights were abolished, and the process of emancipation and acculturation that followed quickly transformed the values and norms of the public. Estrangement and apathy toward Judaism were rampant. The process of communal, educational and civil reform could not be restricted from affecting the core tenets of the faith. The new academic, critical study of Judaism (\"Wissenschaft des Judentums\") soon became a source of controversy. Rabbis and scholars argued to what degree, if at all, its findings could be used to determine present conduct. The modernized Orthodox in Germany, like rabbis Isaac Bernays and Azriel Hildesheimer, were content to cautiously study it while stringently adhering to the sanctity of holy texts and refusing to grant \"Wissenschaft\" any say in religious matters. On the other extreme were Rabbi Abraham Geiger, who would emerge as the founding father of Reform Judaism, and his supporters. They opposed any limit on critical research or its practical application, laying more weight on the need for change than on continuity.\nThe Prague-born Rabbi Zecharias Frankel, appointed chief rabbi of the Kingdom of Saxony in 1836, gradually rose to become the leader of those who stood at the middle. Besides working for the civic betterment of local Jews and educational reform, he displayed keen interest in \"Wissenschaft\". But Frankel was always cautious and deeply reverent towards tradition, privately writing in 1836 that \"the means must be applied with such care and discretion... that forward progress will be reached unnoticed, and seem inconsequential to the average spectator.\" He soon found himself embroiled in the great disputes of the 1840s. In 1842, during the second Hamburg Temple controversy, he opposed the new Reform prayerbook, arguing the elimination of petitions for a future Return to Zion led by the Messiah was a violation of an ancient tenet. But he also opposed the ban placed on the tome by Rabbi Bernays, stating this was a primitive behaviour. In the same year, he and S.L. Rapoport were the only ones of nineteen respondents who negatively answered the Breslau community's enquiry on whether the deeply unorthodox Geiger could serve there. In 1843, Frankel clashed with the radical Reform rabbi Samuel Holdheim, who argued that the act of marriage in Judaism was a civic (\"memonot\") rather than sanctified (\"issurim\") matter and could be subject to the Law of the Land. In December 1843 Frankel launched the magazine \"Zeitschrift für die Religiösen Interessen des Judenthums\". In the preamble, he attempted to present his approach to the present plight: \"the further development of Judaism cannot be done through Reform that would lead to total dissipation... But must be involved in its study... pursued via scientific research, on a \"positive, historical\" basis.\" The term Positive-Historical became associated with him and his middle way. The \"Zeitschrift\" was, along the convictions of its publisher, neither dogmatically orthodox nor overly polemic, wholly opposing Biblical criticism and arguing for the antiquity of custom and practice.\n\nIn 1844, Geiger and like-minded allies arranged a conference in Braunschweig that was to have enough authority (since 1826, Rabbi Aaron Chorin called for the convocation of a new \"Sanhedrin\") to debate and enact thoroughgoing revisions. Frankel was willing to agree only to a meeting without any practical results, and refused the invitation. When the protocols, which contained many radical statements, were published, he denounced the assembly for \"applying the scalpel of criticism\" and favouring the spirit of the age over tradition. However, he later agreed to attend the second conference, held in Frankfurt am Main on 15 July 1845 – in spite of warnings from Rapoport, who cautioned that compromise with Geiger was impossible and he would only damage his reputation among the traditionalists. On the 16th, the issue of Hebrew in the liturgy arose. Most present were inclined to retain it, but with more German segments. A small majority adopted a resolution stating there were subjective, but no objective, imperatives to keep it as the language of service. Frankel then astounded his peers by vehemently protesting, stating it was a breach with the past and Hebrew was of dire importance and great sentimental value. The others immediately began quoting all passages in rabbinic literature allowing prayer in the vernacular. Frankel could not contend with the \"halakhic\" validity of their decision as he perceived it as a sign of profound differences between them. On the 17th he formally withdrew, publishing a lambasting critique of the procedures. \"Opponents of the conference, who feared he went to the other side,\" noted historian Michael A. Meyer, \"now felt reassured of his loyalty\".\nThe rabbi of Saxony had many sympathizers, who supported a similarly moderate approach and change only on the basis of the authority of the Talmud. When Geiger began preparing a third conference in Breslau, Hirsch Bär Fassel convinced Frankel to organize one of his own in protest. He invited colleagues to an assembly in Dresden, which was to be held on 21 October 1846. He announced that one measure he was willing to countenance was the possible abolition of the second day of festivals, though only based on a broad consensus and much deliberation. Attendants were to include Rapoport, Fassel, Adolf Jellinek, Leopold Löw, Michael Sachs, Abraham Kohn and others. However, the Dresden assembly soon drew heated Orthodox resistance, especially from Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger, and was postponed indefinitely.\n\nIn 1854, Frankel was appointed Chancellor in the new Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau, the first modern rabbinical seminary in Germany. His opponents on both flanks were incensed. Geiger and the Reform camp long accused him of theological ambiguity, hypocrisy and attachment to stagnant remnants, and now protested the \"medieval\" atmosphere in the seminary, which was mainly concerned with teaching Jewish Law. The hardline Orthodox Samson Raphael Hirsch, who fiercely opposed \"Wissenschaft\" and emphasized the divine origin of the entire \"halakhic\" system in the Theophany at Sinai, was deeply suspicious of his beliefs, use of science and constant assertions the Law was flexible and evolving.\n\nThe final schism between Frankel and the Orthodox occurred after the 1859 publication of his \"Darke ha-Mishna\" (Ways of the Mishna). He heaved praise on the Beatified Sages, presenting them as bold innovators, but not once affirmed the divinity of the Oral Torah. On the ordinances classified as Law given to Moses at Sinai, he quoted Asher ben Jehiel that stated several of those were only apocryphally dubbed as such; he applied the latter's conclusion to all, noting they were \"so evident \"as if\" given at Sinai\". Hirsch branded him a heretic, demanding he announce whether he believed that both the Oral and Written Torah were of celestial origin. Rabbis Benjamin Hirsch Auerbach, Solomon Klein and others published more complaisant tracts, but also requested an explanation. Rapoport marshaled to Frankel's aid, assuring that his words were merely reiterating ben Jehiel's and that he would soon release a statement that would belie Hirsch's accusations. But then the Chancellor of Breslau issued an ambiguous defence, writing his book was not concerned with theology and avoiding giving any clear answer. Now even Rapoport joined his critics.\nHirsch succeeded, severely tarnishing his rival's reputation among most concerned. Along with fellow Orthodox Rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer, he launched a protracted public campaign through the 1860s. They ceaselessly stressed the chasm between an Orthodox understanding of \"halakha\" as derived and revealed, applied differently to different circumstances and subject to human judgement and possibly error, yet unchanging and divine in principle – as opposed to an evolutionary, historicist and non-dogmatic approach in which past authorities were not just elaborating but consciously innovating, as taught by Frankel. Hildesheimer often repeated that this issue utterly overshadowed any specific technical argument with the Breslau School (the students of which were often more lenient on matters of headcovering for women, Chalav Yisrael and other issues). He was concerned that Jewish public opinion perceived no practical difference between them; though he cared to distinguish the observant acolytes of Frankel from the Reform camp, he noted in his diary: \"how meager is the principal difference between the Breslau School, who don silk gloves at their work, and Geiger who wields a sledgehammer.\" In 1863, when Breslau faculty member Heinrich Graetz published an article where he appeared to doubt the Messianic belief, Hildesheimer immediately seized upon the occasion to prove once more the dogmatic, rather than practical, divide. He denounced Graetz as a heretic. \n\nThe Positive-Historical School was influential, but never institutionalized itself as thoroughly as its opponents. Apart from the many graduates of Breslau, Isaac Noah Mannheimer, Adolf Jellinek and Rabbi Moritz Güdemann led the central congregation in Vienna along a similar path. In Jellinek's local seminary, Meir Friedmann and Isaac Hirsch Weiss followed Frankel's moderate approach to critical research. The rabbinate of the liberal Neolog public in Hungary, which formally separated from the Orthodox, was also permeated with the \"Breslsu spirit\". Many of its members studied there, and its Jewish Theological Seminary of Budapest was modeled after it, though the assimilationist congregants cared little for rabbinic opinion. In Germany itself, Breslau alumni founded in 1868 a short-lived society, the Jüdisch-Theologische Verein. It was dissolved within a year, boycotted by both Reform and Orthodox. Michael Sachs led the Berlin congregation in a very conservative style, eventually resigning when an organ was introduced in services. Manuel Joël, another of the Frankelist party, succeeded Geiger in Breslau. He maintained his predecessor's truncated German translation of the liturgy for the sake of compromise, but returned the full Hebrew text.\n\nThe Breslau Seminary and the Reform Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums maintained very different approaches; but on the communal level, the former's alumni failure to organize or articulate a coherent agenda, coupled with the declining prestige of Breslau and the conservatism of the Hochschule's alumni – a necessity in heterogeneous communities which remained unified, especially after the Orthodox gained the right to secede in 1876 – imposed a rather uniform and mild character on what was known in Germany as \"Liberal Judaism\". In 1909, 63 rabbis associated with Breslau approach founded the Freie jüdische Vereinigung, another brief attempt at institutionalization, but it too failed soon. Only in 1925 did the Religiöse Mittelpartei für Frieden und Einheit succeed in driving the same agenda. It won several seats in communal elections, but was small and of little influence.\n\nJewish immigration to the United States bred an amalgam of loose communities, lacking strong tradition or stable structures. In this free-spirited environment, a multitude of forces was at work. As early as 1866, Rabbi Jonas Bondi of New York wrote that a Judaism of the \"golden middleway, which was termed Orthodox by the left and heterodox or reformer by the right\" developed in the new country. The rapid ascendancy of Reform Judaism by the 1880s left few who opposed it: merely a handful of congregations and ministers remained outside the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. These included Sabato Morais and Rabbi Henry Pereira Mendes of the elitist Sephardi congregations, along with rabbis Bernard Drachman (ordained at Breslau, though he regarded himself as Orthodox) and Henry Schneeberger.\n\nWhile spearheaded by radical and principled Reformers like Rabbi Kaufmann Kohler, the UAHC was also home to more conservative elements. President Isaac Meyer Wise, a pragmatist intent on compromise, hoped to forge a broad consensus that would turn a moderate version of Reform to dominant in America. He kept the dietary laws at home and attempted to assuage traditionalists. On 11 July 1883, apparently due to negligence by the Jewish caterer, non-kosher dishes were served to UAHC rabbis in Wise's presence. Known to posterity as the \"trefa banquet\", it purportedly made some guests abandon the hall in disgust, but little is factually known about the incident. In 1885, the traditionalist forces were bolstered upon the arrival of Rabbi Alexander Kohut, an adherent of Frankel. He publicly excoriated Reform for disdaining ritual and received forms, triggering a heated polemic with Kohler. The debate was one of the main factors which motivated the latter to compose the Pittsburgh Platform, which unambiguously declared the principles of Reform Judaism: \"to-day we accept as binding only the moral laws, and maintain only such ceremonies as elevate and sanctify our lives.\"\n\nThe explicit wording alienated a handful of conservative UAHC ministers: Henry Hochheimer, Frederick de Sola Mendes, Aaron Wise, Marcus Jastrow, and Benjamin Szold. They joined Kohut, Morais and the others in seeking to establish a traditional rabbinic seminary that would serve as a counterweight to Hebrew Union College. In 1886, they founded the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York City. Kohut, professor of Talmud who held to the Positive-Historical ideal, was the main educational influence in the early years, prominent among the founders who encompassed the entire spectrum from progressive Orthodox to the brink of Reform; to describe what the seminary intended to espouse, he used the term \"Conservative Judaism\", which had no independent meaning at the time and was only in relation to Reform. In 1898, Pereira Mendes, Schneeberger and Drachman also founded the Orthodox Union, which maintained close ties with the seminary.\n\nThe JTS was a small, fledgling institution with financial difficulties, and was ordaining merely a rabbi per year. But soon after Chancellor Morais' death in 1897, its fortunes turned. Since 1881, a wave of Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe was inundating the country – by 1920, 2.5 million of them had arrived, increasing American Jewry tenfold. They came from regions where civil equality or emancipation were never granted, while acculturation and modernization made little headway. Whether devout or irreligious, they mostly retained strong traditional sentiments in matters of faith, accustomed to old-style rabbinate; the hardline Agudas HaRabbanim, founded by emigrant clergy, opposed secular education or vernacular sermons, and its members spoke almost only Yiddish. The Eastern Europeans were alienated by the local Jews, who were all assimilated in comparison, and especially aghast by the mores of Reform. The need to find a religious framework that would both accommodate and Americanize them motivated Jacob Schiff and other rich philanthropists, all Reform and of German descent, to donate $500,000 to the JTS. The contribution was solicited by Professor Cyrus Adler. It was conditioned on the appointment of Solomon Schechter as Chancellor. In 1901, the Rabbinical Assembly was established as the fraternity of JTS alumni.\nSchechter arrived in 1902, and at once reorganized the faculty, dismissing both Pereira Mendes and Drachman for lack of academic merit. Under his aegis, the institute began to draw famous scholars, becoming a center of learning on par with HUC. Schechter was both traditional in sentiment and quite unorthodox in conviction. He maintained that theology was of little importance and it was practice that must be preserved. He aspired to solicit unity in American Judaism, denouncing sectarianism and not perceiving himself as leading a new denomination: \"not to create a new party, but to consolidate an old one\". The need to raise funds convinced him that a congregational arm for the Rabbinical Assembly and the JTS was required. On 23 February 1913, he founded the United Synagogue of America (since 1991: United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism), which then consisted of 22 communities. He and Mendes first came to major disagreement; Schechter insisted that any alumnus could be appointed to the USoA's managerial board, and not just to serve as communal rabbi, including several the latter did not consider sufficiently devout, or who tolerated mixed seating in their synagogues (though some of those he still regarded as Orthodox). Mendes, president of the Orthodox Union, therefore refused to join. He began to distinguish between the \"Modern Orthodoxy\" of himself and his peers in the OU, and \"Conservatives\" who tolerated what was beyond the pale for him. However, this first sign of institutionalization and separation was far from conclusive. Mendes himself could not clearly differentiate between the two groups, and many he viewed as Orthodox were members of the USoA. The epithets \"Conservative\" and \"Orthodox\" remained interchangeable for decades to come. JTS graduates served in OU congregations; many students of the Orthodox Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary and members of the OU's Rabbinical Council of America, or RCA, attended it. In 1926, RIETS and the JTS even negotiated a possible merger, though it was never materialized. Upon Schechter's death in 1915, the first generation of his disciples kept his non-sectarian legacy of striving for a united, traditional American Judaism. He was replaced by Cyrus Adler.\nThe USoA grew rapidly as the Eastern European immigrant population slowly integrated. In 1923 it already had 150 affiliated communities, and 229 before 1930. Synagogues offered a more modernized ritual: English sermons, choir singing, late Friday evening services which tacitly acknowledging that most had to work until after the Sabbath began, and often mixed-gender seating. Men and women sat separately with no partition, and some houses of prayer already introduced family pews. Motivated by popular pressure and frowned upon by both RA and seminary faculty – in its own synagogue, the institute maintained a partition until 1983 – this was becoming common among the OU as well. As both social conditions and apathy turned American Jews away from tradition (barely 20 per cent were attending prayers weekly), a young professor named Mordecai Kaplan promoted the idea of transforming the synagogue into a community center, a \"Shul with a Pool\", a policy which indeed stymied the tide somewhat.\nIn 1927, the RA also established its own Committee of Jewish Law, entrusted with determining \"halakhic\" issues. Consisting of seven members, it was chaired by the traditionalist Rabbi Louis Ginzberg, who already distinguished himself in 1922, drafting a responsa that allowed to use grape juice rather than fermented wine for \"Kiddush\" on the background of Prohibition. Kaplan himself, who rose to become an influential and popular figure within the JTS, concluded that his fellow rabbis' ambiguity in matters of belief and the contradiction between full observance and critical study were untenable and hypocritical. He formulated his own approach of Judaism as a Civilization, rejecting the concept of Revelation and any supernatural belief in favour of a cultural-ethnic perception. While valuing received mores, he eventually suggested giving the past \"a vote, not a veto\". Though popular among students, Kaplan's nascent Reconstructionism was opposed by the new traditionalist Chancellor Louis Finkelstein, appointed in 1940, and a large majority among the faculty.\n\nTensions within the JTS and RA grew. The Committee of Jewish Law consisted mainly of scholars who had little field experience, almost solely from the seminary's Talmudic department. They were greatly concerned with \"halakhic\" licitness and indifferent to the pressures exerted on the pulpit rabbis, who had to contend with an Americanized public which cared little for such considerations or for tradition in general. In 1935, the RA almost adopted a groundbreaking motion: Rabbi Louis Epstein offered a solution to the agunah predicament, a clause that would have had husbands appoint wives as their proxies to issue divorce. It was repealed under pressure from the Orthodox Union. As late as 1947, CJL Chair Rabbi Boaz Cohen, himself a historicist who argued that the Law evolved much through time, rebuked pulpit clergy who requested lenient or radical rulings, stating he and his peers were content to \"progress in inches... Free setting up of new premises and the introduction of novel categories of ritual upon the basis of pure reason and thinking would be perilous, if not fatal, to the principles and continuity of Jewish Law.\"\n\nThe boundaries between Orthodox and Conservative Judaism in America were institutionalized only in the aftermath of World War II. The 1940s saw the younger generation of JTS graduates less patient with the prudence of the CJL and Talmud faculty in face of popular demand. Kaplan's Reconstructionism, while its fully committed partisans were few, had much influence. The majority among recent alumni eschewed the epithet \"Orthodox\" and tended to employ \"Conservative\" exclusively. Succeeding Schechter's direct disciples who headed the RA, JTS and United Synagogue in the interwar period, a new strata of activist leaders was rising. Rabbi Robert Gordis, RA president in 1944–1946, represented the junior members in advocating more flexibility; Rabbi Jacob Agus, a RIETS graduate who joined the body only in 1945, clamored that \"we need a law making body, not a law interpreting committee.\" Agus argued that the breach between the Jewish public and tradition was too wide to be bridged conventionally, and that the RA would always remain inferior to the Orthodox as long as it retained its policy of merely adopting lenient precedents in rabbinic literature. He offered to extensively apply the tool of \"takkanah\", rabbinic ordinance.\nIn 1946, a committee chaired by Gordis issued the \"Sabbath and Festival Prayerbook\", the first clearly Conservative liturgy: references to the sacrificial cult were in the past tense instead of a petition for restoration, and it rephrased blessings such as \"who hast made me according to thy will\" for women to \"who hast made me a woman\". During the movement's national conference in Chicago, held 13–17 May 1948, the pulpit rabbis in the RA gained the upper hand. Spurned by Gordis, Agus and fellow leaders, They voted to reorganize the CJL into a Committee of Jewish Law and Standards, enfranchised to issue \"takkanot\" by a majority. Membership was conditioned on having experience as a congregational rabbi, and unseasoned JTS faculty were thus denied entrance. While the RA was asserting a Conservative distinctive identity, the seminary remained more cautious. Finkelstein opposed sectarianism and preferred the neutral epithet \"traditional\", later commenting that \"Conservative Judaism is a gimmick to get Jews back to real Judaism\". He and the very right-wing Talmud professor Saul Lieberman, who maintained ties with the Orthodox while also viewing them as obstructionist and ossified, dominated the JTS, providing a counterweight to the liberals in the Assembly. Kaplan, meanwhile, spent more time on consolidating his Society for Advancement of Judaism. Abraham Joshua Heschel, who espoused a mysticist understanding of Jewish religion, also became an important figure among the faculty.\nThe CJLS now proceeded to demonstrate its independence. Sabbath was widely desecrated by a large majority of Jews, and the board believed arrival at synagogues should be encouraged. They therefore enacted an ordinance that allowed driving on the Sabbath (for worship alone) and the use of electricity. The driving responsum was later severely criticized by Conservative rabbis, and was charged with imparting the movement was overly keen to condone the laxity of congregants. It also signified the final break with the Orthodox, who were themselves being bolstered by more strictly observant immigrants from Europe. In 1954, the RCA reverted its 1948 ruling that allowed the use of microphones on Sabbath and festivals and declared that praying without a partition between sexes was banned. Though enforced slowly — in 1997, there were still seven OU congregations with no physical barrier, and so-called \"Conservadox\" remain extant — these two attributes became a demarcation line between Orthodox and Conservative synagogues. RA converts were denied ablution in Orthodox ritual baths, and rabbis from one denomination would gradually cease serving in the other's communities.\n\nRather than a force within American Judaism, the JTS-centered movement emerged as a third denomination. The historicist and critical approach to \"halakha\", as well as other features, were emphasized by leaders eager to demonstrate their uniqueness. In their efforts to solidify a coherent identity, Conservative thinkers like Mordecai Waxman in his 1957 \"Tradition and Change\", ventured beyond Schechter's deem conceptions to Rabbi Zecharias Frankel and Breslau, presenting themselves as its direct inheritors via Alexander Kohut and others. The CJLS continued to issue groundbreaking ordinances and rulings.\n\nThe postwar decades were a time of immense growth for the Conservative movement. Most of the 500,000 decommissioned Jewish GI's left the densely populated immigrant neighbourhoods of the East Coast, moving to suburbia. They were Americanized but still retained traditional sentiments, and Reform Judaism was too radical for most. The United Synagogue of America offered Jewish education for children and a familiar religious environment which was also comfortable and not strict. It expanded from 350 communities by 1945 to 832 by 1971, becoming the largest denomination, with some 350,000 member households (1.5 million people) at synagogues and over 40 per cent of American Jewry identifying with it in polls, adding an estimated million more non-registered supporters.\n\nAlready in a 1955 study, Marshall Sklare defined Conservative Judaism as the quintessential American Jewish movement, but recognized the gap between laity and clergy, noting \"rabbis now recognize that they are not making decisions or writing responsa, but merely taking a poll of their membership.\" Most congregants, commented Edward S. Shapiro, were \"Conservative Jews because their rabbi kept kosher and the Sabbath... Not because of their religious behavior.\" The movement established its presence outside the U.S. and Canada: In 1962, the young Rabbi Marshall Meyer founded the Seminario Rabinico Latinoamericano in Buenos Aires, which would serve as the basis for Conservative expansion in South America. In 1979, four communities formed the Israel Masorti Movement. Rabbi Louis Jacobs, dismissed in 1964 from the British Orthodox rabbinate on the charge of heresy after espousing a non-literal understanding of the Torah, joined with the Conservatives and founded his country's first Masorti community. The new branches were all united within the World Council of Synagogues, later to be named Masorti Olami.\n\nThe denomination peaked in numbers in the 1970s. During that decade, the tensions between the various elements within it intensified. The right wing, conservative in \"halakhic\" matters and often adhering to a verbal understanding of revelation, was dismayed by the failure to bolster observance among the laity and the resurgence of Orthodoxy. The left was influenced by the Reconstructionists, who formed their own seminary in 1968 and were slowly coalescing, as well as the growing appeal of Reform, which turned more traditional and threatened to sway congregants. While the rightists opposed further modifications, their peers demanded them. The Chavurah movement, consisting of nonaligned prayer quorums of young (and frequently, Conservative-raised) worshipers who sought a more intense religious experience, also weakened congregations. In 1972, the liberal wing gained an influential position with the appointment of Gerson D. Cohen as JTS Chancellor. During the same year, after Reform began to ordain female rabbis, a strong lobby rose to advocate the same. The CJLS rapidly enacted an ordinance which allowed women to be tallied for a \"minyan\", and by 1976 the percentage of synagogues allowing them to bless during the reading of the Torah grew from 7 per cent to 50 per cent. In 1979, ignoring the denominational leadership, Beth Israel Congregation of Chester County accepted the RRC-ordained Rabbi Linda Joy Holtzman. Pressures to allow women to assume rabbinical positions was mounting from the congregational level, though the RA agreed to delay any action until the JTS scholars would concur.\n\nFemale ordination was a matter of great friction until 1983, when Rabbi Joel Roth devised a solution that entailed women voluntarily accepting the obligation to pray regularly. The leadership passed it not by scholarly consensus but via a popular vote of all JTS faculty, including non-specialists. Two years later, the first JTS-ordained female rabbi, Amy Eilberg, was admitted into the RA. David Weiss Halivni, professor of the Talmud faculty, claimed that Roth's method must have required waiting until a considerable number of women did prove sufficient commitment. He and his sympathizers regarded the vote as belying any claim to \"halakhic\" integrity. They formed the Union for Traditional Conservative Judaism in 1985, a right-wing lobby which numbered some 10,000 supporters from the Conservative observant elite. The UTJC withdrew from the denomination and erased the word \"Conservative\" in 1990, attempting to merge with moderate Orthodox organizations.\n\nIn the very same year, the Reconstructionist also seceded fully, joining the World Union for Progressive Judaism under observer status. The double defection narrowed the movement's spectrum of opinions, at a time when large swaths of congregants were abandoning in favour of Reform, which was more tolerant of intermarriage. RA leaders were engaged in introspection through the later 1980s, resulting in the 1988 \"Emet ve-Emunah\" platform, while Reform slowly bypassed them and became the largest denomination.\n\nAfter the issue of egalitarianism for women subsided, LGBT acceptance replaced it as the main source of contention between the declining right-wing wing and the liberal majority. A first attempt was rebuffed in 1992 by a harsh responsum written by Roth. The retirement of Chancellor Ismar Schorsch, a staunch opponent, allowed the CJLS to endorse a motion which still banned anal intercourse but not any other physical contact, and allowed the ordination of openly LGBT rabbis, in 2006. Roth and three other supporters resigned from the panel in protest, claiming the responsum was not valid; Masorti affiliates in South America, Israel and Hungary objected severely. The Seminario is yet to accept the resolution, while several Canadian congregations seceded from the United Synagogue in 2008 to form an independent union in protest of the slide to the left. Since the 2013 Pew survey, which assessed that only 18 per cent of American Jews identify with it, Conservative leadership is engaged in attempting to solve the denomination's demographic crisis.\n\n\n"}

These fasting periods are exceeded by no other Christian community except the Orthodox Tewahedo. Out of the 365 days of the year, Copts often fast between 180 to 210 days.\n\nThere are spiritual, symbolic, and even practical reasons for fasting. In the fall from Paradise man became possessed of a carnal nature; he adopted carnal practices. Through fasting, the Orthodox Christians attempt to recapture Paradise in their lives by refraining from those carnal practices. In general, Coptic fasting means adhering to a vegan diet, thus abstaining from meat, fish, eggs, dairy, and other animal products.\n\nThere are those who see fasting as an exercise in self-denial and Christian obedience that serves to rid the believer of his or her \"passions\" (what most modern people would call \"addictions\"). These often low-intensity and hard-to-detect addictions to food, television or other entertainments, sex, or any kind of self-absorbed pleasure-seeking are seen as some of the most significant obstacles for man seeking closeness to God. Through struggling with fasting, the believer comes face to face with the reality of his condition - the starting point for genuine repentance.\n\nAll Coptic Christians are expected to fast following a prescribed set of guidelines. Dispensation is however granted under special circumstances, such as pregnancy and sickness.\n\nThe time and type of fast is generally uniform in Oriental Orthodoxy. The times of fasting are dependent on the ecclesiastical calendar. In the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, this calendar is the Coptic calendar, which corresponds largely to the calendars of other Christian denominations. Observance of the fasting periods is very strict in the Coptic community.\n\nThe major fasting periods during the ecclesiastical calendar year are:\n\nThe \"Nativity Fast\" (Advent or Winter Lent) is the 40 days preceding the Nativity of Jesus (Christmas) on 29 Koiak (January 7, which also falls on 28 Koiak in leap years). The 40 days correspond to the 40 days that the Moses fasted on the mountain before receiving the Ten Commandments from God, which were at that time considered the word of God to his people. Thus, with Christ being the Word of God, the Christians fast those 40 days in preparation of receiving the Word of God in flesh at the Feast of the Nativity. \n\nAn additional 3 days were added at the beginning of the 40 days of Advent during the 10th century to commemorate the three days that Copts fasted before God awarded them the miracle of moving the Mokattam, which lies within a suburb of Cairo, on the hands of Simon the Tanner during the rule of the Fatimid caliph al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah. Thus the fast of Advent begins on 16 Hathor (November 25, which also falls on 15 Hathor in leap years). The three added days are considered a separate fast rather than part of the fast of Advent.\n\nIt commemorates the three days that the people of Nineveh fasted in repentance after Jonah's call for them to repent. For Christians, these three days are a direct parallel of and a prophecy about the three days that Christ spent in the tomb, just like the three days Jonah spent in the belly of the fish. The fast of Nineveh begins on a Monday, two weeks before the Monday that marks the beginning of Great Lent.\n\nThis fast was borrowed from Syriac Christianity, as one of the Patriarchs of Alexandria of Syriac descent decided to adapt it for the Church of Alexandria.\n\n\"Great Lent\" consists of eight weeks (55 days), which correspond to the 40 days that Christ fasted on the mountain. With the remaining fifteen days for a week of preparation, the Holy Week which is the last week of fasting, and Lazuras Saturday. It precedes Palm Sunday, and the Holy Week, which precede Easter. The seven days of the Holy Week is also a period of rigorous fasting.\n\nThere are an additional seven days of fasting before the beginning of the Great Lent, which serve as a preparatory period. Often called \"Pre-Lenten Fast\" or \"Preparatory Week\", and also what was explained before.\n\nThis is the week preceding Easter, which climaxes with the Crucifixion on Good Friday and ends with the joyous Easter. \n\nIt is to be noted that since they are not related to each other dogmatically, in early Christianity, the Great Lent fast and the Holy Week fast were fasted separately. It was later in Church history that the Fathers of the Church saw it as spiritually beneficial to join them concurrently, and later added the Preparatory week to enable the faithful to prepare themselves spiritually and bodily to experience the benefits of the fasts.\n\nThe Apostles' Fast varies in length from two to six weeks (15 to 49 days). It begins on the Monday following the Sunday of Pentecost and extends to the feast day of Saint Peter and Paul the Apostle on 5 Epip (July 12). This fasting period commemorates the struggles of the Apostles to preach Christianity to the world. Its length varies yearly depending on the date of Easter, which in turn determines the date of Pentecost. The people who are fasting are allowed to eat vegan food and fish.\n\nThis fast is fifteen days long and precedes the feast of the Dormition of the Mother of God. This fasting period is fasted to ask for the intercessions of Mary, mother of Jesus. It begins on 1 Mesori (August 7) and ends on 16 Mesori (August 22).\n\nCoptic Christians also fast every Wednesday in commemoration of Christ's betrayal by Judas Iscariot, and every Friday in commemoration of his crucifixion. Exceptions are the Wednesdays and Fridays between Easter and Pentecost (the 50-day period of joy during which fasting is not permitted) and any day whereon a Major Feast falls.\n\nThe day or days preceding the Feast of the Nativity and the Feast of Theophany is/are a fast day(s) in preparation for the Feast day. (See the rules for the fasting days of the Paramon Fasts)\n\nAccording to the Coptic tradition of fasting periods, the diet is mainly vegan, cooked with either oil or water. No animal products (meat, poultry, fish, milk, eggs, butter, etc.) are allowed.\n\nIt is also to be noted that fish is permissible during the Advent fast, the Apostles' Fast, and the fast of the Dormition of Mary except on Wednesdays and Fridays of these fasts. Lent and the Holy Week fasts are stricter than the other fasts in their discipline. Those who wish to take a vow of strict discipline for the fast of Mary may also do so.\n\nA strict abstinence period, where no food or drink whatsoever may be taken, is encouraged for those who can endure it. The original tradition of the Church is for this period of abstinence to begin at midnight and last through sunset. Those who cannot endure this length of fast are still encouraged to strictly abstain from all types of food and drink between midnight and a certain time in the day, depending on each individual's strength and spiritual needs (this is usually based on the suggestion of the person's father of confession). For many parishioners, fasting is more likely to end at noon (the hour when Christ was placed on the Cross) or three o'clock on the afternoon (the hour when Christ died on the Cross). Strict abstinence is also expected to be kept on Great Friday between midnight and the end of the Great Friday prayers (usually around 6pm).\n\n\nThere are 7 weeks during the year where there is no fasting even on Wednesday and Friday. These are the 7 weeks between Easter and Pentecost. These 7 weeks are fast-free because this period is a period of joy for Christians in celebration of the Resurrection of Christ.\n\nCoptic Orthodox Christians who expect to receive communion of the Eucharist on a certain day do not eat or drink at all during the nine hours preceding the partaking of the communion or from midnight of the previous night, whichever is longer.\n\nStrict fasting with abstinence is canonically forbidden on Saturdays and Sundays due to the festal character of the Sabbath and Resurrectional observances respectively. Holy (Bright) Saturday is the only Saturday of the year where a strict fast is kept.\n\nIt is considered a greater sin to advertise one's fasting than to not participate in the fast. Fasting is a purely personal communication between the Orthodox Christian and God, and in fact has no place whatsoever in the public life of the Coptic Orthodox Church.\n\nThese strict fasting rules are usually relaxed by priests on an individual basis to accommodate for illness or weakness. Abstinence from sexual intercourse is also encouraged but not mandatory, and largely depends on the decision of each couple. The Coptic Orthodox fasting periods are designed to foster spiritual development and focus on liturgical practices.\n\nFasting is not generally viewed as a hardship, but rather a privilege and joy in preparing for the coming “Feast Day”.\n\n"}

He is the bassist and lead vocalist for the punk rock band NOFX and the bassist for the punk rock supergroup cover band Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. Fat Mike started out with his first band False Alarm in 1982. He recorded the song Self Destruction that was on the False Alarm album, Buspar For Bedbug. Mike played in False Alarm until 1983. False Alarm went on to make 3 records and record with Cheetah Chrome of the Dead Boys. Dee Dee Ramone of the Ramones wrote and recorded the song False Alarm for the band with Paul Kostabi False Alarm's guitar player.\n\nWhile attending Beverly Hills High School, Mike began his musical career with the band False Alarm. After the band split up in 1983, he met Eric Melvin and Erik Sandin and formed the original line-up of NOFX. He has also appeared as a guest-vocalist on a number of other bands' tracks including \"Peter Brady\" on Screeching Weasel's 1993 album, \"Anthem for a New Tomorrow.\" Other appearances include \"Beware\" by Randy, \"Mr. Coffee\" and \"Lazy\" by Lagwagon, and can be heard heckling and requesting \"Free Bird\" at the end of the Lunachicks song, \"Missed It,\" off their 1996 album, \"Pretty Ugly,\" which he also produced. He also appears as a guest vocalist on the Dropkick Murphys single \"Going Out In Style\". Mike is the owner and founder of Fat Wreck Chords, one of the biggest independent labels in North America.\n\nMike recorded the \"Cokie the Clown\" EP with NOFX, playing Cokie on both the cover of the EP and the music video for the title-track, \"Cokie the Clown\". In the video, Mike dresses as Cokie and puts white powder into his squirting flower, which in the song he describes as \"my own special blend of ex, coke, and K\". Cokie then walks around Chicago squirting powder in pedestrians' faces, as chronicled in the song itself. The video was shot during the punk music festival Riot Fest.\n\nFat Mike has made several appearances as Cokie the Clown, but one of his most memorable was at Emo's, a popular nightclub in Austin on March 20, 2010 at the South by Southwest festival. He recounted several graphic and disturbing stories about his life, and played several songs both previously released and unreleased. He also tricked several members of the audience into drinking tequila, before showing them a video of himself filling a partially full bottle of tequila to the top with urine to shocked reactions. The stunt was later revealed as a joke on NOFX's website, which showed Fat Mike switching out the urine bottle for an untainted one before making audience members drink it. Mike has since been banned from Emo's.\n\nIn 2015 Mike premiered a Broadway musical titled \"Home Street Home,\" which he co-wrote with Soma Snakeoil and Jeff Marx.\n\nFat Mike founded the website Punkvoter.com in 2004 in an effort to mobilize the punk community to vote George W. Bush out of office in that year's presidential election. He had never been very active in politics before then, admitting that he never even voted until 2000. However, he was driven into political activism because of Bush, whom he viewed as \"the most ridiculous president in the history of presidents.\" Punkvoter.com targeted 18-to-25-year-old punk fans and other disenfranchised young people and encouraged them to vote Bush out of office. At its peak, the site was getting 15 million hits a day and ultimately raised over $1 million. Speculation has arose over the long-term viability, and genuine nature of what Punkvoter.com was all about. Many musicians, some very closely associated to Burkett, have claimed that Burkett's real goal with Punkvoter.com was to just sell t-shirts, cd's, and false hope to young, misguided, uneducated, lazy American citizens that Burkett knew he could manipulate given his status as a prominent figure in the Punk Rock community. Chris Hannah of Canadian Prog-Punk band Propagandhi, in regards to the Punkvoter.com movement, was quoted as saying \"What were my criticisms against the punk-voter movement? Well, for starters, where is it? Most real, political movements don't just fizzle out after the group's greedy, war-mongering candidate loses an election.\" \n\nAs with Punkvoter.com, Mike organized the Rock Against Bush campaign to mobilize punk fans and musicians against George W. Bush. Fat Mike's band NOFX, along with many other well-known punk artists including Alkaline Trio, Green Day and Jello Biafra, embarked on a tour of American college campuses in the months leading up to the 2004 presidential election. Mike hoped to go beyond just protest and actually educate kids about why they should vote against Bush. At the shows, he would hand out free DVDs of \"Uncovered: The Whole Truth About The Iraq War\", a documentary that questions the Bush administration's motives in the Middle East.\nTo coincide with the tour, Mike released two Rock Against Bush compilation albums on Fat Wreck Chords featuring new music from some of the bands on the label. The albums sold over 650,000 copies and proceeds helped fund the tour, as well as going toward magazine ads and billboards in swing states.\n\nBurkett lives in San Francisco, California. He attended college at San Francisco State University and graduated in 1990 with a bachelor's degree in Social Science and a minor in Human Sexuality. According to the book \"NOFX The Hepatitis Bathtub and Other Stories\", Burkett has said that he received the moniker \"Fat Mike\" from \"one of the guys from [the band] Subculture\". He is of Jewish heritage, but is an atheist.\n\nHe and his wife Erin divorced in 2010 after 18 years of marriage. They have a daughter named Darla. In October 2009, Mike appeared in the documentary \"The Other F Word\", an analysis of punk rock fatherhood.\n\nFat Mike formerly owned a gastropub-style restaurant in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY called Thistle Hill Tavern. He has been into BDSM for years: he has had a dungeon in his house. Fat Mike has numerous tattoos, including one on his left arm that features a golfing dominatrix and her bound caddy.\n\nFat Mike announced his engagement to adult film actress Soma Snakeoil on January 28, 2014. Mike and Soma separated August 2017.\n\nHe has been vocal about assisting his terminally ill mother's death, describing the episode in a song called \"La Pieta\" which featured in NOFX's audiobook version of The Hepatitis Bathtub and Other Stories.\n\nOn November 5, 2014 at a NOFX show in Sydney, Australia, Fat Mike had complained about a neck injury and had asked the audience not to throw objects at him and grab him while on stage as it caused him pain. While playing the song \"Linoleum\", a fan climbed onstage and put his arm around Mike's neck, to which Mike responded by elbowing him to the ground and then kicking him in the face. The fan suffered some bruising on his face but had no major injuries. Later, Fat Mike and the fan both apologized via Twitter. A video was released of Mike giving the fan a beer and custom T-shirt, and letting him kick him as an apology.\n"}

It is considered one of the masterpieces of classic Basque prose and literature altogether. \n\nIt was published at Bordeaux in 1643 under the patronage of Bertrand D'Etchauz, Basque archbishop of Tours (1617-1641). The book was written after the period of the harrowing \"witch\" persecution (Pierre de Lancre's intervention in Labourd). The book, written in an instructive tone, dwells on the idea of the harm and misfortunes issued from putting off one's religious duties, on the grounds that men need to turn to Christ with no delay. \n\nWhile the title's tagline reads «divided into two parts», only the existence of one book has been attested. Basque scholar Piarres Lafitte claimed that both parts had been merged into one. By contrast, former president of the Basque Language Academy Luis Villasante held that the second part had been actually lost for ever. Gero shows no mysticism, but the book intends to explain and prove an ascetic idea, arranged as if it was to be addressed from the pulpit to the parishioners.\n\nIts accomplished, elaborate language in classic Lapurdian dialect turned it into a writing model for later writers from Labourd.\n\n\n"}

By the 20th century Königsberg had one of the larger Jewish communities within the German Reich. The city's Jewish community was eliminated by emigration and then The Holocaust during World War II.\n\nThe first Jews in Königsberg, Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia) were the doctors Isaak May (1538) and Michel Abraham (1541) at the court of Albert, Duke of Prussia. In 1680 or 1682 Frederick William, the Great Elector, allowed the city's Jewish residents to rent space for prayer at the Eulenburgsches Haus (later Hotel Deutsches Haus) on Burgfreiheit's Kehrwiederstraße (later Theaterstraße). Most were merchants from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nA permanent Jewish community began to develop in Königsberg only by 1704, when a Jewish cemetery was designated. Jewish students were first admitted to the University of Königsberg in 1712.\n\nIn 1750 Frederick II of Prussia issued an edict which classified Jews in Prussia into several categories. The main division was between so-called \"tolerated Jews\" (\"geduldete Juden\") who could remain in Prussia, and \"not tolerated Jews\" who were required to leave upon reaching adulthood, as well as \"protected Jews\" (\"Schutz-Juden\") . The \"protected Jews\", whose number was initially limited to a total of 203 families in all of Brandenburg-Prussia, were allowed to reside in a city but had no right of mobility. Non-protected \"tolerated Jews\", who comprised the vast majority of Jewish inhabitants of the Prussian kingdom, were not allowed to permanently settle in Prussia, were not allowed to purchase land or houses or to engage in any commercial or economic activity, and generally were not allowed to live in the cities unless they served as employees or clients of the \"protected Jews\". As a result, the Jewish population of Königsberg in the 18th century was fairly low, although this changed as the restrictions became relaxed over the course of the 19th century. In 1753 Frederick II allowed the city's Jews to build a Hasidic synagogue on Vordere Vorstadt's Schnürlingsdamm, which was completed in 1756. Georg David Kypke served as its government inspector. In 1756 there were 29 families of \"protected Jews\" in Königsberg, which increased to 57 by 1789. The total number of Jewish inhabitants was less than 500 in the middle of the 18th century, and around 800 by the end of it, out of a total population of almost 60,000 people.\n\nThe city counted 300 Jewish residents in 1756, 900 residents in 1800, and 1,027 in 1817, with much of the increase coming from the Russian Empire. Although the first synagogue, the Alte Synagoge, burned down in 1811, it was rebuilt on nearby Synagogenstraße and dedicated in 1815. Jewish emancipation occurred in 1812 during the Prussian reforms, but Jews were largely restricted from officer and government professions. Full emancipation only occurred in 1869 through the North German Confederation.\n\nKönigsberg's Jewish community flourished during the 19th century and early 20th century, peaking with a population of 5,000 by 1880. The first history of the city's Jews was written by Heymann Jolowicz in 1867. In 1893 the Adass Jisroel, an Orthodox branch, opened their own synagoge on Synagogenstraße near the Alte Synagoge. The Orthodox numbered only 25-30 families, but included influential bankers, merchants, and jewelers. The liberal Neue Synagoge (new synagogue) was built along Lindenstraße in Lomse from 1894 to 1896 to serve the majority of the Jewish population. A third group included the city's Polish and Lithuanian Jews. The number of Russians Jews increased in the late 19th century due to anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire. Königsberg's Jewish citizens were divided between Zionists and the Centralverein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens.\n\nMany of Königsberg's Jews served during World War I. By 1917 there were 820 Königsberg Jews in the Prussian Army, including 80 volunteers. They included 15 recipients of the Iron Cross First Class and 102 recipients of the Iron Cross Second Class.\n\nDue to anti-Semitism and persecution in the 1920s and 1930s, Königsberg's Jewish population was in decline by the time of the Nazi Party took control through the \"Machtergreifung\" in 1933. In that year there were only 3,500 Jews living in the city. Anti-Jewish legislation in prewar Nazi Germany, enforced by Erich Koch, restricted business and led many Königsberg Jews to emigrate, mostly to the United States and Great Britain. Michael Wieck wrote of the discrimination he suffered from the Hitler Youth. At the opening of the 1935 Ostmesse, Hjalmar Schacht criticized the persecution to no avail. Persecution led the Jewish community to create a separate Jewish school for 82 students in April 1935; it grew to encompass 180 students in 6 classes with 4 teachers by October 1935. In February 1938 the propaganda paper \"Der Student der Ostmark\" published the names of 201 Jewish business, 38 doctors, and 22 lawyers remaining in the city, which was used by the Sturmabteilung during the Night of Broken Glass in November 1938. The New Synagogue was burned down, the Orthodox Adass Jisroel synagogue and two cemeteries were vandalized; the Jewish school was attacked but reopened afterwards, as was the Orthodox synagogue, where Michael Wieck became Bar Mitzva in mid-1941. Many of the Jewish residents were shipped to Nazi concentration camps within Germany.\n\nThere were only 1,585 Jews in the city in May 1939, after which emigration was prohibited. Prominent Königsberg Jews who committed suicide during World War II were the esteemed councilor Paul Stettiner, consul Felix Japha and his wife, and the doctor Lotte Gottschalk. Her uncle, politician Alfred Gottschalk, starved to death in 1942. The leader of the Jewish community, Hugo Falkenheim, was smuggled to safety. Those who remained in 1942 were shipped to concentration camps, including Theresienstadt in occupied Czechoslovakia, Kaiserwald in occupied Latvia, and camps in Minsk in occupied Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. The lawyer Max Lichtenstein died at Theresienstadt, while the councilor Marta Harpf died at Auschwitz. Only a small number of Königsberg's Jews survived The Holocaust and World War II; the number of victims is unknown. Many remaining German Jews left Königsberg, then Kaliningrad, in April 1948. \n\nToday, a community of approximately 2000 Jews remains in the region, with the New Synagogue being rebuilt in the same location and as an exact replica of the building destroyed in 1938.\n\nList of prominent personalities from Königsberg's Jewish community (including converts to Christianity)\n\n"}

{"id": "1011925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1011925", "title": "Islam in the Republic of Ireland", "text": "Islam in the Republic of Ireland\n\nThe documented history of Islam in Ireland dates to the 1950s. The number of Muslims in Ireland has increased since the 1990s, mostly through immigration. According to the 2016 Irish census the number of Muslims resident in the Republic was 63,443.\n\nThe earliest mention of Ireland in Muslim sources originates in the works of Al-Idrisi in his \"Tabula Rogeriana\" mentioned \"Irlandah-al-Kabirah\" (Great Ireland).\nOn 20 June 1631 a North African pirate ship captained by Jan Janszoon (Murad Reis) sailed into Roaring Water Bay in West Cork and raided coastal village of Baltimore. A crew of slave traders roused the villagers from their beds, slaughtered anyone who resisted, and herded 107 people into the hold of their waiting ship. Men, women and children were taken, even down to babies in the cradle. The villagers were sold into a life of slavery in the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn 1845 Ottoman Sultan Abdülmecid declared his intention to send £1,000 along with three ships full of food to the Irish people. According to Abdullah Aymaz in an article in \"The Fountain\" magazine, the British administration tried to block the ships, but the food arrived secretly at Drogheda harbor and was left there by Ottoman sailors. Shipping records relating to the port appear not to have survived. Newspaper reports suggest that ships from Thessaloniki in the Ottoman Empire sailed up the River Boyne in May 1847, although it has also been claimed that the river was dry at the time. A letter in the Ottoman archives of Turkey, written by prominent Irishmen, explicitly thanks the Sultan for his help.\n\nThe organisational history of Islam in Ireland is complex, not least because of the immense variety of ethnic backgrounds of Irish Muslims. The first Islamic Society in Ireland was established in 1959. It was formed by students studying in Ireland and was called the Dublin Islamic Society (later called the Islamic Foundation of Ireland). At that time there was no mosque in Dublin. The students used their homes and later rented halls for Jum'ah (Friday) and Eid (Muslim holiday) prayers. In 1976 the first mosque and Islamic Centre in Ireland was opened in a four-storey building at 7 Harrington Street, Dublin 8. Among those who contributed to the cost of the Mosque and Islamic Centre was the late King Faisal of Saudi Arabia. In 1981 the Ministry of Endowment and Islamic Affairs of Kuwait sponsored a full-time Imam for the Mosque.\n\nIn 1983, the present building of the Dublin Mosque and Islamic Centre was bought, renovated and the headquarters of the Society moved from Harrington Street to 163 South Circular Road, Dublin 8.\n\nIn Cork, prayer halls are located in housing estates. Cork's Muslim community operates out of an industrial estate, while hoping to raise money to build a new mosque.\n\nIn 1992, Moosajee Bhamjee became the first (and to date only) Muslim Teachta Dála (Member of Irish Parliament).\n\nAccording to the 2016 Irish census, there were 63,443 Muslims living in the Republic of Ireland, representing a 29% increase over the figures for the 2011 census. However the Islamic community is very much a minority, especially when compared to the numbers of Christians and those of no religion. Cities and towns with the highest Muslim population according to the 2016 census:\n27,586 Dublin City and suburbs;\n3,633 Cork City and suburbs;\n3,432 Limerick City and suburbs;\n2,047 Galway City and suburbs;\n1,392 Waterford City and suburbs;\n947 Balbriggan;\n937 Dundalk;\n937 Tralee;\n861 Drogheda;\n810 Portlaoise;\n711 Ennis;\n628 Sligo;\n615 Athlone;\n592 Navan;\n564 Carlow;\n562 Kilkenny;\n550 Swords;\n543 Ballyhaunis;\n522 Cavan;\n497 Mullingar;\n489 Letterkenny;\n467 Killarney;\n422 Naas;\n401 Longford </ref name=\"CSO\"></ref>\n\nThe Muslim community in Ireland is diverse and growing rapidly, and its numbers are not determined by the country's history to the same extent as the UK and France, where the majority of Muslims are immigrants or descendants of immigrants from former colonies, or Germany and Austria, where the majority of Muslims are Turkish migrant workers and their descendants. Just over 55 per cent of Muslims were either Asian or African nationals with 30.7 per cent having Irish nationality. The census also revealed that of the 31,779 Muslims resident in Ireland at the time of the census, 9,761 were Irish nationals, less than the number of Asians (10,649) although more than the 6,909 African nationals. The census of 2011 found there were 49,204 Muslims in Ireland, \"a sharp rise on five years previously\". The Muslim immigration at the end of the 90s was caused by the Irish economic boom and asylum seekers from diverse Muslim countries, and in the 20-year period between 1991 and 2011 the Muslim population increased 1000%, from 0.1% to 1.1% of the population of the republic.\n\nIn 2003, the Islamic Cultural Centre with help from Foras na Gaeilge announced plans to translate the Koran from Arabic into Irish for the first time. However, the plan foundered because of difficulties in finding speakers of both languages and as of 2018 no translation yet exists.\n\nIn September 2006 an umbrella organisation, the Irish Council of Imams, was established. It represents 14 imams in Ireland, of both the Sunni and Shia traditions. It is chaired by Imam Hussein Halawa (Islamic Cultural Centre of Ireland) and its deputy chairman is Imam Yahya Al-Hussein (Islamic Foundation of Ireland). Imam Dr. Umar Al-Qadri (Al-Mustafa Islamic Cultural Centre Dublin 15), Imam Salem (Cork Mosque), Imam Khaled (Galway Mosque) and Imam Ismael Khotwal (Blackpits Mosque) are among its founding members.\n\n\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community was formally registered in the country in 1992, during the era of the Fourth Caliph. However, there have been Ahmadi Muslims in the country since the 1960s. There are two Ahmadiyya mosques in the Republic of Ireland, one in Galway in the western coast, named the Galway Mosque, and one in Lucan near the eastern coast in County Dublin. The Galway Mosque is purpose built.\nMost Ahmadiyya Moslems in Ireland are refugees from countries where they are persecuted.\nSome UK-based Television channels targeted at the Muslim Community can be accessed in Ireland via satellite including the Sky digital platform.\n\n\nThere are several student Islamic societies (ISOC) in universities all across Ireland especially in the major universities such as UCD, TCD, UCC, NUIG, ISSNI, RCSI, DCU, Dublin Institute of Technology, IT Tralee, IT Tallaght, IT Blanchardstown, DBS.\n\nYearly events include regular (weekly halaqas & linguistic classes), social (Food festivals), cultural (Eid), Charity drives (Charity week), physical (sports), Academic (speakers tours, lectures, courses, conferences & seminars), Intellectual (debates) and campaigns (Islam awareness & justice)\n\nThe Federation of Students Islamic societies (FOSIS) Ireland , is an umbrella organisation established in the early millennium (2003) whose mission is to unite, serve and represent Muslim students.

{"id": "2673476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2673476", "title": "John Philoponus", "text": "John Philoponus\n\nJohn Philoponus (; ; c. 490 – c. 570), also known as John the Grammarian or John of Alexandria, was a Byzantine Alexandrian philologist, Aristotelian commentator and Christian theologian, author of a considerable number of philosophical treatises and theological works. A rigorous, sometimes polemical writer and an original thinker who was controversial in his own time, John Philoponus broke from the Aristotelian–Neoplatonic tradition, questioning methodology and eventually leading to empiricism in the natural sciences. He was one of the first to propose a \"theory of impetus\" similar to the modern concept of inertia over Aristotelian dynamics.\n\nLater in life Philoponus turned to Christian apologetics, arguing against the eternity of the world, a theory which formed the basis of pagan attacks on the Christian doctrine of Creation. He also wrote on Christology and was posthumously condemned as a heretic by the Imperial Church in 680–81 because of what was perceived as a tritheistic interpretation of the Trinity.\n\nHis by-name translates as \"lover of toil\", i.e. \"diligent,\" referring to a miaphysite confraternity in Alexandria, the \"philoponoi,\" who were active in debating pagan (i.e. Neoplatonic) philosophers.\n\nHis posthumous condemnation limited the spread of his writing, but copies of his work did circulate in Greek or Latin versions in medieval Europe, influencing Bonaventure and Buridan. His work was also received in Arabic scholarly tradition, where he is known as (i.e. \"John the Grammarian\"). His critique of Aristotle in the \"Physics\" commentary was a major influence on Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and Galileo Galilei, who cited Philoponus substantially in his works.\n\nAlthough Philoponus' originating from a Christian family is possible, nothing is known of his early life. Philoponus studied at the school of Alexandria and began publishing from about 510. He was a pupil and sometime amanuensis to the Neoplatonic philosopher Ammonius Hermiae, who had studied at Athens under Proclus.\n\nPhiloponus' early writings are based on lectures given by Ammonius, but gradually he established his own independent thinking in his commentaries and critiques of Aristotle's \"On the Soul\" and \"Physics\". In the latter work Philoponus became one of the earliest thinkers to reject Aristotle's dynamics and propose the \"theory of impetus\": i.e., an object moves and continues to move because of an energy imparted in it by the mover and ceases the movement when that energy is exhausted. This insightful theory was the first step towards the concept of inertia in modern physics, although Philoponus' theory was largely ignored at the time because he was too radical in his rejection of Aristotle.\nPhiloponus is the only writer of antiquity to have formally presented such a concept. \nAs the discovery of the principle of inertia is the hallmark achievement of modern science as it emerges in the 16th to 17th centuries, Pierre Duhem argues that its invention would put Philoponus among the \"great geniuses of Antiquity\" and the \"principal precursors to modern science\", although he holds it more likely that Philoponus may have received the idea from an earlier, otherwise unrecorded Alexandrian school of mechanics.\n\nIn 529 Philoponus wrote his critique \"On the Eternity of the World Against Proclus\" in which he systematically defeats every argument put forward for the eternity of the world, a theory which formed the basis of pagan attack of the Christian doctrine of Creation. The intellectual battle against eternalism became one of Philoponus' major preoccupations and dominated several of his publications (some now lost) over the following decade.\n\nHe introduced a new period of scientific thought based heavily on three premises: (1) The universe is a product of one single God, (2) the heavens and the earth have the same physical properties, (3) and the stars are not divine. With these principles Philoponus went after his rival, Simplicius of Cilicia, by questioning Aristotle's' view of dynamics and cosmology. He argued that motion can occur in a void and that the velocity of a falling object is not based on its weight. He also held that God created all matter with its physical properties and with natural laws that would allow matter to progress from a state of chaos to an organized state forming the present universe. What remains of his writings indicate that he used the same didactic methods of reasoning that modern science uses and that he performed genuine experiments.\n\nThe style of his commentaries and his conclusions made Philoponus unpopular with his colleagues and fellow philosophers, and he appears to have ceased his study of philosophy around 530, devoting himself to theology instead. Around 550 he wrote a theological work \"On the Creation of the World\" as a commentary on the Bible’s story of creation, using the insights of Greek philosophers and Basil the Great. In this work he transfers his theory of impetus to the motion of the planets, whereas Aristotle had proposed different explanations for the motion of heavenly bodies and for earthly projectiles. Thus Philoponus' theological work is recognized in the history of science as the first attempt at a unified theory of dynamics. Another of his major theological concerns was to argue that all material objects were brought into being by God (\"Arbiter\", 52A–B).\n\nAround 553 Philoponus made some theological contributions to the Council of Constantinople concerning Christology. His doctrine on Christ's duality, according to which in Christ remain two united substances, united but divided, is analogous to the union of the soul and body in human beings and coincides with the miaphysite school of thought. He also produced writings on the Trinity around this time. \"Arbiter\", John Philoponus' Christological “opus magnum” stands in the line with St. Cyril of Alexandria and Severus of Antioch. Philoponus asserted the understanding of Christ as divine and human, in opposition to Chalcedonian authors who strove to reach a middle ground.\n\nAfter his death, John Philoponus was declared to have held heretical views of the Trinity and was made anathema in 680–1. This limited the spread of his ideas in the following centuries, but in his own time and afterwards he was translated into Syriac and Arabic, and many of his works survived and were studied by the Arabs. Some of his works continued to circulate in Europe in Greek or Latin versions and influenced Bonaventure. The theory of impetus was taken up by Buridan in the 14th century.\n\nPhiloponus and his contemporaries, Simplicius of Cilicia and Strato developed the Aristotelian concept of space further, eventually influencing the Renaissance theory of perspective, particularly the one highlighted by Leon Battista Alberti, and other architectural masters.\n\nJohn Philoponus wrote at least 40 works on a wide array of subjects including grammar, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and theology.\n\n\nThe commentaries of the late antiquity and early Middle Ages aimed to teach an audience. In that regard, the repetitive nature of Philoponus’ commentaries demonstrates his pedagogical awareness. Although abstract in manner, Philoponus is chiefly focused on the concept in question.\n\nMost of Philoponus’ early philosophical works strive to define the distinction between matter, extension, place, and various kinds of change. For example, the commentary \"On the Eternity of the World against Aristotle\" represents a standardized description of Aristotelian natural philosophy. Both Aristotle and Philoponus argue that in kinds of change there are differences, in their form and matter.\n\nIn \"Physics\", Aristotle operates with the idea of places, but dismisses the existence of space. The idea that came from Plato and was developed by Aristotle has been evolved by Philoponus. Philoponus attempts to combine the idea of homogeneous space with the Aristotelian system. The argument made by Philoponus is that substances by themselves require some determinate quantity for their being. Similarly to Aristotle, who rejected the immaterial things, and in contrast to Plato who accepted immaterial substances in his metaphysics, Philoponus’ concept of substance refers to the material objects.\n\nConcerning the discussion of space, Philoponus’ claim that from every point in space is possible to draw identical figures, made him be perceived as an innovative thinker who influenced later Renaissance scholars, for instance, Gianfranceso Pico della Mirandola and Galileo Galilei. Thus, Philoponus' idea of perspective signifies the concept of space as immaterial three-dimensional medium in which objects are located.\n\nIn the third book of \"De Anima\", entitled \"De Intellectu\", Philoponus analyzes the doctrine of the intellect. The author (Philoponus or pseudo-Philoponus?) sets the theory on the role and functioning of the active intellect. On one hand, there is the active intellect, and on the other, the idea of perception awareness or how we are aware that we are perceiving. In other words, in this reflective philosophy, there is a rationalist conclusion which emphasizes a relation between self and truth which leads to the discussion of the nature of knowledge.\n\nAccording to this view, the knowledge is identical to its object, since the self-awareness of perception is divorced from the irrational soul.Therefore, the understanding arises through the identification of the intellect and its object. More specifically, perception deals only with material things.\n\nPhiloponus has raised the central question of the scientific and philosophical Aristotle’s work on chemistry. The work called \"On Generation and Corruption\" examines the question of how is the mixture (chemical combination) possible? Philoponus’ contribution to the topic is in his new definition of potential, the third of the seven elements criteria. There are various interpretations of the theory of mixture, but it seems that Philoponus is rather refining Aristotle’s approach than rejecting it. One of interpreters of Philophonus’ work on the theory of mixture, De Haas, implies that “no element can possess a quality essential to it except to a superlative extent”.\n\nPhiloponus’ major Christological work is \"Arbiter\". The work was written shortly before the Second Council of Constantinople of 553. It became famous in regard to its doctrine on resurrection. Similarly to ideas presented in \"Physics\", Philoponus in the work titled \"Arbiter\" states that our corrupted bodies (material things) will be eventually brought into being (matter and form) by God.\n\n\n\n"}

The JDP (or PJD) advocates Islamism and Islamic democracy.\n\nPJD was founded by Abdelkrim al-Khatib, one of the founders of the Popular Movement party, from which he was expelled in the mid-1960s, under the name of \"MPDC\" (, the \"Popular Democratic and Constitutional Movement\"). The party was an empty shell for many years, until various members of a clandestine association Chabiba islamia, who later formed the MUR (, the \"Unity and Reform Movement\") joined the party, with the authorisation and encouragement of former Interior Minister Driss Basri. It later changed its name to current PJD in 1998.\n\nThe party won eight seats in the parliamentary election in 1997. In the parliamentary election held on 27 September 2002, the party won 42 out of 325 seats, winning most of the districts where it fielded candidates. Its secretary-general since 2004 was Saadeddine Othmani, MP representing Mohammedia. In the parliamentary election held on 7 September 2007, the PJD won 43 out of 325 seats, behind the Istiqlal Party, which won 52. This was contrary to expectations that the PJD would win the most seats. However, the party had limited number of candidates in the election.\n\nAbdelilah Benkirane was elected leader of the PJD in July 2008, taking over from Saadeddine Othmani. Having won a plurality of seats (107 seats) in the November 2011 parliamentary election, the party formed a coalition with three parties that had been part of previous governments, and Abdelilah Benkirane was appointed Prime Minister of Morocco on 29 November 2011.\n\nHis new government has targeted average economic growth of 5.5 percent a year during its four-year mandate, and to reduce the jobless rate to 8 percent by the end of 2016 from 9.1 percent at the start of 2012. Benkirane's government has also actively pursued Morocco’s ties with the European Union, its chief trade partner, as well as becoming increasingly engaged with the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council.\n\nPJD is an Islamist conservative democrat party crucially supporting Moroccan monarchy. PJD disavows violence, terrorism and seeks to defend Morocco’s Islamic identity through legislative means. According to \"The Washington Post\", Saadeddine Othmani is a moderate Muslim.\n\nAccording to a paper published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the PJD has placed economic and legal issues at the core of its platform and is committed to internal democracy.\n\nThe party's stated platform includes:\n\n"}

The 19th-century \"Ceremonial for the Use of the Catholic Churches in the United States of America\" (commonly called the \"Baltimore Ceremonial\" because published by request of the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore of 1884) used the name: High Mass without Deacon or Sub-Deacon\n\nThe \"Baltimore Ceremonial\" thus classified the \"Missa cantata\" as a High Mass. The early 20th-century \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" said, on the contrary, that a \"Missa cantata\" \"is really a low Mass, since the essence of high Mass is not the music but the deacon and subdeacon. Only in churches which have no ordained person except one priest, and in which high Mass is thus impossible, is it allowed to celebrate the Mass (on Sundays and feasts) with most of the adornment borrowed from high Mass, with singing and (generally) with incense.\"\n\nIn 1960, Pope John XXIII's Code of Rubrics distinguished the \"Missa cantata\" both from a high Mass and from low Mass. Under the number 271, it defined the forms of Mass as follows:\n\nThe \"Missa cantata\" came into use during the 18th century and was intended for use in non-Catholic countries where the services of a deacon or a subdeacon (or clergy to fill these parts in the ceremony of the Mass) were not easily had. It was intended to be used in place of Solemn Mass on Sundays and major feast days.\n\nThe use of incense at a \"Missa cantata\" was at first forbidden, but became general: \"The Sacred Congregation of Rites has on several occasions (9 June 1884; 7 December 1888) forbidden the use of incense at a Missa Cantata; nevertheless, exceptions have been made for several dioceses, and the custom of using it is now generally tolerated.\" General permission was finally granted in the 1960 Code of Rubrics, which stated: \"The incensations that are obligatory in Solemn Mass are permitted in every Missa Cantata\".\n\nThe parts sung by the priest are to be sung in Gregorian chant. More elaborate musical settings of the choir's parts may also be used. \n\nThe rigid distinction between a sung Mass and a low Mass in the Roman Rite was abandoned in the 1969 revision of the Roman Missal. The General Instruction of the Roman Missal even states: \"It is very appropriate that the priest sing those parts of the Eucharistic Prayer for which musical notation is provided.\" Under the heading \"The Importance of Singing\", it says: \"Great importance should therefore be attached to the use of singing in the celebration of the Mass, with due consideration for the culture of the people and abilities of each liturgical assembly. Although it is not always necessary (e.g., in weekday Masses) to sing all the texts that are of themselves meant to be sung, every care should be taken that singing by the ministers and the people is not absent in celebrations that occur on Sundays and on holy days of obligation.\"\n\nUse of the 1962 Roman Missal, which incorporated the 1960 Code of Rubrics, remains permitted as an extraordinary form of the Roman Rite.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31887215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31887215", "title": "Monastic silence", "text": "Monastic silence\n\nMonastic silence is a spiritual practice recommended in a variety of religious traditions for purposes including facilitation of approaching deity, and achieving elevated states of spiritual purity. It may be in accordance with a monk's formal vow of silence, but can also engage laity who have not taken vows, or novices who are preparing to take vows. Monastic silence is more highly developed in the Roman Catholic faith than in Protestantism, but it is not limited to Catholicism. The practice has a corresponding manifestation in the Orthodox church, which teaches that silence is a means to access the deity, to develop self-knowledge, or to live more harmoniously.\nTheophilus, patriarch of Alexandria, placed the virtue of silence on par with the faith itself in a synodal letter from AD 400. \"Monks—if they wish to be what they are called—will love silence and the Catholic faith, for nothing at all is more important than these two things.\" \n\nThe practice of silence is observed during different parts of the day; practitioners talk when they need to but maintain a sense of silence or a sense of prayer when talking. The rules of silence apply to both vowed practitioners and non-vowed guests. Religious recommendations of silence as praxis do not deprecate speech when it is thoughtful and considerate of commonly held values. According to Andrew March of the Benedictine order, we \"can listen to substantive speech for hours while five minutes of garrulous speech is too much.\" It is noteworthy that \"silence\" can include what is more aptly characterized as \"quietness\", i.e. speaking in low voice tones. Silence is not an absence of words or thoughts—it is a positive and substantive reality.\n\nIn the book \"Silence, The Still Small Voice of God\", Andrew March establishes the roots of silence doctrine in the Psalms attributed to David. \n\"Benedict and his monastics would know from chanting the Psalter every week the verse that follows: “I was silent and still; I held my peace to no avail; my distress grew worse, my heart became hot within me. While I mused, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue” (Psalm 39: 3).\n\nSt. Norbet's Arts Center also anchors its views on silence in the Old Testament: \"For God alone my soul waits in silence; from him comes my salvation.\" (Psalm 62)\n\nThe Trappist rubric \"Living in silence\" illustrates centuries-old hand gestures which were \"developed to convey basic communication of work and\nspirit\".\n\nSilence plays a salient role in the Benedictine rule. It is thought that by clearing the mind of distraction, one may listen more attentively to the deity.\n\nChristian theology differs from Dharmic religions with regard to the mode in which spiritual ascent transpires within the context of contemplative quiet. Buddhism and Hinduism promote various spiritual practices, as do many Christian denominations. However, Christianity, particularly Protestantism, emphasizes the belief that ultimate spiritual achievement is not within the grasp of mortals, no matter how persistent their practice may be. Rather, the mechanism of spiritual attainment, which they regard as salvation and proximity to the deity, is believed to occur solely through supernatural mechanism. This mechanism is variously described as the action of God, conceived as the Father, or by action of the Holy Spirit. This mechanism of action, whether conceptualized as the Father or the Spirit, is called \"grace\".\n\nIn contemplative practice, the role of silence is expressed by the Fr. David Bird, OSB, (Order of St. Benedict): \"When both our interior and exterior are quiet, God will do the rest.\"\n\nCistercian monastics have remained active in the promotion of contemplative meditation. Part of the emphasis is on achieving spiritual ascent, but monastic silence also functions to avoid sin.\n\nAlthough speech is morally neutral \"per se\", the Epistle of James (3:1-12) and writers of the monastic tradition see silence as the only effective means of neutralizing our tendency towards sins of the tongue. There is an ongoing dialogue between Benedictine and Cistercian which speaks of a \"monastic archetype\" characterized by peace and silence.\n\nA Trappist’s commitment to silence is a monastic value which assures solitude in community. It fosters mindfulness of God and fraternal communion. It opens the mind to the inspirations of the Holy Spirit and favours attentiveness of the heart and solitary prayer to God. Early monastic communities evolved simple hand signing for essential communications. Spoken conversations between monks are permitted, but limited according to the norms established by the community and approved by the Order.\n\nBaptist pastor and evangelist Frederick Brotherton Meyer (1847–1929), a member of the Higher Life movement, developed a strong commitment to silence, which he saw as one of the ways to gain access to God's guidance on all matters.\nFB Meyer exerted a deep influence on Frank Buchman (1878–1961), originally a Protestant evangelist who founded the Oxford Group (known as Moral Re-Armament from 1938 until 2001, and as Initiatives of Change since then). Foundational to Buchman's spirituality was the practice of a daily \"quiet time\" during which, he claimed, anyone could search for, and receive, divine guidance on every aspect of their life. Dr Karl Wick, editor of the Swiss Catholic daily \"Vaterland\", wrote that Buchman had \"brought silence out of the monastery into the home, the marketplace and the board room.\" Buchman, in turn, taught thousands to \"listen and obey\", finding amazing resonance with non-Christian as well as Christian religions.\n\nBuddhist meditation techniques make use of \"vipassana\" and \"samatha\" techniques in their meditation practice. One of the central categories of Buddhist thought is \"sunyata\", which can be characterized as the silence of ontological Being. Neither the Bodhisattva vows of Mahayana Buddhism nor Theravada typically involve any vows of silence. Vowed religious practitioners do not typically practice silence pursuant to their vows, but rather as a local or \"denominational\" rule of monastic life.\n\nThe Zen monastery is called the \"zen-dō\", and a primary practice is sitting meditation called \"zazen\". Zazen is practiced either in silence, or by chanting. Apart from sitting practice, silence is frequently customary during simple vegetarian rice-gruel meals. Codified hand and arm gestures are used to communicate. Silence is generally preceded by a recitation of the Heart sutra and the five meditations.\n\nVarious stories or parables depict silence in meditation and action, in both vowed and lay practice.\n\nJudaism has a tradition of silence in sacred space and in sacred structures. Although technically not classified as monasteries, synagogues, yeshivas, and \"beit midrash\" (house of study) are the models, along with the Tanakh (Bible), upon which the monastic silence tradition are built.\n\nRabbi Shmuel Afek starts minyan with five minutes of silence during which each person can engage in his or her own personal preparation for tefillah. Isadore Twersky states in Introduction to the Code of Maimonides: \"One must be attuned to the silences\".\n\nOne of the leading exponents of monastic contemplative awareness is Thomas Merton. \n\nAccording to Merton, silence represents a form of transcending paradoxes such as he may have encountered in zazen training.\n\nIn addition to being a major figure in the field of contemplative studies, Merton expressed awareness of social issues conscience.\n\nMonastic silence is a category of practice which unites faiths and contributes a perennial topic of convergence between eastern and western traditions. Father Thomas Keating is the founder of Contemplative Outreach and former abbot of St. Benedict's Monastery in Snowmass, Colorado. He states that \"as in Buddhism, Christianity has several contemplative methods. The methods of contemplative prayer are expressed in two traditions: centering prayer, which we represent, and Christian Meditation, designed by John Main, which is now spreading rapidly throughout the world under the charismatic leadership of Father Lawrence Freeman.\"\n\nKeating's approach is more directly influenced by his collaboration with Buddhists from various traditions, whereas Main is influenced by his travels among Indian Hindus. Keating states that one \"progresses eventually to Christ nature or Buddha nature\" Keating distinguishes his contemplative method from that of John Main, another teacher of Christian mindfulness, but states an affinity for \"interior silence\". \"The John Main approach is a little different than ours, but both go in the same direction: moving beyond dependence on concepts and words to a direct encounter with God on the level of faith and interior silence.\"\n\nFr. James Conner, OCSO wrote about the Fifth Christian–Buddhist Contemplative Conference held at the Naropa Institute in which ordained practitioners from Zen, Vajrayana, and Catholic monastic lineages conducted meditation and discussion. According to Conner, wordless prayer is designed to transcend rational processes to allow perception of an exalted state. \"Zen says that Buddha-nature begins where the rational level ends. The same is taught in Christianity. One is to practice thoughtless, wordless prayer and thus perceive the divine presence.\"\n\nSilence is interjected into this Christian parable in some circles.\n\nThe original rendering of this syncope or parable from the Gospel of Luke does not incorporate silence. The adaptation into Zen tradition could have omitted the role of silence. This particular use of silence is neither monastic nor vowed, but the dialogue may well have taken place in a monastery rather than a university.\n\nBuddhism and Christianity are not the only traditions enunciating the virtues of quietism. The Tao Te Ching enunciates a view of the supreme value of doing absolutely nothing, in a profound metaphysical sense. This is called wu wei and is consistent with the concept of sunyata more fully elaborated in Buddhism. According to the Tao Te Ching, silence is merely the application of this concept to the tongue in addition to hands and feet.\n\nThe spiritual practice of silence has been extended into the healthcare setting under the rubric of Mind-Body healing. Dr. Jack Engler of the Theravada tradition of Buddhism is Director of the Schiff Psychiatric Center at Harvard University and participates in Christian–Buddhist dialogue. Dr Engller lived as a novice at the Abbey of Gethsemane, which is affiliated with Merton, and studied Buddhist meditation practices in Burma and India.\n\n"}

In \"\" the spirit of Nakoruru is an unplayable story mode character, but its PocketStation mini game is centered around her. She also featured as a non-player character mentor to the protagonist in the spin-off game, \"Nakoruru: Ano Hito kara no Okurimono\", a 2001 visual novel adventure game which takes place between the first two games in the series.\n\nIn the series, Nakoruru is a gentle and shy teenage girl serving Mother Nature as a shamanic priestess of the Ainu religion, born on Hokkaido island in 1771. Despite her usually pacifistic ways, she became a Kamui warrior of her peaceful Kamuikotan village after the death of her idolized father, and continues to fulfill this role throughout the series, fighting evil, often alongside Haohmaru, and even assuming a human form after her death (when she sacrifices herself to restore the balance of nature and preserve the land for her people at the end of the second game). Eventually, she merges her soul with Gaia and becomes \"the holy spirit who wanders through time\" in a form that resembles a koro-pok-guru. Unable to assume her original form, she asks the player to awaken her younger sibling, Rimururu the Maiden of Light, who has been sealed by Oboro.\n\nNakoruru fights with a kodachi short sword, and, depending on the form, a hawk named Mamahaha (in \"Slash\" form) or a Hokkaido wolf named Shikuru (in \"Bust\" form), also having other animal friends. Her powers include communicating with nature, fueling her blade with ki energy, ability to reflect a projectile back to its sender using her cloak, and healing wounds with the power of nature. American ninja Galford D. Weller is in love with her. The endings for \"Samurai Shodown VI\" revealed that Nakoruru and the alter-ego of Galford traveled the world together, likely as a romantic couple.\n\nIn \"The King of Fighters\" series, Nakoruru has first appeared playable as a secret character in the Game Boy version of \"The King of Fighters '95\" (without her animals). She also appeared as a non-playable character in \"The King of Fighters '94 Re-Bout\", \"The King of Fighters 2000\" (as a Special Striker for Yuri Sakazaki), \"\", and \"The King of Fighters XIII\" (in the Japan stage and in the Android/iOS versions as a tutorial instructor).\n\nNakoruru made a canonical playable debut in \"The King of Fighters XIV\", as the leader of the \"Another World Team\", playing a vital role in that new arc. Following from a certain \"Samurai Shodown\" event, Nakoruru sensed recent timeline changes (caused by Ash Crimson at the end of the thirteenth tournament) as a new terrible evil, known as Verse, was created and coming from a crack in time and space. To prevent a looming disaster, Nakoruru traveled to the present and teamed up with Mui Mui and Love Heart to enter the tournament to find Verse. Nakoruru, along with Team Japan (led by Kyo Kusanagi) and Team Official Invitation, manage to beat Verse. After that, she and her team have fun visiting Hokkaido and China.\n\nBesides \"Samurai Shodown\" and \"The King of Fighters\" games, Nakoruru is playable in the fighting games \"\" (as an unlockable secret character), \"Capcom vs. SNK 2\", \"\" (as rival of Capcom's Morrigan Aensland), \"Neo Geo Battle Coliseum\", \"SNK Gals' Fighters\", and \"\". She is also playable in several other games such as \"Neo Geo Tennis Coliseum\", \"Quiz King of Fighters\", \"\"Kal Kal Kal All Together\", \"The Rhythm of Fighters\" (optionally), \"Kotatsu Mikuni Kansai Senki\", and \"King of Glory\". In \"Lost Saga\", Nakoruru is a premium character that can be either female or male.\n\nNakoruru is a non-player character in the dating sims \"Days of Memories: Oedo Love Scroll\" and \"Kaze Maiu Miyako de Tsukamaete!\", and has a cameo of Rera as Nakoruru in \"Sekai de Ichiban Atsui Fuyu\". She has also made either cameo or collaboration event appearances in many other portable and mobile games, including \"SNK vs. Capcom Card Fighters DS\", \"SNK Dream Battle\" (in the game's cards), \"Dai Shingeki RPG! Sister Quest\", \"You Are the Hero!\", \"Granblue Fantasy,\" \"Kingdom Story: Brave Legion\", \"The Samurai Kingdom\", and \"Yamato Chronicle\".\n\nNakoruru appears in an anime film \"\" and in an anime OVA miniseries \"\" (as titular lead character) and \"Samurai Spirits 2: Asura-Zanmaden\" (appearing along with Rera in both OVAs), also making a cameo in \"\" (in a cosplay of Reiko Chiba), as well as in a number of manga releases (including as a co-protagonist of Kyoichi Nanatsuki and Yuki Miyoshi's adaptation of the first \"Samurai Shodown\", which was serialized in the West in an American magazine \"Game On!\"). She is also featured in several of the series' drama CDs and is a member in SNK's character image band, Band of Fighters, starring in her own character image CD.\n\nNakoruru further shows up in pachinko slot machine systems, including prominently in \"Samurai Spirits\" and especially \"Samurai Spirits Oni (Nakoruru)\". She has dozens of figurines made in her image, and even a life-size figure, also being featured in various other merchandise such as T-shirts, and in an American collectible card game \"Universal Fighting System\". Keeping in key with her nature-loving persona, Nakoruru was used as a mascot for SNK's environmental awareness campaigns in 1994. In 2007, SNK Playmore also created a social action program for children using Nakoruru and the \"Fatal Fury\" star Terry Bogard as their mascots. An image of praying Nakoruru was used to support the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami relief fund-raising.\n\nThe idea for the character came from a modern Japanese perception of the indigenous Ainu people of Hokkaido, being depicted as revering nature and peacefully coexisting with it. Her costume's design was based on Ainu clothing and she was supposed to mix a concept of a \"petite girl with a lovely appearance and personality\" with an \"innovative\" character performance of commanding a hawk companion in battle. Although Nakoruru was not directly modeled after any particular existing character, Hilda from \"The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun\" and Kamui from \"The Dagger of Kamui\" helped her conception process. The girl that appears during Nakoruru's entrances in \"Capcom vs. SNK\" is one of her childhood friends introduced in \"Nakoruru: Ano Hito kara no Okurimono\", Manari. Nakoruru was notably the first fighting game character brought back to life following her demise and one of the first who used a sidekick character in gameplay.\n\nNakoruru is 153 cm tall. An alternate, palette swap version of her with tanned skin and different colors of hair and eyes is the Bust Nakoruru (\"Rasetsu Nakoruru\") or EX Nakoruru, a recurring Easter egg type character that eventually evolved into Rera. Popularly known as , she is a crueler and cockier version of Nakoruru, more violent about fulfilling her mission to protect nature, and her companion is Shikuru the wolf. In fan service oriented fighting game \"SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy\", Nakoruru appears as default in a \"sexy vampire\" costume with a bat as her animal, while in \"The King of Fighters XIV\" she can be dressed up in a modern schoolgirl uniform.\n\nTo compensate for Nakoruru's short weapon range, players must rely on her speed to punish their opponents' mistakes. Nakoruru's strengths lie in her air supremacy (including aerial throws) and ability to jump around the sides of the screen. She can also recover from her moves a little quicker than other characters, making it easier for her to hit-and-run during fights. To balance her out with the rest of the cast, her attack strength is slightly weaker than most fighters. Her move set usually incorporates slightly longer ranged attacks that project her or her animal companions to her foes so her attack range is not limited to her sword. Since \"Samurai Shodown II\", she can also reflect projectiles with the move \"Kamui Ryusei\". Mamahaha can be used by the player to attack opponents in a diagonal aerial attack, acting as Nakoruru's projectile and anti-air defense. The player may also command Nakoruru to use him as a mount for a limited time. Whilst she is in the air, players can command the pair to hover higher, drop, or use Nakoruru to attack foes; she may do so normally from Mamahaha's height or players may choose to drop her in a swirl attacking motion or use a diagonal nosedive attack. Her moves' names are written in the Ainu language. \n\nPrior to \"Samurai Shodown V Special\", Nakoruru and Rimururu have been the series' two characters notable for being immune to the Fatality-like bloody killing moves. In \"Samurai Shodown: Edge of Destiny\", Mamahaha does not appear in fights except in special moves. The presence of monkeys in Nakoruru's stage in the original \"Samurai Shodown\" was a mistake of the background designer Tomoki Fukui which confused many fans as there are no monkeys on Hokkaido.\n\n (meaning \"Wind\" in Ainu) is a player character introduced in 2003. Her mannerism was based on Nakoruru's \"Bust\" form, being a violent and haughty ego of hers. The ruthless Nakoruru suppresses this side of herself as Rera sees \"eliminating everyone who stands in her way\" as a necessity to protect nature. Rera can physically take over Nakoruru, but has only done so when Nakoruru is reluctant to kill her enemies, and even manifest as a separate material entity to protect her host. Rera eventually merges back with Nakoruru after she realizes that fighting does not solve everything and peaceful solutions can be made.\n\nRera is playable in \"Samurai Shodown V\" and \"VI\". Similar to Nakoruru's \"Bust\" form in \"Samurai Shodown III\" and \"IV\", she too wields a kodachi and fights alongside her wolf, Shikuru, which primarily serves as a mount for her mount and is a necessity for several her special moves. Whilst Rera mounts him, the player can run faster and jump longer distances at the sacrifice of a lower height. She also appears in \"Days of Memories\" and in the film \"Nakoruru: Ano Hito kara no Okurimono\".\n\nAs an iconic \"Samurai Shodown\" and SNK character, Nakoruru has been well received worldwide, becoming especially popular in Japan. According to \"The King of Fighters XIV\" producer Yasuyuki Oda, this surprised even the company as no one at SNK had \"expected that Nakoruru would become a popular character to that extent.\" Her great popularity has made many interested in the modern Ainu people.\n\nJapanese arcade gaming magazine \"Gamest\" named her as the best character of 1993, later also placing her sixth in 1995 and 1996, 13th in 1997, and tenth in 1998. Japanese \"Sega Saturn Magazine\" ranked her as the eight best female character on the Sega Saturn in 1997, with her sister Rimururu placing 31st; and Japanese magazine \"Neo Geo Freak\" ranked her as the fifth best character on the Neo Geo in 1998, where Rimururu was eight. Retrospectively, Japanese magazine \"Famitsu\" declared Nakoruru as overally the 37th top video game heroine of the 1990s, with her being one of the only three non-Capcom fighting game characters on this list. Nakoruru was added to 2016's \"KOF XIV\" due to her enduring popularity. In a 2018 \"Famitsu\" poll for the most popular Neo Geo character, Nakoruru was voted third in general and first among the female ones (noted as ahead of the likes of Mai Shiranui or Athena Asamiya).\n\nAuthors of the many, often erotic, Nakoruru-themed dōjin manga include Aoi Nanase, whose original take on a resurrected Nakoruru was praised by many as arguably better than official illustrations and was even later used for the creation of the series' anime adaptation. Similar to Capcom's Chun-Li, Nakoruru became particularly popular among cosplaying girls in Japan, as well as even some males, especially at Tokyo Game Show events during the 1990s. A cosplayer dressed as her is featured in Honobu Yonezawa's novel \"Hyōka\".\n\nIn the West, \"GamePro\" reviewers criticized the original \"Samurai Shodown\" for its perceived unbalancing of characters, singling out Nakoruru as \"too weak\", but \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" conversely opined that \"despite her size, Nakoruru is one of the deadlier fighters\" in the game. \"Hobby Consolas\" described this \"no doubt\" favourite \"Samurai Shodown\" female character as an equivalent of Mai Shiranui from \"Fatal Fury\" but with a different appeal, that is an irresistible cuteness instead of sexual provocativeness. She has since been included among the series' favourites of many gaming publications, including Anime News Network, GamesRadar, IGN, Joystiq, \"Official Xbox Magazine\" and VideoGamer.com. In 2012, GamesRadar listed Nakoruru among top seven fighting game characters of all time, comparing her to a \"feudal Japan version of Captain Planet\".\n\nThe staff of \"Retro Gamer\" chose when they had first saw Nakoruru as their \"defining moment\" of \"Samurai Shodown\", due to her \"incredibly useful\" Mamahaha as \"a very early use of a satellite character, an innovative concept in fighting games.\" Tracey John from MTV also included her hawk Mamahaha (misspelled as \"Mahaha\") among the greatest birds in video game history and Rich Knight from \"Complex\" listed it as one of the ten craziest weapons in fighting games. \n\n"}

According to other traditions, the name is corruption of the word \"Paharia\", which in Hindi means a hill dweller. They are one of a number of tribal communities such as the Panika that occupy the foothills of the Vindhya mountains. The community speak a dialect of Hindi.\n\nThe habitat of most of the Parhiya is the hilly, undulating and extremely forested southern part of Sonbhadra district, at the foot of the Vindhya mountains. They are endogamous and divided into a number of exogamous clans known as kuris, of which the main ones are the Bengeha, Bhaloa, Bhania, Bhusan, Gohawa, Gurgur, Monnoor and Sira. Although they are Hindu, they also have a number of their own tribal deities such as Jawalamukhi Devi and Dharti Mata.\n\nThe Parahiya depend on the forest for their subsistence. They are small landholding community. Hunting and gathering forest produce is an important source of their income. They collect roots, tubers, fruits, lacs and leaves, which they sell at the local market. They no longer engage in hunting as settled cultivation is now their occupation.\n\nThe Government of Uttar Pradesh had classified them as a Scheduled Caste but by 2007, they were one of several groups that it had redesignated as Scheduled Tribes. As of 2017, this designation applies only in Sonbhadra district, as it also did at the time of the 2011 Census of India when the Parahiya Scheduled Caste population in Uttar Pradesh was 2446.\n"}

{"id": "1428576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1428576", "title": "Religious vows", "text": "Religious vows\n\nReligious vows are the public vows made by the members of religious communities pertaining to their conduct, practices, and views. \n\nIn the Buddhist tradition, in particular within the Mahayana and Vajrayana tradition, many different kinds of religious vows are taken by the lay community as well as by the monastic community, as they progress along the path of their practice. In the monastic tradition of all schools of Buddhism the Vinaya expounds the vows of the fully ordained Nuns and Monks. \n\nIn the Christian tradition, such public vows are made by the religious – cenobitic and eremitic – of the Catholic Church, Anglican Communion, and Eastern Orthodox Churches, whereby they confirm their public profession of the Evangelical Counsels of poverty, chastity, and obedience or Benedictine equivalent. The vows are regarded as the individual's free response to a call by God to follow Jesus Christ more closely under the action of the Holy Spirit in a particular form of religious living. A person who lives a religious life according to vows they have made is called a \"votary\" or a \"votarist\". The religious vow, being a public vow, is binding in Church law. One of its effects is that the person making it ceases to be free to marry. In the Catholic Church, by joining the consecrated life, one does not become a member of the hierarchy but becomes a member of a state of life which is neither clerical nor lay, the consecrated state. Nevertheless, the members of the religious orders and those hermits who are in Holy Orders are members of the hierarchy. \n\nSince the 6th century, monks and nuns following the Rule of Saint Benedict have been making the so-called Benedictine vow at their public profession of obedience (placing oneself under the direction of the abbot/abbess or prior/prioress), stability (committing oneself to a particular monastery), and \"conversion of manners\" (which includes forgoing private ownership and celibate chastity).\n\nDuring the 12th and 13th centuries mendicant orders emerged, such as the Franciscans and Dominicans, whose vocation emphasizing mobility and flexibility required them to drop the concept of \"stability\". They therefore profess \"chastity, poverty and obedience\", like the members of many other orders and religious congregations founded subsequently. The public profession of these so-called Evangelical counsels (or counsels of perfection), confirmed by vow or other sacred bond, are now a requirement according to modern Church Law.\n\nThe \"clerks regular\" of the 16th century and after, such as the Jesuits and Redemptorists, followed this same general format, though some added a \"fourth vow\", indicating some special apostolate or attitude within the order. Fully professed Jesuits (known as \"the professed of the fourth vow\" within the order), take a vow of particular obedience to the Pope to undertake any mission laid out in their Formula of the Institute. The Missionaries of Charity, founded by St. Teresa of Calcutta centuries later (1940s), are another example of this, in that her sisters take a fourth vow of special service to \"the poorest of the poor\".\n\nIn the Catholic Church, the vows of members of religious orders and congregations are regulated by canons 654-658 of the Code of Canon Law. These are public vows, meaning vows accepted by a superior in the name of the Church, and they are usually of two durations: temporary, and, after a few years, final vows (permanent or \"perpetual\"). Depending on the order, temporary vows may be renewed a number of times before permission to take final vows is given. There are exceptions: the Jesuits' first vows are perpetual, for instance, and the Sisters of Charity take only temporary but renewable vows.\n\nReligious vows are of two varieties: simple vows and solemn vows. The highest level of commitment is exemplified by those who have taken their solemn, perpetual vows. There once were significant technical differences between them in canon law; but these differences were suppressed by the current Code of Canon Law in 1983, although the nominal distinction is maintained. Only a limited number of religious congregations may invite their members to solemn vows; most religious congregations are only authorized to take simple vows. Even in congregations with solemn vows, some members with perpetual vows may have taken them simply rather than solemnly.\n\nA perpetual vow can be superseded by the Pope, when he decides that a man under perpetual vows should become a Bishop of the Church. In these cases, the ties to the order the new Bishop had, are dissolved as if the Bishop had never been a member; hence, such a person as, e.g., Pope Francis has had no formal ties to his old order for years. However, if the Bishop was a member in good standing, he will be regarded, informally, as \"one of us\", and he will always be welcome in any of the order's houses.\n\nThere are other forms of consecrated life in the Catholic Church for men and women. They make a public profession of the evangelical counsels of chastity, poverty, and obedience, confirmed by a vow or other sacred bond, regulated by canon law but live consecrated lives in the world (i.e. not as members of a religious institute). Such are the secular institutes, the hermits and the consecrated virgins (canon 604) These make a public profession of the evangelical counsels by a vow or other sacred bond. Also similar are the societies of apostolic life.\n\nAlthough the taking of vows was not a part of the earliest monastic foundations (the wearing of a particular monastic habit is the earliest recorded manifestation of those who had left the world), vows did come to be accepted as a normal part of the Tonsure service in the Christian East. Previously, one would simply find a spiritual father and live under his direction. Once one put on the monastic habit, it was understood that one had made a lifetime commitment to God and would remain steadfast in it to the end. Over time, however, the formal Tonsure and taking of vows was adopted to impress upon the monastic the seriousness of the commitment to the ascetic life he or she was adopting.\n\nThe vows taken by Orthodox monks are: Chastity, poverty, obedience, and stability. The vows are administered by the Abbot or Hieromonk who performs the service. Following a period of instruction and testing as a novice, a monk or nun may be tonsured with the permission of the candidate's spiritual father. There are three degrees of monasticism in the Orthodox Church: The Ryassaphore (one who wears the Ryassa – however, there are no vows at this level – the Stavrophore (one who wears the cross), and the Schema-monk (one who wears the Great Schema; i.e., the full monastic habit). The one administering the tonsure must be an ordained priest, and must be a monk of at least the rank he is tonsuring the candidate into. However a Bishop (who, in the Orthodox Church, must always be a monk) may tonsure a monk or nun into any degree regardless of his own monastic rank.\n\n"}

The station commenced broadcasting on 1 September 2010, as part of a two-week test phase.\n\nSangat TV is owned by Sangat Trust, a UK Registered Charity backed by gurdwaras from the UK and from other individuals. The channel is an open platform for the Sikhs sangat to express their views independently. Programming includes educational material on the Sikh gurus and Guru Granth Sahib. The channel is now broadcast on Sky channel 755. \n\nSangat TV came into prominence during the West Midlands riots of August 2011. The presenter Upinder Randhawa notably broadcast live from the streets of Birmingham from the first day of rioting in the area, Monday 8 August 2011, to provide accurate, live information and broadcasts. Coverage was extended to the surrounding areas such as West Bromwich and Wolverhampton the following night. The channel's coverage was used by BBC News, ITN and Sky News as well as international stations such as CNN, Fox News and NDTV 24x7 to show what was happening in the area.\n\nThis coverage included sequences of guerrilla journalism, most notably footage of the reporting team transporting a police officer in their vehicle in pursuit of looters while live on air. The popularity of the coverage led to Sangat TV presenter Upinder Randhawa's Twitter following jumping from 600 users to about 4,000 users in one night, as well as having over 4,000 followers to a fan page on Facebook called \"Upinder Randhawa from Sangat TV is a Legend\". Prime Minister David Cameron hailed Sangat TV's contribution as \"an example of a media company's commitment to social responsibility\". On 10 August 2011, Ofcom said it had received one complaint about the previous night's coverage of the riots, in relation to alleged incitement to violence over comments urging people to get out on the streets and protect their property.\n\nIn 2016, most of the staff of Sangat TV had mostly resigned due to the poor treatment, underpay, where the staff were paid as little as £600 a month for doing a 40 hour a week shift. The channel then has lost most of its programming and it ran as a registered charity with Charity Commission of England and Wales with charity number 1139995.\n\nIn August 2016, word went round that Sangat TV would be moving its base from Edgbaston, Birmingham to Southall, London in a bid to get better content and volunteers to run the channel. \nSangat TV was fined £30,000 over a debate in which guests supported an assassination attempt on a former Indian Army general, Kuldip Singh Brar, who led the army attack on Akal Takht in Operation Blue Star in June 1984.\n\nIn 2015, the Ofcom Broadcasting Code was broken when Sangat TV continuously aired a song hailing 'Sukha Jinda', two criminals who had robbed a bank, with justification that it was an advert from Dharam Seva Records. The complainant considered that the video glorified the actions of two Sikh nationalists Harjinder Singh Jinda and Sukhdev Singh Sukha (\"Jinda\" and \"Sukha\" respectively). These men, who were members of the Khalistan Commando Force, were hanged in 1992 for the assassination of General Arun Shridhar Vadiya, the Chief of the Indian Army responsible for Operation Bluestar in 1984. They were also found responsible for the murder of two Indian politicians.\n\nOfcom upheld a complaint made by Dr Parvinder Singh Garcha. The programme, which aired in September 2014 included a live debate in advance of an election for a new committee to run the Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha in Southall, West London. At the end of the debate two videos were shown. The second video also included the claim that money had been stolen from a donation box in the Gurdwara during a period when the Baaj Group was in control. Ofcom noted that the decision to include the second video was made by the presenter during the course of the programme and that Dr Garcha said that he had left the studio before at the end of the debate (i.e. before the video in question was shown). However, in Ofcom's view, it is reasonable to expect that before making such a decision, a broadcaster would be familiar with the content of any material it planned to broadcast. Ofcom considered that the Baaj Group was treated unfairly in this respect in the programme as broadcast. \n\n\n"}

During his early years there he became acquainted and friends with Sakari Pinola, who later recruited him to missionary work in Taiwan. Salko has said he “grew up together” with Pinola.\n\nDuring his years at school, Salko was such a pious man that his classmates called him “pastor”. He participated in the Lappeenranta parish youth group of mission friends. He did not go to high school, but instead studied to become a teacher in the Heinola Seminary, where he met his wife to be, Marja-Liisa Raulamo, who came from Tampere. Salko graduated in 1964, and Raulamo the following year. It appears that the Salkos got married in 1965. Part of the engagement was a pledge to go out as missionaries.\n\nThe next five years the Salkos worked as teachers in Ristijärvi in the Kainuu province. During that time they furthered the missionary cause in the parish. Salko reported in the FMS magazine \"Suomen Lähetyssanomat\" in 1970 of a lunch that was arranged as a fundraiser, which had yielded more than 3000 Finnish marks for mission work. After the five years in Ristijärvi, the Salkos found themselves in 1970 in the mission candidates’ course with the FMS in Helsinki.\n\nThe Salkos left from Finland to Taiwan on 19 October 1971. Their first term as missionaries in Taiwan lasted from 1971 to 1975. They used their first year in Taiwan studying the local languages. After that they began their work in The Finnish dormitory in Taichung, which at the time was operated in rented premises. The Finnish children attended Morrison Academy, an American school that functioned in Taichung. The distance from the children’s homes to the school was between 200 and 300 kilometers.\n\nDue to a change in the city plan, Morrison had to abandon its old campus and built a new one outside the city. At this stage, a separate building for the Finnish dormitory was built on the new campus. The planning of the dormitory building had many twists and turns, but in the end Seppo Salko had the final word in determining what the building was to be like.\n\nIn 1974, the Salkos wrote about their work as follows:\n\nDuring the school year 1975–76, the Salkos had a furlough in Finland, and another missionary couple, Simo and Tarja Lipasti, ran the dormitory during that time.\n\nThe Salkos’ second term began in 1976 and ended in 1980, and the third term lasted from 1981 to 1985.\n\nDuring the furloughs, Salko worked in the FMS headquarters in Helsinki. During 1975–76 he was responsible for the circulation of the FMS magazine \"Suomen Lähetyssanomat\" and during 1980–81 he worked as the head of the audiovisual productions.\n\nAfter the Salkos’ third term, the FMS decided in 1985 that no one would be allowed to work at the Taichung dormitory for more than two terms. Thus, in 1985 the Salkos remained in Finland.\n\nDuring 1985–87 Salko worked in the FMS as the person in charge of matters dealing with scholarship students in Finland, until the FMS reversed its decision on the “two terms” rule at the dormitory and sent the Salkos for a fourth term during 1987–91.\n\nThe Salkos returned to Finland for good in 1991. After this, Salko worked with the FMS, assigned to the Lapua Diocese and after this during 1992–95 as the person responsible for the functioning of the FMS Mission Church at the FMS headquarters in Helsinki. He was listed in this capacity also in the 1996 and 1997 FMS yearbooks, although he no longer worked in this assignment.\n\nAs a pensioner, Salko has participated in work with homeless children in St. Petersburg, Russia. He has done this as part of the \"Aitomiehet\" (‘real men’) group of the Aitolahti Parish in Tampere.\n\nHe can be seen posing with other “real men” in the group’s 2014 Christmas photograph.\n\n"}

Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj also known as Rajarshi Shahu was considered a true democrat and social reformer. First Maharaja of the princely state of Kolhapur, he was an invaluable gem in the history of Maharashtra. Greatly influenced by the contributions of social reformer Jyotiba Phule, Shahu Maharaj was an ideal leader and able ruler who was associated with many progressive and path breaking activities during his rule. From his coronation in 1894 till his demise in 1922, he worked tirelessly for the cause of the lower caste subjects in his state. Primary education to all regardless of caste and creed was one of his most significant priorities. \n\nHe was born as Yeshwantrao in the Ghatge Royal Maratha family, of Kagal village of the Kolhapur district as Yeshwantrao Ghatge to Jaisingrao and Radhabai in June 26, 1874. Jaisingrao Ghatge was the village chief, while his mother Radhabhai hailed from the royal family of Mudhol. Young Yeshwantrao lost his mother when he was only three. His education was supervised by his father till he was 10-year-old. In that year, he was adopted by Queen Anandibai, widow of Kingh Shivaji IV, of the princely state of Kolhapur. Although the adoption rules of the time dictated that the child must have Bhosale dynasty blood in his vein, Yeshwantrao’s family background presented a unique case. He completed his formal education at the Rajkumar College, Rajkot and took lessons of administrative affairs from Sir Stuart Fraser, a representative of the Indian Civil Services. He ascended the throne in 1894 after coming of age, prior to which a regency council appointed by the British Government took care of the state affairs. During his accession Yeshwantrao was renamed as Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj.Chhatrapati Shahu was over five feet nine inches in height and displayed a regal and majestic appearance. Wrestling was one of his favourite sports and he patronised the sport throughout his rule. Wrestlers from all over the country would come to his state to participate in wrestling competitions. \n\nHe was married to Lakshmibai Khanvilkar, daughter of a nobleman from Baroda in 1891. The couple had four\nchildren – two sons and two daughters.\n\nWhen Brahmin priests of the royal family refused to perform the rites of non-Brahmins in accordance with the Vedic hymns, he took the daring step of removing the priests and appointment a young Maratha as the religious teacher of the non-Brahmins, with the title of Kshatra Jagadguru(the world teacher of the Kshatriyas). This was known as the Vedokta controversy. It brought a hornet's nest about his ears, but he was not the man to retrace his steps in the face of opposition. He soon became the leader of the non-Brahmin movement and united the Marathas under his banner.\n\nChhatrapati Shahu occupied the throne of Kolhapur for 28 years, from 1894 to 1922, and during this period he initiated numerous social reforms in his empireShahu Maharaj is credited with doing much to further the lot of the lower castes and indeed this assessment is warranted. He also ensured suitable employment for students thus educated, thereby creating one of the earliest Affirmative action(50% reservation to weaker sections) programs in history. Many of these measures were effected in the year 1902 on July 26. He started Shahu Chhatrapati Weaving and Spinning Mill in 1906 to provide employment. Rajaram college was built by Shahu Maharaj and afterwards it was named after him.. His emphasis was on education and his aim was to make education available to masses. He introduced a number of educational programs to promote education among his subjects. He established hostels separately for different ethnicities and religions like Panchals, Devadnya, Nabhik, Shimpi, Dhor-Chambhar communities as well as for Muslims, Jains and Christians. He established the Miss Clarke Boarding School for the socially quarantined segments of the community. He introduced several scholarships for the poor but meritorious students from backward castes. He also initiated a compulsory free primary education for all in his state. He established Vedic Schools that enabled students from all castes and classes to learn the scriptures and propagate Sanskrit education among all. He also started special schools for the village heads or ‘Patils’ to make them into better administrators.\n\nChhatrapati Sahu was a strong advocate of equality among all strata of the society and refused to give the Brahmins any special status. He removed Brahmins from the post of Royal Religious advisers when they refused to perform religious rites for non-Brahmins. He appointed a young Maratha scholar in the post and bestowed him the title of `Kshatra Jagadguru' (the world teacher of the Kshatriyas). This incident together with the Shahu’s encouragement of the non-Brahmins to read and recite the Vedas led to the Vedokta controversy in Maharashtra. The Vedokta controversy brought a storm of protest from the elite strata of the society; a vicious opposition of the Chhatrapati’s rule. He established the Deccan Rayat Association in Nipani during 1916. The association sought to secure political rights for non-Brahmins and invite their equal participation in politics. Shahuji was influenced by the works of Jyotiba Phule, and he long patronized the Satya Shodhak Samaj, formed by Phule. In his later life, he, however, moved towards the Arya Samaj.\n\nIn 1903, he attended the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, and in May that year he received the honorary degree LL.D. from the University of Cambridge.\n\nChhatrapati Shahu made great efforts to abolish the concept of caste segregation and untouchability. He introduced (perhaps the first known) reservation system in government jobs for untouchable castes. His Royal Decree ordering his subjects to treat every member of the society as equal and granting the untouchables equal access to public utilities like wells and ponds, as well as establishments like schools and hospitals. He legalised inter-caste marriages and made a lot of efforts for the upliftment of the dalits. He discontinued the hereditary transfer of titles and tenures of revenue collectors (Kulkarni), a caste infamous for exploiting the masses, especially enslavement of the Mahars, a lower caste.\n\nThe Chhatrapati also worked towards betterment of the conditions of women in his empire. He established schools to educate the women, and also spoke vociferously on the topic of women education. He introduced a law banning the Devadsi Pratha, the practice of offering girls to God, which essentially led to exploitation of the girls in the hands of the Clergy. He legalised widow remarriages in 1917 and made efforts towards stopping child marriages.\n\nHe introduced a number of projects that enabled his subjects to self-sustain in their chosen professions. The Shahu Chhatrapati Spinning and Weaving Mill, dedicated market places, establishment of co-operative societies for farmers were introduced by the Chhatrapati to alleviate his subjects from middle men in trading. He made credits available to farmers looking to buy equipment to modernise agricultural practices and even established the King Edward Agricultural Institute to teach the farmers to increase crop yield and related technologies. He initiated the Radhanagari Dam on February 18, 1907 and the project was completed in 1935. The dam stands testament to Chhatrapati Shahu’s vision towards the welfare of his subjects and made Kolhapur self-sufficient in water.\n\nHe was a great patron of art and culture and encouraged artists from music and fine arts. He supported writers and researchers in their endeavours. He installed gymnasiums and wrestling pitches and highlighted the importance of health consciousness among the youth. \n\nHis seminal contribution in social, political, educational, agricultural and cultural spheres earned him the title of Rajarshi, which was bestowed upon him by the Kurmi warrior community of Kanpur.\nChhatrapati was introduced to Bhimrao Rammji Ambedkar by artists Dattoba Pawar and Dittoba Dalvi. The King was greatly impressed by the great intellect of young Bhimrao and his revolutionary ideas regarding untouchability. The two met a number of times during 1917-1921 and went over possible ways to abolish the negatives of caste segregation. Together they organised a conference for the betterment of the untouchables during March 21-22, 1920 and Chhatrapati made Dr. Ambedkar the Chairman as he believed that Dr. Ambedkar was the leader who would work for the amelioration of the segregated segments of the society. He even donated Rs. 2,500 to Dr. Ambedkar when he started his newspaper ‘Mooknayak’ on January 31, 1921, and contributed more later for the same cause. Their association lasted till the Chhatrapati’s death in 1922.\n\nIn 1891, Shahu married Lakshmibai née Khanvilkar(1880–1945), daughter of a Maratha nobleman from Baroda. They were the parents of four children:\n\n\nThe great social reformer Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj died on May 6, 1922. He was succeeded by his eldest son Rajaram III as the Maharaja of Kolhapur. It was unfortunate that the reforms initiated by Chhatrapati Shahu gradually began to cease and fade for the lack of able leadership to carry on the legacy.\n\nHis full official name was: Colonel His Highness Kshatriya-Kulawatasana Sinhasanadhishwar, Shrimant Rajarshi Sir Shahu Chhatrapati Maharaj Sahib Bahadur, GCSI, GCIE, GCVO.\n\nDuring his life he acquired the following titles and honorific names:\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease visit : www.shahumaharaj.com"}

{"id": "30525513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30525513", "title": "Synod of Milan", "text": "Synod of Milan\n\nThe Synod of Milan or Council of Milan may refer to any of several synods which occurred in late Roman Mediolanum or medieval Milan in northern Italy's Po valley:\n\nIt is certainly true that in 353 or 354 Pope Liberius wrote thus: \"Eight years ago the Eusebian deputies, Eudoxius and Martyrius (who came to the West with the formula ), refused to anathematize the Arian doctrine at Milan\". But the Synod of Milan here alluded to is placed about the year 345, soon after the Synod of Sardica. \n\nSt. Maximinus was at this synod.\n\nLucifer of Cagliari was deputed by Pope Liberius, with the priest Pancratius and the deacon Hilary, to request the Emperor Constantius to convene a council, to deal with the accusations directed against St. Athanasius and his previous condemnation. This council was convened at Milan in the newly erected Basilica Nova (or Basilica Maior or St. Tecla). The council however did not follow the hopes of the Pope due to the overwhelming number of Arians bishops and the initial forced absence of the champion of the Nicaean faith, Eusebius of Vercelli. Lucifer there defended the Bishop of Alexandria (Athanasius) with much passion and in very violent language, thus furnishing the adversaries of the great Alexandrian with a pretext for resentment and further violence, and causing a new condemnation of Athanasius. The bishop of Milan Dionysius initially seemed ready to follow the Arians in condemning Athanasius, accused not of heresy but of lese-majesty against the Emperor. \n\nWith the arrival of Eusebius the situation changed: Eusebius requested an immediate subscription of the Nicaean faith by the bishops. Eusebius, Lucifer and Dionysius signed, but the Arian bishop Valens of Mursia violently shreded the act of faith. Constantius, unaccustomed to independence on the part of the bishops, moved the synod to his palace and grievously maltreated the papal embassy. Hilary was flogged and the exiled along with Pancratius and the two Nicaean bishops. The synod, now governed by the Arians bishops of the court of Constantius, ended supporting Arian statements.\n\nAugustine's \"On the Good of Marriage\" was written against somewhat that still remained of the heresy of Jovinian. He mentions this error in b. ii. c. 23, de \"Nuptiis et Conc. Jovinianus\", he says, who a few years since tried to found a new heresy, said that the Catholics favored the Manichæans, because in opposition to him they preferred holy Virginity to Marriage. \"That heresy took its rise from one Jovinianus, a monk, in our own time, when we were yet young\". And he adds that it was soon overborne and extinguished, say about A.D. 390, having been condemned first at Rome, then at Milan. There are letters of Pope Siricius on the subject to the Church of Milan, and the answer sent him by the Synod of Milan, at which St. Ambrose presided. Jerome had refuted Jovinian, but was said to have attempted the defense of the excellency of the virgin state, at the expense of condemning marriage. \n\nSt. Maximus of Turin was at a \"synod of Milan\" in 389 at which Jovinianus was condemned, according to his ninth homily.\n\nIn 451, St. Maximus of Turin was again at a synod in Milan where the bishops of Northern Italy accepted the celebrated letter (\"epistola dogmatica\") of Pope Leo I, setting forth the orthodox doctrine of the Incarnation against the Nestorians and Eutychians. Among nineteen subscribers Maximus is the eighth, and since the order was determined by age, Maximus must then have been about seventy years old.\n\nA synod that took place in Milan in 860 summoned Ingiltrud, wife of Boso, to appear before it because she had left her husband for a paramour. Pope Nicholas I commanded the bishops in the dominions of Charles the Bald to excommunicate her unless she returned to her husband. As she paid no attention to the summons, she was put under the ban.\n\n"}
{"id": "54162582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54162582", "title": "Temple of Janus (Autun)", "text": "Temple of Janus (Autun)\n\nThe \"Temple of Janus\" is a cultic structure of Romano-Celtic design located in Autun, Saône-et-Loire, France, to the North-West of the ancient city of Augustodunum.\n\nThe temple lies in the center of a vast sanctuary, whose extent and complexity was revealed by excavations conducted from 2013 to 2016, on a site whose history goes back to Neolithic times, and which experienced an important phase of monumental constructions in the 1st Century CE. The temple was abandoned at the onset of the Early Middle Ages, and its structures were later reused in the fashioning of a Medieval defensive work. The temple has retained two sides of its square \"cella\", at a height of over 20 meters, as well as vestiges of its ambulatory and side structure foundations. The temple's supposed dedication to the Roman god Janus is not based on any archaeological or historic fact, and the deity that was venerated in the temple is unknown.\n\nThe Temple of Janus was included on the first list of protected historical French monuments, established in 1840.\n\nThe temple was built outside the walls of the ancient city of Augustodunum, in a place known as \"la Genetoye\", beside a road that, after passing through the Arroux gate and over the river, headed West towards Lutetia (Paris), the valley of the Loire, and Cenabum (Orléans).\n\nThe site sits at an average altitude of 290 meters, atop a plateau that gradually slopes downward towards the valleys of the Arroux to the South and the Ternin, one of its tributaries, to the East.\n\nThe history of the temple is inseparable from the whole in which it is part. The site of \"la Genetoye\" was used since Neolithic times without notable interruption until the Middle Ages.\n\nGeophysical exploration and aerial photography have demonstrated the existence of a vast Neolithic enclosure, accompanied with layouts whose functions are ill-defined.\nOn-site excavations over the course of 2012 have revealed the presence of La Tène usage which lasted up until the Augustan age. Some outlines, whose nature and function have yet to be defined (perhaps an earlier cultic structure), have also been found within the footprint of the temple. They are dated to the first half of the 1st Century CE.\n\nThe \"Haut-du-Verger\" theater, discovered in the same area in 1976 and excavated the following year, provides an additional structure in this area. The principle monuments of the site, the theater and Temple of Janus, appear to have been constructed in the second half of the 1st Century or at the onset of the 2nd Century, with later modifications and adjustments. The site could have hosted a military presence at the end of the third century, beyond which period no convincing evidence has been recorded.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the \"cella\" of the temple was reused for the construction of a fortification that included a ditch. This reuse may partially explain the temple's good state of preservation.\n\nThe Temple of Janus was designated as a \"monument historique\" in 1840.\n\nThe Temple of Janus probably dates back to the second half of the 1st Century CE, like the other principal monuments of Augustodunum.\n\nAlthough it is truly an ancient monument, its claimed dedication to the cult of Janus is not based on any reality. The deity to which the temple had been consecrated is unknown. The name of Janus could simply be a corruption of the toponym \"Genetoye\" (meaning a place where broom, \"genêts\" in French, was said to grow since the 16th century). A historical marker near the temple explains:\n\nThe \"cella\" was built with a nearly square footprint (16.80 x 16.35 m) and its elevation reaches up to around 24 meters, a record for Gaul. The walls have a thickness of 2.2 meters, built in small, meticulous stonework. The entryway must have been formed by one of the missing walls, probably on the East side. \n\nTwo walls (South and West) are fully preserved, and the initial construction of the other two walls is still visible. The facing of the walls is entirely made up of small, square sandstone rubble with no terracotta inclusions, and the putlog holes that had supported the scaffolding are still visible. The core of the wall is composed of blockage and rubble mortared in Roman concrete. The wall was probably penetrated by the \"cella\"'s front door, a common placement in Romano-Celtic temples. The exterior of the walls featured four rectangular niches and three small openings crowned with stone discharging arches 13 meters above ground, which illuminated the interior of the \"cella\". The interior side of the wall was hollowed by four large, arched niches, 3 meters wide and 5.6 meters tall, but breaches in the wall now give them the appearance of large picture windows. The Western wall features a semi-dome in its center, which, facing the entry, may have housed the statue of the divinity to which the temple was consecrated. The \"cella\" floor was inlaid with \"opus sectile\", fragments of which have been retrieved, and the base of an \"aedicula\" which was installed at the \"cella's\" center is still in place. The \"cella\" would have been covered by a four-sided roof.\n\nHoles from the joists on the exterior side of the walls 9 meters above the ground, and bases parallel and 5.4 meters away from the walls, prove the existence of a covered gallery (ambulatory) which went around the \"cella\", in accordance with the Gallo-Roman temple model observed at Périgueux with the tower of Vésone. This gallery was probably composed of columns built on the peripteros wall and supporting a sloping roof.\n\nAn ambulatory demarcated the sacred area around the sanctuary, as is often the case for this type of structure. The dimensions proposed after the 19th Century excavations (75 x 50 m) cannot be confirmed. Studies undertaken in 2012 revealed the existence of two successive and concentric ambulatories, the older, perhaps featuring a portico, could have been connected to the Temple of Janus or an earlier cultic structure. To the South of the \"cella\", and in the enclosure of the ambulatory, demolished walls could show the presence of an ancillary building.\n\nIn 1871, Jacques Gabriel Bulliot undertook excavations to the North-West of Autun and around the temple that led to the establishment of a detailed map drawn by Jean Roidot-Déléage. Jean Roidot-Déléage also devoted eight plates of surveys and drawings to the Temple of Janus, which were not published or commented on until 1963. The presumably Neolithic structures were revealed in 1886. Until the 1970s, no excavations were carried out in the area of the Temple of Janus.\n\nAerial surveys lead by René Goguey in 1976 resulted in the discovery of the Haut-du-Verger theater, allowing the collection of sparse information obtained on the district, which has since been seen as a vast peri-urban sanctuary having \"the function of uniting different cults of the city\". In the years that followed, public authorities proceeded to acquire the lands in question, finally allowing excavations to take place. Aerial surveys continued until the 2000s when, in 2009, a magnetic survey finally completed the obtained data. A vast archaeological dig and study site was put in place in 2012. It is expected to complete in 2016 and put forth a global vision of the \"la Genetoye\" district, both geographically and historically.\n\n\n\n\n"}

On August 9, 1969, Watson and other Manson followers murdered pregnant actress Sharon Tate and four other people at 10050 Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles. The next night, Watson traveled to Los Feliz, Los Angeles, and participated in the murders of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, as part of Manson's \"Helter Skelter\" vision. Watson was found guilty of murder and imprisoned in 1971.\n\nWatson was born in Farmersville, Texas, on December 2, 1945, and grew up in nearby Copeville. He was the youngest of three children. Tex grew up apparently attending the Copeville Methodist Church. In high school he was an honor student and athlete, and worked as the editor on the school paper. In September 1964, Watson moved to Denton, Texas, to attend University of North Texas, where he joined a fraternity.\n\nIn January 1967 Watson began working at Braniff International as a baggage handler. Using free airline tickets to travel, he visited a fraternity brother in Los Angeles; there he became interested in the psychedelic and music lifestyle of the late 1960s. Soon Watson met some women who were in the Manson Family, and then met Charles Manson. Watson decided to join the Manson Family shortly afterwards.\n\nOn August 9, 1969 as a member of the Manson Family, Watson went with Susan Atkins, Linda Kasabian, and Patricia Krenwinkel to a large estate on Cielo Drive in Hollywood, leased by movie director Roman Polanski and his wife, actress Sharon Tate. Polanski was in London, England working on a film on August 8th. At the home were Sharon Tate and her friends: hairdresser Jay Sebring, writer Wojciech Frykowski, and Folger's coffee heiress Abigail Folger.\n\nWatson, who had been to the 10050 Cielo Drive address on at least one other occasion, climbed a telephone pole near the security gate and cut the house phone line. The entire Manson group then climbed over the fence. When a car from the guest house approached, driven by an 18‑year‑old named Steven Parent, Watson ignored his pleas for mercy and shot Parent four times in the chest and abdomen at point-blank range.\n\nAfter pushing Parent's car further up the driveway and traversing the front lawn, Watson cut the screen of a window and let Atkins and Krenwinkel in through the front door. Upon Watson's direction, Atkins found the house's three other occupants, and with Krenwinkel, brought them to the living room. Watson tied Tate and Sebring together at the neck with rope and slung it up over a beam. Sebring started to resist and Watson shot him. After Watson shot Sebring and took $70 from Folger's purse, Folger and Frykowski bolted from the house, but they were chased outside, and after being stabbed further, died on the front lawn. Watson and his crime partners inflicted 28 stab wounds to Folger alone. Tate, Sebring and Frykowski all suffered numerous stab wounds. Sebring and Frykowski were also shot.\n\nThe next night, Charles Manson (who was displeased by their performance and pledged to show them \"how to do it\") drove six \"Manson Family\" members, Leslie Van Houten, Steve \"Clem\" Grogan and the four from the previous night into Los Angeles. In March 1968, Manson and other Family members had attended a party at the rented home of Harold True in Los Feliz, located at 3267 Waverly Drive. Manson did not want to kill True because he thought it could be traced back to him, so he settled for the house next door where Leno and Rosemary LaBianca lived. After driving their car up and down the street, and waiting, Manson and Watson got out of the car, disappeared walking up the driveway and entered the home together. According to Watson's book \"Will You Die For Me?\", Manson held the occupants at gunpoint while Watson tied them up. Manson returned to the car to say he had tied up the house's occupants and sent Krenwinkel and Van Houten into the house.\n\nKrenwinkel and Van Houten took Rosemary LaBianca to her bedroom as Watson murdered Leno LaBianca in the den. Rosemary LaBianca was then murdered in her room, primarily by Krenwinkel and Watson, with additional (and possibly postmortem) wounds inflicted in her back by Van Houten. Both victims were stabbed numerous times and the word \"WAR\" was carved into Leno LaBianca's stomach; a fork was also left protruding from his stomach. Krenwinkel smeared words and phrases from, or inspired by, lyrics from recent Beatles songs such as \"WAR\", \"Healter Skelter\" (sic), \"RISE\", and \"Death to Pigs\" onto the walls and various surfaces in the victims' blood.\n\nOn October 2, 1969, Watson fled the Spahn Ranch and headed back to his native state of Texas. On November 30, 1969, Watson was arrested in Texas for the Tate–LaBianca murders. He and his lawyers fought extradition to California for nine months. Upon arriving in California, Watson stopped talking and eating, losing 55 pounds, and began regressing to a catatonic state. He was admitted to Atascadero State Hospital for a 90‑day evaluation period to determine if he was fit to stand trial. Watson stayed there until February 1971, when he was deemed able to stand trial.\n\nOn October 12, 1971, Watson was convicted of seven counts of first degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder. A week later, the same jury took only two and a half hours to determine that Watson was sane.\n\nOn October 21, 1971, Watson was sentenced to death. He arrived on California's death row Nov. 17, 1971. He escaped execution when the California Supreme Court's \"People v. Anderson\" decision resulted in the invalidation of all death sentences imposed in California prior to 1972. Watson was found guilty of the murders of seven people — Abigail Folger, Wojciech Frykowski, Steven Parent, Sharon Tate Polanski who was eight months pregnant, Jay Sebring, Leno LaBianca and Rosemary LaBianca — and his seven counts were to be served concurrently. His minimum eligible parole date was November 26, 1976, but he has been denied parole 17 times since then, including two stipulations; he was most recently given a five-year denial of parole at a board hearing on October 27, 2016. He remains incarcerated at Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego, California.\n\nAccording to his prisoner outreach web site, Watson converted to Christianity in 1975. \"Will You Die For Me?\", Watson's autobiography, as told to \"Chaplain Ray\" (Ray Hoekstra), was published in 1978. In 1979, he married Kristin Joan Svege. Through conjugal visits they were able to have four children (three boys, one girl), but those visits for life prisoners were banned in October 1996. After 24 years of marriage, Svege divorced Watson after meeting another man in 2003. Svege and Watson remain friends. He had become an ordained minister in 1981, and graduated from California Coast University in 2009 with a B.S. in Business Management.\n\nIn August 1982, a Southern California‑based group, Citizens for Truth, submitted some 80,000 petition signatures and several thousand letters opposing Watson's parole. The group received help from Doris Tate, the mother of victim Sharon Tate. The group was successful in convincing the California Board of Prison Terms to deny parole for Watson. In later years the group, along with Doris Tate, and her daughters, Patricia and Debra, submitted petitions with more than two million signatures.\n\nIn 2012, Watson disputed a request to release recordings of conversations with his attorney. The recordings became part of a bankruptcy proceeding involving the deceased attorney's law firm. Members of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said they believed the recordings might contain clues about unsolved murder cases involving the Manson family. Watson asked the presiding judge to allow police to listen to the tapes but not take possession of them. The LAPD did acquire the tapes, which allegedly contained Watson confessing to other murders, but reported that they did not contain any new information. In September 2014, Richard Pfeiffer, an attorney for Leslie Van Houten, said that he was considering subpoenaing the tapes to look for information that might help Van Houten in her next parole hearing.\n\n"}

{"id": "24436077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24436077", "title": "Vicar (Anglicanism)", "text": "Vicar (Anglicanism)\n\nVicar is the title given to certain parish priests in the Church of England. It has played a significant role in Anglican Church organisation in ways that are different from other Christian denominations. The title is very old and arises from the medieval situation where priests were appointed either by a secular lord, by a bishop or by a religious foundation. Wherever there is a vicar he shares the benefice with a rector (usually non-resident) to whom the great tithes were paid. \"Vicar\" derives from the Latin \"vicarius\" meaning a substitute.\n\nHistorically, Anglican parish priests were divided into rectors, vicars and (rarely) perpetual curates. These were distinguished according to the way in which they were appointed and remunerated. The church was supported by tithes: taxes (traditionally of ten percent) levied on the personal and agricultural output of the parish.\n\nParish churches in England originated as the personal property of (predominantly lay) patrons; who had the right to appoint and dismiss the parish priest, to receive an entrance fee on appointment, and to charge an annual rent thereafter. By the Gregorian reforms of the 11th century, almost all these rights were extinguished for lay patrons, who were able to retain the sole residual power to nominate the rector to a benefice, and many lay notables thereupon gave up parish churches into the ownership of religious houses; who were less inhibited by canon law from extracting fees and rents from rectors, and who could moreover petition for exemption from most such laws by papal dispensation. Around 40% of rectories in England passed into monastic possession. Initially it had not been unusual for religious houses in possession of rectories also to assume the capability to collect tithe and glebe income for themselves, but this practice was banned by the decrees of the Lateran Council of 1215. Thereafter, over the medieval period, monasteries and priories continually sought papal exemption from the Council's decrees, so as to be able to appropriate the income of rectoral benefices to their own use. However, from the 13th century onwards, English diocesan bishops successfully established the principle that only the glebe and \"greater tithes\" could be appropriated by monastic patrons in this manner; sufficient \"lesser tithes\" had to remain within the parochial benefice to ensure a competent living; the incumbent of which thenceforward carried the title of \"vicar\". By 1535, of 8,838 rectories in England, 3,307 had thus been appropriated with vicarages; but at this late date, a small sub-set of vicarages in monastic ownership were not being served by beneficed clergy at all. In almost all such instances, these were parish churches in the ownership of houses of Augustinian or Premonstratensian canons, orders whose rules required them to provide parochial worship within their conventual churches; for the most part as chapels of ease of a more distant parish church. From the mid-14th century onwards the canons were able to exploit their hybrid status to justify petitions for papal privileges of appropriation, allowing them to fill vicarages in their possession either from among their own number, or from secular stipendiary priests removable at will; arrangements which corresponded to those for their chapels of ease.\n\nFollowing the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the rectors and vicars of parishes formerly in monastic possession continued in post, their sources of income unaffected. Rectors received both greater and lesser tithes, vicars the lesser tithes only. Lay grantees of monastic lands also took over the monasteries' rights of nomination to monastic rectories. For monastic vicarages, the right to the greater tithes and to nominate a vicar also generally passed into the hands of lay owners, known as \"impropriators\". Perpetual curates were appointed to the unbeneficed parishes and chapels of ease formerly in the possession of the canons. These received no tithe income, and originally impropriators were required to provide a fixed stipend; although generally the function of paymaster was eventually taken over by the diocese. If, in later years, a newly created parish was carved out of a larger rectoral or vicarial parish, the incumbent would be legally a perpetual curate, but would commonly be styled \"vicar\" in common use.\n\nIn legislation, the \"Act for the True Payment of Tithes\" of 1548, the great tithes are described as those of corn (that is all cereal crops), hay and wood; and the small tithes as the remainder. All such tithes were originally paid in kind. Each instance of appropriation, however, was established for an individual parish; and so there was wide local variation. Vicarial (small) tithe frequently included hay and wood; rectoral (great) tithe sometimes included wool (especially in rich wool-producing areas) as well as corn. Otherwise the main components of the small tithe, apart from wool, were milk, eggs, dairy produce and the young of animals raised as food; lambs, piglets, calves, goslings. Since animal young rarely arrived in exact multiples of ten, local custom commonly established cash adjustments to round the tithe value up or down. All or part of the tithed items might have been commuted by local custom to a fixed cash payment; which, following the inflation of the 16th century, reduced commuted tithes to a fraction of their former value. By the 17th century, many such vicarages had become so poor that there was no prospect of filling them; and the parish might find their cure of souls effectively annexed in plurality to a neighbouring vicarage or rectory, the parishioners consequently being offered at best infrequent opportunities for worship at their own parish church.\n\nAn Act of Parliament of 1868 permitted perpetual curates to style themselves vicars and the term \"parson\" rapidly lost popularity. The conjunction of this change with near-contemporaneous church reforms aimed at reducing the disparities of income among clergy meant that the distinction between the grades of clergy became progressively less relevant and remarked upon. Popularly, any member of the clergy is often referred to as a \"vicar\", even when they do not legally hold such a post. In the past a similar situation led to all clergy being popularly referred to as parsons.\n\nMost parishes in England and Wales retain the historical title for their parish priest—rector or vicar—with vicar being more common in the urban areas, because of an expansion of new Parishes being created in the Victorian years, and the incumbents being styled 'vicar' after 1868. The distinction between the titles is now only historical. In the late 20th century, a shortage of clergy and the disparity of workload between parish clergy led to the development of a number of new forms of parish ministry.\n\nIn Wales prior to Disestablishment most parishes in the southern dioceses (St. Davids and Llandaff) were vicarages subject to lay patronage, whereas in the north rectors predominated largely nominated by the bishops of Bangor and St. Asaph.\n\nOne of these, which has proved relatively effective, is the \"Team\" ministry or benefice. Under this arrangement, a number of parishes conjoin to form a \"team\", in which each parish retains its legal definition and independence. Rather than having clergy licensed to the individual parishes, a team of clergy are licensed to the entire \"benefice\". Alternatively, a large parish with daughter churches in addition to a parish church, may be created as a Team Ministry.\n\nIn these examples, one incumbent-level priest is regarded as \"first among equals\", takes the title \"team rector\" and serves as parish priest in one or more parishes (often the larger), while one or more priests of incumbent status, who may or may not be stipendiary, serve as \"team vicars\". Team vicars are often installed into other parishes within the team. Other clergy—perhaps part time stipendiary or non-stipendiary—and those in training positions are formally \"assistant curates\" and are often known as \"team curate\" or, for instance, \"associate priest\".\n\nUntil the introduction of Common Tenure, team rectors and team vicars were not appointed as perpetual parish priests, and as such did not possess the \"freehold\" but were licensed for a fixed term, known as \"leasehold\", usually seven years for a team rector, and five years for a team vicar. With the introduction of Common Tenure most parochial clergy have similar terms of appointment and there is less distinction in terms of \"employment\" rights between Team clergy and other incumbents than hitherto.\n\nIn many other Anglican provinces, the distinction between a vicar and a rector is different. In the Church of Ireland and the Scottish Episcopal Church, most parish priests are rectors. In the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, a vicar is a priest in charge of a mission, meaning a congregation supported by its diocese instead of being a self-sustaining parish which is headed by a rector.\n\nIn early 17th-century Ulster every church had a vicar and a parson instead of a co-arb and an erenagh. The vicar, like the co-arb, was always in orders. He said the mass ('serveth the cure') and received a share of the tithes. The parson, like the erenagh, had a major portion of the tithes, maintained the church and provided hospitality.\n\nAs he was not usually in clerical orders, his responsibilities were mainly temporal. However, there were differences in the divisions of the tithes between various dioceses in Tyrone. In the Diocese of Clogher, the vicar and the parson shared the tithes equally between them; in the Diocese of Derry, church income came from both tithes and the rental of church lands ('temporalities'). The vicar and the parson each received one third of the tithes and paid an annual tribute to the bishop.\n\nIn places where there was no parson, the erenagh continued to receive two thirds of the income in kind from the church lands, and delivered the balance, after defraying maintenance, to the bishop in cash as a yearly rental. In other places, the parson, the vicar and the erenagh shared the costs of church repairs equally between them. In the Diocese of Armagh the parson received two-thirds of the tithes and the vicar one third. The archbishop and the erenagh impropriated no part thereof, presumably because they received the entire income from the termon lands. The division of responsibilities between vicar and parson seems to derive from a much earlier precedent established in the old Celtic Church of St Columcille.\n\nThe image of the parish vicar is a popular one in British culture. A popular British television series on BBC depicts a fictional woman vicar humorously in \"The Vicar of Dibley\", and the story of The Vicar of Bray appears as a song and otherwise.\n\n"}
