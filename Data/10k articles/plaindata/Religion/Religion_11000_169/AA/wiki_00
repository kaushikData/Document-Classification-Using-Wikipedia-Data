It is primarily one's personal inner and outer struggle for self-purification. Armed struggle or military exertion is the only to be used in defense. However, even then it can only be carried out under the direct instruction of a Caliph, purely for the sake of God and the preservation of religion. It is not permissible that jihad be used to spread Islam violently or for political motives, or that it be waged against a government that maintains religious freedom. Political conflicts (even from a defensive stand) over independence, land and resources or reasons other than religious belief cannot be termed jihad. There is a clear distinction, in Ahmadi theology, between Jihad (striving) and \"qitāl\" or \"jihad bil-saif\" (fighting). While Jihad may involve fighting, not all fighting can be called Jihad. Rather, according to Ahmadiyya belief, \"qitāl\" or military jihad is applicable, only as a defensive measure in very strictly defined circumstances and those circumstances do not exist at present.\n\nAhmadiyya claims its objective to be the revival and peaceful propagation of Islam with special emphasis on defending and extending Islam 'by the pen' and by argumentation. Ahmadis point out that as per prophecy, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (whom they believe to be the promised messiah) rendered Jihad in its military form as inapplicable in the present age since Islam, as a religion, is not being attacked militarily but through literature and other media, therefore the response should be likewise.\n\nAhmadis denounce the usage of a sword or any other form of coercion as a method of the propagation of the Islamic faith. In contrast to some of the commonly held views that historically Islam was spread by force, Ahmadis maintain that early Muslims did not take up the sword in order to spread their faith, but rather for the preservation of religion. In particular, the founder of the movement, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad stated that when Islam began gaining converts upon its birth, there was an ever-increasing tension against the new converts by the pagans of Mecca, which resulted in them being severely persecuted for many years. After many years of patience, the Muslim converts migrated to the neighbouring city of Medina. This did not stop persecuting the Muslims. They were pursued by the Pagans and it was only then that the Muslims first took up the sword in order to defend their lives and preserve the religion.\n\nAhmadis denounce the usage of a sword as an Islamic concept with support from the Qur'an which according to them categorically rejects any form of coercion in religion. The Qur'an states:\nThe fourth Caliph, of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Mirza Tahir Ahmad states:\n\n\n"}

He was one of the three sons of Odysseus by Circe, and brother to Rhomos and Ardeas, each of whom were said to have founded a major Roman city, much like the Romulus and Remus myth. The town of Anteia or Antium in Italy (modern Anzio) was said to have been founded by, and taken its name from, this Anteias.\n\nThis characterization primarily comes to us from the writings of the historian Xenagoras. Xenagoras was likely writing at a time that Antium was being assimilated into the identity of Rome, Antium having been the capital of the Volsci people before their defeat in the Roman-Volscian wars of the 4th century BCE, after which the Romans sent colonists to Antium to more fully enculturate the city as \"Roman\". Modern scholars believe this characterization to indicate that Antium was considered at the time to be a city on equal footing with Rome and Ardea, the cities represented by the other two brothers.\n"}

These anti-religious campaigns started occurring in 1949, after the Cultural Revolution, and continue today, with an emphasis on the destruction of houses of worship, such as churches. As a result of anti-religious campaigns carried out between 1950 and 1979, churches, mosques and temples were closed and reeducation was coerced upon clergy. The most recent has been instated by current party General Secretary Xi Jinping, who reemphasized that members of the Communist Party of China must be \"unyielding Marxist atheists\" and also \"instituted a broad campaign to suppress all forms of dissent.\" In the Chinese province of Zhejiang alone, over one-thousand two hundred Christian crosses have been removed from their steeples since 2013. In August 2017, a number of Catholic Christian priests, as well as laypeople, were injured when trying to prevent a government bulldozer from demolishing their historic church in the Shanxi province. In February 2018, government authorities in Kashgar, \"launched an anti-religion propaganda drive through local police stations\", which included policemen erecting a banner proclaiming “We Must Solemnly Reject Religion, Must Not Believe in Religion”.\n\n\n"}

In 2003, she ran as an independent candidate for governor in the California recall election and lost. In 2009, Huffington was #12 in \"Forbes's\" first-ever list of the Most Influential Women In Media. She has also moved up to #42 in \"The Guardian\"s Top 100 in Media List. As of 2014, she is listed by \"Forbes\" as the 52nd Most Powerful Woman in the World.\n\nIn 2011, AOL acquired \"The Huffington Post\" for US$315 million, and made Huffington the President and Editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post Media Group, which included \"The Huffington Post\" and then-existing AOL properties including AOL Music, Engadget, Patch Media, and StyleList. On August 11, 2016, it was announced that she would step down from her role at \"The Huffington Post\" to devote her time to a new startup, Thrive Global, focused on health and wellness information.\n\nHuffington was born Ariadnē-Anna Stasinopoúlou () in Athens, Greece, the daughter of Konstantinos (a journalist and management consultant) and Elli (née Georgiadi) Stasinopoulou, and is the sister of Agapi (an author, speaker and performer). She moved to the United Kingdom at the age of 16 and studied economics at Girton College, Cambridge, where she was the first foreign, and third female President of the Cambridge Union.\nShe also studied Comparative religion from Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan. She told IANS in an email interview \"India has long held a special place in my heart, from the time I went to study comparative religion at Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan\".\n\nIn 1971, Huffington appeared in an edition of \"Face the Music\" along with Bernard Levin. A relationship developed, of which she wrote, after his death: \"He wasn't just the big love of my life, he was a mentor as a writer and a role model as a thinker.\" Huffington began writing books in the 1970s, with editorial help from Levin. The two traveled to music festivals around the world for the BBC. They spent summers patronizing three-star restaurants in France. At the age of 30, she remained deeply in love with him but longed to have children; Levin never wanted to marry or have children. Huffington concluded that she had to break away and moved to New York in 1980.\n\nFrom March - April 1980, Huffington joined Bob Langley as the co-host of BBC1's late night talk and entertainment show \"Saturday Night At The Mill\", appearing in just 5 editions before being dropped from the programme.

The words for the album were co-written by Arianna Stassinopoulos.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Huffington wrote several articles for \"National Review\". In 1981, she wrote a biography of Maria Callas, \"Maria Callas – The Woman Behind the Legend\", and in 1989, a biography of Pablo Picasso, \"Picasso: Creator and Destroyer\".\n\nHuffington rose to national U.S. prominence during the unsuccessful Senate bid in 1994 by her then husband, Michael Huffington, a Republican. She became known as a reliable supporter of conservative causes such as Newt Gingrich's \"Republican Revolution\" and Bob Dole's 1996 candidacy for president. She teamed up with liberal comedian Al Franken as the conservative half of \"Strange Bedfellows\" during Comedy Central's coverage of the 1996 U.S. presidential election. For her work, she and the writing team of \"Politically Incorrect\" were nominated for a 1997 Emmy for Outstanding Writing for a Variety or Music Program.\n\nAs late as 1998, Huffington still aligned herself with Republicans. During that year, she did a weekly radio show in Los Angeles called \"Left, Right, & Center\", that \"match[ed] her, the so-called 'right-winger', against self-described centrist policy wonk Matt Miller, and veteran 'leftist' journalist Robert Scheer.\" In an April 1998 profile in \"The New Yorker\", Margaret Talbot wrote that \"Most recently, she has cast herself as a kind of Republican Spice Girl – an endearingly ditzy right wing gal-about-town who is a guilty pleasure for people who know better.\" Huffington described herself by side-stepping the traditional party divide, saying \"the right/left divisions are so outdated now. For me, the primary division is between people who are aware of what I call 'the two nations' (rich and poor), and those who are not.\"\n\nHuffington, of Greek background, opposed NATO intervention against Serbia during the Yugoslav Wars and in 2000, she instigated the \"Shadow Conventions\", which appeared at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia and the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles at Patriotic Hall.\nHuffington headed The Detroit Project, a public interest group lobbying automakers to start producing cars running on alternative fuels. The project's 2003 TV ads, which equated driving sport utility vehicles to funding terrorism, proved to be particularly controversial, with some stations refusing to run them.\n\nIn a 2004 appearance on \"The Daily Show\" with Jon Stewart, she announced her endorsement of John Kerry by saying, \"When your house is burning down, you don't worry about the remodeling.\" Huffington was a panel speaker during the 2005 California Democratic Party State Convention, held in Los Angeles.

She described her candidacy against frontrunner Arnold Schwarzenegger as \"the hybrid versus the Hummer\", making reference to her ownership of a hybrid vehicle, the Toyota Prius, and Schwarzenegger's Hummer. The two would proceed to have a high-profile clash during the election's debate, during which both candidates were rebuked for making personal attacks.\n\nShe dropped out of the race on September 30, 2003, and endorsed Governor Gray Davis' campaign to vote against the recall. Polls showed that only about 2 percent of likely California voters planned to vote for her at the time of her withdrawal. Though she failed to stop the recall, Huffington's name remained on the ballot and she placed 5th, capturing 47,505 votes or 0.55% of the vote.\n\nHuffington was a panelist on the weekly BBC Radio 4 political discussion programme, \"Any Questions?\", and the BBC television panel games \"Call My Bluff\" and \"Face the Music\". She served as co-host of BBC's late night chat show \"Saturday Night at The Mill\" for four weeks before viewer complaints caused her to be dropped from the show.\nHuffington at one point was the co-host of the weekly, nationally syndicated, public radio program \"Both Sides Now\", along with Mary Matalin, former top aide to the George W. Bush White House.

Green.\n\nPrior to \"The Huffington Post\", Huffington hosted a website called AriannaOnline.com. Her first foray into the Internet was a website called Resignation.com, which called for the resignation of President Bill Clinton and was a rallying place for conservatives opposing Clinton. About Clinton resigning, she wrote, \"Only some act of sacrifice can begin to restore the image of the President that we are left with from the Starr report - a man of staggering narcissism and self-indulgence, whom nobody dared gainsay, investing his energies first in gratifying his sexual greeds and then in using his staff, his friends, and the Secret Service to cover up the truth.\"\n\nIn November 2008, Huffington joined the cast of Seth MacFarlane's animated series, \"The Cleveland Show\", where she lends her voice to the wife of Tim the Bear, also named Arianna.\n\nHuffington was spoofed by actress Tracey Ullman in her Showtime comedy series \"Tracey Ullman's State of the Union\". Huffington spoke glowingly of the impersonation.\n\nHuffington was further impersonated by actresses Michaela Watkins and Nasim Pedrad on \"Saturday Night Live\".\n\nHuffington appeared as herself in the May 10, 2010, episode of the CBS sitcom \"How I Met Your Mother\".\n\nHuffington participated in the 24th annual \"Distinguished Speaker Series\" at the University at Buffalo, NY, on September 16, 2010. She headlined a debate against radio co-host Mary Matalin on current world events, political issues, and the local Buffalo economy. The University at Buffalo \"Distinguished Speaker Series\" has featured a multitude of world-renowned politicians and celebrities such as; Tony Blair, Bill Nye, Jon Stewart, and the Dalai Lama.\n\nHuffington offered to provide as many buses as necessary to transport those who wanted to go to Jon Stewart's Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear on October 30, 2010, from \"The Huffington Post\" headquarters in New York City. Ultimately, she paid for 150 buses to ferry almost 10,000 people from Citi Field in Queens to RFK Stadium in DC.\n\nHuffington played herself in the \"Family Guy\" episode \"Brian Writes a Bestseller\" along with Dana Gould and Bill Maher in a live segment of \"Real Time with Bill Maher\".\n\nIn 2012, Huffington became a LinkedIn Influencer, writing about success and sharing professional insights.\n\nHuffington was accused of plagiarism for copying material for her book \"Maria Callas\" (1981); the claims were settled out of court in 1981, with Callas' biographer Gerald Fitzgerald being paid \"in the low five figures\".\n\nLydia Gasman, an art history professor at the University of Virginia, claimed that Huffington's 1988 biography of Pablo Picasso, \"Picasso: Creator and Destroyer\", included themes similar to those in her unpublished four-volume PhD thesis. \"What she did was steal twenty years of my work\", Gasman told Maureen Orth in 1994. Gasman did not file suit.\n\nColumnist Maureen Orth also claimed that Huffington \"borrowed heavily for her 1993 book, \"The Gods of Greece\"\".\n\nHuffington has had a lifelong interest in spirituality; in her youth, together with Bernard Levin, she explored the Rajneesh movement, later dating est founder Werner Erhard and going on to become affiliated with John-Roger Hinkins' Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness. In 1994, she published a self-help book titled \"The Fourth Instinct\", outlining her view that people should rise above the three basic instincts of survival, power, and sex to find their higher and better selves.\n\nHuffington met her husband Michael Huffington in 1985. They were married a year later, on April 12, 1986. They have two daughters, Isabella and Christina.\n\nArianna became a naturalized American citizen in 1990. She is Greek by birth. The couple later moved to Santa Barbara, California, and in 1992 Michael ran as a Republican for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, which he won by a significant margin. In 1994, Michael narrowly lost the race for the U.S. Senate seat in California to incumbent Dianne Feinstein.\n\nThe couple divorced in 1997. In 1998, Michael Huffington disclosed that he was bisexual saying, \"I know now that my sexuality is part of who I am, I've been through a long process of finding out the truth about me.\" He said, \"In December 1985, in my Houston town house I sat down with [Arianna] and told her that I had dated women and men so that she would be aware of it ... The good news was that it was not an issue for her.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "925810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=925810", "title": "Axial Age", "text": "Axial Age\n\nAxial Age (also Axis Age, from ) is a term coined by German philosopher Karl Jaspers in the sense of a \"pivotal age\" characterizing the period of ancient history from about the 8th to the 3rd century BCE.\n\nThen, according to Jaspers' concept, new ways of thinking appeared in Persia, India, China and the Greco-Roman world in religion and philosophy, in a striking parallel development, without any obvious direct cultural contact between all of the participating Eurasian cultures. Jaspers identified key thinkers from this age who had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. \n\nJaspers' approach to the culture of the middle of the first millennium BC has been adopted by other scholars and academics, and has become a point of discussion in the history of religion.\n\nJaspers introduced the concept of an Axial Age in his book \"Vom Ursprung und Ziel der Geschichte\" (\"The Origin and Goal of History\"), published in 1949. The simultaneous appearance of thinkers and philosophers in different areas of the world had been remarked by numerous authors since the 18th century, notably by the French Indologist Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron. Jaspers explicitly cited some of these authors, including Victor von Strauß (1859) and Peter Ernst von Lasaulx (1870). \nJasper's contribution was to claim that the Axial Age should be viewed as an objective empirical fact of history, independently of religious considerations. He argued that during the Axial Age, \"the spiritual foundations of humanity were laid simultaneously and independently in China, India, Persia, Judea, and Greece. And these are the foundations upon which humanity still subsists today\".\n\nHe identified a number of key thinkers as having had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. Jaspers held up this age as unique, and one to which the rest of the history of human thought might be compared.\n\nJaspers presented his first outline of the Axial age by a series of examples:\n\nJaspers described the Axial Age as \"an interregnum between two ages of great empire, a pause for liberty, a deep breath bringing the most lucid consciousness\". It has also been suggested that the Axial Age was a historically liminal period, when old certainties had lost their validity and new ones were still not ready. \n\nJaspers had a particular interest in the similarities in circumstance and thought of its figures. Similarities included an engagement in the quest for human meaning and the rise of a new elite class of religious leaders and thinkers in China, India and the Occident. \n\nThese spiritual foundations were laid by individual thinkers within a framework of a changing social environment. Jaspers argues that the characteristics appeared under similar political circumstances: China, India, the Middle East and the Occident each comprised multiple small states engaged in internal and external struggles.\nThe three regions all gave birth to, and then institutionalized, a tradition of travelling scholars, who roamed from city to city to exchange ideas. After the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period, Taoism and Confucianism emerged in China. In other regions, the scholars were largely from extant religious traditions; in India, from Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism; in Persia, from Zoroastrianism; in The Levant, from Judaism; and in Greece, from Sophism and other classical philosophies.\n\nMany of the cultures of the axial age were considered second-generation societies because they were built on the societies that preceded them.\n\nParshvanatha (23rd Tirthankara in the 9th century BCE) and Mahavira (24th Tirthankara in the 6th century BCE), known as the fordmakers of Jainism lived during this age. They propagated the religion of sramanas (previous Tirthankaras) and influenced Indian philosophy by propounding the principles of ahimsa (non-violence), karma, samsara and asceticism.\n\nBuddhism, also of the sramana tradition of India, was another of the world's most influential philosophies, founded by Siddhartha Gautama, or the Buddha, who lived during this period; its spread was aided by Ashoka, who lived late in the period.\n\nIn China, the Hundred Schools of Thought were in contention and Confucianism and Taoism arose during this era, and in this area it remains a profound influence on social and religious life.\n\nZoroastrianism, another of Jaspers' examples, is one of the first monotheistic religions and some believe it greatly influenced modern Abrahamic religions with such conceptions as the devil and Heaven/Hell. The exact date of Zoroaster's life is debated by scholars, with some, such as Mary Boyce, arguing that Zoroastrianism itself is significantly older. Others, such as William W Malandra and RC Zaehner, suggest that he may indeed have been an early contemporary of Cyrus living around 600 BC. However, Boyce and other leading scholars who once supported much earlier dates for Zarathustra/Zoroaster have recently changed their position on the time when he likely lived, so that there is an emerging consensus regarding him as a contemporary or near-contemporary of Cyrus the Great.\n\nJaspers' axial shifts included the rise of Platonism, which would later become a major influence on the Western world through both Christianity and secular thought throughout the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance.\n\nIn addition to Jaspers, the philosopher Eric Voegelin referred to this age as \"The Great Leap of Being\", constituting a new spiritual awakening and a shift of perception from societal to individual values. Thinkers and teachers like the Buddha, Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Parmenides, and Anaxagoras contributed to such awakenings which Plato would later call \"anamnesis\", or a remembering of things forgotten.\n\nDavid Christian notes that the first \"universal religions\" appeared in the age of the first universal empires and of the first all-encompassing trading networks.\n\nAnthropologist David Graeber has pointed out that \"the core period of Jasper's Axial age [...] corresponds almost exactly to the period in which coinage was invented. What's more, the three parts of the world where coins were first invented were also the very parts of the world where those sages lived; in fact, they became the epicenters of Axial Age religious and philosophical creativity.\" Drawing on the work of classicist Richard Seaford and literary theorist Marc Shell on the relation between coinage and early Greek thought, Graeber argues that an understanding of the rise of markets is necessary to grasp the context in which the religious and philosophical insights of the Axial age arose. The ultimate effect of the introduction of coinage was, he argues, an \"ideal division of spheres of human activity that endures to this day: on the one hand the market, on the other, religion.\"\n\nGerman sociologist Max Weber played an important role in Jaspers' thinking. Shmuel Eisenstadt argues in the introduction to \"The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations\" that Weber's work in his \"\", \"\" and \"Ancient Judaism\" provided a background for the importance of the period, and notes parallels with Eric Voegelin's \"Order and History\". Wider acknowledgement of Jaspers' work came after it was presented at a conference and published in \"Dædalus\" in 1975, and Jaspers' suggestion that the period was uniquely transformative generated important discussion amongst other scholars, such as Johann Arnason. In literature, Gore Vidal in his novel \"Creation\" covers much of this Axial Age through the fictional perspective of a Persian adventurer.\n\nShmuel Eisenstadt analyses economic circumstances relating to the coming of the Axial Age in Greece.\n\nReligious historian Karen Armstrong explored the period in her \"The Great Transformation\", and the theory has been the focus of academic conferences. Usage of the term has expanded beyond Jaspers' original formulation. Armstrong argues that the Enlightenment was a \"Second Axial Age\", including thinkers such as Isaac Newton, Sigmund Freud, and Albert Einstein. It has also been suggested that the modern era is a new axial age, wherein relationships between religion, secularity, and traditional thought are changing.\n\nThe validity of the concept has been called into question. In 2006 Diarmaid MacCulloch called the Jaspers thesis \"a baggy monster, which tries to bundle up all sorts of diversities over four very different civilisations, only two of which had much contact with each other during the six centuries that (after adjustments) he eventually singled out, between 800 and 200 BCE\". A comprehensive critique appears in Iain Provan's 2013 book \"Convenient Myths: The Axial Age, Dark Green Religion, and the World That Never Was\".\n\n\n"}

They began following a monastic horarium defined in the Rule of Saint Benedict, and chanting the Divine Office in Latin according to the 1962 \"Breviarium Monasticum\".\n\nUpon his arrival in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kansas City-Saint Joseph in 2005, Bishop Robert Finn said that vocations to the priesthood and religious life would be seen as a \"super-priority\" for his diocese. In March 2006, Finn invited the order to the diocese, who were established as a public association of the faithful with the new name \"Benedictines of Mary, Queen of Apostles\". \n\nIn September 2018, its priory was raised to abbey and their new Abbey Church was consecrated by Bishop Robert Finn. Mother Cecilia was the first abbess to received the Abbatial Blessing according to the traditional Pontificale in the United States.\n\nThe nuns sing together daily, typically for five hours per day, as part of their daily life of prayer. The group have released a number of recordings of their songs. Their debut recording \"Advent At Ephesus\", released at the end of 2012, reached number 2 on Billboard's Classical Traditional Music Chart and number 14 on the Classical Music Overall Chart. They were named Billboard's Classical Traditional Artist 2012 and 2013, the first order of nuns to win an award in the history of Billboard magazine.\n\nBoth their first two albums of their recorded chants and hymns reached number 1 on the classical traditional Billboard charts in 2013. As of 9 August 2013, the group's second album \"Angels and Saints at Ephesus\" reached the number 1 position on the Billboard traditional classical albums chart for 13 weeks, a record duration on that chart since 2006. As of July 2013, the album also reached number 3 on Billboard's Bestselling Internet Album Chart, number 7 on its Contemporary Christian and Christian Gospel charts, and number 127 on the \"\"Billboard\" 200\" weekly ranking of the 200 highest-selling music albums and EPs in the United States. The album has sold 49,000 copies in the United States as of February 2015.\n\nAlbum sales are used to improve the monastery and pay off the abbey's debt.

{"id": "2910063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2910063", "title": "Big Love", "text": "Big Love\n\nBig Love is an American television drama series that aired on HBO between March 2006 and March 2011. It stars Bill Paxton as the patriarch of a fundamentalist Mormon family in contemporary Utah who practices polygamy, with Jeanne Tripplehorn, Chloë Sevigny, and Ginnifer Goodwin portraying his wives. The series charts the family's life in and out of the public sphere in their Salt Lake City suburb, as well as their associations with a fundamentalist compound in the area. It features key supporting performances from Amanda Seyfried, Grace Zabriskie, Daveigh Chase, Matt Ross, Mary Kay Place, Bruce Dern, Melora Walters, and Harry Dean Stanton.\n\nThe series premiered in the United States on March 12, 2006, following the sixth-season premiere of the HBO series \"The Sopranos\". \"Big Love\" was a success for HBO, running for five seasons before concluding its run on March 20, 2011.\n\n\"Big Love\" received widespread critical acclaim, and earned several major awards and nominations throughout its run. The third season was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, and the first three were nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series - Drama. For acting, Chloë Sevigny won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in the series' third season, and Bill Paxton was nominated three times for his leading role. At the Emmys, Ellen Burstyn, Bruce Dern, Mary Kay Place, and Sissy Spacek were all nominated for their recurring roles, while the series' creators Mark V. Olsen and Will Scheffer won the .\n\nThe series has been the subject of articles in academic journals, including the \"Columbia Law Review,\" \"Law and Contemporary Problems,\" and \"Michigan Journal of Gender & Law.\" Several publications listed the series's first three seasons as among the best television of the decade 2000-09, and its final season ranked among the best-reviewed scripted series of 2011.\n\n\"Big Love\" was created by Mark V. Olsen and Will Scheffer, who also served as executive producers. Olsen and Scheffer spent nearly three years researching the premise of the show, with the intent of creating a \"fair, non-judgmental portrayal of polygamy in America.\" Olsen said that the family dynamics were key to the series' narrative, mixing family affection with tensions. \"It's that combustion, negotiating that mix of feelings that I think keeps an audience coming back for more.\"\n\nThe fictional fundamentalist group the United Effort Brotherhood (UEB) has characteristics similar to the historic United Effort Plan established by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS) and taken over by the state of Utah in 2005. The FLDS is one of the most prolific and well-known polygamist groups and identifies itself as the legitimate successor of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which officially discontinued polygamy in 1890.\n\nCreators Olsen and Scheffer included a drive through the twin FLDS towns of Hildale, Utah and Colorado City, Arizona as part of their research for the show.\nThe UEB has built its own temple on its Kansas compound. The raid on Juniper Creek is reminiscent of the Short Creek raid in 1953 when Arizona state police and National Guard troops took action against polygamists in Colorado City. Many of the businesses owned by the UEB are similar to businesses owned by the Kingston Clan, another Mormon fundamentalist church. The concept for the cable show was influenced by a 2003 article published in Utah on the Darger family who are Independent Fundamentalist Mormons.\n\nAlthough set in Utah, the series was primarily filmed at the Santa Clarita Studios in Valencia, California. The location used for filming \"Henrickson's Home Plus\" scenes was The All American Home Center in Downey, California.\n\nThe exterior scenes of the three homes that Bill owns were filmed on location on Shady Lane, in the small town of Fillmore, California.\n\nThe mall scenes from season one were filmed in the Fox Hills Mall, in Culver City, California. Other exterior shots were filmed in Downtown Salt Lake City, Utah and Sandy, Utah, as well as northeast Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe theme song for the final two seasons of the series was \"Home\", by the band Engineers. During the first three seasons, \"God Only Knows\", by The Beach Boys, played during the opening titles. The musical score for the series was composed by Anton Sanko. Mark Mothersbaugh composed music for the first season, while David Byrne was in charge of music during the second season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n style=\"border-spacing: 2px; border: 1px solid darkgray;\"\nKey\n\nIn Sandy, Utah, fundamentalist Mormon Bill Henrickson practices a polygamous marriage with his three wives: Barbara \"Barb\", Nicolette \"Nicki\", and Margene \"Margie.\" Bill owns and operates Home Plus, a local hardware store chain which earns the family considerable income, and allows him to support his wives and their seven children. Tensions rise within the family amidst the wives with the newly-introduced Margie, a former babysitter of Bill's and employee at his store—as well as between Bill and Roman Grant, Nicolette's father, who is an influential patriarch and prophet of Juniper Creek, the fundamentalist compound where Nicolette and Bill were raised. Meanwhile, Bill and Barb's eldest children, Ben and Sarah, individually deal with maintaining a façade to conceal their parents' polygamous marriage from their peers and community.\n\nBarb seeks independence by taking a job as a schoolteacher, while Nicki, a compulsive shopper, incurs nearly $60,000 in credit card debt, and Margie struggles to find footing in the family. Bill and his associate Don Embry, also a polygamist, continue to dispute with Roman over business holdings in Home Plus. Roman is aided by his sociopathic teenage bride Rhonda Volmer, as well as his son (and Nicolette's elder brother) Alby, a closeted homosexual and ardent follower of the United Effort Brotherhood (UEB), the priesthood of Juniper Creek. Bill, who was shunned from Juniper Creek as a teenager, is devastated when he discovers that his shunning was not caused by his parents, Frank and Lois, but by Roman, who feared Bill would usurp the prophecy.\n\nAfter deciding to follow through with her baptism, Margie discovers she is pregnant. Shortly after, Barb is awarded the title of \"Mother of the Year\" by the local government after daughter Teeny nominates her. Flattered, Barb goes to attend the award ceremony at the governor's mansion, but is disqualified before the crowd when the judges are informed that she is a polygamist.\n\nAfter the family's exposure, Barb goes into seclusion, and Margie suspects their neighbors, Pam and Carl, were responsible. Home Plus billboards are vandalized, and the tumult within the house results in Bill and Barb forgetting Nicki's anniversary, exacerbating tensions. Barb decides to begin taking classes at the University of Utah to earn a Master's degree. At Juniper Creek, Bill's sister-in-law, Wanda, is tried by the community for attempting to poison Alby to death; Bill's brother Joey, a former NFL player, turns himself into police to prevent Wanda from facing prison.\n\nSarah joins an ex-Mormon support group to voice her frustrations over her family life, and meets Scott, a twenty-something-year-old whom she begins dating. Rhonda escapes Juniper Creek and manipulates her way into staying with Sarah's friend and co-worker, Heather; she then begins manipulating and blackmailing Heather and her family in order to help forge a career as a singer. Wanda is released from a psychiatric institute after Alby's poisoning, and Lois attempts to persuade Joey to take a second wife, Kathy. Meanwhile, Nicki enrolls son Wayne in a Catholic school, and grows paranoid that he will be indoctrinated, while Bill develops an attraction to Ana, a Serbian immigrant who works at a local diner; Margie uncovers this and forges a friendship with Ana unbeknownst to Bill. At home, teenaged Ben confesses to Bill and Barb that he is having sex with his irreligious girlfriend, Bryn, and expresses interest in practicing polygamy himself.\n\nMeanwhile, Bill begins a business venture with Weber Gaming, a casino that operates on virtual currency, and is caught in the crossfires of a dispute between the Grant family and the Greenes, an underground polygamist family. Roman is ambushed by the Greenes and critically injured, leaving him hospitalized at the compound; Alby assumes the role of the compound leader and, with the help of wife Lura, extends Roman's convalescence by keeping him sedated. Joey begins to court Kathy, and Nicki holds a party for him, Kathy, and Wanda at their home. Meanwhile, Barb reunites with her estranged mother Nancy, and sister Cindy, on the occasion of Nancy's remarriage. Adaleen realizes Alby has been sedating Roman, and brings Roman to Bill's home seeking safety. Barb and Margie confess to neighbor Pam that they are polygamists.\n\nAfter Margie gives birth to Nell, Bill begins dating Ana formally. Roman is indicted on charges of rape and child sex abuse based on claims made by Alby, who is seeking to take his place. Posing as Margie, Nicki takes a job at the district attorney's office to help pay off her credit card debts, meanwhile seeking the state's evidence against her father. While cruising for sex at a rest stop, Alby is attacked by a stranger, and suspects Bill has put a hit on him, but it is revealed to be Adaleen, attempting to dissuade him of his same-sex attractions. Barb becomes concerned that her cervical cancer, treated with a hysterectomy years prior, may have recurred, but test results determine she is still in remission. Bill takes in his younger half-brother, Frankie, who has been kicked out of Juniper Creek, and it is revealed that Nicki has been on birth control for several years; meanwhile, Sarah discovers she is pregnant with Scott's child. Margie's alcoholic mother, Ginger, dies in an accident. Meanwhile, Bill pursues a business venture with Jerry Flute, a member of the Blackfoot tribe, on a casino.\n\nAdaleen bribes Rhonda with $30,000 if she refuses to testify against Roman, and Rhonda takes the money and flees to Los Angeles. Roman is acquitted of the charges. Bill marries Ana, but it is short-lived, as she divorces the family within a matter of days. The family make a cross-country pilgrimage to Cumorah, New York, visiting historical sites associated with Mormon pioneers en route. During the trip, Ginger's ashes are lost, and Barb finds Nicki's birth control pills, which she assumes are Sarah's. Nicki confesses they are hers. That night, Sarah suffers a miscarriage.\n\nNicki is persuaded to keep her job at the D.A.'s office by Ray, her boss who has a crush on her, but quits when Margie discovers she's using her identity. Sarah and Heather make plans to enroll at Arizona State University, but Sarah eventually backs out. Roman attempts to marry Kathy to Hollis Greene as punishment for her testifying against him. Roman chases her when she flees, and she dies in a car accident while trying to escape. After her death, Bill attempts to get the D.A. to charge Roman with murder. Bill seeks a document legitimizing polygamy in the LDS church from Cindy and Ted. In an investigation into the letter, Barb becomes formally excommunicated from the LDS church.\n\nLois and Frank attempt to rekindle their tumultuous marriage after Lois's extensive attempts to murder him. Nicki develops romantic feelings for Ray, but he inadvertently discovers she is Roman's daughter, and is married to Bill. Enraged over her dishonesty, Ray threatens to charge Nicki with obstruction of justice, and she goes to stay at the compound. She returns home to mend her marriage with Bill.\n\nRoman disappears, and the D.A. attempts to dismantle Juniper Creek. Fearing a witch-hunt, Bill decides to run for office against a stark anti-polygamy candidate as an open polygamist. Nicki takes in Cara Lynn, her daughter from a previous arranged marriage on the compound who has been raised by her father, J.J. (brother of Wanda) in Kansas. Alby begins a romantic relationship with Dale, a married attorney negotiating with Juniper Creek on behalf of the state. Sarah is married to Scott by Bill, and reunites with Heather. Adaleen invites Nicki to the compound where she reveals Roman's corpse, which she's been keeping in a meat freezer; Nicki urges her to inform the authorities. Joey and Nicki believe Bill is to be the next prophet of the compound.\n\nMargie begins a jewelry business sold via televised shopping. On the compound, Lois, Ben, and Kathy's sister JoDean begin an illicit business selling exotic birds smuggled from Mexico. Bill, Nicki, and Cara Lynn travel to Washington, D.C. where Bill attempts to get a land endorsement; there, he is met with the ire of Marilyn Densham, a venal lobbyist. Meanwhile, Barb takes over duties at the casino. Marilyn comes to Salt Lake City during the primaries and tries to forge a working relationship with Bill based on his business ventures, and both Margie and Ben are ostracized when it is revealed they have romantic feelings toward on another; Ben flees to the compound and joins Lois, Frank, and JoDean. Frank crashes a political party at Bill's casino, and Bill receives news he has won the nomination.\n\nBill and the wives find Ana working at an upscale restaurant and discover she is pregnant with Bill's child. Alby's feelings for Dale deepen and he rents an apartment for them to meet in; Lura discovers their affair and informs Dale's wife, leading Dale to commit suicide in the apartment. The Greenes kidnap Lois, Frank, and Ben in Mexico. Meanwhile, Sarah moves with Scott to Portland, Oregon, against Nicki and Barb's wishes. Bill arrives in Mexico to save Lois, Frank, and Ben from execution; Lois attacks Hollis with a machete, cutting off his arm. They drive him to a hospital to save him under the condition that Ben, Frank, and Lois are freed. Bill returns home safely with Ben. Barb discovers that Marilyn is in cahoots with the casino's opposition, leading Bill to confront and fire her. Nicki discovers she is infertile, and Margie marries Goran, Ana's new boyfriend, to prevent him from being deported.\n\nOn election day, Bill and Barb dispute over Bill's handling of a drug deal within the casino, and Marilyn discovers Bill is a polygamist. J.J. has a doctor lure Nicki to the compound, claiming she is pregnant. Wanda informs Bill that J.J. has impregnated Adaleen with her and J.J.'s child, and that Nicki is being tricked into having Cara Lynn's egg implanted into her. Adaleen breaks free and interrupts the procedure, and Nicki stabs J.J. with surgical scissors. That evening, Adaleen burns down the compound clinic with J.J. and his wife inside, killing them. Bill wins the election, and announces during a press interview that he is a polygamist, inviting each of the wives onstage.\n\nAfter his election, Bill establishes his own church at Juniper Creek, and seeks to reform the compound and dismantle the UEB against Alby's wishes. Meanwhile, he faces the ire of local government and the public. An open house invitation hosted by Bill and the wives is coldly received, though a group of fellow polygamists arrive at the end of the night. Barb and mother Nancy join a group focusing on Mormon mother-daughter relationships, and Barb comes to believe she possesses the priesthood, which Bill and Nicki vehemently challenge; Barb begins drinking alcohol, which also stuns the family. On Christmas Eve, Margie reveals that she was in fact sixteen when she married Bill, and had concealed her true age. Heather, who attended the holiday dinner with Ben, inadvertently tells her police officer father of Margie's revelation, which in turn launches an investigation against Bill for statutory rape. Lois is diagnosed with vascular dementia and Bill moves her into their home.\n\nNicki struggles to tell Cara Lynn that her father is dead, and Adaleen reveals she has been impregnatated with Cara Lynn and J.J.'s incestuous child. Alby begins a mission to \"purify\" the compound, leading his wife, Lura, to leave him. Meanwhile, Cara Lynn begins an illicit relationship with her math teacher, Greg, which Margie and Nicki uncover. Rhonda returns to Sandy with her new husband, Verlan, and their infant child. The two attempt to extort money from Alby for the past abuses Rhonda suffered at the hands of Roman, and Verlan begins offering sexual favors to Alby in exchange for money. In an effort to legally adopt Cara Lynn, Nicki requests that Barb formally divorce Bill in order for her and Bill to legally adopt her. Barb reluctantly agrees. Pam confides in Margie that she and Carl may be divorcing.\n\nWhile ice fishing with his sons, Don is attacked by a masked stranger and nearly dies; it is later revealed to be Verlan, working on behalf of Alby. Nicki decides to devote her time rescuing women from the compound. During a confrontation, Alby kidnaps Nicki and brings her to a secluded location to murder her. Nicki begs for her life, and he instead shoots Verlan to death, sparing Nicki. The wives prepare for the possibility that Bill may be indicted, and Bill is infuriated when he discovers Barb has been attending a reform-LDS church.\n\nAlby attempts to assassinate Bill at the state capitol, but his attempt is thwarted and Alby is imprisoned. As Bill's potential trial looms, Barb decides to join the reform-LDS church, and Margie considers making a mission to South America, leaving Nicki fearful she will be left alone. Meanwhile, Lois's dementia worsens significantly, and she is placed in an assisted living home. Bill proposes the legalization of polygamy in an effort to prevent the covert abuses that have occurred in compounds like Juniper Creek. Bill and Don lose ownership of Home Plus amidst the scandal. Barb is ultimately unable to follow through with her baptism, and instead joins the family at Juniper Creek where Bill gives an emotional Easter sermon.\n\nWhile the Henricksons prepare for Easter dinner, Frank helps Lois commit assisted suicide, recounting their life together while she dies in his arms. In his driveway, Bill is confronted by a mentally-ill Carl, who is infuriated over Bill's kind gesture of re-sodding his and Pam's front lawn. Carl shoots Bill in the chest. Barb, Nicki, and Margie rush to his aid, and perform a blessing over him as he bleeds to death on the ground.\n\nEleven months later, a memorial is held in Bill's honor, and Sarah returns home with Scott and her newborn son, who they've named after Bill. As Sarah and Scott prepare to fly back to Oregon, Margie also prepares to leave on her mission to South America. The wives emotionally embrace as Bill watches from the dining table.\n\nThe series' theme song for its first three seasons was \"God Only Knows\" by The Beach Boys. For the series' fourth and fifth seasons, the song \"Home\", performed by the British band Engineers, was adopted as the show's theme song along with a new title sequence. \"God Only Knows\" was covered by Natalie Maines for the closing of the series finale.\n\nDavid Byrne recorded a complete soundtrack to the second season, released as \"\" on August 19, 2008.\n\nReview aggregate Metacritic indicated positive critical response for all five seasons. The average scores for the first through fourth seasons were 72/100, 71/100, 79/100, and 70/100, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" The fifth and final season received an average score of 85/100, or \"universal acclaim\". Based on its overall Metaritic score of 75, \"Business Insider\" ranked the series at number 29 in its 2017 list of every HBO series ranked \"from best to worst.\"\n\nUpon its debut, reaction to the series was mixed-to-positive. Initial raves came from publications such as \"Time Magazine,\" \"The Wall Street Journal,\" and \"New York Daily News\" -- James Poniewozik described it as a \"first-rate drama\" and Dorothy Rabinowitz said it was \"seriously compelling.\" Publications such as \"Entertainment Weekly,\" \"The New Yorker,\" \"Variety,\" the \"Boston Globe,\" and \"The Hollywood Reporter\" were all positive as well. Notable detractors included Robert Lloyd of the \"Los Angeles Times,\" who said it ultimately \"didn't convince\"; Doug Elfman of the \"Chicago Sun-Times,\" who felt its quality didn't match its concept; and John Leonard of \"New York Magazine,\" describing it as \"more soapy than salacious.\"\n\nBy the second season, critical reception warmed. Maureen Ryan of \"The Huffington Post\" and noted critic Alan Sepinwall remained ambivalent towards the show; otherwise critics were uniformly positive. In particular, several critics noted improvements from season one. Gillian Flynn of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote, \"\"Big Love\" has dropped the last vestiges of its ostentatious quirkiness and fashioned itself into a rich and grounded family drama,\" and Diane Werts of \"Newsday\" said that \"'Big Love' does more this year than you might expect, and more richly, more provocatively, more dramatically and amusingly, too.\" The second season was cited among the best shows of 2007 by numerous publications, including \"PopMatters\", the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", \"Time Magazine\", \"Entertainment Weekly\" and NPR.\n\nSeason three vaulted \"Big Love\" to universal critical acclaim. Notably, Tim Stack of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the season's early episodes an 'A' grade, and Mary McNamara of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said, \"If there's a better written, better acted, more originally conceived show on television, I defy you to name it.\" After two years of popping up spottily on critics' 'Best Of' lists, season three was recognized as one of the top seasons of television from 2009. In aggregating Top 10 lists from every major television critic, Metacritic reported that 10 critics had cited the series, tying for the eighth-most mentions (and, in particular, \"Big Love\" ranked third on that list among series in their third season or later).\n\nThough only its first three seasons aired in the 2000s (decade), multiple critics cited \"Big Love\" as one of the best series of the decade. They include the \"Huffington Post\", \"Ain't It Cool News\" and \"The A.V. Club\", who wrote \"\"Big Love\" has proved to be one of the most ... earnest studies of religion and morality ever to air on television.\"\n\nReturning in 2010, \"Big Love\" was met with mixed critical response for a shorter fourth season. General consensus dictated that the series was focused too much on plot, with character development suffering as a result. \"The Washington Post\" identified a lack of energy in the actors, looking \"alternately confused and pooped, empty shells of the characters they used to play\". Putting it into perspective, Rob Owen of the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" wrote, \"In this new season the show is spinning off into too many directions. None, taken individually, is terrible, but altogether these myriad plots create a lack of focus.\" \"The A.V. Club,\" which a year earlier had cited the drama as one of the previous decade's top 20 shows, described the fourth season after its finale as \"The season that virtually obliterated \"Big Love\"'s dramatic credibility.\"\n\nWhen the series returned for its fifth and final season the next year, critical reaction was extremely enthusiastic. \"Big Love\" received the best early reviews of its entire run. Mary McNamara wrote, \"\"Big Love\" quickly reclaims its astonishing ability to balance the insightful and the absurd, hilarity and heartbreak and the personal with the political.\" Similar raves came from Nancy DeWolf Smith of \"The Wall Street Journal,\" who said the final season was \"mesmerizing\", and the \"New York Post,\" which awarded the final season a perfect four out of four stars. Overall, the final season of \"Big Love\" tied as the fourth-best reviewed returning show of 2011, trailing only \"Breaking Bad\", \"Louie\" and the animated comedy \"Archer\". It was the tenth-best reviewed scripted series of the year overall.\n\nResponse to the series finale, \"When Men and Mountains Meet,\" was passionate among top publications. Jace Lacob of the \"Daily Beast\" called it the \"perfect way to close out this series\" and described his reaction to it as \"emotional\". James Poniewozik wrote for \"Time Magazine\" that \"In the end ... \"Big Love\" came back full circle to the core relationships ... We closed on a moving if messy note for a moving if messy series.\" Mary McNamara, of the \"Los Angeles Times\" dubbed it \"a perfect finish to an astonishingly ambitious show that often careened through genre, narrative structure and believability like they were false walls on a stage\". In her rumination on the finale, Ginia Bellafante of \"The New York Times\" noted that \"[\"Big Love\"] was always at its most compelling as an indictment of the mindless spiritual avidity and the bizarre displays of self-exoneration that can go on in the name of faith,\" and celebrated the finale for committing to that theme. She also wrote that the series had \"achieved the resonance of [HBO's] other heralded series.\" Writing for TV Squad, Dr. Ryan Vaughn was less enthusiastic about the finale but said, \"I'm not going to let a great series be sullied with a mediocre finale.\" Finally, The A.V. Club awarded the series finale, and the series as a whole, a B+, writing that its first three seasons in particular qualified as \"remarkable television.\"\n\nIn March 2006, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), which ended practice of polygamy in 1890 and often distances itself from modern polygamist breakoffs, issued a public statement citing concerns over the program's depiction of abuse, polygamy, use of stereotypes, and television's depiction of moral and civic values in general. Among other things, the church stated, \"Despite its popularity with some, much of today's television entertainment shows an unhealthy preoccupation with sex, coarse humor and foul language. \"Big Love\", like so much other television programming, is essentially lazy and indulgent entertainment that does nothing for our society and will never nourish great minds.\" In March 2009, the LDS Church stated that HBO's writers, producers, and executives were displaying insensitivity to church members by choosing to display simulated segments of the LDS Church's Endowment ceremony in an episode of \"Big Love\". The LDS Church also stated that the show had continued to blur the distinction between the LDS Church and \"the show's fictional non-Mormon characters\".\n\nIn contrast to the statement made by the LDS church, several real fundamentalist Mormon polygamists spoke in favor of the series: In a 2006 interview in \"The New York Times\" with various polygamist wives, one noted: \"It's a more realistic view of a polygamous family that lives out in society than people have known. It can be seen as a viable alternative lifestyle between consenting adults.\"\n\nThe series did garner criticism from some members of the LDS church during its third season for an episode's depiction of an endowment ceremony, a sacred ritual in the church. Though the LDS church did not issue a statement, HBO made a public apology over the depiction.\n\nSince its premiere, \"Big Love\" has been the subject of several studies in the humanities and social sciences.\n\nDr. Cheryl Hanna explored \"the problem of categorical exclusions to the consent doctrine in private intimate relationships\" through the lens of \"Big Love\", specifically citing its \"beautifully explored\" tensions between individual autonomy and state interests. In her conclusion, she wrote \"the future of feminist legal theory depends on its ability to remain ambivalent about the tensions presented in the consent doctrine as applied to contexts such as polygamy, prostitution, sadomasochistic sex, obscenity, and domestic violence. \"Big Love\" seeks to persuade us to accept ambivalence and to be open to changing our minds because of the complicated nature of women's (and men's) lives; feminist legal theory ought to persuade us to do the same.\"\n\nFor the \"Columbia Law Review\", Dr. Adrienne D. Davis assessed legal debates surrounding polygamy after the premiere of \"Big Love\" and how it was being likened to same-sex marriage. She wrote, \"The highly acclaimed hit series self-consciously invites viewers to consider analogies between same-sex and polygamous families. In the show's much-anticipated second season, the invitation became more pointed and persistent, with intermittent references to 'coming out,' 'closeted families,' and 'the state' as repressively surveilling nonconforming 'big love.'\" However, she claimed that Hollywood and television critics' desire to interpret the polygamy in \"Big Love\" and beyond as representative of American \"quirky families\" was a miscue. Ultimately, she argues that the dichotomy presented by \"Big Love\" works when viewed in terms of \"intimacy liberty, privacy, autonomy, and agency, or even an incipient constitutional respect for 'sexual minorities.'\"; the very essence, as Davis notes and commends, of the series' themes.\n\nDr. Brenda Cossman examined \"Big Love\" closely in her study of \"migrating marriages\" for \"Law and Contemporary Problems\". In addition to asserting that \"Just as in \"Big Love\", same-sex marriage is never more than one degree away of separation from polygamy,\" she found that the series adds crucial insight to the understanding of marriages that exist between legal and cultural recognition. As she explains, \"These cases can be seen through the lens of ... \"Big Love\", in which marriages are produced as the culturally real in the here and the now, even when legal recognition remains elusive.\" By exploring the movement seeking to culturally legitimize same-sex marriage, she concluded \"Big Love\" served as a most powerful, unique allegory: \"\"Big Love\" plays on an even more decisive gap: polygamous marriages are not legal in Utah or anywhere else in the country. Yet the point and the poignancy of the show is to depict a 'real-life' family. Bill Hendrickson and his three wives struggle with all of the daily trials of contemporary family life: parenting, finances, intimacy, and sex. The sympathetic portrayal of their family is as culturally real, although it suffers by virtue of its nonlegal recognition.\"\n\n\"Big Love\" was also studied as a part of Andrew Atkinson's study of HBO programs and the post-secular humanistic themes they elicit. In writing of \"Big Love\", Atkinson too draws on the parallel between gay rights and polygamist rights illuminated by the series, but focuses more on the series' influential humanistic elements. In fact, he somewhat rebuffs earlier assertions made: \"The attention that is paid to the minute details of Mormon ritual, theology, and historical disputes demonstrates that HBO's writers are uncomfortable with the supposed dichotomy that constructs homosexuality as by default areligious.\" Atkinson focuses on the ending, interpreting Barb's blessing of Bill as a \"ritual innovation [that] indicates that FLDS Mormonism must shed the trappings of patriarchy if it wants to legitimate polygamy in a post-feminist society\", and the fall of Alby, the closet homosexual, as a powerful interpretation of \"the future theo-political and sexual tensions that Mormonism, and by extension, the broader American polity, will face as the post-secular matures\". In concluding, Atkinson makes the case that \"Big Love\" and other HBO shows like \"The Sopranos\", \"The Wire\" and \"Six Feet Under\" \"contribute to a fuller conception of humanity\" than other forms of art and entertainment.\n\nSeries\n\nActing\n\nDirecting\n\nWriting\n\n\n"}

Heart in the context is related with hospitality, the concept is based on giving the most expensive thing of that time which was salt to the awaited guest. Nowadays it is not commonly practiced during daily life.\n\nWhen important, respected, or admired guests arrive, they are presented with a loaf of bread (usually a korovai) placed on a \"rushnyk\" (embroidered ritual cloth). A salt holder or a salt cellar is placed on top of the bread loaf or secured in a hole on the top of the loaf. On official occasions, the \"bread and salt\" is usually presented by young women dressed in national costumes (e.g., sarafan and kokoshnik).\n\nThe tradition gave rise to the Russian word that expresses a person's hospitality: \"khlebosolny\" (literally: \"bready-salty\"). In general, the word \"bread\" is associated in Russian culture with hospitality, bread being the most respected food, whereas salt is associated with long friendship, as expressed in a Russian saying \"to eat a pood of salt (together with someone)\". Also historically the Russian Empire had a high salt tax that made salt a very expensive and prized commodity (see also the Moscow uprising of 1648).\nThere also is a traditional Russian greeting \"Khleb da sol!\" (\"Хлеб да соль!\" \"Bread and salt!\"). The phrase is to be uttered by an arriving guest as an expression of good wish towards the host's household. It was often used by beggars as an implicit hint to be fed, therefore a mocking rhymed response is known: \"Khleb da sol!\" — \"Yem da svoy!\" (\"Хлеб да соль\" — \"ем да свой!\" \"Bread and salt!\" — \"I am eating and it is my own!\").\nIn the Russian Orthodox Church, it is customary to greet the bishop at the steps of the church when he arrives for a pastoral visit to a church or monastery with bread and salt.\n\nBread and salt (, transliterated \"hlyab i sol\") is a traditional Bulgarian custom expressing hospitality, showing that the guest is welcomed. The bread and salt is commonly presented to guests by a woman. Bulgarians usually make a certain type of bread for this occasion called \"pogacha\", which is flat, fancy, and decorated. Regular bread is not usually used, although it may have been historically, but \"pogacha\" is much more common in this custom.\n\nUsually, guests are presented with the \"pogacha\", and the guest is supposed to take a small piece, dip into the salt and eat it. This custom is common for official visits regardless of whether the guest is foreign or Bulgarian. One notable example of this custom is when the Russians came to liberate Bulgaria from the Ottomans at the end of the 19th century. A common scene from that period was of a Bulgarian village woman welcoming Russian soldiers with bread and salt as a sign of gratitude.\n\nThis tradition is still practiced in the Czech Republic (\"chléb a sůl\") and Slovakia (\"chlieb a soľ\") for special occasions, for example, when presidents from other countries are visiting. It is not commonly practiced during daily life.\n\nIn Poland, welcoming with bread and salt (\"\"chlebem i solą\") is often associated with the traditional hospitality (\"staropolska gościnność\"\") of the Polish nobility (\"szlachta\"), who prided themselves on their hospitality. A 17th-century Polish poet, Wespazjan Kochowski, wrote in 1674: \"O good bread, when it is given to guests with salt and good will!\" Another poet who mentioned the custom was Wacław Potocki. The custom was, however, not limited to the nobility, as Polish people of all classes observed this tradition, reflected in old Polish proverbs. Nowadays, the tradition is mainly observed on wedding days, when newlyweds are greeted with bread and salt by their parents on returning from the church wedding.\n\nIn the Republic of Macedonia, this tradition still is practiced occasionally as a custom expressing hospitality. A certain type of bread, similar to that in Bulgaria and also by the same name — \"pogača\" (from Latin \"panis focacius\") is prepared.\n\nThe famous Macedonian and ex-Yugoslav ethno-jazz-rock group of even more famous world music guitarist, Vlatko Stefanovski, had the name \"Leb i Sol\", which means \"bread and salt\" and speaks itself about this term of hospitality as something basic and traditional.\n\nAs in Slavic countries, bread and salt is a traditional Romanian custom expressing hospitality, showing that the guest is welcomed.\n\nBread and salt (\"hleb i so\") is a traditional welcoming of guests, being customary to offer it before anything else, with bread having an important place in Serbian tradition, used in rituals. The traditional bread, \"pogača\", is a symbol of family unity and goodness, and salt prosperity and security for the guest. It is part of the state protocol, in use since the Principality of Serbia, often used when welcoming foreign representatives.\n\nIn Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, bread and salt were traditionally given as a symbol of blessing for a new home. Instead of white bread, dark fiber-rich rye bread was used.\n\nBread and salt are given away for different reasons:\n\nIn northern Germany and Bohemia (Czech Republic) bread and salt are traditionally put into the diaper of a newborn. In Transylvania bread and salt are served to protect against weather demons.\n\nArab culture also have a concept of \"bread and salt\" (خبز وملح or عيش وملح) but not in the context of welcoming, but as an expression of alliance by eating together, symbolizing the rapprochement between two persons. Eating bread and salt with a friend is considered to create a moral obligation which requires gratitude. This attitude is also expressed by Arab phrases such as \"there are bread and salt between us\" (بيننا خبز وملح or بيننا عيش وملح), and \"salt between them\" (بينهما ملح) which are terms of alliance.\n\nThe practice exists also among Jews in the Diaspora and in Israel. The ceremony of Kiddush includes dipping a piece of Challah in salt. Bread and salt are also used in welcoming ceremonies and given to the welcomed persons. It is common in Israel for a landlord or real estate agent to leave bread and salt in the home to welcome new tenants, as these should be the first things brought into a new home.\n\nIt is an important part of the culture. It is given on all good occasions: during weddings, house warming parties, and childbirth.\n\nIn Northern England and Scotland the tradition is observed on New Year's Day, where the first individual to enter a house may be required by tradition to bring bread, salt and coal.\n\nWith the advent of the Soviet space program, this tradition has spread into space, where appropriately small packages of bread and salt are used nowadays. It was observed at the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project and the Salyut programme, when crackers and salt tablets were used in the spaceship. Bread chunks and salt were a welcome at the Mir space station, a tradition that was extended on the International Space Station. Bread and salt are also a welcome for cosmonauts returning to Earth.\n\nThe custom of serving bread and salt to guests is a recurring reference in George R. R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" novels, where the welcome ritual serves as not only as a Westerosi tradition of hospitality but also a formal assurance of \"guest right\", a sacred bond of trust and honor guaranteeing that nobody in attendance, hosts and guests alike, shall be harmed. Violating the guest right is widely considered among the highest moral crimes, an affront worthy of the worst damnation, rivaled only by kinslaying. Game of Thrones, the associated television series, prominently features the tradition in season three, episode 9, \"The Rains of Castamere.\" Rival noble houses Stark and Frey are meeting to discuss a marriage alliance. The Starks fear betrayal by the Freys, but their worries are assuaged when the most important members of each house eat bread and salt from the same platter, establishing guest right, although the Freys eventually break the oath by murdering most of the Starks present at the wedding.\n\nIn Season 2, Episode 4 of Peaky Blinders, Alfie Solomons offers Charles Sabini bread and salt as Sabini offers a white flag of truce. \n\nRudyard Kipling referenced bread and salt in a number of works. In \"The Ballad of East and West\", leavened bread and salt is mentioned as binding an oath of blood brothership. At the beginning of \"Puck of Pook's Hill\" Puck establishes his credentials with the child protagonists by asking them to sprinkle plenty of salt on their shared meal. \"\"That'll show you the sort of person I am.\"\n\nIn Rosemary Sutcliff's historical novel Outcast, bread and salt is referred to as a sign of belonging to a tribe: \"You are my people, my own people, by hearth fire and bread and salt\".\n\nIn the \"Count of Monte Cristo\" by Alexandre Dumas, Chapter 72 is titled \"Bread and Salt.\" The character Mercedes attempts to coax the main character into eating fruit, as part of an Arabian custom to ensure that those who have shared food and drink together under one roof would be eternal friends. \n\nIn D.R. Merrill's 2014 science fiction novel \"Lamikorda\" the Alplai greet the leaders of the Terran colony vessel with a ritual meal of foods representing their major cultures, including bread from the Saakh; one of the Terrans then presents a small container of sea salt, which is graciously accepted and added as a symbol of their friendship.\n\nBread and salt are given as a housewarming gift in one scene of the 1946 film \"It's A Wonderful Life\".\n\n"}

According to Jain texts, clairvoyance (\"avadhi jnana\") based on birth is possessed by the celestial beings.\n\nAccording to Jain texts, the celestial beings are of four orders (classes):-\n\nThere are of ten, eight, five and twelve classes up to the Heavenly beings (\"kalpavasis\"). There are ten grades in each of these classes of celestial beings, the Lord (Indra), his Equal, the Minister, the courtiers, the bodyguards, the police, the army, the citizens, the servants, and the menials.\n\nThe abode of Devas is \"Svarga\" (heaven). According to Jain texts, persons with right faith (except those whose bondage of life-karma has been accomplished prior to their attainment of right belief) are reborn among the fourth order of \"devas\" and not among the three lower orders, namely the Residential, the Peripatetic and the Stellar \"devas\". Those practising restraint with attachment and restraint-cum-non-restraint are also characterized by right belief. Hence they are reborn in the higher heavens of \"Saudharma Kalpa\" and so on and not among the three lower orders of celestial beings.

Her parents, Sol Fineman and Jeanette Efron, were Polish Jews who had recently immigrated to the United States.\n\nShe attended the Music and Art High School in New York, New School for Social Research, and then the City College of New York, graduating in 1958.\n\nThere she met David Antin, a poet who would become her husband in 1961. She studied acting and had some roles, including performing in a staged reading with Ossie Davis at the first NAACP convention. She and her husband moved to San Diego in 1968.\n\nShe taught at the University of California at Irvine from 1974–79, and from 1979 was professor of visual arts at the University of California at San Diego.\n\nWhen she began her artistic career in New York, she started off as a painter and later turned to making assemblages, but starting in the 1960s she began to do the conceptual projects that would become her focus. The first was \"Blood of a Poet Box\" (1965-1968), in which she took blood samples from poets and put them on slides. The work, which was inspired by Jean Cocteau’s film \"Blood of a Poet\", eventually held 100 samples, including blood from Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and is in the collection of the Tate Modern.\n\nIn 1969, she created a portrait, \"Molly Barnes\", out of \"a lush lavender bath rug, a noisy electric Lady Schick razor, a patch of spilled talcum powder and a scattering of pink and yellow pills.\" \"Molly Barnes\" was just one of a series of \"semantic portraits of people, sometimes real, some-times fictional, [made] out of configurations of brand-new consumer goods\" that Antin created.\n\n\"100 Boots\" is Antin's best-known conceptual work. In this project, she set up 100 boots in various configurations and settings, photographed them, and created 51 postcards of the images that were mailed to hundreds of recipients around the world from 1971-73. \"100 Boots\" relied on the recipients to remember and construct the boots' adventures, as the postcards were mailed out at intervals ranging from 3 days to 5 weeks \"depending upon what [Antin] took to be the 'internal necessities' of the narrative.\" It documents the boots in a mock picaresque photo diary, beginning at the Pacific Ocean and ending in New York City, where their journey was presented in an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art.\n\nIn a famous performance work of 1972, \"Carving: A Traditional Sculpture\", Antin photographed her naked body at 148 successive stages during a month of crash-dieting. The somber, almost classical work is a staple of early feminist art, according to the New York Times.\n\nIn \"The Eight Temptations\", 1972, Antin poses in mock histrionic gestures, resisting the temptation to eat snack foods that would violate her diet. In the 1970s/80s, she created several videos in which she played invented personae, including an Elizabethan-style king, a Romantic-era ballerina, a contemporary black movie star called Eleanora Antinova, and Eleanor Nightingale, a character that is a combination of Florence Nightingale and the artist herself.\n\nIn 1974, Antin described these impersonations as part of her overarching interest in the transformational nature of the self: \"I was interested in defining the limits of myself. I consider the usual aids to self-definition—sex, age, talent, time and space—as tyrannical limitations upon my freedom of choice.\"\n\nFrom the 70s until the 90s Antin embodied multiple alter egos in a project that she called \"Selves\" that implemented through several art forms. This project encompassed four videos: \"The King\" (1972), \"The Ballerina and the Bum\" (1974), \"The Adventures of a Nurse\" (1976), and \"From the Archives of Modern Art\" (1987).\n\nMore recently, Antin completed two large scale photographic series inspired by Roman history and mythology: \"The Last Days of Pompeii\", 2002, and \"Roman Allegories\", 2005. Her work was profiled in Season Two of the PBS series .\n\nShe has had dozens of solo exhibitions and has been represented in countless group exhibitions, including at the Hirshhorn Museum, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the Kunsthalle Wien, and documenta 12 in Kassel. Her work is in the permanent collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Jewish Museum, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, among others.\n\nHer work is largely concerned with issues of identity and the role of women in society. \"I was determined to present women without pathos or helplessness,\" she wrote in a feminist artist statement for the Brooklyn Museum.\n\nIn a 2009 interview, Antin described her path to becoming an artist: \"When I was a kid, I didn't know what kind of artist I was. I knew I was an artist, I just didn't know if I was an actor, I didn't know if I was a writer, I didn't even know if I was a painter. I was fortunate that I grew up as an artist in a time when all the barriers were falling down. It was a time of invention and discovery. I was lucky.\"\n\nIn 2013, Antin published an autobiographical novel, \"Conversations with Stalin\", about \"a young girl's struggle to find her way from her crazy dysfunctional family of first generation Jewish Stalinist immigrants\", and \"her desperate, endearing, often hilarious quest for art, self, revolution and sex, abetted by a kindly avuncular Stalin dispensing bizarre advice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

In Shia Islam, women are often revered as saints if they are close relatives to one of the Twelver Imams. Fatima Masumeh is therefore honored as a saint, and her shrine in Qom is considered one of the most significant Shi'i shrines in Iran. Every year, thousands of Shi'i Muslims travel to Qom to honor Fatima Masumeh and ask her for blessings.\n\nAlso buried within the shrine are three daughters of the ninth Twelver Shī‘ah Imām Muhammad al-Taqī.\n\nThe mosque consists of a burial chamber, three courtyards and three large prayer halls, totalling an area of . The three prayer halls are named: \"Tabātabā'ī\", \"Bālā Sar\", and \"A‘dham\".\n\nThough Shi'i theology formally states that the relatives of the Imams, or imamzadehs, hold a lower status than the Imams, popular Shi'ism still strongly venerates imamzadehs. In Iran, there are many more burial places of the Imams' relatives than there are for the Imams themselves. Imamzadehs are considered to be close to God and religiously pious because of their close relation to Imams. Shi'is commonly travel on pilgrimages to shrines of imamzadehs, such as the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh, the sister of the 8th Imam 'Ali al-Rida, in Qom, Iran. Men and women seek cures to ailments, solutions to problems, and forgiveness of sins at these sites. Many hadiths, or teachings, are recorded from Shi'i Imams praising the veneration of Fatima Masumeh, and proclaiming that those who make a pilgrimage to her Shrine will \"certainly be admitted to heaven.\"\n\nFatima Masumeh's Shrine in Qom is crowded every day of the year with Shi'i men, women, and children from all around the world. Some stay for hours or days praying at the mosque and circumambulating her tomb. The economy of Qom has become reliant on this pilgrimage for the tourism it brings. In turn, Qom has remained conservative and traditional to maintain a pious environment for pilgrims. Many miracles have been recorded as taking place at this shrine, and they are documented in a special office within the shrine complex. Some are published in the shrines monthly newspaper, the Payam-e Astan.\n\nPilgrims at the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh follow rituals that have been passed down for centuries. Imam Ali al-Rida, Fatima Masumeh's brother, outlined these ritual acts as he described the way he visited her Shrine. The prayer Imam al-Rida dictated to his sister continues to be part of the pilgrimage. Since the Safavid period, additional rituals have been added that are now typical for many Shi'i pilgrimages including ritual washing beforehand, dressing in perfumed clothing, and entering the site with one's right foot.\n\nSince the beginning of Qom's history in the 7th century, the city has been associated with Shi'ism and set apart from the Sunni caliphate. Many Shi'i hadiths referred to Qom as a \"place of refuge for believers,\" calling it a deeply religious place. After Fatima Masumeh's death in Qom and the construction of her Shrine, scholars began to gather in Qom and the city gained its reputation for religious learning. Today, Qom is still noted for its religious seminaries and organizations.\n\nFatima Masumeh died in Qom in 201 A.H. as she travelled to join her brother, Imam Ali al-Rida in Khorasan. The caravan she travelled in was attacked in Saveh by the Abbasid Sunnis, and 23 of Fatima Masumeh's family and friends were killed (Jaffer). Fatima Masumeh was then poisoned by a woman from the Sunni enemies, fell ill, and asked to be taken to Qom, where she died. Fatima Masumeh's host in Qom buried her in his plot of land.\n\nThe style of Fatima Masumeh's Shrine has developed over many centuries. At first, her tomb was covered with a bamboo canopy. Fifty years later, this was replaced by a more durable domed building, at the request of the daughter of Imam Muhammad at-Taqī, Sayyida Zaynab. The family of Sayyida Zainab later added a further two domes to the Shrine. These architectural projects marked the beginning of female patronage of the tomb of Fatima Masumeh.\n\nIn 1519, Tajlu Khanum, the wife of Shah Isma'il I, led a project to improve the drainage around the Shrine, embellish the Shrine with an iwan and two minarets, and reconstruct the tomb chamber as a domed octagon. During the Safavid dynasty, the women of this family were very active in embellishing the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh. In times of war, Safavid royal women found refuge in Qom, and likely compared their situation to that of Fatima Masumeh. These women donated beautiful fabrics and other items to the Shrine. Shah Abbas I of the Safavids did not patronize the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh as much as he did other shrines of Imams, but he did offer books to the Shrine's seminary library. Over the years, many Safavids of royal birth were buried close to the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh.\n\nFrom 1795-1796, Fath-Ali Shah Qajar converted two Safavid \"sahn\" or courtyards into one large courtyard and, in 1803, fixed the golden dome. In 1883, Amin al-Sultan added the new \"sahn e-jadid\" or \"New Court\" to the Shrine complex.\n\nDuring Ayatollah Khomeini's 1979 Iranian Revolution, Qom was named \"the birthplace\" of this movement. Khomeini studied in Qom and lived there at the beginning and end of the Revolution. Aspects of the culture of Qom, including the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh, were used to unite the Iranian people over significant historical and mythical events. Khomeini used images of the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh in posters, money, and stamps created during the Revolution. Khomeini also constructed an addition to the Shrine of Fatima Masumeh and added more space for pilgrims. In addition, the tomb of Ayatollah Khomeini utilizes architectural elements that are similar to Fatima Masumeh's Shrine, such as the golden dome. See Mausoleum of Khomeini.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He attended Holyrood Secondary School in Glasgow. After leaving school, he worked as a library assistant over the summer and attended Langside College. He then studied Urban Planning at Aston University for a year before leaving and beginning a BA in English Literature at the University of Sussex. He graduated from university aged 22 and his first job was working in a mental health hospital. He then went to a teacher training college in Edinburgh and had placements in schools, but by then he was already performing as a stand-up comedian. He gained his big break after performing at The Stand Comedy Club in Edinburgh, a venue that has also helped launch the careers of Stewart Lee, Johnny Vegas, Peter Kay, Dara Ó Briain and Michael McIntyre.\n\nBoyle was a regular on the BBC panel show \"Mock the Week\" from its first episode on 5 June 2005 until 17 September 2009. A show in which the panel comment humorously on various news stories from the British media, \"Mock the Week\" is hosted by Dara Ó Briain, who in an episode of \"Live at the Apollo\" referred to Boyle as \"the dark heart of \"Mock the Week\".\" He is known for his morbid sense of humour, which plays on negative images of celebrities, politicians, and society (particularly his home country of Scotland). On 2 October 2009, Boyle announced via the \"Mock the Week\"s Facebook fan page that he was leaving the show to concentrate on other projects. Boyle has since criticised both the show's production team and the BBC Trust. He claims that the show did not cover enough major news stories, and was too restrictive on his risqué comedy act because the producers and the BBC Trust were afraid of \"frightening the horses\". He is seen in archive footage of \"Mock the Week\" on the 2009 Christmas Special, which aired on 22 December 2009, as a series of \"Best Bits and Festive Clips\", in a compilation celebrating the show's 100th episode on 5 July 2012 as well as in archive footage on the 2012 Christmas Special, which aired on 27 December 2012.\n\nIn October 2009, Boyle piloted a sketch and stand-up show for Channel 4, entitled \"Deal with This, Retards\" to be produced by RDF Scotland subsidiary the Comedy Unit. Boyle mentioned on \"Friday Night with Jonathan Ross\" that the original title of the show had been dropped, due to its offensive nature, and been renamed \"Tramadol Nights\" and aired from the end of November 2010. An official page launched via Channel 4's official website, which confirmed that the show's full name is \"Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights\" and the series was made up of six episodes. Boyle caused controversy on the show with his comments about Katie Price and Dwight Yorke's disabled son Harvey.\n\nOn 21 August 2011, it was revealed that Channel 4 had given Boyle permission to record a pilot for a topical talk show in October of that year, which would be called \"Frankie Boyle's Rehabilitation Programme\" (despite the controversy surrounding \"Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights\"). Channel 4 head of comedy Shane Allen told the press that \"it's very much like \"Parkinson\" or \"Wogan\", but with paedo jokes\" and that the show would feature Frankie \"in a studio, riffing off the audience a bit with some people challenging what he says\".\n\n\"The Boyle Variety Performance\" was broadcast on 19 August 2012 and featured Boyle with guests Rob Delaney, Nick Helm, Katherine Ryan and Tom Stade. A few days after the show was broadcast, Boyle attracted criticism after he posted jokes on Twitter about the 2012 Summer Paralympics.\n\nIn 2014, Frankie Boyle starred in the short comedy film \"Gasping\" for BBC Scotland, written by Greg Hemphill. The title refers to an expression in Scottish English, communicative of an irresistible compulsion to do something, such as smoke a cigarette; or, as here, to drink alcohol. The short feature, an at-times-farcical but generally deadpan treatment of a man's attempted recovery from alcoholism.\n\n\"Frankie Boyle's Referendum Autopsy\" was released on 28 September 2014, and \"Frankie Boyle's Election Autopsy\" was released on 17 May 2015, through BBC iPlayer. Featuring guests Katherine Ryan and Sara Pascoe, Boyle dissected the Scottish independence referendum, 2014 and general election. \"Frankie Boyle's American Autopsy\" dissected the buildup and fallout of the United States presidential election, tackling topics such as feminism, entertainment, propaganda, and guns. Special guests include Sara Pascoe, Katherine Ryan, Michelle Wolf, Desiree Burch, and Richard Osman.\n\nA show similar to his BBC iPlayer exclusive \"autopsy\" shows, Boyle returned to TV on BBC Two, with his \"Frankie Boyle's New World Order\", which follows a very similar structure to the aforementioned programmes, where Frankie makes two statements, and discusses them with his guests. The difference is that the studio audience do not vote on if they agree with that statement. The show premiered on 8 June 2017.\n\nA sitcom set in a small regional theatre starring David Mitchell as a happy-go-lucky writer with writer's block written by Frankie Boyle and Steven Dick, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 5 June 2014.\n\nOn 1 October 2009, Boyle's autobiography \"My Shit Life So Far\" was released, published by HarperCollins. His second book \"Work! Consume! Die!\" was released in October 2011. Boyle's third book, \"Scotland's Jesus: The Only Officially Non-racist Comedian\", was released in the UK on 24 October 2013.\n\nIn October 2007 Boyle embarked on a stand-up tour of Britain, playing over 100 dates and enjoying a sold-out run that was extended through until December 2008. Boyle said that he planned to quit stand-up before he turned 40, had written his final tour and plans to do more television work after this. Boyle performed the tour, entitled \"I Would Happily Punch Every One of You in the Face\" between March and December 2010.\n\nOn 21 November 2011, at a \"Meet the Comedians\" session in the Apple Store, Regent Street with Jimmy Carr, Boyle announced he was doing another tour entitled \"The Last Days of Sodom\", despite intending \"I Would Happily Punch Every One of You in the Face\" to be his final one. He mentioned the tour will not be as long as its predecessor. His website has stated it will run from July to December 2012 with more dates to be added. Tickets went on sale in December 2011.\n\nOn 10 November 2008, Boyle's first DVD was released, featuring a sell-out stand-up performance given at London's Hackney Empire and some additional material, including a documentary about the tour, entitled \"Fuck You Scotland\", and some sketches from the BBC Three comedy \"Rush Hour\". The DVD was described by WhatDVD.net as \"certainly not one to watch with your grandparents – not unless they are pretty open-minded!\"\n\nBoyle has also featured in three DVD compilations of material from \"Mock the Week\". The compilations, entitled \"Too Hot for TV\", include material deemed too offensive for broadcast on TV and uncut versions of several full episodes. Boyle's second live DVD, \"If I Could Reach Out Through Your TV and Strangle You I Would\", was released on 15 November 2010.\n\nOn 16 July 2009, Boyle's first podcast was released. Entitled \"Mock the Week Musings\", the podcast is a recording of Boyle testing the material he has written for \"Mock the Week\" to a London audience. Boyle comments on his material throughout and often informs the audience that certain jokes are not going into the show due to their reaction (or lack thereof), and the podcast carries an explicit content warning. The recording includes some audience interaction, with Boyle offering to test some of his new \"put-downs\" on the crowd.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2015, Boyle, along with Canadian comedian Glenn Wool hosted a number of editions of a podcast known as Freestyle, which involved Boyle and Wool speaking about topical and controversial news stories, including Madeleine McCann, Bill Cosby, and obscure takes on popular culture.\n\nIn September 2010, Boyle began publishing his comic strip \"Rex Royd\" in the launch issue of \"CLiNT\" magazine, co-written with comedian Jim Muir and with artwork by Michael Dowling. The story follows a Lex Luthor-style newspaper magnate with a super-villain alter-ego. Initially, the strip ran for first four issues of \"CLiNT\". The strip resumed again in November 2011, until the final issue in August 2013, when publisher Titan announced that \"CLiNT\" was ending.\n\nBoyle appeared as himself in the video game \"\" (2009), in a stand-up routine at Liberty City's Split Sides Comedy Club. He appeared on Real Radio Wales's weekly comedy show \"Comedy Nighthorse\" on 19 October 2011. Boyle writes satire and opinion pieces for the British newspaper The Guardian.\n\nBoyle has regularly been involved in public controversies due to the acerbic nature of his humour.\n\nBoyle managed to attract criticism in August 2008 when complaints were received about comments he made regarding British Olympic swimmer Rebecca Adlington on \"Mock the Week\", saying that she \"looks like someone who's looking at themselves in the back of a spoon\". The BBC ruled that the jokes were indeed \"humiliating\" and \"risked offending the audience\", while also calling Boyle \"a brilliant member of the team\". Despite this, Adlington's agent said that simply admitting mistakes was not enough, saying: \"By giving Frankie Boyle a rebuke they fail to discourage others from doing the same.\" Adlington later went on to comment on this issue.\n\nIn October 2008, during \"The Russell Brand Show\" prank telephone calls row, Boyle found himself in the midst of a scandal when the BBC broadcast a \"Mock the Week\" repeat in which he made a joke about the Queen. Whilst pretending to be the Queen in the \"Scenes We'd Like To See\" segment of \"Mock The Week\", Boyle said \"I am now so old, my pussy is haunted\". This caused many to complain about the state that the BBC had come to, with Conservative MP David Davies calling the joke a \"disgracefully foul comment\". Boyle was eventually cleared of any misconduct by the BBC Trust, although they called the comment \"sexist and ageist\".\n\nIn a performance on his 2010 tour, Boyle interrupted a \"long, seemingly semi-improvised skit\" about Down syndrome by challenging a woman in the front row who seemed uncomfortable with the material. The audience member explained that her five-year-old daughter had the condition and strongly criticised Boyle's portrayal of people with Down syndrome. Mencap spokesman Ismail Kaji said that the comments could be misconstrued and seen as \"no different to bullying\".\n\nIn April 2010, the BBC Trust's Editorial Standards Committee apologised for a joke made by Boyle on Radio 4 panel show \"Political Animal\" in which he likened the situation in Palestine to \"a cake being punched to pieces by a very angry Jew\". Boyle also made another joke where he said that he had \"been studying Israeli Army martial arts. I now know 16 ways to kick a Palestinian woman in the back\". In response, Boyle published a letter in which he criticised the Trust's \"cowardly rebuke of my jokes about Palestine\" and reprinted the jokes in question. He then criticised the BBC for not broadcasting a humanitarian appeal during the 2008–2009 Gaza War, saying that it was \"tragic for such a great institution but it is now cravenly afraid of giving offence and vulnerable to any kind of well drilled lobbying.\" Boyle then said that the situation in Palestine \"seems to be, in essence, apartheid\", concluding that he had reached this position after watching a documentary about life in Palestine that he said had driven him to tears.\n\nIn 2018, Boyle accused BBC television producers of \"editing out\" comments he made on \"New World Order\" about Palestinian deaths on the Gaza border and his joke about \"Israel being an Apartheid state”.\n\nIn December 2010, both Katie Price (a.k.a. Jordan) and Peter Andre were said to have been left \"absolutely disgusted and sickened\" by a joke that was made on \"Frankie Boyle's Tramadol Nights\" about Price's heavily disabled son, Harvey. On the show, Boyle said: \"Apparently Jordan and Peter Andre are fighting each other over custody of Harvey. Well eventually one of them will lose ... and have to keep him.\" Then he added: \"I have a theory that Jordan married a cage fighter (Alex Reid) because she needed someone strong enough to stop Harvey from fucking her.\"\n\nAndre's representative also responded to the comments made by Boyle and said \"We're all disgusted by these comments. Peter is angry and very upset at Harvey being mocked in this way. Children, especially a disabled youngster, should be off-limits.\" Both confirmed that they had sought legal action and wrote a complaint to Channel 4 regarding Boyle's jokes with Price saying: \"To bully this unbelievably brave child is despicable; to broadcast it is to show a complete and utter lack of judgement. I have asked my lawyers to write to Channel 4.\" Ofcom confirmed that Price issued a complaint and accordingly launched an investigation into the programme. In April 2011, Ofcom ruled Channel 4 had breached broadcasting rules by transmitting the material in question but did not require the network to broadcast an apology saying that it was an \"erroneous decision on a matter of editorial judgment on the broadcaster's part\". Price criticised the decision not to require a broadcast apology.\n\nBoyle discussed the material onstage at a charity gig some months later, saying that the joke was intended to highlight how Price exploited her son, and that he felt the two aspects of Price's media profile, \"her disabled son and her sexuality\", did not belong together. He rejected comments that the joke may have led to playground bullying, saying that \"I find it hard to believe there are kids at that school who would like to slag Harvey, but can't think of an angle.\"\n\nIn July 2011, the \"Daily Mirror\" published an article strongly criticizing Boyle which alleged he had been forced to quit \"Mock the Week\" and described him as a \"racist comedian\". Boyle, in response, sued the \"Mirror\" for libel. In October 2012, a jury found in his favour, ordering the \"Mirror\" to pay him £54,650 in damages, all of which he donated to charity.\n\nOn 6 March 2013, Boyle caused controversy when he was invited to perform at Russell Brand's BBC Three fundraiser \"Give It Up for Comic Relief\" at Wembley Arena. He made a series of jokes about Comic Relief itself, Queen Elizabeth II, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Oscar Pistorius, Pope Benedict XVI and the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal. This was deemed so distasteful that his entire six-minute performance was cut out of the broadcast version of the 3.5-hour show.\n\nBoyle lives in Glasgow with his girlfriend, Shereen Taylor, and has two children: a daughter (born 2004) and a son (born October 2007). He has admitted that his career had caused him to neglect his family. He is a recovering alcoholic, having started drinking at the age of fifteen and stopping at 26, and is also former drug user, who now maintains a life of sobriety (a teetotaller).\n\nHe is a follower of Noam Chomsky and says that he has had a great influence on his political beliefs, claiming to be more left-wing than Chomsky himself. During one of his interviews, he has also claimed to be a follower of Advaita Vedanta.\n\nIn July 2013, Boyle supported Shaker Aamer, the last UK resident being held at Guantanamo Bay, by going on a hunger strike.\n\nBoyle is a supporter of the Glasgow-based Celtic Football Club.\n\nBoyle's comedy influences include Sir Billy Connolly, Bill Hicks and Spike Milligan. The fellow Scottish shock comedian Jerry Sadowitz is often cited as an influence on Boyle, although Boyle himself has discounted this.\n\nBoyle is a supporter of Scottish independence. When asked \"How do you feel about independence?\" Frankie replied with \"Yes, I think we should be independent. What have we got to lose? A Tory government? I'm looking forward to the vote just because it will be a novelty for Scottish people to fill in official forms while still in possession of their own belt and shoelaces. And imagine what Scotland's annual Independence Day celebrations will look like; the fucking D-Day Landings.\" Boyle revealed via his Twitter account that he votes for the Scottish Green Party.\n\nThroughout 2017, Boyle supported Jack Thomas, a British Paralympic swimmer who suffered a number of unfortunate career setbacks, via Twitter and through donations.\n\nDuring an interview on The Jonathan Ross Show in 2012, Boyle revealed that he has a fear of flying, and travels to shows in England by train.\n\n"}

The bulk of Scottish Hindus settled there in the second half of the 20th century. At the time of the 2001 UK Census, 5,600 people identified as Hindu, which equated to 0.1% of the Scottish population and was slightly above the number of Hindus in Wales. In the 2011 UK Census, the number of Hindus in Scotland almost tripled to over 16,000 adherents.\nMost Scottish Hindus are of Indian origin, or at least from neighbouring countries, such as Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. Many of these came after Idi Amin's expulsion from Uganda in the 1970s, and some also came from South Africa. There are also a few of Indonesian and Afghan origin. \n\nMany of these in turn are from the Punjab region of India. Common languages amongst them, other than English include Punjabi, Hindi, Urdu, Gujarati and Nepali.\n\nThere are several Hindu temples across the country. A temple in the West End of Glasgow, opened in 2006. However, it was severely damaged by a fire in May 2010. The ISKCON aka \"Hare Krishna\" also operates out of Lesmahagow in South Lanarkshire. There are also temples in Edinburgh and Dundee with plans announced in 2008 for a temple in Aberdeen.\n\n"}
{"id": "21601756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21601756", "title": "Irreligion in New Zealand", "text": "Irreligion in New Zealand\n\nIrreligion in New Zealand refers to atheism, agnosticism, deism, religious scepticism and secular humanism in New Zealand society. Post-war New Zealand has become a highly secular country, meaning that religion does not play a major role in the lives of many of the population.\n\nAlthough New Zealand has no established religion, Christianity has been the majority religious affiliation since European settlement in the 19th century. The trend toward irreligion may indicate increasing secularisation, as well as a rise in non-institutional spiritual belief.\n\nStatistics New Zealand gathers information on religious affiliation in the five-yearly census. Completing a census form is compulsory by law for every person in New Zealand on census night but respondents are able to object to answering the question of religious affiliation, and around 6% do object. The trend shows an increasing proportion of residents in New Zealand declaring no religious affiliation. In the 1991 census, 20.2% were in this category. The proportion more than doubled in two decades, reaching 41.9% in the 2013 census. Younger people were more likely to indicate they had no religion; except in the 10-14 age bracket, the majority of people under 35 at the 2013 Census stated they had no religion. More males than females stated they had no religion, particularly among people aged 65 years or over.\n\nThere is significant debate among sociologists about the interpretation of this trend in census data. The increase in those indicating 'no religion' is often cited in support of the secularisation thesis, although more detailed research of this group has thrown this assumption into question. An alternative theory is that the data indicates a decline in institutional religious affiliation rather than simply a decrease in spiritual belief. A 1985 survey showed that around one-quarter of those answering 'no religion' may believe in a god and that, conversely, between 7 percent and 36 percent of Christians (depending on their denomination) did not believe in the existence of deities.\n\nThe International Social Survey Programme was conducted in New Zealand by Massey University in 2008. It received mail-responses from around one thousand New Zealanders above the age of 18, surveying issues of religious belief and practice. The results of this survey indicated that 72% of the population believe in God or a higher power, 15% are agnostic, and 13% are atheist (with a 3% margin of error).\n\nAccording to a report by the American Physical Society, religion may die out in New Zealand and eight other Western world countries.\n\nIf current trends persist, those stating no religion will outnumber those who state a religious affiliation by the 2026 census.\n\nThe Humanist Society of New Zealand and the New Zealand Association of Rationalists and Humanists promote a secular view of life without reference to supernatural agencies as one of their aims.\n\nA campaign to create advertisements similar to the Atheist Bus Campaign in the United Kingdom began a fund-raising drive on 10 December 2009, and reached its initial target of $10,000 in donations within 48 hours, making it one of the most successful atheist campaigns of all time.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "533710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=533710", "title": "Islam in Germany", "text": "Islam in Germany\n\nOwing to labour migration in the 1960s and several waves of political refugees since the 1970s, Islam has become a visible religion in Germany. According to a national census conducted in 2011, 1.9% of Germany's population (around 1.5m people) declared themselves as Muslim. However, this is likely to underestimate the true number, given that many respondents may have exercised their right not to state their religion. \nAn estimate made in 2015 calculated that there are 4.4 to 4.7 million Muslims in Germany (5.4–5.7% of the population). Of these, 1.9 million are German citizens (2.4%). According to the German statistical office 9.1% of all newborns in Germany had Muslim parents in 2005.\n\nIslam is the largest minority religion in the country, with the Protestant and Roman Catholic confessions being the majority religions. There are between 2.1 and 4.7 million Muslims. \n\nThe large majority of Muslims in Germany are of Turkish origin (63.2%), followed by smaller groups from Pakistan, countries of the former Yugoslavia, Arab countries, Iran and Afghanistan. Most Muslims live in Berlin and the larger cities of former West Germany. However, unlike in most other European countries, sizeable Muslim communities exist in some rural regions of Germany, especially Baden-Württemberg, Hesse and parts of Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia. Owing to the lack of labour immigration before 1989, there are only very few Muslims in the former East Germany. Among the German districts with the highest share of Muslim migrants are Groß-Gerau (district) and Offenbach (district) according to migrants data from the census 2011. The majority of Muslims in Germany are Sunnis, at 75%. There are Shia Muslims (7%) and mostly from Iran. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community organization comprise a minority of Germany's Muslims, numbering some 35,000 members or a little over 1% of the Muslim population, and are found in 244 communities as of 2013.\n\nAccording to the Huffington Post in February 2018 which quired each of the 15 state justice ministries, 12 300 Muslims are in prison and constitute about 20% of the total 65 000 prison population in Germany which constitutes an over-representation. The highest shares are in city states of Bremen (29%), Hamburg (28%) but the share is high also in large states such as Hessen (26%) Baden-Württemberg (26%). The share is lower in the former East Germany.\n\nMuslims first moved to Germany as part of the diplomatic, military and economic relations between Germany and the Ottoman Empire in the eighteenth century. Twenty Muslim soldiers served under Frederick William I of Prussia, at the beginning of the eighteenth century. In 1745, Frederick II of Prussia established a unit of Muslims in the Prussian army called the \"Muslim Riders\" and consisting mainly of Bosniaks, Albanians and Tatars. In 1760 a Bosniak corps was established with about 1,000 men.\n\nIn 1798 a Muslim cemetery was established in Berlin. The cemetery, which moved in 1866, still exists today.\n\nThe German section of the World Islamic Congress and the Islam Colloquium, the first German Muslim educational institution for children, were established in 1932. At this time there were 3,000 Muslims in Germany, 300 of whom were of German descent.\n\nThe Islamic Institut Ma’ahad-ul-Islam was founded in 1927 and is now known under the name \"\" (Central Islamic Archive Institute).\n\nThe Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Haj Amin al-Husseini energetically recruited Muslims for the SS (Schutzstaffel), the Nazi Party’s elite military command. He recruited Muslim volunteers for the German armed forces and was involved in the organization and recruitment of Muslims into several divisions of the Waffen SS and other units.\n\nAfter the West German Government invited foreign workers (\"Gastarbeiter\") in 1961, the figure sharply rose to currently 4.3 million within two decades (most of them Turkish from the rural region of Anatolia in southeast Turkey). They are sometimes called a parallel society within ethnic Germans.\n\nIn 2017, Muslims and Islamic institutions were targeted by attacks 950 times, where houses are painted with Nazi symbols, hijab-wearing women are harassed, threatening letters are sent and 33 people were injured. In nearly all cases, the perpetrators were right-wing extremists.\n\nIn May 2018 a court in Berlin upheld the right the state's neutrality principle by barring a primary school teacher from wearing a headscarf during classes, where the court spokesman stated that children should be free of the influence that can be exerted by religious symbols.\n\nAccording to a study in 2018 by Leipzig University, 56% of Germans sometimes thought the many Muslims made them feel like strangers in their own country, up from 43% in 2014. In 2018, 44% thought immigration by Muslims should be banned, up from 37% in 2014.\n\nMuslims in Germany belong to serval different branches of Islam (approximately data):\n\n\nOnly a minority of the Muslims residing in Germany are members of religious associations.\n\n\nIn addition there are numerous local associations without affiliation to any of these organisations. Two organisations have been banned in 2002 because their programme was judged as contrary to the constitution: The \"Hizb ut-Tahrir\" and the so-called \"Caliphate State\" founded by Cemalettin Kaplan and later led by his son Metin Kaplan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, there are the following umbrella organisations:\n\nAs elsewhere in Western Europe, the rapid growth of the Muslim community in Germany has led to social tensions and political controversy, partly connected to Islamic extremism, and more generally due to the perceived difficulties of multiculturalism and fears of \"Überfremdung\". \n\nA 2017 study on Jewish perspectives on antisemitism in Germany by Bielefeld University found that individuals and groups belonging to the extreme right and extreme left were equally represented as perpetrators of antisemitic harassment and assault, while the largest part of the attacks were committed by Muslim assailants. The study also found that 70% of the participants feared a rise in antisemitism due to immigration citing the antisemitic views of the refugees.\n\nOne such issue concerns the wearing of the head-scarf by teachers in schools and universities. The right to practice one's religion, stated by the teachers in question, contradicts in the view of many the neutral stance of the state towards religion. As of 2006, many of the German federal states have introduced legislation banning head-scarves for teachers. It is almost certain that in 2006 these laws will be validated as constitutional.\n\nIn the German federal states with the exception of Bremen, Berlin and Brandenburg, lessons of religious education overseen by the respective religious communities are taught as an elective subject in state schools. It is being discussed whether apart from the Catholic and Protestant (and in a few schools, Jewish) religious education that currently exists, a comparable subject of Islamic religious education should be introduced as a regular part of the curricula. In several states, trials for Islamic religious education are being conducted, while in the states of Hessen, Lower-Saxony and Northrhine-Westphalia, Islamic religious education already is integrated as a regular class. The problem that the cooperation with Islamic organisations is hampered by the fact that none of them can be considered as representative of the whole Muslim community.\n\nThe construction of mosques is occasionally resisted by anti Muslim reactions in the neighbourhoods concerned. For example, in 2007 an attempt by Muslims to build a large mosque in Cologne sparked a controversy.\n\nSimilarly with the Sendlinger Mosque Controversy, and the proposed construction of a training academy in Munich, originally called the \"Centre for Islam in Europe, Munich\" (ZIE-M), and later the \"Munich Forum for Islam\".\n\nIn 2010, the German Ministry of Education and Research established Islamic Theological Studies as an academic discipline at public universities in order to train teachers for Islamic religious education and Muslim theologians. Since then, Islamic theological departments have been established at several universities, conducting research and teaching on Islam from a theological perspective.\n\nConcerns of Islamic fundamentalism came to the fore after September 11, 2001, especially with respect to Islamic fundamentalism among second- and third-generation Muslims in Germany - the Hamburg cell, which included Mohamed Atta, was prominent in the planning and execution of the September 11 attacks. Also the various confrontations between Islamic religious law (Sharia) and the norms of German \"Grundgesetz\" and culture are the subject of intense debate. German critics include both liberals and Christian groups. The former claim that Islamic fundamentalism violates basic fundamental rights whereas the latter maintain that Germany is a state and society grounded in the Christian tradition.\n\nAccording to a 2007 Federal Ministry of the Interior report almost half of all young Muslims in Germany support fundamentalist views. About 12% of Muslims in Germany identified with moral-religious criticism against Western societal values in combination with corporal punishment up to and including the death penalty.\n\nAccording to a 2012 poll, 72% of the Turks in Germany believe that Islam is the only true religion and 46% wish that one day more Muslims live in Germany than Christians. According to a 10-year survey by the University of Bielefeld, which dealt with different aspects of attitudes to Islam, \"distrust\" of Islam is widespread in Germany with only 19 percent of Germans believing that Islam is compatible with German culture.\n\nAccording to 2013 study by Social Science Research Center Berlin, two thirds of the Muslims interviewed say that religious rules are more important to them than the laws of the country in which they live, almost 60 percent of the Muslim respondents reject homosexuals as friends; 45 percent think that Jews cannot be trusted; and an equally large group believes that the West is out to destroy Islam (Christian respondents’ answers for comparison: As many as 9 percent are openly anti-Semitic; 13 percent do not want to have homosexuals as friends; and 23 percent think that Muslims aim to destroy Western culture).\n\nSalafists strive to live exclusively according to the Quran. According to German authorities, Salafism is incompatible with the principles codified in the Constitution of Germany, in particular democracy, the rule of law and a political order based on human rights. According to the German security service, the Salafist movement attracts rising numbers. In 2011 there were an estimated 3800 Salafists in Germany, which rose to 10300 in September 2017. According to head of security office Hans-Georg Maaßen, the Salafist scene in Germany is not dominated by any one single individual, but instead a great many persons have to be monitored.\n\nAccording to German Federal Agency for Civic Education, the salafist movement in Germany is centered in the Frankfurt Rhine-Main metropolitan area, North Rhine-Westphalia and Berlin. In these areas mosques and charismatic imams are the driving factors behind recruitment to the salafist movement.\n\nIn 2016, the interior minstry of North Rhine-Westphalia reported that the number of mosques with a salafist influence had risen from 30 to 55, which indicated both an actual increase and improved reporting.\n\nIn February 2017, salafist mosque organisation \"Berliner Fussilet-Moscheeverein\" was banned by authoritiess. Anas Amri, the perpetrator of the 2016 Berlin truck attack was among its visitors. In March 2017 the community organisation \"Deutschsprachige Islamkreis Hildesheim\" was banned as Muslims were being prepared for travelling to the conflict zone in Syria to fight for the Islamic State. These examples show that salafist mosques not only concern themselves with religious matters, but also serious crime and terrorist activities are prepared.\n\nTurkish and Kurdish Islamist groups are also active in Germany, and Turkish and Kurdish Islamists have co-operated in Germany as in the case of the Sauerland terror cell. Political scientist Guido Steinberg stated that many top leaders of Islamist organizations in Turkey fled to Germany in the 2000s, and that the Turkish (Kurdish) Hizbullah has also \"left an imprint on Turkish Kurds in Germany.\" Also many Kurds from Iraq (there are about 50,000 to 80,000 Iraqi Kurds in Germany) financially supported Kurdish-Islamist groups like Ansar al Islam. Many Islamists in Germany are ethnic Kurds (Iraqi and Turkish Kurds) or Turks. Before 2006, the German Islamist scene was dominated by Iraqi Kurds and Palestinians, but since 2006 Kurds and Turks from Turkey are dominant.\n\nIn 2016, the German security service estimated that about 24 000 Muslims were part of Islamists movements in Germany, of which 10 000 belonged to the Salafist scene.\n\nIn 2016, 90 mosques were monitored by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution for their islamist ideology. These were mostly Arabic-language \"backyard mosques\" where self-appointed imams exhorted their followers to wage jihad.\n\nSince the start of 2017 until April 2018, 80 islamist extremists without German citizenship were deported to their home countries.\n\nIn March 2018, there were 760 islamists in Germany classified as dangerous by police authorities, of which more than half were on German territory and 153 of the latter were in prison.\n\nIn July 2010, Germany outlawed the Internationale Humanitäre Hilfsorganisation e.V. (IHH Germany), saying it had used donations to support Hamas, which is considered by the European Union and Germany to be a terrorist organization, while presenting their activities to donors as humanitarian help. German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said, \"Donations to so-called social welfare groups belonging to Hamas, such as the millions given by IHH, actually support the terror organization Hamas as a whole.\" IHH e.V. was believed by the German Authorities to have collected money in mosques and to have sent $8.3 million to organizations related to Hamas.\n\nStudies show that while not all Muslims are religious, Muslim youths are markedly more religious than non-Muslim youths. A study comparing Turkish Muslim youths living in Germany and German youth found that the former were more likely to attend religious services regularly (35% versus 14%).\n\n41% of young Turkish Muslim boys and 52% of the girls said they prayed \"sometimes or regularly\"; 64% of boys and 74% of girls said they wanted to teach their children religion.\n\nAccording to a 2012 poll, 25% of the Turks in Germany believe atheists are inferior human beings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nW\n\n\n\n"}

It lists former Muslim mosques (Arabic: Masjid, Spanish: Mezquita) and Islamic places of worship in Spain. It lists some but by no means all of the old mosques of Spain. For open, functioning mosques please see list of mosques in Spain. \n\nThe term former mosque in this list includes any Muslim mosque (building) or site used for Islamic Prayer (Salah) in Spain but is not so any longer. \n\nMost of the former mosques in Spain were built and used as Muslim places of worship during the Al-Andalus (Muslim Spain) period from 711 AD to 1492 AD when various Muslim Moorish kingdoms ruled large parts of the Iberian Peninsula. Most of these former mosques and religious buildings were either demolished or converted into churches after the Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula (the Reconquista).\n\nThis list does not include the former mosques of Portugal that were built during Al-andalus era.\n\nMosques were an integral part of Spanish social, political and cultural spheres during the Muslim rule of Spain (711 - 1492 AD). Subsequently they played an important role in Spanish history for over eight centuries. However, with the exception of the Great Mosque of Cordoba, there is very little documentation or published information available in English language about these old historical mosques of Spain.\n\nThere are only estimates about the number of former Spanish mosques. However there seem to have existed several hundreds and possibly even thousands of mosques in Spain. According to one estimate, there were 3,000 mosques, bath and palaces in Cordoba city alone. This was during the 10th century, when Cordoba was one of the largest cities in the world and had over 250,0000 buildings spread across a area of twenty four miles long and six miles wide. Today these old mosques in Cordoba are lost without a trace with the exception of the Great Mosque of Cordoba and few other ruins and remains like \"Minaret of San Juan\". \n\nAt onetime there were 137 mosques in the Medina of Grenada when it was the capital city of the Emirate of Granada (1230-1492). During this period the Medina (city) of Granada was one of the largest cities in Europe and accepted large number of Muslim refugees expelled from the Christian controlled areas. This doubled its size, and by 1450 made it the largest city in Europe in terms of population. \n\nProliferation of mosques was not limited to the large cities. Even small cities and towns had multiple mosques built for the easy and quick access of the faithful to perform their daily five times Islamic prayers (Salah) in congregation. There were 18 mosques in Jerez city, of which only the mosque within the fortress of Alcazar of Jerez de la Frontera survives today. There were 16 mosques in Vélez-Málaga (then known as Ballis Medina) during the Nazari Granada Emirate period. Ronda a smaller town had 7 or 8 mosques of which none exist today except a minaret tower of a medium-size mosque. About 5 former mosques still exists in Toledo with the original structures at-least partially preserved as shown in the list below.\n\nThis table lists former mosques in Spain with \"identified\" original buildings or ruins of the former mosque still existing on the premises.\n\n\"Note\": \"Mesquita\" means mosque in the Spanish language.\n\nThis table lists former mosques in Spain with \"no known\" surviving mosque buildings. The original mosques were completely destroyed by people, war or by natural causes like earthquakes. Other structures were built on the site destroying or covering traces of the mosque. The ruins and stone materials of the mosque were often reused to build the new structures. However these sites may still contain undiscovered original structures within the current buildings or un-excavated ruins on the premises. \n\n"}

During World War II, Stern was forced to flee the Nazi regime and relocate to Canada. While escaping, he lost his private collection of valued artworks through forced sale and confiscation. After the war, Stern sought restitution of these works. Unfortunately, he had limited success and only managed to recover several pieces. The majority of his property was never returned.\n\nThe Max Stern Art Restitution Project was established by the executors and university beneficiaries of the Max Stern Estate. An official announcement outlining the initiation of the project and its goals was made on April 28, 2005. This announcement occurred in Quebec, and was given by Dr. Clarence Epstein of Concordia University. The project is seeking the restitution of art pieces originally owned by the late Max Stern. These pieces were either confiscated by the Nazi Party, or sold under duress in the 1930s. While project members realize that locating missing artwork is a great challenge, they decided that the moral and financial imperatives surrounding the cause make it worth the effort.\n\nConcordia University has been a leader in the restitution movement, and is working closely with the Art Loss Register in London, the Commission of Looted Art in Europe, and the New York State Holocaust Claims Processing Office. Since Concordia launched its efforts, 250 artworks previously owned by Stern have been identified. These include pieces by Brueghel, Bosch, Carracci and Winterhalter. Five works have been located in the United States, England, the Netherlands or Germany. As artworks are reclaimed and possession is acquired, estate executors plan to loan the pieces to museums and galleries. This decision was made based on Max Stern's ideals, as he was always encouraging art education and passion in Canada and around the world. Executors and beneficiaries have expressed their wish to avoid using the courts, and instead wish to utilize moral persuasion in convincing institutions and individuals to return works to the appropriate beneficiaries.\n\nThe Max Stern Art Restitution Project was not initiated only to find missing works. Rather, it was also created as an incentive to motivate governments, museums, collectors and the art trade towards resolving injustices caused by Nazi cultural policies. In order to commence this movement, the restitution project chose to spearhead the \"Auktion 392 \"exhibit.\n\nLaunched in fall of 2006, \"Auktion 392 \"is a traveling exhibit surrounding the forced sale of Stern paintings in the Lempertz auction house during 1937. This exhibit was created by FOFA gallery coordinator Lynn Beavis and designer Andrew Elvish. It also accompanies the seminal research of Professor Catherine MacKenzie and MA students from Concordia's Department of Art History. The exhibition outlines the unique story of Max Stern, and the legal issues of art restitution stemming from anti-Semitic policies during World War II. There is historical meaning behind the name of this exhibit. In 1935, after Stern had his art trading license withdrawn, he was forced to sell his artworks under extreme duress. The sale was arranged by Lempertz auctioneers in Cologne, and the auction was titled Auktion 392. This exhibit is extremely valuable to the Max Stern Art Restitution Project, as it raises public awareness of art restitution matters.\n\nRecovering the missing artwork has been no simple task. There have been several instances where pieces have been located, but a lack of cooperation keeps the works from being acquired. Take, for example, the issue surrounding two artworks originally sold under duress by Stern. The two paintings, \"Market Scene in the Piazza Navona \"and \"Market Scene in the Piazza del Quirinale\", were created by a Dutch Baroque painter named Mathijs Naiveu. These paintings were discovered while being auctioned in the Van Ham auction house, which is located in Cologne. On November 8, 2006, it was requested that the artworks be removed from the upcoming auction. The Stern Estate had been pursuing the paintings for several years, ever since the possessor tried to sell them in Amsterdam. Unfortunately, the German possessor refused to acknowledge the forced sale that took place during the Nazi era. Consequently, the Van Ham sale was scheduled to proceed despite the tainted history.\n\nIn order to be reclaimed, each discovered artwork has to run through a legal process which varies depending on its located country. Some pieces present extreme challenges, like the Neufchatel portrait of Jan van Eversdijck. Upon discovery, this portrait was deemed part of the patrimony of the Illes Beleares province in Spain. This patrimony made difficult for project members to claim their right of ownership. Fortunately, the painting has since been restituted and is one of the 11 paintings reclaimed by the Max Stern Art Restitution Project. This particular portrait was easy to locate because it was posted on a museum website up until 2006. Other paintings are much more difficult to find. This difficulty stems from the fact that a large number of Stern's stock was not illustrated, and few of the given titles were likely to have remained over the years. Unfortunately, art galleries and auction houses are not required to provide background information on works of art in their possession. Dealers will often be in possession of the full story behind a specific painting, but choose to suppress this information for business reasons.\n\nResearch conducted has learned that upwards of forty paintings originally owned by Stern have since been re-offered on the market in the last two decades, usually through major auction houses in Germany. The Stern Estate continues to plead with German auction houses, hoping to make them recognize the validity of the estate's ownership regarding looted artworks.\n\nWhile facing a lot of difficulty in their endeavor to locate the missing Stern paintings, the Max Stern Art Restitution Project has also been presented with countless victories. To date, they have managed to recover the following works:\n"}

Colored micrography is especially distinctive because these rare artworks are customarily rendered in black and white.\n\nThe artwork is created from text that forms an image when viewed at a distance, creating an interplay between the text and image. The photomosaic, whose tiny individual images form a mosaic when viewed from a distance, is a modern analogue.\n\nThere is a relationship between this form of art, employing both digital and analogic symbols, and the restrictions on images found in the second commandment. Micrography provides a unique solution to the visual artist who wishes to remain devout in observation of Jewish law, by using only text, not images per se. As similar restrictions exist in certain Muslim societies, this solution has been adapted in Islamic calligraphy to the Arabic alphabet as well.\n\n\n"}

He left Lotus in 1986. In 1990 with John Perry Barlow and John Gilmore, he co-founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and served as its chairman until 1994. In 2003, Kapor became the founding chair of the Mozilla Foundation, creator of the open source web browser Firefox. Kapor has been an investor in the personal computing industry, and supporter of social causes via Kapor Capital and the Kapor Center. Kapor and his wife, Freada Kapor Klein, invest in social impact tech startups that seek to narrow gaps in opportunity and access for underrepresented communities and attempt to eliminate barriers to full participation across the tech ecosystem. Kapor and Klein take a comprehensive approach to removing barriers in education and the workplace for all and fixing the leaks at every stage of the tech pipeline. Kapor serves on the board of SMASH, a non-profit founded by Klein to help underrepresented scholars hone their STEM knowledge while building the networks and skills for careers in tech and the sciences.\n\nKapor was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Freeport, New York on Long Island, where he graduated from high school in 1967. He received a B.A. from Yale College in 1971 and studied psychology, linguistics, and computer science in an interdisciplinary major, also attending the Boston-based Beacon College, which had a satellite campus in Washington, D.C. at the time. He began but did not complete a master's degree at the MIT Sloan School of Management but later served on the faculty of the MIT Media Lab and the University of California, Berkeley School of Information.\n\nLotus was founded in 1982 by partners Mitch Kapor and Jonathan Sachs with backing from Ben Rosen. Lotus' first product was presentation software for the Apple II known as Lotus Executive Briefing System. Kapor founded Lotus after leaving his post as head of development at VisiCorp, the distributors of the Visicalc spreadsheet, and selling all his rights to VisiPlot and VisiTrend to VisiCorp.\n\nShortly after Kapor left Visi-Corp, he and Sachs produced an integrated spreadsheet and graphics program. Even though IBM and VisiCorp had a collaboration agreement whereby Visi-Calc was being shipped simultaneously with the PC, Lotus had a clearly superior product. Lotus released Lotus 1-2-3 on January 26, 1983. The name referred to the three ways the product could be used, as a spreadsheet, graphics package, and database manager. In practice the latter two functions were less often used, but 1-2-3 was the most powerful spreadsheet program available.\n\nLotus was almost immediately successful, becoming the world's third largest microcomputer software company in 1983 with $53 million in sales in its first year, compared to its business plan forecast of $1 million in sales. Jerome Want says:\n\nKapor was extensively involved in initiatives that created the modern Internet. He co-founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation in 1990 and served as its chairman until 1994. EFF defends civil liberties in the digital world and works to ensure that rights and freedoms are enhanced and protected as our use of technology grows.\n\nKapor attended the first Wikimania in 2005.\n\nKapor was the founding investor in UUNET, one of the first and the largest early Internet service provider; of Real Networks, the Internet’s first streaming media company; and of Linden Lab, maker of the first successful virtual world, Second Life.

The festival is a part of the spring Navratri, and falls on the ninth day of the bright half (Shukla Paksha) in the Hindu calendar month of Chaitra. This typically occurs in the Gregorian months of March or April every year. Rama Navami is an optional government holiday in India.\n\nThe day is marked by Rama Katha recitals, or reading of Rama stories. Ramayana and Mahabharat are considered Itihasa by Indian traditions. Some Vaishnava Hindus visit a temple, others pray within their home, and some participate in a bhajan or kirtan with music as a part of puja and aarti. Some devotees mark the event by taking miniature statues of the infant Rama, washing it and clothing it, then placing it in a cradle. Charitable events and community meals are also organized. The festival is an occasion for moral reflection for many Hindus. Some mark this day by vrata (fasting).\n\nThe important celebrations on this day take place at Ayodhya and Sita Samahit Sthal (Uttar Pradesh), Sitamarhi (Bihar), Janakpurdham (Nepal), Bhadrachalam (Telangana), Kodandarama Temple, Vontimitta (Andhra Pradesh) and Rameswaram (Tamil Nadu). Rathayatras, the chariot processions, also known as \"Shobha yatras\" of Rama, Sita, his brother Lakshmana and Hanuman, are taken out at several places. In Ayodhya, many take a dip in the sacred river Sarayu and then visit the Rama temple.\n\nThe festival celebrates the descent of god Vishnu as Rama avatar, through his birth to King Dasharatha and Queen Kausalya in Ayodhya.\n\nThe day is the ninth and last day of \"Chaitra Navaratri\" (not to be confused with the autumn Navratri). It celebrates the arrival of Vishnu's 7th avatar, god Rama. It is marked by the faithfuls with \"puja\" (devotional worship) such as bhajan and kirtan, by fasting and reading passages about Rama's life. Special cities in the \"Ramayana\" legends about Rama's life observe major celebrations. These include Ayodhya (Uttar Pradesh), Rameshwaram (Tamil Nadu), Bhadrachalam (Telangana) and Sitamarhi (Bihar). Some locations organize Rath-yatras (chariot processions), while some celebrate it as the wedding anniversary festival (\"Kalyanotsavam\") of Rama and Sita.\n\nThe Uttaradhi Math and the Mantralaya Raghavender Swamy math worships the Moola Rama idols at their respective Maths on this day which also marks the aradhana of Kavibdrateertharu. Uttaradi Matha￼\n\nWhile the festival is named after Rama, the festival typically includes reverence for Sita, Lakshmana and Hanumana given their importance in Rama's story. Some Vaishnava Hindus observe the festival in Hindu temples, some observe it within their homes. Surya, the Hindu sun god, is a part of the worship and ceremonies in some communities. Some south Indian Vaishnava communities observe all nine days of Chaitra Navaratri remembering Rama, and reading the \"Ramayana\", with some temples organizing special discussion sessions in the evening. Charitable events to help those in need and community meals are organized by temples and Vaishnava organizations, and for many Hindus it is an occasion for moral reflection. \n\nIn Karnataka, Sri Ramanavami is celebrated by the local Mandali’s (organizations) at some places even on footpaths, dispersing free panaka (jaggery and crushed muskmelon juice) and some food. Additionally, in Bengaluru, Karnataka, the Sree Ramaseva Mandali, R.C.T (R.) Chamrajpet, organizes India’s most prestigious, month long classical music festival. The uniqueness of this 80 years old musical extravaganza is that celebrated Indian classical musicians, irrespective of their religion, from both genres – Carnatic and Hindustani – descend down to offer their musical rendition to Lord Sri Rama and the assembled audience. Every year over 2 lakh people attend the 31 days event supported by Government and organisations such as Infosys Foundation.\nIn eastern Indian states such as Odisha, Jharkhand, and West Bengal, the Jagannath temples and regional Vaishnava community observe Rama Navami, and treat it as the day when preparations begin for their annual Jagannath Ratha Yatra in summer.\n\nDevotees associated with ISKCON fast through the daylight hours. A number of ISKCON temples introduced a more prominent celebration of the occasion of the holiday with the view of addressing needs of growing native Hindu congregation. It is however always was a notable calendar event on the traditional Gaurabda calendar with a specific additional requirement of fasting by devotees.\n\nRama Navami is one of the Hindu festivals that is celebrated by the Indian Hindu diaspora with roots in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Telangana, Andhra pradesh and Tamilnadu. The descendants of Indian indentured servants, for example, who arrived in colonial South Africa before 1910 to work in British owned plantations and mines, thereafter lived through the South African Apartheid regime, continued to celebrate Ram Navami by reciting \"Ramayana\", and by singing bhajans of Tyagaraja and Bhadrachala Ramdas. The tradition continues in contemporary times in the Hindu temples of Durban every year.\n\nSimilarly in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, other Caribbean countries, Mauritius, Malaysia, Singapore, and many other countries Hindu descendants of colonial era indentured workers brought by the British government from India have continued to observe Ram Navami along with their other traditional festivals.\n\nIt is also celebrated by Hindus in Fiji, and those Fiji Hindus who have re-migrated elsewhere.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in the 1st century AD, and in 301 AD became the first branch of Christianity to become a state religion. \n\nIn the 21st century, the largest minority Christian churches in the country are composed of new converts to Protestant and non-trinitarian Christianity, a combined total up to 38,989 persons (1.3%). Due to the country's ethnic homogeneity, non-Christian religions such as Yazidism and Islam have only few adherents.\n\nThe country has an area of and a population of 3 million. Approximately 98.1 percent of the population is ethnic Armenian. Armenians have a very strong cultural connection to the Armenian Apostolic Church. About 93% of citizens belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church, an Eastern Christian denomination in communion with the other Oriental Orthodox churches. The Armenian Apostolic Church has its spiritual center at the Etchmiadzin Cathedral. The head of the church is Catholicos Karekin II.\n\nAccording to the Census of 2011, the composition of people identifying with religions in Armenia is the following: Christianity 2,862,366 (94.8%), of whom 2,797,187 are Armenian Apostolic (92.5%); 29,280 Evangelical; 13,996 Armenian Rite and Latin Rite Catholic; 8,695 Jehovah's Witness; 7,587 Eastern Orthodox (Russian, Ukrainian, Georgian, Greek); 2,874 Molokan (non-Orthodox Russians); 1,733 Assyrian Church of the East (Nestorian); 733 Protestant; 241 Mormon; 23,374 Yazidi (0.8%); 5,146 Pagan (0.2%); 812 Muslim; 5,299 other religions (0.2%); 121,587 no response (4.0%).\n\nYazidis are concentrated primarily in agricultural areas around Mount Aragats, northwest of the capital Yerevan. They live in 19 villages in the Aragatsotn Province, two villages in the Armavir Province, and one village in the Ararat Province. \n\nArmenian Catholics live mainly in the northern region, in seven villages in the Shirak Province and six villages in the Lori Province. \n\nMolokans live in 10 villages in the Lori Province, two villages in the Shirak Province, and two villages in the Gegharkunik Province.\n\nMost Jews, Mormons, Baha'is, Eastern Orthodox Christians, and Western Catholic (Latin Rite) Christians reside in the capital Yerevan, which has attracted a greater variety of peoples. Yerevan also has a small community of Muslims, including ethnic Kurds, Iranians, and temporary residents from the Middle East. Foreign missionary groups are active in the country.\n\nThe Constitution as amended in 2005 provides for freedom of religion and the right to practice, choose, or change religious belief. It recognizes \"the exclusive mission of the Armenian Church as a national church in the spiritual life, development of the national culture, and preservation of the national identity of the people of Armenia.\" The law places some restrictions on the religious freedom of religious groups other than the Armenian Church. The Law on Freedom of Conscience establishes the separation of church and state but it grants the Armenian Church official status as the national church.\n\nAccording to tradition, Christianity was first introduced to this area by the apostles Bartholomew and Thaddeus in the 1st century AD. Armenia became the first country to establish Christianity as its state religion when, in an event traditionally dated to 301 AD, St. Gregory the Illuminator convinced Tiridates III, the king of Armenia, to convert to Christianity. Before this, the dominant religion was Armenian paganism, under the theological influence of Zoroastrianism.\n\nHetanism (Հեթանոսություն, \"Hetanosutyun\") is a neo-ethnic religion movement in Armenia. Adherents call themselves \"Hetans\" (\"Hetanos\" հեթանոս, the Old Armenian biblical term loaned from Greek ἐθνικός \"gentile\"). The movement traces its origins back to the work of the early-20th-century political philosopher and revolutionary Garegin Nzhdeh and his doctrine of \"tseghakron\" (rejuvenation through national religion). In 1991, it was institutionalized by the armenologist Slak Kakosyan into the \"Order of the Children of Ari\" (\"Arordineri Ukht\"). The doctrine and mythology of the Hetan movement is codified into a book, the \"Ukhtagirk\", written by Kakosyan himself. The movement is strongly associated to Armenian nationalism. It finds some support from nationalist political parties of Armenia, particularly the Republican Party of Armenia and the Union of Armenian Aryans. Ashot Navasardyan, the founder of the Republican Party, which is also the currently leading party of the country, was a Hetan himself, as many other members of the party are.\n\nDue to the early Christianization of Armenia, very little is known about the historical pre-Christian religion of Armenia. Armenian Neopagans worship the gods of a reconstructed Armenian pantheon: Haik, Aray, Barsamin, Aralez, Anahit, Mihr, Astghik, Nuneh, Tir, Tsovinar, Amanor, Spandaramet, Gissaneh, with a particular emphasis on the cult of the solar god Vahagn. They have re-consecrated the Temple of Garni (a Hellenistic-style temple rebuilt in 1975), originally a temple to Mihr, to Vahagn, and they use it for regular worship and as a center of activity.\n\nHetanism is a growing ethnic religious (\"pagan\", often defined \"neopagan\") movement. One survey suggest that indigenous Armenian religion is widespread and accepted by the population to the same degree as Christianity is. This may be due to the fact that there is no conflict between the \"Arordineri Ukht\" (the major Hetan organization) and the Armenian Apostolic Church; they coordinate their efforts in preserving Armenian cultural identity and in fighting foreign forces. The \"Arordineri Ukht\" is even supported by the ruling Republican Party of Armenia, which in turn bases its ideology on \"tseghakron\" (native religion) and on the Hetan sacred book \"Ukhtagirk\". \"Fire and sword\" rituals of the Hetan tradition are often organized on the site of Apostolic churches and patronized by Apostolic priests.\n\nAccording to the Census of 2011, there are 8,587 adherents of Eastern Orthodoxy in Armenia, mainly Russians, Ukrainians, Georgians and Greeks. Russian Orthodox community is centered around Church of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God in Yerevan, consecrated in 1912.\n\nSince the end of the Soviet Union, American Protestant missionaries have been proselytising in the country. The 2011 census counted 29,280 Evangelicals (1% of the population) and 773 mainline Protestants.\n\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses have estimated their membership at 11,500; the 2011 census found 8,695. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints claims approximately 3,000 adherents in Armenia at the end of 2011; the 2011 census found 241.\n\nThe Catholic Church in Armenia is divided between Latin Rite parishes (subject to Apostolic Administration of the Caucasus) and Armenian Catholic Church's parishes. The 2011 census counted 13,996 Catholics.\n\nAbout 1% of Armenia's population (23,374 as per the 2011 census), mostly ethnic Yazidis an ethno-religious group living in the western part of the country, follow Yazidism, one of the Yazdan religions. Many Yazidis came to Armenia and Georgia during the 19th and early 20th centuries to escape religious persecution. Relations between Yazidis and Armenians are strong. The world's largest Yazidi temple is constructed in the small village of Aknalich.\n\nCurrently there are an estimated 750 Jews in the country, a remnant of a once larger community. Most left Armenia for Israel after the collapse of the Soviet Union because of in pursuit of better living standards. Still, despite the small numbers, high intermarriage rate and relative isolation, a lot of enthusiasm exists to help the community meet its needs.\n\nAzeris and Kurds living in Armenia traditionally practiced Islam, but most Azeris have fled the country due to the Nagorno-Karabakh War. In 2009, the Pew Research Center estimated that less than 0.1% of the population, or about 1,000 people, were Muslims. The 18th century Blue Mosque is open for Friday prayers.\n\nThroughout the history Armenians did not convert to Islam in large numbers despite long periods of Muslim rule. During the Arabic conquest, Islam came to the Armenians; however, very few Armenians converted to Islam, since Christians were not required to convert by Muslim law. \n\nThere is, however, a minority of ethnic Armenian Muslims, known as Hamshenis, the vast majority of which live outside of Armenia mostly in Turkey and Russia. \n\nSince the early 1990s, foreign missionaries, esoteric and sectarian groups penetrated into Armenia.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith in Armenia begins with some involvements in the banishments and execution of the Báb, the Founder of the Bábí Faith, viewed by Bahá'ís as a precursor religion. The same year of the execution of the Báb the religion was introduced into Armenia. During the period of Soviet policy of religious oppression, the Bahá'ís in Armenia lost contact with the Bahá'ís elsewhere. However, in 1963 communities were identified in Yerevan and Artez. Following Perestroika the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assemblies of Armenia form in 1991 and Armenian Bahá'ís elected their first National Spiritual Assembly in 1995. As of 2004 the Bahá'ís claim about 200 members in Armenia but as of 2001 Operation World estimated about 1,400.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "55039700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55039700", "title": "Service (Tenrikyo)", "text": "Service (Tenrikyo)\n\nIn the Tenrikyo religion, the Service (おつとめ \"Otsutome\") is the most important prayer ritual, along with the Sazuke. The Service comes in fundamental forms (i.e. the Kagura Service and Teodori) and several variant forms (such as the Morning and Evening Service). The text to the Service is the \"Mikagura-uta,\" one of the three scriptures of Tenrikyo.\n\nThe most important Service is the Kagura Service (\"Kagura zutome\"). This service is the masked dance that is performed around the Kanrodai where Tenrikyo Church Headquarters – located in Tenri City, Japan – is situated.\n\nHashimoto cites three meanings behind the performance of the Kagura Service–to represent God's creative power at the time of human conception and thus inspire humankind to live the Joyous Life, to reconfirm humankind's relationship with God and the universe, and to realize the importance of living by God's original intention for humankind.\n\nThe Kagura Service is performed by ten people, five males and five females, who surround the Kanrodai. Each person represents a different divine providence that participated in the creation, wearing a unique \"kagura\" mask and dancing to unique hand movements (see diagram to the right and table below).\n\nThe performers of the Kagura Service are chosen from the inner circle of the administrative staff at Tenrikyo Church Headquarters. The ten performers and the musical instrument players switch roles on a monthly basis. However, the roles of the Shinbashira and his wife remain the same throughout all performances and that is to represent \"Kunitokotachi-no-Mikoto\" and \"Omotari-no-Mikoto\" respectively.\n\nThe song text for the Kagura Service is exactly the same as that of the Seated Service (the first, second, and third sections of the \"Mikagura-uta\"); the only difference between them is the number of repetitions of the third section. The first section is repeated twenty-one times, the second section is performed only once, and the third section is performed seven times in sets of three, amounting to a total of twenty-one times.\n\nThe \"kagura\" masks were first produced around or before 1874 by Nakayama's brother, Kyosuke Maegawa, but the masks he made have since been lost. However, it is assumed that the later masks preserve the essential features of the original masks since the \"Osashizu\" instructed followers to model new masks after the original ones. The masks currently in use are made of wood, but earlier ones seem to have been made of papier-mâché.\n\nHashimoto notes that the divine providences of the Kagura Service are oriented to reflect the metaphysical principle of oneness in two (\"futatsu hitotsu\"), which is the idea that the universe exists by integrating two opposing elements. The opposing elements do not become identical, nor does one element become subsumed by the other; rather, the opposing elements complement each other and retain their distinctive qualities while also creating a more complete entity. Oneness in two is likened to the concept of \"coincidentia oppositorum\" in the Western philosophical tradition. For example, \"Kunitokotachi-no-Mikoto,\" the providence of water, and \"Omotari-no-Mikoto,\" the providence of fire, are opposing elements which are placed on opposing sides, north and south respectively.\n\nThe Seated Service takes the place of the Kagura Service at places of worship besides Church Headquarters. The Seated Service and Kagura Service use the same text (first, second, and third sections of the Mikagura-uta) and the same instrumentation.\n\nHowever, unlike the Kagura Service, the Seated Service is performed by six people, three men and three women, sitting in a line facing the shrine and performing the same hand movements as one another. In the Seated Service, the third section of the Mikagura-uta is performed \"three\" times in sets of three, which is different from the Kagura Service, where the same section is performed \"seven\" times in sets of three.\n\nThe Seated Service embodies \"the truth of six fundamental aspects of divine providence,\" which can be understood to mean the \"six fundamental aspects of God's providence during creation\" or \"six fundamental aspects of God's providence in the human body.\"\n\nThe Teodori refers to the part of the Service that is sung, danced, and played to the text of the Eight Verses of the Yorozuyo and the Twelve Songs, or the fourth and fifth sections of the \"Mikagura-uta.\"\n\nA performance of the Teodori requires six dancers, three males on the left and three females on the right, who form a single line facing the shrine. The six Teodori dancers perform exactly the same hand and foot movements in unison, expressing the meaning of the songs through the dance. The choreography of the Teodori is called \"Otefuri.\" The Teodori also requires the full set of musical accompaniment: six men's instruments (\"hyoshigi\", \"chanpon\", \"surigane\", \"taiko\", \"kotsuzumi\", and \"fue\"), three women's instruments (\"koto\", \"shamisen\", \"kokyū\"), and one or two singers (\"jikata\").\n\nThe original Japanese term for \"Monthly Service\" is \"tsukinamisai,\" which translates to \"a regular or recurring monthly festival.\" During the Monthly Service, which is the central liturgy of a Tenrikyo church, the entire text of the \"Mikagura-uta\" (\"The Songs for the Service\") is sung to specific choreography and instrumental accompaniment.\n\nThe monthly Service performed at Tenrikyo Church Headquarters is different from Monthly Services performed at other churches due to the cosmological significance of the spot around which the Headquarters was constructed. The monthly service at Headquarters begins with the Kagura Service followed by the Teodori, and is always performed on the twenty-sixth of each month.\n\nA monthly service at other churches begins with the Seated Service followed by the Teodori, and can be performed at any fixed day of the month determined by each church (e.g. third Sunday, every month on the 8th).\n\nFrom late 1888 through the following year, a number of churches were established in various districts, and some of them requested permission to perform the Service when their sanctuaries were completed. In response, the Divine Directions made it clear that the Kagura Service could not be performed anywhere other than at the Jiba for the Kanrodai. The kagura masks were not to be worn—or even merely placed in front of the performers—at local churches, though the use of all the other implements including the musical instruments was allowed. Local churches' monthly services, performed on the days sanctioned by Church Headquarters, include the seated service—which is performed by six people seated on the raised floor performing the same hand movements as those used in the morning and evening services—followed by the Teodori.\n\nOut of the twelve monthly services of the year, two of them carry particular significance and are referred to as \"grand services\" (\"taisai,\" \"grand festival\"). The spring grand service held in January commemorates the withdrawal of the physical life of the foundress (January 26), and the autumn grand service held in October commemorates the founding of Tenrikyo (October 26). However both services are performed in the same manner as the other monthly services.\n\nThe performance of a Monthly Service requires a minimum of six dancers (three men and three women), six men's instruments (\"hyoshigi\", \"chanpon\", \"surigane\", \"taiko\", \"kotsuzumi\", and \"fue\"), three women's instruments (\"koto\", \"shamisen\", \"kokyū\"), and one or two singers (\"jikata\").\n\nThe New Year's Service (\"gantansai\"), held on the first day of the year, is performed exactly in the same manner as a monthly service.\n\nThe Memorial Service (\"mitamasai\"), dedicated to ancestors and predecessors of the Tenrikyo faith, is performed at Church Headquarters twice every year, once in the spring and once in the autumn. Memorial Services have also been held to commemorate the passing of Shinbashiras. These services consist of a monthly service like gathering with the performance of the Teodori but not the Kagura Service.\n\nOn the 26th of each month, a Service called \"Yohaishiki\" is held at churches and missions away from Church Headquarters to coincide with the Monthly Service at Church Headquarters.\n\nThe Morning and Evening Services are performed every day at all Tenrikyo places of worship: Church Headquarters, regional churches, mission stations, and fellowships. The times of the morning and evening services at Church Headquarters are based on sunrise and sunset, as are those at other places of worship. During the Morning and Evening Services, the same hand movements and the same sections of the Mikagura-uta are performed the same numbers of times as in the Seated Service. However, the Morning and Evening Services use a reduced set of instruments – \"surigane,\" \"chanpon,\" \"hyoshigi,\" counter (\"kazutori\"), and \"taiko\" – which are placed next to one another in a line in order of mention from left to right as one faces the altars. Many followers perform their Morning and Evening Services at their homes, often using only their wooden clappers or no musical instrument at all.\n\nUsually after the Morning Service, two songs from the Teodori are practiced.\n\nAnother type of service is the \"onegai zutome\", a prayer service or a petition service. This is a type of service that asks distinctively for God’s intervention for a specific purpose. The most common form of a prayer service is when a community makes an appeal or petition to God to save a person from a particular illness. Other forms of a prayer service is that of asking God that a particular church activity, such as a spiritual retreat, a pilgrimage trip, or even a church association event that involves recreation, goes well. The prayer service is performed together with two instruments on the upper dais – the wooden clappers and the counter – with the other members of the congregation praying from the worship hall.\n\nNine musical instruments are employed in the performance of the Monthly Service – \"hyōshigi\" (wooden clappers), \"chanpon\" (cymbals), \"surigane\" (small gong), \"taiko\" (large drum), \"kotsuzumi\" (shoulder drum), \"fue\" (bamboo flute), \"shamisen\", \"kokyū\", and \"koto\". During the Morning and Evening Services the maximum number of instruments is reduced to four – \"hyoshigi\", \"chanpon\", \"surigane\", and \"taiko\" – and a \"kazutori\" (counting implement) is added in order to keep track of the repetitions of \"Mikagura-uta\" Section One, which is performed 21 times.\n\nThe earliest instrument to be associated with Tenrikyo prayer, even before the Service was composed, is the \"hyoshigi.\" In 1853, Nakayama Miki sent her youngest daughter Kokan to Naniwa (modern-day Osaka) to do missionary work there. On a street corner Kokan is said to have chanted \"Namu, Tenri-O-no-Mikoto! Namu, Tenri-O-no-Mikoto!\" to the accompaniment of the \"hyoshigi.\" In 1863, Tsuji Chusaku chanted the same words along with the \"hyoshigi,\" though not to do missionary work as Kokan had done, but to pray for his sister Kura.\n\nIn 1864, several early Tenrikyo followers decided to pay their respects to Ōyamato Shrine by playing musical instruments, dancing, and chanting \"Namu, Tenri-O-no-Mikoto! Namu, Tenri-O-no-Mikoto!\" as others had previously done. Unbeknownst to the followers, they were disrupting an important seven-day prayer at the shrine, and the priests from the shrine soon seized the instruments and had the followers detained. The instruments that were seized were a \"taiko,\" two \"suzu\" (bells), seven \"hyoshigi,\" and a \"tebyoshi.\"\n\nBased on the historical record and certain \"Ofudesaki\" verses referring to musical instruments, Nakayama Miki may have specified the nine musical instruments of the Service starting around 1875. Nakayama taught how to play the women's instruments – \"koto\", \"kokyu\", and \"shamisen\" – in 1877. The Service was first performed with the full set of musical instruments on 30 September 1880.\n\nEver since Nakayama Miki's passing in 1887, the \"fue,\" \"chanpon,\" \"hyōshigi,\" and \"koto\" have remained unchanged to the present day. However, the other instruments have undergone changes.\n\nIn 1888, the first Shinbashira, Nakayama Shinnosuke, went sightseeing at Nikkō and attended a \"gagaku\" performance at Nikkō Tōshō-gū. Influenced by the instruments he saw, he replaced certain Service instruments, which he felt were unimpressive, to their analogues in the \"sanko\" (三鼓, 'three drums') of the \"gagaku\" orchestra – \"gakudaiko\", \"gakushōko\", and \"kakko\":\n\n\nIn 1896, the Home Ministry issued \"Directive No. 12,\" which called for stricter government control over Tenrikyo's activities. In light of the directive, Tenrikyo officials changed two of the women's instruments:\n\n\nOn the fiftieth anniversary of Nakayama Miki's death in 1936, followers decided to revert as much as possible to the instruments that she had originally taught her followers. The \"kotsuzumi,\" \"shamisen,\" and \"kokyū\" were restored, while the \"taiko\" and \"surigane\" continue to resemble their gagaku counterparts. No major changes have been made to the instruments since 1936.\n\nThough \"gagaku\" is not performed during the Service proper, it is sometimes performed during the offering ritual and the prayer ritual which precede the Service. \"Gagaku\" became a part of Tenrikyo's ceremonies because of Tenrikyo's early association with Shinto. The first time \"gagaku\" was associated with Tenrikyo's ceremonies was in 1888 during the observation of Nakayama Miki's first anniversary of her death.\n\nThe earliest account of the Service occurs in the year 1863, when follower Chusaku Tsuji prayed for the recovery of his sister's insanity. Nakayama taught Tsuji and other followers at the time to chant the divine name, \"Namu, Tenri-O-no-Mikoto! Namu, Tenri-O-no-Mikoto!\" while beating the \"hyoshigi\" (wooden clappers). The length of the service was determined by burning an entire incense stick.\n\nThe Place for the Service, which might be regarded as a sanctuary, was not built until 1864, some twenty-six years after Tenrikyo's founding in 1838.\n\nIn the autumn of 1866, Nakayama taught the first section of the Mikagura-uta, along with the melody and hand movements. This section was originally worded, \n\nIn January 1867, Nakayama composed Songs One, Two, and Three of the Mikagura-uta. By August, she wrote the rest of the Twelve Songs (十二下り目), completing the fifth section of the Mikagura-uta. Over the next three years, She devoted her time to adapting melodies and dance movements to these songs as well as teaching them to her followers. An account of how Nakayama began to instruct the followers in the melody and dance of the Service goes:\n\n\"When the sacred songs of twelve chapters were completed, Oyasama told her attendants: \"These are the songs for the Service. Try singing them to the best tune you can find.\" Each of them sang to his own tune. After listening to it, Oyasama said, \"Thank you for your singing, but none of them will do. You should sing them this way.\" She sang loudly Herself. Then She told her attendants: \"These are the songs of truth. So you must dance to the truth. Try dancing the best way you can.\" Each of them arranged the dance and showed it to Oyasama. Afterward, She said: \"Thank you for your dancing, but no one danced to the truth. You should dance in this way. You should not just dance. You should dance the truth.\" So saying, She stood up and performed the dance movements Herself in order to teach the attendants. In this way, Oyasama Herself taught the singing and the dancing after having all the attendants try on their own\" (\"Anecdotes of Oyasama,\" #18)\n\nIn 1869, Nakayama started the \"Ofudesaki\" (one of Tenrikyo's three scriptures), which explained the significance of the Service as the basis for salvation.\n\nIn 1870 she taught her followers the second section of the Mikagura-uta, which begins,\n\nIn the same year, Nakayama composed the fourth section of the Mikagura-uta, the Eight Verses of the Yorozuyo, and taught it to her followers. Then in 1874, the kagura masks, completed some time previously, were collected by Nakayama.\n\nSeveral events transpired in 1875. In that year, Nakayama identified the Jiba, the precise spot where, according to the Tenrikyo's creation story, humankind was conceived 900,099,999 years before the founding of the teaching on October 26, 1838. Nakayama taught the third section of the Mikagura-uta, completing the entire set of songs for the Service as initially composed. This section was initially worded,\n\nAlso in the same year she taught the hand movements for eleven different services to address specific issues.\n\nIn 1877, she began to teach the stringed instruments for the service. She also urged her followers to perform the service. It was on the lunar calendar date of 26 August 1880 that the service was performed for the first time with the full set of instruments, it might be said that this marked the provisional completion of the followers' implementation of what oyasama had taught about the service.\n\nIn 1881, the bottom two layers of the stone Kanrodai, which was to serve as the center for the Service, were completed. The following year, however, those layers were confiscated by the police. In the wake of this incident, Oyasama made alterations in the wording of the first and third sections of the Mikagura-uta, though she made no change to the hand movements:\n\nIn addition to the Services already mentioned, Nakayama taught eleven different Services (\"juichi-tori no tsutome\" 十一通りのつとめ) to her followers for specific purposes. Each Service has a unique set of words and hand movements performed in place of Section One from the Songs for the Kagura. Shozen Nakayama, the second Shinbashira (spiritual and administrative leader of Tenrikyo), has suggested three categories for these Services:\n\n\nOnly the Service for Safe Childbirth and Service for Germination are still performed today. The only other Services that have supporting evidence indicating they were ever conducted at all are the Service against Smallpox, the Service for Fertilizer, and the Service for Rain.\n\n"}

The series was renewed for a second season on May 12, 2016, which premiered on Tuesday, October 11, 2016.\n\nOn May 11, 2017, ABC cancelled the series after two seasons.\n\nThe series chronicles the lives of a close-knit, Irish-American Chicago Catholic family whose matriarch takes their reputation in the community very seriously. In the pilot episode, their perfect image is shattered when each family member has a secret revealed to the community: middle child Kenny is gay, oldest child Jimmy is anorexic, youngest child Shannon is running a money scam and might be atheist, and parents Eileen and Pat are no longer in love and wish to divorce. Subsequent episodes explore the new family dynamic as Pat and Eileen separate and everyone reconciles Kenny's sexuality with their faith.\n\n\n\n\nThe series received a generally favorable response from critics.

Before founding Animals as Leaders, he was the guitarist for the technical metalcore band Reflux. He has recorded and released four albums with Animals as Leaders: a self-titled debut, \"Weightless\", \"The Joy of Motion\" and their most recent album, \"The Madness of Many\". Guitar World ranks Abasi at #97 on their list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of all time.\n\nBorn in Washington D.C. to Nigerian immigrants to the United States, Abasi's first name \"Oluwatosin\" means \"God is worthy to be served\" in Yoruba. His brother, Abdul Abasi, is a former drill sergeant in the United States military and is currently a fashion designer.\n\nAbasi is a mainly self-taught guitarist. He first picked up a guitar at his friend's house, simply strumming it and making up basic licks on the spot. At this time he was being exposed to some music through learning the clarinet in elementary school. He later began to rent hair metal guitarists' instructional video tapes from his local music store, saying that some \"were videos you did not want to be caught watching\" due to racy material in certain tapes (e.g. women in bikinis).\n\nAbasi said that when he decided to learn the guitar, his father was \"totally liberal about the whole thing and encouraging and proud\" and in fact, bought him his first guitar. However his mother initially held a more conservative outlook. Tosin said in an interview, “My mom definitely represents more of the traditional immigrant mentality of education and conventional channels being way more important than a creative endeavor\".\n\nHe was the guitarist for the Silver Spring, Maryland-based metal band PSI. He joined Reflux in the early to mid-2000s. During a Reflux show, Prosthetic Records noticed his skill and offered him a record deal as a solo artist. At first, he refused, saying he didn't feel comfortable with his skill level to write his own record. Afterwards, Abasi enrolled at the Atlanta Institute of Music. After graduating, he contacted Prosthetic Records asking if the offer still held. He then formed his \"solo\" project, Animals as Leaders, the name loosely being derived from the book \"Ishmael\".\n\nIn 2009, he recorded the first Animals as Leaders release with Misha Mansoor (of Periphery), who produced and recorded the album with Tosin, as well as programming the drums. Javier Reyes and Navene Koperweis were enlisted on rhythm guitar and drums, respectively, after the completion of the album, turning the project into a full touring band. He also toured with the band Born of Osiris as a stand-in guitarist for former member Matt Pantelis whilst they were auditioning for a permanent replacement.\n\nIn 2011, Tosin started putting together material for a new band, T.R.A.M., consisting of his Animals As Leaders bandmate Javier Reyes, Suicidal Tendencies drummer Eric Moore, and former The Mars Volta wind instrumentalist Adrián Terrazas-González. \"T.R.A.M.\" stands for Terrazas, Reyes, Abasi, Moore. In mid-March 2011, T.R.A.M. played their first show at South by Southwest, a multi-day music festival in Austin, Texas. Tosin explained that he formed T.R.A.M. as a trio consisting of himself, Javier and Adrian as an outlet for some ideas he had written which he felt did not fit with Animals as Leaders. Eric Moore was not added into the line-up until the recording phase of the album, and wrote and performed all the drums on the album within a few weeks.\n\nAnimals as Leaders released their second album, entitled \"Weightless\", on November 8, 2011. Abasi was reportedly meeting with Misha Mansoor again in late 2012, and it was reported that a new Animals as Leaders album was in the works, due to be released in 2013.\n\nAt NAMM 2013, Tosin Abasi's signature guitar, the Ibanez TAM 100, was revealed. This guitar is based upon the Ibanez RG2228 model, which he had been using for some years, and contains his signature DiMarzio Ionizer pickups.\n\nOn March 19, 2014, the Animals As Leaders' album \"The Joy of Motion\" was made available for streaming, via YouTube. On March 24, 2014, the album was released in Europe, March 25 in North America and on March 28 in Australia and New Zealand by Sumerian Records. The album was met with widely positive reviews. In July 2014, Tosin appeared in the first episode of Guitar Power, a web-series sponsored by D'Addario String and Rolling Stone Magazine.\n\nAs of March 2014, he was on tour with Animals As Leaders. In October 2014, it was revealed that Abasi would join Joe Satriani, Guthrie Govan, and Mike Keneally on the G4 tour in 2015.\n\nIn April and May 2016, Abasi joined Nuno Bettencourt, Yngwie Malmsteen, Steve Vai, and Zakk Wylde, as part of the Generation Axe tour. The supergroup later reprised their tour in 2017 in Asia, and North America once more in 2018.\n\nHis favoured guitarists, musicians and bands include Steve Vai, Allan Holdsworth, Fredrik Thordendal of Meshuggah, Thom Yorke of Radiohead, Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, Mike Einziger of Incubus, and Dream Theater.\n\nHe is a Transcendental Meditation practitioner.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The singular form is Tzadik Nistar ().\n\nThe source is the Talmud itself, explained as follows:\n\nAs a mystical concept, the number 36 is even more intriguing. It is said that at all times there are 36 special people in the world, and that were it not for them, all of them, if even one of them was missing, the world would come to an end. The two Hebrew letters for 36 are the \"lamed\", which is 30, and the \"vav\", which is 6. Therefore, these 36 are referred to as the \"Lamed-Vav Tzadikim\". This widely-held belief, this most unusual Jewish concept is based on a Talmudic statement to the effect that in every generation 36 righteous \"greet the Shekhinah\", the Divine Presence (Tractate Sanhedrin 97b; Tractate Sukkah 45b).\n\nMystical Hasidic Judaism as well as other segments of Judaism believe that there exist 36 righteous people whose role in life is to justify the purpose of humankind in the eyes of God. Jewish tradition holds that their identities are unknown to each other and that, if one of them comes to a realization of their true purpose, they would never admit it:\n\nThe \"Lamed-Vav Tzaddikim\" are also called the \"Nistarim\" (\"concealed ones\"). In our folk tales, they emerge from their self-imposed concealment and, by the mystic powers, which they possess, they succeed in averting the threatened disasters of a people persecuted by the enemies that surround them. They return to their anonymity as soon as their task is accomplished, 'concealing' themselves once again in a Jewish community wherein they are relatively unknown. The \"lamed-vavniks\", scattered as they are throughout the Diaspora, have no acquaintance with one another. On very rare occasions, one of them is 'discovered' by accident, in which case the secret of their identity must not be disclosed. The lamed-vavniks do not themselves know that they are one of the 36. In fact, tradition has it that should a person claim to be one of the 36, that is proof positive that they are certainly not one. Since the 36 are each exemplars of \"anavah\", (\"humility\"), having such a virtue would preclude against one’s self-proclamation of being among the special righteous. The 36 are simply too humble to believe that they are one of the 36.\n\n\"Lamedvavnik\" (), is the Yiddish term for one of the 36 humble righteous ones or \"Tzadikim\" mentioned in kabbalah or Jewish mysticism. According to this teaching, at any given time there are at least 36 holy persons in the world who are \"Tzadikim\". These holy people are hidden; i.e., nobody knows who they are. According to some versions of the story, they themselves may not know who they are. For the sake of these 36 hidden saints, God preserves the world even if the rest of humanity has degenerated to the level of total barbarism. This is similar to the story of Sodom and Gomorrah in the Hebrew Bible, where God told Abraham that he would spare the city of Sodom if there was a quorum of at least 10 righteous men. Since nobody knows who the \"Lamedvavniks\" are, not even themselves, every Jew should act \"as if\" he or she might be one of them; i.e., lead a holy and humble life and pray for the sake of fellow human beings. It is also said that one of these 36 could potentially be the Jewish Messiah if the world is ready for them to reveal themselves. Otherwise, they live and die as an ordinary person. Whether the person knows they are the potential Messiah is debated.\n\nThe term \"lamedvavnik\" is derived from the Hebrew letters \"Lamed\" (L) and \"Vav\" (V), whose numerical value (see Gematria) adds up to 36. The \"nik\" at the end is a Russian or Yiddish suffix indicating \"a person who...\" (As in \"Beatnik\"; in English, this would be something like calling them \"The Thirty-Sixers\".) The number 36 is twice 18. In gematria (a form of Jewish numerology), the number 18 stands for \"life\", because the Hebrew letters that spell \"chai\", meaning \"living\", add up to 18. Because 36 = 2×18, it represents \"two lives\".\n\nIn some Hasidic stories, disciples consider their Rebbes and other religious figures to be among the \"Lamedvavniks\". It is also possible for a \"Lamedvavnik\" to reveal themselves as such, although that rarely happens—a \"Lamedvavnik\"'s status as an exemplar of humility would preclude it. More often, it is the disciples who speculate.\n\nThese beliefs are articulated in the works of Max Brod, and some (like Jorge Luis Borges) believe the concept to have originated in the Book of Genesis 18:26:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4502477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4502477", "title": "Victor Henry Anderson", "text": "Victor Henry Anderson\n\nVictor Henry Anderson (May 21, 1917 – September 20, 2001) was an American Wiccan priest and poet. He was a founding member of the Feri Tradition, a form of the modern Pagan new religious movement of Wicca which was established in California during the 1960s. Much of his poetry was religious in nature, being devoted to Feri deities.\n\nBorn in Clayton, New Mexico, to a working-class family, Anderson was left visually impaired during childhood. His family regularly moved around within the United States during his early years, with Anderson claiming that encounters with Mexican, Hawaiian, and Haitian migrants led to him gaining an early understanding of these various cultures' magical practices. The family eventually settled in Oregon, and Anderson later claimed that it was here that he was initiated into a tradition of witchcraft by an African woman. He later claimed that, in 1932, he joined a magico-religious group known as the Harpy Coven which was based in Ashland and which dissolved in the 1940s. According to his description, the group was devoted to a god and goddess, Setan and Lilith, and were influenced by both American folk magic and Huna.\n\nIn 1944, he married Cora Cremeans in Bend, Oregon, and, inspired by the writings of English Wiccan Gerald Gardner, they founded the Mahaelani Coven, gaining followers of what became known as the Feri tradition. One of their first initiates was Gwydion Pendderwen, who was a significant influence on the development of the tradition, and who introduced elements from Alexandrian Wicca in to it. Anderson was a professional accordion player and wrote poetry for various American Pagan magazines. In 1970, he published his first book of poetry, \"Thorns of the Blood Rose\", which contained devotional religious poetry dedicated to the Goddess; it won the Clover International Poetry Competition Award in 1975. Anderson continued to promote the Feri tradition until his death, at which point April Niino was appointed as the new Grandmaster of the tradition.\n\nAnderson was born on May 21, 1917 at the Buffalo Horn Ranch in Clayton, New Mexico. His parents were Hilbart Alexander Anderson (1883–1952) and Mary Frances Anderson (née Smith, 1886–1973). Regarding his ethnic ancestry, he later stated that \"I am mostly Irish and Spanish with some Native American, including Polynesian\". He also claimed that his maternal great-grandmother had been one of the Blue Fugates, a community living in Appalachia whose skin had a blueish coloration due to methemoglobinemia. Anderson became almost completely blind when he was two years old, either because of an accident or untreated diabetes. By 1920, the family were living in Burkburnett, Wichita County, Texas, where a sister, Elsie Glenan Anderson, was born in February. Here, Hilbart worked as a floor worker on some of the many oil rigs in the town. From there they moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where they were recorded as living in the 1923–24 directory, and where Anderson later claimed that he had made many friends among Mexican migrant children. Anderson's later wife claimed that he was also instructed in how to use his etheric vision by \"Mexican Witches\" during childhood. The family next moved to Olustee, Oklahoma, where Hilbart's brother resided.\n\nAfter several months in Oklahoma they proceeded to the area around Ashland, Oregon, where Anderson claimed to have befriended Hawaiian and Haitian migrant families who were working as fruit pickers. Anderson often claimed that he had been instructed in the magical practices of Hawaiian Kahuna and Haitian Vodou, with his later wife referring to him as both \"one of the last Kahuna\" and \"a priest of Voudou\". He claimed to have been instructed in Vodou by Haitians who were working in southern Oregon. While living in that state he attended a school for the blind, although despite this was largely self-educated. The family moved around the state in the coming years; in August 1928 they were living in Pinehurst, where Hilbert was recorded as working as an engineer at a lumber mill in the 1930 census. By the 1940 census, the family were recorded as living in East Phoenix, Jackson county, Oregon, with Higbert adding that he had also been living there in 1935. At this point, Hilbert was working as a millwright and Mary as a trained nurse. In 1942 they were recorded as living in Ashland, and it was here that they attended the First Baptist Church, before relocating to Bend prior to 1944.\n\nAnderson claimed to be initiated into a tradition of witchcraft in 1926 by a woman \"of the Fairy race\", whom he elsewhere referred to as \"a priestess from Africa\".\nAnderson informed the journalist Margot Adler that when he was nine years old he encountered a small old woman sitting in the centre of a circle containing brass bowls of herbs. He alleged that he instinctively stripped naked and that she then sexually initiated him into a witchcraft tradition, during which he had a vision of a goddess and a horned god. After the vision, he claimed that they sat in the circle and she instructed him in the magical use of the various herbs, after which he was washed in butter, oil, and salt, before putting his clothes on and returning home. The Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White described this as being \"difficult to accept as a literal account\", but suggested that Anderson may have undergone a significant spiritual experience with an older woman in 1926, which was subsequently \"embellished into the later tale\" that he told Adler. A woman who knew Anderson, Cornelia Benavidez, later stated that \"He says that he became friends with a woman in the circus who was a fire dancer and when she got older worked the stands. She somehow joined the circus in South Africa and made her way to the US. When he first met her she was 60 years old and he was a nine-year-old boy. He knew her for 15 years\". Researcher WIlliam Wallworth provided potential supporting evidence for this claim when he noted that a number of the circuses that performed in Oregon during the 1920s and 1930s had Africans in their travelling retinues.\n\nAnderson claimed that in 1932 he was initiated into a witchcraft group in Ashland that he called the Harpy Coven, although remains the only source testifying to the group's existence. Research into the coven was later conducted by Valerie Voigt, the coordinator of the Pagan, Occult, and Witchcraft Special Interest Group of the United States branch of Mensa, who was also one of Anderson's students and who asked him about the group. According to her claims, the group were led by two figures, known as Maybelle \"Cardea\" Warren and Jerome Warren, with other members being Jim Murdoch, Patricia Fern, Tom C. (\"Arven\"), and Ruth D., the latter of whom was a preacher's wife. As related by Voigt, most of them had been immigrants from the Southern states, mainly from Alabama.\n\nAccording to Voigt, the coven placed an emphasis on practical magic rather than worship, theology, ethics, or ritual, and were eclectic in their practices, mixing Huna with forms of American folk magic. She noted that they did not worship a goddess but held to a belief in a god who was opposed to the God of Christianity. Moreover she claimed that they met together for both outdoor and indoor meetings, according to the phases of the moon. According to Voigt's account, Anderson also claimed that on occasion, the coven used a naked woman as their altar, and that the group disbanded after World War II broke out.\n\nAfter the Pagan studies scholar Aidan A. Kelly published a summary of Voigt's research, Anderson released an open letter dated to August 21, 1991, refuting many of Kelly's claims and referring to it as \"the stupid drivel of those who have only a shallow grasp of their alleged research.\" He stated that contrary to Kelly's assertions, the Harpy Coven had worshiped a goddess, who was known as Lilith, and that \"we did not think of her as merely the Goddess, but as God Herself\".\nHe added that the coven also venerated a consort of the Goddess, who was known as Setan, but \"although the Goddess tells us that away from the sweet influence of her love, he is the most terrible of all spirits, he is not the fallen angel or 'Satan' of Christianity or Islam\". Kelly later stated that the Harpy Coven might \"have been self-trained or may have descended from an earlier person or group\".\n\nAnderson met Cora Ann Cremeans in Bend, Oregon, in 1944; they married three days later, on 3 May, claiming that they had encountered each other before in the astral realm. Born in Nyota, Alabama, in January 1915, Cora had been exposed to folk magical practices from childhood; reputedly, her Irish grandfather was a \"root doctor\" who was known among locals as the \"druid\". The Andersons claimed that one of their first acts after their marriage was the erection of an altar. The following year, a son was born, and they named him Victor Elon, with the latter being the Hebrew word for oak; Cora claimed that she had received the name in a dream. After the birth, a ritual was held to dedicate the infant to the Goddess. In 1948, the family moved to Niles, California, later that year purchasing a home in San Leandro. There, Anderson became a member of the Alameda Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Eagles, and he subsequently remained so for forty years. Victor earned his living as a musician, playing the accordion at events, while Cora worked as a hospital cook. It has been claimed that Anderson could speak Hawaiian, Spanish, Creole, Greek, Italian, and Gothic.\n\nIn the mid-1950s Victor and Cora read \"Witchcraft Today\", a 1954 book by English Wiccan Gerald Gardner, with Cora claiming that Victor corresponded with Gardner for a time. The Pagan studies scholar Chas S. Clifton has suggested that the Andersons used Gardner's work as a \"style guide\" for the development of their own tradition of modern Pagan witchcraft. Similarly, Kelly stated that the Andersons' tradition \"began to more and more resemble that of the Gardnerians\" as the couple learned more about the latter, adopting elements from it.\nAnderson was in correspondence with the Italian-American Wiccan Leo Martello, who encouraged Anderson to found his own coven. Circa 1960, the Andersons founded a coven, naming it Mahaelani, after the Hawaiian word for the full moon. Throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Andersons initiated a number of individuals into the coven. One of these was Gwydion Pendderwen, a friend of their son who shared their interest in the esoteric. Pendderwen contributed to the development of what came to be known as the Feri tradition, with some members of the lineage viewing him as its co-founder. Pendderwen noted that he had first met the family when, aged thirteen, he got into a fight with Victor Elon, although the two later became friends. Pendderwen was particularly influenced by Welsh mythology, and on a visit to Britain he spent time with the Alexandrian Wiccans Alex Sanders and Stewart Farrar, subsequently introducing various Alexandrian elements into Feri Wicca. In the early 1970s, the Andersons established a new coven with Pendderwen and his initiate, Alison Harlow. After Pendderwen married, his wife also joined this coven, although it disbanded in 1974.\n\nOver the next four decades, the Andersons would initiate between twenty-five and thirty people into their tradition.\nAnderson has been described as one of the \"founding teachers\" and the \"seminal voice\" of the Feri tradition, although – according to Feri initiate Storm Faerywolf – he preferred to refer to himself as \"Grand Master and a fairy chief\". The original word that the Andersons used for their tradition was \"Vicia\", \"pronounced as in Italian.\" She added that \"the name Fairy became accidentally attached to our tradition because Victor so often mentioned that word in speaking of nature spirits and Celtic magic\". Early initiates alternately spelled the name of the tradition as \"Fairy\", \"Faery\", or \"Faerie\", although Anderson began using the spelling \"Feri\" during the 1990s to differentiate it from other witchcraft traditions of the same name; not all practitioners followed his example. Cora claimed that \"Feri\" was the word's original spelling, adding that it meant \"the things of magic\". Anderson also referred to his form of Wicca as the \"Pictish\" tradition. In their writing, the Andersons mixed terminology adopted from Huna, Gardnerian Wicca, and Voodoo, believing that all reflected the same underlying magico-religious tradition. It drew heavily upon the huna system developed by Max Freedom Long. According to one Feri initiate, Corvia Blackthorn:\n\nAccording to Kelly:\n\nAccording to one initiate, Jim Schuette, Anderson was \"a taskmaster. He took pride in testing his students.\"\nOne of those initiated into the Anderson's Feri tradition was Starhawk, who incorporated ideas from the Feri tradition when creating Reclaiming. She also included aspects from it in her 1979 book, \"The Spiral Dance\", including mention of the Iron and Pearl Pentagram and the three souls, all of which originated within Feri Wicca.\nAnother prominent initiate was Gabriel Carillo (Caradoc ap Cador), who in the late 1970s developed a written body of Feri teachings, and began offering paid classes in the tradition in the 1980s, generating the Bloodrose lineage; doing so generated controversy among Feri initiates, with critics believing that it was morally wrong to charge for teaching.\n\nIn 1970 Anderson privately published \"Thorns of the Blood Rose\", which contained poems that he had authored over the previous 25 years. He stated that \"every poem is a love letter to the Goddess\". Money to publish the book had come from Cora's savings, with sales barely covering the costs of publication, so a second printing was not possible at that time.\nIn 1975, this book received the Clover International Poetry Competition Award, and in 1980 it was republished by Pendderwen, who also put some of Anderson's poems to music for his own 1975 album, \"Songs for the Old Religion\". Anderson also contributed work to Pagan magazines like \"Witch Eye\", \"Green Egg\", and \"Nemeton\". Anderson had assembled a group of poems to be published as a second book, released posthumously as \"Lilith's Garden\" in 2005.\n\nTo honor her fiftieth wedding anniversary, in 1994 Cora authored a book titled \"Fifty Years in the Feri Tradition\", deeming it a tribute to her husband. It has been termed \"the definitive written work on Feri thealogy and thought\". In 1998, Cora suffered a stroke and was left largely bedridden by its effects.\n\nAt the time of his death, he was still running a coven, which was known as Nostos or Blue Circle. He died at his home on September 20, 2001. He was survived by his wife, son, and various grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Cora then appointed a woman named Anaar, or April Niino, to be the new Grandmaster of the Feri tradition in summer 2003. The tradition itself survived, with various publications appearing that discussed the practice of magic from a Feri perspective.\n\nAnderson's Feri Wicca tradition theistically revolved around a Goddess, who was named \"Mari\" after the Basque folkloric character. In Feri theology, Mari was accompanied by a male consort, a Horned God named Krom. Krom was also viewed as a union of two separate entities, the Divine Twins. Cora claimed that the Goddess had created these Twins, \"not because she had to have male help, but because in her divine lust she desired them\".\nAccording to Anderson, the name \"Mari\" meant \"mother of water\", and he described both Mari and Krom as having been the deity names of \"the tiny dark aborigines of Scotland, Ireland, and the ancient British Isles\". The God was also referred to as \"Melek Taus\". He stressed the view that these deities were real entities, rather than Jungian archetypes, the latter being a view that had been espoused by other Pagans.\n\nSystems of morality in Feri revolved largely around the idea of \"kala\"; Cora stated that this term was borrowed from the Hawaiian language and that it meant \"keep[ing] oneself clean and bright and free from complexes within and without\".\nCora stated that the Feri tradition had \"a code of honor and sexual morality which is as tough and demanding as the Bushido of Japan and of Shinto\". She added that while Christian missionaries would understand Feri as a \"sex cult\", \"we do not behave like a bunch of slavering mad dogs in heat\". Initiation into Feri was a sexual act, and according to Cora \"in initiation you literally marry the Goddess, her dual consort and the Gods, whether you are male or female\". It involved a male priest giving the female initiate the names of the God and Goddess upon orgasm. If the female initiate was already betrothed to another, or did otherwise not wish to have intercourse with the priest, then a ritual known as the Intentions of the Heart took place. In this, her next sexual act with another person would be considered her initiation. When a female initiated a male, there was a similarly sexual component although according to Cora, \"there are some important differences\".\n\nThe Andersons taught that there were three parts of the soul, with Doyle White believing that they had adopted this belief from those of Hawaii. Cora stated that the first part of the soul inhabited \"the etheric body or double\", surrounding and penetrating the physical body, extending about 2 cm from human flesh and colored either \"a misty blue-gray\" or \"a lovely electric pink\". According to her, the second part of the soul inhabited the aura and extended 8 to 9 inches from the physical body. She believed that the third part of the soul was \"the Godself\" and lived in the top of the aura, appearing as a blue, white or gold ball of light. The Andersons also expressed a belief in reincarnation, believing that the allocation of one's future births were organized by karma. They taught that between incarnations, a soul could travel to one of nine etheric globes surrounding the Earth, in which existed \"well-defined classes of nature spirits\" which included gnomes, sylphs, undines, and salamanders.\n\nCora described Feri as the \"direct survival of old Stone Age religion\", reflecting a trend within the Wiccan community for retaining faith in the witch-cult hypothesis long after it was academically discredited by historians. The Andersons believed that the Witchcraft religion had emerged in Africa and been spread throughout the world, believing that Feri Wicca was essentially the same as Sami indigenous religion, Voudou, and Santeria. She believed that the ritual tools of \"the Craft\" were \"very much alike throughout the world in both time and place\". She listed the ritual tools as an athame \"to raise or focus power\", a binding cord for use in \"ritual liberation and unbinding\", as well as a scourge \"to raise power\", although the latter was never used to whip human beings. A chalice is used in rituals, symbolizing \"the yoni female receptacle of the life force\", with an accompanying stone or wax phallus which is sometimes dipped into the chalice during rituals. A stone or wooden egg \"honors the cosmic egg which God held in her womb\". Cora stated that in their rituals \"power is raised and used in magic operations for the good of our human race, our ecology, or for necessary martial purposes\".\n\nAccording to Adler, Anderson had \"a very poetic way of looking at the world\". Alison Harlow had informed her that Anderson's claims about his origins often changed, with Doyle White commenting that \"Anderson believed that the telling of spiritual 'truths' through stories was more important than factual accounts of the past\".\nAnderson described Feri witchcraft as \"a devotional science\", and his wife called him \"an Einstein of the occult\". Cora claimed that the couple were \"scientists in the truest sense\".\nAdler noted that some of the \"hallmarks\" of the Feri tradition were its \"shamanic practices and sexual mysticism\". It only involved one initiation. There is no set book of liturgy in the tradition, with teachings being passed down orally.\nPractitioner Storm Faerywolf noted that \"the Feri tradition is less about specific practices and more about energetic experience\".\n\n"}
{"id": "17108588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17108588", "title": "Vladimir Slepian", "text": "Vladimir Slepian\n\nVladimir Slepian, a.k.a. Eric Pid (; 1930 – 7 July 1998) is a French artist and writer of Russian-Jewish origin.\n\nSon of a repressed and executed Soviet functionary, Vladimir Slepian was born in Prague and resided in Leningrad before moving to Moscow. He began his university studies in mathematics, continuing as a student of fine art. In 1956 Slepian moved to Moscow. He attended the Picasso exhibition at the Pushkin Museum and presented his paintings to David Burliuk, who was then staying at Hotel Moskva. Burliuk inspired Slepian to look towards the way Jackson Pollock deposited paint on canvas with broad, lunging, spontaneous gestures. Slepian’s style evolved towards happening and performance art. He devoted several years to action painting. On one occasion, Slepian conducted a séance of simultaneous painting in collaboration with Yuri Zlotnikov. They suspended a bedsheet in the middle of a room and each of them painted one side of it whilst following the actions of his partner on the other side through the translucent fabric. Slepian created abstract paintings using a gas torch and paint dispensed out of a pump. He is said to have worked on a canvas a few kilometers long, by pouring paint on it from a truck. Slepian also made a pilgrimage to Nazım Hikmet, who assured him and his friends that modern art will prevail over political oppression. In 1957 Paris' Right Bank Galerie Daniel Cordier mounted an anonymous exhibition of paintings by Vladimir Slepian, smuggled out of Moscow by its owner.\n\nVladimir Slepian emigrated to France in 1958, by way of Poland. In 1960 he conducted a performance of “transfinite painting” (\"трансфинитная живопись\") in Paris. Slepian sprinted along a roll of paper a hundred meters long, depositing paint in a manner that recalled calligraphy. Slepian competed with Georges Mathieu, by creating a picture in ninety seconds. He is said to have turned a road into an action painting by throwing paint onto it whilst riding a motorcycle. In 1963, Slepian gave up painting, resolving to concentrate on writing. He founded a successful translation bureau, explaining his ambition as using his intelligence to put others to work for his benefit, whilst enjoying idleness. His business operated successfully until its manager quit in a protest against Slepian’s despotism.\n\nIn his only published French text, a short story \"Fils de chien\", Vladimir Slepian writes of a man who decides to become a dog. He transforms himself one limb and one organ at a time, mapping the effects of the canine body across a human form in a kind of diagramming. Since dogs are quadrupeds, he ties shoes to his hands and feet. When his paws prevent him from lacing the fourth shoe, he uses his mouth, which becomes a dog's snout. This metamorphosis almost succeeds, until the hero comes to the dog’s tail, for which he can find no analogue among human limbs. For him to involve his sexual organ in this transmogrification would tear him away from the society that he has begun to flee. Who would he be, if his identity could not be inferred from his anatomy? The story ends with a descent into childhood memories of the protagonist's mother. It appeared in n° 7 of the \"Revue Minuit\" alongside texts by Samuel Beckett, Robert Pinget, and Alain Robbe-Grillet. It served as inspiration for discussion by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari in \"A Thousand Plateaus\".\n\nSeveral years later, Vladimir Slepian renamed himself Eric Pid. He explained his new French name as an anagram of the blind king Oedipus, alluding to blindness at the etymological origins of his Russian family name. In his later years, Slepian succeeded at having his dramatic text staged as an interpolation in \"A quand Agamemnon ?\", an adaptation of Aeschylus’ \"Agamemnon\" by Philippe Brunet and Demodocos, a band of young artists specialized in classical theatre, performed in French, Latin and/or ancient Greek. He went around Paris, distributing framed photographs of this performance for wall display at restaurants. On 7 July 1998, Slepian collapsed on a sidewalk at Saint-Germain des Prés.

Rajamouli has done an excellent job molding NTR Jr's character in the film much like his grandfather's and also for bringing NTR back on the screen in an animated form. NTR Jr's overall performance and his dialogue delivery are a joy to watch. Mohanbabu playing 'Yama' once again proved to be the versatile actor that he is\".\n\nSify gave an \"average\" verdict explained \"This socio-fantasy film works, thanks to the new look of NTR and enigmatic performance of Mohan Babu. The songs and background score of MM Keeravani, the technical aspects and entertainer quotient in the first half make the film watchable\". jeevi of idlebrain gave 3/5 stars said \"First half of the film is entertaining. The second half should have been better. The plus points of the film are Mohan Babu, NTR, sets, cinematography and music. On the flip side, the screenplay of the film is not gripping in second half (after NTR returns to earth). The runtime of the film is pretty lengthy (3.05 hours)\".\n\nThe film became a blockbuster and ran 50-days in 405 centers.

Its usage may be controversial in modern English language. It is not usually considered offensive when pronounced (rhyming with \"deed\"), the way Yiddish speakers say it, though some may deem the word offensive nonetheless. When pronounced (rhyming with \"did\") by non-Jews, it is commonly intended as a pejorative term. It is used as a derogatory epithet by antisemites along with, and as an alternative to, the English word 'Jew'.\n\nThe term \"Yid\" has its origins in the Middle High German word ' (the contemporary German word is ').\n\nLeo Rosten provides the following etymology:\nFrom the German: Jude: 'Jew.' And 'Jude' is a truncated form of Yehuda, which was the name given to the Jewish Commonwealth in the period of the Second Temple. That name, in turn, was derived from the name of one of Jacob's sons, Yehuda (Judah, in English), whose descendants constituted one of the tribes of Israel and who settled in that portion of Canaan from Jerusalem south to Kadesh-Barnea (50 miles south of Beersheba) and from Jericho westwards to the Mediterranean.\n\nThe earliest mention of the word \"Yid\" in print was in \"The Slang Dictionary\" published by John Camden Hotten in 1874. Hotten noted that \"The Jews use these terms very frequently.\"\n\nAfter World War II, most examples of the word \"Yid\" are found in the writing of Jewish authors. These occurrences are usually either attempts to accurately portray antisemitic speech, or as self-deprecating Jewish humor. In his 1968 bestseller \"The Joys of Yiddish\", Leo Rosten offers a number of anecdotes from the \"Borscht Belt\" to illustrate such usage.\n\nIn Yiddish, the word \"Yid\" is neutral or even complimentary, and in Ashkenazi Yiddish-speaking circles it is frequently used to mean simply \"fellow,\" \"chap,\" \"buddy,\" \"mate,\" etc., with no expressed emphasis on Jewishness (although this may be implied by the intra-Jewish context). Plural is .\n\nIn Yiddish, a polite way to address a fellow Jew whose name one does not know is \"Reb Yid,\" meaning \"Sir.\" The Yiddish words \"yidish\" or \"yiddisher\" (from Middle High German \"jüdisch\") is an adjective derived from the noun \"Yid,\" and thus means \"Jewish\".\n\nSome Jewish and non-Jewish fans of Tottenham Hotspur F.C. adopted \"Yid\" (or \"Yiddo\") as a nickname and \"Yiddo, Yiddo!\" as a battle cry and often identify themselves as \"Yid Army\". While such usage remains controversial, for the majority of Tottenham supporters it is used with pride. Some Jewish Tottenham supporters use it with a political consciousness of the club as a bastion against racism and antisemitism. Fans of other clubs use the term as a pejorative because it is perceived that many Tottenham Hotspur fans are Jewish. This following started in the 1890s and 1900s when the club was the team of choice for \"East-enders\" – including large numbers of Jewish immigrants – who could easily get cheap buses and trams to Tottenham, heading north along the road later designated the A10. East-end Jews have mostly moved to the north and east London suburbs and Herts and Essex, but support for Tottenham Hotspur continues to run in families (a famous example is Alan Sugar). For visiting teams' supporters the Jewish connection continues to be bolstered by the large numbers of – easily identifiable – Haredi Orthodox Jews living in the South Tottenham and Stamford Hill areas; but in practice there is no evidence of Haredi Jews attending football matches. Nevertheless, it is not necessary to be Haredi to be Jewish, and Spurs still has a strong Jewish fanbase. \n"}
