For some his work has been described as crossing the line between photography and painting, his photographs are works unique to the art form of photography.\n\nBorn in New York City, Siskind grew up on the Lower East Side. Shortly after graduating from City College, he became a public school English teacher. In 1950 Siskind met Harry Callahan when both were teaching at Black Mountain College in the summer. Later, Callahan persuaded Siskind to join him as part of the faculty of the IIT Institute of Design in Chicago (founded by László Moholy-Nagy as the New Bauhaus).

The first known Bishop of Lisieux is one Theodibandes, mentioned in connection with a council held in 538.\n\nThe bishopric was suppressed during the French revolution and was not reinstated. Present day Lisieux is part of the Diocese of Bayeux.\n\nA list of alleged early bishops of Lisieux was included in the \"Ritual of Lisieux\", published in 1661 under the direction of Bishop Léonor (I ) Goyon de Matignon. The list, however, was padded with the names of saints whose putative relics were stored in the Cathedral. These included Saint Ursinus, Saint Patrick and Saint Cande, none of whom can be shown to have been a bishop. The Bishop of Lisieux was ex-officio Conservator of the University of Caen.\n\nThe Chapter of the Cathedral of Saint-Pierre was composed of nine dignities and thirty Canons. The dignities were: the Dean, the Cantor, the Treasurer, the Capicerio, the Magister Scholarum, and the four Archdeacons (Lieuven, Auge, Pont-Audemer, and Gacé). All were appointed by the bishop, except the Dean, who was elected by the Chapter. There were thirty-one prebends, the first eleven of whom were called 'Barons'. The Cathedral also had four Vicars and thirty chaplains.\n\nThe diocese of Lisieux contained 487 parishes and 520 rectories. The diocese had six abbeys for men and two for women. Five of the abbeys belonged to the Order of Saint Benedict (Saint-Evroul, Bernay, Préaux, Grestain, Cormeilles). The Premonstratensians had an abbey at Mont-Dée (Mondaye). The two convents for women belonged to the Order of Saint Benedict (Saint-Léger, Saint-Désir).\n\nA synod was held at Lisieux in 1055 by the Papal Legate, Bishop Hermanfried of Sion, with the cooperation of Duke William the Bastard (future king of England), in which Archbishop Malgerius of Rouen was deposed. His dissolute life was notorious, he had refused to attend a Roman Council though summoned, and he made rebellion against the Duke. The deposition had already been agreed to by Pope Leo IX.\n\nIn the middle of October 1106, King Henry I of England visited Lisieux, where he held an assembly of the leaders of the duchy of Normandy, both lay and ecclesiastical. He dealt with the disorders which had been caused by his brother Robert, taking hostages (who were sent to England) including Duke Robert, and condemning to imprisonment for life Count Guillaume Werlenc of Mortain, Robert d'Estouteville, and several others.\n\nThe Collége de Lisieux was founded at Paris in 1336 by Bishop Guy de Harcourt, Bishop of Lisieux, by testamentary bequest, and with additional endowments from three members of the d'Estouteville family. It supported twenty-four poor students of the diocese. It lasted until 1764, when it was transferred to the Collège de Dormans.\n\nIn August 1417, King Henry V of England besieged, captured and sacked the city of Lisieux. When the Bishop of Lisieux, Pierre Fresnel, was killed in street fighting in Paris on 12 June 1418, King Henry considered it a good moment to install a bishop in Lisieux who would be favorable to the English cause. His wishes ran contrary to those of Pope Martin V, leading to the appointment of Cardinal Branda Castiglione as administrator of the diocese. When Henry died on 31 August 1422, Martin V was able to appoint Castiglione's nephew as the bishop.\n\n\n\n"}

Cohen recounts that his life was changed by a spontaneous experience of \"cosmic consciousness\" at the age of sixteen. After pursuing a career as a jazz musician, he began a spiritual quest to recover this experience when he was 22. He eventually met H. W. L. Poonja in 1986, a self-styled teacher who taught that no effort is needed to attain enlightenment \"because it is merely the realisation of what one already is\". At their first meeting, Cohen realized that he \"had always been free\". Cohen claimed that Poonja declared Cohen to be his heir, and Cohen began to teach as a neo-Advaita teacher, and gathered a community around him.\n\nWithin a few years, Cohen noticed that the ecstatic experiences his students had in his presence were limited. Being convinced that he himself was fully free from karmic bondage, he began to demand more commitment from his students, insisting on complete \"ego-transcendence\". The change in teaching-style led to dissent, and a break with Poonja, who was now regarded by Cohen as shortcoming in ethical and enlightened behavior.\n\nAccording to Cohen, \"Poonja insisted that the realization of the Self had nothing to do with worldly behavior, and he did not believe fully transcending the ego was possible.\" According to Poonja, \"karmic tendencies remained after enlightenment, [but] the enlightened person was no longer identified with them and, therefore, did not accrue further karmic consequences.\" For Poonja, ethical standards were based on a dualistic understanding of duality and the notion of an individual agent, and therefore were not representative of Advaita: \"For Poonja, the goal was the realisation of the self; the illusory realm of relative reality was ultimately irrelevant.\" Cohen did not agree, insisting instead on \"flawless behavior\" as the manifestation of enlightenment.\n\nIn 1991 Cohen founded \"EnlightenNext\" magazine (under its former title, \"What Is Enlightenment?\"), which \"established him as a major contemporary spiritual figure.\" In 2004, \"EnlightenNext\" magazine partnered with the Graduate Institute in Connecticut to offer a master's program in conscious evolution. From 2004 to 2007, Cohen served as a core faculty of that institute. The magazine stopped publishing in 2011.\n\nAfter the break with Poonja, Cohen's teachings were further developed into \"Evolutionary Enlightenment\", aiming at an impersonal enlightenment which transcends the personal. Yet, the change in teaching-style led also to \"physical force, verbal abuse, and intense psychological pressure against students.\" The growing complaints from students have been described in several publications from former students and from his own mother.\n\nIn 2001, Cohen co-formed the jazz-funk-fusion band Unfulfilled Desires, in which he played drums. The band played original compositions and standards, and performed in Europe and the United States. They released four CDs: \"Live at the Iron Horse\" (2002), \"Enlightened Dog\" (2004), \"Punk Funk\" (2008), and \"Plugged\" (2010).\n\nOn June 26, 2013, Cohen announced on his blog that he would be taking \"a sabbatical for an extended period of time\", after confrontational exchanges with some of his closest students, who helped Cohen to realize, as he put it, that \"in spite of the depth of my awakening, my ego is still alive and well\". \n\nOn May 12, 2015, Cohen posted an extensive apology letter to his former students on his blog, his first writing after emerging from a two-year sabbatical. In it he wrote about the need to embrace the spiritual principle of agape, as well as eros, and expressed regret for the ways in which his lack of the former in his teaching methods hurt and alienated many former students.\n\nIn September 2016, after over three years absence from public life, Cohen unveiled a redesigned website. This included an announcement of his intention to return to formal teaching, beginning with a retreat planned for early 2017.\n\nWhen beginning to teach, Cohen was influenced by H. W. L. Poonja, who offered a \"deinstitutionalised and experiential Advaita,\" comparable to Ramana Maharshi's teachings, which differ from the traditional Advaita Vedanta of Shankara. Cohen credits the ideas of cosmologist Brian Swimme, Christian theologian Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and the early 20th century Indian mystic Sri Aurobindo as helping him form his thinking about the evolutionary context of the human experience. He likewise credits the \"integral philosopher\" Ken Wilber, with whom he conducts frequent public discourses, with helping him form the theoretical framework of his teachings. He has also been influenced by the Spiral Dynamics theories put forward by Clare Graves. Cohen was also inspired by Swami Krishnananda of the Divine Life Society in India, and his call \"In unity there is strength; come together, come together.\"\n\nAccording to Cohen, \"traditional\" enlightenment is the realization of the transcendental aspect of God, and it often goes hand in hand with the realization that the world is an illusion.\n\nCohen says that he has discovered a different form of \"enlightened awareness,\" which he claims to be unique. He first called this \"impersonal enlightenment\" to reflect the fact that it was a realization shared between people rather than an individual attainment. He later changed the name to Evolutionary Enlightenment, both to reflect his belief that it indicates the next stage of the evolution of enlightenment and to convey the creative, world-embracing vision of spiritual awakening as an unending process of individual and cultural development.\n\nA fundamental aspect of Cohen's Evolutionary Enlightenment is the distinction between what he sees as two fundamental, yet opposing, aspects of the human psyche: the \"ego\" and the \"authentic self\", In his teaching, ego is defined as \"the deeply ingrained, compulsive need to remain separate and superior at all times, in all places, under all circumstances.\" The authentic self, on the other hand, is defined as \"the urge to become more conscious\".\n\nAccording to Cohen and Wilber, \"enlightenment\" does not refer to an unchanging state, but has to be in accord with an ongoing evolution of humanity, which is the \"Authentic Self.\" According to Cohen, individuals need to recognize that their own spiritual transformation is essential for cultural evolution. To achieve that, in Cohen's view, an individual should strive to realize his or her true self as being \"one with the timeless Ground of all Being and with the evolutionary impulse that is driving the entire cosmos.\"\n\nAccording to Wilber, evolutionary enlightenment means \"the realization of oneness with all states and all stages that have evolved so far and that are in existence at any given time.\" Cohen believes that individuals need to transcend egoism to express the \"Authentic Self.\" Through identifying the evolutionary impulse as their own Authentic Self, individuals can transcend ego, and find a deeper self-sense without relying on asceticism or solitude.\n\nCohen's ideas are co-inspired by Wilber's Integral Theory, offering an integral vision of the integral evolution of matter and consciousness. According to this theory, human development parallels the evolution of all being.\n\nIn 2012 Watkins Books listed Cohen at Number 28 on their \"Spiritual 100\" list.\n\nHWL Poonja, also known as Papaji, the Indian Guru who Andrew claims called him his \"heir\" stated publicly that Andrew only spent 25 hours in satsang before proclaiming himself as enlightened. Papaji describes Andrew's claims as the arrogance of his ego and never acknowledged Andrew as a master or heir, but rather described him as a messenger. The mental, physical, and financial abuse Andrew perpetrated against former students, which Andrew justifies as \"crazy wisdom\" are documented in books such as \"American Guru\", \"Enlightenment Blues\", and \"Mother of God\", as well as popular blogs such as \"What Enlightenment?\" and \"EnlightenNixt\".\n\nSome of Cohen's former followers, including his mother, Luna Tarlo, have viewed him as a manipulative spiritual teacher. Tarlo wrote a critical book, called \"Mother of God\", about her experience as one of his disciples. In a \"Psychology Today\", article, published in 1998 entitled \"Crimes of the Soul\", Tarlo recounted how she became a disciple of her son who told her \"to give way to him or their relationship would end\" and forbade her \"to express an opinion on anything\". Tarlo said she \"knew if I seriously objected to anything, I'd be kicked out\" and stated that her son, formerly the \"sweetest, sensitive kid, had changed into an unrecognizable tyrant.\"\n\nAndré van der Braak's \"Enlightenment Blues: My Years with an American Guru\" alleges that Cohen demanded large sums of money and extreme and unquestioning devotion from his students.\n\n\"American Guru: A Story of Love, Betrayal and Healing\", by William Yenner and other former Cohen student contributors (foreword by Stephen Batchelor), allege authoritarianism, financial manipulation, physical and psychological abuse in Cohen's community, and discusses the challenges of healing after leaving the community.\n\nPoonja himself has been sharply criticized for too easily authorising students to teach:\nOver the years, there were many indications that Cohen’s group was in difficult financial straits. In 2011 it officially ended publication of its magazine \"EnlightenNext\". Cohen was accused of being a cult leader. As of early 2014, the EnlightenNext organization's main building on its property in Lenox, Massachusetts, which had been on the market for years, remained up for sale.\n\nIn 2016, over 200 of Cohen's former students signed an online petition titled \"Stop Andrew Cohen teaching again\", including detailed explanations of why they believe him to be unfit to teach others.\n\nCohen has written for \"The Huffington Post\" \"Big Think\", and \"Speaking Tree\",\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1779414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1779414", "title": "Apostolic prefect", "text": "Apostolic prefect\n\nAn apostolic prefect or prefect apostolic is a priest who heads what is known as an apostolic prefecture, a 'pre-diocesan' missionary jurisdiction where the Catholic Church is not yet sufficiently developed to have it made a diocese. Although it usually has an (embryonal) see, sometimes even a cathedral it is often not called after such city but rather after a natural and/or administrative (in many cases colonial) geographical area: region(s), sometimes a country or even larger.\n\nIf a prefecture grows and flourishes, it may be elevated to an apostolic vicariate, headed by a titular bishop, in the hope that with time the region will generate enough Catholics and stability for its Catholic institutions, to warrant being established as a diocese. Both these stages remain missionary, hence exempt, i.e. directly subject to the Holy See (notably the Roman Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples), normally not part of an ecclesiastical province.\n\nThe full sequence of development is: independent mission, apostolic prefecture, apostolic vicariate, apostolic diocese; however steps may be skipped at the papal discretion, so the next steps may be bishopric or even archbishopric.\n\nThe apostolic prefecture and the apostolic vicariate are to be distinguished from the territorial abbacy (formerly called an \"abbey nullius\").\n\nDuring the last centuries of the second millennium it was the practice of the Holy See to govern either through prefects apostolic or apostolic vicariates, many territories where no dioceses with resident bishops were erected and where local circumstances, such as the character and customs of the people or hostility of civil powers, made it doubtful whether an episcopal see could be permanently established. The establishing of a prefecture apostolic in a place supposes that the Church has attained only a small development in the area. Fuller growth leads to the foundation of an apostolic vicariate as an intermediate stage to becoming a diocese.\n\nA prefect apostolic is of lower rank than a vicar apostolic. The prefect's powers are more limited and do not normally possess the episcopal character, as is ordinarily the case with a vicar apostolic. The duties of a prefect apostolic consist in directing the work of the mission entrusted to his care; his powers are in general those necessarily connected with the ordinary administration of such an office, for instance: the assigning of missionaries and the making of regulations for the good management of the affairs of the mission. Until the Second Vatican Council, the prefect apostolic had extraordinary faculties for several cases reserved otherwise to diocesan bishops, such as absolutions from censures, dispensations from matrimonial impediments and the faculty of consecrating chalices, patens, and portable altars, with some having the power to administer Confirmation.\n\nPrefects apostolic govern independent territories and are subject only to the pope. When a vicariate or a diocese extended over a very large territory in which the Catholic population was unequally distributed, the Holy See sometimes placed a portion of the territory in charge of a prefect apostolic; in which case the faculties of the prefect were more limited, and in the exercise of his office he was supervised by the vicar apostolic or the diocesan bishop. With a view to better protecting the authority of the local vicar apostolic or bishop, it was proposed in the First Vatican Council to abolish prefects apostolic having jurisdiction over districts within a vicariate or diocese of the Latin Rite, but the Council was interrupted and the practice continued until Pope Leo XIII abolished them within the Oriental Churches by a decree of Propaganda Fide on 12 September 1896, and established superiors with special dependence on the papal representatives of the areas concerned.\n\nIn 1911 there were 66 prefectures apostolic: 5 in Europe; 17 in Asia; 3 in North America (e.g., the Yukon); 11 in South America; 23 in Africa and 7 in Oceania.\n\nAt the end of 2010, the prefectures apostolic were only 39, of which the vast majority (29) were in PR China (many vacant), where development of the Catholic Church, including that of the prefectures, had long been hindered by actions of the government. The 10 other prefectures included a newly created one for Azerbaijan, 4 more in Asia, 3 in Africa, 1 in the Americas and 1 in Oceania.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost former apostolic prefectures were promoted to apostolic vicariate or territorial prelature (under a titular bishop) and/or (mostly later) to diocese or even archdiocese (under a residential bishop), but some ceased to exist (at least under their name or extent), being suppressed or sometimes dismembered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5584650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5584650", "title": "Arthur Drews", "text": "Arthur Drews\n\nChristian Heinrich Arthur Drews (; November 1, 1865 – July 19, 1935) was a German writer, historian, philosopher, and important representative of German monist thought. He was born in Uetersen, Holstein, in present-day Germany.\n\nDrews became a professor of philosophy and German language at the Technische Hochschule in Karlsruhe. During his career he wrote widely on the histories of philosophy, religions and mythology. He was a disciple of Eduard von Hartmann who claimed that reality is the \"unconscious World Spirit\", also expressed in history through religions and the formation of consciousness in the minds of philosophers. Drews often provoked controversy, in part because of his unorthodox ideas on religion and in part because of his attacks on Nietzsche and passionate support of Wagner. He rose to international prominence with his book \"The Christ Myth\" (1909), by amplifying and publicizing the thesis initially advanced by Bruno Bauer, which denies the historicity of Jesus.\n\nThe international controversy provoked by the \"Christ Myth\" was an early part of Drews's lifelong advocacy of the abandonment of Judaism and Christianity, both of which he regarded as based on ancient beliefs from antiquity, and shaped by religious dualism. He urged a \"renewal of faith\" [\"Glaubenserneuerung\"] based on Monism and German Idealism. He asserted that true religion could not be reduced to a cult of personality, even if based on the worship of the \"unique and great personality\" of a historical Jesus, as claimed by Protestant liberal theologians, which he argued was nothing more than the adaptation of the Great Man Theory of history promoted by Romanticism of the 19th century.\n\nDrews was considered a dissenter. Many German academics didn't accept his \"dilettantism\" (\"abweichungen von der communis opinio\", that is, \"straying from common opinions\"). Drews was a reformer, and stayed involved in religious activism all his life. He was, in his last few years, to witness and participate in an attempt by the to inspire a more liberal form of worship. This was his reason for parting with the German Faith Movement, a venture trying to promote (without success) an awakening of a \"German Faith\", an unusual form of nationalistic and racist faith with Hindu overtones — far removed from the elitist German Idealism Drews expounded in his last book, \"The German Religion\" (\"Deutsche Religion\", 1935) which he had hoped to see replace Christianity and what he considered its primitive superstitions. Later, Drews came back to the same subject in \"The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus in Past and Present\" (1926), which is a historical review of some 35 major deniers of Jesus historicity, covering the period 1780–1926.\n\nDuring Drews's life, Germany was going through turbulent times, both politically and culturally. Friedrich Nietzsche had become a prominent cultural icon while Richard Wagner was a highly controversial personality. Nietzsche was a strong critic of Christianity and its morality, which he perceived as glorifying weakness and death. At first he was a friend and admirer of Wagner, but soon became a disgruntled critic, turning against his previous friend. He reproached Wagner for his conversion to anti-semitic Christianity and his glorification of medieval sagas and spiritual chastity as the sign of a decadent, dying culture. He posited that Wagner's \"unending melody\" only dramatizes theatrical posing and is hostile to the affirmation of vital Dionysian life forces. Nietzsche claimed that Wagner's art was not Germanic, but closer to Italy's Roman Catholicism. Nietzsche passionately critiqued Wagner's ideas, detailed in \"Nietzsche contra Wagner\".\n\nDrews was a staunch supporter of Wagner and wrote many books and articles on Wagner's religious and nationalistic ideas, which are still considered by some scholars to be important works on the subject. He also embarked on a critique of Nietzsche, who was a lifelong critic of Christianity and Christian morality. Drews reproached Nietzsche for being an apostle of unbridled individualism — a stance which put Drews in an awkward position in the German establishment. His criticisms were never well received by academics nor by German society as a whole, since Nietzsche had become a national figure.\n\nIn 1904, Drews gave a critical lecture in Münich on the philosophy of Nietzsche, \"Nietzsches Philosophie\". \"[Nietzsche] is not aiming at bypassing morality as such, only the external morality which imposes its commandments to the individual, and results in the decay and submission of the Self. He would like to counter this old morality enemy of the Self with a \"new morality springing from the individual will\" and in conformity with his nature.\" [emphasis added] Drews continued with his philosophical critique of Nietzsche in \"Nietzsche als Antipode Wagners\", 1919 [\"Nietzsche, Antipodes of Wagner\"]. His 1931 book on Wagner came out with a supplement on Nietzsche and Wagner, for which Bernhard Hoffers asserted that many of Drews' views later borrowed by the standard scholarship on Wagner without giving him credit.\n\nDrews delivered his last public critique of Nietzsche in his article \"Nietzsche als Philosoph des \"Nationalsozialismus\"?\" [\"Nietzsche, a philosopher of National Socialism?\"] in the journal \"Nordische Stimmen\" No. 4 (1934: 172–79). There Drews again attacked Nietzsche on philosophical grounds, in direct opposition to the Nazi effort to enlist Nietzsche in its propaganda, and unconcerned about potential consequences. Wolfang Müller-Lauter, in \"Experiences with Nietzsche\", quotes Drews: One finds in Nietzsche \"neither national sympathy nor social awareness\", [Drews claimed]. Nietzsche is, on the contrary, and particularly after his break with Richard Wagner, \"an enemy of everything German\"; he supports the creation of a “good European,” and goes so far as to \"accord the Jews a leading role in the dissolution of all nations.\" Finally, he is an \"individualist\", with no notion of “the National Socialist credo: ‘collective over individual utility’...After all this, it must seem unbelievable that Nietzsche has been honored as the Philosopher of National Socialism, … for he preaches in all things \"the opposite of National Socialism\"”, setting aside a few scattered utterances. The fact that such honors have repeatedly been bestowed on him has as its main reason, that most people who talk about Nietzsche tend only to \"pick the ‘raisins' from the cake of his philosophy\" and, because of his aphoristic style, \"lack any clear understanding of the way his entire thought coheres\". [emphasis added] \n\nDrews, unsatisfied by the abstract rationality of Kantian philosophy, was attracted to religion, but was put off by what he regarded as the spiritual dryness (geistige Dürre) of Christianity. Drews found his anchor in the monism of Eduard von Hartmann (1842–1906), professor of philosophy in Berlin. Hartmann had been strongly influenced by Schopenhauer and his pessimism and had embraced Darwinism and history. Hartmann published his work \"Philosophy of the Unconscious\", in 1869. The concept of the unconscious mind (\"das Unbewusstsein\") became the new form of the ultimate reality, the Absolute, or the Geist, or World Spirit of Hegel, combining pantheism with rational idealism (with the double attributes of will and reason). In his view the human mind is not separate from this unconscious reality, but exists as it approaches self-consciousness (\"Selbstbewusstsein\"), especially in the opinion of the philosophical community.\n\nDrews expanded his views in \"Die Religion als Selbst-bewusstsein Gottes: eine philosophische Untersuchung über das Wesen der Religion\", (Religion as Self-Consciousness of God: A philosophical inquiry in the Essence of Religion, 1906). The text expressed that religions are conscious expressions of the unconscious, and philosophy and religion can finally be united. The absolute Spirit was not another separate entity, and Hartmann and Drews rejected the idea of any personal God and mind-matter dualism.\n\nIn \"Christ Myth II\", Drews specified his motivation: \"The chief danger that has come to our time, especially to religion, \"under the influence of science\" is \"the denial of objective purpose in the universe\". Let men be taught to believe again in ideas, and then monism, in its idealistic form, will become the first principle of all deep religious life.\" [emphasis added] Drews goes on to proclaim a need for the \"religion of the future\" to be a \"concrete\" monism. The advocacy of this system of monism became Drews's life program and the subject of his philosophical and religious writings. It was also the motivation for his social activism in the Free Religion Movement, which had been sprouting cultural associations (\"Kulturbünde\") in Germany, especially in the search for a new religion anchored in European and, more specifically, German culture. Both Hartmann and Drews shared an infatuation with history, and the belief in the direction of history, transmuted into a philosophical axiom by Hegel, was applied to the history of religion and mythology.\n\nDrews derived additional key ideas from Albert Kalthoff (1850–1906). Kalthoff was an active minister who managed to marry three times in his short life, and revived Bruno Bauer's Christ Myth thesis in his \"Das Christus-Problem. Grundlinien zu einer Sozialtheologie\" (\"The Problem of Christ: Principles of a Social Theology\", 1902) and \"Die Entstehung des Christentums, Neue Beiträge zum Christusproblem\" (\"The Rise of Christianity\", 1907). Kalthoff criticized what he regarded as the romanticist and sentimental image of Jesus as a \"great personality\" of history developed by German liberal theologians (including Albert Schweitzer). In Kalthoff's views, it was the early church that created the New Testament, not the reverse; the early Jesus movement was socialist, expecting a social reform and a better world, which fused with the Jewish apocalyptic belief in a Messiah. Kalthoff saw Christianity as a social psychosis. Drews accepted Kalthoff's ideas, but insisted that the original Christian socialism was religious, not economic.\n\nDrews did become an acerbic critic of what he called the \"faulty historical method\" of academic liberal theologians. His primary critique of Judaism and Christianity was that they were ancient, archaic myths from antiquity that had become obsolete, and \"their concepts [are] foreign to our mindsets in the modern scientific age\". He opposed the Romanticist cult of personality applied to Jesus in what he referred to as the Christ myth. He rejected the attempt of liberal theologians like Albert Schweitzer to idolize a historical Jesus as a unique personality, which he asserted was the result of The Great Man Theory subjected to modern manipulations by scholars of the Historical Theology school. This view had been already advanced by Schweitzer himself in his review of historical criticism in Germany with his book \"The Quest of the Historical Jesus\" (1906).\n\nIn \"Die Religion als Selbst-bewusstsein Gottes : eine philosophische Untersuchung über das Wesen der Religion\" (\"Religion as Self-Consciousness of God: a Philosophical Inquiry in the Essence of Religion\", 1906), Drews saw the phenomenon of religion through his philosophical approach as the self-consciousness of God through the mind of mankind. \"Godmen\" were to be replaced by \"God-mankind\", an adaptation of Georg Friedrich Hegel's \"World-Spirit\".\n\nIn \"The Strong Personality\", Ch. 12 of \"The Witness of the Gospels\", Part IV of \"Christ Myth II\", Drews argues that the force of personality of ahuman Jesus cannot be at the source of Christendom's spread: [First, quoting Dupuis] Each man fights for his own chimera, not for history...in matters of religion \"the belief of many generations proves nothing but their own credulity\"... \"A great error is propagated more easily than a great truth\", because it is \"easier to believe than to reflect\", and men \"prefer the wonders of romance\" to the plain facts of history... we might urge against Christians that the faith of any people in the miracles and oracles of its religion proved its truth; I doubt if they would admit the argument, and we will do the same with theirs. I know that they will say that they alone have the truth; but the other people say the same. [The Christ cult replaced the Mithras cult for reasons other than the force of personality]...the Persian Mithra was a very shadowy form beside Jesus, who \"came nearer to the heart\", especially of \"women, invalids, and the weak\", in his human features and on account of the \"touching description of his death\". But that shows at the most that the \"more concrete idea\" has the better prospect of triumphing in a spiritual struggle than \"the more abstract\"; it proves nothing as regards the historical reality of the idea. Moreover, history teaches us that it was quite different causes—partly external and \"accidental causes\" of a political nature, such as the \"death in the Persian war of the Emperor Julian\", one of the most zealous followers of Mithra—that gave Christianity the victory over Mithraism. [emphasis added]\n\nHe had been outspoken in presenting his views on religion with extreme clarity in \"Idea and Personality: Settlement of the Religious Crisis\", Ch. 14 of \"The Witness of the Gospels\", and Part IV of \"Christ Myth II\". Drews asserted that mankind cannot let the present be still shackled by what he called \"past superstitions of ancient times\". He outlined what he called the religion of the future, which he said must acknowledge the World-Spirit (geist) proclaimed by Hegel as God-mankind, which is God manifesting himself through history with human actors and oracles who are merely major agents. The cult of \"great personalities\" he dismissed as an illusion; individuals could no longer be seen as \"godmen\", just as revealers and oracles of the divinity.\n\n\"The purely historical conception of Jesus cannot satisfy the religious consciousness of our age. [It is] obsolete\". [Humanity] has not merely broken with the geocentric and anthropocentric view of the origin of Christianity, but has seen through the superstitious nature of ecclesiastical Christology. Modern humanity has, therefore, the task of again universalising the idea of divine redemption, or enlarging the idea of a god-\"man\"...to the idea of a \"god-\"humanity\"...\n\n[It] returns in a certain sense to pre-Christian religion and its numerous “god-men,”... filled with the idea of the one reality and its spiritual nature, to which the various individuals are related only as \"modi\", phenomena, or'revelations, confiding in the divine control of the world, and therefore in its rationality and goodness...Thus man secures a faith in himself, in the divine nature of his being, in the rationality of existence; thus he is placed in a position to save himself, without a mediator, simply on account of his own divine nature... The religion of the future will either be a belief in the divine nature of the self, or will be nothing... no Christ is needed for it, and there is no ground for concern that religion may perish with the denial of the historicity of Jesus...\n[The belief in Christ\"] is not only superfluous, but mischievous. It loads the religious consciousness with doubtful historical ballast; it grants the past an authority over the religious life of the present, and it prevents men from deducing the real consequences of their Monistic religious principles. Hence I insist that the belief in the historical reality of Jesus is the chief obstacle to religious progress...\n\n[No need to appeal to Hegel] to whom this high appreciation of the present above history may be traced, as well as this vindication of “personalities of world-history.” The great personality has clearly a value even in our own view: in it the unity of God and man, the God-mankind, attains a clearer expression. It serves as proof to the religious consciousness that God raises up the right man at the right time. It reveals the living connection of the common individual life with the universal spiritual life. The divinity lives in history, and reveals itself therein. History is, in union with nature, the sole place of divine activity... one continuous stream of divine activity flows through time... To bind up religion with history, as modern theologians do, and to represent an historical religion as the need of modern man, is no proof of insight, but of a determination... to recognise the Christian religion alone.\n\nDrews believed that religion was intimately linked to the prevalent beliefs of the social group and not just the expression of individual beliefs and faith. He reflected on the history of the great faiths of the world, the European history of the 19th century, and nationalism. His own mysticism, as a modern form of monism, glamorized the German idealism of the great German thinkers and poets as the superior form of future religion for mankind. It also was related to Spinoza's pantheism, which also rejected Judaism and Christianity as ancient superstition no longer valid for the rationalism of our modern times.\n\nDrews was especially drawn to Plotinus, who founded Neoplatonism 600 years after the time of Plato. A year later, Drews edited \"Der Monismus: dargestellt in Beiträgen seiner Vertreter\", where he analyzes the major philosophers of monism. In 1913, he published \"History of Monism in Antiquity\" (1912) throughout the various schools of hellenistic philosophy.\n\nDrews thus managed to produce a modern system of philosophy joining the ancient idealism and monism of Plotinus's Neoplatonism and the modern historical idealism of Hegel, for whom the World-Spirit manifests itself in History. Towards the end of his life, Drews started writing more explicitly on what the idea of a monist God means in the context of modern Germany in the 1930s. \"God\" (1930) and \"The Word of God\" (1933) demonstrated his trend towards a German-inspired form of religion.\n\nDrews was intrigued by the alleged influence of ancient astronomy on the origins of religion, developed by the French Volney and Dupuis and promoted throughout the 19th century. He included modern considerations on astromythical topics in some pages of his major books. The \"Appendix\" to his 1912 book \"The Witnesses to the Historicity of Jesus\" was an essay on the astral speculations of the Ancients in relation to Psalm 22. Hoffers notes that, in the 1921 book on \"The Gospel of Mark as a Witness against the Historicity of Jesus\", Drews demonstrates \"how Mark reflects an astromythical triple journey along the zodiac\". In 1923 Drews published a general introduction into astral mythology, \"Der sternhimmel in der Dichtung und Religion der Alten Völker und des Christentums, eine Einführung in die Astralmythologie\" (\"The Celestial Sky in the Poetry and Religion of the Ancients and Christianity: an Introduction to Astral Mythology\"), and its special influence on early Christianity. His interest remained a professional expression of curiosity and admitted speculations on relations detected by intuition and finesse, and never replaced rigorous text and historical criticism.\n\nDrews also wrote a few more books on various aspects of Christianity where he systematically analyzes what he regarded as the mythical nature of the personages involved with Jesus Christ. Klaus Schilling wrote in his \"English summary\" to \"The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus in Past and Present\": Drews was involved too deep into the subject to stop there, and went boldly further, exploring how Christianity could \"become a world religion without a historical founder\" or core group described in scripture... During the [First World] war, Schweitzer published more essays in a weak attempt to justify theology, which strengthened Drews' attitude and endeavor. [emphasis added]\n\nIn \"The Legend of Peter\" (1910, translated into English in 1997 by Frank Zindler), Drews complains that \"the confusion in educated circles...is so great and the posture of Rome so impudent\", and exposes the completely legendary character of the figure of Peter, both in the Gospels and the fantastical history of Peter in Rome. According to Drews (in Klaus Schilling's \"English Summary\" of \"The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus\"): The Gospel is a poetic retelling of the astral mythical journey of the sun god, dressed in Tanakh pictures... The order of the tales follows almost strictly the astral mythical cycle. Mark's gospel is of astral magical, \"Gnostic origin from the middle of the second century\"... Drews had published an introduction to astral mythology in the cultures of the Mediterranean and Iranian region up to imperial times, in order to decrease the above ignorance. But theologians continued to indulge in their self-induced ignorance. [emphasis added]\n\nIn his 1924 book \"The Origin of Christianity in Gnosticism\", Drews developed the hypothesis of the \"derivation of Christianity from a gnosticism environment\". In Drews's own words (in Klaus Schilling's \"English Summary\" of \"The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus\"): \"Gnosticism is undeniably pre-Christian\", with both Jewish and gentile roots. The wisdom of Solomon already contained Gnostic elements and prototypes for the Jesus of the Gospels...God stops being the Lord of righteous deed and becomes the Good One...A clear pre-Christian Gnosticism can be distilled from the epistles of Paul. \"Paul is recklessly misunderstood by those who try to read anything Historical Jesus-ish into it\". The conversion of Paul in the Acts of the Apostles is a \"mere forgery from various Tanakh passages.\".. [The epistles] are from Christian mystics of the middle of the second century. \"Paul is thus the strongest witness against the Historical Jesus\" hypothesis...John's Gnostic origin is more evident than that of the synoptics. Its acceptance proves that even the Church wasn't concerned with historical facts at all. [emphasis added]\n\nIn \"The Myth of Mary\" (1928), which reads as \"Jesus's Family and Entourage Exposed\", Drews asserted that all the characters around Jesus were as imaginary and fantastic as Jesus himself.\n\nOne consequence of the success of the German school of historical criticism had been to instill an overt skepticism towards the Christian religion among the German population. A search for a German, non-Christian religion dated to pre-World War I times. Arthur Drews himself was a product of this emerging opposition to Christianity, expressed in his lifelong concern about the state of the Christian churches. After World War I, Germany became \"radicalized\", the skepticism towards the two established Christian churches and the search for a new kind of worship attuned to the national culture became a latent national preoccupation, as alluded to by Leonard Foster in his 1938 article on \"The New Paganism and the Old Teutonic Religion\". One of Drews's concerns was about restoring the authenticity of religion in mankind. Both William Benjamin Smith and Arthur Drews denied the historicity of Jesus Christ, but, unlike most exponents of the myth thesis, they were dedicated theists who thought that by purging religion of all its legendary accretions, they were providing an important cleanup service and equipping it with the tools to efficiently withstand the onslaught of modern materialism.\n\nDrews felt an urgent need to reform the structure of established religion, free it from its attachment to the primitive features of the early mythical Christianity. In \"Christ Myth II\" he glorifies the greatness of the German mind and complains: \"How, then, can we be asked to admit that the salvation of modern times depends on a belief that has, in the Churches, degenerated into a stupid superstition?...Why, then, should we be compelled to take our religious possessions from the past? ...Are the ideas of a remote age and a degenerate culture to keep us under their power for ever?\" Drews's books were released during a phase of profound turmoil in Germany and a restructuring of its religious scene. Repeatedly, Drews came back to the same theme of reform and started thinking about the nature of religion in the future.\n\nDrews was one of those scholars and intellectuals who were not averse to bringing their ideas to the public, especially, in his case, if it was for the cause of countering the influence of Christian churches. He was a religious activist, willing to descend into the public forum, stand up for his views, and harangue the crowds. The concern about a renewal of religion had been Drews's preoccupation all his life, along with many other Germans. Germany was going through a craze of forming all kinds of associations for matters of public concern, including religion. Alongside the established churches, Germany had seen a few important movements emerge with a liberated attitude towards religion. In 1859 the German Association of Free Religion Societies (\"Bund Freireligiöser Gemeinden Deutschlands\") was founded. This was followed in 1881 by the \"German Association of Freethinkers\" (\"Deutscher \"), and in 1906 the \"German Association of Monists\" ().\n\nDrews threw in his lot with both the Free Religion Association and the Monist Association, which were part of the Free Religion Movement (). In addition, Drews was a member of the new No-Confession Committee (\"Komitee Konfessionslos\"), formed in 1909, becoming president in 1912. The Komitee supported the Church Exist Movement [\"Kirchenaustrittsbewegung\"], which became very successful since its inception in 1905 for attracting lapsed members of other churches as well as scientists, academic personalities, and cultural celebrities. In 1924 Drews, who was the leader of the \"Free Religion Society of Karlsruhe\", joined a few other Societies of the Southwest to form a new Association of Free Religion for the Southwest(\"Verband Freireligiöser Gemeinden Süd- und Westdeutschlands\"), with a more religious and less political orientation than the other movements.\n\nIn opposition to the religious movements, a non-religious cultural current had gained some impetus: the so-called \"\" (Völkish movement), which dated back to the Romanticist movement of the 1850s, when the German revolutionary drives had been crushed by the arrival of Bismarck. is a well-known historian of this movement. This movement had a popular base and combined various elements: extreme nationalism, anti-Christianity, a reverence for the mythical Teutonic past, racism, anti-semitism, and a revival of Germanic paganism.\nThis trend is described in the books by & Uwe Puschner, \"Antisemitismus, Paganismus, Völkische Religion\" (\"Anti-semitism, Paganism, and Völkish Religion\", 2004), and by , \"Die Völkischen in Deutschland\" (\"The Popular Societies in Germany,\" 2008). Although the Völkish Movement was different in ideology from National Socialism, Uwe Puschner has stressed that the two movements had great similarities and that the Völkish significantly contributed to the eventual success of the Nazi Party.\n\nDrews had been a philosopher and an historian of philosophy, with a proselytizing drive for promoting his brand of idealistic monism. His interest in religion and mythology made him sensitive to the religious \"essence\" of social cultural beliefs. Romantic Nordic mysticism had become a prevalent fascination among the 19th-century German elite, such as Richard Wagner and contemporary artists, historians, and writers. It had unavoidably aroused Drews' attention for the old Teutonic beliefs that were much in vogue in Northern Europe.\n\nDrews had seen in early Christianity a religion of promise of rebirth and transfiguration for a defeated and oppressed country (announcing the coming of the Kingdom of God), and the creation of a national myth giving hope to ancient occupied Palestinian Jews (an expectation of a messianic leader and liberator). Jews were expecting that Palestine was going to go through its own course of death and rebirth.\n\nDuring its rise in Germany, the Nazi Party included in its ideology the old Teutonic mysticism of the highly educated artistic and literary elite, and its propaganda vulgarized it into a crude, popular mass mythology of Germanic Aryan superiority with quasi-religious overtones, encouraging the fringe development of what came to be called Germanic neopaganism. Aging and close to death, Drews was struck by the theoretical parallel of early Christianity with modern National Socialist mysticism, a promise of national rebirth and transfiguration from an oppressed state and ofrenewed hope for a defeated country under the leadership of a new charismatic liberator, which resonated with his own concept of a future religion based on German monist idealism.\n\nWith the National Socialist Party's propaganda overwhelming the country, Drews's language in his last theological writings became increasingly focused on the concepts of glorified Germanness by opposition to the people of the Ancient Near East, whose cultures had given rise to Greco-Roman classicism (including Drews' beloved Plotinus), but also Christianity — now all devalued and labeled as foreign races. Drews thus seemed convinced that the unconscious World Spirit had moved from the Mediterranean to Germany, and the philosopher had to go along.\n\nFeeling in touch with the new cultural spirit of national rebirth and exalted hope in the future then prevailing in Germany, Drews started evangelizing on the theme of German nationalism, using it as another argument against Christianity. Thus, he wrote in \"Das Wort Gottes\" (\"The Word of God\", 1933, p. 11): [Free Religion believers] are “German and not Romans…[and must reject] a determination of our faith on the Bible and its knowledge...Christendom is the expression of sunken times and of \"the mindset of a race foreign to us\"…\"Christendom has absolutely nothing to do with Germanness\" [Deutschtum]...and a German Christendom [would be] \"nonsense\" ... [As for Protestantism] with the blows it delivers on the Gospels, it is straight on its way to Rome... Jesus the Aryan [is] \"a pure ideal\". [There is] no reason [to assume] a Nordic origin of Jesus. [But the question of the origin of Jesus is secondary for Drews]...[Contrary to] believers in the Bible for whom Palestine is the 'Holy Land', for devotees of Free Religion, \"Germany is the Holy Land\". [The German is], as an Aryan, fundamentally Monist, (Pantheist), [contrary to dualist Christians. Free Religion is] the manifestation of the essence [\"Wesensausdruck\"] of our German people. [emphasis added]\n\nDrews systematically used monism in his battle against Christianity. Drews concluded that free religion was \"the very expression of the being of our German people\". Using the accoutrements of the rampant nationalistic fervor for his own agenda, Drews was still upholding his lofty ideals, but now in the form of a German monist idealism.\n\nNikolai Berdyaev (1874–1948) was a Russian philosopher of religion and politics. Writing in 1927 as a refugee from the Bolsheviks in a Paris threatened by Germany, he contends that Drews, as a religious anti-Semite, argues against the historical existence of Jesus for the religious life of Aryanism.\nDrews -- is a philosopher of the Hartmann school. In his capacity as an Hartmannist, he preaches a \"religion of pure spirit\". And he fights against the historicity of Jesus Christ in the name of a religion of spirit, he contends \"against the religious materialism\" which he detests. He is prepared to admit the existence of Christ, as the Logos. But for him \"the Logos never could have been incarnated into a man\" upon the earth, within earthly history. The \"religious materialism of Christianity is a legacy inherited from Judaism\", it is a Semitic graft, and Drews in his capacity \"as a religious anti-Semite\", struggles against this materialistic Semitic graft \"for the religious life of Aryanism\", expressing itself in its purest guise in India. Drews, just like E. Hartmann, is a resolute \"antagonist against Protestantism\" and the religion of Jesus. For him Jesus was not real, in the metaphysical sense that Christ is real. He is the \"antipode to Harnack\", a result of the splitting apart of the God-Man -- the polar opposite to the Jesusism of the Protestants. (With the Christian Myth was connected the teaching of Drews and E. Hartmann about the unconscious Divinity, which in a fit of madness created the vale of being and \"comes to consciousness through man\". cf. Drews, \"Die Religion als Selbstbewustsein Gottes\".) [emphasis added]\nDrews was opposed to the theology of ancient Hebraism as much as he is \"opposed to Christianity\", and even more opposed to liberal Protestantism. This cannot be construed as a claim that Drews was a social anti-semite, as he was firmly opposed to social anti-semitism.\n\nDrews shared the intense belief with the German elite of the sublimity of German consciousness (in art, literature, philosophy, and science), again re-iterated in his book \"Das Wort Gottes\". However, he saw religion as an expression of the unconscious World-Spirit anchored in a community tightly rooted on an ancestral territory. In the late 1920s and '30s, hoping to see Germany pull away from Christianity, his writings took on an even stronger German nationalist fervor left in the wake of the Nazis.\n\nA thorough description of this religious movement was presented by Ulrich Nanko in his 1993 book on the movement. Many adventurers were trying to ride the coattails of the Nazi success to establish new spiritual/religious movements. Among them were the founders of the new German Faith Movement (\"Deutsche Glaubensbewegung\"), founded by Jakob W. Hauer (1881–1962), and Ernst Graf zu Reventlow (1869–1943). Hauer had been a Protestant missionary in India, who had turned into a Sanskrit scholar imbued with the spirituality of Hinduism and a professor at the University of Tübingen. His friend Ernst Graf zu Reventlow had been a navy officer, a journalist, and a Reichstag deputy who had joined the NSDAP in 1927. He was an influential Nazi party member, but one who never gained the trust of Hitler and never received a position from the Nazi government. The movement adopted as its official emblem the “Sun Cross”, an image of the sun forming a rounded shape with the Nazi swastika.\n\nHauer had started a religious movement that he wanted to expand with a larger group from the Völkish movement. Reventlow's cultural (but not racial) antisemitism led him to accept an alliance with Hauer in organizing a conference in July 1933 that would create another entity, the German Faith Movement. This new religious group became active in 1934. Hauer's ambition was to use Reventlow's NSDAP connections to engineer a unification of the Free Religion movement with the Völkish movement. As the movement developed, its objectives were revealed as follows: A state religion, anti-Christian with a Hinduism coloration, veneration of the sun, and pursuing a \"species-true faith\" for Germany, (a goal that resonated with Drews' hopes to see the emergence of a German religion). Also included were \"Blood and Soil\" (\"Blut und Boden\"), racist values (blood descent), nationalism (ancestral land occupation), Völkish populism (fusion with the racist/antisemitic Völkish movement), and German neopaganism.\n\nThe Southwest Association for Free Religion, including Drews' Karlsruhe Society, had formed and Drews was invited to sit on the Working Committee of this new movement. The collaboration was short-lived, however. The new group's political objectives (dreams of becoming a state religion) clashed with the basic program of the Free Religion Societies, which were pursuing more limited interests of freer religion. In addition, racism and antisemitism, which had become more overt in the NSDAP's national policy after it had reached political power, became also quickly apparent as a major goal of Hauer and Reventlow. As a result, the Southwest Association of Free Religion, in which Drews' Karlsruhe Free Religion Society was a member, soon withdrew from the German Faith Movement.\n\nThe two leaders of the new group proved that they didn't have enough political pull. Hauer could not implement the planned fusion with the Völkish movement. Reventlow's connections did not bring any benefits from the Nazi government. Contrary to their hopes, the German Faith movement never became endorsed as a Nazi party organization, never obtained the privileges Hauer was seeking, and never achieved its latent goal of becoming legitimized as the state religion by the NSDAP, in a vain hope to duplicate the endorsement of the Catholic Church by the Roman Emperor Theodosius in 380 AD. Disillusioned, Hauer left in 1936, and joined the Party in 1937; Reventlow also left the movement early to resume the practice of Christianity and was still unable to gain Hitler's favor.\n\nThe anthropologist Karla Poewe has devoted her book \"New Religions and the Nazis\" (2005) to Hauer's attempt at founding a national religion. Richard Steigmann-Gall, author of \"The Holy Reich: Nazi Conceptions of Christianity, 1919-1945\" (2004), is another expert on this period. He contends that Poewe, sharing \"Hauer's sense of grandiosity\", portrays Hauer as more significant than he was, making of \"Hauer a 'truer' exemplar of Nazism than its own institutional incarnation\". Whereas Hauer was at most a fellow traveler of the Nazis, a hanger-on with big ambition, \"intent to appear relevant but ultimately rejected...\" The movement never achieved more than the status of a small esoteric fringe group. It never managed to dent, let alone replace, Christianity in the land of Martin Luther. It turned out to be merely a cultural flash-in-the-pan, a curiosity in the complex landscape of Germany's religious life in the mid '30s. The NSDAP government changed its name in 1938 and jettisoned it as a nuisance that was incapable of displacing the two strong Christian churches in Germany, and only risked to alienate them against the new regime.\n\nSo, in spite of Drews' hope to promote a new religion based on idealistic monism and pantheism of a distinct German character, the participation of the Karlsruhe Free Religion Society in Hauer's effort to unify the provincial Free Religion associations with the Völkish movement was short-lived and produced no results. Drews, an elitist thinker in the Hegel and Hartmann tradition, had been an advocate of the unconscious World Spirit as being the fundamental engine of religion acting in history through agents and oracles. He remained hostile to any religion based on a historic personality cult and, late in life, was confronted with the practical difficulty of translating his lofty ambitions to the simpler drives and requirements of a mass movement.\n\nDrews had been all his life opposed to any cult of a historical personality. It was one of his major criticisms of Christianity. The unconscious World-Spirit was larger than any individual — as he felt that great personalities were not godly, but simply its agents and expressions. Similarly, no modern form of religion could be based on the cult of a contemporary leader, even though it was the tendency of the NSDAP ideology. But the NSDAP never went all the way, and didn't try to impose a new religion to displace Christianity, which was still a strong force in Germany and which had been partly accepted by the new Nazi leadership. The NSDAP quickly got rid of the German Faith Movement, which had proven to be an unnecessary nuisance.\n\nAll his life, in most of his books, Drews had been concerned by the obsolete survival of Christianity, foreseeing its eventual disappearance, and insisting on the urgent need to define and implement the religion of the future. Drews's book, \"Deutsche Religion: Grundzüge eines Gottesglaubens im Geiste des deutschen Idealismus\" (\"German religion: Principles of a Belief in God in the Spirit of German Idealism\"), was published in 1935, the year of his death, and would be his final message as he died the same year at 70. In it, he tried to adjust his lifelong beliefs in idealistic monism to the perspective of the new social situation in Germany. The philosopher's conscience had to move with the flow of the Unconscious World Spirit.\n\nDrews's book is included in a catalogue of Nazi Collection Research Resources at the Ball State University library. The citation for the book describes it as a \"Work on the 'new' German religion that mixes faith and Nazi mysticism.\" This description, likely entered by the collector, painted Drews's book with the Nazi ideology brush and reflects a popular misconception that is not scholarly justified and does not reflect the 1935 German text. For Drews, \"faith\" meant faith in the unconscious World-Spirit, which for him is the divine manifested in history through human consciousness; and Nazi mysticism, if based on the cult of a personality, mythical or historical — be it Zeus, Mithras, Jesus Christ, Napoleon, or \"Der Führer\" — was the primary kind of mysticism that Drews always dismissed as a caricature of religion.\n\nWhat Drews had endeavored to do was to stress the potential development of his own idealistic kind of monist religion in the form of Free Religion with a nationalistic German character. He had never become a Nazi Party activist. His very brief involvement, before his death in 1935, with the aborted attempt of the Southwest Association for Free Religion to join the brand-new venture called the German Faith Movement, was misinterpreted as his \"having lent his support to the early attempts to unite the various German pagan organizations into a unified body\", a description that tended to make Drews wrongly appear as a promoter of old Teutonic values and neopaganism, in complete opposition to his lifelong beliefs in idealism and monism.\n\nCritics of Drews like to present a much simplified and distorted version of events of his last two years, unable or unwilling to understand his motivations and ambitions. They forget to mention that Drews and his Free Religion colleagues abandoned the German Faith Movement anddissociated themselves from Hauer and Reventlow as soon as it became clear that the two leaders' ambition was much more political than religious. Drews was not interested in old mythical values. He put his last ounces of energy, just before his death, into writing a theoretical treatise to repeat his old message, urging a renewal of religion in the future, this time with a more pronounced German character, but still anchored on the German Idealism that he had been promoting ever since his youthful infatuation with Eduard von Hartmann.\n\nAmong the many reservations about the German Faith Movement, one reason for abandoning it was what Drews and others perceived as blatant antisemitism. Drews objected to the racist assumption in antisemitism in an article, Jesus the Aryan (\"Jesus der Arier,\" 1934) where he paid homage to the courage and moral fiber of the Jews through history and to the ancient Hebrew prophets who transformed the primitive god of wrath into a god of mercy in the \"Psalms\", \"Proverbs\", and \"Wisdom\" books:\n\nContrary to other Free Religion devotees who parroted the slogans of the NSDAP propaganda, Drews engaged in a real discussion with Jewish intellectuals and scholars. He was able to deliver a tribute to the Jewish faith, which, on one hand, brought to light its differences with Free Religion, but also showed respect to people who had other thoughts.\n\nDrews died on 19 July 1935 in Illenau, Achern (near Bühl), Baden at the age of 70.\n\nGermany has been struggling with the legacy of the Nazi era and is still in the process of rehabilitating its exceptional scholars. Bernhardt Hoffers, in his 2003 biographical eulogy, took up the challenge of restoring Drews's reputation that he felt had been unfairly tarnished. He stressed the following facts: He highlighted that Drews, during his life, had been an irritant, continually encroaching on the turf of many specialists in German universities: in theology, philology, astronomy, mythology, music criticism, and psychology. Specialists didn't welcome his interference and even resented him as an outsider. Drews had been regarded as a maverick; his philosophy stood outside of academia, which didn't accept his dilettantism (\"Abweichungen von der communis opinio\"). Hartmann was not in vogue, either, and Drews' dependence on this old professor was another hindrance. Drews created no school and had no followers in Germany. He had to remain a teacher in his Technische Hochschule in Karlsruhe for the rest of his life.\n\nDrews' support of Wagner and opposition to Nietzsche did nothing to improve his standing. He met with the studied indifference [\"das Ignorieren\"] and the silence [\"das Totschweigen\"] of the academic pundits, while his international public popularity and press coverage were increasing. Even the University of Karlsruhe, in the very town where he lived and taught, didn't want to mention his name. His treatment at the hands of academics was similar to those of William B. Smith in the US, John M. Robertson and later George A. Wells in England, and Paul-Louis Couchoud in France.\n\nAfter his death his name was largely forgotten. He was mentioned in the German media mostly for having advocated the need for a religion renewal, and in the literature about Wagner and Nietzsche. His work was omitted or grossly misrepresented and discredited in major German reference books. His books in Germany are now hard to find. However, his book on Plotinus is still in demand, the \"Christ Myth\" is widely available in the English-speaking world, and Hermann Detering of \"Radikalkritik\" continues to make the \"Denial of the Historicity of Jesus\" still available..\n\nDrews had been fighting all his life for acceptance and recognition in Germany and for tenure at a university. In spite of his enormous scholarly output, and his popularity, he never was able to obtain a university position. One has to understand why, at the end of his life, Drews was expressing a hope for a renewal of Germany. Hoffers, for the sake of fairness, remarked that Drews never was a member of the Nazi party, and spoke out early against growing antisemitism in the 1920s . He never was involved in any action against Jewish intellectuals, artists, and academics. Whereas, for instance, a philosopher like Heidegger was more visibly active in the Nazi movement, as Rüdiger Safranski has described in detail in \"Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil\" (1999).\n\nHoffers emphasized that \"As a scholar, Drews had always been objective and honest’‘.\" In spite of scholarly differences, he maintained a friendship with Schweitzer for a while. He was a polyglot and collected Japanese art prints. He was a gifted, energetic man, with a tremendous capacity for work. He gained the esteem of van den Bergh van Eysinga, the leader of the Dutch Radical school, who viewed him as a\" good guy\" (\"ein netter Kerl\").\n\nIn conclusion, Hoffers urged scholars to renew an acquaintance with Drews' books. Claiming that the arguments developed in his work were outmoded or refuted [\"überholt\"] is unjustified. As a parting shot, Hoffers asks a pertinent question: \"Is it really true that the question of Jesus's historicity has been absolutely clarified and is moreover uninteresting, as can be heard in discussions with theologians? (\"Ist es wirklich so, dass die Frage nach der Historizität Jesu absolut geklärt und obendrein noch so nebensächlich ist, wie man in Gesprächen mit Theologen zu hören bekommt?\").\" Hoffers concludes that Drews's life was a fascinating chapter of the \"zeitgeschichte\" (history of our times).\n\n\n"}

It is the most religious Buddhist country in terms of the proportion of monks in the population and proportion of income spent on religion. Adherents are most likely found among the dominant Bamar people, Shan, Rakhine, Mon, Karen, Zo, and Chinese who are well integrated into Burmese society. Monks, collectively known as the sangha, are venerated members of Burmese society. Among many ethnic groups in Myanmar, including the Bamar and Shan, Theravada Buddhism is practised in conjunction with nat worship, which involves the placation of spirits who can intercede in worldly affairs.\n\nWith regard to the daily routines of Buddhists in Myanmar, there are two most popular practices: merit-making and vipassanā. The weizza path is the least popular; it is an esoteric form somewhat linked to Buddhist aspiration that involves the occult. Merit-making is the most common path undertaken by Burmese Buddhists. This path involves the observance of the Five Precepts and accumulation of good merit through charity and good deeds (dana) to obtain a favourable rebirth. The vipassana path, which has gained ground since the early 1900s, is a form of insight meditation believed to lead to enlightenment. The weizza path is an esoteric system of occult practices (such as recitation of spells, samatha and alchemy) believed to lead to life as a \"weizza\" (also spelt \"weikza\"), a semi-immortal and supernatural being who awaits the appearance of the future Buddha, Maitreya (Arimeitaya).\n\nBuddhism is practiced by approximately 90% of the country. According to Burmese census data dating back to 1891, between 84% to 90% of the population have practiced Buddhism.\n\nThe history of Buddhism in Myanmar probably extends more than two thousand years. The \"Sāsana Vaṃsa\" (Burmese \"Thathana Win\"), written by Pinyasami in 1834, summarises much of the history of Buddhism in Myanmar. According to the \"Mahavamsa\", a Pali chronicle of fifth century Sri Lanka, Ashoka sent two bhikkhus, Sona and Uttara, to Suvarnabhumi around 228 BC with other monks and sacred texts, including books.\n\nAn Andhra Ikshvaku inscription from about the 3rd century refers to the conversion of the Kiratas to Buddhism, who are thought to have been Tibeto-Burman-speaking peoples of Myanmar. Early Chinese texts of about the same date speak of a \"Kingdom of Liu-Yang,\" where all people worshiped the Buddha and there were several thousand samaṇas. This kingdom has been identified with a region somewhere in central Burma. A series of epigraphic records in Pali, Sanskrit, Pyu and Mon datable to the 6th and 7th centuries, has been recovered from Central and Lower Burma (Pyay and Yangon). From the 11th to 13th centuries, the Bamar kings and queens of the Pagan Kingdom built countless stupas and temples.\n\nThe Ari Buddhism era included the worship of bodhisattvas and nāgas.\n\nTheravada Buddhism was implanted at Bagan for the first time as early as the 11th century by the Bamar king Anawrahta (1044-1077). In year 1057, Anawratha sent an army to conquer the Mon city of Thaton to obtain the\"Tipiṭāka\" of the Pāli Canon. He was converted by a Mon bhikkhu, Shin Arahan, to Theravada Buddhism. Shin Arahan's advice led to acquiring thirty sets of Pali scriptures from the Mon king Manuha by force. Mon culture, from that point, came to be largely assimilated into the Bamar culture based in Bagan.\n\nDespite attempts at reform, certain features of Ari Buddhism and traditional nat worship continued, such as reverence for the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara (\"Lawka nat\").\n\nSuccessive kings of Bagan continued to build large numbers of monuments, temples, and pagodas in honour of Buddhism, and there is inscriptional evidence of a Theravadin vihara for bhikkhunis from 1279.\n\nBurmese rule at Bagan continued until the first Mongol invasion of Burma in 1287. Towards the end of the 13th century, Buddhism declined due to the invading Tatars. In the 14th century, another lineage was imported from Sri Lanka to Ayutthaya, the capital of the Thai Ayutthaya Kingdom. A new ordination line, that of the Thai Forest Tradition, thus entered Myanmar.\n\nThe Shan, meanwhile, established themselves as rulers throughout the region now known as Myanmar. Thihathu, a Shan king, established rule in Bagan by patronising and building many monasteries and pagodas.\n\nThe Mon kingdoms, often ruled by Shan chieftains, fostered Theravada Buddhism in the 14th century. Wareru, who became king of Mottama, patronised Buddhism, and established a code of law, the \"Dhammasattha\", compiled by Buddhist monastics. King Dhammazedi, formerly a Mon bhikkhu, established rule in the late 15th century at Inwa and unified the sangha in Mon territories. He also standardised ordination of monks set out in the Kalyani Inscriptions. Dhammazedi moved the capital back to Hanthawaddy (Bago). His mother-in-law, Queen Shin Sawbu, was also a great patron of Buddhism. She is credited for expanding and gilding the Shwedagon Pagoda, giving her own weight in gold.\n\nThe Bamars, who had fled to Taungoo before the invading Shan, established a kingdom there under the reigns of Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung, who conquered and unified most of modern Myanmar. These monarchs also embraced Mon culture and patronised Theravada Buddhism.\n\nIn the reigns of succeeding kings, the Taungoo Dynasty became increasingly volatile and was overthrown by the Mon. In the mid-18th century, King Alaungpaya defeated the Mon, expanded the Bamar kingdoms, and established the Konbaung Dynasty. Under the rule of Bodawpaya, a son of Alaungpaya, a unified sect of monks (\"Thudhamma\") was created within the kingdom. Bodawpaya restored ties with Sri Lanka, allowing for mutual influence in religious affairs. During the reigns of the Konbaung kings that followed, both secular and religious literary works were created. King Mindon Min moved his capital to Mandalay.\n\nAfter Lower Burma had been conquered by the British, Christianity began to gain acceptance. Many monks from Lower Burma had resettled in Mandalay, but by decree of Mindon Min, they returned to serve the Buddhist laypeople. Schisms arose in the sangha; they were resolved during the Fifth Buddhist Synod, held in Mandalay in 1871.\n\nThe Fifth Council was convened at Mandalay in Myanmar on the first waning day of Tazaungmone, 1232 Myanmar Era, 2415 B.E (November 1871). The scriptures inscribed on palm-leaves could not last for a long time. Besides there might be many variations in rewriting the scriptures from copy to copy. Therefore, the scriptures were inscribed on marble slabs to dispel these disadvantages.\n\nTwo thousand and four hundred bhikkhus led by Venerable Jagarabhivamsa Thera (Tipitakadhara Mahadhammarajadhirajaguru) of Dakkhinarama Monastery, Mandalay, convened, to recite and approve the scriptures. King Mindon initiated and supported the Fifth Great Council to the end. The scriptures were first inscribed on seven hundred and twenty-nine marble slabs ) in the precinct of Lokamarajina Pagoda at the foot of Mandalay Hill. From 1860 to 1868, the Tipitaka was engraved on 729 marble slabs and assembled in the Kuthodaw Pagoda. It took seven years, six months and fourteen days to finish this work. Then the bhikkhus recited to approve the inscriptions for five months and three days. In 1871, a new \"hti\" (the gold umbrella that crowns a stupa) encrusted with jewels from the crown was also donated by Mindon Min for the Shwedagon now in British Burma. After the Fifth Great Council. the Pali Texts were translated into Myanmar language, and the Doctrinal Order was promulgated to the whole country for purpose of purification and propagation of the Buddha's Teachings.\nDuring the British administration of Lower and Upper Burma, also known as \"Burma Proper\", government policies were secular which meant monks were not protected by law. Nor was Buddhism patronised by the colonial government. This resulted in tensions between the colonised Buddhists and their European rulers. There was much opposition (including by the Irish monk U Dhammaloka) to the efforts by Christian missionaries to convert the Burmese people, Bamar, Shan, Mon, Rakhine and plains Karen, with one exception - the hill tribes. Today, Christianity is most commonly practised by the Kuki, Kachin, and the Kayin. Notwithstanding traditional avoidance of political activity, monks often participated in politics and in the struggle for independence.\n\nSince 1948 when the country gained its independence from Great Britain, both civil and military governments have supported Theravada Buddhism. The 1947 Constitution states, \"The State recognizes the special position of Buddhism as the faith professed by the great majority of the citizens of the Union.\" The Ministry of Religious Affairs, created in 1948, was responsible for administering Buddhist affairs in Myanmar. In 1954, the prime minister, U Nu, convened the Sixth Buddhist Synod at Kaba Aye Pagoda in Rangoon (Yangon), which was attended by 2,500 monks, and established the World Buddhist University.\n\nDuring the military rule of Ne Win (1962–1988), he attempted to reform Myanmar under the Burmese Way to Socialism which contained elements of Buddhism. In the 8888 Uprising, many monks participated and were killed by Tatmadaw soldiers. The succeeding military regime, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) patronised Buddhism, although persecution of Buddhists contrary to the regime, as well as persons of other religions, namely Islam and Christianity, continues.\n\nThe culture of Myanmar is deemed synonymous with its Buddhism. There are many Burmese festivals all through the year, most of them related to Buddhism. The Burmese New Year, \"Thingyan\", also known as the Water Festival, has its origins in Hinduism but it is also a time when many Burmese boys celebrate \"shinbyu\", a special rite of passage by which a boy enters the kyaung for a short time as a sāmaṇera.\n\nA Burmese Buddhist household contains an altar or shrine to the Buddha, with at least one dedicated image of the Gautama Buddha. The Buddha image is commonly placed on a \"throne\" called a \"gaw pallin\" (, from Pali \"pallanka\").\n\nBefore a Buddha statue is used for veneration at home, it must be formally consecrated, in a ritual called \"buddhābhiseka\" or \"anay gaza tin\" (). This consecration, led by a Buddhist monk, who recites \"aneka jāti saṃsāraṃ\" (translated as 'through the round of many births I roamed'), the 153rd verse of the Dhammapada (found in the 11th chapter).\n\nThe consecration rite, which can last a few hours, is held in the morning and consists of four primary parts:\n\nThe consecration rituals are believed to imbue the Buddha image with a sacred quality that can protect the home and surroundings from misfortune and symbolically embody the powers of the Buddha.\n\nIt is the most important duty of all Burmese parents to make sure their sons are admitted to the Buddhist \"Sangha\" by performing a shinbyu ceremony once they have reached the age of seven or older. A symbolic procession and ceremony of exchanging princely attire with that of an ascetic follows the example of Gautama Buddha. He was born a royal prince named Siddartha Gautama, but left his palace on horseback followed by his loyal attendant Chanda () after he found out that life is made up of suffering (dukkha) and the notion of self is merely an illusion (anatta) when one day he saw the \"Four Great Signs\" () - the old, the sick, the dead, and the ascetic - in the royal gardens.\n\nAll Buddhists are required to keep the basic Five Precepts (), and novices are expected to keep the Ten Precepts (). Parents expect them to stay at the kyaung immersed in the teachings of the Buddha as members of the Sangha for three months or longer. They will have another opportunity to join the Sangha at the age of 20, taking the upasampada ordination, to become a fully ordained bhikkhu, keeping the 227 precepts of the full monastic rules or Pātimokkha and perhaps remain a monk for life.\n\nThingyan usually falls in mid-April and tops the list of Public holidays in Myanmar. Vesak, the full moon in May, is the most sacred of all as the Buddha was born, became enlightened, and entered parinibbana (died) on the same day. It is celebrated by watering the Bodhi Tree.\n\nPagoda festivals ( \"Paya pwè\") held throughout the country also usually fall on full moon days and most of them will be on the full moon of Tabaung (February/March) including the Shwedagon Pagoda. They attract not only crowds of pilgrims from near and far, often in caravans of bullock carts, but they also double as great market fairs where both local and itinerant traders set up their stalls and shops among food stalls, restaurants, and free open-air stage performances as well as theatre halls.\n\nThe three monsoon months from mid-July to mid-October is Vassa (, ), a time when people are busy tilling their land and planting the rice paddies and bhikkhus remain in kyaungs. New robes are offered to bhikkhus at the beginning of Vassa, the end of which is marked by the Thadingyut Festival.\n\nAfter the harvest, robes are again offered at Kathina (), usually held during October or November. Uposatha days are observed by keeping the Eight Precepts by laypersons during Thingyan and Vassa and by devout Buddhists all the year round.\n\nParents and elders also receive obeisance from younger members of the family at the beginning as well as the end of lent, after the tradition established by the Buddha himself. It was during Vassa that he ascended to the Tāvatiṃsa Heaven to preach a sermon, as an act of gratitude, to his mother who had become a deva, and he was welcomed back to earth with a great festival of lights. Teachers receive the same obeisance, a tradition started by National Schools founded in defiance of the colonial administration and continued after independence by state schools.\n\nWedding ceremonies - nothing to do with religion and not conducted by the Sangha - are not held during the three months of Vassa, a custom which has resulted in a spate of weddings after Thadingyut or \"Wa-kyut\", awaited impatiently by couples wanting to tie the knot.\n\nTheravadins send their children to kyaungs to receive a Buddhist education, learning the Pāli Canon, the life story of Gautama Buddha, the 550 Jataka tales - most importantly the Ten Great Incarnations and the 38 Buddhist Beatitudes - as soon as they have a good grounding of the three Rs. Monks were the traditional teachers of the young and old alike until secular and missionary schools came into being during the British colonial administration.\n\nThere has been a revival of monastic schools since the 1990s with the deepening economic crisis. Children from poor families that can ill afford fees, uniforms and books have renewed the demand for a free monastic education, and minority groups such as the Shan, Pa'O, Palaung, Lahu and Wa are benefitting from this revival.\n\nBuddhist monks, who are venerated throughout Burmese society, are approximately 500,000 strong. Nuns form an additional 75,000. Monks belong to one of two primary monastic orders ( \"gaing\"): Thudhamma Nikaya (88% of Buddhist monks) and the more orthodox Shwegyin Nikaya (7% of Buddhist monks).\n\nBurmese monastic orders do not differ in doctrine but in monastic practice, lineage and organisation structure.\n\nOther minor monastic orders include the Dwara Nikaya in Lower Burma, and Hngettwin Nikaya in Mandalay, both of which have a few thousand member monks. There are nine legally recognised monastic orders in Burma today, under the 1990 Law Concerning Sangha Organizations. There are also esoteric Buddhist sects or weizza not recognised by any authority that incorporate non-Buddhist elements like alchemy, magic and occultism.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of Burmese monks wear maroon robes, while others wear ochre, unlike in neighbouring Theravada countries like Thailand, Laos and Sri Lanka, where monks commonly wear saffron robes.\n\nThe full bhikkhuni (nuns) lineage of Theravada Buddhism died out, and for various technical and social reasons was therefore permanently absent. The governing council of Buddhism in Myanmar has ruled that there can be no valid ordination of women in modern times, though some Burmese monks disagree. However, as in many other Theravadin countries, women have created a niche for themselves as renunciants not recognised by the state-empowered Sangharaja or even the Sangha in general. In Myanmar, these women are called thilashin. A thilashin (, , \"possessor of morality\", from Pali \"sīla\") is a female lay renunciant whose vows are the same as those of sāmaṇerīs \"novitiate nuns\". Like the maechi of neighbouring Thailand and the dasa sil mata of Sri Lanka, thilashin occupy a position somewhere between that of an ordinary lay follower and an ordained monastic. However, they are treated more favourably than most maechi, being able to receive training, practice meditation and sit for the same qualification examinations as the monks.\n\nThilashins observe the ten precepts and can be recognised by their pink robes, shaven head, orange or brown shawl and metal alms bowl. Thilashins go out on alms rounds on uposatha and receive uncooked rice or money.\n\nThilashins are addressed with the honorifics \"sayale\" (, \"little teacher\") and \"daw\" (, ). These are used as honorifics to the Buddhist name given.\n\nThilashins often reside in either separate quarters or in segregated kyaung (temple-monasteries). They do not have to look after the monks, but may help cook if required. Although ranked lower than the monks, they are not subservient to them.\n\nThere have been efforts by some thilashins to reinstate the bhikkhuni lineage, although there are reservations from the government and general populace. A new Theravada bhikkhuni sangha was first convened in 1996, and since then many more have taken the full vows. However, within Myanmar, thilashins remain the only monastic option for women at this time. In 2003, Saccavadi and Gunasari were ordained as bhikkhunis in Sri Lanka, thus becoming the first female Myanma novices in modern times to receive higher ordination in Sri Lanka.\n\nBuddhism made major contributions in the development of Burmese politics. Burmese nationalism first began with the formation of the Young Men's Buddhist Associations (YMBA) - modelled on the YMCA - which started to appear all over the country at the start of the 20th century. Buddhist monks along with students had been in the forefront of the struggle for independence and later for democracy, the best known leaders in history being U Ottama and U Seinda in Rakhine State, and U Wisara who died after a protracted hunger strike in Yangon prison. A major thoroughfare in Yangon is named after U Wisara. The League of Young Monks ( \"Yahanpyo\") based in Mandalay is a well known activist organisation. The Burmese word for boycott is \"thabeik hmauk\" (), which literally means to turn the monk's alms bowl upside down - declining to accept alms in protest.\n\nCivilian governments, after the country gained independence, patronised Buddhism, donating large sums to fund the upkeep and building of Buddhist monuments. In addition, leaders of political parties and parliamentarians, in particular U Nu, passed legislation influenced by Buddhism. He declared Buddhism the state religion which alienated minority groups, especially the Kachin. This added yet another group to the growing number of ethnic insurgencies. The present military government has been so keen to be seen as patrons of Buddhism that it has become a joke- \"Burmese TV has only two colours, green and yellow\" - describing the military green uniforms and monk's yellow robes or golden pagodas which dominate the screen.\n\nShwedagon Pagoda has been an important venue for large public meetings where both Aung San and his daughter Aung San Suu Kyi had made their famous speeches. During the second university strike in history of 1936, the students camped out on the Shwedagon terraces.\n\nAung San Suu Kyi returned from London to lead the National League for Democracy which was founded during the 1988 popular uprising, but was placed under house arrest in 1989; since she is a devout Buddhist and leader of the opposition, she is considered a socially engaged Buddhist.\n\nIn September 2007, Buddhists again took to the streets in the Saffron Revolution, a mass protest against the military government. Thousand of junta military and police forces poured into Yangon to try to control the situation, which rapidly deteriorated. A curfew was imposed and on 25 September troops surrounded Sule Pagoda. The protest continued to grow with regular citizens joining to support and defend the Buddhists. Overnight, junta forces invaded all the kyaungs in the country and imprisoned thousands of monks. It was reported that Nobel prize winning human rights activist and Buddhist Aung San Suu Kyi was removed from her home where she languished under house arrest and moved to the infamous Insein Prison. Mass protests erupted over this and junta troops began firing on monks, civilians, and demonstrators in the largest clash since 1988, which left thousands injured and hundreds dead. Images of the brutality were aired worldwide. Leaders around the world condemned the junta's actions and many nations imposed economic sanctions on Myanmar in protest. The President of the United States, George W. Bush, addressed the United Nations, stating, \"Every civilized nation has a responsibility to stand up for people suffering under a brutal military regime like the one that has ruled Burma for so long.\" The Burmese junta responded by trying to control media coverage, curtail travel, censor news stories, and shut down access to the Internet.\n\nIn November 2008, U Gambira, a leader of the All Burma Monks' Alliance, was sentenced to 68 years in prison, at least 12 years of which will be hard labour; other charges against him are still pending. In early 2009, his sentence was reduced to 63 years. His sentence was protested by Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International considers him a prisoner of conscience. Both groups called for his immediate release. Gambira was released during a mass pardon of prisoners on 13 January 2012 as part of the 2011–2012 Burmese political reforms. He ceased to be a monk in April 2012, stating that he had been unable to find a monastery to join due to his status as a former prisoner. He was re-arrested at least three times in 2012, and as of 11 December 2012, was released on bail.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "90187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=90187", "title": "Chalchiuhtlicue", "text": "Chalchiuhtlicue\n\nChalchiuhtlicue (from \"chālchihuitl\" \"jade\" and \"cuēitl\" \"skirt\") (also spelled Chalciuhtlicue, Chalchiuhcueye, or Chalcihuitlicue) (\"She of the Jade Skirt\") is an Aztec deity of water, rivers, seas, streams, storms, and baptism. Chalchiuhtlicue is associated with fertility and she is the patroness of childbirth. Chalchiuhtlicue was highly revered in Aztec culture at the time of the Spanish conquest and she was an important deity figure in the Postclassic Aztec realm of central Mexico. Chalchiuhtlicue belongs to a larger group of Aztec rain gods and she is closely related to another Aztec water god, Chalchiuhtlatonal.\n\nChalchiuitlicue directly translates to \"Jade her skirt,\" however, her name is most commonly interpreted as \"she of the jade skirt.\" She was also known as Matlalcueitl, \"Owner of the green skirt,\" by the Tlaxcalans, an indigenous group who inhabited the republic of Tlaxcala. Most texts describe Chalchiuitlicue as married to the rain god, Tlaloc. However, others describe her as the sister of Tlaloc, or the wife of Xiuhtecuhtli (also called Huehueteotl). Chalchiuitlicue is the mother of Tecciztecatl, an Aztec moon god.\n\nIn Aztec religion, Chalchiuitlicue helps Tlaloc to rule the paradisial kingdom of Tlalocan. Chalchiutlicue brings fertility to crops and is thought to protect women and children.\n\nChalchiutlicue's association with both water and fertility is derived from the Aztecs' common association of the womb with water. This dual power gave her both life-giving and a life-ending role in Aztec religion. In the Aztec creation myth of the Five Suns, Chalchiuhtlicue presided over the Fourth Sun, or the fourth creation of the world. It is believed that Chalchiuhtlicue retaliated against Tlaloc's mistreatment of her by releasing 52 years of rain, causing a giant flood which caused the Fourth Sun to be destroyed. She built a bridge linking heaven and earth and those who were in Chalchiuhtlicue's good graces were allowed to traverse it, while others were turned into fish. Following the flood, the Fifth Sun, the world which we now occupy, developed.Chalchiutlicue is also credited with the death of those who died in canoe or drowning accidents.\nChalchiutlicue is depicted in several central Mexican manuscripts, including the Pre-Columbian Codex Borgia (plates 11 and 65), the 16th century Codex Borbonicus (page 5), the 16th century Codex Ríos (page 17), and the Florentine Codex, (plate 11). When represented through sculpture, Chalchiutlicue is often carved from green stone in accordance with her name.\n\nThe Pyramid of the Moon is a large pyramid located in Teotihuacán, the dominant political power in the central Mexican region during the Early Classic period (ca. 200–600 CE). The pyramid is thought to have been at one point dedicated to Chalchiutlicue. It accompanies The Pyramid of the Sun, which is thought to have been dedicated to Chalchiutlicue's husband, Tlaloc.\n\nIn the mid 19th century, archaeologists unearthed a 20-ton monolithic sculpture depicting a water goddess that is believed to be Chalchiuhtlicue from underneath The Pyramid of the Moon. The sculpture was excavated from the plaza forecourt of the Pyramid of the Moon structure. The sculpture was relocated by Leopoldo Batres to Mexico City in 1889, where it is presently in the collection of the Museo Nacional de Antropología.\n\nChalchihuitlicue wears a distinctive headdress, which consists of several broad bands, likely cotton, trimmed with amaranth seeds. Large round tassels fall from either side of the headdress. Chalchihuitlicue typically wears a shawl adorned with tassels and a skirt. She is often depicted sitting with a stream of water flowing out of or from behind her skirt. \n\nIn the Codex Borbonicus (page 5), Chalchihuitlicue wears an elaborate blue and white headdress. She sits on a red stool and a stream of water flows out from the bottom of her stool. A male baby and female baby, who are depicted as if swimming, are carried in the water. \n\nIn the Codex Borgia (page 65), Chalchihuitlicue sits on a red throne and a river flows outwards from behind her body. Two figures stand in the water and Chalchihuitlicue gesticulates out towards them. She wears an elaborate yellow headdress. \n\nFive of the twenty big celebrations in the Aztec calendar were dedicated to Chalchiutlicue and her husband (or brother), Tlaloc. During these celebrations, priests dove into a lake and imitated the movements and the croaking of frogs, hoping to bring rain.\n\nChalchiutlicue presides over the day \"5 Serpent\" and the trecena of \"1 Reed\". Her feast is celebrated in the ventena of \"Etzalqualiztli\". As she is associated with the fertility of both people and land, the Aztecs asked Chalchiutlicue for a good harvest of crops. \n\nAs Chalchiutlicue was the guardian of the children and newborns, she played a central role in the process of childbirth. As mothers and babies often died in the process of childbirth, the role of the midwife was also of utmost importance in the process. During labor the midwife would speak to the newborn and ask the gods that the baby's birth insure a prime place among them. After cutting the umbilical cord, the midwife would wash the new baby with customary greetings to Chalchiutlicue. Four days after the birth, the child was given a second bath and a name.\n\nAs reported by Sahagún's informants, the midwife would say, \"The gods Ometecutli and Omecioatl who realm in the ninth and tenth heavens, have begotten you in this light and brought you into this world full of calamity and pain take then this water, which will protect you life, in the name of the goddess Chalchiutlicue.\" She would then sprinkle water at the head of the child and say, \"Behold this element without whose assistance no mortal being can survive.\" She also would sprinkle water on the breast of the baby while saying, \"Receive this celestial water that washes impurity from your heart.\" Then she would go to the head and say, \"Son receive this divine water, which must be drank that all may live that it may wash you and wash away all your misfortunes, part of the life since the beginning of the world: this water in truth has a unique power to oppose misfortune.\" Finally, the midwife would wash the entire body of the baby and say, \"In which part of you is unhappiness hidden? Or in which part are you hiding? Leave this child, today, he is born again in the healthful waters in which he has been bathed, as mandated by the will of the god of the sea Chalchiutlicue.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "50359748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50359748", "title": "Chiminigagua", "text": "Chiminigagua\n\nChiminigagua, Chiminichagua or Chimichagua was the supreme being, omnipotent god and creator of the world in the religion of the Muisca. The Muisca and their confederation were one of the four advanced civilizations of the Americas and developed their own religion on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense in the Andes.\n\nChiminigagua was a universally good god and represented the only light that existed when it was night time. When the world was created there was only darkness and the only light was given by Chiminigagua. When Chiminigagua decided to shine light across the Universe, he first opened his gigantic belly from where light was shining. He then created two large black birds and launched them into space. The birds spread light from their beaks which produced light in the cosmos. Thus he created light and everything in the world. Chiminigagua showed the importance of his important gods Chía (the Moon), Sué (the Sun) and Cuchavira (rainbow). Adoring the Moon and the Sun for the Muisca was praising Chiminigagua. The creation of the Sun and Moon gave rise to mother goddess Bachué.\n\nThe solar cult and belief in the supreme being is comparable to other indigenous peoples of the Americas and elsewhere in the world. Tezcatlipoca was a similar deity for the Aztec and Viracocha was his counterpart for the Incas. Solar cults and gods are found in other religions as well; Horus, Ra and Aton for the Egyptians, Mitra for the Persians, Shamash for the people in Mesopotamia, Helios for the Greeks and Surya in India. Quetzalcoatl and Huitzilopochtli represented the Sun for the Aztec and the Mayas praised Kinich Ahau, while the Incas believed Inti symbolised the Sun and created the Inca civilization.\n\nThe most important sanctuaries established in pre-Columbian Colombia were erected in Sugamuxi, present-day Sogamoso, Guatavita, Bacatá (currently Colombian capital Bogotá) and Guachetá. \"Zaque\" Goranchacha constructed a temple in Hunza, today known as Tunja, and honouring him the people placed the \"Cojines del zaque\" (\"Zaque Pillows\"), two circular stones made of the same rock, there. Every day before sunrise the \"zaque\" with his priests and some of the indigenous people gathered and prayed the Sun would rise in the east. The ruler of the Muisca kneeled down on the Pillows and the people prayed, sang and danced. In some occasions there were human sacrifices where the hearts of twelve year old children were taken from their bodies and offered to the holy Sun.\n\nSogamoso was considered a sacred city in the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes and was known as the \"City of the Sun\", blessed by Bochica. It was here the pilgrims gathered to adore Chiminigagua. When the Spanish conquistadores led by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada reached the area of the Muisca they were searching for gold and the legendary \"El Dorado\". Their torches burnt the sacred Sun Temple, destroying one of the most elaborated religious works of the Muisca. The Sun Temple has been reconstructed in the Archeology Museum of Sogamoso, see image.\n\nChiminigagua has been described at the end of the 16th century by the Spanish chroniclers Pedro Simón and Juan de Castellanos.\n\nThe supreme being of the Muisca was a static deity without body who ruled over all the other gods. He was however never praised directly, yet through his lesser gods of the Sun, Moon and fertility; Chía, Sué and Chaquén. Chiminigagua's messenger god was Bochica. When the Spanish arrived in Muisca territory they were described as \"children of the Sun\".\n\n"}

This auspicious Rath Yatra is celebrated at the Sansthan Shri Kalaram Mandir located at the Panchvati Van, which is dedicated to Lord Rama. The second day of the festival is the most important one, in which a long procession headed by the Pujadhikari is held accompanied by the Rath Of Lord Yama. During the whole procession, the Pujadhikari faces the Rath with folded hands and also keeps fasting from the very first day of the Chaitra month. The festival of Ramnavami is celebrated by the bursting of crackers and pompous lighting which attracts people from all over the world. \nNashik also hosts festivals for Makar Sankranti and Diwali.\n\nNashik is home to many temples and religious sites of the Jain Hindu and Muslim religions.\nIn February 2016, the Statue of Ahimsa, a 108 ft idol of first Jain tirthankara Rishabhdev carved in monolithic stone was consecrated at Mangi Tungi. It is recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records as the tallest Jain idol in the world.It has become a major pilgrimage and tourist destination.\nNashik is situated at the foothills of Western Ghats, on the banks of River Godavari. The city hosts numerous religious pilgrimages and festivals, including the Nashik-Trimbakeshwar Simhastha, which is one of four Kumbh Mela fairs. It is held every 12 years in one of the four places in India including Nashik.\n\nNashik is also known for its abundant fruits and vegetables. The yield of grapes, strawberries and onions in Nashik is among the highest in the country. Nashik's people are known for their cultural art, literature, and food.\n\nThe primary language spoken in Nashik is Marathi. It is the native language of the city and state, and originates from Sanskrit.\nEnglish and Hindi are also widely spoken by the population.\n\nThe literacy rate is 89.95%, with 93.40% of men literate, and 85.92% of women.\n\nThe city has a Hindu majority, but many religions are represented. As of 2011, the city was 85.21% Hindu, 8.90% Muslim, 3.18% Buddhist, 1.10% Jain, 1.00% Christian, 0.39% Sikh, 0.17% not stated, and 0.05% other.\n\nIt is also home to Nashik-Trimbakeshwar Simhastha – a Hindu religious Mela (fair) held every 12 years. It is one of the four fairs traditionally recognized as Kumbha Melas, and is also known as Nashik-Trimbak Kumbha Mela or Nashik Kumbha Mela.

{"id": "5318736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5318736", "title": "God in Sikhism", "text": "God in Sikhism\n\nSikhism is a monotheistic religion and hence, believes that \"God\" is One, and prevails in everything, as symbolized by the symbol Ik Onkar (\"one all pervading spirit\"). The fundamental belief of Sikhism is that God exists, indescribable yet knowable and perceivable to anyone who surrenders his egoism and Loves the Almighty. The Sikh gurus have described God in numerous ways in their hymns included in the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy scripture of Sikhism, but the oneness of the deity is consistently emphasized throughout. \n\nGod is described in the Mool Mantar (lit. the Prime Utterance), the first passage in the Guru Granth Sahib:\n\n\"ੴ ਸਤਿ ਨਾਮੁ ਕਰਤਾ ਪੁਰਖੁ ਨਿਰਭਉ ਨਿਰਵੈਰੁ ਅਕਾਲ ਮੂਰਤਿ ਅਜੂਨੀ ਸੈਭੰ ਗੁਰ ਪ੍ਰਸਾਦਿ ॥\" <br>\"ikk ōankār sat(i)-nām(u) karatā purakh(u) nirabha'u niravair(u) akāla mūrat(i) ajūnī saibhan gur(a) prasād(i).\" <br>\"There is but one all pervading spirit, and it is called the truth, It exists in all creation, and it has no fear, It does not hate and, it is timeless, universal and self-existent! You will come to know it through the grace of the Guru.\" \n\n(SGGS. Pg 1) Sri Guru Granth Sahib\n\nSikhism is strictly monotheistic and believes that there is only One God. Guru Nanak prefixed the numeral \"IK\" (one) to the syllable Onkar stress the idea of God's oneness; that the Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer is One. Sikh thought begins with the One Almighty and then universalising him, coming down to the cosmic reality of all-pervading Onkar.\nSikhism complies with the concept of Priority Monism, a view point that all existing things go back to a Source that is distinct from them. It is the belief that all what our senses comprehend is illusion; God is the sole reality. Forms being subject to Time, shall pass away. God's Reality alone is eternal and abiding. The thought is such that Atmaa(soul) is born from and a reflection of ParamAtma( Supreme Soul), and would again merge into it just as water merges back into the water.\n\nGod and Soul are identical in the same way as Fire and its sparks; fundamentally same as is stated in Guru Granth, \"Atam meh Ram, Ram meh Atam\", which means \"The Ultimate Eternal reality resides in the Soul and the Soul is contained in Him\". As from one stream, millions of waves arise and yet the waves, made of water, again become water; in the same way all souls have sprung from the Universal Being and would blend again into it.\n\nAnother philosophy of Sikhism is the concept of Pantheism which says that every being is identical to Divinity. It focuses on the subject of a non-anthropomorphic concept of God, to the extent that one can interpret God as the Universe itself. Sikh thought holds a pantheistic tone when it discusses the Immanence of God (Sagun), which says that the whole Universe is an abode of the All-pervasive Lord. However, Sikhism does not hold the concept of Pantheism fully as it understands God to be both, transcendent and immanent at the same time. Sikh philosophy fuses the concepts of Theism and Pantheism as to the belief that God exists in His Creation to a Theistic level, that is the One upon whom everything depends; the ultimate Preserver. \n\nIt can be deduced that Sikhism agrees with Pantheistic belief only to the extent that Universe can be considered as Divine, never understating the Transcendence of God which deems the Creator as above His Creation.\n\nSikh philosophy believes that the One God is the Great Architect of Universe. He alone is the Creator, Sustain-er, and Destroyer; Ek Onkar. God is Karta Purakh, the Creator-Being. He created the spatial-temporal Universe from His own Self; Universe is His own emanation. Guru Arjan advocates: “True is He and true is His creation [because] all has emanated from God Himself” (SGGS Pg 294).\n\nBefore creation, God existed all alone as \"Nirgun\"; in a state of Sunn Samadhi, deep meditation, as says Guru Nanak. \n\nThen, God willed and created the Universe, and diffused himself into the nature as \"Sargun\". Whenever God desires, He merges back into His Timeless and Formless Self.\n\nGuru Gobind Singh calls this process of Creation and Dissolution as \"Udkarkh\" (from Sanskrit \"utkarsana\") and \"Akarakh\" (from Sanskrit \"akarsana\"), respectively: \n\n\"Whenever you, O Creator, cause udkarkh (increase, expansion), the creation assumes the boundless body; whenever you effect akarkh (attraction, contraction), all corporeal existence merges in you\" (Benati Chaupai). \n\nThis process of creation and dissolution has been repeated God alone knows for how many times. A passage in Sukhmani by Guru Arjan visualizes the infinite field of creation thus:\n\nIt is believed in Sikh that the Universe was created by a single word of the God. The Transcendent God expresed Himself in \"Naam\" and \"Sabad\" that created the world. \"Naam\" and \"Sabad\" are the 'Creative and Dynamic Immanence of God'.\nSikh philosophy enunciates the belief that the Limits of Time and Space are known only to God. Answers to the questions of \"When did the Universe came into existence?\" or \"How big this Universe is?\" are beyond Human understanding and the best course, as Guru Nanak proclaims, is to admit a sense of Wonderfulness or \"Vismad\", since \"the featureless Void was in ceaseless Existence\". As to the Time of Creation, Guru Nanak, in Jap(u) Sahib, recites that: \n\nAs stated in Mool Mantar, God exists as Ajuni, beyond incarnations; formless. And \"saibhan\" (Sanskrit \"svayambhu\"), Self-existent. The Primal Creator Himself had no creator. He simply is, has ever been and shall ever be by Himself.\n\nPurakh added to Karta in the Mool Mantar is the Punjabi form of Sanskrit \"purusa\", which literally means, besides man, male or person, \"the primeval man as the soul and original source of the universe; the personal and animating principle; the supreme Being or Soul of the universe.\" Purakh in Mool Mantar is, therefore, none other than God the Creator. \n\nGod, as stated in Guru Granth Sahib, is \"Akal Murat\", the Eternal Being; He is beyond time and ever the same. \"Saibhan(g)\", another attribute to God means that no one else but God created Himself. He is, shall be, was not born, and shall not die; never created and hence, shall never be destroyed. The phrase \"Ad(i) Sach\", True in the Primal Beginning, in the Mool mantar proves the notion of the eternalness of God in Sikhism.\n\nSikhism advocates a Panentheistic tone when it enunciates the belief that God is both, transcendent and immanent, or \"Nirgun\" and \"Sargun\" (as stated in the Sikh terminology), at the same time. God created the Universe and permeates both within and without. Transcendence and Immanence are two aspects of the same single Supreme Reality. The Reality is immanent in His entire creation, but the creation as a whole fails to contain God fully.\n\nThe Almighty, Himself, is the one Ultimate, Transcendent Reality, Nirguna (Nir+Guna = without attributes), Ever-existent, Boundless, Formless, Immutable, All-by Himself, and Unknowable in His entirety. \n\nWhen it pleases God, He becomes Sarguna (Sanskrit Saguna = with attributes) and manifests Himself in creation. He becomes immanent in His created universe, which is His own emanation, an aspect of Himself. \n\nGod remains distinct from his Creation, while being All-pervasive.\n\n\"God himself is the Creator and the Cause, the Doer and the Deed.\" Sikh thought is strictly monotheistic and believes that this Universe is creation of God. Its origins are in God, it operates under the Command of God (hukum), and its end is in God; God is the Omnipotent being, the sole cause of Creation, Preservation, and Destruction. He consults none in creating and demolishing, giving and taking but does all things Himself. The Nirbhau (lit. Fearless) Almighty does not fear anyone and exercises His unquestionable will.\n\nHe is kind and merciful, the Omni-Benevolent Lord. The Bestow-er of all things; apart from Him, there is no other Giver. He is also a great Pardoner; pardoning all our sins, He bestows Virtue on the repenting souls and adds Blessedness on the  striving virtuous. The Almighty sustains His Creation compassionately and benevolently. In Guru Granth, God is called as \"Karim\" (merciful); the complacent Lord who, in his compassion, blesses the miserable with his Nadar (graceful vision). The Nirvair (lit. without enmity) God does not hate anyone and glances his merciful vision on every being, indifferently.\n\n\"The Lord is kind and compassionate to all beings and creatures; His Protecting Hand is over all.\" (SGGS. Pg 300)\n\nAccording to Sikhism, God has \"No\" Gender. Mool Mantar describes God as being \"Ajuni\" (lit. not in any incarnations) which implies that God is not bound to any physical forms. This concludes: the All-pervading Lord is Gender-less. \nHowever, The Guru Granth consistently refers to God as \"He\" and \"Father\", but this is because the Granth is written in north Indian Indo-Aryan languages (mixture of Punjabi and dialects of Hindi) which have no neutral gender. English translation of the teachings eliminate any gender specifications. From further insights into the Sikh philosophy, it can be deduced that God is, sometimes, referred to as the Husband to the Soul-brides. Also, God is considered to be our father, mother, and companion.\n\nSikhism believes in Monotheism and hence, has no specific names for God. However, God has been called by many Attributive names [action-related names, Kirtan Naam (SGGS. Pg 1083), or Karam Naam (Dasam Granth, Jaap Sahib)] in Sikh literature, picked from Indian and Semitic traditions. \n\nHe is called in terms of human relations as our Father, Mother, Brother, Companion, Friend, Lover, Beloved, and Husband.\n\nOther names, expressive of His supremacy are Thakur, Prabhu(lit. God), Swami, Shah(lit. King), Paatshah(lit. respected King), Sahib, Sain (Lord, Master). \n\nGod has also been referred to, in Sikh literature, as names given to him in other religions such as Ram, Narayan, Govind, Gopal, Allah, Khuda, Karim, Rahim, Qadir etc.. \n\nOther attributive names include Nirankar(Formless), Niranjan(without sin), Data or Datar (lit. The Giver), Karta or Kartar (lit. The Doer) , Dayal(Compassionate), Kripal(Benevolent) and many more.\n\nNames peculiar to Sikhism, for God are \"Naam\" (lit. \"name\"), \"Shabad\" (\"word\") and \"Vahiguru\" (W\"ondrous Master\"). While \"Naam\" and \"Shabad\" are mystical terms standing for the Divine Manifestation, Vahiguru is a phrase expressing awe, wonder, and ecstatic joy of the worshiper as he comprehends the greatness and grandeur of the Lord and His Creation.\n\nThe center belief of Sikh thought is the soul would reincarnate in this universe unless it attains the state of \"mukti\" (liberation), which is to be achieved through the grace of God.   In its corporeal attire, the soul passes through cycles of transmigration. Through Divine Grace, it can merge back into the Cosmic Soul (Paramatma) and escape the throes of birth and death again and again. \n\nThe Mool Mantar ends with Gurparsad(i) (lit. by God's Grace), which expresses the belief of Sikh thought that God would be revealed to the Soul through Guru's grace. In Sikh theology Guru appears in three different but allied connotations, viz. God, the ten Sikh Gurus, and the gur-shabad or Guru's utterances as preserved in the Guru Granth Sahib. Of God's grace, Gurus' instruction and guidance and the scriptural Shabad (Sanskrit \"sabda\", literally 'Word'), the first is the most important, because, as nothing happens without God's will or pleasure, His grace is essential to making a person inclined towards a desire and search for union with Him.\n\n\"Blessing us with His Grace, the Kind and Compassionate All-powerful Lord comes to dwell within the mind and body. (SGGS. Pg 49)\"\n\nKnowledge of the ultimate Reality is not a matter for reason; it comes by revelation of the ultimate reality through \"nadar\" (grace) and by \"anubhava\" (mystical experience). Says Guru Nanak, \"budhi pathi na paiai bahu chaturaiai bhai milai mani bhane\" which translates to \"He is not accessible through intellect, or through mere scholarship or cleverness at argument; He is met, when He pleases, through devotion\" (SGGS, 436).\n\nGnosticism is the belief that the Divine Spark is trapped within the spirit and can be liberated by the Gnosis or Knowledge of this Divinity. Sikh spirituality is centered to the theme of understanding and experiencing God, and eventually becoming one with Him. Human incarnation, as advocated by Guru Granth Sahib, is a special privilege and an opportunity for the realization of the Ultimate destiny of Spirit: union with God. \n\nAs Guru Arjan says, \"Of all the eight million and four hundred thousand species, God conferred superiority on man\". Another verse form the scripture praises the human body as a Temple: \n\nSikhism thus sees life as an opportunity to understand God as well as to discover the divinity which lies in each individual. God is perceived to reside in the human body and can be found by being a Gurmukh (lit. Facing Guru) and merging self into The Hukum or Divine Command. Though, as mentioned in Guru Granth, full understanding of God is beyond human beings, Guru Nanak described God as not wholly unknowable and stressed that by becoming Gurmukh, one should find the Divinity residing in his own self. \n\nMysticism is the experience of becoming one with The Almighty, which Guru Nanak states as Sach-Khand (Realm of Truth), where the soul is immersed completely in the Divine Will. The primal belief of Sikhism is of the Spirit to get merged into the Divinity. As Guru Granth proclaims human incarnation as a chance to meet God and enter into the Mystic Reality. \n\nIt is a devoted meditation (simran) that enables a sort of communication between the Infinite and finite human consciousness. There is, chiefly, the remembrance of God through the recitation of His name and surrendering of the Self to God's presence often metaphorized as surrendering self to the Lord's feet. The ultimate destination of a Sikh is to lose his egoism completely in the love of the Lord and finally merge into the Almighty creator.  \n\nThose, who follow the instincts of their mind, under the influence of five vices - lust, anger, greed, attachment and pride - and ego would wander miserably in the cycle of birth and rebirth.\n\nGuru Gobind Singh iniated the practice of \"Amrit Chakna\", the Baptizing ceremony of Sikhs as Khalsa, in April 1699. This distinctive identity is represented by Five \"K(akars)\" every Amritdhari (baptised) Sikh has to don:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1670380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1670380", "title": "Hakham", "text": "Hakham\n\nHakham (or \"chakam(i), haham(i), hacham(i)\"; \"\", \"wise\") is a term in Judaism, meaning a wise or skillful man; it often refers to someone who is a great Torah scholar. It can also refer to any cultured and learned person: \"He who says a wise thing is called a \"hakham\", even if he be not a Jew.\" Hence in Talmudic-Midrashic literature, wise gentiles are commonly called \"hakme ummot ha-'olam\" (\"wise men of the nations of the world\").\n\nIn Sephardic usage, \"Hakham\" is a synonym for \"rabbi\".\n\n\"Hakham\" as an official title is found as early as the first Sanhedrin, after the reconstruction of that body, when the Hadrianic religious persecutions had ceased. In addition to the nasi Simeon ben Gamliel, two other scholars stood at the head of the Sanhedrin, namely Nathan the Babylonian as \"Av Beit Din\" and Rabbi Meir as hakham. Another hakham mentioned by name was Simon, the son of Judah the Prince, who after the death of his father officiated as hakham, with his elder brother the nasi.\n\nJust what were the functions of the hakham is not clear. Rapoport's suggestion that he was the arbiter in matters of ritual prohibition and permission is highly improbable. Zecharias Frankel looks upon the hakham as a presiding officer whose duty it was to examine a case in question from all points of view, and, having summed up the results, to present the matter for discussion. It is more probable, however, that the office of hakham was created in order to secure a majority in cases of difference of opinion between the nasi and the Av Beit Din in the affairs of the Sanhedrin; one of the most eminent scholars was always chosen for the post. A baraita leads to the inference that the hakham was always the director of a school (\"bet ha-midrash\"), for in addition to the Great Sanhedrin, which later came to take the place of an academy, there were also private academies under the direction of eminent scholars. The origin of the office of hakham is as doubtful as its duration.\n\nFrankel thinks that Joshua ben Hananiah, who lived in the beginning of the second century C.E., was the first hakham, but he does not sufficiently support this assertion. The office seems to have existed in Palestine as long as the academy of the nasi. An amora of the fourth century recounts the following rule of etiquette, still observed in his time: \"When the hakham appears in the academy everyone present must rise as soon as he comes within four ells of him, and must remain standing until he has gone four ells beyond\". It is hardly possible that the office of hakham existed in Babylonia, where the relation of the exilarch to the heads of the academy was entirely different from that existing in Palestine between the latter and the nasi. Here \"hakham\" was merely the term for a Jewish scholar who studied chiefly oral traditions, while the terms \"sofer\" and \"qara\" were applied to Bible scholars. In the \"Seder Olam Zutta\", every exilarch is accompanied by a hakham, who probably had charge of the religious affairs of the exilarchate; but as this work originated in Palestine, the author probably applied Palestinian conditions to Babylon. The Syrian Aphrahat, who had met only Babylonian Jews, mentions a man \"who is called the 'hakkima' of the Jews\", but this too may mean \"the wise man\" of the Jews.\n\nThe plural, \"hakhamim,\" is generally used in the Talmud, and also by the Tannaim, to designate the majority of scholars as against a single authority. The Aramean equivalent is \"rabbanan.\"\n\nAmong Sephardi Jews (particularly Spanish and Portuguese Jews), \"hakham\" is the official title of the local rabbi, but it is not known how old the title is. Shlomo ben Aderet addresses some of his responsa to people with \"lehakham Rabbi . . .\", others again with \"larab Rabbi . . .\", but it is possible that \"lehakham\" simply means \"to the wise.\" \n\nThe surname \"Hacham\" is found among both Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jews, including variations such as \"Hachami\", \"Hachamovich\", \"Hachamson\".\n\nIn the Muslim world, a rabbi was often called a \"\" because \"al-Rab\" is one of the names of God in Islam and may have caused offense due to misunderstanding. Thus the Chief Rabbi of the Ottoman Empire was called the Hakham Bashi (Hahambaşı ).\n\nAlthough the word ' is derived from the common Semitic root ', the second consonant is generally spelled with a ' ⟨⟩ in Arabic and in languages that use Arabic alphabet to reflect the Hebrew pronunciation: . The term is cognate to the Arabic words ' (ruler/lord) and \"\" (wise man).\n\nIn Karaite Judaism, spiritual leaders are called \"hakham\" to distinguish them from their Rabbinic (i.e. non-Karaite) counterparts. Since Karaite theology is based on the use of reason by individuals to determine the applications of the Hebrew Bible's laws for themselves, the role of a \"hakham\" is more \"advisory\" than that of a rabbi in standard Orthodox Judaism.\n"}

{"id": "2777323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2777323", "title": "Hindu cosmology", "text": "Hindu cosmology\n\nIn Hindu cosmology, the universe is cyclically created and destroyed. Its cosmology divides time into four epochs or Yuga, of which the current period is the Kali Yuga. \n\nAccording to Hindu vedic cosmology, there is no absolute start to time, as it is considered infinite and cyclic. Similarly, the space and universe has neither start nor end, rather it is cyclical. The current universe is just the start of a present cycle preceded by an infinite number of universes and to be followed by another infinite number of universes.\n\nThe dominant theme in Puranic Hindu cosmology, state Chapman and Driver, is of cycles and repetition. There are multiple universes, each takes birth from chaos, grows, decays and dies into chaos, to be reborn again. Further, there are different and parallel realities. Brahma's one day equals 4.32 billion years which is a Kalpa. Each Kalpa is subdivided into four yuga (\"caturyuga\", also called \"mahayuga\"). These are \"krita\" (or \"satya\"), \"treta\", \"dvapara\" and \"kali\" yugas. The current time is stated to be one of \"kali yuga\". The starting year, length of each, or the grand total, is not consistent in the Puranas. According to Ludo Rocher, the total of four yugas is typically 4,320,000 years, of which 432,000 years is assigned to be the duration of the kali yuga.\n\nA few Hindu texts state that the world is destroyed at the end of the Kali Yuga, but most Hindu texts present the alternate cyclical theory, wherein \"caturyugas\" follow each other without interruption. The numerous differences in Hindu cosmology has been used by some scholars to chronologically date the texts that contain them, based on the presumption that the simpler models preceded more elaborate mythologically richer ones.\n\nThe \"Rigveda\" which is variously dated, generally in the second half of the 2nd-millennium BCE, presents many theories of cosmology. For example:\n\nAccording to Henry White Wallis, the \"Rigveda\" and other Vedic texts are full of alternative cosmological theories and curiosity questions. For example, the hymn 1.24 of the Rigveda asks, \"these stars, which are set on high, and appear at night, whither do they go in the daytime?\" and hymn 10.88 wonders, \"how many fires are there, how many suns, how many dawns, how many waters? I am not posing an awkward question for you fathers; I ask you, poets, only to find out?\" To its numerous open-ended questions, the Vedic texts present a diversity of thought, in verses imbued with symbols and allegory, where in some cases forces and agencies are clothed with a distinct personality, while in other cases as nature with or without anthropomorphic activity such as forms of mythical sacrifices.\n\nThe \"Rigveda\" contains the Nasadiya sukta hymn which does not offer a cosmological theory, but asks cosmological questions about the nature of universe and how it began:\n\nDeborah Soifer describes the development of the concept of lokas as follows: \nThe concept of a loka or lokas develops in the Vedic literature. Influenced by the special connotations that a word for space might have for a nomadic people, \"loka\" in the Veda did not simply mean place or world, but had a positive valuation: it was a place or position of religious or psychological interest with a special value of function of its own. Hence, inherent in the 'loka' concept in the earliest literature was a double aspect; that is, coexistent with spatiality was a religious or soteriological meaning, which could exist independent of a spatial notion, an 'immaterial' significance. The most common cosmological conception of lokas in the Veda was that of the trailokya or triple world: three worlds consisting of earth, atmosphere or sky, and heaven, making up the universe.\"\n\nThe later Puranic view asserts that the Universe is created, destroyed, and re-created in an eternally repetitive series of cycles. A day of Brahma, the creator, endures for about 4,320,000,000 years. \n\nIn the \"Brahmanda Purana\", there are fourteen worlds. However, other Puranas give different version of this cosmology and associated myths. In the Brahmanda version, the \"loka\" consist of seven higher ones (\"Vyahrtis\") and seven lower ones (\"Pātālas\"), as follows:\n\nThe same 14 lokas (worlds) are described in chapter 2.5 of the \"Bhagavata Purana\".\n\nThe Puranas genre of Indian literature, found in Hinduism and Jainism, contain a section on cosmology and cosmogony as a requirement. There are dozens of different Mahapuranas and Upapuranas, each with its own theory integrated into a proposed human history consisting of solar and lunar dynasties. Some are similar to Indo-European creation myths, while others are novel. One cosmology, shared by Hindu, Buddhist and Jain texts involves Mount Meru, with stars and sun moving around it using \"Dhruva\" (North Star) as the focal reference. According to Annette Wilke and Oliver Moebus, the diversity of cosmology theories in Hinduism may reflect its tendency to not reject new ideas and empirical observations as they became available, but to adapt and integrate them creatively.\n\nThe concept of multiverses is mentioned many times in Hindu Puranic literature, such as in the Bhagavata Purana:\n\"Every universe is covered by seven layers — earth, water, fire, air, sky, the total energy and false ego — each ten times greater than the previous one. There are innumerable universes besides this one, and although they are unlimitedly large, they move about like atoms in You. Therefore You are called unlimited\" (Bhagavata Purana 6.16.37)\nAnalogies to describe multiple universes also exist in the Puranic literature:\n\"Because You are unlimited, neither the lords of heaven nor even You Yourself can ever reach the end of Your glories. The countless universes, each enveloped in its shell, are compelled by the wheel of time to wander within You, like particles of dust blowing about in the sky. The śrutis, following their method of eliminating everything separate from the Supreme, become successful by revealing You as their final conclusion\" (Bhagavata Purana 10.87.41) \n\"The layers or elements covering the universes are each ten times thicker than the one before, and all the universes clustered together appear like atoms in a huge combination\" (Bhagavata Purana 3.11.41)\n\"And who will search through the wide infinities of space to count the universes side by side, each containing its Brahma, its Vishnu, its Shiva? Who can count the Indras in them all--those Indras side by side, who reign at once in all the innumerable worlds; those others who passed away before them; or even the Indras who succeed each other in any given line, ascending to godly kingship, one by one, and, one by one, passing away\" (Brahma Vaivarta Purana)\nAccording to Carl Sagan: \n\n\n\n\n"}

Upon the order of the government, the name was officially changed (1883–1923 and 1933–42) to Lehranstalt für die Wissenschaft des Judentums.\n\nAbraham Geiger, who had been active in establishing Reform Judaism, wanted a university for Jewish studies in Berlin. Unable to become part of the University of Berlin, he was involved in 1870 in creating a separate institution. Also involved were David Cassel, Israel Lewy and Heyman Steinthal, the Jewish \"intellectuals\" and professors at the University of Berlin.\n\nGeiger's \"General Introduction to the Science of Judaism,\" \"Introduction to the Biblical Writings\" and \"Lectures on Pirḳe Abot\" were originally delivered as lectures at the seminary. Some of the best German-Jewish teachers taught there in the spirit of the \"Wissenschaft des Judentums\" movement: Hanoch Albeck, Ismar Elbogen, Julius Grünthal, Julius Guttmann, Franz Rosenthal, Harry Torczyner, and Leo Baeck.\n\nMoritz Steinschneider referred to the \"Hochschule\" as a \"new ghetto of Jewish learning,\" which he felt could ultimately not produce the standards of scholarship achieved in the university setting .\n\nOfficially the institution was not affiliated with a movement or denomination. It sought free inquiry and research without any restrictions. It stood for a conservative Judaism, but its main object was the scientific study of things Jewish, freed as far as possible from denominational disputes. There was no religious test for professors but it was assumed that all of the faculty lived according to the Jewish tradition and were fluent in Hebrew. As the school was never dependent on any religious or public organization, the board was constantly engaged in raising money from wealthy contributors, sponsors of scholarly \"chairs\" and scholarships.\n\nIn 1872, the first year, there were only 12 students, including four women. In 1921, there were 63 full-time and 45 part-time students enrolled in the \"Hochschule\". Many of the students came from the Eastern European countries, notably Poland, as graduates of Orthodox Yeshivot. By 1930–33 the school had achieved so great a reputation that many non-Jews, especially Christian clergy, enrolled.\n\n\n\n"}

It began as a Urhobo-Kokori traditional sect, and in the 20th century was influenced by an influx of Christian evangelism.\n\nOriginating in Kokori, it gradually spread in Urhobo nation and austral Nigeria at large.\n\nThe adherents of the Igbe religion are monotheists who believe in an omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent God called Oghene and that he rewards the good and evil alike, according to their deeds.\n\nDance is a core element of the Igbe. The adherents believe that by dancing, they draw on themselves the very hand of the one and only monotheistic God.\n\nAs dancing is a core element of the Igbe, there is no worship session without dancing. They sing native Urhobo songs in place of hymns. At worship services, the Igbe priest(s), always dressed in white dress and white head gears, administer(s) native chalk on the worshippers for their protection.\n\nThe Igbe religion celebrates an annual feast, Ore Isi, for twelve days. It takes place every May, with thousands are in attendance.\n\nIgbe was founded in 1858, in Kokori Nigeria. Ubiecha Etarakpo allegedly saw an apparition of two divine beings who \"anointed\" him to preach against immorality and witchcraft. After the alleged apparition, Ubiecha became eccentric and acted insanely as no day passed without him dancing. This scared the people from coming close. It was also alleged that after the alleged apparition, Ubiecha performed amazing miracles, accurately predicted the future, healed the sick and miraculously identified witches. He built a worship house called 'ogua' in his compound and, from there, ministered to the people with native white chalk; and, allegedly prophesied with stunning accuracy. This brought people from across the Urhobo country to Kokori. Ubiecha died in 1920, after gaining fame and wealth\n\nAfter Ubiecha's death and burial. His children became divided over succession. By tradition, his eldest son, Ibodje Ubiecha succeeded his father as chief priest and head prophet; but his half brother, Akpokovo Ubiecha, established his own branch in Kokori. One of Ibodje's daughters, Mary Ibodje, a priestess, also broke away to establish her own branch before Ibodje death in 1986. Jackson Ibodje, his eldest son, succeeded him.\n\nWith the influx of Christianity into Kokori in the 20th century, the Igbe was influenced by the presence and works of the Christian Church's evangelism. Another Igbe organisation was founded by Chief Ogbevire Ogogo. This Igbe sect was infused with some elements of Christianity. They observed Christmas and New Year holidays coupled with the Igbe core festival. It gained recognition and spread in Delta, Edo, Ondo, Rivers and Lagos states of Nigeria.\n\nThough the Igbe extends beyond Urhobo land, the bulk of adherents remain Urhobo people and the principal medium of communication is largely the Urhobo language.\n\nIgbe has been criticized for rejecting conventional medical treatment. Igbe adherents believe and administer the native chalk for treatment of ailments. This has been viewed as dangerous. There have been objections to the principal utilization of Urhobo language at worship sessions, and it has been criticized as a religion of idol worship.\n"}

Although accurate statistics on religion are not available (because the national census does not solicit religious data) the actual size of Argentina's Muslim community is estimated around 1% of the total population (400,000 to 500,000 members) according to the International Religious Freedom Report 2010. The Pew Research Centre estimates about 1,000,000 Muslims in Argentina in the year 2010. The Association of Religion Data Archives however approximates that 1.9% of the population profess Islam as their faith.\n\nThere are some indications that the Muslim presence within present day Argentinian territory dates back to the time of the Spanish exploration and conquest. The first mentioned Muslim settlers were the 15th century's Moorish-Morisco (Muslims of the Iberian peninsula of North African, Middle-Eastern and Spanish descent) who explored the Americas with Spanish explorers, many of them settling in Argentina who were fleeing from persecution in Spain such as the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nHowever, in the 19th century Argentina saw the first real wave of Arabs to settle within its territory, mostly from Syria and Lebanon. It is estimated that today there are about 3.5 million Argentinians of Arab descent, most of whom are Christian.\n\nThe first two mosques in the country were built in Buenos Aires in the 80s: At-Tauhid Mosque was opened in 1983 by the shia community of Buenos Aires and with the support of the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran to Argentina, while Al Ahmad Mosque was opened in 1985 for the sunni Muslims and is the first building with Islamic architecture in the country. There are also several mosques in other cities and regions throughout the country, including two in Córdoba, two in Mar del Plata and the southernmost Sufi mosque in the world, in El Bolsón.\n\nThe King Fahd Islamic Cultural Centre, the largest mosque in Argentina, was completed in 1996 with the help of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, the then King of Saudi Arabia, Fahd, on a piece of land measuring 20,000 m². The total land area granted by the Argentine government measures 34,000 m², and was offered by President Carlos Menem following his visit to Saudi Arabia in 1992. The project cost around US$30 million, and includes a mosque, library, two schools, a park, is located in the middle-class district of Palermo, Buenos Aires.\n\nThe Islamic Organization of Latin America (IOLA), headquartered in Argentina, is considered the most active organization in Latin America in promoting Islamic affiliated endeavors.

{"id": "102915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=102915", "title": "Jack Parsons (rocket engineer)", "text": "Jack Parsons (rocket engineer)\n\nJohn Whiteside \"Jack\" Parsons (born Marvel Whiteside Parsons; October 2, 1914 – June 17, 1952) was an American rocket engineer and rocket propulsion researcher, chemist, and Thelemite occultist. Associated with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Parsons was one of the principal founders of both the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the Aerojet Engineering Corporation. He invented the first rocket engine to use a castable, composite rocket propellant, and pioneered the advancement of both liquid-fuel and solid-fuel rockets.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, Parsons was raised by a wealthy family on Orange Grove Avenue in Pasadena. Inspired by science fiction literature, he developed an interest in rocketry in his childhood and in 1928 began amateur rocket experiments with school friend Ed Forman. He dropped out of Pasadena Junior College and Stanford University due to financial difficulties during the Great Depression, and in 1934 he united with Forman and graduate student Frank Malina to form the Caltech-affiliated Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory (GALCIT) Rocket Research Group, supported by GALCIT chairman Theodore von Kármán. In 1939 the GALCIT Group gained funding from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to work on Jet-Assisted Take Off (JATO) for the U.S. military. Following American entry into World War II, in 1942 they founded Aerojet to develop and sell their JATO technology; the GALCIT Group became JPL in 1943.\n\nAfter a brief involvement with Marxism in 1939, Parsons converted to Thelema, the English occultist Aleister Crowley's new religious movement. In 1941, alongside his first wife Helen Northrup, Parsons joined the Agape Lodge, the Californian branch of the Thelemite Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). At Crowley's bidding, he replaced Wilfred Talbot Smith as its leader in 1942 and ran the Lodge from his mansion on Orange Grove Avenue. Parsons was expelled from JPL and Aerojet in 1944 due to the Lodge's infamous reputation, along with his hazardous workplace conduct.\n\nIn 1945 Parsons separated from Helen after having an affair with her sister Sara; when Sara left him for L. Ron Hubbard, he conducted the Babalon Working, a series of rituals designed to invoke the Thelemic goddess Babalon to Earth. He and Hubbard continued the procedure with Marjorie Cameron, whom Parsons married in 1946. After Hubbard and Sara defrauded him of his life savings, Parsons resigned from the O.T.O. and went through various jobs while acting as a consultant for the Israeli rocket program. Amid the climate of McCarthyism, he was accused of espionage and left unable to work in rocketry. In 1952 Parsons died at the age of 37 in a home laboratory explosion that attracted national media attention; the police ruled it an accident, but many associates suspected suicide or murder.\n\nParsons' occult and libertarian writings were published posthumously, with Western esoteric and countercultural circles citing him as one of the most significant figures in propagating Thelema across North America. Although academic interest in his scientific career was negligible, historians came to recognize Parsons' contributions to rocket engineering. For these innovations, his advocacy of space exploration and human spaceflight, and his role in the founding of JPL and Aerojet, Parsons is regarded as among the most important figures in the history of the U.S. space program. He has been the subject of several biographies and fictionalized portrayals, including the television drama \"Strange Angel\".\n\nMarvel Whiteside Parsons was born on October 2, 1914, at the Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles. His parents, Ruth Virginia Whiteside (\"c.\" 1893–1952) and Marvel H. Parsons (\"c.\" 1894–1947), had moved to California from Massachusetts the previous year, purchasing a house on Scarf Street in downtown Los Angeles. Their son was his father's namesake, but was known in the household as Jack. The marriage broke down soon after Jack's birth, when Ruth discovered that his father had made numerous visits to a prostitute, and she filed for divorce in March 1915. Parsons' father returned to Massachusetts after being publicly exposed as an adulterer, with Ruth forbidding him from having any contact with Jack. Parsons' father later joined the armed forces, reaching the rank of major, and married a woman with whom he had a son named Charles, a half-brother Jack would only meet once. Although she retained her ex-husband's surname, Ruth started calling her son John; many friends throughout his life knew him as Jack. Ruth's parents Walter and Carrie Whiteside moved to California to be with Jack and their daughter, using their wealth to buy an up-market house on Orange Grove Avenue in Pasadena—known locally as \"Millionaire's Mile\"—where they could live together. Jack was surrounded by domestic servants. Having few friends, he lived a solitary childhood and spent much time reading; he took a particular interest in works of mythology, Arthurian legend, and the \"Arabian Nights\". Through the works of Jules Verne he became interested in science fiction and a keen reader of pulp magazines like \"Amazing Stories\", which led to his early interest in rocketry.\n\nWhen he was twelve, Parsons began attending Washington Junior High School, where he performed poorly—something biographer George Pendle attributed to undiagnosed dyslexia—and was bullied for his upper-class status and perceived effeminacy. Although unpopular, he formed a strong friendship with Edward Forman, a boy from a poor working-class family who defended him from bullies and shared his interest in science fiction and rocketry, with the well-read Parsons enthralling Forman with his literary prowess. In 1928 the pair—adopting the Latin motto \"per aspera ad astra\" (\"through hardship to the stars\")—began engaging in homemade gunpowder-based rocket experiments in the nearby Arroyo Seco canyon, as well as the Parsons family's back garden, which left it pockmarked with craters from explosive test failures. They incorporated commonly available fireworks such as cherry bombs into their rockets, and Parsons suggested using glue as a binding agent to increase the rocket fuel's stability. This research became more complex when they began using materials such as aluminium foil to make the gunpowder easier to cast. Parsons had also begun to investigate occultism, and performed a ritual intended to invoke the Devil into his bedroom; he worried that the invocation was successful and was frightened into ceasing these activities. In 1929 he began attending John Muir High School, where he maintained an insular friendship with Forman and was a keen participant in fencing and archery. After he received poor school results, Parsons' mother sent him away to study at a private boarding school in San Diego—the Brown Military Academy for Boys—but he was expelled for blowing up the toilets.\n\nThe Parsons family spent mid-1929 on a tour of Europe before returning to Pasadena, where they moved into a house on San Rafael Avenue. With the onset of the Great Depression their fortune began to dwindle, and in July 1931 Jack's grandfather Walter died. Parsons began studying at the privately run University School, a liberal institution that took an unconventional approach to teaching. He flourished academically, becoming editor of the school's newspaper \"El Universitano\" and winning an award for literary excellence; teachers who had trained at the nearby California Institute of Technology (Caltech) honed his attentions on the study of chemistry. With the family's financial difficulties deepening, Parsons began working during weekends and school holidays at the offices of the Hercules Powder Company, where he learned more about explosives and their potential use in rocket propulsion. He and Forman continued to independently explore the subject in their spare time, building and testing different rockets, sometimes with materials that Parsons had stolen from work. Parsons soon constructed a solid-fuel rocket engine, and with Forman corresponded with pioneer rocket engineers including Robert H. Goddard, Hermann Oberth, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Willy Ley and Wernher von Braun. Parsons and von Braun had hours of telephone conversations about rocketry in their respective countries as well as their own research.\n\nParsons graduated from University School in 1933, and moved with his mother and grandmother to a more modest house on St. John Avenue, where he continued to pursue his interests in literature and poetry. He enrolled in Pasadena Junior College with the hope of earning an associate degree in physics and chemistry, but dropped out after only a term because of his financial situation and took up permanent employment at the Hercules Powder Company. His employers then sent him to work at their manufacturing plant in Hercules, California on San Francisco Bay, where he earned a relatively high wage of $100 a month; he was plagued by headaches caused by exposure to nitroglycerin. He saved money in the hope of continuing his academic studies and began a degree in chemistry at Stanford University, but found the tuition fees unaffordable and returned to Pasadena.\n\nIn the hope of gaining access to the state-of-the-art resources of Caltech for their rocketry research, Parsons and Forman attended a lecture on the work of Austrian rocket engineer Eugen Sänger and hypothetical above-stratospheric aircraft by the institute's William Bollay—a PhD student specializing in rocket-powered aircraft—and approached him to express their interest in designing a liquid-fuel rocket motor. Bollay redirected them to another PhD student named Frank Malina, a mathematician and mechanical engineer composing a thesis on rocket propulsion who shared their interests and soon befriended the pair. Parsons, Forman, and Malina applied for funding from Caltech together; they did not mention that their ultimate objective was to develop rockets for space exploration, realizing that most of the scientific establishment then relegated such ideas to science fiction. While Caltech's Clark Blanchard Millikan immediately rebuffed them, Malina's doctoral advisor Theodore von Kármán saw more promise in their proposal and agreed to allow them to operate under the auspices of the university's Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory (GALCIT). Naming themselves the GALCIT Rocket Research Group, they gained access to Caltech's specialist equipment, though the economics of the Great Depression left von Kármán unable to finance them.\n\nThe trio focused their distinct skills on collaborative rocket development; Parsons was the chemist, Forman the machinist, and Malina the technical theoretician. Malina wrote in 1968 that the self-educated Parsons \"lacked the discipline of a formal higher education, [but] had an uninhibited and fruitful imagination.\" The informally trained Parsons and Forman who, as described by Geoffrey A. Landis, \"were eager to try whatever idea happened to spring to mind\", contrasted with the approach of Malina, who insisted on the need for scientific discipline as informed by von Kármán. Landis writes that their creativity \"kept Malina focused toward building actual rocket engines, not just solving equations on paper\". Sharing socialist values, they operated on an egalitarian basis; Malina taught the others about scientific procedure and they taught him about the practical elements of rocketry. They often socialized, smoking marijuana and drinking, while Malina and Parsons set about writing a semiautobiographical science fiction screenplay they planned to pitch to Hollywood with strong anti-capitalist and pacifist themes.\n\nParsons met Helen Northrup at a local church dance and proposed marriage in July 1934. She accepted and they were married in April 1935 at the Little Church of the Flowers in Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, before undertaking a brief honeymoon in San Diego. They moved into a house on South Terrace Drive, Pasadena, while Parsons gained employment for the explosives manufacturer Halifax Powder Company at their facility in Saugus. Much to Helen's dismay, Parsons spent most of his wages funding the GALCIT Rocket Research Group. For extra money he manufactured nitroglycerin in their home, constructing a home laboratory on their front porch. At one point he pawned Helen's engagement ring, and he often asked her family for loans.\n\nMalina recounted that \"Parsons and Forman were not too pleased with an austere program that did not include at least the launching of model rockets\", but the Group reached the consensus of developing a working static rocket motor before embarking on more complex research. They contacted liquid-fuel rocket pioneer Robert H. Goddard and he invited Malina to his facility in Roswell, New Mexico, but he was not interested in cooperating—reticent about sharing his research and having been subjected to widespread derision for his work in rocketry. They were instead joined by Caltech graduate students Apollo M. O. \"Amo\" Smith, Carlos C. Wood, Mark Muir Mills, Fred S. Miller, William C. Rockefeller, and Rudolph Schott; Schott was relied upon for the use of his pickup truck to transport equipment. Their first liquid-fuel motor test took place near the Devil's Gate Dam in the Arroyo Seco on Halloween 1936. Parsons' biographer John Carter described the layout of the contraption as showing\n\nThree attempts to fire the rocket failed; on the fourth the oxygen line was accidentally ignited and perilously billowed fire at the Group, but they viewed this experience as formative. They continued their experiments throughout the last quarter of 1936; after the final test was successfully completed in January 1937 von Kármán agreed that they could perform their future experiments at an exclusive rocket testing facility on campus.\nIn April 1937 Caltech mathematician Qian Xuesen (a Chinese citizen) joined the Group. Several months later Weld Arnold, a Caltech laboratory assistant who worked as the Group's official photographer, also joined. The main reason for Arnold's appointment to this position was his provision of a donation to the Group on behalf of an anonymous benefactor. They became well known on campus, earning the moniker of the \"Suicide Squad\" for the dangerous nature of some of their experiments and attracting attention from the local press. Parsons himself gained further media publicity when he appeared as an expert explosives witness in the trial of Captain Earl Kynette, the head of police intelligence in Los Angeles who was accused of conspiring to set a car bomb in the attempted murder of private investigator Harry Raymond, a former LAPD detective who was fired after whistleblowing against police corruption. When Kynette was convicted largely on Parsons' testimony, which included his forensic reconstruction of the car bomb and its explosion, his identity as an expert scientist in the public eye was established despite his lack of a university education. While working at Caltech, Parsons was admitted to evening courses in chemistry at the University of Southern California (USC), but distracted by his GALCIT workload he attended sporadically and received unexceptional grades.\n\nBy early 1938 the Group had made their static rocket motor, which originally burned for three seconds, run for over a minute. In May that year, Parsons was invited by Forrest J Ackerman to lecture on his rocketry work at Chapter Number 4 of the Los Angeles Science Fiction League (LASFL). Although he never joined the society, he occasionally attended their talks, on one occasion conversing with a teenage Ray Bradbury. Another scientist to become involved in the GALCIT project was Sidney Weinbaum, a Jewish refugee from Europe who was a vocal Marxist; he led Parsons, Malina, and Qian in their creation of a largely secretive communist discussion group at Caltech, which became known as Professional Unit 122 of the Pasadena Communist Party. Although Parsons subscribed to the \"People's Daily World\" and joined the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), he refused to join the American Communist Party, causing a break in his and Weinbaum's friendship. This, coupled with the need to focus on paid employment, led to the disintegration of much of the Rocket Research Group, leaving only its three founding members by late 1938.\n\nIn January 1939 John and Frances Baxter, a brother and sister who had befriended Jack and Helen Parsons, took Jack to the Church of Thelema on Winona Boulevard, Hollywood, where he witnessed the performance of The Gnostic Mass. Celebrants of the church had included Hollywood actor John Carradine and gay rights activist Harry Hay. Parsons was intrigued, having already heard of Thelema's founder and Outer Head of the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), Aleister Crowley, after reading a copy of Crowley's text \"Konx om Pax\" (1907).\n\nParsons was introduced to leading members Regina Kahl, Jane Wolfe, and Wilfred Talbot Smith at the mass. Feeling both \"repulsion and attraction\" for Smith, Parsons continued to sporadically attend the Church's events for a year. He continued to read Crowley's works, which increasingly interested him, and encouraged Helen to read them. Parsons came to believe in the reality of Thelemic magick as a force that could be explained through quantum physics. He tried to interest his friends and acquaintances in Thelema, taking science fiction writers Jack Williamson and Cleve Cartmill to a performance of The Gnostic Mass. Although they were unimpressed, Parsons was more successful with Grady Louis McMurtry, a young Caltech student he had befriended, as well as McMurtry's fiancée Claire Palmer, and Helen's sister Sara \"Betty\" Northrup.\nJack and Helen were initiated into the Agape Lodge, the renamed Church of Thelema, in February 1941. Parsons adopted the Thelemic motto of \"Thelema Obtenteum Proedero Amoris Nuptiae\", a Latin mistranslation of \"The establishment of Thelema through the rituals of love\". The initials of this motto spelled out T.O.P.A.N., also serving as the declaration \"To Pan\". Commenting on Parsons' errors of translation, in jest Crowley said that \"the motto which you mention is couched in a language beyond my powers of understanding\". Parsons also adopted the Thelemic title \"Frater T.O.P.A.N\"—with \"T.O.P.A.N\" represented in Kabbalistic numerology as \"210\"the name with which he frequently signed letters to occult associates—while Helen became known as \"Soror Grimaud\". Smith wrote to Crowley saying that Parsons was \"a really excellent man ... He has an excellent mind and much better intellect than myself ... JP is going to be very valuable\". Wolfe wrote to German O.T.O. representative Karl Germer that Parsons was \"an A1 man ... Crowleyesque in attainment as a matter of fact\", and mooted Parsons as a potential successor to Crowley as Outer Head of the Order. Crowley concurred with such assessments, informing Smith that Parsons \"is the most valued member of the whole Order, with no exception!\"\n\nAt von Kármán's suggestion, Frank Malina approached the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Committee on Army Air Corps Research to request funding for research into what they referred to as \"jet propulsion\", a term chosen to avoid the stigma attached to rocketry. The military were interested in jet propulsion as a means of getting aircraft quickly airborne where there was insufficient room for a full-length runway, and gave the Rocket Research Group $1,000 to put together a proposal on the feasibility of Jet-Assisted Take Off (JATO) by June 1939, making Parsons et al. the first U.S. government-sanctioned rocket research group. Since their formation in 1934, they had also performed experiments involving model, black powder motor-propelled multistage rockets. In a research paper submitted to the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), Parsons reported these rockets reaching velocities of 4,875 miles per hour, thereby demonstrating the potential of solid fuels to be more effective than the liquid types primarily preferred by researchers such as Goddard. In light of this progress, Caltech and the GALCIT Group received an additional $10,000 rocketry research grant from the AIAA.\n\nAlthough a quarter of their funding went on repairing damage to Caltech buildings caused by their experiments, in June 1940 they submitted a report to the NAS in which they showed the feasibility of the project for the development of JATO and requested $100,000 to continue; they received $22,000. Now known as GALCIT Project Number 1, they continued to be ostracized by other Caltech scientists who grew increasingly irritated by their accidents and noise pollution, and were forced to relocate their experiments back to the Arroyo Seco, at a site with unventilated, corrugated iron sheds that served as both research facilities and administrative offices. It was here that JPL would be founded. Parsons and Forman's rocket experiments were the cover story of the August 1940 edition of \"Popular Mechanics\", in which the pair discussed the prospect of rockets being able to ascend above Earth's atmosphere and orbit around it for research purposes, as well as reaching the Moon.\n\nFor the JATO project, they were joined by Caltech mathematician Martin Summerfield and 18 workers supplied by the Works Progress Administration. Former colleagues like Qian were prevented from returning to the project by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), who ensured the secrecy of the operation and restricted the involvement of foreign nationals and political extremists. The FBI was satisfied that Parsons was not a Marxist but were concerned when Thelemite friend Paul Seckler used Parsons' gun in a drunken car hijacking, for which Seckler was imprisoned in San Quentin State Prison for two years. Englishman George Emerson replaced Arnold as the Group's official photographer.\n\nThe Group's aim was to find a replacement for black-powder rocket motors—units consisting of charcoal, sulfur and potassium nitrate with a binding agent. The mixture was unstable and there were frequent explosions damaging military aircraft. The solid JATO fuel invented by Parsons consisted of amide, corn starch, and ammonium nitrate bound together in the JATO unit with glue and blotting paper. It was codenamed GALCIT-27, implying the previous invention of 26 new fuels. The first JATO tests using an ERCO Ercoupe plane took place in late July 1941; though they aided propulsion, the units frequently exploded and damaged the aircraft. Parsons theorized that this was because the ammonium nitrate became dangerously combustible following overnight storage, during which temperature and consistency changes had resulted in a chemical imbalance. Parsons and Malina accordingly devised a method in which they would fill the JATOs with the fuel in the early mornings shortly before the tests, enduring sleep deprivation to do so. On August 21, 1941, Navy Captain Homer J. Boushey, Jr.—watched by Clark Millikan and William F. Durand—piloted the JATO-equipped Ercoupe at March Air Force Base in Moreno Valley, California. It proved a success and reduced takeoff distance by 30%, but one of the JATOs partially exploded. Over the following weeks 62 further tests took place, and the NAS increased their grant to $125,000. During a series of static experiments, an exploding JATO did significant damage to the rear fuselage of an Ercoupe; one observer optimistically noted that \"at least it wasn't a big hole\", but necessary repairs delayed their efforts.\n\nThe military ordered a flight test using liquid rather than solid fuel in early 1942. Upon the United States' entry into the Second World War in December 1941, the Group realized they could be drafted directly into military service if they failed to provide viable JATO technology for the military. Informed by their left-wing politics, aiding the war effort against Nazi Germany and the Axis powers was as much of a moral vocation to Parsons, Forman and Malina as it was a practical one. Parsons, Summerfield and the GALCIT workers focused on the task and found success with a combination of gasoline with red fuming nitric acid as its oxidizer; the latter, suggested by Parsons, was an effective substitute for liquid oxygen. The testing of this fuel resulted in another calamity, when the testing rocket motor exploded; the fire, containing iron shed fragments and shrapnel, inexplicably left the experimenters unscathed. Malina solved the problem by replacing the gasoline with aniline, resulting in a successful test launch of a JATO-equipped A-20A plane at the Muroc Auxiliary Air Field in the Mojave Desert. It provided five times more thrust than GALCIT-27, and again reduced takeoff distance by 30%; Malina wrote to his parents that \"We now have something that really works and we should be able to help give the Fascists hell!\"\n\nThe Group then agreed to produce and sell 60 JATO engines to the United States Army Air Corps. To do so they formed the Aerojet Engineering Corporation in March 1942, in which Parsons, Forman, Malina, von Kármán, and Summerfield each invested $250, opening their offices on Colorado Boulevard and bringing in Amo Smith as their engineer. Andrew G. Haley was recruited by von Kármán as their lawyer and treasurer. Although Aerojet was a for-profit operation that provided technology for military means, the founders' mentality was rooted in the ideal of using rockets for peaceful space exploration. As Haley recounted von Kármán requesting: \"we will make the rockets—you must make the corporation and obtain the money. Later on you will have to see that we all behave well in outer space.\"\n\nDespite these successes, Parsons, the project engineer of Aerojet's Solid Fuel Department, remained motivated to address the malfunctions observed during the Ercoupe tests. In June 1942, assisted by Mills and Miller, he focused his attention on developing an effective method of restricted burning when using solid rocket fuel, as the military demanded JATOs that could provide over 100 pounds of thrust without any risk of exploding. Although solid fuels such as GALCIT-27 were more storable than their liquid counterparts, they were disfavored for military JATO use as they provided less immediate thrust and did not have the versatility of being turned on and off mid-flight. Parsons tried to resolve GALCIT-27's stability issue with GALCIT-46, which replaced the former's ammonium nitrate with guanidine nitrate. To avoid the problems seen with ammonium nitrate, he had GALCIT-46 cooled and then heated prior to testing. When it failed the test, he realized that the fuel's binding black powders rather than the oxidizers had resulted in their instability, and in June that year had the idea of using liquid asphalt as an appropriate binding agent with potassium perchlorate as oxidizer.\n\nMalina recounted that Parsons was inspired to use asphalt by the ancient incendiary weapon Greek fire; in a 1982 talk for the International Association of Astronomical Artists Captain Boushey stated that Parsons experienced an epiphany after watching workers using molten asphalt to fix tiles onto a roof. Known as GALCIT-53, this fuel proved to be significantly more stable than the Group's earlier concoctions, fulfilling Parsons' aim of creating a restricted-burn rocket fuel inside a castable container, and providing a thrust 427% more powerful than that of GALCIT-27. This set a precedent which according to his biographer John Carter \"changed the future of rocket technology\": the thermoplastic asphalt casting was durable in all climates, allowing for mass production and indefinite storage and transforming solid-fuel agents into a safe and viable form of rocket propulsion. Plasticized variants of Parsons' solid-fuel design invented by JPL's Charles Bartley were later used by NASA in Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters and by the Strategic Air Command in Polaris, Poseidon and Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\nAerojet's first two contracts were from the U.S. Navy; the Bureau of Aeronautics requested a solid-fuel JATO and Wilbur Wright Field requested a liquid-fuel unit. The Air Corps had requested two thousand JATOs from Aerojet by late 1943, committing $256,000 toward Parsons' solid-fuel type. Despite this drastically increased turnover, the company continued to operate informally and remained intertwined with the GALCIT project. Caltech astronomer Fritz Zwicky was brought in as head of the company's research department. Haley replaced von Kármán as Aerojet chairman and imposed payroll cuts instead of reducing JATO output; the alternative was to cut staff numbers while maintaining more generous salaries, but Haley's priority was Aerojet's contribution to the war effort. Company heads including Parsons were exempted from this austerity, drawing the ire of many personnel.\n\nParsons' newfound credentials and financial security gave him the opportunity to travel more widely throughout the U.S. as an ambassador for Aerojet, meeting with other rocket enthusiasts. In New York he met with Karl Germer, the head of the O.T.O. in North America and in Washington, D.C. he met Poet Laureate Joseph Auslander, donating some of Crowley's poetry books to the Library of Congress. He also became a regular at the Mañana Literary Society, which met in Laurel Canyon at the home of Parsons' friend Robert A. Heinlein and included science fiction writers including Cleve Cartmill, Jack Williamson, and Anthony Boucher. Among Parsons' favorite works of fiction was Williamson's \"Darker Than You Think\", a novelette published in the fantasy magazine \"Unknown\" in 1940, which inspired his later occult workings. Boucher used Parsons as a partial basis for the character of Hugo Chantrelle in his murder mystery \"Rocket to the Morgue\" (1942).\n\nHelen went away for a period in June 1941, during which Parsons, encouraged to do so by the sexually permissive attitude of the O.T.O., began a sexual relationship with her 17-year-old sister, Sara. Upon Helen's return, Sara asserted that she was Parsons' new wife, and Parsons himself admitted that he found Sara more sexually attractive than Helen. Conflicted in her feelings, Helen sought comfort in Smith and began a relationship with him that lasted for the rest of his life; the four remained friends. The two couples, along with a number of other Thelemites (some of whom with their children), moved to 1003 South Orange Grove Avenue, an American Craftsman-style mansion. They all contributed to the rent of $100 a month and lived communally in what replaced Winona Boulevard as the new base of the Agape Lodge, maintaining an allotment and slaughtering their own livestock for meat as well as blood rituals. Parsons decorated his new room with a copy of the Stele of Revealing, a statue of Pan, and his collection of swords and daggers. He converted the garage and laundry room into a chemical laboratory and often held science fiction discussion meetings in the kitchen, and entertained the children with hunts for fairies in the 25-acre garden.\n\nAlthough there were arguments among the commune members, Parsons remained dedicated to Thelema. He gave almost all of his salary to the O.T.O. while actively seeking out new membersincluding Formanand financially supported Crowley in London through Germer. Parsons' enthusiasm for the Lodge quickly began to impact on his professional life. He frequently appeared at Aerojet hungover and sleep-deprived from late nights of Lodge activities, and invited many of his colleagues to them, drawing the ire of staff who previously tolerated Parsons' occultism as harmless eccentricity; known to von Kármán as a \"delightful screwball\", he was frequently observed reciting Crowley's poem \"Hymn to Pan\" in an ecstatic manner compared to the preaching of Billy Graham during rocket testsand on request at parties to their great amusement. They disapproved of his hesitancy to separate his vocations; Parsons became more rigorously engaged in Aerojet's day-to-day business in an effort to resolve this weariness, but the Agape Lodge soon came under investigation by both the Pasadena Police Department and the FBI. Both had received allegations of a \"black magic cult\" involved in sexual orgies; one complainant was a 16-year-old boy who said that he was raped by lodge members, while neighbors reported a ritual involving a naked pregnant woman jumping through fire. After Parsons explained that the Lodge was simply \"an organization dedicated to religious and philosophical speculation\", neither agency found evidence of illegal activity and came to the conclusion that the Lodge constituted no threat to national security. Having been a long-term heavy user of alcohol and marijuana, Parsons now habitually used cocaine, amphetamines, peyote, mescaline, and opiates as well. He continued to have sexual relations with multiple women, including McMurtry's fiancee Claire. When Parsons paid for her to have an abortion, McMurtry was angered and their friendship broke down.\nCrowley and Germer wanted to see Smith removed as head of the Agape Lodge, believing that he had become a bad influence on its members. Parsons and Helen wrote to them to defend their mentor but Germer ordered him to stand down; Parsons was appointed as temporary head of the Lodge. Some veteran Lodge members disliked Parsons' influence, concerned that it encouraged excessive sexual polyandry that was religiously detrimental, but his charismatic orations at Lodge meetings assured his popularity among the majority of followers. Parsons soon created the Thelemite journal \"Oriflamme\", in which he published his own poetry, but Crowley was unimpressedparticularly due to Parsons' descriptions of drug useand the project was soon shelved. Helen gave birth to Smith's son in April; the child was named Kwen Lanval Parsons. Smith and Helen left with Kwen for a two-room cabin in Rainbow Valley in May. Concurrently in England, Crowley undertook an astrological analysis of Smith's birth chart and came to the conclusion that Smith was the incarnation of a god, greatly altering his estimation of him. Smith remained skeptical as Crowley's analysis was seemingly deliberately devised in Parsons' favor, encouraging Smith to step down from his role in the Agape Lodge and instructing him to take a meditative retreat. Refusing to take orders from Germer any more, Smith resigned from the O.T.O. Parsons—who remained sympathetic and friendly to Smith during the conflict and was weary of Crowley's \"appalling egotism, bad taste, bad judgement, and pedanticism\"—ceased lodge activities and resigned as its head, but withdrew his resignation after receiving a pacifying letter from Crowley.\nBy mid-1943 Aerojet was operating on a budget of $650,000. The same year Parsons and von Kármán traveled to Norfolk, Virginia on the invitation of Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox to consult on a new JATO contract for the U.S. Navy. Though JATOs were being mass-produced for military applications, JATO-propelled aircraft could not \"keep up\" with larger, bomber planes taking off from long aircraft carrier runways—which made Aerojet's industry at risk of becoming defunct. Parsons demonstrated the efficacy of the newer JATOs to solve this issue by equipping a Grumman plane with solid-fuel units; its assisted takeoff from the USS \"Charger\" was successful, but produced smoke containing a noxious, yellow-colored residue. The Navy guaranteed Parsons a contract on the condition that this residue was removed; this led to the invention of \"Aeroplex\", a technology for smokeless vapor trails developed at Aerojet by Parsons.\n\nAs the U.S. became aware that Nazi Germany had developed the V-2 rocket, the military—following recommendations from von Kármán based upon research using British intelligence—placed a renewed impetus on its own rocket research, reinstating Qian to the GALCIT project. They gave the Group a $3 million grant to develop rocket-based weapons, and the Group was expanded and renamed the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). By this point the Navy were ordering 20,000 JATOs a month from Aerojet, and in December 1944 Haley negotiated for the company to sell 51% of its stock to the General Tire and Rubber Company to cope with the increased demand. Aerojet's Caltech-linked employees—including Zwicky, Malina and Summerfield—would only agree to the sale on the condition that Parsons and Forman were removed from the company, viewing their occult activities as disreputable. JPL historian Erik M. Conway also attributes Parsons' expulsion to more practical concerns: he \"still wanted to work in the same way as he'd done in his backyard, instinctive and without regard for safety\". Parsons and Forman were unfazed, informing Haley of their prediction that the rocket industry would become obsolete in the postwar age and seeing more financial incentive in starting a chain of laundromats. Haley persuaded them to sell their stock, resulting in Parsons leaving the company with $11,000. With this money he bought the lease to 1003, which had come to be known as \"the Parsonage\" after him.\n\nNow disassociated from JPL and Aerojet, Parsons and Forman founded the Ad Astra Engineering Company, under which Parsons founded the chemical manufacturing Vulcan Powder Company. Ad Astra was subject to an FBI investigation under suspicion of espionage when security agents from the Manhattan Project discovered that Parsons and Forman had procured a chemical used in a top secret project for a material known only as \"x-metal\", but they were later acquitted of any wrongdoing. Parsons continued to financially support Smith and Helen, although he asked for a divorce from her and ignored Crowley's commands by welcoming Smith back to the Parsonage when his retreat was finished. Parsons continued to hold O.T.O. activities at the Parsonage but began renting rooms at the house to non-Thelemites, including journalist Nieson Himmel, Manhattan Project physicist Robert Cornog, and science fiction artist Louis Goldstone. Parsons attracted controversy in Pasadena for his preferred clientele. Parsonage resident Alva Rogers recalled in a 1962 article for an occultist fanzine: \"In the ads placed in the local paper Jack specified that only bohemians, artists, musicians, atheists, anarchists, or any other exotic types need to apply for rooms—any mundane soul would be unceremoniously rejected\".\n\nScience fiction writer and U.S. Navy officer L. Ron Hubbard soon moved into the Parsonage; he and Parsons became close friends. Parsons wrote to Crowley that although Hubbard had \"no formal training in Magick he has an extraordinary amount of experience and understanding in the field. From some of his experiences I deduce he is direct touch with some higher intelligence, possibly his Guardian Angel. ... He is the most Thelemic person I have ever met and is in complete accord with our own principles.\"\n\nParsons and Sara were in an open relationship encouraged by the O.T.O.'s polyandrous sexual ethics, and she became enamored with Hubbard; Parsons, despite attempting to repress his passions, became intensely jealous. Motivated to find a new partner through occult means, Parsons began to devote his energies to conducting black magic, causing concern among fellow O.T.O. members who believed that it was invoking troublesome spirits into the Parsonage; Jane Wolfe wrote to Crowley that \"our own Jack is enamored with Witchcraft, the houmfort, voodoo. From the start he always wanted to evoke something—no matter what, I am inclined to think, as long as he got a result.\" He told the residents that he was imbuing statues in the house with a magical energy in order to sell them to fellow occultists. Parsons reported paranormal events in the house resulting from the rituals; including poltergeist activity, sightings of orbs and ghostly apparitions, alchemical (sylphic) effect on the weather, and disembodied voices. Pendle suggested that Parsons was particularly susceptible to these interpretations and attributed the voices to a prank by Hubbard and Sara. One ritual allegedly brought screaming banshees to the windows of the Parsonage, an incident that disturbed Forman for the rest of his life. In December 1945 Parsons began a series of rituals based on Enochian magic during which he masturbated onto magical tablets, accompanied by Sergei Prokofiev's Second Violin Concerto. Describing this magical operation as the Babalon Working, he hoped to bring about the incarnation of Thelemite goddess Babalon onto Earth. He allowed Hubbard to take part as his \"scribe\", believing that he was particularly sensitive to detecting magical phenomena. As described by Richard Metzger, \"Parsons jerked off in the name of spiritual advancement\" while Hubbard \"scanned the astral plane for signs and visions.\"\n\nTheir final ritual took place in the Mojave Desert in late February 1946, during which Parsons abruptly decided that his undertaking was complete. On returning to the Parsonage he discovered that Marjorie Cameron—an unemployed illustrator and former Navy WAVE—had come to visit. Believing her to be the \"elemental\" woman and manifestation of Babalon that he had invoked, in early March Parsons began performing sex magic rituals with Cameron, who acted as his \"Scarlet Woman\", while Hubbard continued to participate as the amanuensis. Unlike the rest of the household, Cameron knew nothing at first of Parsons' magical intentions: \"I didn't know anything about the O.T.O., I didn't know that they had invoked me, I didn't know anything, but the whole house knew it. Everybody was watching to see what was going on.\" Despite this ignorance and her skepticism about Parsons' magic, Cameron reported her sighting of a UFO to Parsons, who secretly recorded the sighting as a materialization of Babalon.\n\nInspired by Crowley's novel \"Moonchild\" (1917), Parsons and Hubbard aimed to magically fertilize a \"magical child\" through immaculate conception, which when born to a woman somewhere on Earth nine months following the working's completion would become the Thelemic messiah embodying Babalon. To quote Metzger, the purpose of the Babalon Working was \"a daring attempt to shatter the boundaries of space and time\" facilitating, according to Parsons, the emergence of Thelema's Æon of Horus. When Cameron departed for a trip to New York, Parsons retreated to the desert, where he believed that a preternatural entity psychographically provided him with \"Liber 49\", which represented a fourth part of Crowley's \"The Book of the Law\", the primary sacred text of Thelema, as well as part of a new sacred text he called the \"Book of Babalon\". Crowley was bewildered and concerned by the endeavor, complaining to Germer of being \"fairly frantic when I contemplate the idiocy of these louts!\" Believing the Babalon Working was accomplished, Parsons sold the Parsonage to developers for $25,000 under the condition that he and Cameron could continue to live in the coach house, and he appointed Roy Leffingwell to head the Agape Lodge, which would now have to meet elsewhere for its rituals.\n\nParsons co-founded a company called Allied Enterprises with Hubbard and Sara, into which Parsons invested his life savings of $20,970. Hubbard suggested that with this money they travel to Miami to purchase three yachts, which they would then sail through the Panama Canal to the West Coast, where they could sell them on for a profit. Parsons agreed, but many of his friends thought it was a bad idea. Hubbard had secretly requested permission from the U.S. Navy to sail to China and South and Central America on a mission to \"collect writing material\"; his real plans were for a world cruise. Left \"flat broke\" by this defrauding, Parsons was incensed when he discovered that Hubbard and Sara had left for Miami with $10,000 of the money; he suspected a scam but was placated by a telephone call from Hubbard and agreed to remain business partners. When Crowley, in a telegram to Germer, dismissed Parsons as a \"weak fool\" and victim to Hubbard and Sara's obvious confidence trick, Parsons changed his mind, flew to Miami and placed a temporary injunction and restraining order on them. Upon tracking them down to a harbor in County Causeway, Parsons discovered that the couple had purchased three yachts as planned; they tried to flee aboard one but hit a squall and were forced to return to port. Parsons was convinced that he had brought them to shore through a lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram containing an astrological, geomantic invocation of Bartzabela vengeful spirit of Mars. Allied Enterprises was dissolved and in a court settlement Hubbard was required to promise to reimburse Parsons. Parsons was discouraged from taking further action by Sara, who threatened to report him for statutory rape since their sexual relationship took place when she was under California's age of consent of 18. Parsons was ultimately compensated with only $2,900. Hubbard, already married to Margaret Grubb, bigamously married Sara and went on to found Dianetics and Scientology.\n\n\"The Sunday Times\" published an article about Hubbard's involvement with the O.T.O. and Parsons' occult activities in December 1969. In response, the Church of Scientology released an unsubstantiated press statement which said that Hubbard had been sent as an undercover agent by the U.S. Navy to intercept and destroy Parsons' \"black magic cult\", and save Sara from its influence. The Church also stated that Robert A. Heinlein was the clandestine Navy operative who \"sent in\" Hubbard to undertake this operation. Returning to California, Parsons completed the sale of the Parsonage, which was then demolished, and resigned from the O.T.O. He wrote in his letter to Crowley that he did not believe that \"as an autocratic organization, [the O.T.O.] constitutes a true and proper medium for the expression and attainment\" of Thelema.\n\nParsons was employed by North American Aviation at Inglewood, where he worked on the Navaho Missile Program. He and Cameron moved into a house in Manhattan Beach, where he instructed her in occultism and esotericism. When Cameron developed catalepsy, Parsons referred her to Sylvan Muldoon's books on astral projection, suggesting that she could manipulate her seizures to accomplish it. They were married on October 19, 1946, four days after his divorce from Helen was finalized, with Forman as their witness. Parsons continued to be seen as a specialist in rocketry; he acted as an expert consultant in numerous industrial tribunals and police and Army Ordnance investigations regarding explosions. In May 1947, Parsons gave a talk at the Pacific Rocket Society in which he predicted that rockets would take humans to the Moon. Although he had become distant from the now largely defunct O.T.O. and had sold much of his Crowleyan library, he continued to correspond with Crowley until the latter's death in December 1947.\n\nAt the emergence of the Cold War, a Red Scare developed in the U.S. as the Congressional House Un-American Activities Committee began investigating and obstructing the careers of people with perceived communist sympathies. Many of Parsons' former colleagues lost their security clearances and jobs as a result, and eventually the FBI stripped Parsons of his clearance because of his \"subversive\" character, including his involvement in and advocacy of \"sexual perversion\" in the O.T.O. He speculated in a June 1949 letter to Germer that his clearance was revoked in response to his public dissemination of Crowley's \"Liber OZ\", a 1941 tract summarizing the individualist moral principles of Thelema. Declassified FBI documents later revealed that the FBI's primary concern was Parsons' former connections to Marxists at Caltech and his membership of the also \"subversive\" ACLU. When they interviewed Parsons he denied communist sympathies but informed them of Sidney Weinbaum's \"extreme communist views\" and Frank Malina's involvement in Weinbaum's communist cell at Caltech, which resulted in Weinbaum's arrest for perjury since he had lied under oath by denying any involvement in communist groups. Malina's security clearance was withdrawn as well. In reaction to this hostile treatment, Parsons sought work in the rocket industry abroad. He sought advice to do so in correspondence with von Kármán; whose advice he followed by enrolling in an evening course in advanced mathematics at USC to bolster his employability in the field—but again he neglected attendance and failed the course. Parsons again resorted to bootlegging nitroglycerin for money, and managed to earn a wage as a car mechanic, a manual laborer at a gas station, and a hospital orderly; for two years he was also a faculty member at the USC Department of Pharmacology. Relations between Parsons and Cameron became strained; they agreed to a temporary separation and she moved to Mexico to join an artists' commune in San Miguel de Allende.\n\nUnable to pursue his scientific career, without his wife and devoid of friendship, Parsons decided to return to occultism and embarked on sexually based magical operations with prostitutes. He was intent, informally following the ritualistic practice of Thelemite organization the A∴A∴, on performing \"the Crossing of the Abyss\", attaining union with the universal consciousness, or \"All\" as understood in Thelemic mysticism, and becoming the \"Master of the Temple\". Following his apparent success in doing so, Parsons recounted having an out-of-body experience invoked by Babalon, who astrally transported him to the biblical City of Chorazin, an experience he referred to as a \"Black Pilgrimage\". Accompanying Parsons' \"Oath of the Abyss\" was his own \"Oath of the AntiChrist\", which was witnessed by Wilfred Talbot Smith. In this oath, Parsons professed to embody an entity named \"Belarion Armillus Al Dajjal\", the Antichrist \"who am come to fulfill the law of the Beast 666 [Aleister Crowley]\". Viewing these oaths as the completion of the Babalon Working, Parsons wrote an illeist autobiography titled \"Analysis by a Master of the Temple\" and an occult text titled \"The Book of AntiChrist\". In the latter work, Parsons (writing as \"Belarion\") prophesied that within nine years Babalon would manifest on Earth and supersede the dominance of the Abrahamic religions.\n\nDuring this period, Parsons also wrote an essay on his individualist philosophy and politics—which he described as standing for \"liberalism and liberal principles\"—titled \"Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword\", in which he condemned the authoritarianism, censorship, corruption, antisexualism and racism he saw as prevalent in American society. None of these works were published in his lifetime. Through Heinlein, Parsons received a visit from writer L. Sprague de Camp, with whom he discussed magic and science fiction, and disclosed that Hubbard had sent a letter offering him Sara back. De Camp later referred to Parsons as \"An authentic mad genius if I ever met one\", and based the character Courtney James on him in his time travel story \"A Gun for Dinosaur\" (1956). Parsons was also visited by Jane Wolfe, who unsuccessfully appealed for him to rejoin the dilapidated O.T.O. He entered a brief relationship with an Irishwoman named Gladis Gohan; they moved to a house on Redondo Beach, a building known by them as the \"Concrete Castle\". Cameron returned to Redondo Beach from San Miguel de Allende and violently argued with Parsons upon discovering his infidelity, before she again left for Mexico. Parsons responded by initiating divorce proceedings against her on the grounds of \"extreme cruelty\".\nParsons testified to a closed federal court that the moral philosophy of Thelema was both anti-fascist and anti-communist, emphasizing his belief in individualism. This along with references from his scientific colleagues resulted in his security clearance being reinstated by the Industrial Employment Review Board, which ruled that there was insufficient evidence that he had ever had communist sympathies. This allowed Parsons to obtain a contract in designing and constructing a chemical plant for the Hughes Aircraft Company in Culver City. Von Kármán put Parsons in touch with Herbert T. Rosenfeld, President of the Southern Californian chapter of the American Technion Societya Zionist group dedicated to supporting the newly created State of Israel. Rosenfeld offered Parsons a job with the Israeli rocket program and hired him to produce technical reports for them. In November 1950, as the Red Scare intensified, Parsons decided to migrate to Israel to pursue Rosenfeld's offer, but a Hughes secretary whom Parsons had asked to type up a portfolio of technical documents reported him to the FBI. She accused Parsons of espionage and attempted theft of classified company documents on the basis of some of the reports that he had sought to submit to the Technion Society.\nParsons was immediately fired from Hughes; the FBI investigated the complaint and were suspicious that Parsons was spying for the Israeli government. Parsons denied the allegations when interrogated; he insisted that his intentions were peaceful and that he had suffered an error of judgment in procuring the documents. Some of Parsons' scientific colleagues rallied to his defense, but the case against him worsened when the FBI investigated Rosenfeld for being linked to Soviet agents, and more accounts of his occult and sexually permissive activities at the Parsonage came to light. In October 1951 the U.S. attorney decided that because the contents of the reports did not constitute state secrets, Parsons was not guilty of espionage.\n\nThe Review Board still considered Parsons a liability because of his historical Marxist affiliations and investigations by the FBI, and in January 1952 they permanently reinstated their ban on his working for classified projects, effectively prohibiting him from working in rocketry. To make a living he founded the Parsons Chemical Manufacturing Company, which was based in North Hollywood and created pyrotechnics and explosives such as fog effects and imitation gunshot wounds for the film industry, and he also returned to chemical manufacturing at the Bermite Powder Company in Saugus.\nParsons reconciled with Cameron, and they resumed their relationship and moved into a former coach house on Orange Grove Avenue. Parsons converted its large, first-floor laundry room into a home laboratory to work on his chemical and pyrotechnic projects, homebrew absinthe and stockpile his materials. They let out the upstairs bedrooms and began holding parties that were attended largely by bohemians and members of the Beat Generation, along with old friends including Forman, Malina and Cornog. They also congregated at the home of Andrew Haley, who lived on the same street. Though Parsons in his mid-thirties was a \"prewar relic\" to the younger attendees, the raucous socials often lasted until dawn and frequently attracted police attention. Parsons also founded a new Thelemite group known as \"the Witchcraft\", whose beliefs revolved around a simplified version of Crowley's Thelema and Parsons' own Babalon prophecies. He offered a course in its teachings for a ten dollar fee, which included a new Thelemic belief system called \"the Gnosis\", a version of Christian Gnosticism with Sophia as its godhead and the Christian God as its demiurge. He also collaborated with Cameron on \"Songs for the Witch Woman\", a collection of poems which she illustrated that was published in 2014.\n\nParsons and Cameron decided to travel to Mexico for a few months, both for a vacation and for Parsons to take up a job opportunity establishing an explosives factory for the Mexican government. They hoped that this would facilitate a move to Israel, where they could start a family, and where Parsons could bypass the U.S. government to recommence his rocketry career. He was particularly disturbed by the presence of the FBI, convinced that they were spying on him.\n\nOn June 17, 1952, a day before their planned departure, Parsons received a rush order of explosives for a film set and began to work on it in his home laboratory. An explosion destroyed the lower part of the building, during which Parsons sustained mortal wounds. His right forearm was amputated, his legs and left arm were broken and a hole was torn in the right side of his face. Despite these critical injuries, Parsons was found conscious by the upstairs lodgers. He tried to communicate with the arriving ambulance workers, who rushed him to the Huntington Memorial Hospital, where he was declared dead approximately thirty-seven minutes after the explosion. When his mother, Ruth, was informed of the events, she immediately took a fatal overdose of barbiturates. Cameron learned of her husband's death from reporters at the scene when she returned home from grocery shopping.\n\nPasadena Police Department criminologist Don Harding led the official investigation; he concluded that Parsons had been mixing fulminate of mercury in a coffee can when he dropped it on the floor, causing the initial explosion, which worsened when it came into contact with other chemicals in the room. Forman considered this likely, stating that Parsons often had sweaty hands and could easily have dropped the can. Some of Parsons' colleagues rejected this explanation, saying that he was very attentive about safety. Two colleagues from the Bermite Powder Company described Parsons' work habits as \"scrupulously neat\" and \"exceptionally cautious\". The latter statement—from chemical engineer George Santymers—insisted that the explosion must have come from beneath the floorboards, implying an organized plot to kill Parsons. Harding accepted that these inconsistencies were \"incongruous\" but described the manner in which Parsons had stored his chemicals as \"criminally negligent\", and noted that Parsons had previously been investigated by the police for illegally storing chemicals at the Parsonage. He also found a morphine-filled syringe at the scene, suggesting that Parsons was narcotized. The police saw insufficient evidence to continue the investigation and closed the case as an accidental death.\n\nBoth Wolfe and Smith suggested that Parsons' death had been suicide, stating that he had suffered from depression for some time. Others theorized that the explosion was an assassination planned by Howard Hughes in response to Parsons' suspected theft of Hughes Aircraft Company documents. Cameron became convinced that Parsons had been murdered either by police officers seeking vengeance for his role in the conviction of Earl Kynette or by anti-Zionists opposed to his work for Israel. One of Cameron's friends, the artist Renate Druks, later stated her belief that Parsons had died in a rite designed to create a homunculus. His death has never been definitively explained.\n\nThe immediate aftermath of the explosion attracted the interest of the U.S. media, making headline news in the \"Los Angeles Times\". These initial reports focused on Parsons' prominence in rocketry but neglected to mention his occult interests. When asked for comment, Aerojet secretary-treasurer T.E. Beehan said that Parsons \"liked to wander, but he was one of the top men in the field\". Within a few days, journalists had discovered his involvement in Thelema and emphasized this in their reports.\n\nA private prayer service was held for Parsons at the funeral home where his body was cremated. Cameron scattered his ashes in the Mojave Desert, before burning most of his possessions. She later tried to perform astral projection to commune with him. The O.T.O. also held a memorial service—with attendees including Helen and Sara—at which Smith led the Gnostic Mass.\n\nParsons was considered effeminate as a child; in adult life he exhibited an attitude of machismo. His FBI file described him as \"potentially bisexual\" and he once expressed experiencing a latent homosexuality. The actor Paul Mathison said he had had a gay relationship with Parsons in the 1950s, though this was disputed by others who knew him and Cameron. Parsons had the reputation of being a womanizer, and was notorious for frequently flirting and having sexual liaisons with female staff members at JPL and Aerojet. He was also known for personal eccentricity such as greeting house guests with a large pet snake around his neck, driving to work in a rundown Pontiac, and using a mannequin dressed in a tuxedo with a bucket labelled \"The Resident\" as his mailbox.\n\nAs well as a fencing and archery enthusiast, Parsons was also a keen shooter; he often hunted jack rabbits and cotton tails in the desert, and was amused by mock dueling with Forman while on test sites with rifles and shotguns. Upon proposing to his first wife Helen, he gifted her a pistol. Parsons enjoyed playing pranks on his colleagues, often through detonating explosives such as firecrackers and smoke bombs, and was known to spend hours at a time in the bathtub playing with toy boats while living at the Parsonage.\n\nAs well as intense bursts of creativity, Parsons suffered from what he described as \"manic hysteria and depressing melancholy.\" His father Marvel, after suffering a near-fatal heart attack, died as a psychiatric patient at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington D.C. diagnosed with severe clinical depression, a condition Pendle suggested the younger Parsons inherited.\n\nParsons' obituary listed him as a member of the Army Ordnance Association, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the American Chemical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, anddespite his lack of an academic degreethe Sigma Xi fraternity. It also stated that he had turned down several honorary degrees.\n\nParsons adhered to the occult philosophy of Thelema, which had been founded in 1904 by the English occultist Aleister Crowley following a spiritual revelation that he had in Cairo, Egypt, when—according to Crowley's accounts—a spirit being known as Aiwass dictated to him a prophetic text known as \"The Book of the Law\". Prior to becoming aware of Thelema and Crowley, Parsons' interest in esotericism was developed through his reading of \"The Golden Bough\" (1890), a work in comparative mythology by Scottish social anthropologist James George Frazer. Parsons had also attended lectures on Theosophy by philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti with his first wife Helen, but disliked the belief system's sentiment of \"the good and the true\". During rocket tests, Parsons often recited Crowley's poem \"Hymn to Pan\" as a good luck charm. He took to addressing Crowley as his \"Most Beloved Father\" and signed off to him as \"thy son, John\".\n\nIn July 1945, Parsons gave a speech to the Agape Lodge, in which he attempted to explain how he felt that \"The Book of the Law\" could be made relevant to \"modern life\". In this speech, which was subsequently published under the title of \"Doing Your Will\", he examined the Thelemite concept of True Will, writing that:\n\nParsons identified four obstacles that prevented humans from achieving and performing their True Will, all of which he connected with fear: the fear of incompetence, the fear of the opinion of others, the fear of hurting others, and the fear of insecurity. He insisted that these must be overcome, writing that \"The Will must be freed of its fetters. The ruthless examination and destruction of taboos, complexes, frustrations, dislikes, fears and disgusts hostile to the Will is essential to progress.\"\n\nThough Parsons was a lifelong devotee to Thelema, he grew weary of and eventually left the Ordo Templi Orientis—the religious organization that began propagating Thelema under Crowley's leadership from the 1910s—which Parsons viewed, despite the disagreement of Crowley himself, as excessively hierarchical and impeding upon the rigorous spiritual and philosophical practice of True Will, describing the O.T.O. as \"an excellent training school for adepts, but hardly an appropriate Order for the manifestation of Thelema\". In this sense Parsons was described by Carter as an \"almost fundamentalist\" Thelemite who placed \"The Book of the Law\"s dogma above all other doctrine.\n\nFrom early on in his career, Parsons took an interest in socialism and communism, views that he shared with his friend Frank Malina. Under the influence of another friend, Sidney Weinbaum, the two joined a communist group in the late 1930s, with Parsons reading Marxist literature, but he remained unconvinced and refused to join the American Communist Party. Malina asserted that this was because Parsons was a \"political romantic\", whose attitude was more anti-authoritarian than anti-capitalist. Parsons later became critical of the Marxist–Leninist government of the Soviet Union led by Joseph Stalin, sarcastically commenting that\n\nDuring the era of McCarthyism and the Second Red Scare in the early 1950s, Parsons was questioned regarding his former links to the communist movement, by which time he denied any connection to it, instead describing himself as \"an individualist\" who was both anti-communist and anti-fascist. In reaction to the McCarthyite red-baiting of scientists, he expressed disdain that\n\nParsons was politically influenced by Thelemawhich holds to the ethical code of \"Do what thou wilt\"equating this principle to the libertarian views of some of the Founding Fathers of the United States in his article \"Freedom is a Lonely Star\", writing that by his own time these values had been \"sold out by America, and for that reason the heart of America is sick and the soul of America is dead.\" He proceeded to criticize many aspects of contemporary U.S. society, particularly the police force, remarking that \"The police mind is usually of a sadistic and homicidal trend\" and noting that they carried out the \"ruthless punishment of symbolic scapegoats\" such as African-Americans, prostitutes, alcoholics, homeless people and sociopolitical radicals, under the pretense of a country that upheld \"liberty and justice for all.\"\n\nTo bring about a freer future Parsons believed in liberalizing attitudes to sexual morality stating that, in his belief, the publication of the Kinsey report and development of the psychonautical sciences had as significant an influence on Western society as the creation of the atomic bomb and the development of nuclear physics. He also believed that in the future the restrictions on sexual morality within society should be abolished in order to bring about greater freedom and individuality. Parsons concluded that\n\nJack Cashill, American studies professor at Purdue University, argues that \"Although his literary career never got much beyond pamphleteering and an untitled anti-war, anti-capitalist manuscript\", Parsons played a significant role—greater than that of Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey—in shaping the Californian counterculture of the 1960s and beyond through his influence on contemporaries such as Hubbard and Heinlein. Hugh Urban, religious studies professor at Ohio State University, cites Parsons' Witchcraft group as precipitating the neopagan revival of the 1950s.\n\nScience fiction writer and occultist Robert Anton Wilson described Parsons' political writings as exemplifying an \"ultra-individualist\" who exhibited a \"genuine sympathy for working people\", strongly empathized with feminism and held an antipathy toward patriarchy comparable to that of John Stuart Mill, arguing in this context that Parsons was an influence on the American libertarian and anarchist movements of the 20th century. Parsons was also supportive of the creation of the State of Israel, making plans to emigrate there when his military security clearance was revoked.\n\nIn the decades following his death, Parsons was well remembered among the Western esoteric community; his scientific recognition frequently amounted to a footnote. For instance, English Thelemite Kenneth Grant suggested that Parsons' Babalon Working marked the start of the appearance of flying saucers in the skies, leading to phenomena such as the Roswell UFO incident and Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting. Cameron postulated that the 1952 Washington, D.C. UFO incident was a spiritual reaction to Parsons' death. In 1954 she portrayed Babalon in American Thelemite Kenneth Anger's short film \"Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome\", viewing this cinematic depiction of a Thelemic ritual as aiding the literal invocation of Babalon begun by Parsons' working, and later said that his \"Book of the AntiChrist\" prophecies were fulfilled through the manifestation of Babalon in her person.\n\nIn December 1958 JPL was integrated into the newly established National Aeronautics and Space Administration, after having built the \"Explorer 1\" satellite that commenced America's Space Race with the Soviet Union. Aerojet was contracted by NASA to build the main engine of the Apollo Command/Service Module, and the Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System. In a letter to Frank Malina, von Kármán ranked Parsons first in a list of figures he viewed as most important to modern rocketry and the foundation of the American space program. According to Richard Metzger, Wernher von Braun—who was nicknamed \"The Father of Rocket Science\"—once argued that Parsons was more worthy of this moniker. In October 1968 Malina, a pioneer in sounding rocketry, gave a speech at JPL in which he highlighted Parsons' contribution to the U.S. rocket project, and lamented how it had come to be neglected, crediting him for making \"key contributions to the development of storable propellants and of long duration solid propellant agents that play such an important role in American and European space technology.\"\n\nThe same month JPL held an open access event to mark the 32nd anniversary of its foundation—which featured a \"nativity scene\" of mannequins reconstructing the November 1936 photograph of the GALCIT Group—and erected a monument commemorating their first rocket test on Halloween 1936. Among the aerospace industry, JPL was nicknamed as standing for \"Jack Parsons' Laboratory\" or \"Jack Parsons Lives\". The International Astronomical Union decided to name a crater on the far side of the Moon Parsons after him in 1972. JPL later credited him for making \"distinctive technical innovations that advanced early efforts\" in rocket engineering, with aerospace journalist Craig Covault stating that the work of Parsons, Qian Xuesen and the GALCIT Group \"planted the seeds for JPL to become preeminent in space and rocketry.\"\n\nMany of Parsons' writings were posthumously published as \"Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword\" in 1989, a compilation co-edited by Cameron and O.T.O. leader Hymenaeus Beta (ceremonial name of musician William Breeze), which incited a resurgence of interest in Parsons within occult and countercultural circles. For example, comic book artist and occultist Alan Moore noted Parsons as a creative influence in a 1998 interview with Clifford Meth. The Cameron-Parsons Foundation was founded as an incorporated company in 2006, with the intention of conserving and promoting Parsons' writings and Cameron's artwork, and in 2014 Fulger Esoterica published \"Songs for the Witch Woman\"—a limited edition book of poems by Parsons with illustrations by Cameron, released to coincide with his centenary. An exhibition of the same name was held at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1999 Feral House published the biography \"Sex and Rockets: The Occult World of Jack Parsons\" by John Carter, who expressed the opinion that Parsons had accomplished more in under five years of research than Robert H. Goddard had in his lifetime, and said that his role in the development of rocket technology had been neglected by historians of science; Carter thought that Parsons' abilities and accomplishments as an occultist had been overestimated and exaggerated among Western esotericists, emphasizing his disowning by Crowley for practicing magic beyond his grade. Feral House republished the work as a new edition in 2004, accompanied with an introduction by Robert Anton Wilson. Wilson believed that Parsons was \"the one single individual who contributed the most to rocket science\", describing him as being \"very strange, very brilliant, very funny, [and] very tormented\", and considering it noteworthy that the day of Parsons' birth was the predicted beginning of the apocalypse advocated by Charles Taze Russell, the founder of the Bible Student movement.\n\nA second biography of Parsons was published in 2005 through Weidenfeld & Nicolson with the title \"Strange Angel: The Otherworldly Life of Rocket Scientist John Whiteside Parsons\"; it was written by George Pendle, who described Parsons as \"the Che Guevara of occultism\" and said that although Parsons \"would not live to see his dream of space travel come true, he was essential to making it a reality.\" Pendle considered that the cultural stigma attached to Parsons' occultism was the primary cause of his low public profile, noting that \"Like many scientific mavericks, Parsons was eventually discarded by the establishment once he had served his purpose.\" It was this unorthodox mindset,  creatively facilitated by his science fiction fandom and \"willingness to believe in magic's efficacy\",  Pendle argued, \"that allowed him to break scientific barriers previously thought to be indestructible\"—commenting that Parsons \"saw both space and magic as ways of exploring these new frontiers—one breaking free from Earth literally and metaphysically.\"\n\nL. Ron Hubbard's role in Parsons' Agape Lodge and the ensuing yacht scam were explored in Russell Miller's 1987 Hubbard biography \"Bare-faced Messiah\". Parsons' involvement in the Agape Lodge were also discussed by Martin P. Starr in his history of the American Thelemite movement, \"The Unknown God: W.T. Smith and the Thelemites\", published by Teitan Press in 2003. \"The QI Book of the Dead\" (2004), based on the BBC game show, included a Parsons obituary. Parsons' occult partnership with Hubbard was also mentioned in Alex Gibney's 2015 documentary film \"Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief\", produced by HBO.\n\nBefore his death, Parsons appeared in science fiction writer Anthony Boucher's murder-mystery novel \"Rocket to the Morgue\" (1942) under the guise of mad scientist character Hugo Chantrelle. Another fictional character based on Parsons was Courtney James, a wealthy socialite who features in L. Sprague de Camp's 1956 short time travel story \"A Gun for Dinosaur\". In 2005 \"Pasadena Babalon\", a stage play about Parsons written by George D. Morgan and directed by Brian Brophy, premiered at Caltech as a production by its theater Arts Group in 2010, the same year Cellar Door Publishing released Richard Carbonneau and Robin Simon Ng's graphic novel, \"The Marvel: A Biography of Jack Parsons\". In 2012 the Science Channel broadcast a documentary dramatization titled \"Magical Jet Propulsion\" in an episode of its \"\" television series. Parsons was portrayed by English actor Adam Howden. Independent record label Drag City released \"Parsons' Blues\", an instrumental tribute single by experimental rock act Six Organs of Admittance.\n\nIn 2014 AMC Networks announced plans for a serial television dramatization of Parsons' life, but in 2016 it was reported that the series \"will not be going forward.\" In 2017 the project was adopted as a web television series by CBS All Access. \"Strange Angel\", produced by Mark Heyman and starring Irish actor Jack Reynor, premiered in June 2018.\n\n\n"}

Many of its members also attend services at conventional synagogues.\n\nIt is an interpretation of Jewish philosophy that was originally conceived by Rabbi Alfred G. Moses in the early 1900s in response to the growing influence of Christian Science and the New Thought Movement. Rather than the paternal God figure encountered in Hebrew tradition, \"Jewish Science views God as an Energy or Force penetrating the reality of the universe. God is the source of all Reality and not separate from but part of the world and Right thinking has a healing effect\". His fundamental teachings are found in his 1916 book \"Jewish Science: Divine Healing in Judaism\". The movement was institutionalized in 1922 with Rabbi Morris Lichtenstein's founding of the Society of Jewish Science.\n\nJewish Science shares several principle beliefs with Christian Science and the New Thought movement, and it is intended to function as a counterweight to the Christian elements in both of these movements and strictly maintain its Jewish identity. It was founded by Alfred G. Moses, Morris Lichtenstein and Tehilla Lichtenstein in 1916. It emphasizes the role of affirmative prayer, \"divine healing\" and \"Right thinking\" as self help methods essential to a Jew's physical and spiritual health, but does not rule out the importance of medical intervention - unlike Christian Science. Jewish Science also incorporates psychology, and concepts about practical spirituality similar to beliefs developed in the New Thought movement. Thanks to radio broadcasts on WMCA and the establishment of the \"Jewish Science Interpreter\" magazine the movement attracted numerous adherents, thereby helping its rise to prominence in the Jewish community. Today the Society's \"Home Center\" and synagogue is located in midtown Manhattan, NY. The Society also maintains a congregation in Los Angeles California. Also many study groups around the country which focus on each of the main texts of Jewish Science.\n\nLichtenstein found affirmative prayer to be particularly useful because, he believed, it provided the personal benefits of prayer without requiring the belief in a supernatural God who could suspend the laws of nature. He considered affirmative prayer to be a method to access inner power that could be considered divine, but not supernatural. He taught that the origins of affirmative prayer can be found in the Old Testament Book of Psalms, and that affirmations, or affirmative prayers, are best offered in silence.\n\n\n\n"}

Most recently, he served as Gresham Professor of Geometry at Gresham College from 2008 to 2011. Barrow is also a writer of popular science and an amateur playwright.\n\nBarrow attended Barham Primary School in Wembley until 1964 and Ealing Grammar School for Boys from 1964–71 and obtained his first degree in mathematics and physics from Van Mildert College at the University of Durham in 1974. In 1977, he completed his doctorate in astrophysics at Magdalen College, Oxford, supervised by Dennis William Sciama.\n\nBarrow was a Junior Research Lecturer at Christ Church, Oxford, from 1977–81. He did two postdoctoral years as a Miller Research Fellow in astronomy at the University of California, Berkeley, as a Commonwealth Lindemann Fellow (1977–8) and Miller Fellow (1980–1).\n\nIn 1981 he joined the University of Sussex and rose to the rank of Professor and Director of the Astronomy Centre. In 1999, he became Professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics and a fellow in Clare Hall at Cambridge University. He is Director of the Millennium Mathematics Project. From 2003–2007 he was Gresham Professor of Astronomy at Gresham College, London, and he has been appointed as Gresham Professor of Geometry from 2008–2011; only one person has previously held two different Gresham chairs. In 2008, the Royal Society awarded him the Faraday Prize. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (London) in 2003 and elected Fellow of the Academia Europaea in 2009. he has received Honorary Doctorates from the Universities of Hertfordshire, Sussex, Durham, S. Wales and Szczecin, and is an Honorary Professor at the University of Nanjing. He is an Honorary Fellow of Van Mildert College, Durham University and of Gresham College, London. He was a Centenary Gifford Lecturer at the University of Glasgow in 1989.\n\nSince 1999, he has directed the Millennium Mathematics Project (MMP) at the University of Cambridge. This is an outreach and education programme to improve the appreciation, teaching and learning of mathematics and its applications. In 2006 it was awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Educational Achievement by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace.\n\nIn addition to having published more than 500 journal articles, Barrow has coauthored (with Frank J. Tipler) \"The Anthropic Cosmological Principle\", a work on the history of the ideas, specifically intelligent design and teleology, as well as a treatise on astrophysics. He has also published 22 books for general readers, beginning with his 1983 \"The Left Hand of Creation\". His books summarise the state of the affairs of physical questions, often in the form of compendia of a large number of facts assembled from the works of great physicists, such as Paul Dirac and Arthur Eddington.\n\nBarrow's approach to philosophical issues posed by physical cosmology makes his books accessible to general readers. For example, Barrow introduced a memorable paradox, which he called \"the Groucho Marx Effect\" (see Russell-like paradoxes). Here, he quotes Groucho Marx: \"I wouldn't want to belong to any club that would accept me as a member\". Applying this to problems in cosmology, Barrow states: \"A universe simple enough to be understood is too simple to produce a mind capable of understanding it.\" \nBarrow has lectured at 10 Downing Street, Windsor Castle, and the Vatican, as well as to the general public. In 2002, his play \"Infinities\" premiered in Milan, played in Valencia, and won the Premi Ubu 2002 Italian Theatre Prize.\n\nHe was awarded the 2006 Templeton Prize for \"Progress Toward Research or Discoveries about Spiritual Realities\" for his \"writings about the relationship between life and the universe, and the nature of human understanding [which] have created new perspectives on questions of ultimate concern to science and religion\".

The Famous Swargate chowk in Pune is named after Keshavrao Jedhe.\n\n\nIn the 1930s Keshavrao Jedhe joined the Congress and several youths were attracted towards the party. He brought the Maratha community of Maharashtra into mainstream politics and won the first election in November 1934 for the Bombay Presidency legislative council. At this time there was a vacuum in Congress Leadership after Lokmanya Tilak's death, eventually Keshwarao Jedhe took over congress leadership in Pune. In 1938, Keshavrao became president of the state Congress and Jedhe Mansion was the centre of activity. Keshavrao Jedhe was instrumental in building the Congress Bhavan in Pune but Jedhe Mansion continued to be the inspiration for common Congressmen.\n\n\nThings changed after Independence. In 1948, after Mahatma Gandhi's death Keshavrao was unhappy with Congress leaders, he left the party to become one of the founder members of Peasants and Workers Party (PWPI). He fought the first Lok Sabha election against his friend and Congress candidate N. V. Gadgil but lost. Disappointed with PWP leaders, Jedhe returned to the Congress fold in August 1952.\n\nLater, Yashwantrao Chavan often said he joined the Congress only because of Keshavrao.\n\nThe Indian National Congress was pledged to linguistic states, but the States Re-organisation Committee recommended a bi-lingual state for Maharashtra-Gujarat, with Mumbai as its capital. Its inauguration on 1 November 1956, caused a great political stir and, under the leadership of Keshavrao Jedhe, an all-party meeting was held in Pune and Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti was founded on 6 February 1956. In the second general election the Samiti defeated the stalwarts of Congress by securing 101 seats out of 133, including 12 from Mumbai. The Congress could form a government only with the support of Gujarat, Marathwada and Vidarbha. Yashwantrao Chavan became the first Chief Minister of the bi-lingual Bombay State.\n\nS.M. Joshi, SA Dange, NG Gore and PK Atre fought relentlessly for Samyukta Maharashtra, even at the cost of sacrificing the lives of several people and finally succeeded in convincing Congress leaders that Maharashtra should form a separate state. The resignation of CD Deshmukh, the then Finance Minister of the Nehru Cabinet, had its salutary effect, and on 1 May 1960, the state of Maharashtra, which included western Maharashtra, Vidarbha and Marathwada was born with the blessings of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\n\nJedhe Mansion at 907, Shukrawar Peth, Pune, was houses of Keshwarao Jedhe, once the centre of political and social activities in Pune and Maharashtra during Pre and Post Independence Era.\nJedhe Mansion was built by Marutrao Babaji Jedhe in 1885, Jedhe Mansion was where Keshavrao Jedhe launched his stormy battles against social norms and the political establishment of the day from the late 1920s to the 1960s. \nPune was then divided into ‘western’ and ‘eastern’ parts, along geographical and sociological lines. Western Pune, represented by Kesari Wada, was dominated by Brahmins and their culture, while eastern Pune was represented by Jedhe Mansion and Keshavrao’s bahujan samaj.\n\nThe Jedhe family believed in the ideology of Satyashodhak Samaj, set up by Mahatma Phule. Keshavrao’s elder brothers Dadasaheb and Baburao were close associates of Shahu Maharaj of Kolhapur who was then spearheading the Satyashodhak movement. Shahu Maharaj visited Jedhe Mansion whenever he was in Pune.\n\nIn the 1920s, Jedhe Mansion emerged as a political and social school for several youths from the bahujan samaj. The Jedhe brothers lived together and the story goes that a minimum of 50 people, (not members of the Jedhe family), shared a meal at any given time. An activist of the Satyashodhak movement would head straight for Jedhe Mansion as soon as he landed in Pune. \nApart from common workers, it was also home to stalwarts like Karmaveer Vitthal Ramji Shinde, Kakasaheb Gadgil, Dinkarrao Jawalkar and Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil. Leaders like Pandit Motilal Nehru, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Dr Rajendra Prasad, Jayaprakash Narayan, Senapati Bapat, Bhausaheb Hire and Shankarrao Deo also visited Jedhe Mansion. Mahatma Gandhi too came to Jedhe Mansion twice.\n\nTill 1934, Jedhe Mansion was the centre of social activities related to the Independence movement in Maharashtra. During this period, Maharashtra witnessed several controversies like Shivaji’s memorial and installation of the statue of Mahatma Phule in Pune. Jedhe Mansion was where strategies were drawn up to fight the anti-social and Conservist activities. Jedhe Mansion also witnessed several meetings on the Goa Liberation Movement and the Samyukta Maharashtra agitation in 1956.\n\n"}

It is noted for its \"magnificent\" mosaic floor.\n\nThe original date of the synagogue is uncertain but is before the 6th century. In a sixth-century renovation, the northern wall (closest to Jerusalem) was opened and a semi-circular apse to contain a Torah Ark was constructed. The floor level was raised and marble columns and a \"breathtakingly beautiful\" mosaic floor installed.\n\nAt the bottom of the mosaic floor is an amphora flanked by a pair of peacocks. A vine flows out of the amphora, forming loops, in each loop is a bird, animal, fruit, or a depiction of steps in the wine making process. The design is so similar to the mosaics in the church floor at nearby Shallal that they are thought to have been designed by the same artist. Both floors depict animals and have similar patterns: the synagogue floor is distinguished by a menorah flanked by two lions and several other Jewish ritual objects. The seven-branched menorah stands on three legs, like the menorah in the Temple in Jerusalem. The legs in Maon are shaped like a lion's paws. Alongside the menorah are the symbols of Judah, palm trees and lions. Etrogs, a shofar and a lulav are depicted nearby. The Mosaic has an inscription in Aramaic. The upper part of the inscription blesses all members of the community, the lower part honors three donors. An identical floor was found in the ancient synagogue in Gaza.\n\nThe synagogue is built on the basilica plan. The mosaic is in the central area, the two side aisles were paved with stone. The ceiling was made of wooden beams and clay.\n\nA number of small objects were found by the salvage dig on the floor facing the Torah Ark. These include coins and bone and metal artifacts that are thought to have been associated with the Torah Ark and its ornamental curtain. There were also fragments of glass and ceramic lamps. Dozens of amulets were also found, some of them were used by women who were asking for good health.\n\nAdjacent to the ruins of the synagogue a cistern, water channels and a mikvah.\n\nThe synagogue was built at the site of Hellenistic Menois, a city marked on the Map of Madaba. It is one of three ancient synagogues discovered in the western Negev.\n\nThe synagogue and its mosaic floor were discovered during the construction of a road in 1957. The mosaic was damaged, but the undamaged segment was preserved by a salvage excavation. After its discovery, the mosaic was neglected, causing deterioration. Restoration work began in 2006, sponsored by the Jewish National Fund, Israel Antiquities Authority and Eshkol Regional Council, and paid for by philanthropist Sandy Galet.

The worship of Dou Fu Yuan Jun has declined strongly as proper teachings of Taoism degenerate since being exported out of China. Today, most Nine Emperor God temples do not acknowledge the existence of Dou Fu Yuan Jun. However, Dou Fu Yuan Jun is invoked alongside Dou Mu Yuan Jun in Great Dipper Honouring known as \"Li Dou\" ceremonies. According To Priest Long Hua, the 35th Generation Leader of Long Shan Men Taoist Sect (Singapore), honouring the Northern Dipper stars prolongs one's life, eliminate calamities, and absolves sins and past debts of oneself and his family.Wu, Jave (2007), \nThe term \"Ye\" as in \"Jiu Huang Ye\" ( loosely translates as \"Grandfather\", a title worshipers commonly use to bring a more intimate relationship between themselves and the Nine Emperors. The Nine Emperor Gods should not be mixed up with the \"Wang Ye\" or Princes of the Ming rebels. Popular folk culture has it that the Nine Emperor Gods are actually sea pirates of the Ming dynasty that plotted to overthrow the Qing dynasty. According to Priest Long Hua, this information is inaccurate and considered derogatory to the actual teachings of Taoism as the Nine Emperor Gods are actually high-ranking Star Lords who preside over the movement of planets and coordinate mortal Life and Death issues.Wu, Jave (2008), Celebration\" \nThe Nine Emperors is formed by the seven stars of the Big Dipper of the North \"Ursa Major\" (visible) and two assistant stars (invisible to most people). The Nine Emperor Stars are:\n\n\nOn the eve of the ninth moon, temples of the deities hold a ceremony to invoke and welcome the nine emperors. Since the arrival of the gods is believed to be through the waterways, processions are held from temples to the sea shore or river to symbolize this belief. Devotees dressed in traditional white, carrying incense and candles, await the arrival of their excellencies.\n\nA carnival-like atmosphere pervades the temple throughout the nine-day festival. During this period of time, the constant tinkling of a prayer bell and chants from the temple priests are heard. Most devotees stay at the temple, eat vegetarian meals and recite continuous chanting of prayer. It is believed that there will be rain throughout the nine days of celebration.\n\nThe ninth day of the festival is its climax. A procession which draws scores of devotees sends the deities back home.\n\nIn Thailand, this festival is called \"thetsakan kin che\" (), the Vegetarian Festival. It is celebrated throughout the entire country, but the festivities are at their height in Phuket, where about 35% of the population is Thai Chinese. It attracts crowds of spectators because of many of the unusual religious rituals that are performed.\n\nIn accordance with the traditions, many religious devotees will perform ritualized mutilation upon themselves and one another while under a trance-like state, including but not limited to: impaling through cheeks, arms, face, legs, back etc., with everything from as small as syringes to as large as is agreed upon between all members; partial skinning (the skin is not removed, just cut and flipped over); slashing of limbs, chest, stomach and especially tongue with swords, axes and knives; bloodletting; removal of tissue (normally limited to cysts) and intentionally wrapping or standing near fire crackers as they are lit.\n\nThis is done without anesthetic, always inside or near the temples surrounded by other devotees with only iodine, petroleum jelly and surgical gloves as precautionary measures. Despite this scenario, many of the people performing the rituals are also the people who will care for many of the people in their recovery.\n\nTo this effect few people ever need to have prolonged medical treatment, and although in the weeks after the festival many people will be seen covered in bandages, scarring is uncommon, stitching, even on individual devotees who impale their cheeks, is rare, and return to daily activity for the devotees occurs shortly after the completion of the ritual, frequently before the festival ends unless performed on the last days, much sooner than before the bandages themselves are removed.\n\nThe purpose of this practice is a mixture of veneration for their gods and ancestors, to display their devotion to their beliefs and the trance itself, which has a profound impact upon demeanour for days or weeks after, frequently with devotees appearing exceptionally calm and focused in their day-to-day activities after the festival is completed.\n\nDuring a period of nine days, those who are participating in the festival dress all in white and \"ghin jeh\" กินเจ, which has come to be translated as abstinence from eating meat, poultry, seafood, and dairy products. Vendors and proprietors of restaurants indicate that \"jeh\" food is for sale at their establishments by putting a yellow flag out with the word เจ (\"jeh\") written on it in red. However, technically, only food prepared in the sacred kitchen of the Chinese temple (in Thailand, called \"sarnjao\" ศาลเจ้า or \"um\" อ๊ำ) is \"jeh,\" as it must undergo a series of rituals before it can be given that name.\n\n\"Masong\" ม้าทรง are the people who invite the spirits of gods to possess their bodies. \"Ma\" ม้า is the word for horse in Thai, and the name \"masong\" refers to how the spirits of the gods use the bodies of these people as a vehicle, as one rides a horse. Only pure, unmarried men or women without families of their own can become \"masong.\" At the temple they undergo a series of rituals to protect them for the duration of the festival, during which flagellation and self-mutilation is practiced. The \"masong\" tradition doesn't exist in China and is believed to have been adopted from the Indian festival of Thaipusam.\n\nThe festivities in Phuket include a procession of \"masong\" wearing elaborate costumes who pierce their cheeks and tongues with all manner of things, including swords, banners, machine guns, table lamps, and flowers. While the face is the most common area pierced, some also pierce their arms with pins and fishhooks. Teams of people accompany the \"masong\" to keep their wounds clean and to help support the heavier piercings. It is believed that while they are possessed the \"masong\" will not feel any pain. They can also be seen shaking their heads back and forth continually, and usually do not seem to \"see\" their surroundings. At the temple during the festival there is also firewalking and blade-ladder climbing. While large crowds of people gather to watch, the entranced \"mah song\" distribute blessed candy and pieces of orange cloth with Chinese characters printed on them \"yan\" ยันต์ for good luck.\n\n\n\nPhuket Vegetarian Festival 2018 | Nine Emperor Gods Festival 2018 - Video==External links==\n\n"}

OT VIII is known as \"The Truth Revealed\" and was first released to select high-ranking public Scientologists in 1988, two years after the death of Scientology's founder, L. Ron Hubbard. OT VIII is only delivered to members of the Church of Scientology in one place—aboard the organization's private cruise ship, the \"Freewinds\". OT8 is also available in the Scientology Independent Field. There are a few advanced auditors that are able to deliver the level to those who meet the prerequisites.\n\nVarious outlines purporting to describe New OT VIII have been provided by ex-members who have completed the course, such as Ariane Jackson and Michael Pattinson. Jackson has described the course as having two parts: a preparatory e-meter drill, followed by a review of \"\" and an examination of previously identified past lives to find out which ones are false. According to Pattinson, the course included an affirmation from L. Ron Hubbard that \"now he [Pattinson] knew who he wasn't, and was interested in finding out who he was.\"\n\nIn August 1995, Arnie Lerma posted the Fishman papers on the Internet. The posting contained disputed portions of OT VIII, including an exercise for communicating with animals and plants, and a passage depicting Jesus Christ as a \"lover of young boys and men ... given to uncontrollable bursts of temper and hatred\".\n\nIn OT VIII, dated 1980, Hubbard explains the document is intended for circulation only after his death. Its purpose is to explain the untold story of Hubbard's life's work. Hubbard explains that the reader has \"undoubtedly heard pieces of data over the years that hinted at the greater untold reality of my mission here on Earth\" but \"the story was never written, nor spoken. ... It is only now that I feel it safe to release the information\".\n\nHubbard mentions the Book of Revelation and its prophecy of a time when \"an arch-enemy of Christ, referred to as the Antichrist, will reign\". According to Hubbard, the \"Antichrist represents the forces of Lucifer\". Hubbard writes \"My mission could be said to fulfill the Biblical promise represented by this brief Antichrist period\".\n\nChurch of Scientology lawyers have asserted that the OT VIII documents posted by Lerma are fake, however during the copyright battle over Lerma’s web pages, the Church of Scientology's attorney Kendrick Moxon identified the \"Antichrist\" document as copyrighted material. George White, a public Scientologist who had received OT VIII in the summer of 1988, also asserts the document is authentic (and states that the course cost him US$28,000 at the time). Frank Oliver, a former operative with Scientology's Office of Special Affairs, reports having discovered the document in the church's archives. Lawrence Wollersheim, a notable defector, claims they are genuine: \"Two sets of defectors, at different times in different parts of the world, came out with those documents\", he says. \"I've been working with defectors for fifteen years. I have never dealt with anyone as afraid of having their identity revealed as the people who came out and verified those documents.\" Jesse Prince, former second-in-command of Scientology's Religious Technology Center, reports that OTVIII was revised after early participants were \"horribly upset\" by the content.\n\nOn March 24, 2008, WikiLeaks placed what it claimed was a complete set of OT levels on their site, including a version of OT VIII not previously publicly available. The Church of Scientology threatened legal action if the files were not removed, arguing that posting this information on the Wikileaks website was clear violation of copyright. WikiLeaks did not remove the documents and said the threat of legal action verified that the documents were authentic.\n\n"}

The image is painted on a cotton support, is kept in the Basílica of Our Lady of the Rosary in Chiquinquirá, where religious devotees celebrate her date of Pontifical coronation every July 9.\n\nOn 9 January 1910, Pope Saint Pius X authorised the Canonical Coronation to the image which was not carried out until 9 July 1919 due to the political turmoil prevalent at the time. On July 3, 1986, Pope John Paul II visited the sanctuary and prayed for peace in Colombia at the feet of the Virgin Mary's image. The title given to the Virgin is from the city of Chiquinquirá, where the first of the Virgin's miraculous manifestations occurred, and where the original image from the sixteenth century is kept.\n\nA later image of the Virgin of Chiquinquirá, painted on wood, can be found at the Basílica of Maracaibo, in Maracaibo, Venezuela, where it is also called \"La Chinita\". Every November 18, the city celebrates the traditional Feast of La Chinita with masses and processions in honor of the Virgin.\n\nPursuant to a commission received from Antonio de Santana, who had received in 1560 an encomienda of the Indians of Suta, a Spanish painter named Alonso de Narváez painted a portrait of the Virgin of the Rosary on a homespun piece of cotton woven by the Indians. Painting in tempera, he used mineral and organic pigments taken from the soil and from herb and flower juices of the region.\n\nIn 1562 the portrait was placed in a chapel with a roof that leaked, and in time the humidity, air and sun, had so damaged the painting that it was impossible to recognize the subject. In 1577 the damaged painting was moved to Chiquinquirá and left abandoned in a room that had formerly been a family oratory. Eight years later, Maria Ramos, a pious woman from Seville in Spain, cleaned and refurbished the modest chapel and placed in it the faded canvas that had once borne Mary's image. Tradition has it that a miraculous restoration of the painting occurred on Friday, December 26, 1586 which gradually closed the scratches and holes in the cloth, overlaying them with color and light. The image stood out again, having recovered its colors and brightness.\n\nThe Virgin of the Rosary in the center of the painting is approximately three feet high. She looks towards her left as if to call attention to the nearly naked Child in her arms. The image has a calm countenance with a delicate smile. Both her face and the Child's are pale. The Child has a little brightly colored bird tied to his thumb and a rosary hangs from his left hand. Our Lady is supported by a crescent moon in a position suggesting the woman of the Apocalypse. A white veil covers her hair and her rose-colored robe is covered by a sky blue cape. With the little finger of her left hand she holds a rosary which hangs in front of her, and in her right hand she has a scepter. On her right stands the figure of St. Anthony of Padua, and on her left that of the Apostle St. Andrew. These were the patron saints respectively of Antonio de Santana, the Spanish colonist who had commissioned the painting, and the Dominican friar, Andres Jadaque, who had arranged for de Narváez to paint it.\n\nThe figures appear blurred when looked at closely, but seem clearer at when viewed at a distance. The painting has markedly deteriorated through various causes which were assessed by Cecilia Alvarez White in course of a technical examination of the painting in 1986. These include the lack of any prepared ground to size the cotton support, the method of painting, and the nature of the pigments used which tend to degrade through exposure to light and humidity. Alvarez White concluded that the single greatest cause of pictorial degradation occurred over the 50 years preceding her examination, when the painting was exposed to more or less continuous intense electric light. In addition, for three hundred years the image of Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquirá was exposed to the faithful without any protection, permitting thousands to touch the flimsy cloth. Since 1897 a thick glass has protected the painting from inclement weather and from excesses of pilgrim fervor.\n\nOne day in November, 1709 (or 1749 according to other versions of the story), a woman, washing her clothes by the shore of Lake Maracaibo saw a small wooden tablet floating towards her. She picked it up thinking it might be of some use and took it home with her, along with the clothes. The following morning, while preparing coffee, she heard knocks as if somebody was calling her. She went to see what had happened and was astonished to see the tablet shining, with the image of Our Lady of Chiquinquirá now upon it. In a variant of the tradition, the woman first saw no more than the outline of the Virgin on the tablet, and for this reason hung it on a wall of her house; later, on Monday, 18 November, she heard knocking and strange noises coming from inside her house, and upon investigation found the tablet dazzlingly bright, illuminated by lights which shone like a rainbow. Surprised and filled with a strong emotion, she ran out of her house, shouting “Milagro! Milagro!” - hence the name \"El Milagro\" (which means Miracle in Spanish) given to the avenue where this woman's house stood. Later on, many people arrived to witness the prodigy.\n\nFrom that day on, the inhabitants of the state of Zulia in Venezuela, where Maracaibo is situated, found their Queen in what they call the “Chinita”. As it has been expressed by many people, “She is the way that leads to Jesus”. To this day, the tablet, still bearing the image on it, can be seen in the Basilica of Maracaibo.\n\nLegend has it that the government decided that the wood with the image belonged in the capital city, Caracas. So they ordered it moved. As the soldiers following the order carried the image away from Maracaibo it got heavier and heavier until finally no one could lift it. They returned it to the Basilica of Maracaibo where it has remained since.\n\nThe tablet depicting the image of the Virgin Mary was first taken to a small sanctuary built to honor San Juan de Dios and later, under the rule of the governor Francisco de la Roche Ferrer, a bigger chapel was erected to venerate the newly found image of the Virgin of Chiquinquirá. The tablet remained there until the final stage of the Basilica was completed in 1858.\n\nThe tablet is relatively small. The dimensions are: 26 centimeters wide by 25 centimeters long and 3 millimeters deep. The Virgin Mary holds the baby Jesus in her left arm. To her left is the Apostle Saint Andrew holding an open book, and to her right Saint Anthony holding a lily (a symbol of chastity) in his right hand. The tablet was restored and preserved, and embellished with 18-carat gold engraving to magnify its beauty.\n\nThe crown suspended above the tablet weighs 10 kilograms and it was made of 18-carat gold, donated by the public. Its inner arch measures 27 centimeters by 44 centimeters and a number of precious stones were embedded. It is one of the most highly prized relics in all of Zulia. By the time the crown was made it cost around 250 thousand Bolívars.\n\nIn the year 2004, the local government inaugurated the “Square of Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquirá”, an open sanctuary reminiscent of the old times when the Saladillo existed. The great monument of the Virgin of Chiquinquirá is located exactly where the washer woman's house once was. The total area of the square is 30 thousand square meters whose epicenter is a 15-meter-high allegorical statue of the Virgin Mary. There are also three mirror-like fountains as well as a smaller square devoted to Saint Sebastian, the patron saint of Maracaibo.\n\nThe people of Maracaibo celebrate the Chinita's fair in November with an all-night party. One of the main city avenues, Bella Vista, is closed for several blocks and the city puts lights along the whole avenue. The lights stay up for months, until after Christmas. There are stages set up, sponsored by the government and businesses around the city. There are firework shows and street vendors, and hundreds of thousands of people line the streets and celebrate all night.\n\nThe Chinita's fair officially begins on October 27 when the Virgin is taken down from the altar in which she rests. She tours all over the Zulia State and returns to the Basilica to start all the religious festivities. Around October 2, Bella Vista Avenue sees itself lit up by all the Christmas decorations and the local government promotes a series of public concerts with national and international artists to begin the “real” fair. Crowds of people flock together to the different stages or platforms devised to house such concerts.\n\nOther cultural activities are held during the fair. Expo-Zulia is a temporary marketplace where the zulians show a great deal products that characterize the state. Many merchants, stores, companies and artisans offer their products at reasonably low prices. The Bullfights are also popular and a number of these are held in our bullring. The “Toros coleados” is another event that people don’t usually miss. Many “gaiteros” gather in front of the basilica to sing their best gaitas in honor of Our Lady, while living a long-standing tradition of folk music.\n\nThe celebrations mark the first salvo of a long Christmas season within Venezuela.\n\nThe last two days of the Chinita's fair are the most special ones. It is during these days when all the great parties around the city are held. By the afternoon of the 17th, many people enjoy the multiple concerts and gaita bands that sing in the different pubs, clubs and discos. The party begins on the 17th and lasts way into the wee hours of the 18th, having fun in the “Gaitero Daybreak”. A lot of people usually go to the Chinita's baseball game right after this traditional party and to the “Toros coleados” in the afternoon.\n\n\nThe feast day of Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquira, Patroness of Colombia is July 9, her actual day of coronation.\n\nIn March 2008, the Colombian daily \"El Tiempo\" reported that a crisis that could have ended in an open conflict between Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela was averted by Colombian President Alvaro Uribe confiding the situation to the intercession of Mary under the three different titles by which she is the countries’ patroness. The crisis started on March 1, when Uribe ordered a military raid into Ecuador's territory against a rebel camp used by Marxist guerrillas to launch terrorist strikes. In response, Ecuador's President Rafael Correa cut all diplomatic relationships with Colombia. Venezuela's Hugo Chávez, Correa's political ally, ordered a massive military surge to the Colombian border as well. Quoting Fr. Julio Solórzano, Chaplain of Colombia's Presidential Palace, \"El Tiempo\" revealed that on March 5, with tensions increasing, President Uribe called for a Rosary to pray for the end of tensions. The Rosary, prayed at the Presidential Palace's chapel, was dedicated, upon Uribe's request, to Our Lady of Chiquinquira, Our Lady of Coromoto and Our Lady of Mercy, respectively the patronesses of Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador. Uribe invited all officials at the Presidential palace to the Rosary, as well as the minister of Defense and the Interior. “For believers –\"El Tiempo\" wrote- the prayer was more than effective, since only two days after the presidents of the three countries shook hands during the Group of Rio summit...” On April 7, at the Dominican Republic summit, the three presidents vented their differences, but agreed to stand down after Colombia apologized for the raid.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "217480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=217480", "title": "Penance", "text": "Penance\n\nPenance is repentance of sins as well as an alternate name for the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox sacrament of Reconciliation or Confession. It also plays a part in confession among Anglicans and Methodists, in which it is a rite, as well as among other Protestants. The word \"penance\" derives from Old French and Latin \"paenitentia\", both of which derive from the same root meaning repentance, the desire to be forgiven (in English see contrition). Penance and repentance, similar in their derivation and original sense, have come to symbolize conflicting views of the essence of repentance, arising from the controversy as to the respective merits of \"faith\" and \"good works\". Word derivations occur in many languages.\n\nProtestant Reformers, upholding the doctrine of justification by faith, held that repentance consisted in a change of the whole moral attitude of the mind and soul (Matthew 13:15; Luke 22:32), and that the divine forgiveness preceded true repentance and confession to God without any reparation of \"works\". Rather, \"God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance\" (Romans 2:4, ESV). In his \"Of Justification By Faith\", Calvin says: \"without forgiveness no man is pleasing to God.\" Nonetheless, in traditions formed by a Calvinist or Zwinglian sensibility there has traditionally been a stress on reconciliation as a precondition to fellowship.\nThe attitude of penance or repentance can be externalized in acts that a believer imposes on himself or herself, acts that are themselves called penances. Penitential activity is particularly common during the season of Lent and Holy Week. In some cultural traditions, this week, which commemorates the Passion of Christ, may be marked by penances that include flagellantism or even voluntary pseudo-crucifixion. Advent is another season during which, to a lesser extent, penances are performed. Acts of self-discipline are used as tokens of repentance. Easier acts of self-discipline include devoting time to prayer or reading of the Bible or other spiritual books. Examples of harder acts of self-discipline are fasting, continence, abstaining from alcohol or tobacco, or other privations. Self-flagellation and the wearing of a cilice are more rarely used. Such acts have sometimes been called mortification of the flesh, a phrase inspired by : \"If you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.\"\n\nSuch acts are associated also with the sacrament. In early Christianity, public penance was imposed on penitents, the severity of which varied according to the seriousness of the offences forgiven. Today the act of penance or satisfaction imposed in connection with the sacrament for the same therapeutic purpose can be set prayers or a certain number of prostrations or an act or omission intended to reinforce what is positive in the penitent's behaviour or to inhibit what is negative. The act imposed is itself called a penance or \"epitemia\".\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, penance is usually called Sacred Mystery of Confession. In Orthodoxy, the intention of the sacramental mystery of Holy Confession is to provide reconciliation with God through means of healing.\n\nSimilar to the Eastern Catholic Churches, in the Eastern Orthodox Church there are no confessionals. Traditionally the penitent stands or kneels before either the Icon of Christ the Teacher (to the viewers' right of the Royal Door) or in front of an Icon of Christ, \"Not Made by Hands\". This is because in Orthodox sacramental theology, confession is not made to the priest, but to Christ; the priest being there as a witness, friend and advisor. On an analogion in front of the penitent has been placed a Gospel Book and a Crucifix. The penitent venerates the Gospel Book and the cross and kneels. This is to show humility before the whole church and before Christ. Once they are ready to start, the priest says, “Blessed is our God, always, now and ever, and unto the ages of ages,” reads the Trisagion Prayers and the Psalm 50 (in the Septuagint; in the KJV this is Psalm 51).\n\nThe priest then advises the penitent that Christ is invisibly present and that the penitent should not be embarrassed or be afraid, but should open up their heart and reveal their sins so that Christ may forgive them. The penitent then accuses himself of sins. The priest quietly and patiently listens, gently asking questions to encourage the penitent not to withhold any sins out of fear or shame. After the confessant reveals all their sins, the priest offers advice and counsel. The priest may modify the prayer rule of the penitent, or even prescribe another rule, if needed to combat the sins the penitent struggles most with. Penances, known as \"epitemia\", are given with a therapeutic intent, so they are opposite to the sin committed.\n\nEpitemia are neither a punishment nor merely a pious action, but are specifically aimed at healing the spiritual ailment that has been confessed. For example, if the penitent broke the Eighth Commandment by stealing something, the priest could prescribe they return what they stole (if possible) and give alms to the poor on a more regular basis. Opposites are treated with opposites. If the penitent suffers from gluttony, the confessant’s fasting rule is reviewed and perhaps increased. The intention of Confession is never to punish, but to heal and purify. Confession is also seen as a “second baptism”, and is sometimes referred to as the \"baptism of tears\".\n\nIn Orthodoxy, Confession is seen as a means to procure better spiritual health and purity. Confession does not involve merely stating the sinful things the person does; the good things a person does or is considering doing are also discussed. The approach is holistic, examining the full life of the confessant. The good works do not earn salvation, but are part of a psychotherapeutic treatment to preserve salvation and purity. Sin is treated as a spiritual illness, or wound, only cured through Jesus Christ. The Orthodox belief is that in Confession, the sinful wounds of the soul are to be exposed and treated in the \"open air\" (in this case, the Spirit of God. Note the fact that the Greek word for Spirit (πνευμα), can be translated as \"air in motion\" or wind).\n\nOnce the penitent has accepted the therapeutic advice and counsel freely given to him or her, by the priest then, placing his epitrachelion over the head of the confessant. The priest says the prayer of forgiveness over the penitent. In the prayer of forgiveness, the priests asks of God to forgive the sins committed. He then concludes by placing his hand on the head of the penitent and says, “The Grace of the All-Holy Spirit, through my insignificance, has loosened and granted to you forgiveness.”\n\nIn summary, the Priest reminds the penitent what he or she has received is a second baptism, through the Mystery of Confession, and that they should be careful not to defile this restored purity but to do good and to hear the voice of the psalmist: “Turn from evil and do good” (). But most of all, the priest urges the penitent to guard him- or herself from sin and to commune as often as permitted. The priest dismisses the repentant one in peace.\n\nPrivate confession of sins to a priest, followed by absolution, has always been provided for in the Book of Common Prayer. In the Communion Service of the 1662 English Prayer Book, for example, we read:\n\nAnd because it is requisite, that no man should come to the holy Communion, but with a full trust in God’s mercy, and with a quiet conscience; therefore, if there be any of you, who by this means [that is, by personal confession of sins] cannot quiet his own conscience herein, but requireth further comfort or counsel; let him come to me, or to some other discreet and learned Minister of God’s Word, and open his grief; that by the ministry of God’s holy Word he may receive the benefit of absolution, together with ghostly counsel and advice, to the quieting of his conscience, and avoiding of all scruple and doubtfulness.\n\nThe status of confession as a sacrament is stated in Anglican formularies, such as the Thirty-Nine Articles. Article XXV includes it among \"Those five commonly called Sacraments\" which \"are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel . . . for that they have not any visible sign or ceremony ordained of God.\" It is important to note, however, that \"commonly called Sacraments\" does not mean \"wrongly called Sacraments;\" and that the Article merely distinguishes confession and the other rites from the two great Sacraments of the Gospel.\n\nUntil the Prayer Book revisions of the 1970s and the creation of Alternative Service Books in various Anglican provinces, the penitential rite was always part of larger services. Prior to the revision, private confessions would be according to the form of Ministry to the Sick. The form of absolution provided in the order for the Visitation of the Sick reads, \"Our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath left power to his Church to absolve all sinners who truly repent and believe in him, of his great mercy forgive thee thine offences: And by his authority committed to me, I absolve thee from all thy sins, In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.\"\n\nDespite the provision for private confession in every edition of the Book of Common Prayer, the practice was frequently contested during the Ritualist controversies of the later nineteenth century.\n\nIn the Methodist Church, as with the Anglican Communion, penance is defined by the Articles of Religion as one those \"Commonly called Sacraments but not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel\", also known as the \"five lesser sacraments\". John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Church, held \"the validity of Anglican practice in his day as reflected in the 1662 \"Book of Common Prayer\"\", stating that \"We grant confession to men to be in many cases of use: public, in case of public scandal; private, to a spiritual guide for disburdening of the conscience, and as a help to repentance.\" \"The Book of Worship of The United Methodist Church\" contains the rite for private confession and absolution in \"A Service of Healing II\", in which the minister pronounces the words \"In the name of Jesus Christ, you are forgiven!\"; some Methodist churches have regularly scheduled auricular confession and absolution, while others make it available upon request. Since Methodism holds the office of the keys to \"belong to all baptized persons\", private confession does not necessarily need to be made to a pastor, and therefore lay confession is permitted, although this is not the norm. Near the time of death, many Methodists confess their sins and receive absolution from an ordained minister, in addition to being anointed. In Methodism, the minister is bound by the Seal of the Confessional, with \"The Book of Discipline\" stating \"All clergy of The United Methodist Church are charged to maintain all confidences inviolate, including confessional confidences\"; any confessor who divulges information revealed in confession is subject to being defrocked in accordance with canon law. As with Lutheranism, in the Methodist tradition, corporate confession is the most common practice, with the Methodist liturgy including \"prayers of confession, assurance and pardon\". The traditional confession of \"The Sunday Service\", the first liturgical text used by Methodists, comes from the service of Morning Prayer in \"The Book of Common Prayer\". The confession of one's sin is particularly important before receiving Holy Communion; the official United Methodist publication about the Eucharist titled \"This Holy Mystery\" states that:\n\nMany Methodists, like other Protestants, regularly practice confession of their sin to God Himself, holding that \"When we do confess, our fellowship with the Father is restored. He extends His parental forgiveness. He cleanses us of all unrighteousness, thus removing the consequences of the previously unconfessed sin. We are back on track to realise the best plan that He has for our lives.\"\n\nThe Lutheran Church teaches two key parts in repentance (contrition and faith). In mainstream Lutheranism, the faithful often receive the sacrament of penance from a Lutheran priest before receiving the Eucharist. Prior to going to Confessing and receiving Absolution, the faithful are expected to examine their lives in light of the Ten Commandments. The order of Confession and Absolution is contained in the Small Catechism, as well as other liturgical books of the Lutheran Churches. Lutherans typically kneel at the communion rails to confess their sins, while the confessor—a Lutheran priest—listens and then offers absolution while laying their stole on the penitent's head. Clergy are prohibited from revealing anything said during private Confession and Absolution per the Seal of the Confessional, and face excommunication if it is violated. In Laestadian Lutheranism penitent sinners, in accordance with the doctrine of the priesthood of all believers, practice lay confession, \"confess[ing] their transgressions to other church members, who can then absolve the penitent.\"\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church uses the term \"penance\" in a number of separate but related instances: (a) as a moral virtue, (b) as a sacrament, (c) as acts of satisfaction, and (d) as those specific acts of satisfaction assigned the penitent by the confessor in the context of the sacrament. These have as in common the concept that he who sins must repent and as far as possible make reparation to Divine justice.\n\nPenance is a moral virtue whereby the sinner is disposed to hatred of his sin as an offence against God and to a firm purpose of amendment and satisfaction. The principal act in the exercise of this virtue is the detestation of one's own sin. The motive of this detestation is that sin offends God. Theologians, following Thomas Aquinas (Summa III, Q. lxxxv, a. 1), regard penance as truly a virtue, though they have disagreed regarding its place among the virtues. Some have classed it with the virtue of charity, others with the virtue of religion, Bonaventure saw it as a part of the virtue of justice. Cajetan seems to have considered it as belonging to all three; but most theologians agree with Aquinas that penance is a distinct virtue (\"virtus specialis\").Penance as a virtue resides in the will. Since it is a part of the cardinal virtue of justice, it can operate in a soul which has lost the virtue of charity by mortal sin. However it cannot exist in a soul which has lost the virtue of faith, since without faith all sense of the just measure of the injustice of sin is lost. It urges the individual to undergo punishment for the sake of repairing the order of justice; when motivated by even an ordinary measure of supernatural charity it infallibly obtains the forgiveness of venial sins and their temporal punishments; when motivated by that extraordinary measure which is called perfect charity (love of God for his own sake) it obtains the forgiveness of even mortal sins, when it desires simultaneously to seek out the Sacrament of penance as soon as possible, and of large quantities of temporal punishment.\n\nPenance, while a duty, is first of all a gift. No man can do any penance worthy of God's consideration without His first giving the grace to do so. In penance is proclaimed mankind's unworthiness in the face of God's condescension, the indispensable disposition to God's grace. For though sanctifying grace alone forgives and purges sins from the soul, it is necessary that the individual consent to this action of grace by the work of the virtue of penance, Penance helps to conquer sinful habits and builds generosity, humility and patience. The following is a brief consideration of Our Lady's four requests: penance, prayer, devotion to her Immaculate Heart and the brown scapular. To those seeking help or in suffering please refer yourself through said means.\n\n\"\"The process of repentance and conversion\" was described by Jesus in the parable of prodigal son.\" In the Catholic Church, the sacrament of penance (also called reconciliation, forgiveness, confession and conversion) is one of the two sacraments of healing: Jesus Christ has willed that by this means the Church should continue, in the power of the Holy Spirit, his work of healing and salvation. Reconciliation with God is both the purpose and effect of this sacrament.\n\nThrough the priest who is the minister of the sacrament and who acts not in his own name but on behalf of God, confession of sins is made to God and absolution is received from God. In this sacrament, the sinner, placing himself before the merciful judgment of God, \"anticipates\" in a certain way, \"the judgment\" to which he will be subjected at the end of his earthly life.\n\nEssential to the sacrament are acts both by the sinner (examination of conscience, contrition with a determination not to sin again, confession to a priest, and performance of some act to repair the damage caused by sin) and by the priest (determination of the act of reparation to be performed and absolution). among the penitent's acts contrition holds first place. Serious sins (mortal sins) must be confessed within at most a year and always before receiving Holy Communion, while confession of venial sins also is recommended.\n\nThe act of penance or satisfaction that the priest imposes helps the penitent to overcome selfishness, to desire more strongly to live a holy life, to be closer to Jesus, and to show to others the love and compassion of Jesus. It is part of the healing that the sacrament brings. \"Sin injures and weakens the sinner himself, as well as his relations with God and neighbour. Absolution takes away sin, but it does not remedy all the disorders sin has caused. Raised up from sin, the sinner must still recover his full spiritual health by doing something more to make amends for the sin: he must 'make satisfaction for' or 'expiate' his sins.\" This is done by prayer, charity, or an act of Christian asceticism. The rite of the sacrament requires that \"the kind and extent of the satisfaction should be suited to the personal condition of each penitent so that each one may restore the order which he disturbed and through the corresponding remedy be cured of the sickness from which he suffered.\"\n\nIt may consist of prayer, works of mercy, service of neighbor, voluntary self-denial, sacrifices, \"and above all the patient acceptance of the cross we all must bear. Such penances help configure us to Christ, who alone expiated our sins once for all.\"\n\nIn the 1966 apostolic constitution \"Paenitemini\" Pope Paul VI said, \"Penance therefore—already in the Old Testament—is a religious, personal act which has as its aim love and surrender to God: fasting for the sake of God, not for one's own self... [The Church] reaffirms the primacy of the religious and supernatural values of penitence (values extremely suitable for restoring to the world today a sense of the presence of God and of His sovereignty over man and a sense of Christ and His salvation). In \"Paenitemini\" it is affirmed that \"[b]y divine law all the faithful are required to do penance.\" \"As from the fact of sin we Christians can claim no exception, so from the obligation to penance we can seek no exemption.\" Chapter 8 of the Didache enjoined Christians to fast every Wednesday and Friday.\n\nThe conversion of heart can be expressed in many ways. \"Scripture and the Fathers insist above all on three forms, \"fasting, prayer, and almsgiving\", which express conversion in relation to oneself, to God, and to others.\" Also mentioned are efforts at reconciliation with one's neighbor, and the practice of charity \"which covers a multitude of sins\" as in 1 Peter 4:8. “Taking up one’s cross each day and following Jesus is the surest way of penance.\"\n\nIn the Liturgical year, the seasons of Advent and Lent are particularly appropriate for penitential exercises such as voluntary self-denial and fraternal sharing. Under canon 1250 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law \"The penitential days and times in the universal Church are every Friday of the whole year and the season of Lent.\" Canon 1253 stated \"The conference of bishops can determine more precisely the observance of fast and abstinence as well as substitute other forms of penance, especially works of charity and exercises of piety, in whole or in part, for abstinence and fast.\"\n\nIn 2001 the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, in a document titled, “Penitential Practices for Today’s Catholics” reiterated their decision to allow U.S. Catholics to substitute another form of penance for abstinence from meat on the Fridays outside of Lent. While the document includes a list of suggested penitential practices, the selection of a Friday penance is left to the individual.\n\nIn 2011, Catholic bishops in England and Wales reversed their earlier decision to permit Catholics to practice a penance other than meat abstinence on Fridays. They said, in part: “The bishops wish to re-establish the practice of Friday penance in the lives of the faithful as a clear and distinctive mark of their own Catholic identity. … It is important that all the faithful be united in a common celebration of Friday penance. Note that the duty to perform the tasks of your state in life takes precedence over the law of fasting in the precepts of the Catholic Church. If fasting honestly causes one to be unable to fulfill his/her required tasks, it is uncharitable to fast — the law of fasting would not apply.\n\nMany acts of penance carry an indulgence, which may be applied in behalf of the souls departed. God alone knows what remains to be expiated. The Church in granting an indulgence to the living exercises her jurisdiction; over the dead she has no jurisdiction and therefore makes the indulgence available for them by way of suffrage (\"per modum suffragii\"), i.e. she petitions God to accept these works of satisfaction and in consideration thereof to mitigate or shorten the sufferings of the souls in Purgatory.\n\nIn some religions of Indian origin, acts of hardship committed on oneself (fasting, lying on rocks heated by the Sun, etc.), especially as part of an ascetic way of life (as monk or 'wise man') in order to attain a higher form of mental awareness (through detachment from the earthly, not punishing guilt) or favours from god(s) are considered penance. In Hinduism penance is widely discussed in Dharmasastra literature. In the Gita, there is a warning against excessive \"penance\" of a merely physical nature. There is the special term \"Tapas\", for intense concentration that is like a powerful fire, and this used to be sometimes translated as \"penance\", although the connotations are different.\n\nThe Indian spiritual teacher Meher Baba stated that \"When penance is carefully nourished and practiced, it inevitably results in the mental revocation of undesirable modes of thought and conduct, and makes one amenable to a life of purity and service.\"\n\nFilms:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1900779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1900779", "title": "Quattuor Abhinc Annos", "text": "Quattuor Abhinc Annos\n\nQuattuor abhinc annos (Latin for \"four years ago\") is the incipit of a letter that the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments sent on 3 October 1984 to presidents of episcopal conferences concerning celebration of Mass in the Tridentine form.\n\nThe letter explained that previously Pope John Paul II had invited comments from the bishops concerning the reception of the Missal promulgated in 1970 by authority of Pope Paul VI in accordance with the decisions of the Second Vatican Council, and any difficulties arising in the implementation of the liturgical reform. The Congregation subsequently granted diocesan bishops an indult to authorize specified priests and groups of the faithful who requested it, celebration of the Tridentine Mass according to the 1962 Roman Missal promulgated by Pope John XXIII. The permitted Tridentine Masses were to be in full accord with the 1962 Missal and in Latin.\n\nThis was not the first time that such an indult had been granted. With the promulgation of the Ordo Missae of 1970 Pope Paul VI gave permission to a large segment of priests in the United Kingdom to retain the usage of the Classical Roman Rite.\n\nAn important condition for granting the requests was \"that it be made publicly clear beyond all ambiguity that such priests and their respective faithful in no way share the positions of those who call in question the legitimacy and doctrinal exactitude of the Roman Missal promulgated by Pope Paul VI in 1970.\"\n\nDiocesan bishops refused many requests by people whom they considered not to have met this condition. But authorization was in fact granted either by diocesan bishops or directly by the Holy See to many priests, parishes and priestly societies, who could then use the older forms of the Roman Rite either exclusively or only on occasion. The priestly societies included the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter, the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest, and the Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney. These used the \"Tridentine\" liturgical books exclusively, not only for celebrating Mass but also for the other sacraments and rituals and for the Divine Office. Individual priests and communities belonging to religious institutes also received the same authorization. There were such cases among the Fraternity of Saint Vincent Ferrer, the Institute of Saint Philip Neri, the Canons Regular of the New Jerusalem, the Canons Regular of Saint John Cantius, the monasteries of Sainte Madeleine du Barroux and Sainte Marie de la Garde. Various diocesan clergy also availed of the document's provision. See Communities using the Tridentine Mass for a list of priestly societies and religious institutes which celebrate the Tridentine Mass.\n\nThe Pope further expanded upon this with the motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\" of 1988, in which he exhorted the bishops to be generous in granting such a faculty for all the faithful who requested it. \"Ecclesia Dei\" supersedes \"Quattuor abhinc annos\" regarding the extent of the privilege.\n\nGroups such as the Society of St. Pius X, who maintained that they needed no permission to celebrate the Tridentine Mass decried the document and referred rather derisively to Masses celebrated with the \"Quattuor abhinc annos\" authorization as \"Indult Masses\". Several of these groups, such as the Society of St. Pius V, preferred to celebrate Mass according to pre-1962 editions of the Roman Missal.\n\nThe view that use of the earlier form of the Roman liturgy had never been formally abrogated was authoritatively confirmed by Pope Benedict XVI, who declared that permission to use it (which can be granted by the priest in charge of the church) is required only for public celebration.\n\nPope Benedict XVI revoked the directives on 7 July 2007, replacing them with the norms enunciated in his motu proprio \"Summorum Pontificum\".\n\n"}

As backup Commander of the first manned Skylab mission in 1973, he was responsible for developing the hardware and procedures used by the first crew to perform critical in-flight repairs of the Skylab station. After Skylab, he served for a time as Director of User Affairs in NASA's Office of Applications.\n\nSchweickart left NASA in 1977 to serve for two years as California Governor Jerry Brown's assistant for science and technology, then was appointed by Brown to California's Energy Commission for five and a half years, serving as chairman for three.\n\nIn 1984–85 he co-founded the Association of Space Explorers and later in 2002 co-founded the B612 Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to defending Earth from asteroid impacts, along with fellow former astronaut Ed Lu and two planetary scientists. He served for a period as its chair before becoming its chair emeritus.\n\nRusty Schweickart was born October 25, 1935, in Neptune Township, New Jersey, and grew up on a \"hardscrabble\" farm of producing hay and vegetables plus raising poultry and cows. As a youth his ambition was to be a pilot and a cowboy. After graduating from Manasquan High School in 1952, he earned a B.S. in aeronautical engineering on scholarship (1956) and an M.S. in aeronautics and astronautics (1963) from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nHe was active in the Boy Scouts of America. He earned the rank of First Class. His hobbies include golf, bicycling, and hiking. He was married twice and has seven children.\n\nHis family's stated annual income when he received his Massachusetts Institute of Technology scholarship after graduating high school was listed as $1,800 (~$16,623 in 2017).\n\nSchweickart served in the U.S. Air Force and Massachusetts Air National Guard (101st Tactical Fighter Squadron) from 1956 to 1963, with over 4,000 hours of flight time, including 3,500 hours in high performance jet aircraft.\n\nPrior to joining NASA, Schweickart was a research scientist at the Experimental Astronomy Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and his work there involved research upper atmospheric physics, star tracking and stabilization of stellar images. His thesis for a master's degree at MIT concerned stratospheric radiance.\n\nSchweickart was chosen as part of NASA Astronaut Group 3 in October 1963. On March 21, 1966, he was named as the backup Pilot for Roger B. Chaffee on Apollo 1—which was to have been the first manned Apollo flight but was destroyed during a ground test accident. His fellow crewmen were backup Command Pilot James McDivitt and Senior Pilot David Scott, both veterans of Project Gemini. In December 1966, this crew was promoted to fly the first manned Earth orbital test of the Apollo Lunar Module (LM), with Schweickart as Lunar Module Pilot.\n\nApollo 9 was flown in March 1969. Schweickart spent just over 241 hours in space, and performed the first extravehicular activity (EVA) of the Apollo program, testing the Portable Life Support System that was later used by the 12 astronauts who walked on the Moon. The flight plan called for him to demonstrate an emergency transfer from the Lunar Module to the Command Module (CM) using handrails on the LM, but he began to suffer from space adaptation syndrome on the first day in orbit, forcing the postponement of the EVA.\n\nEventually he improved enough to perform a relatively brief EVA with his feet restrained on the LM \"porch\" (a platform used in transferring to the descent ladder), while Command Module Pilot Scott performed a stand-up EVA through the open hatch of the CM. During a five-minute pause tethered outside his spacecraft, Schweickart felt he underwent a metaphysical experience as he stared at the Earth, contemplating its place in the universe. He subsequently practiced Transcendental Meditation based on his experience.\n\nAlthough Deke Slayton (who was responsible for all flight assignments as Director of Flight Crew Operations) opined that Schweickart \"would have been a logical lunar module pilot\" on subsequent lunar missions—indeed, the standard rotation of the era would have placed him on the backup crew for Apollo 12 and the prime crew of Apollo 15 —\"that bout of space sickness had everybody worried... it didn't seem like a good idea to put him back in... at this point.\" Following his mission, Schweickart \"basically called the shot that I really didn't want to be assigned to a flight until we knew more about motion sickness\" and became \"[a] motion sickness guinea pig\" for six months; while \"[he] didn't learn that much\" during the testing, it is now accepted that as many as half of space travelers suffer from space adaptation syndrome to some extent.\n\nThe protracted testing period also contributed to Schweickart not being assigned to the Apollo 12 backup crew. When he returned to Houston, \"Al Shepard [Slayton's deputy], for whatever reason, instead of putting me back on Apollo, put me on to Skylab... Al had his own agenda of who went where and whatnot. So I cycled into\nSkylab at the time.\" Schweickart has also observed that he was \"not one of Al's boys,\" alluding to the political liberalism that he shared with his then-wife, Claire; Slayton felt that her fervent political stances (including civil rights activism) \"caused him a few problems with his colleagues.\" During this period, a Houston radio broadcaster characterized Schweickart as \"the closest thing to a freak astronaut\" after he was photographed escorting Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on a tour of NASA's headquarters.\n\nAlong with backup Science Pilot Story Musgrave and backup Pilot Bruce McCandless II, Schweickart was assigned as backup Commander of Skylab 2, the first manned American space station mission, which flew during the spring of 1973. Following the loss of the space station's thermal shield during launch, he assumed responsibility for the development of hardware and procedures for erecting an emergency solar shade and deploying a jammed solar array wing, operations that saved the space station.\n\nAfter serving on the support crew of Skylab 4, Schweickart was more interested in cultivating managerial skills than \"[going] over to the Space Shuttle development work which was under way... by that time, I had, you know, done a lot of work on Gemini in a support role, and then, of course, everything on Apollo, and now all of this on Skylab, and to go cycle back into the very beginning of the Space Shuttle, which was not going to fly for, at that point, something like six years and best guess of anybody in the business was maybe eight years, I figured, you know, another eight years of basically going to the same kinds of meetings, making the same kinds of decisions, going to the same places... it was like 'been there, done that.'\"\n\nWhile retaining his flight status, he was reassigned to NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. as Director of User Affairs in the Office of Applications in 1974. In this capacity, he was responsible for transferring NASA technology (primarily Landsat 1 applications) to the outside world and working with technology users (including the U.S. Department of Agriculture and water resources managers) to bring an understanding of their needs into NASA. He came to regard this as a \"thankless position\" and a \"very hard sell\" to potential clients due to their intrinsic resistance to new processes; this and the dearth of immediate flight opportunities ultimately precipitated his departure from NASA in 1977.\n\nSchweickart then served for two years as California governor Jerry Brown's assistant for science and technology before being appointed by Brown to the California Energy Commission for five and a half years.\n\nInspired by his friendship with Michael Murphy and involvement in the Esalen Institute's Soviet-American Exchange Program, Schweickart established the Association of Space Explorers (ASE) in 1984–85 along with cosmonauts Alexey Leonov, Vitaly Sevastyanov, and Georgi Grechko; the organization is open to all people who have flown in orbit around the Earth. He also chaired the ASE's near-Earth object committee, which produced a benchmark report and submitted it to the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UN COPUOS) on \"Asteroid Threats: A Call for Global Response\".\n\nSchweickart retired from ALOHA Networks, Inc. in 1998 where he served as President and Chief Executive Officer from 1996 through 1998. ALOHA was a data communications company specializing in high performance, wireless internet access equipment.\n\nSchweickart was formerly the Executive Vice President of CTA Commercial Systems, Inc. and Director of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Systems. Schweickart led CTA’s efforts in developing the GEMnet system, a second generation LEO communication satellite constellation designed to provide regular commercial electronic messaging services on a global basis. Prior to his CTA work, Schweickart founded and was President of Courier Satellite Services, Inc., a global satellite communications company which developed LEO satellites to provide worldwide affordable data services.\n\nSchweickart's satellite and telecommunications work involved him in the development of international communications regulations and policies, including participation in the 1992 and 1995 World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRC) of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). He served at the 1995 WRC as a U.S. delegate. He also worked extensively in Russia and the former Soviet Union on scientific and telecommunications matters.\n\nIn 2002 he co-founded the B612 Foundation along with fellow former-astronaut Ed Lu and two planetary scientists, also serving as its Chair. The B612 Foundation is a non-profit dedicated to defending Earth from asteroid impacts.\n\nIn May 2005 Schweickart testified before the U.S. Congress on the dangers of an asteroid impact related to 99942 Apophis. and in 2010 served as the co-chairman, along with astronaut Tom Jones, NASA's Advisory Council’s \"ad hoc\" Task Force on Planetary Defense. He has been an advocate of increasing NASA's annual budget by $250M–$300M over a 10 year period to more fully catalog the NEOs that can pose a threat to Earth and also provide a deflection capability.\n\nSchweickart has also spoken and taught at the Esalen Institute, and currently serves as the B612 Foundation's Chair Emeritus.\n\nSchweickart is a fellow of the American Astronautical Society and the International Academy of Astronautics, and an associate fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He is also an honorary trustee and a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences.\n\nHe was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal (1969) and the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale De la Vaulx Medal (1970) for his Apollo 9 flight. He also received the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Special Trustees Award (Emmy Award) in 1969 for transmitting the first live TV pictures from space. In 1973, Schweickart was also awarded the NASA Exceptional Service Medal for his leadership role in the Skylab rescue efforts. He was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1983 and the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997. Main-belt asteroid was named in his honor.\n\nIn 2012, Schweickart was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.\n\nIn the 1998 HBO miniseries \"From the Earth to the Moon\", Schweickart is portrayed by Kieran Mulroney. He also appeared in the television series \"The Universe\" in the episodes \"The End of the Earth: Deep Space Threats to Our Planet\" and \"Stopping Armageddon\".\n\n\n"}

The site now lies sunken, at the back of the Beach, and is surrounded by a lawn and hedges. The Temple is almost at sea level, and so is often flooded outside the summer months.\n\nThe inscriptions found on the ruins confirm that the site is the Temple of Apollo Zoster. Excavations were undertaken by the archaeologists K Kourouniotes and M Pittidis during 1926-7. This confirmed references in the ancient literary sources: Pausanias mentions that this was the location of the most important sanctuary of the deme of Aixōnídes Halaí (), in other words, the Saltfields of Aixōnē. This ancient deme included the modern areas of Voula and Vouliagmeni.\n\nThe Temple sits on the middle tongue of a three-tongued promontory which was once famously known in antiquity as Cape Zoster. Herodotus writes that, after the battle of Salamis, the Persians mistook the rocks of the headland for Greek ships.\n\nPausanias believed that in this location Leto, who was pregnant by Zeus, loosened her gilt belt, or zoster, as she was being chased by an angry Hera. Leto believed that she was about to give birth to the twins known as Apollo and Artemis.\n\nThe Temple was founded in the sixth century BC, the Archaic Period. It is of rectangular construction, 10.8m by 6.00m, and has a sekos and an adyton. The floor of the Temple \"is a unique and fine construction of big, rectangular slabs.\" \n\nThe sekos is separated from the adyton by a wall which was built in a later phase, in the fourth century BC. Inside the sekos are preserved:\n\n\nThe peristyle was added during the fourth century BC, comprising a colonnade around the temple, which consisted of four columns along the narrow sides of the Temple, and six columns along the longer side of the Temple.\n\nIn front of the Temple stands the base of a large rectangular altar measuring 4.25m by 2.25m. At the north-east end of the Temple is a square two-stepped base on which a votive statue probably stood.\n\nDuring the Christian period, after the Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire, the walls of the sekos were prolonged, some repairs took place, and the temple was transformed into a Christian church.\n\nThere is an attendant building of the same period, later enlarged, discovered in 1936 and comprising the priest’s house or a pilgrim’s hostel.\n\n"}

The numbering system is tabulated as below: \n\nClement only considers the first name of the person. Take the name ANNA as an example, it has 4 letters: A, N, N, and A, the its vibration is calculated as follows:\n\n\nThe next step is to find the numbers which are compatible with 3. According to Clement, the numbers are organised in three triads as below:\n\n\nSo, if a girl was born on the sixth or ninth day of a month, “Anna” will be a compatible name for her.\n"}

It was translated into English and published in 1985 under the name \"The Dhimmi: Jews and Christians Under Islam\".\n\nBat Ye'or argues that the category of the \"dhimmi\" is an inferior status and compares dhimmitude to the ill-treatment of minorities in Christian lands (Muslim and Jewish). The book also contends that the safety of dhimmis in Arab lands has been fragile and at constant risk for centuries. To bolster her case, Ye'or provides a selection of primary sources describing cruel treatment of non-Muslims by Muslims.\n\nIn the first part of the book, the author provides a historical survey of the effects and consequences that living under Islamic rule, or using the term coined here, in \"dhimmitude\", had on the Jewish and Christian communities in the Middle East.\n\nThe second part contains correspondence and testimonies from inside and outside observers over the centuries, including speeches from various influential Arabs, texts from various middle-age sources, and eyewitness reports by British consuls. Some of these were made available in European languages for the first time with the publication of the book. It also contains rare pictures and photographs depicting religious minority community under Islamic rule. Through these documents, Bat Ye'or gives her representation of the views of Islamic theologians and jurists on the treatment of non-Muslim populations in lands ruled by Muslims from the 7th century onwards.\n\nIn a 2006 review article discussing antisemitism in Muslim lands, Gudrun Krämer notes that in contrast to the \"white myth\" of continuous peaceful coexistence between different religious groups under Islamic rule, the portrayal offered in Ye'or's book is that of the \"black myth\". Krämer describes both positions as irrelevant.\n\nProfessor of Medieval Islamic history, David Waines, in a 1987 review of an English edition, writes that the \"portrait of the dhimmi, however, is executed in monochrome.\" If the book portrayed the actual situation, he notes, it would be \"inconceivable that the rich Judeo-Islamic cultural tradition of the middle ages could ever have been created.\" He also strongly criticises what he perceives as a bias in the selection of primary sources and its political aims in undermining Palestinian Arab claims to land rights.\n\nReviewing the English edition of the book for \"The Jewish Quarterly Review\" in 1986, Leon Nemoy, curator of Hebrew and Arabic literature at Yale's Sterling Memorial Library, wrote that while one might disagree \"here and there\" with the major thesis propounded by Bat Ye'or, it cannot be dismissed as \"a pack of lies\" since her documented evidence comes from \"highly reliable testimonies\".\n\nAllan Harris Cutler and Hellen Cutler reviewed the book in 1985 and wrote that it is a \"documentary history of Islamic antagonism toward Christians and Jews.\" They also note that more positive views of the relationship between Muslims and dhimmis exist among authoritative scholars.\n\nPaul Fenton, while reviewing the French edition of the book and another book by Norman A. Stillman (\"The Jews of Arab Lands: A History and Source Book\") in 1981, noticed that \"The need for a serious and objective source book on the history of the Jews in Arab lands untainted by ideological options, has long been felt by students of Middle Eastern history. The two titles under review both respond to this need albeit in quite different, if not complementary, manners.\"\n\n"}

He appears to have met Captain John Smith during Smith's time in Virginia, since Smith says that in London they \"renewed their acquaintance\". His wife, Matachanna, was Pocahontas's half-sister. \n\nTomocomo must have been trusted by Chief Powhatan, as Powhatan requested him to accompany her in order to count the number of people in England. Arriving at Plymouth, Tomocomo picked up a stick on which to mark notches to keep a tally, but soon grew \"weary of that task\". Powhatan also asked him to discover whether Smith was still alive (the Powhatan natives had been told that Smith was dead, but, as Pocahontas told Smith \"your countrymen will lie much\").\n\nSamuel Purchas, a compiler of travel narratives, met Tomocomo at the home of \"my good friend Doctor Goldstone, where he was a frequent guest, and where I have both seen him sing and dance his diabolical measures, and heard him discourse of his country and religion.\" Purchas believed that the Powhatan people were devil-worshippers and tried to persuade Tomocomo to take up Christianity, but Tomocomo said he was too old to learn new ways.\n\nPocahontas and Tomocomo were never given a formal audience before King James. However, on January 5, 1617 they were brought before the King at the Banqueting House in Whitehall Palace, at a performance of Ben Jonson's masque \"The Vision of Delight\". However, according to Smith, Tomocomo did not realize who they had met until it was explained to him afterward. Tomocomo was disappointed that the King did not offer a present, saying to Smith \"You gave Powhatan a white dog, which Powhatan fed as himself, but your King gave me nothing, and I am better than your white dog.\"\n\nWhen Tomocomo returned to Virginia with Samuel Argall and Rolfe in March 1617, he reportedly uttered diatribes (poor remarks) \"against England, English people\" and against Thomas Dale, governor of Jamestown. The colonists rebutted his claims in front of the Powhatan leaders, and Tomocomo apparently was disgraced. However, Chief Powhatan died the next year, and his successor, Opechancanough, began planning a massive attack on the settlers. Nothing more is known of Tomocomo's life. \n\nPaul O'Connor voiced him in the Animated Hero Classics 1994 episode \"Pocahontas\". O' Connor also voiced Japazaws who lured the princess with a copper kettle to her abduction by Argall. \n\nHe was voiced by Brad Garrett in Disney's 1998 direct-to-video film \"\". At the end, he remained in London with John Rolfe's maid, Mrs. Jenkins. \n\nIn the 2005 film \"The New World\", Tomocomo is played by Raoul Trujillo. However, in the film's depiction of Pocahontas's trip to England, she is accompanied by her uncle Opechancanough rather than Tomocomo.\n"}

It is held that Tonpa Shenrab first studied the Bon doctrine in Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring, at the end of which he pledged to Shenlha Okar, the god of compassion, that he would guide the peoples of this world to liberation.\n\nLike Gautama, Tönpa Shenrab was of royal birth. Tonpa Shenrab renounced his royal inheritance at the age of thirty-one to travel the path to enlightenment. Tonpa Shenrab embraced the life of a renunciate and commenced austerities, spreading the doctrine of Bon; at length, he arrived in the land of Zhangzhung near what is widely held to be Mount Kailash.\n\nAccounts of Tonpa Shenrab's life are to be found in three principal sources, the \"Dodü\" (), \"Zermik\" (), and \"Ziji\" (). The first and second of the accounts are held to be terma discovered by tertön in the 10th or 11th century; the third is part of the oral lineage () transmitted from teacher to disciple.\n\nThe doctrines taught by Tönpa Shenrab are generally classified variously, two being most common. In the first, The Four Portals and the Fifth, the Treasury (\"sgo bzhi mdzod lnga\"), the: \n\nThe second classification, the Nine Ways of Bon (\"bon theg pa rim dgu\") is as follows—the:\n\nThe nine ways can also be classified into three groups, the: \n\nThe Bon canon comprises more than two hundred volumes, classified in four categories: the Sutras (\"mdo\"), the Perfection of Wisdom Teachings (\"'bum\"), the Tantras (\"rgyud\") and Knowledge (\"mdzod\"). Besides these, the Bon canon includes material on rituals, arts and crafts, logic, medicine, poetry and narrative. The \"Knowledge\" section concerning cosmogony and cosmology, though in some respects unique to Bon, shares a more than passing resemblance to Nyingma (\"rnying ma\") doctrines.\n\nShenrab Miwoche is said to have three aspects or forms: the tulku () or nirmaṇakāya, Shenrab Miwoche; the \"dzokku\" () or sambhogakāya, Shenlha Okar and the \"bönku\" () or dharmakāya, Tapihritsa.\n\n\nSPHERIC Multimédia 2003. ©[spheric@magic.fr] \n"}
{"id": "2016905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2016905", "title": "Werecat", "text": "Werecat\n\nA werecat (also written in a hyphenated form as were-cat) is an analogy to \"werewolf\" for a feline therianthropic creature.\n\nAiluranthropy comes from the Greek words \"ailouros\" meaning \"cat\", and \"anthropos\", meaning \"human\" and refers to human/feline transformations, or to other beings that combine feline and human characteristics. Its root word is also used in ailurophobia, the most common term for a phobia of cats.\n\nAiluranthrope is a lesser-known term that refers to a feline therianthrope.\n\nDepending on the story in question, the species involved can be a domestic cat, a tiger, a lion, a leopard, a lynx, or any other type, including some that are purely mythical felines.\n\nEuropean folklore usually depicts werecats as people who transform into domestic cats. Some European werecats became giant domestic cats or panthers. They are generally labelled witches, even though they may have no magical ability other than self-transformation. During the witch trials, all shapeshifters, including werewolves, were considered witches whether they were male or female.\n\nAfrican legends describe werelions, werepanthers or wereleopards. In the case of leopards, this is often because the creature is really a leopard deity masquerading as a human. When these gods mate with humans, offspring can be produced, and these children sometimes grow up to be shapeshifters; those who do not transform may instead have other powers. In reference to werecats who turn into lions, the ability is often associated with royalty. Such a being may have been a king or queen in a former life, or may be destined for leadership. This quality can be seen in the lions of Tsavo, which were reputed to be kings in lion shape, attempting to repel the invading Europeans by stopping their railroad with attacks on humans. The ancient myths spanned north Africa to west Africa.\n\nIt has been said that the werecat's family are those who have been clawed or looked in the eye by a sphinx. They can also be infected by a normal cat, though very rarely.\n\nMainland Asian werecats usually become tigers. In India, the weretiger is often a dangerous sorcerer, portrayed as a menace to livestock, who might at any time turn to man-eating. These tales travelled through the rest of India and into Persia through travellers who encountered the royal Bengal tigers of India and then further west. Chinese legends often describe weretigers as the victims of either a hereditary curse or a vindictive ghost. Ancient teachings held that every race except the Han Chinese were really animals in disguise, so that there was nothing extraordinary about some of these false humans reverting to their true natures. Alternatively, the ghosts of people who had been killed by tigers could become a malevolent supernatural being known as \"Chang\", (伥) devoting all their energy to making sure that tigers killed more humans. Some of these ghosts were responsible for transforming ordinary humans into man-eating weretigers. Also, in Japanese folklore there are creatures called bakeneko that are similar to kitsune (fox spirits) and tanuki (raccoon dogs). In Thailand a tiger that eats many humans may become a weretiger. There are also other types of weretigers, such as sorcerers with great powers who can change their form to become animals.\n\nIn both Indonesia and Malaysia there is another kind of weretiger, known as Harimau jadian. In Malaysia, Bajangs have been described as vampiric or demonic werecats. In the central area of the Indonesian island of Java the power of transformation is regarded as due to inheritance, to the use of spells, to fasting and willpower, to the use of charms, etc. Save when it is hungry or has just cause for revenge it is not hostile to man; in fact, it is said to take its animal form only at night and to guard the plantations from wild pigs. Variants of this belief assert that the shapeshifter does not recognize his friends unless they call him by name, or that he goes out as a mendicant and transforms himself to take vengeance on those who refuse him alms. Somewhat similar is the belief of the Khonds; for them the tiger is friendly, and he reserves his wrath for their enemies. A man is said to take the form of a tiger in order to wreak a just vengeance.\n\nThe foremost were-animal in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures was the were-jaguar. It was associated with the veneration of the jaguar, with priests and shamans among the various peoples who followed this tradition wearing the skins of jaguars to \"become\" a were-jaguar. Among the Aztecs, an entire class of specialized warriors who dressed in the jaguar skins were called \"jaguar warriors\" or \"jaguar knights\". Depictions of the jaguar and the were-jaguar are among the most common motifs among the artifacts of the ancient Mesoamerican civilizations. \n\nN.W. Thomas wrote in the 11th ed. of the \"Encyclopaedia Britannica\" (1911) that according to Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius (1794–1868), the \"kanaima\" was a human being who employed poison to carry out his function of blood avenger, and that other authorities represent the \"kanaima\" as a jaguar, which was either an avenger of blood or the familiar of a cannibalistic sorcerer. He also mentioned that in 1911 some Europeans in Brazil believed that the seventh child of the same sex in unbroken succession becomes a were-man or woman, and takes the form of a horse, goat, jaguar or pig.\n\nIn the US, urban legends tell of encounters with feline bipeds; beings similar to the Bigfoot having cat heads, tails, and paws. Feline bipeds are sometimes classified as part of cryptozoology, but more often they are interpreted as werecats.\n\nAssertions that werecats truly exist and have an origin in supernatural or religious realities have been common for centuries, with these beliefs often being hard to entirely separate from folklore. In the 19th century, occultist J. C. Street asserted that material cat and dog transformations could be produced by manipulating the \"ethereal fluid\" that human bodies are supposedly floating in. The Catholic witch-hunting manual, the \"Malleus Maleficarum\", asserted that witches can turn into cats, but that their transformations are illusions created by demons. New Age author John Perkins asserted that every person has the ability to shapeshift into \"jaguars, bushes, or any other form\" by using mental power. Occultist Rosalyn Greene claims that werecats called \"cat shifters\" exist as part of a \"shifter subculture\" or underground New Age religion based on lycanthropy and related beliefs.\n\nWerecats are increasingly featured in popular culture, although not as often as werewolves.\n\nBy far the most prevalent occurrence of werecats in pop culture is in books. Some novels, novellas, and short stories with werecats are listed below.\n\n\nWerecats also serve as heroes and villains in film and television shows. Notable examples include:\n\n\nComic books, manga, and anime are other venues for werecats.\n\nWerecats have been featured in a number of games, both video and table-top.\n\n"}
