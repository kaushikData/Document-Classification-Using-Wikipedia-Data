He launched several campaigns in Hazarajat due to resistance from the Hazaras in which his forces committed atrocities. The southern part of Hazarajat was spared as they accepted his rule, while the other parts of Hazarajat rejected Abdur Rahman and instead supported his uncle, Sher Ali Khan. In response to this Abdur Rahman waged a war against tribal leaders who rejected his policies and rule. Abdur Rahman arrested Syed Jafar, chief of the Sheikh Ali Hazara tribe, and jailed him in Mazar-e-Sharif. \n\nThe first Hazara uprising against Abdur Rahman Khan took place between 1888 and 1890. When Emir Abdur Rahman's cousin, Mohammad Eshaq, revolted against him, tribal leaders of the Sheikh Ali Hazaras joined the revolt. The revolt was short lived as the Emir extended his control over large parts of Hazarajat.\n\nAfter all of Sheikh Ali Hazaras' chiefs were sent to Kabul, opposition within the leadership of Sawar Khan and Syed Jafar Khan continued against the government troops, but at last were defeated. Taxes were imposed and Afghan administrators were sent to occupied places, where they subjugated the people with abuses. People were disarmed, villages were looted, local tribal chiefs were imprisoned or executed, and the better lands were confiscated and given to Afghan nomads (Kuchis).\n\nThe second uprising occurred in the Spring of 1892. According to Syed Askar Mousavi, the cause of the uprising was an assault on the wife of a Hazara Chieftain by Afghan soldiers. The families of both the man and his wife, deciding that death was one hundred times better than such humiliation, killed the soldiers involved and attacked the local garrison, from whence they recovered their confiscated arms\". Several other tribal chiefs who supported Abdur Rahman now turned against him and joined the rebellion which rapidly spread through the entire Hazarajat. In response to the rebellion, the Emir declared a \"jihad\" against the Shias and raised an army of up to 40, 000 soldiers, 10, 000 mounted troops, and 100,000 armed civilians (most of which were Pashtun nomads). He also brought in British military advisers to assist his army.\n\nThe third uprising of Hazara was in response to the harsh repression; the Hazara revolted again by early 1893. This revolt took the government forces by surprise and the Hazara managed to take most of Hazarajat back. However, after months of fighting, they were eventually defeated due to a shortage of food. Small pockets of resistance continued to the end of the year as government troops committed atrocities against civilians and deported entire villages.\n\nAbdur Rahman's subjugation of the Hazara due to fierce rebellion against the Afghan king gave birth to strong hatred between the Pahstun and Hazara for years to come. Massive forced displacements, especially in Oruzgan and Daychopan, continued as lands were confiscated and populations were expelled or fled. Some 35,000 families fled to northern Afghanistan, Mashhad (Iran) and Quetta (Pakistan). Hazara farmers were often forced to give up their property to Pashtuns and as a result many Hazara families had to leave seasonally to the major cities in Afghanistan, Iran, or Pakistan in order to find jobs and a source of income. Quetta in Pakistan is home to the third largest settlements of Hazara outside Afghanistan.\n\n"}

The petition noted the exceptional artistic and cultural heritage of the Tridentine liturgy, and was signed by many prominent non-Catholic figures in British society, including Agatha Christie, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Kenneth Clark, Robert Graves, F. R. Leavis, Cecil Day-Lewis, Nancy Mitford, Iris Murdoch, Yehudi Menuhin, Joan Sutherland and two Anglican bishops, those of Exeter and of Ripon.\n\nJohn Cardinal Heenan approached Pope Paul VI and asked that use of the Tridentine Mass be permitted. On 5 November 1971, the Pope granted the request. Between then and the granting of the worldwide \"universal indult\" in 1984, the bishops of England and Wales were authorized to grant permission for the occasional celebration of Mass in the old form, with the modifications introduced in 1965 and 1967.\n\nEnglish Roman Catholics had a particular attachment to the Tridentine Mass, as the Mass which had been celebrated by the English Martyrs of the Reformation and by priests in the years in which Catholicism had been subjected to sometimes severe persecution. The indult acquired its nickname by virtue of a story told about the Pope's acceptance of the petition:The story is that Pope Paul read through the letter in silence then suddenly exclaimed, \"Ah, Agatha Christie!\" and then signed it. Though not a Catholic at the time, Christie rejected the 20th century rite as the desecration of the historic church that it was. The indult was granted in 1971. Ever since it has been known informally as \"the Agatha Christie indult\".\n\nOften misunderstood is the fact that the indult itself did not refer to the 1962 Liturgy, but the revisions of 1965, with the incorporation of the revisions of \"Tres abhinc annos\" in 1967.\n\nThe text of the indult itself reads as follows:\n\nSacra Congregatio pro Cultu Divino\nE Civitate Vaticana,\ndie 5 Novembre 1971\nProt. N. 1897/71\n\nYour Eminence,\n\nHis Holiness Pope Paul VI, by letter of 30 October 1971, has given special faculties to the undersigned Secretary of this Sacred Congregation to convey to Your Eminence, as Chairman of the Episcopal Conference of England and Wales, the following points regarding the Order of the Mass:\n\n1. Considering the pastoral needs referred to by Your Eminence, it is permitted to the local Ordinaries of England and Wales to grant that certain groups of the faithful may on special occasions be allowed to participate in the Mass celebrated according to the Rites and texts of the former Roman Missal. The edition of the Missal to be used on these occasions should be that published again by the Decree of the Sacred Congregation of Rites (27 January 1965), and with the modifications indicated in the Instructio altera (4 May 1967).\n\nThis faculty may be granted provided that groups make the request for reasons of genuine devotion, and provided that the permission does not disturb or damage the general communion of the faithful. For this reason the permission is limited to certain groups on special occasions; at all regular parish and other community Masses, the Order of the Mass given in the new Roman Missal should be used. Since the Eucharist is the sacrament of unity, it is necessary that the use of the Order of Mass given in the former Missal should not become a sign or cause of disunity in the Catholic community. For this reason agreement among the Bishops of the Episcopal Conference as to how this faculty is to be exercised will be a further guarantee of unity of praxis in this area.\n\n2. Priests who on occasion wish to celebrate Mass according to the above-mentioned edition of the Roman Missal may do so by consent of their Ordinary and in accordance with the norms given by the same. When these priests celebrate Mass with the people and wish to use the rites and texts of the former Missal, the conditions and limits mentioned above for celebration by certain groups on special occasions are to be applied.\n\nWith my highest respects, I am\n\nYours sincerely in Christ,\n\nA.

In scripture, the expression \"ahurani\" appears both in the singular and in the plural, and may - subject to context - either denote a specific divinity named Ahurani, or a class of divinities that are \"ahurani\"s.\n\nThe Avestan feminine suffix \"-ani\" denotes \"companion, wife, mate\", hence \"ahurani\" means \"partner of \"ahura\".\" The \"ahura\" of the name may or may not be a reference to Ahura Mazda or to the other Ahuras. Following recent scholarship (see Ahura for details), it is now generally supposed that there was once been a divinity whose proper name was *Ahura, and from whom the various \"ahura\"s of the Avesta receive this epithet.\n\nIn the \"Yasna Haptanghaiti\", the \"ahurani\"s are invoked in the plural, as \"companions of the \"ahura\".\" In these verses of great antiquity and linguistically as old as the Gathas, they are also said to be \"created by Ahura Mazda\" (\"Yasna\" 38.4).\n\nIn the Younger Avesta, the expression appears in the singular: Ahurani bears gifts of health, prosperity, renown, and for the well-being of the soul (\"Yasna\" 68.3-4). In \"Yasna\" 68.11, the devotee asks Ahurani for a long life and a welcome in the radiant abode of the righteous (i.e. paradise, cf. \"ashavan\").\n\nIn \"Yasna\" 68, which is a \"hidden\" (since not explicitly dedicated to them) \"Yasht\", the \"\"ahuric\" one of (the) Ahura,\" appears to represent water in all its variations: rivers, wells, lakes, seas, snow and rain (\"Yasna\" 68.6). As such, the single divinity appears to be synonymous with the \"*apas\", the group of Indo-Iranian divinities of the waters.\n\nIn other verses, the waters are themselves revered as the \"ahurani\"s (\"Yasna\" 38.3). The \"ahurani\"s enlighten thought, speech and actions (\"Yasna\" 68.4). This is in line with the Indo-Iranian tradition of identifying water with wisdom (Avestan: \"mazda\"). The \"ahurani\"s as described as bringers of fertility and peace. In \"Yasna\" 68.1-2 (cf. Ab-Zohr, \"offering to water\"), the celebrant priest offers the \"ahurani\"s a libation of milk and butter (representing animal creation).\n\nAhurani(s) are not included in any list of yazatas, nor do they/does she have a day-name dedication in the Zoroastrian calendar. This may be because in later Zoroastrianism Aredvi Sura Anahita dominates as divinity of the waters, and it is to her that the hymn to the waters (the \"Aban Yasht\") is dedicated.\n\nThere appear to be historic parallels between the Avestan \"ahurani\"s and the RigVedic \"varunani\"s, the \"wives of Varuna.\" These parallels are one of the points of comparison for the theory that Ahura Mazda and Varuna both descend from a common predecessor (see Ahura Mazda for details).\n\n"}

Like other parts of the world where people of Indian origin are settled, the teachings of Swami Dayanand Saraswati, founder of the Arya Samaj, made their way to South Africa during the beginning of the twentieth century. The Arya Samaj encouraged Indian South Africans to take pride in their heritage and culture and promoted education and social reform.\n\nBhai Parmanand, the first Arya Samaj missionary to arrive in South Africa, arrived on 5 August 1905. During his four-month stay, he travelled to Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town. He was a dynamic orator in both English and Hindi and was received with enthusiasm by the local Indian community, including Mahatma Gandhi. He delivered discourses on Hindu culture, religion, Indian civilisation, faith in God, ceremonies, the importance of the mother tongue and education. He emphasised the importance and significance of festivals and since then \"Deepavali\" has come to be recognised as a festival of Hindus. He established grassroots Arya Samaj committees to consolidate Hinduism amongst the Indians, established the Hindu Reform Society of Durban and the Hindu Young Men's Association in Pietermaritzburg and motivated the formation of the \"Hindu Maha Sabha\", an organisation bringing together the diverse Hindu groups under one banner.\n\nSwami Shankaranand, who arrived in South Africa on 4 October 1908, urged Hindus to have pride in their religion and stressed the importance of religious lectures, rites and the study of Indian vernaculars. He succeeded in making Deepavali, the birth of Lord Rama and the birth of Lord Krishna important dates in the Hindu calendar. He founded Veda Dharma Sabhas in Durban and Pietermaritzburg but his greatest contribution was the establishment of the \"Hindu Maha Sabha\" in 1912.\n\nThe first locally born Arya Samaj activist was Pundit Bhawani Dayal, who returned from India at the age of twenty in 1912. He preached the Vedic religion and pioneered the propagation of Hindi in South Africa. He and his wife, involved themselves in Gandhi's \"satyagraha\" and were both imprisoned. In 1916, he organised a Hindi literary conference in Ladysmith and was the editor of two local Hindi language newspapers.\n\nAnother preacher, Swami Mangalanand Puri, came to Natal in 1913. He delivered lectures under the auspices of the \"Arya Yuvak Sabha\" and proved to be an eloquent Hindi orator. During his time, he attracted many young men who joined the Arya Samaj. In 1921 Pundit Ishwardutt Vedalankar, a graduate of Gurukul Kangadi (in India), came to Natal under the banner of the \"Arya Yuvak Sabha\". As an eloquent speaker he attracted large audiences of all faiths. He concentrated on the correct performance of religious ceremonies and drew large crowds at \"Ramayan\" recitals.\n\nBy the beginning of the 1920s, a number of Arya Samajs had been established in Natal. Under the guidance of D.G. Satyadeva, the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha in Natal was established on 22 February 1925, with its headquarters in Durban. The first officials elected were Pt Bhawani Dayal (President), B A Maghrajh (Secretary), P R Pather (assist Secretary), and R K Kaptain (Treasurer). Two years later on 23 October 1927, the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha, Natal, was to affiliated to the Sarvadeshik Arya Pratinidhi Sabha (International Arya League).\n\nThe aims of Arya Pratinidhi Sabha (SA) are to encourage the establishment, organisation and consolidation of Arya Samajs and Vedic institutions in South Africa, elucidate the tenets of Arya Samaj and to foster these principles in the country, disseminate Vedic religion and philosophy, promote the art, culture and civilisation of India, encourage and advocate the study of Hindi and other Indian languages, protect and defend the rights of Hindus and to concern itself with their spiritual, moral and social upliftment, and to co-operate with other Hindu organisations on matters affecting the Hindu Community.\n\nMany learned Vedic scholars and highly trained preachers visited South Africa under the auspices of the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha to promote Vedic Culture. These included: \n\nThe Veda Niketan concentrates on the dissemination of the Vedic religion by means of publication of literature and production of any material e.g. cassettes - audio and video, compact discs, software, websites and conducts a series of graded examinations on Hindu Dharma.\n\nThe Vedic Purohit Mandal (Academy of Vedic Priests) conducts systematic classes for the training of priests regardless of caste, creed, gender or colour. The Mandal enjoys a large membership of women priests.\n\nArya Samaj has always encouraged the teaching of Hindi. In 1925, an organisation for the promotion of Hindi within the Arya Samaj, the \"Hindi Siksha Sangh\" (Hindi Education Union) was established. The Sangh established a uniform syllabus, conducted Hindi classes and wrote examinations.\n\n"}

The first Bahá'í to pioneer to Madagascar arrived in 1953 and following native converts the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1955. By 1963 in addition to the one assembly there were groups of Bahá'ís living in four other locations. In late July 1967 Rúhíyyih Khanum became the first Hand of the Cause to visit the country. In 1972 the Malagasy Bahá'ís gathered to elect the first National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Madagascar. By 2003 there were 33 local assemblies and the Association of Religion Data Archives in 2005 estimated there were about 17,900 Bahá'ís in the country.\n\nThough a Bahá'í was in nearby Mauritius in 1910 the first mention of Madagascar in the literature of the Bahá'í Faith was in a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States and Canada in 1916-1917 by `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, who asked the followers of the religion to travel to regions of Africa; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The publication was delayed until 1919 in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919. after the end of World War I and the Spanish flu.\n\nO that I could travel, even though on foot and in the utmost poverty, to these regions, and, raising the call of “Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá” in cities, villages, mountains, deserts and oceans, promote the divine teachings! This, alas, I cannot do. How intensely I deplore it! Please God, ye may achieve it.…. Similarly, if possible, they should travel to the continent of Africa, (islands like) Mauritius, etc., and in those countries summon the people to the Kingdom of God and raise the cry of “Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá!” They must also upraise the flag of the oneness of the world of humanity in the island of Madagascar.\n\nIn 1953 Shoghi Effendi, head of the religion after the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá, planned an international teaching plan to systematically implement the goals outlined termed the Ten Year Crusade. The first Bahá'í to pioneer to Madagascar arrived in 1953 when Meherangiz Munsiff, an Asian Indian arrived from Britain. She was able to stay through the hospitality of a local Muslim family and later with the Robert family, of Tananarive (now Antananarivo), who were among the first to become Bahá'ís in Madagascar and who later played an outstanding role in the history of the religion here. Suffering ill health, Munsiff left in January 1954 a day after Danile Randrianarivo, 29, joined the religion, becoming the first Malagasy Bahá'í. Jalal Nakhjavani, brother of Ali Nakhjavani, was elected to the first National Spiritual Assembly of Central and East Africa in 1954. It was at this time that he made extensive teaching trips visiting the islands of Zanzibar, Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion and the Comoro Islands. In 1955 the first Assembly of Madagagar was elected. By May 1955 five introductory pamphlets on the religion were published by the British Baha'i Publishing Trust in the Malagasy language. In April 1956 the religion was present in small numbers across 15 countries of southern Africa including islands. To administer the Bahá'í communities across southern Africa a regional governing body was elected based in South Africa to cover them all called the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of South & West Africa in 1956.\n\nIn March 1960 the islands of Mauritius and Madagascar were swept by cyclone Carol. In both places some of the Bahá'ís lost their homes, but it is reported they still kept the Nineteen Day Fast and to hold their meetings, often in the open air. One community in Madagascar held a Nineteen Day Feast during the cyclone, with only three absentees. In June Madagascar gained independence from France.\n\nBy 1963 there was still one Bahá'í assembly in the country - in Antananarivo - but groups of Bahá'ís lived in Ambohimanga, Juan de Nova Island, Mangatany, Nosy Be Island.\n\nIn 1966 Arthur J. Gustave Ruggoo pioneered to the Seychelles for several years but occasionally he would undertake special projects promulgating the religion in Réunion and Madagascar.\n\nIn late July 1967 Hand of the Cause Rúhíyyih Khanum, the first to visit Madagascar spent several days there as part of a trip through the Islands of the Indian Ocean basin. Counter to most of her trips she spent the whole period in the city - Tananarive, the capital, because of the 10 days she spent in Madagascar she was taking bed rest for five days. Nevertheless, of her five active days she spoke at nine gatherings.\n\nIn 1969 a youth committee was organized and operating in the country. In July 1970 Hand of the Cause Rahmatu'lláh Muhájir visited the island consulting with its institutions and participating in events.\n\nIn 1972 the first national convention was gathered to elect the first National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Madagascar and Hand of the Cause Rahmatu'lláh Muhájir represented the Universal House of Justice at the proceedings.\n\nIn March 1977 a regional conference on the progress of the religion on the island was held in Manakara.\n\nA Bahá'í refugee from the Persecution of Bahá'ís in Iran, Martha Sobhani, left Iran in 1978. She moved to Madagascar to work with Bahá'í youth and fell in love with her future husband, a native of Mauritius. In November 1979, the Bahá'ís of Tananarive hosted a conference in celebration of Universal Children's Day. The proceedings were chaired by an 11-year-old pre-youth. Long time Bahá'í Seewoosumbur Jeehoba Appa of Mauritius died in 1981 when he accompanied Continental Counsellor Shídán Fath-i-A'zam to Madagascar. In Sept-Oct 1983 twenty-one Malagasy Bahá'í volunteers took part in trips following three regional institutes on the religion.\n\nSince its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.\n\nIn September 10–15, 1986 Bahá'í youth participated in a national Youth Fair in Antananarivo and won first prize for their display and second prize for their musical event at this fair, whose theme was \"Youth, Peace and Development.\" From April 1989 Bahá'ís in several communities organized a campaign to engage the awareness of governmental and neighborhood leaders with the religion. At these meetings books were presented and the Bahá'ís described ways they had engaged in socio-economic development projects and asked what more they could do. Displays on the religion were set up and invitations were sent out for neighbors to attend prayer meetings at local Bahá'í centers. These events resulted in some 700 people joining the religion in a year's time.\n\nAt the 2003 50th anniversary of the arrival of the religion on the island celebrations were held and two ministers from the Malagasy government gave speeches praising the religion for its teachings of universal unity and peace. The media covered the events. Several newspapers published articles about the events, and the national television channel covered the closing ceremony.\n\nBy 2003 there were 33 local assemblies. The Association of Religion Data Archives in 2005 estimated about 17,900 (0.1% of the national population) Bahá'ís in the country.\n\n\n"}

It is given to married or engaged couples. Through it, members of the Unification Church believe that the couple is removed from the lineage of sinful humanity and engrafted into God’s sinless lineage. As a result, the couple’s marital relationship—and any children born after the Blessing—exist free from the consequences of original sin. (Children born into Blessed Central Families are known as Blessed Children or second generation, third generation, etc.)\n\nFor Unificationists, these interracial, interreligious and international mass marriage ceremonies symbolize the family as the hope for peace. The Blessing ceremony has become the most famous ritual of the Unification Church. The men and women who receive the Blessing are called \"Blessed Central Families\" who are conducive to the establishment of Cheon Il Guk (the Kingdom of Heaven.)\n\nFrank Kaufmann, a leading Unificationist scholar, wrote:\n\nWe do not have mass weddings because Reverend Moon doesn't know any better, doesn't know how Americans react to things, or that he stubbornly adheres to some odd Korean habit. Our matchings and weddings are a direct and perfect manifestation of a profound theology and world view. You see, Unificationists believe that all the problems on Earth, from the Gulf War, to child abuse, to the crumbling school system (you name it) are fruits of the fact that self-interest crept into the family, the love between husband and wife, reproductive affairs, and parent-child relationships, thus since the beginning there has never been even one family whose members were not dominated by some significant degree of self-interest.\n\nScholars have noted the Blessing ceremony allows Unification Church members to express their belief in an international, inter-racial \"family of God.\"\nIn the words of the Reverend Moon, he once described the meaning of the Marriage Blessing:\n\nThen what is the ultimate reason why we need to do it? It is because our human ancestors fell. If our first ancestors had not fallen, it would not be necessary for us to receive the Blessing. But we have to reverse the fallen process. We have no other way to return to God's realm of authority than through a course that restores the fall. That is why human beings until now have pursued religion, for this is the direction and purpose of human history.\n\nThe Blessing ceremony was first held in 1961 for 36 couples in Seoul, South Korea by Sun Myung Moon and his wife Hak Ja Han, shortly after their own marriage in 1960. All the couples were members of the Unification Church. Moon matched all of the couples except the 12 who were already married to each other from before joining the church, which was officially founded in 1954.\n\nLater Blessing ceremonies were larger in scale but followed the same pattern with all participants Unification Church members and Moon matching most of the couples. In 1982 the first large scale Blessing held outside of Korea took place in Madison Square Garden in New York City. In 1988, Moon matched 2,500 Korean members with Japanese members for a Blessing ceremony held in Korea, partly in order to promote unity between the two nations.\n\nThe Blessing ceremonies have attracted a lot of attention in the press and in the public imagination, often being labeled \"mass weddings\". However, in most cases the Blessing ceremony is not a legal wedding ceremony. Some couples are already married and those that are engaged are later legally married according to the laws of their own countries. \"The New York Times\" referred to a 1997 ceremony for 28,000 couples as a \"marriage affirmation ceremony,\" adding: \"The real weddings were held later in separate legal ceremonies.\" \n\nThe 1990s saw a big change when Rev. Moon allowed the Blessing to be given to other people besides Unification Church members. This liberalization led to a great increase in the number of Blessed couples, with most of them having been already married and not Unification Church members. It is possible for any Blessed couple to give the Blessing to other couples and this is being done in many cases by ministers of other churches who have received the Blessing though their association with the Unification Church. Ministers of other faiths, including Judaism and Islam have served as \"co-officiators\" at Blessing ceremonies presided over by Rev. and Mrs. Moon. Since 2001 couples Blessed by Moon have been able to arrange marriages for their own children, without his direct guidance.\n\nAdult Unificationists (those who joined on their own without family ties) and Blessed Children (those whose parents received the Blessing of Marriage) each follow a similar yet distinct process in preparing for marriage, being matched (engaged) and finally receiving the Blessing. Non-Unificationists (people of other faiths, nonreligious) who believe in the ideals of the church teachings can also be part of the Marriage Blessing. People who are already married are also welcome and can begin walking a path towards the Blessing. On October 3, 1976 Reverend Moon is quoted saying \"The international Blessing developed by the Unification Church is not a wedding which is limited to only Unification Church members. This is the official course that all human beings must pass through. We should clearly understand this fact.\"\n\nThe basic process for children who grew up in the church and others who want to get married is described in their official website. There, it also describes the training and workshops one must go through to understand the value of the Blessing, become candidates and learn why marriage is the key for building God's Kingdom. Adult Unificationists and Blessed Children can receive support from either their parents or their matching advisors as they prepare for the matching and the Blessing. Married couples can go through marriage enhancement workshops after being Blessed.\n\nThe traditional steps for completing the sanctity of the blessing ceremony is the following:\n\nCouples taking part in Blessing ceremonies exchange these four vows:\n\n\nIn 1997, Rev. and Mrs. Moon presided over a Blessing ceremony in Washington D. C. in which 28,000 of the 30,000 couples taking part were previously married, including Baptist minister and civil rights advocate Al Sharpton and his wife Katherine. A 2000 ceremony included couples in North Korea. In a 2001 ceremony George Augustus Stallings, founder of the Imani Temple African-American Catholic Congregation, married Sayomi Kamimoto, a Japanese Unification Church member. At the same ceremony was Minister Benjamin Muhammad, the national director of the Million Man March and the Million Family March and a representative of Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam. Former Ugandan President Godfrey Binaisa married Tomoko Yamamoto, a 58-year-old Japanese woman during the Blessing ceremony in 2004. At that time, of the wedding, which took place remotely with Godfrey present over a satellite video link, he was 84 years old. A Blessing Ceremony was held at Headquarters of the United Nations in 2000.\n\nSuch weddings proved to be happy, according to scientific research. \"Whatever anyone wants to say about the Unification Church, the marital aspect seems to work,\" said Robert Epstein, a research psychologist. No-divorce rates are up to 83% in the Unification Church. Unification Church teaches that romantic love leads to sexual promiscuity, mismatched couples and dysfunctional societies.\n\nThe Unification Movement affected the demographic map of mono-ethnic Korea due to its Blessing Ceremony. South Korea has an acute problem of gender imbalance. Consequently, there is a large shortage of marriageable women: more than half of female immigrants are from the Philippines, Thailand and other countries came to Korea due to the Unification Movement and less than 20% – through marriage agencies.\n\nIn 2009, a blessing ceremony for 7,000 couples was attended by the Vice Speaker of the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea and by the daughter of the late President Park Chung-hee. She said: \"I join in a trans-religious spirit. I like the Unification Church way of interpreting the Bible, incorporating the Quran and Buddhist scripts\". In 2013, four months after the death of Sun Myung Moon, the church held a Blessing ceremony for 3,500 couples in South Korea, while another 24,000 followers took part in other countries via video link. This ceremony was presided over by Hak Ja Han.\n\nMoon's practice of matching couples was very unusual in both Christian tradition and in modern Western culture and attracted much attention and controversy. Members of some churches have expressed concerns that people of their churches taking part in Blessing ceremonies might join the Unification Church. In 1998, journalist Peter Maass reported that some Unification Church members were dismayed and grumbled when Moon extended the Blessing to non-members because they had not gone through the same course that members had.\n\nIn 2001, the Unification Church came into conflict with the Roman Catholic Church when Catholic archbishop Emmanuel Milingo and Maria Sung, a 43-year-old Korean acupuncturist, married in a Unification Church Blessing ceremony, presided over by Rev. and Mrs. Moon. Following his marriage the Archbishop was called to the Vatican by Pope John Paul II, where he was asked not to see his wife anymore, and to move to a Capuchin monastery. Sung went on a hunger strike to protest their separation. This attracted much media attention. Milingo is now an advocate of the removal of the requirement for celibacy by priests in the Catholic Church. He is the founder of Married Priests Now!.\n\nThe Blessing ceremony figured in the plot of Don DeLillo's 1991 novel \"Mao II\". In 2007, the British television network Channel 4 aired a documentary film by Ulster producer Brian Henry Martin's Doubleband Films, entitled \"My Big Fat Moonie Wedding\", about some of the participants in the 1982 Blessing ceremony of over 2,000 couples which took place in Madison Square Garden. In his 2009 autobiography, \"Tahoe Boy: A Journey Back Home\", Pat Hickey, a state representative in Nevada and former member of the Unification Church of the United States who took part in the same ceremony, wrote about his experience of being matched to his future wife by Moon.\nIn 2012, British Producer Firecracker Films produced a television documentary on second generation church couples who attended a Blessing ceremony in Korea entitled \"Married to the Moonies.\" It was broadcast on Channel 4 and later on TLC in the United States under the title \"Mass Moon Wedding.\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1047538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1047538", "title": "Brugmansia", "text": "Brugmansia\n\nBrugmansia is a genus of seven species of flowering plants in the family Solanaceae. They are woody trees or shrubs, with pendulous flowers, and have no spines on their fruit. Their large, fragrant flowers give them their common name of angel's trumpets, a name sometimes used for the closely related genus \"Datura\". (\"Datura\" differ from \"Brugmansia\" in that they are herbaceous bushes, with erect rather than pendulous flowers - and most have spines on their fruit).\n\nLike many ornamental plants, all parts of \"Brugmansia\" can be toxic. All seven species are known only in cultivation or as escapes from cultivation, and no wild plants have ever been confirmed. They are therefore listed as Extinct in the Wild by the IUCN Red List, although they are popular ornamental plants and still exist wild outside their native range as introduced species.. It is suspected that their extinction in the wild is due to the extinction of some animal which previously dispersed the seeds.\n\n\"Brugmansia\" are large shrubs or small trees, with semi-woody, often many-branched trunks. They can reach heights of . The leaves are alternately arranged along the stems, generally large, long and across, with an entire or coarsely toothed margin, and are often covered with fine hairs. The name \"angel's trumpet\" refers to the large, pendulous, trumpet-shaped flowers, long and across at the opening. They come in shades of white, yellow, pink, orange, green, or red. Most have a strong, pleasing fragrance that is most noticeable in the evening. Flowers may be single, double, or more.\n\n\"Brugmansia\" are native to tropical regions of South America, along the Andes from Venezuela to northern Chile, and also in south-eastern Brazil. They are grown as ornamental container plants worldwide, and have become naturalized in isolated tropical areas around the globe, including within North America, Africa, Australia, and Asia.\n\nMost \"Brugmansia\" are fragrant in the evenings to attract pollinating moths. One species lacking scent, the red-flowered \"Brugmansia sanguinea\", is pollinated by long-billed hummingbirds.\n\"Brugmansia\" have two main stages to their life cycle. In the initial vegetative stage the young seedling grows straight up on usually a single stalk, until it reaches its first main fork at high. It will not flower until after it has reached this fork, and then only on new growth above the fork. Cuttings taken from the lower vegetative region must also grow to a similar height before flowering, but cuttings from the upper flowering region will often flower at a very low height.\n\nOne interesting example of plant/animal interaction involves the butterfly \"Placidula euryanassa\", which uses \"Brugmansia suaveolens\" as one of its main larval foods. It has been shown that these can sequester the plant's tropane alkaloids and store them through the pupal stage on to the adult butterfly, where they are then used as a defense mechanism, making themselves less palatable to vertebrate predators.\n\nLinnaeus first classified these plants as part of \"Datura\" with his 1753 description of \"Datura arborea\". Then in 1805, C. H. Persoon transferred them into a separate genus, \"Brugmansia\", named for Dutch naturalist Sebald Justinus Brugmans. For another 168 years, various authors placed them back and forth between the genera of \"Brugmansia\" and \"Datura\", until in 1973, with his detailed comparison of morphological differences, T.E. Lockwood settled them as separate genera, where they have stayed unchallenged since.\n\nCurrently, there are 7 recognized species:\nThese species are then divided into two natural, genetically isolated groups. \"Brugmansia\" section \"Brugmansia\" (the warm-growing group) includes the species \"aurea\", \"insignis\", \"sauveolens\", and \"versicolor\". \"Brugmansia\" section \"Sphaerocarpium\" (the cold group) includes the species \"arborea\", \"sanguinea\", and \"vulcanicola\".\n\nTwo of these species were challenged by Lockwood in his 1973 doctoral thesis.\nFirst, \"Brugmansia vulcanicola\" was said to be a subspecies of \"B. sanguinea\", but this was refuted by Lockwood's former mentor, R. E. Schultes in 1977.\nSecond, Lockwood proposed that the species \"B. insignis\" was instead a hybrid of the combination (\"B. suaveolens\" x \"B. versicolor\") x \"B. suaveolens\". This was later disproved by crossbreeding experiments done by the Preissels, published in 1997.\n\n\"Brugmansia\" are most often grown today as flowering ornamental plants.\n\nIn modern medicine, important alkaloids such as scopolamine, hyoscyamine, and atropine, found in \"Brugmansia\" and other related members of Solanaceae, have proven medical value for their spasmolytic, anti-asthmatic, anticholinergic, narcotic and anesthetic properties, although many of these alkaloids, or their equivalents, are now artificially synthesized.\n\"Brugmansia\" have also traditionally been used in many South American indigenous cultures in medical preparations and as an entheogen in religious or spiritual ceremonies. Medicinally, they have mostly been used externally as part of a poultice, tincture, ointment, or where the leaves are directly applied transdermally to the skin. Traditional external uses have included the treating of aches and pains, dermatitis, orchitis, arthritis, rheumatism, headaches, infections, and as an anti-inflammatory. They have been used internally much more rarely due to the inherent dangers of ingestion. Internal uses, in highly diluted preparations, and often as a portion of a larger mix, have included treatments for stomach and muscle ailments, as a decongestant, to induce vomiting, to expel worms and parasites, and as a sedative.\n\nSeveral South American cultures have used \"Brugmansia\" as a treatment for unruly children, that they might be admonished directly by their ancestors in the spirit world, and thereby become more compliant. Mixed with maize beer and tobacco leaves, it has been used to drug wives and slaves before they were buried alive with their dead lord.\n\nAll parts of \"Brugmansia\" are potentially poisonous, with the seeds and leaves being especially dangerous.\n\"Brugmansia\" are rich in scopolamine (hyoscine), hyoscyamine, and several other tropane alkaloids.\nEffects of ingestion can include paralysis of smooth muscles, confusion, tachycardia, dry mouth, diarrhea, migraine headaches, visual and auditory hallucinations, mydriasis, rapid onset cycloplegia, and death.\n\nThe hallucinogenic effects of \"Brugmansia\" were described in the journal \"Pathology\" as \"terrifying rather than pleasurable\". The author Christina Pratt, in \"An Encyclopedia of Shamanism\", says that \"\"Brugmansia\" induces a powerful trance with violent and unpleasant effects, sickening after effects, and at times temporary insanity\". These hallucinations are often characterized by complete loss of awareness that one is hallucinating, disconnection from reality, and amnesia of the episode, such as one example reported in \"Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience\" of a young man who amputated his own penis and tongue after drinking only 1 cup of \"Brugmansia\" tea. \n\nIn 1994 in Florida, 112 people were admitted to hospitals from ingesting \"Brugmansia\", leading one municipality to prohibit the purchase, sale, or cultivation of \"Brugmansia\" plants. The concentrations of alkaloids in all parts of the plant differ markedly. They even vary with the seasons and the level of hydration, so it is nearly impossible to determine a safe level of alkaloid exposure.\n\n\"Brugmansia\" are easily grown in a moist, fertile, well-drained soil, in sun to part shade, in frost-free climates. They begin to flower in mid to late spring in warm climates and continue into the fall (autumn), often continuing as late as early winter in warm conditions. In cool winters, outdoor plants need protection from frost, but the roots are hardier, and may resprout in late spring. The species from the higher elevations, in \"B\". section \"Sphaerocarpium\", prefer moderate temperatures and cool nights, and may not flower if temperatures are very hot. Most \"Brugmansia\" may be propagated easily by rooting cuttings taken from the end of a branch during the summer.\n\nSeveral hybrids and numerous cultivars have been developed for use as ornamental plants. \"B. \"×\" candida\" is a hybrid between \"B. aurea\" and \"B. versicolor\"; \"B. \"×\" flava\" is a hybrid between \"B. arborea\" and \"B. sanguinea\"; and \"B. \"×\" cubensis\" is a hybrid between \"B. suaveolens\", \"B. versicolor\", and \"B. aurea\". There are cultivars producing double flowers, and some with variegated leaves. The cultivar \"B.\" × \"candida\" 'Grand Marnier' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2394308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2394308", "title": "Criticism of Islam", "text": "Criticism of Islam\n\nCriticism of Islam has existed since its formative stages. Early written disapproval came from Christians as well as by some former Muslims such as Ibn al-Rawandi. Western criticism has grown in the 21st century.\n\nObjects of criticism include the morality and authenticity of the Quran and the hadiths, along with the life of Muhammad, both in his public and personal life. Other criticism concerns many aspects of human rights in the Islamic world (in both historical and present-day societies), including the treatment of women, LGBT groups, and religious and ethnic minorities in Islamic law and practice. In the recent adoption of multiculturalism, some have questioned Islam's influence on the ability or willingness of Muslim citizens and immigrants to assimilate into Western countries. The issues when debating and questioning Islam are incredibly complex with each side having a different view on the morality, meaning, interpretation, and authenticity of each topic.\n\nThe earliest surviving written criticisms of Islam are to be found in the writings of Christians who came under the early dominion of the Islamic Caliphate. One such Christian was John of Damascus (c. 676–749 CE), who was familiar with Islam and Arabic. The second chapter of his book, \"The Fount of Wisdom\", titled \"Concerning Heresies\", presents a series of discussions between Christians and Muslims. John claimed an Arian monk (whom he did not know was Bahira) influenced Muhammad and viewed the Islamic doctrines as nothing more than a hodgepodge culled from the Bible.\n\nOther notable early critics of Islam included: Abu Isa al-Warraq and Ibn al-Rawandi, two 9th-century critics of Islam and religion in general, along with al-Ma'arri, an 11th-century Arab poet and critic of Islam and all other religions who was also known for his veganism and antinatalism.\n\nIn the early centuries of the Islamic Caliphate, including the period ruled by the four Rashidun caliphs (often called the \"rightly guided caliphs)\", Islamic law permitted citizens to freely express their views, including criticism of Islam and religious authorities, without fear of persecution. As such, there have been several notable critics and skeptics of Islam that arose from within the Islamic world itself. In tenth and eleventh-century Syria there lived a blind poet called Al-Ma'arri. He became well known for a poetry that was affected by a \"pervasive pessimism.\" He labeled religions in general as \"noxious weeds\" and said that Islam does not have a monopoly on truth. He had particular contempt for the \"ulema\", writing that:\n\nIn 1280, before the Mongol conversion to Islam, Jewish philosopher Ibn Kammuna wrote his best known book \"Examination of the Three Faiths\" (also called \"Tanqih\"). \"Tanqih\" is noted as having some recognizable bias in favor of rabbinic Judaism, but the larger work also includes criticsms of Christianity and Judaism. Although the work is not considered a polemic against any one faith as a whole, his glosses for Fakhr al-Din al-Razi's \"al-Ma‘alim\" contain some elements of anti-Islam polemic. Part of the highly technical theological discussion in this gloss contains a rejection of al-Razi's proofs for the establishment of Muhammad's prophetic mission, which al-Razi has based the validity of on miracles called \"mu'jizah\". In another critical passage from \"Tanqih\" Kammuna writes the following about a contemporary dispute: \"there is no proof that Muhammad attained perfection and the ability to perfect others as claimed...for example, the allegation that the world turned from falsehood to truth, from lie to veracity, from darkness to light, and so on.\" The section goes on to explain what Kammuna perceives to be the real reasons motivating converts to Islam (what Bernard Lewis calls \"baser motives\"): \"He is moved by fear or ambition; he is liable to a heavy tax, or wishes to escape from humiliation, or is taken prisoner, falls in love with a Muslim woman, or some other motives like these.\" Scholars are uncertain whether Kammuna himself may have converted.\n\nDavid Hume was critical of traditional religion and scholars generally agree that Hume was both a naturalist and a skeptic (though there is no agreement about whether Hume should be considered an atheist). In his \"Natural Histories of Religion\" Hume argued that the main advantage monotheism offered over what he considered the primitive polytheistic form of religion was that monotheistic religions were \"comformable to sound reason\". In Hume's view Islam was an even stricter form of theism then the Christian doctrine of Trinity; as Hume associated the rise of theistic religions with rationalism, Hume also finds Islam to be more \"rational\" then Christianity. Hume uses Islam to launch humorous critiques of the Eucharist, namely he tells a story of a Turkish prisoner who is catechised and asked how many gods there were after taking his first communion; the prisoner replies \"none\" believing he had just eaten the Lord.\n\nThe commonly held view in Europe during the Enlightenment was that Islam, then synonomous with the Ottoman Empire, was a bloody, ruthless and intolerant religion. In the European view, Islam lacked moral or divine authority, but Hume makes similar critical comments about the \"bloody\" and prolonged conflict fought between Catholics and Protestants during the Reformation. There were many contemporary works by authors such as Isaac Barrow, Humphrey Prideaux, John Jackson, Charles Wolseley, Hugo Grotius, Paul Rycaut, Thomas Hyde, Pierre Bayle, and Blaise Pascal that had been published on Islam that may have informed Hume's opinions. The writers of this period was also influenced by George Sale who, in 1743, had translated the Quran into English.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the prevailing view among Europeans was that Islam was the root cause of Arab and Berber \"backwardness\". They saw Islam as an obstacle to assimilation, a view that was expressed by a writer in colonial French Algeria named André Servier. In his book, titled \"Islam and the Psychology of the Musulman\", Servier wrote that \"The only thing Arabs ever invented was their religion. And this religion is, precisely, the main obstacle between them and us\". Servier describes Islam as a \"religious nationalism in which every Muslim brain is steeped\". According to Servier, the only reason this nationalism has not \"been able to pose a threat to humanity\" was that the \"rigid dogma\" of Islam had rendered the Arabs \"incapable of fighting against the material forces placed at the disposal of Western civilization by science and progress\".\n\nThe early 20th-century missionary James L. Barton argued that Islam's view of the sovereignty of God is so extreme and unbalanced as to produce a fatalism that stifles human initiative:\n\nDuring a lecture given at the University of Regensburg in 2006, Pope Benedict XVI quoted an unfavorable remark about Islam made at the end of the 14th century by Byzantine ruler Manuel II Palaiologos: \"Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.\" The Pope later apologized and disavowed the remark, saying it did not represent his political views.\n\nNobel prize-winning novelist V.S. Naipaul stated that Islam requires its adherents to destroy everything which is not related to it. He described it as having a \"calamitous effect on converted peoples, to be converted you have to destroy your past, destroy your history. You have to stamp on it, you have to say 'my ancestral culture does not exist, it doesn't matter'\" Nobel prize-winning playwright Wole Soyinka stated that Islam had a role in denigrating African spiritual traditions. He criticized attempts to whitewash what he sees as the destructive and coercive history of Islam on the African continent: \"Let those who wish to retain or evaluate religion as a twenty-first project feel free to do so, but let it not be done as a continuation of the game of denigration against the African spiritual heritage as in a recent television series perpetrated by Islam's born again revisionist of history\" Soyinka also regarded Islam as \"superstition\", and said that it does not belong to Africa. He stated that it is mainly spread with violence and force.\n\nOriginality of Quranic manuscripts. According to traditional Islamic scholarship, all of the Quran was written down by Muhammad's companions while he was alive (during 610–632 CE), but it was primarily an orally related document. The written compilation of the whole Quran in its definite form as we have it now was completed around 20 years after the death of Mohammed. John Wansbrough, Patricia Crone and Yehuda D. Nevo argue that all the primary sources which exist are from 150–300 years after the events which they describe, and thus are chronologically far removed from those events.\n\nImperfections in the Quran. Critics reject the idea that the Quran is miraculously perfect and impossible to imitate as asserted in the Quran itself. The 1901-1906 \"Jewish Encyclopedia\", for example, writes: \"The language of the Koran is held by the Mohammedans to be a peerless model of perfection. Critics, however, argue that peculiarities can be found in the text. For example, critics note that a sentence in which something is said concerning Allah is sometimes followed immediately by another in which Allah is the speaker (examples of this are suras xvi. 81, xxvii. 61, xxxi. 9, and xliii. 10.) Many peculiarities in the positions of words are due to the necessities of rhyme (lxix. 31, lxxiv. 3), while the use of many rare words and new forms may be traced to the same cause (comp. especially xix. 8, 9, 11, 16).\" More serious are factual inaccuracies. For instance, Sura 25.53 claims that fresh water and salt water do not mix. While there may be cases in which these two bodies of water mix only slowly, every (fresh water) river that reaches an ocean will mix with salt water. Such areas of mixing are called estuaries (e.g. at the mouth of the Río de la Plata).\n\nJudaism and the Quran. According to the \"Jewish Encyclopedia\", \"The dependence of Mohammed upon his Jewish teachers or upon what he heard of the Jewish Haggadah and Jewish practices is now generally conceded.\" John Wansbrough believes that the Quran is a redaction in part of other sacred scriptures, in particular the Judaeo-Christian scriptures. Herbert Berg writes that \"Despite John Wansbrough's very cautious and careful inclusion of qualifications such as \"conjectural,\" and \"tentative and emphatically provisional\", his work is condemned by some. Some of this negative reaction is undoubtedly due to its radicalness...Wansbrough's work has been embraced wholeheartedly by few and has been employed in a piecemeal fashion by many. Many praise his insights and methods, if not all of his conclusions.\" Early jurists and theologians of Islam mentioned some Jewish influence but they also say where it is seen and recognized as such, it is perceived as a debasement or a dilution of the authentic message. Bernard Lewis describes this as \"something like what in Christian history was called a Judaizing heresy.\" According to Moshe Sharon, the story of Muhammad having Jewish teachers is a legend developed in the 10th century CE. Philip Schaff described the Quran as having \"many passages of poetic beauty, religious fervor, and wise counsel, but mixed with absurdities, bombast, unmeaning images, low sensuality.\"\n\nMohammed and God as speakers. According to Ibn Warraq, the Persian rationalist, Ali Dashti criticized the Quran on the basis that for some passages, \"the speaker cannot have been God.\" Warraq gives Surah Al-Fatiha as an example of a passage which is \"clearly addressed to God, in the form of a prayer.\" He says that by only adding the word \"say\" in front of the passage, this difficulty could have been removed. Furthermore, it is also known that one of the companions of Muhammad, Ibn Masud, rejected Surah Fatihah as being part of the Quran; these kind of disagreements are, in fact, common among the companions of Muhammad who could not decide which surahs were part of the Quran and which not.\n\nOther criticism:\n\nHadith are Muslim traditions relating to the \"Sunnah\" (words and deeds) of Muhammad. They are drawn from the writings of scholars writing between 844 and 874 CE, more than 200 years after the death of Mohammed in 632 CE. Within Islam, different schools, branches and sects have different opinions on the proper selection and use of Hadith. The four schools of Sunni Islam all consider Hadith second only to the Quran, although they differ on how much freedom of interpretation should be allowed to legal scholars. Shi'i scholars disagree with Sunni scholars as to which Hadith should be considered reliable. The Shi'as accept the Sunnah of Ali and the Imams as authoritative in addition to the Sunnah of Muhammad, and as a consequence they maintain their own, different, collections of Hadith.\n\nIt has been suggested that there exists around the Hadith three major sources of corruption: political conflicts, sectarian prejudice, and the desire to translate the underlying meaning, rather than the original words verbatim.\n\nMuslim critics of the hadith, Quranists, reject the authority of hadith on theological grounds, pointing to verses in the Quran itself: \"Nothing have We omitted from the Book\", declaring that all necessary instruction can be found within the Quran, without reference to the Hadith. They claim that following the Hadith has led to people straying from the original purpose of God's revelation to Muhammad, adherence to the Quran alone. Ghulam Ahmed Pervez (1903–1985) was a noted critic of the Hadith and believed that the Quran alone was all that was necessary to discern God's will and our obligations. A fatwa, ruling, signed by more than a thousand orthodox clerics, denounced him as a 'kafir', a non-believer. His seminal work, \"Maqam-e Hadith\" argued that the Hadith were composed of \"the garbled words of previous centuries\", but suggests that he is not against the \"idea\" of collected sayings of the Prophet, only that he would consider any hadith that goes against the teachings of Quran to have been falsely attributed to the Prophet. The 1986 Malaysian book \"Hadith: A Re-evaluation\" by Kassim Ahmad was met with controversy and some scholars declared him an apostate from Islam for suggesting that \"\"the hadith are sectarian, anti-science, anti-reason and anti-women.\"\n\nJohn Esposito notes that \"Modern Western scholarship has seriously questioned the historicity and authenticity of the \"hadith\"\", maintaining that \"the bulk of traditions attributed to the Prophet Muhammad were actually written much later.\" He mentions Joseph Schacht, considered the father of the revisionist movement, as one scholar who argues this, claiming that Schacht \"found no evidence of legal traditions before 722,\" from which Schacht concluded that \"the Sunna of the Prophet is not the words and deeds of the Prophet, but apocryphal material\" dating from later. Other scholars, however, such as Wilferd Madelung, have argued that \"wholesale rejection as late fiction is unjustified\".\n\nOrthodox Muslims do not deny the existence of false hadith, but believe that through the scholars' work, these false hadith have been largely eliminated.\n\nThe traditional view of Islam has also been criticised for the lack of supporting evidence consistent with that view, such as the lack of archaeological evidence, and discrepancies with non-Muslim literary sources. In the 1970s, what has been described as a \"wave of sceptical scholars\" challenged a great deal of the received wisdom in Islamic studies. They argued that the Islamic historical tradition had been greatly corrupted in transmission. They tried to correct or reconstruct the early history of Islam from other, presumably more reliable, sources such as coins, inscriptions, and non-Islamic sources. The oldest of this group was John Wansbrough (1928–2002). Wansbrough's works were widely noted, but perhaps not widely read. In 1972 a cache of ancient Qurans in a mosque in Sana'a, Yemen was discovered – commonly known as the Sana'a manuscripts. The German scholar Gerd R. Puin has been investigating these Quran fragments for years. His research team made 35,000 microfilm photographs of the manuscripts, which he dated to early part of the 8th century. Puin has not published the entirety of his work, but noted unconventional verse orderings, minor textual variations, and rare styles of orthography. He also suggested that some of the parchments were palimpsests which had been reused. Puin believed that this implied an evolving text as opposed to a fixed one.\n\nMuhammad is considered as one of the prophets in Islam and as a model for followers. Critics such as Sigismund Koelle and former Muslim Ibn Warraq see some of Mohammed's actions as immoral.\n\nKa'b ibn al-Ashraf wrote a poetic eulogy commemorating the slain Quraish notables; later, he had traveled to Mecca and provoked the Quraish to fight Muhammad. He also wrote erotic poetry about Muslim women, which offended the Muslims there. This poetry influenced so many that this too was considered directly against the Constitution of Medina which states, \"loyalty gives protection against treachery\" and \"this document will not (be employed to) protect one who is unjust or commits a crime.\" Other sources also state that he was plotting to assassinate Muhammad.\nMuhammad called upon his followers to kill Ka'b. Muhammad ibn Maslama offered his services, collecting four others. By pretending to have turned against Muhammad, Muhammad ibn Maslama and the others enticed Ka'b out of his fortress on a moonlit night, and killed him in spite of his vigorous resistance. The Jews were terrified at his assassination, and as the historian Ibn Ishaq put it \"...there was not a Jew who did not fear for his life\".\n\nAccording to scriptural Sunni's Hadith sources, Aisha was six or seven years old when she was married to Muhammad and nine when the marriage was consummated. However Shia Muslims tend to differ as to the age of Aisha.\n\nMuhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, born in Persia 200 years after Muhammmad's death, suggested that she was ten years old. Six hundred years after Muhammad, Ibn Khallikan recorded that she was nine years old at marriage, and twelve at consummation. Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi, born about 150 years after Muhammad's death, cited Hisham ibn Urwah as saying that she was nine years old at marriage, and twelve at consummation, but Hisham ibn Urwah's original source is otherwise unknown, and Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi's work does not have the high religious status of the Hadith.\n\nIn the twentieth century, Indian writer Muhammad Ali challenged the Hadith showing that Aisha was as young as the traditional sources claim; arguing that instead a new interpretation of the Hadith compiled by Mishkat al-Masabih, Wali-ud-Din Muhammad ibn Abdullah Al-Khatib, could indicate that Aisha would have been nineteen years old around the time of her marriage.\n\nColin Turner, a UK professor of Islamic studies, states that since such marriages between an older man and a young girl were customary among the Bedouins, Muhammad's marriage would not have been considered improper by his contemporaries. Karen Armstrong, the British author on comparative religion, has affirmed that \"There was no impropriety in Muhammad's marriage to Aisha. Marriages conducted in absentia to seal an alliance were often contracted at this time between adults and minors who were even younger than Aisha.\"\n\nAccording to some critics, the morality of the Quran appears to be a moral regression when judged by the standards of the moral traditions of Judaism and Christianity it says that it builds upon. The \"Catholic Encyclopedia\", for example, states that \"the ethics of Islam are far inferior to those of Judaism and even more inferior to those of the New Testament\" and \"that in the ethics of Islam there is a great deal to admire and to approve, is beyond dispute; but of originality or superiority, there is none.\"\n\nBernard Lewis writes: \"In one of the sad paradoxes of human history, it was the humanitarian reforms brought by Islam that resulted in a vast development of the slave trade inside, and still more outside, the Islamic empire.\" He notes that the Islamic injunctions against the enslavement of Muslims led to massive importation of slaves from the outside. According to Patrick Manning, Islam by recognizing and codifying the slavery seems to have done more to protect and expand slavery than the reverse.\n\nUnlike Western societies which in their opposition to slavery spawned anti-slavery movements whose numbers and enthusiasm often grew out of church groups, no such grass-roots organizations ever developed in Muslim societies. In Muslim politics the state unquestioningly accepted the teachings of Islam and applied them as law. Islam, by sanctioning slavery, also extended legitimacy to the traffic in slaves.\n\nIt was only in the early 20th century (post World War I) that slavery gradually became outlawed and suppressed in Muslim lands, largely due to pressure exerted by Western nations such as Britain and France. Gordon describes the lack of homegrown Islamic abolition movements as owing much to the fact that it was deeply anchored in Islamic law. By legitimizing slavery and – by extension – traffic in slaves, Islam elevated those practices to an unassailable moral plane. As a result, in no part of the Muslim world was an ideological challenge ever mounted against slavery. The political and social system in Muslim society would have taken a dim view of such a challenge.\n\nThe issue of slavery in the Islamic world in modern times is controversial. Critics argue there is hard evidence of its existence and destructive effects. Others maintain slavery in central Islamic lands has been virtually extinct since mid-twentieth century, and that reports from Sudan and Somalia showing practice of slavery is in border areas as a result of continuing war and not Islamic belief. In recent years, according to some scholars, there has been a \"worrying trend\" of \"reopening\" of the issue of slavery by some conservative Salafi Islamic scholars after its \"closing\" earlier in the 20th century when Muslim-majority countries banned slavery and \"most Muslim scholars\" found the practice \"inconsistent with Qur'anic morality.\"\n\nShaykh Fadhlalla Haeri of Karbala expressed the view in 1993 that the enforcement of servitude can occur but is restricted to war captives and those born of slaves.\n\nIn a 2014 issue of their digital magazine \"Dabiq\", the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant explicitly claimed religious justification for enslaving Yazidi women.\n\nAccording to Islamic law apostasy is identified by a list of actions such as conversion to another religion, denying the existence of God, rejecting the prophets, mocking God or the prophets, idol worship, rejecting the sharia, or permitting behavior that is forbidden by the sharia, such as adultery or the eating of forbidden foods or drinking of alcoholic beverages. The majority of Muslim scholars hold to the traditional view that apostasy is punishable by death or imprisonment until repentance, at least for adult men of sound mind.\n\nLaws prohibiting religious conversion run contrary to Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that \"[e]veryone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.\"\n\nThe English historian C.E. Bosworth suggests the traditional view of apostasy hampered the development of Islamic learning, arguing that while the organizational form of the Christian university allowed them to develop and flourish into the modern university, \"the Muslim ones remained constricted by the doctrine of waqf alone, with their physical plant often deteriorating hopelessly and their curricula narrowed by the exclusion of the non-traditional religious sciences like philosophy and natural science,\" out of fear that these could evolve into potential toe-holds for kufr, those people who reject God.\"\n\nIn 13 Muslim-majority countries atheism is punishable by death.\n\nBernard Lewis summarizes:\n\nThe four Sunni schools of Islamic jurisprudence, as well as Shi'a scholars, agree on the difference of punishment between male and female. A sane adult male apostate may be executed. A female apostate may be put to death, according to the majority view, or imprisoned until she repents, according to others.\n\nThe Quran threatens apostates with punishment in the next world only, the historian W. Heffening states, the traditions however contain the element of death penalty. Muslim scholar Shafi'i interprets verse as adducing the main evidence for the death penalty in Quran. The historian Wael Hallaq states the later addition of death penalty \"reflects a later reality and does not stand in accord with the deeds of the Prophet.\" He further states that \"nothing in the law governing apostate and apostasy derives from the letter of the holy text.\"\n\nWilliam Montgomery Watt, in response to a question about Western views of the Islamic Law as being cruel, states that \"In Islamic teaching, such penalties may have been suitable for the age in which Muhammad lived. However, as societies have since progressed and become more peaceful and ordered, they are not suitable any longer.\"\n\nSome contemporary Islamic jurists from both the Sunni and Shia denominations together with Quran only Muslims have argued or issued fatwas that state that either the changing of religion is not punishable or is only punishable under restricted circumstances. For example, Grand Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri argues that no Quranic verse prescribes an earthly penalty for apostasy and adds that it is not improbable that the punishment was prescribed by Muhammad at early Islam due to political conspiracies against Islam and Muslims and not only because of changing the belief or expressing it. Montazeri defines different types of apostasy. He does not hold that a reversion of belief because of investigation and research is punishable by death but prescribes capital punishment for a desertion of Islam out of malice and enmity towards the Muslim.\n\nAccording to Yohanan Friedmann, an Israeli Islamic Studies scholar, a Muslim may stress tolerant elements of Islam (by for instance adopting the broadest interpretation of Quran 2:256 (\"No compulsion is there in religion...\") or the humanist approach attributed to Ibrahim al-Nakha'i), without necessarily denying the existence of other ideas in the Medieval Islamic tradition but rather discussing them in their historical context (by for example arguing that \"civilizations comparable with the Islamic one, such as the Sassanids and the Byzantines, also punished apostasy with death. Similarly neither Judaism nor Christianity treated apostasy and apostates with any particular kindness\"). Friedmann continues:\n\nSome widely held interpretations of Islam are inconsistent with Human Rights conventions that recognize the right to change religion. In particular article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nstates:\nTo implement this, Article 18 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states:\n\nThe right for Muslims to change their religion is not afforded by the Iranian Shari'ah law, which specifically forbids it. In 1981, the Iranian representative to the United Nations, Said Rajaie-Khorassani, articulated the position of his country regarding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, by saying that the UDHR was \"a secular understanding of the Judeo-Christian tradition\", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing the Islamic law. As a matter of law, on the basis of its obligations as a state party to the ICCPR, Iran is obliged to uphold the right of individuals to practice the religion of their choice and to change religions, including converting from Islam. The prosecution of converts from Islam on the basis of religious edicts that identify apostasy as an offense punishable by death is clearly at variance with this obligation. Muslim-majority countries such as Sudan and Saudi Arabia, have the death penalty for apostasy from Islam. These countries have criticized the Universal Declaration of Human Rights for its perceived failure to take into account the cultural and religious context of non-Western countries. In 1990, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation published a separate Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam compliant with Shari'ah. Although granting many of the rights in the UN declaration, it does not grant Muslims the right to convert to other religions, and restricts freedom of speech to those expressions of it that are not in contravention of the Islamic law.\n\nAbul Ala Maududi, the founder of Jamaat-e-Islami, wrote a book called Human Rights in Islam, in which he argues that respect for human rights has always been enshrined in Sharia law (indeed that the roots of these rights are to be found in Islamic doctrine) and criticizes Western notions that there is an inherent contradiction between the two. Western scholars have, for the most part, rejected Maududi's analysis.\n\nThe September 11 attacks on the United States, and various other acts of Islamic terrorism over the 21st century, have resulted in many non-Muslims' indictment of Islam as a violent religion. In particular, the Quran's teachings on matters of war and peace have become topics of heated discussion in recent years. On the one hand, some critics claim that certain verses of the Quran sanction military action against unbelievers as a whole both during the lifetime of Muhammad and after. The Quran says, \"Fight in the name of your religion with those who fight against you.\" On the other hand, most Muslim scholars, including Ahmadiyya, argue that such verses of the Quran are interpreted out of context, and argue that when the verses are read in context it clearly appears that the Quran prohibits aggression, and allows fighting only in self-defense.\n\nOrientalist David Margoliouth described the Battle of Khaybar as the \"stage at which Islam became a menace to the whole world.\" According to Margoliouth, earlier attacks on the Meccans and the Jewish tribes of Medina (e.g., the invasion of Banu Qurayza) could be at least plausibly be ascribed to wrongs done to Muhammad or the Islamic community. Margoliouth argues that the Jews of Khaybar had done nothing to harm Muhammad or his followers, and ascribes the attack to a desire for plunder. He describes the reason given by Muhammad for the attack as \"its inhabitants were \"not Moslems\"\" (italics in the source). He wrote that this became an excuse for unfettered conquest.\n\n\"Jihad\", an Islamic term, is a religious duty of Muslims. In Arabic, the word \"jihād\" translates as a noun meaning \"struggle\". \"Jihad\" appears 41 times in the Quran and frequently in the idiomatic expression \"striving for the sake of God \"(al-jihad fi sabil Allah)\"\". Jihad is an important religious duty for Muslims. A minority among the Sunni scholars sometimes refer to this duty as the sixth pillar of Islam, though it occupies no such official status. In Twelver Shi'a Islam, however, Jihad is one of the 10 Practices of the Religion. The Quran calls repeatedly for jihad, or holy war, against unbelievers, including, at times, Jews and Christians. Middle East historian Bernard Lewis argues that \"the overwhelming majority of classical theologians, jurists, and traditionalists (specialists in the hadith) understood the obligation of jihad in a military sense.\" Furthermore, Lewis maintains that for most of the recorded history of Islam, from the lifetime of Muhammad onward, the word jihad was used in a primarily military sense. Andrew Bostom states that a number of jihads have targeted Christians, Hindus, and Jews.\n\nThe Quran: (8:12): \"[Remember] when your Lord inspired to the angels, \"I am with you, so strengthen those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieved, so strike [them] upon the necks and strike from them every fingertip.\" and Quran: (8:30): \"And [remember, O Muhammad], when those who disbelieved plotted against you to restrain you or kill you or evict you [from Makkah]. But they plan, and Allah plans. And Allah is the best of planners.\" and The Quran: (8:38): \"Say to those who have disbelieved [that] if they cease, what has previously occurred will be forgiven for them. But if they return [to hostility] - then the precedent of the former [rebellious] peoples has already taken place.\" The phrase that they have been \"commanded to terrorize the disbelievers\" has been cited in motivation of Jihadi terror. One Jihadi cleric has said:\n\nAnother aim and objective of jihad is to drive terror in the hearts of the [infidels]. To terrorize them. Did you know that we were commanded in the Qur'an with terrorism? ...Allah said, and prepare for them to the best of your ability with power, and with horses of war. To drive terror in the hearts of my enemies, Allah's enemies, and your enemies. And other enemies which you don't know, only Allah knows them... So we were commanded to drive terror into the hearts of the [infidels], to prepare for them with the best of our abilities with power. Then the Prophet said, nay, the power is your ability to shoot. The power which you are commanded with here, is your ability to shoot. Another aim and objective of jihad is to kill the [infidels], to lessen the population of the [infidels]... it is not right for a Prophet to have captives until he makes the Earth warm with blood... so, you should always seek to lessen the population of the [infidels].\n\nDavid Cook, author of \"Understanding Jihad\", said \"In reading Muslim literature – both contemporary and classical – one can see that the evidence for the primacy of spiritual jihad is negligible. Today it is certain that no Muslim, writing in a non-Western language (such as Arabic, Persian, Urdu), would ever make claims that jihad is primarily nonviolent or has been superseded by the spiritual jihad. Such claims are made solely by Western scholars, primarily those who study Sufism and/or work in interfaith dialogue, and by Muslim apologists who are trying to present Islam in the most innocuous manner possible.\" Cook argued that \"Presentations along these lines are ideological in tone and should be discounted for their bias and deliberate ignorance of the subject\" and that \"[i]t is no longer acceptable for Western scholars or Muslim apologists writing in non-Muslim languages to make flat, unsupported statements concerning the prevalence – either from a historical point of view or within contemporary Islam—of the spiritual jihad.\" Magdi Allam, an outspoken Egyptian-born Italian journalist, has described Islam as intrinsically violent and characterized by \"hate and intolerance\".\n\nDennis Prager, columnist and author, in responding to a movement that contends that Islam is \"a religion of peace,\" wrote: \"Now, Islam has never been a religion of peace. It began as a warlike religion and throughout its history, whenever possible, made war on non-Muslims – from the polytheists of North Africa to the Hindus of India, about 60 to 80 million of whom Muslims killed during their thousand-year rule there.\" John R. Neuman, a scholar on religion, describes Islam as \"a perfect anti-religion\" and \"the antithesis of Buddhism.\"\n\nCritics such as lesbian activist Irshad Manji, former Muslims Ehsan Jami and the former Dutch politician Ayaan Hirsi Ali, have criticized Islam's attitudes towards homosexuals. Most international human rights organizations, such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, condemn Islamic laws that make homosexual relations between consenting adults a crime. Since 1994 the United Nations Human Rights Committee has also ruled that such laws violated the right to privacy guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nIn May 2008, the sexual rights lobby group Lambda Istanbul (based in Istanbul, Turkey) was banned by court order for violating a constitutional provision on the protection of the family and an article banning bodies with objectives that violate law and morality. This decision was then taken to the Court of Cassation and the ban lifted.\n\nIn 10 Muslim-majority countries homosexual acts may be punishable by death, though in some the punishment has never been carried out.\n\nThe ex-Muslim Ibn Warraq has noted that the Quran's condemnation of homosexuality has frequently been ignored in practice, and that Muslim-majority countries were much more tolerant of homosexuality than Christian ones until fairly recently.\n\n ( literally \"pleasure marriage\") is a fixed-term or short-term contractual marriage in Shia Islam. The duration of this type of marriage is fixed at its inception and is then automatically dissolved upon completion of its term. For this reason, nikah mut'ah has been widely criticised as the religious cover and legalization of prostitution. The Christian missionary Thomas Patrick Hughes criticized Mut'ah as allowing the continuation of \"one of the abominable practices of ancient Arabia.\" Shi'a and Sunnis agree that Mut'ah was legal in early times, but Sunnis consider that it was abrogated. Ibn Kathir writes that \"[t]here's no doubt that in the outset of Islam, Mut'ah was allowed under the Shari'ah\". Currently, however, mut'ah is one of the distinctive features of Ja'fari jurisprudence. No other school of Islamic jurisprudence allows it. According to Imam Jafar as Sadiq, \"One of the matters about which I shall never keep precautionary silence (taqiyya) is the matter of mu'tah.\" Allameh Tabatabaei defends the Shia view in Tafsir al-Mizan, arguing that there are \"mutawatir\" or nearly \"mutawatir\" traditions narrated from the Shia Imams that Mut'ah is permitted. For example, it has been narrated from Muhammad al-Baqir and Ja'far al-Sadiq that they said \"regarding the [above] verse, and there is no blame on you about what you mutually agree after what is appointed.\" It means that he increases her dowry or she increases his (fixed) period. Sunnis believe that Muhammad later abolished this type of marriage at several different large events, the most accepted being at Khaybar in 7 AH (629 CE) Bukhari 059.527 and at the Victory of Mecca in 8 AH (630 CE). Most Sunnis believe that Umar later was merely enforcing a prohibition that was established during Muhammad's time. Shia contest the criticism that nikah mut'ah is a cover for prostitution, and argue that the unique legal nature of temporary marriage distinguishes Mut'ah ideologically from prostitution.\n\nNikah Misyar () is a type of Nikah (marriage) in Sunni Islam only carried out through the normal contractual procedure, with the provision that the husband and wife give up several rights by their own free will, such as living together, equal division of nights between wives in cases of polygamy, the wife's rights to housing, and maintenance money (\"nafaqa\"), and the husband's right of homekeeping and access. Essentially the couple continue to live separately from each other, as before their contract, and see each other to fulfil their needs in a legally permissible (halaal) manner when they please.\nMisyar has been suggested by some western authors to be a comparable marriage with Nikah mut'ah and that they find it for the sole purpose of \"sexual gratification in a licit manner\" According to Florian Pohl, assistant professor of religion at Oxford College, Misyar marriage is controversial issue in the Muslim world, as many see it as practice that encourages marriages for purely sexual purposes, or that it is used as a cover for a form of prostitutuion.\n\nFor Al-Albani, misyar marriage may even be considered as illicit, because it runs counter to the objectives and the spirit of marriage in Islam, as described in the Quran: \"And among His signs is this, that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that ye may dwell in tranquility with them, and He has put love and mercy between your (hearts)…\" Al-Albani also underlines the social problems which result from the \"misyar\" marriage, particularly in the event that children are born from this union. The children raised by their mother in a home from which the father is always absent, without reason, may suffer difficulties. The situation becomes even worse if the wife is abandoned or repudiated by her husband \"misyar\", with no means of subsistence, as usually happens.\n\nIbn Uthaymeen recognized the legality of \"misyar\" marriage under Shariah, but came to oppose it due to what he considered to be its harmful effects.\n\nDue to the way domestic violence is handled in some modern-day Muslim states, a few organizations have suggested ways to modify Shari'a-inspired laws to improve women's rights in Islamic n ations, including women's rights in domestic abuse cases.\n\nShari'a is the basis for personal status laws in most Islamic majority nations. These personal status laws determine rights of women in matters of marriage, divorce and child custody. A 2011 UNICEF report concludes that Shari'a law provisions are discriminatory against women from a human rights perspective. In legal proceedings under Shari'a law, a woman's testimony is worth half of a man's before a court.\n\nExcept for Iran, Lebanon and Bahrain which allow child marriages, the civil code in Islamic majority countries do not allow child marriage of girls. However, with Shari'a personal status laws, Shari'a courts in all these nations have the power to override the civil code. The religious courts permit girls less than 18 years old to marry. As of 2011, child marriages are common in a few Middle Eastern countries, accounting for 1 in 6 all marriages in Egypt and 1 in 3 marriages in Yemen. However, the average age at marriage in most Middle Eastern countries is steadily rising and is generally in the low to mid 20s for women. Rape is considered a crime in all countries, but Shari'a courts in Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Syria and Tunisia in some cases allow a rapist to escape punishment by marrying his victim, while in other cases the victim who complains is often prosecuted with the crime of \"Zina\" (adultery).\n\nSharia grants women the right to inherit property from other family members, and these rights are detailed in the Quran. A woman's inheritance is unequal and less than a man's, and dependent on many factors. For instance, a daughter's inheritance is usually half that of her brother's.\n\nIslamic law grants Muslim women many legal rights, such as the right to own property received as \"mahr\" (brideprice) at her marriage, that Western legal systems did not grant to women, according to Jamal Badawi. Sharia recognizes the basic inequality between master and women slave, between free women and slave women, between believers and non-believers, as well as their unequal rights. Sharia authorized the institution of slavery, using the words \"abd\" (slave) and the phrase \"ma malakat aymanukum\" (\"that which your right hand owns\") to refer to women slaves, seized as captives of war. Under classical Islamic law, Muslim men can have sexual relations with female captives and slaves.\n\nSlave women under sharia did not have a right to own property, right to free movement. Sharia, in Islam's history, provided religious foundation for enslaving non-Muslim women (and men), as well as encouraged slave's manumission. However, manumission required that the non-Muslim slave first convert to Islam. Non-Muslim slave women who bore children to their Muslim masters became legally free upon her master's death, and her children were presumed to be Muslims as their father, in Africa, and elsewhere.\n\nStarting with the 20th century, Western legal systems evolved to expand women's rights, but women's rights under Islamic law have remained tied to Quran, hadiths and their faithful interpretation as sharia by Islamic jurists.\n\nThe immigration of Muslims to Europe has increased in recent decades and conservative Muslim social attitudes on modern issues have caused controversy in Europe and other parts of the world. Scholars argue about how much these attitudes are a result of culture rather than Islamic beliefs, while some critics consider Islam to be incompatible with secular Western society. Some also believe that Islam positively commands its adherents to impose its religious law on all peoples, believers and unbelievers alike, whenever possible and by any means necessary. Their criticism has been partly influenced by a stance against multiculturalism advocated by recent philosophers, closely linked to the heritage of New Philosophers. Statements by proponents like Pascal Bruckner describe multiculturalism as an invention of an \"enlightened\" elite who deny the benefits of democratic rights to non-Westerners by chaining them to their roots. They also state that multiculturalism allows a degree of religious freedom that exceeds what is needed for personal religious freedom and is conducive to the creation of organizations aimed at undermining European secular or Christian values.\n\nIn 2004, speaking to the Acton Institute on the problems of \"secular democracy\", Cardinal George Pell drew a parallel between Islam and communism: \"Islam may provide in the 21st century, the attraction that communism provided in the 20th, both for those that are alienated and embittered on the one hand and for those who seek order or justice on the other.\" Pell also agrees in another speech that its capacity for far-reaching renovation is severely limited. An Australian Islamist spokesman, Keysar Trad, responded to the criticism: \"Communism is a godless system, a system that in fact persecutes faith\". Geert Wilders, a controversial Dutch member of parliament and leader of the Party for Freedom, has also compared Islam to fascism and communism.\n\n\nWriters such as Stephen Suleyman Schwartz and Christopher Hitchens, find some elements of Islamism fascistic. Malise Ruthven, a Scottish writer and historian who writes on religion and Islamic affairs, opposes redefining Islamism as \"Islamofascism\", but also finds the resemblances between the two ideologies \"compelling\".\n\nFrench philosopher Alexandre del Valle compared Islamism with fascism and communism in his \"Red-green-brown alliance\" theory.\n\nRaymond Leo Burke, a Cardinal-Deacon of the Catholic Church has stated that Islam is not a religion but a totalitarian political system with religious elements which is dedicated to the conquest of the whole world.\n\nJohn Esposito has written a number of introductory texts on Islam and the Islamic world. He has addressed issues including the rise of militant Islam, the veiling of women, and democracy. Esposito emphatically argues against what he calls the \"pan-Islamic myth\". He thinks that \"too often coverage of Islam and the Muslim world assumes the existence of a monolithic Islam in which all Muslims are the same.\" To him, such a view is naive and unjustifiably obscures important divisions and differences in the Muslim world.\n\nWilliam Montgomery Watt in his book \"Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman\" addresses Muhammad's alleged moral failings. Watt argues on a basis of moral relativism that Muhammad should be judged by the standards of his own time and country rather than \"by those of the most enlightened opinion in the West today.\"\n\nKaren Armstrong, tracing what she believes to be the West's long history of hostility toward Islam, finds in Muhammad's teachings a theology of peace and tolerance. Armstrong holds that the \"holy war\" urged by the Quran alludes to each Muslim's duty to fight for a just, decent society.\n\nEdward Said, in his essay \"Islam Through Western Eyes\", stated that the general basis of Orientalist thought forms a study structure in which Islam is placed in an inferior position as an object of study. He claims the existence of a very considerable bias in Orientalist writings as a consequence of the scholars' cultural make-up. He claims Islam has been looked at with a particular hostility and fear due to many obvious religious, psychological and political reasons, all deriving from a sense \"that so far as the West is concerned, Islam represents not only a formidable competitor but also a late-coming challenge to Christianity.\"\n\nCathy Young of Reason Magazine claims that \"criticism of the religion is enmeshed with cultural and ethnic hostility\" often painting the Muslim world as monolithic. While stating that the terms \"Islamophobia\" and \"anti-Muslim bigotry\" are often used in response to legitimate criticism of fundamentalist Islam and problems within Muslim culture, she claimed \"the real thing does exist, and it frequently takes the cover of anti-jihadism.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15316768", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15316768", "title": "Jean-Marc Ela", "text": "Jean-Marc Ela\n\nJean-Marc Ela (27 September 1936 – 26 December 2008) was a sociologist, Diocesan Priest, Professor and author of many books on theology, philosophy, and social sciences in Africa. His most famous work, \"African Cry\" has been called the \"soundest illustration\" of the spirit of liberation theology in sub-Saharan Africa. His works are widely cited as exemplary of sub-Saharan African Christian theology for their focus on contextualisation and their emphasis on community-centered approaches to theology.\n\nHe was buried in his hometown of Ebolowa, Cameroon.\n\nJean-Marc Ela was born on 27 September 1936 in Ebolowa, in the African nation of Cameroon. The son of a middle-class family in southern Cameroon, Ela claimed that he first began to think of theology as a discipline that should be concerned with the local needs of believers while he was studying philosophy and theology in France at the University of Strasbourg in the 1960s. He studied sociology at the University of Strasbourg as well as at the University of Sorbonne. \n\nHowever, it was during his sixteen-year experience as a missionary working among the Kirdi of northwestern Cameroon that he developed and articulated most of the arguments in \"African Cry\" and \"My Faith as an African\". He spent a great deal of his research and of his life beside Baba Simon, beloved minister to the Kirdis of the North Cameroon in Tokombéré. His thesis at Strausburg was on the image of the cross in Luther's theology. \n\nEla was unique in that as a sociologist, he brought a social-science critique to his theology. As a theologian, he proved unorthodox not only in embracing social sciences but also in his penchant for studying topics that tested the boundaries of Catholic orthodoxy. As a missionary, he earned the respect and love of his community in Tokombere. As a Professor, he was popular with students around the globe. He held professorships in Cameroon, Belgium, USA, Canada, Benin, France, and Congo, among other places.\n\nA vocal critic of both ecclesiastical and political institutions, Ela entered voluntary exile in Quebec after the assassination of fellow Cameroonian priest Englebert Mveng in 1995. Ela resided in Montreal, where he served as a Professor of Sociology at the University of Laval at Montreal, from 1995 until his death 26 December 2008, in Vancouver.\n\nFor Jean-Marc Ela and his generation of postcolonial Christian intellectuals in Cameroon, achieving redemption and meaningful spirituality depended fundamentally on acknowledging the value of the everyday practices of pagan village life. This also provided a mechanism of vigilance against destructive external forces.\n\n\"African Cry\" and \"My Faith as an African\", Ela's two most famous works, serve as an indictments of the Catholic Church for holding to a model of faith that ignores the needs of African people, especially those in poor and rural communities. Through an analysis of selected sacraments, missionary structures, and biblical hermeneutics, Ela identified ways in which the Catholic tradition subordinates Africans to a position of dependence vis-a-vis White Europeans. He countered these instances of oppression with opportunities for liberation based on the argument that the Gospel advocates for the restoration of dignity to marginalised people.\n\nAccording to Ela, the only way to restore dignity to African peoples is to allow them to transform Christian traditions into forms that are familiar and useful to Africans. He argued that the Eucharist should be served with local rather than imported products. He believed that African churches should be self-funded. He also believed that biblical interpretation should be guided by a \"shade-tree theology\", in which small groups of believers can gather together to interpret the Gospel in the light of their own particular circumstances.\n\nInterspersed between his hard-hitting theological tones, Ela produced several volumes on social sciences in Africa. He was a science-minded researcher dedicated to opening a conceptual framework to encompass and address the knowledge and the needs of his countrymen. For example, he wrote in 2001 a guide emphatically explaining the imperative African researchers have to direct new research to meeting the basic needs of the population and not only to improve industrial productions. Similarly, in several books published between 1998 and 2007, he showed the place of Africa in the world of rational science, and the necessity of high quality scientific work. In a book published in 2007, he studied and tried to explain the inseparability of knowledge and power and the importance of this for the well-being of Africa.\n\n\n\n"}

The ministry began when the Anglins opened their home to orphans and widows in the province.\n\n1921 Leslie Anglin made a trip to Hopei Province (now Hebei), a severe famine area, to rescue children; included in this group of children was Samuel Hsaio who later traveled widely on behalf of Kids Alive and became the director of the Tsinan Home, the 2nd location in China.\n\n1937 The home had a yearly average of 600 children, 95% of whom graduated from the home’s school.\n\n1948 Dar El Awlad Boys' Home opened in Beirut, Lebanon.\n\n1953 Mission School established in Hong Kong for children of Chinese refuge families; by 1957 there were 350 pupils enrolled.\n\n1962 Hong Kong missionaries started a Home for Boys in the New Territories, with 15 boys.\n\n1975 Civil War began in Lebanon, ending in 1992. KAI continued operating there during this time; children and staff remained safe even though there was some destruction to facilities.\n\n1983 Name changed to Kids Alive International; home office moved to Valparaiso, Indiana.\n\n1992 ANIJA School in Dominican Republic opened with Kindergarten and first grade. Hauna Schools in Hauna Village, Papua New Guinea, affiliated with Kids Alive.\n\n2000 Kids Alive began ministry in Africa, affiliating with the Mt. Kenya Boys’ Home, and a year later opened a children’s home in Lusaka, Zambia.\n\n2004 Kids Alive Peru purchased land for the Care Center in the Manchay slum of Lima, with the goal of identifying and helping single mothers find work to support their kids.\n\nKids Alive Schools\n\nKAI believes that quality education is the only reliable path out of poverty. Their schools vary in many ways depending on the country and community, but all aim to provide the most modern facilities and technology wherever possible, consistent teacher certification and ongoing training, up-to-date curriculum, and stringent safety and security measures. Currently, KAI has schools in Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Haiti, Peru, Kenya, Lebanon, Papua New Guinea, and Zambia.\n\nCare Centers and Medical Clinics\n\nKAI states that care centers “provide quality supervision, stimulating activities, healthy role models, nutritious meals and snacks, help with homework, and counseling when necessary”. Medical clinics provide vaccinations, screenings, nutritional evaluations, basic first aid care, and referrals to community medical facilities for advanced care.\n\nFamily-style Residential Homes\n\nKAI's stated goal is that a child should, if at all possible, remain with his or her natural family. In cases where children are abandoned or appear to be orphans, KAI can work with authorities to locate a child’s parents or other close family members. When a child has no home or is deemed unsafe in their own home because of abuse or exploitation concerns, KAI places them in small, family-style homes with dedicated caregivers.\n“Keeping Families Together”\n\nWhen a child has biological, extended, or adoptive family willing to provide care but unable to afford the basics, KAI offers assistance with nutrition, education, medical care, and sometimes entrepreneurial help. Children are able to remain in a familiar setting with those who love them while receiving advantages their families cannot provide on their own.\n\n\nIn the fiscal year 2016, Kids Alive reported $12,920,490.00 in revenue. Of that amount, 85% went directly to programs and projects, 7.8% to administrative costs, and 7% to fundraising.\n\nKids Alive International has earned Charity Navigator’s 16th consecutive 4-star rating, a rating received by less than 1% of charities evaluated. According to Charity Navigator, this means that KAI outperforms most charities in the US for financial efficiency and transparency. On Charity Navigator’s “Top 10 Charities with the Most Consecutive 4-Star Ratings”, Kids Alive is the only one in its category (International Development and Relief Services) with an overall score of 100.\n\n\n"}

After studying at Rockwell College, the Dominican convent at the Basilica of San Clemente in Rome, and the University of Fribourg, he was ordained to the priesthood on 21 May 1910.\n\nBrowne taught at the Dominican convent in Tallaght, where he was Master of Novices until 1919 when he was appointed professor at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, \"Angelicum\" in Rome.\n\nBrowne served as Prior of the convent of St. Clemente from 1925 to 1930.\n\nHe was the \"Angelicum\"'s rector \"magnificus\" from 1932 to 1941\n\nBrowne was appointed Master of the Sacred Palace from 1951 to 1955.\n\nHe became Master General of the Dominicans on 11 April 1955, remaining in that position until his resignation in 1962.

{"id": "419369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=419369", "title": "Monk", "text": "Monk\n\nA monk (, from , \"monachos\", \"single, solitary\" via Latin \"monachus\") is a person who practices religious asceticism by monastic living, either alone or with any number of other monks. A monk may be a person who decides to dedicate his life to serving all other living beings, or to be an ascetic who voluntarily chooses to leave mainstream society and live his or her life in prayer and contemplation. The concept is ancient and can be seen in many religions and in philosophy.\n\nIn the Greek language the term can apply to women, but in modern English it is mainly in use for men. The word nun is typically used for female monastics.\n\nAlthough the term \"monachos\" is of Christian origin, in the English language \"monk\" tends to be used loosely also for both male and female ascetics from other religious or philosophical backgrounds. However, being generic, it is not interchangeable with terms that denote particular kinds of monk, such as cenobite, hermit, anchorite, hesychast, or solitary.\n\nIn Eastern Orthodoxy monasticism holds a very special and important place: \"Angels are a light for monks, monks are a light for laymen\" (St. John Klimakos). Orthodox monastics separate themselves from the world in order to pray unceasingly for the world. They do not, in general, have as their primary purpose the running of social services, but instead are concerned with attaining theosis, or union with God. However, care for the poor and needy has always been an obligation of monasticism, so not all monasteries are \"cloistered\". The level of contact though will vary from community to community. Hermits, on the other hand, have little or no contact with the outside world.\n\nOrthodox monasticism does not have religious orders as are found in the West, nor do they have Rules in the same sense as the Rule of St. Benedict. Rather, Eastern monastics study and draw inspiration from the writings of the Desert Fathers as well as other Church Fathers; probably the most influential of which are the \"Greater Asketikon\" and \"Lesser Asketikon\" of St. Basil the Great and the \"Philokalia\", which was compiled by St. Nikodemos of the Holy Mountain and St. Makarios of Corinth. Hesychasm is of primary importance in the ascetical theology of the Orthodox Church.\n\nMost communities are self-supporting, and the monastic’s daily life is usually divided into three parts: (a) communal worship in the catholicon (the monastery's main church); (b) hard manual labour; and (c) private prayer, spiritual study, and rest when necessary. Meals are usually taken in common in a sizable dining hall known as a trapeza (refectory), at elongated refectory tables. Food is usually simple and is eaten in silence while one of the brethren reads aloud from the spiritual writings of the Holy Fathers. The monastic lifestyle takes a great deal of serious commitment. Within the cenobitic community, all monks conform to a common way of living based on the traditions of that particular monastery. In struggling to attain this conformity, the monastic comes to realize his own shortcomings and is guided by his spiritual father in how to deal honestly with them. For this same reason, bishops are almost always chosen from the ranks of monks.\n\nEastern monasticism is found in three distinct forms: anchoritic (a solitary living in isolation), cenobitic (a community living and worshiping together under the direct rule of an abbot or abbess), and the \"middle way\" between the two, known as the skete (a community of individuals living separately but in close proximity to one another, who come together only on Sundays and feast days, working and praying the rest of the time in solitude, but under the direction of an elder). One normally enters a cenobitic community first, and only after testing and spiritual growth would one go on to the skete or, for the most advanced, become a solitary anchorite. However, one is not necessarily expected to join a skete or become a solitary; most monastics remain in the cenobium the whole of their lives.\n\nIn general, Orthodox monastics have little or no contact with the outside world, including their own families. The purpose of the monastic life is union with God, the means is through leaving the world (i.e., the life of the passions). After tonsure, Orthodox monks and nuns are never permitted to cut their hair. The hair of the head and the beard remain uncut as a symbol of the vows they have taken, reminiscent of the Nazarites from the Old Testament. The tonsure of monks is the token of a consecrated life, and symbolizes the cutting off of their self-will.\n\nThe process of becoming a monk is intentionally slow, as the vows taken are considered to entail a lifelong commitment to God, and are not to be entered into lightly. In Orthodox monasticism after completing the novitiate, there are three ranks of monasticism. There is only one monastic habit in the Eastern Church (with certain slight regional variations), and it is the same for both monks and nuns. Each successive grade is given a portion of the habit, the full habit being worn only by those in the highest grade, known for that reason as the \"Great Schema\", or \"Great Habit\".\n\nThe various profession rites are normally performed by the Abbot, but if the abbot has not been ordained a priest, or if the monastic community is a convent, a hieromonk will perform the service. The abbot or hieromonk who performs a tonsure must be of at least the rank he is tonsuring into. In other words, only a hieromonk who has been tonsured into the Great Schema may himself tonsure a Schemamonk. A bishop, however, may tonsure into any rank, regardless of his own.\n\n\"Novice\" (Church Slavonic: \"Poslushnik\"), lit. \"one under obedience\"—Those wishing to join a monastery begin their lives as novices. After coming to the monastery and living as a guest for not less than three days, the revered abbot or abbess may bless the candidate to become a novice. There is no formal ceremony for the clothing of a novice, he or she simply receives permission to wear the clothing of a novice. In the Eastern monastic tradition, novices may or may not dress in the black inner cassock (Greek: \"Anterion\", \"Eisorasson\"; Church Slavonic: \"Podriasnik\") and wear the soft monastic hat (Greek: \"Skoufos\", Church Slavonic: \"Skufia\"), depending on the tradition of the local community, and in accordance to the abbot’s directives. The inner-cassock and the skoufos are the first part of the Orthodox monastic habit. In some communities, the novice also wears the leather belt. He is also given a prayer rope and instructed in the use of the Jesus Prayer. If a novice chooses to leave during the period of the novitiate, no penalty is incurred. He may also be asked to leave at any time if his behaviour does not conform to the monastic life, or if the superior discerns that he is not called to monasticism. When the abbot or abbess deems the novice ready, he is asked if he wishes to join the monastery. Some, out of humility, will choose to remain novices all their lives. Every stage of the monastic life must be entered into voluntarily.\n\n\"Rassophore\" (Church Slavonic: \"Ryassofor\"), lit. \"Robe-bearer\"—If the novice continues on to become a monk, he is clothed in the first degree of monasticism at a formal service known as the Tonsure. Although there are no formal vows made at this point, the candidate is normally required to affirm his commitment to persevere in the monastic life. The abbot will then perform the tonsure, cutting a small amount of hair from four spots on the head, forming a cross. He is then given the outer cassock (Greek: \"Rasson\", \"Exorasson\", or \"Mandorasson\"; Church Slavonic: \"Ryassa\")—an outer robe with wide sleeves, something like the cowl used in the West, but without a hood—from which the name of Rassophore is derived. He is also given a brimless hat with a veil, known as a klobuk, and a leather belt is fastened around his waist. His habit is usually black, signifying that he is now dead to the world, and he receives a new name. Although the Rassophore does not make formal vows, he is still morally obligated to continue in the monastic estate for the rest of his life. Some will remain Rassophores permanently without going on to the higher degrees.\n\n\"Stavrophore\" (Church Slavonic: \"Krestonosets\"), lit. \"Cross-bearer\"—The next level for Eastern monastics takes place some years after the first tonsure when the abbot feels the monk has reached an appropriate level of discipline, dedication, and humility. This degree is also known as the \"Little Schema\", and is considered to be a \"betrothal\" to the Great Schema. At this stage, the monk makes formal vows of stability, chastity, obedience and poverty. Then he is tonsured and clothed in the habit, which in addition to that worn by the Rassophore, includes the \"paramandyas\" (Church Slavonic: \"paraman\"), a piece of square cloth worn on the back, embroidered with the instruments of the Passion (see picture above), and connected by ties to a wooden cross worn over the heart. The paramandyas represents the yoke of Christ. Because of this addition he is now called \"Stavrophore\", or \"Cross-bearer\". He is also given a wooden hand cross (or \"profession cross\"), which he should keep in his icon corner, and a beeswax candle, symbolic of monastic vigilance the sacrificing of himself for God. He will be buried holding the cross, and the candle will be burned at his funeral. In the Slavic practice, the Stavrophore also wears the monastic mantle. The rasson (outer robe) worn by the Stavrophore is more ample than that worn by the Rassophore. The abbot increases the Stavrophore monk’s prayer rule, allows a more strict personal ascetic practice, and gives the monk more responsibility.\n\n\"Great Schema\" (Greek: \"Megaloschemos\", Church Slavonic: \"Skhimnik\")—Monks whose abbot feels they have reached a high level of spiritual excellence reach the final stage, called the Great Schema. The tonsure of a Schemamonk follows the same format as the Stavrophore, and he makes the same vows and is tonsured in the same manner. But in addition to all the garments worn by the Stavrophore, he is given the \"Analavos\" (Church Slavonic: \"Analav\") which is the article of monastic vesture emblematic of the Great Schema. For this reason, the analavos itself is sometimes called the \"Great Schema\". The analavos comes down in the front and the back, somewhat like the scapular in Western monasticism, although the two garments are probably not related. It is often intricately embroidered with the instruments of the Passion and the Trisagion (the angelic hymn). The Greek form does not have a hood, the Slavic form has a hood and lappets on the shoulders, so that the garment forms a large cross covering the monk's shoulders, chest, and back. Another piece added is the \"Polystavrion\" or \"Many Crosses\", which consists of a cord with a number of small crosses plaited into it. The polystavrion forms a yoke around the monk and serves to hold the analavos in place, and reminds the monastic that he is bound to Christ and that his arms are no longer fit for worldly activities, but that he must labor only for the Kingdom of Heaven. Among the Greeks, the mantle is added at this stage. The paramandyas of the Megaloschemos is larger than that of the Stavrophore, and if he wears the klobuk, it is of a distinctive thimble shape, called a \"koukoulion\", the veil of which is usually embroidered with crosses. In some monastic traditions the Great Schema is only given to monks and nuns on their death bed, while in others they may be elevated after as little as 25 years of service.\n\nEastern Orthodox monks are addressed as \"Father\" even if they are not priests; but when conversing among themselves, monks will often address one another as \"Brother\". Novices are always referred to as \"Brother\". Among the Greeks, old monks are often called \"Gheronda\", or \"Elder\", out of respect for their dedication. In the Slavic tradition, the title of Elder (Church Slavonic: \"Starets\") is normally reserved for those who are of an advanced spiritual life, and who serve as guides to others.\n\nFor the Orthodox, \"Mother\" is the correct term for nuns who have been tonsured Stavrophore or higher. Novices and Rassophores are addressed as \"Sister\". Nuns live identical ascetic lives to their male counterparts and are therefore also called \"monachai\" (the feminine plural of \"monachos\"), and their community is likewise called a monastery.\n\nMany (but not all) Orthodox seminaries are attached to monasteries, combining academic preparation for ordination with participation in the community's life of prayer, and hopefully benefiting from the example and wise counsel of the monks. Bishops are required by the sacred canons of the Orthodox Church to be chosen from among the monastic clergy. The requirement is specifically that they be monastics, not simply celibate (see clerical celibacy). Monks who have been ordained to the priesthood are called hieromonks (priest-monks); monks who have been ordained to the diaconate are called hierodeacons (deacon-monks). A Schemamonk who is a priest is called a Hieroschemamonk. Most monks are not ordained; a community will normally only present as many candidates for ordination to the bishop as the liturgical needs of the community require.\n\nWithin Roman Catholicism, a monk is a member of a religious order who lives a communal life in a monastery, abbey, or priory under a monastic rule of life (such as the Rule of St. Benedict). St. Benedict of Nursia, (480-543 or 547 AD) is considered to be the founder of western monasticism. He authored the Rule of St. Benedict, which is the foundation for the Order of St. Benedict and all of its reform groups such as the Cistercians and the Trappists. He founded the great Benedictine monastery, Monte Cassino, in 529.\n\nThe religious vows taken in the West were first developed by St. Benedict. These vows were three in number: obedience, conversion of life, and stability. Obedience calls for the monk to obey Christ, as represented by the superior person of the monastery, which is an abbot or prior. Conversion of life means, generally, that the monk convert himself to the way of a monk, which is death to self and to the world and life to God and to his work. A Christian monk is to be an instrument of God's work. Stability entails that the monk commit himself to the monastery for the remainder of his life, and so, upon death, will be buried at its cemetery. The vow of stability is unique to Benedictines.\n\nThe solemn vows in other religious communities were eventually established as vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity. Poverty requires that they renounce any ownership of property or assets, except for items that were allowed to them by their superior (such as a religious habit, shoes, a cloak, etc.), and to live meekly, sharing whatever they might have with the poor. Chastity requires that since they were willing to dedicate their lives to God, they sacrificed the love between men and women and would not marry. Also, they give up any act of sexual conduct.\n\nTo become a monk, one first must become a postulant, during which time the man lives at the monastery to evaluate whether he is called to become a monk. As a postulant, the man is not bound by any vows, and is free to leave the monastery at any time. If the postulant and the community agree that the postulant should become a monk, the man is received as a novice, at which time he is given his religious habit, and begins to participate more fully in the life of the monastery. Following a period as a novice, usually six months to a year, the novice professes temporary vows, which can be renewed for a period of years. After a few years, the monk professes permanent vows, which are binding for life.\n\nThe monastic life generally consists of prayer in the form of the Liturgy of the Hours (also known as the Divine Office) and divine reading (\"lectio divina\") and manual labor. Among most religious orders, monks live in simple, austere rooms called cells and come together daily to celebrate the Conventual Mass and to recite the Liturgy of the Hours. In most communities, the monks take their meals together in the refectory. While there is no vow of silence, many communities have a period of silence lasting from evening until the next morning and some others restrict talking to only when it is necessary for the monks to perform their work and during weekly recreation.\n\nMonks who have been or will be ordained into Holy Orders as priests or deacons are referred to as \"choir monks\", as they have the obligation to recite the entire Divine Office daily in choir. Those monks who are not ordained into Holy Orders are referred to as lay brothers. In most monastic communities today, little distinction exists between the lay brothers and the choir monks. However, historically, the roles of the two groups of monks within the monastery differed. The work of the choir monks was considered to be prayer, chanting the seven hours of the Divine Office and celebrating the Mass daily whereas the lay brothers provided for the material needs of the community by growing food, preparing meals, maintaining the monastery and the grounds. This distinction arose historically because generally those monks who could read Latin typically became choir monks, while those monks who were illiterate or could not read Latin became lay brothers. Since the lay brothers could not recite the Divine Office in Latin, they would instead pray easily memorizable prayers such as the Our Father or the Hail Mary as many as 150 times per day. Since the Second Vatican Council, the distinction between choir monks and lay brothers has been deemphasized, as the council allowed the Divine Office to be said in the vernacular language, effectively opening participation to all of the monks.\n\nWithin western monasticism, it is important to differentiate between monks and friars. Monks generally live a contemplative life of prayer confined within a monastery while friars usually engage in an active ministry of service to the outside community. The monastic orders include all Benedictines (the Order of Saint Benedict and its later reforms including the Cistercians and the Trappists) and the Carthusians, who live according to their own Statutes, and not according to the Rule of St. Benedict proper. Orders of friars include the Franciscans, Dominicans, Carmelites, and Augustinians. Although the Canons Regular, such as the Norbertines, live in community, they are neither monks nor friars as they are characterized by their clerical state and not by any monastic vows.\n\nMonastic life in England came to an abrupt end when King Henry VIII broke from the Roman Catholic Church and made himself the head of the Church of England. He initiated the Dissolution of the Monasteries, during which all of the monasteries within England were destroyed. A large number of monks were executed, others fled to continental European monasteries where they were able to continue their monastic life.\n\nShortly after the beginning of the revival of the Catholic Movement in the Church of England, there was felt to be a need for a restoration of the monastic life. In the 1840s, the then Anglican priest and future Catholic Cardinal John Henry Newman established a community of men at Littlemore near Oxford. From then on, there have been established many communities of monks, friars and other religious communities for men in the Anglican Communion. There are Anglican Benedictines, Franciscans, Cistercians, and in the Episcopal Church in the United States, Dominicans. There are also uniquely Anglican monastic orders such as the Society of Saint John the Evangelist and the Community of the Resurrection at Mirfield.\n\nSome Anglican religious communities are contemplative, some active, but a distinguishing feature of the monastic life among Anglicans is that most practice the so-called \"mixed life\". Anglican monks recite the Divine Office in choir daily, either the full eight services of the Breviary or the four offices found in the Book of Common Prayer and celebrate the Eucharist daily. Many orders take on external works such as service to the poor, giving religious retreats, or other active ministries within their immediate communities. Like Roman Catholic monks, Anglican monks also take the monastic vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience.\n\nIn the early 20th century when the Catholic Movement was at its height, the Anglican Communion had hundreds of orders and communities and thousands of religious followers. However, since the 1960s there has been a sharp falling off in the numbers of religious in many parts of the Anglican Communion. Many once large and international communities have been reduced to a single convent or monastery composed of elderly men or women. In the last few decades of the 20th century, novices have for most communities been few and far between. Some orders and communities have already become extinct.\n\nThere are however, still several thousand Anglican monks working today in approximately 200 communities around the world. The most surprising growth has been in the Melanesian countries of the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea. The Melanesian Brotherhood, founded at Tabalia, Guadalcanal, in 1925 by Ini Kopuria, is now the largest Anglican community in the world with over 450 brothers in the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and the United Kingdom.\n\nLoccum Abbey and Amelungsborn Abbey have the longest traditions as Lutheran monasteries. Since the 19th and 20th century, there has been a renewal in the monastic life among Lutheranism. There are many present-day Lutherans who practice the monastic teaching of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn American Lutheran traditions, \"The Congregation of the Servants of Christ\" was established at St. Augustine's House in Oxford, Michigan, in 1958 when some other men joined Father Arthur Kreinheder in observing the monastic life and offices of prayer. These men and others came and went over the years. The community has always remained small; at times the only member was Father Arthur. During the 35 years of its existence over 25 men tested their vocations to monastic life by living at the house for some time, from a few months to many years, but at Father Arthur's death in 1989 only one permanent resident remained. At the beginning of 2006, there was 2 permanent professed members and 2 long-term guests. Strong ties remain with this community and their brothers in Sweden (Östanbäck monastery) and in Germany (Priory of St. Wigbert).\n\nThere is also the Order of Lutheran Franciscans, a religious community of friars and sisters within the tradition of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.\n\nIn Theravada Buddhism, \"bhikkhu\" is the term for monk. Their disciplinary code is called the \"patimokkha\", which is part of the larger \"Vinaya\". They live lives of mendicancy, and go on a morning almsround (Pali: \"pindapata\") every day. The local people give food for the monks to eat, though the monks are not permitted to positively ask for anything. The monks live in monasteries, and have an important function in traditional Asian society. Young boys can be ordained as samaneras. Both bhikkhus and samaneras eat only in the morning, and are not supposed to lead a luxurious life. Their rules forbid the use of money, although this rule is nowadays not kept by all monks. The monks are part of the \"Sangha\", the third of the Triple Gem of Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha.\n\nIn Mahayana Buddhism, the term 'Sangha' strictly speaking refers to those who have achieved certain levels of understanding. They are therefore called 'community of the excellent ones' (); however, these in turn need not be monks (i.e., hold such vows). Several Mahayana orders accept female practitioners as monks, instead of using the normal title of \"nun\", and they are considered equal to male ascetics in all respects.\n\nThe Bhikkhus are only allowed 4 items \"(other than their robes)\": a razor, a needle, an alms bowl and a water strainer. \n\nIn Vajrayana Buddhism, monkhood is part of the system of 'vows of individual liberation'; these vows are taken in order to develop one's own personal ethical discipline. The monks and nuns form the (ordinary) \"sangha\". As for the Vajrayana vows of individual liberation, there are four steps: A lay person may take the 5 vows called 'approaching virtue' (in Tibetan <nowiki>'</nowiki>\"genyen\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> < \"dge snyan\">). The next step is to enter the monastic way of life (Tib. \"rabjung\") which includes wearing monk's or nun's robes. After that, one can become a 'novice' (Pali \"samanera\", Tib. \"getshül\"); the last and final step is to take all vows of the 'fully ordained monk' (\"gelong\"). This term 'gelong' (Tib. < \"dge long\">, in the female form \"gelongma\") is the translation of Skt. \"bikshu\" (for women \"bikshuni\") which is the equivalent of the Pali term \"bhikkhuni\"; \"bhikkhu\" is the word used in Theravada Buddhism (Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand).\nChinese Buddhist monks have been traditionally and stereotypically linked with the practice of the Chinese martial arts or \"Kung fu\", and monks are frequently important characters in martial arts films. This association is focused around the Shaolin Monastery. The Buddhist monk Bodhidharma, traditionally credited as the founder of Zen Buddhism in China, is also claimed to have introduced Kalaripayattu (which later evolved into Kung Fu) to the country. This latter claim has however been a source of much controversy (see Bodhidharma, the martial arts, and the disputed India connection) One more feature about the Chinese Buddhist monks is that they practice the burning marks on their scalp, finger or part of the skin on their anterior side of the forearm with incense as a sign of ordination.\n\nIn Thailand and Burma, it is common for boys to spend some time living as a monk in a monastery. Most stay for only a few years and then leave, but a number continue on in the ascetic life for the rest of their lives.\n\nIn Mongolia during the 1920s, there were about 110,000 monks, including children, who made up about one-third of the male population, many of whom were killed in the purges of Choibalsan.\n\nOne of the most intense forms of Asceticism can be found in Jainism, one of the world's oldest religions. Jainism encourages fasting, yoga practices, meditation in difficult postures, and other austerities. According to Jains, one's highest goal should be attaining Nirvana or Moksha (i.e., liberation from samsara, the cycle of birth and rebirth). For this, a soul has to be without attachment or self-indulgence. This can be achieved only by the monks and nuns who take five great vows: of non-violence, of truth, of non-stealing, of non-possession and of celibacy.\n\nMost of the austerities and ascetic practices can be traced back to Vardhaman Mahavira, the twenty-fourth \"fordmaker\" or Tirthankara. The Acaranga Sutra, or Book of Good Conduct, is a sacred book within Jainism that discusses the ascetic code of conduct. Other texts that provide insight into conduct of ascetics include Yogashastra by Acharya Hemachandra and Niyamasara by Acharya Kundakunda. Other illustrious Jain works on ascetic conduct are \"Oghanijjutti, Pindanijjutti, Cheda Sutta, and Nisiha Suttafee.\"\n\nFull Jain monk in either Svetambara or Digambara tradition can belong to one of these ranks:\n\nThese three are mentioned is the three lines of the Namokar Mantra. In the Digambara tradition, a junior monk can be a:\n\nThe Svetambar Terapanthi sect has a new rank of junior monks who are called samana. The nuns are called Aryikas in Digambar tradition and Sadhvi in the Svetambar tradition.\n\nAs per the Jain vows, the monks and nuns renounce all relations and possessions. Jain ascetics practice complete non-violence. \"Ahimsa\" is the first and foremost vow of a Jain ascetic. They do not hurt any living being, be it an insect or a human. They carry a special broom to sweep away any insects that may cross their path. Some Jain monks wear a cloth over the mouth to prevent accidental harm to airborne germs and insects. They also do not use electricity as it involves violence. Furthermore, they do not use any devices or machines.\n\nAs they are without possession and attachment, they travel from city to city, often crossing forests and deserts, and always barefoot. Jain ascetics do not stay in a single place for more than two months to prevent themselves from becoming attached to any location. However, during four months of monsoon (rainy season) known as chaturmaas, they continue to stay in a single place to avoid killing the life forms that thrive during the rains.\nJain monks and nuns practice complete celibacy. They do not touch or share a sitting platform with a person of opposite sex.\n\nJain ascetics follow a strict vegetarian diet without root vegetables. Shvetambara monks do not cook food but solicit alms from householders. Digambara monks have only a single meal a day. Neither group will beg for food, but a Jain ascetic may accept a meal from a householder, provided that the latter is pure of mind and body and offers the food of his own volition and in the prescribed manner. During such an encounter, the monk remains standing and eats only a measured amount. Fasting (i.e., abstinence from food and sometimes water) is a routine feature of Jain asceticism. Fasts last for a day or longer, up to a month. Some monks avoid (or limit) medicine or hospitalization due to their careful attention to body.\n\nOther austerities include meditation in seated or standing posture near river banks in the cold wind, or meditation atop hills and mountains, especially at noon when the sun is at its fiercest. Such austerities are undertaken according to the physical and mental limits of the individual ascetic. Jain ascetics are (almost) completely without possessions. Some Jains (Shvetambara monks and nuns) own only unstitched white robes (an upper and lower garment) and a bowl used for eating and collecting alms. Male Digambara monks do not wear any clothes and carry nothing with them except a soft broom made of shed peacock feathers (pinchi) and eat from their hands. They sleep on the floor without blankets and sit on special wooden platforms.\n\nEvery day is spent either in study of scriptures or meditation or teaching to lay people. They stand aloof from worldly matters. Many Jain ascetics take a final vow of Santhara or Sallekhana (i.e., a peaceful and detached death where medicines, food, and water are abandoned). This is done when death is imminent or when a monk feels that he is unable to adhere to his vows on account of advanced age or terminal disease.\n\nQuotes on ascetic practices from the Akaranga Sutra as Hermann Jacobi translated it:\n\nMadhvaacharya (Madhvacharya), the Dwaita philosopher, established \"ashta matha\" (Eight Monasteries). He appointed a monk (called \"swamiji\" or \"swamigalu\" in local parlance) for each \"matha\" or monastery who has the right to worship Madhvacharya's murti of Lord Krishna by rotation. Each matha's swamiji gets a chance to worship after fourteen years. This ritual is called \"Paryaya\" and has been used also outside his sampradaya, e.g. in Gaudiya Vaisnava Radharamana temple in Vrindavan.\n\nSimilar in appearance to Buddhist monks, brahmacari monks from the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), or Hare Krishnas as they are popularly known, are the best known Vaishnava monks outside India. They are a common sight in many places around the world. Their appearance—simple saffron \"dhoti\", shaved head with \"sikha\", \"Tulasi\" neckbeads and \"tilaka\" markings—and social customs (\"sadhana\") date back many thousands of years to the Vedic era with its \"varnasrama\" society. This social scheme includes both monastic and lay stages meant for various persons in various stages of life as per their characteristics (\"guna\") and work (\"karma\").\n\nISKCON started as a predominantly monastic group but nowadays the majority of members live as lay persons. Many of them, however, spent some time as monks. New persons joining ISKCON as full-time members (living in its centers) first undergo a three-month \"Bhakta\" training, which includes learning the basics of brahmacari (monastic) life. After that they can decide if they prefer to continue as monks or as married \"Grihasthas\".\n\nBrahmacari older than fifty years (as per ISKCON rule) can become \"sannyasi\". \"Sannyasa\", a life of full dedication to spiritual pursuits, is the highest stage of life in the \"varnasrama\" society. It is permanent and one cannot give it up. A Sannyasi is given the title Swami. Older grihastha with grown-up children are traditionally expected to accept \"vanaprastha\" (celibate retired) life.\n\nThe role of monastic orders in Indian and now also Western society has to some extent been adapted over the years in accordance with ever-changing social structures.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It began in Houston, Texas in 1992 as a way for users of the Brewers' Witch BBS to meet face to face, Pagan's Night Out has become a worldwide phenomena. Held in bars, pubs, coffee shops, cafes, restaurants and meeting halls, PNO is a social event for Wiccans, Asatruar, Thelemites, Druids, Setians and the hundreds of other Neopagan sects and sub-divisions.\n\nThe Brewers' Witch Bulletin Board System was started in May 1992, running on a DOS PC using the Waffle BBS software and a single phone line. It was one of three Pagan-oriented BBSs in Houston at that time and, thanks to its USENET newsgroups and email, quickly became a favorite haunt of the online Neopagans there. Later expanding to 5 phone lines and an ISDN feed running on a FreeBSD UNIX system, the BBS eventually spawned a webpage and, as the BBS era came to a close, moved totally onto the newly emerging Internet. In its time the website garnered numerous 'Net awards including Pagan Best of the Web, and the BBS was featured in Boardwatch Magazine. Although the dialup BBS ceased operations in 1998, and\nthe website saw the end of its heyday by 2000, the website still exists in a mostly static form. At their Beltaine celebration in 2005, Donal, the BBS's SysAdmin, received the first Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council of Magickal Arts for his work on The Brewers' Witch BBS and Pagan's Night Out, as well as his work creating the USENET newsgroup, soc.religion.paganism. Donal was the author of the newsgroup RFD and charter, and husbanded the newsgroup through its creation.\n\nDonal had quickly realized that many tensions existed between the members of various traditions that were using his BBS and, influenced by a regular weekly party held by a chat board he was familiar with, decided to get his users together for a casual social outing to try to get them to view each other as friends first and practitioners of widely differing faiths second. The announcement on his BBS regarding Pagan's Night Out, made a few weeks before the suggested date, said everyone should \"leave the Bolines and starched robes at home\", meaning there was to be no discussion of inter-tradition politics.\n\nThe first PNO was held on August 25, 1992 in Houston, Texas, with barely more than a dozen in attendance. By the next year monthly attendance was closer to 50 with occasional \"special\" PNO's (such as Yule and Samhain celebrations) exceeding 120.\n\nA PNO was started in the Washington, DC, area in 1998 when a resident from Houston moved to the nation's capital and wanted to offer a similar program for Pagans in the area. Originally sponsored by the now defunct Mystic District Planning Coalition, the DC area PNO is currently sponsored by The Open Hearth Foundation. The DC-PNO originally met on the 13th of each month and rotated locations among DC, Northern Virginia, and suburban Maryland. It now meets on the third Friday of the month.\n\nToday there are PNOs all over the world and in every major city in the United States, even one that meets on a U.S. aircraft carrier. The U.S military has been instrumental in this spread and most non-U.S. PNOs are found on or near military bases.\n\nEven through the internet age, PNO's were one of the only places people could come out of the 'broom closet' and talk with other Pagans and Neopagans. For those that aren't associated with other circles or covens, this was a very helpful place for the solitary practitioner to meet others in their area face to face. Pagan's Night Out began social networking with unaffiliated Pagans which would allow others to share ideas, discuss activities and even hold open rituals. It is perhaps the widely most used medium for in-person networking in the Pagan social scene.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "217045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=217045", "title": "Sama (Sufism)", "text": "Sama (Sufism)\n\nSama (, Persian, Urdu and - \"samā‘\") is a Sufi ceremony performed as dhikr. Sama means \"listening\", while \"dhikr\" means \"remembrance\". These rituals often include singing, playing instruments, dancing, recitation of poetry and prayers, wearing symbolic attire, and other rituals. It is a particularly popular form of worship in Sufism.\n\nIn 2008, UNESCO confirmed the \"Mevlevi Sama Ceremony\" of Turkey as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.\n\nThis term stems from the root-verb meaning \"acceptance by tradition\", from which derives the words سَمْع (\"sam‘\") and اِسْتِمَاع (\"’istimā‘\", listening), often paired with نَقْل (\"naql\") and تَقْلِيد (\"taqlīd\", tradition). It may have been in use since the 10th century to refer to a type of \"dhikr\" (remembrance of God), a \"spiritual concert\", a ceremony used by various Sufi orders, particularly the Chishti order of the sub-continent. It often involves prayer, song and dance.\n\nThe origination of Sama in the Mevlevi Order of Turkish Sufis credited to Rumi, Sufi master and creator of the Mevlevis. The story of the creation of this unique form of dhikr is that Rumi was walking through the town marketplace one day when he heard the rhythmic hammering of the goldbeaters. It is believed that Rumi heard the dhikr, \"la ilaha ilallah\" or in English, \"There is no god but Allah \" in the apprentices beating of the gold and so entranced in happiness he stretched out both of his arms and started spinning in a circle (sufi whirling). With that the practice of Sama and the dervishes of the Mevlevi order were born.\n\nSimilarly, Abu Sa`id, (357 A.H.) (967 c.e.) was born in Mayhana, a town near Sarakhs, which today is in Iran, bordering Turkmanistan. He is noted for establishing a rule for conduct in the khanqah and also for the introduction of music (sama'), poetry and dance, as part of the Sufi collective devotional ritual of dhikr.\n\nThe Whirling Dervishes of the Mevlevi order are probably the best-known practitioners of Sama. Mevlevi practitioners of sema are adult initiates into the order, which historically only meant men. Participants move as a group in a circle while also turning each individually.\n\nSema is prominent in the ceremonies of the Alevi community of Turkey and the closely related Bektashi Order. \n\nThe most common forms of Alevi sema include kirklar semahı (sema of the forty) and turnalar semahı (crane sema). They are performed by both male and female teenagers, often in mixed groups, and participants turn facing each other in pairs or small groups and do not necessarily whirl as individuals. Many cemeviler (Alevi meetinghouses) have organized sema groups that perform at events such as the annual Hacı Bektaş Veli Festival.\n\nIn Egypt, the Mevlevi form of Sama is known as tannoura and has been adopted (with some modifications) by other Sufi orders as well. It is also performed as a folk and concert dance.\n\nThe Sama represents a mystical journey of man's spiritual ascent through mind and love to perfection. Turning towards the truth, the follower grows through love, deserts his ego, finds the truth and arrives at perfection. He then returns from this spiritual journey as a man who has reached maturity and a greater perfection, so as to love and to be of service to the whole of creation.\nRumi has said in reference to Sama', \"For them it is the Sama' of this world and the other. Even more for the circle of dancers within the Sama' who turn and have in their midst, their own Ka'aba.\" This relates Sama' to the pilgrimage to Mecca, in that both are intended to bring all who are involved closer to God.\n\nSama emphasizes singing, but also includes the playing of instruments, particularly for introductions and accompaniments. However, only instruments which are symbolic and not considered profane are used. The most common of these are the tambourine, bells, and flute. It often includes the singing of hymns, called \"qawl\" and \"bayt\". Poetry is often included in the ceremony as well, because while it is inadequate by itself, it works together with aid in spiritual contemplation. Any poetry, even the erotic, can be applied to God, and thus used for this ceremony. However, the listener's heart must first be pure, or the dancing components of sama' will make these people full of lust instead of love for God. Additionally, being in love with a person rather than with God clouds a person's mind when they are listening to erotic poetry. Verses from the Qur'an are never used for this purpose, and not only because their meanings are said to be somewhat dulled through repetition. Qur'anic verses are never to be set to meditation, nor ornamented or improvised in any way, so that they remain sacred texts.\n\nSama is a means of meditating on God through focusing on melodies and dancing. It brings out a person's love of God, purifies the soul, and is a way of finding God. This practice is said to reveal what is already in one's heart, rather than creating emotions. All of a person's doubt disappears, and the heart and soul can communicate directly with God. The immediate goal of sama' is to reach \"wajd\", which is a trance-like state of ecstasy. Physically, this state may include various and unexpected movements, agitation, and all types of dancing.\nAnother state that people hope to reach through sama' is \"khamra\", which means \"spiritual drunkenness\".\nUltimately, people hope to achieve the unveiling of mysteries and gain spiritual knowledge through \"wajd\".\nSometimes, the experience of \"wajd\" becomes so strong that fainting or even, in extreme circumstances, death, occurs.\n\nParticipants in sama are expected to remain silent and still, and controlled throughout the ceremony, unless wajd occurs. This way, a higher degree of spiritual contemplation can be reached. Participants must restrain themselves from movement and crying until they reach a point in which they can no longer hold back. At this point, wajd can be reached. It is essential that the trance-like experience of wajd be genuine and not faked for any reason. Also, people must maintain proper intent and actions must be present throughout the sama'; otherwise, they cannot experience the ceremony's intended positive effects.\n\nMuslims are divided into two groups regarding the issue of sama and the use of music in general: 1) Opponents, particularly of the Salafi/Wahabbi sect. 2) Advocates, who are of the majority Sunnis.\n\nAdvocates view chants as a required practice for spiritual growth. Al-Ghazzali wrote a chapter entitled \"Concerning Music and Dancing as Aids to the Religious Life\", where he emphasized how the practices of music and dance are beneficial to Muslims, as long as their hearts are pure before engaging in these practices.\n\nOpponents find music as an Innovation bidah and associated with infidelity. They compare the physical sensations experienced by a person in the state of wajd to a state of physical drunkenness, and therefore do not condone it.\n\nDue to differences in culture between Muslim groups, participation in musical performance is condoned in some and considered questionable in others. Meditation and Sufi practices are allowed in Islam as long as they are within the limits of the Shari'ah (Islamic law).\nPeople from all classes and walks of life can participate, although there is debate between Sufis and legalists about whether novice Sufis and ones more advanced in their faith are capable of achieving the same positive results from sama'. The same debate exists for the young, and whether they are capable of overcoming their lust and clearing their hearts to worship God.\n\n\n"}

His parents were Mírzá Muḥsin Afnán, a cousin of the Báb, and Túbá Khánum. His maternal grandparents were `Abdu'l-Bahá, the successor to the Bahá'í founder-prophet Bahá'u'lláh, and Munirih Khánum. Soheil Afnan received his initial education at the LaSallian Collège des Frères in Haifa and later at the American University of Beirut, where he would graduate in 1923. He would continue to the Sorbonne and Oxford University but financial constraints imposed due the death of his father as well as the onset of World War II curtailed his studies at those institutions. Despite having been declared a Covenant-breaker by his first cousin Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, in 1971 Soheil Afnan established a scholarship, the Fuad Muhsin Afnan Memorial Fund, for \"Bahai students in need\" at the American University of Beirut in honor of his younger brother who died in 1941 during an aerial bombardment in London where he was volunteering as an Air Raid Warden. Soheil Afnan never married and did not have any children.\n\nIn 1947, Soheil Afnan produced the first direct translation of Aristotle’s Poetics from the Greek into Persian. Upon seeing this work, the Iranian poet Mehdi Akhavan-Sales serialized this translation in the literary magazine \"Iran-e Ma\" (\"Our Iran\"), of which he was the editor. He praised Soheil Afnan with a poem published at the end of the series which was also published in his 1951 collection \"Arghanoon\" (ارغنون), which literally translates as Organon.\n\nSoheil Afnan obtained his PhD from Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1956, and was a lecturer in Persian at the University of Cambridge from 1958 to 1961, where he collaborated with Arthur John Arberry. He continued to produce academic works, including translations and lexicons of philosophical terminology. As late as 2006, Seyyed Hossein Nasr noted in his work \"Islamic Philosophy from Its Origin to the Present,\" that \"There is not in fact even one satisfactory philosophical dictionary of Arabic and Persian terms with English equivalents. The only work of this kind available is that of Suhail Afnan, \"A Philosophical Lexicon in Persian and Arabic\" (Dar al Mashreq, Beirut, 1969). This work is, however, far from being adequate, especially as far as technical vocabulary of later schools of Islamic philosophy is concerned.\"\n\nSoheil Afnan passed away in 1990 in Istanbul where he was conducting research at the Topkapı Palace library.\n\n"}

He designed the role-playing game \"GURPS\" and the card game \"Munchkin\".\n\nSteve Jackson is a 1974 graduate of Rice University, where he was a resident of Baker College before moving to Sid Richardson College when it opened in 1971. Jackson briefly attended the UT Law School, but left to pursue a career in game design.\n\nWhile working at Metagaming Concepts, Jackson developed \"Monsters! Monsters!\" (\"ca\"1976) based on a design by Ken St. Andre related to his \"Tunnels & Trolls\" role-playing game, and \"Godsfire\" (1976), a 3D space conquest game designed by Lynn Willis. Jackson's first design for the company was \"Ogre\" (1977), followed by \"G.E.V.\" (1978), which were set in the same futuristic universe that Jackson created.\n\nJackson became interested in \"Dungeons & Dragons\", but found the various-sized dice irritating and the combat rules confusing and unsatisfying, and did not like the lack of tactics, so he designed \"Melee\" in response. Jackson joined the SCA to gain a better understanding of combat, but he soon became more interested and started fighting in SCA live-action combat as Vargskol, the Viking-Celt. Metagaming also published his game \"Wizard\".\n\nWhile designing \"Melee\", Jackson realized this idea could be expanded into a full fantasy role-playing game to compete with \"D&D\", and started working on \"The Fantasy Trip\". While the game was originally scheduled for release in February 1978, the design and development required more work than Jackson had anticipated and the game was not released until March 1980. Howard Thompson, owner of Metagaming, decided to release \"The Fantasy Trip\" as four separate books instead of a boxed set, and changed his production methods so that Jackson would not be able to check the final proofs of the game. As a result of these actions, Jackson left Metagaming and founded Steve Jackson Games later that year.\n\nHis game \"Raid on Iran\" was an immediate success. Jackson bought \"The Space Gamer\" from Metagaming, and sold the rights to \"The Fantasy Trip\" to Metagaming. However, Thompson sought legal action against SJG for the rights to a short wargame called \"One-Page Bulge\", and the lawsuit was settled with an agreement that was reached on November 26, 1981 which gave Jackson full rights to \"One-Page Bulge\", and to \"Ogre\" and \"G.E.V.\" (whose ownership was questioned during the legal proceedings). Jackson tried to purchase \"The Fantasy Trip\" from Thompson after Metagaming ceased operations in April 1983, but Thompson declined the offered price of $250,000.\n\nJackson designed or co-designed many of the games published by SJ Games, including minigames such as \"Car Wars\" (1981) and \"Illuminati\" (1983), \"Undead\" (1981), and a published version of an informal game played on college campuses, called \"\". Jackson wanted to get into computer gaming software in the early 1980s, but instead wound up licensing gaming rights to Origin Systems, which produced games such as \"Autoduel\" (1985) and \"Ogre\" (1986).\n\nJackson became interested in designing and publishing a new roleplaying system in the middle of 1981, intending it to be detailed and realistic, logical and well-organized, and adaptable to any setting and any level of play; he announced \"GURPS\" in 1983, although the company's magazines delayed development of \"GURPS\" until 1984, making the combat system book \"\" (1985) available for Origins 1985, and the full \"GURPS Basic Set\" appeared the next year in 1986. In 1995, Sean Punch took over for Jackson as the \"GURPS\" line editor.\n\nJackson also designed the strategy card games \"Munchkin\" (2001) and Ninja Burger (2003), and the dice games Zombie Dice (2010) and Cthulhu Dice (2010), as well as Zombie Dice variants Trophy Buck (2011) and Dino Hunt Dice (2013).\n\nJackson has exhibited his elaborate Chaos Machine at several science fiction or wargaming conventions, including the 2006 Worldcon.\n\nOn May 11, 2012, Steve Jackson's Kickstarter funding project for the 6th Edition of his \"Ogre\" game became the highest grossing boardgame project at Kickstarter, with 5,512 backers pledging a total of $923,680. The success of the \"Ogre Designer's Edition\" project has prompted a new project (date of start/finish unknown at this time) to help re-launch the popular \"Car Wars\" franchise as well. The use of Kickstarter as a combination of market research tool and funding program for development is a first in the gaming industry.\n\nJackson is often mistaken for Steve Jackson, a British gamebook and video game writer who co-founded Games Workshop. The confusion is exacerbated by the fact that while the UK Jackson was co-creator of the \"Fighting Fantasy\" gamebook series, the US Jackson also wrote three books in this series (\"Scorpion Swamp\", \"Demons of the Deep\", and \"Robot Commando\"), and the books did not acknowledge that this was a different 'Steve Jackson'.\n\nOn March 1, 1990, the United States Secret Service raided the offices of Steve Jackson Games based on suspicion of illegal hacker activity by game designer Loyd Blankenship, and seized (among other materials and media) his manuscript for \"GURPS Cyberpunk\"; when Jackson went to Secret Service headquarters the next day to retrieve his book drafts, he was told that \"GURPS Cyberpunk\" was a \"handbook for computer crime\", despite his protestations that it was just a game. SJG filed a successful lawsuit against the government, which went to trial in 1993 as \"Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service\", which was made possible through the newly created civil-rights organization Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nJackson is an avid collector of pirate-themed Lego sets. He has written a miniatures game that uses Pirate sets, \"Evil Stevie's Pirate Game\", and has run it at several conventions.\n\nJackson has combined his fondness for model trains and LEGO through the LEGO train community and has been an active member of several LEGO Users Groups including TBRR (Texas Brick Railroad) and the Texas LEGO Users Group.\n\n\nHe was honored as a \"famous game designer\" by being featured as the king of clubs in Flying Buffalo's 2011 Famous Game Designers Playing Card Deck.\n\n"}

Sprague de Camp\" (Doubleday, 1978). The story has been translated into French and German.\n\nVirgil Hathaway, a Penobscot Indian shopkeeper in Gahato, New York, receives an odd visitor, Charlie Catfish of the Senecas. The fast-talking Catfish, caretaker to eight \"Gahunga\", quickly pawns his charges off on Hathaway before leaving. \"You can handle 'em even though you're Algonquin,\" he says, \"being as you're a descendant of Dekanawida.\" Hathaway is confused, but soon enough the Gahunga, stone-throwing spirits resembling miniature Iroquois warriors, appear to introduce themselves. Gaga, their chief, asks if there's anything Hathaway wants them to do.\n\nAnnoyed at the trick Catfish sprung on him, Virgil initially tells them to disappear, but later admits he would like more customers to come in and buy his Indian curios. Soon townspeople out on the street, pelted with pebbles by unseen assailants, are being driven into the shop. They are understandably perturbed, and some suspect Hathaway of having something to do with the situation. After calming them, he angrily orders Gaga to stop, and tells him he doesn't want any more favors. The Gahunga, offended, proclaim they will find someone who better appreciates them, and disappear. Hathaway worries. He tries to call them back, but they fail to respond.\n\nLater, on leaving the shop, Hathaway hears of a number of inexplicable occurrences, all the result of the Gahunga invisibly attempting to \"help\" people, but causing more harm than good. The shopkeeper is again suspected, this time because of his earlier success in halting the stone throwing. The next day he researches the Gahunga in the public library of nearby Utica, learning that Iroquois shamans know how to control them. He rings up the Tonawanda Reservation for advice.\n\nOn returning to Gahato that evening Hathaway learns the Gahunga have been at it again when sawmill owner Dan Pringle runs into his shop. He had been at a phony seance conducted by his son Harvey's girlfriend Barbara Scott, whom he dislikes, only to see it disrupted by apparent evil spirits, which then drove him down the street with well-placed pebbles. Recalling the rumors current about Hathaway, Pringle appeals to him for help. Virgil realizes the Gahunga must have been trying to \"help\" the young lovers against the disapproving parent.\n\nThis time he knows what to do. With an offering of tobacco and a chant in bad Seneca, he summons the Gahunga and threatens them with retribution from Eitsinoha, the Iroquois earth goddess for their misbehavior. The Gahunga are cowed and promise not to do anything more unless he tells them to. As a result of his aid Hathaway is able to wrangle a lower rent from Pringle, who is also his landlord. He begins to think the medicine man business may not be so bad after all—maybe it has commercial possibilities!\n\nEverett F. Bleiler, reviewing \"The Reluctant Shaman and Other Fantastic Tales\", found the title story's background of Indian lore \"particularly interesting,\" and praised the collection as a whole for its \"well-handled humor.\"\n\n\"The Reluctant Shaman\" is the second of a number of contemporary fantasy stories de Camp set in the fictional town of Gahato and the surrounding Adirondack region of New York, the others being \"The Hardwood Pile\" (\"Unknown\", Sep. 1940) and some of his Willy Newbury stories, notably \"The Lamp\" (\"Fantasy and Science Fiction\", March 1975), \"Algy\" (\"Fantastic\", Aug. 1976), \"Darius\" (\"Escape!,\" fall 1977) and \"The Huns\" (\"Fantasy and Science Fiction\", May 1978).

The tomb was discovered in 2003 in the east of Jingshang village in Daminggong township, Weiyang District, Xi'an, and excavated between June and October in the same year. It is especially significant for the rich content of the reliefs on the stone structure contained in the tomb and a bilingual epitaph.\n\nThe bilingual epitaph written in Classical Chinese and Sogdian language sheds light on the life of an 86-year-old man named Wirkak (493–579 AD) in Sogdian, but Shi Jun in Chinese, and his wife Wiyusi. The name is composed of the surname with the honourific or \"master\". The couple came from the and the State of Kang (Samarkand origin) respectively. In his lifetime, Wirkak served as a in the ancient province of Liangzhou, or today's city of Wuwei, a once-booming hub of international trade on the Silk Road. () is a Chinese translation of the Sogdian term , meaning a \"caravan leader\", but later became the title of an administrator in charge of the international and foreign religious affairs of Central Asian immigrants who settled in China at the time.\n\nAccording to the epitaph, Wirkak had lived in the Western Regions but had moved to Chang'an. His grandfather, (, ), had been a sabao in his native land. His father, named (, ), but no offce is listed for him. Wirkak was appointed as chief of the judicial department of the sabao bureau in the Datong reign (535–546) during the Liang dynasty, then in the 5th year of the same reign (539), he was made sabao of Liangzhou. He died in 579 at the age of 86; his wife Wiyusi died a month later. The tomb was built by their three sons, and the interment took place one year later in 580.\n\nThe total length of the tomb was 47.26 metres, with long slope path and yard faces south with an azimuth of 186º. It consists of ramp, yard, tunnel, a corridor and a chamber. The number of the yards and the tunnels are both five. The corridor measures 2.8 m long, 1.5 m wide and 1.9 m high with an arch ceiling. The chamber has a rectangular plan, it is 3.7 m long from the east to the west and 3.5 m from the north to the south.\n\nThere are two sealed gates of bricks and stones between the ramp and the chamber. The lintel and side posts of the stone gate are carved with interlocking grape and acanthus patterns, celestial musicians and lokapalas. Mural paintings can be seen in the ramping passage way and the chamber, however, the subjects are undistinguishable owing to the poor condition. A sarcophagus was found in the mid-north of the chamber.\n\nThe tomb had been robbed, from what remained, archaeologists identified a gold earring, a gold ring and a gold coin which is an imitation of Byzantine coins.\n\nThe sarcophagus measures 2.46 m in length, 1.55 m in width and 1.58 m in height, shaped like a timber-framed Chinese house or temple with a hip-and-gable roof, made of originally painted and gilded stone slabs, and is formed of a base, middle wall slabs and a top. It is densely decorated with bas-reliefs to convey blind architectural details and a complex figural programme. The four sides are carved with four-armed guardian deities, along with other Zoroastrian divinities and scenes of sacrifice, rising to heaven, banqueting, hunting and procession. Their subjects and style demonstrate features of the Western Regions (Central Asia). The French historian Étienne de la Vaissière argues that the iconography of these bas-reliefs representing a religious syncretism by blending Manichaean and Zoroastrian symbols in the funerary art. Despite the fact that the sarcophagus has adopted a unique style to create a miniature model of a traditional Chinese temple, the sinicisation of Wirkak's tomb is of the lowest degree among the other two Sogdian tombs: those of and .\n\nThe front (South) side of the sarcophagus is organised in strict formal symmetry around a large two-winged door. The Sogdian and Chinese inscriptions of the tomb occupants' career are manifested above the door. Flanking the door is a pair of inner panels with a guardian deity in each, and an additional pair of outer panels that feature three sections. From top to bottom, each outer panel contains a group of musicians, a stylised window ﬂanked by a pair of foreigners, and a half-human half-bird priest standing before the holy fire in a portable brazier. The six biographical panels (Panels \"a–f\", ) start on the middle panel of the left side and conclude on the last-but-one panel of the back. They are preceded and followed by two single religious panels (), which continue with three additional religious panels () on the right (East) side.

It is usually only undertaken by young males entering adulthood.\nIndividual Indigenous cultures have their own names for their rites of passage. \"Vision quest\" is an English umbrella term, and may not always be accurate or used by the cultures in question. \nAmong Native American cultures who have this type of rite, it usually consists of a series of ceremonies led by Elders and supported by the young man's community. The process includes a complete fast for four days and nights, alone at a sacred site in nature which is chosen by the Elders for this purpose. Some communities have used the same sites for many generations. During this time, the young person prays and cries out to the spirits that they may have a vision, one that will help them find their purpose in life, their role in a community, and how they may best serve the People. Dreams or visions may involve natural symbolism - such as animals or forces of nature - that require interpretation by Elders. After their passage into adulthood, and guided by this experience, the young person may then become an apprentice or student of an adult who has mastered this role.\nWhen talking to Yellow Wolf, Lucullus Virgil McWhorter came to believe that the person fasts, and stays awake and concentrates on their quest until their mind becomes \"comatose.\" It was then that their Weyekin (Nez Perce word) revealed itself.\n\nNon-Native, New Age and \"wilderness training\" schools offer what they call \"vision quests\" to the non-Native public. However, despite the name, these experiences may bear little resemblance to the traditional ceremonies beyond fasting and isolation. This cultural misappropriation sometimes includes New Age versions of a sweat lodge, which has at times led to untrained people causing harm and even death, such as in the James Arthur Ray manslaughter incident, which involved a 36-hour, non-Native idea of a vision quest, for which the participants paid almost $10,000.\n\nLike a number of other Indigenous ceremonies, the vision quest has been mentioned in statements by Indigenous leaders concerned about the protection of ceremonies and other Indigenous intellectual property rights; one of these documents is the 1993 Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality. In 2007 the United Nations adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), which has given further support to Indigenous people's rights to protect their cultures and ceremonies, and address restitution when intellectual, religious and spiritual property is taken without their free, prior and informed consent or in violation of their laws, traditions and customs.\n\n"}

{"id": "1879171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1879171", "title": "Womanist theology", "text": "Womanist theology\n\nWomanist theology is a religious conceptual framework which reconsiders and revises the traditions, practices, scriptures, and biblical interpretation with a special lens to empower and liberate African-American women in America. Womanist theology associates with and departs from Feminist theology and Black theology specifically because it integrates the perspectives and experiences of African American and other women of color. The former's lack of attention to the everyday realities of women of color and the latter's lack of understanding of the full dimension of liberation from the unique oppressions of black women require bringing them together in Womanist Theology. The goals of womanist theology include interrogating the social construction of black womanhood in relation to the black community and to assume a liberatory perspective so African American women can live emboldened lives within the African American community and within the larger society. Some of its tasks are excavating the life stories of poor women of African descent in the church and to understanding the \"languages\" of black women.\n\nThe term \"womanish\" was commonly used in Black daily language by mothers to describe adolescent daughters who act outrageous and grown-up, in contrast to \"girlish\". \"Womanist\" was then developed in 1983 by black writer and activist Alice Walker in her collection of essays, \"In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose\". In this text, she makes the point that \"A Womanist is to feminist as purple is to lavender.\" Hence, while \"womanist\" referred primarily to African American women, it was also for women in general. Walker's works would have significant impact on later womanist theologians.\n\nThe roots of modern womanist theology grew out of the theology of James Hal Cone, Katie G. Cannon, Jacquelyn Grant, and Delores Williams. Cone developed black theology which sought to make sense out of theology from black experience in America. In his book \"A Black Theology of Liberation,\" Cone argued that \"God is black\" in an effort to demonstrate that God identifies with oppressed black Americans. Then, Grant, a first-generation womanist theologian, argued that Cone did not attend to the fullness of black experience – specifically that of black women. She argued that the oppression of black women is different from that of black men. Grant pointed out that lower-class black women must navigate between the threefold oppression of racism, sexism, and classism in her books \"Womanist Theology\" and \"White Women's Christ and Black Women's Jesus: Feminist Christology and Womanist Response.\" For her, Jesus is a \"divine co-sufferer\" who suffered in his time like black women today. Grant concludes that black women are more oppressed and in need of further liberation than black men and especially white women. Delores Williams took the work of theologians such as Cone and Grant and expanded upon them. She suggested that womanist theologians need to \"search for the voices, actions, opinions, experience, and faith\" of black women in order to experience the God who \"makes a way out of no way.\" She defines womanist in the following way:\n\nWomanist theologians use a variety of methods to approach the scripture. Some attempt to find black women within the biblical narrative so as to reclaim the role and identity of black people in general, and black women specifically, within the Bible. Examples include the social ethicist Cheryl Sanders and the womanist theologian Karen Baker-Fletcher. Some approach the Bible \"objectively\" to critically evaluate text that degrades women and people of color and to offer an African-centered form, to resist male domination and bias, or what could be termed anti-women or androcentric attitudes and forms. Others draw on resources outside the Bible to enhance the plurality and cohesion of the texts along with our life experiences and reject scripture as a whole or part which is seen to serve male interest only. These methods are not separated and can be endorsed together.\n\nPatricia-Anne Johnson writes that \"Renita J. Weems, a womanist professor and scholar of the Hebrew Bible, examines scripture as a world filled with women of color. Through the use of womanist imagination, Weems helps students to understand female roles, personalities, and woman-to-woman relationships during the time when the biblical texts were written.\" Johnson, quoting further from Weems, also shows how Hagar and Esther can be seen as models of resistance for black women: \"Womanism may be envisioned as a post-colonial discourse that allows African-American women to embrace a Jesus and a God free of the imperialism of white supremacy.\"\n\n"}

These days, it remains popular in Cambodia, Thailand, and also in Laos and Myanmar (Burma). \"Sak\" means tattoo in Thai and Khmer, while \"yan\" and \"yoan\" are the Thai and Khmer pronunciation for the Sanskrit word yantra respectively, a type of mystical diagram used in Dharmic religions.\n\nSak yan designs are normally tattooed by \"ruesi\" (the Thai form of rishi), \"wicha\" (magic) practitioners, and Buddhist monks, traditionally with a metal rod sharpened to a point (called a \"khem sak\").\n\nTattoos believed to offer protection and other benefits have been recorded everywhere throughout both mainland Southeast Asia and as far south as Indonesia and the Philippines.. Over the centuries the tradition spread to what is now Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and parts of Myanmar. While the tradition itself originates with indigenous tribal animism, it became closely tied to the Hindu-Buddhist concept of yantra or mystical geometric patterns used during meditation. Tattoos of yantra designs were believed to hold magic power, and were used much like the kolam tattoos of India. For these people, religion is closely tied to the notion of magic, health, and good fortune.\n\nThe script used for yantra designs varies according to culture and geography. In Cambodia and central Thailand, Cambodian Khmer script is used, while in northern Thailand one sees yantra tattoos bearing Shan, northern Thai, or Tai Lu scripts, and in Laos the Lao Tham script is employed. The script spells out abbreviated syllables from Pali incantations. Different masters have added to these designs over the centuries through visions received in their meditations. Some yantra designs have been adapted from pre-Buddhist shamanism and the belief in animal spirits that was found in Southeast Asia and incorporated into Thai tradition and culture.\n\nYantra tattoos are believed to be magic and bestow mystical powers, protection, or good luck. There are three main effects of a yantra tattoo. One is that which benefits the wearer, such as making them more eloquent. Another is that of protection and to ward off evil and hardship. This is commonly used by military personnel, police, taxi drivers, gangsters and others in perceived dangerous professions. Another type is that which affects people around the wearer, such as invoking fear. The tattoo only confers its powers so long as the bearer observes certain rules and taboos, such as abstaining from a certain type of food.\n\nIt is believed that the power of sacred tattoos decreases with time. So to re-empower them each year, sak yan masters celebrate with their devotees the Wai Khru ritual. Wai khru means \"pay homage to one's guru\". In Thailand, the most impressive Wai Khru is held at the temple of Wat Bang Phra.\n\nSak yan designs are also applied to many other media, such as cloth or metal, and placed in one's house, place of worship, or vehicle as a means of protection from danger or illness, to increase wealth, and to attract lovers. In recent years Hollywood celebrities such as Angelina Jolie, whose tattoos were inked by Ajahn Noo Ganpai in Thailand, have made them popular among women.\n\nHowever a modern movement in Thailand seeks to progress away from their animistic past. As part of this movement, many modern-day Thais view yantra tattoos as nothing more than good-luck symbols that are stylish. \n\nThere are many traditional types and designs of yantra tattoos, but some of the most well-known and popular include:\n\n\nMany internet sites recommend Thailand as the place to attain the most refined ritual tattoos and consider the country as the most popular for learning this art. Every year, hundreds of foreigners in search of original and magical tattoos come to Thailand to have their tattoos done. In Southeast Asia, Thailand is by far the country with the highest number of devotees.\n\n\nWhile tattoos in the west are largely a matter of aesthetics, in Thailand they are imbued with both spirituality and superstition. The designs, lines of script, geometric patterns and animal shapes, are deeply interwoven with Buddhist and animist imagery that some Thais fear Westerners fail to appreciate. Tattoos of religious deities are problematic, especially if they are below the waist. In Southeast Asian culture, the head is the most sacred part of the body. The further down the body, the less sacred, and foreigners with religious figures inked on their legs have caused upset. On the main highway into Bangkok from Suvarnabhumi Airport, 15-metre-wide billboards declare \"It's wrong to use Buddha as a decoration or tattoo\". Some groups want a complete ban on any tattoos of religious figures.\n\n\n"}

(otherwise known simply as ADF) is a non-profit religious organization dedicated to the study and further development of modern Neodruidism.\n\nIn Modern Irish, Ár nDraíocht Féin () means \"our own magic (Druidism)\". \"ADF\" is also used to represent the phrase A Druid Fellowship. The organization was founded in 1983 and incorporated in 1990 as a U.S. 501(c)3 non-profit organization by Isaac Bonewits. The organization's first public announcement and membership sign-up took place at the first WinterStar Symposium in 1984 at Burr Oak State Park in Glouster, OH. ADF was originally organized as an Association, with Articles of Association signed by all Trustees on April 18, 1987.\n\nADF is a neodruidic organization practicing a unique tradition of Neopagan Druidry and is mostly U.S.-based, with members and groups in most states and in several other countries as well. During the years 2000 through 2010 to the present, ADF's membership has remained well over 1000 persons, making it the largest public form of definitively \"Neopagan\" Druidism in the USA.\n\nDespite the Gaelic name, ADF Druidry actually encompasses all Indo-European religions, which means that while most of the organization is focused on Celtic practices, there are also Germanic, Hellenic, Roman, Slavic and Vedic religious practices in ADF. In that sense, ADF uses the term Druid as \"a member of the Indo-European intelligentsia, especially of the clergy\" or even more broadly as \"a worshipper of Indo-European gods and goddesses\". Strictly speaking, members of ADF are not only \"druids\", but are also members of related Indo-European religions which may have other terms for people in such clergy roles (e.g., gothi for clergy of ancient Norse religions).\n\nIsaac Bonewits founded ADF with the goal of \"researching and expanding sound modern scholarship about the ancient Celts and other Indo-European peoples, in order to reconstruct what the Old Religions of Europe really were.\" Bonewits wanted to focus on scholarship as a reaction to more revisionist types of Neopaganism, such as those claiming direct descent from a \"Great Matriarchy\" of pre-historic times (see James Frazer's The Golden Bough). The works of Georges Dumézil on Indo-European social structures and mythologies were especially influential in Bonewits's thinking.\n\nRelated to the focus on scholarship, Isaac started the ADF Study Program with the goal of producing credible, knowledgeable Neopagan clergy; actual druid priests and priestesses, who would be able to fulfill all the roles of modern clergy for other Neopagans, such as birth, marriage, and funerary rites. Similarly, ADF's official motto of \"Why not excellence?\" is an expression of the desire to create a \"bona fide\" religious tradition, rather than a small group that few would take seriously and which would not be around in a few years. ADF's unofficial motto, \"As fast as a speeding oak,\" is meant to remind members that excellence takes time.\n\nADF was a reaction to many of the cultish pseudo-religions (Neopagan or not) with which Bonewits was familiar and (in a few cases) had experienced. Therefore, one of the first \"dogmas\" he promulgated was the \"Doctrine of Archdruidic Fallibility\", which states that everyone, even the Archdruid, can make mistakes. However, ADF was also a reaction to the Reformed Druids of North America, a freethinking religious group which Bonewits considered too loose and not Neopagan enough.\n\nADF promotes a neo-druidism in which worshipers perform rituals honoring three kinds of entities: gods and goddesses, ancestors (honored dead), and nature spirits. Examples of gods and goddesses worshipped include Lugh, Cernunnos, the Morrigan, Thor, Freya, Apollo, Athena, Vesta, Ceres, and many other ancient, pre-Christian, Indo-European deities. Although various pantheons or \"hearth cultures\" are allowed, \"mixing and matching\" unrelated deities within a single rite is discouraged. Ancestors usually refers to the direct blood ancestors of the worshiper, but can include other honored dead (friends, mythological heroes, etc.), too. Nature spirits includes general animal (totem) spirits as well as whatever spirits are present in the place of worship, such as a local river spirit. Most ADF rituals occur outdoors.\n\nIn ADF terms, the triad of deities, ancestors, and nature spirits is called the \"Three Kindreds\". There are other triads in ADF practice, such as the \"three realms\" of the Underworld (associated with the ancestors), the Heavens (associated with the gods), and this world (associated with the nature spirits); these are similar to the three worlds of the Celts, and to the Norse realms of Niflheim, Asgard, and Midgard. There are also three parts to this world; the Land, the Sea (including saltwater and freshwater bodies), and the Sky.\n\nAll of these triads are based on the common and pervasive theme of \"threes\" attributed to ancient Indo-European (and particularly Celtic) cultures. Similarly, ADF uses the common Indo-European themes of a sacred tree (e.g. the Norse Yggdrasil), a \"gatekeeper\" or opener of ways (e.g. the Norse god Heimdall, the Celtic god Manannan mac Lir, or the Hellenic god Hermes), and a treaty with hostile entities (e.g. the Norse Jotuns or the Celtic Fomorians). In these ways, ADF practice is an attempt to reconstruct earlier Indo-European beliefs and practices by using the records we have of ancient Indo-European cultures, and looking for commonalities among them which can then be applied to current spiritual practice.\n\nADF practice straddles the difficult middle ground between pure reconstructionism (attempting to recreate ancient practices as exactly as possible) and a less exclusive form of Neopaganism (an umbrella term for the loose agglomeration of pagan-based religions which arose in the early to middle 20th century, the most popular of which is Wicca). Thus, it attempts to be as authentic as possible given the realities of modern life. For example, ADF forbids any form of blood sacrifice in its official rituals, because even if it were appropriate in relation to one's ancestors (who may have lived in agrarian societies that regularly killed their own food), it is not considered appropriate in modern society.\n\nLocal ADF congregations are known as \"groves\" (like groves of trees), and while group rituals are often regarded as more powerful than rituals performed individually, ADF also has many solitary members; some by choice, and some because there are no groves within easy traveling distance. There are also ADF \"protogroves\", which are usually one or two people who would like to start a bigger grove. By forming a protogrove, they are able to appear on the list of ADF groves in the organization's online and printed literature, and so attract potential new members.\n\nOne of ADF's cornerstone principles is the notion that it is a \"public\" form of Neopaganism. Again, this was partly a reaction to the secretive religious groups Isaac was familiar with, such as closed covens which were limited in size to 13 members, or Masonic-style societies. In addition to promoting cult-ish behavior, such secretism in a larger sense was seen as unnecessarily promulgating the \"underground\" (occult, hidden) nature of Neopaganism. By making ADF a public tradition, its founder hoped to both prevent ADF from ever becoming a cult, and to further Neopaganism's acceptance in broader society as a credible and sane family of religions.\n\nAs a result of these principles and intents, ADF groves are required to have open-to-the-public rituals on or near the eight \"High Days\" of the common Neopagan calendar such as Bealtaine, Lughnasadh, and Samhain (the holidays of the Wheel of the Year). Such rituals follow an established \"core order of ritual\" and are expected to focus on one particular pantheon or \"hearth culture\" for that high day. ADF groves are also required to perform some kind of public service on a quarterly basis (cleaning up parks and other ecological activities are popular).\n\nAn annual meeting of ADF is held at an event selected by the membership. Thus far it has been at either the Starwood Festival or the Wellspring Gathering, presently held at Tredara in Madison, OH on Memorial Day Weekend and at Brushwood Folklore Center in the past. This meeting originated as part of the Starwood Festival in 1987 at Bear Creek KOA in East Sparta, OH, and was held at Starwood through 1992. Wellspring, run by Stone Creed Grove, became a separate event in 1991, and the National Members Meeting was moved to Wellspring in 1993. ADF still maintains a presence at the Starwood Festival, holding meetings and offering classes and rituals, and sometimes has more members attending there than at the Wellspring Gathering.\n\nAnyone may join ADF, as membership is open to the public.\n\n\n\n"}
