{"id": "1793325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1793325", "title": "Alfredo Ottaviani", "text": "Alfredo Ottaviani\n\nAlfredo Ottaviani (29 October 1890 – 3 August 1979) was an Italian cardinal of the Catholic Church. Pope Pius XII named him cardinal in 1953. He served as Secretary of the Holy Office in the Roman Curia from 1959 to 1966 when that dicastery was reorganised as the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, of which he was Pro-Prefect until 1968.\n\nOttaviani was a prominent figure in the Church during his time and was the leading conservative voice at the Second Vatican Council.\n\nOttaviani was born in Rome; his father was a baker. He studied with the Brothers of the Christian Schools in Trastevere, at the Pontifical Roman Seminary and the Pontifical Roman Athenaeum \"S. Apollinare\", from where he received his doctorates in philosophy, theology, and canon law. He was ordained to the priesthood on 18 March 1916.\n\nOn 12 January 1953, he was both appointed Pro-Secretary of the Holy Office and created Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria in Domnica by Pope Pius XII. He participated as a cardinal-elector in the 1958 conclave which elected Pope John XXIII.\n\nOn 7 November 1959, he was named the Vatican's chief doctrinal guardian as Secretary of the Holy Office. Ottaviani was appointed Titular Archbishop of Berrhoea on 5 April 1962, receiving his episcopal consecration on the following 19 April from Pope John XXIII himself, with Cardinals Giuseppe Pizzardo and Benedetto Aloisi Masella serving as co-consecrators. His episcopal motto \"Semper idem\" (\"Always the same\") reflected his conservative theology. He resigned his titular see in 1963.\n\nOttaviani was the leader of the curial conservatives during the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965), despite being nearly blind throughout the entire course of the council and afterwards. At the council Ottaviani worked with, amongst others, Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre. During the last of the council's preparatory sessions, Ottaviani engaged in a heated debate with Cardinal Augustin Bea over the subject of religious liberty. Ottaviani, while opposed to the separation of Church and State and granting equal rights to all religions, supported religious tolerance—suppressing public manifestations of non-Catholic religions when possible. Their confrontation became so intense that Cardinal Ernesto Ruffini had to intervene, noting his disappointment at such a \"serious discussion\". Ottaviani also argued during the debates on the liturgy and on the sources of Divine Revelation, which are understood as Scripture and Tradition in Catholic theology.\n\nDuring the council the news media often went to Ottaviani for colorful reactions to stormy working sessions. In one speech at the council, reacting to repeated mentions of \"collegiality\" of bishops, Ottaviani pointed out that the Bible only records one example of the apostles acting collegially – at the Garden of Gethsemane when \"They all fled.\"\n\nOttaviani was opposed in his movements for a rapid council by German Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne. Frings often clashed with Ottaviani on which direction the council should take. In this, he was assisted by \"a [then] progressive firebrand\" who was \"dissatisfied with many of the answers offered by the Church's official authorities\", a young theological advisor named Joseph Ratzinger, who would later become prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and then Pope Benedict XVI. Frings had heard a lecture of the young Ratzinger on issues the upcoming council could address. It seemed to Frings that Ratzinger had set forth a complete agenda for the council that was exactly what Frings himself had in mind. Frings had Ratzinger prepare the text of a lecture that Frings was to give in Rome. After the lecture, which Pope John XXIII complimented warmly, Frings told the Pope that he did not deserve credit for the speech, as it was written by one of his priests. Pope John admitted that he too delegated much of his work. The key thing was to select the right person for the job. After this conversation, Ratzinger became Frings's lead assistant during the entire council and thereafter never left Frings's service.\n\nThe acrimony felt by such liberal members of the council against Ottaviani spilled out into international news in a dramatic incident on November 8, 1963, which Protestant observer Robert MacAfee Brown described as having \"blown the dome off St. Peter's\": in a working session of the council, Frings declared Ottaviani's dicastery a \"source of scandal\" to the whole world.\n\nWith continued worldwide interest in Vatican II, another internal matter concerning the proceedings of the council concerning Ottaviani found its way into international news. During the October 30, 1962 session concerning changes to the Mass, he went beyond the 10-minute limit imposed on all speakers. Upon Ottaviani passing this mark Cardinal Eugène Tisserant, Dean of the Council Presidents showed his watch to the council president for the day Cardinal Bernard Alfrink of Utrecht (whom the Associated Press described as \"one of the most outspoken members...who want to see far-reaching changes inside the church.\"). Ottaviani engrossed in his topic went on condemning the proposed changes, saying \"Are we seeking to stir up wonder, or perhaps scandal, among the Christian people, by introducing changes in so venerable a rite, that has been approved for so many centuries and is now so familiar? The rite of Holy Mass should not be treated as if it were a piece of cloth to be refashioned according to the whim of each generation.\" When he had reached fifteen minutes Alfrink rang a warning bell. When Ottaviani kept speaking, Alfrink signalled to a technician who switched off the microphone. After tapping the microphone to determine it was off, the half-blind Ottaviani stumbled back to his seat in humiliation while \"there was scattered applause in the council hall\" by members of the council fathers who held that he had gone on too long.\n\nScandalized by the reaction of his fellow council fathers, Ottaviani boycotted the next six council working sessions. When Cardinal Ernesto Ruffini of Palermo presided over the 11 November session he announced that \"Ottaviani had been grieved by the 30 October incident\" and asked council fathers to refrain from voicing approval or disapproval with applause. The Associated Press noted that \"Ironically, the incident...[was] favorably commented on by the non-Catholic observers attending the council, who were struck by the process and freedom of expression at the council\". As he was president of the Theological Commission responsible for amending the schema on sources of religion, Ottaviani returned to the working session to champion the position of those the Associated Press called \"the static traditionalists\".\n\nOttaviani was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1963 papal conclave, which selected Giovanni Battista Montini as Pope Paul VI. He was also the \"Protodeacon\" (senior Cardinal-Deacon) during the conclave, and as such, he announced Montini's election and crowning him on 30 June with the triregnum.\n\nUpon the changing of the name of the Holy Office to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 1965, Ottaviani was named Pro-Prefect of the congregation; the pope held the title of \"Prefect\" until 1968. He was raised to the rank of Cardinal-Priest (with the same title) on 26 June 1967. As Pro-Prefect Ottaviani had described himself as a \"policeman\" who protected traditional doctrine.\n\nOn 8 January 1968 Ottaviani resigned from the church's central administration. Pope Paul VI accepted the resignation and appointed Cardinal Franjo Seper of Yugoslavia to take his place as Pro-Prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. The event was seen as \"a major turning point\" by the Associated Press, noting he was being replaced \"by a prelate from a Communist country that once imprisoned a Catholic cardinal...In dramatic fashion it signified the move of the half-billion-member church away from rigid conservatism toward new experiments in modernism and changing relations with Communist countries.\"\n\nIn 1970, when Paul VI restricted voting in papal conclaves to cardinals under the age of 80, Ottaviani, already 80, said the Pope's action was \"an act committed in contempt of tradition that is centuries old\" and that he was \"throwing overboard the bulk of his expert and gifted counselors\".\n\nOttaviani died on 3 August 1979.\n\nAt the beginning of 1962, Ottaviani notified the Jesuit superiors of theologian Karl Rahner that Rahner had been placed under Roman pre-censorship. That meant that the prolific theology professor could no longer publish or lecture without permission. A few months later, in November 1962, Pope John XXIII appointed Rahner to be \"peritus\" (an expert advisor) to and at the Second Vatican Council. Since Rahner accompanied the Cardinal Archbishop of Vienna, Franz König, as a theological consultant, Ottaviani did not throw Rahner out of the council in spite of the earlier silencing.\n\nOn 25 September 1969, Ottaviani and Cardinal Antonio Bacci wrote a letter to Paul VI in support of a study by a group of theologians who under the direction of Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre criticized the new Order of Mass (in Latin, \"novus Ordo Missae\"), and the new General Instruction (in Latin, \"Institutio Generalis\"), two sections (in not quite definitive form) of the revision of the Roman Missal that was promulgated on 3 April of that year but that actually appeared in full only in 1970. This letter became widely known as the \"Ottaviani Intervention\" and is often appealed to by Traditionalist Catholics as support for their opposition to the revision of the Roman Rite Mass.\n\nIn 1962, as head, under the Pope, of the Holy Office, Ottaviani signed its document known by its incipit \"Crimen sollicitationis\", which had as subtitle \"On the Manner of Proceeding in Cases of the Crime of Solicitation\". It laid down detailed rules about the procedure for ecclesiastical tribunals to follow if a priest was accused of making sexual advances connected in any way with the sacrament of Confession. Judges and other officials of the tribunal (\"each and everyone pertaining to the tribunal in any way\") would be subject to automatic excommunication if they revealed anything about the conduct of the trial, even after the verdict had been declared and put into effect. This penalty did not apply to accusers and other witnesses; on the contrary, anyone with knowledge of the crime who failed to denounce it within one month was subject to automatic excommunication and could be absolved only after actually denouncing the priest or at least promising seriously to do so. Violation of secrecy by the accused was also punished not by excommunication but by suspension.\n\nIn 2003, 24 years after Ottaviani's death, media reports presented this document as an attempt to \"hide sexual abuse\". Some reported that even accusers were subjected to excommunication if they made their accusations known, and that the document was stored in the \"Vatican Secret Archives\", where it was discovered by a lawyer pursuing cases on behalf of victims of abuse by Catholic priests. In fact, the 69-page document was sent to \"all Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops and other Local Ordinaries, including those of Eastern Rite\" and was to be found, even if after forty years it was generally forgotten, among the papers in their successors' offices. While media reports also suggested that the ecclesiastical verdict was never to be made known, the document itself spoke of the verdict being \"declared\" and \"put into effect\", and the punishments laid down in canon law were: \"He is to be suspended from celebrating Mass and hearing sacramental confessions and, if the gravity of the crime calls for it, he is to be declared unfit for hearing them; he is to be deprived of all benefices and ranks, of the right to vote or be voted for, and is to be declared unfit for all of them, and in more serious cases he is to be reduced to the lay state.\" These punishments were of public character and not subject to secrecy.\n\nAs Secretary of the Holy Office, Ottaviani was responsible for the banning of a number of books, which would accordingly have been included in any new edition of the \"Index Librorum Prohibitorum\" (Index of Prohibited Books). The \"Index\", the last edition of which had been published in 1948, was abolished by Pope Paul VI in 1966.\n\nOn 6 March 1959, the Holy Office issued a notification that forbade circulation of \"images and writings that promote devotion to Divine Mercy \"in the forms proposed by Sister Faustina\"\" (emphasis in the original). Faustina Kowalska was a Polish nun who in her diary recounted conversations with Jesus Christ. The negative judgement of the Holy Office was based on reasons that included its use of a faulty French or Italian translation of the diary. However, it was with Ottaviani's approval that Archbishop Karol Wojtyła of Kraków began in 1965 the informative process on Faustina's life and virtues, and the ban on her work was reversed by Pope Paul VI in 1978.\n\nOttaviani was critical of the writings of the bed-ridden Italian mystic Maria Valtorta, who reported visions of Jesus and Mary.\n\nWhen the typed version of the 15,000 handwritten pages of Valtorta's notebooks was prepared by Romualdo Migliorini and Corrado Berti (both Servite priests), they sought Vatican guidance for procedural advice on presenting the reputed revelations to the proper ecclesiastical hierarchy, as the local bishop's (Fontevecchia) vision was fading. At the Vatican they encountered Monsignor Alphonso Carinci and Cardinal Augustin Bea, Pope Pius XII's confessor, who advised presenting the typed manuscript directly to Pope Pius XII, through a recommended intermediary, which was accomplished in 1947. Ten months later, Carinci and Bea facilitated a meeting between the Servite priests and Pope Pius XII and it was recorded in \"L'Osservatore Romano\".\n\nDuring the papal audience, Pope Pius XII reportedly said: \"Publish this work as it is. There is no need to give an opinion about its origin, whether it be extraordinary or not. Who reads it, will understand.\" Berti signed an affidavit to this effect, stating that he had a verbal papal approval. However, once he approached the Vatican Press, he was summoned to the Holy Office, was seriously rebuked, and the Holy Office attempted to confiscate the original copies of Valtorta's writings. Valtorta's notebooks were published in 1950 by Michele Pisani as \"Poem of the Man God\".\n\nOttaviani ordered Berti to silence. Augustin Bea, was a consultor of the Holy Office at the time it condemned the book, as was Dominican theologian Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange. A year after the death of Pius XII, Ottaviani placed the work among the list of books he presented to the newly appointed Pope John XXIII, who signed the decree banning all the books on the list.\n\n"}
{"id": "85025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=85025", "title": "Amulius", "text": "Amulius\n\nIn Roman mythology, Amulius was king of Alba Longa who ordered the death of his infant, twin grandnephews Romulus, the eventual founder and king of Rome, and Remus. He was deposed and killed by them after they survived and grew to adulthood.\n\nHe is the brother and usurper of Numitor and son of Procas. He was said to have reigned 42 years before his death (794-752 BC). His brother, had been king, but Amulius overthrew him, killed his son, and took the throne. He forced Rhea Silvia, Numitor's daughter, to become a Vestal Virgin, a priestess of Vesta, so that she would never bear any sons that might overthrow him. However, she was raped or seduced by the god Mars, resulting in the birth of the twins. Rhea was thrown into prison and her sons ordered to be thrown into the river Tiber. The twins washed up onto dry land and were found by a she-wolf who suckled them. Later their mother was saved by the river god Tiberinus who ended up marrying her. Romulus and Remus went on to found Rome and overthrow Amulius, reinstating their grandfather Numitor as king of Alba Longa.\n\nDionysius was a Greek historian and librarian who wrote in the first century BC. He writes that Amulius' father, King Proca, willed the throne to Numitor but Amulius deposed him. For fear of a threat to his rule, the king had Numitor's son, Aegestus killed, blaming thieves. The truth about the crime was known by some, including Numitor, who feigned ignorance. Amulius then appointed Numitor's daughter to the Vestal priestesshood, where her vow of chastity would prevent her from producing any further children. Despite this, she became pregnant a few years later, claiming to have been raped.\n\nIn one of the sources, Amulius himself (in full armor to conceal his identity) commits the rape. Ilia hid her pregnancy with claims of illness so as to avoid her vestal duties. But Amulius was suspicious and employed physicians and his own wife to monitor her for signs of being with child. When he discovered the truth, he placed her under armed guard. After being informed of the delivery of Romulus and Remus, Amulius suspected that she had in fact given birth to triplets. The third child having been concealed from the guards present. Ilia was either put to death, or kept secretly in a hidden dungeon for the rest of her life.\n\nCiting Fabius Pictor, Cincius, Cato, and Piso, Dionysius writes that the king ordered the twins to be tossed into the Tiber. When his servants arrived at the riverbank, high waters had made it impossible to reach the stream. So they left the twin's basket in a pool of standing water on the site of the ficus Ruminalis. After the waters of the Tiber had carried the twins away, their basket was overturned by a rock and they were dumped into the mud. It was there, that a she-wolf famously found them and nursed them in front of her lair (the \"Lupercal\"). Amulius' servant Faustulus, happened upon the scene. He took the boys home, and brought them up with his wife. Later, quoting Fabius' account of the overthrow of Amulius, Plutarch claims that Faustulus had saved the basket in which the boys had been abandoned.\n\nAccording to Fabius, when the twins were 18, they became embroiled in a violent dispute with some of Numitor's herdsmen. In retaliation, Remus was lured into an ambush and captured while Romulus was elsewhere. In Aelius Tubero's version, the twins were taking part in the festivities of the Lupercalia, requiring them to run naked through the village when Remus, defenseless as he was, was taken prisoner by Numitor's armed men.\n\nAfter rounding up the toughest herdsmen to help him free Remus, Romulus rashly set out for Alba Longa. To avoid tragedy, Faustulus intercepted him and revealed the truth about the twins' parentage. With the discovery that Numitor was family, Romulus sets his sights on Amulius instead. He and the rest of his village set out in small groups toward the city so that their arrival would go unnoticed by the guards. Meanwhile, after Amulius turned Remus over to Numitor to determine his punishment, Remus was told of his origins by the former king and eagerly joined with him in their own effort to topple Amulius. When Romulus joined them, they began to plan their next move.\n\nFaustulus is caught by the Alban guards trying to sneak the infant twins' basket into the city and is brought before Amulius by none-other-than the servant who had taken the boys to the river those many years before. Amulius questions his man and insincerely claims he means the twins no harm. Faustulus, trying to protect Romulus and Remus, and escape the king's clutches, claimed he had been bringing the basket to the imprisoned Ilia at the twins request and that they were at the moment tending their flocks in the mountains.\n\nAmulius sent Faustulus and some of his men to find the boys. He then tried to trick Numitor into coming to the palace so that the former king could be kept under guard until the situation had been dealt with. Unfortunately for the king, when the man he sent to lure Numitor into his clutches arrived at the deposed king's house, he betrayed Amulius and revealed everything that had happened at the palace.\n\nThe twins and their grandfather led their joint supporters to the palace, killed Amulius, and took control of the city.\n"}

A small number of native Bulgarians are converts to Theravada and Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nThere is an officially recognised Bulgarian Buddhist Karma Kagyu organization, which is a part of Diamond Way Buddhism led by Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje. They have several centers spread over the country.\n\nShechen has a mountain retreat center not far away from Sofia; access is granted to members, and it is not generally open to the public.\n\n"}

It referred to the \"Debi Chal\" or \"Durga chala\", the background of the Durga Pratima or idol. Originally, these were used to give a proper proportion to the structure. This tradition is very ancient and is still maintained.\n\n\"Chalchitra\" is a Bengali word where \"Chal\" means covering. It is drawn in Pratima Chala. So, it is called Chalchitra. Patua, the artists of Chalchitra called it as Pata Lekha, means the writing of Patachitra. It is also called \"Durga Chala\", \"Debi Chala\".\n\nAccording to the shape of the Chali, the structure of Durga Pratima it has some varieties like Bangla chali, Mothchouri Chali, Tanachauri Chali, Sorbosundori chali, Khep chali, Markini Chali etc. Among them, the commonly seen Chali is the Markini Chali. The Bangla chali follows the tradition of temple architecture. It stretches on both sides of the idol in a suspended pattern and is long enough to fit all the idols present there.\n\nThe main content of the chalchitra is Shib-Parboti, Kail, Shib attending Nandi-Vringi, Mahish-mardini, Dashabatar etc. Such a special Patachitra is seen in Durga Pot in the \"Hatsarandi Sutradhar society\" of Birbhum district, which is called Durga Pot. However, instead of Durga idol, it was worshiped in Durga Pot. Durga Pot has a semi-circular Patachitra where Patachitra of Durga is in the middle position. Ram, Sita, Shib, Nandi-Vringi, Brahma, Vishnu, Shumbha-Nishumbha are painted on this kind of Chalchitra. Krishnanager Rajrajeshwari Durga is seen to be uniquely noticed. In the middle of the Chalchitra, there is Panchanan Shib and Parvati is beside him, on one side there is Dasha-mahabidya and the other side, there is Dashabatar.\n\nTwo of the most famous forms of idol making in Bengal are Bishnupur style and Kansanarayan style. Among them, Kangshonarayan style is most popular. At the time of Kangshonarayan, the Chalchitra is true ingridin of Durga Pratima.\n\n300–400 years old idols of Nabadwip Shakta Rash used Chalchitra as a part of Pratima. At a time, the use of Chalchitra became fade, but now it has a great popularity. Chalchitra artist of Nabadwip, Tapan Bhattacharya said-\nRajrajeshwari Durga Pratima of Krishnanager Rajbari uses a unique Chalchitra. Baishnavadas Mallik of Kolkata's Darpanarayan Tagore Street and the tradition of writing pot in the Bose family of Ramkrishnapur is still fine. Bimanbihari Sheel of Ramchan family in Chorabagan, north Kolkata said-\nKrishnanagar's Chalchitra artist Biswanath Pal wrote pot in various Banedi families of Kolkata. He said-\nOn the upper surface of the idol, a half-domed bamboo structure was strapped on it, and the width of the cloth was wrapped in a width of thick cloth and the back part of the cloth was folded behind the bamboo structure. When the clayed cloth dried up, it was given a few layers of Chalk Dust. After that, the planned storyline is drawn on it.\n\nNatural color is used in color, which is one of the characteristics of the Bengal Patachitra. In general, blue, yellow, green, red, brown, black and white are used in the Chalchitra. Indeed, the painting illustration has been imitated by the Patachitra of Bengal. Chalk dust is used for white color, pauri for yellow color, cultivated indigo for blue,bhushakali for black and mete sindur for red color in chalchitra.\n\n"}
{"id": "11542431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11542431", "title": "Charles Debrille Poston", "text": "Charles Debrille Poston\n\nCharles Debrille Poston (April 20, 1825 – June 24, 1902) was an American explorer, prospector, author, politician, and civil servant. He is referred to as the \"Father of Arizona\" due to his efforts lobbying for creation of the territory. Poston was also Arizona Territory's first Delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nPoston was born near Elizabethtown, Kentucky to Temple and Judith Debrille Poston. His father was a printer and he served as a printer's devil. Poston was orphaned at the age of twelve, and was apprenticed to the local county clerk, Samuel Haycraft. Following his apprenticeship, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee where he clerked for the Tennessee Supreme Court while reading law. Poston married Haycraft's daughter, Margaret, in September 1848 and the couple had a daughter, Sarah Lee Poston, who reached adulthood. Margaret Poston became paralyzed on February 12, 1851, possibly from a stroke while giving birth to a second child, and was cared for by relatives until her death from cancer on February 26, 1884. On July 27, 1885, Poston married former newspaper typesetter Martha \"Mattie\" Tucker. The couple separated shortly afterwards, but there is no evidence they ever divorced.\n\nPoston traveled to California as part of the Gold Rush and took a clerk position at the San Francisco Customs House in February 1851. Poston was demoted in 1853 and complained that his replacement was a professional gambler and political appointee. While at this \njob, he became involved with a group of French bankers interested in the lands of the recently negotiated Gadsden Purchase. In late 1853, with the bankers' backing, Poston joined with mining engineer Herman Ehrenberg to organize an expedition into the territory Mexico was expected to sell to the United States. Taking a ship from San Francisco, the two became shipwrecked near the Mexican port of Guaymas. They were then detained temporarily by Mexican authorities as suspected filibusters before heading north to the Gadsden territory. The expedition visited San Xavier del Bac and Ajo, collecting mineral samples along the way, before traveling down the Gila River. At Fort Yuma, a U.S. Army post near the confluence of the Gila and Colorado River, Poston first met the fort's commander Major Samuel P. Heintzelman. While at Fort Yuma Poston surveyed a townsite on the south side of the river a mile below the fort, at Jaeger's Ferry. Poston sold the townsite called Colorado City for $20,000 when he returned to San Francisco.\nAfter returning to San Francisco, Poston left for the East Coast in search of capital to fund a mining operation in the newly acquired territory. After several unsuccessful attempts, he was introduced to several Cincinnati, Ohio investors by Heintzelman. On March 24, 1856, US$2 million was secured to found the Sonora Exploring and Mining Company with Heintzelman as company president and Poston as managing supervisor. The company set up headquarters in Tubac, Arizona and began mining operations in the nearby Santa Rita Mountains and elsewhere. Poston served as alcalde of the settlement and became known as \"Colonel\" Poston in the town of roughly 800 people. Using the authority granted to him by the government of New Mexico Territory, he printed his own money and officiated over marriages, divorces, and the baptisms of children. This continued until Father Macheboeuf, the vicar of Bishop Jean-Baptiste Lamy, was sent from Santa Fe to investigate the goings-on in Tubac. The validity of the marriages Poston had performed was questioned by the vicar, and a US$700 donation made before Father Macheboeuf sanctified the unions. Charles Poston's brother, John, was murdered by Mexican outlaws at Cerro Colorado in southern Arizona, the town was established by Charles Poston.\n\nMining operations produced US $3000 per day in silver until 1861. With the withdrawal of Union troops due to the American Civil War, Tubac saw an increase in hostilities from local Apaches and the settlement had to be abandoned.\n\nAfter being forced to leave Tubac due to the Apache siege, Poston went to Washington D.C. and worked for General Heintzelman as a civilian aide. During this time Heintzelman introduced him to President Abraham Lincoln. Poston in turn used this time to lobby both Lincoln and Congress for creation of an Arizona Territory, advertising the benefits of the area's mineral wealth to the Union cause. Toward the end of the process Poston attended an oyster dinner where the slate of territorial positions was divided among lame duck congressmen and Poston was selected as an Indian Agent for the new territory.\n\nPoston commissioned Tiffany & Co. to create a US$1500 inkwell from Arizona silver \nand presented the inkwell to Lincoln upon signing of the Arizona Organic Act. On 12 March 1863 Poston was appointed superintendent of Indian affairs. This appointment was followed by his election as Delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives on 18 July 1864. During his term of service, Poston submitted bills aimed at settling private land claims and to establish Indian reservations along the Colorado river. In 1865, Poston chose not to return to Arizona during his run for reelection, and was defeated by John Noble Goodwin. A final run for election to the territorial delegate position failed in 1866.\n\nAfter losing his position in Congress, Poston opened a law office in Washington D.C.\nIn 1867 he traveled to Europe, spending time in both London and Paris. He then returned to Washington and in 1868 published a travel book, \"Europe in the Summer-Time\". This was followed by U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward commissioning Poston to deliver the Burlingame Treaty to the Emperor of China and to study irrigation and immigration in Asia. After China, Poston continued to India where he developed a fascination with the Parsi people and Zoroastrianism. He reached Egypt by early 1869 and was in Paris by April of that year. After living a year in Paris he moved to London where he spent the next six years. During this time he worked as an editor of a London newspaper, foreign correspondent to the \"New York Tribune\", and as a \"counselor-at-law\". Poston also wrote several books during this time, publishing \"The Parsees\" in 1872, \"The Sun Worshippers of Asia\" in 1877, and his poem \"Apache Land\" in 1878.\nHis work, \"Building a State in Apache Land\" was published in installments by \"Overland Monthly\" between July and October 1894.\n\nPoston returned to the United States in time for the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. Through his acquaintance with John Bigelow, he then became a campaign worker for Samuel J. Tilden during the U.S. presidential election of 1876. Poston expected a consul position in London if Tilden had won the election, but instead was made register of the United States land office at Florence, Arizona from July 1877 till June 1879. During his time in Florence he became interested in building a Parsi fire temple on a nearby hill, paying for construction of a road to the summit. The temple itself was decorated with a blue and white flag depicting a red sun and built upon the ruins of an older Indian structure. Construction ended when Poston ran out of funds. He attempted to raise additional money, even writing to the Shah of Iran, but his efforts failed and the temple's eternal flame failed shortly thereafter. This unusual interest led to Poston being criticized as a crank and eccentric.\n\nFollowing his time in Florence he moved to Tucson and supported himself with a variety of positions including lecturer, mining and railroad promoter, and writer. In 1884 he became a consular agent in Nogales followed by an assignment as a civilian military agent in El Paso, Texas in 1887 and as employee of U.S. Geological Survey in 1889.\nPoston declined into obscurity until 1897 when Whitelaw Reid published an account detailing Poston's situation. As a result, the Arizona Territorial legislature awarded Poston a pension of US$25/month in 1899 and increased this to US$35/month in 1901. Poston died from apparent heart failure on June 24, 1902 in Phoenix, Arizona Territory.\n\nDespite his previously stated wish to be buried at the summit of Primrose Hill, Poston was initially buried in a pauper's grave in Phoenix. His remains were removed from Phoenix and moved to Florence, Arizona, on the 100th anniversary of his birth, and buried on Primrose Hill, renamed, Poston Butte where he had never completed his \"Temple to the Sun\". He was entombed in an official ceremony led by Governor George W. P. Hunt.\n\nPoston was portrayed in the 1965 episode \"A City Is Born\" by later Governor and U.S. President Ronald W. Reagan on the syndicated television series \"Death Valley Days\". In the story line, Poston is a mining developer and surveyor engaged in a race against time to reach San Diego, California, for an important meeting with bankers.\n\nIn another \"Death Valley Days\" segment in 1966, Robert Taylor, Reagan's successor as the series host, played Poston in the episode \"The Day All Marriages Were Cancelled\". The story stemmed from a dispute between Poston and the Roman Catholic bishop, who questioned how Poston through his role as alcalde could perform secular marriages at no costs to the couples involved in the absence of available priests. During a civil trial, the church relents, and the marriages were declared legal once again. Willard Sage played the role of Father McCabe in this episode.\n\n\n"}

They can be classified as:\n\n\"Gōng\" (宫), meaning \"palace\" is a term used for a templar complex of multiple buildings, while \"yuàn\" (院) is a generic term meaning \"sanctuary\" or \"shrine\".\n\nShen temples are distinct from Taoist temples in that they are established and administered by local managers, village communities, lineage congregations and worship associations, and don't have professional priests, although Taoist priests, \"fashi\", Confucian \"lisheng\", and also \"wu\" and \"tongji\" shamans, may perform services within these temples. Shenist temples are usually small and decorated with traditional figures on their roofs (dragons and deities), although some evolve into significant structures.\n\nChinese temples can be found throughout Mainland China, Taiwan and also where Chinese expatriate communities settled over centuries. An old name in English for Chinese traditional temples is \"joss house\". \"Joss\" is an Anglicized spelling of the Portuguese word for \"god\", \"deus\". \"Joss house\" was in common use in English in western North America during frontier times, when joss houses were a common feature of Chinatowns. The name \"joss house\" describes the environment of worship. Joss sticks, a kind of incense, are burned inside and outside of the house.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "158849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=158849", "title": "Criticism of Jehovah's Witnesses", "text": "Criticism of Jehovah's Witnesses\n\nJehovah's Witnesses have received criticism from mainstream Christianity, members of the medical community, former members, and commentators regarding their beliefs and practices. The movement has been accused of doctrinal inconsistency and reversals, failed predictions, mistranslation of the Bible, harsh treatment of former members and autocratic and coercive leadership. Criticism has also focused on their rejection of blood transfusions, particularly in life-threatening medical situations, and claims that they have failed to report cases of sexual abuse to the authorities. Many of the claims are denied by Jehovah's Witnesses and some have also been disputed by courts and religious scholars.\n\nThe beliefs unique to Jehovah's Witnesses involve their interpretations of the second coming of Christ, the millennium and the kingdom of God. Watch Tower Society publications have made, and continue to make, predictions about world events they believe were prophesied in the Bible. Some of those early predictions were described as \"established truth\", and 'beyond a doubt'.\nWitnesses are told to 'be complete in accepting the visible organization's direction in every aspect' and that there is no need to question what God tells them through his Word and organization since love \"believes all things.\" If a member advocates views different to what appears in print, they face expulsion.\n\nFailed predictions that were either explicitly stated or strongly implied, particularly linked to dates in 1914, 1915, 1918, 1925 and 1975, have led to the alteration or abandonment of some teachings. The Society's publications have at times suggested that members had previously \"read into the \"Watch Tower\" statements that were never intended\" or that the beliefs of members were \"based on wrong premises.\" According to Professor Edmond Gruss, other failed predictions were ignored, and replaced with new predictions; for example, in the book, \"The Finished Mystery\" (1917), events were applied to the years 1918 to 1925 that earlier had been held to occur prior to 1914. When the new interpretations also did not transpire, the 1926 edition of the book changed the statements and removed the dates.\n\nRaymond Franz, a former member of the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses, has cited publications that claimed God has used Jehovah's Witnesses as a collective prophet. Professor James A. Beverley, along with others, has accused the movement of false prophecy for making those predictions, particularly because of assertions in some cases that the predictions were beyond doubt or had been approved by God, but describes its record of telling the future as \"pathetic\". Beverley says the Watch Tower Society has passed judgment on others who have falsely predicted the end of the world (he cites a 1968 \"Awake!\" article that says other groups were \"guilty of false prophesying\" after having \"predicted an 'end to the world', even announcing a specific date\").\n\nThe Watch Tower Society rejects accusations that it is a false prophet. It admits its explanations of Bible prophecy are not infallible and that its predictions are not claimed explicitly as \"the words of Jehovah.\" It states that some of its expectations have needed adjustment because of eagerness for God's kingdom, but that those adjustments are no reason to \"call into question the whole body of truth.\" Raymond Franz claims that the Watch Tower Society tries to evade its responsibility when citing human fallibility as a defense, adding that the Society represents itself as God's appointed spokesman, and that throughout its history has made many emphatic predictions. Franz adds that the organization's eagerness for the Millennium does not give it license to impugn the motives of those who fail to accept its predictions.\n\nGeorge D. Chryssides has suggested widespread claims that Witnesses \"keep changing the dates\" are a distortion and misunderstanding of Watch Tower Society chronology. He argues that, although there have been failures in prophetic speculation, the changing views and dates of the Jehovah's Witnesses are more largely attributable to changed understandings of biblical chronology than to failed predictions. Chryssides states, \"For the Jehovah’s Witnesses prophecy serves more as a way of discerning a divine plan in human history than a means to predicting the future.\"\n\nPredictions (by date of publication) include:\n\nAlthough Watch Tower Society literature claims the Society's founder, Charles Taze Russell, was directed by God's Holy Spirit, through which he received \"flashes of light\", it has substantially altered doctrines since its inception and abandoned many of Russell's teachings. Many of the changes have involved biblical chronology that had earlier been claimed as beyond question. Watch Tower Society publications state that doctrinal changes result from a process of \"progressive revelation\", in which God gradually reveals his will.\n\n\nJehovah's Witnesses believe that the United Nations is one of the 'superior authorities' that exist by God's permission, and that it serves a purpose in maintaining order, but do not support it politically and do not consider it to be the means to achieve peace and security. Jehovah's Witnesses also believe that the United Nations is the \"image of the wild beast\" of Revelation 13:1-18, and the second fulfilment of the \"abominable thing that causes desolation\" from Matthew 24:15; that it will be the means for the devastation of organized false religion worldwide; and that, like all other political powers, it will be destroyed and replaced by God's heavenly kingdom. Jehovah's Witnesses have denounced other religious organizations for having offered political support to the UN.\n\nOn October 8, 2001, an article was published in the British \"Guardian\" newspaper questioning the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society's registration as a non-governmental organization (NGO) with the United Nations Department of Public Information and accusing the Watch Tower Society of hypocrisy. Within days of the article's publication, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society submitted a formal request for disassociation, removing all association with the United Nations Department of Public Information, and released a letter stating that the reason for becoming associated with the United Nations Department of Information (DPI) was to access their facilities, and that they had not been aware of the change in language contained in the criteria for NGO association. However, when the Watch Tower Society sought NGO association, \"the organization agreed to meet criteria for association, including support and respect of the principles of the Charter of the United Nations\", acknowledging that the purpose of membership is to \"promote knowledge of the principles and activities of the United Nations.\"\n\nJehovah's Witnesses assert that Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonians in 607 BC and completely uninhabited for exactly seventy years. This date is critical to their selection of October 1914 for the arrival of Christ in kingly power—2520 years after October 607 BC. Non-Witness sources do not support 607 BC for the event, placing the destruction of Jerusalem within a year of 587 BC, twenty years later. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that periods of seventy years mentioned in the books of Jeremiah and Daniel refer to the Babylonian exile of Jews. They also believe that the gathering of Jews in Jerusalem, shortly after their return from Babylon, officially ended the exile in Jewish month of \"Tishrei\" (Ezra 3:1). According to the Watch Tower Society, October 607 BC is derived by counting back seventy years from \"Tishrei\" of 537 BC, based on their belief that Cyrus' decree to release the Jews during his first regnal year \"may have been made in late 538 B.C. or before March 4–5, 537 B.C.\"<ref name=\"WT 10/1\">\"When Was Ancient Jerusalem Destroyed?—Part One\" \"The Watchtower\", October 1, 2011, page 26</ref> Secular sources assign the return to either 538 BC or 537 BC.\n\nIn \"The Gentile Times Reconsidered: Chronology & Christ's Return\", Carl O. Jonsson, a former Witness, presents eighteen lines of evidence to support the traditional view of neo-Babylonian chronology. He accuses the Watch Tower Society of deliberately misquoting sources in an effort to bolster their position. The Watch Tower Society claims that biblical chronology is not always compatible with secular sources, and that the Bible is superior. It claims that secular historians make conclusions about 587 BC based on incorrect or inconsistent historical records, but accepts those sources that identify Cyrus' capture of Babylon in 539 BC, claiming it has no evidence of being inconsistent and hence can be used as a pivotal date.\n\nRolf Furuli, a Jehovah's Witness and a lecturer in Semitic languages, presents a study of 607 BC in support of the Witnesses' conclusions in \"Assyrian, Babylonian, Egyptian, and Persian Chronology Compared with the Chronology of the Bible, Volume 1: Persian Chronology and the Length of the Babylonian Exile of the Jews\". Lester L. Grabbe, professor of theology at the University of Hull, said of Furuli's study: \"Once again we have an amateur who wants to rewrite scholarship. ... F. shows little evidence of having put his theories to the test with specialists in Mesopotamian astronomy and Persian history.\"\n\nThe relative positions of the moon, stars and planets indicated in the Babylonian astronomical diary \"VAT 4956\" are used by secular historians to establish 568 BC as the thirty-seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign. The Watch Tower Society claims that unnamed researchers have confirmed that the positions of the moon and stars on the tablet are instead consistent with astronomical calculations for 588 BC; the Society claims that the \"planets\" mentioned in the tablet cannot be clearly identified.<ref name=\"WT 11/1\">\"When Was Ancient Jerusalem Destroyed?—Part Two\" \"The Watchtower\", November 1, 2011, page 25, 28, endnote 18</ref> The Watch Tower Society's article cites David Brown as stating, \"some of the signs for the names of the planets and their positions are unclear,\" however Brown indicates that the Babylonians also had unique names for the known planets; Jonsson confirms that the unique names are those used in VAT 4956.\n\nThe Watch Tower Society teaches a combination of gap creationism and day-age creationism. It dismisses Young Earth creationism as \"unscriptural and unbelievable\", and states that Jehovah's Witnesses \"are not creationists\" on the basis that they do not believe the earth was created in six literal days.\n\nWatch Tower Society publications attempt to refute the theory of evolution, in favor of divine creation. The Watch Tower Society's views of evolution have met with criticism typical of objections to evolution. Gary Botting described his own difficulty as a Jehovah's Witness to reconcile creation with simple observations of species diversification, especially after discussions with J.B.S. Haldane in India.\n\nThe Society's 1985 publication, \"Life—How Did it Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?\" is criticized for its dependency on Francis Hitching, who is cited thirteen times. The book presents Hitching—a TV writer and paranormalist with no scientific credentials—as an evolutionary scientist. Richard Dawkins also criticizes the book for implying that \"chance\" is the only alternative to deliberate design, stating, \"[T]he candidate solutions to the riddle of improbability are not, as falsely implied, design and chance. They are design and natural selection.\"\n\nDoctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses are established by the Governing Body, and the denomination does not tolerate dissent over doctrines and practices. Members who openly disagree with the movement's teachings are expelled and shunned. Witness publications strongly discourage followers from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the Governing Body, reasoning that it is to be trusted as part of \"God's organization\". They also warn members to \"avoid independent thinking\", claiming such thinking \"was introduced by Satan the Devil\" and would \"cause division\". Those who openly disagree with official teachings are condemned as \"apostates\" who are \"mentally diseased\".\nFormer Governing Body member Raymond Franz has accused the movement's Governing Body of resenting, deprecating and seeking to silence alternative viewpoints within the organization and demanding organizational conformity that overrides personal conscience. He claimed the Watch Tower Society confirmed its position when, in a 1954 court case in Scotland, Watch Tower Society legal counsel Hayden C. Covington said of Jehovah's Witnesses: \"We must have unity ... unity at all costs\". He also stated that Witnesses are subject to a disciplinary system that encourages informants.\n\nFranz and others have described Jehovah's Witnesses' meetings as \"catechistical\" question-and-answer sessions in which questions and answers are both provided by the organization, placing pressure on members to reiterate its opinions. Former Witnesses Heather and Gary Botting claimed Witnesses \"are told what they should feel and think\" and members who do voice viewpoints different from those expressed in publications and at meetings are viewed with suspicion. Raymond Franz has claimed most Witnesses would be fearful to voice criticism of the organization for fear of being accused of disloyalty. Authors have drawn attention to frequent Watch Tower warnings against the \"dangers\" and \"infection\" of \"independent thinking\", including questioning any of its published statements or teachings, and instructions that members refrain from engaging in independent Bible research. The Watch Tower Society also directs that members must not read criticism of the organization by \"apostates\" or material published by other religious organizations. Heather and Gary Botting stated, \"Jehovah's Witnesses will brook no criticism from within, as many concerned members who have attempted to voice alternative opinions regarding the basic doctrine or application of social pressure have discovered to their chagrin.\"\n\nHeather and Gary Botting argue that the power of the Watch Tower Society to control members is gained through the acceptance of the Society \"quite literally as the voice of Jehovah—God's 'mouthpiece'.\" Franz claims the concept of loyalty to God's organization has no scriptural support and serves only to reinforce the movement's authority structure, with its strong emphasis on human authority. He has claimed \"The Watchtower\" has repeatedly blurred discussions of both Jesus Christ's loyalty to God and the apostles' loyalty to Christ to promote the view that Witnesses should be loyal to the Watch Tower Society. Heather and Gary Botting have claimed that challenging the views of members higher in the hierarchy is regarded as tantamount to challenging God himself.\nThe Society has described its intolerance of dissident and divergent doctrinal views within its ranks as \"strict\", but claims its stance is based on the scriptural precedent of 2 Timothy 2:17, 18 in which the Apostle Paul condemns heretics Hymenaeus and Philetus who denied the resurrection of Jesus. It said: \"Following such Scriptural patterns, if a Christian (who claims belief in God, the Bible, and Jesus) unrepentantly promotes false teachings, it may be necessary for him to be expelled from the congregation ... Hence, the true Christian congregation cannot rightly be accused of being harshly dogmatic.\"\nSociologist Rodney Stark says that Jehovah's Witness leaders are \"not always very democratic\" and members are expected to conform to \"rather strict standards\", but that enforcement tends to be informal, sustained by close bonds of friendship, and that Jehovah's Witnesses see themselves as \"part of the power structure rather than subject to it\". Sociologist James A. Beckford, however, states that the Watchtower is intolerant of dissent or open discussion of doctrines and practices, and demands uniformity of beliefs from its members. He observed that the Society denies the legitimacy of all criticism of itself and that the habit of questioning official doctrine is \"strenuously combated at all organizational levels\". For similar reasons, Alan Rogerson describes the movement's leadership as totalitarian.\n\nDr. George D. Chryssides and Dr. James A. Beverley have reported that Witness publications teach that individuals' consciences are unreliable and need to be subordinated to scripture and to the Watch Tower Society. Beverley describes the belief that organizational loyalty is equal to divine loyalty as the \"central myth\" of Jehovah's Witnesses employed to ensure complete obedience. Andrew Holden has also observed that Witnesses see no distinction between loyalty to Jehovah and to the movement itself. According to him, Witnesses are \"under official surveillance\" within the congregation. He noted that members who cannot conscientiously agree with all the movement's teachings are expelled and shunned. He also said that Witnesses are taught their theology in a highly mechanistic fashion, learning almost by rote.\n\nAuthors Anthony A. Hoekema, Ron Rhodes and Alan W. Gomes claim Jehovah's Witnesses is a religious cult. Hoekema bases his judgment on a range of what he describes as general characteristics of a cult, including the tendency to elevate peripheral teachings (such as door-to-door preaching) to great prominence, extra-scriptural source of authority (Hoekema highlights Watch Tower teachings that the Bible may be understood only as it is interpreted by the Governing Body), a view of the group as the exclusive community of the saved (Watch Tower publications teach that Witnesses alone are God's people and only they will survive Armageddon) and the group's central role in eschatology (Hoekema says Witness publications claim the group was called into existence by God to fill in a gap in the truth neglected by existing churches, marking the climax of sacred history).\n\nJehovah's Witnesses state that they are not a cult and say that although individuals need proper guidance from God, they should do their own thinking.\n\nIn 1992, American religious scholar J. Gordon Melton placed the Jehovah's Witnesses denomination in a list of \"established cults\". However, he and others have since been more reluctant to use the term \"cult\" for various groups, including Jehovah's Witnesses, because the term is considered too controversial. Ex-cult watchdog John Bowen Brown II and \"Knocking\" producer Joel P. Engardio also reject the assertion that Jehovah's Witnesses is a cult. The two-volume encyclopedia \"Contemporary American Religion\" stated, \"Various critics and ex-members in recent years have wrongly labeled Jehovah's Witnesses a 'cult.'\"\n\nSince 1920 the Watch Tower Society has required all congregation members participating in the preaching work to turn in written reports of the amount of their activity, explaining that the reports help the Society to plan its activities and identify areas of greater need and help congregation elders to identify those who may need assistance. In 1943 the Society imposed personal quotas, requiring all active Witnesses to spend at least 60 hours of door-to-door preaching per month, claiming these were \"directions from the Lord\". Although these quotas were subsequently removed, Raymond Franz claims \"invisible\" quotas remained, obliging Witnesses to meet certain levels of preaching work to remain in good standing in the congregation or to qualify for eldership. Franz describes repeated urging for adherents to \"put kingdom interests first\" and devote increasing amounts of time to door-to-door preaching efforts as coercive pressure. He says many Witnesses constantly feel guilty that they are not doing more in \"field activity\".\n\nFormer Witnesses Heather and Gary Botting, claiming an emphasis on a personal track record would mean that salvation is effectively being \"bought\" with \"good works\", observed: \"No matter how long a Witness remains an active distributor of literature, the moment he ceases to be active he is regarded by his peers as good as dead in terms of achieving the ultimate goal of life everlasting in an earthly paradise ... Few realize upon entering the movement that the purchase price is open-ended and that the bill can never be paid in full until death or the advent of Armageddon.\"\n\n\"The Watchtower\", however, noted that although public preaching is necessary, such works do not \"save\" a Christian and it urged Witnesses to examine their motive for engaging in preaching activity.\n\nAccording to Andrew Holden, \"those who fail to devote a satisfactory amount of time to doorstep evangelism (currently around seventeen hours per month in the United States) soon lose the respect of their co-religionists and may even be disfellowshipped. The Witnesses are thus forced to think quantitatively about their salvation.\"\n\nMedical and legal commentators have noted cases, claiming that Witness medical patients were coerced to obey the denomination's ban on blood transfusions. According to Osamu Muramoto, in the \"Journal of Medical Ethics\", those who unrepentantly receive prohibited blood products are labeled \"apostates\", expelled, and shunned by other Jehovah's Witness friends or family members. He also states that \"there is considerable documentation that [Jehovah's Witnesses] can be subject to psychological coercion\".\n\nIn a case involving a review of a Russian district court decision, the European Court of Human Rights found nothing in the judgements to suggest that any form of improper pressure or undue influence was applied. It noted: \"On the contrary, it appears that many Jehovah's Witnesses have made a deliberate choice to refuse blood transfusions in advance, free from time constraints of an emergency situation.\" The court said: \"The freedom to accept or refuse specific medical treatment, or to select an alternative form of treatment, is vital to the principles of self-determination and personal autonomy. A competent adult patient is free to decide ... not to have a blood transfusion. However, for this freedom to be meaningful, patients must have the right to make choices that accord with their own views and values, regardless of how irrational, unwise or imprudent such choices may appear to others.\" However, the court acknowledged that coercion by the group to reject blood transfusion may be involved, stating \"even though the Jehovah's Witnesses whose opposition to blood transfusions was cited in evidence were adults having legal capacity to refuse that form of treatment, the findings of the Russian courts can be understood to mean that their refusals had not been an expression of their true will but rather the product of pressure exerted on them by the applicant community. The Court accepts that, given that health and possibly life itself are at stake in such situations, the authenticity of the patient's refusal of medical treatment is a legitimate concern.\"\n\nWitnesses practice disfellowshipping of members who unrepentantly engage in \"gross sin\", (most commonly for breaches of the Witnesses' code of personal morality), and \"remorseless apostasy\". The process of disfellowshipping is said to be carried to uphold God’s standards, preserve the congregation’s spiritual cleanness, and possibly prompt a change of attitude in the wrongdoer. The practice requires that the expelled person be shunned by all members of the group, including family members who do not live in the same home, unless they qualify for re-admission. A person who dies while disfellowshipped cannot be given a funeral at a Kingdom Hall. Members often face difficulties and trauma once expelled because of their previously limited contact with the outside world. \"The Watchtower\"s description of those who leave as being \"mentally diseased\" has drawn criticism from some current and former members; in Britain some have argued that the description may constitute a breach of laws regarding religious hatred.\n\nThe Watch Tower Society has attracted criticism for disfellowshipping members who decide they cannot conscientiously agree with all the denomination's teachings and practices. Sociologist Andrew Holden says that because the group provides no valid reason for leaving, those who do choose to leave are regarded as traitors. According to Raymond Franz, those who decide they cannot accept Watch Tower teachings and practices often live in a climate of fear, feeling they must constantly be on guard about what they say, do and read. He says those who do express any disagreement, even in a private conversation with friends, risk investigation and trial by a judicial committee as apostates or heretics and classed as \"wicked\".\n\nFranz argues that the threat of expulsion for expressing disagreement with the Watch Tower Society's teachings is designed to create a sterile atmosphere in which the organization's teachings and policies can circulate without the risk of confronting serious questioning or adverse evidence. The result, according to Holden, is that individuals may spend most of their lives suppressing doubts for fear of losing their relationships with friends and relatives. Penton describes the system of judicial committees and the threat of expulsion as the ultimate control mechanism among the Witnesses; Holden claims that shunning not only rids the community of defilement, but deters others from dissident behavior. Sociologist Ronald Lawson has also noted that the group allows little room for independence of thought, and no toleration of doctrinal diversity. He said those who deviate from official teachings are readily expelled and shunned.\n\nWatch Tower Society publications defend the practice of expelling and shunning those who \"promote false teaching\", claiming such individuals must be quarantined to prevent the spread of their \"spiritual infection\". They have cited a dictionary definition of apostasy (\"renunciation of a religious faith, abandonment of a previous loyalty\") to rule that an individual who begins affiliating with another religious organization has disassociated from the Witnesses, warranting their shunning to protect the spiritual cleanness of the Witness congregation on the basis of the reference in 1 John 2:19 that those who leave Christianity are \"not of our sort\". An individual's acceptance of a blood transfusion is similarly deemed as evidence of disassociation. They say Witnesses also obey the \"strong counsel\" at 1 Corinthians 5:11 that Christians should \"quit mixing in company\" with people who unrepentantly reject certain scriptural standards.\n\nThe Witnesses' judicial process has also been criticized. Hearings take place in secret, with judicial committees filling the roles of judge, jury and prosecutor. According to Franz, witnesses may present evidence but are not permitted to remain for the discussion. Critics Heather and Gary Botting have claimed that Witnesses accused of an offence warranting expulsion are presumed guilty until found innocent. They say the onus is on the accused to prove their innocence and if they make no attempt to do so—by failing to appear at a hearing set by the judicial committee—they are assumed to be guilty and unrepentant.\n\nWhen a decision is made regarding disfellowshipping or disassociation, an announcement is made that the person is \"no longer one of Jehovah's Witnesses,\" at which point shunning is immediate. Members are not told whether the person has disassociated or has been disfellowshipped. Neither testimony nor evidence in support of the judicial decision are provided. Congregation members are told to accept the rulings without question and Witnesses who refuse to abide by a judicial committee decision will themselves suffer expulsion. Members are forbidden to talk with the expelled member, removing any opportunity for the person to discuss or explain their actions. Penton claims judicial committee members and the Watch Tower Society frequently ignore established procedures when dealing with troublesome individuals, conspiring to have them expelled in violation of Society rules. Critics claim that Witness policies encourage an informer system to report to elders Witnesses suspected of having committed an act that could warrant expulsion, including deviating from organizational policies and teachings.\n\nCriticism has also been directed at the 1981 change of policy that directed that persons who disassociate from (formally leave) the group were to be treated as though they were disfellowshipped. Holden says that as a result, those who do leave are seldom allowed a dignified exit. Heather and Gary Botting claim inactive Witnesses are often pressured to either become active or to disassociate themselves by declaring they no longer accept key Watch Tower Society doctrines.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses reject transfusions of whole allogenic blood and its primary components (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and plasma), and transfusions of stored autologous blood or its primary components. As a doctrine, Jehovah's Witnesses do not reject transfusion of whole autologous blood so long as it is not stored prior to surgery (e.g. peri-operative extraction and transfusion of autologous blood). This religious position is due to their belief that blood is sacred and represents life in God's eyes. Jehovah's Witnesses understand scriptures such as Leviticus 17:10-14 (which speaks of not eating blood) and Acts 15:29 (\"abstain from blood\") to include taking blood into the body via a transfusion. Controversy has stemmed, however, from what critics state are inconsistencies in Witness policies on blood, claims that Witness patients are coerced into refusing blood and that Watch Tower literature distorts facts about transfusions and fails to provide information that would allow Witnesses to make an informed decision on the issue.\n\nIn the case of minor fractions derived from blood, each individual is directed to follow their own conscience on whether these are acceptable. Consequently, some Jehovah's Witnesses accept the use of blood fractions and others do not. However, fractions that carry out \"the key function of a primary component\" or make up \"a significant portion of that component\" are not permitted.\n\nSuch a stance of dividing blood into major components and minor fractions rather than either accepting all blood or requiring all blood components to be poured out onto the ground has led to criticism from organizations such as the \"Associated Jehovah's Witnesses for Reform on Blood\". Witnesses respond that blood as the fluid \"per se\" is not the real issue. They say the real issue is \"respect\" and \"obedience\" regarding blood, which they perceive as being God's personal property. Members are allowed to eat meat that still contains small traces of blood remaining. Once blood is drained from an animal, the \"respect\" has been shown to God and then a person can eat the meat. Jehovah's Witnesses view of meat and blood is therefore different from the Jewish view that goes to great lengths to remove even minor traces of blood.\n\nAccording to lawyer Kerry Louderback-Wood, a former Jehovah's Witness, the Watch Tower Society misrepresents the scope of allowed fractions. If taken together, they \"total the entire volume of blood they came from\". An example of this can be seen in blood plasma, which consists of 90-96% water. The remaining amount consists mainly of albumin, globulins, fibrinogen and coagulation factors. These four fractions are allowable for use, but only if taken separately. Raymond Franz has likened this to banning the eating of a ham and cheese sandwich but allowing the eating of bread, ham and cheese separately.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses believe that storing blood violates direction from the Bible to 'pour blood out onto the ground'. They do not donate blood except for uses they have individually pre-approved. However, they are told that acceptance of blood fractions from donated blood is a matter of conscience. A 2006 issue of Jehovah's Witnesses' newsletter \"Our Kingdom Ministry\" stated, \"Although [Jehovah's Witnesses] do not donate or store their own blood \"for transfusion purposes\", some procedures or tests involving an individual’s blood are not so clearly in conflict with Bible principles. Therefore, each individual should make a conscientious decision\" [emphasis added]. Raymond Franz has challenged these policies because acceptable blood fractions can only be derived from stored blood provided by donors.\n\nRegardless of the medical considerations, Jehovah Witnesses advocate that physicians should uphold the right of a patient to choose what treatments they do or do not accept (though a Witness is subject to religious sanctions if they exercise their right to choose a blood transfusion). Accordingly, US courts tend not to hold physicians responsible for adverse health effects that a patient incurred out of his or her own requests. However, the point of view that physicians must, in all circumstances, abide by the religious wishes of the patients is not acknowledged by all jurisdictions, such as was determined in a case involving Jehovah's Witnesses in France.\n\nThe situation has been controversial, particularly in the case of children. In the United States, many physicians will agree to explore and exhaust all non-blood alternatives in the treatment of children at the request of their legal guardians. Some state laws require physicians to administer blood-based treatment to minors if it is their professional opinion that it is necessary to prevent immediate death or severe permanent damage.\n\nEven when an adult's life is at stake, some philosophers argue that since blood refusal is based on irrational beliefs, the patient's decision may be challenged.\n\nKerry Louderback-Wood has claimed that Jehovah's Witnesses' legal corporations are potentially liable to significant claims for compensation if the organization misrepresents the medical risks of blood transfusions. Wood claims that constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion do not remove the legal responsibility that every person or organization has regarding misrepresenting secular fact.\n\n\"The Watchtower\" has stated that \"Various medical products have been obtained from biological sources, either animal or human ... Such commercialization of ... blood is hardly tempting for true Christians, who guide their thinking by God's perfect law. Our Creator views blood as sacred, representing God-given life ... blood removed from a creature was to be poured out on the ground, disposed of.\"\n\nFormer Jehovah's Witness Bill Bower, founder of Silentlambs, accuses Jehovah's Witnesses of employing organizational policies of not reporting sexual abuse cases to authorities to protect the organisation's reputation. The Religioustolerance site states that the consequence of keeping the cases secrets is that \"there is a very high probability that the abuse will continue.\" Some victims of sexual abuse have asserted that when reporting abuse they were ordered to maintain silence by their local elders to avoid embarrassment to both the accused and the organization.\n\nThe movement's official policy on child protection, which discusses the procedures for reporting child sexual abuse, states that elders obey all legal requirements for reporting sex offenders, including reporting uncorroborated or unsubstantiated allegations where required by law. Elders are to discipline pedophiles in the congregation. Victims are permitted to notify the authorities if they wish to do so.\n\nWhile a Witness may lose congregation privileges following a single credible accusation of abuse, Jehovah's Witnesses claim to be scripturally obliged to require corroboration before applying their severest forms of congregational discipline. If there is not an actual second witness to an incident of abuse, a congregation judicial committee will accept medical or police reports, or a witness to a separate but similar incident as such a second witness against a member accused of sexual abuse.\n\nThe Watch Tower Society has been criticized for its refusal to reveal the names and academic credentials of the translators of its \"New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures\" (NWT). The Society has claimed members of the NWT's translation committee wished to remain anonymous in order to exalt only the name of God, \"The Watchtower\" stating that the educational qualifications of the translators were unimportant and that \"the translation itself testifies to their qualifications\". Raymond Franz, a former member of the Governing Body, has claimed that of the four men he says constituted the committee, only one—its principal translator, his uncle Frederick Franz—had sufficient knowledge of biblical languages to have attempted the project. Frederick Franz had studied Greek for two years and was self-taught in Hebrew.\n\nMuch criticism of the NWT involves the rendering of certain texts considered to be biased towards specific Witness practices and doctrines. These include the use of \"torture stake\" instead of \"cross\" throughout the New Testament; the rendering of , with the insertion of the indefinite article (\"a\") in its rendering to give \"the Word was \"a\" god\"; Romans 10:10, which uses the term \"public declaration\", which may reinforce the imperative to engage in public preaching; John 17:3, which used the term \"taking in knowledge\" rather than \"know\" to suggest that salvation is dependent on ongoing study, and the placement of the comma in Luke 23:43, which affects the timing of the fulfillment of Jesus' promise to the thief at Calvary.\n\nAlso criticized is the NWT's insertion of the name \"Jehovah\" 237 times in the New Testament without extant New Testament Greek manuscript evidence that the name existed there. Watch Tower publications have claimed that the name was \"restored\" on a sound basis, stating that when New Testament writers quote earlier Old Testament scriptures containing the Tetragrammaton (יהוה), \"the translator has the right to render Kyrios (\"LORD\") as Jehovah.\" The NWT mentions twenty-seven other translations which have similarly rendered \"Kyrios\" as a form of the name \"Jehovah\", stating that there is only one verse where the NWT does so without agreement from other translations.\n\nThe Society has claimed its translation \"courageously restores God’s name, Jehovah, to its proper place in the Biblical text, is free from the bias of religious traditionalism, and ... gives the literal meaning of God’s Word as accurately as possible.\" Jason BeDuhn, associate professor of religious studies at Northern Arizona University, in Flagstaff, Arizona, compared major translations for accuracy. He stated that whilst there are \"a handful of examples of bias in the [New World Translation (NW)]\", that \"most of the differences are due to the greater accuracy of the NW as a literal, conservative translation of the original expressions of the New Testament writers.\" He also wrote that the NWT's introduction of the name \"Jehovah\" into the New Testament 237 times was \"not accurate translation by the most basic principle of accuracy\". He concluded that \"the NW and [another translation] are not bias free, and they are not perfect translations. But they are remarkably good translations ... often better than [the other six translations analyzed].\" In his rebuttal, Thomas Howe strongly criticizes BeDuhn's positive review of the \"New World Translation\", stating that the main goal of BeDuhn's book is to deny the deity of Christ.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29034128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29034128", "title": "Desert Mothers", "text": "Desert Mothers\n\nThe Desert Mothers were female Christian ascetics living in the desert of Egypt, Palestine, and Syria in the 4th and 5th centuries AD. They typically lived in the monastic communities that began forming during that time, though sometimes they lived as hermits. Other women from that era who influenced the early ascetic or monastic tradition while living outside the desert are also described as Desert Mothers.\n\nThe Desert Fathers are much more well known because most of the early lives of the saints \"were written by men for a male monastic audience\"—the occasional stories about the Desert Mothers come from the early Desert Fathers and their biographers. Many desert women had leadership roles within the Christian community. The \"Apophthegmata Patrum\", or \"Sayings of the Desert Fathers\", includes forty-seven sayings that are actually attributed to the Desert Mothers. There are several chapters dedicated to the Desert Mothers in the \"Lausiac History\" by Palladius, who mentions 2,975 women living in the desert. Other sources include the various stories told over the years about the lives of saints of that era, traditionally called \"vitae\" (\"life\"). The lives of twelve female desert saints are described in Book I of \"Vitae Patrum\" (\"Lives of the Fathers\").\n\nThe Desert Mothers were known as \"ammas\" (\"spiritual mothers\"), comparable to the Desert Fathers (\"abbas\"), due to the respect they earned as spiritual teachers and directors. One of the most well known Desert Mothers was Amma Syncletica of Alexandria, who had twenty-seven sayings attributed to her in the \"Sayings of the Desert Fathers\". Two other \"ammas\", Theodora of Alexandria and Amma Sarah of the Desert, also had sayings in that book. Desert Mothers described in the \"Lausiac History\" include Melania the Elder, Melania the Younger, Olympias, Saint Paula and her daughter Eustochium, and several women whom the author does not name.\n\nAccording to written accounts, Amma Syncletica might have been born around AD 270, since she is said to have lived to her eighties in about AD 350, to wealthy parents in Alexandria and was well educated, including an early study of the writings of Desert Father Evagrius Ponticus. After the death of her parents, she sold everything she had and gave the money to the poor. Moving outside the city with her blind sister, she lived as a hermit among the tombs outside of Alexandria. Gradually a community of women ascetics grew up around her, who she served as their spiritual mother. Even though she was an ascetic and hermit, Syncletica taught moderation, and that asceticism was not an end in itself.\n\nTheodora of Alexandria was the \"amma\" of a monastic community of women near Alexandria. Prior to that, she had fled to the desert disguised as a man and joined a community of monks. She was sought out by many of the Desert Fathers for advice—reportedly Bishop Theophilus of Alexandria came to her for counsel.\n\nSarah of the Desert's sayings indicate that she was a hermit living by a river for sixty years. Her sharp replies to some of the old men who challenged her show a distinctly strong personality. According to one story, two male anchorites visited her in the desert and decided, \"Let's humiliate this old woman.\" They said to her, \"Be careful not to become conceited thinking to yourself: \"Look how anchorites are coming to see me, a mere woman.\" She replied, \"According to nature I am a woman, but not according to my thoughts.\"\n\nMelania the Elder, the daughter of a Roman official, became widowed at a young age and moved to Alexandria, and then to the Nitrian Desert. She met several of the Desert Fathers, following them in their travels and ministering to them using her own money. At one point she was thrown into prison for supporting them, after several of the Fathers had been banished by the officials in Palestine. She eventually founded a convent in Jerusalem which had about fifty nuns. Her granddaughter, Melania the Younger, was married at the age of thirteen and had two sons, both of whom died at a young age. When she was twenty, she and her husband Pinianus renounced the world, both founding convents and monasteries.\n\nAccording to Averil Cameron, women were quite prominent in the desert tradition, even though early accounts often leave women nameless. In Cameron’s opinion there is no distinction between the men’s wise sayings and that of Amma Sarah and Amma Syncletia. One text refers to Theodora, who had monks listening to her counsel and asking questions. Some women converted their houses into religious establishments and there were gender-mixed social/religious groups. Women could not obtain ordination as a deacon or a priest.\n\n"}

{"id": "1822818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822818", "title": "First Communion", "text": "First Communion\n\nFirst Communion is a ceremony in some Christian traditions during which a person first receives the Eucharist. It is most common in the Latin Church tradition of the Catholic Church, as well as in many parts of the Lutheran Church and Anglican Communion. In churches that celebrate First Communion, it typically occurs between the ages of seven and thirteen, often acting as a rite of passage.\n\nCatholics believe this event to be very important, as the Eucharist occupies a central role in Catholic theology and practice.\n\nFirst Communion is not celebrated in the Eastern Orthodox churches, the Oriental Orthodox churches, or the Assyrian Church of the East, as they practice infant communion (which often is simultaneously administered with infant baptism and confirmation). Some Anglicans allow infant communion, while others require the previous reception of confirmation, usually during the teenage years.\n\nCelebration of this ceremony is typically less elaborate in many Protestant churches. Catholics and some Protestants believe that Christ is truly present in the Eucharist, although only Catholics and some Anglo-Catholics of the Anglican Communion believe this is through transubstantiation.\n\nOther denominations have varying understandings, ranging from the Eucharist being a symbolic meal to a meal of remembering Christ's last supper.\n\nThe sacrament of First Communion is an important tradition for Catholic families and individuals. For Catholics, Holy Communion is the third of seven sacraments received. It occurs only after receiving Baptism, and once the person has reached the age of reason (usually, around the second grade). First confession (the first sacrament of penance) must precede the reception of the Eucharist. This order of the sacraments is practiced universally by all Latin rite Catholics. In 1910, Pope Pius X issued the decree \"Quam singulari\", which changed the age at which First Communion is taken to 7 years old. Previously, local standards had been 10 or 12 or even 14 years old. Byzantine Catholics (Eastern Rite) celebrate the sacraments of baptism, confirmation (Chrismation), and Holy Communion on the same day as an infant's baptism.\n\nTraditions of celebration surrounding First Communion usually include large family gatherings and parties to celebrate the event. The first communicant wears special clothing. The clothing is often white to symbolize purity, but not in all cultures. Often, a girl wears a fancy dress and a veil attached to a chaplet of flowers or some other hair ornament. In other communities, girls commonly wear dresses passed down to them from sisters or mothers, or even simply their school uniforms with the veil or wreath. Boys may wear a suit and tie, tuxedo, their Sunday best, or national dress, with embroidered arm bands worn on the left arm and occasionally white gloves.\n\nIn many Latin American countries, boys wear military-style dress uniforms with gold braid aiguillettes. In Switzerland, both boys and girls wear plain white robes with brown wooden crosses around their necks. In Spain, Germany, Luxembourg, Austria, and Guam, girls are dressed up as little brides, although this has been partly replaced by albs in recent times.\n\nIn Scotland, boys traditionally wear kilts and other traditional Scottish dress which accompany the kilt. In the Philippines, First Communion services often occur on or around the Feast of the Immaculate Conception (the country's patron saint), with boys donning either the Barong Tagalog or semi-formal Western dress, and girls a plain white dress and sometimes a veil.\n\nGifts of a religious nature are usually given, such as rosaries, prayer books, religious statues, icons, and holy cards. Monetary gifts are also common.\n\nMany families have formal professional photographs taken in addition to candid snapshots in order to commemorate the event. Some churches arrange for a professional photographer after the ceremony.\n\nDuring the communist era, initiation into the pioneer movement in communist countries that had large Catholic populations was an overt attempt to supplant the Catholic ritual (e.g., the Union of Pioneers of Yugoslavia). In all cases, a child at the age of seven to ten is initiated as a member of a group within which the individuals share certain values and culture.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1769679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1769679", "title": "Frahang-i Pahlavig", "text": "Frahang-i Pahlavig\n\nFrahang-ī Pahlavīg (Middle Persian: 𐭯𐭥𐭧𐭭𐭢 𐭯𐭧𐭫𐭥𐭩𐭪‎‎ \"Pahlavi dictionary\") is the title of an anonymous dictionary of unknown date of (mostly) Aramaic logograms with Middle Persian translations (in Pahlavi script) and transliterations (in Pazend script). The glossary was previously known to Indian Zoroastrians (the Parsis) as the \"mna-xvatay\" (traditionally pronounced \"mona khoda\"), a name derived from the first two words of the first entry/lemma. The \"Frahang-i Pahlavig\" should not be confused with the \"Frahang-i Oim-evak\", which is a glossary of Avestan language terms.\nThe oldest surviving example of a \"Frahang\"-like text is a one-page fragment discovered at Turpan that is believed to date to the 9th or 10th century CE. Several more complete manuscripts exist in Bombay, Oxford, Paris, and Copenhagen, but the oldest of these dates to the 15th century and is missing a second folio and all of folio 28 onwards. In the earliest edition made available to European scholarship, the \"Frahang\" is arranged serially; that is, according to the shape of the Aramaic characters. That edition, obtained by Abraham Anquetil-Duperron in the mid-18th century, is today in the Bibliothèque nationale, Paris. In 1867, Hoshangji Jamaspji Asa and Martin Haug published a transcript of a manuscript that was arranged thematically by chapter.\n\nThe existence of similar glossaries from Akkadian times (explaining Sumerian logograms) led an Assyriologist, Erich Ebeling, to explain that many of the words in the \"Frahang\" were derived from Sumerian or Akkadian. This led to a number of \"far-fetched interpretations,\" which were then subsequently incorporated into a number of later interpretations, including those of Iranists, so effectively making even these unreliable.\n\nThe glossary encompasses approximately five hundred (not counting variations) Semitic language heterograms (\"huzvarishn\", \"probably mean[ing] 'obsoleteness, antiquity, or archaism'\"), \"in the form used by Zoroastrians in writing Middle Persian (Book Pahlavi), each explained by a \"phonetic\" writing of the corresponding Persian word.\" Besides heterograms of Aramaic origin, the \"Frahang\" also has a handful of pseudo-heterograms from \"Arabic words coined by later scribes\" and \"scattered examples of historical spellings of Iranian words, no longer recognized as such.\" Altogether about 1300 words (including word forms) are represented, \"but its original extent appears to have been only 1000 words, excluding the appendices.\" Several heterograms are not attested in any other text.\n\nWhile the one-page Turpan fragment lists various forms for verbs followed by one Middle Persian translation (in the infinitive), other manuscripts list at most three verb forms, but then provide Middle Persian equivalents of each. The primary elements (logogram(s) and translation) \"are then transcribed interlinearly, and more or less corruptly, into Avestan letters, i.e., into Pāzand, whereby the heterograms appear in their traditional mnemonic pronunciation. Because of the ambiguity of the Pahlavi script this is often far removed from the original Aramaic spellings.\" In the manuscript examined by Asa and Haug, the \"huzvarishn\" and translations are in black, and the Pazend transliterations are in red (the first chapter is an exception, and is entirely in black).\n\nSubstituting Latin characters (and written left-to-right) for Pahlavi and Pazend ones (which are written right-to-left), \"Frahang\" glosses look like this:\n\nThus, \"king\" would be written but understood in Iran to be the \"sign\" for 'shāh'.\n\nIn the Asa and Haug manuscript, the \"Frahang\" is organized thematically, divided into (approximately) thirty chapters. Eighteen of these chapters have titles (listed below in italics), the others do not. West ends his description at chapter 23 as \"no further chapters are indicated.\" The last section/chapter is a collection of older Iranian language words (and variant spellings), with more modern words explaining the older terms. \n \n"}

It was formed in 1922, after a split from the General Jewish Labour Bund in 1921 (which had seen the emergence of the \"Kombund fraktsie\", 'Communist Bund fraction' inside the Bund). The split was provoked by disagreements over whether the Polish Bund should join the Communist International. At the first Polish Bund conference in 1920 a majority resolution passed, calling for the party to join the Communist International. The decision was never executed however, leading to the split and the formation of Kombund. The Kombund was founded in late January 1922, by Communist Bundist groups. The new party affiliated itself to the Communist International, adopting the twenty-one conditions. Around 25% of the Bund membership in Poland joined the Kombund.\n\nAccording to one account, around 50% of the Bundist membership in Łódź had joined Kombund. The local Bundist newspaper, \"Lodzer veker\", was taken over by Kombund.\n\nImmediately after the split, the Bund and Kombund began fighting over control of trade unions. Important leaders of the textile, leather and paper workers' unions had sided with the Kombund in the split. The leather workers' union was seized by Kombund, soon to be followed by the clothing workers' union.\n\nKombund published \"Unser Gedenk\" ('Our Thought') from Łódź.\n\nSoon after the foundation of the Kombund, negotiations began with the Communist Party of Poland regarding a merger between the two parties. In September the final decision was taken on the Kombund's merger into the Polish Communist Party. Just before the merger, the Kombund has suffered setbacks in trade union elections in Łódź and Cracow.\n\nShortly after the merger, the Polish Communist Party established its Central Jewish Bureau.\n\n"}

{"id": "18358856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18358856", "title": "Kanjō", "text": "Kanjō\n\n\"Kanjō\" was originally a Buddhist term and later entered the Shinto vocabulary. A \"kanjō\" was the request of the Buddha's sermon with a sincere heart, and later came to mean the urging of a buddha or bodhisattva to remain in this world to preach and save other human beings. The concept then evolved further to mean the act (and the actual words) of asking buddhas or bodhisattvas to descend to the altar during a Buddhist service. In Japan, the word gradually assumed the present meaning of enshrinement of a \"buddha\" or \"kami\" in a building for the first time.\n\nBefore it can be transferred to its new location the \"kami\" must be divided. The division sub-process and the divided spirit itself are called , or .　The process of propagation, described by the priests as akin to the lighting of a candle from another already lit, leaves the original \"kami\" intact in its original place and therefore doesn't alter any of its properties. The \"wakemitama\" has all the qualities of the original and is therefore \"alive\" and permanent. The process is used often, for example during Shinto festivals (\"Matsuri\") to animate temporary shrines called and their \"mikoshi\".\n\nThe \"kami\" Inari has been subjected to the \"kanjō\" process more often than any other \"kami\", and is therefore a good example of its use.\n\nThe transfer does not necessarily take place from a shrine to another: the new location can be a privately owned object or an individual house. The case is recorded of Inari being re-enshrined in a fox hole In fact, the first recorded Inari \"kanjō\", in 842, involved the \"kami\"'s transfer to Ono no Takamura scepter. The \"kami\" was then transported to Mutsu no Kuni (Aomori) by its owner. Some years later he returned to Kyoto, and Aomori's people asked him to leave the spirit behind, which he did in what would become Takekoma Inari.\n\nIn 1194, Emperor Go-Toba decided that only Fushimi Inari Shrine could perform any of the parts of the Inari \"kanjō\", however abuses were such that the shrine started providing an authenticity certificate with each divided spirit. The process was briefly outlawed nationwide during the Meiji era, but was brought back by popular demand and nowadays most large Inari shrines will perform it for a fee, sometimes decided by the shrine, sometimes left to the discretion of the worshiper. As of 1990, Fushimi Inari Shrine had performed it eighty thousand times for private citizens.\n\nWhen one of Inari's forms is reenshrined with a different name, it may also be worshiped for a specific function. All the new functions are thereafter assumed to be specialties of the \"kami\", particularly in case of a great success in the reenshrinement, even when those functions are very far from its original nature, as for instance fishing is in Inari's case.\n\n"}
{"id": "6962248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6962248", "title": "Kashaya (Jainism)", "text": "Kashaya (Jainism)\n\nIn Jainism, Kashaya (loose translation: \"Passion\") are aspects of a person that can be gained during his or her worldly life. According to the Jaina religion as long as a person has Kashayas, they will not escape the cycle of life and death. There are four different kind of Kashayas, each being able to gain their own kinds of intensity.\n\nAccording to the Jain text, \"Sarvārthasiddhi\", \"He who has passions causes injury to himself by himself. Whether injury is then caused to other living beings or not, it is immaterial.\"\n\nSpiritually, the goal of Jainism is to rid oneself of the worldly life and become free from the cycle of reincarnation. When one develop attachment or passions, this hinders the spiritual progress of their soul. Jainas believe that by reacting without passion and staying tranquil, one can break the cycle which forms more karma.\n\nThe four \"kasaya\" are: \"krodha\" (anger), \"lobha\" (greed), \"mana\" (ego) and \"maya\" (deceit). Out of the many causes of bondage, emotions or passions are considered as the main cause of \"bandha\" or bondage. The karmas are literally bound on account of the stickiness of the soul due to existence of various passions or mental dispositions. The passions like anger, pride, deceit and greed are called sticky (\"kaṣāyas\") because they act like glue in making karmic particles stick to the soul resulting in \"bandha\". The karmic inflow on account of \"yoga\" driven by passions and emotions cause a long term inflow of karma prolonging the cycle of reincarnations. On the other hand, the karmic inflows on account of actions that are not driven by passions and emotions have only a transient, short-lived karmic effect. Hence the ancient Jain texts talk of subduing these negative emotions: Negating kashayas can be done by remembering the opposites of kasahayas : Opposite of Krodha (Anger) is Kshama (Forgiveness). To avoid Krodha kashayas, one needs to remember to forgive. Opposite of lobha (greed) is Daan (Charity), one needs to remember to give away. Opposite of Mana(Ego) is humility, one needs to be humble. Opposite of Deceit is honesty, one needs to be honest in all conditions to not get deceit kashayas. \n\nMost difficult Kashaya to overcome is Greed. \n\nWhen he wishes that which is good for him, he should get rid of the four faults—anger, pride, deceit and greed—which increase the evil. Anger and pride when not suppressed, and deceit and greed when arising: all these four black passions water the roots of re-birth.\n\n—\"Daśavaikālika sūtra, 8:36–39\"\n\n\nThe degrees of strength of the kasayas are illustrated by examples. The 4 species of anger are to be likened unto a line drawn in stone, in earth, in dust and in water. The first can only be removed with great effort, each following one always more easily. Likewise also, the lifelong enduring anger is only combated in its effect with exceeding strength and difficulty whilst the effect of the three remaining species accordingly diminishes in power and can, therefore, also more easily be destroyed. The degrees of pride are to be likened unto a pillar of stone, a bone, a piece of wood, and the vine of a creeper; the inflexibility correspondingly decreases. The species of deceitfulness are to be compared to a bamboo root, the horn of a ram, the urine of a cow, and a piece of wood. The crookedness of each of these is removed more easily than in the one preceding it. (The zig zag line of the cow's urine disappears through the influence of wind and weather.) The degrees of greed correspond to scarlet colour, to greater or smaller dirt, and to a spot of turmeric, which soil a garment: the scarlet is hardly removable, the dirt with more or less trouble, and the spot of turmeric can be removed with ease.\n\n\n"}

Sotelo is a devout LaVeyan Satanist and politically liberal. He has written several books on different aspects of Satanism and donated to a number of Satanic candidates and causes. In 2015 he made an unsuccessful run for a seat on the United States House of Representatives. In 2017, Sotelo began showing interest in running for U.S. Senate in California, against incumbent Democrat Dianne Feinstein, he declined on June 8, 2018.\n\n Sotelo was born in East Los Angeles, California to Valentino Sotelo, a security guard who owned several gun dealerships, and Betty Sotelo, a dietary supervisor. Before dropping out of Garfield High School his parents supported his musical interests, as he tried a number of instruments; his favorites were the guitar and keyboards. As a teenager, Sotelo frequently ran into trouble with the law. He is a member of the \"Juarez Maravilla\" street gang in the Eastside of Los Angeles. Sotelo released several pre-gangsta demos with his band on Los Angeles-based punk label Epitaph Records. He made his professional debut as a rap artist in 2005 as a tribute to his rival Kid Frost and although he is known as a Chicano rapper, he is of Filipino and Spaniard descent.\n\nIn 2006, Sotelo was ordained into the Universal Life Church, and subsequently helped set up the first Satanic branch of the church called The Satanic Chapel. Aside from being a former member of several organizations including Anton Szandor LaVey's Church of Satan, the Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis, Order of Nine Angles and The Satanic Temple, Sotelo would earn the title Ambassador of the of Satan by the founder Michael Shane Margolin and acts as a liaison to the Philippines and all Spanish-speaking countries, a title which he would occasionally use in interviews with print media and his tours. That same year Sotelo was picked up by an independent record label called A Dark Philosophy Records, which held Finnish metal band at one time, and soon released So Satan and followed up the album three years later with Morals & Dogma. Though ADP Records did not push the album, it gained infamy when radio stations KPCC-FM (89.3) of Pasadena, California was fined $23,700 by the FCC for playing Sotelo's rendition of MC5's Kick Out the Jams and a similar incident five years later when WEUS 810 AM (The Big 810 AM) of Orlando, Florida played Sotelo's version of \"We're All In The Same Gang\" for its 24th anniversary.\n\nIn 2011, he was featured on two songs off of Ghetto 187's debut album \"Return Of the G-Funk Era\" which featured appearances from Bloods & Crips, Mr. Chuko and O.Y.G Redrum 781 from the Damu Ridas. That year he also released his first book \"The Condensed Satanic Bible\", which explain the views of his satanist beliefs. During his career, Sotelo has collaborated with fellow Chicano rappers like X-Raided's Mr. Lil Man and mainstream artists such as WC, Rittz and Honey Cocaine.\n\nSotelo was the subject of numerous articles in news media throughout the world, including popular magazines such as The San Francisco Examiner, Music Connection, and Teen Ink, and men's magazines. Novelist Kenneth Grant described Sotelo as \"A Satanic Buddhist\", with comedian and radio personality Ed Tyll describing him as \"A business man...his charitable nature benefited such organizations as Music For Hope and United Colors, some of those donations lived through his anonymity, others took on a life of their own.\"\n\nHowever, his fame had been shortly sidetracked after multiple charges with the law, most notably in 2013 when sheriffs searched his home with possession of illegal firearms and marijuana. After being released from confinement, Sotelo worked hard to get his life back on track by continuing to create and write music about his experiences with crime and the law.\n\nIn 2014, he signed a distribution deal with Universal Music Group and soon released his debut album \"Me Against The World\" which featured collaborations with artists such as Bloods & Crips and Dresta. His single, \"I Wish You Would\" gained rotation on radio stations throughout the United States. Edward Tyll sponsored Sotelo's version of \"We're All In The Same Gang\" on WEUS 810 AM (The Big 810 AM) and the Star Com Radio Network.\n\nIn 2015 he released his sophomore album \"Magick Without Words\" which featured appearances from Davina and Av LMKR. The album's single \"Green Tea\" wasn't promoted and only charted at No. 87 on the indie charts. The album at this point had sold just under 2 million copies. That same year Sotelo composed \"Liber Cultris\", a gospel in which he expounds upon various religious texts of cultures past, including Jesus Christ, Buddha, and Lucifer. Sotelo authored it for his own satisfaction, supporting the Catholic faith as he saw it. Larry Wessel states, \"He did not produce his small book to shock or offend a drowsy world; he composed it for himself, for his devotion, for his assurance.\"\n\nIn 2016, he released his third studio album \"The Much Requested Letter\" with \"Playa\" as its lead single. This was his first mainstream album available for download from iTunes and had a few guest features like Bizzy Bone and Chris Rivers. That same year he released his book \"Satanic Combat Sciences\".\n\nIn 2017 he signed a deal with Sugo Music Group. That year he dropped his fourth studio album \"Gangster & The Priest\". Released Christmas Day through his own A Dark Philosophy Records (selling 400,000 copies in the US), along with the first single, \"The Arrival\", produced by DJ Hoppa and featuring guest vocals by B-Luv.\n\nSotelo wrote to Michael Margolin: “My reputation in East L.A. is built upon one minuscule volume of verses, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year. The only thing that matters is that these should be impeccable in their kind, so that each should be an event.” Typically, Sotelo first published his poems individually in periodicals or in small books or online, and then collected them and released his first collection entitled \"A Spirit of Progress and Other Poems\" in 2018.\n\nCurrently, \"Knife\" Sotelo also promotes and sponsors live Satanic events, shows and concerts. He also hosts a weekly radio show in Los Angeles.\n\nSotelo first began modeling in 2010, making his foray into the world of street fashion working in the street-wear and lowrider automotive scene as a print and spokesmodel for several companies, magazines and race events. His first mainstream magazine shoot was with \"Alwayz Therro Magazine\" in the US.\n\nSotelo took an interest in martial arts when he was in elementary school, he took a few lessons in Taekwondo and held the rank of Junior Kyū, Sotelo also had a brief stint in professional mixed martial arts with the International Fight League and was scheduled to fight against Ryan McGivern on April 29, 2006, at the IFL: Legends Championship in Atlantic City, New Jersey. However, Sotelo opted out of the fight and was replaced by Amir Rahnavardi since he did not appreciate the match getting changed from an MMA fight to an exhibition match with stipulations, and because he felt that an exhibition match where both fighters are declared winners was \"meaningless,\" disenfranchised with the IFL he left and began training in Arnis under master Jaime \"Jim\" Sotelo (\"Knife\" Sotelo's associate, no relation), the head instructor of the Sotelo Arnis Self-Defense Club which is affiliated with Lapunti Arnis de Abanico (LAPUNTI). He would later go on and attain his sixth-degree black belt in Arnis, orange belt in Krav Maga and he would also teach Jeet Kune Do to a small group of students. With his knowledge of many different styles and combat sports that include Boxing, Wrestling, MMA, Muay Thai, Chun Kuk Do, & Kata, Sotelo collected applications he deemed practical, modified them with his own philosophies and created his own blend of combat science. In June 2017 Sotelo took the position of Grade 2 Representative, holding control over the World International Martial Arts Association and Organization (WIMAAO) operations for Los Angeles, California.\n\nSotelo's work as a photographer, graphic artist, musician/composer and writer are heavily influenced by the mystical and magical traditions he has lived and edified. Stylistically, he gravitated at a blooming age to artists and mentors whose art was additionally imbued by a non-traditional vision, Sotelo was one of the eleven member-artists of the \"Unpop Art Movement\" created by Shaun Partridge, Brian M. Clark, and Boyd Rice in 2004. Rice who is also a musician, encouraged Sotelo to pursue his art. Unpop disbanded as an \"art movement\" in 2010. Sotelo now calls his art Celebritarian, an art movement started by his mentor Marilyn Manson. He states Celebritarianism would be, ironically, a satire of today's civilization; It would be about dying when everyone's watching; doing anything for fame. Sotelo revealed an art installation in 2016 entitled \"#RedSandProject\", a guerilla art exhibition showcased at the East L.A. Art Walk which the artist collaborated on with Molly Gochman. Sotelo has also become ardently involved in the Inside Out Project, a global participatory art project aimed at conveying a sense of hope and pride.\n\nSotelo launched \"Ginger & Mary\", his own brand of THC-rich infused ginger beer, which has received mixed reviews; some critics described the taste as being \"just plain ordinary\", other reviewers, such as critics at Food and Beverage Magazine, have given the beer moderately high praise.\n\n\nBaptized in his youth to the Roman Catholic Church. Sotelo is a self-identified fan of Anton LaVey and also an advocate of the writings of Michael S. Margolin and Aleister Crowley saying \"I also like Margolin and Crowley,\" and quoting Margolin throughout his books. Margolin's hermetic subject matter forms an important leitmotif in much of Sotelo's early work. Sotelo also has a close association with Diane LaVey's grandson Stanton LaVey and even helped out a couple of times throughout Stanton's career. Sotelo has been seen as one of \"the highest profile Satanist's ever\" with strong Anti-Catholic views and social cantheistic leanings. In many interviews he referenced his conversion to Sōtō Zen Buddhism in the Eihei Dogen Kigen Zenji lineages, as well as his status as Ambassador of the of Satan.\n\nIn 2005, Sotelo became a member of the Church of Satan, and resigned only 2 months later over his dissatisfaction with the direction in which Peter H. Gilmore was taking the Church – and according to his own claim – he joined the of Satan the very next day. During this period, Sotelo made friends with a number of known Satanists like Zeena LaVey's son Stanton Zaharoff LaVey, Szandora LaVey, Larry Wessel, Boyd Rice and Marilyn Manson.\n\nWith inspiration from his religious instructor Michael S. Margolin, Sotelo thought the Ordo Templi Orientis, the order Aleister Crowley entrusted his legacy to, seemed a likely choice. However this was not the case, he had noticed that degrees would be given in exchange for financial or other contributions to the Order, Sotelo was disillusioned and instead joined the Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis seeing a common middle-ground since due to the situation prevalent at the time, however, and Karl Germer not being - on his own admission - the O.H.O., the supposed expulsion of Kenneth Grant must be considered invalid. More to the point, though, it is surely irrelevant to Sotelo. He would stay with the Typhonian Order until 2011 after Grant's death and ultimately ending with the organization shifting from a formal hierarchy to a less hierarchical structure.\n\nSotelo began to pursue other Satanic religious practices and became an associate of the Order of Nine Angles and remained a member of it until 2013. Sotelo, using Dr. Monette's words, described the ONA as \"a fascinating blend of both Hermeticism and Traditional Satanism, with some pagan elements\". Sotelo stated that he can relate to the terms Drecc and Niner which in ONA terminology refer to folk-based or gang-based culture or individuals who support the Order's aims by practical (including criminal) means rather than esoteric ones. White Star Acception being one of those groups accused to have perpetrated rapes, assaults, and robberies in order to advance the group's power. Dr. Monette noted that the reality of these actions has not been verified. He has since resigned from the organization.\n\nHe would also become a member of The Satanic Temple in 2014 only to become disenfranchised. He had nevertheless developed concerns about The Satanic Temple, feeling that it had attracted many \"hipster-adherents, ego-militant maniacs and assorted oddballs whose primary intrigues to becoming Satanists was to flash their membership cards.\" He resigned from the organization on September 29, 2016.\n\nSotelo was in conflict with Serio (CEO of Serio Controla Records), Lil Rob, and Mr. Criminal. Mr. Criminal would malign Sotelo on, \"It's Murder\". The song was from the album \"Only the Strong Survive\". One of the reasons why Sotelo had problems with Serio was because Sotelo's producer B-Rae claimed that Serio was not from Washington. Sotelo claimed that he was from Los Angeles. Sotelo felt that Serio was lying to everyone about being raised in Yakima, Washington. In 2010, Sotelo would speak ill towards Serio, on the song \"Who Do I Catch Slip\" featuring B-Rae.\n\n\n\nSotelo is an animal rights supporter. One of Sotelo's campaigns as a member of the International Society for Animal Rights has been against the cruelty to animals. In April 2012, Sotelo was asked to speak at the Blessing of the Animals, hosted by the Olvera Street Merchants Association, a tradition held since the 1930s, stating that even Satanists seems to smile a little at the idea of the tradition. \"As Satanists we respect and exalt life,\" Sotelo said. \"Animals are the purest expressions of that life force, and as such are held sacred and precious.\"\n\nSotelo had repeatedly supported the legalization of cannabis and in May 2014 announced that he would be a sponsor to Americans for Safe Access, a Washington, D.C.-based organization working to ensure safe and legal access to cannabis for therapeutic uses and research.\n\nSotelo has been highly vocal in the right to bear arms and opposition to gun control measures that have emerged since his congressional campaign such as California Proposition 63, the bullet button and refined definition of a \"fixed magazine\", and numerous other gun control measures on the local, state, and federal level, but while performing he instructs venues to not allow firearms.\n\nIn 2015 he made headlines when he announced that he would officially be running for a seat on the U.S. House of Representatives for the Grassroots Party in the state of California. Being a perennial candidate he ultimately lost the race and on September 21, 2016, he formally ended his congressional campaign, but said he intends to run again.\n\nIn August 2017, Sotelo announced that he would seek election to the United States Senate in the 2018 election. \n\nIn October 2017, Sotelo stated his support for alt-lite activists and conspiracy theorists Gavin McInnes and Milo Yiannopoulos after McInnes and Yiannopoulos were criticized in an Anti-Defamation League (ADL) report. Sotelo accused the ADL of being a \"witchhunt group\" and posted \"that the ADL are no more better than the groups they demonize, the same group who claimed the Jewish Defense League consists of nothing but thugs and hooligans.\"\n\nSotelo dropped out of the race on July 8, 2018, citing the need to endorse someone more qualified and stated his support for California State Senator Kevin de Leon’s primary bid against the incumbent Dianne Feinstein.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Ernst Pfeiffer of The Hague Society, a branch of the General Church located in the Netherlands.\n\nHeadquartered in Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania, U.S., the Church maintains an international congregation, with ministries or societies in Africa, Europe, and the United States, and has a total membership of approximately 1,000.\n\nThe Church was founded in 1937, under the principal leadership of Rev. Theodore Pitcairn (son of PPG Industries founder John Pitcairn) and the Rev. Ernst Pfeiffer of The Hague Society in the Netherlands, by former members of the General Church of the New Jerusalem who had left as a result of a doctrinal dispute.\n\nThe dispute in question centered on theological ideas proposed by a Dutch layman, H. D. G. Groeneveld, in \"De Hemelsche Leer\" (The Celestial Doctrine), a Dutch periodical started by Pfeiffer in 1929. Emanuel Swedenborg, whose writings compose the distinctive body of material used by the General Church, had proposed the idea that the Bible had, in addition to its intended material meaning, a spiritual meaning that had been revealed through the communications between Swedenborg and the angelic realm. The General Church placed paramount authority on the writings of Swedenborg, but Groeneveld went beyond this; he proposed that Swedenborg's theological writings themselves were nothing less than a Third Testament, and thus, according to Swedenborg's ideas, must also have an inner, spiritual meaning.\n\nIn the United States, Pitcairn emerged as an early proponent of Groeneveld's perspective. In 1927, he wrote a short book entitled \"The Book Sealed with Seven Seals\" to introduce the idea to the American church.\nIn the 1930s, first the leadership of the General Church, and later, its Council of the Clergy, rejected the leading theses propounded in \"De Hemelsche Leer\". Rev. Pfeiffer, whose Hague Society supported the periodical, was thus ordered to stop publication. When he refused, he was forced, in 1937, to leave the General Church by its leading Bishop, the Rev. George de Charms. This led other leading adherents of the theses, including Pitcairn, to resign that year as well. That same year, Pitcairn, Pfeiffer, and others proceeded to establish the \"Lord's New Church Which Is Nova Hierosolyma\", centered in Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania, and The Hague, The Netherlands. Hierosolyma is a Hellenized pronunciation of a Hebrew word for Jerusalem.\n\nIn 1939, Rev. Pitcairn established a non-profit corporation for the purposes of promoting and maintaining the new church.\n\nThe events of the Second World War delayed formalization of the new Church's organization. Finally, in March 1947, the Church's international governmental structure was drawn up by a provisional international council composed of the laymen Groeneveld and Anton Zelling, and the Revs. Pfeiffer, Pitcairn, and Philip N. Odhner, and approved by Church members in America and Holland later that year.\n\nThe Church is a branch of what is commonly called the \"New Church\" or the \"Swedenborgian Church\", and is a post-Reformation form of Christianity that bases its teachings on the Old Testament (written in Hebrew), the New Testament (written in Greek), and the theological writings of Emanuel Swedenborg (written in Latin), the last of which is referred to as the \"Latin Word\". The Lord's New Church differs from the General Church, as its parent denomination is commonly called, and from other Swedenborgian branches, in that the former's members view Swedenborg's theological writings as a Third Testament.\n\nThe Church propounds three essential theological principles:\n\nThe Church also identifies three 'Principles of Doctrine':\n\nThe Church is essentially organized as an episcopal polity, a form of church governance which is hierarchical in structure, and in which the chief authority over a local Christian church rests with a bishop. The external governmental structure of the Church is based upon a portion of Swedenborg's writings that describes a 'circle of life' composed of a 'descending line' and an 'ascending line'; the priesthood corresponds to the former and the laity to the latter.\nHeadquartered in Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania, U.S., the Church has ministries or societies in Africa, Europe, and the United States. It has a worldwide membership of approximately 1000, with the majority of these residing in southern Africa.\n\nThe headquarters of the church, with its main church building, are located adjacent to the Pennypack preserve, west of the Pennypack Creek and the creek road trail.\n\nThe Church is supported by a non-profit corporation of the same name.\n\n"}

After graduating from Chuo University in Tokyo in 1968, he moved back to Okinawa and ran a \"juku\", a private school. Matayoshi was trained as a Protestant preacher, and through his religious studies developed a particular concept of Christianity strongly influenced by eschatology. In 1997, he established the World Economic Community Party (世界経済共同体党), a political party based on his conviction that he was God. His concept was both religious and political, a mix of Christian eschatology like Augustine's \"De civitate Dei\" (\"City of God\") and conservative collectivism. He died from illness on July 20, 2018.\n\nAccording to his programme he would have executed the Last Judgment as Christ, but within the current political system. His first step was to have been appointed the Prime Minister of Japan. Then he would have reformed Japanese society and be offered the post of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Matayoshi would then have reigned over the whole world with two legitimate authorities, not only religious but also political. The world economic system would have been altered to encourage every nation to be self-sufficient, based on agriculture. He condemned permanent residency and the naturalisation of foreigners because he viewed the abandonment of one's motherland to be wrong. He wanted ethnically non-Japanese people to go back to their ancestral homeland even if they were born in Japan. He wanted the USA to withdraw its army from all overseas positions, including Okinawa. After his Judgment he would have thrown the corrupt into the Fire (see Book of Revelation).\n\nMatayoshi presented himself as a candidate in many elections from 1997 through to 2013, despite winning none of them. He became well-known for his eccentric campaigns in which he urged opponents to commit suicide by hara-kiri (disembowelment; note that he avoided the more polite \"seppuku\") and said that he will cast them into Gehenna. Like most Japanese politicians, he campaigned in a single small regulation size mini-van fitted with oversized loudspeakers. Unlike most, however, he blasted his campaign slogans in a stylised, kabuki-inspired voice.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4634107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4634107", "title": "National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools", "text": "National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools\n\nThe National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools (NCBCPS) is a conservative nonprofit organization that promotes the use of its 300-page Bible curriculum, \"The Bible in History and Literature\", in schools throughout the United States.\n\nThe NCBCPS was founded in 1993, and as of 2000 its curriculum has been in use in at least 70 public school districts across the United States.\n\nIt has been criticized by separationists as presenting a religious interpretation of the Bible as well as an unbalanced view of American history which promotes specific religious beliefs. The use of the curriculum has been challenged in lawsuits in two school districts, which have withdrawn the course as contravening the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\n\nNCBCPS was founded on April 8, 1993, by Elizabeth Ridenhour, a Greensboro, NC, paralegal. The organization's annual 990 tax forms, available on Guidestar.org, list Ridenhour as an ordained minister.\n\nAccording to the organization's Web site, \"312 U.S. school districts in 37 states have educated 175,000 of their students using the Bible curriculum as a public high school elective.\"\n\nA 2006 report, \"Reading, Writing and Religion: Teaching the Bible in Texas Public Schools,\" by Bible scholar Dr. Mark Chancey of Southern Methodist University found that in Texas, \"the number of Texas school districts using the NCBCPS curriculum, 11, is less than a fourth of the 52 claimed by the NCBCPS itself. Adding the very few school districts known to have used the course in the past... does not significantly change the total number. The NCBCPS markets its course by strongly emphasizing the large number of school districts that supposedly teach it; as of late July 2006, its Web site claimed that its curriculum is currently offered in 362 districts nationwide. Such oft-repeated claims now appear to be quite inaccurate. If the situation in Texas is representative, the curriculum is probably actually taught in only a few dozen districts.\"\n\nThe NCBCPS web site states that the organization's curriculum \"has never been legally challenged\", and features an opinion from four lawyers claiming the course to be constitutional. Whilst the NCBCPS itself has not been sued, two school boards have been for adopting the NCBCPS materials in their district:\n\nA federal lawsuit on behalf of eight parents in Odessa, Texas, was filed on May 16, 2007 against the Ector County school board. The suit was brought by the ACLU of Texas, the People For the American Way Foundation and the law firm of Jenner & Block. The suit alleged that the course promotes certain religious beliefs to the exclusion of others.\nThe Ector County School Board was represented by Liberty Legal Foundation. In a May 17, 2007 article in the \"Odessa American\", ECISD trustee L.V. \"Butch\" Foreman III said he did not understand how the parents could sue the school board since they do not have children taking the course. \"If they don't have children in the class, they can kiss my butt,\" Foreman said.\n\nOn March 5, 2008, the lawsuit was settled with an agreement by the Ector County School Board to cease teaching NCBCPS materials in its public schools after that current school year. The course offered was taught as an elective in two high schools and was described as unconstitutionally promoting a particular interpretation of the Bible that is not shared by Jews, Catholics, Orthodox Christians, and most Protestants. Bible scholars had seriously criticized the course as lacking accuracy, ignoring scholarly research, promoting a particular religious interpretation of the Bible, and presenting an unbalanced view of American history which promoted specific religious beliefs.\n\nAccording to the settlement, any Bible course Ector County schools offer in the future cannot be based on the NCBCPS curriculum, and must follow strict legal standards for objectivity and balance. One of the plaintiffs, an ordained elder and deacon at a local Presbyterian Church, said that it was inappropriate for one set of religious beliefs to be promoted over others, and that \"It seems as though a church had invaded the public school system – and it wasn’t my church\". The ACLU’s Director of Litigation said in a press release that “We trust that any future curriculum will be appropriate for students of all faiths – including nonbelievers – and that it will respect the religious liberty of all Odessans.” \n\nThe Lee County School Board (Florida) was sued while using the NCBCPS curriculum, for \"unconstitutionally advancing religion in public school classrooms.\" According to the website of People for the American Way Foundation, which represented the plaintiffs in the suit (\"Gibson v. Lee County School Board\"), \"In January 1998, the court issued a preliminary injunction that prohibited the teaching of the 'New Testament' curriculum and allowed the 'Old Testament' curriculum to be taught only under strict monitoring. The court also ordered the two sides to begin settlement negotiations.\n\n\"After the court's ruling, the Board agreed to settle the case by withdrawing the 'Old Testament' and 'New Testament' curricula it had adopted and replacing them with a new, objective and non-sectarian course based on a textbook called \"\"An Introduction to the Bible\".\"\n\nIn the Winter 2007 issue of the \"Baylor Law Review\", Amanda Colleen Brown reviewed the NCBCPS' \"The Bible in History and Literature\" and the Bible Literacy Project's \"The Bible and Its Influence\" (59 Baylor L. Rev. 193). The author subjects both curricula to three legal tests used by the Supreme Court to determine the legality of Bible courses, and concludes that the NCBCPS curriculum is \"unfit for use in public school classrooms,\" while the Bible Literacy Project's curriculum \"comports with constitutional standards, thus making it a viable alternative to the NCBCPS curriculum.\"\nBrown argues that a key problem with the NCBCPS curriculum is that it consists of only a teacher's guide, with no student textbook. Brown writes:\nIn 1999, the Attorney General of Georgia, Thurbert Baker, issued an opinion stating that the state's proposed adoption of the NCBCPS courses could not be assured that they would survive a legal challenge.\n\nOn August 1, 2005, Dr. Mark Chancey, professor of Biblical studies at Southern Methodist University, released a report through the Texas Freedom Network detailing his concerns about the scholarly quality of the curriculum. Chancey stated that the curriculum was improperly sectarian, and contained \"shoddy research, factual errors and plagiarism.\" In particular, Chancey wrote that the curriculum \"uses a discredited urban legend that NASA has evidence that two days are missing in time, thus 'confirming' a biblical passage about the sun standing still [pp. 116–17];\" and that more than one-third of the curriculum's 300 pages are reproduced word-for-word from uncredited sources such as Microsoft's \"Encarta\" encyclopedia. Hundreds of Biblical scholars at universities around the United States have signed on as endorsers of Chancey's findings.\n\nThe NCBCPS responded with an August 4 press release asking the public to \"consider the source.\" The release described the Texas Freedom Network as \"a small group of far left, anti-religion extremists ... desperate to ban one book – the Bible – from public schools.\n\nIn a subsequent article, Dr. Chancey wrote:\nRobert Marus of the Associated Baptist Press Washington Bureau wrote that the revision of the curriculum \"incorporat[ed] many of the changes recommended by an organization [the NCBCPS] characterized as 'anti-religion extremists.'\" \n\nThe syllabus of the National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools has endorsed by D. James Kennedy, Bill Bright, Joyce Meyer, Jerry Falwell, John Hagee, T.D. Jakes, Dale Evans Rogers, Jane Russell, Pat Boone, Carman Licciardello, and Scott O'Grady.\n\nThe \"Chicago Tribune\" Editorial Board, in an editorial published July 7, 2007, stated that \"The folks at the National Council are right on one count: The Bible should be taught in public schools. But they shouldn't be the ones to do it.\" The editorial criticised the NCBCPS for not releasing the names of the authors of the curriculum and for \"sloppy editing, factual errors and outright copying, word for word, from sources.\" The Editorial Board noted that \"The National Council is not the only option school districts have. A competing curriculum (The Bible and Its Influence) offered by the Bible Literacy Project, a non-profit group, has been vetted, accepted and praised by a wide range of scholars, critics and education officials.\"\n\n\"TIME\" Magazine, in the cover story of its April 2, 2007 issue, wrote that the curriculum is not \"legally palatable ... Its spokespeople claim it is refining itself as it goes and its most recent edition, which came out last month, eliminates much literalist bias—but still devotes 18 lines to the blatantly unscientific notion that the earth is only 6,000 years old.\" By contrast, \"TIME\" stated that \"[Public school Bible electives] should have a strong accompanying textbook on the model of (the Bible Literacy Project's) The Bible and Its Influence.\"\n\n"}

In 2003 the words \"International Kadampa Buddhist Union\" (IKBU) were added to the original name \"New Kadampa Tradition\". The NKT-IKBU is an international organisation registered in England as a charitable, or non-profit, company. It currently lists more than 200 centres and around 900 branch classes/study groups in forty countries.\n\nThe NKT-IKBU describes itself as ‘an entirely independent Buddhist tradition’ inspired and guided by ‘the ancient Kadampa Buddhist Masters and their teachings, as presented by Kelsang Gyatso’. Its founder, Kelsang Gyatso, has sought to make Buddhist meditation and teaching more readily accessible to twenty-first century living. He also wanted to ensure that people did not simply study Tibetan Buddhism from an academic point of view, but learned how to extend this knowledge through meditation and practical Buddhist experience. The NKT-IKBU is described as being \"very successful at disseminating its teachings\" and Geshe Kelsang's books have been called \"very popular\".\n\nThe NKT-IKBU has expanded more rapidly than any other Buddhist tradition in Britain. It has been described as a \"controversial organization\" and a \"controversial\" new religious movement, a cult, or a breakaway Buddhist sect.\n\nIn 1976 the students of Thubten Yeshe founded the Manjushri Institute with Lama Yeshe as the Spiritual Director and purchased the assets of Conishead Priory, a neglected Victorian mansion in Ulverston (Cumbria), England for £70,000. The same year Thubten Yeshe and Thubten Zopa Rinpoche visited Kelsang Gyatso in India and invited him over to teach at the Manjushri Institute, which was a part of their FPMT network.\n\nAccording to David N. Kay, Kelsang Gyatso was invited in 1976 by Thubten Yeshe and Thubten Zopa, who sought the advice of the 14th Dalai Lama when choosing Kelsang Gyatso. Whereas according to a NKT brochure, \"Lama Yeshe requested Trijang Rinpoche to ask Kelsang Gyatso to become Resident Teacher of Manjushri Institute. Kelsang Gyatso later recounted that Kyabje Trijang Rinpoche asked him to go to England, teach Shantideva's \"Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life\", Chandrakirti's \"Guide to the Middle Way\" and Lamrim, and then check whether there was any meaning in his continuing to stay.\"\n\nKelsang Gyatso was requested by Lama Yeshe to lead the \"General Program\" of Buddhist study. In 1979 Lama Yeshe asked a Geshe at Manjushri Institute, Geshe Jampa Tekchok, to teach a parallel twelve-year Geshe Studies Programme, recognised and validated by the Dalai Lama and modelled on the program of studies for the traditional geshe degree. From 1982 to 1990 this program was led by Geshe Konchog Tsewang. According to a disciple of Lama Yeshe from this time, Lama Yeshe intended the institute \"to become the central monastery of the FPMT... one of the early jewels of the FPMT crown\" and \"the pioneer among the western centres\".\n\nIn the late 1970s, Kelsang Gyatso, without consulting Thubten Yeshe, opened up a Buddhist Centre in York under his own spiritual direction. Kay sees this as the beginning of a conflict between Thubten Yeshe and Kelsang Gyatso. However, according to Kelsang Gyatso, \"the opening of the Centre in York caused not one moment of confusion or disharmony\". Kelsang Gyatso was asked to resign so that another Geshe, described by Kay as \"more devoted to FPMT objectives\", could take over as a resident teacher of Manjushri Institute. Many students of Kelsang Gyatso petitioned him to stay and teach them, and on this basis he decided to remain. In the following years prior 1990 Kelsang Gyatso established 15 centres under his own direction in Great Britain and Spain.\n\nBoth Kay and Cozort describe the management committee of Manjushri Institute from 1981 onwards as made up principally of Kelsang Gyatso's closest students, also known as \"the Priory group\". According to Kay, \"The Priory Group became dissatisfied with the FPMT's increasingly centralized organisation.\" Cozort states that different disagreements \"led to a rift between Lama Yeshe and his students and Geshe Kelsang Gyatso and his, and eventually the Manjushri Board of directors ( Geshe Gyatso's students) severed the connection of the between institute and FPMT.\" According to Kay, Lama Yeshe tried at different times to reassert his authority over the Institute, but his attempts were unsuccessful. Kay goes on to describe an open conflict of authority which developed between the Priory Group and the FPMT administration in 1983. In February 1984 the conflict was mediated by the Office of the Dalai Lama in London. Kay states that after the death of Thubten Yeshe in March 1984, the FPMT lost interest because they saw it as a fruitless case. Since that time, Kay states, the Manjushri Institute has developed mainly under the guidance of Kelsang Gyatso without further reference to the FPMT, but legally remained part of the FPMT until late 1990.\n\nAccording to Kay, of the two Geshes at Manjushri Institute, it was Kelsang Gyatso who had always taken the greater interest in the running and direction of the Institute, and most of the students there were closer to him. The courses offered by both Geshes complemented each other, but as Kay remarked, they \"differed in one important respect: only Geshe Kelsang's General Programme included courses on Tantric Buddhism, and attendance upon these required the reception of a Tantric empowerment.\" Further, Kay argues that \"Lama Yeshe's and Geshe Kelsang's different ideological perspectives provided the conditions for the organisational dispute between the Institute and the FPMT to escalate. Kelsang Gyatso was already predisposed to support his students in their struggle with the FPMT administration because the organisation was inspired by a vision that he did not totally agree with.\"\n\nKay writes that, \"the determination of Geshe Kelsang and the Priory Group to separate from the parent organisation was uncompromising, and this was a position that only hardened during the following years.\" He goes on to describe the split from the Gelug school and FPMT as follows:\n\nKelsang Gyatso made a three-year retreat from 1987 to 1990 in Dumfries, Scotland and asked Geshe Losang Pende from Ganden Shartse monastery to lead the General Program in his absence, whilst Geshe Konchog Tsewang continued to teach the Geshe Studies Programme at Conishead Priory (Manjushri Institute). Different Lamas, including Thubten Zopa, were still invited. Especially the visit of Thubten Zopa in 1988 \"is significant, indicating the ongoing devotion of the students to this lama and their desire to leave the negativity of the schism with the FPMT in the past.\" In 1988 and 1990 the uncle of Kelsang Gyatso, Choyang Duldzin Kuten Lama – the oracle of Dorje Shugden – also visited Manjushri Institute. Before that time Song Rinpoche, Geshe Lhundup Sopa, Geshe Rabten, as well as other Buddhist teachers such as Ajahn Sumedho and Thích Nhất Hạnh have taught at Manjushri Institute.\n\nDuring Kelsang Gyatso's period of retreat he wrote some of his books and worked out the foundations of the NKT. Kay states: \"The first major development that took place during Geshe Kelsang's retreat was the introduction of the 'Teacher Training Programme' (TTP) at the Manjushri Institute.\" Kay comments the developments at that time: \"By giving his study programmes a textual basis, Geshe Kelsang not only provided accessible materials to enhance the focus and commitment of his students, but also laid down structures through which spiritual authority could later be concentrated exclusively on him.\"\nAccording to Kay, \n\nAccording to Kay, Kelsang Gyatso was gravely concerned that the purity of Tsongkhapa's tradition was being undermined by the lingering inclusivism of his Western students, something he had been outspoken for some years, \"but he now acted more forcefully in his opposition to it by discouraging his students both from receiving guidance from teachers of other traditions and from reading their books.\" Kay states that another result of these \"radically exclusive policies\" was that after the foundation of the NKT the Manjushri Institute Library, with over 3000 books, was removed. Kay goes on to state that, \"this began with non-Gelug books being removed, but as Geshe Kelsang's vision crystallised, even books by Gelug teachers became unacceptable to him and the library disappeared altogether. He thus became convinced that the Tibetan Gelug tradition as a whole no longer embodied Tsongkhapa's pure teachings and that he and his disciples must therefore separate from it. From this point onwards, Tibetan Gelug lamas would no longer be invited to teach within his network. This perceived degeneration extended to include its highest-level lamas, and so even veneration for the Dalai Lama was now actively discouraged.\" The pictures of the Dalai Lama were removed from the gompas and shrines of Kelsang Gyatso's centres. In 1990 Kelsang Gyatso became also outspoken against the Geshe Studies Programme, and \"made the pursuit of his new programmes compulsory.\" According to Kay \"As it was no longer possible for students to follow the programmes of both Geshes, the basis of Geshe Konchog's teaching programme at the Institute was undermined, and in 1991 he retired to Gyuto Monastery in Assam, India.\"\n\nAccording to David Kay, \"in 1991, through the successful exploitation of a legal loophole, the assets of Manjushri Institute finally fell under the sole control of the Priory Group\" (the close disciples of Kelsang Gyatso). In the Spring of that same year, Kelsang Gyatso announced the creation of the 'New Kadampa Tradition', an event which was celebrated in the NKT-Magazine \"Full Moon\" as \"a wonderful development in the history of the Buddhadharma.\" In 1992, the Manjushri Institute developed a new constitution, which constituted the formal foundation of the NKT. The Manjushri Institute was renamed the Manjushri Mahayana Buddhist Centre, and later the Manjushri Kadampa Meditation Centre. Since then, it has remained Kelsang Gyatso's home and the NKT's flagship centre.\n\nWith the foundation of the New Kadampa Tradition (NKT) by Kelsang Gyatso, he established a new and independent religious movement aiming to \"principally follow the teachings and example of Je Tsongkhapa\". This also gave a new identity to his followers. The many NKT centres which were built up rapidly by his followers could gather under the common auspices of the NKT and their spiritual guide, distinguishing and disassociating themselves from other Tibetan Buddhist traditions, especially the Gelug school from which Kelsang Gyatso originated. Kay argued that with these changes, Kelsang Gyatso provided a basis for the NKT to become a Western tradition whose \"spiritual authority could later be concentrated exclusively on him.\" Cozort describes this as unusual in the Tibetan tradition. The NKT described themselves as being \"an entirely independent Buddhist tradition with no political affiliations... that is appropriate to the needs and conditions of the modern world\".\n\nDavid N. Kay comments:\n\nIn 1998 Kelsang Gyatso stated in an interview:\n\nAccording to an NKT brochure, written by James Belither while secretary of the NKT:\n\nNowadays the New Kadampa Tradition describes Kelsang Gyatso's presentation of Buddhism to the West as Kadampa Buddhism with the following statement:\n\nMoreover, the NKT presents itself as being the continuation of the ancient Kadampa tradition by naming its school \"Kadampa Buddhism\" and equating this \"Kadampa Buddhism\" with the historical Kadampa School of Atisha:\n\nFollowers of the NKT refer to themselves as Kadampa Buddhists, the temples of the New Kadampa Tradition are referred to as Kadampa Buddhist Temples, and more recently, NKT teachers are named Kadampa teachers. Additionally, the Dharma centres of the New Kadampa Tradition are called Kadampa Buddhist Centres.\n\nJames Belither, the former secretary of the NKT, described the NKT as \"a Mahayana Buddhist tradition with historical connections with Tibet\", rather than a Tibetan tradition, and explained that Kelsang Gyatso wishes his followers always \"to present Dharma in a way appropriate to their own culture and society without the need to adopt Tibetan culture and customs\".\n\nWhereas the NKT celebrate Kelsang Gyatso as the one who \"is primarily responsible for the worldwide revival of Kadampa Buddhism in our time\", \"critics have described The New Kadampa Tradition as a breakaway sect or cult and argue it is not part of the ancient Kadampa Tradition but a split from the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism.\" Tibetologist Thierry Dodin has described the NKT as a cult, \"... on the basis of its organisational form, its excessive group pressure and blind obedience to its founder. The organisation's extreme fanaticism and aggressive missionary drive are typical cult features too.\"\n\nBluck remarks that there remains an apparent contradiction between claiming a pure Tibetan lineage and separating completely from contemporary Tibetan tradition. While the NKT strongly emphasises its unbroken 'lineage', it has no Tibetan followers and claims to stand outside current Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nBluck lists the specific traditional teachings that are seen as important in the NKT-IKBU: \"the nature of the mind, karma and reincarnation, the preciousness of human life, the role of meditation, death, and the commitments of going for refuge\", as well as \"understanding the Four Noble Truths, developing renunciation, and the training of moral discipline, concentration and wisdom\", followed by \"becoming a compassionate bodhisattva (by developing bodhicitta and the six perfections), understanding the ultimate truth of emptiness and finally attaining Buddhahood.\"\n\nThe NKT-IKBU's teachings are based exclusively on the teachings and published works of Kelsang Gyatso, which in turn are commentaries on Gelug works, especially those of its founder Je Tsongkhapa's texts. According to Helen Waterhouse, Kelsang Gyatso follows the Tibetan Buddhist custom of studying texts through the teacher's commentaries. With respect to the contents of the teachings she states that \"NKT doctrine is not different from that of mainline Gelugpa\", with a Prasangika Madhyamaka philosophical orientation, and emphasising the teachings on dependent arising and emptiness. The main practice in the NKT-IKBU is Lamrim (the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment), Lojong (Training the Mind), and Vajrayana Mahamudra (the practices of Highest Yoga Tantra). The books studied in the NKT are published by the Buddhist publishing house Tharpa Publications.\n\nNKT-IKBU offers three study programs: \"the open and introductory General Programme, the Foundation Programme for more committed practitioners, and the demanding Teacher Training Programme.\" The study programs of the NKT-IKBU are what distinguishes it from all other Buddhist traditions. Giving an overview of the purpose of the programs, the NKT-IKBU says: \"Venerable Geshe Kelsang Gyatso has designed three special Study Programs for the systematic study and practice of Kadampa Buddhism that are especially suited to the modern world.\" It is believed by NKT-IKBU followers that the teachings transmit the pure lineage of Je Tsongkhapa in its entirety.\n\nThe three spiritual programs are:\n\nNKT-IKBU meditation practices include traditional Lamrim subjects such as \"precious human life, death and rebirth, karma and samsara, taking refuge, the development of equanimity, kindness and compassion towards all beings, bodhicitta, understanding emptiness, and relying on a spiritual guide.\"\n\nChanted prayers follow \"a traditional Tibetan format\":\n\n\nWhile the Je Tsongkhapa and Dorje Shugden practices are recited daily, NKT-IKBU practitioners also regularly perform a number of other ritual practices, including Avalokiteshvara, Heruka, Vajrayogini, Tara, Manjushri, Amitayus and the Medicine Buddha. Bluck notes that \"All these sādhanas have either been 'compiled from traditional sources' by Geshe Kelsang or translated under his supervision.\"\n\nFrom its inception, NKT-IKBU Dharma centres followed a common calendar for religious observances, including some of the traditional Buddhist religious days. These include the following:\n\nMonthly observances of Buddha Tara, Je Tsongkhapa, Eight Mahayana Precepts, and Dorje Shugden practices:\n\nAnnual holidays common to other Buddhist traditions: \n\nAnnual holidays unique to the NKT-IKBU:\n\nIn 2004, the dates of lunar month observances were changed to the respective days in the common calendar.\n\nNKT Day commemorates the founding of the NKT-IKBU, while International Temples Day is an opportunity to reflect on the importance of building Kadampa Buddhist Temples throughout the world.\n\nThree annual Buddhist NKT Festivals are held each year: (1) The Spring Festival – held at Manjushri KMC in UK; (2) The Summer Festival – held at Manjushri KMC in UK; (3) The Fall Festival – held at various locations outside the UK. These are taught by the General Spiritual Director of the New Kadampa Tradition, currently Gen-la Kelsang Dekyong, and include teachings and empowerments from the Spiritual Director, reviews and meditations led by senior NKT Teachers, chanted meditations and offering ceremonies, and meditation retreats. They are attended by between 2000 and 6000 people from around the world.\n\nWithin the NKT-IKBU community there are over 700 monks and nuns. Ordination ceremonies are usually held twice a year in the main NKT Temple at Manjushri Kadampa Meditation Center in Cumbria (UK), Ulverston. To ordain, one must ask Kelsang Gyatso's permission, and also the permission of his or her parents.\n\nBuddha established both lay and ordained Pratimoksha vows, and established several levels of ordination vows. Traditionally, the different levels of ordination are distinguished by the specific number of vows taken, and by the ceremony in which they were received. In the NKT-IKBU, Kelsang Gyatso established a simplified tradition of ordination with ten vows that summarise the entire Vinaya, and a single ordination ceremony.\n\nThe 10 vows in New Kadampa Tradition ordination are identical for both nuns and monks:\n\n\nIn \"The Ordination Handbook\", Kelsang Gyatso describes these vows as being easier to integrate into today's society, saying:\n\nHe also says:\n\nThe ordination tradition of the NKT-IKBU differs from that of other Buddhist groups in that it is based on the Mahayana \"Perfection of Wisdom Sutras\" instead of the Hinayana \"Vinaya Sutras\". According to Kelsang Gyatso, \"The Perfection of Wisdom Sutras are our Vinaya and Lamrim is its commentary.\" Robert Bluck observed that in the NKT-IKBU a \"Vinaya Sutras\"-based \"full ordination is not available, and those who do ordain remain as novices, though again this is common in Tibet.\" Kelsang Gyatso explains that when a person is first ordained they receive a Rabjung (preliminary) ordination; when their renunciation improves and deepens, their ordination naturally transforms into a Getsul (sramanera) ordination; and when their renunciation becomes \"a spontaneous wish to attain nirvana\", their ordination naturally transforms into a Gelong (bhikkhu) ordination. For this reason, Kelsang Gyatso does not require a separate ritual ordination ceremony.\n\nMonks and nuns in the NKT-IKBU abandon the physical signs of a lay person by shaving their head and wearing the maroon and yellow robes of an ordained person. They are given a new name which starts with \"Kelsang\", since it is traditional for ordinees to receive part of the ordaining master's name (in this case, Kelsang Gyatso). They also engage in a Sojong ceremony twice a month to purify and restore their vows.\n\nMonastics who break their ordination vows must leave their Centre for a year, with the exception of attending various bigger courses, Celebrations and Festivals. After that year, \"with some conditions\" they can return but cannot teach or participate in the Teacher Training Program.\n\nPractitioners who wish to ordain approach their Buddhist teacher when they feel ready, and request formal permission once they have their teacher's consent. They may decide to live in one of the NKT-IKBU's many Buddhist centres, but this is not a requirement. They are, in general, not financially provided for by the NKT-IKBU. And, if they live in an NKT-IKBU Dharma centre, they still have to pay rent for their accommodation and pay for meals and the spiritual programs. To finance this, some have part-time or full-time work. According to Belither, \"a few people are sponsored because of their NKT work but others are on 'extended working visits' or work locally, and some are legitimately on employment benefit.\" When working, they may \"wear ordinary clothes if this is more convenient.\"\n\nThe NKT-IKBU traces its spiritual lineage through these main Buddhist figures:\n\n\nAfter leaving Tibet in 1959, Kelsang Gyatso taught and engaged in retreat in India for 18 years. Trijang Rinpoche, the root Guru of Kelsang Gyatso, asked him to be the resident teacher at Manjushri Institute (now known as Manjushri Kadampa Meditation Centre) in England. Kelsang Gyatso taught the General Program at Manjushri from 1976 to 1987.\n\nIn 1987, Kelsang Gyatso entered a 3-year retreat at Tharpaland in Dumfries, Scotland. During his retreat, he wrote five books and established the foundations of the NKT-IKBU. Since that time, the NKT-IKBU has grown to comprise over 1,100 Centres and groups throughout 40 countries.\n\nAfter completing his retreat in the spring of 1991, Kelsang Gyatso announced the creation of the NKT-IKBU, an event which was celebrated by his students in the NKT-IKBU magazine \"Full Moon\" as \"a wonderful development in the history of the Buddhadharma.\"\n\nIn 1992, the NKT-IKBU was legally incorporated under English law, which constituted the formal foundation of the NKT-IKBU. The many Dharma Centres that were following Kelsang Gyatso's spiritual direction were gathered under the common auspices of the NKT-IKBU, with him as their General Spiritual Director (GSD). He remained GSD until August 2009 when he retired and was replaced by his successor, Gen-la Kelsang Khyenrab. Each of the individual Centers is legally and financially independent.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1995 Gelong Thubten Gyatso was designated as Kelsang Gyatso's future successor. He disrobed in 1995, and Kelsang Gyatso provisionally appointed 4 'Gen-las', i.e. Losang Kelsang, Kelsang Jangsem, Kelsang Dekyong and Samden Gyatso. After about a year, the former two resigned as Gen-las and were re-appointed as Resident Teachers. Samden Gyatso became the Deputy Spiritual Director and successor to Kelsang Gyatso while Kelsang Dekyong was appointed as the US National Spiritual Director. From this time onwards, the Deputy Spiritual Director also held the appointment of Resident Teacher at Manjushri Kadampa Meditation Centre.\n\nIn February 2007 Samden Gyatso resigned as Deputy Spiritual Director. Kelsang Khyenrab was appointed as Deputy Spiritual Director and became the General Spiritual Director when Kelsang Gyatso retired in Summer 2009.\n\nIn August 2001, Kelsang Gyato established a system of democratic succession for the General Spiritual Director of the NKT- IKBU. The \"Internal Rules\" state:\n\nIn 2008, Gen-la Khyenrab became Acting General Spiritual Director, under Kelsang Gyatso's supervision, and assumed the post of General Spiritual Director in August 2009 for a four-year term. Gen-la Dekyong, the National Spiritual Director of the United States of America, has in turn assumed the post of Deputy Spiritual Director, while retaining her post as US National Spiritual Director in accordance with the \"Internal Rules\". Gen-la Khyenrab retired as the General Spiritual Director due to ill health in April 2010 and, in accordance with the \"Internal Rules\", Gen-la Dekyong was appointed as General Spiritual Director. Her position as Deputy Spiritual Director was taken by Gen-la Kunsang.\n\nAlongside Kelsang Gyatso, who as founder and former spiritual director was the main teacher of the NKT-IKBU and his successors, all teachings (i.e. the three study programs) are held by Western students; lay persons and ordained alike. Qualification as an NKT-IKBU Dharma teacher is generally achieved by attending the NKT-IKBU's own Teacher Training Program, which Kelsang Gyatso regards as \"a western equivalent to the traditional Tibetan Geshe degree.\"\n\nCozort has noted that \"Several of the most prominent Tibetan teachers have long recognized themselves the need to train Westerners as Dharma teachers.\" Kelsang Gyatso explained the importance of Western Dharma teachers to the flourishing of Dharma in the world, saying that one fully qualified teacher is worth a thousand enlightened students. He expounded on the qualifications of NKT-IKBU teachers in 1990:\n\nRegarding the qualifications of NKT-IKBU teachers, Kay observed that \"Whilst personal experience of the teachings is considered important, the dominant view within the NKT is that the main qualification of a teacher is their purity of faith and discipleship.\"\n\nAccording to Robert Bluck, \"Most teachers are appointed to centres by Kelsang Gyatso before they have completed the Teaching Training Programme and continue studying by correspondence, with an intensive study programme at Manjushri each summer.\" Daniel Cozort explained that this is \"rather like graduate students who teach undergraduate courses while pursuing their own Ph.D.'s.\"\n\nKelsang Gyatso has said that monks, nuns, lay men and lay women can all become Spiritual Guides if they have the necessary experience, qualities and training. All NKT-IKBU teachers, lay and ordained, study on the same study and retreat programmes. The \"Internal Rules\" specify the criteria for completing the programme:\n\nIn addition to the TTP commitment, all Resident Teachers have to attend International Teacher Training Program each year, taught in repeated rotation according to a sixteen-year study scheme.\n\nOrdained and lay Resident Teachers who have taught successfully for four years are given the titles 'Gen' and 'Kadam', respectively.\n\nKelsang Samden was appointed by Kelsang Gyatso as the General Spiritual Director of the New Kadampa Tradition in 2005. In 2008 he was disrobed and effectively excommunicated by Kelsang Gyatso following a sexual scandal, whereby Kelsang Samden was accused of attempting to establish his own sexual lineage in the New Kadampa Tradition by engaging in sexual relations with ordained and lay female NKT members, under the guise of such activities being part of Highest Yoga Tantra spiritual practice. It was alleged that his activities had caused great harm to the women concerned, with at least one of the women involved falling pregnant and attempting suicide. Kelsang Samden denied any wrongdoing but disappeared from the organisation into obscurity under a cloud of disgrace.\n\nKelsang Khyenrab who studied and practised Buddhism since 1980 under the guidance of Kelsang Gyatso, was formerly General Spiritual Director of the New Kadampa Tradition (NKT). In 2008, Khyenrab became Acting Spiritual Director, under Kelsang Gyatso's supervision, and assumed the post of Spiritual Director in August 2009 for a four-year term. As Spiritual Director, Khyenrab was the Resident Teacher at Manjushri Temple and Kadampa Meditation Centre, the Mother Center of New Kadampa Buddhism. He Khyenrab resigned in 2010, for health reasons, and was replaced by Kelsang Dekyong.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1995 Gelong Thubten Gyatso (a.k.a. Gen Thubten or Neil Elliot) was appointed as a 'Gen-la' and Resident Teacher of Madhyamaka Centre (Pocklington, York) and as Kelsang Gyatso's future successor. He was described by the NKT as \"the first qualified English Tantric meditation master in Britain\" and was known as the 'heart-disciple' of Geshe Kelsang who wrote a prayer for his long life which was recited regularly at NKT centres. According to Madeleine Bunting \"Gen Thubten [..] is described by former members as having been the 'power behind the throne'.\" Bunting states further that \"Former members understand that Gen Thubten was disrobed because of a breach of his monastic vows. He was deeply revered by the 3,000 NKT members for his knowledge of Buddhism and his charismatic teaching.\"\n\nThe legal document \"A Moral Discipline Guide: The Internal Rules of The New Kadampa Tradition – International Kadampa Buddhist Union\" explains that the NKT-IKBU\n\nThe New Kadampa Truth website explains: \"Its Internal Rules – containing numerous checks and balances on the behavior, election and dismissal of the administrators, teachers, and spiritual directors – also guard against any extreme behavior and are legally binding.\" An NBO member describes them:\n\nThe NKT-IKBU currently lists more than 200 centres and around 900 branch classes/study groups in 40 countries, with an estimated 8,000 members. The centres are independent charitable corporations, and the groups are branches off an established centre which meet weekly in places such as churches and community centres.\n\nIn comparison, Waterhouse says the NKT-IKBU \"is very good at marketing its product\", with Centers and branches producing leaflets that advertise local NKT-IKBU groups in their respective towns, a level of publicity that according to Jones is comparatively more \"forceful and extroverted\" with regard to other Buddhist groups, and has helped the NKT-IKBU to achieve \"a phenomenal increase in membership and centres.\" Another attraction is the high level of activity at an NKT-IKBU Dharma centre, where it is often possible to be taking part at the centre every day of the week, in contrast to other groups \"which meet on a weekly basis but provide little other support or activity.\"\n\nBluck attributes NKT-IKBU's rapid growth to \"a wish to share the Dharma rather than ‘conversion and empire-building’.\" Kay says that the NKT-IKBU is sensitive to criticism on the subject of expansion and cites Kelsang Gyatso's response to any criticisms about its outreach efforts, stating that \"every organization 'tries to attract more people with appropriate publicity.'\"\n\nNew Dharma centres are expected to be self-supporting, as neither Kelsang Gyatso nor the NKT-IKBU owns the centres.\n\nA Kadampa Meditation Centre (KMC) is a Kadampa Dharma Center that serves the local, national, and international communities. A KMC is generally more centrally organised than regular Kadampa Buddhist Centers. Besides having a program of courses for the local community, KMCs host major gatherings such as Dharma Celebrations, National Festivals, and International Festivals. They are also home to the International Kadampa Temples. KMCs are non-profit organisations and all their annual profits are donated to the International Temples Project. There are currently 18 KMCs around the world, with several in the US.\n\nThe NKT-IKBU has established a Kadampa Buddhist Temple in the United Kingdom, as well as in Canada, the United States, and Spain; recently opened a Temple in Brazil, with plans to build one in Germany too. The NKT-IKBU states in its publicity that:\n"}
{"id": "560165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=560165", "title": "Psilocybe cyanescens", "text": "Psilocybe cyanescens\n\nPsilocybe cyanescens (sometimes referred to as wavy caps or as the potent Psilocybe) is a species of potent psychedelic mushroom. The main compounds responsible for its psychedelic effects are psilocybin and psilocin. It belongs to the family Hymenogastraceae. A formal description of the species was published by Elsie Wakefield in 1946 in the Transactions of the British Mycological Society, based on a specimen she had recently collected at Kew Gardens. She had begun collecting the species as early as 1910. The mushroom is not generally regarded as being physically dangerous to adults. Since all the psychoactive compounds in \"P. cyanescens\" are water-soluble, the fruiting bodies can be rendered non-psychoactive through parboiling, allowing their culinary use. However, since most people find them overly bitter and they are too small to have great nutritive value, this is not frequently done.\n\n\"Psilocybe cyanescens\" can sometimes fruit in colossal quantity; more than 100,000 mushrooms were found growing in a single patch at a racetrack in England.\n\n\"Psilocybe cyanescens\" has a hygrophanous pileus (cap) that is caramel to chestnut-brown when moist, fading to pale buff or slightly yellowish when dried. Caps generally measure from 1.5–5 cm (½\" to 2\") across, and are normally distinctly wavy in maturity. The color of the pileus is rarely seen in mushrooms outside of the \"P. cyanescens\" species complex. Most parts of the mushroom, including the cap and Lamellae (gills, underneath the cap) can stain blue when touched or otherwise disturbed, probably due to the oxidation of psilocin. The lamellae are adnate, and light brown to dark purple brown in maturity, with lighter gill edges. There is no distinct annulus, but immature \"P. cyanescens\" specimens do have a cobwebby veil which may leave an annular zone in maturity. Both the odor and taste are farinaceous.\n\n\"P. cyanescens\" has smooth, elliptical spores which measure 9 - 12 x 5 - 8 µm. According to some authors, the holotype collection of the species from Kew Gardens featured no pleurocystidia, but North American collections are characterized by common clavate-mucronate pleurocystidia. However, pleurocystidia are present in the holotype collection (but not easily to observe since hymenium is collapsed). In European collections of \"P. cyanescens\", pleurocystidia are common and their shape is identical to those known from the United States. In 2012, an epitype from Hamburg, Germany was designated.\n\nFresh sporocarps and mycelia of \"P. cyanescens\" generally bruise blueish or blue-green where damaged, and the staining remains visible after drying. This staining is most noticeable on the stem (which is white when undisturbed) but can also occur on other parts of the mushroom, including the gills, cap, and mycelium. This staining is due primarily to the oxidation of psilocin. (Psilocybin cannot be oxidized directly, but is quickly converted via enzymatic action to psilocin at injury sites which can then be oxidized, so even specimens with little psilocin still generally blue.)\n\nOther related species may include \"P. weraroa\", and these relatives are collectively referred to as the \"\"Psilocybe cyanescens\" complex\" or as the \"caramel-capped psilocybe complex,\" due to their extremely similar appearance and habit. There is phylogenetic evidence that there are two distinct clades in the complex, one consisting of \"P. cyanescens\" and \"P. azurescens\" and allies, and the other consisting of \"P. serbica\" and allies (European taxa). It has also been shown that \"Psilocybe weraroa\" (previously known as \"Weraroa novae-zelandiae\") is very closely related to \"P. cyanescens\" despite its vastly dissimilar appearance.\n\nA very close relative of \"P. cyanescens\" is \"Psilocybe allenii\" (described in 2012), formerly known as \"Psilocybe cyanofriscosa\", a mushroom found in California and Washington It can be distinguished by macromorphological features and/or sequencing of rDNA ITS molecular marker.\n\nIt is often difficult or impossible to distinguish between members of the \"P. cyanescens\" complex except by range without resorting to microscopic or molecular characters.\n\nAlthough not closely related, \"Psilocybe cyanescens\" has been at least occasionally confused with \"Galerina marginata\" with fatal results. The two mushrooms have generally similar habits and appearances, and bear a superficial resemblance to each other such that inexperienced mushroom-seekers may confuse the two. The two species can grow side-by-side, which may add to the chance of confusion. \n\n\"Psilocybe cyanescens\" grows today primarily on wood chips, especially in and along the perimeter of mulched plant beds in urban areas, but can also grow on other lignin-rich substrates. \"P. cyanescens\" does not grow on substrate that is not lignin-rich. Fruitings have been reported in natural settings previously (although most appear to be migrations from mulched plant beds.) The species does not typically grow on mulch that is made from bark.\n\nIn the United States, \"P. cyanescens\" occurs mainly in the Pacific Northwest, south to the San Francisco Bay Area. It can also be found in areas such as Western Europe, Central Europe, New Zealand and parts of west Asia (Iran). The range in which \"P. cyanescens\" occurs is rapidly expanding, especially in areas where it is not native as the use of mulch to control weeds has been popularized. This rapid expansion of range may be due in part to the simple expedient of \"P. cyanescens\" mycelium having colonized the distribution network of woodchip suppliers and thus being distributed on a large scale with commercial mulch. It has been documented to fruit in Spring on the East Coast of the United States.\n\nAlthough it has been speculated that \"P. cyanescens\"' native habitat is the coniferous woodlands of the north-western United States or coastal dunes in the PNW, the type specimen was described from mulch beds in Kew Gardens, and there is no widely accepted explanation of \"P. cyanescens\" original habitat. \n\nFruiting is dependent on a drop in temperature. In the San Francisco Bay Area, this means that fruiting typically occurs between late October and February, and fruiting in other areas generally occurs in fall, when temperatures are between 10-18 °C (50-65 °F).\n\n\"P. cyanescens\" often fruits gregariously or in cespitose clusters, sometimes in great numbers. 100,000 \"P. cyanescens\" fruits were once found growing on a racetrack in the south of England. Solitary fruits are sometimes also found.\n\nThe fruits of \"P. cyanescens\" have been shown to contain many different indole alkaloids including psilocybin, psilocin, and baeocystin. It has also been shown that \"P. cyanescens\" mycelium will contain detectable levels of psilocin and psilocybin, but only after the formation of primordia.\n\nIndole content has been shown to be higher in North American specimens of \"P. cyanescens\" than in European ones. This was, however, caused by the fact that Gartz did not analyze the genuine \"P. cyanescens\" but \"P. serbica\".\n\nNorth American fruiting bodies of \"P. cyanescens\" have been shown to contain between 0.66% and 1.96% total indole content by dry weight. European fruiting bodies have been shown to have between 0.39% and 0.75% total indole content by dry weight.\n\nNorth American specimens of \"P. cyanescens\" are among the most potent of psychedelic mushrooms. Its potency means that it is widely sought after by users of recreational drugs in those areas where it grows naturally.\n\n\"P. cyanescens\", like many other psilocybin containing mushrooms, is sometimes cultivated.\n\nDue to the fruiting requirements of the species, it is challenging but possible to get \"P. cyanescens\" to produce fruits indoors. Outdoor cultivation in an appropriate climate is relatively easy. Yield per pound of substrate is low when compared to other psilocybin containing mushrooms for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. The combination of poor yield and difficulty may explain why \"P. cyanescens\" is grown less frequently than some other psilocybin containing mushrooms.\n\n\"P. cyanescens\" mycelium is much easier to grow than actual fruits are, can be grown indoors, and is robust enough that it can be transplanted in order to start new patches. Mycelium can also be propagated via stem butt transplantation.\n\nMany of the cultivation techniques used with other members of the genus \"Psilocybe\" can be used to grow \"P. cyanescens\" as well.\n\nCultivated \"P. cyanescens\" contain approximately the same concentration of psilocin and psilocybin as natural examples do.\n\n\"P. cyanescens\" specimens do not fall under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances because the convention does not cover naturally occurring plants that incidentally contain a scheduled drug. However, many countries choose to prohibit possession of psilocybin containing mushrooms, including \"P. cyanescens\", under their domestic laws. \n\nCountries that have banned or severely regulated the possession of \"P. cyanescens\" include the United States, Germany, New Zealand, and many others. Although this is difficult to enforce since no species of Psilocybe mushroom has spores containing psilocybin or psilocin. Because of this, \"Psilocybe cyanescens\" spores are not illegal to possess in many US states. (It is illegal to possess spores in Georgia and Idaho, and illegal to possess them with the intent to produce mushrooms in California.) \n\n"}

The term \"safe environment\" was used by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard to refer to his conception of Scientology's organizations as a bulwark against what he described as \"the dangerous environment of the wog [non-Scientology] world, of injustice, sudden dismissals, war, atomic bombs\" which would \"only persist and trouble us if we fail to spread our safe environment across the world.\"\n\nAccording to a petition submitted to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in May 1980, the Safe Environment Fund had \"undertaken the responsibility of contributing toward the defendant's legal expenses in this case. The Safe Environment Fund is a charitable organization, associated with the Church of Scientology, and the monies needed for the defendant's legal defense have to be raised by public contributions and donations.\" The petition requested permission for Jane Kember and Mo Budlong, two executives of the Church's Guardian's Office who had been extradited from England to face trial in the United States, to appear at fund-raising events \"to be held in various places in the United States\". The petition was opposed by the government, which described the Safe Environment Fund as \"an integral arm of the Church of Scientology created for the sole purpose of paying for the legal fees of the defendants, thus hiding the fact that the church was paying for these expenses.\"\n\nThe Safe Environment Fund was later described by former Guardian's Office staff member Janie Peterson, who had worked in the Las Vegas Guardian Office until 1979. Testifying at the City of Clearwater Commission Hearing on the Church of Scientology on May 8, 1982, she reported that the Church told its members that the indictment of Scientology executives \"was a big conspiracy by the government, that these — that was the reason these people were indicted, and that these people had, at no time, ever done anything wrong or not legal, that the government had no information that was correct. We were not told that they were, indeed, guilty of the crimes or that they even later pleaded guilty to the crimes.\" It was said to have raised \"many, many thousands of dollars\", though Church members involved in fund-raising were instructed \"to tell any public official, the press, or anyone that we did not operate the Safe Environment Fund while we were on what's called Post Time; in other words, we were to say that it was totally separate, it was something we were doing on our time. We were not allowed to say that, in fact, it was a big part of our job.\" The Safe Environment Fund raised money from Scientologists through \"rallies and meetings and that type of thing and [they would] talk about the indictees and how much money it was costing. And then the people were to give donations.\"\n\nAnother fund-raising route was described by L. Ron Hubbard's former biographical researcher, Gerry Armstrong, during his defense in the 1984 case \"Church of Scientology v. Gerald Armstrong\". After reading that Hubbard was responsible for writing the screenplay for the 1941 movie \"Dive Bomber\", one of the Safe Environment Fund personnel came up with the idea of holding screenings of the film to raise money for the fund. Armstrong double-checked the provenance of the film to ensure that the fund's attribution of its authorship to Hubbard was accurate and found – despite Hubbard's claims to the contrary – that two other screenwriters were credited with the film. By this time, however, the fund had already put up posters and \"glossy promotional items [in which] L. Ron Hubbard was noted as the man behind the scenes\", and people had paid money to view the film.\n\n\n"}

In 1933, he and his mother, poet Alla von Steiger, emigrated to Switzerland, while Golowin’s Russian father, a sculptor, lived in Paris without the family. \n\nAfter finishing school, Golowin became a library assistant at the \"Berner Stadt- und Universitätsbibliothek\" (literally: \"Bern City- and University-Library\").

Afterward, he was a free writer living near Bern.\n\nSergius Golowin wrote numerous books and articles, primarily about folklore and esotericism. For his work in folklore and exploring the counterculture, he was awarded the prize of the Schweizerische Schillerstiftung in 1974.\n\nGolowin was a contemporary of many notable people and events. He provided assistance to Timothy Leary while Leary was in Swiss exile. Golowin was a friend of Friedrich Dürrenmatt, and was portrayed by H. R. Giger. Golowin was present at the first performance of Polo Hofer's legendary Bern band \"Rumpelstilz\" and the band played on behalf of Golowin's election campaign. Golowin was an acquaintance of Martin \"Tino\" Schippert, founder of the Swiss Hells Angels.\n\nIn 1973, Golowin teamed up with Klaus Schulze, Bernd Witthüser, Walter Westrupp, Jörg Mierke, Jürgen Dollase and Jerry Berkers (the latter two of Wallenstein) to record the album \"Lord Krishna von Goloka\". This very experimental and highly sought-after album featured chantings by Golowin over improvised electronic instrumentation and acoustic guitar, and is considered by many to be a classic example of cosmic krautrock.\n\n"}

In 1841, he became Maharaja of the Sikh Empire and the Punjab. \n\nIn 1820, Maharaja Ranjit Singh granted him the privilege of being seated in the Darbar and bestowed civil and military honours on him. From 1831 to 1834 he acted as Governor of Kashmir and in 1834 he was a commander in the force that captured Peshawar from the Afghans.\n\nHe was the son of Maharaja Ranjit Singh and Maharani Mehtab Kaur, who was also the mother of Prince Tara Singh (1807-1859). (Mehtab Kaur, who was also known as Mahitab Kaur, is not to be confused with Maharani Mahtab Devi Sahiba, daughter of Maharaja Sansar Chand of Kangra, another wife, who committed \"sati\" in 1839 with Ranjit Singh lying with his head on her lap.)\n\nHe became Maharaja on 27 January 1841, after the sudden death of Nau Nihal Singh whose death was set in motion, some say purposely, while returning from his father's cremation. He was the half brother of Nau Nihal Singh's father, Maharaja Kharak Singh.\n\nProclaimed Maharaja by his wazir (prime minister) Dhian Singh Dogra, he won the throne after a protracted siege of the Lahore Fort which was held by the Royal family. Thousands died in the siege. \n\nHistorians record that he was not very smart politically and let the Dogra brothers take charge of all functions of state. The Dogras, like puppet masters, pulled the strings of others to bring about the death of Sher Singh. \n\nSher Singh was killed as he reached for a new shotgun held by Ajit Singh Sandhawalia, who pulled the trigger. Sher Singh only had time to utter, \"what treachery.\" The Sandhawalias also murdered Dhian Singh. The Sandhawalias were thought to have also had designs on the empire.\n\nHis palace is leased to Baring Union Christian College.\n\n"}

Approximately five percent (fifty thousand) of Burma's monks belong to this order. It is one of nine legally sanctioned monastic orders (\"nikāya\") in the country, under the 1990 Law Concerning Sangha Organizations. Shwegyin Nikaya is a more orthodox order than Thudhamma Nikaya, with respect to adherence to the Vinaya, and its leadership is more centralized and hierarchical. The head of the Shwegyin Nikaya is called the \"Sangha Sammuti\" (), whose authority on doctrine and religious practice is considered absolute ().\n\nShwegyin Nikaya was founded in the mid-nineteenth century by a chief abbot monk in the village of Shwegyin. It formally separated from the Thudhamma Nikaya during the reign of King Mindon Min, and attempts to reconcile the two sects by the last king of Burma, Thibaw Min, were unsuccessful. Monks of the Shwegyin Nikaya did not participate in the nationalist and anti-colonial movement in British Burma of the early 1900s.\n\nIn the 1960s, with the ascent of Ne Win to power, the Shwegyin Nikaya gained monastic influence in the country, as Ne Win sought counsel from a monk at the Mahagandayon Monastery, a Shwegyin monastery in Amarapura.\n\n"}

{"id": "5611669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5611669", "title": "Stewardship (theology)", "text": "Stewardship (theology)\n\nStewardship is a theological belief that humans are responsible for the world, and should take care of it. Believers in stewardship are usually people who believe in one God who created the universe and all that is within it, also believing that they must take care of creation and look after it. Creation includes animals and the environment. Many religions and denominations have various degrees of support for environmental stewardship. It can have political implications, such as in Christian Democracy.\n\nMany moderate and progressive Roman Catholics, Orthodox Christians, and Evangelical Protestants see some form of environmentalism as a consequence of stewardship. In Jewish, Christian and Muslim traditions, stewardship refers to the way time, talents, material possessions, or wealth are used or given for the service of God.\n\nSome pagan or secular views include a Gaia philosophy which accepts the Earth as a holy being or goddess.\n\nThe Jewish holiday of Tu Bishvat, or “the Birthday of the Trees,” is also known as Jewish Arbor Day. Some want to expand it to a more global environmental focus.\n\nA biblical world view of stewardship can be consciously defined as: \"Utilizing and managing all resources God provides for the glory of God and the betterment of His creation.\" The central essence of biblical world view stewardship is managing everything God brings into the believer's life in a manner that honors God and impacts eternity.\n\nStewardship begins and ends with the understanding of God's ownership of all:\n\nStewardship is further supported and sustained theologically on the understanding of God's holiness as found in such verse as: Genesis 1:2, Psalm 104, Psalm 113, 1 Chronicles 29:10-20, Colossians 1:16, and Revelation 1:8.\n\nThere is a strong link between stewardship and environmentalism. What does it mean for humans 'to take care of the world'? Environmental stewardship is typically thought of as entailing reducing human impacts into the natural world. However, philosopher Neil Paul Cummins claims that humans have a special stewardship role on the planet because through their technology humans are able to save life from otherwise certain elimination. This is a modern-day interpretation of Noah’s Ark, the cornerstone of human stewardship being technological protection and regulation.\n\nChristian Stewardship refers to the responsibility that Christians have in maintaining and using wisely the gifts that God has bestowed. God wishes human beings to be his collaborators in the work of creation, redemption and sanctification. Increasingly this has referred to environmental protectionism. This also includes traditional Christian Ministries that share the resources of treasure, time and talent.\n\nAn example of stewardship is in Genesis 2:15. \"And the L God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.\" The drive to \"serve the garden in which we have been placed\" (also Genesis 2:15) sees Christian influence in political and practical affairs.\n\nThe concept is also seen in Leviticus 25:1-5 \"\"The L said to Moses on Mount Sinai, 2 \"Speak to the Israelites and say to them: `When you enter the land I am going to give you, the land itself must observe a Sabbath to the L. 3 For six years sow your fields, and for six years prune your vineyards and gather their crops. 4 But in the seventh year the land is to have a Sabbath of rest, a Sabbath to the L. Do not sow your fields or prune your vineyards. 5 Do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the grapes of your untended vines. The land is to have a year of rest.\"\" The implication is that the land is not to be exhausted or abused for short-term gains.\n\nStewardship in Christianity follows from the belief that human beings are created by the same God who created the entire universe and everything in it. To look after the Earth, and thus God's dominion, is the responsibility of the Christian steward.\n\nA useful quote explaining stewardship can be found in Psalm 24:1: \"The Earth is the Lord's and all that is in it, the world, and those who live in it\".\n\nA broader concept of stewardship is illustrated in Jesus’ parable of the “talents”, which refer to an amount of money but by implication (and by common use of the word in English) as “abilities.\"\n\nMatthew 25.14-30 –\n\n\nAdditionally, frequent references to the “tithe”, or giving of a “tenth” (the meaning of “tithe) are found throughout the Bible. The tithe represents the returning to God a significant, specific, and intentional portion of material gain. However, giving is not limited to the tithe or a specific amount, illustrated by Jesus’ comment that a woman who gave a very small amount had given more than those had given large amounts because \"“while they gave out of their abundance, she gave all she had to live on.”\" (Mark 12.41-44; Luke 21.1-4)\n\nThe Dutch political party \"CDA\" (Christian Democratic Appeal) lists stewardship as one of its four key ideals. This refers not only to taking care of the environment, but also a principled stand towards human as well as natural resources. A commitment to clear principles, rather than pragmatism, is another facet of stewardship.\n\nMany Christians practice the spiritual discipline of intentional financial stewardship, giving to churches or other ministries. Fewer, though still a significant number, commit time in service to the needy or in other areas, often utilizing and donating specialized skills and abilities.\n\n\n\n"}

Armstrong's analysis starts with developments in Judaism and traces it through the creation of fundamentalism in Christianity to adoption of a similar approach to modernity in Islam.\n\nArmstrong's central case rests on the confusion between \"mythos\" and \"logos\", using these in the technical sense suggested by Johannes Slok. Myth concerns \"what was thought to be timeless and constant in our existence... Myth was not concerned with practical matters but with meaning\". By contrast \"Logos was the rational, pragmatic and scientific thought that enabled men and women to function well in the world\". In religion, logos appears in legal systems and practical action. By the eighteenth century, \"people in Europe and America began to think that \"logos\" was the only means to truth and began to discount \"mythos\" as false and superstitious.\" Armstrong suggests that fundamentalists have turned their mythos into logos using the mindset of the modern scientific age.\n\nThe first part of the book, \"The Old World and the New\", compares the progression of the three monotheistic faiths between 1492, when Columbus discovered America, and 1870, when \"The Franco-Prussian War had revealed the hideous effects of modern weaponry, and there was a dawning realisation that science might also have a malignant dimension.\" It traces the way Jews and Muslims modernized during this period.\n\nThis leads to the modern period described in part two, “Fundamentalism”, when there was a growing adoption of a literalist interpretation of scripture in the United States, which eventually gave rise to \"The Fundamentals\", a series of 12 volumes refuting modern ideas published shortly before and during the World War I, of which 3 million copies were distributed to every pastor, professor and theological student across America by the largesse of oil millionaires. Though this led to a distinctive ideology, it was not till the 1980s that it emerged as a political force.\n\nIn Judaism, the growth of Zionism was given its biggest boost by the Holocaust which led to the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. Although many traditional Jews migrated there, the most conservative rejected the secular interpretation of Zionism and it wasn't until the emergence of Gush Emunim after the Yom Kippur War in 1974 that fundamentalism emerged in Israel as a political force.\n\nIn Islam, fundamentalism did not emerge until modernization had taken hold, first in Egypt with the creation of the Muslim Brotherhood by Hasan al-Banna. Armstrong traces the development of Sunni fundamentalism under Sayyid Qutb and Shia fundamentalism under Ayatollah Khomeini.\n\nAfter 9/11, Karen Armstrong became one of the best selling authors in the US, as people attempted to understand the culture of men capable of carrying out such acts. One reviewer points out that \"9-11 holds a fresh irony. While Osama and Co. wouldn't exist without the hegemony of Western secularism to rally against, their most effective attack on the Great Satan has breathed new life into our own fundamentalist tendencies.\"\n"}

It is one of 9 legally sanctioned monastic orders (nikaya) in the country, under the 1990 Law Concerning Sangha Organizations. Thudhamma is considered a more pragmatic order than the Shwegyin Nikaya, with looser rules regarding Vinaya regulations and is less hierarchical than the former. Like all the major orders in Burma, Thudhamma Nikaya prohibits monks from engaging in political activity.\nThudhamma Nikaya was founded in the late 18th century by King Bodawpaya, after a series of Sangha reforms by prior Konbaung kings to purify and unite the Sangha. The name 'Thudhamma' comes from the Thudhamma Council (an ecclesiastical organization founded by Bodawpaya), which in turn is named after Mandalay's Thudhamma Zayats, the meeting grounds for the Council.\n\nThe office of the Supreme Patriarch ( or \"Thathanabaing\"), similar to the position of Sangharaja in Thailand and Cambodia, dates back to the 13th century, started by the monk Shin Arahan in the Pagan Kingdom. The Thathanabaing was responsible for managing the monastic hierarchy and education at monasteries. In 1784, King Bodawpaya assembled the Thudhamma Council, led by the Thathanapaing and four elders ( or \"thera\") to resolve a longstanding issue on the proper wearing of monk's robes (whether one or both shoulders should be exposed). Toward the end of the Konbaung dynasty, the council, which oversaw religious affairs in the kingdom, including the appointment of monastery abbots, Vinaya regulations, discipline of individual monks, and administration of Pali examination, was expanded to include 8 elders.\n\n"}

The devotion became tied to the \"Reconquista\" of Spain, then still at its height. In the following century it spread to other parts of Europe. When Spain began the exploration and conquest of the Americas, it was a favorite devotion of the Spanish conquistadores. It remains a popular devotion in Spain and Latin America.\n\nThe Virgin of Los Remedios is the patron saint of the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Cristóbal de La Laguna and the island of Tenerife.\n\nIt is believed that the best known image in the Western Hemisphere under this title of Mary was brought to Mexico by the \"conquistadores\". It is a small statue, measuring 27 cm (about 10.5 inches) in height. This image is strongly linked with the Spanish Conquest, especially the episode known as the \"Noche Triste\" or \"Night of Sorrows\". It is said Cortés led his men to an indigenous religious sanctuary to escape the Aztecs, stopping here on their way to Otumba. According to legend, one of Cortés's soldiers, Gonzalo Rodríguez de Villafuerte, was carrying a small image of the Virgin Mary and hid her under a maguey plant in order to retrieve and pay homage to her later if he survived. During a later battle in this area, the Spanish reported seeing a young girl throwing dirt into the eyes of the Aztecs to help the Spanish. Another legend states that this image appeared at the Cerro de los Pajaros, where a chapel was built in 1574, which later was expanded in 1628 with a vaulted roof and cupola.\n\nBeing connected with the Conquest, this image of the Virgin is considered to be “Spanish” and a patroness to them and to the indigenous who adopt Spanish ways. She is considered one of the Virgins who correlate with the four cardinal directions (in her case, the west), along with the Virgins of Guadalupe, of la Piedad and de la Bala.\n\nDespite her importance to the area, this image was kept at the Mexico City Cathedral until 1810, when it was moved to her sanctuary in Naucalpan, dressed as a general. It was proclaimed a patroness of Spain and the “guardian of the Spanish Army.” The purpose of this was to counter Miguel Hidalgo’s use of the Virgin of Guadalupe as a symbol of his independence movement.\n\nThis image was center of one of the first annual processions to be held in Mexico, which went from the Church of Santa Veracruz in Mexico City to her home sanctuary in Los Remedios National Park. Its feast day is celebrated on September 1, when the sanctuary is profusely decorated with white flowers, including a carpet of flower petals in the San Miguel Arcangel esplanade. This sanctuary is not located in the mountainous western part of the municipality where Los Remedios National Park stands. Her feast day is celebrated with dances knowns as “Los Apaches,” “Los Moros,” “Chichimecas” and “Pastorcitas,” with 450th anniversary of her finding celebrated in 1990.\n\n\n"}
