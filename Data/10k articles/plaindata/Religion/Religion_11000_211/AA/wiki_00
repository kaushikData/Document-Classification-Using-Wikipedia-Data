The teams were reportedly being dispatched to \"tackle the rise of Satanism\" according to the UK newspaper the Daily Mail. The report, first made public by 82-year-old Father Gabriele Amorth, the Vatican \"exorcist-in-chief,\" to the online Catholic news service Petrus, was almost immediately dismissed by Vatican officials but the publication of the reports represented an unusual instance where the existence of adjurists was acknowledged. \n\nMedia references to such groups continues to become mainstreams with articles appearing in the Washington Post in February, 2008 highlighted the rise of such activities noting \"About 70 priests serve as trained exorcists in Poland, about double the number of five years ago. An estimated 300 exorcists are active in Italy. Foremost among them: the Gabriele Amorth, 82, who performs exorcisms daily in Rome and is dean of Europe's corps of demon-battling priests.\" \n\nIn popular culture, the adjurist concept was used in the straight-to-video film The Devil's Tomb, starring Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ron Perlman. In the movie, Henry Rollins plays a priest claiming to be a member of a group performing exorcisms and ingesting evil spirits.\n\nWithin theosophy, Helena Petrovna Blavatsky wrote there are references to \"the Adjurists, Exorcists, Conjurerists, and Intercessors\" in relation to Nigromancy, or the practice of the black arts. Ascribing evil intent to adjurists is common in older texts, though some believe their actions to be misunderstood and actually noble.\"\n"}

It lies in the Black Elk Wilderness area, in southern Pennington County, in the Black Hills National Forest. The peak lies west-southwest of Mount Rushmore. At , it has been described by the Board on Geographical Names as the highest summit in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nAlthough part of the North American Cordillera (the Rocky Mountains in a broader sense) the Chisos Mountains of the Big Bend of Texas are far east of the continental divide and contain mountains higher than Black Elk peak and range from 14 to 16 (nautical) miles further east at 103°15′29″W.\n\nIt is also known as Hiŋháŋ Káǧa (in Lakota).\n\nThe U.S. Board on Geographic Names, which has jurisdiction in federal lands, officially changed the mountain's name from \"Harney Peak\" to \"Black Elk Peak\" on August 11, 2016, honoring Black Elk, the noted Lakota Sioux medicine man for whom the Wilderness Area is named.\n\nProfessional but unofficial measurements in 2016 found the highest natural rock to be at NAVD88 and the nearby secondary peak slightly lower at .\n\nThis peak was called \"Hiŋháŋ Káǧa\", or, \"Owl maker,\" after rock formations that look like owls (and the association of owls with impending death by the Lakota Sioux). They dominated this region and occupied the territory at the time of European colonization. They considered it a sacred site within the Black Hills, which they call \"Pahá Sápa\" and \"Ȟé Sápa\".\n\nThe mountain was named Harney Peak in 1855 by American Lieutenant Gouverneur K. Warren in honor of US General William S. Harney, his commander in a regional military expedition. In punitive retaliation for other Sioux raids, in September 1855 Harney's forces killed Brulé Sioux warriors, women and children in what Americans called the Battle of Blue Water Creek in Garden County, Nebraska.\n\nHarney later commanded the United States military in the Black Hills area in the late 1870s. \nThe Lakota had tried to get the name of the peak changed for 50 years, as Harney had massacred their people.\n\nIn 2014 the Sioux renewed their effort to get the name changed, in an effort led by Basil Brave Heart of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. A Korean War veteran, he felt that Harney had not honored the military with his action.\n\nSome Lakota requested state officials in 2015 to reinstate their original name \"Hinhan Kaga\" for the peak. The Lakota Council of the Pine Ridge Reservation and descendants of Black Elk, a noted medicine man, supported naming it for him, as the national wilderness area around the peak is named for the shaman.\n\nHe became known beyond the Lakota in part through the book \"Black Elk Speaks\" (1932), written by John G. Neihardt from long talks with the shaman. South Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard opposed the name change, as did other state officials, and no action was taken in 2015.\n\nThe U.S. Board on Geographic Names officially changed the mountain's name from \"Harney Peak\" to \"Black Elk Peak\" on August 11, 2016, by a unanimous vote of 12–0, with one abstention. On August 18, 2016, Gov. Daugaard announced that the state would accept the new name.\n\nHinhan Kaga and the Black Hills were protected within the Great Sioux Reservation established by the United States government in the Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1868; it covered most of the territory west of the Missouri River in South Dakota (the area now called West River). American settlement was concentrated east of the river, where there was more water for farming.\n\nThe first Americans believed to have reached the summit were a party led by General George Armstrong Custer in 1874, during the Black Hills expedition. He was looking for gold. The federal government took back the Black Hills and another strip of land in a new treaty in 1877. More than a decade later, it broke up the Great Sioux Reservation in 1889 into five smaller reservations, the same year that North Dakota and South Dakota were admitted as states to the Union. The government made some 9 million acres of former Lakota land available for purchase for ranching and homesteading. Most American settlement in West River did not start until the early 20th century. The area attracted many European immigrants as well as migrants from the East.\n\nBlack Elk Peak is the site where Black Elk (Lakota Sioux) received his \"Great Vision\" when nine years old. He later became a medicine man known for his wisdom. Late in life, he returned to the peak accompanied by writer John Neihardt. Black Elk was sharing much of his life and philosophy with Neihardt through long talks translated by his son. Neihardt tried to express the medicine man's wisdom in his book \"Black Elk Speaks\" (1932).\n\nNeihardt recorded Black Elk's words about his vision as follows: \n\n\"I was standing on the highest mountain of them all, and round about beneath me was the whole hoop of the world,\" he is quoted as saying. \"And while I stood there I saw more than I can tell and I understood more than I saw; for I was seeing in a sacred manner the shapes of all things in the spirit, and the shape of all shapes as they must live together like one being.\"\n\nAmerican settlers used Black Elk Peak as a fire lookout tower in 1911, with a wood crate placed at the summit for a seat. In 1920, a 12'x12' wood structure was built, and it was expanded to 16'x16' the following year. The federal Civilian Conservation Corps enlisted local men and completed construction of a stone fire tower in 1938, one of numerous projects in the state during the Great Depression. The Harney Peak fire tower was last staffed in 1967.\n\nA United States post office was operated at Black Elk Peak from 1936 until 1942, and again from 1945 until 1946. The Harney Peak post office was reportedly one of the \"most elevated post offices in the United States\".\n\nIn May 2015 the South Dakota Board of Geographic Names recommended renaming Harney Peak as \"Hinhan Kaga,\" to remove the name of a commander known for massacring Sioux women and children at the Battle of Blue Water Creek and to honor the original Lakota name for the mountain. At the end of the following month, the board reversed the recommendation that the peak be renamed saying that \"there was no public consensus on a new name.\" The Lakota were divided on a preferred name, and Republican Governor Dennis Daugaard and some other Americans opposed any name change.\n\nThe recommendation for renaming went to the federal US Board on Geographic Names. The federal board acknowledged that the name was of concern to the Lakota, and its spokesman said, \"In this case, the board felt that the name was derogatory or offensive, being that it was on a holy site of the Native Americans.\" In a decision published August 11, 2016, the United States Board on Geographic Names adopted the name \"Black Elk Peak.\"\n\nThe summit can be reached from Sylvan Lake, Camp Remington, Highway 244, Palmer Creek Rd., Mount Rushmore, or Horse Thief Lake. From the trailhead at Sylvan Lake in Custer State Park, to the summit and back is about . This is the shortest, least strenuous, and most popular route. No permit is required for use of the first portion of the trail. However, the United States Forest Service requires hikers to obtain a permit at a self-service kiosk located at the entrance to the Black Elk Wilderness area en route to the summit.\n\nAn old stone tower, once used as a fire lookout tower, is located at the summit. The ashes of Valentine McGillycuddy were interred near the base of the tower and a plaque reads, \"Valentine McGillycuddy, Wasicu Wakan.\" \"Wasicu Wakan\" is Lakota for \"Holy White Man.\"\n\n"}

It is organised on an all-Ireland basis and is the second-largest Christian church on the island after the Roman Catholic Church. Like other Anglican churches, it has retained elements of pre-Reformation practice, notably its episcopal polity, while rejecting the primacy of the Bishop of Rome. In theological and liturgical matters, it incorporates many principles of the Reformation, particularly those espoused during the English Reformation. The church self-identifies as being both Catholic and Reformed. Within the church, differences exist between those members who are more Catholic-leaning (high church) and those who are more Protestant-leaning (low church or evangelical). For historical and cultural reasons, the Church of Ireland is generally identified as a Protestant church.\n\nThe Church of Ireland describes itself as\nThe Church of Ireland considers itself Catholic because it is in possession of a continuous tradition of faith and practice, based on scripture and early traditions, enshrined in the Catholic creeds, together with the sacraments and apostolic ministry. However, the Church of Ireland is also Protestant, or Reformed, since it opposes doctrines and ways of worshipping that it considers contrary to scripture and which led to the Reformation.\nWhen the English Parliament declared that the Holy See had no power over the Church in England, the Church in Ireland also conformed, assuming possession of most church property and so retaining a great repository of religious architecture and other items, though some were later destroyed. The church explains its possession of so many of the ancient church buildings of Ireland by reference to the precedent set by Emperor Constantine the Great in the 4th century:Since the days of the Emperor Constantine in the 4th century European states saw themselves as having a central role in the government of the Church. This church-state link was vigorously applied when the Normans came to Ireland in the 12th century. Bishops were required to do homage to the king for their lands, just like earls and barons, who were vassals of the crown. It was therefore accepted, both during and after the Reformation, that the Crown should continue to exercise that authority over the church, in which it continued to play a central role. In this way, church property that existed at the time of the Reformation, buildings included, was retained by the Reformed, Established (state) Church of Ireland.\n\nIn Ireland, the substantial majority of the population continued to adhere to Roman Catholicism, despite the political and economic advantages of membership in the state church. Despite its numerical minority, however, the Church of Ireland remained the official state church until the Irish Church Act 1869 disestablished it on 1 January 1871, under Queen Victoria and her Liberal government led by William Ewart Gladstone.\n\nThe Church of Ireland claimed that in breaking with Rome the reformed established church was reverting to a condition that had obtained in the church in Ireland prior to the 12th century – the independent character of Celtic Christianity. Modern scholarship, however, sees the early Irish church as different to but still a part of Roman Christianity, with the result that the Church of Ireland and the Irish Roman Catholic church can both claim descent from St Patrick.\n\nClaims of legitimacy for the Norman invasion of Ireland were derived from a Papal Bull of 1155 – \"Laudabiliter\", although the governing structures in Ireland had never acknowledged any external authority over Ireland. The bull claimed to give King Henry II of England the right to invade Ireland, ostensibly as a means of reforming the church in Ireland more directly under the control of the Holy See. The authorisation from the Holy See was based upon the putative Donation of Constantine which claimed to make every Christian island in the western Roman Empire the property of the Papacy, though as Ireland was never a part of the Roman Empire, it had no real relevance. By the time of the English Reformation, the Donation had been exposed as a forgery, and Henry VIII sought to undo by enforcing laws regarding praemunire the historic royal homage to the Papacy that was delivered by John, King of England before him.\n\nThe Church of Ireland is the second largest church in Ireland and the third largest in Northern Ireland, after the Roman Catholic and Presbyterian churches.\n\nThe reformed Church of Ireland was founded in 1536 when the Irish Parliament accepted Henry VIII as its head, rather than the Pope. In 1155, Adrian IV claimed Ireland as a papal fief and granted Henry II the Lordship of Ireland; in 1541, Henry assumed the title King of Ireland, effectively denying Papal supremacy in Ireland.\nThe Irish Reformation was initially restricted to Dublin, driven by its bishop, George Browne, although when Edward VI succeeded in 1547, the pace of reform in both England and Ireland intensified. Catholicism was restored by Mary I; four bishops had to resign as they were married but the Marian period in Ireland was largely characterised by inertia. \n\nAfter Elizabeth replaced Mary in 1558, only five Irish bishops accepted the 1560 Elizabethan Settlement, leaving the new administration with little alternative but to replace the vast majority. Doing so was complicated by the lack of Irish-speaking clergy and poverty of the Church compared to its Catholic predecessor, while some of those who remained were of relatively low quality. For example, Hugh Curwen backed the reforms of Henry and Edward, returned to Catholicism under Mary who appointed him Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin in 1555, before switching back to the Protestant faith under Elizabeth; he was later charged with moral delinquency by Adam Loftus, Archbishop of Armagh.\n\nThe project to convert the native Irish met with limited success in the 16th century, since '..in order to convert the native Irish, it needed native ministers; but the supply of native ministers was meagre because the native Irish were unconverted.' A gradualist policy was adopted, similar to that used for Catholic areas in Northern England, leading to \"church papist\" clergy and laity. This permitted nominal conformance with the established Church \"whilst continuing to worship...in the traditional, pre-Reformation manner\". Officially abandoned in 1603, the practice of 'occasional conformity' persisted in both England and Ireland well into the mid-18th century. \n\nThe first translation of the New Testament into Irish Gaelic was begun by Nicholas Walsh, Bishop of Ossory. This was continued after his death in 1585 by his assistant, John Kearny, and Nehemiah Donnellan, Archbishop of Tuam, completed by Donnellan's successor William Daniel and printed in 1602. A translation of the Old Testament was prepared by William Bedel, Bishop of Kilmore (1571–1642), but not published until 1685 in a revised version by Narcissus Marsh (1638–1713), Archbishop of Dublin. William Bedell also translated the Book of Common Prayer in 1606, while an Irish version of the revised 1662 prayer book was published in 1712 by John Richardson (1664–1747).\n\nHowever, the Church continued to be largely confined to the English-speaking minority in The Pale; Scots settlers in Ulster were predominantly Presbyterian, while the Irish-speaking majority retained their loyalty to the Holy See. Clergy were imported from England or Scotland, including James Ussher, later Archbishop of Armagh and primarily responsible for the Irish Articles. Similar to the Church of England's Thirty-Nine Articles drawn up by Archbishop Laud, these are more detailed, less ambiguous and often explicitly Calvinist. In 1634, the Irish Parliament adopted Laud's 39 Articles in 1634 but Ussher ensured they were in addition to the Irish Articles, not a replacement. After the Restoration of 1660, the Thirty-Nine Articles were retained and remained the official doctrine of the Church of Ireland even after disestablishment.\n\nThe policy adopted under Charles I claimed the Church of Ireland to be the original and universal church, while the Papacy was an innovation, thus vesting it with the supremacy of Apostolic succession. While Rome naturally disputed this interpretation, advocates included Ussher himself and Charles' former personal chaplain John Leslie, a key supporter of Caroline reforms in Scotland who was appointed bishop of Derry & Raphoe in 1633.\n\nDuring the 1641-1653 Irish Confederate Wars, nearly two-thirds of Ireland was controlled by the largely Catholic Confederacy. In 1644, Giovanni Battista Rinuccini became Papal Nuncio to Ireland; however, the Confederacy also included significant numbers of Royalist members of the Church of Ireland while Irish Catholicism had developed greater tolerance for Protestants and hostility to elaborate ritual. Rinuccini's refusal to compromise with the Church of Ireland and the re-introduction of ceremonies such as foot washing divided the Confederacy and contributed to its rapid collapse in the 1649-1652 Cromwell's re-conquest of Ireland.\n\nAfter the end of the Williamite War in 1691, the Church re-established control; the 1697 Bishop's Banishment Act expelled all Catholic bishops and regular clergy from Ireland, leaving only the so-called secular clergy.\n\nFollowing the legal union of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain by the Act of Union 1800, the Church of Ireland was also united with the Church of England to form the United Church of England and Ireland. At the same time, one archbishop and three bishops from Ireland (selected by rotation) were given seats in the House of Lords at Westminster, joining the two archbishops and twenty-four bishops from the Church of England.\n\nIn 1833, the British Government introduced the Irish Church Temporalities Bill which proposed the administrative and financial restructuring of the church. The bill sought to reduce the number of both bishoprics and archbishoprics from 22 to 12, to change the structure of the leases of church lands and to apply the revenues saved by these changes for the use of parishes. The bill, not only had implications for the future political trajectory of the Whigs and Tories but also sparked the generation of the Oxford Movement, which was to have wide repercussions for the Anglican Communion.\n\nAs the official established church, the Church of Ireland was mainly funded by tithes imposed on all Irish subjects of the Crown. Irrespective of the fact that the adherents of the church were never more than a small minority of the populace, the population at large was expected to pay for its upkeep. Following the defeat of Roman Catholic arms in 1691, no armed resistance was to be expected to this discriminatory policy. Nevertheless, peasant resentment of the tithes occasionally boiled over, as in the \"Tithe War\" of 1831–36. Eventually, the tithes were ended, replaced with a lower levy called the \"tithe rent charge\". The last remnant of the tithes was not abolished until disestablishment in 1871.\n\nThe Irish Church Act 1869 (which took effect on 1 January 1871) finally ended the role of the Church of Ireland as the state church. Disestablishment terminated both state support and parliament's role in its governance, but also took into government ownership much church property. At the establishment of the state church, no compensation had been given to Roman Catholic clergy who suffered loss in the seizure of church property by the state; at its disestablishment, compensation was provided to clergy by the state. On both occasions, parishes faced great difficulty in local financing after the loss of rent-generating lands and buildings. With disestablishment, the church's representation in the House of Lords also ceased.\n\nThe head of the Church of Ireland is, ex officio, the Archbishop of Armagh. In 1870, immediately prior to its disestablishment, the Church provided for its internal government, led by a General Synod, and with financial and administrative support by a Representative Church Body. Like other Irish churches, the Church of Ireland did not divide when Ireland was partitioned in the 1920s and it continues to be governed on an all-Ireland basis.\n\nThe polity of the Church of Ireland is episcopal church governance, as in other Anglican churches. The church maintains the traditional structure dating to pre-Reformation times, a system of geographical parishes organised into dioceses. There were more than 30 of these historically, grouped into four provinces; today, after consolidation over the centuries, there are 12 Church of Ireland dioceses or united dioceses, each headed by a bishop and belonging to one of two surviving provinces. \n\nThe leader of the southern province is the Archbishop of Dublin, at present Michael Jackson; that of the northern province is the Archbishop of Armagh, at present Richard Clarke. These two archbishops are styled Primate of Ireland and Primate of All Ireland respectively, suggesting the ultimate seniority of the latter. Although he has relatively little absolute authority, the Archbishop of Armagh is respected as the church's general leader and spokesman, and is elected in a process different from those for all other bishops.\n\nDoctrine, canon law, church governance, church policy, and liturgical matters are decided by the church's General Synod. The General Synod comprises two Houses, the House of Bishops and the House of Representatives. The House of Bishops includes the 10 diocesan bishops and two archbishops, forming one order. The House of Representatives is made up of two orders, clergy and laity. The order of clergy holds one third of the seats while the laity holds two thirds of the seats. As of 2017, there are 216 clergy members and 432 lay members in the House of Representatives. The membership of the House of Representatives is made up of delegates from the dioceses, with seats allocated to each diocese's clergy and laity in specific numbers; these delegates are elected every three years.\n\nThe General Synod meets annually, and special meetings can be called by the leading bishop or one third of any of its orders. \n\nChanges in policy must be passed by a simple majority of both the House of Bishops and the House of Representatives. Changes to doctrine, for example the decision to ordain women as priests, must be passed by a two thirds majority of both Houses. \n\nThe two Houses sit together for general deliberations but separate for some discussions and for voting. While the House of Representatives always votes publicly, often by orders, the House of Bishops has tended to vote in private, coming to a decision before matters reach the floor of the synod. This practice has been broken only once when, in 1999, the House of Bishops voted unanimously in public to endorse the efforts of the Archbishop of Armagh, the Diocese of Armagh and the Standing Committee of the General Synod in their attempts to resolve the crisis at the Church of the Ascension at Drumcree near Portadown.\n\nThe Church's internal laws are formulated as bills proposed to the Houses of the General Synod, which when passed become Statutes. The Church's governing document, the Constitution, is modified, consolidated and published by way of Statute also, the most recent edition, the 13th, being so published in 2003.\n\nThe Representative Body of the Church of Ireland, often called the \"Representative Church Body\" (RCB), is the corporate trustee of the church, as established by law, and much of the church's property is vested in it. The members of the RCB are the bishops plus diocesan delegates and twelve co-opted members, and it meets at least four times a year. The staff of the Representative Body are analogous to clerical civil servants, and among other duties they oversee property, including church buildings, cemeteries and investments, administer some salaries and pensions, and manage the church library. While parishes, dioceses, and other parts of the church structure care for their particular properties, this is often subject to RCB rules.\n\nThe Church of Ireland embraces three orders of ministry: deacons, priests (or presbyters) and bishops. These orders are distinct from positions such as rector, vicar or canon.\n\nEach diocese or united diocese is led by its Ordinary, one of the ten bishops and two archbishops, and the Ordinary may have one or more Archdeacons to support them, along with a Rural Dean for each group of parishes. There is a Diocescan Synod for each diocese; there may be separate synods for historic dioceses now in unions. These synods comprise the bishop along with clergy and lay representatives from the parishes, and subject to the laws of the Church, and the work of the General Synod and its committees and the Representative Church Body and its committees, oversee the operation of the diocese. Each diocesan synod in turn appoints a Diocesan Council to which it can delegate powers.\n\nEach parish has a presiding member of the clergy, assisted by two churchwardens and often also two glebewardens, one of each type of warden being appointed by the clerical incumbent, and one by popular vote. All qualified adult members of the parish comprise the General Vestry, which meets annually, within 20 days each side of Easter, as the Easter Vestry. There is also a Select Vestry for the parish, or sometimes for each active church in a parish, comprising the presiding cleric and any curate assistants, along with relevant churchwardens and glebewardens and a number of members elected at the Easter Vestry meeting. The Select Vestry assists in the care and operation of the parish and one or more church buildings.\n\nSpecial provisions apply to the management and operation of five key cathedrals, in Dublin, Armagh, Down and Belfast.\n\nThe Church has disciplinary and appeals tribunals, and diocesan courts, and a Court of the General Synod.\n\nThe Church of Ireland experienced a major decline in membership during the 20th century, both in Northern Ireland, where around 65% of its members live, and in the Republic of Ireland. The church is still the second-largest in the Republic of Ireland, with around 126,400 members in 2016 (minus 2% compared to the 2011 census results) and the third-largest in Northern Ireland, with around 260,000 members.\n\nThe Church of Ireland has two cathedrals in Dublin: within the line of the walls of the old city is Christ Church Cathedral, the seat of the Archbishop of Dublin, and just outside the old walls is St. Patrick's Cathedral, which the church designated as the National Cathedral for Ireland in 1870. Cathedrals also exist in the other dioceses. \n\nThe church's central offices are in Rathmines, adjacent to the former Church of Ireland College of Education, and the Church's library is in Churchtown. Teacher training now occurs within the Dublin City University Institute of Education, overseen by the Church of Ireland Centre, based at the former All Hallows College. The church operates a seminary, the Church of Ireland Theological Institute, in Rathgar, in the south inner suburbs of Dublin. \n\nThe Churches of the Anglican Communion are linked by affection and common loyalty. They are in full communion with the See of Canterbury and thus the Archbishop of Canterbury, in his person, is a unique focus of Anglican unity. He calls the once-a-decade Lambeth Conference, chairs the meeting of Primates, and is President of the Anglican Consultative Council. The contemporary Church of Ireland, despite having a number of High Church (often described as Anglo-Catholic) parishes, is generally on the Low Church end of the spectrum of world Anglicanism. Historically, it had little of the difference in organisation between parishes characteristic of other Anglican provinces, although a number of markedly liberal, High Church or Evangelical parishes have developed in recent decades. It was the second province of the Anglican Communion after the Anglican Church of New Zealand (1857) to adopt, on its 1871 disestablishment, synodical government. It was also one of the first provinces to begin ordaining women to the priesthood (1991).\n\nGAFCON Ireland was launched on 21 April 2018, in Belfast, with 320 attendees from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. International speakers included Archbishops Peter Jensen, retired Archbishop of Sydney, and Gregory Venables, Primate of the Anglican Church of South America. The Church of Ireland was represented at GAFCON III, held on 17-22 June 2018 in Jerusalem, by a six-member delegation, which included two bishops, Ferran Glenfield, of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh, and Harold Miller, of Down and Dromore.\n\nLike many other Anglican churches, the Church of Ireland is a member of many ecumenical bodies, including the World Council of Churches, the Conference of European Churches, Churches Together in Britain and Ireland, and the Irish Council of Churches. It is also a member of the Porvoo Communion.\n\nIn 1999, the church voted to prohibit the flying of flags other than St Patrick's flag and the Flag of the Anglican Communion. However, the Union Flag continues to fly on many churches in Northern Ireland.\nThe church has an official website. Its journal is The Church of Ireland Gazette, which is editorially independent, but the governing body of which is appointed by the Church. Many parishes and other internal organizations also produce newsletters or other publications, as well as maintaining websites.\n\nThe centre of the Church of Ireland's teaching is the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The basic teachings of the church include:\n\nThe 16th-century apologist, Richard Hooker, posits that there are three sources of authority in Anglicanism: scripture, tradition and reason. It is not known how widely accepted this idea is within Anglicanism. It is further posited that the three sources uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way. In Hooker's model, scripture is the primary means of arriving at doctrine; things stated plainly in scripture are accepted as true. Issues that are ambiguous are determined by tradition, which is checked by reason.\n\nIn recent decades, the church has ordained women to all offices. In 1990 the church began ordaining women to the priesthood. The first two women ordained were Kathleen Margaret Brown and Irene Templeton. In 2013, the church appointed its first woman bishop, Pat Storey.\n\nThe church has been divided over aspects of human sexuality. In 2002, the issue became pertinent as a vicar provided a blessing for a lesbian couple. The denomination announced a period of discernment to allocate time to the perspectives within the discussion. In 2010, a congregation was recognised by the church for receiving an LGBTI award for offering services for LGBTI people.\n\nCivil partnerships have been allowed since 2005. The church has no official position on civil unions. In 2008, \"the Church of Ireland Pensions Board ha[d] confirmed that it will treat civil partners the same as spouses.\" In 2011, a cleric in the Church of Ireland entered into a same-sex civil partnership with his bishop's permission. Assurances of sexual abstinence were not required from the cleric. In 2012, the church's Clergy Pension Fund continued to recognise that \"the pension entitlement of a member's registered civil partner will be the same as that of a surviving spouse.\" Regarding cohabitation, the church said that \"any view of cohabitation has to be the intention of the couple to lifelong loyalty and faithfulness within their relationship.\" The church recognises four general viewpoints within the denomination ranging from opposition to acceptance toward same-gender relationships.\n\nPrior to the referendum on same-sex marriage, the church remained neutral on the issue. In 2015, the Bishop of Cork, the Rt. Rev. Paul Colton, Bishop Michael Burrows of Cashel, and two retired archbishops of Dublin endorsed same-sex marriage. While voting \"no\" on gay marriage, Bishop Pat Storey endorsed civil unions. Also, 55 clergy signed a letter supporting the blessing of same-sex couples. In its pastoral letter, the church reiterated that, presently, church marriages are only for heterosexual couples, but that clergy may offer prayers for same-sex couples. When asked about clergy entering into civil same-sex marriages, the letter stated that \"all are free to exercise their democratic entitlements once they are enshrined in legislation. However, members of the clergy, are further bound by the Ordinal and by the authority of the General Synod of the Church of Ireland.\" Services of Thanksgiving for same-sex marriage have taken place in congregations; for example, St. Audoen's Church hosted \"a service of thanksgiving\" for same-sex marriage. LGBTI services are also allowed by the Diocese of Cork, Cloyne and Ross.\n\nREFORM Ireland, a conservative lobby, has criticised the official letter as \"a dangerous departure from confessing Anglicanism\" and continues to oppose same-sex marriage recognition. Reflecting division, the church deferred its report on same-sex marriage to listen to all voices. \"The Church of Ireland Gazette\", although \"editorially independent\", endorsed a blessing rite for same-sex couples. Many congregations, including cathedrals, have become publicly affirming of LGBTI rights. A church report has determined that \"the moral logic underpinning the negative portrayal of same-sex eroticism in Scripture does not directly address committed, loving, consecrated same-sex relationships today\". In 2017, the General Synod considered a proposal to request for public services of thanksgiving for same-sex couples, but the proposal was not passed; the church's select committee on human sexuality recommended that the bishops continue to study the issues. There were 176 votes against the motion to request public services, 146 in favour, and 24 abstentions. The Bishop of Cork, Paul Colton, declared his support for same-sex marriages in the Church of Ireland.\n\nThe first translation of the Book of Common Prayer into Irish was published in 1606. An Irish translation of the revised prayer book of 1662 was published in 1712.\n\nThe Church of Ireland has its own Irish language body, \"Cumann Gaelach na hEaglaise\" (\"Irish Guild of the Church\" - www.gaeleaglais.ie). This was founded in 1914 to bring together members of the Church of Ireland interested in the Irish language and Gaelic culture and to promote the Irish language within the Church of Ireland. The guild aims to link its programmes with the Irish language initiatives which have been centred round Christ Church Cathedral. It holds services twice a month in Irish.\n\nFrom 1926 to 1995, the church had its own Irish-language teacher training college, \"Coláiste Moibhí\". Today, there are a number of interdenominational \"Gaelscoileanna\" (schools where Irish-medium education is applied).\n\n\n\n\n"}

Through this, Guatemala gave the education of Guatemalan people to regular orders Catholic Church, committed to respect ecclesiastical property and monasteries, imposed mandatory tithing and allowed the bishops to censor what was published in the country; in return, Guatemala received dispensations for the members of the army, allowed those who had acquired the properties that the Liberals had expropriated the Church in 1829 to keep those properties, perceived taxes generated by the properties of the Church, and had the right to judge certain crimes committed by clergy under Guatemalan law.

Criminon International, a non-profit, public-benefit corporation managing the Criminon program, was spawned from Narconon International in 2000, and is part of Association for Better Living and Education's public outreach programs. Criminon is promoted by the Church of Scientology International. Independent experts contend that methods used by the program are not supported by any scientific studies.\n\nSecond Chance, another prison-based rehabilitation program for inmates, is closely related to Criminon, from which it licenses the techniques and materials used in its program.\n\nCriminon is said to be a prison-based version of Narconon, as the Purification Rundown detoxification and training procedures are a part of both programs.\n\nThe program has used correspondence materials to treat hundreds of prisoners at the high security California State Prison, Corcoran, beginning in 1990. Criminon is administered by the Association for Better Living and Education (ABLE), a nonprofit organization that administers Criminon, Narconon, and other \"social betterment\" programs.\n\nThe program includes courses with questions requiring written answers. The responses are evaluated by volunteers and the materials are donated, so the program is provided free to the state. Included in one pamphlet is an essay in which Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard writes, \"There is not one institutional psychiatrist alive who by ordinary criminal law could not be arraigned and convicted of extortion, mayhem, or murder.\"\n\nHubbard's 1981 booklet, \"The Way to Happiness\", is an integral part of the program, setting forth precepts such as \"Do not take harmful drugs\", \"Be faithful to your sexual partner\", \"Do not tell harmful lies\", \"Don't do anything illegal\", \"Do not steal\", and \"Do not murder\".\n\nCriminon is also available under the name Second Chance, which licenses the Criminon materials.\n\nSome critics question the long-term success of Criminon's program citing a lack of independent, peer-reviewed studies. As Criminon's website notes, the core of the prison program is the booklet \"The Way to Happiness\".\n\nIn 1997, Judge Stephen Rushing, a Pinellas County, Florida, judge, received criticism and raised eyebrows from other judges when he began sentencing defendants to a program called \"Impulse Control\" that was run by Criminon. Rushing said the people running the course promised they would not try to convert anyone. However the paper noted that many critics have suggested that Criminon was being used as a recruiting tool. Rushing stated that if the program turned out to be nothing but a ploy to promote Scientology, \"I owe an apology to the people I put in that program.\"\n\nCriminon has also been criticized for promoting Scientology's hostile view of psychiatry. A Criminon instruction manual found at California's Corcoran Prison in 2005 instructs the supervisors who are supposed to be helping the inmates to encourage them to stop taking any psychiatric medication. \"Most jails and prisons have a staff psychiatrist that goes in daily and gives dosages of various and sundry mind-altering drugs to the inmates. Most of the time this is a ploy to keep the inmates sedated so that they don't cause trouble\", the manual stated. While Criminon claimed that this manual was \"outdated\", the replacement manual still advised that if inmates seemed angry, it may be because \"some of them are on psychiatric drugs and have strange side effects as a result.\" Professor Stephen A. Kent said that Scientology's goal \"is to destroy psychiatry and replace it with Scientology's own treatments. Criminon is simply one of many Scientology organizations that hope to see this goal realized.\"\n\nIn 2006, in New Mexico, government funding for the Second Chance program was cut when information on the program and its connections came to light.\n\nThen-Nevada assembly member Sharron Angle supported the use of \"Second Chance Program\" in 2003. Angle sponsored legislation aimed at placing this program in women's prisons in Nevada.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "602068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=602068", "title": "Cynocephaly", "text": "Cynocephaly\n\nThe characteristic of cynocephaly, or cynocephalus (), having the head of a dog—or of a jackal—is a widely attested mythical phenomenon existing in many different forms and contexts. The literal meaning of \"cynocephaly\" is \"dog-headed\"; however, that this refers to a human body with a dog head is implied. Often, such creatures also have human intelligence. Such cynocephalics are known in mythology and legend from many parts of the world, including ancient Egypt, Greece, and China. Further mentions come from the medieval East and Europe. In modern popular culture cynocephalics are also encountered as characters in books, comics, and graphic novels. Cynocephaly is generally distinguished from lycanthropy (werewolfism) and dogs that can talk.\n\nThe word \"cynocephaly\" is taken (through Latin) from the Greek word κῠνοκέφᾰλοι \"kynokephaloi\", from \"kyno–\" (combining form of κύων \"kyōn\") meaning \"dog\" and κεφαλή \"kephalē\" meaning \"head\".\n\nThe same \"dog\" root is found in the name \"Cynomorpha\" (\"dog-shaped\") for a sub-group of the family Cercopithecidae, which contains many species of macaques and baboons.\n\nCynocephaly was familiar to the ancient Greeks from representations of the Egyptian gods, Duamutef (Son of Horus), Wepwawet (The opener of the ways), and Anubis (the Egyptian god of the dead). The Greek word \"()\" \"dog-head\" also identified a sacred Egyptian baboon with the face of a dog.\n\nReports of dog-headed races can also be traced back to Greek antiquity. In the fifth century BC, the Greek physician Ctesias, in his Indica, wrote a detailed report on the existence of cynocephali in India. Similarly, the Greek traveller Megasthenes claimed to know about dog-headed people in India who lived in the mountains, communicated through barking, wore the skins of wild animals and lived by hunting.\nHerodotus reports claims by ancient Libyans that such creatures inhabit the east of their lands, as well as headless men and various other anomalies.\n\nThe best estimate for the place where the battle between the Argonauts and the Cynocephali took place is modern day North Serbia, or South Hungary.\n\nThe cynocephali offered such an evocative image of the magic and brutality deemed characteristic of bizarre people of distant places that they kept returning in medieval literature. Augustine of Hippo mentioned the cynocephali in \"The City of God\", Book XVI, Chapter 8, in the context of discussing whether such beings were descendants of Adam; he considered the possibility that they might not exist at all, or might not be human (which Augustine defines as being a mortal and rational animal: \"homo, id est animal rationale mortale\"), but insisted that if they were human they were indeed descendants of Adam.\n\nCynocephali also figure in medieval Christian world-views. A legend that placed St. Andrew and St. Bartholomew among the Parthians presented the case of \"Abominable\", the citizen of the \"city of cannibals... whose face was like unto that of a dog.\" After receiving baptism, however, he was released from his doggish aspect.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, certain icons covertly identify Saint Christopher with the head of a dog. The background to the dog-headed Christopher is laid in the reign of the Emperor Diocletian, when a man named \"Reprebus\", \"Rebrebus\" or \"Reprobus\" (the \"reprobate\" or \"scoundrel\") was captured in combat against tribes dwelling to the west of Egypt in Cyrenaica. To the unit of soldiers, according to the hagiographic narrative, was assigned the name \"numerus Marmaritarum\" or \"Unit of the Marmaritae\", which suggests an otherwise-unidentified \"Marmaritae\" (perhaps the same as the Marmaricae Berber tribe of Cyrenaica). He was reported to be of enormous size, with the head of a dog instead of a man, apparently a characteristic of the Marmaritae. This Byzantine depiction of St. Christopher as dog-headed resulted from their misinterpretation of the Latin term Cananeus (Canaanite) to read canineus, that is, \"canine\". \n\nThe German bishop and poet Walter of Speyer portrayed St. Christopher as a giant of a cynocephalic species in the land of the Chananeans (Canaan in the New Testament) who ate human flesh and barked. Eventually, Christopher met the Christ child, regretted his former behavior, and received baptism. He, too, was rewarded with a human appearance, whereupon he devoted his life to Christian service and became an athlete of God, one of the soldier-saints. There are some rare icons that depict this martyr with the head of a dog. Such images may carry echoes of the Egyptian dog-headed god, Anubis. Christopher pictured with a dog's head is not generally supported by the Orthodox Church, as the icon was proscribed in the 18th century by Moscow.\n\nIbn Battuta encountered dog-mouthed people on his journey, in an island somewhere between India and Sumatra:\nPaul the Deacon mentions cynocephali in his \"Historia gentis Langobardorum\": \"They pretend that they have in their camps Cynocephali, that is, men with dogs' heads. They spread the rumor among the enemy that these men wage war obstinately, drink human blood and quaff their own gore if they cannot reach the foe.\" At the court of Charlemagne the Norse were given this attribution, implying un-Christian and less-than-human qualities: \"I am greatly saddened\" said the King of the Franks, in Notker's \"Life\", \"that I have not been thought worthy to let my Christian hand sport with these dog-heads.\" The ninth-century Frankish theologian Ratramnus wrote a letter, the \"Epistola de Cynocephalis\", on whether the Cynocephali should be considered human (he thought that they were). If human, a Christian's duty would be to preach the Gospels to them. If animals, and thus without souls, such would be pointless. Quoting St. Jerome, Thomas of Cantimpré corroborated the existence of Cynocephali in his \"Liber de Monstruosis Hominibus Orientis\", xiv, (\"Book of Monstrous men of the Orient\"). The thirteenth-century encyclopedist Vincent of Beauvais acquainted his patron Saint Louis IX of France with \"an animal with the head of the dog but with all other members of human appearance… Though he behaves like a man… and, when peaceful, he is tender like a man, when furious, he becomes cruel and retaliates on humankind\".\n\nThe Nowell Codex, perhaps more commonly known as the manuscript containing the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf, also contains references to Cynocephali. One such reference can be found in the part of the manuscript known as The Wonders of the East, in which they are called \"healfhundingas\" or \"half-dogs.\" Also, in Anglo-Saxon England, the Old English word \"wulfes heafod\" (\"wolf's head\") was a technical term for an outlaw, who could be killed as if he were a wolf. The so-called \"Leges Edwardi Confessoris\", written around 1140, however, offered a somewhat literal interpretation: “[6.2a] For from the day of his outlawry he bears a wolf's head, which is called \"wluesheued\" by the English. [6.2b] And this sentence is the same for all outlaws.” Cynocephali appear in the Old Welsh poem \"Pa Gur?\" as \"cinbin\" (dogheads). Here they are enemies of King Arthur's retinue; Arthur's men fight them in the mountains of \"Eidyn\" (Edinburgh), and hundreds of them fall at the hand of Arthur's warrior Bedwyr (later known as Bedivere). The next lines of the poem also mention a fight with a character named Garwlwyd (Rough-Gray); a Gwrgi Garwlwyd (Man-Dog Rough-Gray) appears in one of the Welsh Triads, where he is described in such a way that scholars have discussed him as a werewolf.\n\nMedieval travellers Giovanni da Pian del Carpine and Marco Polo both mention cynocephali. Giovanni writes of the armies of Ogedei Khan who encounter a race of dogheads who live north of the Dalai-Nor (Northern Ocean), or Lake Baikal. Polo's \"Travels\" mentions the dog-headed barbarians on the island of Angamanain, or the Andaman Islands. For Polo, although these people grow spices, they are nonetheless cruel and \"are all just like big mastiff dogs\".\n\nAccording to Henri Cordier, the source of all the fables of the dog-headed barbarians, whether European, Arabic, or Chinese, can be found in the Alexander Romance.\n\nIn his feature, \"Giant Egg\", David Attenborough speculates that indri, a type of lemur from Madagascar, may be one possible origin to the myth of dog-headed men.\n\nIn Central and East Asia a common calendar system consists of a twelve year cycle, with each year represented as an animal. The eleventh animal of the twelve year cycle is the dog. Often such animals are depicted as human figures with an animal head. Thus, the cynocephalic depiction of the eleventh zodiac animal is common (possibly with a tail).\n\nAdditionally, in the Chinese record \"History of the Liang Dynasty\" (\"Liang Shu\"), the Buddhist missionary Huisheng (慧生) describes an island of dog-headed men to the east of Fusang, a nation he visited variously identified as Japan or the Americas. The \"History of Northern Dynasties\" of Li Yanshou (李延寿), a Tang dynasty historian, also mentions the 'dog kingdom'.\n\nThe use of dog-headed, human-bodied characters is still very strong in modern literature. In the domain of comics publishing in North America and in Europe many works feature an \"all-cynocephalic\" cast or use the heads of dogs and other animals together for social comment or other purposes.\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the Iranian physicist and historian Zakariya Qazvini, King Vishtaspa had been a patron of Zoroaster who planted the tree himself. In his cosmology, he further describes how the Abbasid Caliph Al-Mutawakkil in 247 AH (861 AD) caused the mighty cypress to be felled, and then transported it across Iran, to be used for beams in his new palace at Samarra. Before, he wanted the tree to be reconstructed before his eyes. This was done in spite of protests by the Iranians, who offered a very high sum of money to save the tree. Mutawakkil never saw the cypress, because he was murdered by a Turkish soldier (possibly in the employ of his son) on the night when it arrived on the banks of the Tigris.\n\n"}

A popular worship attraction, it often features performances by resident Thai dance troupes, who are hired by worshippers in return for seeing their prayers at the shrine answered.\n\nOn 17 August 2015, a bomb exploded near the shrine, killing 20 and injuring 125 more.\n\nThe shrine is by the Grand Hyatt Erawan Hotel, at the Ratchaprasong intersection of Ratchadamri Road in Pathum Wan district. It is near the Bangkok Skytrain's Chitlom Station, which has an elevated walkway overlooking the shrine. The area has many shopping malls nearby, including Gaysorn, CentralWorld and Amarin Plaza.\n\nFive other shrines dedicated to Hindu deities are located in the area as well: Phra Laksami (Lakshmi), Phra Trimurati (Trimurti), Phra Khanet (Ganesha), Phra In (Indra), and Phra Narai Song Suban (Narayana on his garuda).\n\nThe Erawan Shrine was built in 1956 as part of the government-owned Erawan Hotel to eliminate the bad karma believed caused by laying the foundations on the wrong date.\n\nThe hotel's construction was delayed by a series of mishaps, including cost overruns, injuries to laborers, and the loss of a shipload of Italian marble intended for the building. Furthermore, the Ratchaprasong intersection had once been used to put criminals on public display.\n\nAn astrologer advised building the shrine to counter the negative influences. The Brahma statue was designed and built by the Department of Fine Arts and enshrined on 9 November 1956. The hotel's construction thereafter proceeded without further incident. In 1987, the hotel was demolished and the site used for the Grand Hyatt Erawan Hotel.\n\nIn the early hours of 21 March 2006, the shrine was vandalised by a Thai man who destroyed the statue with a hammer. The vandal, 27-year-old Thanakorn Pakdeepol, was then beaten to death by angry bystanders. Two street sweepers who worked for the Pathum Wan District office were arrested and charged with the fatal beating.\n\nWitnesses said Thanakorn stood on the base of the statue with a large hammer in his hands, and smashed the hollow statue of Brahma to pieces. The deity's four-faced head, torso, six arms and weapons were fragmented. Only part of the lap and base of the statue were left intact. The incident occurred at about 01:00.\n\nDuring the autopsy of Thanakorn Pakdeepol, doctors found Arabic characters tattooed on his back and arms, prompting police to investigate if the attack had a religious motive and if the vandal or his family had ties to Muslim extremists. However, the vandal's father, Sayant Pakdeepol, said his son had received treatment for psychiatric problems and that mental illness was the cause of the attack. Sayant described the fatal beating of his son as an \"overreaction\". \"Doing something like this is not the act of people with good beliefs, of those with real faith in Brahma\", Sayyant told \"The Nation\" newspaper. \"Murder is an immoral act and people with morality would not have done what they did\".\n\nIn the days immediately after the destruction of the Erawan Shrine, then Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra visited and paid his respects to the broken fragments of the Hindu deity. A white cloth was used to conceal the absence of the statue. Officials later reopened the site to the public, displaying photographs of the statue so worshippers could pay their respects.\n\nAt an anti-Thaksin rally on the following day, government critic Sondhi Limthongkul charged the destruction of the statue was a plot by the admittedly superstitious Thaksin to maintain his political power through black magic. However, Thanakorn's father rejected the claim, telling \"The Nation\" that Sondhi \"is the biggest liar I have ever seen.\" When asked to comment the accusation, Thaksin simply replied, \"That's insane.\"\n\nA new Brahma statue was placed in the shrine on 21 May 2006 at 11:39, the moment the sun was directly above the shrine. Officials with the Religious Affairs Department and the Maha Brahma Foundation said it was made of plaster, mixed with a mixture of gold, bronze and other precious metals, along with fragments of the original statue. Another duplicate statue, made entirely of metal, was cast in the same mold, and is kept in the national museum.\n\nOn 17 August 2015, at 18:55 local time, an explosive device composed of three kilograms of TNT stuffed in a metal pipe and wrapped in white cloth inside a backpack, detonated near Erawan Shrine, killing 20 people and injuring 125. Bomb disposal units checked two suspicious objects but found no other bombs. As of 26 August, no one has claimed responsibility for the act and the investigation is ongoing. The bombing is suspected to have been carried out by the Pan-Turkic Turkish ultra-nationalist organization Grey Wolves in retaliation for Thailand's deportation of Uyghur terrorist suspects back to China instead of allowing them to travel to Turkey for asylum.\n\nThe bomb was placed in the shrine grounds next to a metal railing. The statue was slightly damaged. Within two days all repairs had been completed and the shrine reopened. Rather than being commended for the swift reopening of the shrine, the government's actions have been subject to criticism. The government's perceived lack of progress in the investigation has stimulated critics to propose a number of theories as to who is responsible for the bombing, including elements of the government itself.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "165123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=165123", "title": "Hannes Alfvén", "text": "Hannes Alfvén\n\nHannes Olof Gösta Alfvén (; 30 May 1908 – 2 April 1995) was a Swedish electrical engineer, plasma physicist and winner of the 1970 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). He described the class of MHD waves now known as Alfvén waves. He was originally trained as an electrical power engineer and later moved to research and teaching in the fields of plasma physics and electrical engineering. Alfvén made many contributions to plasma physics, including theories describing the behavior of aurorae, the Van Allen radiation belts, the effect of magnetic storms on the Earth's magnetic field, the terrestrial magnetosphere, and the dynamics of plasmas in the Milky Way galaxy.\n\nAlfvén received his PhD from the University of Uppsala in 1934. His thesis was titled \"Investigations of High-frequency Electromagnetic Waves.\"\n\nIn 1934, Alfvén taught physics at both the University of Uppsala and the Nobel Institute for Physics (later renamed the Manne Siegbahn Institute of Physics) in Stockholm, Sweden. In 1940, he became professor of electromagnetic theory and electrical measurements at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. In 1945, he acquired the nonappointive position of Chair of Electronics. His title was changed to Chair of Plasma Physics in 1963. From 1954 to 1955, Alfvén was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Maryland, College Park. In 1967, after leaving Sweden and spending time in the Soviet Union, he moved to the United States. Alfvén worked in the departments of electrical engineering at both the University of California, San Diego and the University of Southern California.\n\nIn 1991, Alfvén retired as professor of electrical engineering at the University of California, San Diego and professor of plasma physics at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.\n\nAlfvén spent his later adult life alternating between California and Sweden. He died at the age of 86.\n\nIn 1937, Alfvén argued that if plasma pervaded the universe, it could then carry electric currents capable of generating a galactic magnetic field. After winning the Nobel Prize for his works in magnetohydrodynamics, he emphasized that: \n\nIn order to understand the phenomena in a certain plasma region, it is necessary to map not only the magnetic but also the electric field and the electric currents. Space is filled with a network of currents which transfer energy and momentum over large or very large distances. The currents often pinch to filamentary or surface currents. The latter are likely to give space, as also interstellar and intergalactic space, a cellular structure.\n\nHis theoretical work on field-aligned electric currents in the aurora (based on earlier work by Kristian Birkeland) was confirmed in 1967, these currents now being known as Birkeland currents.\n\nAlfvén's work was disputed for many years by the senior scientist in space physics, the British mathematician and geophysicist Sydney Chapman. Alfvén's disagreements with Chapman stemmed in large part from trouble with the peer review system. Alfvén rarely benefited from the acceptance generally afforded senior scientists in scientific journals. He once submitted a paper on the theory of magnetic storms and auroras to the American journal \"Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity\" only to have his paper rejected on the ground that it did not agree with the theoretical calculations of conventional physics of the time. He was regarded as a person with unorthodox opinions in the field by many physicists, R. H. Stuewer noting that \"... he remained an embittered outsider, winning little respect from other scientists even after he received the Nobel Prize...\" and was often forced to publish his papers in obscure journals. Alfvén recalled:\n\nWhen I describe [plasma phenomena] according to this formalism most referees do not understand what I say and turn down my papers. With the referee system which rules US science today, this means that my papers are rarely accepted by the leading US journals.\n\nAlfvén played a central role in the development of:\n\n\nIn 1939, Alfvén proposed the theory of magnetic storms and auroras and the theory of plasma dynamics in the earth's magnetosphere. This was the paper rejected by the U.S. journal \"Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity\".\n\nApplications of Alfvén's research in space science include:\n\n\nAlfvén's views followed those of the founder of magnetospheric physics, Kristian Birkeland. At the end of the nineteenth century, Birkeland proposed (backed by extensive data) that electric currents flowing down along the Earth's magnetic fields into the atmosphere caused the aurora and polar magnetic disturbances.\n\nAreas of technology benefiting from Alfvén's contributions include:\n\n\nContributions to astrophysics:\n\n\nAlfvén waves (low frequency hydromagnetic plasma oscillations) are named in his honor. Many of his theories about the solar system were verified as late as the 1980s through external measurements of cometary and planetary magnetospheres. But Alfvén himself noted that astrophysical textbooks poorly represented known plasma phenomena: \n\nA study of how a number of the most used textbooks in astrophysics treat important concepts such as double layers, critical velocity, pinch effects, and circuits is made. It is found that students using these textbooks remain essentially ignorant of even the existence of these concepts, despite the fact that some of them have been well known for half a century (e.g, double layers, Langmuir, 1929; pinch effect, Bennet, 1934).\n\nAlfvén reported that of 17 of the most used textbooks on astrophysics, none mention the pinch effect, none mentioned critical ionization velocity, only two mentioned circuits, and three mentioned double layers.\n\nAlfvén believed the problem with the Big Bang was that astrophysicists tried to extrapolate the origin of the universe from mathematical theories developed on the blackboard, rather than starting from known observable phenomena. He also considered the Big Bang to be a myth devised to explain creation. Alfvén and colleagues proposed the Alfvén–Klein model as an alternative cosmological theory to both the Big Bang and steady state theory cosmologies.\n\nAlfvén had a good sense of humor, and he participated in a variety of social issues and worldwide disarmament movements. He had a long-standing distrust of computers. Alfvén studied the history of science, oriental philosophy, and religion. On his religious views, Alfven was irreligious and critical of religion. He spoke Swedish, English, German, French, and Russian, and some Spanish and Chinese. He expressed great concern about the difficulties of permanent high-level radioactive waste management.\" Alfvén was also interested in problems in cosmology and all aspects of auroral physics, and used Schröder's well known book on aurora, \"Das Phänomen des Polarlichts\". Letters of Alfvén, Treder, and Schröder were published on the occasion of Treder's 70th birthday. The relationships between Hans-Jürgen Treder, Hannes Alfvén and Wilfried Schröder were discussed in detail by Schröder in his publications.\n\nAlfvén was married for 67 years to his wife Kerstin (1910–1992). They raised five children, one boy and four girls. His son became a physician, while one daughter became a writer and another a lawyer in Sweden. The composer Hugo Alfvén was Hannes Alfvén's uncle.\n\nThe Hannes Alfvén Prize, awarded annually by the European Physical Society for outstanding contributions in plasma physics, is named after him. The asteroid 1778 Alfvén is named in his honour.\n\n\nAlfvén was one of the few scientists who was a foreign member of both the United States and Soviet Academies of Sciences.\n\nFor full list of publications see.\n\n\n\n"}

Many museums are sending human remains belonging to native peoples of other countries back for reburial. Where British remains are concerned, it is difficult to prove direct ancestry, nor is there coherence of religious belief through time connecting the ancient dead with the living. However, Honouring the Ancient Dead is challenging museums, curators and scientists to consider the British dead in a new light and to treat all remains with respect. The debate over human remains ranges widely with the needs of science, specific cultures, and the bones themselves under consideration.

{"id": "411844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=411844", "title": "Indigenous music of North America", "text": "Indigenous music of North America\n\nIndigenous music of North America, which includes American Indian music or Native American music, is the \nmusic that is used, created or performed by Indigenous peoples of North America, including Native Americans in the United States and Aboriginal peoples in Canada, Indigenous peoples of Mexico, and other North American countries—especially traditional tribal music, such as Pueblo music and Inuit music. In addition to the traditional music of the Native American groups, there now exist pan-tribal and intertribal genres as well as distinct Native American subgenres of popular music including: rock, blues, hip hop, classical, film music, and reggae, as well as unique popular styles like chicken scratch and New Mexico music.\n\nSinging and percussion are the most important aspects of traditional Native American music. Vocalization takes many forms, ranging from solo and choral song to responsorial, unison and multipart singing. Percussion, especially drums and rattles, are common accompaniment to keep the rhythm steady for the singers, who generally use their native language or non-lexical vocables (nonsense syllables). Traditional music usually begins with slow and steady beats that grow gradually faster and more emphatic, while various flourishes like drum and rattle tremolos, shouts and accented patterns add variety and signal changes in performance for singers and dancers.\n\nNative American song texts include both public pieces and secret songs, said to be \"ancient and unchanging\", which are used for only sacred and ceremonial purposes. There are also public sacred songs, as well as ritual speeches that are sometimes perceived as musical because of their use of rhythm and melody. These ritual speeches often directly describe the events of a ceremony, and the reasons and ramifications of the night.\n\nVocables, or lexically meaningless syllables, are a common part of many kinds of Native American songs. They frequently mark the beginning and end of phrases, sections or songs themselves. Often songs make frequent use of vocables and other untranslatable elements. Songs that are translatable include historical songs, like the Navajo \"Shi' naasha', which celebrates the end of Navajo internment in Fort Sumner, New Mexico in 1868. Tribal flag songs and national anthems are also a major part of the Native American musical corpus, and are a frequent starter to public ceremonies, especially powwows. Native American music also includes a range of courtship songs, dancing songs and popular American or Canadian tunes like \"Amazing Grace, \"Dixie\", \"Jambalaya\" and \"Sugar Time\". Many songs celebrate harvest, planting season or other important times of year.\n\nNative American music plays a vital role in history and education, with ceremonies and stories orally passing on ancestral customs to new generations. Native American ceremonial music is traditionally said to originate from deities or spirits, or from particularly respected individuals. Rituals are shaped by every aspect of song, dance and costuming, and each aspect informs about the \"makers, wearers and symbols important to the nation, tribe, village, clan, family, or individual\". Native Americans perform stories through song, music and dance, and the historical facts thus propagated are an integral part of Native American beliefs. Epic legends and stories about culture heroes are a part of tribal music traditions, and these tales are often an iconic part of local culture. They can vary slightly from year to year, with leaders recombining and introducing slight variations. The Pueblo compose a number of new songs each year in a committee which uses dreams and visions.\n\nThe styles and purposes of music vary greatly between and among each Native American tribe. However, a common concept amongst many indigenous groups is a conflation of music and power. For example, the Pima people feel many of their songs were given in the beginning and sung by the Creator. It was believed that some people then have more of an inclination to musical talent than others because of an individual's peculiar power.\n\nWithin various Native American communities, gender plays an important role in music. Men and women play sex-specific roles in many musical activities. Instruments, songs and dances are often peculiar to one or the other sex, and many musical settings are strictly controlled by sex. In modern powwows, women play a vital role as backup singers and dancers. The Cherokee people, for example, hold dances before stickball games. At these pre-game events, men and women perform separate dances and follow separate regulations. Men will dance in a circle around a fire, while women dance in place. Men sing their own songs, while women have their songs sung for them by an elder. Whereas the men's songs invoke power, the women's songs draw power away from the opposing stickball team. In some societies, there are customs where certain ceremonial drums are to be played by men only. For the Southern Plains Indians, it is believed that the first drum was given to a woman by the Great Spirit, who instructed her to share it with all women of native nations. However, there also exist prohibitions against women sitting at the Beg Drum.\n\nMany tribal music cultures have a relative paucity of traditional women's songs and dances, especially in the Northeast and Southeast regions. The Southeast is, however, home to a prominent women's musical tradition in the use of leg rattles for ceremonial stomp and friendship dances, and the women's singing during Horse and Ball Game contests. The West Coast tribes of North America tend to more prominence in women's music, with special women's love songs, medicine songs and handgame songs; the Southwest is particularly diverse in women's musical offerings, with major ceremonial, instrumental and social roles in dances. Women also play a vital ceremonial role in the Sun Dance of the Great Plains and Great Basin, and sing during social dances. Shoshone women still sang the songs of the Ghost Dance into the 1980s.\n\nMusic and history are tightly interwoven in Native American life. A tribe's history is constantly told and retold through music, which keeps alive an oral narrative of history. These historical narratives vary widely from tribe to tribe and are an integral part of tribal identity. However, their historical authenticity cannot be verified; aside from supposition and some archaeological evidence, the earliest documentation of Native American music came with the arrival of European explorers. Musical instruments and pictographs depicting music and dance have been dated as far back as the 7th century.\n\nBruno Nettl refers to the style of the Great Basin area as the oldest style and common throughout the entire continent before Mesoamerica but continued in only the Great Basin and in the lullaby, gambling, and tale genres around the continent. A style featuring relaxed vocal technique and the rise may have originated in Mesoamerican Mexico and spread northward, particularly into the California-Yuman and Eastern music areas. According to Nettl, these styles also feature \"relative\" rhythmic simplicity in drumming and percussion, with isometric material and pentatonic scales in the singing, and motives created from shorter sections into longer ones.\n\nWhile this process occurred, three Asian styles may have influenced North American music across the Bering Strait, all featuring pulsating vocal technique and possibly evident in recent Paleo-Siberian tribes such as Chuckchee, Yukaghir, Koryak. Also, these may have influenced the Plains-Pueblo, Athabascan, and Inuit-Northwest Coast areas. According to Nettl, the boundary between these southward and the above northward influences are the areas of greatest musical complexity: the Northwest Coast, Pueblo music, and Navajo music. Evidence of influences between the Northwest Coast and Mexico are indicated, for example, by bird-shaped whistles. The Plains-Pueblo area has influenced and continues to influence the surrounding cultures, with contemporary musicians of all tribes learning Plains-Pueblo-influenced pantribal genres such as Peyote songs.\n\nNettl uses the following music areas which approximately coincide with Wissler, Kroeber, and Driver's cultural areas: Inuit-Northwest coast, Great Basin, California-Yuman, Plains-Pueblo, Athabascan, and Eastern.\n\nNative Americans of the Southwestern United States were limited to idiophones and aerophones as mediums to sound production beginning date in the seventh century. The applicable idiophones included: plank resonators, footed drums, percussion stones, shaken idiophones, vessel rattles, and copper and clay bells. The applicable aerophones included bullroarers, decomposable whistles and flutes, clay resonator whistles, shell trumpets and prehistoric reed instruments. The wood flute was of particular significance. \n\nArid American Southwest is home to two broad groupings of closely related cultures, the Pueblo and Athabaskan. The Southern Athabaskan Navajo and Apache tribes sing in Plains-style nasal vocals with unblended monophony, while the Pueblos emphasize a relaxed, low range and highly blended monophonic style. Athabaskan songs are swift and use drums or rattles, as well as an instrument unique to this area, the Apache fiddle, or \"Tsii'edo'a'tl\" meaning \"wood that sings\" in the Apache language.\n\nPueblo songs are complex and meticulously detailed, usually with five sections divided into four or more phrases characterized by detailed introductory and cadential formulas. They are much slower in tempo than Athabaskan songs, and use various percussion instruments as accompaniment.\n\nNettl describes Pueblo music, including Hopi, Zuni, Taos Pueblo, San Ildefonso Pueblo, Santo Domingo Pueblo, and many others, as one of the most complex on the continent, featuring increased length and number of scale tones (hexatonic and heptatonic common), variety of form, melodic contour, and percussive accompaniment, ranges between an octave and a twelfth, with rhythmic complexity equal to the Plains sub-area. He sites the Kachina dance songs as the most complex songs and Hopi and Zuni material as the most complex of the Pueblo, while Tanoan and Keresan music is simpler and intermediate between the Plains and western Pueblos. The music of the Pima and Tohono O'odham is intermediary between the Plains-Pueblo and the California-Yuman music areas, with melodic movement of the Yuman, though including the rise, and the form and rhythm of the Pueblo.\n\nHe describes Southern Athabascan music, that of the Apache and Navajo, as the simplest next to the Great Basin style, featuring strophic form, tense vocals using pulsation and falsetto, tritonic and tetratonic scales in triad formation, simple rhythms and values of limited duration (usually only two per song), arc-type melodic contours, and large melodic intervals with a predominance of major and minor thirds and perfect fourths and fifths with octave leaps not rare. Peyote songs share characteristics of Apache music and Plains-Pueblo music having been promoted among the Plains by the Apache people.\n\nHe describes the structural characteristics of California-Yuman music, including that of Pomo, Miwak, Luiseno, Catalineno, and Gabrielino, and the Yuman tribes, including, Mohave, Yuman, Havasupai, Maricopa, as using the rise in almost all songs, a relaxed nonpulsating vocal technique (like European classical music), a relatively large amount of isorhythmic material, some isorhythmic tendencies, simple rhythms, pentatonic scales without semitones, an average melodic range of an octave, sequence, and syncopated figures such as a sixteenth-note, eight-note, sixteenth-note figure. The form of rise used varies throughout the area, usually being rhythmically related to the preceding non-rise section but differing in melodic material or pitch. The rise may be no higher than the highest pitch of the original section, but will contain a much larger number of higher pitches. In California the non-rise is usually one reiterate phrase, the rise being the phrase transposed an octave higher, the Yumans use a non-rise of long repeated sections each consisting of several phrases, the rise being three to five phrases performed only once, and in southern California the previous two and progressive forms are found. A distinctively Californian instrument is the clapper stick, a percussion instrument made by splitting an elderberry branch used to accompany singers and dancers.\n\nInhabiting a wide swath of the United States and Canada, Indigenous peoples of the Eastern Woodlands, according to Nettl, can be distinguished by antiphony (call and response style singing), which does not occur in other areas. Their territory includes Maritime Canada, New England, U.S. Mid-Atlantic, Great Lakes and Southeast regions. Songs are rhythmically complex, characterized by frequent metric changes and a close relationship to ritual dance. Flutes and whistles are solo instruments, and a wide variety of drums, rattles and striking sticks are played. Nettl describes the Eastern music area as the region between the Mississippi river and the Atlantic. The most complex styles are that of the Southeastern Creek, Yuchi, Cherokee, Choctaw, Iroquois and their language group, with the simpler style being that of the Algonquian language group including Delaware and Penobscot. The Algonquian-speaking Shawnee have a relatively complex style influenced by the nearby southeastern tribes.\n\nThe characteristics of this entire area include short iterative phrases; reverting relationships; shouts before, during, and after singing anhemitonic pentatonic scales; simple rhythms and meter and, according to Nettl, antiphonal or responsorial techniques including \"rudimentary imitative polyphony\". Melodic movement tends to be gradually descending throughout the area and vocals include a moderate amount of tension and pulsation.\n\nExtending across the American Midwest into Canada, Plains-area music is nasal, with high pitches and frequent falsettos, with a terraced descent (a step-by-step descent down an octave) in an unblended monophony. Strophes use incomplete repetition, meaning that songs are divided into two parts, the second of which is always repeated before returning to the beginning.\n\nLarge double-sided skin drums are characteristic of the Plains tribes, and solo end-blown flutes (flageolet) are also common.\n\nNettl describes the central Plains Indians, from Canada to Texas: Blackfoot, Crow, Dakota, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, and Comanche, as the most typical and simple sub-area of the Plains-Pueblo music area. This area's music is characterized by extreme vocal tension, pulsation, melodic preference for perfect fourths and a range averring a tenth, rhythmic complexity, and increased frequency of tetratonic scales. The musics of the Arapaho and Cheyenne intensify these characteristics, while the northern tribes, especially Blackfoot music, feature simpler material, smaller melodic ranges, and fewer scale tones.\n\nNettl Arapaho music includes ceremonial and secular songs, such as the ritualistic Sun Dance, performed in the summer when the various bands of the Arapaho people would come together. Arapaho traditional songs consist of two sections exhibiting terraced descent, with a range greater than an octave and scales between four and six tones. Other ceremonial songs were received in visions, or taught as part of a man's initiations into a society for his age group. Secular songs include a number of social dances, such as the triple meter round dances and songs to inspire warriors or recent exploits. There are also songs said to be taught by a guardian spirit, which should be sung only when the recipient is near death.\n\nMusic of the Great Basin is simple, discreet and ornate, characterized by short melodies with a range smaller than an octave, moderately-blended monophony, relaxed and open vocals and, most unusually, paired-phrase structure, in which a melodic phrase, repeated twice, is alternated with one to two additional phrases. A song of this type might be diagrammed as follows: AA BB CC AA BB CC, etc.\n\nNettl describes the music of the sparsely settled Great Basin, including most of desert Utah and Nevada (Paiute, Ute, Shoshoni) and some of southern Oregon (Modoc and Klamath), as \"extremely simple,\" featuring melodic ranges averaging just over a perfect fifth, many tetratonic scales, and short forms. The majority of songs are iterative with each phrase repeated once, though occasional songs with multiple repetitions are found. Many Modoc and Klamath songs contain only one repeated phrase and many of their scales only two to three notes (ditonic or tritonic). This style was carried to the Great Plains by the Ghost Dance religion which originated among the Paiute, and very frequently features paired-phrase patterns and a relaxed nonpulsating vocal style. Herzog attributes the similarly simple lullabies, song-stories, and gambling songs found all over the continent historically to the music of the Great Basin which was preserved through relative cultural isolation and low population.\n\nOpen vocals with monophony are common in the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia, though polyphony also occurs (this is the only area of North America with native polyphony). Chromatic intervals accompanying long melodies are also characteristic, and rhythms are complex and declamatory, deriving from speech. Instrumentation is more diverse than in the rest of North America, and includes a wide variety of whistles, flutes, horns and percussion instruments.\n\nNettl describes the music of the Kwakwaka'wakw, Nuu-chah-nulth, Tsimshian, Makah, and Quileute as some of the most complex on the continent, with the music of the Salish nations (Nlaka'pamux, Nuxálk, and Sliammon, and others directly east of the Northwest tribes) as being intermediary between these Northwest Coast tribes and Inuit music. The music of the Salish tribes, and even more so the Northwest coast, intensifies the significant features of Inuit music, see below, however their melodic movement is often pendulum-type (\"leaping in broad intervals from one limit of the range to the other\"). The Northwest coast music also \"is among the most complicated on the continent, especially in regard to rhythmic structure,\" featuring intricate rhythmic patterns distinct from but related to the vocal melody and rigid percussion. He also reports unrecorded use of incipient polyphony in the form of drones or parallel intervals in addition to antiphonal and responorial forms. Vocals are extremely tense, producing dynamic contrast, ornamentation, and pulsation, and also often using multiple sudden accents in one held tone.\n\nThe Inuit of Alaska, Northwest Territories, Yukon Territory, Nunavut and Greenland are well known for their throat-singing, an unusual method of vocalizing found only in a few cultures worldwide. Throat-singing is used as the basis for a game among the Inuit. Narrow-ranged melodies and declamatory effects are common, as in the Northwest. Repeated notes mark the ends of phrases. Box drums, which are found elsewhere, are common, as is a tambourine-like hand drum. Nettl describes \"Eskimo\" music as some of the simplest on the continent, listing characteristics including recitative-like singing, complex rhythmic organization, relatively small melodic range averaging about a sixth, prominence of major thirds and minor seconds melodically, with undulating melodic movement.\n\nArchaeological evidence of Native American music dates as far back as the 7th century. However, the earliest written documentation comes from the arrival of European explorers on the American continent, and the earliest academic research comes from the late 19th century. During that period, early musicologists and folklorists collected and studied Native American music, and propounded theories about indigenous styles. In the early 20th century, more systematic research began led by comparative musicologists like Frances Densmore, Natalie Curtis, George Herzog and Helen Heffron Roberts. Densmore was the most prolific of the era, publishing more than one hundred works on Native American music. Most recently, since the 1950s, Native American music has been a part of ethnomusicological research, studied by Bruno Nettl, William Powers and David McAllester, among others.\n\nMany music genres span multiple tribes. Pan-tribalism is the syncretic adoption of traditions from foreign communities. Since the rise of the United States and Canada, Native Americans have forged a common identity, and invented pan-Indian music, most famously including powwows, peyote songs, and the Ghost Dance.\n\nThe Ghost Dance spread throughout the Plains tribes in the 1890s and many songs are sung today. They are characterized by relaxed vocals and a narrow range. Apache-derived peyote songs, prayers in the Native American Church, use a descending melody and monophony. Rattles and water drums are used, in a swift tempo. The Sun Dance and Grass Dance of the plains are the roots of intertribal powwows, which feature music with terraced descent and nasal vocals, both Plains characteristic features.\n\nAn example of an intertribal song is the AIM Song, which uses meaningless vocables to make it accessible to people of all tribes. However, because of its origins from the Lakota and Ojibwe people, it still retains some Northern Plains and Great Lakes characteristics.\n\nJohn Trudell (Santee Dakota) launched a new genre of spoken word poetry in the 1980s, beginning with \"Aka Graffiti Man\" (1986). The next decade saw further innovations in Native American popular music, including Robbie Robertson (of The Band) releasing a soundtrack for a documentary, \"Music for the Native Americans\", that saw limited mainstream success, as well as Verdell Primeaux and Johnny Mike's modernized peyote songs, which they began experimenting with on \"\".\n\nWaila (or chicken scratch music of the Tohono O'odham) has gained performers like the Joaquin Brothers fame across Native American communities, while hip hop crews like WithOut Rezervation and Robby Bee & the Boyz From the Rez (\"Reservation of Education\") have a distinctively Native American flourish to hip hop. In the 21st century the leading light of contemporary Native American music has been Martha Redbone whose award winning albums \"Home of the Brave (2002)\" and \"Skintalk (2005)\" have incorporated both traditional song and culture references into a brew of soul, funk, rock and jazz that has reached audiences across Europe and Japan as well as into the urban communities of the US. Meanwhile, young Native musicians such as Red Earth (see \"Zia Soul\" (2003) ), DJ Abel, Derek Miller, Ethnic DeGeneration, War Water, and Casper are producing outstanding underground music (ranging from hip-hop to funk to reggae to metal) defying stereotypes of Native people (without label support).\n\nAmerican Indian opera is an intertribal music tradition, created when Gertrude Bonnin, a Yankton Dakota activist collaborated with a classical composer William Hanson to create the opera, \"Sun Dance\" in 1913. Cherokee Nation mezzo-soprano opera singer, Barbara McAlister has performed in many opera troupes and has sung at New York's Metropolitan Opera House. Brulé Lakota band Brulé and the American Indian Rock Opera create fullscale contemporary musical performances, including \"Concert for Reconciliation of the Cultures.\"\n\nThe Native American flute has achieved some measure of fame for its distinctive sound, used in a variety of new age and world music recordings. Its music was used in courtship, healing, meditation, and spiritual rituals.\n\nThe late 1960s saw a roots revival centered around the flute, with a new wave of flautists and artisans like Doc Tate Nevaquaya (Comanche) and Carl Running Deer. Notable and award winning Native American flautists include: Mary Youngblood, Kevin Locke, Charles Littleleaf, Jay Red Eagle, Robert Tree Cody, Robert Mirabal, Joseph Firecrow, and Jeff Ball. Tommy Wildcat is a contemporary flutist, who makes traditional Cherokee river cane flutes. Of special importance is R. Carlos Nakai (\"Changes\", 1983), who has achieved Gold record status and mainstream credibility for his mixture of the flute with other contemporary genres.\n\nThe Native American flute is the only flute in the world constructed with two air chambers - there is a wall inside the flute between the top (slow) air chamber and the bottom chamber which has the whistle and finger holes. The top chamber also serves as a secondary resonator, which gives the flute its distinctive sound. There is a hole at the bottom of the \"slow\" air chamber and a (generally) square hole at the top of the playing chamber. A block (or \"bird\") with a spacer is tied on top of the flute to form a thin, flat airstream for the whistle hole (or \"window\"). Some more modern flutes use an undercut either in the block or the flute to eliminate the need for a spacer.\n\nThe \"traditional\" Native American flute was constructed using measurements based on the body - the length of the flute would be the distance from armpit to wrist, the length of the top air chamber would be one fist-width, the distance from the whistle to the first hole also a fist-width, the distance between holes would be one thumb-width, and the distance from the last hole to the end would generally be one fist-width. Unlike Western music, traditional American Indian music had no standard pitch reference such as A440, so flutes were not standardized for pitch.\n\nHistoric Native American flutes are generally tuned to a variation of the minor pentatonic scale (such as you would get playing the black keys on a piano), which gives the instrument its distinctive plaintive sound. Recently some makers have begun experimenting with different scales, giving players new melodic options. Also, modern flutes are generally tuned in concert keys (such as A or D) so that they can be easily played with other instruments. The root keys of modern Native American flutes span a range of about three and a half octaves, from C2 to A5.\n\nNative American flutes most commonly have either 5 or 6 holes, but instruments can have anything from no holes to seven (including a thumb hole). Various makers employ different scales and fingerings for their flutes.\n\nSome modern Native American flutes are called \"drone\" flutes, and are two (or more) flutes built together. Generally, the drone chamber plays a fixed note which the other flute can play against in harmony.\n\nDrums are highly influential in American Indian music. Different tribes have different traditions about their drums and how to play them. For larger dance or powwow type drums, the basic construction is very similar in most tribes: a wooden frame or a carved and hollowed-out log, with rawhide buckskin or elk skin stretched out across the opening by sinew thongs. Traditionally American Indian drums are large, two to three feet in diameter, and they are played communally by groups of singers who sit around them in a circle. For smaller single-sided hand drums, a thinner frame or shell is used, and a rawhide surface is strung onto only one side, with lacing across the other. Other types include two basic styles of water drums: the Iroquois type and the Yaqui type. The Iroquois water drum is a small cup-shaped wooden vessel, with water inside it, and a moistened tanned hide stretched across the top opening; the wetness and tightness of the tanned hide produce changes in pitch as the water drum is played over time. The Yaqui type of water drum is actually a half gourd, large in size, that floats in a tub of water like a bubble on the surface; the outer round surface of the gourd is struck with a drum stick, and the vibrations are amplified using the tub of water as a resonator.\n\nAnother type of drum called a foot drum have been found in several southwestern and central-Californian Native American archaeological sites inhabited, or formally inhabited, by the Miwok, Maidu, Nahua, and Hopi Indian tribes. These drums were often semicircle cross-sectioned hollow logs laid over wood covered 'resonating' pits positioned according to custom in kivas or dance houses. The foot drums were played by stomping on top of the hollow log with the structure's poles used for steadying.\n\nThe dedicated Native American Music Awards, which successfully proposed the Grammy Award for Best Native American Music Album, was launched in 1998 and continues to be held annually. The Native American Music Awards or N.A.M.A. was the first national awards program for Native American music in North America. The awards were born out of a need for greater recognition for Native American music initiatives and remains the largest professional membership based organization in the world.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2011, the American Grammy Awards presented an annual award for Best Native American Music Album, and the Canadian Juno Awards present an annual award for Aboriginal Recording of the Year. On April 6, 2011, it was announced that the Grammy Award for Best Native American Music Album would be merged with the Best Hawaiian Music Album and Best Zydeco or Cajun Music Album categories into a new category, Best Regional Roots Music Album. This change was part of a massive restructuring of Grammy categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1275591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1275591", "title": "Islam in Iran", "text": "Islam in Iran\n\nThe Islamic conquest of Persia (637–651) led to the end of the Sasanian Empire and the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Persia. However, the achievements of the previous Persian civilizations were not lost, but were to a great extent absorbed by the new Islamic polity. Islam has been the official religion of Iran since then, except for a short duration after the Mongol raids and establishment of Ilkhanate. Iran became an Islamic republic after the Islamic Revolution of 1979.\n\nBefore the Islamic conquest, the Persians had been mainly Zoroastrian; however, there were also large and thriving Christian and Jewish communities, especially in the territories of at that time northwestern, western, and southern Iran, mainly Caucasian Albania, Asōristān, Persian Armenia, and Caucasian Iberia. Eastern Sassanian Iran, what is now solely composed of Afghanistan and Central Asia, was predominantly Buddhist. There was a slow but steady movement of the population toward Islam. When Islam was introduced to Iranians, the nobility and city-dwellers were the first to convert, Islam spread more slowly among the peasantry and the \"dehqans\", or landed gentry. By the late 11th century, the majority of Persians had become Muslim, at least nominally.\n\nIslam is the religion of 99.4% of Iranians. Nearly 90% of Iranians are Shi'a and about 10% are Sunni. Most Sunnis in Iran are Kurds, Larestani people (from Larestan), Turkomen, and Baluchs, living in the northwest, northeast, south, and southeast. Almost all of Iranian Shi'as are Twelvers.\n\nThough Iran is known today as a stronghold of the Shi'a Muslim faith, it did not become so until much later, around the 15th century. The Safavid dynasty made Shi'a Islam the official state religion in the early sixteenth century and aggressively proselytized on its behalf. It is also believed that by the mid-seventeenth century most people in Iran and the territory of the contemporary neighboring Republic of Azerbaijan had become Shi'as, an affiliation that has continued. Over the following centuries, with the state-fostered rise of a Persian-based Shi'ite clergy, a synthesis was formed between Persian culture and Shi'ite Islam that marked each indelibly with the tincture of the other.\n\nMuslims invaded Iran in the time of Umar (637) and conquered it after several great battles. Yazdegerd III fled from one district to another Merv in 651. By 674, Muslims had conquered Greater Khorasan (which included modern Iranian Khorasan province and modern Afghanistan, Transoxania).\n\nAs Bernard Lewis has quoted \"These events have been variously seen in Iran: by some as a blessing, the advent of the true faith, the end of the age of ignorance and heathenism; by others as a humiliating national defeat, the conquest and subjugation of the country by foreign invaders. Both perceptions are of course valid, depending on one's angle of vision.\"\n\nUnder Umar and his immediate successors, the Arab conquerors attempted to maintain their political and cultural cohesion despite the attractions of the civilizations they had conquered. The Arabs were to settle in the garrison towns rather than on scattered estates. The new non-Muslim subjects, or \"dhimmi\", were to pay a special tax, the \"jizya\" or poll tax, which was calculated per individual at varying rates for able bodied men of military age.\n\nIranians were among the very earliest converts to Islam, and their conversion in significant numbers began as soon as the Arab armies reached and overran the Persian plateau. Despite some resistance from elements of the Zoroastrian clergy and other ancient religions, the anti-Islamic policies of later conquerors like the Il-khanids, the impact of the Christian and secular West in modern times, and the attraction of new religious movements like Babism and the Bahai faith (qq.v.), the vast majority of Iranians became and have remained Muslims. Today perhaps 98 percent of ethnic Iranians, including the population of Persia, are at least nominal Muslims. For such a fundamental, pervasive, and enduring cultural transformation, the phenomenon of Iranian conversions to Islam has received remarkably little scholarly attention (for an early and still worthwhile survey of the subject, see Arnold, pp. 209–20; for significant recent advances, see Bulliet, 1979a; idem, 1979b).\n\nRecent research has established a general chronological framework for the process of conversion of Iranians to Islam. From a study of the probable dates of individual conversions based on genealogies in biographical dictionaries, Richard Bulliet has suggested that there was gradual and limited conversion of Persians down to the end of the Umayyad period (132/750), followed by a rapid increase in the number of conversions after the ʿAbbasid revolution, so that by the time when regional dynasties had been established in the east (ca. 338/950) 80 percent or more of Iranians had become Muslims. The data on which Bulliet’s study was based limited the validity of this paradigm to generalizations about full, formal conversions in an urban environment. The situation in rural areas and individual regions may have been quite different, but the overall pattern is consistent with what can be deduced from traditional historical sources. Although in some areas, for example, Shiraz at the time of Moqaddasi’s visit in about 375/985 (p. 429), there may still have been strong non-Muslim elements, it is reasonable to suppose that the Persian milieu as a whole became predominantly Islamic within the period of time suggested by Bulliet’s research.\n\nFollowing the Abbasid revolution of 749-51, in which Iranian converts played a major role, the Caliphate's center of gravity moved to Mesopotamia and underwent significant Iranian influences. Accordingly, the Muslim population of Iran rose from approx. 40% in the mid 9th century to close to 100% by the end of 11th century. Islam was readily accepted by Zoroastrians who were employed in industrial and artisan positions because, according to Zoroastrian dogma, such occupations that involved defiling fire made them impure. Moreover, Muslim missionaries did not encounter difficulty in explaining Islamic tenets to Zoroastrians, as there were many similarities between the faiths. According to Thomas Walker Arnold, for the Persian, he would meet Ahura Mazda and Ahriman under the names of Allah and Iblis. Muslim leaders in their effort to win converts encouraged attendance at Muslim prayer, and allowed the Quran to be recited in Persian instead of Arabic so that it would be intelligible to all. The first complete translation of the Qur'an into Persian occurred during the reign of Samanids in the 9th century. Seyyed Hossein Nasr suggests that the rapid increase in conversion was aided by the Persian nationality of the rulers.\n\nAccording to Bernard Lewis:\n\"Iran was indeed Islamized, but it was not Arabized. Persians remained Persians. And after an interval of silence, Iran reemerged as a separate, different and distinctive element within Islam, eventually adding a new element even to Islam itself. Culturally, politically, and most remarkable of all even religiously, the Iranian contribution to this new Islamic civilization is of immense importance. The work of Iranians can be seen in every field of cultural endeavor, including Arabic poetry, to which poets of Iranian origin composing their poems in Arabic made a very significant contribution. In a sense, Iranian Islam is a second advent of Islam itself, a new Islam sometimes referred to as Islam-i Ajam. It was this Persian Islam, rather than the original Arab Islam, that was brought to new areas and new peoples: to the Turks, first in Central Asia and then in the Middle East in the country which came to be called Turkey, and India. The Ottoman Turks brought a form of Iranian civilization to the walls of Vienna...\"\n\nThe Islamization of Iran was to yield deep transformations within the cultural, scientific, and political structure of Iran's society: The blossoming of Persian literature, philosophy, medicine and art became major elements of the newly forming Muslim civilization. Inheriting a heritage of thousands of years of civilization, and being at the \"crossroads of the major cultural highways\", contributed to Persia emerging as what culminated into the \"Islamic Golden Age\". During this period, hundreds of scholars and scientists vastly contributed to technology, science and medicine, later influencing the rise of European science during the Renaissance.\n\nThe most important scholars of almost all of the Islamic sects and schools of thought were Persian or live in Iran including most notable and reliable Hadith collectors of Shia and Sunni like Shaikh Saduq, Shaikh Kulainy, Imam Bukhari, Imam Muslim and Hakim al-Nishaburi, the greatest theologians of Shia and Sunni like Shaykh Tusi, Imam Ghazali, Imam Fakhr al-Razi and Al-Zamakhshari, the greatest physicians, astronomers, logicians, mathematicians, metaphysicians, philosophers and scientists like Al-Farabi, Avicenna, and Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī, the greatest Shaykh of Sufism like Rumi, Abdul-Qadir Gilani.\n\nIbn Khaldun narrates in his Muqaddimah:\n\n\"It is a remarkable fact that, with few exceptions, most Muslim scholars… in the intellectual sciences have been non-Arabs, thus the founders of grammar were Sibawaih and after him, al-Farsi and Az-Zajjaj. All of them were of Persian descent... they invented rules of (Arabic) grammar. Great jurists were Persians. Only the Persians engaged in the task of preserving knowledge and writing systematic scholarly works. Thus the truth of the statement of the prophet (Muhammad) becomes apparent, \"\"… The intellectual sciences were also the preserve of the Persians, left alone by the Arabs, who did not cultivate them… as was the case with all crafts… This situation continued in the cities as long as the Persians and Persian countries, Iraq, Khorasan and Transoxiana (modern Central Asia), retained their sedentary culture.\"\n\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries, non-Arab subjects of the Ummah, especially Persians created a movement called Shu'ubiyyah in response to the privileged status of Arabs. This movement led to resurgence of Persian national identity. Although Persians adopted Islam, over the centuries they worked to protect and revive their distinctive language and culture, a process known as Persianization. Arabs and Turks also participated in this attempt.\n\nAs the power of the Abbasid caliphs diminished, a series of dynasties rose in various parts of Iran, some with considerable influence and power. Among the most important of these overlapping dynasties were the Tahirids in Khorasan (820-72); the Saffarids in Sistan (867-903); and the Samanids (875-1005), originally at Bokhara. The Samanids eventually ruled an area from central Iran to Pakistan. By the early 10th century, the Abbasids almost lost control to the growing Persian faction known as the Buwayhid dynasty (934-1055). Since much of the Abbasid administration had been Persian anyway, the Buwayhid, who were Zaidi Shia, were quietly able to assume real power in Baghdad.\n\nThe Samanid dynasty was the first fully native dynasty to rule Iran since the Muslim conquest, and led the revival of Persian culture. The first important Persian poet after the arrival of Islam, Rudaki, was born during this era and was praised by Samanid kings. The Samanids also revived many ancient Persian festivals. Their successor, the Ghaznawids, who were of non-Iranian Turkic origin, also became instrumental in the revival of Persian.\n\nIn 962 a Turkish governor of the Samanids, Alptigin, conquered Ghazna (in present-day Afghanistan) and established a dynasty, the Ghaznavids, that lasted to 1186. Later, the Seljuks, who like the Ghaznavids were Turks, slowly conquered Iran over the course of the 11th century. Their leader, Tughril Beg, turned his warriors against the Ghaznavids in Khorasan. He moved south and then west, conquering but not wasting the cities in his path. In 1055 the caliph in Baghdad gave Tughril Beg robes, gifts, and the title King of the East. Under Tughril Beg's successor, Malik Shah (1072–1092), Iran enjoyed a cultural and scientific renaissance, largely attributed to his brilliant Iranian vizier, Nizam al Mulk. These leaders established the Isfahan Observatory where Omar Khayyám did much of his experimentation for a new calendar, and they built religious schools in all the major towns. They brought Abu Hamid Ghazali, one of the greatest Islamic theologians, and other eminent scholars to the Seljuk capital at Baghdad and encouraged and supported their work.\n\nA serious internal threat to the Seljuks during their reign came from the Hashshashin- Ismailis of the Nizari sect, with headquarters at Alamut between Rasht and Tehran. They controlled the immediate area for more than 150 years and sporadically sent out adherents to strengthen their rule by murdering important officials. Several of the various theories on the etymology of the word \"assassin\" derive from this group.\n\nAnother notable Sunni dynasty were the Timurids. Timur was a Turco-Mongol leader from the Eurasian Steppe, who conquered and ruled in the tradition of Genghis Khan. Under the Timurid Empire, the Turco-Persian tradition which began during the Abbasid period would continue. Ulugh Beg, grandson of Timur, built an observatory of his own, and a grand madrassah at Samarkand.\n\nAlthough Shi'as have lived in Iran since the earliest days of Islam, the writers of the Four Books of Shi'a ahadith were Iranians of the pre-Safavid era and there was one Shi'a dynasty in part of Iran during the tenth and eleventh centuries, according to Mortaza Motahhari the majority of Iranian scholars and masses remained Sunni till the time of the Safavids.\n\nThe domination of the Sunni creed during the first nine Islamic centuries characterizes the religious history of Iran during this period. There were however some exceptions to this general domination which emerged in the form of the Zaydīs of Tabaristan, the Buwayhid, the rule of Sultan Muhammad Khudabandah (r. Shawwal 703-Shawwal 716/1304-1316) and the Sarbedaran. Nevertheless, apart from this domination there existed, firstly, throughout these nine centuries, Shia inclinations among many Sunnis of this land and, secondly, original Imami Shiism as well as Zaydī Shiism had prevalence in some parts of Iran. During this period, Shia in Iran were nourished from Kufah, Baghdad and later from Najaf and Hillah.\n\nHowever, during the first nine centuries there are four high points in the history of this linkage:\n\nDue to their history being almost fully intertwined, Iran as well as Azerbaijan are both discussed here. Iran and Azerbaijan were predominantly Sunni until the 16th century. Changes in the religious make-up of nowadays both nations changed drastically from that time and on. In 1500 the Safavid Shah Ismail I undertook the conquering of Iran and Azerbaijan and commenced a policy of forced conversion of Sunni Muslims to Shia Islam. Many Sunnis were murdered. When Shah Ismail I conquered Iraq, Dagestan, Eastern Anatolia, and Armenia he similarly forcefully converted or murdered Sunni Muslims. The oppression and forced conversion of Sunnis would continue, mostly unabated, for the greater part of next two centuries until Iran as well as what is now Azerbaijan became predominantly Shi’ite countries.\n\nAs in the case of the early caliphate, Safavid rule had been based originally on both political and religious legitimacy, with the shah being both king and divine representative. With the later erosion of Safavid central political authority in the mid-17th century, the power of the Shia scholars in civil affairs such as judges, administrators, and court functionaries, began to grow, in a way unprecedented in Shi'ite history. Likewise, the ulama began to take a more active role in agitating against Sufism and other forms of popular religion, which remained strong in Iran, and in enforcing a more scholarly type of Shi'a Islam among the masses. The development of the ta'ziah—a passion play commemorating the martyrdom of Imam Husayn and his family — and Ziarat of the shrines and tombs of local Shi'ite leaders began during this period, largely at the prompting of the Shi'ite clergy. According to Mortaza Motahhari, the majority of Iranians turned to Shi'a Islam from the Safavid period onwards. Of course, it cannot be denied that Iran's environment was more favorable to the flourishing of the Shi'a Islam as compared to all other parts of the Muslim world. Shi'a Islam did not penetrate any land to the extent that it gradually could in Iran. With the passage of time, Iranians' readiness to practise Shi'a Islam grew day by day.\nIt was the Safavids who made Iran the spiritual bastion of Shi’ism against the onslaughts of shi'as' by orthodox Sunni Islam, and the repository of Persian cultural traditions and self-awareness of Iranianhood, acting as a bridge to modern Iran. According to Professor Roger Savory:\n\nDuring the 20th century Iran underwent significant changes such as the 1906 Constitutional Revolution and the secularism of the Pahlavi dynasty.\n\nAccording to scholar Roy Mottahedeh, one significant change to Islam in Iran during the first half of the 20th century was that the class of ulema lost its informality that allowed it to include everyone from the highly trained jurist to the \"shopkeeper who spent one afternoon a week memorizing and transmitting a few traditions.\" Laws by Reza Shah that requiring military service and dress in European-style clothes for Iranians, gave talebeh and mullahs exemptions, but only if they passed specific examinations proving their learnedness, thus excluding less educated clerics.\n\nIn addition Islamic Madrasah schools became more like 'professional' schools, leaving broader education to secular government schools and sticking to Islamic learning. \"Ptolemaic astronomy, Aveicennian medicines, and the algebra of Omar Kahayyam\" was dispensed with.\n\nThe Iranian Revolution (also known as the Islamic Revolution, Persian: انقلاب اسلامی, \"Enghelābe Eslāmi\") was the revolution that transformed Iran from a secular, modernizing monarchy under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, to an Islamic republic based on the doctrine of (rule by an Islamic jurist), under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the revolution and founder of the Islamic Republic. It has been called \"the third great revolution in history\", following the French and Russian Revolutions, and an event that \"made Islamic fundamentalism a political force ... from Morocco to Malaysia.\"\n\nSunni Muslims constitute approximately 10% of the Iranian population. A majority of Lari people (Persians), a part of Kurds, virtually all Baluchis and Turkomans, and a minority of Arabs and Azeris are Sunnis, as are small communities of Persians in southern Iran and Khorasan.\n\nThe mountainous region of Larestan is mostly inhabited by indigenous Sunni Persians who did not convert to Shia Islam during the Safavids because the mountainous region of Larestan was too isolated. The majority of Lari people are Sunni Muslims, 35% of Lari people are Shia Muslims. The people of Larestan speak the Lari language, which is a southwestern Iranian language closely related to Old Persian (pre-Islamic Persian) and Luri.\n\nShia clergy tend to view missionary work among Sunnis to convert them to Shi'a Islam as a worthwhile religious endeavor. In those towns with mixed populations in the Persian Gulf region, and Sistan and Baluchistan, tensions between Shi'as and Sunnis existed both before and after the Revolution. Religious tensions have been highest during major Shi'a observances, especially Moharram.\n\nIran's government is unique in following the principle of \"velayat-e faqih\" or guardianship of the jurist, according to which \ngovernment must be run in accordance with traditional Islamic \"sharia\", and for this to happen a leading Islamic jurist (\"faqih\") must provide political \"guardianship\" (\"wilayat\" or \"velayat\") over the people.\nFollowing the Iranian Revolution, the 1979 Constitution of Islamic Republic of Iran made the \"guardian\" the Supreme Leader of Iran The author of \"Velayat-e faqih\" doctrine, Ayatollah Khomeini, as the first Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran mandates that the official religion of Iran is Shia Islam and the Twelver Ja'fari school, though it also mandates that other Islamic schools are to be accorded full respect, and their followers are free to act in accordance with their own jurisprudence in performing their religious rites and recognizes Zoroastrian, Jewish, and Christian Iranians as religious minorities. As part of this mandate of allowing other practices, however, the Islamic Republic does not allow Sunni mosques in areas where Sunnis are not the demographic majority.\n\nCitizens of the Islamic Republic of Iran are officially divided into four categories: Muslims, Zoroastrians, Jews and Christians. This official division ignores other religious minorities in Iran, notably those of the Bahá'í faith. Bahá’ís are a \"non-recognized\" religious minority without any legal existence. They are classified as \"unprotected infidels\" by the authorities, and are subject to systematic discrimination on the basis of their beliefs. Similarly, atheism is officially disallowed; one must declare oneself as a member of one of the four recognized faiths in order to avail oneself of many of the rights of citizenship.\n\nHistorically, the most important religious institution in Iran has been the mosque. In towns and cities, congregational prayers, as well as prayers and rites associated with religious observances and important phases in Muslim life, took place in mosques. Primarily an urban phenomenon, mosques did not exist in most Iranian villages. In the years preceding the Revolution, Iranian Shias generally attached diminishing significance to institutional religion, and by the 1970s there was little emphasis on mosque attendance, even for the Friday congregational prayers. During the Revolution, however, mosques in large cities played a prominent social role in organizing people\nfor large demonstrations. Since that time, the mosques have continued to play important political and social roles, in addition to their traditional religious functions. At the same time, weekly mosque attendance rate in Iran has been very low compared to other Muslim countries. In particular, politicization of Friday prayers under the Islamic Republic has had the paradoxical consequence of discouraging religious people from attending Friday prayers. People who attend prayers tend to have more positive evaluation of the political system than people who do not attend.\n\nAnother religious institution of major significance has been the hoseiniyeh, or Islamic center. Wealthy patrons financed construction of hoseiniyehs in urban areas to serve as sites for recitals and performances commemorating the martyrdom of Hussein, especially during the month of Moharram. In the 1970s, hoseiniyehs such as the Hoseiniyeh Irshad in Tehran became politicized as prominent clerical and lay preachers helped to lay the groundwork for the Revolution by referring to the symbolic deaths as martyrs of Hussein and the other imams in veiled but obvious criticism of Mohammad Reza Shah’s regime. Institutions providing religious education include madrassas, or seminaries, and maktabs, or primary schools run by the clergy. The madrassas historically were important settings for advanced training in Shia theology and jurisprudence. Each madrassa generally was associated with a noted Shia scholar who had attained the rank of ayatollah. Some older madrassas\nfunctioned like religious universities at which several scholars taught diverse religious and secular subjects. Students, or talabehs, lived on the grounds of the madrassas and received stipends for the duration of their studies, usually a minimum of seven years, during which they prepared for the examinations that qualify a seminary student to be a low-level preacher, or mullah. At the time of the Revolution, there\nwere slightly more than 11,000 talabehs in Iran, approximately 60 percent of them at the madrassas in Qom. From 1979 to 1982, the number of talabehs in Qom more than tripled from 6,500. There were just under 25,000 talabehs at all levels of study in Qom seminaries in the early 2000s, as well as about 12,000 talabehs at seminaries in other Iranian cities.\n\nMaktabs started to decline in number and importance in the first decades of the twentieth century, once the government began developing a national public school system. Nevertheless, maktabs continued to exist as private religious schools until the Revolution. Because the overall emphasis of public schools has remained secular subjects, since 1979 maktabs have continued to serve children whose parents want them to have a more religious education.\n\nAnother major religious institution in Iran is the shrine. Pilgrimage to the shrines of imams is a specific Shia custom, undertaken because Shia pilgrims believe that the imams and their relatives have the power to intercede with God on behalf of petitioners. Of the more than 1,100 shrines in Iran, the most important are those for the Eighth Imam, Ali al-Ridha, in Mashhad and for his sister Fatimah bint Musa in Qom, and for Seyyed Rouhollah Khomeini in Tehran. Each of these is a huge complex that includes the mausoleum of the venerated one, tombs of various notables, mosques, madrassas, and libraries. Imam Reza's shrine is considered the holiest. In addition to the usual shrine accoutrements, it comprises hospitals, dispensaries, a museum, and several mosques located in a series of courtyards surrounding the imam’s tomb. The shrine's endowments and gifts are the largest of all religious institutions in the country. Although there are no special times for visiting this or other shrines, it is customary for pilgrimage traffic to be heaviest during Shia holy periods. Visitors represent all socioeconomic levels. Whereas piety is a motivation for many, others come to seek the spiritual grace or general good fortune that a visit to the shrine is believed to ensure. Since the nineteenth century, it has been customary among the bazaar class and members of the lower classes to recognize those who have made a pilgrimage to Mashhad by prefixing their names with the title mashti. Shrine authorities have estimated that at least 4 million pilgrims visit the shrine annually in the early 2000s. There are also important secondary shrines for other relatives of the Eighth Imam in Tehran and Shiraz. In virtually all towns and in many villages, there are numerous lesser shrines, known as imamzadehs, that commemorate descendants of the imams who are reputed to have led saintly lives. In Iraq the shrines at Karbala and An Najaf also are revered by Iranian Shias. Pilgrimages to these shrines and the hundreds of local mamzadehs are undertaken to petition the saints to grant special favors or to help one through a period of troubles. The constant movement of pilgrims from all over Iran has helped bind together a linguistically heterogeneous population. Pilgrims serve as major sources of information about conditions in different parts of the country and thus help to mitigate the\nparochialism of the regions.\n\nThe vaqf is a traditional source of financial support for all religious institutions. It is a religious endowment by which land and other income-producing property is given in perpetuity for the maintenance of a shrine, mosque, madrassa, or charitable institution such as a hospital, library, or orphanage. A mutavalli administers a vaqf in accordance with the stipulations in the donor's bequest. In many vaqfs, the position of mutavalli is hereditary. Under the Pahlavis, the government attempted to exercise control over administration of the vaqfs, especially those of the larger shrines. This practice caused conflict with the clergy, who perceived the government's efforts as inimical\nto their influence and authority in traditional religious matters. The government’s interference with the administration of vaqfs during the Pahlavi era led to a sharp decline in the number of vaqf bequests. Instead, wealthy and pious Shias chose to give financial contributions directly to the leading ayatollahs in the form of zakat, or obligatory alms. The clergy, in turn, used the funds to administer their madrassas and to institute various educational and charitable programs, which indirectly provided them with more influence in society. The access of the clergy to a steady and independent source of funding was an important factor in their ability to resist state controls, and ultimately helped them direct the opposition to the shah.\n\nStatistics of religious buildings according to \"آمارنامه اماکن مذهبی\" which has been gathered in 2003.\n\n\n\n"}

He is the leading Sikh figure among the list of Sikh martyrs who struggled for and volunteered the liberation of Gurdwara Nankana Sahib from the clutches of Mahant Narain Das on 20 February 1921. The supreme sacrifices made by Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh and his other companions have been acknowledged by the grateful Sikh nation. From that day onwards, the Sikh nation remembers these brave Sikhs in their daily ardas (prayer). Every year on 21 February at this Shaheedi Asthan, Guru Granth Sahib's \"Swaroop\" with Bullet marks is brought to Deewan (assembly hall) from 2pm to 4pm for darshan of the Sikh Sangat.\n\nBhai Tehal Singh was born on Diwali Night of 1875, Dhanju Kamboj family of village Nizampur, District Amritsar. His father was Sardar Chanda Singh Dhanju and mother Sardarani Rukman Kaur Dhanju. The family moved to Chak No 38, Village Nizampur Deva Singh Wala, District Sheikhupur during the colonization of Lower Chenab Bar in the early years of the 19th century. Bhai Tehal Singh went to Malaya in 1902 and for some time he worked as watchman in Kualalumpur but had to return to India in 1909 due to some family issue. He again left for Malaya in 1911 but due to death of his father in 1915, he had to come back again in 1915.\n\nSoon after his second return from Malaya, Bhai Tehal Singh took Amrit-pan and jumped into the Sikh Gurdwara Reform Movement. He played a very active role to awaken the migrant Sikh farmers of the Canal Colony, Sheikhupura, and spread the message of Sikh Gurus in numerous villages around Nizampur Deva Singh Wala. He participated in the Political Conference of Dharowal as well as in the Movement started by the Sikh Community to liberate Gurdwara Sacha Sauda Chuharkana and Gurdwara Tarn Taran from the control of Mohants. Bhai Tehal Singh had joined the squad which went to liberate Gurdawara Tarn Taran from the Mahant control on 26 January 1921 and was badly injured in the brick-bats thrown at the Jatha volunteers by the pujaris. He also volunteered in the morcha launched by Sikhs in connection with Gurdwara Rikab Ganj wall in Delhi.\n\nBut his most active and memorable contribution is noticeable in the liberation of Gurdawara Nankana Sahib from Mahant Narain Dass. On 24 January, members of the Akali Dal including Master Tara Singh, Harbans Singh Attari, Master Sundar Singh Lyallpuri, Teja Singh Samundari, Harchand Singh, Kartar Singh Jhabbar, Bhai Dalip Singh Lyallpuri, Jaswant Singh Jhabal, Sardul Singh Kavishar etc. convened a meeting in the \"Akali\" office, Lyallpur and decided to hold a \"Panthik Diwan\" on 4, 5 and 6 March 1921 in Nankana to take control of the Gurdawara complex from Mahant Narain Das. The Akali leaders got the news through their detectives that the Mahant had devised a murderous plan to invite the Akali leaders at Gurdawara Nankana Sahib on 5 March and have them all killed. This news incensed the Sikhs greatly. To foil Mahant's foul designs, hot-blooded Sikh leaders including Jathedar Kartar Singh Jhabbar, Bhai Buta Singh Lyallpuri, Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali, Bhai Tehal Singh Nizam Deva Singh wala etc. held a meeting on 17 February 1921 at Gurdawara Sacha Sauda and decided to lead a Shaheedi Jatha to Gurdawara Nankana Sahib on 29 February 1921 and seize its control from the Mahant prior to the \"Panthik Diwan\". The planning to send Bhai Buta Singh Lyallpuri directly to Nankana Sahib on 19 February 1921, while two Jathas would be organized under Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali and Bhai Kartar Singh Jhabbar which would meet and unite into a single Jatha at Chandar kot jhal on 19 February 1921 (evening). From there onwards the unified Jatha would proceed to Nankana Sahib in the pal of night and reach Gurdawara Nankana Sahib early morning (nectral hours) of 20 February and seize control of the Gurdawara.\n\nEnthused and imbued by the spirit to do something for the Sikh Panth, Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh extensively toured numerous villages of Chak No 80, No 38, No 18 and No 10 comprising Nizampur Deva Singh Wala, Mula Singh Wala, Chelewala, Dalla Chand Singh, Thothian, Dhanuwal, Bohoru etc. which were all inhabited by the Kamboj colonists from district Amritsar. He was able to collect a Jatha (squad) of about 150 Sikh recruits, majority of whom from the Kamboj community of the region. This Jatha was merged with the Jatha of 23 Sikhs brought by Jathedar Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali. After performing Ardas (Sikh prayer) on 19 February 1921, the combined Jatha set on march towards Gurdawara Nankana Sahib under overall commandership of Jathedar Lachhman Singh Dharowali. When the Jatha reached Chandar kot jhal, some among the volunteers decided to stop and wait for the other Jatha from Jathedar Kartar Singh Jhabbar to join as decided in on 17 February meeting. At this very moment, Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh thrust himself forward saying: \"Dear Khalsa ji, we don't want to wait for anybody. We have taken our resolve at the prayer (Ardaas) and it is imperative for us to move forward now.\". The Jatha resumed its journey thence-afterwards following Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh and continuing its onwards march reciting Shabad Gurbani all through the night. On 20 February 1921, early morning when the Jatha had just entered the outer skirts of Nankana City near Brick-kilns (Bhattha), Chaudhury Pal Singh Layalpuri brought and conveyed message from Bhai Dalip Singh Sangla to Jathedar Lachhman Singh Dharowali urging him to suspend the march. Chaudhury also gripped Jathedar Bhai Lachhman Singh from behind to stop him. Jathedar Lacchman Singh had great regard for Bhai Dalip Singh Sangla and thus agreed to disband the Jatha but Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh once again thrust himself to pull Chaudhury Pal Singh away from Jathedar Lachhman Singh's body and spoke thus: \"Khalsa ji, it is time not to stop but to move now. We started from our homes with commitments made under Ardas (prayer) to achieve martyrdom. It is very un-Singh-like to suspend the march and return home...Today is also very special day for us since it coincides with the birth day of Guru Har Rai ji who, though possessed army and weapons, yet did not use them in spite of numerous provocations from his enemies...The worst the Mahant could do is kill us, but who is afraid of death?\". And he further reminded the volunteers to remain peaceful and avoid any provocation and act of retaliation.\n\nEnthused by the speech of Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh, the entire Shaheedi Jatha including Jathedar Bhai Lacchamn Singh Dharowali resumed the march following Bhai Tehal Singh. At about 5.00 AM when the Jatha was quite close to the Gurdawara complex, another horseman messenger, Bhai Waryama Singh (Ram Singh?), arrived with letter from the Akali leadership. In vain did he too try to persuade Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh and the Jatha to return. Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh continued to lead the Jatha and walk towards the Gurdwara. Bhai Lachhman Singh and others repeatedly requested him to relent, but determined Bhai Tehal Singh stuck to his Ardas. The Jatha soon entered Darshni Deohri of the Gurdwara Nankana Sahib at about 6.00 AM, February 20, 1921. While some of the devotees from death squad took their seats inside the \"Prakash Asthan\", others sat on the platform and the Baran dari. Jathedar Bhai Lachhman Singh Dharowali sat on Guru's 'Taabiya' (Behind Guru Granth Sahib).\n\nThe Mahant had got the news of the Jatha's arrival at Chander kot on the 19th February evening. He had gathered his men at night and briefed them about their duties. After the Jatha had sat down, the Mahant signaled his men to carry out the predetermined plan. They closed the main gate and started firing from roof tops. Twenty-six Singhs became martyrs to those bullets in the courtyard while another sixty or so sitting inside the Darbar Sahib became targets of bullets. When the Mahant's men saw no one moving, they came down with swords and choppers. Any Singh they found breathing was cut to pieces. Thus 86 Jatha Singhs including Jathedar Bhai Tehal Singh of Nizam Deva Singh Wala and Jathedar Bhai Lachhman Singh of Dharowali achieved supreme martyrdom for the glory of the Sikh Panth. Next day, 21 February 1921, Mr King, Commissioner Lahore handed over the keys of the Gurdawara complex to Sardar Harbans Singh. Thus, the peaceful Sikhs had won a decisive and glorious battle against the corrupt Mahant backed by powerful British Imperialist bureaucracy.\n\nThere are different versions on number of fatalities in this holocaust. Some writers put the death figures at 120, 150 or even 200. The government reports placed the death figures at 126. Police inspector Bachan Singh had put the number at 156. The report by Nankana Sahib Committee published in \"Shaheedi Jeewan\" however, placed the deaths at 86 and also listed the strength of the Shaheedi Jatha at 200. It seems that, besides Shaheedi Jatha Singhs, many non-participant devotees and others staying within Gurdwara also fell victims to Mahant's barbarism.\n\n\n\nMassacre at Nankana Sahib : <br>\nSikh Gurdwaras in History and Role of Jhabbar: \n"}

It has its roots in the Kongo-Angola culture and is still kept alive today in Cuba by folkloric groups. Practitioners are referred to as \"maniseros\".\n\nThe word \"mani\" (or accented \"maní\" in Spanish to indicate stress on the final syllable) is said to mean 'war', in an indeterminate African language, and is not a reference to 'peanuts', which the word \"maní\" can also refer to in Cuban Spanish. Its longer Spanish names, \"juego de maní\", ('game of \"mani\"' or '\"maní\" game') and \"baile de maní\" ('dance of \"mani\"' or '\"maní\" dance') would thus mean 'war game' or 'war dance', respectively, when fully translated from both languages.\n\nAn even longer name recorded is \"juego de maní con grasa\" (loosely, '\"maní\" greased game' or 'war game with grease') because of its smooth and slippery qualities.\n\nIn English, some modern practitioners call it simply mani, with no accent. The descriptive term mani stick-fighting may also be encountered.\n\nCuban \"juego de maní\" is related to Brazilian \"capoeira\" in its African roots, as both derive from the Kongo-Angola culture. As with other similar dance and martial artforms arising in the 16th century onward among African slaves in European colonies in the Americas, \"juego de maní\" developed initially as means for the slaves to disguise fighting practice as a form of dance, in their scarce free time from labor. Some of their masters would recognize it as fighting competition and gamble on the outcomes. It is thought that sometimes slaves were made to fight to the death for their masters' sport.\n\nThe distinct Cuban \"juego de maní\" form had emerged clearly by the 19th century on Cuban sugar-cane plantations, by then staffed by free people of mixed Afro-Cuban ancestry.\n\nOriginally, Cuban women also danced \"juego de maní\", and this was outlawed in the 1930s, but was still performed.\n\nToday, \"maní\" is very folkloric, and those who practice it do so mainly as a pastime or for socializing, because it encompasses so much: music, singing, sparring, friendship, etc.\n\nCaricao has a version, and Puerto Rico has its own \"maní\" which should not be confused with Cuba's \"juego de maní\".\n\nBouts feature a pair of opponents who follow prescribed dancing and fighting patterns, in a circle. In early colonial Cuba, \"maní\" involved a solo dancer who danced within a circle of opponents, who tried to strike blows as he executed various jumps and evasive steps. It later became a one-on-one form.\n\nAlthough not as gymnastic as \"capoeira regional\", it is much more similar to \"capoeira Angola\", and to \"l'agya\" (a.k.a. \"damaye\" or \"mayolé\") from Martinique and Guadeloupe. The footwork is similar in theory to the Brazilian \"ginga\", but has a more stomping motion.\n\nThe combat system of \"maní\" encompasses techniques such as low kicks, foot sweeps, punches, head-butts, elbow strikes, and strikes with the forearms, knees, and palms, as well as the cartwheel. Each fight ends in a sweep, take down or grappling maneuver.\n\n\"Maní\" may also use weapons such as a cane staff (used similarly to those of \"calinda\"-style stick-fighting in Trinidad and other Caribbean locales), as well as knives, including the machete and double machete. The stick used is about the thickness of a sugar cane (whether made of that traditional material or not), and about 16 inches (40 cm) long. The original martial art form of \"juego de maní\" risked particular danger, because the dancer/fighter sometimes wore leather wrist covers, \"muñequeras\", that were adorned with nails and other sorts of metal.\n\nThe rhythm of the dance/fight is based on the rhythm that is played by the musicians, and accompanying musicians are expected to synchronize drumming accents with movement accents in the performance. This form was popular in Matanzas and Las Villas provinces and featured circling, competitive male dancing, which influenced non-combative, social dances that were created in Cuba, such as \"rumba Columbia\".\n\nThe music utilized in \"juego de maní\" is that of Palo Monte, or simply Palo, an Afro-Cuban religion. One of the most popular \"maní\" songs is \"Vamos a la guerra si maní\" ('We go to war if [there is] \"maní\"').\n\nSkilled practitioners are called \"\". A grandmaster of the art who still teaches in Cuba is Juan de Dios Ramos Morejón, the founder-director of Cuban folkloric dance company Raices Profundas ('Deep Roots'). De Dios grew up fighting in the streets of Cuba and he has been called a \"living encyclopedia\" of the art, when he chooses to teach it. He has been an ambassador of Afro-Cuban music and martial arts for many years, having traveled to teach in places as diverse as Germany, Japan, the United States, and Mexico. His Puerto Rican New Yorker protegé Miguel Quijano (a current mani teacher and instructional author) notes De Dios as also a \"santero\", and a ceremonial singer \"versed in Yoruba, Palo, Abakua, and Arara traditions, known throughout Cuba\".\n\nDe Dios was in turn a student, with seven others, of the great \"manisero\" Argeliers Leon. Quijano writes of the eight graduates of Leon that they \"knew the art ... in its entirety\", as both a dance form and a martial art, and were founding members of the Conjunto Folklorico Nacional (Cuba's 'National Folkloric Connection' dance organization), where they taught \"a folkloric version\", i.e. one oriented to dance performance.\n\nIt is through these folklorical groups that Palo and \"maní\" are kept alive. Although a few masters still exist in Cuba, not many truly understand the fighting aspects of the art over the folkloric dance version. According to Quijano, who has studied under several of them, the only living master \"maniseros\" are Juan de Dios, Carlos Aldama, and Rogelio Martinez Fure (he also counts Cuban journalist Alberto Pedro, but as a retired practitioner).\n"}

Born in Emesa, Syria (modern day Homs), Maesa was the daughter of the high priest of Emesa's Temple of the Sun, and the elder sister of future Roman empress Julia Domna.\n\nThrough her sister's marriage, she became sister-in law to the emperor Septimius Severus and later the aunt of emperors Caracalla and Geta. She herself married fellow Syrian Julius Avitus, who was of consular rank. She bore him two daughters, Julia Soaemias and Julia Mamaea, who would later became mothers of emperors Elagabalus and Severus Alexander respectively.\n\nThe Severan dynasty of ancient Rome was dominated by powerful women, one of which was Julia Maesa. Politically able and ruthless, she contended for political power after her sister's suicide. She is best known for her plotting and scheming which resulted in the restoration of the Severan dynasty to the Roman throne after the assassination of Caracalla and the usurpation of the Roman throne by Macrinus, after which she continued to shape and dominate the politics of the Roman Empire for well over two decades, being the major power behind the Roman throne in the subsequent reigns of Elagabalus and Severus Alexander until her death.\n\nJulia Maesa died in Rome at an uncertain date between 223 and 226, and was later deified in Syria along with her sister.\n\nJulia Maesa was born in 7 May before around 160AD, the elder daughter of the priest Julius Bassianus in Emesa, Syria, modern day Homs. She had a younger sister, Julia Domna who would later become Roman empress after her marriage to Septimius Severus who was by the time of their marriage a senator.\n\nAs she was an Arab, her cognomen, Maesa, is the feminine nomen agentis of the Arabic verb \"masa\" which signifies walking with a swinging gait. This would be an appropriate female name as the verb from which it was derived was used by Arab poets to describe the figures of the women that they write about.\n\nShe later married a fellow Syrian, Julius Avitus, a consul who also served as provincial governor in the empire. She bore him two daughters, her eldest daughter, Julia Soaemias, was born around 180 AD or some time before, and was followed by another daughter, Julia Mamaea not long after.\n\nAlthough no written account describing her appearance survives, her sharp and formidable features, which contradict the soft and sensitive ones of her sister, are well displayed on the coins minted during the reign of her grandchildren.\n\nAfter her sister's arrival to Rome and the beginning of her tenure as empress consort, Maesa, accompanied by her family, traveled to Rome where they took up residence in the imperial court, although her husband, Julius Avitus who held several important posts did not stay in Rome for long and had to make many travels across the empire, which she did not accompany him on.\n\nDuring their stay in Rome, she and her family amassed extreme wealth and fortune, and rose highly in the Roman government and court of Septimius Severus and later, his son and successor Caracalla. Her two daughters attained a prominent position in court while their Syrian husbands held important posts as provincial governors and consuls, with Maesa's own husband along with that of her daughter rising from the Equestrian rank to reach Senatorial rank.\n\nIn 217 AD, after the murder of emperor Caracalla and the usurpation of the throne by Macrinus, Maesa's sister, Domna, now with none of the power or influence she held during the reigns of her husband and her son, suffering from breast cancer, and having lost both of her children, chose to commit suicide by starvation.\n\nMaesa and her family, who had resided in Rome for the last two decades, were spared and ordered by Macrinus to leave Rome and return to their home town of Emesa in Syria, likely because Macrinus wanted to avoid any action that would seem disloyal to Caracalla's memory to avoid any reprisals from the army. Macrinus made the crucial mistake of leaving Maesa's great wealth, amassed over a period of over 20 years intact, a decision which Macrinus would regret not long after.\n\nMaesa, who arrived in Emesa sometime between spring 217 and spring 218, vowed revenge, and Domna's suicide was still far off from ending the influence of the powerful women of the family.\n\nMacrinus was in a difficult position after Caracalla's assassination and was struggling to gain legitimacy and maintain loyalty to his rule. This encouraged Maesa, whose location, Emesa, which was close to a military base where many soldiers still held the Severans in high esteem and were loyal to the dynasty, aside from their discontent over Macrinus' peace with the Parthians, made it an excellent choice to launch a coup to restore her family to power.\n\nThe first step was to choose a male candidate from within the family to replace the usurper. Maesa's own husband has died in Cyprus shortly before 217, as well as her eldest daughter's husband. Julia Soaemias had a 14-year old son, Varius Avitus Bassianus, who was the hereditary priest of the Emesan sun god, and Maesa had a different future in mind for him. He had began attracting the soldiers of the Legio III Gallica stationed near Emesa, who would visit the city's temple occasionally to view the extravagant yet amusing religious rituals of Bassianus.\n\nNow even further encouraged by the attention of the soldiers, she proceeded with her plot by trying to challenge the legitimacy of the new emperor Macrinus, and she did so by claiming that the 14 year old, who greatly resembled Caracalla, was indeed the former emperor's bastard son and that Caracalla slept with both her daughters. The claim that Bassianus was the love child of Caracalla and Soaemias, despite almost certainly being untrue, was not so easily refuted, as aside from the young boy's resemblance to the emperor, Soaemias had been living in the Roman court at the time of Caracalla's reign, and Maesa seemed not to mind that this claim would be sacrificing the honor and reputation of her daughters as it was, after all, an effective move to further her plan.\n\nJulia Maesa began offering to distribute her great wealth and fortune to the loyal soldiers in exchange for their support, news of which began to spread throughout the army camps. Maesa, her daughter and Bassianus were taken into the army camp at night where the 14 year old boy was immediately acknowledged and hailed as emperor by the soldiers and clad in imperial purple.\n\nHistorian Cassius Dio narrates a slightly different version of events; he mentions a certain Gannys, who is not mentioned as partaking in the plot at any other source, as the main instigator of the revolt. Allegedly a 'youth who has not yet reached manhood', Dio claims he was raised by Maesa and was Soaemias' lover and the protector of her son, and at a certain night, dressed Bassianus in clothes worn by Caracalla as a child, took him to the army camp and claimed he was the murdered emperor's son without the knowledge of either Soaemias or Maesa.\n\nIt is hard to believe that Maesa and Soaemias, with much to gain from the young boy becoming emperor, would be completely unaware of the actions of Gannys. On the other hand, it's also unlikely that Maesa alone orchestrated the young boy's ascension. It's likely that Maesa in her plan had the support of many important figures from the city of Emesa and even some figures in Rome's ruling elite.\n\nWith the support of an entire legion, other legionnaires, prompted by discontent over pay, deserted Macrinus and joined Elagabalus' ranks as well. In response to the growing threat, Macrinus sent out a cavalry force under the command of Ulpius Julianus to try and regain control of the rebel soldiers. Rather than capturing the rebel forces, the cavalry instead killed Ulpius and defected to Elagabalus.\n\nFollowing these events, Macrinus traveled to Apamea to ensure the loyalty of Legio II \"Parthica\" before setting off to march against Emesa. According to Dio, Macrinus appointed his son Diadumenian to the position of Imperator, and promised the soldiers 20,000 Sesterces each, with 4,000 of these to be paid on the spot. Dio further says that Macrinus hosted a dinner for the residents of Apamea in honour of Diadumenian. At the dinner, Macrinus was supposedly presented with the head of Ulpius Julianus who had been killed by his soldiers. In response, Macrinus left Apamea and headed south.\n\nMacrinus' and Elagabalus' troops met somewhere near the border of Syria Coele and Syria Phoenice. Despite Macrinus' efforts to quell the rebellion at this engagement, his whole legion defected to Elagabalus forcing Macrinus to retire to Antioch. Elagabus took to the offensive and marched on Antioch.\n\nElagabalus' armies, commanded by the inexperienced but determined Gannys, engaged Macrinus' Praetorian Guard in a narrowly fought pitched battle. Gannys commanded at least two full legions and held numerical superiority over the fewer levies that Macrinus had been able to raise. Macrinus had ordered the Praetorian Guard to set aside their scaled armour breastplates and grooved shields in favour of lighter oval shields prior to the battle. This made them lighter and more manoeuvrable and negated any advantage light Parthian lancers had. The Praetorian Guards broke through the lines of Gannys' force, which turned to flee. During the retreat, however, Julia Maesa and Soaemias, in a surprising act of heroism joined the fray, leaping from their chariots to rally the retreating forces, while Gannys charged on horseback headlong into the enemy. These actions effectively ended the retreat; the troops resumed the assault with renewed morale, turning the tide of battle. Fearing defeat, Macrinus fled back to the city of Antioch, attempting escape before being executed in Cappadocia, while his son Diadumenian was captured en route in Zeugma, and executed as well.\n\nElagablus entered Antioch as its emperor, refraining the soldiers from sacking the city and sending a message to the senate who were forced to accept the young boy as their new emperor. Upon ascension he took up the name \"Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus\".\n\nAlthough now declared emperor, his claim was not uncontested, however, as several others laid claim to the Roman Throne. These included Verus the commander of Legio III Gallica who ironically was the first to proclaim Elagabalus as emperor, and Gellius Maximus the commander of Legio IV Scythica. These rebellions were quashed and their instigators executed.\n\nElagabalus spent the winter of 218-219 in Nicomedia before he set off to enter Rome. Maesa allegedly urged him to enter the capital draped in Roman clothes, but instead, he had a painting of him made as a priest making offerings to the Emesene deity El-Gabal. The painting was hanged right above the statue of Victoria in the senate, putting senators in the awkward position of having to make offerings to the Syrian deity whenever they wanted to make offerings to Victoria.\n\nBoth Maesa and her daughter Soaemias are featured heavily in all literary accounts of his reign, and are credited with much influence over the young emperor. Julia Maesa was honored with the titles of 'Augusta, mater castrorum et senatus' (empress, mother of the camp and the senate) and 'avia Augusti' (grandmother of the emperor).\n\nSoon, the young emperor was no longer popular with the praetorians, who did not approve of his revolting behavior and his odd religious rituals, and considering how their support was crucial for his rule to survive, this was an extremely dangerous development. Julia Maesa decided to take measures to prevent things from getting too out of hand. She convinced her grandson to adopt his cousin, her grandson Alexander, and declare him caesar, with the argument that it would leave more time for Elagabalus to devote himself to religious matters. The adoption of the 12 years old Alexander provided a strategic shift for the supporters of Elagablus, as some of the supporters felt it was no longer wise to tie their fate with that of the priest emperor and saw an alternative in his adopted son.\n\nWhatsoever, rivalry was soon increasing between the two boys and Elagabalus regretted adopting his more-popular cousin. The soldiers began to look more favorably upon Elagabalus' cousin, and the allies and supporters of the dynasty as well as the imperial family itself became divided, with Elagabalus and Soaemias on one side, and Mamaea, Maesa and Alexander on the other.\n\nBy the beginning of 222, Alexander and Elagabalus became so estranged with each other that they no longer appeared together in public. An assassination attempt against Alexander by Elagabalus enraged the praetorian guards who demanded an assurance for Alexander's safety from Elagabalus and the dismissal of some certain officials. Elagablus broke his promise, prompting the praetorian guard to slay Elagabalus and his mother, cutting their heads off and throwing aside their bodies. Alexander was now proclaimed emperor.\n\nA traditionally held belief is that while the new emperor was mainly involved in religious matters, Julia Maesa and her daughter were the ones effectively running the state. This claim has been treated with caution by contemporary historians such as Barabara Levick, as in ancient Rome, politics and religion were intertwined together and the rule of Elagabalus and the supremacy of his deity broke this relationship. In any case it's certain that Maesa had influence over the young boy, but Elagabalus' disagreements and neglect of advice from Maesa, who can be presented as an advocate of Roman traditionalism, has been reported and it may well be the cause of his downfall.\n\nIt is probable that Julia Maesa herself was responsible for the assassination of her daughter and grandson. This would certainly have been a painful sacrifice for Maesa to make but a necessary one to protect her family's grip on power and preserve the empire's stability.\n\nAlexander ascended the throne at the age of around 15, and he was kept in check by his mother and grandmother who were determined to erase the negative impression of Elagabalus. He was given the name Marcus Aurelius Severus Alexander to emphasize his relationship to Septimius Severus, the founder of the dynasty.\n\nThe epigraphical evidence during Severus Alexander's reign attests that the early years of his reign were dominated by his mother and grandmother, as inscriptions carrying the emperor's name referred to him as \"Juliae Mamaeae Aug(ustae) filio Juliae Maesae Aug(ustae) nepote\" (the son of Julia Mamaea and grandson of Julia Maesa).\n\nThe changes introduced by Maesa and her daughter included selecting a council of sixteen chosen for their moderation and experience to advise the young emperor, and the two Julias tried to restore a moderate and dignified form of government. The eastern religious practices introduced by the former emperor were eradicated in Rome and his religious edicts were reversed, the sacred stone of El-Gabal was returned to Emesa and the vast temple which had been dedicated to him by Elagabalus was rededicated to Jupiter.\n\nThe most certain date of her death is likely between November 224 and 227. Her death deprived her daughter, Julia Mamaea, not only of a mother but also of a political mentor and colleague, and Julia Mamaea was now alone in charge of the imperial government.\n\nLike her sister Julia Domna before her was, Julia Maesa was deified. In the \"Feriale Duranum\", the list of religious observances of the \"Cohors XX Palmyrenorum\", dating to AD, Maesa is made a supplication on her birthday which is the 7th of May. Coins commemorating her deification show her borne aloft on the back of a peacock. Unfortunately the coins are undated, but she also appears deified on the \"Acta Fratrum Arvalium\" of 7 November in 224, which lists the number of gods and goddesses the \"Arval Brethren\" made sacrifices to on that certain date.\n\nThere is a hotel in the Old City of Damascus named after the empress.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24720893", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24720893", "title": "Kali Puja", "text": "Kali Puja\n\nKali Puja, also known as Shyama Puja or Mahanisha Puja, is a festival dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kali, celebrated on the new moon day of the Hindu month Kartik especially in West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, Assam, Tripura and Bangladesh. It coincides with the rest-of-Indian Lakshmi Puja day of Diwali. While the Bengalis, Odias, Assamese and Maithils adore goddess Kali on this day the rest of India worships goddess Lakshmi on Diwali. Mahanisha puja is performed by the Maithili people of Mithila region in India and Nepal.\n\nThe festival of Kali Puja is not an ancient one. Kali Puja was practically unknown before the 18th century; however, a late 17th-century devotional text Kalika mangalkavya –by Balram mentions an annual festival dedicated to Kali. It was introduced in Bengal during the 18th century, by King (Raja) Krishnachandra of Navadvipa. Kali Puja gained popularity in the 19th century, with Krishanachandra’s grandson Ishvarchandra and the Bengali elite; wealthy landowners began patronizing the festival on a grand scale. Along with Durga Puja, Kali Puja is the biggest festival in Bengal and Assam.\n\nKali Puja (like Durga Puja) worshippers honour the goddess Kali in their homes in the form of clay sculptures and in \"pandal\"s (temporary shrines or open pavilions). She is worshipped at night with Tantric rites and mantras. She is prescribed offerings of red hibiscus flowers, animal blood in a skull, sweets, rice and lentils, fish and meat. It is prescribed that a worshipper should meditate throughout the night until dawn. Homes and pandals may also practice rites in the \"Brahmanical\" (mainstream Hindu-style, non-Tantric) tradition with ritual dressing of Kali in her form as Adya Shakti Kali and no animals are sacrificed. She is offered food and sweets made of rice, lentils and fruits. However in Tantric tradition, Animals are ritually sacrificed on Kali Puja day and offered to the goddess. A celebration of Kali Puja in Kolkata , Bhubaneswar and in Guwahati is also held in a large cremation ground where she is believed to dwell.\n\nThe \"pandal\"s also house images of god Shiva - the consort of Kali, Ramakrishna and Bamakhepa- two famous Bengali Kali devotees along with scenes from mythology of Kali and her various forms along with Mahavidyas, sometimes considered as the \"ten Kalis.\" The Mahavidyas is a group of ten Tantric goddesses headed by Kali. People visit these \"pandals\" throughout the night. Kali Puja is also the time for magic shows and theatre, fireworks. Recent custom has incorporated wine consumption.\n\nIn the Kalighat Temple in Kolkata, Kalikhetra Temple in Bhubaneswar and in Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati, Kali is worshipped as Lakshmi on this day so as to reflect an essence of Vaishnava Haldars on Kali worship. Goddess Lakshmi is worshipped in her three forms, Maha Lakshmi, Maha Kali and Maha Saraswati on this day.The temple is visited by thousands of devotees who offer animal sacrifices to the goddess. Another famous temple dedicated to Kali in Kolkata is Dakshineswar Kali Temple. The famous Kali devotee Ramakrishna was a priest at this temple. The celebrations have changed little from his time.\n\nAlthough the widely popular annual Kali Puja celebration, also known as the \"Dipanwita Kali Puja\", is celebrated on the new moon day of the month of Kartika, Kali is also worshipped in other new moon days too. Two other major Kali Puja observations are \"Ratanti Kali Puja\" and \"Phalaharini Kali Puja\". Ratanti puja is celebrated on Magha Krishna Chaturdashi and Phalaharini puja is celebrated on Jyeshta Amavashya of Bengali calendar. The \"Phalaharini Kali Puja\" is specially important in the life of the saint Ramakrishna and his wife Sarada Devi, since on this day in 1872, Ramakrishna worshipped Sarada Devi as the goddess Shodashi. In many Bengali and Assamese households, Kali is worshipped daily.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18664", "title": "Louis Riel", "text": "Louis Riel\n\nLouis David Riel (; ; 22 October 1844 – 16 November 1885) was a Canadian politician, a founder of the province of Manitoba, and a political leader of the Métis people of the Canadian Prairies. He led two rebellions against the government of Canada and its first post-Confederation prime minister, John A. Macdonald. Riel sought to preserve Métis rights and culture as their homelands in the Northwest came progressively under the Canadian sphere of influence. Over the decades, he has been made a folk hero by Francophones, Catholic nationalists, native rights activists, and the New Left student movement. Arguably, Riel has received more scholarly attention than any other figure in Canadian history.\n\nThe first resistance led by Riel became known as the Red River Rebellion of 1869–1870. The provisional government established by Riel ultimately negotiated the terms under which the modern province of Manitoba entered the Canadian Confederation. Riel ordered the execution of Thomas Scott, and fled to the United States to escape prosecution. Despite this, he is frequently referred to as the \"Father of Manitoba\". While a fugitive, he was elected three times to the House of Commons of Canada, although he never assumed his seat. During these years, he was frustrated by having to remain in exile despite his growing belief that he was a divinely chosen leader and prophet, a belief which would later resurface and influence his actions. Because of this new religious conviction, Catholic leaders who had supported him before increasingly repudiated him. He married in 1881 while in exile in Montana in the United States; he fathered three children.\n\nIn 1884 Riel was called upon by the Métis leaders in Saskatchewan to articulate their grievances to the Canadian government. Instead he organized a military resistance that escalated into a military confrontation, the North-West Rebellion of 1885. Ottawa used the new rail lines to send in thousands of combat soldiers. It ended in his arrest and conviction for high treason. Despite protests and popular appeals, Prime Minister Macdonald rejected calls for clemency, and Riel was executed by hanging. Riel was seen as a heroic victim by French Canadians; his execution had a lasting negative impact on Canada, polarizing the new nation along ethno-religious lines. Although only a few hundred people were directly affected by the Rebellion in Saskatchewan, the long-term result was that the Prairie provinces would be controlled by the Anglophones, not the Francophones. An even more important long-term impact was the bitter alienation Francophones across Canada felt, and anger against the repression by their countrymen.\n\nRiel's historical reputation has long been polarized between portrayals as a dangerous half-insane religious fanatic and rebel against the Canadian nation, or by contrast a heroic rebel who fought to protect his Francophone people from the unfair encroachments of an Anglophone national government. He is increasingly celebrated as a proponent of multiculturalism, although that downplays his primary commitment to Métis nationalism and political independence.\n\nThe Red River Settlement was a community in Rupert's Land nominally administered by the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), and largely inhabited by First Nations tribes and the Métis, an ethnic group of mixed Cree, Ojibwa, Saulteaux, French-Canadian, Scottish, and English descent. Louis Riel was born there in 1844, near modern Winnipeg, Manitoba, to Louis Riel, Sr. and Julie Lagimodière.\n\nRiel was the eldest of eleven children in a locally well-respected family. His father, who was of Franco-Ojibwa Métis descent, had gained prominence in this community by organizing a group that supported Guillaume Sayer, a Métis imprisoned for challenging the HBC's historical trade monopoly. Sayer's eventual release due to agitations by Louis Sr.'s group effectively ended the monopoly, and the name Riel was therefore well known in the Red River area. His mother was the daughter of Jean-Baptiste Lagimodière and Marie-Anne Gaboury, one of the earliest white families to settle in the Red River Settlement in 1812. The Riels were noted for their devout Catholicism and strong family ties.\n\nRiel was first educated by Roman Catholic priests at St. Boniface. At age 13 he came to the attention of Alexandre Taché, the Suffragan Bishop of St. Boniface, who was eagerly promoting the priesthood for talented young Métis. In 1858 Taché arranged for Riel to attend the Petit Séminaire of the Collège de Montréal, under the direction of the Sulpician order. Descriptions of him at the time indicate that he was a fine scholar of languages, science, and philosophy, but exhibited a frequent and unpredictable moodiness.\n\nFollowing news of his father's premature death in 1864, Riel lost interest in the priesthood and withdrew from the college in March 1865. For a time, he continued his studies as a day student in the convent of the Grey Nuns, but was soon asked to leave, following breaches of discipline. He remained in Montreal for over a year, living at the home of his aunt, Lucie Riel. Impoverished by the death of his father, Riel took employment as a law clerk in the Montreal office of Rodolphe Laflamme. During this time he was involved in a failed romance with a young woman named Marie–Julie Guernon. This progressed to the point of Riel having signed a contract of marriage, but his fiancée's family opposed her involvement with a Métis, and the engagement was soon broken. Compounding this disappointment, Riel found legal work unpleasant and, by early 1866, he had resolved to leave Canada East. Some of his friends said later that he worked odd jobs in Chicago, Illinois, while staying with poet Louis-Honoré Fréchette, and wrote poems himself in the manner of Lamartine, and that he was briefly employed as a clerk in Saint Paul, Minnesota, before returning to the Red River settlement on 26 July 1868.\n\nThe majority population of the Red River had historically been Métis and First Nation people. Upon his return, Riel found that religious, nationalistic, and racial tensions were exacerbated by an influx of Anglophone Protestant settlers from Ontario. The political situation was also uncertain, as ongoing negotiations for the transfer of Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company to Canada had not addressed the political terms of transfer. Finally, despite warnings to the Macdonald government from Bishop Taché and the HBC governor William Mactavish that any such activity would precipitate unrest, the Canadian minister of public works, William McDougall, ordered a survey of the area. The arrival on 20 August 1869 of a survey party headed by Colonel John Stoughton Dennis increased anxiety among the Métis. The Métis did not possess title to their land, which was in any case laid out according to the seigneurial system rather than in English-style square lots.\n\nIn late August, Riel denounced the survey in a speech, and on 11 October 1869, the survey's work was disrupted by a group of Métis that included Riel. This group organized itself as the \"Métis National Committee\" on 16 October, with Riel as secretary and John Bruce as president. When summoned by the HBC-controlled Council of Assiniboia to explain his actions, Riel declared that any attempt by Canada to assume authority would be contested unless Ottawa had first negotiated terms with the Métis. Nevertheless, the non-bilingual McDougall was appointed the lieutenant governor-designate, and attempted to enter the settlement on 2 November. McDougall's party was turned back near the Canada–US border, and on the same day, Métis led by Riel seized Fort Garry.\n\nOn 6 November, Riel invited Anglophones to attend a convention alongside Métis representatives to discuss a course of action, and on 1 December he proposed to this convention a list of rights to be demanded as a condition of union. Much of the settlement came to accept the Métis point of view, but a passionately pro-Canadian minority began organizing in opposition. Loosely constituted as the Canadian Party, this group was led by John Christian Schultz, Charles Mair, Colonel John Stoughton Dennis, and a more reticent Major Charles Boulton. McDougall attempted to assert his authority by authorizing Dennis to raise a contingent of armed men, but the Anglophone settlers largely ignored this call to arms. Schultz, however, attracted approximately fifty recruits and fortified his house and store. Riel ordered Schultz's home surrounded, and the outnumbered Canadians soon surrendered and were imprisoned in Upper Fort Garry.\n\nHearing of the unrest, Ottawa sent three emissaries to the Red River, including HBC representative Donald Alexander Smith. While they were en route, the Métis National Committee declared a provisional government on 8 December, with Riel becoming its president on 27 December. Meetings between Riel and the Ottawa delegation took place on 5 and 6 January 1870, but when these proved fruitless, Smith chose to present his case in a public forum. Smith assured large audiences of the Government's goodwill in meetings on 19 and 20 January, leading Riel to propose the formation of a new convention split evenly between French and English settlers to consider Smith's instructions. On 7 February, a new list of rights was presented to the Ottawa delegation, and Smith and Riel agreed to send representatives to Ottawa to engage in direct negotiations on that basis. The provisional government established by Louis Riel published its own newspaper titled \"New Nation\" and established the Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia to pass laws. The Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia was the first elected government at the Red River Settlement and functioned from March 9 to June 24, 1870. The assembly had 28 elected representatives, including a president, Louis Riel, an executive council (government cabinet), adjutant general (chief of military staff), chief justice and clerk. \n\nDespite the apparent progress on the political front, the Canadian party continued to plot against the provisional government. However, they suffered a setback on 17 February, when forty-eight men, including Boulton and Thomas Scott, were arrested near Fort Garry.\nBoulton was tried by a tribunal headed by Ambroise-Dydime Lépine and sentenced to death for his interference with the provisional government. He was pardoned, but Scott interpreted this as weakness by the Métis, whom he regarded with open contempt. After Scott repeatedly quarreled with his guards, they insisted that he be tried for insubordination. At his court martial he was found guilty and was sentenced to death. Riel was repeatedly entreated to commute the sentence, but Riel responded, \"I have done three good things since I have commenced: I have spared Boulton's life at your instance, I pardoned Gaddy, and now I shall shoot Scott.\"\n\nScott was executed by firing squad on 4 March. Riel's motivations have been the cause of much speculation, but his own justification was that he felt it necessary to demonstrate to the Canadians that the Métis must be taken seriously. Protestant Canada did take notice, swore revenge, and set up a \"Canada First\" movement to mobilize their anger.\n\nThe delegates representing the provisional government departed for Ottawa in March. Although they initially met with legal difficulties arising from the execution of Scott, they soon entered into direct talks with Macdonald and George-Étienne Cartier. An agreement enshrining the demands in the list of rights was quickly reached, and this formed the basis for the Manitoba Act of 12 May 1870, which formally admitted Manitoba into the Canadian confederation. However, the negotiators could not secure a general amnesty for the provisional government.\n\nAs a means of exercising Canadian authority in the settlement and dissuading American expansionists, a Canadian military expedition under Colonel Garnet Wolseley was dispatched to the Red River. Although the government described it as an \"errand of peace\", Riel learned that Canadian militia elements in the expedition meant to lynch him, and he fled as the expedition approached the Red River. The arrival of the expedition on 20 August marked the effective end of the Red River Rebellion.\n\nIt was not until 2 September 1870 that the new lieutenant-governor Adams George Archibald arrived and set about the establishment of civil government. Without an amnesty, and with the Canadian militia beating and intimidating his sympathisers, Riel fled to the safety of the St. Joseph's mission across the Canada–US border in the Dakota Territory. However the results of the first provincial election in December 1870 were promising for Riel, as many of his supporters came to power. Nevertheless, stress and financial troubles precipitated a serious illness—perhaps a harbinger of his future mental afflictions—that prevented his return to Manitoba until May 1871. The settlement now faced a possible threat, from cross-border Fenian raids coordinated by his former associate William Bernard O'Donoghue. Archibald proclaimed a general call to arms on 4 October. Companies of armed horsemen were raised, including one led by Riel. When Archibald reviewed the troops in St. Boniface, he made the significant gesture of publicly shaking Riel's hand, signaling that a rapprochement had been affected. This was not to be—when this news reached Ontario, Mair and members of the Canada First movement whipped up anti-Riel (and anti-Archibald) sentiment. With Federal elections coming in 1872, Macdonald could ill afford further rift in Quebec–Ontario relations and so he did not offer an amnesty. Instead he quietly arranged for Taché to offer Riel a bribe of $1,000 to remain in voluntary exile. This was supplemented by an additional £600 from Smith for the care of Riel's family.\n\nNevertheless, by late June Riel was back in Manitoba and was soon persuaded to run as a member of parliament for the electoral district of Provencher. However, following the early September defeat of George-Étienne Cartier in his home riding in Quebec, Riel stood aside so that Cartier—on record as being in favour of amnesty for Riel—might secure a seat in Provencher. Cartier won by acclamation, but Riel's hopes for a swift resolution to the amnesty question were dashed following Cartier's death on 20 May 1873. In the ensuing by-election in October 1873, Riel ran unopposed as an Independent, although he had again fled, a warrant having been issued for his arrest in September. Lépine was not so lucky; he was captured and faced trial.\n\nRiel made his way to Montreal and, fearing arrest or assassination, vacillated as to whether he should attempt to take up his seat in the House of Commons—Edward Blake, the Premier of Ontario, had announced a bounty of $5,000 for his arrest. Famously, Riel was the only Member of Parliament who was not present for the great Pacific Scandal debate of 1873 that led to the resignation of the Macdonald government in November. Liberal leader Alexander Mackenzie became the interim prime minister, and a general election was held in January 1874. Although the Liberals under Mackenzie formed the new government, Riel easily retained his seat. Formally, Riel had to sign a register book at least once upon being elected, and he did so under disguise in late January. He was nevertheless stricken from the rolls following a motion supported by Schultz, who had become the member for the electoral district of Lisgar.\nUndeterred, Riel prevailed again in the resulting by-election, and although again expelled, his symbolic point had been made and public opinion in Quebec was strongly tipped in his favour.\n\nDuring this period, Riel had been staying with priests of the Oblate order in Plattsburgh, New York, who introduced him to Father Fabien Martin \"dit\" Barnabé in the nearby village of Keeseville. It was here that he received news of Lépine's fate: following his trial for the murder of Scott, which had begun on 13 October 1874, Lépine was found guilty and sentenced to death. This sparked outrage in the sympathetic Quebec press, and calls for amnesty for both Lépine and Riel were renewed. This presented a severe political difficulty for Mackenzie, who was hopelessly caught between the demands of Quebec and Ontario. However, a solution was forthcoming when, acting on his own initiative, the Governor General Lord Dufferin commuted Lépine's sentence in January 1875. This opened the door for Mackenzie to secure from parliament an amnesty for Riel, on the condition that he remain in exile for five years.\n\nDuring his time of exile, he was primarily concerned with religious rather than political matters. Spurred on by a sympathetic Roman Catholic priest in Quebec, he was increasingly influenced by his belief that he was a divinely chosen leader of the Métis. Modern biographers have speculated that he may have suffered from the psychological condition megalomania. His mental state deteriorated, and following a violent outburst he was taken to Montreal, where he was under the care of his uncle, John Lee, for a few months. But after Riel disrupted a religious service, Lee arranged to have him committed in an asylum in Longue Pointe on 6 March 1876 under the assumed name \"Louis R. David\". Fearing discovery, his doctors soon transferred him to the Beauport Asylum near Quebec City under the name \"Louis Larochelle\". While he suffered from sporadic irrational outbursts, he continued his religious writing, composing theological tracts with an admixture of Christian and Judaic ideas. He consequently began calling himself Louis \"David\" Riel, prophet of the new world, and he would pray (standing) for hours, having servants help him to hold his arms in the shape of a cross. Nevertheless, he slowly recovered, and was released from the asylum on 23 January 1878 with an admonition to lead a quiet life. He returned for a time to Keeseville, where he became involved in a passionate romance with Evelina Martin \"dite\" Barnabé, sister of his friend, the oblate father Fabien Barnabé. But with insufficient means to propose marriage, Riel returned to the west, hoping that she might follow. However, she decided that she would be unsuited to prairie life, and their correspondence soon ended.\n\nIn the fall of 1878, Riel returned to St. Paul, and briefly visited his friends and family. This was a time of rapid change for the Métis of the Red River—the buffalo on which they depended were becoming increasingly scarce, the influx of settlers was ever-increasing, and much land was sold to unscrupulous land speculators. Like other Red River Métis who had left Manitoba, Riel headed further west to start a new life. Travelling to the Montana Territory, he became a trader and interpreter in the area surrounding Fort Benton. Observing rampant alcoholism and its detrimental impact on the Native American and Métis people, he engaged in an unsuccessful attempt to curtail the whisky trade. In 1881, he married Marguerite Monet \"dit\" Bellehumeur (1861–1886), a young Métis, \"in the fashion of the country\" on 28 April, an arrangement that was solemnized on 9 March 1882 at Carroll, Montana by Father Damiani. They were to have three children: Jean-Louis (1882–1908); Marie-Angélique (1883–1897); and a boy who was born and died on 21 October 1885, less than one month before Riel was hanged.\n\nRiel soon became involved in the politics of Montana, and in 1882, actively campaigned on behalf of the Republican Party. He brought a suit against a Democrat for rigging a vote, but was then himself accused of fraudulently inducing British subjects to take part in the election. In response, Riel applied for United States citizenship and was naturalized on 16 March 1883. With two young children, he had by 1884 settled down and was teaching school at the St. Peter's Jesuit mission in the Sun River district of Montana.\n\nFollowing the Red River Rebellion, Métis travelled west and settled in the Saskatchewan Valley, especially along the south branch of the river in the country surrounding the Saint-Laurent mission (near modern St. Laurent de Grandin, Saskatchewan). But by the 1880s, it had become clear that westward migration was no panacea for the troubles of the Métis and the plains Indians. The rapid collapse of the buffalo herd was causing near starvation among the Plains Cree and Blackfoot First Nations. This was exacerbated by a reduction in government assistance in 1883, and by a general failure of Ottawa to live up to its treaty obligations. The Métis were likewise obliged to give up the hunt and take up agriculture—but this transition was accompanied by complex issues surrounding land claims similar to those that had previously arisen in Manitoba. Moreover, settlers from Europe and the eastern provinces were also moving into the Saskatchewan territories, and they too had complaints related to the administration of the territories. Virtually all parties therefore had grievances, and by 1884 English settlers, Anglo-Métis and Métis communities were holding meetings and petitioning a largely unresponsive government for redress. In the electoral district of Lorne, a meeting of the south branch Métis was held in the village of Batoche on 24 March, and thirty representatives voted to ask Riel to return and represent their cause. On 6 May a joint \"Settler's Union\" meeting was attended by both the Métis and English-speaking representatives from Prince Albert, including William Henry Jackson, an Ontario settler sympathetic to the Métis and known to them as Honoré Jackson, and James Isbister of the Anglo-Métis. It was here resolved to send a delegation to ask Riel's assistance in presenting their grievances to the Canadian government.\n\nThe head of the delegation to Riel was Gabriel Dumont, a respected buffalo hunter and leader of the Saint-Laurent Métis who had known Riel in Manitoba. James Isbister was the lone Anglo-Métis delegate. Riel was easily swayed to support their cause—which was perhaps not surprising in view of Riel's continuing conviction that he was the divinely selected leader of the Métis and the prophet of a new form of Christianity. Riel also intended to use the new position of influence to pursue his own land claims in Manitoba. The party departed 4 June, and arrived back at Batoche on 5 July. Upon his arrival Métis and English settlers alike formed an initially favourable impression of Riel following a series of speeches in which he advocated moderation and a reasoned approach. During June 1884, the Plains Cree leaders Big Bear and Poundmaker were independently formulating their complaints, and subsequently held meetings with Riel. However, the Native grievances were quite different from those of the settlers, and nothing was then resolved. Inspired by Riel, Honoré Jackson and representatives of other communities set about drafting a petition, and Jackson on 28 July released a manifesto detailing grievances and the settler's objectives. A joint English-Métis central committee with Jackson acting as secretary worked to reconcile proposals from different communities. In the interim, Riel's support began to waver. As Riel's religious pronouncements became increasingly heretical the clergy distanced themselves, and father Alexis André cautioned Riel against mixing religion and politics. Also, in response to bribes by territorial lieutenant-governor and Indian commissioner Edgar Dewdney, local English-language newspapers adopted an editorial stance critical of Riel. Nevertheless, the work continued, and on 16 December Riel forwarded the committee's petition to the government, along with the suggestion that delegates be sent to Ottawa to engage in direct negotiation. Receipt of the petition was acknowledged by Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau, Macdonald's Secretary of State, although Macdonald himself would later deny having ever seen it. By then many original followers had left; only 250 remained at Batoche when it fell in May 1885.\n\nHistorian Donald Creighton has argued that Riel had become a changed man:\n\nWhile Riel awaited news from Ottawa he considered returning to Montana, but had by February resolved to stay. Without a productive course of action, Riel began to engage in obsessive prayer, and was experiencing a significant relapse of his mental agitations. This led to a deterioration in his relationship with the Catholic hierarchy, as he publicly espoused an increasingly heretical doctrine. On 11 February 1885, a response to the petition was received. The government proposed to take a census of the North-West Territories, and to form a commission to investigate grievances. This angered a faction of the Métis who saw it as a mere delaying tactic; they favoured taking up arms at once. Riel became the leader of this faction, but he lost the support of almost all Anglophones and Anglo-Métis, the Catholic Church, and the great majority of Indians. He also lost the support of the Métis faction supporting local leader Charles Nolin. But Riel, undoubtedly influenced by his messianic delusions, became increasingly supportive of this course of action. In the church at Saint-Laurent on 15 March, Riel disrupted a sermon to argue for this position, following which he was barred from receiving the sacraments. He took more and more about his \"divine revelations\". But disenchanted with the status quo, and swayed by Riel's charisma and eloquent rhetoric, hundreds of Métis remained loyal to Riel, despite his proclamations that Bishop Ignace Bourget should be accepted as pope, and that \"Rome has fallen\".\n\nAt his trial, Riel denied allegations that his religious beliefs were as irrational as was being (and continue to be) alleged. He explained as follows:\n\n\"I wish to leave Rome aside, inasmuch as it is the cause of division between Catholics and Protestants. I did not wish to force my views...If I could have any influence in the new world it would be to help in that way, even if it takes 200 years to become practical...so my children's children can shake hands with the Protestants of the new world in a friendly manner. I do not wish those evils which exist in Europe to be continued, as much as I can influence it, among the (Metis). I do not wish that to be repeated in America.\n\nOn 18 March it became known that the North-West Mounted Police garrison at Battleford was being reinforced. Although only 100 men had been sent in response to warnings from father Alexis André and NWMP superintendent L.N.F. Crozier, a rumour soon began to circulate that 500 heavily armed troops were advancing on the territory. Métis patience was exhausted, and Riel's followers seized arms, took hostages, and cut the telegraph lines between Batoche and Battleford. The Provisional Government of Saskatchewan was declared at Batoche on 19 March, with Riel as the political and spiritual leader and with Dumont assuming responsibility for military affairs. Riel formed a council called the Exovedate (a neologism meaning \"those who have left the flock\"), and sent representatives to court Poundmaker and Big Bear. On 21 March, Riel's emissaries demanded that Crozier surrender Fort Carlton, but this was refused. The situation was becoming critical, and on 23 March Dewdney sent a telegraph to Macdonald indicating that military intervention might be necessary. Scouting near Duck Lake on 26 March, a force led by Gabriel Dumont unexpectedly chanced upon a party from Fort Carlton. In the ensuing Battle of Duck Lake, the police were routed, and the Natives also rose up once the news became known. The die was cast for a violent outcome, and the North-West Rebellion was begun in earnest.\nRiel had counted on the Canadian government being unable to effectively respond to another uprising in the distant North-West Territories, thereby forcing them to accept political negotiation. This was essentially the same strategy that had worked to such great effect during the 1870 rebellion. In that instance, the first troops did not arrive until three months after Riel seized control. However, Riel had completely overlooked the significance of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Despite some uncompleted gaps, the first Canadian regular and militia units, under the command of Major-General Frederick Dobson Middleton, arrived in Duck Lake less than two weeks after Riel had made his demands.\n\nKnowing that he could not defeat the Canadians in direct confrontation, Dumont had hoped to force the Canadians to negotiate by engaging in a long-drawn out campaign of guerrilla warfare; Dumont realised a modest success along these lines at the Battle of Fish Creek on 24 April 1885. Riel, however, insisted on concentrating forces at Batoche to defend his \"city of God\". The outcome of the ensuing Battle of Batoche which took place from 9 to 12 May was never in doubt, and on 15 May a disheveled Riel surrendered to Canadian forces. Although Big Bear's forces managed to hold out until the Battle of Loon Lake on 3 June, the rebellion was a dismal failure for Métis and Natives alike, as they surrendered or fled.\n\nSeveral individuals closely tied to the government requested that the trial be held in Winnipeg in July 1885. Some historians contend that the trial was moved to Regina because of concerns with the possibility of an ethnically mixed and sympathetic jury. Tom Flanagan states that an amendment of the North-West Territories Act (which dropped the provision that trials with crimes punishable by death should be tried in Manitoba) meant that the trial could be convened within the North-West Territories and did not have to be held in Winnipeg. \n\nPrime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald ordered the trial to be convened in Regina, where Riel was tried before a jury of six English and Scottish Protestants, all from the area surrounding the city. The trial began on 28 July 1885, and lasted five days. Riel delivered two long speeches during his trial, defending his own actions and affirming the rights of the Métis people. He rejected his lawyer's attempt to argue that he was not guilty by reason of insanity, asserting,\n\nThe jury found him guilty but recommended mercy; nonetheless, Judge Hugh Richardson sentenced him to death, with the date of his execution initially set for 18 September 1885. \"We tried Riel for treason,\" one juror later said, \"And he was hanged for the murder of Scott.\" \n\nBoulton writes in his memoirs that, as the date of his execution approached, Riel regretted his opposition to the defence of insanity and vainly attempted to provide evidence that he was not sane. Requests for a retrial and an appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Britain were denied. Sir John A. Macdonald, who was instrumental in upholding Riel's sentence, is famously quoted as saying:\n\nBefore his execution, Riel was reconciled with the Catholic Church, and assigned Father André as his spiritual advisor. He was also given writing materials so that he could employ his time in prison to write a book. Louis Riel was hanged for treason on 16 November 1885 at the North-West Mounted Police barracks in Regina.\nBoulton writes of Riel's final moments,\n\nFollowing the execution, Riel's body was returned to his mother's home in St. Vital, where it lay in state. On 12 December 1886, his remains were laid in the churchyard of the Saint-Boniface Cathedral following the celebration of a requiem mass.\n\nThe trial and execution of Riel caused a bitter and prolonged reaction which convulsed Canadian politics for decades. The execution was both supported and opposed by the provinces. For example, Ontario (conservative) strongly supported Riel's execution, but Quebec was vehemently opposed to it. Francophones were upset Riel was hung because they thought his execution was a symbol of English dominance. The Orange Irish Protestant element in Ontario had demanded the execution as the punishment for Riel's treason and his execution of Thomas Scott in 1870. With their revenge satisfied, the Orange turned their attention to other matters (especially the Jesuit Estates proposal). In Quebec there was no forgetting, and the politician Honoré Mercier rose to power by mobilizing the opposition in 1886.\n\nRiel remains controversial. J. M. Bumsted in 2000 said that for Manitoba historian James Jackson, the murder of Scott – \"perhaps the result of Riel's incipient madness – was the great blemish on Riel's achievement, depriving him of his proper role as the father of Manitoba.\"\n\nThe Saskatchewan Métis' requested land grants were all provided by the government by the end of 1887, and the government resurveyed the Métis river lots in accordance with their wishes. The Métis did not understand the long term value of their new land, however, and it was soon bought by speculators who later turned huge profits from it. Riel's worst fears were realised—following the failed rebellion, the French language and Roman Catholic religion faced increasing marginalisation in both Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as exemplified by the controversy surrounding the Manitoba Schools Question. The Métis themselves were increasingly forced to live on undesirable land or in the shadow of Indian reserves (as they did not themselves have treaty status). Saskatchewan did not attain provincehood until 1905.\n\nRiel's execution and Macdonald's refusal to commute his sentence caused lasting discord in Quebec, and led to a fundamental alteration in the Canadian political order. In Quebec, Honoré Mercier exploited the discontent to reconstitute the Parti National. This party, which promoted Quebec nationalism, won a majority in the 1886 Quebec election by winning a number of seats formerly controlled by the Quebec Conservative Party. The federal election of 1887 likewise saw significant gains by the federal Liberals, again at the expense of the Conservatives. This led to the victory of the Liberal party under Sir Wilfrid Laurier in the federal election of 1896, which in turn set the stage for the domination of Canadian federal politics by the Liberal party in the 20th century.\n\nThat Riel's name still has resonance in Canadian politics was evidenced on 16 November 1994, when Suzanne Tremblay, a Bloc Québécois member of parliament, introduced private members' bill C-228, \"An Act to revoke the conviction of Louis David Riel\". The unsuccessful bill was widely perceived in English Canada as an attempt to arouse support for Quebec nationalism before the 1995 referendum on Quebec sovereignty.\nBill C-213 or Louis Riel Day Act and Bill C-417 Louis Riel Act are the more notable acts which have gone through parliament. Bill C-297 to revoke the conviction of Louis Riel was introduced to the House of Commons 21 October and 22 November 1996, however the motion lacked unanimous consent from the House and was dropped. Bill C-213 or the Louis Riel Day Act of 1997 attempted to revoke the conviction of Louis Riel for high treason and establish a National Day in his honour on 16 November. Bill C-417 or the Louis Riel Act which also had a first reading in parliament to revoke the conviction of Louis Riel, and establish 15 July as \"Louis Riel Day\" was tabled.\nOn 18 February 2008, the province of Manitoba officially recognized the first Louis Riel Day as a general provincial holiday. It will now fall on the third Monday of February each year in the Province of Manitoba.\n\nHistorians have debated the Riel case so often and so passionately that he is the most written-about person in all of Canadian history. Interpretations have varied dramatically over time. The first amateur English language histories hailed the triumph of civilization, represented by English-speaking Protestants, over savagery represented by the half-breed Métis who were Catholic and spoke French. Riel was portrayed as an insane traitor and an obstacle to the expansion of Canada to the West. By the mid-20th century academic historians had dropped the theme of savagery versus civilization, deemphasized the Métis, and focused on Riel, presenting his execution as a major cause of the bitter division in Canada along ethnocultural and geographical lines of religion and language. W. L. Morton says of the execution:\n\nMorton argued that Riel's demands were unrealistic:\n\nThe Catholic bishops had originally supported the Métis, but reversed themselves when they realized that Riel was leading a heretical movement. They made sure that he was not honored as a martyr. However the bishops lost their influence during the Quiet Revolution, and activists in Québec found in Riel the perfect hero, with the image now of a freedom fighter who stood up for his people against an oppressive government in the face of widespread racist bigotry. His insanity was ignored and he was made a folk hero by the Francophones, the Catholic nationalists, the native rights movement, and the New Left student movement. Activists who espoused violence embraced his image; in the 1960s, the Quebec terrorist group, the Front de libération du Québec adopted the name \"Louis Riel\" for one of its terrorist cells.\n\nAcross Canada there emerged a new interpretation of reality in his rebellion, holding that the Métis had major unresolved grievances; that the government was indeed unresponsive; that Riel resorted to violence only as a last resort; and he was given a questionable trial, then executed by a vengeful government. John Foster said in 1985 that:\n\nHowever, a leading specialist Thomas Flanagan reversed his views after editing Riel's writings:\n\nAs for the insanity, historians have noted that many religious leaders the past have exhibited behavior that looks exactly like insanity. Flanigan emphasizes that Riel exemplified the tradition of religious mystics involved in politics, especially those with a sense that the world was about to be totally transformed by their religious vision. In his case it meant his delivering the Métis from colonial domination. More broadly, Flanagan argues that Riel was devoutly religious and rejected equalitarianism (which he equated with secularism), concluding he was \"a millenarian theocrat, sympathetic to the 'ancien régime' and opposed to the French Revolution, democracy, individualism, and secular society.\"\n\nMétis scholars have noted that Riel is a more important figure to non-Métis than to Métis; he is the only Métis figure most non-Métis are aware of. Political scientists such as Thomas Flanagan have pointed out certain parallels between Riel's following during the North-West Rebellion and millenarian cults.\n\nA resolution was passed by Parliament on 10 March 1992 citing that Louis Riel was the founder of Manitoba.\nTwo statues of Riel are located in Winnipeg. One of the Winnipeg statues, the work of architect Étienne Gaboury and sculptor Marcien Lemay, depicts Riel as a naked and tortured figure. It was unveiled in 1970 and stood in the grounds of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for 23 years. After much outcry (especially from the Métis community) that the statue was an undignified misrepresentation, the statue was removed and placed at the Collège universitaire de Saint-Boniface. It was replaced in 1994 with a statue designed by Miguel Joyal depicting Riel as a dignified statesman. The unveiling ceremony was on 16 May 1996, in Winnipeg.\nA statue of Riel on the grounds of the Saskatchewan Legislative Building in Regina was installed and later removed for similar reasons.\n\nIn numerous communities across Canada, Riel is commemorated in the names of streets, schools, neighbourhoods, and other buildings. Examples in Winnipeg include the landmark Esplanade Riel pedestrian bridge linking Old Saint-Boniface with Winnipeg, the Louis Riel School Division, Louis Riel Avenue in Old Saint-Boniface, and Riel Avenue in St. Vital's Minnetonka neighbourhood (which is sometimes called Riel). The student centre and campus pub at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon are named after Riel (\"Place Riel\" and \"Louis\"', respectively). Highway 11, stretching from Regina to just south of Prince Albert, has been named \"Louis Riel Trail\" by the province; the roadway passes near locations of the 1885 rebellion. One of the student residences at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia is named Louis Riel House. There is a Louis Riel School in Calgary, Alberta. and Ottawa, Ontario.\nOn 26 September 2007, Manitoba legislature passed a bill establishing a statutory holiday on the third Monday in February as \"Louis Riel Day\", the same day some other provinces celebrate Family Day, beginning in 2008. The first Louis Riel Day was celebrated on 18 February 2008. This new statutory holiday coincides with the celebration on 15–24 February of the Festival du Voyageur.\n\nIn the spring of 2008, the Government of Saskatchewan Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Christine Tell proclaimed in Duck Lake that \"the 125th commemoration, in 2010, of the 1885 Northwest Resistance is an excellent opportunity to tell the story of the prairie Métis and First Nations peoples' struggle with Government forces and how it has shaped Canada today.\" One of three Territorial Government Buildings remains on Dewdney Avenue in the Saskatchewan capital city of Regina, Saskatchewan which was the site of the Trial of Louis Riel, where the drama the \"Trial of Louis Riel\" is still performed. Following the May trial, Louis Riel was hanged 16 November 1885. The RCMP Heritage Centre, in Regina, opened in May 2007. The Métis brought his body to his mother's home, now the Riel House National Historic Site, and then interred at the St. Boniface Basilica in Manitoba, his birthplace, for burial.\n\nIn 1925, the French writer Maurice Constantin-Weyer who lived 10 years in Manitoba published in French a fictionalized biography of Louis Riel titled \"La Bourrasque\". An English translation/adaptation was published in 1930 : \"A Martyr's Folly\" (Toronto, The Macmillan Company), and a new version in 1954, \"The Half-Breed\" (New York, The Macaulay Compagny).\n\nPortrayals of Riel's role in the Red River Rebellion include the 1979 CBC television film \"Riel\" and Canadian cartoonist Chester Brown's acclaimed 2003 graphic novel \"Louis Riel: A Comic-Strip Biography\".\n\nIn the 1940 film \"North West Mounted Police\" Riel is portrayed by \"Francis McDonald\".\nAn opera about Riel entitled \"Louis Riel\" was commissioned for Canada's centennial celebrations in 1967. It was an opera in three acts, written by Harry Somers, with an English and French libretto by Mavor Moore and Jacques Languirand. The Canadian Opera Company produced and performed the first run of the opera in September and October 1967.\n\nFrom the late 1960s until the early 1990s, the city of Saskatoon hosted \"Louis Riel Day\", a summer celebration that included a relay race that combined running, backpack carrying, canoeing, hill climbing, and horseback riding along the South Saskatchewan River in the city's downtown core. Traditionally, the event also included a cabbage roll eating contest and tug-of-war competition, as well as live musical performances. Although not affiliated with the Saskatoon Exhibition, for years Louis Riel Day was scheduled for the day before the start of the fair, and as such came to be considered the Exhibition's unofficial kick-off (the scheduling of the two events was separated in later years). The event was discontinued when major sponsors pulled out.\n\nBilly Childish wrote a song entitled \"Louis Riel\", which was performed by Thee Headcoats. Texas musician Doug Sahm wrote a song entitled \"Louis Riel,\" which appeared on the album \"S.D.Q. '98\". In the song, Sahm likens the lore surrounding Riel to David Crockett's legend in his home state, spinning an abridged tale of Riel's life as a revolutionary: \"...but you gotta respect him for what he thought was right... And all around Regina they talk about him still – why did they have to kill Louis Riel?\"\n\nThe Seattle-based Indie rock band Grand Archives also wrote a song entitled \"Louis Riel\" that appears on their 2008 self-titled album.\n\nA track entitled \"Snowin' Today: A Lament for Louis Riel\" appears on the 2009 album \"Live: Two Nights In March\" by Saskatchewan singer/guitarist Little Miss Higgins; a studio version features on her 2010 release \"Across The Plains\".\n\nOn 22 October 2003, the Canadian news channel CBC Newsworld and its French-language equivalent, Réseau de l'information, staged a simulated retrial of Riel. Viewers were invited to enter a verdict on the trial over the internet, and more than 10,000 votes were received—87% of which were \"not guilty\". The results of this straw poll led to renewed calls for Riel's posthumous pardon. Also on the basis of a public poll, the CBC's \"Greatest Canadian\" project ranked Riel as the 11th \"Greatest Canadian\".\n\nAn episode of the TV-series \"How the West Was Won\" from 1979 was named \"L'Affaire Riel\", featuring Louis Riel while in exile in the United States.\n\nIn 2001, Canadian sketch comedy troupe Royal Canadian Air Farce featured Riel in its send-up of the CBC documentary series \"Canada: A People's History.\" Significant parallels were drawn between Riel's actions and those of modern-day Québécois separatists, and the comedian who portrayed Riel was made up to look like then-Premier Lucien Bouchard.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1003416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1003416", "title": "Malebolge", "text": "Malebolge\n\nIn Dante Alighieri's \"Inferno\", part of the \"Divine Comedy\", Malebolge () is the eighth circle of Hell. Roughly translated from Italian, Malebolge means \"evil ditches\". Malebolge is a large, funnel-shaped cavern, itself divided into ten concentric circular trenches or ditches. Each trench is called a \"bolgia\" (Italian for \"pouch\" or \"ditch\"). Long causeway bridges run from the outer circumference of Malebolge to its center, pictured as spokes on a wheel. At the center of Malebolge is the ninth and final circle of hell. \n\nIn Dante’s version of hell, categories of sin are punished in different circles, with the depth of the circle (and placement within that circle) symbolic of the amount of punishment to be inflicted. Sinners placed in the upper circles of hell are given relatively minor punishments, while sinners in the depths of hell endure far greater torments. As the eighth of nine circles, Malebolge is one of the worst places in hell to be. In it, sinners guilty of \"simple\" fraud are punished (that is, fraud that is committed without particularly malicious intent, whereas Malicious or \"compound\" fraud—fraud which goes against bond of love, blood, honor, or the bond of hospitality—would be punished in the ninth circle). Sinners of this category include counterfeiters, hypocrites, grafters, seducers, sorcerers and simonists.\n\nDante and his guide, Virgil, make their way into Malebolge by riding on the back of the monster Geryon, the personification of fraud, who possesses the face of an honest man 'good of cheer,' but the tail of a scorpion, who flies them down through the yawning chasm that separates the eighth circle from the seventh circle, where the violent are punished. Dante and Virgil plan on crossing Malebolge by way of the system of bridges, but find their path disturbed by many broken ledges and collapsed bridges that were destroyed during the Harrowing of Hell. They must then cross some of the bolgias on foot and even rely on demons to guide them. Eventually, they make it to the inner ledge where after a brief look at the giants, the babbling Nimrod to the hostile Ephialtes and heavily chained Briareus, Virgil convinces the giant Antaeus to lower them down to the ninth circle's frozen lake, Cocytus.\n\nThirteen demons known as the Malebranche, \"Evil Claws\", guard the fifth bolgia of the Malebolge. Their leader is Malacoda (\"evil tail\"), while the others are Scarmiglione (\"ruffle-haired\"), Barbariccia (\"curly beard\"), Alichino (derived from Arlecchino, the harlequin), Calcabrina (\"one who walks on the frost\"), Cagnazzo (\"bad dog\"), Libicocco (a possible mix of \"libeccio\" and \"sirocco\"), Draghignazzo (maybe from \"drago\", \"dragon\", and \"sghignazzo\", \"guffaw\"), Ciriatto (possibly \"little pork\"), Graffiacane (\"scratch dog\"), Farfarello (possibly \"goblin\") and Rubicante (possibly \"red\" or \"rabid\"). One of the thirteen was thus not named. They try to trick Virgil and Dante by telling them of a path which does not really exist.\n\nThe ten ditches of the Malebolge, in descending order, are listed thus:\n\nBolgia One: Panderers and Seducers are punished here. They are forced to march, single file around the circumference of their circle, constantly lashed by horned demons.\n\nBolgia Two: Sinners guilty of excessive flattery are punished in this bolgia, immersed forever in a river of human excrement, similar to what their flatteries were. \n\nBolgia Three: Simoniacs (sinners guilty of selling church offices for personal gain) are punished here. They are turned upside down in large baptismal fonts cut into the rock, with their feet set ablaze by oily fires. The heat of the flames burns according to the guilt of the sinner.\n\nBolgia Four: Astrologers, seers, sorcerers and others who attempted to pervert God’s laws to divine the future are punished here. Their heads have been twisted around to face backwards, and thus they are forced to walk backwards around the circumference of their circle for all eternity.\n\nBolgia Five: Grafters (speculators, extortionists, blackmailers and unscrupulous businessmen: sinners who used their positions in life to gain personal wealth or other advantages for themselves) are punished by being thrown into a river of boiling pitch and tar. In addition, should any of the grafters try to escape the pitch, a horde of demons (\"Malebranche\", meaning \"evil claws\") armed with grappling hooks and barbs stands guard over them, ready to tear them to pieces. \n\nBolgia Six: Hypocrites are punished in this circle. They are forced to wear heavy lead robes as they walk around the circumference of their circle. The robes are golden and resemble a monk’s cowl but are lined with heavy lead, symbolically representing hypocrisy. Also, Caiaphas, the Pharisee who insisted on the execution of Jesus, is crucified in this circle, staked to the ground so that the ranks of the lead-weighted hypocrites march across him.\n\nBolgia Seven: This bolgia houses the souls of thieves. The bolgia is also filled with serpents, dragons and other vengeful reptiles that torture the thieves endlessly. The bites of some of the snakes cause the thieves to spontaneously combust, only to regenerate their bodies for further torment in a few moments. They are pursued by the monstrous fiery Cacus. Other thieves are denied human forms and appear as reptiles themselves, and can only assume their true shape if they steal a human shape from another sinner; this involves a very painful transformation for both souls involved. \n\nBolgia Eight: In this trench, the souls of Deceivers who gave false or corrupted advice to others for personal benefit are punished.

{"id": "336048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=336048", "title": "Metropolitan bishop", "text": "Metropolitan bishop\n\nIn Christian churches with episcopal polity, the rank of metropolitan bishop, or simply metropolitan, pertains to the diocesan bishop or archbishop of a metropolis.\n\nOriginally, the term referred to the bishop of the chief city of a historical Roman province, whose authority in relation to the other bishops of the province was recognized by the First Council of Nicaea (AD 325). The bishop of the provincial capital, the metropolitan, enjoyed certain rights over other bishops in the province, later called suffragan bishops.\n\nThe term is applied in a similar sense to the bishop of the chief episcopal see (the \"metropolitan see\") of an ecclesiastical province. The head of such a metropolitan see has the rank of archbishop and is therefore called the metropolitan archbishop of the ecclesiastical province. Metropolitan (arch)bishops preside over synods of the bishops of their ecclesiastical province, and are granted special privileges by canon law and tradition.\n\nIn some churches, such as the Church of Greece, a metropolis is a rank granted to all episcopal sees. Their bishops are all called metropolitans, the title of archbishop being reserved for the primate.\n\nIn the Latin Church, an ecclesiastical province, composed of several neighbouring dioceses, is headed by a metropolitan, the archbishop of the diocese designated by the Pope. The other bishops are known as suffragan bishops.\n\nThe metropolitan's powers over dioceses other than his own are normally limited to\n\nThe metropolitan also has the liturgical privilege of celebrating sacred functions throughout the province, as if he were a bishop in his own diocese, provided only that, if he celebrates in a cathedral church, the diocesan bishop has been informed beforehand.\n\nThe metropolitan is obliged to request the pallium, a symbol of the power that, in communion with the Church of Rome, he possesses over his ecclesiastical province. This holds even if he had the pallium in another metropolitan see.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the metropolitan, with the consent of the majority of the suffragan bishops, to call a provincial council, decide where to convene it, and determine the agenda. It is his prerogative to preside over the provincial council. No provincial council can be called if the metropolitan see is vacant.\n\nAll Latin Rite metropolitans are archbishops; however, some archbishops are not metropolitans, as there are a few instances where an archdiocese has no suffragans or is itself suffragan to another archdiocese. Titular archbishops (i.e. ordained bishops who are given an honorary title to a now-defunct archdiocese; e.g. many Vatican officials and papal nuncios and apostolic delegates are titular archbishops) are never metropolitans.\n\nAs of April 2006, 508 archdioceses were headed by metropolitan archbishops, 27 archbishops lead an extant archdiocese, but were not metropolitans, and there were 89 titular archbishops. See also Catholic Church hierarchy for the distinctions.\n\nIn those Eastern Catholic Churches that are headed by a patriarch, metropolitans in charge of ecclesiastical provinces hold a position similar to that of metropolitans in the Latin Church. Among the differences is that Eastern Catholic metropolitans within the territory of the patriarchate are to be ordained and enthroned by the patriarch, who may also ordain and enthrone metropolitans of sees outside that territory that are part of his Church. Similarly, a metropolitan has the right to ordain and enthrone the bishops of his province. The metropolitan is to be commemorated in the liturgies celebrated within his province.\n\nA major archbishop is defined as the metropolitan of a certain see who heads an autonomous Eastern Church not of patriarchal rank. The canon law of such a Church differs only slightly from that regarding a patriarchal Church. Within major archiepiscopal churches, there may be ecclesiastical provinces headed by metropolitan bishops.\n\nThere are also autonomous Eastern Catholic Churches consisting of a single province and headed by a metropolitan. Metropolitans of this kind are to obtain the pallium from the Pope as a sign of his metropolitan authority and of his Church's full communion with the Pope, and only after his investment with it can he convoke the Council of Hierarchs and ordain the bishops of his autonomous Church. In his autonomous Church it is for him to ordain and enthrone bishops and his name is to be mentioned immediately after that of the Pope in the liturgy.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Churches, the title of metropolitan is used variously, in terms of rank and jurisdiction.\n\nIn terms of rank, in some Eastern Orthodox Churches metropolitans are ranked above archbishops in precedence, while in others that order is reversed. Primates of autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Churches below patriarchal rank are generally designated as archbishops. In the Greek Orthodox Churches, archbishops are ranked above metropolitans in precedence. The reverse is true for some Slavic Orthodox Churches (Russian Orthodox, Bulgarian Orthodox) and also for Romanian Orthodox Church, where metropolitans rank above archbishops and the title can be used for important regional or historical sees.\n\nIn terms of jurisdiction, there are two basic types of metropolitans in Eastern Orthodox Church: real metropolitans, with actual jurisdiction over their ecclesiastical provinces, and honorary metropolitans who are in fact just diocesan bishops with honorary title of metropolitan and no jurisdiction outside their own diocese.\n\nSome Eastern Orthodox Churches have functioning metropolitans on the middle (regional) level of church administration. In Romanian Orthodox Church there are six regional metropolitans who are the chairmen of their respective synods of bishops, and have special duties and privileges. For example, Metropolitan of Oltenia has regional jurisdiction over four dioceses.\n\nOn the other hand, in some Eastern Orthodox Churches title of metropolitan is only honorary, with no special or additional jurisdiction. In Serbian Orthodox Church, honorary title of metropolitan is given to diocesan bishops of some important historical sees (Article 14 of the Constitution of Serbian Orthodox Church). For example, diocesan bishop of the Eparchy of Montenegro and the Littoral is given the honorary title of metropolitan, but without any jurisdiction over other diocesan bishops in Montenegro. Diocesan bishop of the Eparchy of Dabar-Bosnia is also given the honorary title of metropolitan, but without any jurisdiction over other diocesan bishops in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nNon-canonical Eastern Orthodox Churches generally use metropolitan title according to local traditions of usage in Churches from which they were split (see: Macedonian Orthodox Church).\n\nMetropolitan is a title used by all oriental orthodox churches in Malankara.\nMalankara Metropolitan was a legal title given to the head of the Malankara Syrian Church, aka Puthencoor (New Traditionalists) Syrian Christians, by the Government of Travancore and Cochin in South India. This title was awarded by a proclamation from the King of Travancore & the King of Cochin to the legal head of the Malankara Syrian Church. The Supreme Court of India had authenticated the usage of this title by the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church in its verdict in the Malankara Church case.\n\nBaselios Mar Thoma Paulose II was enthroned as Catholicos of the East and Malankara Metropolitan on 1 November 2010 at Parumala, Kerala. Under his see, the dioceses are further headed by Diocesan Metropolitans.\n\nIn the Mar Thoma Syrian Church which is based in India, the Metropolitan also known as the Mar Thoma is the primate and supreme head of the church who is entitled to special privileges and remains the ultimate authority over the synod.\n\nIn the Anglican Communion, a metropolitan is generally the head of an ecclesiastical province (or cluster of dioceses). In the few Anglican churches with multiple provinces headed by metropolitans (namely the Church of England, the Church of Ireland, the Anglican Church of Canada, the Anglican Church of Australia, and the Church of Nigeria), a metropolitan ranks immediately under the primate or senior metropolitan of the national church. Most metropolitans, but not all, are styled archbishop. In England, Ireland, and Australia, each province has a \"metropolitical see\" whose diocesan bishop is \"ex officio\" metropolitan (such as the Archbishops of Canterbury and Sydney), while in Canada metropolitans are elected by the provincial houses of bishops from among the sitting diocesans. Prior to 1970, however, the metropolitan of the Province of Rupert's Land was always the bishop of the eponymous diocese, centred on Winnipeg. (Since then, only one Bishop of Rupert's Land, Walter Jones, has been elected metropolitan).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "58063828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58063828", "title": "On Passions", "text": "On Passions\n\nOn Passions (; \"Peri pathōn\"), also translated as On Emotions or On Affections, is a work by the Greek Stoic philosopher Chrysippus dating from the 3rd-century BCE. The book has not survived intact, but around seventy fragments from the work survive in a polemic written against it in the 2nd-century CE by the philosopher-physician Galen. In addition Cicero summarises substantial portions of the work in his 1st-century BCE work \"Tusculan Disputations\". \"On Passions\" consisted of four books; of which the first three discussed the Stoic theory of emotions and the fourth book discussed therapy and had a separate title—\"Therapeutics\". Most surviving quotations come from Books 1 and 4, although Galen also provides an account of Book 2 drawn from the 1st-century BCE Stoic philosopher Posidonius. Little or nothing is known about Book 3.\n\nThe Stoics believed that the mind was rational, and that emotions involve judgements. The Stoic passions are emotions such as fear, anger, and desire which cause suffering. In his \"On Passions\", Chrysippus explained how the passions arise from the mistaken opinions of what is good and bad. They are excessive and disobedient to reason, which Chrysippus compared to a runner who is out-of-control. A person in the grip of passion has rejected reason, and therapy is a medical art needed to treat the mind. The treatment outlined by Chrysippus was mostly preventative, demonstrating by theory that the passions are neither natural or necessary, and showing through practice that the mind can be trained to reject them. \n\nStoicism is a school of philosophy which began in the 3rd-century BCE. The first head (\"scholarch\") of the school, Zeno of Citium, began teaching around 300 BCE, and laid down most of the fundamental doctrines of the school. His successors as head of the school were Cleanthes of Assos and then Chrysippus of Soli. The Stoics grounded their ethics in the belief that the world was rational, ordered, and structured. Only by living according to nature (human nature and cosmic nature) can humans flourish. Since nature is rational, only a life lived according to reason, i.e. according to virtue (\"aretē\"), will allow for a life that is smooth, consistent and happy. Failure to reason correctly brings about the occurrence of \"pathē\"—a word translated as passions, emotions, or affections. The Greek word \"pathos\" was a wide-ranging term indicating an infliction one suffers. The Stoics used the word to discuss generic emotions such as anger, fear and joy. The word passion is often used as a translation of \"pathos\" so as not to suggest that the Stoics wanted to be rid of all feeling. However the Stoics were often talking straightforwardly about common emotions.\n\nThe Stoics beginning with Zeno arranged the passions under four headings: distress (\"lupē\"), pleasure (\"hēdonē\"), fear (\"phobos\") and desire (\"epithumia\"). Two of these (distress and pleasure) refer to passions currently present, and two of these (fear and desire) refer to passions directed at the future. Under these four headings can be found specific emotions such as anger, longing, envy, grief, and pride.\n\nPhilosophers from the time of Plato had allowed for irrational impulses in the soul, but the Stoics saw the soul as a unified rational whole with a central ruling centre (\"hegemonikon\"). Thus the Stoics were the first philosophers to identify all emotions with judgements. A passion is a mistaken opinion. A passion has a passive aspect in that it brings suffering, but it also has an active aspect which the Stoics saw as an impulse (\"hormē\"), one which is excessive and disobedient to reason. The wise person who is free from the passions (\"apatheia\") instead experiences good emotions (\"eupatheia\") which are clear-headed feelings.\n\nIt was against this background that Chrysippus wrote his therapeutic work \"On Passions\". Cleanthes had maintained that to quell a passion such as fear, all one had to do was demonstrate that the emotion had nothing to do with what is bad. However as a form of therapy this was inadequate, and Chrysippus set himself the task of writing a treatise on the theory and therapy of emotions.\n\nThe principal source for the \"On Passions\" is the polemical commentary by Galen in his \"On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato\" which contains most of the surviving quotations. The other main source is Cicero's \"Tusculan Disputations\" Book IV which contains a discussion of the Stoic passions which is derived from Chrysippus. A small amount of supplementary information is provided by writers such as Diogenes Laërtius, Stobaeus, Calcidius, and Origen.\n\nGalen quotes Chrysippus' \"On Passions\" around seventy times in his \"On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato\", thus preserving up to twenty percent of the text. Galen wrote \"On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato\" to examine the main doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato and to demonstrate their truth and agreement (as Galen saw it). Plato had divided the soul into three parts representing reason, anger, and appetite. Since Chrysippus was the main representative of the Stoic view that the soul was unitary, Galen devotes most of the fourth and fifth books of his nine-volume treatise attacking the \"On Passions\" of Chrysippus.\n\nGalen maintains that most philosophers including Pythagoras, Aristotle and even many Stoics agreed with Plato's division of the soul, even if some of them understood the division in terms of powers rather than as parts. His goal is to show that Chrysippus represents a deviant position. He claims that Zeno and Cleanthes were really on Plato's side, but the evidence he presents is very meagre. He accepts he has little evidence for Zeno, and the only evidence he provides for Cleanthes is a brief versified dialogue between anger and reason which he thinks shows that Cleanthes accepted an irrational part of the soul.\n\nThroughout his polemic, Galen draws heavily on the Stoic philosopher Posidonius (1st-century BCE) who wrote his own \"On Passions\" as a commentary on Chrysippus. Galen claims Posidonius accepted an irrational part of the soul, although Posidonius may have held a more Stoic position than Galen admits to. Galen selects and quotes passages out of context, and he often shows incomprehension in his understanding of Chrysippus.\n\nCicero uses Chrysippus' \"On Passions\" as a major source for the fourth book of his \"Tusculan Disputations\". Some passages in his third book are also drawn from the same source. Cicero may well have used an epitome made by a later Stoic rather than the full text. He provides extra details not mentioned by Galen, and is comparatively unbiased. However, there are no direct quotations from Chrysippus in Cicero's account; he mixes in material drawn from other philosophy schools; and he intersperses his own comments. \n\nCicero complains that Chrysippus devotes most of his efforts on theory and not therapy, but Cicero has a narrow definition of therapy: a strategy for helping someone in the sudden grip of emotion. Cicero is nevertheless a useful source for the practical side of Chrysippus' therapy, and its focus on prevention. Galen neglects this aspect because his aim is to attack the theory.\n\nAlthough \"On Passions\" is one of the best attested works by Chrysippus, large sections of the work are lost. Galen appears to have only read, and made direct use of, Books 1 and 4. He derives his account of Book 2 entirely from the commentary of Posidonius, and he is silent about Book 3. The epitome used by Cicero may itself have been a summary of Books 1 and 4. This means that most of the surviving quotations are from Books 1 and 4 and our knowledge of Book 3 is non-existent.\n\nGalen refers to the first three books as the theoretical books (\"logika\"). Book 4 was known separately as the \"Therapeutics\" ()—a title which apparently goes back to Chrysippus, and it had some status as a stand-alone text. In Book 1 Chrysippus discusses the definitions of passion which had been laid down by Zeno, and analyses its various types. In Book 2 he examines the difficulties raised by everyday experience. Book 4 treats the therapy of the passions, although it too contains theory, summarising some of the material from Book 1. Theory itself plays an important role in Stoic therapy.\n\nIn Book 1 Chrysippus begins with the definitions of passion which had been laid down by Zeno. Zeno had written his own work \"On Passions\" which had examined emotions based on common opinions held about them. Zeno defined passion as \"an irrational and unnatural motion of the soul\" and \"an excessive impulse\". Chrysippus stresses that \"irrational\" here means \"disobedient to reason and having turned away from reason.\" Acting emotionally is not being overcome by a lower non-rational part of the soul. Chrysippus compares an excessive impulse to a runner whose legs have such impetus that the runner cannot immediately will them to a halt:\n\nAn excessive emotion is like a runner who is out-of-control because of external causes. In the case of out-of-control mind the external causes are external appearances, which when impressed upon a weakened mind result in a corresponding passion.\n\nZeno, again borrowing from common usage, had added a third definition of passion as a \"fluttering of the soul\". For the Stoics all bodily processes have a material, corporeal cause, which for Chrysippus as well as Zeno meant physical movements in the soul.\n\nHaving dealt with Zeno's three definitions of passion, Chrysippus passes on to the four generic passions as defined by Zeno. Zeno had defined distress as the opinion that one is in the presence of evil. The intensity of the distress is affected by the soul's resilience and the scale of the experience. Chrysippus adds that the opinion needs to be fresh to explain why distress can fade with time. Chrysippus defines distress as a shrinking before what is thought to be a thing to avoid, and pleasure as a swelling at what is thought to be a thing to choose.\n\nIn Book 2 Chrysippus moves beyond Zeno's definitions to discuss various problems concerning passions. For Chrysippus emotions are judgements: a judgement that something good or bad is at hand and that it is appropriate to act accordingly. Thus a passion consists of two propositions: (1) this is something good/bad and (2) it is right that one should be affected by it. In the case of distress, people believe that (1) something bad has befallen them, and (2) that one should shrink before it, producing not only the inner pain but the outward signs of distress such as weeping.\n\nEventually the distress diminishes which indicates a weakening of the second proposition, however the first proposition may remain in place. Thus one may stop mourning the death of a loved-one while still believing their death to be an evil. Chrysippus understands this in terms of abatement of inflammation, in much the same way a fever abates. The Stoics saw passions as a type of illness, so the medical analogy is deliberate.\n\nChrysippus acknowledges that some emotional responses are not easily reasoned out. For example it is possible that both judgements may be present but that the manifestations of distress do not ensue. Chrysippus explains this as being due to other causal factors acting which we may be unaware of or whose origin may be unclear. This might include underlying characteristics of the mind, or the extent to which other errors have become entrenched in the mind.\n\nChrysippus also discusses the origin of evil, and why children, even those brought up virtuously, become corrupted. Chrysippus relates this to his principle of oikeiôsis. Children are born in a natural state which should lead to goodness and virtue. However, the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain become associated from an early age with the supreme good. A similar process occurs with wealth and fame. Thus physical factors such as pleasure and pain, as well as societal pressures, hamper our natural development. The Stoics equated evil with the passions, and corruption arises in regards to good and evil because of \"the persuasiveness of appearances and conversation.\"\n\nChrysippus states near the beginning of Book 4 that just as there is an art called medicine concerned with the diseased body, so there is an equivalent art associated with the diseased mind. This is not just an analogy: a passion is a real illnesss brought on from the mind's deviation from its natural state. The soul's condition depends on physiological processes in the body. Chrysippus directly relates this to medical ideas concerning \"pneuma\" as the 'breath' that makes up the soul, and a passion involves a disturbance in the balance of the classical elements which make up the body and between physical principles such as hot and cold. Given this material relationship between body and soul, Chrysippus emphasizes the need for bodily health, and advocates a plain, simple diet.\n\nChrysippus discusses the passions by quoting Greek literature. Thus in his examination of anger he makes use of Euripides' \"Medea\": \n\nHere Chrysippus explains Medea's anger in terms of \"akrasia\": a word meaning weak-will or incontinence. \"Akrasia\" is not an irrational force within the soul, instead it is the mind identifying with a bad reason against one's better judgement. During emotional conflict reason oscillates between rival judgements. Wrong reason will reside simultaneously in the mind with right reason. In Medea's case she chooses the option rooted in anger, which is thus wrong reason. Chrysippus once again explains this loss of control in terms of \"runners who go counter to their impulse in running and [hence] in persons angered counter to their own reason.\"\n\nSomeone in the midst of an emotional crisis rejects right reason and cannot be easily helped. Chrysippus gives many examples of anger and other emotions such as people biting keys and kicking a door when it fails to open, or taking out anger on inanimate objects such as balls of wool. Such a person will appear changed to those people around them (i.e. people still in possession of right reason) and they can not be treated as the person they normally are. Similarly someone in the throes of love will reject good counsel whatever the price may be. They may recognise right reason, yet they will reject it. The passions obscure, they cause a mental clouding, a madness. They put an end to deliberation, leaving just one option as irresistible.\n\nOnly recovery from this mental clouding permits deliberation and the return of right reason. Chrysippus describes two forms of treatment: (1) treating passions which have arisen, and (2) preventing passions from arising. Chrysippus stresses that the therapy of the first type has only limited value, to be used as temporary measure. \n\nThus his therapy is preventative. Since a passion is a temporary outbreak reflecting the diseased nature of the mind, therapy itself must be directed at the underlying disease. Chrysippus advocates the practice of 'dwelling in advance'—that is trying to foresee the numerous difficulties that life offers. Chrysippus gives two reasons for the impact of unexpected events: (1) that we have no time to assess the magnitude of the event, and (2) that we feel guilty for not having anticipated it:\n\nThus the primary cause of distress is unforeseen events, and we need the ability to respond rationally instead of straight away assenting to appearances. Chrysippean therapy focuses on contemplation; training and improving the mind; strengthening the soul. The theory teaches us that the passions are misguided judgements, and thus are voluntary. It is the task of therapy to teach that these judgements have a wrong valuation, mistaking indifferent things for good or evil.\n\nCicero made use of \"On Passions\", probably in epitome form, for his \"Tusculan Disputations\". Most of his testimony can be found in the fourth book of the \"Tusculans\", especially the coherent section at §11–33 and a rather muddled section at §58–81. A few extra passages can be found in Cicero's third book.\n\nApart from the introduction (§1–10) and the conclusion (§82–4), \"Tusculan Disputations\" Book 4 can be divided into three parts, two of which are derived from Chrysippus' \"On Passions\". The other part is a critique of the Peripatetic theory of moderate emotions at §34–57. Although Stoic, this central section is drawn from some other source.\n\nThis first section closely parallels Galen's account of Books 1 and 4 of \"On Passions\". Cicero begins (§11) with Zeno's first two definitions of emotion, and moves on to an overview of the four generic passions as well as the three good-feelings attributable to the Stoic Sage (§14). He lists (§15) four physical effects of the four passions not found in Galen's account. He follows this (§16–21) with a lengthy catalogue of the emotions arranged under the headings of the four main passions—a list which is again missing from Galen. He then (§22) highlights the concept of \"akrasia\" (Latin: \"intemperamentia\") as the source of the passions.\n\nCicero then (§23–32) moves on to material which is drawn from the \"Therapeutics\". It begins (§23) with a statement about how disturbances of the mind are like those of the body, and how the soul is disturbed by conflicting opinions. Cicero provides (§25–26) definitions and examples of the various passions. He explains (§27–28) the analogy between body and soul, and between disease and health. He describes (§31) the limitations of the analogy (a healthy soul cannot become diseased like a healthy body can); and explains (§32) how the clever are less prone to sickness.\n\nIn this section Cicero returns to the subject of therapy. However, although much of the material is sourced from Chrysippus, Cicero interweaves some Peripatetic ideas; adds his own remarks; and sources his own quotations from the Latin poets.\n\nAfter an introduction (§58), Cicero explains (§59–62) the Chrysippean position that one should direct treatment at the passion itself rather than the external cause. He then (§64–65) discusses passions caused by (supposedly) bad and good things respectively. Cicero add his own digression on the opinions offered by different philosophers. He then (§68–76) moves on to the theme of erotic love. Many of these ideas come from Chrysippus, but Cicero uses examples drawn from Latin poetry instead of the Greek poets. The therapeutic ideas (§74–5) about introducing distractions or substituting a new lover for an old one are presumably part of Cicero's \"Peripatetic\" cures. The next subject (§77–81) treats anger, again drawing his ideas from Chrysippus.\n\nCicero's \"Tusculan Disputations\" Book 3 is focused on the alleviation of distress rather than the passions generally. Cicero draws on many Stoic themes, some of which may be derived from Chrysippus. This includes a medical analogy (§1), and passions as forms of madness (§7–13). However, only a few passages can be directly attributed to \"On Passions\". Of particular value is §52 which contains the doctrine of dwelling in advance which is directly attributed to Chrysippus. This can be supplemented with §29 which contains a Euripides' quote probably used by Chrysippus on the same theme. Other Chrysippean passages include a derivation of the word distress (\"lupē\") at §61, and his therapy concerning mourning at §76 and §79.\n\nChrysippus became a preeminent authority for the Stoic school, eclipsing his predecessors. Writers as doctrinally far-apart as Philodemus and Origen quote from his \"On Passions\". Galen himself states that the Stoics of his day followed Chrysippus.\n\nPosidonius wrote his own \"On Passions\" expanding on the treatise of Chrysippus. Almost everything which is known about the work is drawn from Galen's remarks. Galen claims Posidonius allowed for an irrational part of the soul. It is possible Posidonius did hold this position although it would have been at variance with mainstream Stoic thought, not just that of Chrysippus. Cicero, who had personally known Posidonius, shows no awareness of a disagreement between Posidonius and Chrysippus.\n\nAmong the difficulties Posidonius wanted to explain were: how impulses become excessive; why different people vary in their emotional reactions; why emotions fade through time, yet judgements can remain intact; and why the manifestations of distress can be so unpredictable. In many cases the disagreement which Galen reports between Posidonius and Chrysippus may in fact have been attempts by Posidonius to refine and corroborate the Stoic position of Chrysippus. For example, Posidonius wanted to explain variations in emotional reactions: why do some people react inappropriately in the face of an emotion and others do not? Posidonius may have argued that human minds are predisposed to various emotional movements without necessarily being irrational.\n\nThe influence of Chrysippus on Seneca is clearest in his long essay \"On Anger\" (). Seneca distinguishes three stages of anger as part of a chronological sequence. The first stage is shock, an initial agitation or movement which is involuntary. In the second stage the mind assents to appearance of injustice, and that it is thus appropriate to respond with vindictiveness. In the third stage the emotion is released. Reason, which was still present in the second stage is now let go and the mind turns away from it. Since the first stage is involuntary and the third stage lacks reason, therapy has to be directed at the second stage—only here can one recognise the nature of the shock and side with reason.\n\nEpictetus tells his students to train themselves in their use of appearances through a series of exercises. This includes questioning whether a grand or beautiful passer-by involves something good, or whether a bereaved or hungry person has encountered something bad. Epictetus makes a sharp distinction between things in our power (\"eph' hēmin\") and not in our power. Anything in our power is defined narrowly as our will or volition (\"prohairesis\"). This includes our judgements and desires, but nothing external such as our bodies. The influence of Chrysippus is obvious in a \"Discourse\" (ii. 18) on the correct use of impressions, where he explains how diseases grow in the mind in a manner very similar to a Chrysippean passage quoted by Cicero (\"Tusc. Disp.\" iv. 24):\n\na. Some older English translations of the \"Tusculan Disputations\" use a different numbering scheme for the sections. In these old texts the relevant parts of book IV, §11–33 and §58–81, are sections 6–14 and 27–37. For Book III, §29 and §52 are at sections 14 and 22. The other three passages §61, §76, §79 are at 25, 31, and 33.\n\n"}
{"id": "3306282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3306282", "title": "Our Lady of Walsingham", "text": "Our Lady of Walsingham\n\nOur Lady of Walsingham is a title of the Blessed Virgin Mary venerated by Roman Catholics and Anglicans associated with the Marian apparitions to Richeldis de Faverches, a pious English noblewoman, in 1061 in the village of Walsingham in Norfolk, England. Lady Richeldis had a building structure named \"The Holy House\" built in Walsingham which later became a shrine and place of pilgrimage.\n\nIn passing on his guardianship of the Holy House, Richeldis's son Geoffrey left instructions for the building of a priory in Walsingham. The priory passed into the care of the Canons Regular sometime between 1146 and 1174.\n\nPope Pius XII granted a canonical coronation to the Roman Catholic image via the papal nuncio, Bishop Gerald O'Hara, on 15 August 1954 with a gold crown funded by her female devotees, now venerated in the Basilica of Our Lady of Walsingham.\n\nAccording to the reputed Marian apparition to Lady Richeldis, the Blessed Virgin Mary fetched her soul from England to Nazareth during a religious ecstasy to show the house where the Holy Family once lived and was then tasked to build an imitation of the home in which the Annunciation of Archangel Gabriel occurred. The building structure came to be known as the \"Holy House\", and later became both a shrine and the focus of pilgrimage to Walsingham. The wooden image was carved in Oberammergau, Germany, and was once associated with the Virgin of Mercy under the venerated Marian title of Our Lady of Ransom, sometimes locally worded as \"Our Lady of the Dowry\". The popularity of the Marian cult gradually localized the place of devotion as \"Our Lady of Walsingham\".\n\nThe historian J. C. Dickinson argues that the chapel was founded in the time of Edward the Confessor, about 1053, the earliest deeds naming Richeldis, the mother of Geoffrey of Favraches, as the founder. Dickinson claims that in 1169, Geoffrey granted \"to God and St Mary and to Edwy his clerk the chapel of our Lady\" which his mother had founded at Walsingham with the intention that Edwy should found a priory. These gifts were, shortly afterwards, confirmed to the Austin Canons of Walsingham by Robert de Brucurt and Roger, earl of Clare.\n\nHowever, historian Bill Flint (2015) has refuted the foundation date established by Dickinson, arguing that the 1161 Norfolk Roll refers to the foundation of the priory only and not the shrine. Flint supports the earlier date of 1061 given in the Pynson Ballad and claims that in this year, Queen Edith the Fair, Lady of the Manor, was the likely Walsingham visionary. By the time of its destruction in 1538 during the reign of Henry VIII, the shrine had become one of the greatest religious centres in England and Europe, together with Glastonbury and Canterbury. It had been a place of pilgrimage during medieval times, when due to wars and political upheaval, travel to Rome and Santiago de Compostela was tedious and difficult.\n\nNevertheless, royal patronage helped the shrine to grow both in wealth and popularity, receiving regal visits from the following kings and queen: \n\nVisiting in 1513, Desiderius Erasmus wrote the following:\n\nIt was also a place of pilgrimage for Queen Catherine of Aragon who was a regular pilgrim. Likewise, Anne Boleyn also publicly announced an intention of making a pilgrimage but it never occurred. Its wealth and prestige did not, however, prevent its being a disorderly house. The visitation of Bishop Nicke in 1514 revealed that the prior was leading a scandalous life and that, among many other things, he treated the canons with insolence and brutality; the canons themselves frequented taverns and were quarrelsome. The prior, William Lowth, was removed and by 1526 some decent order had been restored.\n\nThe suppression of the monasteries was part of the English Reformation. On the pretext of discovering any irregularities in their life, Thomas Cromwell organised a series of visitations, the results of which led to the suppression of smaller foundations (which did not include Walsingham) in 1536. Six years earlier the prior, Richard Vowell, had signed their acceptance of the king's supremacy, but it did not save them. Cromwell's actions were politically motivated but the canons, who had a number of houses in Norfolk, were not noted for their piety or good order. The prior was evidently compliant but not all of the community felt likewise. In 1537, two lay choristers organised \"the most serious plot hatched anywhere south of the Trent\", intended to resist what they feared, rightly as it turned out, would happen to their foundation. Eleven men were executed as a result. The sub-prior, Nicholas Milcham, was charged with conspiring to rebel against the suppression of the lesser monasteries, and on flimsy evidence was convicted of high treason and hanged outside the priory walls.\n\nThe suppression of the Walsingham priory came late in 1538, under the supervision of Sir Roger Townshend, a local landowner. Walsingham was famous and its fall symbolic.\n\nJohn Hussey wrote to Lord Lisle in 1538: \"July 18th: This day our late Lady of Walsingham was brought to Lambhithe (Lambeth) where was both my Lord Chancellor and my Lord Privy Seal, with many virtuous prelates, but there was offered neither oblation nor candle : what shall become of her is not determined.\" Two chroniclers, Hall and Speed, suggest that the actual burning did not take place until September.\n\nThe buildings were looted and largely destroyed, but the memory of it was less easy to eradicate. Sir Roger wrote to Cromwell in 1564 that a woman of nearby Wells (now called Wells-Next-The-Sea) had declared that a miracle had been done by the statue after it had been carried away to London. He had the woman put in the stocks on market day to be abused by the village folk but concluded \"I cannot perceyve but the seyd image is not yett out of the sum of ther heddes.\"\n\nThe site of the priory with the churchyard and gardens was granted by the Crown to Thomas Sydney. All that remained of it was the gatehouse, the chancel arch and a few outbuildings. The Elizabethan ballad, \"A Lament for Walsingham\", expresses something of what the Norfolk people felt at the loss of their shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham.\n\n\nAfter nearly four hundred years the 20th century saw the restoration of pilgrimage to Walsingham as a regular feature of Christian life in the British Isles and beyond. There are both Roman Catholic and Anglican shrines in Walsingham.\n\nIn 1340, the Slipper Chapel was built at Houghton St Giles, a mile outside Walsingham. This was the final \"station\" chapel on the way to Walsingham. It was here that pilgrims would remove their shoes to walk the final \"Holy Mile\" to the shrine barefoot.\n\nIn 1896, Charlotte Pearson Boyd purchased the 14th-century Slipper Chapel, which had seen centuries of secular use, and set about its restoration. The statue of the Mother and Child was carved at Oberammergau and based on the design of the original statue - a design found on the medieval seal of Walsingham Priory.\n\nIn 1897, Pope Leo XIII re-established the restored 14th-century Slipper Chapel as a Roman Catholic shrine, now the centre of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham. The Holy House had been rebuilt at the Church of the Annunciation at King's Lynn (Walsingham was part of this Roman Catholic parish in 1897).\n\nThe Anglican Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham was created in 1938. In 1921, Fr Hope Patten was appointed Vicar of Walsingham. He set up a statue of Our Lady of Walsingham, based on the image depicted on the seal of the medieval priory, in the Parish Church of St Mary. As the number of pilgrims to the site increased, a new chapel was dedicated in 1931 and the statue was moved to it. The chapel was extended in 1938 to form the current Anglican shrine.\n\nThere is an Eastern Orthodox presence at Walsingham. The Eastern Orthodox Church have the use of a small chapel on a landing in the Holy House as well as the former Victorian railway station building nearby which has become the Orthodox Church of St Seraphim, complete with a small onion dome on the roof.\n\nThere is frequently an ecumenical dimension to pilgrimages to Walsingham, with many pilgrims arriving at the Slipper Chapel and then walking to the Holy House at the Anglican shrine. Student Cross is the longest continuous walking pilgrimage in Britain to Walsingham which takes place over Holy Week and Easter.\n\nIn the United States the National Shrine to Our Lady of Walsingham for the Episcopal Church is located in Grace Church, Sheboygan, Wisconsin, and for the Catholic Church at Saint Bede's Church, Williamsburg, Virginia. Our Lady of Walsingham is remembered by Roman Catholics on 24 September and by Anglicans on 15 October. The personal ordinariate established for former Anglicans in England and Wales is named for of Our Lady of Walsingham. The cathedral of the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of St. Peter in Houston, Texas, is named for Our Lady of Walsingham. A Western Rite Antiochian Orthodox parish named for Our Lady of Walsingham is in Mesquite, Texas.\n\nIn addition, some people are invested into the Scapular of Our Lady of Walsingham while the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham is named in her honor.\n\n\n\n"}

Adherents of these religions have been forcefully converted to Islam and Christianity, demonized and marginalized. The atrocities include killings, waging war, destroying of sacred places, and other atrocious actions.\n\nAfter the establishment of Islam, its rapid expansion and conquests displaced traditional African religions either by conversion or conquest. Traditional African religions have influenced Islam in Africa, and Islam is considered as having more commonality with traditional African religions, but conflict has occurred, especially due to Islam's monotheistic stance and the rise of Muslim reformers such as Askia.\n\nIn the Senegambia region, the Serer people who held \"a strong connection to their ancient religious past\" became the targets of Islamic jihads and persecution from the 11th to the 19th-century resulting in the Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune.\n\nTraditional African religions are tolerant of other gods, which allows general co-existence for multiple religions. This has been regarded by some authors to be another reason behind the rise of other religions in Africa. Most followers of traditional religions accommodated Islam during the start of its spread in Africa, but in West Africa, it was not until the coming of colonialism that Islam gained mass appeal, transforming even groups with historical animosity towards Islamic domination into Muslim communities.\n\nIn many instances, conflicting groups chose to align with Muslim armies against other African communities. \n\nThe relationship of Islam and traditional African religions was far from hostile but more defined by accommodation and co-existence. The tradition of \"jihad\" remained a minor theme.\nIn the Songhai Empire, the ruler Sonni Baru held or syncretised aspects of the African traditional religions and was challenged by Askia because he was not seen as a faithful Muslim. Askia would later wage wars against those who were politically non-aligned Muslims and non-Muslims.\n\nAfter Dunama Dabbalemi of the Sayfawa dynasty converted to Islam, he waged \"Jihad\", or holy war, against the proponents of the Kanuri religion, seeking to destroy its presence.\n\nIn the Swahili coast, Muslims were not interested in preaching, colonization, or jihad. It was not until the 18th century that Islam spread into the interior. Molefi Asante notes that:\n\nThe religion of Islam made each Muslim merchant or traveler an embryonic missionary and the appeal of the religion with its similarities to the African religions was far more powerful than the Christian appeal.\n\nThe early Christians of Niger Delta who were against the customs and traditions of the indigenous tribes carried out atrocities such as destroying their shrines and killing the sacred iguana.\n\nThe European colonization of Africa is noted to have paved the way of Christian missionaries into Africa. In some cases, the leaders of traditional African religions were persecuted by the missionaries and regarded as the \"devil's agents\". Ali Mazrui has discussed similar issues in the book \"The African Condition\". A further example of persecution by missionaries is how many of the earliest Christian missionaries to the Shona people, of modern day Zimbabwe, desecrated shrines located in Matonjeni, harassed Shona priests and decried Mwari, the Shona God, as being a fake and inept God. This persecution continued until the Shona were completely prevented from worshipping their God, Mwari, at Matonjeni.\n\nDespite attempts at tolerance and Interreligious Dialogue, in many Christian churches there was a belief that \"everything African seems to be pagan\", and some argue this view remains today in certain evangelical Pentecostal religious positions. The historical view that Africans had to become \"civilized\" by slavery, colonialism and Christian missionary activity likely contributed to the intolerance of traditional religions during the colonial period. These views culminated in some colonials rejecting that traditional African faiths were proper religions.\n\nOn 2001, an Oro Festival in Sagamu was violated by the Muslim Hausa-Fulani inhabitants, causing a temporary breakdown between the groups.\n\nIn September 2005, the sleepy town of Iwo, Osun State, became a theatre of war when a group of Muslims called the Tahun took on the community's masquerade cult in brazen and violent attacks.\n\nPractitioners of the Bwiti religion have faced persecution by Christian missionaries and French colonial authorities, as well as some members of the present Gabon government.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3021164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3021164", "title": "Razhden the Protomartyr", "text": "Razhden the Protomartyr\n\nRazhden (, also transliterated as Ražden or Rajden; died ) was a 5th-century Persian nobleman in the service of the Georgian king Vakhtang I of Iberia and a convert to Christianity who was executed by the Sassanid military in Iberia. He was canonized by the Georgian Orthodox Church as St. Razhden the Protomartyr (რაჟდენ პირველმოწამე, \"razhden pirvelmotsame\"), with his feast day marked on August 16 (O.S. August 3).\n\nThe earliest mention of Razhden is found in the \"History of King Vakhtang Gorgasali\", part of the medieval Georgian historical compendium, composed in the 8th or 11th century and traditionally attributed to Juansher Juansheriani. The source relates Razhden's death as a martyr during the war of Sassanids against Vakhtang I.\n\nRazhden was a guardian or tutor (მამამძუძუ, \"mamamdzudzu\") of Balendukht, a daughter of the king of the Persians, whom he accompanied to Iberia on the occasion of her marriage with Vakhtang. Razhden converted to Christianity and entered Vakhtang’s service, proving himself an able soldier. He was eventually taken captive by the Persians and tortured to death for refusing to reject Christianity. Vakhtang later built the church of Nikozi at the site of Razhden's burial and installed a bishop there. According to the \"History of King Vakhtang Gorgasali\", Vakhtang also built a church in St. Razhden's honor in the suburb of Ujarma.\n\nIn the 1720s, the brief medieval narrative of Juansher was transformed into hagiography by the Georgian catholicos Besarion Orbelishvili, who refurbished the story with further details. According to Besarion, the captive Razhden was pressured by the king of the Persians himself into denouncing his Christian faith. Briefly freed, through the mediation of Georgian nobles, to bid a farewell to his family, Razhden voluntarily returned to captivity and was handed over to a Persian commander in Tsromi, in Iberia, where he was eventually crucified, along with five criminals, and shot with arrows. Besarion also authored a canon to St. Razhden, while another Georgian catholicos of the 18th century, Anton I, included a rewritten passion of Razhden in his collection of Georgian martyrdoms in the 1760s.\n\nThe sources on Razhden were compiled by Mikhail Sabinin into his account of the saint's life, embedded in the \"Paradise of Georgia\" (საქართველოს სამოთხე, \"sakartvelos samotkhe\") published in St. Petersburg in 1882. Razhden's passion was translated into Latin and published, in 1914, by Paul Peeters.\n\n"}
{"id": "464277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=464277", "title": "Religion in Futurama", "text": "Religion in Futurama\n\nThe animated science fiction television program \"Futurama\" makes a number of satirical and humorous references to religion, including inventing several fictional religions which are explored in certain episodes of the series.\n\nThe episode \"Hell Is Other Robots\" centers around Bender's becoming addicted to high-voltage electricity, then discovering the religion of Robotology to help him break the habit. Sermons are conducted at the Temple of Robotology by the Reverend Preacherbot, a character whose mannerisms draw heavily on black church preacher stereotypes. \"Robotology\" is a play on the name Scientology, and series creator Matt Groening has said that he received a call from the Church of Scientology concerned about the use of a similar name.\nRobotology has a holy text, \"The Good Book 3.0\" which is stored on a 3.5\" floppy disk. Two symbols of the religion are shown in the episode. The first is a zig-zag line with a circle at either end, based on the electronic symbol used for resistors on circuit diagrams. \n\nRobots who accept Robotology are expected to abstain from behavior such as smoking, pornography, stealing, abusing electricity, and drinking alcohol. Consuming alcohol is usually necessary to power a robot's fuel cells, but this episode establishes that mineral oil is an acceptable substitute. Sinners are punished by condemnation to Robot Hell, located under an abandoned amusement park in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The punishments in Robot Hell are similar to the levels and rationale portrayed in Dante's \"Divine Comedy\", specifically the Inferno.\n\nRobot Hell is controlled by the Robot Devil. He is bound by the Fairness in Hell Act of 2275, allowing anyone who can defeat him in a fiddle contest with a solid gold fiddle to win their freedom, as well the golden fiddle itself, a reference to the song \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\". Should the individual lose the fiddle contest, they will only receive a smaller, silver fiddle and the Robot Devil may kill them at his discretion.\n\nIn \"Ghost in the Machines\", Bender's ghost is sent to an equivalent robot Heaven monitored by a Robot God whose streamlined design is reminiscent of EVE in the Pixar animated film \"WALL-E\". This God appears to be distinct from the more ambiguous, universal 'God' character that appeared in \"Godfellas\" and \"Bender's Big Score\", who may or may not have been representative of the Gods of all religions, and/or a machine. Notably, the Robot God does not deny being God and treats Bender's ghost as his subject.\n\nThe episode \"Future Stock\" introduces Robot Judaism in a scene where Fry and Dr. Zoidberg, seeking free food, sneak into a \"Bot Mitzvah\" celebration (a spoof of the Bar and Bat Mitzvah). As a joke about Jewish dietary laws' proscriptions against shellfish, Zoidberg was not allowed in (despite having Jewish stereotype qualities) inasmuch as he was an anthropomorphic lobster. At the Bot Mitzvah, Fry asks a Jewish robot if they don't believe in Robot Jesus, to which the robot replies, \"We believe he was built, and that he was a very well-programmed robot, but he wasn't our Messiah\". A banner written in Hebrew reads \"Today you are a robot\" (with two misspellings), referencing the traditional Jewish belief that a boy becomes a man on his Bar Mitzvah. In the episode \"The Bots and the Bees\" Bender's son, Ben, has a Bot Mitzvah celebration of his own where he becomes a man after being born only a few days prior. This scene reinforces the quick rate at which robots mature in the Futurama world as well as alludes to the practice of robot circumcision.\n\nReferences to a holiday called 'Robanukah' appear in several episodes, as well, though it is heavily implied that Bender makes up this holiday to avoid work. In the Futurama Holiday Spectacular, the Robanukah story involves a pair of fembots who must wrestle in petroleum oil for six and a half weeks. When the oil, which was predicted to last only four and a half weeks, lasts for 500 million years, Bender declares it a Robanukah miracle.\n\nThe First Amalgamated Church is a syncretic denomination of several mainstream religions extant in the 21st-century, and is referenced in several episodes. The church and one of its priests, Father Changstein el-Gamal, are introduced in the episode \"Godfellas\". Father Changstein el-Gamal reappears in \"The Sting\" at Fry's funeral service, and in \"Bender's Big Score\" at Lars' and Leela's wedding. The religion appears to be a mix of Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Islam and even agnosticism.\n\nOther religions are depicted or mentioned in passing in other episodes. In the episode \"Hell Is Other Robots\", Professor Farnsworth complains about Bender's devotion to Robotology, saying, \"If only he had joined a mainstream religion, like Oprahism or Voodoo\".\n\nIn the season 2 episode \"I Second That Emotion\", Fry, Leela, and Bender are shown around the sewer mutants' village. Fry notices a large gold-plated ICBM on the altar of the cathedral and exclaims \"Wow! You guys worship an unexploded nuclear bomb?\" to which one of the mutants responds \"Yeah, but nobody is that observant. It's mostly a Christmas and Easter thing.\" The altar and the bomb are a reference to the film \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\", in which the religion worship of the subterranean is focused on a nuclear bomb.\n\nThe season 4 episode \"Where No Fan Has Gone Before\", presents the situation of a television show becoming elevated to the status of a religion in the form of the \"Church of Trek\", where devotees of \"\" worship the characters and attend services dressed as officers and aliens from the show (in 23rd or 24th century).\n\nIn the second \"Futurama\" straight-to-DVD film, \"The Beast with a Billion Backs\", Fry becomes the pope of a new religion which worships the interdimensional planet-sized tentacle monster named Yivo, who brainwashed the inhabitants of Earth by attaching his tentacles to their brains, before taking them onto him, which resembled heaven.\n\nIn the third film \"Bender's Game\", Professor Farnsworth invokes the name of \"the all-powerful Atheismo\".\n\nIn the season 7 episode \"Free Will Hunting\", when Bender walks throughout Chapek 9 looking to discover his never-programmed free-will unit, he happens upon a religious monastery led by a monk named Ab-bot; the abbot takes him in and converts him into his religion called \"Order of the Binary Singularity\" believing in the promise \"Creatrix\" or Mom will give them free-will units.\n\nAside from inventing religions, the writers of \"Futurama\" also make references to established faiths.\n\nIn the episode \"When Aliens Attack\", Earth is invaded by Omicronians demanding to see the season finale of \"Single Female Lawyer\", a television show which was accidentally knocked off the air 1,000 years earlier by Fry. Professor Farnsworth explains that the show no longer exists because most video tapes from that era were destroyed during the Second Coming of Jesus in the year 2443. Ken Keeler, the writer of the episode, considered this joke one of the most blasphemous lines in the show, because it suggested that the Second Coming had been and gone and life for the unsaved on Earth had carried on much as before.\n\nJesus is referenced several times throughout the show, the most notable being on \"A Tale of Two Santas\", where all of the crew dress up as Santa and Zoidberg dresses up as \"his friend Jesus\" to attempt to stay Bender's execution. When the real Robot Santa appears and attacks the crew and the people attempting to execute Bender, the executioner exclaims \"Get him, Jesus!\" before diving behind an object, and in reference to Benjamin Franklin's famous remark, Zoidberg replies, \"I help those who help themselves.\"\n\nOn several occasions, Professor Farnsworth uses the phrase \"Sweet Zombie Jesus!\" as an expression of shock or dismay. These exclamations are usually cut for syndication in the United States. In the DVD of Futurama episode \"The Deep South,\" a cut scene shows Farnsworth muttering in his sleep about the Zombie Jesus returning at tea-time, when Farnsworth has no food to supply it.\n\nAnother undead figure, Chanukah Zombie, first mentioned in the episode \"A Tale of Two Santas\", makes an appearance in \"Bender's Big Score\". He teams up with Robot Santa and Kwanzaa Bot to fight alien scam artists who have seized possession of planet Earth. His weapons are themed around Jewish symbols and artifacts, including explosive dreidels and a TIE fighter (a reference to \"Star Wars\"; Star Wars actor Mark Hamill supplies Chanukah Zombie's voice) adorned with Stars of David and a menorah.\n\nCatholicism is shown to still exist in some form in the 31st century, as the show makes several references to the \"Space Pope\": in the opening titles of \"Hell is Other Robots\" (stating that the show has been \"Condemned by the Space Pope\"); in \"A Bicyclops Built for Two\", with Bender's rhetorical question \"Is the Space Pope reptilian?\"; and in \"I Dated a Robot\", in an endorsement at the end of an educational film (\"Brought to you by the Space Pope\"). In the last of these, a graphic displays a picture of the Space Pope as a reptilian alien in Papal vestments, encircled by the words \"Crocodylus pontifex\". Additionally, in the episode \"Put Your Head on My Shoulders\", Fry and Amy Wong have a lighthearted conversation about their parents' expectations of them; Fry remarks, \"What am I, the Pope?\" to which Amy replies, \"Yeah, and if you were the Pope they'd be all, 'Straighten your Pope hat,' and 'Put on your good vestments!'\" In the sixth season episode, The Duh-Vinci Code, the cast travels to Rome (announced as Future-Roma), where the Space Pope directs the ship's landing at the Vatican. A few episodes later, in \"The Silence of the Clamps,\" the Space Pope is shown conducting the wedding of the Donbot's older daughter.\n\nConversely, Satanism is also shown to still exist in some form in the 31st century. In the episode \"A Taste of Freedom,\" Zoidberg's lawyer, Old Man Waterfall, requests a Satanic funeral rite before dying, and Professor Farnsworth, in \"The Farnsworth Parabox\", when he is presumably creating the box containing the parallel universe, appeals to Satan for help, mentioning that Satan owes him.\n\nIt is implied that some form of Neopaganism may still exist in the future, based on references to a lesbian coven across the street from Planet Express in \"Future Stock\".\n\nIn \"The Lesser of Two Evils,\" one of the Miss Universe pageant contestants is an energy being identified, with little fanfare, as \"Miss Heaven,\" suggesting that by the 31st century, Heaven is an accessible part of the universe rather than a divine afterlife attainable only after death. However, another possibility is that Miss Heaven is simply from a conventional planet that has been \"named\" \"Heaven.\"\n\nAlso, Hermes Conrad, who is Jamaican, claims to be a rastafarian.\n\nThe episode \"Godfellas\" explores several religious themes in a more earnest and thought-provoking way than any other episode, and without explicitly referencing or parodying any particular religion. Bender is accidentally cast adrift in space and unwittingly becomes a god figure to a race of tiny people (Shrimpkins) living on an asteroid that impacts his body. Bender attempts to answer their prayers, but ends up harming the Shrimpkins. Meanwhile, the Shrimpkins who have migrated to Bender's backside, out of his sight, grow frustrated that their prayers go entirely unanswered. Eventually the two factions of Shrimpkins wipe one another out in a miniature nuclear war.\n\nAfter Bender's unsuccessful attempt at godhood, he encounters a god-like entity in space. Bender first wonders if the entity is God, because of its awesome power or a computer because it thinks in binary. The entity responds \"Possible, I do feel compassion towards all living things\" and \"Possible, I am user-friendly\" respectively, adding \"My good chum\" to the end both times. Bender eventually theorizes that the entity may have, in fact, been the remains of a satellite that collided with God, to which the entity replies \"Probable\". The conversation between them touches on the ideas of predestination, prayer, and the nature of salvation, in what Mark Pinsky referred to as a theological turn to the episode which may cause the viewer to need \"to be reminded that this is a cartoon and not a divinity school class\". By the end of the conversation, Bender's questions still have not been fully answered, and he is left wanting more from the voice than it has given him. The character/entity returned, albeit briefly, in the first of the direct-to-DVD installments, \"Bender's Big Score\".\n\nThe episode also sees Fry turning to religion to help locate Bender. Seeking guidance, he visits the First Amalgamated Church. When this fails to help him, Fry visits the \"Monks of Dschubba\" to use the radio telescope of a sect of monks who are attempting to find God in the universe. This subplot takes religion much more lightly, referring to the monks as a \"crazy sect\" and suggesting that prayer is usually unreliable.\n\nThe episode also makes reference to \"The Nine Billion Names of God\" by Arthur C. Clarke.\n\nThe book \"Toons That Teach\", a text used by youth groups to teach teenagers about spirituality, recommends the episode \"Godfellas\" in a lesson teaching about \"Faith, God's Will, [and] Image of God\".\n\n"}

{"id": "433468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=433468", "title": "Temperance (virtue)", "text": "Temperance (virtue)\n\nTemperance is defined as moderation or voluntary self-restraint. It is typically described in terms of what an individual voluntarily refrains from doing. This includes restraint from retaliation in the form of non-violence and forgiveness, restraint from arrogance in the form of humility and modesty, restraint from excesses such as splurging now in the form of prudence, and restraint from excessive anger or craving for something in the form of calmness and self-control.\n\nTemperance has been described as a virtue by religious thinkers, philosophers, and more recently, psychologists, particularly in the positive psychology movement. In classical iconography, the virtue is often depicted as a woman holding two vessels transferring water from one to another. It was one of the cardinal virtues in western thought found in Greek philosophy and Christianity, as well as eastern traditions such as Buddhism and Hinduism. \n\nTemperance is one of the six virtues in the positive psychology classification, included with wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, and transcendence. It is generally characterized as the control over excess, and expressed through characteristics such as chastity, modesty, humility, self-regulation, forgiveness and mercy; each of these involves restraining an excess of some impulse, such as sexual desire, vanity, or anger.\n\nThe term \"temperance\" can also refer to the abstention from alcohol (teetotalism), especially with reference to the temperance movement.\n\nThe Greek definition of temperance translates to \"moderation in action, thought, or feeling; restraint\". Temperance is a major Athenian virtue, as advocated by Plato; self-restraint (sôphrosune) is one of his four core virtues of the ideal city, and echoed by Aristotle. According to Aristotle, \"temperance is a mean with regard to pleasures\". In \"Charmides\", one of Plato's early dialogues, the one who possessed 'sophrosune' is defined in four ways: (1) one who has quietness, (2) one who has modesty, (3) one who does his own business, and (4) one who knows himself. Plato quickly dismisses the three first definitions and argues against (4) that if 'sophrosune' would have been only the property of knowing what one knows or not, then it would be useless without knowledge about other matters.\n\nThemes of temperance can be seen across cultures and time, as illustrated here.\n\nTemperance is an essential part of the Eightfold Path. The third and fifth of the five precepts (pañca-sila) reflect values of temperance: \"misconduct concerning sense pleasures\" and drunkenness are to be avoided.\n\nIn the Judeo-Christian tradition, temperance is prolific. The Old Testament emphasizes temperance as a core virtue, as evidenced in both Solomon's Book of Proverbs and in the Ten Commandments, with its admonitions against adultery and covetousness. The New Testament does so as well, with forgiveness being central to theology and self-control being one of the Fruits of the Spirit. With regard to Christian theology, the word temperance is used by the King James Version in Galatians 5:23 for the Greek word ἐγκρατεία (enkrateia), which means self-control or discipline (\"Strong's Concordance\", 1466). Thomas Aquinas promoted Plato's original virtues in addition to several others.\n\nWithin the Christian church Temperance is a virtue akin to self-control. It is applied to all areas of life. It can especially be viewed in practice among sects like the Amish, Old Order Mennonites, and Conservative Mennonites. In the Christian religion, temperance is a virtue that moderates attraction and desire for pleasure and \"provides balance in the use of created goods\". St. Thomas calls it a \"disposition of the mind which binds the passions\". Temperance is believed to combat the sin of gluttony. Temperance is commonly broken down into four main strengths: forgiveness, humility, prudence, and self-regulation.\n\nThe concept of \"dama\" () in Hinduism is equivalent to temperance. It is sometimes written as \"damah\" (Sanskrit: दमः). The word \"dama\", and Sanskrit derivative words based on it, connote the concepts of self-control and self-restraint. Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, in verse 5.2.3, states that three characteristics of a good, developed person are self-restraint (damah), compassion and love for all sentient life (daya), and charity (daana). In Hinduism literature dedicated to yoga, self-restraint is expounded with the concept of \"yamas\" (). According to \"ṣaṭsampad\", self-restraint (\"dama\") is one of the six cardinal virtues.\n\nThe list of virtues that constitute a moral life evolve in vedas and upanishads. Over time, new virtues were conceptualized and added, some replaced, others merged. For example, Manusamhita initially listed ten virtues necessary for a human being to live a \"dharmic\" (moral) life: \"Dhriti\" (courage), \"Kshama\" (forgiveness), \"Dama\" (temperance), \"Asteya\" (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), \"Saucha\" (purity), \"Indriyani-graha\" (control of senses), \"dhi\" (reflective prudence), \"vidya\" (wisdom), \"satyam\" (truthfulness), \"akrodha\" (free from anger). In later verses this list was reduced to five virtues by the same scholar, by merging and creating a more broader concept. The shorter list of virtues became: \"Ahimsa\" (Non-violence), \"Dama\" (temperance), \"Asteya\" (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), \"Saucha\" (purity), \"Satyam\" (truthfulness). This trend of evolving concepts continue in classical Sanskrit literature, \"Dama\" with \"Ahimsa\" and few other virtues present in the evolving list of virtues necessary for a moral life (\"dharma\").\n\nFive types of self-restraints are considered essential for a moral and ethical life in Hindu philosophy: one must refrain from any violence that causes injury to others, refrain from starting or propagating deceit and falsehood, refrain from theft of other's property, refrain from sexually cheating on one's partner, and refrain from avarice. The scope of self-restraint includes one's action, the words one speaks or writes, and in one's thoughts. The necessity for temperance is explained as preventing bad \"karma\" which sooner or later haunts and returns to the unrestrained. The theological need for self-restraint is also explained as reigning in the damaging effect of one's action on others, as hurting another is hurting oneself because all life is one.\n\nTemperance in Jainism is deeply imbibed in its five major vows which are:\n\nIn Jainism, the vow of Ahimsa is not just restricted to not resorting to physical violence, but it also encompasses in itself abstinence from violence in any and all form either by thought, speech or action.\n\nOn Samvatsari, the last day of Paryushan—the most prominent festival of Jainism—the Jains greet their friends and relatives on this last day with \"Micchāmi Dukkaḍaṃ\", seeking their forgiveness. The phrase is also used by Jains throughout the year when a person makes a mistake, or recollects making one in everyday life, or when asking for forgiveness in advance for inadvertent ones.\n\nValues of temperance are still advocated by more modern sources such as the Boy Scouts, William Bennett, and Ben Franklin. Philosophy has contributed a number of lessons to the study of traits, particularly in its study of injunctions and its listing and organizing of virtues.\n\n"}
{"id": "457432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=457432", "title": "Thaipusam", "text": "Thaipusam\n\nThaipusam or Thaipoosam () is a festival celebrated by the Tamil community on the full moon in the Tamil month of \"Thai\" (January/February). It is mainly observed in countries where there is a significant presence of Tamil community such as India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Mauritius Singapore, South Africa, Canada and other places where ethnic Hindu Tamils reside as a part of the local Indian diaspora population such as Réunion, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica and the other parts of the Caribbean.\n\nIt is a national holiday in many countries like Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Mauritius and Fiji. In Singapore, it was a national holiday once but it was removed from Singapore holidays. \n\nNote: In Fiji, Thaipusam is not officially declared as a national holiday, while in certain states of Malaysia and in the nations of Sri Lanka and Mauritius it is a government and a bank holiday.\n\nThe word \"Thaipusam\" is a combination of the name of the month, \"Thai\", and the name of a star, \"Pusam\". This particular star is at its highest point during the festival. The festival commemorates the occasion when Parvati gave Murugan a Vel \"spear\" so he could vanquish the evil demon Soorapadman. It is commonly believed that Thaipusam marks Murugan's birthday; Some other sources suggest that Vaikhasi Vishakam, which falls in the Vaikhasi month (May/June), is Murugan's birthday.\n\nThis festival was, according to one tradition, said to have been supposedly created during one of the battles between the Asuras (or to be more specific Soorapadman) and the Devas. At one point, the latter were defeated several times by the former. The Devas were unable to resist the onslaught of the Asura forces. In despair, they approached Shiva and entreated to give them an able leader under whose heroic leadership they might obtain victory over the Asuras. They surrendered themselves completely and prayed to Shiva. Shiva granted their request by creating the mighty warrior, Skanda, out of his own power or Achintya Shakti. He at once assumed leadership of the celestial forces, inspired them and defeated the Asura forces and to recognise that day the people created the festival, Thaipusam.\n\nAccording to Skanda Puranam, the legend of Murugan, and Thirupugal which are divine verses on Murugan, adhere to Shaivam principles. Murugan is the embodiment of Shiva's light and wisdom and devotees pray to him to overcome the obstacles they face, as He is the divine vanquisher of evil. The motive of Thaipusam festival is to pray to God to receive his grace so that bad traits are destroyed.\n\nThe \"Kavadi Attam\" (\"Burden Dance\", also written as \"cavadee\") is the ceremonial sacrifice and offering performed by devotees during the worship of Murugan. It is often performed during the festival of Thaipusam and emphasizes debt bondage. The \"Kavadi\" itself is a physical burden through which the devotees implore for help from Murugan. \n\nDevotees prepare for the celebration by cleansing themselves through prayer and fasting for 48 days before Thaipusam. \"Kavadi\"-bearers have to perform elaborate ceremonies at the time of assuming the \"kavadi\" and at the time of offering it to Murugan. The \"kavadi\"-bearer observes celibacy and consumes only certain types of foods known as Satvik food, once a day, while continuously thinking of God. On the day of the festival, devotees shave their heads and undertake a pilgrimage along a set route, while engaging in various acts of devotion, notably carrying various types of \"kavadi\" (burdens).\n\nAt its simplest, this may entail carrying a pot of milk, but mortification of the flesh by piercing the skin, tongue or cheeks with \"vel\" skewers is also common. The simplest \"kavadi\" is a semicircular decorated canopy supported by a wooden rod that is carried on the shoulders to the temple. In addition, some have a small spear through their tongue, or a spear through the cheeks.\". \n\nA similar practice is performed by the Nagarathar community in Pazhani, India. This is known as the Nagarathar Kavadi.\n\nIn Palani Sri Dhandayuthapani temple, 10 day Festival (Brahmotsavam) is held during ThaiPusam. Thirukalyanam (Celestial Wedding) will be held on the day before Thaipusam. On Thaipusam, Therottam will be held. Lord Muthukumaraswamy will bless devotees in Thanga Guthirai Vahanam (Golden Horse), Periya Thanga Mayil Vahanam (Golden Peacock, Theppotsavam (Float Festival) during the 10 day festival\n\nIn Chidamabaram (Thillai) Panchamurthi Veedhi Ula, Thirthavari, Thaandava Darsanam Aarthi will be held on Thai Poosam. In Madurai Sri Meenakshi Amman Temple, Sri Meenakshi Sundareshwarar Theppotsavam (Float Festival) will be held at Mariammam Theppa Kulam. In Mylapore Kapaleeswarar Temple, 3 Day Theppotsavam will be held during ThaiPusam Pournami.\n\nAt the Linga Bhairavi temple in Coimbatore, devotees participate in a 21-day Shivanga sadhana, which ends on Thaipusam at the temple. Women offer \"kudam\" or pots of plants, grain and fruit, which they carry on their heads over a certain distance.\n\nOutside India, Thaipusam celebrations take place in USA, Mauritius, Malaysia and Singapore. It is a public holiday in several states in Malaysia. In Malaysia, the temple at Batu Caves, near Kuala Lumpur & Arulmigu Balathandayuthapani Temple, Penang near George Town, Penang & Nattukkottai Chettiar Temple, Penang and Ipoh Kallumalai,Perak, often attracts over one million devotees and tens of thousands of tourists. \n\nIn Singapore, Hindu devotees start their procession at the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple in the early morning, carrying milk pots as offerings or attaching \"kavadis\" and spikes pierced on their body. The procession travels for 4 kilometres before finishing at Tank Road, Sri Thendayuthapani Temple. \n\nIn Indonesia, the procession mainly held in the capital of North Sumatra province, Medan. On the eve of Thaipusam, the Hindus gathered together at \"Sree Soepramaniem Nagarattar Temple\" at \"Kejaksaan Road\" to accompanying a 125 years old chariot or locally known as \"Radhoo\" from the temple to the main temple \nnearby (about 2-3km) at Sri Mariamman Temple at Kampung Madras which opening for 24-hours for the festival. The \"kavadi\" procession are also happening at the day, but it takes on different temples around Medan and other parts in the province depends on them celebrate it.\n\nIn the United States of America, the Shiva Murugan Temple in Concord, California celebrates the Thaipoosam preceded by a walk. Some people walk more than 46 miles from the city of Fremont, some walk 21 miles from the city of San Ramon to Concord, and most walk 7 miles from Walden Park in Walnut Creek to Concord. Over 2000 people participated in the walk for last several years.\n\n"}
