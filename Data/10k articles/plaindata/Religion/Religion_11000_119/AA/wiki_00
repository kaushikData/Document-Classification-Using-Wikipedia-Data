The edition includes 20 Hades paintings from this cycle and the art critical essays written by three art historians Alexander Yakimovich, Olga Yushkowa and Jean-Christophe Ammann, professor at the Goethe University Frankfurt in Frankfurt and the director of the Museum of Modern Art in 1991-2001.\n\nAll paintings of the cycle the artist herself calls visual metaphors to the book and not illustrations. The first half of Hades' cycle begins addressing the Last Man, \"who makes everything small\". The last man is sneaky and coward, he takes no risks, but he wants success and comfort. The second half of the cycle is devoted to Zarathustra himself and to his friend — the eagle.\n\nIn Lena Hades interview with Nietzsche.ru portal, she told about the prehistory of the cycle. \"To be very brief, in my case, there was the birth of painting from the spirit of the text. An artist was born inside me only due to Nietzsche. Without Nietzsche I would never have decided to become a professional artist, to abandon from all other \"callings\" in favor of painting. It was a difficult decision, because the artist is easy to die from starvation. Very easy. Prior to Nietzsche I naively believed in many things that I had been imposed on by the surrounding society. I believed, for example, in culture, science, friendship, love, and church. A lot of things were unshakeable for me, and I lived with the ideas about them established without me. But when I first read Zarathustra - this text insulted me in all my best beliefs and convictions. It didn’t leave even the slightest hint of these my naive notions, it denied everything. Everything turned out not so, as I thought. And since it hurt me so, I began to read it more carefully. And gradually I realized that in general it was right that the world is not what it seems to us, not what our parents and social environment tries to teach us, or in other words, social suggestion of the world does not match the reality of the world. And most importantly - the real world has values completely different from the \"conventional\" values of any taken separately culture. All this led to the inner upheaval and change in attitude. I saw the world with different eyes. With Nietzsche’s eyes! And then his eyes for some reason just became my eyes. Apparently, there is a certain spiritual affinity between us, which allows me now to breathe easy his texts\".\n\"Your works, especially large ones, are dominated by these expressive saturated reds and yellows, creating an atmosphere of condensed semi-insanity, inhuman, demonic tension. Therefore, your paintings crush with their power and heavy energy. Heavy pressing power. You have it anywhere. Is that the feeling you have due to Nietzsche’s texts?\" \nLena Hades replies \"For me, this is what the nakedness of life is, or more precisely, its halkion element. And somehow none of the Nietzsche experts have ever paid any attention to this halkion perception of Nietzsche. And yet, in ECCE HOMO Nietzsche calls himself a halkioner. I think that Nietzsche borrowed the word \"halkioner\" from Ancient Greek, which he knew brilliantly. In ancient Greek \"halkeyo\" means \"to be a blacksmith, to forge.\" A halkion element is a kind of a forging element, not just chthonic, underground, but forging, where metal melts and is forged. This is a kind of an inner smithy, where the character is forged, and human will and strength are forged.\"\n\nJean-Christophe Ammann called the painting of the series tablets. \"Figurative language of Lena Hades expresses itself often intentionally as a poster, because we see here some visual tablets which should stir and awaken. At the same time, the language of her images remains faithful to the fundamental task of the artist: every artist should be a dervish, not only in order to conjure the collective memory, being in constant motion, but also to stay in the thought and memory of our times. Lena Hades is a dervish.\"\n\n\n"}

The island of Dominica was specifically listed as an objective for plans on spreading the religion in 1939 by Shoghi Effendi, who succeeded `Abdu'l-Baha as head of the religion. In 1983, William Nedden is credited with being the first pioneer to Dominica (he arrived on April 19, 1966) at the festivities associated with the inaugural election of the Dominican Bahá'ís National Spiritual Assembly with Hand of the Cause, Dhikru'llah Khadem representing the Universal House of Justice. Later research records Ivor Ellard arrived two days before, April 17, 1966. The first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly of Dominica was elected in 1976. Since then, Bahá'ís have participated in several projects for the benefit of the wider community, and in 2001 various sources report between less than 1.4% and up to 1.7% of the island's approximately 70,000 citizens are Bahá'ís.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention Latin American regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919—after the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. The first actions on the part of Bahá'í community towards Latin America were that of a few individuals who made trips to Mexico and South America near or before this unveiling in 1919, including Mr. and Mrs. Frankland, and Roy C. Wilhelm, and Martha Root. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919.\n\nHis Holiness Christ says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the world and summon the people to the Kingdom of God.…(travel to) the Islands of the West Indies, such as Cuba, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, the Islands of the Lesser Antilles (which includes Dominca), Bahama Islands, even the small Watling Island, have great importance…\n\nShoghi Effendi wrote a cable on May 1, 1936 to the Bahá'í Annual Convention of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of `Abdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin. In his cable he wrote:\n\nAppeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by `Abdu'l-Bahá in \"Tablets of the Divine Plan\". Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Bahá'í Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh and establish structural basis of His World Order.\nFollowing the May 1 cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent pioneers to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bahá'í North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bahá'ís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the Bahá'í House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois. In 1937 the \"First Seven Year Plan\" (1937–44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bahá'ís the goal of establishing the Bahá'í Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bahá'ís in Latin American, Bahá'í communities and Local Spiritual Assemblies began to form in 1938 across the rest of Latin America. Dominica was specifically listed as an objective for plans on spreading the religion in 1939. There is a record of an Elena Marsella, from Boston, in Dominica before June 1947 though other sources claim no Bahá'í had settled in Dominica through 1966 and other references of Marella show her in the Dominican Republic.\n\nAs far back as 1951 the Bahá'ís had organized a regional National Assembly for the combination of Mexico, Central America and the Antilles islands. A Bahá'í made a trip to Dominica specifically to try to reach the Carib Indians on May 7, 1959. Pioneers arrived on April 17 (Ivor Ellard) and 19 (William Nedden), 1966. From 1966 the region was reorganized among the Bahá'ís of Leeward, Windward and Virgin Islands with its seat in Charlotte Amalie with Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assemblies in neighboring islands to Dominica by the end of 1963. Nedden moved to other nearby islands. For five weeks in 1970 Hand of the Cause Ruhiyyih Khanum toured Caribbean Islands. On the island of Dominica she could only find one Bahá'í, a pioneer from Haita, as the rest were semi-nomadic. From 1972 the regional assembly was reorganized for Barbados, St. Lucia, Dominica, St. Vincent, Grenada and other Windward Islands. About December 1975 Bahá´ís again visited the Carib Indians; this time leaving them with Bahá'í literature. The first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly of Dominica was elected in 1976 in St. George. In 1977 the first Carib joined the religion Joe Rabess. In 1978 assemblies were elected in St. Luke, St. Paul and St. Joseph. In 1979, Category 5 Hurricane David impacted Dominca and Errol (Bobby) Martin, who was vice-chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the Leeward and Virgin Islands and an officer of the Montserrat Amateur Radio Society provided the lone link off the island for communication for some time.\n\nEarly in 1983 a team of Dominican Bahá'ís set out to tour several cities and villages to makes contact isolated Bahá'ís as well as promulgate the religion in new areas - they may have been the first time to do so composed only of Dominican citizens. Later in 1983 Hand of the Cause Dhikru'llah Khadem represented the Universal House of Justice, which succeeded Shoghi Effendi as the head of the religion, at the inaugural Convention for the National Spiritual Assembly of Dominica in Roseau. In October 1984 the Bahá'ís of Roseau held a youth conference. In 1988 the National Assembly oversaw the translation and publication of the Hidden Words of Bahá'u'lláh.\n\nSince its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. In 1982 the Bahá'ís starting holding observances of World Religion Day and in 1986 the observance included a tribute of Martin Luther King, Jr. by a Dominican official brought the largest audience so far and coverage by national radio news. Through the rest of 1986 the distribution of a publication of the Universal House of Justice, \"The Promise of World Peace\" reached a point where it or the author were noticed in a number of venues from non-Bahá'ís until the Bahá'ís themselves lead a procession through several villages and an art contest celebrating peace. In 1988 Carib Indians from Belize visited Dominica as part of a \"Trail of Light\" series of events Bahá'í Native Americans have been undertaking. Interviews of the travelers was taken and broadcast on Dominican radio several times as well as in print for the island newspaper. Public performances and private audiences between the visiting and native Caribs took place. In 1989 a translation in Creole of The Hidden Words was published and was recognized as a contribution to the preservation of the Dominican culture. In 1990 teams of Caribbean youth traveled among the islands and a team went to Dominica and worked for the Association for the Disabled. In 2000 Bahá'ís of Dominica hosted a prayer gathering in an auditorium at the University of West Indies Centre in Roseau and accomplished literacy and education projects. The Dominican government supported the United Nations General Assembly vote on the \"Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran\" (A/56/583/Add.3 Draft Resolution) on 19 December 2001.\n\nAccording to the 2001 population and housing census for Dominica, 1.4% of the population belonged to \"other\" religious groups, including the Bahá'í Faith. However, the 2001 World Christian Database reported 1.7% of Dominicans were Bahá'ís.\n\n"}

Their total population is approximately 3000. The notable features of Buguns are reflected in their simple life and warm hospitality. Buguns live in several exogamous clans. Traditionally, the predominant occupation was agriculture, supported with other allied activities like fishing and hunting, cattle rearing etc. Buguns have their own folklores, songs, dances, music and rituals. A rare bird, the Bugun liocichla, was named after the tribe.\n\nThey live mainly in the subtropical Singchung Administrative Sub-Division of West Kameng district with its, almost whole, native population under 6-Thrizino-Buragaon ST Assembly Constituency of the state of Arunachal Pradesh. According to the native legend, they believed that they are the descendants of a single forefather Achinphumphulua.\n\nThe Bugun language, one of the Bugunish/Kamenic language under Kho-Bwa languages is listed as an endangered languages of India.\n\nActing as a basis of their livelihood, shifting cultivation is practiced and domestic animals such as cow, horse, pig, sheep, goat, fowl and the mithun are reared. To enrich their diet, wild animals are hunted using simple spears, traps, bows and arrows.\n\nLike Miji and Aka, long hair is kept by some members of both sexes. While the both sexes adorn themselves with silver ornaments, the men wear a very long white garment and a very high hat, resembling a Turkish Fez. The women wear a skull cap, sometimes decorated with beautiful patterns. White and checkered jackets are worn as well, usually accompanied by another singlet.\n\nThe Buguns are traditionally followers of the animistic religion However, the early 20th century witnessed the gradual penetration of some dominant religions like Buddhism (Mahayana), particularly from the neighbouring ethnic group Sherdukpen, and Hinduism. Some have come under Tibetan Buddhist influence. Profound Buddhist influence has led to the adoption of many Buddhist rituals and the invitation of Buddhist lamas to participate in their communal rituals. As a result, many Buguns declared themselves as Buddhist in censuses. Recently, some Buguns have converted to Christianity. Nevertheless, a large portion of Bugun (Khowa) population are still following their tradition way of animistic rituals and priesthood.\n\nPham-Kho (a harvesting festival) is a popular festival of the Bugun people which is now celebrated on 10 September every year. Pham Kho Sowai literally means \"mountain\" (\"pham\") and \"river\" or \"water\" (\"kho\"), which are considered vital component required for human survival. The benevolent gods manifest in the form of the mountain and river, giving life to the people. Therefore, the Pham-Kho festival is a harvesting festival celebrated by Bugun (Khowa) community of Arunachal Pradesh. Other Important festival of Buguns are Kshyat-Sowai and Dihing-Kho.\n\nEspecially in Sraiba (a holy place with a ground for worship and related rituals) of every major villages, Kshyatsowai/Dihing Kho and Pham Kho is celebrated by the Bugun, in which the Phabi priest plays an important role in conducting the ceremony and religious rituals. Songs and dances such as Clown and Gasisiu have a close affiliation with their religion. Feasts during these festivals mainly includes their traditional foods and Phua (local brew).\n\nTraditionally, Buguns have their own socio-politico-admimistrative decision-making system to regulate their society. The traditional village council of the Bugun (Khowa) is known as Nimiyang (Council of Elders), which looks after every aspect of village life, may it be decision-making, utilization of local resources, conflict resolution or regulating the society. Each family is represented in the Nimiang sessions by its head male member. The traditional village council of buguns are headed by Thap-Bkhow (Chief). The Thap-Bkhow is an accepted leader and selected unanimously and not hereditary. There is no strict criterion for selection of the Thap-Bakhow, but a person with economic affluence, social stature, knowledge of customary laws, sound mentality, physical strength and generosity are taken into consideration. He presides over the meetings and sittings of the Nimiyang session. It is customary that only male member possessing above qualities can become Thap-Bakhow. Women may witnesses proceedings of the Nimiyang sessions, but can only contribute if its male member is absent.\n\nMigration of Buguns to its present location are unknown. However, their mythology reveals that they have probably migrated from Tibet via East Kameng.(Buguns are subdivided into sections according to their specific locality known by different names:-Hakhongdua, Hajidua, Braidua, Khuchundua, Hayindua).\n\nSome of the Bugun Villages are:-\n\nBuguns maintained good relations with their neighbouring tribes since they are surrounded by tribes like Sherdukpen, Aka (Hrusso), Monpa (Especially, Bhut Monpa/Sartang)and Mijis. \n\n\nBesides these, we will find many other NGOs working actively in some specific areas within Bugun territory like:- BWS- Bugun Welfare Society, Mt.

{"id": "217231", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=217231", "title": "Curb Your Enthusiasm", "text": "Curb Your Enthusiasm\n\nCurb Your Enthusiasm is an American comedy television series produced and broadcast by HBO that premiered on October 15, 2000. The series was created by Larry David starring as a fictionalized version of himself. The series follows Larry in his life as a semi-retired television writer and producer in Los Angeles and later New York City. Also starring are Cheryl Hines as his wife Cheryl, Jeff Garlin as his manager and best friend Jeff, and Susie Essman as Jeff's wife Susie. \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" often features guest stars, and many of these appearances are by celebrities playing versions of themselves fictionalized to varying degrees.\n\nThe plots and subplots of the episodes are established in an outline written by David, and the dialogue is largely improvised by the actors (a technique known as retroscripting). As with \"Seinfeld\", which David co-created, the subject matter in \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" often involves the minutiae of American daily social life, and plots often revolve around Larry David's many faux pas and his problems with certain social conventions and expectations, as well as his annoyance with other people's behavior. The character has a hard time letting such annoyances go unexpressed, which often leads him into awkward situations. He is also routinely the victim of elaborate misunderstandings wherein other characters believe that he has done something morally terrible or disgusting.\n\nThe series was developed from a 1999 one-hour special, \"Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm\", which David and HBO originally envisioned as a one-time project. The special was shot as a mockumentary, where the characters were aware of the presence of cameras and a crew. The series itself is not a mock documentary but is shot in a somewhat similar, cinéma vérité-like style. \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" has received high critical acclaim and has grown in popularity since its debut. It has been nominated for 38 Primetime Emmy Awards, and Robert B. Weide received an Emmy for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for the episode \"Krazee Eyez Killa\". The show won the 2002 Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy.\n\nAfter the eighth season concluded in September 2011, \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" went on an indefinite hiatus. The series finally returned for a ninth season in October 2017, while a tenth season is in production as of October 2018.\n\nThe series stars Larry David as an extreme fictionalized version of himself. Like the real-life David, the character is well known in the entertainment industry as the co-creator and main co-writer of the highly successful sitcom \"Seinfeld\". For most of the series, the Larry David character is living a married-without-children life in Los Angeles with his wife, Cheryl (played by Cheryl Hines). David's main confidant on the show is his manager, Jeff Greene (played by \"Curb\" executive producer Jeff Garlin), who has a temperamental and occasionally vulgar wife, Susie (Susie Essman). A large portion of the show's many guest stars are celebrities and public figures, such as actors, comedians, sportspeople, and politicians, who play themselves. These include David's longtime friend Richard Lewis as well as Ted Danson and his wife, Mary Steenburgen, who all have recurring roles as fictionalized versions of themselves.\n\nThe show is set and filmed in various affluent Westside communities of (and occasionally in downtown) Los Angeles, as well as in the adjacent cities of Beverly Hills, Culver City, Brentwood, and Santa Monica. David's hometown of New York City is also featured in some episodes, most prominently in the eighth season.\n\nAlthough David maintains an office, he leads a semiretired life in the series and is rarely shown working regularly, other than in season two, when he tries to create a failed pilot for Jason Alexander and later Julia Louis-Dreyfus, in season four, which centered on his being cast as the lead in the Mel Brooks musical \"The Producers\", and in season seven, writing a \"Seinfeld\" reunion show. Most of the series revolves around David's interactions with his friends and acquaintances, with David often at odds with the other characters, usually to his detriment. Despite this, the characters do not seem to harbor ill feelings toward each other for any extended period, and the cast has stayed stable throughout the show.\n\nDavid has explained the show's title in TV interviews as reflecting his perception that many people seem to live their lives projecting false enthusiasm, which he believes is used to imply that \"they are better than you\". This conflicts with his dry style. The title also urges the audience not to expect too much from the show; at the time of the premiere, David wanted to lower expectations after \"Seinfeld\"'s phenomenal success.\n\n\nAmong the show's many recurring roles, Richard Lewis, Ted Danson, and Wanda Sykes play fictionalized versions of themselves as old friends of Larry's with whom he frequently butts heads. Shelley Berman plays Larry's father, Nat David. Bob Einstein frequently appears as Marty Funkhouser, another of Larry's oldest friends. Kaitlin Olson recurred as Becky, Cheryl's sister. In seasons six and seven, Vivica A. Fox appears as Loretta Black, a member of the Black family, a family of hurricane evacuees who take refuge in Larry's house upon Cheryl's invitation. Loretta eventually becomes Larry's primary love interest for a time once he and Cheryl split up.\n\nCelebrities, including actors, comedians, authors, musicians and athletes, often make guest appearances on the show, with a large portion of them playing themselves, or fictional versions thereof. Some of these guest stars are Mary Steenburgen, Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft, Michael York, Martin Scorsese, Ben Stiller and Christine Taylor, Martin Short, Jimmy Kimmel, Lucy Lawless, David Schwimmer, Shaquille O'Neal, Rosie O'Donnell, Ricky Gervais, Michael J. Fox, Salman Rushdie, Hugh Hefner, Alanis Morissette, Bill Buckner, Mookie Wilson, and the main cast of \"Seinfeld\" – Jerry Seinfeld, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jason Alexander and Michael Richards. Notable people who filled in fictional roles include Bea Arthur, Ed Asner, Sacha Baron Cohen, Stephen Colbert, Steve Coogan, Gina Gershon, Dustin Hoffman, Samantha Mathis, Tim Meadows, Bob Odenkirk, Elisabeth Shue and Frank Whaley.\n\n\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" episodes are typically named after an event, object, or person that figures prominently in the plot, similarly to how \"Seinfeld\" episodes were named. Many episodes concern breaches of intricate aspects of social conventions, such as the various details of tipping at restaurants, the obligation to \"stop and chat\" upon meeting an acquaintance, the allowed amount of caviar one may put on a cracker at a house party, and whether a house guest needs the permission of the homeowner before taking a soft drink from the refrigerator. And some involve the etiquette of extremely complex and unique circumstances, such as the occasion when Larry discovered at a wake that the deceased was to be buried with his favorite golf club—borrowed from Larry. Another involved Larry picking up a prostitute for the sole purpose of using the carpool lane on the freeway. In many episodes, \"Curb\"—like its predecessor \"Seinfeld\"—tied together apparently unrelated events woven throughout a given episode into an unforced climax that resolves the story lines simultaneously, either to Larry's advantage or detriment.\n\nWhile each episode has a distinct individual plot, most seasons feature a story arc that extends across several episodes throughout the season and culminates in a season finale that often features the return of many of the characters that appeared throughout the season.\n\nThe style and the characters of the show are introduced across a series of mostly isolated episodes, in the only season without a major story arc.\n\nCheryl is tired of Larry not working, so he begins to develop a new television show, initially with guest stars Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (George and Elaine, respectively, on \"Seinfeld\") as themselves. But Larry's constant social faux pas ruin the chances of the show being financed by a major television network.\n\nLarry invests in a restaurant enterprise that eventually opens despite many mishaps, most of which are Larry's fault.\n\nMel Brooks casts Larry as the lead in his hit musical \"The Producers\". Cheryl also gives Larry the opportunity to have sex with another woman before their tenth anniversary as an anniversary gift she had promised him before they got married.\n\nLarry's friend Richard Lewis gets very ill and requires a kidney transplant. Larry is a match, but spends the season looking for other sources of a kidney for Lewis. Also in season five, Larry suspects he may be adopted and embarks on a search for his biological parents.\n\nThe season is built around Cheryl persuading Larry to take in a family that is left homeless after a major Gulf Coast hurricane. Later in the season, Cheryl leaves Larry, mimicking Laurie David's real-life divorce. He spends the rest of the season either fighting for her to come back or looking for another woman.\n\nSeason seven is centered on creating a \"Seinfeld\" reunion show with the original cast. Larry attempts to use the project as a means to reunite with Cheryl.\n\nLarry remains single after his divorce. At the midpoint of the season, all the main characters travel to New York City, where the rest of the season is set.\n\nOn June 14, 2016, it was announced that Larry David would be returning for a ninth season of \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" after a five-year hiatus. He announced his return: \"In the immortal words of Julius Caesar, 'I left, I did nothing, I returned.'\" In addition to David, Jeff Garlin, Cheryl Hines, Susie Essman, J.B. Smoove, Bob Einstein, Richard Lewis, Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen also returned. Guest stars included Bryan Cranston, Lauren Graham, Jimmy Kimmel, Nick Offerman, Elizabeth Banks, Ed Begley Jr., Carrie Brownstein, Nasim Pedrad, Elizabeth Perkins, June Diane Raphael, Casey Wilson, Andrea Savage, Damon Wayans Jr., Steven Weber, Katie Aselton and Judge Judy Sheindlin. Production for season 9 started on November 11, 2016. On July 10, 2017, HBO announced that the ten-episode ninth season would premiere on October 1, 2017.\n\nSeason 9 sees Larry return from a prolonged hiatus six years after the events of the season 8 finale. Larry incurs a fatwa from the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, after lampooning the Ayatollahs while appearing on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" in promotion of his latest, long-awaited project, a comedy musical called \"Fatwa!\", centered around \"The Satanic Verses\" controversy, in which Ayatollah Khomeini ordered a fatwa against Salman Rushdie in 1989.\n\n\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" is one of the most acclaimed television shows of the 2000s, praised particularly for its writing and the actors' improvisational comedy. The show has enjoyed largely positive critical reception since its debut and a steadily growing, dedicated audience that helped it emerge from its early \"cult\" status.\n\nOn Metacritic, the first season of the show scored 80 out of 100 (based on 20 reviews), 93 for season 3 (based on 12 reviews), 88 for season 4 (18 reviews), 91 for season 5 (five reviews), 89 for season 6 (nine reviews), 81 for season 7 (18 reviews), 86 for season 8 (six reviews) and 74 for season 9 (10 reviews).\n\n\"Slate\" named the characters of Cheryl David and Susie Greene as two of the best on television and as reasons to look forward to the return of the show in the fall of 2007. \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" has also received praise from \"Galus Australis\" magazine for being even more unabashedly Jewish than the \"Seinfeld\" series.\n\nOf the show's depiction of Jewish characters, academic Vincent Brook stated, \"\"Curb\"s commitment to Jewish identification greatly enhances its storytelling capacity, as it lends greater realism and dimension to the characters and opens the show up to episodes with meaningful Jewish themes.\"\n\nThe character of Larry on the show is in many ways reminiscent of the \"Schlemiel\" character often present in traditional Yiddish folklore. The \"schlemiel\" is usually a comic character whose actions lead to his inevitable downfall, but also stands as a form of resistance to social and cultural values and norms. David Gillota wrote: \n\nIn 2016, Rob Sheffield of \"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" as the 19th greatest television series ever made.\n\nJournalist James Andrew Miller made the first chapter of his new podcast \"Origins\" about \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\". The chapter goes across five episodes and was released on September 6, 2017. It documents the genesis of the series, and uses conversations with people involved in the show. The conversations themselves are also released.\n\nThe series has received a total of 43 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, winning twice: Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series for Robert B. Weide for \"Krazee-Eyez Killa\" in 2003, and Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series for Steven Rasch for \"Palestinian Chicken\" in 2012. The series has received eight nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series. Larry David has received six nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. Cheryl Hines has received two nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. Shelley Berman and Michael J. Fox have each received a nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series. The series has also received ten nominations for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series. The ninth season received four nominations at the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards, for Outstanding Comedy Series, Larry David for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, and Bryan Cranston and Lin-Manuel Miranda each for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.\n\nThe series has also received five Golden Globe Award nominations (in 2003 and 2006) and won for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy in 2003. Larry David has been nominated for three Golden Globes for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy in 2003, 2005, and 2006. It has been nominated for four Screen Actors Guild Awards, two for Larry David and two for the ensemble cast. It has been nominated six times for the Producers Guild of America Award, winning twice in 2003 and 2005. It has been nominated for eleven Directors Guild of America Awards, winning twice for Bryan Gordon for \"The Special Section\" in 2003 and Robert B. Weide for \"Palestinian Chicken\" in 2012. It has been nominated fives times for the Writers Guild of America Award, winning once in 2006.\n\nWhen aired in syndication, the series is edited from its original HBO broadcast (for running time and without the TV-MA scenes). On June 2, 2010, the series premiered on the TV Guide Network, making its basic cable debut. The network also recorded a series of related discussions with high-profile guest stars, media pundits, and prominent social figures called \"Curb: The Discussion\" debating the moral implications depicted in each episode. The show debuted in syndication on WGN America in September 2010, but was removed from syndication on WGN America the following year due to low ratings. Between 2010 and 2014 the show aired on MyNetworkTV. It debuted on TV Land in February 2013.\n\n\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" seasons come in a two-disc DVD set with ten episodes.\n\nA \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" book was released October 19, 2006, published by Gotham Books. The book contains stories from Larry David's past, original interviews and commentary, episode outlines, episode guide, and over 100 full-color photographs. The contents of the book span the first five seasons of the show.\n\nThe show is punctuated between scenes with music orchestrated by Wendell Yuponce and from a music library company called Killer Tracks. Frequently heard are instrumental arrangements of the whimsical \"Three Little Maids From School Are We\" from The Mikado, and the rhythmic Gypsy dance \"Les tringles des sistres tintaient\" from Carmen. The opening and closing theme song (not mentioned in the credits) is \"Frolic\" by Italian composer Luciano Michelini. Larry David heard the music used in a bank commercial years before the show was created and thought it had a lighthearted, joyful quality. An unofficial soundtrack was released by Mellowdrama Records in 2006.\n\n"}

He was ordained to the priesthood on 10 July 1910, and finished his studies in 1912.\n\nRuffini taught at the Major Roman Seminary (1913–1930), and then the Pontifical Urbaniana University (1917–1929). Raised to the rank of Monsignor in 1925, he was appointed Secretary of the Congregation of Seminaries and Universities on 28 October 1928. Ruffini was made a Protonotary Apostolic on 15 June 1931. In 1930, Ruffini was made Prefect of Studies at the Pontifical Lateran University, of which he was named rector \"magnifico\" in the following year. Noted for his interest in science, Ruffini founded the Medical Biological Union of St. Luke, examining the relationships between Catholicism and science, in 1944.\n\nOn 11 October 1945, he was named Archbishop of Palermo by Pope Pius XII. Ruffini received his episcopal consecration on the following 8 December from Giuseppe Cardinal Pizzardo, with Archbishop Francesco Duca and Bishop Domenico Menna serving as co-consecrators. Ruffini was created Cardinal-Priest of \"S. Sabina\" by Pius XII in the consistory of 18 February 1946. He was the first cardinal-designate to place his wardrobe order to the Gamarelli episcopal tailors, which he did the same morning as the announcement of his elevation to the Sacred College. He later participated in the 1958 papal conclave, which selected Pope John XXIII. Cardinal Ruffini was also among the \"papabili\" at that conclave.\n\nDuring his tenure as Palermo's archbishop, he supported Francisco Franco, but protested against Communism and anti-Mafia activist Danilo Dolci. He also demanded that the Sicilian bandit Salvatore Giuliano cease murdering within Palermo, and was cautious to be tricked into implying that the Mafia was the main problem of Sicily. To a journalist's question of \"What is the Mafia?\" he responded: \"So far as I know, it could be a brand of detergent.\"\n\nA stern opponent of reform, he attended the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965), and sat on its Board of Presidency. Ruffini was also part of the conservative-minded study group Coetus Internationalis Patrum at the council. He was forced to intervene in a heated discussion between Cardinals Alfredo Ottaviani and Augustin Bea in the course of the last preparatory session of the Council. During the discussion on the Council's proposed declaration against anti-Semitism, Cardinal Ruffini accused the document of being overly kind to the Jews, whom he saw as hostile to Christianity. He also disapproved of \"Gaudium et spes\", \"Sacrosanctum Concilium\", and \"Dignitatis humanae\".\n\nCardinal Ruffini was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1963 papal conclave, which selected Pope Paul VI.\n\nHe died from a heart attack in Palermo, at age 79.

{"id": "80833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=80833", "title": "François Rabelais", "text": "François Rabelais\n\nFrançois Rabelais (; ; between 1483 and 1494 – 9 April 1553) was a French Renaissance writer, physician, Renaissance humanist, monk and Greek scholar. He has historically been regarded as a writer of fantasy, satire, the grotesque, bawdy jokes and songs. His best known work is \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\". Because of his literary power and historical importance, Western literary critics consider him one of the great writers of world literature and among the creators of modern European writing. His literary legacy is such that today, the word \"Rabelaisian\" has been coined as a descriptive inspired by his work and life. Merriam-Webster defines the word as describing someone or something that is \"marked by gross robust humor, extravagance of caricature, or bold naturalism\".\n\nNo reliable documentation of the place or date of the birth of François Rabelais has survived. While some scholars put the date as early as 1483, he was probably born in November 1494 near Chinon in the province of Touraine, where his father worked as a lawyer. The estate of \"La Devinière\" in Seuilly in the modern-day Indre-et-Loire, allegedly the writer's birthplace, houses a Rabelais museum.\n\nRabelais became a novice of the Franciscan order, and later a friar at Fontenay-le-Comte in Poitou, where he studied Greek and Latin as well as science, philology, and law, already becoming known and respected by the humanists of his era, including Guillaume Budé (1467-1540). Harassed due to the directions of his studies and frustrated with the Franciscan order's ban on the study of Greek (because of Erasmus' commentary on the Greek version of the \"Gospel of Saint Luke\"), Rabelais petitioned Pope Clement VII (in office 1523-1534) and gained permission to leave the Franciscans and to enter the Benedictine order at Maillezais in Poitou, where he was more warmly received.\n\nLater he left the monastery to study medicine at the University of Poitiers and at the University of Montpellier. In 1532 he moved to Lyon, one of the intellectual centres of the Renaissance, and in 1534 began working as a doctor at the Hôtel-Dieu de Lyon (hospital), for which he earned 40 \"livres\" a year. During his time in Lyon, he edited Latin works for the printer Sebastian Gryphius, became friends with Étienne Dolet, and worked up the nerve to write to Erasmus. Gryphius published his translations of Hippocrates, Galen and Giovanni Mainardi. As a physician, he used his spare time to write and publish humorous pamphlets critical of established authority and preoccupied with the educational and monastic mores of the time.\n\nIn 1532, under the pseudonym Alcofribas Nasier (an anagram of François Rabelais), he published his first book, \"Pantagruel King of the Dipsodes\", the first of his \"Gargantua\" series. The idea of basing an allegory on the lives of giants came to Rabelais from the folklore legend of \"les Grandes chroniques du grand et énorme géant Gargantua\", which were sold as popular literature at the time in the form of inexpensive pamphlets by colporters and at the fairs of Lyon. Pantagruelisme is an \"eat, drink and be merry\" philosophy, which led his books into disfavor with the church, simultaneously brought them popular success and the admiration of later critics for their focus on the body. This first book, critical of the existing monastic and educational system, contains the first known occurrence in French of the words \"encyclopédie\", \"caballe\", \"progrès\" and \"utopie\" among others. Despite the book's popularity, both it and the subsequent prequel book (1534) about the life and exploits of Pantagruel's father Gargantua were condemned by the academics at the Sorbonne, in particular Guillaume Postel in 1543, for their unorthodox ideas and by the Roman Catholic Church for their derision of certain religious practices.\n\nRabelais taught medicine at Montpellier in 1534 and again in 1539. In 1537, Rabelais gave an anatomy lesson at Lyon's Hôtel-Dieu using the corpse of a hanged man. \n\nIn June 1543 Rabelais became a Master of Requests.\n\nBetween 1545 and 1547 François Rabelais lived in Metz, then a free imperial city and a republic, to escape the condemnation by the University of Paris. In 1547, he became curate of Saint-Christophe-du-Jambet in Maine and of Meudon near Paris, from which he resigned in January 1553 before his death in Paris in April 1553.\n\nThere aren't many speaking roles for women in the Rabelaisian adventures, not even in \"Le Tiers Livre\" where the recurrent theme is whether Panurge should marry or not. Pantagruel's mother, for example, dies in childbirth; Gargantua's mother (Gargamelle) fades from the story as soon as the newborn giant has climbed out her ear into life. This book was published under Rabelais' own name in 1546 and dedicated to King Francis I's sister Marguerite of Navarre, and was also banned by the Sorbonne. It revisited discussions he had had while working as a secretary to Geoffroy d'Estissac earlier in Poitiers, and with his patron Marguerite de Navarre shortly before she wrote the Heptameron \"la querelle des femmes\" was a lively subject of debate in intellectual circles at the time. \n\nWith support from members of the prominent du Bellay family, Rabelais received approval from King Francis I to continue to publish his collection. However, after the king's death in 1547, the academic élite frowned upon Rabelais, and the French Parlement suspended the sale of his fourth book (\"Le Quart Livre\") published in 1552.\n\nRabelais traveled frequently to Rome with his friend Cardinal Jean du Bellay, and lived for a short time in Turin (1540- ) as part of the household of du Bellay's brother, Guillaume, while king François I was his patron. Rabelais spent some time in hiding, under periodic threat of being condemned of heresy depending upon the health of his various protectors. Only the protection of du Bellay saved Rabelais after the condemnation of his novel by the Sorbonne.\n\n\"Gargantua and Pantagruel\" relates the adventures Gargantua and his son Pantagruel. The tales are adventurous and erudite, festive and gross, toxic ecumenical and rarely -- if ever -- solemn for long. The first book, chronologically, was Pantagruel and the Gargantua mentioned in the Prologue refers not to Rabelais' own work but to storybooks that were being sold at the Lyon fairs in the early 1530s. In the first chapter of the earliest book, Pantagruel's lineage is listed back 60 generations to a giant named Chalbroth. The narrator dismisses the skeptics of the time—who would have thought a giant far too large for Noah's Ark—stating that Hurtaly (the giant reigning during the flood and a great fan of soup) simply rode the Ark like a kid on a rocking horse, or like a fat Swiss guy on a canon. In the Prologue to \"Gargantua\" the narrator addresses : \"Most illustrious drinkers, and \"you\" the most precious pox-riddenfor to \"you\" and \"you\" alone are my writings dedicated ...\" before turning to Plato's \"Banquet\". An unprecedented syphilis epidemic had raged through Europe for over 30 years when the book was published, even the king of France was reputed to have been infected. Etion was the first giant in Pantagruel's list of ancestors to suffer from the disease. \n\nAlthough most chapters are humorous, wildly fantastic and frequently absurd, a few relatively serious passages have become famous for expressing humanistic ideals of the time. In particular, the chapters on Gargantua's boyhood and Gargantua's paternal letter to Pantagruel present a quite detailed vision of education.\n\nIn the first book, M. Alcofribas narrates the Abbey of Thélème, built by the giant Gargantua. It differs remarkably from the monastic norm, as the abbey is open to both monks and nuns, has a swimming pool, maid service, and no clocks in sight. Only the good-looking are permitted to enter. The inscription on the gate to the abbey first sets out who is unwelcome: hypocrites, bigots, the pox-ridden, Gothz, Magothz, the straw-chewing law clerks, usurious grinches, old or officious judges, and burners of heretics. When the members are defined positively, the text becomes more inviting:\n\n<poem>\n\nThe Thélèmites in the abbey live according to a single rule: DO WHAT YOU WANT.\n\nThe French Renaissance was a time of linguistic contact and debate. The first book of French, rather than Latin, grammar was published in 1530, followed nine years later by the language's first dictionary. Spelling was far less codified back then. Rabelais, as an educated reader of the day, preferred etymological spelling which preserved words' histories to more phonetic spellings which would wash them away.\n\nRabelais' use of Latin, Greek, regional and dialectal terms, creative calquing, gloss, neologism and mis-translation was the fruit of the printing press having been invented less than a hundred years earlier. A doctor by trade, Rabelais was a prolific reader, and wrote a great deal about bodies and all they excrete or ingest. His works are filled with multilingual, often sexual, puns, absurd creatures, bawdy songs and lists. Words and metaphors from Rabelais abound in modern French and some words, as mentioned above, have even found their way into English, through Thomas Urquhart's 1693 translation.\n\nMost scholars today agree that the French author wrote from a perspective of Christian humanism. This has not always been the case. Abel Lefranc, in his 1922 introduction to \"Pantagruel\", depicted Rabelais as a militant anti-Christian atheist. M. A. Screech, like Lucien Febvre before him, describes Rabelais as an Erasmian.\n\nRabelais was Roman Catholic. Timothy Hampton writes that \"to a degree unequaled by the case of any other writer from the European Renaissance, the reception of Rabelais's work has involved dispute, critical disagreement, and ... scholarly wrangling ...\" But at present, \"whatever controversy still surrounds Rabelais studies can be found above all in the application of feminist theories to Rabelais criticism\".\n\nCiting Jean de La Bruyère, the Catholic Encyclopedia of 1911 wrote of Rabelais as: \n... a revolutionary who attacked all the past, Scholasticism, the monks; his religion is scarcely more than that of a spiritually-minded pagan. Less bold in political matters, he cared little for liberty; his ideal was a tyrant who loves peace. [...] His vocabulary is rich and picturesque, but licentious and filthy. In short, as La Bruyère says: \"His book is a riddle which may be considered inexplicable. Where it is bad, it is beyond the worst; it has the charm of the rabble; where it is good it is excellent and exquisite; it may be the daintiest of dishes.\" As a whole it exercises a baneful influence.\n\nIn his novel \"Tristram Shandy\", Laurence Sterne quotes extensively from Rabelais.\n\nAlfred Jarry performed, from memory, hymns of Rabelais at Symbolist Rachilde's Tuesday salons. Jarry worked for years on an unfinished libretto for an opera by Claude Terrasse based on Pantagruel.\n\nAnatole France lectured on him in Argentina. John Cowper Powys, D. B. Wyndham-Lewis, and Lucien Febvre (one of the founders of the French historical school \"Annales\"), all wrote books about him. \n\nMikhail Bakhtin, a Russian philosopher and critic, derived his concepts of the carnivalesque and grotesque body from the world of Rabelais. He points to the historical loss of communal spirit after the Medieval period and speaks of carnival laughter as an \"expression of social consciousness\".\n\nGeorge Orwell was not an admirer of Rabelais. Writing in 1940, he called him \"an exceptionally perverse, morbid writer, a case for psychoanalysis\".\n\nMilan Kundera, in a 2007 article in \"The New Yorker\", commented on a list of the most notable works of French literature, noting with surprise and indignation that Rabelais was placed behind Charles de Gaulle's war memoirs, and was denied the \"aura of a founding figure! Yet in the eyes of nearly every great novelist of our time he is, along with Cervantes, the founder of an entire art, the art of the novel\".\n\nRabelais is treated as a pivotal figure in Kenzaburō Ōe's acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1994.\n\n\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

In Orphic tradition, they are born from Chronos and Ananke. Hesiod's first (after Chaos) are Gaia, Tartarus, Eros, Erebus and Nyx. The primordial deities Gaia and Uranus give birth to the Titans, the Cyclopses and from the castration of Uranus, Aphrodite. The Titans Cronus and Rhea give birth to Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Hestia, Hera and Demeter who overthrow the Titans. The warring of the gods ends with the reign of Zeus.\n\nHesiod's \"Theogony\" (c. 700 BC) tells the story of the genesis of the gods. After invoking the Muses (II.1-116), he tells of the generation of the first four primordial deities: \"First Chaos came to be, but next... Earth... and dim Tartarus in the depth of the... Earth, and Eros...\" According to Hesiod, the next primordial gods that come to be are:\n\n\n\nThe ancient Greeks entertained different versions of the origin of primordial deities. Some of these stories were possibly inherited from the pre-Greek Aegean cultures.\n\nThe \"Iliad\", an epic poem attributed to Homer about the Trojan War (an oral tradition of 700 or 600 BC), states that Oceanus (and possibly Tethys, too) is the parent of all the deities.\n\n\nPhilosophers of Classical Greece also constructed their own metaphysical cosmogonies, with their own primordial deities:\n\n\nScholars dispute the meaning of the primordial deities in the poems of Homer and Hesiod. Since the primordials give birth to the Titans, and the Titans give birth to the Olympians, one way of interpreting the primordial gods is as the deepest and most fundamental nature of the cosmos.\n\nFor example, Jenny Strauss Clay argues that Homer's poetic vision centers on the reign of Zeus, but that Hesiod's vision of the primordials put Zeus and the Olympians in context. Likewise, Vernant argues that the Olympic pantheon is a \"system of classification, a particular way of ordering and conceptualizing the universe by distinguishing within it various types of powers and forces.\" But even before the Olympic pantheon were the Titans and primordial gods. Homer alludes to a more tumultuous past before Zeus was the undisputed King and Father.\n\nMitchell Miller argues that the first four primordial deities arise in a highly significant relationship. He argues that Chaos represents \"differentiation\", since Chaos differentiates (separates, divides) Tartarus and Earth. Even though Chaos is \"first of all\" for Hesiod, Miller argues that Tartarus represents the primacy of the \"undifferentiated,\" or the unlimited. Since undifferentiation is unthinkable, Chaos is the \"first of all\" in that he is the first \"thinkable\" being. In this way, Chaos (the principle of division) is the natural opposite of Eros (the principle of unification). Earth (light, day, waking, life) is the natural opposite of Tartarus (darkness, night, sleep, death). These four are the parents of all the other Titans.\n\n\n"}

Specifically, they point to the publication in 1957 of a book entitled \"Seventh-day Adventists Answer Questions on Doctrine\"; which they feel undermines historic Adventist theology in favor of theology more compatible with evangelicalism.\nHistoric Adventism has been erroneously applied by some to any Adventists that adhere to the teachings of the church as reflected in the church's fundamental beliefs such as the Sabbath or the Spirit of Prophecy. They misapply those who hold to mainstream traditional Adventist beliefs as synonymous with Historic Adventist.\n\nHistoric Adventists have tended to promote their message through independent ministries, some of which have had a strained relationship with the official church.\" Last Generation Theology\" shares some elements with Historic Adventism, yet considers itself to have \"expanded\" the beliefs of Adventism to their logical conclusion. Historic Adventists are seen as at the opposite end of the Adventist theological spectrum from Progressive Adventists. Prominent figures supporting some of the historic views include M. L. Andreasen, and Colin and Russell Standish.\n\nTeachings on Christian perfection and personal holiness were present in the religious revival of the Great Awakening in America and were evident in early Adventist movements such as the \"Holy Flesh movement\" in Indiana around the turn of the 19th century which Ellen White quickly rebuked.\" They were also evident in some teachings on holiness by medical doctor John Harvey Kellogg, and Jones and Waggoner of 1888 fame.\n\nJoseph Bates was one of the three primary founders of Seventh-day Adventism (along with James and Ellen White). Like many in the early church he focused more on following the requirements of God's law over salvation by grace.\n\nFollowing the 1919 Bible Conference, in which Ellen White's inspiration was discussed during two days, some defended against what they felt were attacks on her such as Holmes and Washburn, who wrote open letters decrying the alleged \"new theology\" and the \"omega\" apostasy of the Adventist church.\n\nKeith Lockhart has described the \"Golden Age\" of Adventism (from a sociological point of view) as the fundamentalist era of the 1920s–1950s. It is to this time period the expression \"historic Adventism\" most accurately applies, not to 19th century Adventism. Along with Malcolm Bull, he says \"Adventist fundamentalism\" emerged in the 1880s, became dominant in the 1920s, and survives to the present day among conservative groups.\" They also claim \"elements of fundamentalism were re-invoked,\" becoming discernible in the 1990s.\n\nIt is widely accepted that present historic Adventism emerged in response to the Adventist-Evangelical discussions that occurred in the spring of 1955 to the fall of 1957. These dialogues were initiated by evangelicals Donald Barnhouse and Walter Martin, who sought clarification on what Adventists believed and took issue with a number of teachings, which at the time were generally thought to characterize Adventist theology. The most significant of these being: semi-arian views on the GodHead; man's sinful nature taken by Christ in His incarnation; an incomplete atonement at the time of Christ's death on the cross; salvation by obedience to the law; and extreme sectarianism. At least one author considers the various streams existed earlier, as some Millerites came from churches holding Arian views, but this event polarized them.\n\nThe Adventist leaders who met with Walter Martin presented a fuller description of mainstream Adventist theology, and described the more fundamentalist views as merely the beliefs of a few. (Le Roy Edwin Froom described them as the \"lunatic fringe.\") In addition to showing it had clearly moved from semi-arian views on the GodHead, the Adventists asserted that the belief that Christ took Adam's sinful nature after the fall and an incomplete atonement were not part of mainstream Adventist doctrine. Adventist historian George Knight felt it was not a complete picture as it could be, because a majority of Adventists prior to 1950 had held to these teachings concerning the nature of Christ and the atonement.\n\nMartin and Barnhouse were satisfied with the responses given by the Adventist delegation, and concluded that the Adventist church was a legitimate Christian body. Meanwhile, Adventist theologian M. L. Andreasen, who was aware of these proceedings, openly opposed what he felt was a change concerning the nature of Christ and the atonement and represented the many Adventists who held that view. (Those Adventists who believed Christ had taken a fallen nature still believed that Jesus was sinless and committed no actual sins, but they held that it included propensity or desire to sin). Some of these Adventists continue to oppose the theological direction taken by the church leadership on these issues and the more fundamentalist elements are known today as \"Historic Adventists.\"\n\nHerbert Douglass has stated,\n\nAccording to historian George Knight,\n\nDesmond Ford convinced Robert Brinsmead his views on perfectionism were incorrect in about 1970. Robert Brinsmead himself however denies that Ford convinced him to abandon perfectionism and further states that he abandoned perfectionism as a result of his intensive study of the issues of the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther, and justification by faith. During the 1970s, what is now the \"Adventist Review\" carried articles by editor Kenneth Wood and associate editor Herbert Douglass rejecting \"Questions on Doctrine\" and arguing for a final perfect generation.\n\nThe General Conference addressed this controversy over \"righteousness by faith\" by holding a conference in Palmdale, California in 1976. Ford was the \"center of attention,\" and the resulting document known as the \"Palmdale Statement\". However the controversy continued and critics of the \"new theology\" of Ford and others formed institutions to respond them.\n\nJulius Nam has written,\n\nThe 1975 book \"Perfection: The Impossible Possibility\" (Nashville: Southern Publishing Association, 1975) edited by Douglass, contained essays by Douglass and C. Mervyn Maxwell supporting traditional Adventist views, and Edward Heppenstall and Hans LaRondelle supporting their view.\n\nHistoric Adventist theology tends to differ from mainstream Adventist theology in the areas of Christology, hamartiology (sin), soteriology (salvation) and eschatology (end times). They often use the term \"new theology\" as a pejorative term for perceived doctrinal shifts in the church.\n\nWith regards to Christology, according to Adventist historian George Knight, most early Adventists believed that Jesus Christ was born with a human nature that was not only physically frail and subject to temptation, but that he also had the fallen predisposition and inclination to sin. Since 1950, the \"historic\" wing of the church continues to hold this \"fallen\" view of Christ's human nature, though it is now a minority position among theologians and mainstream Adventism.\n\nHistoric Adventists, like mainstream Adventists, believe that sin is defined in terms of personal transgressions of the commandments, over against an inborn corruption of the human nature inherited from Adam.\n\nHistoric Adventists tend to place more emphasis on sanctification than justification. Following Andreasen, they define the atonement in terms of God's work to cleanse our character from sin as well as payment of the penalty for sin. The work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary is regarded as a continuation of the work of atonement begun on the cross, rather than the application of the benefits of an already completed atonement.\n\"Eschatological perfectionism\" is the teaching that a final generation of believers must achieve a state of perfection or complete sinlessness in the final period just before the second coming of Jesus (see Last Generation Theology) and most Historic Adventists hold to that teaching. This belief in sinlessness arose particularly from M. L. Andreasen's interpretation of the investigative judgment doctrine, which is one of the pillars of Adventism and found in \"The Great Controversy\" by Ellen G. White.\n\nHistoric Adventists generally place more emphasis on the writings of Ellen G. White as a doctrinal authority compared to mainstream Adventists, some considering her writings as infallible and having near-equivalent status to the Bible.\n\nHistoric Adventists have a differing perspective on the 1888 Minneapolis General Conference arguing that Ellen White in addition to have supported Jones and Waggoner, but also perfectionistic theology, which some say came from them.\n\nSome historic Adventists, like many mainstream Adventists, are advocates of the King James Only movement, which promotes sole use of the King James Version of the Bible. (A classic book in this movement, \"Our Authorized Bible Vindicated\" (1930), was written by an Adventist, Benjamin G. Wilkinson. One critique is by Alden Thompson.)\n\nLast Generation Theology (LGT) or \"final generation\" theology is a belief system held by some conservative members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which claims that perfection like the 144,000 will be achieved by some people in the last generation before the Second Coming of Jesus. It is closely related to \"historic Adventism,\" but as one supporter claims, it differs in that it forms an extension or development of traditional Adventist beliefs, or takes them to their logical conclusion.\n\nMainstream and progressive Adventists have criticised the use of the term \"historic.\" It is observed that numerous doctrinal positions that were common among the Adventist pioneers are generally not held by those who profess to be \"historic Adventists,\" such as semi-Arianism, what time of day the Sabbath should begin, certain understandings of Systematic Benevolence, the \"shut door,\" and the personhood of the Holy Spirit. It is argued that the over-valuing of \"historic\" beliefs leads to an unhelpful neglect of \"new light\" and \"present truth,\" which Adventists have always held as defining beliefs.\n\nWalter Martin labeled most of the historic Adventists he encountered as \"legalists,\" \"worshippers of Ellen White\" and the \"lunatic fringe.\" The term was earlier used by LeRoy Edwin Froom when Adventist leaders met with Martin.\n\nAdventist historian Milton Hook describes it as \"Adventist fundamentalism.\" He cites the aggressive preaching style of George Burnside who attacked Roman Catholics and \"apostate\" Protestants. Hook says this turned many away, and some of the remaining merely \"loved a religious dogfight,\" and converts \"often generated dust storms of intolerance and became clones of militant dogmatism among their peers.\" He states this style of evangelism was once the norm among Adventist preachers, and had roots in 19th century Methodism in the United States.\n\nAndy Nash wrote that while working at the \"Adventist Review,\" he was \"often perplexed about how our ability to function at the magazine was disrupted by some folk on the conservative extreme.\" In response to articles on worship, they would get many critical letters that were based more on tradition than on the Bible. They would airbrush jewelry out of photos to placate some readers.\n\nHistoric Adventists look favorably on a past era of the church. Phil Dunham, a fairly conservative author himself, critiqued \"nostalgia about the good old days of 'historic Adventism.' In some people's minds it seems to be a time of the most unblemished and unassailable doctrinal positions, the highest possible moral standards, the deepest spiritual maturity, the best snowlike purity, the utmost in readiness to be translated.[…] But the way we often use the expression 'historic Seventh-day Adventism' is built on an idealized and unrealistic notion of what our early church was really like.\"\n\nIn response, some historic Adventists have claimed that they are loving in their evangelism and deny that the charge of fanaticism applies to them. They quote statements by Ellen White to support their view. For instance:\n\nMethodist scholar Donald Dayton expressed some sympathies for historic Adventists in his paper presented at the \"Questions on Doctrine\" 50th anniversary conference.\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church has officially reacted to two organizations that some say have \"historic Adventist\" theology, Hope International, and the Hartland Institute (USA) and Remnant Ministries (Australia). In 1998, the General Conference established a committee to evaluate the beliefs and activities and the committee produced a report expressing \"serious concerns with respect to the nature and purpose of Hope International and associates.\"\nThe conclusion of the report stated that \"by rejecting the authority of the world church in session when their interpretation of Scripture and the Spirit of Prophecy differs from that of the church, Hope International and associates have set their authority above that of the world church and operate in a manner that is consistent with offshoot movements.\" The report also contained a significant escalation: \"If Hope International and associates cannot bring themselves into harmony with the body of the world church, clearly evidenced within 12 months, the Seventh-day Adventist Church may need to consider whether there exists a \"persistent refusal to recognize properly constituted church authority or to submit to the order and discipline of the church\" (Church Manual, p. 169).\" \n\nAccording to one article, the policy of the Adventist church in North America is that members of Hartland or Hope International may not hold any church office.\n\nIn addition to Hope International (Seventh-day Adventist), and the Hartland Institute, there are a number of para-church organizations that assist in the articulation and defense of the Historic Adventists' views. Hope International, formerly led by Ron Spear, runs a publishing ministry and a health center. Hartland Institute comprises an educational college and health center associated with Colin Standish (who founded the organization ). It publishes their books and others, as well as \"Last Generation\" magazine.\n\nRemnant Ministries was founded by Russell Standish and is based in Australia.\n\nThe term \"Concerned Brethren\" describes an Adventist movement in Australasia (not to be confused with the Brethren churches, a Christian movement entirely separate from Adventism). The description was used of a group of retired ministers opposed to Desmond Ford's teachings, particularly during his time as head of theology at Avondale College, and who urged for his dismissal. The name derived from their signature or self-designation on a letter in the 1970s, although the stream of thought had been discernible earlier. According to E. Bruce Price, \"'Concerned Brethren' was abbreviated to 'CB' as a term of derision for those opposing Dr. Ford's new theology.\" According to the Standishes, \"Hope International is to the United States what the Gazeley meetings are to Britain, and the Concerned Brethren are to Australia and New Zealand.\"\n\nThe group was led by James William Kent (1890 – May 5, 1983, Australia, aged 93), a \"veteran Australian evangelist and administrator,\" who chaired a meeting of \"concerned\" individuals in Sydney in 1974. On 3–4 February 1976, a group of 16 men (11 \"senior ministers,\" all retired, and five laymen) including Kent and George Burnside (1908–1994), a New Zealand evangelist (described as the \"foremost anti-Ford pamphleteer\") was given a hearing by 20 men from the Biblical Research Institute in the Australasian Division (now the South Pacific Division). According to one author, Ford's understanding of righteousness by faith was the main issue, while the report describes \"concern about the teaching of theology at Avondale College, particularly in the area of the Sanctuary, the Age of the Earth, and Inspiration.\" In response, the Institute affirmed its support for Avondale in its report.\n\nIn March 1977, Kent and others met with Ford and church administrators. They were informed this would be the last time they could meet with church leaders as a group. Kent and Burnside were banned from preaching in the churches on December 18, 1978, because of their continued opposition to Ford. A. C. Needham replaced Kent as unofficial leader around this time, as the latter approached his 90th birthday.\n\nAccording to Arthur Patrick, \"Looking back on the painful saga of the 'Concerned Brethren' from 1974 to the present, it is apparent that a better application of essentials for effective pastoral care may have alleviated some of the controversy.\" Also, \"Following the conflicts that gained intensity in the 1950s, during the 1970s the Adventist Church in Australasia made significant progress in better understanding and presenting 'the everlasting gospel;' but it failed to win the support of certain older members. In addition, viewpoints similar to those of the Concerned Brethren were promulgated by a variety of independent groups.\" He has described them as \"loyalists.\"\n\nThe Adventist Laymen's Fellowship (ALF) was founded in 1979 to counter the growing Desmond Ford movement in Australia. They held a series of weekend meetings at Vision Valley, outside Sydney, to which local and overseas conservative Adventist speakers were invited and to which several thousand Adventists attended over several years. Early speakers included Colin Standish, Ralph Larson, George Burnside, Austin Cooke, Mervyn Maxwell, Leroy Moore, Dennis Priebe and others. They also published a magazine for several years named \"Landmarks.\" The ALF succumbed to theological unorthodoxy and disbanded about 1986.\n\nHistoric Adventists have a strong commitment to publishing, and often disseminate free literature to promote their views to the mainstream church and wider public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffline resources:\n\nSupportive:\n\nNeutral or critical:\n"}

He took over England's first Pentecostal Bible School. In 1913 an organization called the Crown Mission began in the city, and shortly afterwards Carter became the leader of this group. By 1916 he became involved in a second Pentecostal work, and had to quit his regular work to maintain leadership of the two churches.\n\nIn World War I, Carter was imprisoned in Wormwood Scrubs as a conscientious objector, and then spent time in Princetown Work Centre in the former Dartmoor Prison. While in prison he claimed to have received the revelation of the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit. These teachings, based on the text of 1 Corinthians 12:8-10, are still used today as the primary teaching on the gifts of the Spirit within all major Pentecostal Christian belief systems.\n\nFrom 4 September 1918 to 11 June 1919 he was a 'brother' on the staff of Wallingford Farm Training Colony, an institution run by the National Union for Christian Social Service for 'difficult' boys mainly referred by Boards of Guardians.\n\nIn 1921, Carter was handed over leadership of Hampstead Bible School, originally to be on a temporary basis until a more suitable person was available to fill the opening. That never happened, as he held this position for some 27 years. Under Carter's leadership the school grew so much that they had to purchase a nearby house, and two more Bible schools were opened up.\n\nHe took his work so seriously at the school that he did not receive any of the money donated to the school for his own use unless it was marked specifically for him, and he paid his own room and board to the school out of his salary.\n\nHoward Carter later became a founding member of Assemblies of God in Great Britain and Ireland. He served on the General Council of these groups as vice-chairman 1929-1934, and as chairman 1934-1945.\n\nHoward Carter left the Hampstead Bible School in 1948 and moved to the United States where he eventually married Ruth (Fisher) Steelberg. She was the daughter of Elmer Kirk Fisher, who was the founder of the Upper Room Mission in Los Angeles, California. She had previously been married to Wesley Rowland Steelberg, who was general superintendent of the Assemblies of God U.S.A. Steelberg had died while on a trip to Wales in 1952. Carter spent the rest of his life in the U.S., and began to travel extensively as a preacher until his death in Springfield, Missouri, in 1971. His final days lasted 23 years.\n\nHoward Carter and Lester Sumrall first met in Eureka Springs, Arkansas when Carter was in his forties and Sumrall was in his early twenties. They formed an immediate relationship and traveled the world together as missionaries preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Sumrall wrote about Carter in his books \"Adventuring with Christ\" and \"Pioneers of Faith\". Sumrall also expounded on Carter's teachings of the nine gifts of the Spirit in his book \"The Gifts and Ministries of the Holy Spirit\".\n\nThe Gifts of the Holy Spirit (possibly published by Springfield MO: Gospel Publishing House [AG USA], c1920s)\nNew York Tokyo Moscow - c 1934\nSpiritual gifts and their operation (Springfield, MO: Gospel Publishing House, 1968)\n\n"}
{"id": "37521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37521", "title": "Hoysala architecture", "text": "Hoysala architecture\n\nHoysala architecture is the building style developed under the rule of the Hoysala Empire between the 11th and 14th centuries, in the region known today as Karnataka, a state of India. Hoysala influence was at its peak in the 13th century, when it dominated the Southern Deccan Plateau region. Large and small temples built during this era remain as examples of the Hoysala architectural style, including the Chennakesava Temple at Belur, the Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu, and the Kesava Temple at Somanathapura. Other examples of Hoysala craftsmanship are the temples at Belavadi, Amruthapura, Hosaholalu, Mosale, Arasikere, Basaralu, Kikkeri and Nuggehalli. Study of the Hoysala architectural style has revealed a negligible Indo-Aryan influence while the impact of Southern Indian style is more distinct.\n\nTemples built prior to Hoysala independence in the mid-12th century reflect significant Western Chalukya influences, while later temples retain some features salient to Western Chalukya architecture but have additional inventive decoration and ornamentation, features unique to Hoysala artisans. Some three hundred temples are known to survive in present-day Karnataka state and many more are mentioned in inscriptions, though only about seventy have been documented. The greatest concentration of these are in the Malnad (hill) districts, the native home of the Hoysala kings.\nHoysala architecture is classified by the influential scholar Adam Hardy as part of the \"Karnata Dravida\" tradition, a trend within Dravidian architecture in the Deccan that is distinct from the Tamil style of further south. Other terms for the tradition are Vesara, and Chalukya architecture, divided into early Badami Chalukya architecture and the Western Chalukya architecture which immediately preceded the Hoysalas. The whole tradition covers a period of about seven centuries began in the 7th century under the patronage of the Chalukya dynasty of Badami, developed further under the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta during the 9th and 10th centuries and the Western Chalukyas (or Later Chalukyas) of Basavakalyan in the 11th and 12th centuries. Its final development stage and transformation into an independent style was during the rule of the Hoysalas in the 12th and 13th centuries. Medieval inscriptions displayed prominently at temple locations give information about donations made toward the maintenance of the temple, details of consecration and on occasion, even architectural details.\n\nHinduism is a combination of secular and sacred beliefs, rituals, daily practices and traditions that has evolved over the course of over two thousand years and embodies complex symbolism combining the natural world with philosophy.\nHindu temples began as simple shrines housing a deity and by the time of the Hoysalas had evolved into well articulated edifices in which worshippers sought transcendence of the daily world. Hoysala temples were not limited to any specific organised tradition of Hinduism and encouraged pilgrims of different Hindu devotional movements. The Hoysalas usually dedicated their temples to Shiva or to Vishnu (two of the popular Hindu gods), but they occasionally built some temples dedicated to the Jain faith as well. Worshippers of Shiva are called Shaivas and worshippers of Vishnu are called Vaishnavas. While King Vishnuvardhana and his descendants were Vaishnava by faith, records show that the Hoysalas maintained religious harmony by building as many temples dedicated to Shiva as they did to Vishnu. \n\nMost of these temples have secular features with broad themes depicted in their sculptures. This can be seen in the famous Chennakesava Temple at Belur dedicated to Vishnu and in the Hoysaleswara temple at Halebidu dedicated to Shiva. The Kesava temple at Somanathapura is different in that its ornamentation is strictly Vaishnavan. Generally Vaishnava temples are dedicated to Keshava (or to Chennakeshava, meaning \"Beautiful Vishnu\") while a small number are dedicated to Lakshminarayana and Lakshminarasimha (Narayana and Narasimha both being Avatars, or physical manifestations, of Vishnu) with Lakshmi, consort of Vishnu, seated at his feet. Temples dedicated to Vishnu are always named after the deity.\n\nThe Shaiva temples have a Shiva linga, symbol of fertility and the universal symbol of Shiva, in the shrine. The names of Shiva temples can end with the suffix \"eshwara\" meaning \"Lord of\". The name \"Hoysaleswara\", for instance, means \"Lord of Hoysala\". The temple can also be named after the devotee who commissioned the construction of the temple, an example being the Bucesvara temple at Koravangala, named after the devotee Buci. The most striking sculptural decorations are the horizontal rows of mouldings with detailed relief, and intricately carved images of gods, goddesses and their attendants on the outer temple wall panels.\n\nThe Doddagaddavalli Lakshmi Devi (\"Goddess of Wealth\") Temple is an exception as it is dedicated to neither Vishnu nor Shiva. The defeat of the Jain Western Ganga Dynasty (of present-day south Karnataka) by the Cholas in the early 11th century and the rising numbers of followers of Vaishnava Hinduism and Virashaivism in the 12th century was mirrored by a decreased interest in Jainism. However, two notable locations of Jain worship in the Hoysala territory were Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli. The Hoysalas built Jain temples to satisfy the needs of its Jain population, a few of which have survived in Halebidu containing icons of Jain tirthankaras. They constructed stepped wells called \"Pushkarni\" or \"Kalyani\", the ornate tank at Hulikere being an example. The tank has twelve minor shrines containing Hindu deities.\n\nThe two main deities found in Hoysala temple sculpture are Shiva and Vishnu in their various forms and avatars (incarnations). Shiva is usually shown with four arms holding a trident and a small drum among other emblems that symbolise objects worshiped independently of the divine image with which they are associated. Any male icon portrayed in this way is Shiva although a female icon may sometimes be portrayed with these attributes as Shiva's consort, Parvati. Various depictions of Lord Shiva exist: showing him naked (fully or partially), in action such as slaying a demon (Andhaka) or dancing on the head of a slain elephant (Gajasura) and holding its skin up behind his back. He is often accompanied by his consort Parvati or shown with Nandi the bull. He may be represented as Bhairava, another of Shiva's many manifestations.\n\nA male figure depicted holding certain objects such as a conch (symbol of eternal, heavenly space) and a wheel (eternal time and destructive power) is Vishnu. If a female figure is depicted holding these objects, she is seen as his consort, Lakshmi. In all the depictions Vishnu is holding four objects: a conch, a wheel, a lotus and a Kaumodaki (mace). These can be held in any of the icon's hands, making possible twenty-four different forms of Vishnu, each with a unique name. Apart from these, Vishnu is depicted in any of his \"ten avataras\", which include Vishnu sitting on Anantha (the celestial snake and keeper of life energy also known as Shesha), Vishnu with Lakshmi seated on his lap (Lakshminarayana), with the head of a lion disembowelling a demon on his lap (Lakshminarasimha), with head of a boar walking over a demon (Varaha), in the Krishna avatar (as Venugopala or the cow herder playing the Venu (flute), dancing on the head of the snake Kaliya, lifting a hill such as Govardhana), with his feet over head of a small figure (\"Vamana\"), along with Indra riding an elephant, with Lakshmi seated on Garuda, and the eagle (stealing the parijata tree).\n\nThe focus of a temple is the centre or sanctum sanctorum (garbhagriha) where the image of the deity resides, so temple architecture is designed to move the devotee from outside to the garbhagriha through ambulatory passageways for circumambulation and halls or chambers (\"mantapas\") that become increasingly sacred as the deity is approached.\nHoysala temples have distinct parts that are merged to form a unified organic whole, in contrast to the temples of Tamil country where different parts of a temple stand independently. Although superficially unique, Hoysala temples resemble each other structurally. They are characterised by a complex profusion of sculpture decorating all the temple parts chiselled of soft soapstone (chloritic schist), a good material for intricate carving, executed mostly by local craftsmen, and exhibit architectural features that distinguish them from other temple architectures of South India.\n\nMost Hoysala temples have a plain covered entrance porch supported by lathe turned (circular or bell-shaped) pillars which were sometimes further carved with deep fluting and moulded with decorative motifs. The temples may be built upon a platform raised by about a metre called a \"jagati\". The \"jagati\", apart from giving a raised look to the temple, serves as a \"pradakshinapatha\" or \"circumambulation path\" for circumambulation around the temple, as the \"garbagriha\" (inner sanctum) provides no such feature. Such temples will have an additional set of steps leading to an open \"mantapa\" (open hall) with parapet walls. A good example of this style is the Kesava Temple at Somanathapura. The \"jagati\" which is in unity with the rest of the temple follows a star-shaped design and the walls of the temple follow a zig-zag pattern, a Hoysala innovation.\n\nDevotees can first complete a ritual circumambulation on the \"jagati\" starting from the main entrance by walking in a clockwise direction (towards the left) before entering the \"mantapa\", following the sculptural clockwise-sequenced reliefs on the outer temple walls depicting a sequence of epic scenes from the Hindu epics. Temples that are not built on a \"jagati\" can have steps flanked by elephant balustrades (parapets) that lead to the \"mantapa\" from ground level. An example of a temple that does not exhibit the raised platform is the \"Bucesvara\" temple in Korvangla, Hassan District. In temples with two shrines (\"dvikuta\"), the \"vimanas\" (the shrines or cellae) may be placed either next to each other or on opposite sides. The Lakshmidevi temple at Doddagaddavalli is unique to Hoysala architecture as it has four shrines around a common centre and a fifth shrine within the same complex for the deity Bhairava (a form of Shiva). In addition, four minor shrines exist at each corner of the courtyard (\"prakaram\").\n\nThe \"mantapa\" is the hall where groups of people gather during prayers. The entrance to the \"mantapa\" normally has a highly ornate overhead lintel called a \"makaratorana\" (\"makara\" is an imaginary beast and \"torana\" is an overhead decoration). The open \"mantapa\" which serves the purpose of an outer hall (outer \"mantapa\") is a regular feature in larger Hoysala temples leading to an inner small closed \"mantapa\" and the shrine(s). The open \"mantapas\" which are often spacious have seating areas (\"asana\") made of stone with the \"mantapa's\" parapet wall acting as a back rest. The seats may follow the same staggered square shape of the parapet wall. The ceiling here is supported by numerous pillars that create many bays. The shape of the open \"mantapa\" is best described as staggered-square and is the style used in most Hoysala temples. Even the smallest open \"mantapa\" has 13 bays. The walls have parapets that have half pillars supporting the outer ends of the roof which allow plenty of light making all the sculptural details visible. The \"mantapa\" ceiling is generally ornate with sculptures, both mythological and floral. The ceiling consists of deep and domical surfaces and contains sculptural depictions of banana bud motifs and other such decorations.\n\nIf the temple is small it will consist of only a closed \"mantapa\" (enclosed with walls extending all the way to the ceiling) and the shrine. The closed \"mantapa\", well decorated inside and out, is larger than the vestibule connecting the shrine and the \"mantapa\" and has four lathe-turned pillars to support the ceiling, which may be deeply domed. The four pillars divide the hall into nine bays. The nine bays result in nine decorated ceilings. Pierced stone screens (\"Jali\" or Latticework) that serve as windows in the \"navaranga\" (hall) and \"Sabhamantapa\" (congregation hall) is a characteristic Hoysala stylistic element.\n\nA porch adorns the entrance to a closed \"mantapa\", consisting of an awning supported by two half-pillars (engaged columns) and two parapets, all richly decorated. The closed \"mantapa\" is connected to the shrine(s) by a vestibule, a square area that also connects the shrines. Its outer walls are decorated, but as the size the vestibule is not large, this may not be a conspicuous part of the temple. The vestibule also has a short tower called the \"sukanasi\" or \"nose\" upon which is mounted the Hoysala emblem. In Belur and Halebidu, these sculptures are quite large and are placed at all doorways.\n\nThe outer and inner \"mantapa\" (open and closed) have circular lathe-turned pillars having four brackets at the top. Over each bracket stands sculptured figure(s) called \"salabhanjika\" or \"madanika\". The pillars may also exhibit ornamental carvings on the surface and no two pillars are alike. This is how Hoysala art differs from the work of their early overlords, the Western Chalukyas, who added sculptural details to the circular pillar base and left the top plain. The lathe-turned pillars are 16, 32, or 64-pointed; some are bell-shaped and have properties that reflect light. The Parsvanatha Basadi at Halebidu is a good example. According to Brown, the pillars with four monolithic brackets above them carry images of \"salabhanjikas\" and \"madanikas\" (sculpture of a woman, displaying stylised feminine features). This is a common feature of Chalukya-Hoysala temples. According to Sastri, the shape of the pillar and its capital, the base of which is square and whose shaft is a monolith that is lathe turned to render different shapes, is a \"remarkable feature\" of Hoysala art.\n\nThe \"vimana\", also called the cella, contains the most sacred shrine wherein resides the image of the presiding deity. The \"vimana\" is often topped by a tower which is quite different on the outside than on the inside. Inside, the vimana is plain and square, whereas outside it is profusely decorated and can be either stellate (\"star-shaped\") or shaped as a staggered square, or feature a combination of these designs, giving it many projections and recesses that seem to multiply as the light falls on it. Each projection and recess has a complete decorative articulation that is rhythmic and repetitive and composed of blocks and mouldings, obscuring the tower profile. Depending on the number of shrines (and hence on the number of towers), the temples are classified as \"ekakuta\" (one), \"dvikuta\" (two), \"trikuta\" (three), \"chatushkuta\" (four) and \"panchakuta\" (five). Most Hoysala temples are \"ekakuta\", \"dvikuta\" or \"trikuta\", the Vaishnava ones mostly being \"trikuta\". There are cases where a temple is \"trikuta\" but has only one tower over the main shrine (in the middle). So the terminology \"trikuta\" may not be literally accurate. In temples with multiple disconnected shrines, such as the twin temples at Mosale, all essential parts are duplicated for symmetry and balance.\n\nThe highest point of the temple (\"kalasa\") has the shape of a water pot and stands on top of the tower. This portion of the \"vimana\" is often lost due to age and has been replaced with a metallic pinnacle. Below the \"kalasa\" is a large, highly- sculptured structure resembling a dome which is made from large stones and looks like a helmet. It may be 2 m by 2 m in size and follows the shape of the shrine. Below this structure are domed roofs in a square plan, all of them much smaller and crowned with small \"kalasas\". They are mixed with other small roofs of different shapes and are ornately decorated. The tower of the shrine usually has three or four tiers of rows of decorative roofs while the tower on top of the \"sukanasi\" has one less tier, making the tower look like an extension of the main tower (Foekema calls it the \"nose\"). One decorated roof tier runs on top of the wall of a closed \"mantapa\" above the heavy eaves of an open \"mantapa\" and above the porches.\n\nBelow the superstructure of the \"vimana\" are temple \"eaves\" projecting half a meter from the wall. Below the eaves two different decorative schemes may be found, depending on whether a temple was built in the early or the later period of the empire. In the early temples built prior to the 13th century, there is one eave and below this are decorative miniature towers. A panel of Hindu deities and their attendants are below these towers, followed by a set of five different mouldings forming the base of the wall. In the later temples there is a second eave running about a metre below the upper eaves with decorative miniature towers placed between them. The wall images of gods are below the lower eaves, followed by six different mouldings of equal size. This is broadly termed \"horizontal treatment\". The six mouldings at the base are divided in two sections. Going from the very base of the wall, the first horizontal layer contains a procession of elephants, above which are horsemen and then a band of foliage. The second horizontal section has depictions of the Hindu epics and \"Puranic\" scenes executed with detail. Above this are two friezes of \"yalli\"s or \"makara\"s (imaginary beasts) and \"hamsas\" (swans). The \"vimana\" (tower) is divided into three horizontal sections and is even more ornate than the walls.\n\nIn Hoysala art Hardy identifies two conspicuous departures from the more austere Western (Later) Chalukya art:ornamental elaboration and a profusion of iconography with figure sculptures, both of which are found in abundance even on the superstructure over the shrine. Their medium, the soft chlorite schist (Soapstone) enabled a virtuoso carving style. Hoysala artists are noted for their attention to sculptural detail be it in the depiction of themes from the Hindu epics and deities or in their use of motifs such as \"yalli\", \"kirtimukha\" (gargoyles), aedicula (miniature decorative towers) on pilaster, \"makara\" (aquatic monster), birds (\"hamsa\"), spiral foliage, animals such as lions, elephants and horses, and even general aspects of daily life such as hair styles in vogue.\n\n\"Salabhanjika\", a common form of Hoysala sculpture, is an old Indian tradition going back to Buddhist sculpture. \"Sala\" is the sala tree and \"bhanjika\" is the chaste maiden. In the Hoysala idiom, \"madanika\" figures are decorative objects put at an angle on the outer walls of the temple near the roof so that worshipers circumambulating the temple can view them.\n\nThe \"sthamba buttalikas\" are pillar images that show traces of Chola art in the Chalukyan touches. Some of the artists working for the Hoysalas may have been from Chola country, a result of the expansion of the empire into Tamil-speaking regions of Southern India. The image of \"mohini\" on one of the pillars in the \"mantapa\" (closed hall) of the Chennakeshava temple is an example of Chola art.\n\nGeneral life themes are portrayed on wall panels such as the way horses were reined, the type of stirrup used, the depiction of dancers, musicians, instrumentalists, and rows of animals such as lions and elephants (where no two animals are identical). Perhaps no other temple in the country depicts the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics more effectively than the Hoysaleshwara temple at Halebidu.\n\nErotica was a subject the Hoysala artist handled with discretion. There is no exhibitionism in this, and erotic themes were carved into recesses and niches, generally miniature in form, making them inconspicuous. These erotic representations are associated with the \"Shakta\" practice.\n\nApart from these sculptures, entire sequences from the Hindu epics (commonly the Ramayana and the Mahabharata) have been sculpted in a clockwise direction starting at the main entrance. The right to left sequence is the same direction taken by the devotees in their ritual circumambulation as they wind inward toward the inner sanctum. Depictions from mythology such as the epic hero Arjuna shooting fish, the elephant-headed god Ganesha, the Sun god Surya, the weather and war god Indra, and Brahma with Sarasvati are common. Also frequently seen in these temples is Durga, with several arms holding weapons given to her by other gods, in the act of killing a buffalo (a demon in a buffalo's form) and Harihara (a fusion of Shiva and Vishnu) holding a conch, wheel and trident. Many of these friezes were signed by the artisans, the first known instance of signed artwork in India.\n\nAccording to Settar, surveys in modern times have indicated that 1000–1500 structures were built by the Hoysalas, of which about a hundred temples have survived to date. The Hoysala style is an offshoot of the Western Chalukya style, which was popular in the 10th and 11th centuries. It is distinctively Dravidian, and according to Brown, owing to its features, Hoysala architecture qualifies as an independent style. While the Hoysalas introduced innovative features into their architecture, they also borrowed features from earlier builders of \"Karnata\" like the Kadambas, Western Chalukyas. These features included the use of chloritic schist or soapstone as a basic building material. \n\nOther features were the stepped style of \"vimana\" tower called the \"Kadamba shikhara\", which was inherited from the Kadambas. Hoysala sculptors made use of the effect of light and shade on carved walls, which poses a challenge for photography of the temples. The artistry of the Hoysalas in stone has been compared to the finesse of an ivory worker or a goldsmith. The abundance of jewellery worn by the sculpted figures and the variety of hairstyles and headdresses depicted give a fair idea of the lifestyles of the Hoysala times.\n\nWhile medieval Indian artisans preferred to remain anonymous, Hoysala artisans signed their works, which has given researchers details about their lives, families, guilds, etc. Apart from the architects and sculptors, people of other guilds such as goldsmiths, ivory carvers, carpenters, and silversmiths also contributed to the completion of temples. The artisans were from diverse geographical backgrounds and included famous locals. Prolific architects included Amarashilpi Jakanachari, a native of Kaidala in Tumkur district, who also built temples for the Western Chalukyas. Ruvari Malithamma built the Kesava Temple at Somanathapura and worked on forty other monuments, including the Amruteshwara temple at Amruthapura. Malithamma specialised in ornamentation, and his works span six decades. His sculptures were typically signed in shorthand as \"Malli\" or simply \"Ma\". \n\nDasoja and his son Chavana from Balligavi were the architects of Chennakesava Temple at Belur; Kedaroja was the chief architect of the Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu. Their influence is seen in other temples built by the Hoysalas as well. Names of other locals found in inscriptions are Maridamma, Baicoja, Caudaya, Nanjaya and Bama, Malloja, Nadoja, Siddoja, Masanithamma, Chameya and Rameya. Artists from Tamil country included Pallavachari and Cholavachari.\n\n\n\n"}

Incubation was practised by many ancient cultures. In perhaps the most well known instance among the Hebrews, found in 1 Kings 3, Solomon went to Gibeon \"because that was the most renowned high place to offer sacrifices.\" There \"the appeared to Solomon in a dream at night,\" and Solomon asked God for the gift of an understanding heart. Among the members of the cult of Asclepius, votive offerings found at ritual centres at Epidaurus, Pergamum, and Rome detail the perceived effectiveness of the method. Incubation was adopted by certain Christian sects and is still used in a few Greek monasteries. Modern practices for influencing dream content by dream incubation use more research-driven techniques, but they sometimes incorporate elements reflecting these ancient beliefs.\n\n"}
{"id": "5040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5040", "title": "Inedia", "text": "Inedia\n\nInedia (Latin for \"fasting\") or breatharianism is the belief that it is possible for a person to live without consuming food. Breatharians claim that food, and in some cases water, are not necessary for survival, and that humans can be sustained solely by \"prana\", the vital life force in Hinduism. According to Ayurveda, sunlight is one of the main sources of \"prana\", and some practitioners believe that it is possible for a person to survive on sunlight alone. The terms \"breatharianism\" or \"inedia\" may also refer to this philosophy when it is practiced as a lifestyle in place of the usual diet.\n\nBreatharianism is considered a deadly pseudoscience by scientists and medical professionals, and several adherents of these practices have died from starvation and dehydration. Though it is common knowledge that biological entities require sustenance to survive, breatharianism continues.\n\nNutritional science proves that fasting for extended periods leads to starvation, dehydration, and eventual death. In the absence of food intake, the body normally burns its own reserves of glycogen, body fat, and muscle. Breatharians claim that their bodies do not consume these reserves while fasting.\n\nSome breatharians have submitted themselves to medical testing, including a hospital's observation of Indian mystic Prahlad Jani appearing to survive without food or water for 15 days, and an Israeli breatharian appearing to survive for eight days on a television documentary. In a handful of documented cases, individuals attempting breatharian fasting have died. Among the claims in support of Inedia investigated by the Indian Rationalist Association, all were found to be fraudulent. In other cases, people have attempted to survive on sunlight alone, only to abandon the effort after losing a large percentage of their body weight.\n\nThe 1670 Rosicrucian text \"Comte de Gabalis\" attributed the practice to the physician and occultist Paracelsus (1493–1541) who was described as having lived \"several years by taking only one half scrupule of Solar Quintessence\". In this book, it is also stated that, \"Paracelsus affirms that He has seen many of the Sages fast twenty years without eating anything whatsoever.\"\n\nRam Bahadur Bomjon is a young Nepalese Buddhist monk who lives as an ascetic in a remote area of Nepal. Bomjon appears to go for periods of time without ingesting either food or water. One such period was chronicled in a 2006 Discovery Channel documentary titled \"The Boy With Divine Powers\", which reported that Bomjon neither moved, ate, nor drank anything during 96 hours of filming.\n\nPrahlad Jani is an Indian sadhu who says he has lived without food and water for more than 70 years. His claims were investigated by doctors at Sterling Hospital, Ahmedabad, Gujarat in 2003 and 2010. The study concluded that Prahlad Jani was able to survive under observation for two weeks without either food or water, and had passed no urine or stool, with no need for dialysis. Interviews with the researchers speak of strict observation and relate that round-the-clock observation was ensured by multiple CCTV cameras. Jani was subjected to multiple medical tests, and his only contact with any form of fluid was during bathing and gargling, with the fluid spat out measured by the doctors. The research team could not comment on his claim of having been able to survive in this way for decades.\n\nThe case has attracted criticism, both after the 2003 tests and the 2010 tests. Sanal Edamaruku, president of the Indian Rationalist Association, criticized the 2010 experiment for allowing Jani to move out of a certain CCTV camera's field of view, meet devotees and leave the sealed test room to sunbathe. Edamaruku stated that the regular gargling and bathing activities were not sufficiently monitored, and accused Jani of having had some \"influential protectors\" who denied Edamaruku permission to inspect the project during its operation.\n\nJasmuheen (born Ellen Greve) was a prominent advocate of breatharianism in the 1990s. She said \"I can go for months and months without having anything at all other than a cup of tea. My body runs on a different kind of nourishment.\" Interviewers found her house stocked with food; Jasmuheen claimed the food was for her husband and daughter. In 1999, she volunteered to be monitored closely by the Australian television program \"60 Minutes\" for one week without eating to demonstrate her methods. Jasmuheen stated that she found it difficult on the third day of the test because the hotel room in which she was confined was located near a busy road, causing stress and pollution that prevented absorption of required nutrients from the air. \"I asked for fresh air. Seventy percent of my nutrients come from fresh air. I couldn’t even breathe,\" she said. The third day the test was moved to a mountainside retreat where her condition continued to deteriorate. After Jasmuheen had fasted for four days, Berris Wink, president of the Queensland branch of the Australian Medical Association, urged her to stop the test.\n\nAccording to Wink, Jasmuheen’s pupils were dilated, her speech was slow, and she was \"quite dehydrated, probably over 10%, getting up to 11%\". Towards the end of the test, she said, \"Her pulse is about double what it was when she started. The risks if she goes any further are kidney failure. \"60 Minutes\" would be culpable if they encouraged her to continue. She should stop now.\" The test was stopped. Wink said, \"Unfortunately there are a few people who may believe what she says, and I'm sure it's only a few, but I think it's quite irresponsible for somebody to be trying to encourage others to do something that is so detrimental to their health.\" Jasmuheen challenged the results of the program, saying, \"Look, 6,000 people have done this around the world without any problem.\"\n\nJasmuheen was awarded the Bent Spoon Award by Australian Skeptics in 2000 (\"presented to the perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of paranormal or pseudoscientific piffle\"). She also won the 2000 Ig Nobel Prize for Literature for \"Living on Light\". Jasmuheen claims that their beliefs are based on the writings and \"more recent channelled material\" from St. Germain. She stated that some people's DNA has expanded from 2 to 12 strands, to \"absorb more hydrogen\". When offered $30,000 to prove her claim with a blood test, she said that she didn't understand the relevance as she was not referring to herself.\n\nIn the documentary \"No Way to Heaven\" the Swiss chemist Michael Werner claims to have followed the directions appearing on Jasmuheen's books, living for several years without food. The documentary also describes two attempts at scientific verification of his claims. , five deaths had been directly linked to breatharianism as a result of Jasmuheen's publications. Jasmuheen has denied any responsibility for the deaths.\n\nWiley Brooks is the founder of the Breatharian Institute of America. He was first introduced to the public in 1980 when he appeared on the TV show \"That's Incredible!\". Brooks stopped teaching recently to \"devote 100% of his time on solving the problem as to why he needed to eat some type of food to keep his physical body alive and allow his light body to manifest completely.\" Brooks claims to have found \"four major deterrents\" which prevented him from living without food: \"people pollution\", \"food pollution\", \"air pollution\" and \"electro pollution\".\n\nIn 1983 he was reportedly observed leaving a Santa Cruz 7-Eleven with a Slurpee, a hot dog, and Twinkies. He told \"Colors\" magazine in 2003 that he periodically breaks his fasting with a cheeseburger and a cola, explaining that when he's surrounded by junk culture and junk food, consuming them adds balance.\n\nWiley Brooks later claimed that Diet Coke and McDonald's cheeseburgers have special \"5D\" properties. The idea of separate but interconnected 5D and 3D worlds is a major part of Wiley Brooks' ideology, and Wiley Brooks encourages his followers to only eat these special 5D foods, as well as meditate on a set of magical 5D words.\n\nBrooks's institute has charged varying fees to prospective clients who wished to learn how to live without food, which have ranged from US$100,000 with an initial deposit of $10,000 to one billion dollars, to be paid via bank wire transfer with a preliminary deposit of $100,000, for a session called \"Immortality workshop\". A payment plan was also offered. These charges have typically been presented as limited time offers exclusively for billionaires.\n\nHira Ratan Manek (born 12 September 1937) claims that since 18 June 1995 he has lived on water and occasionally tea, coffee, and buttermilk. Manek states that Sungazing is the key to his health citing yogis, ancient Egyptians, Aztecs, Mayans and Native Americans as practitioners of the art. While he and his proponents state that medical experts have confirmed his ability to draw sustenance by gazing at the sun, he was caught on camera eating a big meal in a San Francisco restaurant in the 2011 documentary \"Eat the Sun\".\n\nIn a television documentary produced by the Israeli television investigative show \"The Real Face\" (פנים אמיתיות) hosted by Amnon Levy, Israeli practitioner of Inedia Ray Maor (ריי מאור) who appeared to survive without food or water for eight days and eight nights. According to the documentary, he was restricted to a small villa and placed under constant video surveillance, with medical supervision that included daily blood testing. The documentary claimed Maor was in good spirits throughout the experiment, lost 17 lb after eight days, blood tests showed no change before, during or after the experiment, and Cardiologist Ilan Kitsis from Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center was \"baffled.\"\n\n\nHindu religious texts contain account of saints and hermits practicing what would be called inedia, breatharianism or Sustenance through Light in modern terms. In Valmiki's Ramayana, Book III, Canto VI, an account of anchorites and holy men is given, who flocked around Rama when he came to Śarabhanga's hermitage. These included, among others, the \"...saints who live on rays which moon and daystar give\" and \"those ... whose food the wave of air supplies\". In Canto XI of the same book a hermit named Māṇḍakarṇi is mentioned: \"For he, great votarist, intent – On strictest rule his stern life spent – ... – Ten thousand years on air he fed...\" (English quotations are from Ralph T. H. Griffith's translation).\n\nParamahansa Yogananda's \"Autobiography of a Yogi\" details two alleged historical examples of breatharianism, Hari Giri Bala and Therese Neumann.\n\nThere are claims that Devraha Baba lived without food.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3653113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3653113", "title": "Inugami", "text": "Inugami\n\n, like kitsunetsuki, is a spiritual possession by the spirit of a dog, widely known about in western Japan. Until recent years, they were often seen in the eastern Ōita Prefecture, Shimane Prefecture, and a part of Kōchi Prefecture in northern Shikoku, and it is also theorized that Shikoku, where no foxes (kitsune) could be found, is the main base of the inugami. Furthermore, traces of belief in inugami exists in the Yamaguchi Prefecture, all of Kyushu, even going past the Satsunan Islands all the way to the Okinawa Prefecture. In the Miyazaki Prefecture, the Kuma District, Kumamoto Prefecture, and Yakushima, the local dialect pronounces it \"ingami\" and in Tanegashima, they are called \"irigami.\" It can also be written in kanji as 狗神.\n\nThe phenomenon of inugami spiritual possession was a kojutsu (also called \"kodō\" or \"kodoku\", a greatly feared ritual for employing the spirits of certain animals) that was already banned in the Heian period that was thought to have spread throughout the population, and it was known to involve cutting off the head of a starving dog and burying the dog at a crossroads to inflame its grudges as people pass over its head so that its spirit would turn into a curse that could be used.\n\nAnother method was to bury the dog alive leaving only its head sticking out or attach the dog to a supporting pole, put some food in front of the dog, cut the dog's neck just when it is about to starve so that the head would fly towards and bite at the food, burn the dog into mere bones, put the remains into a vessel, and deify it. By doing so, it will spiritually possess that person forever, granting their wishes. Another method was to set several dogs to fight against each other, give the one dog remaining alive some fish, cut off that dog's head, and eat the remaining fish. In Yamaga, Hayami District, Ōita Prefecture (now Kitsuki), there were actual cases where a miko did cut off a dogs' heads this way, dried the maggots that gathered at the heads, and sold them calling it inugami, and there were also people who were thankful for these and bought them.\nHowever, in descriptions of an inugami's appearance, it is said that they have a somewhat large patch of color around the size of a mouse, and they have split ends on their tail, and as they were a species of talpidae, their eyes cannot be seen, and moved in single file one after another. Thus, they would seem to be more like kuda-gitsune or osaki rather than dogs, so it does not appear as if they were purely following the legends of kodō curses (such as the \"dog curse\" found in the In Search of the Supernatural). In fact, it would seem more as if the main focus of these descriptions were imitations of the belief in fox spirits. They also seem similar in appearance to house mouse, and their mouths are said be torn vertically with a pointy end, and in the Ōita Prefecture, they are said to resemble a dsinezumi shrew, and in Toyooka town, Hayami District, Ōita, they are said to be a weasel with black and white spots. On the island of Aishima in the aforementioned Yamaguchi Prefecture, they are called \"inugami nezumi\" (inugami mice), and like the long-nosed house mouse, they are said to form groups of 75 mice in a single house. On the mountain of Iyayama, Miyoshi District, Tokushima Prefecture, the inugami type are called \"suikazura,\" and they are said to be a bit larger than mice and warm themselves by the fireside. In a book titled \"Chiriyahokori\" by the kokugaku Oka Kumaomi, it is stated that they have a body length of 1 shaku and 1 sun and looked like bats. Also, in Asai Ryōi's \"Otogi Bōko\", the inugami of Tosa Province was told to have a physical appearance with length similar to that of a rice grain and a body that was colored with patches of black and white, among other colors.\n\nThere are several theories about how inugami came to be, including the tale that the body of the nue slain by Minamoto no Yorimasa split into 4 parts and scattered and flew to different lands to become inugami, as well as the tale that it was born from Kōbō-Daishi's painting of a dog that was made for the sake of warding off boars. There is also the legend that when Gennō Shinshō attempted to calm the curse of a sessho-seki by splitting the stone, the fragments that flew off to Kōzuke Province (now Gunma Prefecture) turned into osaki and the fragments that flew to Shikoku became inugami.\n\nInugami are explained to be raised in the storage room chests (tansu), under the floors, and in the water jugs of the families that have inugami. Like other types of spirit possession, inugami become more easily attached to people who are wildly unstable in emotions. Those who get possessed by it (those who get an inugami attached to them) are said to feel pain in their chest, complain about pain in their arms and feet, suddenly sway without warning, and bark like a dog. They would enter and invade the human body from the ears, and it's said that those who get possessed by these would develop a personality full of jealousy. In Tokushima Prefecture, it is said that those that get possessed by an inugami would become voracious big eaters and would have teeth marks on their body when they die. Not limited to just humans, inugami would also possess cows and horses and even inorganic materials, and when they possess a saw, it would become useless.\n\nThe idea there exist bloodlines of families that easily get possessed by an inugami as well as bloodlines of inugami themselves come from the regional tales told by the bloodlines of the sorcerers, yamabushi, priests, and fuko that engaged in kodoku. In many cases, it shows how those nomadic peoples who engaged in folk sorcery would earn trust and respect and at the same time be treated with discrimination. This is because inugami follows people into their descendants, and it was normal for everyday villagers to consider it taboo to marry into an inugami bloodline, and even associating with them was normally seen with apprehension. In various parts of Shikoku, there is a custom during marriage to check the bloodlines for inugami, and there were none too few cases when it was a problem related to \"assimilation issues\" (dōwa mondai).\n\nIn the legends of Komatsu, Shūsō District, Ehime Prefecture (now part of Saijō), there were as many inugami as there were people in families that had inugami, and the number of inugami increased each time the family grew larger. It is said that these inugami would pick up cues and understand what the family is thinking and the inugami would immediately go possess them when the family wanted something. However, it is said that sometimes they didn't behave in an obedient manner and would bite to death members of the family that have inugami.\n\nIt is said that those afflicted with illnesses that come from inugami were unable to be cured by doctors and needed to have the inugami removed by a sorcerer. In Tanegashima, there is a practice called \"inugami-tsure\" (meaning \"taking along an inugami\") that was performed when a family that had inugami was known or even just suspected without confirmation to have transferred an inugami to another family whereby the family that originally had inugami would bring food into the other family's house to take the inugami along with them and then go to live in seclusion in a hut in the outskirts of town until the newly afflicted person was cured, and it is said that their descendants would continue even after that to live alone in the mountains.\n\nFamilies that had inugami were thought to have prospered and grew wealthy. At the same time, there were also cases where they were not treated like fox spirits that brought fortune into families by being deified, but rather detested as curse gods.\n\n\n\n"}

When Lehi takes his family into the wilderness, Lehi brings Ishmael and his family too. The daughters of Ishmael marry the sons of Lehi, but the sons of Ishmael join Laman and Lemuel in their rebellion against Nephi. Ishmael dies in the wilderness, and is buried at Nahom. (\"See Archaeology and the Book of Mormon\") After their arrival in the Americas, the children of Ishmael side with the Lamanites, except for those daughters who married Sam, Nephi, and Zoram.\n\nA second Ishmael is the grandfather of Amulek.\n\nIshmael comes from the . It is a theophoric name translated literally as \"God (El) has hearkened\", suggesting that \"a child so named was regarded as the fulfillment of a divine promise\".\n\nAccording to Hugh Nibley, the proverbial ancestor of the Arabs is Ishmael. His name is one of the few Old Testament names which is also at home in ancient Arabia: \"[Thus] in Lehi's friend \"Ishmael\" (1 Nephi 7:2) we surely have a man of the desert. The interesting thing is that Nephi takes Ishmael (unlike Zoram) completely for granted, never explaining who he is or how he fits into the picture--the act of sending for him seems to be the most natural thing in the world, as does the marriage of his daughters with Lehi's sons. Since it has ever been the custom among the desert people for a man to marry the daughter of his paternal uncle (bint 'ammi), it is hard to avoid the impression that Lehi and Ishmael were related. There is a remarkable association between the names of Lehi and Ishmael which ties them both to the southern desert, where the legendary birthplace and central shrine of Ishmael was at a place called Be'er Lehai-ro'i.\" \n\nAccording to John L. Sorenson, both Ishmael's sons had \"families\" (1 Nephi 7:6) who accompanied them. The term \"families\" implies a wife and at least one child each, but there likely were more children.\n\nIn \"\", adapted from First and Second Nephi, Ishmael was portrayed by Ron Frederickson.

The draft of the law specifically mentions Islam and four other religious communities.\n\nMosques in Georgia operate under the supervision of the Georgian Muslim Department, established in May 2011. Until then the affairs of Georgia's Muslims had been governed from abroad by the Baku-based Caucasus Muslims Department.\n\nIn 2010, Turkey and Georgia signed an agreement by which Turkey will provide funding and expertise to rehabilitate three mosques and to rebuild a fourth one in \nGeorgia. While Georgia will rehabilitate four Georgian monasteries in Turkey. The Georgia-Turkey agreement will allow the reconstruction of the historical Azize mosque in Batumi, Ajaria demolished in the middle of the last century. Turkey will rehabilitate the mosques at Samtskhe-Javakheti and Akhaltsikhe regions, Kobuleti District, build the Azize mosque burned down in 1940 and restore the Turkish bathhouse in Batumi.\n\nThe Arabs first appeared in Georgia in 645. It was not, however, until 735, when they succeeded in establishing their firm control over a large portion of the country. In that year, Marwan II took hold of Tbilisi and much of the neighbouring lands and installed there an Arab emir, who was to be confirmed by the Caliph of Baghdad or, occasionally, by the \"ostikan\" of \"Armīniya\".\n\nDuring the Arab period, Tbilisi (\"al-Tefelis\") grew into a center of trade between the Islamic world and northern Europe. Beyond that, it functioned as a key Arab outpost and a buffer province facing the Byzantine and Khazar dominions. Over time, Tbilisi became largely Muslim.\n\nBetween 1386 and 1404, Georgia was subjected to invasions by the armies of Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur, whose vast empire stretched, at its greatest extent, from Central Asia into Anatolia. In the first of at least seven invasions, Timur sacked Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, and captured the king Bagrat V in 1386. In late 1401, Timur invaded the Caucasus once again. The King of Georgia had to sue for peace, and sent his brother with the contributions. Timur was preparing for a major confrontation with the Ottoman dynasty and apparently wished to freeze the currently prevailing situation in Georgia, until he could return to deal with it more decisively and thoroughly at his leisure. Thus, he made peace with George on condition that the king of Georgia supply him with troops.\n\nThe Safavid dynasty was in constant conflict with the Ottomans over full control and influence in the Caucasus. From the early 16th to the course of the second half of the 18th century, the Safavids had to deal with several independent kingdoms and principalities, as Georgia was not a single state at the time. These entities often followed divergent political courses. Safavid interests were largely directed at Eastern (the kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti) and Southern (the kingdoms of Samtskhe-Saatabago) Georgia while Western Georgia came under Ottoman influence. These independent kingdoms became vassals of Persia as early as in 1503.\nOn May 29, 1555, the Safavids and the Ottoman Empire concluded a treaty at Amasya following the Ottoman–Safavid War (1532–55) by which the Caucasus was divided between the two. Western Georgia and the western part of southern Georgia fell to The Ottomans, while Eastern Georgia (comprising the kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti) and the (largest) eastern part of southern Georgia fell to Safavid Iran. The bulk of Georgia and the region which had historically always been the most dominant stayed therefore in the Iranian sphere. This partition of the Caucasus and therefore including Georgia under Islamic rule was again confirmed in 1639.\n\nIn 1703, Vakhtang VI became the ruler of the kingdom of Kartli. In 1716, he adopted Islam and the Safavid ruler confirmed him as King of Kartli. However, at a decisive moment Vakhtang was ordered to discontinue military campaigns, leading Vakhtang to adopt a pro-Russian orientation, though the Russian failed to tender him the promised military aid.\n\nFor several centuries, the Georgian kings and aristocrats converted to Islam and served as courtiers to the Iranian Safavid, Afsharid and Qajar dynasties, who ruled them.\n\nThe Muslims constitute from 9.9% (463,062) to 10-11% of Georgia's population.\n\nThere are two major Muslim groups in Georgia. The ethnic Georgian Muslims are Sunni Hanafi and are concentrated in the Autonomous Republic of Adjara of Georgia bordering Turkey. The ethnic Azerbaijani Muslims are predominantly Shia Ithna Ashariyah and are concentrated along the border with Azerbaijan and Armenia.\n\nThe Meskhetian Turks, also a Sunni Hanafi group, are the former inhabitants of the Meskheti region of Georgia, along the border with Turkey. They were deported to Central Asia during November 15–25, 1944 by Joseph Stalin and settled within Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. Of the 120,000 forcibly deported in cattle-trucks a total of 10,000 perished. Today they are dispersed over a number of other countries of the former Soviet Union. There are 500,000 to 700,000 Meskhetian Turks in exile in Azerbaijan and Central Asia.\n\nThere are also smaller numbers of Muslims in Georgia belonging to other ethnic groups of the South Caucasus, such as Ossetians, Armenians, and Pontic Greeks (divided between Caucasus Greeks and Turkish speaking Urums). These are mainly descended from Ottoman-era Christian Orthodox converts to Turkish Islam. Many of Georgia's Muslims defined as 'Ottoman' following Lala Mustafa Pasha's Caucasian campaign that led to the Ottoman conquest of Georgia in the 1570s were actually of Armenian or Pontic Greek origin whose ancestors in Eastern Anatolia had adopted Turkish Islam. One prominent example of an Ottoman Muslim from Georgia of Caucasus Greek origin was Resid Mehmed Pasha, who ironically played an important role in suppressing the 1822-33 Greek War of Independence (see also Greek Muslims and Armenian Muslims).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15616", "title": "Jello Biafra", "text": "Jello Biafra\n\nEric Reed Boucher (born June 17, 1958), better known by his professional name Jello Biafra, is the former lead singer and songwriter for the San Francisco punk rock band Dead Kennedys. He is a musician and spoken word artist.\n\nInitially active from 1979 to 1986, Dead Kennedys were known for rapid-fire music topped with Biafra's sardonic lyrics and biting social commentary, delivered in his \"unique quiver of a voice.\" When the band broke up in 1986, he took over the influential independent record label Alternative Tentacles, which he had founded in 1979 with Dead Kennedys bandmate East Bay Ray. In a 2000 lawsuit, upheld on appeal in 2003 by the California Supreme Court, Biafra was found liable for breach of contract, fraud and malice in withholding a decade's worth of royalties from his former bandmates and ordered to pay over $200,000 in compensation and punitive damages; the band subsequently reformed without Biafra. Although now focused primarily on spoken word performances, Biafra has continued as a musician in numerous collaborations.\n\nPolitically, Biafra is a member of the Green Party of the United States and supports various political causes. He ran for the party's Presidential nomination in the 2000 United States Presidential Election, finishing a distant second to Ralph Nader. He is a staunch believer in a free society, and utilizes shock value and advocates direct action and pranksterism in the name of political causes. Biafra is known to use absurdist media tactics, in the leftist tradition of the Yippies, to highlight issues of civil rights and social justice.\n\nEric Reed Boucher was born in Boulder, Colorado, the son of Virginia (née Parker), a librarian, and Stanley Wayne Boucher, a psychiatric social worker and poet. He had a sister, Julie J. Boucher, the Associate Director of the Library Research Service at the Colorado State Library (who died in a mountain-climbing accident on October 12, 1996). Biafra is 1/8th Jewish.\n\nAs a child, Boucher developed an interest in international politics that was encouraged by his parents. An avid news watcher, one of his earliest memories was of the John F. Kennedy assassination. Biafra says he has been a fan of rock music since first hearing it in 1965, when his parents accidentally tuned in to a rock radio station. Boucher ignored his high school guidance counselor's advice that he spend his adolescence preparing to become a dental hygienist.\n\nHe began his career in music in January 1977 as a roadie for the punk rock band The Ravers (who later changed their name to The Nails), soon joining his friend John Greenway in a band called The Healers. The Healers became infamous locally for their mainly improvised lyrics and avant garde music. In the autumn of that year, he began attending the University of California, Santa Cruz.\n\nIn June 1978, he responded to an advertisement placed in a store by guitarist East Bay Ray, stating; \"guitarist wants to form punk band,\" and together they formed the Dead Kennedys. He began performing with the band under the stage name Occupant, but soon began to use his current stage name, a combination of the brand name Jell-O and the short-lived African state Biafra. The band's lyrics were written by Biafra. The lyrics were mostly political in nature and displayed a sardonic, sometimes absurdist, sense of humor despite their serious subject matter. In the tradition of UK anarcho-punk bands like Crass, the Dead Kennedys were one of the first US punk bands to write politically themed songs. The lyrics Biafra wrote helped popularize the use of humorous lyrics in punk and other types of hard-core music. Biafra cites Joey Ramone as the inspiration for his use of humor in his songs (as well as being the musician who made him interested in punk rock), noting in particular songs by The Ramones such as \"Beat on the Brat\" and \"Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue\".\n\nBiafra initially attempted to compose music on guitar, but his lack of experience on the instrument and his own admission of being \"a fumbler with my hands\" led Dead Kennedys bassist Klaus Flouride to suggest that Biafra simply sing the parts he envisioned to the band.<ref name=\"re/search\">V. Vale, \"Incredibly Strange Music, Vol. 2\", RE/Search Publications, 1995</ref> Biafra sang his riffs and melodies into a tape recorder, which he brought to the band's rehearsal and/or recording sessions. This later became a problem when the other members of the Dead Kennedys sued Biafra over royalties and publishing rights. By all accounts, including his own, Biafra is not a conventionally skilled musician, though he and his collaborators (Joey Shithead of D.O.A. in particular) attest that he is a skilled composer and his work, particularly with the Dead Kennedys, is highly respected by punk-oriented critics and fans.\nBiafra's first popular song was the first single by the Dead Kennedys, \"California Über Alles.\" The song, which spoofed California governor Jerry Brown, was the first of many political songs by the group and Biafra. The song's popularity resulted in its being covered by other musicians, such as The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy (who rewrote the lyrics to parody Pete Wilson), John Linnell of They Might Be Giants and Six Feet Under on their \"Graveyard Classics\" album of cover versions. Not long after, the Dead Kennedys had a second and bigger hit with \"Holiday in Cambodia\" from their debut album \"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables\". \"AllMusic\" cites this song as \"possibly the most successful single of the American hardcore scene\" and Biafra counts it as his personal favorite Dead Kennedy's song. Minor hits from the album included \"Kill the Poor\" (about potential abuse of the then-new neutron bomb) and a satirical cover of Elvis Presley's \"Viva Las Vegas.\"\n\nThe Dead Kennedys received some controversy in the spring of 1981 over the single \"Too Drunk to Fuck.\" The song became a hit in Britain, and the BBC feared that it would manage to be a big enough hit to appear among the top 30 songs on the national charts, requiring a mention on \"Top of the Pops\". However, the single peaked at number 31 in the charts.\n\nLater albums also contained memorable songs, but with less popularity than the earlier ones. The EP \"In God We Trust, Inc.\" contained the song \"Nazi Punks Fuck Off!\" as well as \"We've Got A Bigger Problem Now,\" a rewritten version of \"California Über Alles\" about Ronald Reagan. Punk musician and scholar Vic Bondi considers the latter song to be the song that \"defined the lyrical agenda of much of hardcore music, and represented its break with punk\". The band's most controversial album, \"Frankenchrist\", brought with it the song \"MTV Get Off the Air,\" which accused MTV of promoting poor quality music and sedating the public. The album also contained a controversial poster by Swiss surrealist artist H. R. Giger entitled \"Penis Landscape\".\n\nThe Dead Kennedys toured widely during their career, starting in the late 1970s. They began playing at San Francisco's Mabuhay Gardens (their home base) and other Bay Area venues, later branching out to shows in southern Californian clubs (most notably the Whisky a Go Go), but eventually they moved to major clubs across the country, including CBGB in New York. Later, they played to larger audiences such as at the 1980 Bay Area Music Awards (where they played the notorious \"Pull My Strings\" for the only time), and headlined the 1983 Rock Against Reagan festival.\n\nOn May 7, 1994, punk rock fans who believed Biafra was a \"sell out\" attacked him at the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. Biafra claims that he was attacked by a man nicknamed Cretin, who crashed into him while moshing. The crash injured Biafra's leg, causing an argument between the two men. During the argument, Cretin pushed Biafra to the floor and five or six friends of Cretin assaulted Biafra while he was down, yelling \"Sellout rock star, kick him,\" and attempting to pull out his hair. Biafra was later hospitalized with serious injuries. The attack derailed Biafra's plans for both a Canadian spoken-word tour and an accompanying album, and the production of \"Pure Chewing Satisfaction\" was halted. However, Biafra returned to the Gilman club a few months after the incident to perform a spoken-word performance as an act of reconciliation with the club.\n\nBiafra has been a prominent figure of the Californian punk scene and was one of the third generation members of the San Francisco punk community. Many later hardcore bands have cited the Dead Kennedys as a major influence. Hardcore punk author Steven Blush describes Biafra as hardcore's \"biggest star\" who was a \"powerful presence whose political insurgence and rabid fandom made him the father figure of a burgeoning subculture [and an] inspirational force [who] could also be a real prick ... Biafra was a visionary, incendiary [performer].\"\n\nAfter the Dead Kennedys disbanded, Biafra's new songs were recorded with other bands, and he released only spoken word albums as solo projects. These collaborations had less popularity than Biafra's earlier work. However, his song \"That's Progress\", originally recorded with D.O.A. for the album \"Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors\", received considerable exposure when it appeared on the album \"Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1\".\n\nIn April 1986, police officers raided his house in response to complaints by the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC). In June 1986, L.A. deputy city attorney Michael Guarino, working under City Attorney James Hahn, brought Biafra to trial in Los Angeles for distributing \"harmful material to minors\" in the Dead Kennedys album \"Frankenchrist\". However, the dispute was about neither the music nor the lyrics from the album, but rather the print of the H. R. Giger poster \"Landscape XX\" (\"Penis Landscape\") included with the album. Biafra believes the trial was politically motivated; it was often reported that the PMRC took Biafra to court as a cost-effective way of sending a message out to other musicians with content considered offensive in their music.\n\nMusic author Reebee Garofalo argued that Biafra and Alternative Tentacles may have been targeted because the label was a \"small, self-managed and self-supported company that could ill afford a protracted legal battle.\" Facing the possible sentence of a year in jail and a $2,000 fine, Biafra, Dirk Dirksen, and Suzanne Stefanac founded the No More Censorship Defense Fund, a benefit featuring several punk rock bands, to help pay for his legal fees, which neither he nor his record label could afford. The jury deadlocked 5 to 7 in favor of acquittal, prompting a mistrial; despite a motion to re-try the case, the judge ordered all charges dropped. The Dead Kennedys disbanded during the trial, in December 1986, due to the mounting legal costs; in the wake of their disbandment, Biafra made a career of his spoken word performances.\n\nBiafra has a cameo role in the 1988 film \"Tapeheads\". He plays an FBI agent who arrests the two protagonists (played by Tim Robbins and John Cusack). While arresting them his character asks \"Remember what we did to Jello Biafra?\" lampooning the obscenity prosecution.\n\nOn March 25, 2005, Biafra appeared on the U.S. radio program \"This American Life\", \"Episode 285: Know Your Enemy\", which featured a phone call between Jello Biafra and Michael Guarino, the prosecutor in the \"Frankenchrist\" trial.\n\nIn October 1998, three former members of the Dead Kennedys sued Biafra for nonpayment of royalties. The other members of Dead Kennedys alleged that Biafra, in his capacity as the head of Alternative Tentacles records, discovered an accounting error amounting to some $75,000 in unpaid royalties over almost a decade. Rather than informing his bandmates of this mistake, the suit alleged, Biafra knowingly concealed the information until a whistleblower employee at the record label notified the band.\n\nAccording to Biafra, the suit resulted from his refusal to allow one of the band's most well-known singles, \"Holiday in Cambodia\", to be used in a commercial for Levi's Dockers; Biafra opposes Levi's because of his claim that they use unfair business practices and sweatshop labor. Biafra maintained that he had never denied them royalties, and that he himself had not even received royalties for re-releases of their albums or \"posthumous\" live albums which had been licensed to other labels by the Decay Music partnership. Decay Music denied this charge and have posted what they say are his cashed royalty checks, written to his legal name of Eric Boucher. Biafra also complained about the songwriting credits in new reissues and archival live albums of songs, alleging that he was the sole composer of songs that were wrongly credited to the entire band.\n\nIn May 2000, a jury found Biafra and Alternative Tentacles \"guilty of malice, oppression and fraud\" by not promptly informing his former bandmates of the accounting error and instead withholding the information during subsequent discussions and contractual negotiations. Biafra was ordered to pay $200,000, including $20,000 in punitive damages. After an appeal by Biafra's lawyers, in June 2003, the California Court of Appeal unanimously upheld all the conditions of the 2000 verdict against Biafra and Alternative Tentacles. Furthermore, the plaintiffs were awarded the rights to most of Dead Kennedys recorded works—which accounted for about half the sales for Alternative Tentacles. Now in control of the Dead Kennedys name, Biafra's former bandmates went on tour with a new lead vocalist.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Biafra collaborated with musicians Christian Lunch and Adrian Borland (of The Sound) for the electropunk musical project The Witch Trials, releasing one self-titled EP in its lifetime.\n\nIn 1988, Biafra, with Al Jourgensen and Paul Barker of the band Ministry, and Jeff Ward, formed Lard. The band became yet another side project for Ministry, with Biafra providing vocals and lyrics. According to a March 2009 interview with Jourgensen, he and Biafra are working on a new Lard album, which is being recorded in Jourgensen's El Paso studio. While working on the film \"Terminal City Ricochet\" in 1989, Biafra did a song for the film's soundtrack with D.O.A.. As a result, Biafra worked with D.O.A. on the album \"Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors\". Biafra also worked with Nomeansno on the soundtrack, which led to their collaboration on the album \"The Sky Is Falling and I Want My Mommy\" the following year. Biafra also provided lyrics for the song \"Biotech is Godzilla\" for Sepultura's 1993 album \"Chaos A.D.\".\n\nIn 1999, Biafra and other members of the anti-globalization movement protested the WTO Meeting of 1999 in Seattle. Along with other prominent West Coast musicians, he formed the short-lived band the No WTO Combo to help promote the movement's cause. The band was originally scheduled to play during the protest, but the performance was canceled due to riots. The band performed a short set the following night at the Showbox in downtown Seattle (outside the designated area), along with the hiphop group Spearhead. No WTO Combo later released a CD of recordings from the concert, entitled \"Live from the Battle in Seattle\".\n\nAs of late 2005, Biafra was performing with the band The Melvins under the name \"Jello Biafra and the Melvins\", though fans sometimes refer to them as \"The Jelvins.\" Together they have released two albums, and have been working on material for a third collaborative release, much of which was premiered live at two concerts at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco during an event called Biafra Five-O, commemorating Biafra's 50th birthday, the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Dead Kennedys, and the beginning of legalized same-sex marriage in California. Biafra is also working with a new band known as Jello Biafra and the Guantanamo School of Medicine, which includes Ralph Spight of Victims Family on guitar and Billy Gould of Faith No More on bass. This group debuted during Biafra Five-O.\n\nIn 2011, Biafra appeared in a singular concert event with an all-star cast of Southern musicians including members from Cowboy Mouth, Dash Rip Rock, Mojo Nixon and Down entitled, \"Jello Biafra and the New Orleans Raunch & Soul All Stars\" who performed an array of classic Soul covers to a packed house at the 12-Bar in New Orleans, Louisiana. He would later reunite with many of the same musicians during the Carnival season 2014 to revisit many of these classics at Siberia, New Orleans. A live album from the 2011 performance, \"Walk on Jindal's Splinters\", and a companion single, \"Fannie May\"/\"Just a Little Bit\", were released in 2015.\n\nIn June 1979, Biafra co-founded the record label Alternative Tentacles, with which the Dead Kennedys released their first single, \"California Über Alles\". The label was created to allow the band to release albums without having to deal with pressure from major labels to change their music, although the major labels were not willing to sign the band due to their songs being deemed too controversial. After dealing with Cherry Red in the UK and IRS Records in the US for their first album \"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables\", the band released all later albums, and later pressings of \"Fresh Fruit\" on Alternative Tentacles. The exception being live albums released after the band's break-up, which the other band members compiled from recordings in the band partnership's vaults without Biafra's input or endorsement.. Biafra has been the owner of the company since its founding, though he does not receive a salary for his position; Biafra has referred to his position in the company as \"absentee thoughtlord\".\n\nBiafra is an ardent collector of unusual vinyl records of all kinds, from 1950s and 1960s ethno-pop recordings by the likes of Les Baxter and Esquivel to vanity pressings that have circulated regionally, to German crooner Heino (for whom he would later participate in the documentary \"Heino: Made In Germany\"); he cites his always growing collection as one of his biggest musical influences. In 1993 he gave an interview to RE/Search Publications for their second \"Incredibly Strange Music\" book focusing primarily on these records, and later participated in a two-part episode of Fuse TV's program \"Crate Diggers\" on the same subject. His interest in such recordings, often categorized as outsider music, led to his discovery of the prolific (and schizophrenic) singer/songwriter/artist Wesley Willis, whom he signed to Alternative Tentacles in 1994, preceding Willis' major label deal with American Recordings. His collection grew so large that on October 1, 2005, Biafra donated a portion of his collection to an annual yard sale co-promoted by Alternative Tentacles and held at their warehouse in Emeryville, California.\n\nIn 2006, along with Alternative Tentacles employee and The Frisk lead singer Jesse Luscious, Biafra began co-hosting \"The Alternative Tentacles Batcast\", a downloadable podcast hosted by alternativetentacles.com. The show primarily focuses on interviews with artists and bands that are currently signed to the Alternative Tentacles label, although there are also occasional episodes where Biafra devoted the show to answering fan questions.\n\nBiafra became a spoken word artist in January 1986 with a performance at University of California, Los Angeles. In his performance he combined humor with his political beliefs, much in the same way that he did with the lyrics to his songs. Despite his continued spoken word performances, he did not begin recording spoken word albums until after the disbanding of the Dead Kennedys.\n\nHis ninth spoken word album, \"In the Grip of Official Treason\", was released in October 2006.\n\nBiafra was also featured in the British band Pitchshifter's song \"As Seen on TV\" reciting the words of dystopian futuristic radio advertisements.\n\nBiafra was an anarchist in the 1980s, but has shifted away from his former anti-government views. In a 2012 interview, Biafra said \"I'm very pro-tax as long as it goes for the right things. I don't mind paying more money as long as it's going to provide shelter for people sleeping in the street or getting the schools fixed back up, getting the infrastructure up to the standards of other countries, including a high speed rail system. I'm totally down with that.\"\n\nIn the autumn of 1979, Biafra ran for mayor of San Francisco, using the Jell-O ad campaign catchphrase, \"There's always room for Jello\", as his campaign slogan. Having entered the race before creating a campaign platform, Biafra later wrote his platform on a napkin while attending a Pere Ubu concert where Dead Kennedys drummer Ted told Biafra, \"Biafra, you have such a big mouth that you should run for Mayor.\" As he campaigned, Biafra wore campaign T-shirts from his opponent Quentin Kopp's previous campaign and at one point vacuumed leaves off the front lawn of another opponent, current U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, to mock her publicity stunt of sweeping streets in downtown San Francisco for a few hours. He also made a whistlestop campaign tour along the BART line. Supporters committed equally odd actions; two well known signs held by supporters said \"If he doesn't win I'll kill myself\" and \"What if he does win?\"\n\nIn San Francisco any individual could legally run for mayor if a petition was signed by 1500 people or if $1500 was paid. Biafra paid $900 and got signatures over time and eventually became a legal candidate, meaning he received statements put in voters' pamphlets and equal news coverage.\n\nHis platform included unconventional points such as forcing businessmen to wear clown suits within city limits, erecting statues of Dan White, who assassinated Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk in 1978, around the city and allowing the parks department to sell eggs and tomatoes with which people could pelt the statues, hiring workers who'd lost their jobs due to a tax initiative to panhandle in wealthy neighborhoods (including Dianne Feinstein's), and a citywide ban on cars. Biafra has expressed irritation that these parts of his platform attained such notoriety, preferring instead to be remembered for serious proposals such as legalizing squatting in vacant, tax-delinquent buildings and requiring police officers to run for election by the people of the neighborhoods they patrol.\n\nHe finished third out of a field of ten, receiving 3.79% of the vote (6,591 votes); the election ended in a runoff that did not involve him (Feinstein was declared the winner).\n\nIn 2000, the New York State Green Party drafted Biafra as a candidate for the Green Party presidential nomination, and a few supporters were elected to the party's nominating convention in Denver, Colorado. Biafra chose death row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal as his running mate. The party overwhelmingly chose Ralph Nader as the presidential candidate with 295 of the 319 delegate votes. Biafra received 10 votes.\n\nBiafra, along with a camera crew (dubbed by Biafra as \"The Camcorder Truth Jihad\"), later reported for the Independent Media Center at the Republican and Democratic conventions.\n\nAfter losing the 2000 nomination, Jello became highly active in Ralph Nader's presidential campaign, as well as in 2004 and 2008. During the 2008 campaign Jello played at rallies and answered questions for journalists in support of Ralph Nader. When gay rights activists accused Nader of costing Al Gore the 2000 election, Biafra reminded them that Tipper Gore's Parents Music Resource Center wanted warning stickers on albums with homosexual content.\n\nAfter Barack Obama won the general election, Jello wrote an open letter making suggestions on how to run his term as president. Biafra criticized Obama during his term, stating that \"Obama even won the award for best advertising campaign of 2008.\" Biafra dubbed Obama \"Barackstar O'Bummer\". Biafra refused to support Obama in 2012. Biafra has stated that he feels that Obama continued many of George W. Bush's policies, summarizing Obama's policies as containing \"worse and worse laws against human rights and more and more illegal unconstitutional spying.\"\n\nOn September 18, 2015, it was announced that Jello would be supporting Bernie Sanders in his campaign for the 2016 presidential election. He has strongly criticised the political position of Donald Trump, saying \"how can people be so fucking stupid\" on hearing the election result, and later adding \"The last person we want with their finger on the nuclear button is somebody connected to this extreme Christianist doomsday cult.\"\n\nIn the summer of 2011 Jello Biafra and his band were scheduled to play at the Barby Club in Tel Aviv. They came under heavy pressure by the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign, and finally decided to cancel the gig – after a debate which according to Biafra \"deeply tore at the fabric of our band [. . .] This whole controversy has been one of the most intense situations of my life – and I thrive on intense situations\".\nBiafra then decided to travel to Israel and the Palestinian Occupied Territories, at his own expense, and talk with Israeli and Palestinian activists as well as with fans disappointed at his cancellation. In the article stating his conclusions he wrote:\n\"I will not perform in Israel unless it is a pro-human rights, anti-occupation event, that does not violate the spirit of the boycott. Each musician, artist, etc. must decide this for themselves. I am staying away for now, but am also really creeped out by the attitudes of some of the hardliners and hope some day to find a way to contribute something positive here. I will not march or sign on with anyone who runs around calling people Zionazis and is more interested in making threats than making friends.\"\n\nBiafra married Theresa Soder, a.k.a. Ninotchka, lead singer of San Francisco-area punk band the Situations, on October 31, 1981. The wedding was conducted by Flipper vocalist/bassist Bruce Loose, who became a Universal Life Church minister just to conduct the ceremony, which took place in a graveyard. The wedding reception, which members of Flipper, Black Flag, and D.O.A. attended, was held at director Joe Rees' Target Video studios. The marriage ended in 1986.\n\nBiafra lives in San Francisco, California.\n\n\"For a more complete list, see the Jello Biafra discography.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Gill had a fascination with 9/11 conspiracy theories, the Iraq War, and the Columbine High School massacre.\n\nKimveer Gill was a 25-year-old Canadian born in Lachine, Quebec, Canada. His parents were of Punjabi descent, and moved to Saint-Laurent, Quebec from India in early 1981. The family later settled in the Fabreville area of Laval, Quebec in 1987. Kimveer attended Twin Oaks Elementary School in Laval from 1988 to 1993.\n\nGill later attended Rosemere High School, where he was remembered by teachers as quiet and unassuming. Despite early media reports, he performed well academically, and most students remember him as having friends and certainly never being bullied. He graduated from Rosemere High School in June 1998 before enrolling in Vanier College with his friends, Steven Kulczycki, Jason Rust, and Andrew Page. However, he dropped out in January 1999.\n\nGill briefly received military training from the Canadian Forces Leadership and Recruit School in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, from January 17 to February 16, 1999. He had told his friends he wished to eventually become a mercenary. He did not complete his basic training; for unknown reasons he was deemed unsuitable for military service and was voluntarily discharged before receiving weapons training.\n\nGill was a member of a rifle club and visited the Ville Saint-Pierre facility the day prior to the shooting.\n\nGill's funeral was held on September 19, 2006 in Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Quebec. There was strict security outside, and only invited guests were allowed to attend the ceremony. The ceremony was held the same day as the funeral for Anastasia De Sousa, the only other fatality of the shooting.\n\nIn extensive interviews with friends, family, teachers, and former colleagues, Gill was described as a quiet, nice, sensitive, generous person as well as \"the nicest, gentlest person\" with \"a heart of gold.\" His friends say that Gill had a fascination with 9/11 conspiracy theories, the war in Iraq, and the 1999 Columbine High School massacre. He liked Jack Daniel's whiskey and was a user of ecstasy. In the last few months of his life, he ceased contact with his friends and parents, and seemed more depressed than ever.\n\nOn September 13, 2006, Gill arrived at the Dawson College campus in Montreal, armed with a Beretta Cx4 Storm carbine. Before entering the cafeteria, he began shooting people outside the entrance and continued shooting once he had entered the school, killing 18-year-old Anastasia De Sousa and wounding nineteen other people and holding one student hostage before officer Denis Côté and other police officers shot him in the right arm. Gill then turned his gun on himself and committed suicide. Authorities concluded the attack was premeditated, after a short suicide note was found strapped inside Gill's trenchcoat.\n\nIn mid-January 2007, the Montreal police department released additional information showing that Gill had planned on committing similar attacks at other institutions across the city of Montreal. Among those were the Université de Montréal, and a secondary school in Laval. Some plans and maps were found in Gill's car near the site of the Dawson College event.\n\nA handwritten diary was found by police at Gill's home. A police source said, \"It was very obvious his state of mind was deteriorating greatly over the last three weeks.\" In a statement made on October 20, 2006, the head of the major crime squad for Montreal police, Richard Dupuis, stated: \"We know he was angry against the world, so it was a kind of vengeance... There is no explanation why Dawson. It could be Dawson, it could be another place\".\n\nAn online image gallery on Gill's Vampirefreaks.com blog, under his handle fatality666 contained more than 50 photos depicting him in various poses. In several images, Gill either points a Beretta Cx4 Storm semi-automatic carbine at the camera, or wears a long black trench coat and what he identifies as combat boots. Some of the photos showing Gill with weapons were taken by a friend, according to his mother. Among his many posted grievances, he stated that he hated school and work. The blog was removed sometime prior to September 14, 2006. However, it was accessed heavily in the interval after the killings and its contents were widely reported.\n\nNews articles\n\nGeneral\n"}

{"id": "112282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=112282", "title": "Max Stirner", "text": "Max Stirner\n\nJohann Kaspar Schmidt (25 October 1806 – 26 June 1856), better known as Max Stirner, was a German philosopher who is often seen as one of the forerunners of nihilism, existentialism, psychoanalytic theory, postmodernism and individualist anarchism. Stirner's main work is \"The Ego and Its Own\", also known as \"The Ego and His Own\" (\"Der Einzige und sein Eigentum\" in German, which translates literally as \"The Individual and His Property\"). This work was first published in 1845 in Leipzig and has since appeared in numerous editions and translations.\n\nStirner was born in Bayreuth, Bavaria. What little is known of his life is mostly due to the Scottish-born German writer John Henry Mackay, who wrote a biography of Stirner (\"Max Stirner – sein Leben und sein Werk\"), published in German in 1898 (enlarged 1910, 1914) and translated into English in 2005. Stirner was the only child of Albert Christian Heinrich Schmidt (1769–1807) and Sophia Elenora Reinlein (1778–1839). His father died of tuberculosis on 19 April 1807 at the age of 37. In 1809, his mother remarried to Heinrich Ballerstedt (a pharmacist) and settled in West Prussian Kulm (now Chełmno, Poland). When Stirner turned 20, he attended the University of Berlin, where he studied philology, philosophy and theology. He attended the lectures of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, who was to become a source of inspiration for his thinking. He attended Hegel's lectures on the history of philosophy, the philosophy of religion and the subjective spirit. Stirner then moved to the University of Erlangen, which he attended at the same time as Ludwig Feuerbach.\n\nStirner returned to Berlin and obtained a teaching certificate, but he was unable to obtain a full-time teaching post from the Prussian government. While in Berlin in 1841, Stirner participated in discussions with a group of young philosophers called \"Die Freien\" (\"The Free\") and whom historians have subsequently categorized as the Young Hegelians. Some of the best known names in 19th century literature and philosophy were involved with this group, including Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Bruno Bauer and Arnold Ruge. Contrary to popular belief, Feuerbach was not a member of \"Die Freien\", although he was heavily involved in Young Hegelian discourse. While some of the Young Hegelians were eager subscribers to Hegel's dialectical method and attempted to apply dialectical approaches to Hegel's conclusions, the left-wing members of the group broke with Hegel. Feuerbach and Bauer led this charge.\n\nFrequently the debates would take place at Hippel's, a wine bar in Friedrichstraße, attended by among others Marx and Engels, who were both adherents of Feuerbach at the time. Stirner met with Engels many times and Engels even recalled that they were \"great friends\", but it is still unclear whether Marx and Stirner ever met. It does not appear that Stirner contributed much to the discussions, but he was a faithful member of the club and an attentive listener. The most-often reproduced portrait of Stirner is a cartoon by Engels, drawn forty years later from memory at biographer Mackay's request. It is highly likely that this and the group sketch of \"Die Freien\" at Hippel's are the only firsthand images of Stirner. Stirner worked as a teacher in a school for young girls owned by Madame Gropius when he wrote his major work, \"The Ego and Its Own\", which in part is a polemic against Feuerbach and Bauer, but also against communists such as Wilhelm Weitling and the anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. He resigned from his teaching position in anticipation of controversy from this work's publication in October 1844.\n\nStirner married twice. His first wife was Agnes Burtz (1815–1838), the daughter of his landlady, who he married on 12 December 1837. However, she died from complications with pregnancy in 1838. In 1843, he married Marie Dähnhardt, an intellectual associated with \"Die Freien\". They divorced in 1846. \"The Ego and Its Own\" was dedicated \"to my sweetheart Marie Dähnhardt\". Marie later converted to Catholicism and died in 1902 in London.\n\nAfter \"The Ego and Its Own\", Stirner wrote \"Stirner's Critics\" and translated Adam Smith's \"The Wealth of Nations\" and Jean-Baptiste Say's \"Traite d'Economie Politique\" into German to little financial gain. He also wrote a compilation of texts titled \"History of Reaction\" in 1852. Stirner died in 1856 in Berlin from an infected insect bite and it is said that Bruno Bauer was the only Young Hegelian present at his funeral, held at the Friedhof II der Sophiengemeinde Berlin.\n\nThe philosophy of Stirner is credited as a major influence in the development of nihilism, existentialism and post-modernism as well as individualist anarchism, post-anarchism and post-left anarchy. Stirner's main philosophical work was \"The Ego and Its Own\", also known as \"The Ego and His Own\" (\"Der Einzige und sein Eigentum\" in German, which translates literally as \"The Unique One and His Property\").\n\nStirner argues that individuals are impossible to fully comprehend. All mere concepts of the self will always be inadequate to fully describe the nature of our experience. Stirner has been broadly understood as a proponent of both psychological egoism and ethical egoism, although the latter position can be disputed as there is no claim in Stirner's writing in which one ought to pursue one's own interest and further claiming any ought could be seen as a new fixed idea. However, he may be understood as a rational egoist in the sense that he considered it irrational not to act in one's self-interest. However, how this self-interest is defined is necessarily subjective, allowing both selfish and altruistic normative claims to be included. Individual self-realization rests on each individual's desire to fulfill their egoism. The difference between an unwilling and a willing egoist is that the former will be possessed by an empty idea and believe that they are fulfilling a higher cause, but usually being unaware that they are only fulfilling their own desires to be happy or secure; and the latter, in contrast, will be a person that is able to freely choose its actions, fully aware that they are only fulfilling individual desires: \n\nThe contrast is also expressed in terms of the difference between the voluntary egoist being the possessor of his concepts as opposed to being possessed. Only when one realizes that all sacred truths such as law, right, morality, religion and so on are nothing other than artificial concepts—and not to be obeyed—can one act freely. For Stirner, to be free is to be both one's own \"creature\" (in the sense of creation) and one's own \"creator\" (dislocating the traditional role assigned to the gods). To Stirner, power is the method of egoism—it is the only justified method of gaining property.\n\nStirner proposes that most commonly accepted social institutions—including the notion of state, property as a right, natural rights in general and the very notion of society—were mere illusions, \"spooks\" or ghosts in the mind. He advocated egoism and a form of amoralism in which individuals would unite in unions of egoists only when it was in their self-interest to do so. For him, property simply comes about through might: \"Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property\" and \"[w]hat I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing\". He says: \"I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property!\". Stirner considers the world and everything in it, including other persons, available to one's taking or use without moral constraint and that rights do not exist in regard to objects and people at all. He sees no rationality in taking the interests of others into account unless doing so furthers one's self-interest, which he believes is the only legitimate reason for acting. He denies society as being an actual entity, calling society a \"spook\" and that \"the individuals are its reality\" (\"The Ego and Its Own\").\n\nStirner's idea of the Union of egoists was first expounded in \"The Ego and Its Own\". The Union is understood as a non-systematic association, which Stirner proposed in contradistinction to the state. Unlike a \"community\", in which individuals are obliged to participate, Stirner's suggested Union would be voluntary and instrumental under which individuals would freely associate insofar as others within the Union remain useful to each constituent individual. The Union relation between egoists is continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will. The Union requires that all parties participate out of a conscious egoism. If one party silently finds themselves to be suffering, but puts up and keeps the appearance, the union has degenerated into something else. This union is not seen as an authority above a person's own will.\n\nStirner's hyperindividualism puts him outside mainstream anarchist philosophy, which emphasizes community and collective organization.\n\nStirner criticizes conventional notions of revolution, arguing that social movements aimed at overturning the state are tacitly statist because they are implicitly aimed at the establishment of a new state thereafter.\n\nScholar Lawrence Stepelevich argues that Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was a major influence on \"The Ego and Its Own\". While the latter has an \"un-Hegelian structure and tone\" on the whole and is hostile to Hegel's conclusions about the self and the world, Stepelevich argues that Stirner's work is best understood as answering Hegel's question of the role of consciousness after it has contemplated \"untrue knowledge\" and become \"absolute knowledge\". Stirner, Stepelevich concludes, presents the consequences of the rediscovering one's self-consciousness after realizing self-determination.\n\nScholars such as Douglas Moggach and Widukind De Ridder have argued that Stirner was obviously a student of Hegel, like his contemporaries Ludwig Feuerbach and Bruno Bauer, but this does not necessarily make him an Hegelian. Contrary to the Young Hegelians, Stirner scorned all attempts at an immanent critique of Hegel and the Enlightenment and renounced Bauer and Feuerbach's emancipatory claims as well. Contrary to Hegel, who considered the given as an inadequate embodiment of rationality, Stirner leaves the given intact by considering it a mere object, not of transformation, but of enjoyment and consumption (\"His Own\"). According to Douglas Moggach, Stirner does not go beyond Hegel, but in fact leaves the domain of philosophy in its entirety: \n\nIn 1842, \"Das unwahre Prinzip unserer Erziehung\" (\"The False Principle of our Education\") was published in Rheinische Zeitung, which was edited by Marx at the time. Written as a reaction to Otto Friedrich Theodor Heinsius' treatise \"Humanism vs. Realism\", Stirner explains that education in either the classical humanist method or the practical realist method still lacks true value. Education is therefore fulfilled in aiding the individual in becoming an individual.\n\n\"Kunst und Religion\" (\"Art and Religion\") was also published in Rheinische Zeitung on 14 June 1842. It addresses Bruno Bauer and his publication against Hegel called \"Hegel's doctrine of religion and art judged from the standpoint of faith\". Bauer had inverted Hegel's relation between Art and Religion, by claiming that Art was much more closely related to Philosophy than Religion, based on their shared determinacy and clarity, and a common ethical root. However, Stirner went beyond both Hegel and Bauer's criticism by asserting that \"Art\" rather created an object for \"Religion\" and could thus by no means be related to what Stirner considered—in opposition with Hegel and Bauer—to be \"Philosophy\": \n\nStirner deliberately left Philosophy out of the dialectical triad (Art–Religion–Philosophy) by claiming that Philosophy \"doesn't bother itself with objects\" (Religion), nor does it \"make an object\" (Art). In Stirner's account, Philosophy was in fact indifferent towards both Art and Religion. Stirner thus mocked and radicalised Bauer's criticism of religion.\n\nStirner's main work is \"Der Einzige und sein Eigenthum\" (in modern German spelling \"Der Einzige und sein Eigentum\"; in English \"The Ego and Its Own,\" literally \"The Unique and Its Property\"), which appeared in Leipzig in October 1844, with as year of publication mentioned 1845. In \"The Ego And Its Own\", Stirner launches a radical anti-authoritarian and individualist critique of contemporary Prussian society and modern western society as such. He offers an approach to human existence in which he depicts himself as \"the unique one\", a \"creative nothing,\" beyond the ability of language to fully express: \n\nThe book proclaims that all religions and ideologies rest on empty concepts. The same holds true for society's institutions that claim authority over the individual, be it the state, legislation, the church, or the systems of education such as universities.\n\nStirner's argument explores and extends the limits of criticism, aiming his critique especially at those of his contemporaries, particularly Ludwig Feuerbach and Bruno Bauer; and at popular ideologies, including religion, liberalism and humanism (which he regarded as analogous to religion with the abstract Man or humanity as the supreme being), nationalism, statism, capitalism, socialism and communism: \n\n\"Recensenten Stirners\" (\"Stirner's Critics\") was published in September 1845 in \"Wigands Vierteljahrsschrift\". It is a response in which Stirner refers to himself in the third-person to three critical reviews of \"The Ego and its Own\" by Moses Hess in \"Die letzten Philosophen\" (\"The Last Philosophers\"), by a certain Szeliga (alias of an adherent of Bruno Bauer) in an article in the journal \"Norddeutsche Blätter\" and by Ludwig Feuerbach anonymously in an article called \"Über 'Das Wesen des Christentums' in Beziehung auf Stirners 'Der Einzige und sein Eigentum' \" (\"On 'The Essence of Christianity' in Relation to Stirner's 'The Ego and its Own\"') in \"Wigands Vierteljahrsschrift\".\n\n\"Die Philosophischen Reactionäre\" (\"The Philosophical Reactionaries\") was published in 1847 in \"Die Epigonen\", a journal edited by Otto Wigand from Leipzig. At the time, Wigand had already published \"Der Einzige und sein Eigentum\" and was about to finish the publication of Stirner's translations of Adam Smith and Jean-Baptiste Say. As the subtitle indicates, \"Die Philosophischen Reactionäre\" was written in response to an article by Kuno Fischer (1824–1907) entitled \"Die Moderne Sophisten\" (1847). The article was signed G. Edward and its authorship has been disputed ever since John Henry Mackay \"cautiously\" attributed it to Stirner and included it in his collection of Stirner's lesser writings. It was first translated into English in 2011 and the introductory note explains: \n\nThe majority of the text deals with Kuno Fischer's definition of sophism. With much wit, the self-contradictory nature of Fischer's criticism of Sophism is exposed. Fischer had made a sharp distinction between Sophism and philosophy, while at the same time considering Sophism as the \"mirror image of philosophy\". The Sophists breathe \"philosophical air\" and were \"dialectically inspired to a formal volubility\". Stirner's answer is striking: \n\nLooking back on \"Der Einzige und sein Eigentum\", Stirner claims: \n\n\"Geschichte der Reaktion\" (\"History of Reaction\") was published in two volumes in 1851 by Allgemeine Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt and immediately banned in Austria. It was written in the context of the recent 1848 revolutions in German states and is mainly a collection of the works of others selected and translated by Stirner. The introduction and some additional passages were Stirner's work. Edmund Burke and Auguste Comte are quoted to show two opposing views of revolution.\n\nStirner's work did not go unnoticed among his contemporaries. Stirner's attacks on ideology—in particular Feuerbach's humanism—forced Feuerbach into print. Moses Hess (at that time close to Marx) and Szeliga (pseudonym of Franz Zychlin von Zychlinski, an adherent of Bruno Bauer) also replied to Stirner. Stirner answered the criticism in a German periodical in the article \"Stirner's Critics\" (original title \"Recensenten Stirners\", September 1845), which clarifies several points of interest to readers of the book—especially in relation to Feuerbach.\n\nWhile Marx's \"Sankt Max\" (large part of \"Die Deutsche Ideologie\"/\"The German Ideology\"), not published until 1932, so assured \"The Ego and Its Own\" a place of curious interest among Marxist readers, Marx's ridicule of Stirner has played a significant role in the preservation of Stirner's work in popular and academic discourse despite lacking mainstream popularity.\n\nTwenty years after the appearance of Stirner's book, the author Friedrich Albert Lange wrote the following: \n\nSome people believe that in a sense a \"second positive part\" was soon to be added, though not by Stirner, but by Friedrich Nietzsche. The relationship between Nietzsche and Stirner seems to be much more complicated. According to George J. Stack's \"Lange and Nietzsche\", Nietzsche read Lange's \"History of Materialism\" \"again and again\" and was therefore very familiar with the passage regarding Stirner.\n\nWhile \"Der Einzige\" was a critical success and attracted much reaction from famous philosophers after publication, it was out of print and the notoriety that it had provoked had faded many years before Stirner's death. Stirner had a destructive impact on left-Hegelianism, but his philosophy was a significant influence on Marx and his magnum opus became a founding text of individualist anarchism. Edmund Husserl once warned a small audience about the \"seducing power\" of \"Der Einzige\", but he never mentioned it in his writing. As the art critic and Stirner admirer Herbert Read observed, the book has remained \"stuck in the gizzard\" of Western culture since it first appeared.\n\nMany thinkers have read and been affected by \"The Ego and Its Own\" in their youth including Rudolf Steiner, Gustav Landauer, Victor Serge, Carl Schmitt and Jürgen Habermas. Few openly admit any influence on their own thinking. Ernst Jünger's book \"Eumeswil\", had the character of the Anarch, based on Stirner's Einzige. Several other authors, philosophers and artists have cited, quoted or otherwise referred to Max Stirner. They include Albert Camus in \"The Rebel\" (the section on Stirner is omitted from the majority of English editions including Penguin's), Benjamin Tucker, James Huneker, Dora Marsden, Renzo Novatore, Emma Goldman, Georg Brandes, John Cowper Powys, Martin Buber, Sidney Hook, Robert Anton Wilson, Horst Matthai, Frank Brand, Marcel Duchamp, several writers of the Situationist International including Raoul Vaneigem and Max Ernst. Oscar Wilde's \"The Soul of Man Under Socialism\" has caused some historians to speculate that Wilde (who could read German) was familiar with the book.\n\nSince its appearance in 1844, \"The Ego and Its Own\" has seen periodic revivals of popular, political and academic interest based around widely divergent translations and interpretations—some psychological, others political in their emphasis. Today, many ideas associated with post-left anarchy's criticism of ideology and uncompromising individualism are clearly related to Stirner's. His ideas were also adopted by post-anarchism, with Saul Newman largely in agreement with many of Stirner's criticisms of classical anarchism, including his rejection of revolution and essentialism.\n\nFriedrich Engels commented on Stirner in poetry at the time of \"Die Freien\": \n\nHe once even recalled at how they were \"great friends (Duzbrüder)\". In November 1844, Engels wrote a letter to Karl Marx. He reported first on a visit to Moses Hess in Cologne and then went on to note that during this visit Hess had given him a press copy of a new book by Max Stirner, \"Der Einzige und Sein Eigenthum\". In his letter to Marx, Engels promised to send a copy of \"Der Einzige\" to him, for it certainly deserved their attention as Stirner \"had obviously, among the 'Free Ones', the most talent, independence and diligence\". To begin with, Engels was enthusiastic about the book and expressed his opinions freely in letters to Marx: \n\nLater, Marx and Engels wrote a major criticism of Stirner's work. The number of pages Marx and Engels devote to attacking Stirner in (the unexpurgated text of) \"The German Ideology\", in which they derided him as \"Sankt Max\" (\"Saint Max\"), exceeds the total of Stirner's written works. As Isaiah Berlin has described it, Stirner \"is pursued through five hundred pages of heavy-handed mockery and insult\". The book was written in 1845–1846, but it was not published until 1932. Marx's lengthy, ferocious polemic against Stirner has since been considered an important turning point in Marx's intellectual development from idealism to materialism. It has been argued that historical materialism was Marx's method of reconciling communism with a Stirnerite rejection of morality.\n\nThe influential French poststructuralist thinker Jacques Derrida in his book \"Specters of Marx\" dealt with Stirner and his relationship with Marx while also analysing Stirner's concept of \"specters\" or \"spooks\". Gilles Deleuze, another key thinker associated with post-structuralism mentions Stirner briefly in his book \"The Logic of Sense\". Saul Newman calls Stirner a proto-poststructuralist who on the one hand had essentially anticipated modern post-structuralists such as Foucault, Lacan, Deleuze and Derrida, but on the other had already transcended them, thus providing what they were unable to—i.e. a ground for a non-essentialist critique of present liberal capitalist society. This is particularly evident in Stirner's identification of the self with a \"creative nothing\", a thing that cannot be bound by ideology (like leftist or Marxists ideology of French post-structuralists), inaccessible to representation in language.\n\nThe ideas of Max Stirner and Friedrich Nietzsche have often been compared and many authors have discussed apparent similarities in their writings, sometimes raising the question of influence. In Germany, during the early years of Nietzsche's emergence as a well-known figure the only thinker discussed in connection with his ideas more often than Stirner was Arthur Schopenhauer. It is certain that Nietzsche read about \"The Ego and Its Own\", which was mentioned in Friedrich Albert Lange's \"History of Materialism\" and Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann's \"Philosophy of the Unconscious\", both of which Nietzsche knew well. However, there is no indication that he actually read it as no mention of Stirner is known to exist anywhere in Nietzsche's publications, papers or correspondence. In 2002, a biographical discovery revealed it is probable that Nietzsche had encountered Stirner's ideas before he read Hartmann and Lange in October 1865, when he met with Eduard Mushacke, an old friend of Stirner's during the 1840s.\n\nYet as soon as Nietzsche's work began to reach a wider audience, the question of whether he owed a debt of influence to Stirner was raised. As early as 1891 (while Nietzsche was still alive, though incapacitated by mental illness), von Hartmann went so far as to suggest that he had plagiarized Stirner. By the turn of the century, the belief that Nietzsche had been influenced by Stirner was so widespread that it became something of a commonplace, at least in Germany, prompting one observer to note in 1907 that \"Stirner's influence in modern Germany has assumed astonishing proportions, and moves in general parallel with that of Nietzsche. The two thinkers are regarded as exponents of essentially the same philosophy\".\n\nNevertheless, from the beginning of what was characterized as \"great debate\" regarding Stirner's possible positive influence on Nietzsche, serious problems with the idea were noted. By the middle of the 20th century, if Stirner was mentioned at all in works on Nietzsche, the idea of influence was often dismissed outright or abandoned as unanswerable.\n\nHowever, the idea that Nietzsche was influenced in some way by Stirner continues to attract a significant minority, perhaps because it seems necessary to explain the oft-noted (though arguably superficial) similarities in their writings. In any case, the most significant problems with the theory of possible Stirner influence on Nietzsche are not limited to the difficulty in establishing whether the one man knew of or read the other. They also consist in determining if Stirner in particular might have been a meaningful influence on a man as widely read as Nietzsche.\n\nThe individualist-anarchist orientation of Rudolf Steiner's early philosophy—before he turned to theosophy around 1900—has strong parallels to and was admittedly influenced by Stirner's conception of the ego, for which Steiner claimed to have provided a philosophical foundation.\n\nStirner's philosophy was important in the development of modern anarchist thought, particularly individualist anarchism and egoist anarchism. Although Stirner is usually associated with individualist anarchism, he was influential to many social anarchists such as anarcha-feminists Emma Goldman and Federica Montseny. In European individualist anarchism, he influenced its main proponents after him such as Émile Armand, Han Ryner, Renzo Novatore, John Henry Mackay, Miguel Giménez Igualada and Lev Chernyi.\n\nIn American individualist anarchism, he found adherence in Benjamin Tucker and his magazine \"Liberty\" while these abandoned natural rights positions for egoism. Several periodicals \"were undoubtedly influenced by \"Liberty\"'s presentation of egoism\". They included \"I\", published by Clarence Lee Swartz and edited by William Walstein Gordak and J. William Lloyd (all associates of \"Liberty\"); and \"The Ego and The Egoist\", both of which were edited by Edward H. Fulton. Among the egoist papers that Tucker followed, there were the German \"Der Eigene\", edited by Adolf Brand; and \"The Eagle and The Serpent\", issued from London. The latter, the most prominent English-language egoist journal, was published from 1898 to 1900 with the subtitle \"A Journal of Egoistic Philosophy and Sociology\". Other American egoist anarchists around the early 20th century include James L. Walker, George Schumm, John Beverley Robinson, Steven T. Byington and Edward H. Fulton.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Herbert Read was influenced by Stirner and noted the closeness of Stirner's egoism to existentialism (see existentialist anarchism). Later in the 1960s, Daniel Guérin says in \"Anarchism: From Theory to Practice\" that Stirner \"rehabilitated the individual at a time when the philosophical field was dominated by Hegelian anti-individualism and most reformers in the social field had been led by the misdeeds of bourgeois egotism to stress its opposite\" and pointed to \"the boldness and scope of his thought\". In the 1970s, an American Situationist collective called For Ourselves published a book called \"\" in which they advocate a \"communist egoism\" basing themselves on Stirner.\n\nLater in the United States, it emerged the tendency of post-left anarchy which was influenced profoundly by Stirner in aspects such as the critique of ideology. Jason McQuinn says that \"when I (and other anti-ideological anarchists) criticize ideology, it is always from a specifically critical, anarchist perspective rooted in both the skeptical, individualist-anarchist philosophy of Max Stirner\". Bob Black and Feral Faun/Wolfi Landstreicher strongly adhere to Stirnerist egoism. In the hybrid of post-structuralism and anarchism called post-anarchism, Saul Newman has written on Stirner and his similarities to post-structuralism. Insurrectionary anarchism also has an important relationship with Stirner as can be seen in the work of Wolfi Landstreicher and Alfredo Bonanno who has also written on him in works such as \"Max Stirner\" and \"Max Stirner und der Anarchismus\".\n\nThe German stirnerist Adolf Brand produced the homosexual periodical \"Der Eigene\" in 1896. This was the first ongoing homosexual publication in the world and ran until 1931. The name was taken from the writings of Stirner (who had greatly influenced the young Brand) and refers to Stirner's concept of \"self-ownership\" of the individual. Another early homosexual activist influenced by Stirner was John Henry Mackay. Feminists influenced by Stirner include Dora Marsden who edited the journals \"The Freewoman\" and \"The New Freewoman\" and anarchist Emma Goldman. Stirner also influenced free love and polyamory propagandist Émile Armand in the context of French individualist anarchism of the early 20th century which is known for \"[t]he call of nudist naturism, the strong defense of birth control methods, the idea of \"unions of egoists\" with the sole justification of sexual practices\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "654340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=654340", "title": "Mount Wutai", "text": "Mount Wutai\n\nMount Wutai, also known by its Chinese name Wutaishan and as is a sacred Buddhist site at the headwaters of the Qingshui in Shanxi Province, China. Its central area is surrounded by a cluster of flat-topped peaks roughly corresponding to the cardinal directions. The north peak (Beitai Ding or Yedou Feng) is the highest () and is also the highest point in northern China.\n\nAs host to over 53 sacred monasteries, Mount Wutai is home to many of China's most important monasteries and temples. It was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2009 and named a AAAAA tourist attraction by China's National Tourism Administration in 2007.\n\nMount Wutai is one of the Four Sacred Mountains in Chinese Buddhism. Each of the mountains is viewed as the bodhimaṇḍa (dàocháng; 道場) of one of the four great bodhisattvas. Wǔtái is the home of the Bodhisattva of wisdom, Mañjuśrī or \"Wénshū\" (文殊) in Chinese. Mañjuśrī has been associated with Mount Wutai since ancient times. Paul Williams writes:\n\nWutai was the first of the mountains to be identified and is often referred to as \"first among the four great mountains\". It was identified on the basis of a passage in the \"Avataṃsaka Sūtra\", which describes the abodes of many bodhisattvas. In this chapter, Mañjuśrī is said to reside on a \"clear cold mountain\" in the northeast. This served as charter for the mountain's identity and its alternate name \"Clear Cool Mountain\" (Ch: Qīngliáng Shān; 清涼山).\n\nThe bodhisattva is believed to frequently appear on the mountain, taking the form of ordinary pilgrims, monks, or most often unusual five-colored clouds.\n\nMount Wutai has an enduring relationship with Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nMount Wutai is home to some of the oldest wooden buildings in China that have survived since the era of the Tang Dynasty (618–907). This includes the main hall of Nanchan Temple and the East Hall of Foguang Temple, built in 782 and 857, respectively. They were discovered in 1937 and 1938 by a team of architectural historians including the prominent early 20th-century historian Liang Sicheng. The architectural designs of these buildings have since been studied by leading sinologists and experts in traditional Chinese architecture, such as Nancy Steinhardt. Steinhardt classified these buildings according to the hall types featured in the \"Yingzao Fashi\" Chinese building manual written in the 12th century.\n\nIn 2008, there were complaints from local residents that, in preparation for Mount Wutai's bid to become a UNESCO World Heritage Site, they were forced from their homes and relocated away from their livelihoods.\n\nNanshan Temple (Chinese: 南山寺) is a large temple in Mount Wǔtái, first built in the Yuan Dynasty. The whole temple comprises seven terraces, divided into three parts. The lower three terraces are named Jile Temple 極樂寺); the middle terrace is called Shande Hall (善德堂); the upper three terraces are named Youguo Temple (佑國寺). Other major temples include Xiantong Temple, Tayuan Temple and Pusading Temple.\n\nOther important temples inside Mount Wutai include Shouning Temple, Bishan Temple, Puhua Temple, Dailuo Ding, Qixian Temple, Shifang Tang, Shuxiang Temple, Guangzong Temple, Youguo Temple, Guanyin Dong, Longhua Temple, Luomuhou Temple, Jinge Temple, Zhanshan Temple, Wanfo Ge, Guanhai Temple, Zhulin Temple, Jifu Temple, and Gufo Temple.\n\nOuter Mount Wutai temples include Yanqing Temple, Nanchan Temple, Mimi Temple, Foguang Temple, Yanshan Temple, Zunsheng Temple, and Guangji Temple. A giant statue of Maha Manjushree was presented to the Buddhists of China by foreign minister of Nepal Ramesh Nath Pandey in 2005.\n\nThe Wutaishan Airport in nearby Dingxiang County opened in December 2015.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5138749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5138749", "title": "Our Lady of the Rosary", "text": "Our Lady of the Rosary\n\nOur Lady of the Rosary, also known as Our Lady of the Holy Rosary, is a title of the Blessed Virgin Mary in relation to the Rosary.\n\nThe Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary, formerly known as Our Lady of Victory and Feast of the Holy Rosary, is a feast day of the Roman Catholic Church, celebrated on 7 October, the anniversary of the decisive victory of the combined fleet of the Holy League of 1571 over the Ottoman navy at the Battle of Lepanto.\n\nAccording to Dominican tradition, in 1206, St. Dominic was in Prouille, France, attempting to convert the Albigensians back to the Catholic faith. The young priest had little success until one day he received a vision of the Blessed Virgin, who gave him the Rosary as a tool against heretics. While Mary's giving the rosary to St. Dominic is generally acknowledged as a legend, the development of this prayer form owes much to the followers of St. Dominic, including the 15th-century priest and teacher, Alanus de Rupe.\nIn 1571, Pope St. Pius V organized a coalition of forces from Spain and smaller Christian kingdoms, republics and military orders, to rescue Christian outposts in Cyprus, particularly the Venetian outpost at Famagusta which, however, surrendered after a long siege on August 1 before the Christian forces set sail. On October 7, 1571, the Holy League, a coalition of southern European Catholic maritime states, sailed from Messina, Sicily, and met a powerful Ottoman fleet in the Battle of Lepanto. Knowing that the Christian forces were at a distinct materiel disadvantage, the holy pontiff, Pope Pius V, called for all of Europe to pray the Rosary for victory, and led a rosary procession in Rome.\n\nAfter about five hours of fighting on the northern edge of the Gulf of Corinth, off western Greece, the combined navies of the Papal States, Venice and Spain managed to stop the Ottoman navy, slowing the Ottoman advance to the west and denying them access to the Atlantic Ocean and the Americas. If the Ottomans had won then there was a real possibility that an invasion of Italy could have followed so that the Ottoman sultan, already claiming to be emperor of the Romans, would have been in possession of both New and Old Rome. Combined with the unfolding events in Morocco where the Sa’adids successfully spurned the Ottoman advances, it confined Turkish naval power to the eastern Mediterranean. Although the Ottoman Empire was able to build more ships, it never fully recovered from the loss of trained sailors and marines, and was never again the Mediterranean naval power it had become the century before when Constantinople fell.\n\nPius V instituted \"Our Lady of Victory\" as an annual feast to commemorate the victory at Lepanto, which he attributed to the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nDedications to Our Lady of Victory had preceded this papal declaration. In particular, Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester built the first shrine dedicated to Our Lady of Victory in thanks for the Catholic victory over the Albigensians at the Battle of Muret on September 12, 1213. In thanksgiving for victory at the Battle of Bouvines in July 1214, Philip Augustus of France founded the Abbey of Notre Dame de la Victoire, between Senlis and Mont l'Evêque.\n\nIn 1573, Pope Gregory XIII changed the title of the \"Feast of Our Lady of Victory\" to \"Feast of the Holy Rosary\", to be celebrated on the first Sunday of October. Dominican friar Juan Lopez in his 1584 book on the rosary states that the feast of the rosary was offered \"in memory and in perpetual gratitude of the miraculous victory that the Lord gave to his Christian people that day against the Turkish armada\".\n\nIn 1671 the observance of this festival was extended by Clement X to the whole of Spain, and somewhat later Clement XI, after the victory over the Turks gained by Prince Eugene in the Battle of Petrovaradin on 5 August 1716 (the feast of Our Lady of the Snows), commanded the feast of the Rosary to be celebrated by the universal Church.\n\nLeo XIII raised the feast to the rank of a double of the second class and added to the Litany of Loreto the invocation \"Queen of the Most Holy Rosary\". On this feast, in every church in which the Rosary confraternity has been duly erected, a plenary indulgence \"toties quoties\" is granted upon certain conditions to all who visit therein the Rosary chapel or statue of Our Lady. This has been called the \"Portiuncula\" of the Rosary.\nPius X in 1913 changed the date to 7 October, as part of his effort to restore celebration of the liturgy of the Sundays. \nIn 1960 Pope John XXIII changed the title to \"Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary\".\n\nOur Lady of the Rosary is the patron saint of several places around the world. The diocese of Malaga, Spain (which, however celebrates her patronage on September 8), and the Spanish cities of Melilla and Trujillo celebrate Our Lady of Victories as their patroness. Furthermore, \"María del Rosario\" is a common female Spanish name (colloquially abbreviated to \"Rosario\" or \"Charo\"). \"Rosario\" can also be used as a male first name, particularly in Italian. The cathedral for the Diocese of Toledo in Toledo, Ohio is named after Our Lady Of the Rosary.\n\nThe cathedral of Our Lady of the Rosary is located in Duluth, Minnesota. The cathedral church of the Diocese of San Bernardino, California, is also named in honor of Our Lady of the Rosary. The church of Our Lady of the Rosary on State Street in New York City began in 1883 as the Mission of Our Lady of the Rosary for the protection of Irish immigrant girls; it houses the shrine of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton. A new Sanctuary was erected in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina in honor of Our Lady of the Rosary of San Nicolás and apparitions and locations were approved \"worthy of belief\" by the local ordinary in May 2006. Our Lady of the Rosary church is in Jashpur, Chhattisgarh, India. It is the second largest church in Asia, by seating capacity which can accommodate 10,000 worshippers.\n\nAlthough the title Our Lady of Victory has been superseded to some extent by that of Our Lady of the Rosary, the former is still in popular use at a number of parishes and schools.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30872816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30872816", "title": "Planets in astrology", "text": "Planets in astrology\n\nPlanets in astrology have a meaning different from the modern astronomical understanding of what a planet is. Before the age of telescopes, the night sky was thought to consist of two very similar components: fixed stars, which remained motionless in relation to each other, and \"wandering stars\" ( \"asteres planetai\"), which moved relative to the fixed stars over the course of the year.\n\nTo the Greeks and the other earliest astronomers, this group consisted of the five planets visible to the naked eye and excluded Earth. Although strictly, the term \"planet\" applied only to those five objects, the term was latterly broadened, particularly in the Middle Ages, to include the Sun and the Moon (sometimes referred to as \"Lights\"), making a total of seven planets. Astrologers retain this definition today.\n\nTo ancient astrologers, the planets represented the will of the gods and their direct influence upon human affairs. To modern astrologers, the planets represent basic drives or urges in the unconscious, or energy flow regulators representing dimensions of experience. They express themselves with different qualities in the twelve signs of the zodiac and in the twelve houses. The planets are also related to each other in the form of aspects.\n\nModern astrologers differ on the source of the planets' influence. Hone writes that the planets exert it directly through gravitation or another, unknown influence. Others hold that the planets have no direct influence in themselves, but are mirrors of basic organizing principles in the universe. In other words, the basic patterns of the universe repeat themselves everywhere, in fractal-like fashion, and \"as above, so below\". Therefore, the patterns that the planets make in the sky reflect the ebb and flow of basic human impulses. The planets are also associated, especially in the Chinese tradition, with the basic forces of nature.\n\nListed below are the specific meanings and domains associated with the astrological planets since ancient times, with the main focus on the Western astrological tradition. The planets in Hindu astrology are known as the Navagraha or \"nine realms\". In Chinese astrology, the planets are associated with the life forces of yin and yang and the five elements, which play an important role in the Chinese form of geomancy known as Feng Shui. Astrologers differ on the signs associated with each planet's exaltation.\n\nThis table shows the astrological planets (as distinct from the astronomical) and the Greek and Roman deities associated with them. In most cases, the English name for planets derives from the name of a Roman god or goddess. Also of interest is the conflation of the Roman god with a similar Greek god. In some cases, it is the same deity with two different names.\n\nTreatises on the Ptolemaic planets and their influence on people born \"under their reign\" appear in block book form, so-called \"planet books\" or \"Planetenbücher\". This genre is atteted in numerous manuscripts beginning in the mid 15th century in the Alemannic German areal; it remains popular throughout the German Renaissance, exerting great iconographical influence far into the 17th century.\n\nThese books usually list a male and a female Titan with each planet, Cronus and Rhea with Saturn, Eurymedon and Themis with Jupiter, probably Crius and Dione with Mars, Hyperion and Theia with Sun, Atlas and Phoebe with Moon, Coeus and Metis with Mercury, and Oceanus and Tethys with Venus.\n\nThe qualities inherited from the planets by their children are as follows:\n\nThe seven classical planets are those easily seen with the naked eye, and were thus known to ancient astrologers. They are the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Sometimes, the Sun and Moon were referred to as \"the lights\" or the \"luminaries\". Vesta and Uranus can also just be seen with the naked eye, though no ancient culture appears to have taken note of them. The astrological descriptions attached to the seven classical planets have been preserved since ancient times. Astrologers call the seven classical planets \"the seven personal and social planets\", because they are said to represent the basic human drives of every individual. The personal planets are the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus and Mars. The social or transpersonal planets are Jupiter and Saturn. Jupiter and Saturn are often called the first of the \"transpersonal\" or \"transcendent\" planets as they represent a transition from the inner personal planets to the outer modern, impersonal planets. The outer modern planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are often called the collective or transcendental planets. The following is a list of the planets and their associated characteristics.\n\nThe Sun () is the ruling planet of Leo and is exalted in Aries. In classical Greek mythology, the Sun was represented by the Titans Hyperion and Helios (Roman Sol, and later by Apollo, the god of light). The Sun is the star at the center of our solar system, around which the Earth and other planets revolve and provides us with heat and light. The arc that the Sun travels in every year, rising and setting in a slightly different place each day, is therefore in reality a reflection of the Earth's own orbit around the Sun. This arc is larger the farther north or south from the equator latitude, giving a more extreme difference between day and night and between seasons during the year. The Sun travels through the twelve signs of the zodiac on its annual journey, spending about a month in each. The Sun's position on a person's birthday therefore determines what is usually called his or her \"sun\" sign. However, the sun sign allotment varies between Western (sign change around 22-23 of every month) and Hindu astrology (sign change around 14-15 of every month) due the different systems of planetary calculations, following the tropical and sidereal definitions respectively.\n\nAstrologically speaking, the Sun is usually thought to represent the conscious ego, the self and its expression, personal power, pride and authority, leadership qualities and the principles of creativity, spontaneity, health and vitality, the sum of which is named the \"life force\". One of the first recorded references to Sun worship is from the Mesopotamian Religion and described in the Epic of Gilgamesh. The 1st-century poet Marcus Manilius in his epic, 8000-verse poem, \"Astronomica\", described the Sun, or \"Sol\", as benign and favorable. In medicine, the Sun is associated with the heart, circulatory system, and the thymus. Additionally, humans depend on the sun to produce and obtain vitamin D; an important supplement aiding the body's immune system and bone health. In Ayurveda, it rules over life-force (praan-shakti), governs bile temperament (pitta), stomach, bones and eyes. In modern astrology, the Sun is the primary native ruler of the fifth house, but traditionally it had its joy in the ninth house.\n\nThe Sun is associated with Sunday. Dante Alighieri associated the Sun with the liberal art of music. In Chinese astrology, the Sun represents Yang, the active, assertive masculine life principle.\n\nThe Moon () is the ruling planet of Cancer and is exalted in Taurus. In classical Roman mythology, the Moon was Luna, at times identified with Diana. The Moon is large enough for its gravity to affect the Earth, stabilizing its orbit and producing the regular ebb and flow of the tides. The lunar day syncs up with its orbit around Earth in such a manner that the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth and the other side, known as the \"far side of the Moon\" faces towards space.\nAstrologically speaking, the Moon is associated with a person's emotional make-up, unconscious habits, rhythms, memories, moods and their ability to react and adapt to those around them. It is also associated with the mother, maternal instincts or the urge to nurture, the home, the need for security and the past, especially early experiences and childhood. The 1st-century poet Manilius described the Moon, or \"Luna\", as melancholic. In medicine, the Moon is associated with the digestive system, stomach, breasts, the ovaries and menstruation (which does occur on a monthly cycle) and the pancreas. Despite Manilius's assignation, the Moon is commonly associated with the phlegmatic humor; it ruled the animal spirits. In modern astrology, the Moon is the primary native ruler of the fourth house, but traditionally it had its joy in the third house.\n\nThe Moon or \"Luna\" is associated with Monday, the word Monday comes from the Old English word for Moon day or Moon's day, and in Romance languages, the name for Monday comes from \"luna\" (e.g., \"luni\" in Romanian, \"lundi\" in French, \"lunes\" in Spanish and \"lunedi\" in Italian). Dante Alighieri associated the Moon with the liberal art of grammar.\n\nIn Chinese astrology, the Moon represents Yin, the passive and receptive feminine life principle. In Indian astrology, the Moon is called Chandra or Soma and represents the mind, queenship and mother. The north lunar node (called Rahu) and the south lunar node (called Ketu) are considered to be of particular importance and are given an equal place alongside the seven classical planets as part of the nine navagraha.\n\nMercury () is the ruling planet of Gemini and is exalted in Virgo and/or Aquarius. In classical Roman mythology, Mercury is the messenger of the gods, noted for his speed and swiftness. Echoing this, the scorching, airless world Mercury circles the Sun on the fastest orbit of any planet. Mercury takes only 88 days to orbit the Sun, spending about 7.33 days in each sign of the zodiac. Mercury is so close to the Sun that only a brief period exists after the Sun has set where it can be seen with the naked eye, before following the Sun beyond the horizon.\n\nAstrologically speaking, Mercury represents the principles of communication, mentality, thinking patterns, rationality and reasoning, and adaptability and variability. Mercury governs schooling and education, the immediate environment of neighbors, siblings and cousins, transport over short distances, messages and forms of communication such as post, email and telephone, newspapers, journalism and writing, information gathering skills and physical dexterity. The 1st-century poet Marcus Manilius described Mercury as an inconstant, vivacious and curious planet.\nIn medicine, Mercury is associated with the nervous system, the brain, the respiratory system, the thyroid and the sense organs. It is traditionally held to be essentially cold and dry, according to its placement in the zodiac and in any aspects to other planets.\n\nIn modern astrology, Mercury is regarded as the ruler of the third house; traditionally, it had the joy in the first house. Mercury is the messenger of the gods in mythology. It is the planet of day-to-day expression and relationships. Mercury's action is to take things apart and put them back together again. It is an opportunistic planet, decidedly unemotional and curious.\n\nMercury rules over Wednesday. In Romance languages, the word for Wednesday is often similar to Mercury (\"miercuri\" in Romanian, \"mercredi\" in French, \"miercoles\" in Spanish and \"mercoledì\" in Italian). Dante Alighieri associated Mercury with the liberal art of dialectic.\n\nIn Chinese astrology Mercury represents Water, the fourth element, therefore symbolizing communication, intelligence, and elegance.\n\nVenus () is the ruling planet of Libra and is exalted in Pisces. In classical Roman mythology, Venus is the goddess of love and beauty, famous for the passions she could stir among the gods. Her cults may represent the religiously legitimate charm and seduction of the divine by mortals, in contrast to the formal, contractual relations between most members of Rome's official pantheon and the state, and the unofficial, illicit manipulation of divine forces through magic. The ambivalence of her function is suggested in the etymological relationship of the root *venes- with Latin venenum (poison, venom), in the sense of \"a charm, magic philtre\".\n\nVenus orbits the Sun in 225 days, spending about 18.75 days in each sign of the zodiac. Venus is the second-brightest object in the night sky, the Moon being the brightest. It is usually beheld as a twin planet to Earth.\n\nAstrologically speaking, Venus is associated with the principles of harmony, resilience, beauty, refinement, solidarity, affections, equality, and the urge to sympathize and unite with others. It is involved with the desire for pleasure, comfort and ease. It governs romantic relations, marriage and business partnerships, sex (the origin of the words 'venery' and 'venereal'), the arts, fashion and social life. The 1st-century poet Marcus Manilius described Venus as generous and fecund and the lesser benefic.\nThe planet Venus in medicine is associated with the lumbar region, the veins, parathyroids, throat and kidneys. Venus was thought to be moderately warm and moist and was associated with the phlegmatic humor. In modern astrology, Venus is the ruler of the seventh house; traditionally, it had the joy in the fifth house.\n\nVenus is the planet of Friday. In languages deriving from Latin, such as Romanian, Spanish, French, and Italian, the word for Friday often resembles the word Venus (\"vineri\", \"viernes\", \"vendredi\" and \"venerdì\" respectively). Dante Alighieri associated Venus with the liberal art of rhetoric. In Chinese astrology, Venus is associated with the element metal, which is unyielding, strong and persistent. In Indian astrology, Venus is known as Shukra and represents wealth, pleasure and reproduction. In Norse Paganism, the planet is associated to Freyja, the goddess of love, beauty and fertility.\n\nMars () is the ruling planet of Aries and is exalted in Capricorn. Mars is the Roman god of war and bloodshed, whose symbol is a spear and shield. Both the soil of Mars and the hemoglobin of human blood are rich in iron and because of this they share its distinct deep red color. He was second in importance only to Jupiter and Saturn, due to Mars being the most prominent of the military gods worshipped by the Roman legions. \n\nMars orbits the Sun in 687 days, spending about 57.25 days in each sign of the zodiac. It is also the first planet that orbits outside of Earth's orbit, making it the first planet that does not set along with the Sun. Mars has two permanent polar ice caps. During a pole's winter, it lies in continuous darkness, chilling the surface and causing the deposition of 25–30% of the atmosphere into slabs of CO ice (dry ice).\n\nAstrologically speaking, Mars is associated with confidence and self-assertion, aggression, sexuality, energy, strength, ambition and impulsiveness. Mars governs sports, competitions and physical activities in general. The 1st-century poet Manilius, described the planet as ardent and as the lesser malefic. In medicine, Mars presides over the genitals, the muscular system, the gonads and adrenal glands. It was traditionally held to be hot and excessively dry and ruled the choleric humor. It was associated with fever, accidents, trauma, pain and surgery.\nIn modern astrology, Mars is the primary native ruler of the first house. Traditionally however, Mars ruled both the third and tenth houses, and had its joy in the sixth house. While Venus tends to the overall relationship atmosphere, Mars is the passionate impulse and action, the masculine aspect, discipline, willpower and stamina.\n\nMars is associated with Tuesday and in Romance languages the word for Tuesday often resembles Mars (in Romanian, \"marţi\", in Spanish, \"martes\", in French, \"mardi\" and in Italian \"martedì\"). The English \"Tuesday\" is a modernised form of \"Tyr's Day\", Tyr being the Germanic analogue to Mars. Dante Alighieri associated Mars with the liberal art of arithmetic. In Chinese astrology, Mars is ruled by the element fire, which is passionate, energetic and adventurous. In Indian astrology, Mars is called Mangala and represents energy, confidence and ego. \n\nJupiter () is the ruling planet of Sagittarius and it is exalted in Cancer. In classical Roman mythology, Jupiter is the ruler of the gods and their guardian and protector, and his symbol is the thunderbolt. The Romans believed that Jupiter granted them supremacy because they had honored him more than any other people had. Jupiter was \"the fount of the auspices upon which the relationship of the city with the gods rested.\" He personified the divine authority of Rome's highest offices, internal organization, and external relations. His image in the Republican and Imperial Capitol bore regalia associated with Rome's ancient kings and the highest consular and Imperial honours.\n\nIn the same way, the planet Jupiter is the king of the other planets, a giant in size with spectacular, brightly colored clouds and intense storms. Some astronomers believe that it plays an important protecting role in using its massive gravity to capture or expel from the solar system many comets and asteroids that would otherwise threaten Earth and the inner planets. Jupiter takes 11.9 years to orbit the Sun, spending almost an earth year (361 days) in each sign of the zodiac. Furthermore, Jupiter is usually the fourth-brightest object in the sky (after the Sun, the Moon and Venus).\n\nAstrologically speaking, Jupiter is associated with the principles of growth, expansion, prosperity, and good fortune. Jupiter governs long distance and foreign travel, big business and wealth, higher education, religion, and the law. It is also associated with the urge for freedom and exploration, as well with gambling and merrymaking.\nThe 1st-century poet Manilius described Jupiter as temperate and benign, and the greater benefic. It was regarded as warm and moist in nature, and therefore favorable to life. In medicine, Jupiter is associated with the liver, pituitary gland, and the disposition of fats; it governed the sanguine humor. In modern astrology, Jupiter is the primary native ruler of the ninth house, but traditionally, Jupiter was assigned to both the second and ninth houses: the house of values and the house of beliefs, respectively, and had its joy in the eleventh house of good luck.\n\nJupiter is associated with Thursday, and in Romance languages, the name for Thursday often comes from Jupiter (e.g., \"joi\" in Romanian, \"jeudi\" in French, \"jueves\" in Spanish, and \"giovedì\" in Italian). Dante Alighieri associated Jupiter with the liberal art of geometry. In Chinese astrology, Jupiter is ruled by the element wood, which is patient, hard-working, and reliable. In Indian astrology, Jupiter is known as Guru or Brihaspati and is known as the 'great teacher'. \n\nSaturn () is the ruling planet of Capricorn and is exalted in Libra. In classical Roman mythology, Saturn is the god of seeds, crops, and the harvest (agriculture), leader of the titans, father and founder of civilizations, social order, and conformity. The glyph is shaped like a scythe, but it is known as the \"crescent below the cross\", whereas Jupiter's glyph is the \"crescent above the cross\". Famous rings of the planet Saturn that enclose and surround it, reflect the idea of human limits. Saturn takes 29.5 years to orbit the Sun, spending about 2.46 years in each sign of the zodiac. During ancient Roman society, the Romans worshipped Saturn as the highest ranking and most important god among their pantheon of deities, sharing that same prestige with Jupiter.\n\nAstrologically speaking, Saturn is associated with focus, precision, nobility, ethics, civility, lofty goals, career, great achievements, dedication, authority figures, ordered hierarchy, stability, virtues, productiveness, valuable hard lessons learned, destiny, traditions, structures, protective roles, balance, and karma (reaping what you have sowed or divine cosmic justice) but with limitations, restrictions, boundaries, anxiety, tests, practicality, reality, and time. It concerns a person's sense of duty, commitment, responsibility, including their physical and emotional endurance in times of hardships. Saturn also represents the part of a person's concern with long-term planning or foresight. The Return of Saturn is said to mark significant events in each person's life. According to the 1st-century poet Manilius, Saturn is sad, morose, and cold, and is the greater malefic. According to Claudius Ptolemy, \"Saturn is lord of the right ear, the spleen, the bladder, the phlegm, and the bones.\" Saturn symbolized processes and things that were dry and cold, which are necessary balancing aspects to maintain life. It governed the melancholic humor.\n\nAccording to Sefer Yetzirah – GRA Version – Kaplan 4:13\n\n\"He made the letter Resh king over Peace\nAnd He bound a crown to it\nAnd He combined one with another\nAnd with them He formed\nSaturn in the Universe\nFriday in the Year\nThe left nostril in the Soul,\nmale and female.\"\nBefore the discovery of Uranus, Saturn was regarded as the ruling planet of Aquarius alongside Capricorn of course, which is the preceding sign. Many traditional types of astrologers refer Saturn as the planetary ruler for both Capricorn and Aquarius. In modern astrology, it is the primary native ruler of the tenth house. Traditionally however, Saturn ruled both the first and eighth houses, and had its joy in the twelfth house of mischief and bad luck.\n\nSaturn is associated with Saturday, which was named after the deity Saturn. Dante Alighieri associated Saturn with the liberal art of \"astronomia\" (astronomy and astrology).\n\nIn Chinese astrology, Saturn is ruled by the element earth, which is warm, generous, and co-operative. In Indian astrology, Saturn is called Shani or \"Sani\", representing a noteworthy career and longevity. He is also the bringer of obstacles and hardship.\n\nSince the invention of the telescope, Western astrology has incorporated Uranus, Neptune, Ceres, Pluto, and other bodies into its methodology. The Indian and Chinese astrologies have tended to retain the ancient seven-planet system. Meanings have had to be assigned to them by modern astrologers, usually according to the major events that occurred in the world at the time of their discovery. As these astrologers are usually Western, the social and historical events they describe have an inevitable Western emphasis. Astrologers consider the \"extra-Saturnian\" planets to be \"impersonal\" or generational planets, meaning their effects are felt more across whole generations of society. Their effects in individuals depend upon how strongly they feature in that individual's birth-chart. The following are their characteristics as accepted by most astrologers.\n\nUranus () is the ruling planet of Aquarius and is exalted in Scorpio. In classical Greek mythology, Uranus is the personification of the sky. The planet Uranus is very unusual among the planets in that it rotates on its side, so that it presents each of its poles to the Sun in turn during its orbit; causing both hemispheres to alternate between being bathed in light and lying in total darkness over the course of the orbit.\n\nUranus takes 84 years to orbit the Sun, spending about 7 years in each sign of the zodiac. Uranus was discovered to be a planet only in 1781 by Sir William Herschel.\n\nAstrological interpretations associate Uranus with the principles of ingenuity, new or unconventional ideas, individuality, discoveries, electricity, inventions, democracy, and revolutions. Uranus, among all planets, most governs genius.\nUranus governs societies, clubs, and any group based on humanitarian or progressive ideals. Uranus, the planet of sudden and unexpected changes, rules freedom and originality. In society, it rules radical ideas and people, as well as revolutionary events that upset established structures. Uranus is also associated with Wednesday, alongside Mercury (since Uranus is in the higher octave of Mercury).\n\nIn art and literature, the discovery of Uranus coincided with the Romantic movement, which emphasized individuality and freedom of creative expression. Additionally, it is often linked to an individual's animal spirit. When it comes to medicine, Uranus is believed to be particularly associated with the sympathetic nervous system, mental disorders, breakdowns and hysteria, spasms, and cramps. Uranus is considered by modern astrologers to be the primary native ruler of the eleventh house.\n\nNeptune () is the ruling planet of Pisces and is exalted in Leo. In classical Roman mythology, Neptune is the god of the sea, and the deep, ocean blue color of the planet Neptune reflects this. Its glyph is taken directly from Neptune's trident, symbolizing the curve of spirit being pierced by the cross of matter. Neptune takes 165 years to orbit the Sun, spending approximately 14 years (13.75) in each sign of the zodiac. Neptune was discovered in 1846.\nAstrologically speaking, Neptune is associated with idealism, dreams, dissolution, artistry, and empathy, but with illusion and vagueness too. Its appearance coincided with the discovery of anesthetics and hypnotism. In political terms, Neptune was linked to the rise of nationalist movements throughout Europe in countries like Germany, Italy, Hungary, Ireland, and Serbia, seeking independence for their nations inspired by an idealized past of legend. It was also linked to the rise of socialism and the beginnings of the welfare state. Neptune coincided with the utopian ideals of Communism, when Marx and Engels first published 'The Communist Manifesto' in 1848. Neptune also represents the day of Friday, alongside Venus.\nIn art, the impressionist movement began a trend away from literal representation, to one based on the subtle, changing moods of light and color. In medicine, Neptune is seen to be particularly associated with the thalamus, the spinal canal, and uncertain illnesses or neuroses. Neptune is considered by modern astrologers to be the primary ruler of the twelfth house.\n\nPluto () is the ruling planet of Scorpio and is exalted in Virgo. In classical Roman mythology, Pluto is the god of the underworld who is extremely wealthy. The alchemical symbol was given to Pluto on its discovery, three centuries after alchemical practices had all but disappeared. The alchemical symbol can therefore be read as spirit over mind, transcending matter. \n\nPluto takes 248 years to make a full circuit of the zodiac, but its progress is highly variable: it spends between 15 and 26 years in each sign.\n\nAstrologically speaking, Pluto is called \"the great renewer\", and is considered to represent the part of a person that destroys in order to renew, through bringing buried, but intense needs and drives to the surface, and expressing them, even at the expense of the existing order. A commonly used keyword for Pluto is \"transformation\". It is associated with power and personal mastery, and the need to cooperate and share with another, if each is not to be destroyed. Pluto governs major business and enormous wealth, mining, surgery and detective work, and any enterprise that involves digging under the surface to bring the truth to light. Pluto is also associated with Tuesday, alongside Mars.\n\nIts entry in Cancer in 1913, the sign in which it was later discovered, coincided with World War I. It is also associated with nuclear armament due to such weapons using plutonium, which was named after the dwarf planet. Nuclear research had its genesis in the 1930s and 40s and later gave rise to the polarized nuclear standoff of the Cold War, with the mass consumer societies of the United States and other democracies facing the totalitarian state of the USSR. The discovery of Pluto also occurred just after the birth of modern psychoanalysis, when Freud and Jung began to explore the depths of the unconscious.\n\nIn real life events and culture, Pluto has been a major astrological aspect. When it comes to art, movements like Cubism and Surrealism began to de-construct the \"normal\" view of the world. In medicine, Pluto is seen to be associated with regenerative forces in the body involving cell formation and the reproductive system. The majority of traditional astrologers do not use Pluto as a ruling planet, but do use the planet for interpretation and predictive work, obliquely making reference to projections of influences from higher to lower dimensional spaces. Pluto is considered by modern astrologers to be the primary native ruler of the eighth house.\n\nCeres () is the smallest identified dwarf planet in the Solar System, but is significantly the largest object in the asteroid belt. It was discovered on 1 January 1801 by Giuseppe Piazzi, and is named after Ceres, the Roman goddess of growing plants, the harvest, and of motherly love. It was the first asteroid discovered, taking up about one-third of the entire mass of its asteroid belt. The classification of Ceres has changed more than once and has been the subject of some disagreement. Johann Elert Bode believed Ceres to be the \"missing planet\" he had proposed to exist between Mars and Jupiter, at a distance of 419 million km (2.8 AU) from the Sun. Ceres was assigned a planetary symbol, and remained listed as a planet in astronomy books and tables for about half a century. The 2006 debate surrounding Pluto and what constitutes a planet led to Ceres being considered for reclassification as a planet, but in the end Ceres and Pluto were classified as the first members of the new dwarf planet category.\n\nCeres passes through the zodiac every 4 years and 7 months, passing through a little more than 2½ signs every year.\n\nIn mythology, Ceres is the Roman equivalent of the Greek goddess Demeter, and is the goddess of agriculture. The goddess (and metaphorically the planet) is also associated with the reproductive issues of an adult woman, as well as pregnancy and other major transitions in a woman's life, including the nine months of gestation time, family bonds and relationships. In old opinion, Ceres is the ruling planet of Virgo but as more knowledge about the planet's character has been revealed, majority of modern astrologers opinion, denote Ceres being the ruler for Taurus, however, Ceres is exalted in Virgo. In an updated revision, Virgo is ruled by Chiron and exalted in Sagittarius. Although a mother, Ceres is also the archetype of a virgin goddess. Ceres epitomizes independent women who are often unmarried (since, according to myth, Ceres is an unmarried goddess who chose to become a mother without a husband or partner.) While the moon represents our ideal of \"motherhood\", Ceres would represent how our real and nature motherhood should be.\nCeres, as the Goddess who has control over nature's resources and cycles, may astrologically be considered the planet of the Environment. Returning to mythology, an early environmental villain is the figure of Erysichthon, the tearer up of the earth, who cut down trees in a grove sacred to Ceres-Demeter, for which he was punished by the goddess with fearful hunger. In this sense Ceres became an emerging archetype in the awareness of recent climate change, and is entering our collective consciousness as a need to take care of our natural and irreplaceable resources in the 21st century. Ceres represents a leap towards a future of ecological responsibility and knowledge. As an indicator for environmental or community activism, Ceres would represent for some astrologers the wave of the future.\n\nSome asteroids such as Pallas () and Vesta (), as well as dwarf planet Ceres, can sometimes be seen with binoculars (Vesta even with the naked eye), but these were not recognized as planetary, and perhaps not even noticed, until the early 19th century. In the early 19th century, Ceres, Juno (), and the other two aforementioned asteroids were for a time regarded as planets. Although asteroids have been known to both astronomers and astrologers for more than 200 years, they are often ignored by astrologers. The tradition of some astrologers casting charts with minor planets originates with these asteroids. Since the discovery of Chiron () in the 1970s, some astrologers have been casting the new \"planet\", although astronomers consider it a centaur (a kind of intermediate object between comet and asteroid).\n\nIn the 21st century, several new planet-sized bodies, including Sedna, Quaoar, Haumea, and Eris, have been discovered, but not yet incorporated into mainstream astrological predictions, although some more avant-garde groups have attempted to incorporate them.\n\nThe near-earth asteroid Cruithne is thought to influence the zodiac and some personal horoscopes. \n\nSome astrologers have hypothesized about the existence of unseen or undiscovered planets. In 1918, astrologer Sepharial proposed the existence of Earth's \"Dark Moon\" Lilith, and since then, some astrologers have been using it in their charts; though the same name is also (and now, more commonly) used in astrology to refer to the axis of the actual Moon's orbit. The 20th-century German school of astrology known as Uranian astrology also claimed that many undiscovered planets existed beyond the orbit of Neptune, giving them names such as Cupido, Hades, Zeus, Kronos, Apollon, Admetos, Vulcanus, and Poseidon, and charting their supposed orbits. These orbits have not coincided, however, with more recent discoveries by astronomers of objects beyond Neptune.\n\nOther astrologers have focused on the theory that in time, all twelve signs of the zodiac will each have their own ruler, so that another two planets have yet to be discovered; namely the \"true\" rulers of Taurus and Virgo. The names of the planets mentioned in this regard by some are Vulcan (ruler of Virgo) and Apollo, the Roman god of the Sun (ruler of Taurus). Another version of this theory states that the modern planets discovered so far correspond to the elements known to the ancients—air (Uranus, god of the heavens), water (Neptune, god of the sea), and fire (Pluto, god of the underworld)—which leaves the elements earth and ether (the fifth element of the fiery upper air). In other words, it is claimed that the two planets to be discovered will be named after an earth god or goddess (such as the Horae), and after Aether, the Roman and Greek god of the upper air and stars.\n\nIn Western astrology, the symbolism associated with the planets also relates to the zodiac signs and houses of the horoscope in their various rulerships. For instance, the description of Mars is masculine, impulsive, and active. Aries is ruled by Mars and has a similar description, representing an active, masculine archetype. Similarly, the first house is also ruled by Mars, and deals with a person's physical health and strength, and the manner in which they project themselves.\n\nTable 1: Modern signs, houses and planetary associations\n\n\"Note\": The planets in the table rule the signs on the same row, and the houses do correspond with the signs on the same row (i.e. Mars rules Aries; Aries and first house share some correspondences). However, it is only modern astrology that links the planets to the houses in this order. The bulk of the tradition assigns planetary rulerships according to the ancient Chaldean astronomical order of the planets (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon; the former order of the planets in distance from Earth geocentrically):\n\nTable 2: Traditional houses and planetary relationships.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1991521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1991521", "title": "Psalm 104", "text": "Psalm 104\n\nPsalm 104 (Greek numbering: Psalm 103) is one of the psalms from the Book of Psalms of the Hebrew Bible.\nIt is notable among the psalms for describing YHWH (Elohim) explicitly as the creator deity. German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder remarked, \"It is worth studying the Hebrew language for ten years in order to read Psalm 104 in the original\".\n\nThe subject matter and its presentation is closely related both to the first Genesis creation narrative (Genesis 1, chronologically younger than the second version in Genesis 2) where likewise the waters are separated before the creation of Sun and Moon, and to older accounts of creation from the Ancient Near East, both Mesopotamian and Egyptian. In particular, the Egyptian Great Hymn to the Aten (14th century BC) is frequently cited as a predecessor. Biblical scholar Mark S. Smith has commented that \"Despite enduring support for the comparison of the two texts, enthusiasm for even indirect influence has been tempered in recent decades. In some quarters, the argument for any form of influence is simply rejected outright. Still some Egyptologists, such as Jan Assmann and Donald Redford, argue for Egyptian influence on both the Amarna correspondence (especially in EA 147) and on Psalm 104.\"\n\nOne of the longer psalms, it is traditionally divided into 35 verses. begins by describing the glory of God (\"Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment\" v. 2).\nVerse 5 asserts that God has \"laid the foundations [מכון] of the Earth\".\nVerses 6 to 13 concern the ordering of the waters, verses 14-18 vegetation and animal life, 19-24 Sun and Moon and the cycle of day and night.\nVerse 26 mentions the Leviathan (sea monster).\n\nVerses 27-30 emphasises how all creature still depend on the ongoing attention and provision by the creator, and perish if he averts his attention. \nThe concluding verses 31-35 reiterate the power and glory of YHWH, and the composer expresses his adoration, and, in the final verse, his wish that the sinners (חטא) and wicked (רשע) be \"consumed out of the earth\"). \nIn the Masoretic text, the phrase Hallelujah is placed at the end of the final verse. This is lacking in the Septuagint and the Vulgate, but it is rendered by the KJV as \"Praise ye the LORD\".\n\n\nIts main liturgical usage in the Eastern Orthodox Church is at the beginning of vespers (evening prayers) and the all-night vigil. While it is technically one of the elements of the vespers service prescribed for the senior reader (that is, the elder or abbot of a monastery, or in a parish the seniormost reader at the kliros), it is customarily read or chanted by a reader after the opening prayers of the service.\n\nThe psalm is meant to be read or chanted in a plain style at services of vespers which are not part of a vigil. When vespers is served as part of a vigil, an abbreviated musical version is usually sung by the choir. Several such musical arrangements of the psalm have been composed over the years; perhaps the most familiar is that found in the Obikhod, or common setting.\n\nIn the context of its vespers/vigil setting, this psalm is understood to be a hymn of creation, in all the fulness wherein God has created it - it speaks of animals, plants, waters, skies, etc. In the scope of the liturgical act, it is often taken to be Adam's song, sung outside the closed gates of Eden from which he has been expelled (cf. Genesis 3). While the reader chants the psalm, the priest stands outside the closed Royal Doors wearing only his epitrachilion, making this symbolism more evident.\n\nThis psalm is used during the Easter Vigil on Holy Saturday night (the Vigil being the inauguration of the fifty-day Easter season, the end of Holy Week- and by extension Lent- and the ending of the three-day Easter Triduum of Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter). In the Liturgy of the Word, the first reading is the Creation story of the Book of Genesis, and Psalm 104, which deals with the same material, is the responsorial psalm. It is used again during Pentecost, at the end of the Easter season, as the responsorial psalm for the Vigil and the Sunday Mass.\n\nBob Marley believed that cannabis use was prevalent in the Bible, reading passages such as Psalm 104 as showing approval of its usage.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56999002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56999002", "title": "Religious views of José Rizal", "text": "Religious views of José Rizal\n\nDuring his exile in Dapitan in 1892, the National Hero of the Philippines Dr. Jose Rizal, who was also a Mason, had the opportunity to engage Fr. Pastells through correspondence. They argued about many things including the concept of God.\n\nBased on the letters Dr. Rizal wrote, it can be said that his concept of God could be summarized into three (3) notions. First, he believed that God existed. Second, he believed that God was \"Plus Supra\". Lastly, he believed that God was the origin of nature; that is, nature was the expression of God.\nAs regards the first notion, Dr. Rizal made explicit that he believed that God existed. He was convinced that a supernatural power behind all of creation had to exist. He says to Fr. Pastells, \"We are entirely in accord in admitting the existence of God: how can I doubt it when I am convinced of my own existence? Who recognizes the effect recognizes the cause.\" It was clear that Dr. Rizal subscribed to the idea of \"necessary-contingent beings\" where the contingent being needed other beings for it to exist while the necessary being existed on its own. As such, the necessary being becomes the origin of contingent beings. This necessary being has been labelled by many as \"God.\"\nDr. Rizal considered himself as a contingent being that needed other beings to sustain his existence. Such other beings included the origin of all; the necessary being, God. He accepted that he was part of the whole of creation. He could not deny himself. Hence, he could not deny creation. As such, he could not deny God.\nAs regards the second notion, Dr. Rizal argued that his God was not like the God of the Catholics, as his God was far above such things. He says to Fr. Pastells, \"In the conviction that I find myself before the Supreme Problem, which confused voices desire to explain to me, I cannot but answer: 'That may be so; but the God that I surmise is much greater, much better: \"Plus Supra\"!\" He thought that a requirement to the Godliness of God was His being above all things, which meant His being incomprehensible. \nDr. Rizal was clearly not convinced that a sufficient understanding of God that was as powerful and metaphysical as the Supreme Being could be contained in the consciousness of little mortals who have no capacity to understand beyond what was in the words of Nietzsche \"divined\" to them. Mortals who were so limited could not have possibly comprehended a limitless being. As such, Dr. Rizal articulated that the only genuine faith was \"blind faith.\" In short, the more people tried to explain to him what and who God was, the more he got convinced that they did not know what they were talking about.\nWhat Dr. Rizal meant by \"blind faith\" was, since it was impossible to comprehend God as He was \"Plus Supra\", he could have only hinged his belief on the fact that \"God was God.\" As such, he did not deny nor did he accept the religious explanations of the mortals around him. Blind faith was more of a disposition of philosophy than of religion. It was a disposition where one did not accept and deny despite having a personal conviction.\nAs regards the third notion, Dr. Rizal believed that if one was to \"understand\" God, he was going to do well to note that books which others claimed were tools of revelation were not reliable. The reason was books were too removed from actual reality as these were written by people, interpreted by others, rewritten by people, obscured by others, etc. The best way to have an idea of God was through connecting with Him personally, directly and physically through His extensions. These extensions were nature.\nDr. Rizal says to Fr. Pastells, \"I believe in revelation, yes, but in that living revelation of nature which surrounds us everywhere, in that potent voice, eternal, incessant, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal like the Being from which it originates, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can reveal to us better the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom?\"\nClearly, Dr. Rizal's philosophico-religious view on God was well-reflected on. It was a product of competent ratiocination by an \"Indio\" whom the Spaniards then undermined. He did not content himself with the teachings he grew up with as a student of Catholic institutions. He explored, rationalized, and argued. He asked questions about faith and the fundamental teachings of the Church. He was however careful not to offend the religious sensibilities of his countrymen. To him, ratiocination was simply a gift from God. To not use it would thus have been offensive to the Giver.\n"}

SAT-7 was founded as a nonprofit organization in 1995 with support from Middle Eastern churches. SAT-7 is the first, oldest and largest Christian satellite organization operating in the Middle East and North Africa. Founder Terence Ascott has served as International CEO since 1995. The not-for-profit organization is governed by an international volunteer board.\n\nThe network consists of five channels: SAT-7 ARABIC, SAT-7 KIDS (Arabic language), SAT-7 PARS (Persian language), SAT-7 TÜRK (Turkish language) and SAT-7 ACADEMY (Arabic). More than 80% of programming is produced in the Middle East by Middle Easterners. A wide variety of genres are employed, including dramas, music videos, films, cartoons, game shows, teaching programs, documentaries, talk shows and current events programs.\n\nSAT-7 programming is available \"free to air\" to any viewer with access to a television and satellite connection within satellite coverage areas. Estimates indicate about 90% of households in the region have access to a television and an average of 55-60% have access to satellite. In countries such as Iraq, satellite access is approaching 90% of the population. An independent survey indicated 1 in 3 Iraqi children and 1 in 4 Saudi Arabian children watch SAT-7 KIDS. In 2017, the overall viewing audience of its channels is estimated at over 21 million.\n\nSAT-7 is financially supported by interested individuals, churches, corporations and foundations from the Middle East and North Africa and around the world. The organization's mission is advanced by four support offices: SAT-7 Canada, SAT-7 Europe, SAT-7 UK, and SAT-7 USA Rex M. Rogers. SAT-7 USA is a 501(c)3 organization at SAT-7 USA English language home page. Two additional support offices are being developed, SAT-7 South Africa and SAT-7 Brazil.\n\nSAT-7 international headquarters is located in Nicosia, Cyprus.\n\nSAT-7 ARABIC launched May 31, 1996 to provide Arab language Christian programming with blocks of programming specifically for children, youth, and women.\n\nSAT-7 KIDS launched on December 10, 2007. It aims to make Christian programming available to an entire generation of Arab children.\n\nSAT-7 PARS launched on December 18, 2006, although Persian broadcasts began on September 12, 2002 on SAT-7 ARABIC.\n\nSAT-7 has been broadcasting Turkish-language programs from its sister channel, TURK-7, for several years beginning in January 2006.\n\nIn January 2010 the Turkish ministry merged with SAT-7 to become its fourth channel – SAT-7 TÜRK.\n\nSAT-7 ACADEMY, an Arabic language education channel, was launched on September 1, 2017. It features instructional programming in Arabic, English, mathematics, and the sciences for children, parents, and teachers. SAT-7 plans to introduce additional subjects in the future.\n\nThe SAT-7 website states that \"SAT-7 has always been committed to holistic programming, with the aim of ministering to people in all areas of their life: spiritual, emotional, psychological and physical.\" Programming has included dramas promoting the rights of children and women, documentaries about microenterprise development, and game shows and music clips that have fostered a better understanding of the needs and potential of the disabled.\n\nThe SAT-7 website states that the SAT-7 Academy channel was developed out of concerns of \"losing a generation\" of Arab children who miss school due to conflict. In response, SAT-7 began on-air classroom-style programming for displaced and refugee children in the Levant.\n\nIn the decade before the Arab Spring, the UNDP report on Arab Human Development (2003 – 2009) cited three causes for what it called the severe “backwardness” in the Arab World. One of these principle causes was the widespread lack of opportunity for a good education. Not just having the chance to go to school and learning how to read, but children need to be taught to think for themselves, be equipped and encouraged to question, to be creative and to learn essential life skills.\n\nAnd, while SAT-7 is always seeking to build such ideas into our on-air programming for children, the network also wishes to address the needs and attitudes of poorly trained teachers and parents. Many have not experienced a form of education that goes beyond rote learning, where violence has been a standard way of maintaining class and home discipline and where an obsession with coming up with “the right” answers has stunted any free thought…or the concept that there might actually be no right answers to some questions.\n\nThe idea of an educational channel, with the name SAT-7 ACADEMY, is in fact much more than just the delivery of instruction modules for children and youth hungry to learn the basics of literacy and mathematics. The concept is much more holistic and concerned about the values, attitudes, and character of the next generation in the Arab World; to see Arab children grow up well and to shape a much more inclusive, creative, and democratic society.\n\n"}

Ballard was hiking on the slopes of Mount Shasta in California, and claimed Saint Germain appeared to him and began training him to be a \"Messenger\". Ballard published his experiences in a series of books. The organization's philosophies are known as the \"I AM\" Activity, and its members popularly known as \"I AM\" Students.\n\nJ. Gordon Melton studied the group and ranked it in the category \"established cult\". Also present in New Zealand, the St. Germain Foundation is considered by writer Robert S.

{"id": "80003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=80003", "title": "Satrap", "text": "Satrap\n\nSatraps () were the governors of the provinces of the ancient Median and Achaemenid Empires and in several of their successors, such as in the Sasanian Empire and the Hellenistic empires.\n\nThe word \"satrap\" is also often used metaphorically in modern literature to refer to world leaders or governors who are heavily influenced by larger world superpowers or hegemonies and act as their surrogates.\n\nThe word is derived via Latin from Greek \"satrápēs\" (), itself borrowed from an Old Iranian \"*xšaθra-pā/ă-\". In Old Persian, which was the native language of the Achaemenids, it is recorded as \"xšaçapāvan\" (, literally \"protector of the province\"). The Median form is reconstructed as \"*xšaθrapāwan-\". It is cognate with Sanskrit \"kṣatrapa\" (), \"kṣatrapati\", and kshatriya.\n\nIn the Parthian (language of the Arsacid Empire) and Middle Persian (the language of the Sassanian Empire), it is recorded in the forms \"šahrab\" and \"šasab\", respectively.\n\nIn modern Persian the descendant of \"xšaθrapāvan\" is \"shahrbān\" (), but the components have undergone semantic shift so the word now means \"town keeper\" (\"shahr\" [] meaning \"town\" + \"bān\" [] meaning \"keeper\").\n\nAlthough the first large-scale use of satrapies, or provinces, originates from the inception of the Achaemenid Empire under Cyrus the Great, beginning at around 530BCE, provincial organization actually originated during the Median era from at least 648BCE.\n\nUp to the time of the conquest of Media by Cyrus the Great, emperors ruled the lands they conquered through client kings and governors. The main difference was that in Persian culture the concept of kingship was indivisible from divinity: divine authority validated the divine right of kings. The twenty-six satraps established by Cyrus were never kings, but viceroys ruling in the king's name, although in political reality many took advantage of any opportunity to carve themselves an independent power base. Darius the Great gave the satrapies a definitive organization, increased their number to thirty-six, and fixed their annual tribute (Behistun inscription).\nThe satrap was in charge of the land that he owned as an administrator, and found himself surrounded by an all-but-royal court; he collected the taxes, controlled the local officials and the subject tribes and cities, and was the supreme judge of the province before whose \"chair\" (\"Nehemiah\"3:7) every civil and criminal case could be brought. He was responsible for the safety of the roads (cf.Xenophon), and had to put down brigands and rebels.\n\nHe was assisted by a council of Persians, to which also provincials were admitted and which was controlled by a royal secretary and emissaries of the king, especially the \"eye of the king\", who made an annual inspection and exercised permanent control.\nThere were further checks on the power of each satrap: besides his secretarial scribe, his chief financial official (Old Persian \"ganzabara\") and the general in charge of the regular army of his province and of the fortresses were independent of him and periodically ported directly to the \"shah\", in person. The satrap was allowed to have troops in his own service.\n\nThe great satrapies (provinces) were often divided into smaller districts, the governors of which were also called satraps and (by Greco-Roman authors) also called \"hyparchs\" (actually \"Hyparkhos\" in Greek, 'vice-regents'). The distribution of the great satrapies was changed repeatedly, and often two of them were given to the same man.\nAs the provinces were the result of consecutive conquests (the homeland had a special status, exempt from provincial tribute), both primary and sub-satrapies were often defined by former states and/or ethno-religious identity. One of the keys to the Achaemenid success (as with most enduring great empires) was their open attitude to the culture and religion of the conquered people, so the Persian culture was the one most affected as the Great King endeavoured to meld elements from all his subjects into a new imperial style, especially at his capital, Persepolis.\nWhenever central authority in the empire weakened, the satrap often enjoyed practical independence, especially as it became customary to appoint him also as general-in-chief of the army district, contrary to the original rule. \"When his office became hereditary, the threat to the central authority could not be ignored\" (Olmstead). Rebellions of satraps became frequent from the middle of the 5thcentury BCE. Darius I struggled with widespread rebellions in the satrapies, and under Artaxerxes II occasionally the greater parts of Asia Minor and Syria were in open rebellion (Revolt of the Satraps).\n\nThe last great rebellions were put down by Artaxerxes III.\n\nThe satrapic administration and title were retained—even for Greco-Macedonian incumbents—by Alexander the Great, who conquered the Achaemenid Empire, and by his successors, the Diadochi (and their dynasties) who carved it up, especially in the Seleucid Empire, where the satrap generally was designated as \"strategos\"; but their provinces were much smaller than under the Persians. They would ultimately be replaced by conquering empires, especially the Parthians.\n\nIn the Parthian Empire, the king's power rested on the support of noble families who ruled large estates, and supplied soldiers and tribute to the king. City-states within the empire enjoyed a degree of self-government, and paid tribute to the king. Administration of the Sassanid Empire was considerably more centralized than that of the Parthian Empire; the semi-independent kingdoms and self-governing city states of the Parthian Empire were replaced with a system of \"royal cities\" which served as the seats of centrally appointed governors called \"shahrabs\" as well as the location of military garrisons. \"Shahrabs\" ruled both the city and the surrounding rural districts. Exceptionally, the Byzantine Empire also adopted the title \"satrap\" for the semi-autonomous princes that governed one of its Armenian provinces, the \"Satrapiae\".\n\nThe Western Satraps or Kshatrapas (35–405 CE) were Saka rulers in the western and central part of the Sindh region of Pakistan, and the Saurashtra and Malwa regions of western India. They were contemporaneous with the Kushans who ruled the northern part of the subcontinent from the area of Peshawar and were possibly their overlords, and with the Satavahana (Andhra) who ruled in central India to their south and east and the Kushan state to their immediate west.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1632955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1632955", "title": "Tae eul ju", "text": "Tae eul ju\n\nTae Eul Ju is a sacred mantra used throughout the world by practitioners of Jeung San Do. This mantra consists of twenty-three holy sounds. Jeung San Sangjenim, on whose teachings and spiritual work Jeung San Do is based, shared a meditative and spiritual practice aimed at transforming ourselves and society.\n\nThe cornerstone of this practice is Tae Eul Mantra (太乙呪) meditation. Chanting the Tae Eul Mantra (Tae-eul-ju) allows the practitioner to tap into the healing and enlightening energy coming from the life-giving womb of the universe, awakens the practitioner to the spirit world and attracts protective energy and spirits that can protect the practitioner from misfortune.\n\nA mantra is a series of sacred sounds. Any mantra chanted with proper breathing, posture of body and mind, and a degree of faith in both the mantra and one's own ability will produce positive effects. Each mantra has its own purpose and power. Some mantras can be translated into simple words, but invariably the deeper meaning can only be understood through regular practice.\n\nThe sacred sounds of the Tae Eul Mantra are:\n\nAhn Gyung-jun, the \"sabunim\" of Jeung San Do, explains some of the sounds of the mantra as follows:\n\nAccording to Buddhism, \"hum (hoom)\" is \"The mind of the Buddha.\" Hum (hoom) is the mind of all enlightened beings. When you are immersed in the peaceful hum (hoom) sound, you can attain Buddha-mind.\n\nIn Sanskrit, \"chi (chee)\" means \"To become one with all brilliant spirits existing in the whole universe.\" Sangjenim was the first to join the sounds hum (hoom) and chi (chee) together. Once they were joined, a new more fantastic meaning took shape. Sangjenim said, \"Hum (Hoom) Chi (Chee) is the sound calling the parents of all things in heaven and earth.\"\n\nWhenever you chant Hum (Hoom) - chi (chee) - hum (hoom) - chi (chee), you should chant with the mind of calling out to your original parents. Some people mistakenly chant it with a sad and depressing voice, as if crying, causing such sad and depressive energy to respond. You should call out to your parents with bright energy.\n\nThe next part of Tae-eul-ju is Tae-eul-cheon-sang-wun-gun. Tae-eul-cheon means \"Tae-eul Heaven.\" All the mysteries in the universe are contained in these three syllables. \"Tae\" means \"ultimate.\" \"Eul\" signifies the womb of the universe, which gives birth to all things including humanity. Tae Eul Cheon is the ultimate place from which all humans are born. \"Sang\" means \"heavenly\" or \"supreme.\" \"Wun\" means \"fundamental\" or \"ultimate.\" \"Gun\" (pronounce \"Goon\") means \"king.\" Sang Wun Gun is the entity in charge of Tae Eul Heaven, the place in the universe from which life-giving energy comes. What does sa-pa-ha, the last three syllables, mean? It is a beautiful prayer asking that all of our wishes and desires be fulfilled.\n\nWhenever Jeung San Do practitioners do Tae Eul Ju meditation, there are three steps before meditation, offering, bowing and prayer. After above three steps, they start to meditate. During meditation, your body should be relaxed with good posture and set your focal point and breathe from the lower abdomen.\n\nTo get the optimal spiritual experience from meditation, prepare a bowl of water and perform four bows and a prayer. The bowl of water symbolizes the purification of body, mind, and spirit and is an offering of life essence (jeong : 精) to the spirits. Sangjenim taught that when we meditate we should direct our gaze upon the bowl of water with our \"inner eyes open and outer eyes closed.\" By bowing we show respect to Sangjenim, Taemonim, and other spirits as we unite our human virtue with the virtue of heaven and earth. By doing a personal prayer before meditation, we can reflect upon and ask forgiveness for shortcomings and express intentions to heaven and earth. Personal prayer is a time of self-reflection and clearing the mind.\n\nIt does not have to be a lotus posture and relaxing posture is the most important. Kneeling or sitting cross-legged, keep your back straight (most important), your chin slightly tucked in, and your shoulders slightly back. If your legs get tired, change from a kneeling to sitting position or vice versa, but try to keep your back straight while doing so. The spine is the main channel for the flow of qi within the body, and is a conduit for receiving the \"qi\" of heaven and earth. If the back is crooked, this \"qi\" does not flow well. Also, because the body and mind are one, there is a direct relationship between mental and physical posture. If you find that your mind is wandering during meditation, check your posture. When the back is not straight, the mind tends to lose focus.\n\nDifferent schools of meditation advocate various focal points. In Jeung San Do it is recommended that you direct your consciousness inward toward the lower \"danjeon\" (dantien), a central energy point located below the navel. While doing this imagine the sound of the mantra permeating your entire body.\n\nBreathe from the lower abdomen. As you exhale, the lower abdomen goes in; as you inhale the lower abdomen goes out. This breathing technique is almost the same throughout all different meditations with few exceptions. It is important to do this in a natural way, not tensing or forcing the stomach muscles. Before long, you will feel any stress-related tension in your chest fall away as the fire energy descends and the water energy rises. This process is called \"suseunghwagang\" (水昇火降).\n\nThere are three basic methods of chanting: chanting aloud with a resonating voice, chanting softly such that only you can hear, and chanting silently within your mind. Chanting aloud is the most effective way to experience the vibration of the mantra's sound, but it may be necessary to practice soft or silent chanting when the sound may disturb those around you. In daily practice you can use all three methods.\n\nWhile chanting, keep your mind positive and sound bright. Your mindset and the manner in which you chant determine the kind of energy and spirit that responds to you. \"Taesabunim\" (Supreme Dao Master) teaches that when meditating, \"Do not think of goodness. Do not think of badness.\" This is the nondiscriminating mind that allows a practitioner to become one with the universe. Do not think of yourself as good or bad, do not think of others as good or bad, do not think of any phenomena as good or bad. Just be natural.\n\nAnytime is a good time to meditate, but the best times for meditation are in the early morning and late evening. In the morning, you receive the activating yang energy of a new day, and in the evening, you receive the yin energy that allows for perfect rest. To carry the peacefulness and energy of meditation in to the entire day, continuously chant in your mind while doing any of your daily activities. While you are walking, driving, eating, relaxing, etc.\n\nJeung San Do's meditation combines the chanting style of Buddhism with the inner alchemy of Taoism. When meditators immerse themselves in the peaceful sound of mantra, they feel a sense of oneness with the universe. Through the internal process of circulating the fire and water energies, the practitioner improves the condition of the body and cultivates spirit.\n\nTae Eul Ju has four different powers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Tas-Silġ is a multi-period sanctuary site covering all eras from Neolithic to the fourth century AD, and due to this it indicates to archaeologists several different layers of excavation. The site takes its name from the nearby Church of Our Lady of the Snows (Maltese: \"Knisja tal-Madonna tas-Silġ\").\n\nThe area was first inhabited when a temple was built in the Tarxien phase of Maltese prehistory, sometime around 3000 to 2500 BC. Few remains from the original temple can be seen, but the scatter of megaliths over the hill suggests that there was a large complex with at least 3 temples and possibly a village surrounding it. A D-shaped setting of large blocks that was part of the four-apsed temple still exists as it was later incorporated into the other buildings on the site. In the Bronze Age, the temple was probably converted into a settlement, as had been done in other sites such as Borġ in-Nadur.\n\nIn the deepest layer of deposits, archaeologists found various artifacts including pottery, lithics, and a standing \"fat lady\". From the Bronze Age layer, some sherds, stone tools and pottery were found. Other evidence from the Bronze Age consists of the large amount of handiwork.\n\nAfter the Phoenicians took over Malta in around 700 BC, they built a Punic temple to Astarte incorporating upstanding remains of the earlier temple. A forward extension was added to the curved facade, and a monumental doorway flanked with two pilasters and topped by a huge stone slab was built. The sanctuary's importance eventually grew and a portico was added around 300 BC. Some parts of the temple, including a tower, might have been designed as a fortification to help defend it from possible invaders.\n\nA threshold slab pierced by three libation holes that divided the eastern part of the temple and the western side, as well as a series of ashlar foundation walls for a platform built to the south of the main sanctuary still exist. Around this area, various remains were found including pottery, ash, animal bones, coins and shreds. Some of these shreds have votive inscriptions. It is claimed that the Cippi of Melqart might have originally been at the Tas-Silġ temple, but their origin is disputed.\n\nIn the Roman era, the Punic temple was converted into a sanctuary of Juno, which was the Roman equivalent to Astarte. In 70 BC, Cicero mentioned the temple in his \"In Verrem\", in which he said that the temple was revered by everyone including pirates and Numidian princes, but the Roman Governor of Sicily had stolen some of its treasures. Some Roman material was discovered in various deposits around a well in the lower terrace of Tas-Silġ.\n\nLarge water storage areas under Tas-Silġ were recently found and mapped, and they probably date to the Punic or Roman eras.\n\nLater on, in the 4th or 5th centuries AD, a Byzantine monastery were built over the remains of the previous temples. The church had a central nave separated from the aisles by two rows of columns, and a small baptismal font was constructed in what was originally the megalithic temple. Some remains of sculpture were found, including a worn female marble head and an ivory capital with a hanging palmette. Pottery from this period was also found, including amphorae and locally made plates and other items.\n\nDuring the Byzantine period, it may be that the \"fat lady\" was deliberately defaced and buried in a hollow.\n\nIn the 8th century, defensive walls were hastily built around the monastery at Tas-Silġ.\n\nThe monastery was abandoned soon after the Arabs occupied Malta in 870 AD. The site was turned into a quarry and stones from the original structure were removed. In the medieval period farms were built on the area, and rubble walls from this era still exist. The whole site was buried under a metre of soil before being excavated.\n\nIn the 17th century writers began to speculate the location of Juno's temple that was referred to in ancient texts, however the site was only discovered in the 20th century. It was included on the Antiquities List of 1925.\n\nA remain of a column from the temple at tas-Silg, built in the Phoenician period, is today found at the 17th-century Palazzo Marnisi in Marsaxlokk.\n\nAn Italian Mission led the first excavations in between 1963 and 1972 and identified the sanctuary. From 1996 to 2005 the University of Malta and an Italian team started another excavation project to clean other layers of sediments. The site is shielded by a cover to protect it from further erosion.\n\nHeritage Malta runs the conservation of Tas-Silġ but has unfortunately been closed to public up to now, although it may be visited by appointment. Despite this, efforts to conserve the site so one day it will be open to the public began to be made as of September 2013.\n\n"}

{"id": "5372549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5372549", "title": "Third Buddhist council", "text": "Third Buddhist council\n\nThe Third Buddhist council was convened in about 250 BCE at Asokarama in Pataliputra, supposedly under the patronage of Emperor Ashoka. This is however disputed, as mention of the council never appears in the Edicts of Ashoka.\n\nThe traditional reason for convening the Third Buddhist Council is reported to have been to rid the Sangha of corruption and bogus monks who held heretical views. It was presided over by the elder monk Moggaliputta-Tissa and one thousand monks participated in the Council. The council is recognized and known to both the Theravada and Mahayana schools, though its importance is central only to the Theravada.\n\nThe account of the background to the Third Council is as follows: Emperor Ashoka was crowned in the two hundred and eighteenth year after the Buddha's parinibbāna. At first he paid only token homage to the Dhamma and the Sangha and also supported members of other religious sects as his father had done before him. However, all this changed when he met the pious novice-monk Nigrodha who preached him Appamada-vagga verses from the Dhammapada. Thereafter he ceased supporting other religious groups and his interest in and devotion to the Dhamma deepened. He used his enormous wealth to build, it is said, eighty-four thousand pagodas and viharas and to lavishly support the bhikkhus (monks) with the four requisites. His son Mahinda and his daughter Sanghamitta were ordained and admitted to the Sangha.\n\nEventually, his generosity was to cause serious problems within the Sangha. In time the order was infiltrated by many unworthy men, holding heretical views and who were attracted to the order because of the Emperor's generous support and costly offerings of food, clothing, shelter and medicine. Large numbers of faithless, greedy men espousing wrong views tried to join the order but were deemed unfit for ordination.\nDespite this they seized the chance to exploit the Emperor's generosity for their own ends and donned robes and joined the order without having been ordained properly. Consequently, respect for the Sangha diminished. When this came to light some of the genuine monks refused to hold the prescribed purification or Uposatha ceremony in the company of the corrupt, heretical monks.\n\nWhen the Emperor heard about this he sought to rectify the situation and dispatched one of his ministers to the monks with the command that they perform the ceremony. However, the Emperor had given the minister no specific orders as to what means were to be used to carry out his command. The monks refused to obey and hold the ceremony in the company of their false and 'thieving' companions (Pali: \"theyya-sinivāsaka\").\n\nIn desperation the angry minister advanced down the line of seated monks and drawing his sword, beheaded all of them one after the other until he came to the King's brother, Tissa who had been ordained. The horrified minister stopped the slaughter and fled the hall and reported back to the Emperor. Asoka was deeply grieved and upset by what had happened and blamed himself for the killings. He sought Thera Moggaliputta Tissa's counsel. He proposed that the heretical monks be expelled from the order and a third Council be convened immediately.\n\nSo it was that in the seventeenth year of the Emperor's reign the Third Council was called. Thera Moggaliputta Tissa headed the proceedings and chose one thousand monks from the sixty thousand participants for the traditional recitation of the Dhamma and the Vinaya, which went on for nine months. The Emperor himself questioned monks from a number of monasteries about the teachings of the Buddha. Those who held wrong views were exposed and expelled from the Sangha immediately. In this way the Bhikkhu Sangha was purged of heretics and bogus bhikkhus.\n\nAccording to the Pali and Chinese accounts, the Elder Moggaliputta Tissa, in order to refute a number of heresies and ensure the Dhamma was kept pure, compiled a book during the council called the Kathavatthu. This book consists of twenty-three chapters, and is a collection of discussions on the points of controversy. It gives refutations of the 'heretical' views held by various Buddhist sects on matters philosophical. The Kathavatthu is the fifth of the seven books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka. However, the historicity of this has been questioned, as the account preserved in the San Jian Lu Pi Po Sho (Sudassanavinayavibhasha), although otherwise almost identical, does not mention the Kathavatthu.\n\nMoggaliputtatissa told Ashoka that the doctrine taught by the Buddha was the Vibhajjavada, the Doctrine of Analysis. This term is used in various senses, and it is not clear exactly what it meant in this context. Traditionally, however, the Sri Lankan Theravadins and other mainland schools of Early Buddhism identified themselves as Vibhajjavada.\n\n\"see also Greco-Buddhist monasticism\"\nOne of the most significant achievements ascribed by Theravada tradition to this Dhamma assembly and one which was to bear fruit for centuries to come, was the Emperor's sending forth of monks, well versed in the Buddha's Dhamma and Vinaya who could recite all of it by heart, to teach it in nine different countries. According to the Mahavamsa (XII, 1st paragraph), he sent the following missionaries:\n\nThe Dhamma missions to Sri Lanka and Kashmir and Gandhara were very successful, leading to a long-term presence and dominance of Buddhism in those areas. \n\nIt is not clear exactly how influential the interactions to Egypt and Greece may have been, but some authors have commented that some level of syncretism between Hellenist thought and Buddhism may have started in Hellenic lands at that time. They have pointed to the presence of Buddhist communities in the Hellenistic world around that period, in particular in Alexandria (mentioned by Clement of Alexandria), and to the pre-Christian monastic order of the Therapeutae (possibly a deformation of the Pali word \"Theravada\"), who may have \"almost entirely drawn (its) inspiration from the teaching and practices of Buddhist asceticism\" (Robert Linssen).\n\nPossibly Buddhist gravestones from the Ptolemaic period have also been found in Alexandria, decorated with what may be depictions of the Dharma wheel (W. W. Tarn, \"The Greeks in Bactria and India\"). Commenting on the presence of Buddhists in Alexandria, some scholars have even pointed out that “It was later in this very place that some of the most active centers of Christianity were established” (Robert Linssen \"Zen living\").\n\nIn the 2nd century CE, the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria recognized Bactrian Buddhists (Sramanas) and Indian Gymnosophists for their influence on Greek thought:\n\n\n"}

A barrister by profession, he worked to defend the rights of Jains, and wrote and lectured extensively on Jainism, other religions, and philosophy.\n\nGandhi was born on 25 August 1864 in Mahuva near Bhavnagar (now in Gujarat, India), to Mahuva Nagar Sheth and Raghavji Tejpalji Gandhi. His father, Raghavji, was a businessman. After completing primary and secondary school in Mahuva, Gandhi was sent to Bhavnagar for further studies. In 1879, Gandhi married Jiviben. At the age of sixteen, upon placing first on the Bhavanagar matriculation examination, he was awarded the ‘Shri Jaswant Singhji’ scholarship. Gandhi continued his education at Elphinstone College, of the University of Bombay. He graduated with honors in 1884, having earned a bachelor's degree in law. Gandhi was a polyglot who spoke fourteen languages, including Gujarati, Hindi, Bengali, English, Prakrit, Sanskrit, and French. Gandhi was a friend of Mahatma Gandhi, and joined Mahatma in his \"experiments in dietetics\" (vegetarianism). Virchand helped Mahatma in the latter's struggle to establish a legal practice.\n\nIn 1885, at the age of 21, he became the first honorary secretary of the Jain Association of India. During his term, he fought against a tax being levied by the ruler of Princely State of Palitana on pilgrims visiting Mount Shatrunjaya, Palitana. During the course of this fight Gandhi met Lord Reay, the British colonial governor of Bombay, and Colonel John Watson of the Kathiawar Agency. With the help of these two individuals, he ultimately negotiated an annual fixed payment of Rs. 15000, rather than an individual tax on each pilgrim. Gandhi also fought to close a pig slaughterhouse that had been started in 1891 close to Mount Shikharji, a holy place of Jain pilgrimage. Gandhi spent six months in Calcutta learning Bengali and preparing his case against the slaughterhouse. He was eventually successful in getting the slaughterhouse closed.\n\nGandhi represented Jainism at the first World Parliament of Religions, held in Chicago in 1893.\nJain monk Acharya Vijayanandsuri, also known as Acharya Atmaram, had initially been invited to represent Jainism at the Parliament, but as Jain monks do not travel overseas, he could not attend. Atmaram recommended Gandhi to go in his stead and serve as the emissary for the religion. Atmaram and his disciple Vallabhsuri trained Gandhi for six months.\nGandhi received a positive response at the Parliament and was asked to deliver more lectures. He ultimately stayed two years in the US and one year in the UK He went outside India to promote Jain values on two other occasions, and is known for giving about 535 lectures on Jainism and having attracted followers from outside India to Jainism. He was awarded various medals for his lectures.\n\nHe was a contemporary to Swami Vivekanand, who deeply admired him. He faced criticism over his sea voyage, which was at the time considered unholy. Vivekanand, impressed with Gandhi's adherence to vegetarianism in the face of the cold Chicago climate, came to his defence: in an 1894 letter to Haridas Viharidas Desai, Diwan of Junagadh, he wrote \"Now here is Virchand Gandhi, the Jain whom you knew well in Bombay. This man never takes anything but mere vegetables even in this terribly cold climate and tooth and nail tries to defend his countrymen and the religion. The people of this country like him very well. But what are they doing who sent him over? They are trying to outcast him.”\n\nHerbert Warren, who studied Jainism under Gandhi and adopted the Jain religion, published a book on Gandhi's lectures titled \"Herbert Warren's Jainism\".\n\nThe American newspaper, the \"Buffalo Courier\", wrote regarding Gandhi, \"of all Eastern scholars, it was this youth whose lectures on Jain Faith and Conduct was listened to with the greatest interest and attention\". Later, in Kasadova, he delivered a lecture on 'Some Mistakes Corrected' on 8 August 1894, which prompted the citizens of the city to award him a gold medal.\n\nGandhi had studied Buddhism, Vedanta Philosophy, Christianity, and western philosophy. He praised Mogul Emperor Akbar for his equal treatment of all religions.\n\nGandhi propagated the relevance of Jain tenets and Mahavira's message of nonviolence. He delivered about 535 speeches on Jainism, other religions, and social and cultural lives in India, all of which received wide publication. He was invited two more times, first in 1897, and then in 1899 to the West.\n\nGandhi founded Gandhi Philosophical Society and the Society for the Education of Women in India (SEWI). He participated in Pune session of Indian National Congress in 1895 as a representative of Bombay state, and lectured on Indian politics and industry in Large Hall of William Science building on 19 December 1898. He also participated at the International Conference of Commerce in 1899 and represented Asia. He settled tax disputes of Palitana and Shikharji piggery case.\n\nGandhi died at the age of thirty-seven of haemorrhaging of the lungs on 7 August 1901 at Mahuwar, near Mumbai, India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Western Chalukyan political influence was at its peak in the Deccan Plateau during this period. The centre of cultural and temple-building activity lay in the Tungabhadra region, where large medieval workshops built numerous monuments. These monuments, regional variants of pre-existing dravida (South Indian) temples, form a climax to the wider regional temple architecture tradition called Vesara or \"Karnata dravida\". Temples of all sizes built by the Chalukyan architects during this era remain today as examples of the architectural style.\n\nMost notable of the many buildings dating from this period are the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi in the Koppal district, the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi in the Gadag district, the Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti in the Bellary district and the Kallesvara Temple at Bagali in the Davangere district. Other monuments notable for their craftsmanship include the Kaitabheshvara Temple in Kubatur and Kedareshvara Temple in Balligavi, both in the Shimoga district, the Siddhesvara Temple at Haveri in the Haveri district, the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri in the Dharwad district, the Sarasvati Temple in Gadag, and the Dodda Basappa Temple at Dambal, both in the Gadag district.\n\nThe surviving Western Chalukya monuments are temples built in the Shaiva, Vaishnava, and Jain religious traditions. None of the military, civil, or courtly architecture has survived; being built of mud, brick and wood, such structures may not have withstood repeated invasions.\nThe centre of these architectural developments was the region encompassing the present-day Dharwad district; it included areas of present-day Haveri and Gadag districts. In these districts, about fifty monuments have survived as evidence of the widespread temple building of the Western Chalukyan workshops. The influence of this style extended beyond the Kalyani region in the northeast to the Bellary region in the east and to the Mysore region in the south. In the Bijapur–Belgaum region to the north, the style was mixed with that of the \"Hemadpanti\" temples. Although a few Western Chalukyan temples can be found in the Konkan region, the presence of the Western Ghats probably prevented the style from spreading westwards.\n\nThough the basic plan of the Western Chalukya style originated from the older \"dravida style\", many of its features were unique and peculiar to it. One of these distinguishing features of the Western Chalukyan architectural style was an articulation that can still be found throughout modern Karnataka. The only exceptions to this motif can be found in the area around Kalyani, where the temples exhibit a \"nagara\" (North Indian) articulation which has its own unique character.\n\nIn contrast to the buildings of the early Badami Chalukyas, whose monuments were clustered around the metropoleis of Pattadakal, Aihole, and Badami, these Western Chalukya temples are widely dispersed, reflecting a system of local government and decentralisation. The Western Chalukya temples were smaller than those of the early Chalukyas, a fact discernible in the reduced height of the superstructures which tower over the shrines.\n\nThe Western Chalukya art evolved in two phases, the first lasting approximately a quarter of a century and the second from the beginning of 11th century until the end of Western Chalukya rule in 1186 CE. During the first phase, temples were built in the Aihole-Banashankari-Mahakuta region (situated in the early Chalukya heartland) and Ron in the Gadag district. A few provisional workshops built them in Sirval in the Gulbarga district and Gokak in the Belgaum district. The structures at Ron bear similarities to the Rashtrakuta temples in Kuknur in the Koppal district and Mudhol in the Bijapur district, evidence that the same workshops continued their activity under the new Karnata dynasty. The mature and latter phase reached its peak at Lakkundi (Lokigundi), a principal seat of the imperial court. From the mid-11th century, the artisans from the Lakkundi school moved south of the Tungabhadra River. Thus the influence of the Lakkundi school can be seen in some of the temples of the Davangere district, and in the temples at Hirehadagalli and Huvinahadgalli in the Bellary district.\n\nInfluences of Western Chalukya architecture can be discerned in the geographically distant schools of architecture of the Hoysala Empire in southern Karnataka, and the Kakatiya dynasty in present-day Andhra Pradesh. Sometimes called the \"Gadag style\" of architecture, Western Chalukya architecture is considered a precursor to the Hoysala architecture of southern Karnataka. This influence occurred because the early builders employed by the Hoysalas came from pronounced centres of medieval Chalukya art. Further monuments in this style were built not only by the Western Chalukya kings but, also by their feudal vassals.\n\nA typical Western Chalukya temple may be examined from three aspects – the basic floor plan, the architectural articulation, and the figure sculptures.\n\nThe basic floor plan is defined by the size of the shrine, the size of the sanctum, the distribution of the building mass, and by the \"pradakshina\" (path for circumambulation), if there is one.\n\nArchitectural articulation refers to the ornamental components that give shape to the outer wall of the shrine. These include projections, recesses, and representations that can produce a variety of patterns and outlines, either stepped, stellate (star-shaped), or square. If stepped (also called \"stepped diamond of projecting corners\"), these components form five or seven projections on each side of the shrine, where all but the central one are projecting corners (projections with two full faces created by two recesses, left and right, that are at right angles with each other). If square (also called \"square with simple projections\"), these components form three or five projections on a side, only two of which are projecting corners. Stellate patterns form star points which are normally 8-, 16-, or 32-pointed and are sub-divided into interrupted and uninterrupted stellate components. In an 'interrupted' stellate plan, the stellate outline is interrupted by orthogonal (right-angle) projections in the cardinal directions, resulting in star points that have been skipped. Two basic kinds of architectural articulation are found in Indian architecture: the southern Indian \"dravida\" and the northern Indian \"nagara\".\n\nFigure sculptures are miniature representations that stand by themselves, including architectural components on pilasters, buildings, sculptures, and complete towers. They are generally categorised as \"figure sculpture\" or \"other decorative features\". On occasion, rich figure sculpture can obscure the articulation of a shrine, when representations of gods, goddesses, and mythical figures are in abundance.\n\nChalukyan temples fall into two categories – the first being temples with a common \"mantapa\" (a colonnaded hall) and two shrines (known as \"dvikuta\"), and the second being temples with one \"mantapa\" and a single shrine (\"ekakuta\"). Both kinds of temples have two or more entrances giving access to the main hall. This format differs from both the designs of the northern Indian temples, which have a small closed \"mantapa\" leading to the shrine and the southern Indian temples which generally have a large, open, columned \"mantapa\".\n\nThe Chalukyan architects retained features from both northern and southern styles. However, in the overall arrangement of the main temple and of the subsidiary shrines, they inclined towards the northern style and tended to build one main shrine with four minor shrines, making the structure a \"panchayatna\" or five-shrined complex. Chalukyan temples were, almost always, built facing the east.\n\nThe Sanctum (cella) is connected by a vestibule (\"ardha mantapa\" or ante-chamber) to the closed \"mantapa\" (also called the \"navaranga\"), which is connected to the open \"mantapa\". Occasionally there can be two or more open \"mantapas\". In Shaiva temples, directly opposite the sanctum and opposite the closed \"mantapa\" is the \"nandi mantapa\", which enshrines a large image of Nandi, the bull attendant of Shiva. The shrine usually has no \"pradakshina\".\n\nThe pillars that support the roof of the \"mantapa\" are monolithic shafts from the base up to the neck of the capital. Therefore, the height of the \"mantapa\" and the overall size of the temple were limited by the length of the stone shafts that the architects were able to obtain from the quarries. The height of the temple was also constrained by the weight of the superstructure on the walls and, since Chalukyan architects did not use mortar, by the use of dry masonry and bonding stones without clamps or cementing material.\n\nThe absence of mortar allows some ventilation in the innermost parts of the temple through the porous masonry used in the walls and ceilings. The modest amount of light entering the temples comes into the open halls from all directions, while the very subdued illumination in the inner closed \"mantapa\" comes only through its open doorway. The vestibule receives even less light, making it necessary to have some form of artificial lighting (usually, oil lamps) even during the day. This artificial source of light perhaps adds \"mystery\" to the image of the deity worshipped in the sanctum.\n\nFrom the 11th century, newly incorporated features were either based on the traditional \"dravida\" plan of the Badami Chalukyas, as found in the Virupaksha and Mallikarjuna Temples at Pattadakal, or were further elaborations of this articulation. The new features produced a closer juxtaposition of architectural components, visible as a more crowded decoration, as can be seen in the Mallikarjuna Temple at Sudi in the Gadag district and the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri in the Dharwad district.\n\nThe architects in the Karnataka region seem to have been inspired by architectural developments in northern India. This is evidenced by the fact that they incorporated decorative miniature towers (multi-aedicular towers depicting superstructures) of the \"Sekhari\" and \"Bhumija\" types, supported on pilasters, almost simultaneously with these developments in the temples in northern India. The miniature towers represented shrines, which in turn represented deities. Sculptural depictions of deities were generally discreet although not uncommon. Other northern ideas they incorporated were the pillar bodies that appeared as wall projections. Well-known constructions incorporating these features are found at the Kasivisvesvara Temple and the Nannesvara Temple, both at Lakkundi.\n\nIn the 11th century, temple projects began employing soapstone, a form of greenish or blueish black stone, although temples such as the Mallikarjuna Temple at Sudi, the Kallesvara Temple at Kuknur, and the temples at Konnur and Savadi were built with the formerly traditional sandstone in the \"dravida\" articulation.\n\nSoapstone is found in abundance in the regions of Haveri, Savanur, Byadgi, Motebennur and Hangal. The great archaic sandstone building blocks used by the Badami Chalukyas were superseded with smaller blocks of soapstone and with smaller masonry. The first temple to be built from this material was the Amrtesvara Temple in Annigeri in the Dharwad district in 1050 CE. This building was to be the prototype for later, more articulated structures such as the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi.\n\nSoapstone was also used for carving, modelling and chiselling of components that could be described as \"chubby\". However, the finish of the architectural components compared to the earlier sandstone temples is much finer, resulting in opulent shapes and creamy decorations. Stepped wells are another feature that some of the temples included.\n\nThe 11-century temple-building boom continued in the 12th century with the addition of new features. The Mahadeva Temple at Itagi and the Siddhesvara Temple in Haveri are standard constructions incorporating these developments. Based on the general plan of the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri, the Mahadeva Temple was built in 1112 CE and has the same architectural components as its predecessor. There are however differences in their articulation; the \"sala\" roof (roof under the finial of the superstructure) and the miniature towers on pilasters are chiseled instead of moulded. The difference between the two temples, built fifty years apart, is the more rigid modelling and decoration found in many components of the Mahadeva Temple. The voluptuous carvings of the 11th century were replaced with a more severe chiselling.\n\nAs developments progressed, the Chalukyan builders modified the pure \"dravida\" tower by reducing the height of each stepped storey and multiplying their number. From base to top, the succeeding storeys get smaller in circumference and the topmost storey is capped with a crown holding the \"kalasa\", a finial in the shape of a decorative water pot. Each storey is so richly decorated that the original \"dravida\" character becomes almost invisible. In the \"nagara\" tower the architects modified the central panels and niches on each storey, forming a more-or-less continuous vertical band and simulating the vertical bands up the centre of each face of the typical northern style tower. Old and new architectural components were juxtaposed but introduced separately. Some superstructures are essentially a combination of southern \"dravida\" and northern \"nagara\" structures and is termed \"Vesara Shikhara\" (also called Kadamba Shikhara).\n\nThe characteristically northern stepped-diamond plan of projecting corners was adopted in temples built with an entirely \"dravida\" articulation. Four 12th century structures constructed according to this plan are extant: the Basaveshwara Temple at Basavana Bagevadi, the Ramesvara Temple at Devur and the temples at Ingleshwar and Yevur, all in the vicinity of the Kalyani region, where \"nagara\" temples were common. This plan came into existence in northern India only in the 11th century, a sign that architectural ideas traveled fast.\n\nA major development of this period was the appearance of stellate (star-shaped) shrines in a few temples built of the traditional sandstone, such as the Trimurti Temple at Savadi, the Paramesvara Temple at Konnur and the Gauramma Temple at Hire Singgangutti. In all three cases, the shrine is a 16-pointed uninterrupted star, a ground-plan not found anywhere else in India and which entirely differentiates these temples from the 32-pointed interrupted star plans of \"bhumija\" shrines in northern India.\n\nThe stellate plan found popularity in the soapstone constructions such as the Doddabasappa Temple at Dambal as well. Contemporary stellate plans in northern India were all 32-pointed interrupted types. No temples of the 6-, 12-, or 24-pointed stellate plans are known to exist anywhere in India, with the exception of the unique temple at Dambal, which can be described either as a 24-pointed uninterrupted plan, or a 48-pointed plan with large square points of 90 degrees alternating with small short points of 75 degrees. The upper tiers of the seven-tiered superstructure look like cogged wheels with 48 dents. The Doddabasappa Temple and the Someshvara Temple at Lakshmeshwara are examples of extreme variants of a basic \"dravida\" articulation. These temples prove that the architects and craftsman were consciously creating new compositions of architectural components out of traditional methods.\n\nIn the early 13th century, 12th century characteristics remained prominent; however, many parts that were formerly plain became decorated. This change is observed in the Muktesvara Temple at Chaudayyadanapura (Chavudayyadanapura) and the Santesvara Temple at Tilavalli, both in the Haveri district. The Muktesvara Temple with its elegant \"vimana\" was renovated in the middle of the 13th century. In the Tilavalli Temple, all the architectural components are elongated, giving it an intended crowded look. Both temples are built with a \"dravida\" articulation. Apart from exotic \"dravida\" articulations, some temples of this period have \"nagara\" articulation, built in the stepped-diamond and the square plan natural to a \"nagara\" superstructure. Notable among temples with a stepped-diamond style are the Ganesha Temple at Hangal, the Banashankari temple at Amargol (which has one \"dravida\" shrine and one \"nagara\" shrine), and a small shrine that is a part of the ensemble at the Mahadeva Temple. At Hangal, the architects were able to provide a \"sekhari\" superstructure to the shrine, while the lower half received a \"nagara\" articulation and depictions of miniature \"sekhari\" towers. The style of workmanship with a square plan is found at Muttagi and the Kamala Narayana Temple at Degoan.\n\nTemples built in and around the Kalyani region (in the Bidar district) were quite different from those built in other regions. Without exception, the articulation was \"nagara\", and the temple plan as a rule was either stepped-diamond or stellate. The elevations corresponding to these two plans were similar because star shapes were produced by rotating the corner projections of a standard stepped plan in increments of 11.25 degrees, resulting in a 32-pointed interrupted plan in which three star points are skipped in the centre of each side of the shrine. Examples of stepped-diamond plans surviving in Karnataka are the Dattatreya Temple at Chattarki, the Someshvara Temple in Kadlewad, and the Mallikarjuna and Siddhesvara at Kalgi in the Gulbarga district. The \"nagara\" shrine at Chattarki is a stepped diamond of projecting corners with five projections per side. Because of the stepped-diamond plan, the wall pillars have two fully exposed sides, with a high base block decorated with a mirrored stalk motif and two large wall images above. The shapes and decorations on the rest of the wall pillar have a striking resemblance to the actual pillars supporting the ceiling.\n\nThe other type is the square plan with simple projections and recesses but with a possibility of both \"sekhari\" and \"bhumija\" superstructures. The plan does not have any additional elements save those that derive from the ground plan. The recesses are simple and have just one large wall image. The important characteristic of these \"nagara\" temples in the Kalyani region is that they not only differ from the \"dravida\" temples in the north Karnataka region but from the \"nagara\" temples north of the Kalyani region as well. These differences are manifest in the articulation and in the shapes and ornamentation of individual architectural components, giving them a unique place in Chalukyan architecture. Temples that fall in this category are the Mahadeva Temple at Jalsingi and the Suryanarayana Temple at Kalgi in the modern-day Gulbarga district. The plan and the \"nagara\" articulation of these temples are the same as found to the north of the Kalyani region, but the details are different, producing a different look.\n\nThe Western Chalukya decorative inventiveness focused on the pillars, door panels, lintels (\"torana\"), domical roofs in bays, outer wall decorations such as \"Kirtimukha\" (gargoyle faces common in Western Chalukya decoration), and miniature towers on pilasters. Although the art form of these artisans does not have any distinguishing features from a distance, a closer examination reveals their taste for decoration. An exuberance of carvings, bands of scroll work, figural bas-reliefs and panel sculptures are all closely packed. The doorways are highly ornamented but have an architectural framework consisting of pilasters, a moulded lintel and a cornice top. The sanctum receives diffused light through pierced window screens flanking the doorway; these features were inherited and modified by the Hoysala builders. The outer wall decorations are well rendered. The Chalukyan artisans extended the surface of the wall by means of pilasters and half pilasters. Miniature decorative towers of multiple types are supported by these pilasters. These towers are of the \"dravida\" tiered type, and in the \"nagara\" style they were made in the \"latina\" (mono aedicule) and its variants; the \"bhumija\" and \"sekhari\".\n\nThe Jain Temple, Lakkundi marked an important step in the development of Western Chalukya outer wall ornamentation, and in the Muktesvara Temple at Chavudayyadanapura the artisans introduced a double curved projecting eave (\"chhajja\"), used centuries later in Vijayanagara temples. The Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi embodies a more mature development of the Chalukyan architecture in which the tower has a fully expressed ascending line of niches. The artisans used northern style spires and expressed it in a modified \"dravida\" outline. Miniature towers of both \"dravida\" and \"nagara\" types are used as ornamentation on the walls. With further development, the divisions between storeys on the superstructure became less marked, until they almost lost their individuality. This development is exemplified in the Dodda Basappa Temple at Dambal, where the original \"dravida\" structure can only be identified after reading out the ornamental encrustation that covers the surface of each storey.\n\nThe walls of the \"vimana\" below the \"dravida\" superstructure are decorated with simple pilasters in low relief with boldly modeled sculptures between them. There are fully decorated surfaces with frequent recesses and projections with deeper niches and conventional sculptures. The decoration of the walls is subdued compared to that of the later Hoysala architecture. The walls, which are broken up into hundreds of projections and recesses, produce a remarkable effect of light and shade, an artistic vocabulary inherited by the Hoysala builders in the decades that followed.\n\nAn important feature of Western Chalukya roof art is the use of domical ceilings (not to be confused with the European types that are built of voussoirs with radiating joints) and square ceilings. Both types of ceilings originate from the square formed in the ceiling by the four beams that rest on four pillars. The dome above the four central pillars is normally the most attractive. The dome is constructed of ring upon ring of stones, each horizontally bedded ring smaller than the one below. The top is closed by a single stone slab. The rings are not cemented but held in place by the immense weight of the roofing material above them pressing down on the haunches of the dome. The triangular spaces created when the dome springs from the centre of the square are filled with arabesques. In the case of square ceilings, the ceiling is divided into compartments with images of lotus rosettes or other images from Hindu mythology.\n\nPillars are a major part of Western Chalukya architecture and were produced in two main types: pillars with alternate square blocks and a sculptured cylindrical section with a plain square-block base, and bell-shaped lathe-turned pillars. The former type is more vigorous and stronger than the bell-shaped type, which is made of soapstone and has a quality of its own. Inventive workmanship was used on soapstone shafts, roughly carved into the required shapes using a lathe. Instead of laboriously rotating a shaft to obtain the final finish, workers added the final touches to an upright shaft by using sharp tools. Some pillars were left unpolished, as evidenced by the presence of fine grooves made by the pointed end of the tool. In other cases, polishing resulted in pillars with fine reflective properties such as the pillars in the temples at Bankapura, Itagi and Hangal. This pillar art reached its zenith in the temples at Gadag, specifically the Sarasvati Temple in Gadag city.\n\nNotable in Western Chalukya architecture are the decorative door panels that run along the length of the door and over on top to form a lintel. These decorations appear as bands of delicately chiseled fretwork, moulded colonettes and scrolls scribed with tiny figures. The bands are separated by deep narrow channels and grooves and run over the top of the door. The temple plan often included a heavy slanting cornice of double curvature, which projected outward from the roof of the open \"mantapa\". This was intended to reduce heat from the sun, blocking the harsh sunlight and preventing rainwater from pouring in between the pillars. The underside of the cornice looks like woodwork because of the rib-work. Occasionally, a straight slabbed cornice is seen.\n\nFigural sculpture on friezes and panels changed during the period. The heroes from the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata, depicted often in early temples, become fewer, limited to only a few narrow friezes; there is a corresponding increase in the depiction of Hindu gods and goddesses in later temples. Depiction of deities above miniature towers in the recesses, with a decorative lintel above, is common in 12th-century temples, but not in later ones. Figures of holy men and dancing girls were normally sculpted for deep niches and recesses. The use of bracket figures depicting dancing girls became common on pillars under beams and cornices. Among animal sculptures, the elephant appears more often than the horse: its broad volumes offered fields for ornamentation. Erotic sculptures are rarely seen in Chalukyan temples; the Tripurantakesvara Temple at Balligavi is an exception. Here, erotic sculpture is limited to a narrow band of friezes that run around the exterior of the temple.\n\nIn what was a departure from convention, the Western Chalukyan figure sculptures of gods and goddesses bore stiff forms and were repeated over and over in the many temples. This was in contrast to the naturalistic and informal poses employed in the earlier temples in the region. Barring occasional exaggerations in pose, each principal deity had its own pose depending on the incarnation or form depicted. Consistent with figure sculpture in other parts of India, these figures were fluent rather than defined in their musculature, and the drapery was reduced to a few visible lines on the body of the image.\n\nWestern Chalukyan deity sculptures were well-rendered; exemplified best by that of Hindu goddess Sarasvati at the Sarasvati temple in Gadag city. Much of the drapery on the bust of the image is ornamentation comprising jewellery made of pearls around her throat. An elaborate pile of curls forms her hair, some of which trails to her shoulders. Above these curly tresses and behind the head is a tiered coronet of jewels, the curved edge of which rises to form a halo. From the waist down, the image is dressed in what seems to be the most delicate of material; except for the pattern of embroidery traced over it, it is difficult to tell where the drapery begins and where it ends.\n\nFrom the 11th century, architectural articulation included icons between pilasters, miniature towers supported by pilasters in the recesses of walls, and, on occasion, the use of wall pillars to support these towers. These miniature towers were of the southern \"dravida\" and northern \"bhumija\" and \"sekhari\" types and were mostly used to elaborate \"dravida\" types of articulation. The miniatures on single pilasters were decorated with a protective floral lintel on top, a form of decoration normally provided for depiction of gods. These elaborations are observed in the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri. These miniatures became common in the 12th century, and the influence of this northern articulation is seen in the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi and in the nearby Nannesvara Temple.\n\nThe miniature towers bear finer and more elegant details, indicating that architectural ideas traveled fast from the north to the south. Decoration and ornamentation had evolved from a moulded form to a chiseled form, the sharpness sometimes giving it a three-dimensional effect. The foliage decorations changed from bulky to thin, and a change in the miniature towers on dual pilasters is seen. The 11th century miniatures consisted of a cornice (\"kapota\"), a floor (\"vyalamala\"), a balustrade (\"vedika\") and a roof (\"kuta\") with a voluptuous moulding, while in the 12th century, detailed \"dravida\" miniature towers with many tiny tiers (\"tala\") came into vogue. Some 12th-century temples such as the Kallesvara Temple at Hirehadagalli have miniature towers that do not stand on pilasters but instead are supported by balconies, which have niches underneath that normally contain an image of a deity.\n\nThe Western Chalukyan kings Shaivas (worshippers of the Hindu god Shiva) dedicated most of their temples to that God. They were however tolerant of the Vaishnava or Jain faiths and dedicated some temples to Vishnu and the Jain tirthankaras respectively. There are some cases where temples originally dedicated to one deity were converted to suit another faith. In such cases, the original presiding deity can sometimes still be identified by salient clues. While these temples shared the same basic plan and architectural sensibilities, they differed in some details, such as the visibility and pride of place they afforded the different deities.\n\nAs with all Indian temples, the deity in the sanctum was the most conspicuous indicator of the temple's dedication. The sanctum (Garbhagriha or cella) of a Shaiva temple would contain a Shiva \"linga\", the universal symbol of the deity. An image of Gaja Lakshmi (consort of the Hindu god Vishnu) or an image of Vishnu riding on Garuda, or even just the Garuda, signifies a Vaishnava temple. Gaja Lakshmi, however, on account of her importance to the Kannada-speaking regions, is found on the lintel of the entrance to the mantapa (pillared hall) in all temples irrespective of faith.\n\nThe carving on the projecting lintel on the doorway to the sanctum has the image of a \"linga\" or sometimes of Ganapati (Ganesha), the son of Shiva in the case of Shaiva temples or of a seated or upright Jain saint (Tirthankar) in the case of Jain temples.\n\nThe sukanasi or great arched niche at the base of the superstructure (Shikhara or tower) also contains an image indicative of the dedicators' sect or faith. Above the lintel, in a deep and richly wrought architrave can be found images of the Hindu trimurti (the Hindu triad of deities) Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu beneath arched rolls of arabesque. Shiva or Vishnu occupies the centre depending on the sect the temple was dedicated to.\n\nOccasionally, Ganapati and his brother Kartikeya (Kumara, Subramanya) or the \"saktis\", the female counterparts, can be found at either end of this carving. Carvings of the river Goddesses Ganga and Yamuna are found at either end of the foot of the doorway to the shrine in early temples.\n\nThe Western Chalukya dynastic rule ended in the late 12th century, but its architectural legacy was inherited by the temple builders in\nsouthern Karnataka, a region then under the control of the Hoysala empire. Broadly speaking, Hoysala architecture is derived from a variant of Western Chalukya architecture\nthat emerged from the Lakshmeshwar workshops. The construction of the Chennakesava Temple at Belur was the first major project commissioned by Hoysala King Vishnuvardhana in 1117 CE. This temple best exemplifies the Chalukyan taste the Hoysala artisans inherited.\nAvoiding overdecoration, these artists left uncarved spaces where required, although their elaborate doorjambs are exhibitionistic. Here, on the outer walls, the sculptures are not overdone, yet they are articulate and discreetly aesthetic. The Hoysala builders used soapstone almost universally as building material, a trend that started in the middle of the 11th century with Chalukyan temples. Other common artistic features between the two Kanarese dynasties are the ornate \"Salabhanjika\" (pillar bracket figures), the lathe-turned pillars and the makara torana (lintel with mythical beastly figure). The tower over the shrine in a Hoysala temple is a closely moulded form of the Chalukya style tower.\n\nWhen the Vijayanagara Empire was in power in the 15th and 16th centuries, its workshops preferred granite over soapstone as the building material for temples. However, an archaeological discovery within the royal center at Vijayanagara has revealed the use of soapstone for stepped wells. These stepped wells are fashioned entirely of finely finished soapstone arranged symmetrically, with steps and landings descending to the water on four sides. This design shows strong affinities to the temple tanks of the Western Chalukya–Hoysala period.\n\nUnlike the Badami Chalukyan temples featured in detailed studies by Henry Cousens (1927), Gary Tartakov (1969) and George Michell (1975), Western Chalukyan architecture suffered neglect despite its importance and wider use. Recently however, scholars have returned to the modern Karnataka region to focus on a longer chronology, investigating a larger geographical area, making detailed studies of epigraphs and giving more importance to individual monuments dating from the 11th through 13th centuries.\n\nThe first detailed study of Western Chalukya architecture was by M.A. Dhaky (1977), who used as a starting point two medieval epigraphs that claimed the architects were masters of various temple forms. This study focused in particular on the riches of the Western Chalukya miniature wall shrines (aedicules). An important insight gained from this work was that the architects of the region learned about temple forms from other regions. These forms to them appeared \"exotic\", but they learned to reproduce them with more or less mastery, depending on the extent of their familiarity with the other regions' building traditions. This conscious eclectic attempt to freely use elements from other regions in India was pointed out by Sinha (1993) as well.\n\nA seminal work by Adam Hardy (1995) examined the Karnataka temple-building tradition over a period of 700 years, from the 7th century to the 13th century, and reviewed more than 200 temples built by four dynasties; Badami Chalukya, Rashtrakuta, Western Chalukya and Hoysala. The study covered \"dravida\" and \"nagara\" style monuments and the differences between the \"dravida\" tradition in modern Karnataka and that of neighbouring Tamil Nadu and made it possible to interpret the many architectural details as part of a larger scheme.\n\nThe temples and epigraphs of the Western Chalukyas are protected by the Archaeological Survey of India and the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums–Government of Karnataka. In the words of historian S. Kamath (2001), \"The Western Chalukyas left behind some of the finest monuments of artistic merit. Their creations have the pride of place in Indian art tradition\".\n\nThe Mahadeva Temple at Itagi dedicated to Shiva is among the larger temples built by the Western Chalukyas and perhaps the most famous. Inscriptions hail it as the 'Emperor among temples'. Here, the main temple, the sanctum of which has a \"linga\", is surrounded by thirteen minor shrines, each with its own \"linga\". The temple has two other shrines, dedicated to Murthinarayana and Chandraleshwari, parents of Mahadeva, the Chalukya commander who consecrated the temple in 1112 CE.\n\nThe Siddheshwara temple in the Haveri district has sculptures of deities of multiple faiths. The temple may have been consecrated first as a Vaishnava temple, later taken over by Jains and eventually becoming a Shaiva temple. The hall in the temple contains sculptures of \"Uma Mahesvara\" (Shiva with his consort Uma), Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi, Surya (the sun god), Naga-Nagini (the snake goddess), and the sons of Shiva, Ganapati and Kartikeya. Shiva is depicted with four arms, holding his attributes: the \"damaru\" (drum), the \"aksamala\" (chain of beads) and the \"trishul\" (trident) in three arms. His lower left arm rests on Uma, who is seated on Shiva's lap, embracing him with her right arm while gazing into his face. The sculpture of Uma is well decorated with garlands, large earrings and curly hair.\n\nSome temples, in a departure from the norm, were dedicated to deities other than Shiva or Vishnu. These include the Surya (portrayed as 'Suryanarayana') shrine at the Kasi Vishveshwara temple complex and a Jain temple dedicated to Mahavira, both at Lakkundi; the Taradevi temple (built in a Buddhist architectural style) at Dambal in the Gadag district; the Mahamaya temple dedicated to a tantric goddess at Kuknur in the Koppal district, and the Durga temple at Hirekerur in the Haveri district.\n\n\nBook\n\nWeb\n"}
