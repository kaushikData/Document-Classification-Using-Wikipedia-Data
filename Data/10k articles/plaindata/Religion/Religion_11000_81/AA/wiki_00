{"id": "6747227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6747227", "title": "Albaicín", "text": "Albaicín\n\nThe Albaicín () or Albayzín () as it was known under Muslim rule, is a district of Granada, in the autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain. It retains the narrow winding streets of its Medieval Moorish past dating back to the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada. It was declared a World Heritage Site in 1984, along with the Alhambra.\n\nThe area that later became the Albayzín was first populated by the Iberians, the original inhabitants of the Iberian peninsula, with dispersed Roman settlements later appearing nearby. Nothing is known of its history before the arrival of the Muslim Arabs and Berbers, so it is assumed that the city was abandoned after the fall of the Roman Empire until the founding of the Zirid kingdom in 1013, when its defensive walls were built. According to some linguists it owes its present name to the inhabitants of the city of Baeza, called \"Beatia\" by the Romans, who were banished after the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa and settled here outside the walls. Other linguists assert that the name derives from the Arabic \"al-bayyāzīn\" (pronounced \"al-bayyīzīn\" with the imāla vowel-shift), meaning \"suburb of falconers\". However, the fact that in Andalusia there are many other neighborhoods with that name, including those in Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Alhama de Granada, Salobreña, and Antequera, among others, casts doubt on this thesis.\n\nThe Albayzín, one of the oldest centers of Muslim culture in Granada, contains the Alhambra, the \"Realejo\" (which was the Jewish quarter), and the \"Arrabal de Bib-Arrambla\", in the flat part of the city. Before the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula there were three small settlements in what is now the city of Granada and its surroundings:\n\n\nHowever, current archaeological research indicates the \"Madinat Ilbira\" (Medina Elvira) was located in Atarfe when that city's population was moved to the Albayzín after the fall of the Caliphate of Córdoba in the 11th century. The inhabitants of Ilbira remained clients of the Berber Sinhaya and the Zirids until the capital of the Cora of Elvira was transferred to the Albayzín hill. The neighborhood had its greatest influence at the time of the Nasrids. The Albaicín maintains the urban layout of the Moorish period, with narrow streets winding in an intricate network that extends from the top at \"San Nicolás\" and through Calle Elvira, both located in Plaza Nueva, by the course of the river Darro.\n\nThe traditional type of house is the \"carmen\", consisting of a freestanding house surrounded by a high wall that separates it from the street and including a small orchard or garden. The channeling and distribution of drinking water through pipes laid from wells was characteristic of this district; about 28 of these have been found, of which most are preserved but not in use because the pipes were broken over time.\n\nIn December 1499, the Albaicín was the starting point of a rebellion throughout Granada, triggered by the forced conversion of the Muslim population to Christianity.\n\nIn 1994, the Albaicín was declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO as an extension of the monuments of the Alhambra and the Generalife.\n\nIn the Albaicín there are numerous monuments from different periods, mainly the Nasrid period and the Renaissance:\n\n\n\n"}

He was the son and successor of Hasan I.\n\nIn 1173, after the death of his father, Ardashir I ascended the Bavandid throne. Right after the accession of Ardashir, his kingdom was invaded by the Khwarazmian prince Sultan Shah and the ruler of Khorasan, Mu'ayyid al-Din Ai-Aba, who captured several fortresses and cities from Ardashir. One year later, however, Mu'ayyid al-Din Ai-Aba was killed by Sultan Shah's brother Tekish. Ardashir quickly used the opportunity to reconquer Damghan and Bastam. Ardashir shortly made an alliance with Tekish, and made an agreement that when Tekish's daughter became old enough, she should marry Ardashir. In 1183, Tekish's daughter was sent along with her mother to the Bavandid capital of Sari, at which time the Oghuz leader Malik Dinar plundered the eastern parts of Mazandaran. Tekish shortly arrived at Gorgan, and forced the Oghuz leader to leave Tabaristan. He then demanded that Ardashir cede Gorgan to him, to which Ardashir was forced to agree. Ardashir also shortly married Tekish's daughter.\n\nArdashir now focused on his Paduspanid vassals, who were getting too powerful; he took much of Kai Ka'us I's territory which had been given to the latter during the reign of Ardashir's grandfather Shah Ghazi Rustam IV. Ardashir also ordered his general Mubariz al-Din Arjasf to attack Kai Ka'us. Sometime later, however, Kai Ka'us' son Justan died, and only his 1 year old grandson Zarrinkamar survived, whom Ardashir I agreed to raise and make ruler of the Paduspanid dynasty when the latter had grown up. Kai Ka'us shortly died in 1184. After his death, the nobles of the Paduspanid capital of Ruyan made his nephew Hazarasp II the new ruler of the dynasty. Unlike his predecessor, Hazarasp was a tyrant; he lost allegiance from several of his vassals by having some of their relatives killed, and making peace with the Ismailis, who were the most hated enemy of the Bavandids and several local rulers. \n\nArdashir, after having received the news of Hazarasp's actions, ordered Arjasf to invade Ruyan. Hazarasp managed to flee from Ruyan, and seek shelter with the Ismailis, who agreed to help him; Hazarasp shortly invaded Ruyan and killed its governor. Ardashir, greatly enraged by these actions, re-captured Ruyan and made Hezabr al-Din Khvorshid the new governor of the city. Hazarasp, after several failures to re-conquer Ruyan, asked Ardashir for forgiveness. He was, however, instead imprisoned by Ardashir, and was secretly murdered by Hezabr al-Din in case that Ardashir would restore Ruyan to Hazarasp.\n\nTekish, during his campaigns gained absolute and non-disputed control over Khorasan, and thus some local rulers and emirs declared independence from Ardashir, as they preferred the lordship of the powerful ruler Tekish. This degraded relations between Ardashir and his Tekish. Ardashir shortly captured and killed one of his disloyal vassals, which made Tekish in revenge invade Mazandaran and devastate the eastern parts of the region. Ardashir shortly began to adopt an anti-Khwarazmian policy, and began improving his relations with the Seljuq Sultan Toghrul III, the military ruler Pahlavan ibn Ildeniz and the Abbasid Caliph al-Nasir. In 1191, Tekish occupied the eastern territories of Ardashir and demanded Ardashir to cede Bastam and Damghan, which he did have no choice to but to cede. \n\nOne year later, Ardashir sent an army to aid Toghrul III in capturing Ray. He shortly made an alliance with the latter and made an alliance with his former enemy Sultan Shah, who was in Merv and threatening the stability of Tekish's kingdom. Ardashir shortly recaptured Gorgan, while Sultan Shah captured the important city of Nishapur. Ardashir's hope to destroy Tekish's kingdom, however, came to an end when Sultan Shah was killed in 1193. Things began to look more grim for Ardashir when Tekish killed Toghrul at Ray the following year. Ardashir shortly tried to regain his good relations with Tekish by sending an army under his youngest son Rukn al-Dawla Qarin to aid Tekish in his campaigns. The army, was, however, removed from Tekish's service, who sent an army under his amir Sutash to punish Ardashir for having made an alliance with his enemies. Sutash shortly devastated parts of Ardashir's domains, including the important city of Sari, which was now under the control of a Khwarazmian governor.\n\nIn 1199, Tekish made another invasion of Ardashir's territories, and took control over Firuzkuh, Ustunavand, and Folul. He shortly ordered Ardashir to send his son Sharaf al-Muluk to work under Tekish. During the same period, a group of nobles, under Ardashir's second son, Rustam V, plotted to overthrow Ardashir, and to crown Rustam V as the ruler of the Bavand dynasty. The amir Sutash took the advantage of the plot to settle permanently in Sari in order to increase his influence over Mazandaran, while another amir named Argush, occupied Amol.\n\nArdashir then defeated the conspiracy and imprisoned Rustam V. He shortly defeated Argush and regained control of Amol. Shortly after Tekish dismissed Sharaf al-Muluk and sent him back to Ardashir. He demanded that Ardashir send his daughter back. Ardashir, however, disobeyed this order. Shortly Tekish died, before he could punish Ardashir. He was succeeded by his son, Muhammad II.\n\nAfter Tekish's death, the power of the Khwarazmian dynasty in western Iran collapsed and all his former vassals rebelled. Muhammad II, was not able to reconquer lost Khwarazmian territory since he was busy in the east, which gave Ardashir the opportunity to reconquer Damghan, Firuzkuh, Folul and Ustunawand. When the Ghurid Sultan Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad invaded Khwarezm in 1204, he sent a delegate to Ardashir, who agreed to recognize his authority. However, Mu'izz al-Din Muhammad was himself shortly defeated and expelled from Khwarezm in 1205. Ardashir shortly died himself. About the same time, his heir Sharaf al-Muluk died, and the succession passed to another son, Rustam V, who was freed from prison and was brought to the throne at Amol.\n\n"}
{"id": "1218494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1218494", "title": "Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner", "text": "Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner\n\nAtanarjuat: The Fast Runner () is a 2001 Canadian epic film directed by Inuit filmmaker Zacharias Kunuk and produced by his company Isuma Igloolik Productions. It was the first feature film ever to be written, directed and acted entirely in the Inuktitut language.\n\nSet in the ancient past, the film retells an Inuit legend passed down through centuries of oral tradition. It revolves around the title character, whose marriage with his two wives earns him the animosity of the son of the band leader, who kills Atanarjuat's brother and forces Atanarjuat to flee by foot.\n\nThe film premiered at the 54th Cannes Film Festival in May 2001, and was released in Canada on 12 April 2002. A major critical success, \"Atanarjuat\" won the \"Caméra d'Or\" (\"Golden Camera\") at Cannes, and six Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture. \"Atanarjuat\" was also a commercial success, becoming Canada's top-grossing release of 2002, outperforming the mainstream comedy \"Men with Brooms\". It grossed more than US$5 million worldwide. In 2015, a poll of filmmakers and critics in the Toronto International Film Festival named it the greatest Canadian film of all time.\n\nAt Igloolik (\"place of houses\") in the Eastern Arctic wilderness at the dawn of the first millennium, Qulitalik bids goodbye to his sister Panikpak, wife of Kumaglak, promising to come if she calls for help in her heart. She gives him her husband's rabbit's foot for spiritual power.\n\nIn a flashback, the community is visited by the strange shaman Tungajuaq. During a spiritual duel with the visitor, the camp leader Kumaglak dies. The visitor removes the walrus-tooth necklace from Kumaglak's body, and puts the necklace around the neck of Kumaglak's son Sauri, who thus becomes camp leader. Much later, the shaman's magic has poisoned the community with hatred. Tulimaq, the laughing stock of the camp, is having bad luck hunting and can barely feed his family, but Panikpak brings meat for Tulimaq's children, Atanarjuat and Amaqjuaq, hoping that one day they will make things right.\n\nAtanarjuat grows up to be a fast runner, Amaqjuaq is strong, and they are rivals with Sauri and his son Oki. During a game of ′wolf tag′ Atanarjuat pursues the beautiful Atuat, provoking jealousy in Oki. Oki's sister Puja also shows interest in Atanarjuat. In a punching duel with Oki, Atanarjuat wins the right to marry Atuat. Later, Atanarjuat leaves his wife Atuat at a camp to hunt caribou, but he stops at Sauri's camp, where he is persuaded to take Puja on the hunt. Camping by a lake, Atanarjuat and Puja sing, flirt, and have sex.\n\nLater, Atanarjuat is in an unhappy marriage with Atuat and Puja. He catches his brother having sex with Puja and strikes Puja. She runs to Sauri's camp and tells them that Atanarjuat tried to kill her, so Sauri and Oki decide to kill Atanarjuat, Panikpak however remains skeptical of Puja's accusations. Puja returns to Atanarjuat's camp apologizing, and is accepted back. One day the women decide to go find eggs, but first Puja places a boot outside the tent where the men are resting. Oki and two henchmen sneak up and plunge their spears through the tent wall. Amaqjuaq is killed, but Oki is startled by a vision of his grandfather Kumaglak, and Atanarjuat, naked and barefoot, bursts out of the tent and runs for miles across the ice, pursued by Oki's gang. Atanarjuat escapes by following a vision of Qulitalik and jumping a wide open crack in the ice. Eventually he collapses in exhaustion with bloody feet. He is rescued by Qulitalik and his family, who conceal him when Oki arrives in pursuit.\n\nBack at Igloolik, Sauri refuses to let Oki have Atuat, but Oki rapes Atuat, who is comforted by Panikpak. During a hunt, Oki stabs Sauri and claims it was an accident, and takes over as camp leader. In her heart, Panikpak summons her brother Qulitalik to come, as they agreed years ago. Qulitalik feels her call and makes magic with the rabbit foot: at Igloolik Oki catches a rabbit with his bare hands, eats it, and falls under a spell that makes him forget his grievances. Qulitalik and the family make the long sled journey back to Igloolik with Atanarjuat, who has healed. Atanarjuat is joyfully reunited with Atuat but rejects Puja. The spell-happy Oki just wants to have a feast. But Atanarjuat prepares an ice floor in an igloo and invites Oki and his brothers inside. He slips antlers on his feet to grip the ice and subdues them, declaring that the killing is over. It is now time to confront the evil that has plagued the community for so long. With everyone gathered together, Qulitalik calls forth the spirits, and the evil shaman Tungajuaq appears, grunting like a polar bear. Qulitalik confronts the shaman with the powerful spirit of the walrus and magic soil, Panikpak shakes the walrus tooth necklace, and the shaman is destroyed and vanishes. Panikpak tells the group it is time for forgiveness: Oki and Puja and their friends are forgiven for their evil deeds, but are exiled from Igloolik forever.\n\n\n\n\nThe film is set in Igloolik (\"place of houses\") in the Eastern Arctic wilderness at the dawn of the first millennium, \nThe names of Atanarjuat and his brother first appeared in writing in the journals of the explorer Captain George Lyon, who took part in a British expedition to search for the Northwest Passage in 1821–23. The Inuit believe the story of Atanarjuat to be more than five centuries old. This agrees with geomorphological estimates that Qikiqtaarjuk (Herschel Island), Inuktitut for \"little island\" and now a peninsula of Igloolik Island, on which much of the action occurs, became a peninsula about 500 years ago due to isostatic rebound. The main elements of the original story are that two brothers are betrayed by their wives and help set up a sneak attack. Rivals plunge their spears through the walls of the brothers' tent, but the fast runner makes an escape across the ice, naked and barefoot. After being rescued and healing, the fast runner sets up his own ambush and succeeds in killing his rivals. It was the first Inuktitut-language screenplay, and the project became the first feature film in Inuktitut.\n\nWriter Paul Apak Angilirq, director Zacharias Kunuk, and many others on the production team had heard the Atanarjuat legend when they were young. Over the course of five years, Angilirq interviewed seven elders for their versions of the story and combined them into one treatment. The final script was developed by the team of Angilirq, Norman Cohn (producer and cinematographer), Kunuk, Herve Paniaq (tribal elder), and Pauloosie Qulitalik. Angilirq died due to cancer during film production in 1998.\n\nDespite the emphasis on accuracy, the film takes liberties with the original Inuit myth: \"At the film's core is a crucial lie\", wrote Justin Shubow in \"The American Prospect\", which is that the original legend ended in a revenge killing, whereas in the film Atanarjuat stops short of shedding blood. Kunuk felt this was \"A message more fitting for our times\", and agreed that it \"probably\" reflected the influence of Christianity and its concept of forgiveness on contemporary Inuit.\n\nAfter Isuma applied to Telefilm Canada in spring 1998 for financial support, plans were made to begin filming in Igloolik, Nunavut in April. The month was important because April is typically the only time of year in Northern Canada when camera equipment could film winter scenes without malfunctioning due to cold. Kunuk found there was a lack of funding available from Telefilm and the Canadian government, which prioritized English and French-language productions over the languages of Aboriginal Peoples in Canada, and would not provide more than $100,000 for a film in an Aboriginal language, which would make \"Atanarjuat\" impossible. Kunuk regarded this as racial discrimination.\n\nDue to difficulty with funding, Isuma instead successfully appealed for support of the National Film Board of Canada. Although the NFB had abandoned fiction, Isuma argued that in documenting Inuit mythology, \"Atanarjuat\" was similar to a documentary film. The budget was approved at $1.96 million.\n\nAchieving historical accuracy was paramount to the production. According to anthropologist Bernard Saladin d'Anglure the biggest challenge was resurrecting the beliefs and practice of shamanism, \"the major frame of reference for Inuit life\". Research into historical sources—often the journals of European explorers—provided the basis for the reconstruction of clothes and customs. Elders were consulted. In an interview, Paul Apak Angilirq said: \n\nThe filming crew was 90% Inuit. Filming began in 1999, stretching from 3 p.m. to 3 a.m., given the sun was always up. Cohn used natural light in shooting with his Sony DVW 700 digital camera, avoiding switches from the automatic camera settings. The film production pumped more than $1.5 million into the local economy of Igloolik and employed about 60 people. Given the small population, everyone in Igloolik knew at least one crew member.\n\nKunuk explained how the crew set out: The crew would costume the actors and apply make-up, only for the production to stall for four hours for ideal weather, which Kunuk said required the patience found in Inuit hunting.\n\nThe film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2001. It was also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2001.\n\nIts commercial release in Canada came on 12 April 2002, with the only bidder for distribution rights being Alliance Atlantis and its affiliate, Odeon Films. It had already been playing in France for seven weeks, and was on 83 screens. The film opened in New York City on 7 June 2002.\n\nIn the Greater Toronto Area, the film competed with the Canadian comedy \"Men with Brooms\", which set box office records among English Canadian cinema. \"Atanarjuat\" became more enduring in the box office and became one of the highest grossing Canadian films to date.\n\nBy 7 November 2002, \"Atanarjuat\" grossed $1.1 million in Canada, with Odeon Films spokesman Mark Slone declaring this \"an unqualified hit\". In the U.S., it grossed $1.75 million by 11 July 2002. In France, it drew 200,000 admissions before the commercial Canadian release in April 2002. Its gross was higher than any Canadian film of 2002. The film finished its run on 30 January 2003 having grossed $3,789,952 in North America and $1,398,337 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $5,188,289.\n\n\"Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner\" was praised by critics upon its release. Brian D. Johnson of \"Maclean's\" hailed it as a masterpiece and a landmark in international film, writing, \"This movie doesn't just transport you to another world; it creates its own sense of time and space.\" In the \"Toronto Star\", Peter Howell wrote the film overcame the stereotypes of the 1922 film \"Nanook of the North\" and \"defines an epic in every way\".\n\nRoger Ebert from \"Chicago Sun-Times\" awarded it four stars, praising the film's acting, fleshed out characters, and direction, calling it \"passion, filtered through ritual and memory\". Peter Bradshaw from \"The Guardian\" praised the film's performances and cinematography, calling the film \"A remarkable world first\". Tom Dawson from BBC called the film \"an impressively vivid and detailed depiction of a particular way of life\", hailing the film's cinematography as \"extraordinary\". A.O. Scott from The New York Times praised the film, stating \"Mr. Kunuk has accomplished the remarkable feat of endowing characters from an old folk tale with complicated psychological motives and responses. The combination of dramatic realism and archaic grandeur is irresistibly powerful\". Marjorie Baumgarten from \"The Austin Chronicle\" complimented the film's script, cinematography, and visual style as being unique and refreshing. Leonard Maltin awarded the film four stars, calling it \"A privileged peek into Inuit culture and a stirring, deeply personal drama\".\n\nThe goals of the film were first to show how for thousands of years Inuit communities had survived and thrived in the Arctic, and second to introduce the new storytelling medium of film to help Inuit communities survive long into the future. Doug Alexander wrote in the Canadian historical magazine \"The Beaver\" that \"Atanarjuat\" \"is an important step for an indigenous people who have, until recently, seen their culture recorded by outsiders\". Jennifer L. Gauthier of \"CineAction\" wrote \"\"Atanarjuat\" was made primarily for Inuit audiences so that they could see positive and accurate images of themselves on the screen\". Director Kunuk put it a little more bluntly: \"Four thousand years of oral history silenced by fifty years of priests, schools, and cable TV\". He explained, \"I first heard the story of Atanarjuat from my mother\". \"Kids all over Nunavut are playing Atanarjuat in the streets,\" said producer Norman Cohn in a 2002 interview. At one point the production company was considering making Atanarjuat action figures.\n\nIn 2004, critics and filmmakers in the Toronto International Film Festival named the film fifth in the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time. In the next update in 2015, it placed first, prompting essayist Steve Gravestock to comment, \"This is likely the first time that a film by an indigenous filmmaker has topped a poll of national cinema.\" \"The Nunatsiaq News\" heralded the choice as a sign \"Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner\" \"has stood the test of time\". However, Eric Moreault, writing for \"La Presse\", dismissed \"Atanarjuat\"s first-place finish as nonsensical, noting \"Mon oncle Antoine\" topped all previous versions. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a positive 90% \"Certified Fresh\" based on 94 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Compelling human drama and stunning cinematography make \"The Fast Runner\" an absorbing experience\". On Metacritic the film has a score of 91 out of 100 based on 29 critics indicating critical acclaim.\n\nThe film won the Caméra d'Or at Cannes, the first time a Canadian film won the honour. Canadian historian George Melnyk interpreted this as a sign that \"Canadian cinema has come of global age\", also pointing to \"The Barbarian Invasions\" winning the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. At the 22nd Genie Awards, Krista Uttak accepted the Award for Best Screenplay on behalf of her deceased father Paul Apak Angilirq.\n\nCanada submitted \"Atanarjuat\" for consideration for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It was one of the rare Canadian films not in French submitted for consideration, with \"The Necessities of Life\" in 2008 also containing a substantial amount of Inuktitut. \"Atanarjuat\" was not nominated.\n\n\n\n"}

She urged Western governments to share their prosperity with the rest of the world and in the 1960s turned her attention to environmental questions as well. She was an early advocate of sustainable development before this term became familiar and was well known as a journalist, lecturer and broadcaster. Ward was adviser to policy-makers in the UK, United States and elsewhere.\n\nBarbara Ward was born in Heworth, York, on 23 May 1914, but her family soon moved to Felixstowe. Her father was a solicitor with Quaker tendencies, while her mother was a devout Catholic. She attended a convent school before studying in Paris, first at a lycée, then for some months at the Sorbonne before going on to Germany. Though she had once planned to study modern languages, her interest in public affairs led to a degree course in politics, philosophy, and economics at Somerville College, Oxford University, from which she graduated in 1935.\n\nShe did post-graduate work on Austrian politics and economics. After witnessing antisemitism there and in Nazi Germany she began to help Jewish refugees, and mobilise Roman Catholic support for any forthcoming UK war effort, although she had initially been \"sympathetic to Hitler\". With Christopher Dawson, the historian, as leader and Ward as secretary, the Sword of the Spirit was established as an organisation to bring together Catholics and Anglicans opposing Nazism. It became a Roman Catholic group whose policies were promoted by the \"Dublin Review\", which Dawson edited, and for which Ward wrote regularly.\n\nDuring the Second World War, she worked for the Ministry of Information and travelled in Europe and the US. Partly on the strength of her 1938 book, \"The International Share-out\", Geoffrey Crowther, editor of \"The Economist\", offered her a job. She left the magazine in 1950 having risen to foreign editor, but continued to contribute articles throughout her life. As well as writings on economic and foreign policy, her broadcasts on Christian values in wartime were published as \"The Defence of the West\" by Sword of the Spirit. During this time she was also president of the Catholic Women's League and a popular panel member of the BBC programme \"The Brains Trust\" which answered listeners' questions. In 1946 she became a governor of the BBC and of the Old Vic theatre. After the war, Ward was a supporter of the Marshall Plan, of a strong Europe, and of a European free trade area. \n\nIn 1950, Barbara Ward married Australian Commander Robert Jackson, an administrator for the United Nations. Their son Robert was born in 1956, the same year that his father was knighted. Ward continued to use her own name professionally and was not widely known as Lady Jackson. Over the next few years they lived in West Africa and made various visits to India, and these experiences helped form Ward's views on the need for Western nations to contribute to the economic development of poorer countries. For the next two decades both husband and wife travelled a great deal, and eventually their marriage suffered from this. A legal separation was arranged in the early 1970s though Ward, as a Catholic, did not want divorce. In 1976 when she was given a life peerage she used her estranged husband's surname for her title as Baroness Jackson of Lodsworth.\n\nWard had been a frequent public speaker since leaving university, and by the 1960s her lectures attracted international respect; several lecture series, including some presented in Canada, Ghana and India, were published in book form. Ward spent increasing amounts of time in the US, much of her work there funded by the Carnegie Foundation. In 1957 Harvard University gave her an honorary LittD and until 1968 she was a Carnegie fellow there, living for part of each year in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1966. She got to know Adlai Stevenson and John F Kennedy and acted as adviser to various influential policy makers, including Robert McNamara at the World Bank and Lyndon B Johnson, who welcomed her thoughts on his Great Society projects despite her opposition to the Vietnam war.\n\nShe influenced James Wolfensohn's thinking on development questions. She had influence in the Vatican, helped set up a pontifical commission for justice and peace, and in 1971 was the first woman ever to address a synod of Roman Catholic bishops. One of her proposals was that richer countries should commit a certain proportion of their GNP in aid to the developing world, and she also spoke of the need for institutions to enable and manage both 'aid and trade'. This was a practical as well as an ethical concern: Ward believed such policies would encourage stability and peace. She is sometimes called a \"distributist\".\n\nWard started to see a close connection between wealth distribution and conservation of planetary resources. \"… the careful husbandry of the Earth is \"sine qua non\" for the survival of the human species, and for the creation of decent ways of life for all the people of the world.\" She used the phrases \"inner limits and \"outer limits\" to refer to the inner limits of the human right to an adequate standard of living and the outer limits of what the Earth can sustain. In 1966, she published \"Spaceship Earth\" and is sometimes said to have coined the phrase. Ward is seen by some as a pioneer of sustainable development. She and René Dubos, co-authors of \"Only One Earth\" (), have been described as \"parents\" of a concept which \"did not know its own name at first\". \"Only One Earth: The Care and Maintenance of a Small Planet\" was written for the 1972 UN Stockholm conference on the Human Environment. The report was commissioned by Maurice Strong, secretary general of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment.\n\nWard's work was rooted in her sense of morality and Christian values. She saw care of the environment and concern for the well-being of all humankind as a \"dual responsibility\", especially for anyone sharing her religious outlook. At the same time, she believed wealth distribution combined with conservation was essentially a rational policy: \"We are a ship's company on a small ship. Rational behaviour is the condition of survival.\" In 1971 she founded the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), acting as president from 1973 and chairman from 1980.\n\nWard had recovered from cancer in the late 1940s thanks, she believed, to the spiritual support of Padre Pio. The illness recurred twenty years later but surgery did not cure her. In 1973 she retired from Columbia University where she had been Schweitzer Professor of Economic Development for the previous five years and went to live in Lodsworth, Sussex. The next year she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and on 18 October 1976 a life peer as Baroness Jackson of Lodsworth, of Lodsworth in the County of West Sussex; she and her husband both held noble titles in their own right. She wrote her last book, \"Progress for a Small Planet\", despite her deteriorating health, discussing the \"planetary community\", dwindling resources used up too fast by wealthy countries, and the needs of poorer parts of the world. It was published in 1979, two years before her death on 31 May 1981, aged 67.\n\nIn 1980, she received the Jawaharlal Nehru Award.\n\nPope John Paul II sent a Cardinal to represent him at Ward's requiem service. At her own request, she was buried in the graveyard of the local Anglican parish church.\n\nHer brother, John Ward, was a noted civil engineer who, after his work on the M4 motorway in the 1960s, was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. Her great-niece, Marsha Shandur, is now a music presenter on radio.\n\n\nThe International Institute for Environment and Development organises the 'Barbara Ward Lectures' in memory of Ward, who was the Institute's first director.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "724922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=724922", "title": "Basava", "text": "Basava\n\nBasavanna (ಬಸವಣ್ಣ) was a 12th-century philosopher, statesman, Kannada poet in the Niraakaara (formless identity) Shiva-focussed Bhakti movement and a social reformer during the reign of the Kalachuri-dynasty king Bijjala I in Karnataka, India.\n\nBasavanna spread social awareness through his poetry, popularly known as \"Vachanaas\". Basavanna rejected gender or social discrimination, superstitions and rituals such as the wearing of sacred thread, but introduced \"Ishtalinga\" necklace, with an image of the Shiva Liṅga, to every person regardless of his or her birth, to be a constant reminder of one's bhakti (devotion) to Shiva. As the chief minister of his kingdom, he introduced new public institutions such as the \"Anubhava Mantapa\" (or, the \"hall of spiritual experience\"), which welcomed men and women from all socio-economic backgrounds to discuss spiritual and mundane questions of life, in open.\n\nThe traditional legends and hagiographic texts state Basava to be the founder of the Lingayats. However, modern scholarship relying on historical evidence such as the Kalachuri inscriptions state that Basava was the poet philosopher who revived, refined and energized an already existing tradition. The \"Basavarajadevara Ragale\" (13 out of 25 sections are available) by the Kannada poet Harihara (c.1180) is the earliest available account on the life of the social reformer and is considered important because the author was a near contemporary of his protagonist. A full account of Basava's life and ideas are narrated in a 13th-century sacred Telugu text, the \"Basava Purana\" by Palkuriki Somanatha.\n\nBasava literary works include the Vachana Sahitya in Kannada Language. He is also known as Bhaktibhandari (literally, the treasurer of devotion), Basavanna (elder brother Basava) or Basaveswara (Lord Basava).\n\nBasava was born in 1105 AD in the town of Basavan bagewadi in north Karnataka, to Madarasa and Madalambike, a Kannada Brahmin family devoted to Hindu deity Shiva. He was named Basava, a Kannada form of the Sanskrit \"Vrishabha\" in honor of Nandi bull (carrier of Shiva) and the local Shaivism tradition.\n\nBasava grew up in Kudalasangama (northeast Karnataka), near the banks of rivers Krishna and its tributary Malaprabha. Basava spent twelve years studying in a Hindu temple in the town of Kudalasangama, at Sangameshwara then a Shaivite school of learning, probably of the \"Lakulisha-Pashupata\" tradition.\n\nBasava married a cousin from his mother side. His wife \"Gangambike\", was the daughter of the prime minister of \"Bijjala\", the Kalachuri king. He began working as an accountant to the court of the king. When his maternal uncle died, the king invited him to be the chief minister. The king also married Basava's sister named \"Padmavati\".\n\nAs chief minister of the kingdom, Basava used the state treasury to initiate social reforms and religious movement focussed on reviving Shaivism, recognizing and empowering ascetics who were called Jangamas. One of the innovative institutions he launched in 12th century, was the \"Anubhava Mantapa\", a public assembly and gathering, which attracted men and women across various walks of life, from distant lands to openly discuss spiritual, economic and social issues of life. He composed poetry in local language, and spread his message to the masses. His teachings and verses such as \"Káyakavé Kailása\" (Work is the path to \"Kailash\" (bliss, heaven), or Work is Worship) became popular.\n\nSeveral works are attributed to Basava, which are revered in the Lingayat community. These include various \"Vachana\" (literally, \"what is said\") such as the \"Shat-sthala-vachana\" (discourses of the six stages of salvation), \"Kala-jnana-vachana\" (forecasts of the future), \"Mantra-gopya\", \"Ghatachakra-vachana\" and \"Raja-yoga-vachana\".\n\nThe \"Basava Purana\", a Telugu biographical epic poem, first written by Palkuriki Somanatha in 13th-century, and an updated 14th century Kannada version, written by Bhima Kavi in 1369, are sacred texts in Lingayatism.\n\nOther hagiographic works include the 15th-century \"Mala Basava-raja-charitre\" and the 17th-century \"Vrishabhendra Vijaya\", both in Kannada.\n\nScholars state that the poems and legends about Basava were written down long after Basava's death. This has raised questions about the accuracy and creative interpolation by authors who were not direct witness, but derived their work relying on memory, legends and hearsay of others. Michael states, \"All \"Vachana\" collections as they exist at present are probably much later than the 15th-century [300 years post-Basava]. Much critical labor needs to be spent in determining the authenticity of portions of these collections\".\n\nBasava grew up in a Brahmin family with a tradition of Shaivism. As a leader, he developed and inspired a new devotional movement named \"Virashaivas\", or \"ardent, heroic worshippers of Shiva\". This movement shared its roots in the ongoing Tamil Bhakti movement, particularly the Shaiva Nayanars traditions, over the 7th- to 11th-century. However, Basava championed devotional worship that rejected temple worship and rituals led by Brahmins, and replaced it with personalized direct worship of Shiva through practices such as individually worn icons and symbols like a small linga. This approach brought Shiva's presence to everyone and at all times, without gender, class or caste discrimination. Basava's poem, such as Basavanna 703, speak of strong sense of gender equality and community bond, willing to wage war for the right cause, yet being a fellow \"devotees' bride\" at the time of his or her need.\n\nA recurring contrast in his poems and ideas is of \"Sthavara\" and \"Jangama\", that is, of \"what is static, standing\" and \"what is moving, seeking\" respectively. Temples, ancient books represented the former, while work and discussion represented the latter.\n\nBasava emphasized constant personal spiritual development as the path to profound enlightenment. He championed the use of vernacular language, Kannada, in all spiritual discussions so that translation and interpretation by the elite is unnecessary, and everyone can understand the spiritual ideas. Basava approach is akin to the protestant movement, states Ramanuja. His philosophy revolves around treating one's own body and soul as a temple; instead of making a temple, he suggests being the temple. His trinity consisted of \"guru\" (teacher), \"linga\" (personal symbol of Shiva) and \"jangama\" (constantly moving and learning).\n\nBasava established, in 12th-century, \"Anubhava Mantapa\", a hall for gathering and discussion of spiritual ideas by any member of the society from both genders, where ardent devotees of Shiva shared their achievements and spiritual poems in the local language. He questioned rituals, dualism and externalization of god, and stated that the true god is \"one with himself, self-born\".\n\nWhile Basava rejected rituals, he encouraged icons and symbols such as the wearing of \"Istalinga\" (necklace with personal linga, symbol of Shiva), of Rudraksha seeds or beads on parts of one body, and apply \"Vibhuti\" (sacred ash on forehead) as a constant reminder of one's devotion and principles of faith. Another aid to faith, he encouraged was the six-syllable mantra, \"Shivaya Namah\", or the \"shadhakshara mantra\" which is \"Om Namah Shivaya\".\n\nThe Basava Purana, in Chapter 1, presents a series of impassioned debates between Basava and his father. Both declare Hindu Sruti and Smriti to be sources of valid knowledge, but they disagree on the \"marga\" (path) to liberated, righteous life. Basava's father favors the tradition of rituals, while Basava favors the path of direct, personal devotion (bhakti).\n\nAccording to Velcheru Rao and Gene Roghair, Basava calls the path of devotion as \"beyond six systems of philosophy. Sruti has commended it as the all-seeing. Its subtle form is beyond praise. Its eternally blissful form is the beginning of the beginning. The form of that divine linga is the true God. The \"guru\" [teacher] of the creed is an embodiment of kindness and compassion. He places God in your soul, and he also places God in your hand. The six-syllabled mantra, the supreme mantra, is its mantra. The dress – locks of hair, ashes and rudrashaka beads – place a man beyond the cycle of birth and death. It follows the path of liberation. (...) This path offers nothing less than liberation in this lifetime.\"\n\nSripati, a Virasaiva scholar, explained Basava's philosophy in \"Srikara Bhasya\", using the Vedanta Sutra, suggesting Basava's Lingayat theology to be a form of qualified nondualism, wherein the individual Atman (soul) is the body of God, and that there is no difference between Shiva and Atman (self, soul), Shiva is one's Atman, one's Atman is Shiva. Sripati's analysis places Basava's views in Vedanta school, in a form closer to the 11th century Vishishtadvaita philosopher Ramanuja, than to Advaita philosopher Adi Shankara. However, Sripati's analysis has been contested by other scholars.\n\nThe Lingayats, also known as \"Virasaivas\" or \"Veerasaivas\", traditionally believe that Basava was the founder of their tradition. However, modern scholarship relying on historical evidence such as the Kalachuri inscriptions state that Basava was the 12th-century poet philosopher who revived and energized an already existing tradition. The community he helped form is also known as the \"Sharanas\". The community is largely concentrated in Karnataka, but has migrated into other states of India as well as overseas. Towards the end of the 20th century, Michael estimates, one sixth of the population of the state of Karnataka, or about 10 million people, were Lingayat Hindus, or of the tradition championed by Basava.\n\nBasava advocated that every human being was equal, irrespective of caste, and that all forms of manual labor was equally important. Michael states that it wasn't birth but behavior that determined a true saint and Shaiva bhakta in the view of Basava and \"Sharanas\" community. This, writes Michael, was also the position of south Indian Brahmins, that it was \"behavior, not birth\" that determines the true Brahmin. One difference between the two was that Sharanas welcomed anyone, whatever occupation he or she might have been born in, to convert and be reborn into the larger family of Shiva devotees and then adopt any occupation he or she wanted.\n\nBasava is credited with uniting diverse spiritual trends during his era. Jan Peter Schouten states that \"Virashaivism\", the movement championed by Basava, tends towards monotheism with Shiva as the godhead, but with a strong awareness of the unity of the Ultimate Reality. Schouten calls this as a synthesis of Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita and Shankara's Advaita traditions, naming it \"Shakti-Vishishtadvaita\", that is monism fused with Shakti beliefs. An individual's spiritual progress is viewed by Basava's tradition as a six-stage \"Satsthalasiddhanta\", which progressively evolves the individual through phase of the devotee, to phase of the master, then phase of the receiver of grace, thereafter Linga in life breath (god dwells in his or her soul), the phase of surrender (awareness of no distinction in god and soul, self), to the last stage of complete union of soul and god (liberation, mukti). Basava's approach is different than Adi Shankara, states Schouten, in that Basava emphasizes the path of devotion, compared to Shankara's emphasis on the path of knowledge – a system of monistic Advaita philosophy widely discussed in Karnataka in the time of Basava.\n\nJessica Frazier et al. state that Basava laid the foundations of a movement that united \"Vedic with Tantric practice, and Advaitic monism with effusive Bhakti devotionalism.\"\n\nBasava advocated the wearing of \"Ishtalinga\", a necklace with pendant that contains a small Shiva linga. He was driven by his realisation; in one of his Vachanas he says \"Arive Guru\", which means one's own awareness is his/her teacher. Many contemporary Vachanakaras (people who have scripted Vachanas) have described him as \"Swayankrita Sahaja\", which means \"self-made\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is used by Buddhists throughout the world.\n\nThe flag was originally designed in 1885 by the Colombo Committee, in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The committee consisted of Ven. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera (chairman), Ven. Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera, Don Carolis Hewavitharana (father of Anagarika Dharmapala), Andiris Perera Dharmagunawardhana (maternal grandfather of Anagarika Dharmapala), Charles A. de Silva, Peter De Abrew, William De Abrew (father of Peter), H. William Fernando, N. S. Fernando and Carolis Pujitha Gunawardena (secretary).\n\nIt was first hoisted in public on Vesak day, 28 May 1885 at the Dipaduttamarama, Kotahena, by Ven. Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera. This was the first Vesak public holiday under British rule.\n\nColonel Henry Steel Olcott, an American journalist, founder and first president of the Theosophical Society, felt that its long streaming shape made it inconvenient for general use. He therefore suggested modifying it so that it was the size and shape of national flags.\n\nIn 1889 the modified flag was introduced to Japan by Anagarika Dharmapala and Olcott—who presented it to Emperor Meiji—and subsequently to Burma.\n\nAt the 1952 World Fellowship of Buddhists, the flag of Buddhists was adopted as the International Buddhist Flag.\n\nThe six vertical bands of the flag represent the six colors of the aura which Buddhists believe emanated from the body of the Buddha when he attained Enlightenment:\n\nBlue (\"Nīla\"): The Spirit of Universal Compassion\n\nYellow (\"Pīta\"): The Middle Way\n\nRed (\"Lohita\"): The Blessings of Practice – achievement, wisdom, virtue, fortune and dignity\n\nWhite (\"Odāta\"): The Purity of Dhamma – leading to liberation, timeless\n\nOrange (\"Manjesta\"): The Wisdom of the Buddha's teachings\n\nThe sixth vertical band, on the fly, is made up of a combination of rectangular bands of the five other colours, and represents a compound of the other five colours in the aura's spectrum. This compound colour is referred to as the Truth of the Buddha's teaching \"Pabbhassara \" ('essence of light').\n\nThe nonsectarian Buddhist flag is flown over the temples of many different schools. However, some choose to change the colors of the flag to emphasize their own teachings.\n\nIn 1963, the Catholic President of South Vietnam Ngo Dinh Diem invoked a law prohibiting flags other than that of the nation, to ban the Buddhist flag from being flown on Vesak, when Vatican flags had habitually flown at government events. This led to protests, which were ended by lethal firing of weapons, starting the Buddhist crisis.\n\n"}

{"id": "183232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=183232", "title": "Chaplain", "text": "Chaplain\n\nA chaplain is, traditionally, a cleric (such as a purohit, minister, priest, pastor, rabbi, or imam), or a lay representative of a religious tradition, attached to a secular institution such as a hospital, prison, military unit, school, business, police department, fire department, university, or private chapel.\n\nThough originally the word \"chaplain\" referred to representatives of the Christian faith, it is now also applied to people of other religions or philosophical traditions–such as the case of chaplains serving with military forces and an increasing number of chaplaincies at American universities. In recent times, many lay people have received professional training in chaplaincy and are now appointed as chaplains in schools, hospitals, companies, universities, prisons and elsewhere to work alongside, or instead of, official members of the clergy. The concepts of a \"multi-faith team\", \"secular\", \"generic\" and/or \"humanist\" chaplaincy are also gaining increasing use, particularly within healthcare and educational settings.\n\nSchool chaplains are a fixture in religious and, more recently, secular schools. In religious schools the role of the chaplain tends to be educational and liturgical. In secular schools the role of the chaplain tends to be that of a mentor and a provider of pastoral care services. Chaplains provide care for students by supporting them during times of crisis or need. Many chaplains run programs to promote the welfare of students, staff and parents including programs to help students deal with grief, anger or depression. Chaplains also build relationships with students by participating in extracurricular activities such as breakfast programs, lunchtime groups and sports groups. School chaplains can also liaise with external organisations providing support services for the school. With stagnant incomes and rising prices putting pressure on independent school budgets, cutting the post of school chaplain can seem an \"easy\" saving. Many schools now have pupil support departments with several mentors whose jobs are to look out for the pupils and always be there to help but they give no religious or spiritual guidance because of multiculturalism and diverse opinions on religion and beliefs. Chaplains have also been referred to as spiritual animators (also faith animators or pastoral animators) based on the French concept of \"animation spirituelle\" or spiritual care.\n\nIn Australia chaplains in state schools have, controversially, been funded by the federal government and local communities since 2007. Australian chaplains assist school communities to support the spiritual, social, and emotional well-being of their students. Chaplaincy services are provided by non denominational companies. there are 2339 chaplains working in Australian secular schools, along with 512 student welfare workers. Australian Schools will lose the option of appointing secular social workers under the national school chaplaincy program, for which the Abbott government has found an extra $245m in the 2014 budget funding.\n\nSimilarly, in Scotland the focus of school chaplaincy is on welfare and building positive relationships joining students on excursions and sharing meals. Chaplains are also non-denominational and act as a link between the school community and society. Like Australian chaplains it is expected that they will not proselytise. In Ireland chaplaincy takes a very different approach in which chaplains are expected to teach up to four hours of class instruction per week and are usually Catholic. Chaplaincy duties include visiting homes, religious services, retreats and celebrations, as well as counselling.\n\nFor higher education, chaplains are appointed by many colleges and universities, sometimes working directly for the institution, and sometimes as representatives of separate organizations that specifically work to support students, such as Hillel International for Jews or the Newman Centers for Catholics. In the United States, the National Association of College and University Chaplains works to support the efforts of many of these chaplains, helping chaplains minister to the individual faith of students, faculty, and staff, while promoting inter-religious understanding. Chaplains often also oversee programs on campus that foster spiritual, ethical, religious, and political and cultural exchange, and the promotion of service. Each day communities respond to numerous disasters or emergencies. Most often, these incidents are managed effectively at the local level. However, there are some incidents that may require a collaborative approach that includes personnel from: 1. Multiple jurisdictions, 2. A combination of specialties or disciplines, 3. Several levels of government, 4. Non-governmental organizations, and 5. The private sector. Chaplain Fellowship Disaster Response certifies first responder chaplain for crisis and disaster response.\n\nChaplains working with fire departments provide the same kind of support as do chaplains working with law enforcement, and sometimes face even greater danger, working with the wounded in often very dangerous surroundings.\n\nAt the scene of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City, for example, New York City Fire Department Chaplain Fr. Mychal F. Judge was killed by flying debris from the South Tower when he re-entered the lobby of the North Tower of the World Trade Center, shortly after administering last rites to a wounded firefighter.\n\nEnvironmental chaplaincy is an emerging field within chaplaincy. Environmental chaplains (also known as eco-chaplains, Earth chaplains, nature chaplains) provide spiritual care in a way that honors humanity's deep connection to the earth. Environmental chaplains hold many roles. They may support people working on the frontlines of issues like climate change or other environmental issues or they may support people impacted by industrial or other disasters by providing pastoral care, presence, and rituals. Environmental chaplains may also bear witness to the Earth itself and represent the merging of science and spirituality. Their role can be to \"usher in a new conscience and consciousness to find contentment, the appreciation of inner riches over outer wealth, quality over quantity\" using universally appreciated values, such as honesty and vision. Sarah Vekasi created a vision of eco-chaplaincy inspired by Joanna Macy's The Work that Reconnects, and saw eco-chaplaincy as a path to facilitating the \"Great Turning,\" which is described as the turning away from a business-as-usual way of being and turning toward a life-sustaining way that protects people and the planet \n\nMany hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and hospices employ chaplains to assist with the spiritual, religious, and emotional needs of patients, families and staff. Chaplains are often employed at residential care facilities for the elderly (RCFE) and skilled nursing facilities (SNF) as well. Chaplains care for people of all faiths and no faith. In mental health work, chaplains are highly skilled, working with other therapists as part of a multi-disciplinary team, especially where the patient's mental ill-health is associated with their religiosity, or where their mental well-being can be aided by spiritual care.\n\nIn the United States, health care chaplains who are board-certified have completed a minimum of four units of Clinical Pastoral Education training through The American Association of Pastoral Counselors, Association for Clinical Pastoral Education, Healthcare Chaplains Ministry Association, The Institute for Clinical Pastoral Training,; or The College of Pastoral Supervision and Psychotherapy and may be certified by one of the following organizations: The American Association of Pastoral Counselors, The Association of Professional Chaplains, The National Association of Catholic Chaplains, Neshama: Association of Jewish Chaplains (formerly The National Association of Jewish Chaplains), The Association of Certified Christian Chaplains, or The College of Pastoral Supervision and Psychotherapy. Certification typically requires a Masters of Divinity degree (or its equivalent), faith group ordination or commissioning, faith group endorsement, and four units (1600 hours) of Clinical Pastoral Education (the Military Chaplains Association of the United States of America does require more, but they are a dod2088 501c-3 military support group founded in 1954 by Military Chaplains).\n\nIn Canada, health care chaplains may be certified by the Canadian Association for Spiritual Care.\n\nIn the UK, health care chaplains are employed by their local NHS Trust (Health Boards in Scotland and Wales) or by charities associated with delivering health care such as a hospice or private hospital. The NHS in England publishes occasional guidance on chaplaincy practice. UK Chaplains are drawn from a range of faith and belief backgrounds, and are not necessarily ordained or a recognised faith leader. They may work on a full-time and part-time basis, and some work unpaid but with formal recognition for a faith or belief group regarding their training and status and may be termed \"honorary\" chaplain. The term \"Voluntary\" Chaplain is frowned on. The largest professional body for the UK is the College of Health Care Chaplains. Scotland historically had a distinct professional body, the Scottish Association of Chaplains in Healthcare (SACH) but this has since dissolved. Northern Ireland also has the Healthcare Chaplains Association. Membership of the College of Health Care Chaplains was historically not open to Catholic Priests as it carries with it the membership of the Unite Trade Union, but this changed in April 2018. Chaplains working in a palliative care setting may also choose to join the Association of Hospice and Palliative Care Chaplains. Other less formal networks also exist supporting Chaplaincy in Paediatric settings and GP based Chaplaincy.\n\nWithin the UK there is also the UK Board of Healthcare Chaplaincy (UKBHC) which has been set up in order to regulate the ministry and professional practice of health care chaplains. They publish a code of conduct which all registered chaplains are bound to abide by. The UKBHC has successfully applied to the Professional Standards Authority to be an accredited register of healthcare chaplains demonstrating that it meets the Authority's high standards in areas such as governance and training.\n\nPeer-reviewed journals that publish scholarly articles and research on healthcare chaplaincy include the \"Journal of Health Care Chaplaincy (USA)\", the international journal \"Health and Social Care Chaplaincy\" (UK) and the \"Journal of Religion and Health\" (US). It is unfortunate however that many countries do not have their own professional chaplaincy journal. Nevertheless this does not mean that chaplaincy research is being confounded. Within Australia and New Zealand for example, there have been numerous exploratory studies producing scholarly articles regarding the spiritual care work of health care chaplains. This research has considered the role of chaplains in areas such as: pain control, organ transplantation, abortion and withdrawal of life support. \n\nLaw enforcement or police chaplains work with and as part of local, regional, county, state, and national or federal law enforcement and provide a variety of services within the law enforcement community. They should not be confused with prison chaplains, whose primary ministry is to those who are incarcerated either awaiting trial or after conviction. The role of the law enforcement chaplain deals primarily with law enforcement personnel and agencies. The chaplain responds to these unique needs and challenges with religious guidance, reassuring and trustworthy presence, resources and counseling services. The law enforcement chaplain offers support to law enforcement officers, administrators, support staff, victims and their families, and occasionally even the families of accused or convicted offenders. Law enforcement chaplaincy is a ministry of presence and must have the proper training if they are working with law enforcement officers. Some ministries such as Chaplain Fellowship Ministries requires LEO chaplains to be certified in Public Safety Chaplaincy before becoming certified as a LEO chaplain. Most chaplains are uniformed and some may have a rank, they will always wear distinguishing insignia and/or markings to denote their chaplain rather than lawman status.\n\nMilitary chaplains provide pastoral, spiritual and emotional support for service personnel, including the conduct of religious services at sea, on bases or in the field. Military chaplains have a long history; the first English military-oriented chaplains, for instance, were priests on board proto-naval vessels during the 8th century. Land-based chaplains appeared during the reign of King Edward I. The current form of military chaplain dates from the era of the First World War.\n\nChaplains are nominated, appointed, or commissioned in different ways in different countries. A military chaplain can be an army-trained soldier with additional theological training or an ordained person nominated to the army by religious authorities. In the United Kingdom the Ministry of Defence employs chaplains but their authority comes from their sending church. Royal Navy chaplains undertake a 16-week bespoke induction and training course including a short course at Britannia Royal Naval College and specialist fleet time at sea alongside a more experienced chaplain. Naval chaplains called to service with the Royal Marines undertake a grueling five-month-long Commando Course and, if successful, wear the commandos' Green Beret. British Army chaplains undertake seven weeks training at the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre Amport House and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. Royal Air Force chaplains must complete a 12-week Specialist Entrant course at the RAF College Cranwell followed by the Chaplains' Induction Course at the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre Amport House of a further two weeks. The United States Navy will often give chaplain training to cadets seeking a theological route in the military. Additionally, they are granted instant employment as a Navy chaplain once ordained. Additionally, in the United States military, chaplains must be endorsed by their religious affiliation in order to serve in any facet of the military. In some cases, like that of the U.S. Navy, a Religious Program Specialist may be appointed to help alleviate some of the duties bestowed upon Naval chaplains.\n\nMilitary chaplains are normally accorded officer status, although Sierra Leone had a Naval Lance Corporal chaplain in 2001. In most navies, their badges and insignia do not differentiate their levels of responsibility and status. By contrast, in air forces and armies, they typically carry ranks and are differentiated by crosses or other equivalent religious insignia. However, United States military chaplains in every branch carry both rank and Chaplain Corps insignia.\n\nThough the Geneva Conventions does not state whether chaplains may bear arms, they specify (Protocol I, June 8, 1977, Art 43.2) that chaplains are non-combatants. In recent times both the UK and US have required chaplains, but not medical personnel, to be unarmed. Other nations, notably Norway, Denmark and Sweden, make it an issue of individual conscience. Captured chaplains are not considered Prisoners of War (Third Convention, August 12, 1949, Chapter IV Art 33) and must be returned to their home nation unless retained to minister to prisoners of war.\nInevitably, a significant number of serving chaplains have died in action. 100 chaplains of the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps were killed in action during World War II: a casualty rate greater \"than any other branch of the services except the infantry and the Army Air Corps\" (Crosby, 1994, pxxiii). Many have been decorated for bravery in action (five have won Britain's highest award for gallantry, the Victoria Cross). The Chaplain's Medal for Heroism is a special U.S. military decoration given to military chaplains who have been killed in the line of duty, although it has to date only been awarded to the famous Four Chaplains, all of whom died in the sinking in 1943 after giving up their lifejackets to others. In addition to these, five other U.S. chaplains have been awarded the Medal of Honor: Chaplain (LCDR) Joseph T. O'Callahan, USN (World War II); Chaplain (CPT) Emil Kapaun, USA (Posthumous, Korean War); Chaplain (LT) Vincent Capodanno, USN (Posthumous, Vietnam War); Chaplain (MAJ) Charles J. Watters, USA (Posthumous, Vietnam War); and Chaplain (CPT) Angelo J. Liteky, USA (Vietnam). (Later in life, Liteky changed his name to Charles, left the Catholic priesthood, became an anti-war activist, and renounced his Medal of Honor). Chaplain Fellowship Ministries military chaplains are nondenominational. To be considered for appointment to serve as a military chaplain, candidates must first be ordained and have an ecclesiastical endorsement by a valid religious faith group recognized by the Department of Defense. Candidates must meet all DOD requirements. The Chaplain Fellowship had military chaplains serving in Iraq and now in Afghanistan.\n\nIn 2006, training materials obtained by U.S. intelligence showed that insurgent snipers fighting in Iraq were urged to single out and attack engineers, medics, and chaplains on the theory that those casualties would demoralize entire enemy units.\n\nThe United States European Command has co-sponsored an annual International Military Chiefs of Chaplains Conference every year since 1991.\n\nAt times, the existence of military chaplains has been challenged in countries that have a separation of Church and State.\n\nSome chaplains use live music as a therapeutic tool. Music can aid in healing, access core faith and emotions, and help to build rapport in the chaplaincy relationship.\n\nMusical bands (especially Christian groups) may bring a chaplain with them to conduct services while they are on tour. There can also be chaplains who minister to concert-goers at music festivals.\n\nSome nations, including the United States and the United Kingdom, have chaplains appointed to work with parliamentary bodies, such as the Chaplain of the United States Senate, the Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives, and Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons. In addition to opening proceedings with prayer, these chaplains provide pastoral counseling to congressional members, their staffs, and their families; coordinate the scheduling of guest chaplains, who offer opening prayers; arrange and sometimes conduct marriages, memorial services, and funeral services for congress, staff, and their families; and conduct or coordinate religious services, study groups, prayer meetings, holiday programs, and religious education programs, as well.\n\nPrison chaplains can be a \"safety valve, through listening and pro-social intervention\" in potentially explosive situations. They also reduce recidivism by linking offenders to positive community resources, and in the work they do to help offenders change their hearts, minds and directions.\nRabbi Philip R. Alstat (1891–1976), who—in addition to work as a chaplain in New York hospitals and senior citizen facilities—served for three decades as the Jewish chaplain for \"The Tombs\", the Manhattan Detention Facility, once described his service as follows: \"My goals are the same as those of the prison authorities—to make better human beings. The only difference is that their means are discipline, security, and iron bars.\nMine are the spiritual ministrations that operate with the mind and the heart.\"\n\nIn Canada in 2013, a $2 million contract for chaplaincy services for federal prisons was awarded to Kairos Pneuma Chaplaincy Inc., a company newly formed by five current and former federal prison chaplains. About \"2,500 volunteers, many of them of minority faiths, would also continue providing services.\" There has however, been very little research looking at the role of chaplains and/or volunteers working within correctional facilities. One of the first qualitative exploratory studies into prison chaplaincy was by Dr. Lindsay Carey and Dr. Laura Chahda (La Trobe University, Australia) who identified that the role of chaplains was important in helping inmates to cope during their custodial period and for those prisoners being 'discharged' back into the community. The research also identified however, that there were a number of barriers that thwarted chaplains from being efficient in helping to rehabilitate prisoners - and thus also effected the personal development of prisoners and challenged the effectiveness of government rehabilitative goals. \n\nA sports chaplain provides pastoral care for the sports person and the broader sports community including the coach, administrators and their families.\n\nChaplains to sports communities have existed since the middle of the 20th century and have significantly grown in the past 20 years. The United States, United Kingdom and Australia have well established Christian sports chaplaincy ministries.\n\nSports chaplains consist of people from many different walks of life. Most commonly, the chaplains are ministers or full-time Christian workers but occasionally, chaplaincy work is done without charge or any financial remuneration. Often, sports chaplains to a particular sport are former participants of that sport. This helps the chaplain to not only provide spiritual support and guidance to a player, but also to give them the ability to empathize and relate to some of the challenges facing the participant with whom they are ministering.\n\nVeterinary chaplains serve people and their animals, ministering with regards to the spirituality associated with animals and their connections with humans. A major function is grief support and prayer. Other services include hospice support while animals are cared for near the end of their lives; support in animal health crises, including at the veterinary hospital; conducting services for animal blessings, naming/adopting ceremonies, and end of life celebration ceremonies. Veterinary chaplains may also offer sermons and spiritual guidance on the human/animal bond and our responsibilities toward animals; and some may visit nursing homes and hospitals with therapeutic animal assistants. Other veterinary chaplains may provide blessings for animal care workers; assist with human/animal communication; and offer alternative healing for animals such as animal Reiki or acupuncture. Reiki.\n\nThe Emerson Theological Institute, headquartered in Oakhurst, California, and working within the New Thought spiritual approach, offers degree programs up to the doctorate level in Humane Religious Studies, the cornerstone of which is a veterinary chaplain program. The Animal Ministry Institute (AMI), run by the Rev. Paula T. Webb, also offers an online chaplain program for continuing education but without college credit. A less formal online certificate program is offered by the Rev. Karen j Kobrin Cohen, a veterinary chaplain based in Florida.\nA colonial chaplain was appointed to a colony. The term is commonly used to refer to the chaplain appointed as a non-military chaplain to one of the Crown Colonies from the late 18th century or early 19th century. Richard Johnson (1756–1827) was the first colonial chaplain appointed to the new prison colony at New South Wales in 1786.\n\nSome businesses, large or small, employ chaplains for their staff and/or clientele. Services provided may include employee assistance and counseling services; wellness seminars; conflict management and mediation; leadership and management development; and trauma/serious incident response. In 2007, 4,000 corporate chaplains were reported to be working in the U.S., with the majority being employees of specialist chaplaincy companies such as Marketplace Chaplains USA and Corporate Chaplains of America. In 2014, Marketplace Chaplains USA reported employing over 2,800 chaplains in 44 states and over 960 cities. The organization added an international arm in 2006; Marketplace Chaplains International serves Canada, the U.K., Mexico and Puerto Rico. Capellania Empresarial provides corporate chaplaincy services in Paraguay. Chaplains without Borders has been providing corporate and other chaplaincy services in Australia since 2005.\n\nWorking on board cruise ships, cruise chaplains provide pastoral and spiritual support to both passengers and crew members. With the co-operation of cruise companies, chaplains normally stay on board for the specific duration of a cruise. Catholic seafarers' charity Apostleship of the Sea currently deploys chaplains on board P&O Cruises and Cunard Line ships during the Christmas and Easter periods. While ministering to passengers are part of Apostleship of the Sea's chaplains role, their main focus is the welfare of the crew, who can often spend many months at sea away from home.\n\nA domestic chaplain was a chaplain attached to a noble household in order to grant the family a degree of self-sufficiency in religion. The chaplain was freed from any obligation to reside in a particular place so could travel with the family, internationally if necessary, and minister to their spiritual needs. Further, the family could appoint a chaplain who reflected their own doctrinal views. Domestic chaplains performed family christenings, funerals and weddings and were able to conduct services in the family's private chapel, excusing the nobility from attending public worship.\n\nIn feudal times most laymen, and for centuries even most noblemen, were poorly educated and the chaplain would also be an important source of scholarship in the household, tutoring children and providing counsel to the family on matters broader than religion. Before the advent of the legal profession, modern bureaucracy and civil service, the literate clergy were often employed as secretarial staff, as in a chancery. Hence the term \"clerk\", derived from Latin \"clericus\" (clergyman). This made them very influential in temporal affairs. There was also a moral impact since they heard the confessions of the elite.\n\nThe domestic chaplain was an important part of the life of the peerage in England from the reign of Henry VIII to the middle of the 19th century. Up until 1840, Anglican domestic chaplains were regulated by law and enjoyed the substantial financial advantage of being able to purchase a license to hold two benefices simultaneously while residing in neither.\n\nMany monarchies and major noble houses had, or still have, several domestic or private chaplains as part of their Ecclesiastical Household, either following them or attached to a castle or other residence. Queen Elizabeth II has 36 Anglican chaplains, in addition to chaplains extraordinary and honorary chaplains appointed to minister to her. Castles with attached chaplains generally had at least one Chapel Royal, sometimes as significant as a cathedral. A modern example is St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, also the home of the Order of the Garter.\n\nThere are also chaplains to private clubs, television or radio stations, family, community teams, groups such as Boys and Girls Brigade companies and Scout troops, airports, cruise ships, nightclubs, the internet including Facebook (see \"Internet Chapel\" in Facebook) and theaters.\n\nThe term can also refer to priests attached to Roman Catholic convents. There is also the position of Chaplain of His Holiness, a title granted by the Pope to certain priests who become part of the Papal Household and work with the Papal Chapel. Prior to 1968 they were called Supernumerary Privy Chamberlains.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19881422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19881422", "title": "Conversion of Chełm Eparchy", "text": "Conversion of Chełm Eparchy\n\nThe Conversion of Chełm Eparchy, which occurred from January to May 1875, refers to the generally forced conversion of the last Uniate Eparchy in the Russian Empire, which was centered in the city of Chełm (\"Kholm\") in Congress Poland, to the Orthodox faith.\n\nIn 988 East Slavic state of Kievan Rus' was converted to the Eastern form of Christianity by Vladimir I of Kiev. Following the East-West Schism between the Roman and Byzantine Churches, the form of Christianity that Kievan Rus followed became known as Eastern Orthodox Church. In 1241, Kievan Rus was conquered by the Mongols. Over the centuries, the parts of Rus that would one day become Ukraine and Belarus were absorbed by the Poland. Within the mostly Roman Catholic Polish state, the native Orthodox population and Church of the former lands of Ruthenia were pressured to transfer their allegiance from the Patriarch of Constantinople to the Pope of Rome. Between 1595-1596, the Union of Brest saw the creation of the Uniate Church (later the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church) in Ruthenia. Like other Eastern Catholic Churches, the Uniate Church maintained the liturgical, theological and devotional traditions of the Orthodox Church despite its new allegiance to Rome.\n\nAs the Russian Empire gained the territories along its western frontier through a series of wars and Partitions of Poland that lasted from the 17th through the end of the eighteenth centuries, the Uniate Church was partly incorporated into the state Russian Orthodox Church, and in 1839 abolished altogether by the act of the Synod of Polotsk. However, the latter event did not affect the Eparchy of Chelm. Thus after the November Uprising in 1831, the Synod of Polotsk which disestablished the Uniate church outside the Kingdom of Poland did not affect Eparchy of Chełm.\n\nThe greater longevity of the Uniate Church in this region was attributed to several factors. The Eparchy's territory came under Russian control later than did any other Uniate territories ultimately absorbed by Russia (1815 unlike 1795). During the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, it was granted to Austria. Only two decades later, after the Russian victory in the Napoleonic Wars did it become part of Russia. Also, unlike other Uniate regions within the Russian Empire, it had been part of the autonomous Congress Poland. Another factor affecting the Uniate Church's longevity was its deep roots in the local population, which unlike other Uniate territory was deeply mixed with Poles and Ukrainians both ethnically and culturally. Both groups in the Chełm region tended to view the Russian authorities as their mutual enemy. The Tsarist pressure on the Polish population, was also applied differently than that on right-bank of the Bug. The use of Polish hymns, organs, and rosaries within the Uniate eparchy was considered a matter of pride, and attempts by Russian officials to curtail their use were defiantly ignored.\n\nIn contrast to the pro-Polish attitude of many of Chełm's Uniate parishioners and clergy, during the mid-nineteenth century the Uniate Church of neighboring Galicia was dominated by anti-Polish Russophiles (for more information about them, see Ukrainian Russophiles) Galician Russophile priests, recruited in Vienna by the Russian embassy and in Lviv by Yakiv Holovatsky, the Russophile president of the University, were encouraged to accept posts in Chełm by the Russian government, which provided them with higher salaries and more prestigious positions than they could expect in Galicia itself. The newcomers were often opposed by the local people of Chełm, and petitions to the last Uniate Bishop complained of \"Galician wolves\". The Russophile Galician priests would play a major role in the conversion of Chełm Eparchy.\n\nBy the end of the 1860s, political circumstances had changed. In 1865, following a failed uprising against Russia by Poles, the autonomous Congress Poland was abolished. After having struggled with Russian authorities, the Uniate bishop Mikhail Kuzemsky issued a letter of resignation and left Chełm. His resignation was not accepted by the Vatican, while the Russian authorities appointed a Galician Russophile priest, Markell Popel, as administrator of the Eparchy, despite Popel living in open concubinage.\n\nThe Conversion to Orthodoxy was immediately preceded by the \"purification\" the Chełm eparchy of all Latin rituals from the Liturgy, ordered by Popel in October 1873. Initially, it was ignored by many priests, until the Russian state ordered them to sign a declaration that they would abide by the new rules by the New Year of 1874. Over twenty priests refused, and were either arrested or escaped to Galicia. Resistance to the changes was widespread among the people, particularly in the northern areas of the eparchy. In numerous parishes, the priests attempting to implement the reforms were dragged out of the church or their belongings were packed outside the rectory. Russian police and Cossacks were used to force the parishioners to accept the new rules; parishioners were sometimes beaten or shot. The struggle over ritual has been described as being comparable to that of the Old Believer schism, and one case of self-immolation was recorded.\n\nThe purification having been completed by the end of 1874, from January 1875 until May of that year all of the parishes proclaimed their union with the Orthodox Church. The Uniate eparchy was dissolved and incorporated into the newly created Orthodox eparchy of Chełm and Warsaw, with Bishop Popel becoming suffragan bishop of Lublin resident in Chełm. The Chełm clergy was purged of most of its native priests, who were replaced by emigrating anti-Polish Russophile priests from eastern Galicia. In March 1881, out of 291 Orthodox priests in the former eparchy, 95 were native Chełm priests who had converted, 53 were Orthodox priests who had moved into the Eparchy from elsewhere, and 143 were Galicians. Sixty-six native Chełm priests who refused to convert fled to Galicia, 74 were exiled to Russia proper or imprisoned, and seven died as martyrs. During the struggle over purification and conversion, a total of 600 faithful were deported and 108 lost their lives.\n\nIn Galicia, the forced conversion of Chełm was met with support on the part of the Russophiles and indifference among other segments of the Ukrainian population. Despite their opposition to the Russophiles, Galician Ukrainophiles were themselves supportive of Purification of Latin rituals and unsympathetic to the pro-Polish Chełm priests. The Russophiles succeeded in preventing most exiled priests from Chełm from obtaining positions in Galician Uniate parishes.\n\nThe unpopularity of the conversion within Chełm had been strong enough that when, a generation later in 1905, following the Russian Revolution of 1905 in which the Tsar issued a series of liberalisation policies under which the formally Orthodox population of Chełm was allowed to return to Catholicism, 170,000 out of 450,000 Orthodox did so by 1908 despite the Russian authorities only allowing conversion to the Latin Rite.\n\nIn 1912 the Imperial authorities created a new Kholm Governorate, split from Congress Poland, to facilitate Russification and conversion of the non-Eastern Orthodox Christians.\n\nFollowing World War I, Chełm was incorporated into the Second Polish Republic and this time the Orthodox population was persecuted, bearing the brunt of Polonization efforts. After World War II, Chełm was retained by the Polish People's Republic and, by irony, today it is a strong centre for the non-Galician Ukrainian culture and the Polish Orthodox Church. According to Tomaszewski and Gil some of the Ukrainians opposed the conversion and Polonized.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49638074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49638074", "title": "Daniel E. Fleming", "text": "Daniel E. Fleming\n\nDaniel Edward Fleming is an American biblical scholar and Assyriologist whose work centers on Hebrew Bible interpretation and cultural history, ancient Syria, Emar, ancient religion, and the interplay of ancient Near Eastern societies. Since 1990, he has served as a professor of Hebrew Bible and Ancient Near Eastern Studies in the Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies at New York University, where he has spent his whole career.\n\nFleming received his B.A. at Stanford University in 1979 and his Master of Divinity from Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary in 1985 before earning his doctoral degree in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations from Harvard University in 1990. After receiving his Ph.D., he was immediately appointed to the Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies at New York University. Fleming is a recipient of the Guggenheim Fellowship (2004–05), the American Council of Learned Societies Fellowship (2004–05), Senior Fulbright Fellowship to France (1997–98) and the National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Stipend (1991). He currently serves as a Senior Fellow for the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University. He also serves on the editorial board for \"The World of the Bible\".\n\nFleming works broadly in ancient Near Eastern history, with anchors especially in second-millennium Syria and the first-millennium Levant as a matrix for ancient Israel and the Hebrew Bible. His research involves straddling two separate and sometimes territorial disciplines: Assyriology and biblical studies—both defined by written evidence that must be placed in context based on archaeological and visual sources as well. His framework for treating these domains as part of a whole is ultimately historical, and Fleming's individual projects have probed various aspects of the social fabric and political patterns that characterize the region in broad terms.\n\nIn his 2012 monograph \"The Legacy of Israel in Judah's Bible: History, Politics, and the Reinscribing of Tradition\", Fleming puts forth a new theory and methodology for Hebrew Bible scholarship: isolating a tentative repertoire of Israelite traditions that can then be compared with external sources of historical evidence. After letting his theory serve as a catalyst for his doctoral students' research for several years, the publication set a new agenda for future engagement of ancient Israel and Hebrew Bible scholarship with wider study of antiquity. According to Fleming, his theory:\n\nultimately attempts to bridge between the worlds of biblical scholarship and archaeologically based history ... It addresses the structure and character of the Bible's primary narrative through [his] vision of a particular relationship between a hodgepodge of lore about early Israel that has been taken over and recast radically by generations of scribes from Judah. This Israelite lore, when considered on its own, presents a picture of ancient Israel that contrasts sufficiently with standard \"biblical\" schemes as to provoke reevaluation of what the Bible may offer historical investigation. It is [his] hope that by taking ever more seriously the biblical division between what comes from the distinct peoples of Israel and Judah, the character of each will come into sharper relief.\n\nFleming's work has received advanced praise among senior biblical scholars. David M. Carr writes that the monograph is \"one of the most important books published in biblical studies in the last decade.\" Israel Finkelstein calls the book \"a classic—a must for anyone interested in the Bible and the history of Ancient Israel.\" According to Mark S. Smith, Fleming's work \"is a superb piece of scholarship,\" which \"no professor or graduate student interested in the Hebrew Bible or ancient Israel can do without.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The state religion is Islam. The Government prohibits conversion from Islam and proselytization of Muslims.\n\nIn June 2006 the Government published the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) in the Official Gazette, which, according to Article 93.2 of the Constitution, gives the Covenant the force of law. Article 18 of the ICCPR provides for freedom of religion (See Legal and policy framework). Despite this positive development, restrictions and some abuses continued. Members of unrecognized religious groups and converts from Islam face legal discrimination and bureaucratic difficulties in personal status cases. Converts from Islam additionally risk the loss of civil rights. Shari'a courts have the authority to prosecute proselytizers.\n\nRelations between Muslims and Christians generally are good; however, adherents of unrecognized religions and Muslims who convert to other faiths face societal discrimination. Prominent societal leaders took steps to promote religious freedom.\n\nThe country has an area of and a population of 6.05 million. More than 92 percent of the population is Sunni Muslim. Official government figures estimate that Christians make up 6 percent of the population; however, government and Christian officials privately estimate the figure to be closer to 4 percent. According to representatives of the respective communities and newspaper reports, there are between twelve and fourteen thousand Druze, a small number of Shi'a Muslims, and approximately one thousand Bahá'ís. There are no statistics available regarding the number of persons who are not adherents of any religious faith.\n\nOfficially recognized Christian denominations include the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Greek Catholic (Melkite), Armenian Orthodox, Maronite Catholic, Assyrian, Coptic, Anglican, Lutheran, Seventh-day Adventist, United Pentecostal, Latter-day Saints, and Presbyterian churches. Other Christian groups include the Free Evangelicals, the Church of the Nazarene, the Assembly of God, and the Christian and Missionary Alliance. There are a number of Chaldean and Syriac Christians and Shi'a among the estimated 250,000 to 450,000 Iraqis in the country, many of whom are undocumented or on visitor permits.\n\nWith few exceptions, there are no major geographic concentrations of religious minorities. The cities of Husn, in the north, and Fuheis, near Amman, are predominantly Christian. Madaba and Karak, both south of Amman, also have significant Christian populations. The northern part of the city of Azraq has a sizable Druze population, as does Umm Al-Jamal in the governorate of Mafraq. There also are Druze populations in Amman and Zarka and a smaller number in Irbid and Aqaba. There are a number of nonindigenous Shi'a living in the Jordan Valley and the south. The Druze are registered as \"Muslims\" and, as they have their own court in Al Azraq, can administer their own personal status matters.\n\nForeign missionaries operate in the country.\n\nAccording to US Department of State's Human Rights Reports in 2015 legal and societal discrimination and harassment remained a problem for religious minorities, and religious converts.\n\nThe Constitution provides for the freedom to practice the rites of one's religion and faith in accordance with the customs that are observed in the kingdom, unless they violate public order or morality. According to the Constitution the state religion is Islam and the King must be Muslim. The Government prohibits conversion from Islam and proselytization of Muslims.\n\nThe Constitution, in Articles 103-106, provides that matters concerning the personal status of Muslims are the exclusive jurisdiction of Shari'a courts which apply Shari'a law in their proceedings. Personal status includes religion, marriage, divorce, child custody, and inheritance. Personal status law follows the guidelines of the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence, which is applied to cases that are not explicitly addressed by civil status legislation. Matters of personal status of non-Muslims whose religion is recognized by the Government are the jurisdiction of Tribunals of Religious Communities, according to Article 108.\n\nThere is no provision for civil marriage or divorce. Some Christians are unable to divorce under the legal system because they are subject to their denomination's religious court system, which does not allow divorce. Such individuals sometimes convert to another Christian denomination or to Islam to divorce legally.\n\nThe head of the department that manages Shari'a court affairs (a cabinet-level position) appoints Shari'a judges, while each recognized non-Muslim religious community selects the structure and members of its own tribunal. All judicial nominations are approved by the Prime Minister and commissioned officially by royal decree. The Protestant denominations registered as \"societies\" come under the jurisdiction of one of the recognized Protestant church tribunals. There are no tribunals assigned for atheists or adherents of unrecognized religions such as the Bahá'í Faith. Such individuals must request one of the recognized courts to hear their personal status cases.\n\nShari'a is applied in all matters relating to family law involving Muslims or the children of a Muslim father, and all citizens, including non-Muslims, are subject to Islamic legal provisions regarding inheritance. According to the law, all minor children of male citizens who convert to Islam are considered to be Muslim. Adult children of a male Christian who has converted to Islam become ineligible to inherit from their father if they do not also convert to Islam. In cases in which a Muslim converts to Christianity, the authorities do not recognize the conversion as legal, and the individual continues to be treated as a Muslim in matters of family and property law.\n\nWhile Christianity is a recognized religion and non-Muslim citizens may profess and practice the Christian faith, churches must be accorded legal recognition through administrative procedures in order to own land and administer sacraments, including marriage. Churches and other religious institutions can receive official recognition by applying to the Prime Ministry. The Prime Minister unofficially confers with an interfaith council of clergy representing officially registered local churches on all matters relating to the Christian community, including the registration of new churches. The Government refers to the following criteria when considering official recognition of Christian churches: the faith must not contradict the nature of the Constitution, public ethics, customs, or traditions; it must be recognized by the Middle East Council of Churches; the faith must not oppose the national religion; and the group must include some citizen adherents. Groups that the Government deems to engage in practices that violate the law and the nature of society or threaten the stability of public order are prohibited; however, there were no reports of banned religious groups. The Government does not interfere with public worship by the country's Christian minority.\n\nRecognized non-Muslim religious institutions do not receive subsidies; they are financially and administratively independent of the Government and are tax-exempt. The Free Evangelicals, the Church of the Nazarene, the Assembly of God, and the Christian and Missionary Alliance, are registered with the Ministry of Interior as \"societies\" but not as churches\n\nPublic schools provide mandatory religious instruction for all Muslim students. Christian students are not required to attend courses that teach Islam. The Constitution provides that congregations have the right to establish schools for the education of their own communities \"provided that they comply with the general provisions of the law and are subject to government control in matters relating to their curriculums and orientation.\"\n\nIn June 2006 the Government published the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in the Official Gazette. According to Article 93.2 of the Constitution, acts published in the Official Gazette attain force of law. Article 18 of the Covenant states that everyone shall have the \"right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion,\" including freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom \"to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice, and teaching.\" Additionally, the Covenant stipulates that no one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice. The country ratified the ICCPR without reservations in 1976. However, Article 2, Section 2 of the ICCPR states that the Covenant is not self-executing, and requires implementing legislation to give the Covenant effect. By the end of the reporting period, no such legislation had been proposed. Nevertheless, a senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the ICCPR's publication in the Official Gazette signifies that the Government considers the Covenant as a source of law alongside domestic law, including the Constitution and Shari'a (Islamic law). Articles 103-106 of the Constitution still provide that matters concerning the personal status of Muslims, including religion, are the exclusive jurisdiction of Shari'a courts which apply Shari'a (Hanafi) in their proceedings.\n\nThe government-sponsored Royal Institute for Inter-Faith Studies organized several conferences and seminars to support its effort to provide a venue in the Arab world for the interdisciplinary study and rational discussion of religion and religious issues, with particular reference to Christianity in Arab and Islamic society. These included an international conference in January 2007 to debate a common approach to reform in different religious traditions, a February 2007 seminar that addressed the role of religious traditions in the context of social and political modernization, and an April 2007 conference entitled \"The ‘Universal' in Human Rights: A Precondition for a Dialogue of Cultures.\"\n\nEid al-Adha, Eid al-Fitr, the birth of the Prophet Muhammad, the Prophet's Ascension, the Islamic New Year, Christmas, and the Gregorian calendar New Year are celebrated as national holidays. Christians may request leave for other Christian holidays approved by the local Council of Bishops such as Easter and Palm Sunday.\n\nThere were no reports that the practice of any faith was prohibited; however, the Government does not officially recognize all religious groups. Some religious groups, while allowed to meet and practice their faith, faced societal and official discrimination. In addition, not all Christian denominations have applied for or been accorded legal recognition.\n\nThe Government does not recognize the Druze or Baha'i Faiths as religions but does not prohibit their practice. The Druze do not face official discrimination nor do they complain of social discrimination. Baha'is face both official and social discrimination. The Baha'i community does not have its own court to adjudicate personal status matters, such as inheritance and other family-related issues; such cases may be heard in Shari'a courts. Baha'i spouses face difficulty in obtaining residency permits for their non-Jordanian partners because the Government does not recognize Baha'i marriage certificates. The Government does not officially recognize the Druze temple in Azraq, and four social halls belonging to the Druze are registered as \"societies.\" The Government does not permit Baha'is to register schools or places of worship. The Baha'i cemetery in Adasieh is registered in the name of the Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs.\n\nEmployment applications for government positions occasionally contain questions about an applicant's religion. Christians serve regularly as cabinet ministers. Of the 120 seats of the lower house of Parliament, 9 are reserved for Christians. No seats are reserved for adherents of other religious groups. No seats are reserved for Druze, but they are permitted to hold office under their government classification as Muslims.\n\nThe Government does not recognize Jehovah's Witnesses, or the Church of Christ, but each is allowed to conduct religious services without interference.\n\nThe Government recognizes Judaism as a religion; however, there are reportedly no citizens who are Jewish. The Government does not impose restrictions on Jews, and they are permitted to own property and conduct business in the country.\n\nBecause Shari'a governs the personal status of Muslims, converting from Islam to Christianity and proselytism of Muslims are not allowed. Muslims who convert to another religion face societal and governmental discrimination. Under Shari'a, converts are regarded as apostates and may be denied their civil and property rights. The Government maintains it neither encourages nor prohibits apostasy. The Government does not recognize converts from Islam as falling under the jurisdiction of their new religious community's laws in matters of personal status; converts are still considered Muslims. Converts to Islam fall under the jurisdiction of Shari'a courts. Shari'a, in theory, provides for the death penalty for Muslims who apostatize; however, the Government has never applied such punishment. The Government allows conversion to Islam.\n\nThere is no statute that expressly forbids proselytism of Muslims; however, government policy requires that foreign missionary groups refrain from public proselytism.\n\nThe Jordan Evangelical Theological Seminary (JETS), a Christian training school for pastors and missionaries, was registered with the Government and operates as a cultural center. JETS purchased land to build a new facility in 2003 and received permits to construct the buildings in September 2006. JETS is permitted to appoint faculty and administration, but the Government denies accreditation as an academic institution. Because JETS is not accredited, its students are not eligible for student visas but may enter the country on tourist visas of limited duration. The JETS program requires four years of study, and as a consequence many students overstay their visas; upon departure from the country they, and any family members who may have accompanied them, are required to pay two dollars for each day they spent without a visa (as are other visiting foreign nationals). The Government does not allow JETS to accept Muslim students.\n\nAccording to JETS, during the reporting period the Government revoked JETS's nonprofit status, requiring the organization to pay 16 percent sales tax on all items purchased. In 2006 the Customs office confiscated a shipment of approximately 100 books ordered by JETS. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs intervened and secured the release of the books.\n\nParliamentary elections law historically has under represented urban areas that are centers of support for Islamist candidates.\n\nThe Political Parties Law prohibits houses of worship from being used for political activity. This stipulation was designed primarily to prevent government opponents from preaching politically oriented sermons in mosques.\n\nThe Ministry of Religious Affairs and Trusts (\"Awqaf\") manages Islamic institutions and the construction of mosques. It also appoints imams, provides mosque staff salaries, manages Islamic clergy training centers, and subsidizes certain activities sponsored by mosques. The Government monitors sermons at mosques and requires that preachers refrain from political commentary that could instigate social or political unrest.\n\nFollowing the Summer 2006 Lebanon war, some Sunnis in the country reportedly converted to Shi'ism. In November 2006 the Government reportedly deported some Iraqi Shi'ites for practicing self-flagellation rituals at a Shi'ite shrine outside Amman. Some Sunni clerics alleged that Iraqi Shi'ites could be Iranian agents, and some sources reported that the alleged deportations were a result of Shi'a proselytizing. The credibility of these reports was not verified. The Government permits Shi'ites to worship but not to self-mutilate or to shed blood, as may occur in some Shi'ite ceremonies.\n\nIn January 2006 Jihad Al-Momani, former chief editor of the weekly newspaper Shihan, and Hussein Al-Khalidi, of the weekly Al Mihar, were arrested for printing controversial cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad. On February 5, 2006, the two men were charged by the Conciliation Court and the Court of First Instance with \"denigrating the Prophets in public\" and \"insulting God.\" In May 2006 they received the minimum prison sentence of two months, but were immediately released on bail with the possibility that the sentences would be commuted to a light fine of $170 (JD 120) each.\n\nDruze, Baha'is, and members of other unrecognized religious groups do not have their religious affiliations correctly noted on their national identity cards or \"family books\" (the family book is a national registration record that is issued to the head of every family and that serves as proof of citizenship). Baha'is have an \"assembly\" which officiates marriages; however, the Department of Civil Status and Passports (DCSP) does not recognize marriages conducted by Baha'i assemblies, and will not issue birth certificates for the children of these marriages or residence permits for partners who are not citizens. The DCSP issues passports on the basis of these marriages, but without entering the marriage into official records. The DCSP frequently records Baha'is and Druze as Muslims on identifying documents. Atheists must associate themselves with a recognized religion for purposes of official identification.\n\nThe Government traditionally reserves some positions in the upper levels of the military for Christians (4 percent); however, all senior command positions are held by Muslims. Division-level commanders and above are required to lead Islamic prayer on certain occasions. There is no Christian clergy in the military.\n\nOn April 29, 2007, government authorities reportedly deported Pastor Mazhar Izzat Bishay of the Aqaba Free Evangelical Church, an Egyptian national and long-time resident, to Egypt. It was reported that they had previously interrogated him and that they offered him no reason for his deportation. At the end of the reporting period, the credibility of these reports had not been verified.\n\nIn November 2006 the authorities deported Wajeeh Besharah, Ibrahim Atta, Raja Welson, Imad Waheeb, four Coptic Egyptians living in Aqaba, to Egypt. It was reported that the authorities questioned them about their affiliation with the Free Evangelical Church in Aqaba prior to their deportation. At the end of the reporting period, the credibility of this report had not been verified.\n\nOn January 20, 2006, a Shari'a court received an apostasy complaint against Mahmoud Abdel Rahman Mohammad Eleker, a convert from Islam to Christianity. On April 14, 2006, the complainant, the convert's brother-in-law, dropped the charges after the convert's wife renounced in the presence of a lawyer any claims she might have to an inheritance from her own parents. At the end of the reporting period, there was no further update on this case.\n\nIn September 2004, on the order of a Shari'a court, the authorities arrested a convert from Islam to Christianity and held him overnight on charges of apostasy. In November 2004 a Shari'a court found the defendant guilty of apostasy. The ruling was upheld in January 2005 by a Shari'a appeals court. The verdict declared the convert to be a ward of the state, stripped him of his civil rights, and annulled his marriage. It further declared him to be without any religious identity. It stated that he lost all rights to inheritance and may not remarry his (now former) wife unless he returns to Islam, and forbade his being considered an adherent of any other religion. The verdict implies the possibility that legal and physical custody of his child could be assigned to someone else. The convert left the country, received refugee status, and was resettled in the United States.\n\nThere were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees who remained in custody at the end of the period covered by this report.\n\nThere were no reports of forced religious conversion, including of U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States.\n\nEditorial cartoons, articles, and opinion pieces with antisemitic themes occur with less frequency in the government controlled media, but are more common and feature more prominently in privately owned weekly tabloids such as al-Sabil an al-Rai\n\nOn December 26, 2006, King Abdullah II convened his first meeting with evangelical leaders. Attendees reported that this event offered a sense of hope and progress towards continued interfaith dialogue.\n\nThe Baptist Church applied for official registration with the Ministry of Interior on December 12, 2006. In June 2006 the Prime Ministry denied the Church's application. No additional information regarding the reason for denial was available by the end of the reporting period. The Assemblies of God Church also applied for official registration with the Ministry of Interior on April 10, 2007. Its application was under consideration at the end of the period covered by this report.\n\nIn June 2006 the Government published the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in the Official Gazette. Article 18 of the Covenant provides for freedom of religion.\n\nBaha'is faced some societal discrimination.\n\nMuslims who convert to other religions often face social ostracism, threats, and abuse from their families and Muslim religious leaders. According to the survey in 2010 by the Pew Global Attitudes Project, 86% of Jordanians polled supported the death penalty for those who leave the Muslim religion.\n\nParents usually strongly discourage young adults from pursuing interfaith romantic relationships, because they may lead to conversion. Such relationships may lead to ostracism and, in some cases, violence against the couple or feuds between members of the couple's families. When such situations arise, families may approach local government officials for resolution. In the past, there were reports that in some cases local government officials encouraged Christian women involved in relationships with Muslim men to convert to Islam to defuse potential family or tribal conflict and keep the peace; however, during the period covered by this report, no such cases were reported.\n\nDuring the reporting period, local newspapers occasionally published articles critical of Christian evangelical organizations.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "79918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=79918", "title": "Galli", "text": "Galli\n\nA Gallus (pl. Galli) was a eunuch priest of the Phrygian goddess Cybele and her consort Attis, whose worship was incorporated into the state religious practices of ancient Rome.\n\nThe earliest references to the Galli come from the \"Anthologia Palatina\" (a compilation of the 10th century), although they don't explicitly mention emasculation. A fragment attributed to Callimachus cites the term \"gallai\" as denoting castration.\n\nStephanus Byzantinus said that the name came from King Gallus. Ovid (43 BC - 17 AD) says that the name is derived from the Gallus river in Phrygia.\n\nA connection has been made between the episode of the castration of Attis and the ritual mutilation of the Galli.\nAt Pessinus, the centre of the Cybele cult, there were two high priests during the Hellenistic period, one with the title of \"Attis\" and the other with the name of \"Battakes\". Both were eunuchs. The high priests had considerable political influence during this period, and letters exist from a high priest Attis to the kings of Pergamon, Eumenes II and Attalus II, inscribed on stone. Later, during the Flavian period, there was a college of ten priests, not castrated, and now Roman citizens, but still using the title \"Attis\".\n\nThe first Galli arrived in Rome when the Senate officially adopted Cybele as a state goddess in 204 BC. Roman citizens were prohibited from becoming Galli, which meant that all the Galli were orientals or slaves. Under Claudius, this ban was lifted. \n\nIn Rome, the head of the galli was known as the \"archigallus\", at least from the period of Claudius on. A number of archaeological finds depict the \"archigallus\" wearing luxurious and extravagant costumes. The archigallus was always a Roman citizen chosen by the quindecimviri sacris faciundis, whose term of service lasted for life. \nAlong with the institution of the archigallus came the Phrygianum sanctuary as well as the rite of the taurobolium as it pertains to the Magna Mater, two aspects of the Magna Mater’s cultus that the archigallus held dominion over.\n\nEventually Domitian reaffirmed that Roman citizens were forbidden to practice \"eviratio\" (castration).\nThe Galli castrated themselves during an ecstatic celebration called the Dies sanguinis, or \"Day of Blood\", which took place on March 24. At the same time they put on women's costume, mostly yellow in colour, and a sort of turban, together with pendants and ear-rings. They also wore their hair long, and bleached, and wore heavy make-up. They wandered around with followers, begging for charity, in return for which they were prepared to tell fortunes. On the day of mourning for Attis they ran around wildly and disheveled. They performed dances to the music of pipes and tambourines, and, in an ecstasy, flogged themselves until they bled.\n\nBeing a Roman citizen, as well as being employed by the Roman State, meant that the archigallus had to preserve the traditions of Cybele's cult while not violating Roman prohibitions in religious behavior. Hence, some argue that the archigallus was never a eunuch, as all citizens of Rome were forbidden from emasculation. However, under Claudius Roman citizens were permitted to be castrated up until the reign of Domitian. The signs of his office have been described as a type of crown, possibly a laurel wreath, as well as a golden bracelet known as the occabus.\n\nIn the 4th century, some currents of extreme asceticism in Christianity advocated self-castration.\nThis practice was attacked as a return to the religious excesses of the \"galli\" by Basil of Ancyra.\nJohn Chrysostom in 390 attacked self-castrating Christians of being Manichaean heretics.\nAugustine likewise phrased his opposition to self-castration as an attack on the \"galli\". By extension, Luther would later use the same comparison in his attack on clerical celibacy.\n\nThe following are quotations from the English translation of the \"Greek Anthology\" by W. R. Paton (1920).\nTo thee, my mother Rhea, nurse of Phrygian lions, whose devotees tread the heights of Dindymus, did womanish Alexis, ceasing from furious clashing of the brass, dedicate these stimulants of his madness— his shrill-toned cymbals, the noise of his deep-voiced flute, to which the crooked horn of a younger steer gave a curved form, his echoing tambourines, his knives reddened with blood, and the yellow hair which once tossed on his shoulders. Be kind, O Queen, and give rest in his old age from his former wildness to him who went mad in his youth.\n\n\"Greek Anthology\", Book VI, 51\n\nClytosthenes, his feet that raced in fury now enfeebled by age, dedicates to thee, Rhea of the lion-ear, his tambourines beaten by the hand, his shrill hollow-rimmed cymbals, his double-flute that calls through its horn, on which he once made shrieking music, twisting his neck about, and the two-edged knife with which he opened his veins.\n\n\"Greek Anthology\", Book VI, 94\n\nThe priest of Rhea, when taking shelter from the winter snow-storm he entered the lonely cave, had just wiped the snow off his hair, when following on his steps came a lion, devourer of cattle, into the hollow way. But he with outspread hand beat the great tambour he held and the whole cave rang with the sound. Nor did that woodland beast dare to support the holy boom of Cybele, but rushed straight up the forest-clad hill, in dread of the half-girlish servant of the goddess, who hath dedicated to her these robes and this his yellow hair.\n\n\"Greek Anthology\", Book VI, 217\n\nA begging eunuch priest of Cybele was wandering through the upland forests of Ida, and there met him a huge lion, its hungry throat dreadfully gaping as though to devour him. Then in fear of the death that faced him in its raving jaws, he beat his tambour from the holy grove. The lion shut its murderous mouth, and as if itself full of divine frenzy, began to toss and whirl its mane about its neck. But he thus escaping a dreadful death dedicated to Rhea the beast that had taught itself her dance.\n\n\"Greek Anthology\", Book VI, 218\n\nGoaded by the fury of the dreadful goddess, tossing his locks in wild frenzy, clothed in woman's raiment with well-plaited tresses and a dainty netted hair-caul, a eunuch once took shelter in a mountain cavern, driven by the numbing snow of Zeus. But behind him rushed in unshivering a lion, slayer of bulls, returning to his den in the evening, who looking on the man, snuffing in his shapely nostrils the smell of human flesh, stood still on his sturdy feet, but rolling his eyes roared loudly from his greedy jaws. The cave, his den, thunders around him and the wooded peak that mounts nigh to the clouds echoes loud. But the priest startled by the deep voice felt all his stirred spirit broken in his breast. Yet he uttered from his lips the piercing shriek they use, and tossed his whirling locks, and holding up his great tambour, the revolving instrument of Olympian Rhea, he beat it, and it was the saviour of his life; for the lion hearing the unaccustomed hollow boom of the bull's hide was afraid and took to flight. See how all-wise necessity taught a means of escape from death!\n\n\"Greek Anthology\", Book VI, 219\n\nChaste Atys, the gelded servant of Cybele, in frenzy giving his wild hair to the wind, wished to reach Sardis from Phrygian Pessinus; but when the dark of evening fell upon him in his course, the fierce fervour of his bitter ecstasy was cooled and he took shelter in a descending cavern, turning aside a little from the road. But a lion came swiftly on his track, a terror to brave men and to him an inexpressible woe. He stood speechless from fear and by some divine inspiration put his hand to his sounding tambour. At its deep roar the most courageous of beasts ran off quicker than a deer, unable to bear the deep note in its ears, and he cried out, \"Great Mother, by the banks of the Sangarius I dedicate to thee, in thanks for my life, my holy \"thalame\" and this noisy instrument that caused the lion to fly.\"\n\n\"Greek Anthology\", Book VI, 220\n\nThe long-haired priest of Rhea, the newly gelded, the dancer from Lydian Tmolus whose shriek is heard afar, dedicates, now he rests from his frenzy, to the solemn Mother who dwells by the banks of Sangarius these tambourines, his scourge armed with bones, these noisy brazen cymbals, and a scented lock of his hair.\n\n\"Greek Anthology\", Book VI, 234\n\nThe priest of Rhea dedicated to the mountain-Mother of the gods this raiment and these locks owing to an adventure such as this. As he was walking alone in the wood a savage lion met him and a struggle for his life was imminent. But the goddess put it in his mind to beat his tambourine and he made the ravening brute take flight, dreading the awful din. For this reason his locks hang from the whistling branches.\n\n\"Greek Anthology\", Book VI, 237\n\n"}
{"id": "3708885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3708885", "title": "Great Temple of the Aten", "text": "Great Temple of the Aten\n\nThe Great Temple of the Aten (or the pr-Jtn, House of the Aten) was a temple located in the city of el-Amarna (ancient Akhetaten), Egypt. It served as the main place of worship of the deity Aten during the reign of the 18th dynasty Pharaoh Akhenaten (c. 1353-1336 BCE). Akhenaten ushered in a unique period of ancient Egyptian history by establishing the new religious cult dedicated to the sun-disk Aten. The king shut down traditional worship of other deities like Amun-Ra, and brought in a new era, though short-lived, of seeming monotheism where the Aten was worshipped as a sun god and Akhenaten and his wife, Nefertiti, represented the divinely royal couple that connected the people with the god. Although he began construction at Karnak during his rule, the association the city had with other gods drove Akhenaten to establish a new city and capital at Amarna for the Aten. Akhenaten built the city along the east bank of the Nile River, setting up workshops, palaces, suburbs and temples. The Great Temple of the Aten was located just north of the Central City and, as the largest temple dedicated to the Aten, was where Akhenaten fully established the proper cult and worship of the sun-disk.\n\nThe city of Akhetaten was built rather hastily and was constructed mostly of mud-brick. Mud-bricks were made by drying in the sun and they measured 33–37 cm x 15–16 cm x 9–10 cm, although bricks for temple enclosure walls were slightly larger, at 38 cm x 16 cm x 16 cm. During construction, bricks were laid down with a small amount of mortar between the rows and no mortar between adjacent bricks. There was no rain to deteriorate the bricks but they would wear down from wind-swept sand, so for protection walls were plastered with a layer of mud that could be reapplied. As the bricks dried, they often shrank leading to warping and structural problems, so a technique was developed of arranging the rows of bricks so that every other row was nearly hollow, allowing for air to circulate. While this helped walls keep their form, it also acted to weaken the walls so particularly high constructions meant to hold a lot of weight had to be made differently. For pylon towers and large surrounding walls like those at the Great Temple of the Aten, timber was used for structural support and the public buildings within the Temple had stone columns and were built of other stones for more support. Stone columns conformed to the usual style found elsewhere in Egypt, representing either palm-frond or papyrus. To lay out structural elements like offering tables and pits on a plaster floor, string was used. The string was first dipped in black paint and stretched tightly and was allowed to touch the ground, leaving a mark. In some instances the string was even pushed into the plaster floor, leaving a shallow groove. A similar technique was used to divide up wall surfaces before they were decorated with relief.\n\nThe actual construction of the temple was accomplished in a series of steps. Before anything was built, there was already some kind of dedication ceremony at the site. A ceremonial gateway with receptacles for liquid offerings stood at the beginning of a paved avenue. The avenue extended eastward and was lined with sphinxes, but they were later replaced by trees (tree pits, some still containing tree roots, have been excavated). The avenue led up to a small mud-brick shrine which was later built into the main design scheme of the Temple. The first main construction undertaken by Akhenaten was the building of the temenos wall, enclosing a huge area of 229m x 730m. As the wall was being completed, the stone Sanctuary at the east end of the enclosure was built. This Sanctuary seemed to function on its own for some time until a few years later when Akhenaten added the Gem-Aten on the west side of the enclosure. With this addition, the original ceremonial gate had to be taken down and a raised causeway was built over it. The Gem-Aten was originally constructed in stone, but it seems that as time went on Akhenaten ran low on materials and the latter part of the Gem-Aten was finished with mud-brick. It is unknown exactly how the Temple walls were decorated because the entire area was destroyed later on, but fragments that have been found show that there were many statues of Akhenaten and his family placed all around the Temple.\n\nThe Great Temple of the Aten lay to the north of the Central City part of Akhetaten and was separated from the Palace by many storehouses. The Temple was oriented on an east-west axis and the western entrance to the Great Temple was along the Royal Road, a road that ran through the city and parallel to the Nile River. Soon after the death of Akhenaten, Atenism was rejected as a religion and the city was destroyed. The temple was dismantled, covered in new sand, and paved over, but ironically this has preserved the site better than it might normally have been for archaeologists today. In 1890, Flinders Petrie, with permission from the Egyptian Antiquities Service, began excavating the area. Based on the remaining foundations he found as well as on multiple scenes of the Great Temple found in private tomb decoration in Amarna, a comprehensive reconstruction of the temple has been possible.\n\nOne of the most distinctive aspects of the Temple was that there was no cult image of the god. Instead, the Temple was open-aired and had no roof, so that people worshipped the actual sun directly overhead as it traveled from east to west. In fact this was a common theme amongst all of the Aten temples; they were all arranged to direct worship towards the sky (such as in the Ḥwt Aten (Mansion of Aten), the smaller temple of Aten located 500m south of the Great Temple in Akhetaten).\n\nIn the Great Temple there were two main structures, the Gem-Aten and the Sanctuary, which were separated by about 300m. Upon entering the enclosure wall, one faced the first of these structures, the Gem-Aten, which was a very long building preceded by a court called the Per-Hai (House of Rejoicing). On the left of the main entrance to the Temple was a columned pavilion and on both the left and the right were small chapels. These chapels, originally built for Queen Kiya, were later taken over by the elder princesses. The first great pylon directly ahead was the entrance into the Per-Hai and it had swinging doors and five pairs of tall masts with crimson pennants flanking the doorway. The inside of the Per-Hai had two rows of four columns on each side. Within these colonnades were altars made of limestone carved with images of the King and Queen giving offerings. Through the Per-Hai and the next great pylon was the Gem-Aten, the [Place of] He Who Found the Aten, and this was a series of six courtyards separated by pylons, all leading to a main sanctuary and altar. This Temple differed from temples of other gods because as one progressed through the courts, they became more open to the air and light, as opposed to temples like those of Amun-Ra where the halls would get darker and more shrouded in mystery. The first court had a high altar with small chapels and chambers on either side. Each successive court had altars and magazines where offering supplies could be stored. The fourth court was columned and had many furnished chambers where people could rest in the shade. The final court had a main High Altar intended for the Royal pair, and it was surrounded by 365 mud-brick altars on either side, one for each day of the year, divided to represent Upper and Lower Egypt. The offerings given here were dedicated to the Aten but were then used to feed the officiating priests, the temple staff, and even some of the local populace. Beyond this High Altar the Gem-Aten abruptly ended in a blank wall, which shows no sign of having had a door in it. On the outside of the Gem-Aten there was enough room to have a large ambulatory and there were 40 rows of 20 offering tables set up on each side.\nBetween the Gem-Aten and the Sanctuary, the main building at the east end of the enclosure, was a smaller, more sacred pillared portico with statues of the pharaoh Akhenaten and his family standing in front of each column. Inside the portico was a great quartzite stela next to a colossal seated statue of Akhenaten. This stela was carved with images of Akhenaten and Nefertiti and was a variation of a benben stone, a sacred solar symbol of Heliopolis. Traditionally, the benben stone was a representation of the island created by the sun-god Atum at the beginning of the world. This marked one of the holiest areas in the Temple and it was heaped in flowers and offerings. Today only a fragment of this stone has been found (discovered by Carter in 1892), but it was identified as a benben stone based on scenes of the Temple found in nearby tombs.\n\nAlso between the Gem-Aten and the Sanctuary in the Great Temple was a large square building where meat offerings were slaughtered and prepared, but further excavation of the area is difficult because of the presence of the modern-day cemetery of Et-Till.\n\nThe second main structure of the Great Temple was the Sanctuary at its east end, which may have been inspired by the Fifth Dynasty Sun Temples at Abu Ghuroub (c. 2400 BCE). The Sanctuary started with a pylon that led into an open court, on the south side of which were three houses probably intended for the priests on duty. A second pylon led to a causeway that went through two large colonnades with colossal statues of Akhenaten on either side wearing the Red Crown and the White Crown. The causeway continued into a final court that had a high altar surrounded by offering tables. This main altar was probably intended just for the Royal Family, especially after the Gem-Aten was built and put into regular use. Behind the Sanctuary there were other rooms including a large room which housed the original shrine of the dedication ceremony, but these rooms were only accessible from outside the Sanctuary.\n\nAgainst the northeastern end of the enclosure wall was one final altar called the Hall of Foreign Tribute. This was a large set-in altar and was most likely where offerings from foreign lands were made.\n\nThe cult of the Aten was celebrated daily and was very simple. Although there were other priests, Akhenaten acted as his own High Priest and special roles were given to the royal women. Since there was no cult statue, the traditional acts of raising and washing the god played no role in the Great Temple and worship rather consisted solely of singing hymns and giving offerings to the Aten. Some hymns told stories, such as one that attributed the Aten with the creation of the human race and recognized that people were created differently, to speak different languages and have different colored skins, while other hymns simply expressed adoration and gratitude to the Aten. Offerings consisted of food, drink, flowers, and perfume and were often accompanied by burning incense and pouring libations. To consecrate offerings, a special baton called a \"hrp\" was used to touch the offerings, marking it as meant for the Aten.\n\nOn each day, the Royal Family approached the temple on chariots after riding up and down the Royal Road, and entered the temple precinct and presented offerings in front of the Gem-Aten. The King and Queen then consecrated their offerings with the hrp while their daughters rattled instruments called sistra. The family then passed through the pylons of the Gem-Aten and mounted the steps of the High Altar where there were offerings of meat, poultry, vegetables, and flowers already laid out and surmounted by three pans of burning incense. As the King and Queen officiated, priests then placed offerings on many of the other altars for the public people while music was played. The Princesses continued to rattle the sistra while four male chanters sang hymns to the Aten within the Gem-Aten court. Outside the Gem-Aten were female musicians who performed along with the temple choir which was made up of blind singers and a blind harpist. These musicians performed at intervals throughout the day and were never allowed beyond the outer court.\n\nFlinders Petrie was the first person to work in the temple, and his assistant, Howard Carter excavated in the sanctuary area. However, it was John Pendlebury who actually fully mapped this area during his excavations in 1935. The EES Amarna Survey project returned to re–dig the site and corrected some mistakes in the mapping.\n\nProject leader Sarah Parcak of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, \"Based on the coins and pottery we found, it appears to be a massive regional center that traded with Greece, Turkey and Libya.\"\n\nThis is part of a larger project aiming to map as much of ancient Egypt's archaeological sites, or \"tells,\" as possible before they are destroyed or covered by modern development.\n\nAlthough Akhenaten had several temples dedicated to the Aten, the Great Temple of the Aten was the largest and most significant. During the 18th dynasty reign of Akhenaten, the new city of Akhetaten was completely built up and the regular worship of the Aten was established. However, shortly after the pharaoh's death, all fell apart as successive kings destroyed the Temple and the city in an effort to return to the traditional religion of Egypt. Nonetheless, enough remains preserved of the Great Temple of the Aten to be able to get a sense of what it looked like and how worship of the Aten must have played out for inhabitants of the city of Akhetaten.\n\n"}

Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.\" Then he said to the man, \"Stretch out your hand.\" So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other.\nAccording to the Gospel of Mark, the Pharisees then went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.\n\nThis miracle is the subject of the spoken sermon portion of composer John Adams' \"Christian Zeal and Activity\".\n\n"}
{"id": "46551200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46551200", "title": "History of the Catholic Church in Belize", "text": "History of the Catholic Church in Belize\n\nHistorians distinguish at least three periods in the history of the Catholic church in Belize. The first period saw missionaries accompany Spanish conquistadores among the Mayas in western Belize, from 1524 until 1707 when such activity drew to a close. A century later separate incursions into the central, southern, and northern parts of the territory led to the first permanent residency of the Jesuits in Belize, in 1851. This marks the beginning of the second period which saw the rapid spread of mission churches throughout Belize. The third period began with appointment of the first native bishop, thus handing over to the native, diocesan clergy administration of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Belize City-Belmopan.\n\n1524 to 1707 Friars accompanied the earliest Spanish expeditions into Central America, in accordance with the Patronato system and its intermingling of politics and religion. While the Spanish pursued the false hope of finding gold in Peten, Guatemala, the missionaries accompanied them south from Yucatan, Mexico, and north from Cobán, Guatemala. Scattered physical and documentary evidence of friars among the Maya in Western Belize exists for the period 1524 to 1707. Near the Maya site at Xunantunich in west central Belize lies Tipu with the remains of a primitive church building, mentioned in Spanish records, and a large number of Maya skeletons around its confines. Tipu ceased to exist as a Maya/Christian settlement in 1707 when the Spanish moved its residents to the shores of Lake Petén Itza. Sixty miles to the north of Tipu lies Lamanai (Indian Church) with the remaining stone walls of a missionary church and the ruins of a second church. Maya rebellions were frequent since the system of \"reducciones\"—gathering the scattered Maya into Spanish-controlled villages—meant paying taxes and loss of freedom. The South witnessed the only recorded martyrdom of missionaries in Belize: in 1684 at Paliac (Rio Grande, Toledo) three Franciscans and some Spaniards were martyred, presumably a sacrificial offering following the Maya method of ripping out the heart. But it was usually the political rather than the Christianizing effort that provoked Maya resistance. Missionaries who resumed the evangelizing effort over 100 years later would attest to remnants of Christian belief.\n\n1830 to 1851 Around 1830 Catholic priests reappear in the historical record of Belize. Mestizos had come as refugees from Honduras to Mullins River south of Belize Town. Fray Antonio worked among them from 1832 to 1836 when he was replaced by Fray Rubio from Bacalar in Yucatan. Rubio built in Mullins River in 1837 the first Catholic church in modern Belize. Then in 1840, Frs. Sandoval and Rivas from Yucatan built a chapel in Belize Town. This had been the coastal center of the British logging industry in the central part of the colony since the late 18th century. The town was served by Anglican, Baptist, and Methodist ministers but Spanish merchants from Yucatan, along with mestizos and Garifuna from the South, would enlarge the Catholic community in the mid-19th century.\n\nA large migration of Garifuna had come up the coast from Honduras in 1832, to what became Punta Gorda and Dangriga in the south of Belize. Their ancestry, of African and Carib Indian mix, traces to Saint Vincent. There they rebelled against the British in 1797 and were expelled to Roatán, from which they spread along the Honduran coast. By the 19th century they were settling along the southern coastline of Belize. They had been catechized by Spanish priests while on St. Vincent, as evidenced in “makeshift beads and crosses to ward off evil and danger.\" They would be sought after by the British as strong warriors and sturdy workers. But it was as good students and educators that they impacted Catholicism in Belize, with several priests and the first native bishop coming from their number. The Holy Family Sisters would come in 1898 specifically to minister to Garifuna communities, and within a century 45 Belizeans had joined these sisters.\nThe third and largest migration to Belize followed the Caste War of Yucatan when Santa Cruz Maya drove out mestizos from the coast. Between 1847 and 1855 thousands of mestizos fled from Bacalar to Belize, enlarging Corozal and Orange Walk towns. By 1850 there were 7,000 Catholics in the territory, mostly Spanish and mestizo refugees of the Caste War in Yucatan. These mestizos also settled alongside the Icaiche Maya in the northern forests, with gradual movement down the western high ground, above the coastal swamps. In the West, the township of Benque Viejo del Carmen was followed after some years by El Cayo whose population grew from the timber industry that had moved west along the Belize River. Missionary contacts with the Santa Cruz, Icaiche, and mestizos are mentioned in several of the \"Letters and Notices\" of the English Province of Jesuits who would arrive in 1851.\n\nIn 1837 the Catholic mission office in Rome made Jamaica a vicariate responsible for the whole Caribbean area. With few resources spread over this vast region, little attention was given to the territory of Belize until Catholics of Spanish ancestry were driven from Yucatan to northern Belize during their strife with the Maya (1847-1901). After this influx of Catholics, in 1851, Belize was made a Jesuit mission under the care of the English Province of the Jesuits, eleven years before it became the crown colony of British Honduras. In December 1851 the vicar apostolic from Jamaica, along with his successor in 1855, Jesuit Fr. James Eustace Du Peyron, travelled to Belize to assess the situation. Du Peyron would oversee the building of the first Catholic church in Belize Town for what is today Holy Redeemer parish. The great fire of July 17, 1856, destroyed the north side of town including the church building. By April 1858 the present Holy Redeemer Cathedral building was completed. Other parishes followed along the coastline: Corozal (1859), with a large population of mestizo Catholics; Punta Gorda (1862) with Garifuna on the coast and Maya inland; and Stann Creek (1867) mostly Garifuna. Between 1852 and 1893, 58 Jesuits from 10 countries came to establish these churches: from Italy (18), England (14), Spain (11), Belgian (5), France (3), Ireland (3), Germany (1), Greece (1), Guatemala (1), Columbia (1).\n\nIn 1888 British Honduras became a prefecture and in 1893 a vicariate with Salvatore di Pietro, S.J., as prefect apostolic and then vicar apostolic with the title of bishop. The presence of three American bishops for his consecration evidenced the growing importance of the United States to the mission. In 1894 the Jesuits transferred responsibility for British Honduras from the English Province to the Missouri Province of the central United States. Bishop di Pietro died in 1898 and was succeeded by Bishop Frederick C. Hopkins, S.J., the last of the English Jesuits in Belize. \nPermanent parishes among the Maya in west central Belize were begun in Benque Viejo (1905) and San Ignacio (1909). St. John's College, founded at the cathedral in 1887, was moved to Loyola Park in 1917. In 1923 Bishop Hopkins along with two Pallottine sisters drowned when the boat they were taking to Corozal sank. Bishop Joseph Anthony Murphy, S.J., succeeded Hopkins. His tenure was marked by a rebuilding effort following the hurricane of 1931, that destroyed St. John's College at Loyola Park and took an estimated 2500 lives including eleven Jesuits. He also built Holy Redeemer Hall which became the premier indoor facility for large events in Belize, until the construction of Bliss Institute in 1954. In 1938 at the age of 80 Bishop Murphy retired and Bishop William A. Rice, S.J., succeeded him. Rice died of a heart attack in 1946. Next came the last vicar apostolic of Belize, David Francis Hickey, S.J., who would become first bishop of the Diocese of Belize when it was raised from vicariate status in 1956. In 1957 he resigned and Bishop Robert Louis Hodapp, S.J., replaced him. Hodapp remained in office for 25 years, attending all five sessions of the Second Vatican Council and working toward its implementation in the diocese. He resigned in 1983.\n\nIn 1982 Fr. Osmond Peter Martin, from the Garifuna people, became the first native Belizean to be raised to the episcopacy. He became auxiliary to Hodapp and then in 1983 bishop of the diocese. Martin summoned the first diocesan synod in 1989, focused on activating the laity to take ownership of their church. In April 2001 he inaugurated at the cathedral the Monsignor Facundo Castillo Diocesan Center, home to the diocesan radio, television, and newspaper ministries. Dorick M. Wright became auxiliary in 2002 and succeeded Martin in 2007. Due to Wright's failing eyesight, in 2012 Christopher Glancy was named auxiliary and assumed many of the responsibilities of the diocese. The number of Catholics in Belize had grown by 16,414 or 15% since 1991, while total population had grown by 131,723 or 70% in the same period. The number of Belizeans entering the diocesan priesthood was six from the 1930s through 1950s, then peaked with eleven in the 1960s through 1980s, but from then to 2014 had fallen to three. In 2013 Bishop Wright opened a minor seminary, St. Benedict's Diocesan Seminary, in the facility built by the Benedictines near Santa Elena. Four young men constituted its first class.\n\nThe Jesuits (S.J.) were responsible for establishing a permanent Catholic presence in Belize beginning in 1851, as detailed above. From then until 2015, 374 Jesuits worked in Belize, founding most of the parishes and missions. They also founded Trinidad Farm Retreat Center near Belize City. In 2015 they remained as pastors at St.Martin de Porres parish in Belize City and at the largely Garifuna St. Peter Claver parish in Punta Gorda, with its 30 Maya mission stations and schools. In June 1885 Jesuit Henry Gillett began publication of \"The Angelus\", “a Catholic monthly periodical … written partly in English and partly in Spanish, … [intended] to refute error and to give people correct information about Catholic affairs.” It included substantial documentation, as in Fr. Hopkins's 1851-1893 “Historical Sketch of the Catholic Mission in Belize” published in 1897. \"The Angelus\" ceased publication in 1905. The current Catholic monthly \"The Christian Herald\" began publication in September 1979 under Jesuit Fr. Maher, who also initiated the diocesan radio and television apostolates. St. John's College (SJC), which \"would become one of the largest and most prestigious educational institutions in the country,\" was founded by Fr. Cassian Gillett, S.J., in 1887, in quarters on the cathedral grounds. It moved to a spacious Loyola Park campus south of town in 1917 where it served as a boarding school for many who would become leaders in Belize and throughout Central America. The hurricane of 1931 destroyed the Loyola Park campus (see above), taking the lives of 6 priests, 1 brother, and 4 scholastics. SJC then returned to the cathedral grounds until 1952 when it moved to a spacious campus northwest of town. It now has 20 buildings to accommodate its secondary and junior college divisions, and an additional extension division in town. In the late 1890s celebrated Jesuit naturalist William A. Stanton taught at St. John's College. The influence of Jesuit education on Belizean politics is covered under \"Apostolic works\" below, along with their part in initiating credit unions and cooperatives in Belize. The Boy Scout movement in Belize was introduced by Brother \"Jake\" Jacoby in Holy Redeemer parish during his long tenure in Belize, 1928 to 1957.\n\nIn 1883 the Sisters of Mercy (R.S.M.) came to Belize and established a lasting presence. Since then 156 of their number have worked in Belize. Bishops di Pietro and Hopkins did much to secure their services and then to arrange for their separate foundation in Belize, independent of the motherhouse in New Orleans. On coming to Belize, the sisters assumed the task of running Holy Redeemer Primary School that by the early 1900s enrolled nearly 400 students. Their three-storey brick convent and school building, built in 1885, was destroyed by the 1931 hurricane. It was rebuilt in 1935 along with an elementary school and St. Catherine Academy which continues to educate girls in the Belize City area. On the same campus is Our Lady of Guadalupe Mercy Center, which accommodated 1600 persons in 2014 for retreats and other programs. Since 1967 the Mercies have managed Muffles College in Orange Walk Town. They also inaugurated Belmopan Comprehensive School in 1970, Mercy clinic in 1981, and Mercy Kitchen in 1986. Together with a Sister of Charity of Nazareth they founded a clinic for Mayan women in rural Toledo in 1964. In 2012 Sr. M. Caritas Lawrence, R.S.M., an educator, liturgical translator from Mayan to English, and senior officer in the Ministry of Education, was awarded the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth for her life's work.\n\nThe Holy Family Sisters (S.S.F.), an African-American congregation from New Orleans, arrived in 1898 to manage the small parochial school in Dangriga. By 2000, 95 had served in Belize, of whom 19 were native Belizeans. They founded Austin High School for Girls, since amalgamated, and Delille Academy in Dangriga, and also have charge of two grade schools. There have been 27 Belizeans who joined the congregation and served only abroad.\n\nArriving in 1913, the Pallottines (S.A.C.) established convents in Benque Viejo and Corozal, and later throughout Belize. By 2001, 162 had served in Belize, of whom 69 were native Belizeans. In 1931 they built a large novitiate near Punta Gorda, from which they minister in 30 Maya villages that have Catholic chapels and schools. In 1957 they opened Pallotti High School for girls in Belize City (at right). In 1968 Belize became an independent province of their congregation. In 2013 their century of service was commemorated by a Belizean stamp.\n\nIn 1975 the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth (S.C.N.) were called to assist at Sacred Heart Parish in Dangriga and then to foster lay ministry in the spirit of renewal in the Catholic church. From 1975 to 2014, 22 had worked in Belize, of whom 4 were Belizean. In 2014 Sr. Barbara Flores, S.C.N., was the President/General Manager of Catholic Public Schools.\n\nIn 1975 these religious sisters began coming four at a time from Mexico and realizing their charism of evangelizing in remote villages, first in Orange Walk District then also in Corozal District. In 1979 they opened a convent in San Juan Village, Corozal. By 2000, 22 had worked in Belize, of whom 11 were Belizean.\n\nThe Guadalupana sisters from Mérida, Yucatan, worked in lay ministry at St. Francis Xavier Parish in Corozal during the 1970s and early 1980s. From 1985 to 1994 six Sisters of the Dominican Order from Springfield, Kentucky, also served in Belize.\n\nThe Society of Our Lady of the Most Holy Trinity (SOLT) includes both lay and religious, men and women. Its mission to Belize began in the late 1960s in Benque Viejo in the areas of health care and pastoring. This expanded into managing schools and teaching at the secondary level. Then in 1976 Deacon Cal Cathers of SOLT founded BRC Printing Limited to print primarily reading and math textbooks for schools. In 1990 SOLT founded Mt. Carmel High School in Benque, staffed largely by foreign volunteers, and also opened Divine Mercy Church in Belize City. In 1998, John Marhevka of SOLT founded a Catholic bookstore and radio station in Benque. In 2005, he built a media center and radio station in Belize City and in 2010 Power FM Catholic Youth Radio began broadcasting, to which was added Radio Guadalupe Catholic Radio Station in 2013. By 2014, 20 members had served in Belize for extended periods of time.\n\nIn 1971, the Benedictine monks (O.S.B.) from Subiaco Abbey (Arkansas) established a monastery near Santa Elena, Belize. By 1999, 23 Benedictines had served in Belize, but the monastery was then closed for lack of numbers. The fine buildings and property were bequeathed to the Diocese and in 2013 re-opened as St. Benedict Diocesan Seminary.\n\nThe Viatorians (C.S.V.) came to Xavier Parish in Corozal in 1998. They organized teacher training workshops, especially for catechists. They assumed responsibility for and expanded the high school in Chunox, Corozal District, enlarging its departments in agriculture, science, computers, and home economics. After much consultation, they implemented a pastoral plan that would unify the parish with its many missions. In May 2012 Fr. Christopher Glancy, C.S.V., who had guided Xavier parish in Corozal through much of its renewal, was called to the episcopacy to assist Bishop Dorick M. Wright whose eyesight was failing. In 2014, after supplying 11 members for its work in Belize and realizing one Belizean member's ordination, they could no longer supply men and withdrew from Belize.\n\nComing in 1986, 15 Columbans served at St. Ignatius, St. Vianney, and Ladyville around Belize City as well as in Dangriga, leaving in 1999. Four Claretians also served in Dangriga, between 2002 and 2014.\n\nEdward J. O’Donnell, S.J., before becoming president of Marquette University, led discussion classes at St. John's College night school from 1945-1948, based on Pope Pius XI’s social encyclical \"Quadragesimo anno\" (1931). Class members included future political and People's United Party leaders George Cadle Price, Philip Goldson, Herman Jex, John Albert Smith, Leigh Richardson, and Nick Pollard Sr. Price, popularly known as the \"Father of the Nation,\" led Belize through its independence movement, holding the top office in the country for a cumulative 27 years. Price’s authorized biographer observes that Price had great respect for the Jesuits, and his policies based on social justice are easily traced to \"Quadragesimo anno\". The editor of \"Amandala\" newspaper, Evan X Hyde, stated that “the Catholic Church in British Honduras … achieved political power when George Price became PUP leader.” He is pictured here with Peace Corps volunteers.\n\nMarion M. Ganey, S.J., was largely responsible for introducing cooperatives and credit unions to Belize beginning in 1943, in response to Pius XI’s social encyclical \"Quadragesimo anno\". Within 10 years of the first credit union, the colony had 22 credit unions and the “various cooperatives embraced consumer, marketing, housing, hog, chicle, and farmers co-operatives.” The religious sisters did their part, the Pallottines in Punta Gorda in the 1940s teaching girls the canning of produce. In 1951 Jesuit Fr. William Ulrich gave the Maya of San Antonio village a scale for weighing their hogs, protecting them from sharkers who grossly underestimated the weight. From increased revenue the villagers bought a truck to carry their hogs and other produce to market, and a hog cooperative was formed. Ulrich's action also impacted village politics. By encouraging “the election of younger and more progressive men to the Alcalde’s Council which had been set up by Fr. Knopp” this “irretrievably altered the traditional relationship between the old and the young.” The credit union movement included Jesuit Henry Sutti, the first priest to come out of Boys Town, Nebraska, and in 1943 founder of the Holy Redeemer Credit Union, which in 2009 was capitalized at Bz$322.7 million with 42,262 members. Since 1956, the Director of the Credit union has been Jane Ellen Usher.\n\nFrom the 1850s laws were enacted in British Honduras so that by the end of the century the church-state system of education was well established, with payment by results, for the benefit of every denomination of Christians. But the problem of finding qualified teachers persisted. From the late 1940s prospective teachers among Catholic young men were hosted in a teachers’ hostel on New Road in Belize City, to return to their villages as teachers. This lasted until the building was destroyed by hurricane Hattie in 1961. By then several future government ministers and Fr. Calistus Cayetano had received their education through this program. In 1957 Fr. John Stochl introduced a high school equivalency program for adults in the downtown Extension Division of SJC. The first government secondary school, Technical High School, did not open until 1952. In 1954 the Diocese established St. John's Teacher Training College at Holy Redeemer. In 1965, it was amalgamated with the government's St. George's Teachers’ College to become Belize Teachers’ College. At that time total enrollment at five church-run schools in Belize City was 815 students; of these, 589 were in primary school and 226 were in secondary school. In 1961 two more Catholic secondary schools were opened: St. Francis Xavier in Corozal and St. Peter Claver in Punta Gorda.\n\nIn 1953 an agricultural branch of St. John's College, called Lynam College, was opened in Stann Creek on land lent by the government. The college operated until 1971 when lack of funding and criticism that it was not fulfilling its function as an agricultural school caused its closing. St. John's Junior College grew out of the Sixth Form (1952) that was connected to the high school (1887). In 1966 it began offering associate degrees in affiliation with the American Association of Community Colleges. Two more Catholic junior colleges were founded in the 1990s. Muffles Junior College near Orange Walk Town was opened in 1992. It grew out of Muffles High School that originated in 1953. And Sacred Heart Junior College in San Ignacio Town was opened in 1999. It grew out of Sacred Heart High School which was the first secondary school in Cayo District when it opened in 1960. Seminarians from nearby St. Benedict's attend Sacred Heart Junior College. By 2015 the Catholic church had 148 elementary schools, attached to all of its 18 parishes and to most all of its mission stations, along with 11 high schools and 3 junior colleges. Not until 1986 did the government found a university independent of church control. There have been efforts to detach education from the British A-level system and associate it more closely to the American system of accreditation, but the Chamber of Commerce and Rotary business people resisted. \n\nSir Alan Burns, Governor of British Honduras (1934-1939), used Benque Viejo as an example of one challenge that teaching in Belizean schools presents: “I have heard German nuns trying to teach Maya children out of an English textbook which they had to explain in Spanish.” The solution, in higher education at least, has been to require English in the classroom. The Garifuna have enculturated the Catholic Mass and have it in their own language. As regards the Kriol language which most speak in Belize City there has been more controversy. Several Christian churches have introduced Kriol into their services and a Kriol New Testament has been produced. But the Catholic Mass, requiring approval from Roman authorities, has not been translated into Kriol. On the other hand, Catholics are deeply involved in the Kriol Council, and St. John's College through its Belize Institute for Social Research and Action (BISRA) publishes \"Belizean Studies\" which carries articles on the role of Kriol and other cultures in Belizean Society.\nIn 1970 Ms. Signa Yorke was the first layperson appointed dean of sixth form at the Jesuit-run St. John's College. Then the by-laws of the college were rewritten so that the Jesuit superior for Belize was no longer automatically president of the college and lay members were added to the board of trustees. Mr. Stuart Simmons was appointed the first lay principal of the high school division. In 1994 the by-laws were again changed so that a lay person could be president of the college, and in 1999 Mr. Carlos Perdomo became the first lay president. The chairperson of the board had already for many years been a layperson. Over 25 years the transition to lay leadership was effected, while efforts were made to assure the continuing presence of the Jesuit charism in the college. At St. Catherine Academy Mrs. Alice Castillo became the first lay principal in 1997.\n\nProminent graduates. Zee Edgell attended St. Catherine Academy and is author of the award-winning novel \"Beka Lamb\". Those attending some division of St. John's College and prominent in government service include Emil Arguelles, Johnny Briceño, Jorge Espat, Manuel Esquivel, Francis Fonseca, Ralph Fonseca, Caritas Lawrence, Zenaida Moya, Said Musa, George Cadle Price. Prominent graduates of other Catholic schools include Dolores Balderamos-García, Antonio Soberanis Gómez, Gaspar Vega.\n\n"}
{"id": "47665265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47665265", "title": "History of the Jews in Guam", "text": "History of the Jews in Guam\n\nThe history of the Jews in Guam, a territory of the United States in the western Pacific Ocean, dates back to at least 1899. A high point in Jewish activity in Guam was during the time of World War II. Jews have continued to live there since, although as a small presence. As of 2009, there are approximately 150 Jews in Guam, of which about a third are religiously active.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, the Spanish colony Guam was – as part of the Spanish–American War – conquered by, and ceded to, the United States. For a brief period in 1899, the year following the annexation, the Jewish naval officer Edward D. Taussig served as Governor of Guam. He was the first American officer in charge of the territory. During his short governorship, Taussig carried out a number of actions, among them the establishment of a local government consisting of native Chamorro people.\n\nHaving been ousted by the Empire of Japan in 1941, American troops recaptured Guam in 1944 following years of occupation. In the wake of this, large amounts of military forces were deployed to the area – whether from the army, the navy, or other branches. Some of the personnel deployed were of Jewish origin, both secular and religious. One example of this was Lt. Miriam Miller, a member of the United States Navy Nurse Corps who aided troops wounded across the Pacific theatre. Some Jewish personnel in Guam were politically active, establishing the Guam Zionist Club after some of them decided that they should try to keep zionism alive among themselves. The association put out a mimeographed newspaper for its members, and advertised activities in regular military publications. The book \"The Jews' Secret Fleet\", in which the author Murray Greenfield described the participation of North American sailors in \"Aliyah Bet\", mentions how one individual came into contact with the secret operation through a newsletter for Jewish servicemen while stationed at Guam.\n\nIn 1945, 1,500 servicemen celebrated the Jewish holiday Rosh Hashanah at Guam, in a Boeing B-29 Superfortress hangar converted to the purpose by non-Jewish personnel of the Twentieth Air Force. The hangar was equipped with seats, a pulpit, a Torah ark to hold sacred scrolls, special lighting, and public address systems. A souvenir prayer book was printed as well. Chaplain David I. Cedarbaum officiated the ceremony, while others led the attending choir and blew the shofar.\n\nA single Jewish synagogue once existed on Guam. It was however destroyed in 1962, during an exceptionally strong typhoon. Despite this, members of the congregation continued to assemble. In 1976, a military chapel was dedicated for use by practitioners of Judaism by the US Navy and Air Force. Religious activity continue into the 21st century, with for example Jews represented in the Guam Interfaith Committee which began its activities in 2005. Occasionally, visiting rabbis from New York City help the Jewish community in Guam practice for example bar and bat mitzvahs.\n\n"}
{"id": "32145192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32145192", "title": "Huang–Lao", "text": "Huang–Lao\n\nHuang–Lao or Huanglao () was the most influential Chinese school of thought in the early 2nd-century BCE Han dynasty, having its origins in a broader political-philosophical drive looking for solutions to strengthen the feudal order as depicted in Zhou propaganda. Not systematically explained by historiographer Sima Qian, it is generally interpreted as a school of syncretism, developing into a major religion - the beginnings of the religious Taoism. \n\nEmphasizing the search for immortality, Feng Youlan and Herrlee Creel considered said religious Taoism to be different from if not contradictory to the more philosophical Zhuangzi strain of Taoism. Probably originating together around 300 BCE, the more politically dominant Huang–Lao denoted both for much of the Han. Highly favoured by superstitious rulers, it dominated the intellectual life of the Qin and early Han together with \"Chinese Legalism\", and the term Taoism (dao-jia) was probably coined with Huang–Lao and Zhuangzi content in mind.\n\n\"Huang-Lao\" is a portmanteau word, with Huang referring to the Yellow Emperor (黃帝) and Lao to Laozi (老子 \"Old Master\"). The related Daoist name \"Huanglao jun\" () was a deification of Laozi as a reincarnated personification of the Dao.\n\nThe term \"Huang-Lao\" first appears in the (109 – 91 BCE) \"Records of the Grand Historian\", which was begun by Sima Tan and completed by his son Sima Qian. Sima Tan (at least possibly) studied under a Huang–Lao master with a philosophical lineage dating back to the Warring States period Jixia Academy at the court of Qi (modern Shandong). \n\nHans van Ess (1993:173) analyzed the \"Shiji\" and \"Hanshu\" biographies of 2nd-century BCE individuals described as \"Huang-Lao\" followers, and found they were either members of a Huang–Lao faction or a \"Ru\" \"Confucian\" and \"Fa\" \"Legalist\" faction. The historian Sima Qian used the term Huang–Lao \"as a characterization of persons belonging to a political group which was the faction he belonged to as well.\" These historical members of the Huang–Lao faction had three political policies in common: \"opposing the campaigns in the north\" against the Xiongnu, \"affiliation to rich and independent families with a power-base far from the capital\" at Chang'an, and \"opposing the measures to deprive the feudal kings of their power.\"\n\nThe rich families of Huang-Lao may be said to have considered the emperor a \"primus inter pares\" (first among equals; the senior or representative member of a group) rather than someone vested with absolute authority. Naturally, as someone favoring his class and ideology with it, Sima Tan's work was rather biased towards Daoism and feudalism (or the Chinese version of it). Sima Qian considered Emperor Wen of Han and Emperor Jing of Han, the Empress Dowager, Cao Can, Chen Ping and Tian Shu to be Huang-Lao proponents.\n\nIt was probably the earliest movement that linked together Laozi, Zhuangzi, the worship of Yellow Emperor, the School of Naturalists, elements of Chinese folk religion, and aspects from the other Hundred Schools of Thought. Huang–Lao Daoist philosophy was favoured at the Western Han courts of Emperor Wen (r. 180–157 BCE) and Emperor Jing (r. 157–141 BCE), before Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 BCE) established Confucianism as the state philosophy.\n\nHuang-Lao was eclipsed by the \"Legalistic\" Gongsun Hong and Zhang Tang.\n\nIf the term is defined vaguely, a number of pre-Qin texts might retroactively be included under the term Huang-Lao. Excepting the \"Huangdi Neijing\", most Huang–Lao texts vanished, and traditional scholarship associated the philosophical school with syncretist Chinese classics, namely the legalistic \"Hanfeizi\", the Taoistic \"Huainanzi\", but also the more Confucian \"Xunzi\" and \"Guanzi\". Other proposals include parts of the Daoist \"Zhuangzi\" (Schwartz 1985:216), sections of the historical \"Guoyu\" (\"Discourses of the States\"), \"Chunqiu Fanlu\" (\"Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals\"), and \"Lüshi Chunqiu\" (\"Mister Lü's Spring and Autumn Annals\"), the \"Heguanzi\" (鶴冠子 \"Book of Master Pheasant-Cap\"), and the military \"Huang Shigong San Lüe\" (\"Three Strategies of Huang Shigong\"). \n\nRandall P. Peerenboom (1990) criticizes the tendency to classify all these texts together and \"make of 'Huang-Lao' a dustbin by sweeping too much into it.\" If defined more strictly, nothing before the Han dynasty could be called Huang-Lao. No pre-Qin text actually uses the term. Modern scholars are reinterpreting Huang–Lao following the 1973 discovery of the legalistic Mawangdui Silk Texts, which included four manuscripts, called the \"Huang-Lao boshu\" (黄老帛书 \"Huang-Lao Silk Texts\"), that are controversially identified as the long-lost \"Huangdi Sijing\" (\"Yellow Emperor's Four Classics\").\n\nThe syncretism of \"Legalistic\" texts like that of Shen Dao and the Han Feizi are sometimes considered early examples of Huang–Lao. The more purely administrative Shen Buhai was said to be the earliest known political philosopher to have been influenced by such ideology. However, Sima Tan's argument that Shen Buhai and Shen Dao studied Huang–Lao is problematic. As its spokesman, Sima Tan probably pushes back Huang–Lao's origin as far as possible. Huang–Lao's rule of law differs fundamentally, for instance, from that of Han Fei, favouring naturalism. It also acts as more of a theoretical constraint on the ruler. Neither Shen Buhai nor Shen Dao ever attempts to articulate natural or ethical foundations for Fa (administrative method), nor provide any metaphysical grounds for appointment (xing-ming). The Han Huang–Lao work Boshu grounds fa and Xing-Ming in the Taoist Dao.\n\nA number of chapters of the \"Guanzi\", which places considerable importance on traditional Confucian values, express a blend of what may be considered Legalistic, Confucian, and Daoistic philosophy that might be termed \"Huang-Lao\". Having its base in Qi, it spread south to develop in areas belonging to Chu. Chu culture being inherited by the Han dynasty, preceding the consolidation of the realm deft Han Emperors like Jing would be steeped in a Taoistic laissez-faire, and later texts lile the Huainanzi include naturalist arguments against rule by law (\"Chinese Legalism\") in favour of rule by worthies on the basis that one needs their competence for such things as diplomacy. Making use of other aspects of Fa-Jia philosophy, with the dominance of Confucian orthodoxy, historically all such material would often be criticized as Fa-Jia.\n\nTwo influential ministers of Emperor Gaozu of Han reportedly studied and applied Huang–Lao political ideology, Chancellors Cao Shen (d. 190 BCE) and his successor Chen Ping (d. 178 BCE) employed the policy of \"wuwei\" (\"inaction\") and brought peace and stability to the state of Qi (van Ess 1993:163). Chao Cuo (d. 154 BCE), Chancellor to Emperor Jing, was another Huang–Lao official. He believed that the imperial rule should combine Huang–Lao and Confucianism, with punishment supplemented by reward, and coercion mitigated by persuasion. (Fu 1993:49)\n\nDuring the Eastern Han period, the Way of the Celestial Masters movement incorporated Daoist immortality techniques with Huang-Lao thought, and was associated with the Yellow Turban Rebellion and Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion (184 – 215 CE). \"Later on, virtually all of the early texts disappeared and knowledge about original Huang-Lao was lost.\" (Yates 2008:508)\n\nBesides these received texts, the imperial library bibliography preserved in the (111 CE) \"Hanshu\" (\"Han History\") lists many books titled with the Yellow Emperor's name. However, with the exception of the medical \"Huangdi Neijing\" (\"Yellow Emperor's Internal Classic\"), all were believed destroyed or lost – until the recent Mawangdui discoveries.\n\nThe Mawangdui Silk Texts discovered near Changsha in 1973 included four manuscripts that some scholars interpret as primary Huang–Lao texts.\n\nSilk manuscripts found in Mawangdui tomb number three, dated 186 BCE, included two versions of the \"Daodejing\", one of which (\"B\" or \"yi\" 乙) had copies of four texts attached in front. They are titled (tr. Peerenboom 1993:6) \"Jingfa\" (經法 \"Canonical Laws\" or \"Standards of Regularity\"), \"Shiliujing\" (十六經 \"Sixteen Classics\", also read as \"Shidajing\" 十大經 \"Ten Great Classics\"), \"Cheng\" (稱 \"Weighing by the Scales\", a collection of aphorisms), and \"Yuandao\" (原道 \"Origins of the Way\", also the title of \"Huainanzi\" chapter 1).\n\nSome Chinese specialists, such as Tang Lan (唐兰, 1975) and Yu Mingguang (余明光, 1993), interpreted these four manuscripts as the no longer extant \"Huangdi Sijing\" (黃帝四經 \"Yellow Emperor's Four Classics\"), which the \"Yiwenzhi\" (藝文志) bibliography of the \"Hanshu\" listed as having four sections. Tang's reasons included the \"Jingfa\" and \"Shiliujing\" titles with \"jing\" (經 \"classic; canon\") and the frequent references to Huangdi (\"Yellow Emperor\") in the \"Shiliujing\".\n\nOther specialists, such as Robin Yates (1997) and Edmund Ryden (1997), interpreted the four manuscripts as mutually incompatible texts deriving from diverse philosophical traditions. Paola Carrozza (2002:61) refers to this approach as \"different authors, different times, and different places.\"\nConsequently, many of the interpretations of the nature and characteristics of Huang-Lao Taoist thought that have been based on a reading of the Mawangdui manuscripts are debatable, since they are based on the assumption that these texts form an integral whole and are really affiliated with Huang-Lao. (Yates 2008:509) \n\nSinologists have long disputed the nature of Huang–Lao philosophy. Before the 1973 Mawangdui excavation, some western interpretations of Huang–Lao were fanciful. For instance, Herbert J. Allen (1906:268) proposed that since Han prince Liu Ying practiced both Huang–Lao and Buddhism, Huang–Lao did not mean Huangdi and Laozi, but \"Buddhists (literally Yellow-Ancients, perhaps so-called from the colour of their garments).\" Following the Mawangdui discoveries, the \"Huang-Lao craze\" (Roth 1997:300) in scholarship has significantly reshaped our understanding of early Daoism.\n\nTu Wei-Ming (1979:102-108) describes five common doctrines in the Huang–Lao silk texts. \"Dao\" (道 \"way; path\") is the ultimate basis for \"fa\" (法 \"model; law\") and \"li\" (理 \"pattern; principle\") essential for sagely governance. The true king uses \"guan\" (觀 \"see; observe; contemplate\") or \"penetrating insight\" to observe the inner workings of the universe, and \"cheng\" (稱 \"balance; scale; steelyard\") enables timely responses to the challenges of the world. Loewe (1999:986-7) lists another principal idea of the Huang–Lao silk texts: \"xingming\" (刑名 \"forms and names\"), which is usually associated with Shen Buhai. \"Xing\" (\"form or reality\") exist first and should be followed by their \"ming\" (\"name or description\").\nOur limited exposure to the \"lost texts\" in the Silk Manuscripts seems to indicate that the thought of Huang-Lao contains several apparently unrelated but actually fully integrated philosophical concepts: a cosmological vision of the Way (\"tao\") as the primordial source of inspiration; an administrative technique (\"fa-li\"), based on the principle and model of the naturalness of the Way; a concern for the cultivation of penetrating insight (\"kuan\"), so that a king could reign without imposing his limited, self-centered view on the order of things originally manifested in nature; and the necessity of attaining a kind of dynamic balancing (\"ch'eng\") in order to ensure a steady flow, as it were, of the political system as a mirror image of the cosmos. (1979:108)\nTu (1979:107) concludes, \"The Huang-Lao doctrine is neither Taoist nor Legalist in the conventional sense, nor is it, strictly speaking, a form of Legalized Taoism. It is rather, a unique system of thought.\"\n\nJohn S. Major (1983:12) summarizes Huang–Lao ideology. Dao is the \"highest and most primary expression of universal potentiality, order, and potency\", and \"is expressed in cosmic order, which embraces both the world of nature and the human world.\" Royal government must conform to natural order, thus the king should practice \"wuwei\" (\"non-striving\" or \"taking no action contrary to nature\") and use his \"shenming\" (神明 \"penetrating insight\") to \"learn all that can be learned about the natural order, so as to make his actions conform with it.\" Therefore, \"The government of the true king is neither sentimental nor vacillating, and neither arbitrary nor domineering,\" it fully conforms with the \"pattern of the Dao as expressed in the natural order, it is balanced, moderate, and irresistibly strong.\"\n\nRandall P. Peerenboom (1990) recaps, \"Huang-Lao's Boshu, while advocating a rule of law compatible with an organismic cosmology, is unique in that it supports a natural law grounded in the natural order.\" Peerenboom (1993:27-31) characterizes Huang–Lao as \"foundational naturalism\", meaning naturalism based upon a cosmic natural order that includes both the \"rendao\" (人道 \"way of humans\") and \"tiandao\" (天道 \"way of Heaven\"). Huang–Lao ideology gives \"normative priority\" to the natural order, with human social order based upon and in harmony with the cosmic order.\n\nJeffrey L. Richey (2006:336-339) contrasts Huang–Lao and Mohist theories about the cosmic roots of \"fa\" \"law\". In the \"Jingfa\", \"fa\" originates with the impersonal \"Dao\"; in the \"Mozi\", it originates with the anthropomorphic \"Tian\" (\"heaven; god\").\n\nHarold D. Roth (1991, 1997) contends that the original meaning of Chinese \"Daojia\" (道家 \"Daoism\") was Huang–Lao instead of the traditional understanding as \"Lao-Zhuang\" (老莊, namely the \"Laozi\" and \"Zhuangzi\" texts) Daoism. Sima Tan coined the term \"Daojia\" in his \"Shiji\" summary of the six philosophical \"jia\" (\"schools\").\nThe Taoist school enables man's numinous essence to be concentrated and unified, to move in unison with the formless, and to provide adequately for the myriad things. As for its methods, it follows the general tendency of the Naturalists (\"Yinyang chia\"), picks out the best of the Confucians and Mohists, and adopts the essentials of the Terminologists (\"Ming-chia\") and Legalists. It shifts with the times and changes in response to things; and in establishing customs and in practical applications it is nowhere unsuitable. The general drift of its teaching is simple and easy to hold onto, much is achieved with little effort. (tr. Roth 1991:605)\nThus, Huang–Lao Daoism incorporated concepts from five traditions: School of Naturalists, Confucianism, Mohism, School of Names, and Legalism. Roth (2004:8) describes the hallmarks of Huang–Lao: the ruler should use self-transformation \"as a technique of government, the emphasis on the precise coordination of the political and cosmic orders by the thus-enlightened ruler, and a syncretic social and political philosophy that borrows relevant ideas from the earlier Legalist and the Confucian schools while retaining the Taoist cosmological context.\"\n\n\n"}

The Court was to come about as a result of its recognition as a legal non-Jewish religious court inside of the state of Israel and was to be composed of the appointed members from the IBC.(p. 152) Despite his efforts, the Court had not yet come into existence at the time of Shoghi Effendi’s death in 1957.\n\nFrom this point forward the IBC operated under the direction of the Custodial Hands of the Cause and they agreed to carry out Shoghi Effendi's plans for its evolvement.(\"Ministry of the Custodians\", p. 37) In November 1959 the Hands announced to the Bahá'í world that the International Bahá'í Council would go from an appointed body to an elected body.

She was also the older sister of Crown prince Dara Shikoh and Emperor Aurangzeb.\n\nAfter Mumtaz Mahal died in 1631 from complications of giving birth to her fourteenth child, Gauharara Begum, Jahanara became the First Lady (Padshah Begum) of the Mughal Empire, despite the fact that her father had three other consorts.\n\nJahanara's early education was entrusted to Sati al-Nisa Khanam, the sister to Jahangir's poet laureate, Talib Amuli. Sati al-Nisa Khanam was known for her knowledge of the Qur'an and Persian literature as well as for her knowledge of etiquette, housekeeping, and medicine. She also served as principal lady-in-waiting for Mumtaz Mahal, Jahanara's mother.\n\nMany of the women in the imperial household were accomplished at reading and writing poetry and painting. They also played chess, polo and hunted outdoors. The women had access to the late Emperor Akbar's library, full of books on world religions and Persian, Turkish and Indian literature. Jahanara was no exception. She was engaged in her daily game of chess with her father Shah Jahan when they first learned of Mumtaz Mahal's difficulty with labor. Jahanara rushed to her mother's side but could do nothing to save her.\n\nUpon the death of Mumtaz in 1631, Jahanara, aged 17, took the place of her mother as First Lady of the Empire, despite her father having three other wives. As well as caring for her younger brothers and sisters, she is also credited with bringing her father out of mourning and restoring normality to a court darkened by her mother's death and her father's grief.\n\nOne of her tasks after the death of her mother was to oversee, with the help of Sati al-Nisa Khanam, the betrothal and wedding of her brother, Dara Shikoh to Begum Nadira Banu, which had been originally planned by Mumtaz Mahal, but postponed by her death.\n\nHer father frequently took her advice and entrusted her with charge of the Imperial Seal. In 1644 when Aurangzeb angered his father Shah Jahan, Jahanara interceded on Aurangzeb's behalf and convinced Shah Jahan to pardon him and restore his rank. Shah Jahan's fondness for his daughter was reflected in the multiple titles that he bestowed upon her, which included: Sahibat al-Zamani (\"Lady of the Age\") and Padishah Begum (\"Lady Emperor\"), or Begum Sahib (\"Princess of Princesses\").\nHer power was such that, unlike the other imperial princesses, she was allowed to live in her own palace, outside the confines of the Agra Fort.\n\nIn March 1644, just days after her thirtieth birthday, Jahanara suffered serious burns to her body and almost died of her injuries. Shah Jahan ordered that vast sums of alms be given to the poor, prisoners be released, and prayers offered for the recovery of the princess. Aurangzeb, Murad, and Shiastah Khan returned to Delhi to see her. Accounts differ as to what happened. Some say Jahanara's garments, doused in fragrant perfume oils, caught fire. Others accounts assert that the princess's favorite dancing-woman's dress caught fire and the princess coming to her aid was burnt herself on the chest.\n\nDuring her illness, Shah Jahan, was so concerned for the welfare of his favourite daughter, that he made only brief appearances at his daily durbar in the \"diwan-i-am\". Royal physicians failed to heal Jahanara's burns. A Persian doctor came to treat her and her condition improved for a number of months but then there was no further improvement until a royal page named Arif Chela mixed an ointment that after two more months finally caused the wounds to close. A year after the accident, Jahanara had fully recovered.\n\nAfter the accident, the princess went on a pilgrimage to Moinuddin Chishti’s shrine in Ajmer.\n\nAfter her recovery, Shah Jahan gave Jahanara rare gems and jewellery and bestowed upon her the revenues of the port of Surat. She later visited Ajmer, following the example set by her great-grandfather Akbar.\n\nJahanara was very wealthy. In honor of his coronation, 6 February 1628, Shah Jahan awarded his wife Mumtaz Mahal, Jahanara's mother, 100,000 ashrafis (Persian gold coins worth two Mohurs), 600,000 rupees and an annual privy purse of one million rupees. Jahanara received 100,000 ashrafis, 400,000 rupees and an annual grant of 600,000. Upon Mumtaz Mahal's death her personal fortune was divided by Shah Jahan between Jahanara Begum (who received half) and the rest of Mumtaz Mahal's surviving children.\n\nJahanara was allotted income from a number of villages and owned gardens including, Bagh-i-Jahanara, Bagh-i-Nur and Bagh-i-Safa, \"Her \"jagir\" included the villages of Achchol, Farjahara and the \"Sarkars\" of Bachchol, Safapur and Doharah. The \"pargana\" of Panipat was also granted to her.\" As mentioned above, she was also given the prosperous city of Surat.\n\nJahangir's mother owned a ship which traded between Surat and the Red Sea. Nur Jahan continued with a similar business trading in indigo and cloth trades. Later, Jahanara continued the tradition. She owned a number of ships and maintained trade relations with the English and the Dutch.\n\nJahanara was known for her active part in looking after the poor and financing the building of mosques. When her ship, the \"Sahibi\" was to set sail for its first journey (on 29 October 1643), she ordered that the ship make its voyage to Mecca and Medina and, \"... that every year fifty \"koni\" (One Koni was 4 Muns or 151 pounds) of rice should be sent by the ship for distribution among the destitute and needy of Mecca.\"\n\nAs de facto Primary Queen of the Mughal empire, Jahanara was responsible for charitable donations. She organized almsgiving on important state and religious days, supported famine relief and pilgrimages to Mecca.\n\nJahanara made important financial contributions in support of learning and the arts. She supported the publication of a series of works on Islamic mysticism, including commentaries on Rumi's \"Mathnawi,\" a very popular mystical work among in Mughal India.\n\nTogether with her brother Dara Shikoh, she was a disciple of Mullah Shah Badakhshi, who initiated her into the Qadiriyya Sufi order in 1641. Jahanara Begum made such progress on the Sufi path that Mullah Shah would have named her his successor in the Qadiriyya, but the rules of the order did not allow this.\n\nShe wrote a biography of Moinuddin Chishti, the founder of the Chishtiyah order in India, titled \"Mu’nis al-Arwāḥ\", as well as a biography of Mullah Shah, titled \"Risālah-i Ṣāḥibīyah\", in which she also described her initiation by him. Her biography of Moinuddin Chishti is highly regarded for its judgment and literary quality. In it she regarded him as having initiated her spiritually four centuries after his death, described her pilgrimage to Ajmer and spoke of herself as a \"faqīrah\" to signify her vocation as a Sufi woman.\n\nJahanara Begum stated that she and her brother Dārā were the only descendants of Timur to embrace Sufism. However, Aurangzeb was spiritually trained as a follower of Sufism as well. As a patron of Sufi literature, she commissioned translations of and commentaries on many works of classical literature.\n\nShah Jahan became seriously ill in 1657. A war of succession broke out among his four sons, Dara Shikoh, Shah Shuja, Aurangzeb and Murad Baksh.\n\nDuring the war of succession Jahanara supported her brother Dara Shikoh, eldest son of Shah Jahan. When Dara Shikoh's generals sustained a defeat at Dharmat (1658) at the hands of Aurangzeb, Jahanara wrote a letter to Aurangzeb and advised him not to disobey his father and fight with his brother. She was unsuccessful. Dara was badly defeated in the battle of Samugarh (29 May 1658) and fled towards Delhi.\n\nShah Jahan did everything he could to stop the planned invasion of Agra. He asked Jahanara to use her feminine diplomacy to convince Murad and Shuja not to throw their weight on the side of Aurangzeb.\n\nIn June 1658, Aurangzeb besieged his father Shah Jahan in the Agra Fort forcing him to surrender unconditionally by cutting off the water supply. Jahanara came to Aurangzeb on 10 June proposing a partition of the empire. Dara Shikoh would be given the Punjab and adjoining territories; Shuja would get Bengal; Murad would get Gujarat; Aurangzeb’s son Sultan Muhammad would get the Deccan and the rest of the empire would go to Aurangzeb. Aurangzeb refused Jahanara’s proposition on the grounds that Dara Shikoh was an infidel.\n\nOn Aurangzeb's ascent to the throne, Jahanara joined her father in imprisonment at the Agra Fort, where she devoted herself to his care until his death in 1666.\n\nAfter the death of their father, Jahanara and Aurangzeb were reconciled. He gave her the title, \"Empress of Princesses\" and she replaced Roshanara as First Lady.\n\nJahanara was soon secure enough in her position to occasionally argue with Aurangzeb and have certain special privileges which other women did not possess. She argued against Aurangzeb's strict regulation of public life in accordance with his conservative religious beliefs and his decision in 1679 to restore the poll tax on non-Muslims, which she said would alienate his Hindu subjects.\n\nJahanara had her tomb built during her lifetime. It is constructed entirely of white marble with a screen of trellis work and open to the sky.\n\nUpon her death, Aurangzeb gave her the posthumous title: Sahibat-uz-Zamani (\"Mistress of the Age\"). Jahanara is buried in a tomb in the Nizamuddin Dargah complex in New Delhi, which is considered \"remarkable for its simplicity\". The inscription on the tomb reads as follows:\nAllah is the Living, the Sustaining.\nLet no one cover my grave except with greenery,\nFor this very grass suffices as a tomb cover for the poor.<br>\nThe mortal simplistic Princess Jahanara,\nDisciple of the Khwaja Moin-ud-Din Chishti,\nDaughter of Shah Jahan the Conqueror\nMay Allah illuminate his proof.\n1092 [1681 AD]\nJahanara Begum's caravanserai that formed the original Chandni Chowk, from Sir Thomas Theophilus Metcalf's 1843 album\n\nIn Agra she is best known for sponsoring the building of the Jami Masjid or Friday Mosque in 1648 in the heart of the old city. The Mosque was funded entirely by Jahanara from her personal allowance. She founded a madrasa which was attached to the Jama Masjid for the promotion of education.\n\nShe also made a significant impact on the landscape of the capital city of Shahjahanabad. Of the eighteen buildings in the city of Shahjahanabad commissioned by women, Jahanara commissioned five of them. All of Jahanara's building projects were completed around the year 1650, inside the city walls of Shahjahanabad. The best known of her projects was Chandni Chowk, the main street in the walled city of Old Delhi.\n\nShe constructed an elegant caravanserai on the East side of the street with gardens in the back. Herbert Charles Fanshawe, in 1902, mentions about the serai:\n\nThe serai was later replaced by a building now known as the Town Hall, and the pool in the middle of the square was replaced by a grand clock tower (Ghantaghar).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12438642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12438642", "title": "Jewish prenuptial agreement", "text": "Jewish prenuptial agreement\n\nThe Jewish prenuptial agreement has been developed in recent times with the stated intent of keeping the Jewish woman from becoming an agunah in cases where the husband refuses to grant her a get (Jewish bill of divorce). Without such an agreement, Jewish marriages cannot be dissolved without the consent and cooperation of both spouses. This new type of prenuptial agreement makes provisions for the possibility of divorce. By setting up rules prior to the marriage in the form of a contract, both spouses have an interest to negotiate a divorce in a dignified manner, and get-refusal is avoided.\n\nHalakha (Jewish law) states that in order for a Jewish divorce to be valid, the husband must place a get in his wife's hands out of his own free will (Yebamot, 14:1). If he does not have the intent to divorce his wife, no other party—person or court, can do so in his stead. A Jewish woman chained to her marriage because of her husband's inability to grant her a get, is referred to as an agunah. As of late, common usage has applied the term agunah to include a victim of get-refusal.\n\nWhen discussing the agunah problem, a distinction must be drawn between the classic definition of an agunah and a victim of get-refusal. Halakhically, an agunah is a woman whose husband has disappeared and it is not known whether he is alive or dead. The example used is the passenger on a boat that sank in “waters that have no end” (Babylonian Talmud, Yevamot, chapter 10). The case of the classic agunah still possibly exists today: The wives of several men who were killed on 9/11 potentially could have been declared agunot, however, with the combined international legal efforts of several prominent Orthodox Rabbis, all these cases were resolved and the women were permitted to remarry. A more prevalent problem is that of a husband who is alive and well, but refuses to give his wife a get. A woman in these circumstances is called a mesorevet get - a woman who is refused a get.\n\nThe problem of get-refusal became more widespread when Jews lived in countries where civil divorce was available, separate from religious divorce. The earliest prenuptial agreement for the prevention of get-refusal was developed and accepted by the Rabbinical Council of Morocco on December 16, 1953 (\"Sefer Hatakanot\", Vol. 1, The Institute for Moroccan Jewish Tradition, Jerusalem). The prenuptial agreement gained further approbation in 1981 from Rabbi Shalom Messas, chief rabbi of Jerusalem (\"Sefer Tevuot Shemesh\", Jerusalem 1981). Following Rabbi Messas' involvement, the Rabbinical Council of America actively pursued this issue (“The RCA Commission: Solving the Problem of Gittin\", Hamevaser, Vol. 22 No. 2, October 27, 1983). The latest in a series of RCA resolutions -- \"that since there is a significant agunah problem in America and throughout the Jewish world, no rabbi should officiate at a wedding where a proper prenuptial agreement on get has not been executed”—was passed on May 18, 2006.\n\nIn the United States, the most prominent prenuptial agreement for the prevention of get-refusal signed within the Orthodox Jewish community is the agreement of the Beth Din of America. It is a “binding arbitration agreement.” The Beth Din, accepted by both bride and groom as an arbitration panel, is legally enabled to render a binding decision in all issues relating to a get. This ensures that all adjudication leading up to the administration of a get is done according to Orthodox halakha, by Rabbinical Judges. The clauses of the prenuptial agreement delineate the rules accepted by the signatories, according to which the Rabbinical Court should rule. There are optional clauses authorizing the court to rule on monetary matters or child custody and related issues. The entire agreement is in keeping with the law of the State where it is signed and can be enforced as a binding arbitration agreement in the State Court.\n\nThe heart of the prenuptial agreement is the monetary obligation undertaken by the groom. He obligates himself to support his wife at a particular rate (from the point of separation) as long as they are married according to Jewish law, if the Beth Din renders a decision enforcing this obligation. In essence this means that from the point that his wife asks for a get and the Beth Din recommends that he deliver the get, until he gives the get, the husband is obligated “to support my Wife-to-Be from the date that our domestic residence together shall cease for whatever reasons, at the rate of … in lieu of my Jewish law obligation of support so long as the two of us remain married according to Jewish law….”\n\nThe director of the Beth Din of America, Rabbi Yona Reiss, has repeatedly stated in public arenas (orally and weekly in the NY newspaper The Jewish Press) that to his knowledge, the \"prenuptial agreement is one hundred percent effective. In every case of a couple that had previously signed a prenuptial agreement and later came to divorce, there was a get delivered in a timely fashion.\".\n\nThe Organization for the Resolution of Agunot (ORA) began its Agunah Prevention Initiative to educate the North American Jewish community about the importance of standardizing the use of the prenuptial agreement to prevent situations of get-refusal. In November 2014, they released a video to promote the message that \"friends don't let friends get married without the prenup.\"\n\nThere are additional prenuptial agreements for the prevention of get-refusal which have been signed in the US. Orthodox Rabbi Moshe Tendler offers an alternate version.\n\nConservative Judaism has sought to prevent cases of get-refusal by attaching a clause to the ketuba, as opposed to a separate prenuptial agreement, known as the Lieberman clause: The parties agree that if there are civil divorce proceedings, then both must appear before a beit din of the Rabbinical Assembly and of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. Rabbi Saul Lieberman, a professor at the Jewish Theological Seminary, proposed that the clause be added to the ketuba to create a legal remedy through civil courts in case one party fails to cooperate in Jewish divorce proceedings. The Women's League of Conservative Judaism officially endorsed the use of the Lieberman clause in combination with a prenuptial agreement in 2008. In practice, women have been successful in getting courts to enforce the \"Lieberman Clause\", though not always the Ketubah itself, in U.S. state courts, including the highest court of the state of New York, though continuing questions about the legal validity of the document have led the Conservative Rabbincal Assembly to encourage the signing of a letter of intent together with the clause.\n\nA different agreement developed in Israel in Hebrew, called the Heskem L’Kavod Hadadi (the Agreement for Mutual Respect) was authored by a team of two rabbis and a rabbinical court advocate — Rabbi Dr. David Ben Zazon, Rabbi Elyashiv Knohl and Dr. Rachel Levmore — in consultation with experts in various fields (Jewish law, Rabbinic courts, family law, women’s organizations, psychology). This particular agreement is recommended by concerned organizations, rabbinic as well as feminist, including the director of the Israeli rabbinical courts, Rabbi Eli Ben-Dahan. The prenuptial agreement essentially works on a similar principle of spousal support in the case of recalcitrance as that of the Beth Din of America. However, in the Agreement for Mutual Respect the obligation is mutual. Both the bride and the groom obligate themselves to support his or her spouse, the amount ranging from $1500 per month to half his/her monthly net income. The obligation is activated after notification followed by a defined waiting period, if the couple is still married according to halakha. If a spouse is willing to give/accept a get unconditionally at that point, his/her obligation is voided. In this manner only the recalcitrant spouse‘s obligation will remain in effect. Obviously, if a get were administered during the waiting period, neither spouse is obligated to the other. There are additional matters covered by this agreement, such as: If one of the spouses demands marital therapy, the other must comply up to three visits; the community property law of the State of Israel is accepted as halakha for those that sign the agreement.\n\nThe Council of Young Israel Rabbis in Israel, in cooperation with Rabbi Yonah Reiss and Rabbi Professor Michael Broyde, both of the Beth Din of America, translated the Agreement for Mutual Respect into English. A clause is included which assigns jurisdiction to the Beth Din of America in the case where the Agreement for Mutual Respect itself would prove to be unenforceable for any reason in the State of Israel or \"in the jurisdiction that the parties reside in at the time that either one of them seeks enforcement of its provisions\". Under those circumstances the Agreement for Mutual Respect converts into a binding arbitration agreement with the Beth Din of America assigned as the arbiter. This same agreement has been translated from the original Hebrew also into French, Spanish. and Russian.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the London Beth Din offers a prenuptial agreement which is in essence a generic arbitration agreement appointing the London Beth Din as arbiter \"in the event of any matrimonial dispute, they will both attend the Court of the Chief Rabbi, the London Beth Din … when required to do so and that they will comply with the instructions of that Beth Din, including co-operation in any mediation recommended, in seeking to resolve all problems arising out of or in connection with their Jewish marriage.\" A more detailed agreement, based on the Israeli \"Agreement for Mutual Respect\", which was adapted to the specifics of British family law was drawn up by Dr. Rachel Levmore with British barrister Daniel Clarke, called \"The Prenuptial Agreement for Mutual Respect (PAMR) for use in England\".\n\nSome rabbis have expressed halakhic reservations with the Jewish prenuptial agreement. \n\nOn May 4, 2015, Rabbi Sholom Shuchat delivered a speech decrying the use of the prenup, explaining why it may disqualify any get obtained as a result of it.\n\nOn August 2, 2015, Rabbi Moshe Sternbuch announced that the Beth Din of America prenuptial agreement results in potentially disqualified gittin. \nOthers have objected to the Heskem L’Kavod Hadadi.\n\n\n\n"}

In sources deriving from the Sthaviravāda branch, he is taken to be the founder of the Mahāsāṃghikas, and the figure who caused the split between the two branches. According to this account, some 35 years after the Second Buddhist Council at Pāṭaliputra, there was another meeting over five points allegedly held by a figure named Mahādeva. These five points were essentially regarding doctrines of the fallibility and imperfection of arhats, which were opposed by some. In this account, the majority (Mahāsaṃgha) sided with Mahādeva, and the minority (Sthaviras) were opposed to it, thus causing a split in the Saṃgha.\n\nHowever, scholars have generally agreed that the matter of dispute was a matter of vinaya instead. In the earliest account, the council was convened at Pāṭaliputra over matters of vinaya, and it is explained that the schism resulted from the majority (Mahāsaṃgha) refusing to accept the addition of rules to the Vinaya by the minority (Sthaviras). This account is bolstered by the vinaya texts themselves, as vinayas associated with the Sthaviras do contain more rules than those of the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya. For example, the Mahāsāṃghika Prātimokṣa has 67 rules in the \"śaikṣa-dharma\" section, while the Theravāda version has 75 rules. Modern scholarship is generally in agreement that the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya is the oldest. Joseph Walser concludes that this Mahādeva was most likely a literary figure.\n\nThe \"Samayabhedoparacanacakra\" records that Mahādeva was a completely different figure who was the founder of the Caitika sect over 100 years later. A number of scholars have concluded that an association of \"Mahādeva\" with the first schism was a later sectarian interpolation. Jan Nattier and Charles Prebish state that Mahādeva was the later founder of the Caitikas, stating:\n\nNumerous legends about Mahādeva exist, all of which refer to the figure who supposedly caused the first schism in the Buddhist saṃgha.\n\nHe was ordained at Kukkutarama in Pataliputra, before taking the head of the sangha. The story of his transformation from a sinner of the worst kind to a learned monk was among the collection of tales relating to Buddhism, taken back to China by Xuanzang. The story of his transformation is titled as \"The sins of Mahadeva\".\nHis father was a wealthy and ambitious trader who had married at a very young age. He often went away to foreign lands to trade and amass wealth. It is said that Mahadeva had a very pleasant and radiant face. But he was unfortunate not to get the love of his father during his childhood. In his teens he committed his first sin, by indulging in an incestuous relationship with his mother. Mahadeva was frightened of his father coming to know about this relationship and hence murdered him, thereby committing his second cardinal sin. He then, in order to escape from the guilt ran away with his mother to a distant land and started life fresh. But there, one day he ran into an old neighbour who was on a tour to the land that Mahadeva had made his new home. The man was treated as a guest and was given refuge for a few days in Mahadeva's house. After a few days the guest started asking questions about Mahadeva's sudden disappearance from his native land. Mahadeva felt threatened and poisoned the guest, thereby committing his third cardinal sin. Some years later he began to doubt his mother, for whom he had committed all the murders. When he found that his mother was involved in a relationship with another man, Mahadeva felt emotionally wrecked and out of his frustration he murdered his mother thereby committing the fourth cardinal sin of his life. After this incident Mahadeva found his life meaningless and teetered on the brink of insanity. He, in fact was about to take his own life when he came to know that a Buddhist monk with a panacea for sinners had arrived in the town. Mahadeva decided to give his wretched life one more chance and approached the monk who was camping near Pataliputra. It was at this place that Mahadeva was ordained as member of the Buddhist sangha.\n"}

Farley (born April 15, 1935) is an American religious sister and a member of the Roman Catholic Sisters of Mercy. She was Gilbert L. Stark Professor Emerita of Christian Ethics at Yale University Divinity School, where she taught Christian ethics from 1971 to 2007.\n\nFarley is the first woman appointed to serve full-time on the Yale School board, along with Henri Nouwen as its first Catholic faculty members. She is a past president of Catholic Theological Society of America.\n\nFarley's controversial book, \"Just Love\" (2006), brought criticism and censure from the Holy See, specifically the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith for moral views which oppose the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, but her book and views has received both support and endorsement from the groups Leadership Conference of Women Religious and the Catholic Theological Society of America.\n\nFarley received Bachelor's and Masters of Arts degrees from the University of Detroit, followed by a degree in philosophy and a doctoral degree from Yale University She began her teaching career at the Yale Divinity School in 1971 and earned her doctorate there two years later. She appeared on the cover of the \"Yale Alumni Magazine\" in 1986 in connection with a feature article on teachers of note.\n\nIn 1986, Farley published \"Personal Commitments: Making, Keeping Breaking\", which a reviewer in the \"Journal of Religion\" wrote \"charts out what to watch for, when as a counselor, you are helping someone think through commitments\" and focuses on \"long-term commitments involving sexual intimacy\". He added: \"She does not display her erudition but hides it in footnotes. She expresses herself almost always in words available to the nonspecialist. She is courageous, breaking new ground.\" He singled out \"the way she succinctly links the long heritage of Jewish and Christian thinking about 'covenant' with her earlier exploration of human relationships.\" A reviewer in the \"Journal of the American Academy of Religion\" called it \"a valuable contribution to the literature of Christian ethics, and in particular to the discussion of the value of Christian love and special relationships. Farley has combined psychological subtlety and moral seriousness in such a way as to produce that rarity, a book that will be of great interest to the scholar, and yet would be useful in a parish or a counselor's office as well.\"\n\nFarley received the John Courtney Murray Award from the Catholic Theological Society of America (CTSA) in 1992. She has served as president of both the CTSA and the Society of Christian Ethics. Yale Divinity School presented a conference in her honor called Just Love: Feminism, Theology and Ethics in a Global Context in 2005.\n\nIn 2008 Farley received the University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award in Religion. A \"festschrift\" in her honor was published that same year.\n\nIn 1984 Farley was one of 97 theologians and religious persons who signed A Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion, calling for pluralism and discussion within the Catholic Church regarding the Church's position on abortion.\n\nEarly in her career, Farley called the ordination of women a \"moral imperative.\"\n\nIn 1987, discussing a Vatican document on procreation, Farley criticized its authors for not consulting women and especially \"parents who are struggling with these issues\". She said its exclusion of all means but sexual intercourse between husband and wife \"were not justified in terms of the complexity of the questions involved\" and predicted that \"People making decisions will not take it seriously. It doesn't offer them the answers they need. The church, by acting in an authoritarian way loses the kind of moral power regarding these issues.\"\n\nAsked in 1997 to comment on the decline of female enrollment in divinity schools in the United States, following their increased presence in the 1970s, Farley said that It's hard for them to have all that education and to know they can't be ordained. It challenges their faith and commitment. The possibility of ordination is looking dimmer, but I'm still optimistic that someday it may be possible or even needed. Catholicism is the only denomination with a shortage of clergy.\n\nIn 2001, when the Jesuit theologian Avery Dulles was named a cardinal and explained that the theologian's role was \"to show why the church is teaching what she is\", Farley contributed to a discussion of the changing role of the academic theologian. She said the theologian could play \"an exploratory role\" and added: \"If you're going to ask questions, you may come up with some wrong answers, but you may come up with new insights. The best kind of theologian is one who is anchored in the tradition\" but understands that it needs to address future generations.\n\nFarley participated in the Sisters of Mercy study on tubal ligation.\n\nFarley and fellow Mercy Sister Eileen P. Hogan founded the All-Africa Conference, a project intended to bring together African women religious to develop strategies for responding to the pandemic of HIV/AIDS in Africa.\n\nFarley currently holds the title of Professor Emerita at Yale Divinity School.\n\nFarley published \"Just Love: A Framework for Christian Sexual Ethics\" in 2006. The critical reception was \"widespread praise\", leading to its use as a textbook in college courses on sexual ethics. A reviewer in \"Commonweal\" noted that Farley \"at times ... has become a point of polarization\", called the book \"an important resource and spur for further collaboration among Christians and others on the knotty issues of sexual ethics\", but faulted it for \"pay[ing] little attention to the ecclesial character of sexual ethics\" and asked for \"a more robust engagement with both the problems and possibilities offered by biblical witness.\" He hoped the book would \"escape the sort of polarized responses that the temper of the times seems to elicit.\"\n\nOn March 29, 2010, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith wrote to Farley, detailing doctrinal problems that it found in \"Just Love\". Farley replied on October 28, 2010. The Congregation considered her response unsatisfactory and, because of the errors it discerned in a book had been \"a cause of confusion among the faithful\", commissioned the book to be reviewed by experts. On the basis of the experts' evaluation it decided on June 8, 2011 that the book did contain erroneous propositions and requested that she correct those propositions. It received a further response from Farley together with the opinions of her current religious superior and of the superior's predecessor. Considering this further response inadequate, it decided on December 14, 2011, to publish a Notification about what it considered to be problems. The Notification was issued on June 4, 2012, and mentioned specifically her views on \"masturbation, homosexual acts, homosexual unions, the indissolubility of marriage and the problem of divorce and remarriage\". The Notification concludes:.\n\nThe Congregation thus noted that Farley's teachings were a \"defective understanding of the objective nature of natural moral law\" and were \"in direct contradiction with Catholic teaching in the field of sexual morality\" and that such beliefs \"pose grave harm\" and counter the official teachings and moral tenets of the Roman Catholic Church. It stated that the book \"cannot be used as a valid expression of Catholic teaching, either in counseling and formation, or in ecumenical and interreligious dialogue.\"\n\nFarley commented that the book offers \"contemporary interpretations\" of justice and fairness in human sexual relations, moving away from a \"taboo morality\" and drawing on \"present-day scientific, philosophical, theological, and biblical resources.\" Farley also said: \"I can only clarify that the book was not intended to be an expression of current official Catholic teaching, nor was it aimed specifically against this teaching. It is of a different genre altogether.\"\n\nFarley's religious superior, Patricia McDermott, R.S.M., commented that she was sad that the Vatican had found fault with \"the significant pastoral and ethical thinking that are represented in [Farley's] book.\" The dean of Yale Divinity School, Harold W. Attridge, a Catholic layman, also issued a statement in support of Farley. So did 15 fellow scholars who, in a document released by the divinity school, testified to Farley's Catholic credentials and the influence she has had in the field of moral theology.\n\nThe Holy See's \"formal censure\" of Farley's work and its statements related to her book, \"Just Love: A Framework for Christian Sexual Ethics\", brought Farley's work wider public attention than she had ever received, \"causing it,\" according to \"New York Times\" columnist Maureen Dowd, \"to shoot from obscurity to the top tier of Amazon.com's best-seller list\". Dowd called the Vatican statement \"the latest chapter in the Vatican's thuggish crusade to push American nuns—and all Catholic women—back into moldy subservience.\" Several news publications both in print and in media maintain that Farley was not writing a book on Catholic catechism, but an ecumenical discussion \"distinguishing of practical and speculative questions from [Catholic] magisterial or official teaching.\"\n\nOn June 8, 2012, Farley addressed a session devoted to the Vatican's assessment of her book at the annual meeting of the Catholic Theological Society of America (CTSA). She said it reflected conflicting understandings of the theologian's role and concluded:\n\nThe CTSA membership voted \"overwhelmingly\" in favor of a statement of support for her.\n\n\n"}

A radical solipsism emerges that sees all conscious and unconscious life as part of one dream where meaning-making becomes completely associative\"; it also includes the declaration that the ultimate goal of mankind is (or should be) the bombardment and destruction of the planet Saturn (which hoped-for event was depicted on the book's cover).\n\n\"The Boo Hoo Bible\" was supplemented or superseded by Kleps' later book \"Millbrook: A Narrative of the Early Years of American Psychedelianism\" (1975, with new editions in 1977 and 2005) which provides an account of Kleps' founding of the organization along with a narrative of his experiences at the Hitchcock estate in Millbrook, New York, between 1963 and 1970, and describes the church's principles and doctrine as of the date of publication. \"Millbrook\" also includes philosophical interpretations of psychedelic experience and synchronicity and social and political commentary on aspects of the psychedelic movement.\nWhile it incorporated whimsical or even absurdist motifs – for instance, Church hymns included \"Puff the Magic Dragon\" and \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\" (with its solipsistic refrain of \"Life is but a dream\"), which fact did not help them in establishing their bona fides as a serious religion to the judge in \"United States vs. Kuch\" (see below) – this mainly extended to matters of form and organization. The actual theology was fully formed, serious, and culturally revolutionary in intent. Kleps testified that the absurdist elements of the Church were intended to show that all religions are invented and silly.\nThe Native American Church (no relation) was around this time fighting successfully in several state courts to uphold its legal permission to use peyote (normally a banned substance) in religious ceremonies; the Neo-American Church hoped to gain the same right, by analogy. One of the Church's ministers, Judith H. Kuch, was arrested and put on federal trial on narcotics charges in 1968. Kuch claimed that her use of LSD was a religious requirement.\n\nThe judge ruled that the Church's rituals did not merit protection under the First Amendment as he could find no evidence of \"a religious discipline, a ritual, or tenets to guide one's daily existence\" and that \"...the [Neo-American Church] membership is mocking established institutions [and] playing with words... There is a conscious effort to assert in passing the attributes of religion but obviously only for tactical purposes\" and that \"[i]t is clear that the desire to use drugs and to enjoy drugs for their own sake, regardless of religious experience, is the coagulant of this organization and the reason for its existence.\" This was an instance, rare in American Constitutional jurisprudence, of a judge finding as an issue of fact that someone does not actually hold the religious views she professes. (Regardless of the merits of the religion, the judge in any case found substantial state interest in denying the exemption.)\n\nThe Church reached its greatest notoriety around the time of this 1968 \"United States of America vs. Kuch\" case but continues into the 21st century as a small, loose organization. Membership in the Church is loosely defined but is based on assent to three principles: holding the psychedelic substances as sacraments, claiming their use as a basic human right, and defining enlightenment as \"the recognition that life is a dream and the externality of relations an illusion (solipsistic nihilism)\".\n\n"}

According to this Hindu tradition the man who was appointed must be or would most likely be a revered person. There were various clauses associated with this process:\n\n\nIn niyoga, the bodies were to be covered with ghee (so that lust may not take root in the minds of the participants but the actual act may take place for conception).\n\nThe epic \"Mahabharata\" describes one instance of niyoga. Queen Satyavati compels her son and sage Vyasa to perform niyoga with the widows of her son Vichitravirya. The widows Ambika and Ambalika and one of their maids bear Dhritarashtra, Pandu and Vidura respectively.\n\nIn the Manusmṛti, niyoga is described in IX.59-63, but the practice is also forbidden in IX.64-68. This text (IX.167) describes the child born by niyoga as a \"kshetraja\" child of the husband-wife.\n\nNiyoga is the central issue of Anahat, a Marathi feature film directed by Amol Palekar. It was showcased at the International Film Festival of India 2003.\n\nThe movie has this practice as the central plot. The title character played by Amitabh Bachchan is torn between his duty and the emotions for his children begotten by the practice of niyoga.\n\nIt is also portrayed in the 1989 film Oonch Neech Beech, where the character played by Kulbhushan Kharbanda, a sanyasi, is commanded by his teacher to perform niyoga.\n\n"}

The Irunmọlẹ are meant to guide creation and particularly humanity on how to live and succeed on Earth (\"Ayé\"). Most Òrìṣà are said to be deities previously existing in the spirit world (\"Òrun\") as Irunmọlẹ, while others are said to be humans who are recognized as deities upon their deaths due to extraordinary feats. \n\nMany Òrìṣà have found their way to most of the New World as a result of the Atlantic slave trade and are now expressed in practices as varied as Santería, Candomblé, Trinidad Orisha, Umbanda, and Oyotunji, among others. The concept of orisha is similar to those of deities in the traditional religions of the Bini people of Edo State in southern Nigeria, the Ewe people of Benin, Ghana, and Togo, and the Fon people of Benin.\n\nYoruba tradition often says that there are 400 + 1 Òrìṣà, which is associated with a sacred number. Other sources suggest that the number is \"as many as you can think of, plus one more – an innumerable number.\" Different oral traditions refer to 400, 700, or 1,440 orisha.\n\nPractitioners traditionally believe that daily life depends on proper alignment and knowledge of one's \"ori\". \"Ori\" literally means the head, but in spiritual matters, it is taken to mean a portion of the soul that determines personal destiny.\n\nSome òrìṣà are rooted in ancestor worship; warriors, kings, and founders of cities were celebrated after death and joined the pantheon of Yoruba deities. The ancestors did not die, but were seen to have \"disappeared\" and become òrìṣà. Some orishas based on historical figures are confined to worship in their families or towns of origin; others are venerated across wider geographic areas.\n\n\" Ashe\" is the life-force that runs through all things, living and inanimate. It is described as the power to make things happen. It is an affirmation that is used in greetings and prayers, as well as a concept of spiritual growth. òrìṣà devotees strive to obtain \"Ashe\" through \"iwa-pele\", gentle and good character, and in turn they experience alignment with the \"ori\", what others might call inner peace and satisfaction with life. Ashe is divine energy that comes from Olodumare, the creator deity, and is manifested through Olorun, who rules the heavens and is associated with the sun. Without the sun, no life could exist, just as life cannot exist without some degree of \"ashe\". \"Ashe\" is sometimes associated with Eshu, the messenger òrìṣà. For practitioners, \"ashe\" represents a link to the eternal presence of the supreme deity, the Orishas, and the ancestors.\n\nThe concept is regularly referenced in Brazilian capoeira. \"Axé\" in this context is used as a greeting or farewell, in songs and as a form of praise. Saying that someone 'has axé' in capoeira is complimenting their energy, fighting spirit, and attitude.\n\nThe òrìṣà are grouped as those represented by the color white, who are characterized as \"tutu\" \"cool, calm, gentle, and temperate\"; and those represented by the colors red or black, who are characterized as \"gbigbona\" \"harsh, aggressive, demanding, and quick tempered\". As humans do, orisha may have a preferred color, foods, and objects. The traits of the orisha are documented through oral tradition.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Since all Buddhist teachings can be linked through this model, details found in different teachings can be used to elaborate and clarify aspects of it.\n\nThis Buddhist understanding of mind can be used in practical ways to create interventions which will facilitate psychological change in therapeutic and other contexts. The teachings of the Skandhas and Dependent origination describe a cycle of perception and attachment and examining the stages in this cycle suggest a number of different possibilities for therapeutic intervention.\n\nOther-centred approaches tend to focus on those interventions which relate to aspects of the cycle of human process which are connected to the world view. These are more amenable to change than those parts with which the person identifies. People are more willing to question their perception of others than their sense of self.\n\nOther centred models include developing clearer views of the other and moving beyond conditioned, self-invested interest. They include methods such as Naikan. This approach is being developed on the Tariki Psychotherapy Training Programme. The model can also be linked to mindfulness based approaches, particularly where these are interpreted in the light of the Satipatthana sutta in the overall context of Buddhist teachings.\n\n\n"}

The community is found mainly in Panangattiri village of Kollengode sub district, of Palakkad district and spread across Vallanghy, Nemmara, Alathur, Vadavannur and Vithanaserry.\n\nOther names used to refer this community are PathuMadom and Dashagotram.\n\nThe name is derived from two Tamil/Malayalam words, ‘Pathu’ and ‘Kudi’, which mean ten families, ten households, ten clans, ten classes, ten Gotras or ten mutts. The other names of this community are DashaGotram and PathuMadom, which also imply the same meaning.\n\nThe community is originated from a group of Shaivite Brahmins who were specialized in the field of gem business in Poompuhar, Tamil Nadu. They were considered as elite class in Poompuhar society and had a dignified life as equal to Chola emperor. The community has its origin from the direct disciples of JnanaSambandhan (a Brahmin child saint who revived Hinduism in Tamil land-7th century CE). The people of the community were expertise in both classical Tamil and Sanskrit languages. Though they were followers of Shaivite sect of Hinduism, they were also worshippers of Vishnu, Indra and Iravan. They were vegetarians and scholars of Vedic sciences and philosophies apart from their business profession. Though this community had business profession and had later adopted ‘Shreshthi’ (Chetti) title, they did not mix with other Vaishya communities and have lived according to Brahmin tradition. These merchant Brahmin lords had maintained a separate army and land in Chola Empire and were authorized to collect taxes in their region.\n\nLegend says that, centuries ago when a king of Chola Empire wished to marry a girl from this community. The community did not like that idea as alliances with other communities were prohibited. Though the community did not accept it, the king did not change his mind set. So the community, which comprises Ten Gotras, escaped from Chola kingdom at a midnight. Knowing this the king had sent his army men in search of them. As the community has understood imminent danger nearing them they scattered gems and other precious stones on their path to divert the attention of the soldiers. The soldiers spent much of the time to search these valuables in the sandy road. Though they escaped from soldiers but they could not find a solution when the nature came as an obstacle. It was a rainy season in Poompuhar. The Cauvery River was overflowing and they found it difficult to cross the river. They prayed at lord Ganesh temple nearby the river to save them if their deed was right. Their prayer got answered. The river got turned into two branches to enable them to cross the river without any difficulty. It is said that another Vaishya group who accompanied with them have taken a different route from there when they reached Avinashipattanam. By the advice of their Kula Guru they met Kollengode king. But Kollengode king asked them to contact Zamorin king of Kozhikode.\n\nThe Kula Guru of the community with his influence on Zamorin has made appointment for the community. They met Zamorin and had spent seven days in his palace. King Zamorin was highly impressed by the community leaders’ in depth knowledge of Vedic science, Puranas and on other various subjects. He had honored them by asking them to sit on silk-bed. While their stay at Kozhikkode, Chola emperor had sent his ambassadors to request the Zamorin to send them back to Poompuhar. But Zamorin had refused to do so and informed that the community is the distinguished guests of his kingdom. The community leaders then discarded their sacred thread after accepting the titles like Vadhyar, Panicker, Chettiyar (this title is a continuation from Poompuhar), Moothotty and Mannadiar from Zamorin. The king allowed the ten Mutts to be settled at his autonomous area in Palakkad called Panangattiry (which was also a land in dispute between kings of Palakkad and Zamorin). He asked both his counterparts of Kollengode and Palakkad to permit the community to lead an independent life as their own which should not be challenged by anyone of them at any cost.\n\nThe people of Panangattiry (ThenPanassai) has welcomed this community to their land and called them as ‘Pathukudi’ as they represent ten different Gotras. Later Pathukudi community was collectively known as ‘Pathukudi Panickers’ irrespective of their titles. They built a Nagaram (town) under the footage of Thenmala hills and became the Deshavazhis (rulers) of the land with the consent of king Zamorin. They chose central area of the land to protect them from any outside invasion and for the effective administration of the land. The adjoining areas were given to Tamil Brahmins, Gounders, and Kulalas etc. They built temples for Bhagavathy (Goddess), lord Siva, and lord Ganesh and for their tutelary deity lord Iravan. (Lord Iravan temple is only one temple for Iravan at Kerala state) The chief of the community became ‘Palakan’ (ruler or chieftain) of the land and has used title as Rajah in front of the name. Their mutts became known as ‘Tharavads’ as in local name and Rajah’s one was known as ‘Kovilakom’. He used the lion depicted flag. Some families migrated to different parts of Palakkad afterwards.\n\nPathukudi community’s prominence in the social set up came down after few centuries probably after decline of Zamorin dynasty. They led the rest of life as just petty landlords and agriculturalists. Their growth became stagnant at one stage due to rigid customs and disunity between different Tharavads. Later some Tharavads got ruined and after that some of the members became administrators in aristocratic Nair Tharavads. The community found a short fall in their count later because they were minority section in population in Kollengode. It is due to the same Gotra marriage is not permitted according to the customs and also alliances with other caste/-allied communities were strictly prohibited. So they solved the problem by splitting some ‘Tharavads’ into two numbers. But this was not a permanent solution. Then some ‘Tharavads’, which migrated to Kollengode, made alliance with Tharakan community (an Arya Vaishya community originated from Poompuhar) and a new community has originated in that region called ‘Pathukudi-Tharakan’ community. Some tharavads of Pathukudi community got revived later on with new names in Pananagattiri land.\n\nThe community generally follows Shaivite sect of Hinduism. As they are rooted from the disciples of JnanaSambandhan who revived Hinduism, they followed religious tolerance with other sects. So they gave importance to Vaishnavite gods. The ancestors of this community has preached that both Siva and Vishnu are the same and has lived according to that principle.\n\nThe following are the temples built by Pathukudi community at Panangattiry:\n\n\nLord Iravan is the tutelary deity of Pathukudi community.He is the son of legendary warrior Arjuna and the Naga princess Ulupi. He is also called as Koothandavar or Koothanda colloquially. Iravan is worshipped in Tamil Nadu as ‘Aravan ‘ as a village deity. (In Tamil ‘Aravan’ effigy a cobrahood shelters His head which shows his Naga affiliation.) The idol placed in the sanctum sanctorum is a younger form of Iravan who is holding bow and arrow. Lord Krishna‘s idol is also installed in the same Garbha Griha.\n\nThey also built temples for Siva, Serpent gods, Bhagavathy and Mariamman in Panangattiri. Among various lamp poles dedicated to Sri Pudussery temple at Palakkad by various communities, Pathukudi community’s one is the largest one, which is also considered as main and sacred nature.\n\nIn their earlier life of Pananagttiri, they followed same Brahmin traditions. Their Mangalya Sutra and marriages were same as that of Tamil Brahmins and was changed subsequently. The Mangalya thread must be a yellow thread (not chain) during marriage ceremony as it is considered sacred and auspicious which is applicable for both rich and poor.\n\nThe community follows patriarchal system.\n\nThey wore tuft in front of their head as like Nairs and Namboothiris.\n\nBeing a Trivarnika community, the after death pollution (pula) is only for ten days.\n\nThe unique Chitragupta festival /Indrotsavam is celebrating by the community as a part of continuation of their Poompuhar life.\n\nThey observe Pillayar Noimbu for lord Ganesh like Tamil Brahmins and all Vaishya communities.\n\n\n"}

According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics, the village had a population of 368 in the 2004 census. The population is predominantly Druze.\n\nIn Late Antiquity, the city was known as Zenopolis (), in the Roman province of Phoenice Paralia (or \"Phoenicia Prima\"). It became a city and a bishopric at the end of the 5th century.\n\nRakhlah is a possible location of the bishopric of \"Rachlea\" included in the Catholic Church's list of titular sees. In his account of this bishopric, which he calls that \"of the Rachlenes\" (Latin \"Rachlenorum\", Greek Ραχληνῶν), Le Quien says that, at a provincial synod held at Tyre in 518, Elias, spoken of in the acts as Bishop of the Rachlenes, signed as Ἠλίας ἐπίσκοπος Ζηνουπόλεως (Elias Bishop of Zenopolis); and that the acts of the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 bear the signature of \"Anastasius by the mercy of God Bishop of the Rachlenes in the province of the Tyrians\".\n\nThere are the ruins of two Assyrian-Romano-Phoenician temples in the village that are included in a group of Temples of Mount Hermon. The smaller, apsidal temple was cut out of bedrock. The other, larger temple may have been used as a church and is constructed of enormous blocks of limestone; it measures by . It features two rows of ionic columns that run along the walls from the entrance to a semi-circular altar. One of the walls of the temple is adorned with a relief of the face of a sun god, possibly Ba'al within a wreath that is aligned to look at Mount Hermon and measures in diameter. Two stones close to the gate show depictions of a bird with outstretched wings that was suggested to have been part of the temple's architrave. The carving was described as \"essentially Assyrian in character\" by Edward Robinson when visiting the site in 1852. He further suggested that the stone was brought to the site from a far distance. He considered the construction of the temples was likely to have taken place \"many centuries before the Christian era\". He noted several Greek inscriptions and took some copies.\nThe epigraphic information derived from the inscriptions at Rakleh has supported the existence of a local settlement and given details of the names and positions of the temple officials. One of the texts starts with the invocation \"to the Good Fortune\". It is also known from the inscriptions that the Greek goddess of the sea, Leucothea, was worshipped in the temple from 60 CE onwards. Two of the texts show that the officials exercised an unspecified authority. They detail the restoration of the temple using funds, implying they owned estates or assets earning interest. A building constructed in 253 CE was said to have been paid for \"at the expense of the goddess taken from the interest\". The treasurers of the temple also funded a new door in 379 CE.\n\nA few other rock cut tombs and caverns have been noted around the area.\n\n"}

{"id": "31580890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31580890", "title": "Shamanism among Alaska Natives", "text": "Shamanism among Alaska Natives\n\nAlaskan Natives have a special connection to the land around them, and a kinship with the animals with whom they share that land. Before the introduction of western culture and the religions that are now practiced in Alaska, there was a common spiritual connection made with the people to the land they occupied. The most common name for this connection is shamanism. Shamanism differs in every culture where it is practiced, in Alaska it is centered in the animals that are common in the area. Through the use of many myths, stories, and ceremonies these animals are personified and their spirits made tangible and in turn are deeply woven within the Native Alaskan people today. It was through the shaman that the spirit world was connected to the natural world. A shaman in Alaskan Native culture was a mediator, healer and the spirit worlds’ mouthpiece. Although shamanism is no longer popularly practiced, it was and continues, to be the heart of the Native Alaskan people.\nThe religion of the former Aleuts was an offshoot of the prevailing shamanistic beliefs common to the northern Eskimo and to the tribes of northeastern Asia. They believed in the existence of a creator of everything visible and invisible, but did not connect him with the guidance of the world, and paid him no special worship. As rulers of their entire environment, they acknowledged two spirits, or kinds of spirits,who determined the fate of man in every respect.\n\nThe earliest Aleuts worshiped light, the celestial bodies, and even the elements. They also believed that there were three worlds, to which they ascribed being and action. The first world, highest world, has no night or evening, and many people live there. The second, or middle world, is the earth. The third is subterranean and called lowest world.\n\nThe aboriginal Aleuts had no temples or idols, but there were holy or forbidden localities known as \"awabayabax\". Here they made offerings to invisible spirits. Such holy places were found in every village, being usually a mound, or some prominent place or a crag, which women and young men were strictly prohibited from visiting, and especially from gathering the grasses for their basketry, or taking away stones. If any young person, either from audacity or curiosity, violated this restriction, such infraction was sure to be followed by terrible \"wild\" disease, speedy death, or at least insanity. Old men could visit these spots at certain times, but only for the purpose of making offerings.\n\nAmong the past-tie Aleuts were both shamans and shamanism. They were considered to be the intermediaries between the visible and invisible worlds, between men and spirits, and the Aleuts believed they were acquainted with demonology and could foretell the future and aid sufferers. And though they were not professional obstetricians, yet as magicians their services were in request in cases of difficult childbirth. Shamans were the aboriginal specialists in dealing with the supernatural. They cured the sick, foretold the future, brought success in hunting and warfare, and performed other similar tasks.\n\nThe old Aleuts related that long before the advent of the Russians, the shamans predicted that White men with strange customs would come to them from beyond the edge of the sea, and that subsequently all Aleuts would become like the new arrivals and live according to their habits. They also saw, looking far into the future, a brilliant redness in the sky like a great new world, called \"arialiyaiyam akxa\", containing many people resembling the newcomers.\n\nAleuts believed that death stemmed from both natural and supernatural causes. The dead were treated in a range of ways, including mummification and cave burial of high-ranking men, women, and children, burial in special stone and wooden burial structures, and interment in small holes in the ground adjacent to habitations. Spirits of deceased individuals continued to \"live\", although details of any notion of an afterlife or of reincarnation are scanty.\n\nPrior to contact, Aleut ceremonies were likely held in the winter. Through singing, dancing, drumming, and wearing masks, the people entertained themselves and honored deceased relatives. Social rank was likely bolstered through bestowal of gifts. Today, Aleut ceremonies are those of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nThe shaman within this culture was the middle woman/man between spirits and the native peoples. Alaskan Athabaskan shamans guarded people against the effects of bad spirits. The shaman also diagnosed various illnesses and restored the health of those harmed by bad spirits. The shaman could also provide the valuable service of scapulimancy, which predicted the location of game when hunting was scarce.\n\nAn infamous bad spirit was the Giyeg. The belief was that people became sick because Giyeg thought about them. The shaman`s job was to distract Giyeg or else the person died. Another well-known bad spirit was the Nahani AKA the woodsmen. The woodsman was believed to be the spirit of people who got lost in the woods.\n\nThe human spirit was called the Yega and upon death, the Yega had to be properly guided to the afterlife. Athabaskans believed that human and animals were very similar in the past and their spirits communicated directly. If an animal was mistreated, then its respective spirit would wrack havoc on the lives of the offending Athabaskan. The lines of communication between spirits and Native Athabaskans were kept open using the shaman to translate. There are still spiritual beliefs about the connection between animals and humans prevalent in the Athabaskan culture. The raven is the most popular animal followed by the caribou, wolf and bear.\n\nCeremonies were designated to protect, heal or cleanse. The energy generated by the people and more importantly the shaman dictated the connection with the spirits and effectiveness of results. A popular after-death ceremony being a potlatch, allowed for the shaman to offer a smooth transition to the yega of the deceased. Food, water, song and dance are all examples of goods offered to the yega.\n\nBeing the revered medicine woman/man, the shaman could use their power for either good or evil. People both feared and admired the shamans because of their extraordinary abilities. The most evil of shamans wielded their control over people through use of puppets, sometimes using them to send out threatening messages.\n\nWhen Christianity`s influence started spreading, shamans lost credibility. Among the last attempts to keep shamanism alive is said to have been perpetuated by two Barrow shamans. The two said they had received a message from above which stated that a new developing shamanistic religion was better for them than the white man`s religion. This rumor gained them some fans for a time but eventually they lost out to Christianity. It is said that one shaman converted to Christianity while the other committed suicide.\n\nAs a few points of interest, in the Dena`ina peoples' eyes the \"white man\" couldn't be helped by the Shaman because he was believed to have the soul of a deceased Indian within. Shamans had to demonstrate their powers in order to have credibility. Tales include flying through the air, being shot then coughing up the offending bullet etc. Three great Shamans among Athabaskans are; Otsioza of Nulato, Noidola`an of the Koyukuk and Kedzaludia of the Kokrines-Tanana Mission group. Shamanism is one aspect of Athabaskan culture that is not being revived due to its controversial methods but there are those who still privately practice it.\n\nTo the Haida, the universe is composed of a multiplicity of interconnecting and overlapping layers. According to some, Haida once perceived the flat, circular Earth to be centred between a land above, supported by a pillar from the earth, and a watery underworld below. Certain interpretations of ḵ'aygang.nga, the Haida canon of ancestral oral histories that were recited across generations by professional story-tellers, show the origins of the modern Haida worldview, which remains convoluted and complex, involving interlaced layers of tangible and intangible reality.. Many Haida believe in a supernatural world in which everything embodies a spirit including animals, medicines, mountains, lakes, and caves. Haida make offerings of tobacco, birds’ feathers and food to honour powerful supernatural beings and communicate with ancestors and ancestral guardians. Haida people honour the beings in supernatural and tangible realities through dances, songs, offerings, and private and public prayer. Dancing and singing is a way to express, teach, and learn about the world and the natural, supernatural and ancestral beings that inhabit it. Dance is a link to the supernatural world through which Haida can access and experience supernatural possession. In the past, should someone become possessed by an evil spirit, a sg̱aaga, a Haida shaman, could be brought to draw spirits forth from the body. ,\n\nSome Haida people believe that they are protected by ancestral supernatural beings such as the bear, raven, and owl. They often depict these animals in their complex paintings, carvings, and tattoos, most recognizably in their carved totem poles which were made out of primarily Western Red Cedar trees. They pray, make offerings and strongly believe in their spirits' abilities to aid and protect them. In the past, the people relied on a sg̱aaga to help them contact and communicate with the supernatural world.\n\nIn Haida tradition the rites and secrets of the sg̱aaga's vocation were secret, and often required hereditary connections as well as complex and strenuous rites of passage to attain. The skills of the sg̱aaga were often obtained through an apprenticeship. The individual (most often a male, but in rare cases female) was \"called\" to being his tribes sg̱aaga or the title was passed on from an uncle. When the hopeful felt he had prepared enough, he entered into the woods for eight days with only an assistant, where he meditated and fasted. After those eight days, if it was truly the aspirant’s fate to become a sg̱aaga, he would fall into a trance (sometimes after falling into unconsciousness) and receive a message from the supernatural world. After regaining consciousness, the sg̱aaga and the assistant would seek out a land otter and cut out a piece of its tongue. It became an amulet, wrapped in a piece of his clothing and the source of his land otter power.\n\nAfter the hopeful had become a sg̱aaga, he continued his rigid discipline, by bathing in icy water, exercising and drinking Devil’s Club juice, a native species of ginseng, daily. Appearance was important to those who were sg̱aaga, they wore tunics that were soaked in seal oil, around their neck hung a necklace with animal claws and various carved amulets. The Haida believed that the sg̱aaga's hair was the source of his power, thus it was never touched and left to grow long and often uncombed. When the sg̱aaga performed ceremonies, his face was blackened with coal. If the ceremony required that he or she be naked, their long hair that sometimes hung to the ground covered their bodies. Tools that accompanied the sg̱aaga to complete his rituals were an oval rattle and hollowed out bone if disease needed to be blown away. Illness was believed to be caused by thoughts and behaviour that acted against nature, and was then called out by the sg̱aaga and then asked for the spirits to cleanse and heal the individual. The clairvoyant sg̱aaga could sense if the fierce Haida warriors could achieve victory over their enemies before the battle. Believing in reincarnation, if a member of the tribe should pass away, the sg̱aaga was able to predict which newborn child would inherit the deceased spirit. A reincarnated spirit is called x̱anjii. Working through the power of another spirit the sg̱aaga risked losing his own identity or being possessed by it, thus he changed his contacts and disciplines often.\n\nWith the introduction of smallpox, who Haida call Haayhiilaas, western religion, and ultimately residential schools, and much of Haida worldview was destroyed. Missionaries came along with the fur trade to Haida villages and taught or forced Haida people to speak, read and write English. Through the introduction of western culture Haida lost some of their own. Most notably was the loss of their language, now only about a dozen elders still speak Haida language. Before the missionaries Haida people kept remarkably accurate histories by memorizing the ḵ'aygang.nga word for word, reciting and passing them on through generations. Much of the ḵ'aygang.nga that survive or were recorded discuss events that could be over 14,000 years old, including events from the glacial era, like the separation of Haida Gwaii from the mainland. These events are frequently confirmed by archeological findings. But after the purposeful obliteration of Haida way of being, tradition, language, art forms, rights and title by missionaries and US, Canadian, state, provincial and colonial governments, much was lost. Today Christianity remains prevalent among Haida, and the Russian Orthodox missionaries came to the Southern Alaskan shore in the 18th century where small congregations are still active.\n\nShamanism has to do with the belief that the Shaman is a mediator for the spiritual world. Through various cultures the shaman’s role is different, in that of Tlingit culture the shaman is a healer and seer. The shaman performs various rituals, ceremonies, and helping with civil dispute situations. In most cases though to become a shaman it is inherited by a son or a grandson, due to the fact they’re already in possessions of the drums and tools needed. Not everyone can be a shaman, but if you have the ability to become a shaman you are almost always forced into it. Though Shamans are held with great respect, and esteem; they are feared because of their ability to speak with the spiritual world, and ability to use magic.\nThe shaman is referred to as ichta. The way that the shaman looks in the Tlingit culture, wild, dirty appearance, with hair loosely hanging in strands, he is never touched by scissors or comb. A shaman has in his possession all kinds of decorative objects used throughout various ceremonies and rituals. For each spirit the shaman has a special mask, which he uses when he appeals to that spirit. To conjure a spirit it may consist of a wild dance around the fire during which violent contortions of the body take place. The shaman can cure the sickness out of someone by driving out the evil spirits, bring good weather, and brings about large fish runs. For services such as these he collects a good amount of pay, and in fact he always gets it in advance.\n\nWhen a shaman passes, his burial is also different from that of all other Tlingit. The body of a shaman is not ever supposed to decompose because one of his first spirits stay with him, so it dries like a dried salmon.\n\nEvery Tlingit has his own guardian spirit called \"tu kinajek\" (tu = his, kina = top, jek = spirit) an evil or unclean person is deserted by his spirit. All spirits like cleanliness, the sound of the drum and rattle. A shaman who wishes to summon the spirits must practice alone for three to twelve months and the house in which the performance is to take place must be carefully cleaned as well as the songs and the dances.\n\nAnother duty of the shaman in Tlingit society is to exposes witches. Witches, both men and women, are called \"nakutsati\" and are supposed to have learned their skills from Raven while he lived on Earth. A witch is someone who harms another through magic, or are a source of illness. The shaman helps the person who is the victim of this witchcraft by thoroughly cleaning their house, and finding their belongings that the witch stole to perform this act.\n\nThe ability of a shaman depends on the amount of spirits under his control and if he is a good shaman he can prosper, but if he does not maintain proper rapport with these spirits they might kill him. Every shaman in the Tlingit culture has his own spirits for whom there are special names and songs. He rarely inherits the spirits of ancestors, but they do occasionally appear to him and then the shaman makes a practice of entertaining them. Another belief is that the shaman has the power to throw his spirits into anyone who does not believe in him; and these people faint, or gets cramps. A shaman can bring better weather, the shaman will go into the water; if his hair gets wet, and it will rain.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1811409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811409", "title": "Spiritual Baptist", "text": "Spiritual Baptist\n\nThe Spiritual Baptist faith is a syncretic Afro-American religion that combines elements of traditional African religion with Christianity. Despite the African influences, Spiritual Baptists consider themselves to be Christians.\n\nThe Baptist faith was brought to Trinidad by the Merikins, former American slaves who were recruited by the British to fight, as the Corps of Colonial Marines, against the Americans during the War of 1812. After the end of the war, these ex-slaves were settled in Trinidad, to the east of the Mission of Savannah Grande (now known as Princes Town) in six villages, since then called the Company Villages.\n\nThese American settlers brought with them the Baptist faith of the Second Great Awakening combined with, in the case of those from Georgia, the Gullah culture. With the coming of missionaries of the Baptist Missionary Society from Great Britain, the Baptist faith in the Company Villages was much affected, but despite the ensuing schism between the so-called London Baptists and the rest, the Baptist congregations of the Company Villages, even including those with Gullah origins, retained so little visible African influence in their practice that John Hackshaw was able to give a different view of the Baptists in the north of the country:\n\nThe faith expanded to Barbados in 1957 as the Sons of God Apostolic Spiritual Baptists movement. It now ranks as one of two indigenous religions in the country, the other being the Rastafari religion. Archbishop Granville Williams, who was born in Barbados, lived for 16 years in Trinidad and Tobago, where he witnessed the local Spiritual Baptists. Becoming enthusiastic about the Trinidadian movement, he asserted that he had seen a vision and heard the voice of God. Upon returning to Barbados he held the first open-air meeting in Oistins, Christ Church. Due to a well received response in Barbados, he quickly established the Jerusalem Apostolic Spiritual Baptist Church in Ealing Grove. This church was quickly followed by Zion at Richmond Gap. As of 1999 the following in Barbados had reached around 1,900 and the Jerusalem church had been rebuilt to seat 3,000.\n\nThe name \"Shouter\" derives from the practice of their religion. They are very vocal in singing, praying and preaching. \"Shouter\" is seen as a derogatory term and the term \"Spiritual\" is preferred due to the practice of their religion to \"invoke the holy spirit\" during their worship.\n\nThe activities of the Spiritual Baptists in Trinidad and Tobago were prohibited in 1917 by the Shouter Prohibition Ordinance, which was eventually repealed in 1951. The late opposition parliamentarian Ashford Sinanan moved to repeal the ordinance under the PNM government and was successful. Today Spiritual Baptists can practise their religion freely. The United National Congress granted them a national holiday and also gave them land on which to establish their headquarters.\n\nThe colours of the headdress or clothes vary and represent the 'spiritual cities' or the saints with which the individual most relates.\n\nMen can wear a headwrap however the very top of the head is usually left uncovered. Men tend to wear a gown or short cassocks. Persons of higher rank (deacons, deaconnesses, pastors, bishops) can wear a surplice over the gown.\n\n\nIn 1996 the Government of Trinidad and Tobago granted a public holiday to the Spiritual Baptist faith, to be celebrated on 30 March, called Spiritual Baptist/Shouter Liberation Day, in memory of the struggle and in recognition of the repeal of the prohibition law. Trinidad and Tobago is the only country that celebrates a public holiday for the Spiritual Baptist faith.\n\nMany Spiritual Baptist churches have overlapping memberships with practitioners of the Trinidad Orisha religion. In Trinidad, Orisha is also called Shango, and the term \"Shango Baptist\" is sometimes used to describe worshipers who are involved with both Spiritual Baptism and Orisha/Shango. The term \"Shango Baptist\" has come to have negative connotations for some worshippers of both Spiritual Baptism and Orisha/Shango, who argue that those who say \"Shango Baptist\" conflate the two religions, when in fact they are separate. As some have said, \"There is no thing as Shango Baptist. Shango is Shango. Baptist is Baptist\". Others say that Shango Baptists simply \"wear two hats\"; their mixture of \"Baptist and Orisha practices\" is a result of similar oppression by Colonial authorities in Trinidad.\n\nIn practice, the Trinidad Orisha religion is very closely connected with the Spiritual Baptists. Orisha worship services typically begin with a section of Baptist hymns, and in Trinidad and New York Orisha events are often held at the same locations as Spiritual Baptist churches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30864359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30864359", "title": "The Dresden Files", "text": "The Dresden Files\n\nThe Dresden Files is a series of contemporary fantasy/mystery novels written by American author Jim Butcher. The first novel, \"Storm Front\", was published in 2000 by Roc Books.\n\nThe books are written as a first-person narrative from the perspective of the main character, private investigator and wizard Harry Dresden, as he recounts investigations into supernatural disturbances in modern-day Chicago. Butcher's original proposed title for the first novel was \"Semiautomagic\", which sums up the series' balance of fantasy and hard-boiled detective fiction.\n\nAs of 2017, Butcher has written 15 novels set in the \"Dresden Files\" universe, plus a number of short stories (some of which are collected in the anthologies \"Side Jobs\" and \"Brief Cases\"). The series has also been released in audiobook format, narrated by James Marsters. Other works set in the same fictional universe include graphic novels (several new stories, plus adaptations of the first two novels), and \"The Dresden Files Roleplaying Game\". In 2007, a television series based on the novels aired for one season on the American Sci-Fi Channel.\n\nIn the world of \"The Dresden Files\", magic is real, along with vampires, demons, spirits, faeries, werewolves, outsiders, and other monsters. Although the supernatural is still widely discredited, it is practiced by some members of society. Additionally, large portions of the globe (such as much of Central and South America) are mentioned as being largely under the control of supernatural factions. The White Council is an organization of human wizards, noted to wield significant economic power in the world, along with their supernatural power. Each species in the series (humans, faeries, vampires, etc.) has its own political and societal rules and organizations. The human wizards depend on the White Council, while faeries may belong to either of two Faerie Courts, or none at all. Vampires may belong to any of four vampire courts.\n\nHarry Dresden works as the world's only \"consulting wizard\", accepting supernatural cases from both human and nonhuman clients, as well as the Chicago PD's Special Investigation unit. As the series progresses, Dresden takes on an increasingly important role in the supernatural world at large, as he works to protect the general public, making getting by as a working wizard and private investigator difficult for him. He finds himself facing off against an increasing variety of creatures (including other wizards), while facing the realization that his various cases may all be tied together behind the scenes and that his role might be even greater than he is willing to admit.\n\nJim Butcher decided to become a professional author at the age of 19. He wrote three novels within the fantasy genre, one of which he has classified as paranormal. He went on to describe all three books as being \"terrible\". In 1996, he enrolled in a writing class, where he was encouraged to write a novel similar to the \"\" series by Laurell K. Hamilton, rather than the more traditional high fantasy that had been his focus in the past, as Butcher had previously stated that he enjoyed the Anita Blake series. Despite initial resistance, he wrote the first book that semester, closely following the instructions of his teacher, author Deborah Chester.\n\nThe result was \"Semiautomagic\", later to be retitled as \"Storm Front\". His writing teacher declared it to be publishable, and Butcher started hunting around to do just that. Butcher failed to secure a publisher for two to three years. During this period, he completed the second novel, \"Fool Moon\", and had made significant progress on the third, \"Grave Peril\". Deciding to focus on agents and editors who had already published similar novels, Butcher targeted Ricia Mainhardt, the agent representing Laurell Hamilton, and submitted a copy of his manuscript. It was not accepted. Finally, Butcher met Hamilton at a convention, and was invited to lunch along with Mainhardt and a second agent, Jennifer Jackson. Mainhardt agreed to represent him, and six months later \"The Dresden Files\" was sold to ROC, an imprint of Penguin Books.\n\nThe first volume, \"Storm Front\", was released in 2000 in paperback; the next two novels in the series, \"Fool Moon\" and \"Grave Peril\", were released shortly thereafter, in January and September 2001, also in paperback. Subsequent novels in the series have been published annually since then, with the most recent novel, \"Skin Game\", published in May 2014. Omnibus editions have been released by the Science Fiction Book Club, with each of the four volumes reprinting two or three of the novels in the sequence.\n\nThe series' first six novels were originally only published as paperbacks, but in 2007, ROC changed its strategy and began to publish hardcover reprints of books one to six. Volume six, \"Blood Rites\", was released in July 2007. From book seven onward, each new book was directly published as hardcover and paperback both.\n\nOrbit Books purchased the series for UK publication, and released the first novel, \"Storm Front\" in September 2005—five years after the initial US release. They then proceeded to publish two books per month. In November 2007, Orbit Books announced that they had purchased the rights to \"Changes\", the 12th novel, as well as the 13th Dresden novel, \"Ghost Story\".\n\nAll 15 volumes of \"The Dresden Files\", along with the companion short-story anthology \"Side Jobs\", have been released as audiobooks. Originally, all except \"Ghost Story\" have been narrated by James Marsters. Per a release on Jim Butcher's website on June 27, 2011, he reported that, \"due to scheduling conflicts\", Marsters would be unable to voice \"Ghost Story\"; instead, the narration was performed by John Glover. James Marsters returned to read the \"Cold Days\" audio book. In April 2015, a rerecorded version of \"Ghost Story\" read by Marsters was released. The cover art for the series was created by Chris McGrath.\n\nOn April 4, 2015, the World Science Fiction Society announced that \"Skin Game\", the 15th installment in the series, was a finalist for the 2015 Hugo Award for Best Novel. \"Skin Game\" had been proposed as a nominee by both fantasy writer Brad Torgersen's \"Sad Puppies\" and science fiction and fantasy author Theodore Beale's \"Rabid Puppies\" slates; both \"Puppy\" slates engendered some controversy in the science-fiction and fantasy community, since slate voting had not previously been a publicized part of the Hugos. The book placed fifth in the final tally of the votes, behind \"No Award\".\n\nAll the books are published by ROC, an imprint of Penguin Books. The Science Fiction Book Club (SFBC) reissued the first nine books in hardcover omnibus editions.\n\nThe first four audiobook versions are produced by Buzzy Multimedia Publishing, while the fifth \"Death Masks\" and following were all produced by Penguin Audio. \"Proven Guilty\" and \"White Night\" were released in April 2009 alongside \"Turn Coat\". \"Death Masks\" was released November 2009, and \"Blood Rites\" and \"Dead Beat\" were released April 2010. The latest in the series is \"Skin Game\" which was released on May 27, 2014.\n\nButcher is currently planning for about twenty books in the \"case files\" of the series, to be capped by a further \"big apocalyptic trilogy\". \n\nDebuting on January 21, 2007, the Sci Fi Channel TV adaptation starred Paul Blackthorne as the eponymous wizard. Harry's history in the series differed from that of the novels in several significant ways; his father, Malcolm Dresden, did not die from an aneurysm, but was instead murdered by Justin (named Morningway rather than DuMorne, and Harry's biological uncle). Bob is the spirit of a medieval wizard who, in punishment for using black magic to resurrect his life's love, is doomed to spend eternity inside his skull; he can manifest a human appearance outside the skull–but only within a short radius of the skull itself–and must return to the skull when ordered. In \"What About Bob?\", it is revealed he was also Dresden's primary magical teacher as a child.\n\nHarry wears a magical \"shield-bracelet\" (and he also has the pentacle necklace, which makes an appearance in flashback scenes from \"Bad Blood\") that once belonged to his mother, and was given to him by his father. As a private investigator, Harry drives a Korean-War-era military Jeep instead of the infamous \"Blue Beetle\" VW Beetle of the novels (a change made based on actor Blackthorne's height and the difficulty of filming inside a VW Beetle, as well as the fact it would look more like a 'clown car' on video than a serious vehicle).\n\nAccording to \"Bad Blood\", Harry was around 31 when he killed Justin, instead of 16 as in the novels; a Red Court vampire, Bianca, protected Harry while the High Council investigated Morningway's death. The two had a sexual relationship that does not exist in the books.\n\nIn the episode \"What About Bob?\", the events surrounding Justin's death at Dresden's hands are fully revealed: Only five years prior to the series Dresden discovered that Justin, using black magic, was responsible for the death of his father. Justin said that he did not kill Harry's mother, but he died before the truth could be divined. Dresden used thaumaturgy—in this case, a voodoo doll of sorts—to attack Justin, who fought back using his own magical ability. In the scuffle, Harry accidentally crushed the voodoo doll, causing Justin to die with a \"circle-shaped crushing wound\" around his heart.\n\nThe series was canceled by the SciFi Channel in August 2007. Efforts by fans still exist to bring the show back or find it a new home.\n\nOn October 8th, 2018, Deadline.com announced that Fox 21 had optioned the Dresden Files for a new TV series.\n\nIn October 2007, Jim Butcher announced on his website that Dabel Brothers would be producing a \"Dresden Files\" graphic novel series:\n\n<poem>Working together with Dabel Brothers Productions, the \"Dresden Files\" are going to be translated into a graphic novel format. The current plan is to lay out the \"Dresden Files\" storyline at the rate of one of the novels every twelve to sixteen monthly issues, with occasional side-trips and independent stories thrown in. (Ever wonder what happened in Branson the month before \"Storm Front\"? How about what somebody saw in the lake in Minnesota between \"Storm Front\" and \"Fool Moon\"? Maybe I’ll get to tell those stories now! How cool is that?)\n\nI will be assisting with the writing of the comics, and am also involved in the design and approval of the characters, art, tone, and so on. This is an actual hand-in-hand project in which I have full creative input and influence, and I’m friggin’ giddy about it. I mean, come on! Comic books!</poem>\n\nThe four-issue mini-series called \"Welcome to the Jungle\", ran as a prequel to \"Storm Front\" from early to mid-2008. A compilation of that run was released as a hardcover graphic novel in October 2008. \"Storm Front\" was announced as the next adaptation, by the same creative team. The first issue was released in November 2008. \"Welcome to the Jungle\" was nominated for the first Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story.\n\nMidway through the production of \"Storm Front\", the title changed hands from Dabel Brothers to Dynamite Entertainment, causing a long gap between issues #5 and #6. Artist Ardian Syaf left the project to work for DC, and Brett Booth was brought in to finish the graphic novel. Issue #6 was slated for May 2010.\n\nJim Butcher has spoken openly about a pen and paper roleplaying game released in 2010 based on the Dresden Files universe. The game has been produced by Evil Hat Productions.\n\nIn January 2008, the project went into an early alpha phase of testing, and was in various beta testing phases throughout 2009. Pre-orders were opened up on April 4, 2010, and include immediate access to the pre-print PDF, dubbed the \"Early Bird\" version. Evil Hat released the game June 23–27, 2010, to coincide with Origins 2010. The RPG currently consists of three books, \"Volume One: Your Story\", the core rule book, \"Volume Two: Our World\", a text describing the game universe, and \"Volume Three: Paranet Papers\", expanding both the rules (including minor revisions) and the game universe (in particular, the DF version of Las Vegas). The game, which uses a modified version of the FATE system, emphasizes narrative structure over simulation of magical physics. It allows players to play a wide variety of characters, ranging from an ordinary human such as Karrin Murphy or Gentleman Johnny Marcone to magic users like Harry Dresden or Molly Carpenter to powerful supernatural creatures along the lines of Thomas Raith, all in the same game, with all the players able to make a contribution. On release it won awards at the Origins Awards, the Golden Geek Awards, and the ENnies.\n\nEvil Hat was working on a live-action version of the RPG, named Dresden Lives, but it was cancelled during beta testing.\n\nIn June 2017, Evil Hat Productions released a cooperative card game for 1-5 players called The Dresden Files Cooperative Card Game after a successful Kickstarter campaign, where they raised $549,486 from an initial goal of $48,000. From the publisher \"Play Harry Dresden and his friends as they take on the cases from the bestselling Dresden Files novels in the ultimate what-if scenario—what if Harry was on the scene with allies who weren’t there in the original story? The core game includes Harry, Murphy, Susan, Michael, and the Alphas and plays through the first five novels as well as Side Jobs, a random scenario generator based on the short story collection of the same name. Designs are already well underway for expansions featuring more series characters and more novels.\" The art for the game is not screen grabs from the TV show, but is instead original artwork by Fred Hicks, Chris McGrath, and Tyler Walpole. The game seems to be fairly well received, with a rating of 7.2 out of 10 on Board Game Geek's site. The rating system is based on user ratings, with a minimum number of votes required, and is subject to change, although drastic change is uncommon. There are currently three expansions for this game, and two more slated to come out later in 2018.\n\nIn the novel \"Fated\", the first Alex Verus book by Benedict Jacka, Verus comments, \"I've even heard of one guy in Chicago who advertises in the phone book under 'Wizard,' though that's probably an urban legend.\"\n\n"}
