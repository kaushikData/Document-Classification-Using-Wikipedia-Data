{"id": "27274079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27274079", "title": "Against the Galileans", "text": "Against the Galileans\n\nAgainst the Galileans (; ), meaning Christians, was a Greek polemical essay written by the Roman emperor Julian, commonly known as Julian the Apostate, during his short reign (361–363). Despite having been originally written in Greek, it is better known under its Latin name, probably due to its extensive reference in the polemical response \"Contra Julianum\" by Cyril of Alexandria.\n\nAs emperor, Julian had tried to stop the growing influence of Christianity in the Roman Empire, and had encouraged support for the original pagan imperial cults and ethnic religions of the Empire. In this essay Julian's described what he considered to be the mistakes and dangers of the Christian faith, and he attempted to throw an unflattering light on ongoing disputes inside the Christian Church. Julian portrayed Christians as apostates from Judaism, which the Emperor considered to be a very old and established religion that should be fully accepted. After Julian's death in battle in 363, the essay was anathematized, and even the text was lost. We only know of Julian's arguments second-hand, through texts written by Christian authors who sought to refute Julian.\n\nJulian was the last pagan emperor to rule the Roman Empire. As he was a nephew of the emperor Constantine, he had been brought up as a Christian, though he studied with Neoplatonists while growing up, and secretly abandoned Christianity in 351. After he became the Roman Emperor, he tried to end the persecution of pagans that had ongoing over the previous decades, legalizing cult sacrifice, restoring many pagan temples, and financing cults. Though he did not persecute Christians or forbid Christianity, he ended subsidies to the Christian church and ended the punishments that had been given to heretical Christians. He also composed treatises that attacked those whose ideas he disagreed with, including two on those he called “false Cynics” and Against the Galileaens, which was written during his stay in Antioch in the winter of 362–363.\n\nThe text of Against the Galileaens does not survive, probably being destroyed in an anti-pagan edict in 448 or 529. What we know of it comes from the writings of Cyril of Alexandria, who quoted it at length while writing a refutation that was finished either between 434–437 or 439–441. Cyril's refutation, however, does not survive fully intact. Only ten books still exist, all of which cover the first book out of three of Against the Galileaens, though multiple fragments of another ten books also survive. Cyril claimed that it was one of the most important anti-Christian works that had been written, and that it was widely considered to be irrefutable, while Libanius praised it as an even greater work than the critiques of Porphyry of Tyre. Though many Christian authors had written texts in which they scorned Julian, only Theodore of Mopsuestia had previously attempted a refutation of the work before Cyril.\n\nAside from the obvious divide of one being a Christian and one a pagan, Cyril's religious views were very different from Julian's. Whereas Julian had supported the Jewish community in the Roman Empire and sought to rebuild their temple, Cyril often wrote of how the Jewish community stood in the way of Christianity, and that Gentiles ought to reject all things Jewish, including the idea of rebuilding the Temple in Jerusalem, an idea which Julian had embraced. Perhaps it was this fundamental disagreement over the value of the Jewish faith that made Cyril's refutation so bitter, as it speaks of Julian as a satanically inspired man who desired to drag as many others as he could away from the Christian faith, and the Greek tradition that Julian came from as folly. Indeed, according to Cyril, any truth that was in the Greek texts was there as a result of the Greeks having heard of the wisdom of Moses — even Plato supposedly was a great admirer of the Jewish lawgiver. His refutation was thus an attempt to prove that Julian's view of the Platonic tradition as superior to the Mosaic religious tradition was, in fact, the reverse of the truth, as it was the Greeks whose words were a shadow of the truth of Moses.\n\nJulian first criticizes the practice of the Galileans of denying the existence of the gods, and their practice, taken from the Greeks, of being lazy and superstitious (43A–52C). Julian claims that men inherently know of the existence of God without being taught of it and that all men have an inherent belief that the gods reside in the heavens and observe what occurs in the world. Further, all men, from looking at the stable nature of the heavenly bodies, have come to believe that the gods are eternal and unchanging (43A–52C).\n\nJulian goes on to discuss the creation myths of the Greeks and the Jews, citing the account of the Book of Genesis. He ridicules the idea of literally interpreting the Jewish account, claiming that it is not only logically impossible (75B) – he asks how the serpent was able to speak a human language (86A) – but that is also blasphemous and insulting to God (89B). A true God, he says, would not have withheld the knowledge of good and evil from men or have been jealous of men eating from the tree of life and living forever. Indeed, this behavior shows God to be evil and the serpent, giving man the enormously valuable gift of differentiating good and evil, to be good. Therefore, it must have a deeper meaning (94A).\n\nJulian also brings up questions from the account of how God created the world. Where, he asks, did the abyss, the darkness, and the waters come from that are mentioned (49C)? Where did angels come from, since they are not mentioned in the creation account? To Julian, the account of Genesis is not about a creator God, but about an inferior god who merely shaped the matter that had already been created (49E). He compares this to Plato's account of the creation in Timaeus, in which inferior gods shape the matter created by the creator God (58C), and concludes that the Genesis account cannot adequately explain who created the matter that the God of Moses shaped (49E). Julian goes on to argue that there must be more than one god who shaped matter (66A), as if there was only one God, all created beings would be identical. The fact that there is such a difference between immortal beings, humans, and animals, proves that different gods shaped different beings (65D). The God of Moses, being a god who chose the Jews as his people and gave them alone the gift of prophecy and his teachings, is merely the god of the Jewish people, not the god of any other race of men (106D). Julian finds it absurd to believe that the God who created everything in the world, who describes himself as being a jealous God (106D–E), was content to confine himself to caring for a small tribe in Palestine while letting all races besides the Jews worship false gods for thousands of years (106D).\n\nJulian then discusses how the Greeks view the gods as being the delegates of the creator God, each responsible for caring for different nations, cities, and races of men (115D), which explains why the character and customs of men are so different (131C). He mocks the idea that a literal interpretation of the story of the Tower of Babel can adequately explain why men differ so greatly, saying that it does not explain why men have different morals or laws or why they have such marked physical differences (138A). Instead, he believes, different gods responsible for different races and nations are responsible for mankind’s differences (143A). The God of Moses does exist, but only as an inferior to the God of All (148B). Julian expounds on this idea, asking why, if the Jewish God is the only god, the Jews have not accomplished as much as other races, such as the Greeks, Phoenicians or Egyptians (178A), and why the Jews have been subjugated by so many other races (213A).\n\nJulian spends time discussing how, even after having nominally embraced Jewish traditions, Galileans have really rejected them and only accepted their blasphemy of the gods (238A–B). He criticizes the belief that Jesus is the prophet that was predicted by Moses and Isaiah, as Jesus, supposedly being the son of God, was not descended from Judah, and says that the idea of a god who claims to be the sole God creating a being equal to him (and thus a second God) goes against the monotheistic beliefs of Judaism (253A–B). He points out that Galileans have abandoned many of the central tenets of Judaism, such as the sacrificing of animals (305D) and its dietary restrictions (314C), and criticizes the claim that God has set up a new law for them while Moses so adamantly warned against changing the law (320B).\n\nAlong with abandoning Jewish teachings, Julian also charges the Galileans with abandoning those of the original apostles (327A). He claims that no apostle claimed that Jesus was God until John, and he probably only did so to clarify an important dispute within a disunited church (327A). Galileans also disobey the words of Jesus, as they revere tombs and the dead, while Jesus referred to gravesites as places of impurity (335B). Julian then brings up other Jewish practices abandoned by Galileans such as circumcision and the celebration of Passover, wondering why they have abandoned such practices when they were assigned such importance in the Jewish law (351A), going so far as to claim that the religious practices of Moses and Abraham are far closer to the religious practices of the Greeks than those of the Galileans (356C).\n\nEnglish translations available on the web:\n"}

{"id": "1174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1174", "title": "Aphrodite", "text": "Aphrodite\n\nAphrodite is an ancient Greek goddess associated with love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation. She is identified with the planet Venus, which is named after the Roman goddess , with whom Aphrodite was extensively syncretized. Aphrodite's major symbols include myrtles, roses, doves, sparrows, and swans.\n\nThe cult of Aphrodite was largely derived from that of the Phoenician goddess Astarte, a cognate of the East Semitic goddess Ishtar, whose cult was based on the Sumerian cult of Inanna. Aphrodite's main cult centers were Cythera, Cyprus, Corinth, and Athens. Her main festival was the Aphrodisia, which was celebrated annually in midsummer. In Laconia, Aphrodite was worshipped as a warrior goddess. She was also the patron goddess of prostitutes, an association which led early scholars to propose the concept of \"sacred prostitution\", an idea which is now generally seen as erroneous.\n\nIn Hesiod's \"Theogony\", Aphrodite is born off the coast of Cythera from the foam (\"aphros\") produced by Uranus's genitals, which his son Cronus has severed and thrown into the sea. In Homer's \"Iliad\", however, she is the daughter of Zeus and Dione. Plato, in his \"Symposium\" 180e, asserts that these two origins actually belong to separate entities: Aphrodite Ourania (a transcendent, \"Heavenly\" Aphrodite) and Aphrodite Pandemos (Aphrodite common to \"all the people\"). Aphrodite had many other epithets, each emphasizing a different aspect of the same goddess, or used by a different local cult. Thus she was also known as Cytherea (\"Lady of Cythera\") and Cypris (\"Lady of Cyprus\"), due to the fact that both locations claimed to be the place of her birth.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Aphrodite was married to Hephaestus, the god of blacksmiths and metalworking. Despite this, Aphrodite was frequently unfaithful to him and had many lovers; in the \"Odyssey\", she is caught in the act of adultery with Ares, the god of war. In the \"First Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite\", she seduces the mortal shepherd Anchises. Aphrodite was also the surrogate mother and lover of the mortal shepherd Adonis, who was killed by a wild boar. Along with Athena and Hera, Aphrodite was one of the three goddesses whose feud resulted in the beginning of the Trojan War and she plays a major role throughout the \"Iliad\". Aphrodite has been featured in western art as a symbol of female beauty and has appeared in numerous works of western literature. She is a major deity in modern Neopagan religions, including the Church of Aphrodite, Wicca, and Hellenismos.\n\nHesiod derives \"Aphrodite\" from \"aphrós\" (ἀφρός) \"sea-foam\", interpreting the name as \"risen from the foam\", but most modern scholars regard this as a spurious folk etymology. Early modern scholars of classical mythology attempted to argue that Aphrodite's name was of Greek or Indo-European origin, but these efforts have now been mostly abandoned. Aphrodite's name is generally accepted to be of non-Greek, probably Semitic, origin, but its exact derivation cannot be determined.\n\nScholars in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, accepting Hesiod's \"foam\" etymology as genuine, analyzed the second part of Aphrodite's name as *\"-odítē\" \"wanderer\" or *\"-dítē\" \"bright\". Michael Janda, also accepting Hesiod's etymology, has argued in favor of the latter of these interpretations and claims the story of a birth from the foam as an Indo-European mytheme. Likewise, Witczak proposes an Indo-European compound ' \"very\" and ' \"to shine\", also referring to Eos. Other scholars have argued that these hypotheses are unlikely since Aphrodite's attributes are entirely different from those of both Eos and the Vedic deity Ushas.\n\nA number of improbable non-Greek etymologies have also been suggested. One Semitic etymology compares Aphrodite to the Assyrian \"barīrītu\", the name of a female demon that appears in Middle Babylonian and Late Babylonian texts. Hammarström looks to Etruscan, comparing \"(e)prϑni\" \"lord\", an Etruscan honorific loaned into Greek as πρύτανις. This would make the theonym in origin an honorific, \"the lady\". Most scholars reject this etymology as implausible, especially since Aphrodite actually appears in Etruscan in the borrowed form \"Apru\" (from Greek \"Aphrō\", clipped form of \"Aphrodite\"). The medieval \"Etymologicum Magnum\" (c. 1150) offers a highly contrived etymology, deriving \"Aphrodite\" from the compound \"habrodíaitos\" (), \"she who lives delicately\", from \"habrós\" and \"díaita\". The alteration from \"b\" to \"ph\" is explained as a \"familiar\" characteristic of Greek \"obvious from the Macedonians\".\n\nThe cult of Aphrodite in Greece was imported from, or at least influenced by, the cult of Astarte in Phoenicia, which, in turn, was influenced by the cult of the Mesopotamian goddess known as \"Ishtar\" to the East Semitic peoples and as \"Inanna\" to the Sumerians. Pausanias states that the first to establish a cult of Aphrodite were the Assyrians, after the Assyrians, the Paphians of Cyprus, and then the Phoenicians at Ascalon. The Phoenicians, in turn, taught her worship to the people of Cythera.\n\nAphrodite took on Inanna-Ishtar's associations with sexuality and procreation. Furthermore, she was known as Ourania (Οὐρανία), which means \"heavenly\", a title corresponding to Inanna's role as the Queen of Heaven. Early artistic and literary portrayals of Aphrodite are extremely similar on Inanna-Ishtar. Like Inanna-Ishtar, Aphrodite was also a warrior goddess; the second-century AD Greek geographer Pausanias records that, in Sparta, Aphrodite was worshipped as \"Aphrodite Areia\", which means \"warlike\". He also mentions that Aphrodite's most ancient cult statues in Sparta and on Cythera showed her bearing arms. Modern scholars note that Aphrodite's warrior-goddess aspects appear in the oldest strata of her worship and see it as an indication of her Near Eastern origins.\n\nNineteenth century classical scholars had a general aversion to the idea that ancient Greek religion was at all influenced by the cultures of the Near East, but, even Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker, who argued that Near Eastern influence on Greek culture was largely confined to material culture, admitted that Aphrodite was clearly of Phoenician origin. The significant influence of Near Eastern culture on early Greek religion in general, and on the cult of Aphrodite in particular, is now widely recognized as dating to a period of orientalization during the eighth century BC, when archaic Greece was on the fringes of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.\n\nSome early comparative mythologists opposed to the idea of a Near Eastern origin argued that Aphrodite originated as an aspect of the Greek dawn goddess Eos and that she was therefore ultimately derived from the Proto-Indo-European dawn goddess *\"Héusōs\" (properly Greek Eos, Latin Aurora, Sanskrit Ushas). Most modern scholars have now rejected the notion of a purely Indo-European Aphrodite, but it is possible that Aphrodite, originally a Semitic deity, may have been influenced by the Indo-European dawn goddess. Both Aphrodite and Eos were known for their erotic beauty and aggressive sexuality and both had relationships with mortal lovers. Both goddesses were associated with the colors red, white, and gold. Michael Janda etymologizes Aphrodite's name as an epithet of Eos meaning \"she who rises from the foam [of the ocean]\" and points to Hesiod's \"Theogony\" account of Aphrodite's birth as an archaic reflex of Indo-European myth. Aphrodite rising out of the waters after Cronus defeats Uranus as a mytheme would then be directly cognate to the Rigvedic myth of Indra defeating Vrtra, liberating Ushas. Another key similarity between Aphrodite and the Indo-European dawn goddess is her close kinship to the Greek sky deity, since both of the main claimants to her paternity (Zeus and Uranus) are sky deities.\n\nAphrodite's most common cultic epithet was \"Ourania\", meaning \"heavenly\", but this epithet almost never occurs in literary texts, indicating a purely cultic significance. Another common name for Aphrodite was \"Pandemos\" (\"For All the Folk\"). In her role as Aphrodite Pandemos, Aphrodite was associated with \"Peithō\" (), meaning \"persuasion\", and could be prayed to for aid in seduction. Plato, in his \"Symposium\", argues that Ourania and Pandemos are, in fact, separate goddesses. He asserts that \"Aphrodite Ourania\" is the celestial Aphrodite, born from the sea foam after Cronus castrated Uranus, and the older of the two goddesses. According to the \"Symposium\", Aphrodite Ourania is the inspiration of male homosexual desire, specifically the ephebic eros. \"Aphrodite Pandemos\", by contrast, is the younger of the two goddesses: the common Aphrodite, born from the union of Zeus and Dione, and the inspiration of heterosexual desire, the \"lesser\" of the two loves.\n\nAmong the Neoplatonists and, later, their Christian interpreters, Ourania is associated with spiritual love, and Pandemos with physical love (desire). A representation of Ourania with her foot resting on a tortoise came to be seen as emblematic of discretion in conjugal love; it was the subject of a chryselephantine sculpture by Phidias for Elis, known only from a parenthetical comment by the geographer Pausanias.\n\nOne of Aphrodite's most common literary epithets is \"Philommeidḗs\" (), which means \"smile-loving\", but is sometimes mistranslated as \"laughter-loving\". This epithet occurs throughout both of the Homeric epics and the \"First Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite\". Hesiod references it once in his \"Theogony\" in the context of Aphrodite's birth, but interprets it as \"genital-loving\" rather than \"smile-loving\". Monica Cyrino notes that the epithet may relate to the fact that, in many artistic depictions of Aphrodite, she is shown smiling. Other common literary epithets are \"Cypris\" and \"Cythereia\", which derive from her associations with the islands of Cyprus and Cythera respectively.\n\nOn Cyprus, Aphrodite was sometimes called \"Eleemon\" (\"the merciful\"). In Athens, she was known as \"Aphrodite en kopois\" (\"Aphrodite of the Gardens\"). At Cape Colias, a town along the Attic coast, she was venerated as \"Genetyllis\" \"Mother\". The Spartans worshipped her as \"Potnia\" \"Mistress\", \"Enoplios\" \"Armed\", \"Morpho\" \"Shapely\", \"Ambologera\" \"She who Postpones Old Age\". Across the Greek world, she was known under epithets such as \"Melainis\" \"Black One\", \"Skotia\" \"Dark One\", \"Androphonos\" \"Killer of Men\", \"Anosia\" \"Unholy\", and \"Tymborychos\" \"Gravedigger\", all of which indicate her darker, more violent nature.\n\nA male version of Aphrodite known as Aphroditus was worshipped in the city of Amathus on Cyprus. Aphroditus was depicted with the figure and dress of a woman, but had a beard, and was shown lifting his dress to reveal an erect phallus. This gesture was believed to be an apotropaic symbol, and was thought to convey good fortune upon the viewer. Eventually, the popularity of Aphroditus waned as the mainstream, fully feminine version of Aphrodite became more popular, but traces of his cult are preserved in the later legends of Hermaphroditus.\n\nAphrodite's main festival, the Aphrodisia, was celebrated across Greece, but particularly in Athens and Corinth. In Athens, the Aphrodisia was celebrated on the fourth day of the month of Hekatombaion in honor of Aphrodite's role in the unification of Attica. During this festival, the priests of Aphrodite would purify the temple of Aphrodite Pandemos on the southwestern slope of the Acropolis with the blood of a sacrificed dove. Next, the altars would be anointed and the cult statues of Aphrodite Pandemos and Peitho would be escorted in a majestic procession to a place where they would be ritually bathed. Aphrodite was also honored in Athens as part of the Arrhephoria festival. The fourth day of every month was sacred to Aphrodite.\n\nPausanias records that, in Sparta, Aphrodite was worshipped as \"Aphrodite Areia\", which means \"warlike\". This epithet stresses Aphrodite's connections to Ares, with whom she had extramarital relations. Pausanias also records that, in Sparta and on Cythera, a number of extremely ancient cult statues of Aphrodite portrayed her bearing arms. Other cult statues showed her bound in chains.\n\nAphrodite was the patron goddess of prostitutes of all varieties, ranging from \"pornai\" (cheap street prostitutes typically owned as slaves by wealthy pimps) to \"hetairai\" (expensive, well-educated hired companions, who were usually self-employed and sometimes provided sex to their customers). The city of Corinth was renowned throughout the ancient world for its many \"hetairai\", who had a widespread reputation for being among the most skilled, but also the most expensive, prostitutes in the Greek world. Corinth also had a major temple to Aphrodite located on the Acrocorinth and was one of the main centers of her cult. Records of numerous dedications to Aphrodite made by successful courtesans have survived in poems and in pottery inscriptions. References to Aphrodite in association with prostitution are found in Corinth as well as on the islands of Cyprus, Cythera, and Sicily. Aphrodite's Mesopotamian precursor Inanna-Ishtar was also closely associated with prostitution.\n\nScholars in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries believed that the cult of Aphrodite may have involved ritual prostitution, an assumption based on ambiguous passages in certain ancient texts, particularly a fragment of a \"skolion\" by the Boeotian poet Pindar, which mentions prostitutes in Corinth in association with Aphrodite. Modern scholars now dismiss the notion of ritual prostitution in Greece as a \"historiographic myth\" with no factual basis.\n\nDuring the Hellenistic period, the Greeks identified Aphrodite with the ancient Egyptian goddesses Hathor and Isis. Aphrodite was the patron goddess of the Lagid queens and Queen Arsinoe II was identified as her mortal incarnation. Aphrodite was worshipped in Alexandria and had numerous temples in and around the city. Arsinoe II introduced the cult of Adonis to Alexandria and many of the women there partook in it. The Tessarakonteres, a gigantic catamaran galley designed by Archimedes for Ptolemy IV Philopator, had a circular temple to Aphrodite on it with a marble statue of the goddess herself. In the second century BC, Ptolemy VIII Physcon and his wives Cleopatra II and Cleopatra III dedicated a temple to Aphrodite Hathor at Philae. Statuettes of Aphrodite for personal devotion became common in Egypt starting in the early Ptolemaic times and extending until long after Egypt became a Roman province.\n\nThe ancient Romans identified Aphrodite with their goddess Venus, who was originally a goddess of agricultural fertility, vegetation, and springtime. According to the Roman historian Livy, Aphrodite and Venus were officially identified in the third century BC when the cult of \"Venus Erycina\" was introduced to Rome from the Greek sanctuary of Aphrodite on Mount Eryx in Sicily. After this point, Romans adopted Aphrodite's iconography and myths and applied them to Venus. Because Aphrodite was the mother of the Trojan hero Aeneas in Greek mythology and Roman tradition claimed Aeneas as the founder of Rome, Venus became venerated as \"Venus Genetrix\", the mother of the entire Roman nation. Julius Caesar claimed to be directly descended from Aeneas's son Iulus and became a strong proponent of the cult of Venus. This precedent was later followed by his nephew Augustus and the later emperors claiming succession from him.\n\nThis syncretism greatly impacted Greek worship of Aphrodite. During the Roman era, the cults of Aphrodite in many Greek cities began to emphasize her relationship with Troy and Aeneas. They also began to adopt distinctively Roman elements, portraying Aphrodite as more maternal, more militaristic, and more concerned with administrative bureaucracy. She was claimed as a divine guardian by many political magistrates. Appearances of Aphrodite in Greek literature also vastly proliferated, usually showing Aphrodite in a characteristically Roman manner.\n\nAphrodite is usually said to have been born near her chief center of worship, Paphos, on the island of Cyprus, which is why she is sometimes called \"Cyprian\", especially in the poetic works of Sappho. However, other versions of her myth have her born near the island of Cythera, hence another of her names, \"Cytherea\". Cythera was a stopping place for trade and culture between Crete and the Peloponesus, so these stories may preserve traces of the migration of Aphrodite's cult from the Middle East to mainland Greece.\n\nAccording to the version of her birth recounted by Hesiod in his \"Theogony\", Cronus severed Uranus' genitals and threw them behind him into the sea. The foam from his genitals gave rise to Aphrodite (hence her name, which Hesiod interprets as \"foam-arisen\"), while the Giants, the Erinyes (furies), and the Meliae emerged from the drops of his blood. Hesiod states that the genitals \"were carried over the sea a long time, and white foam arose from the immortal flesh; with it a girl grew.\" Hesiod's account of Aphrodite's birth following Uranus's castration is probably derived from \"The Song of Kumarbi\", an ancient Hittite epic poem in which the god Kumarbi overthrows his father Anu, the god of the sky, and bites off his genitals, causing him to become pregnant and give birth to Anu's children, which include Ishtar and her brother Teshub, the Hittite storm god.\n\nIn the \"Iliad\", Aphrodite is described as the daughter of Zeus and Dione. Dione's name appears to be a feminine cognate to \"Dios\" and \"Dion\", which are oblique forms of the name \"Zeus\". Zeus and Dione shared a cult at Dodona in northwestern Greece. In \"Theogony\", Hesiod describes Dione as an Oceanid.\n\nAphrodite is consistently portrayed as a nubile, infinitely desirable adult, having had no childhood. She is often depicted nude. In the \"Iliad\", Aphrodite is the apparently unmarried consort of Ares, the god of war, and the wife of Hephaestus is a different goddess named Charis. Likewise, in Hesiod's \"Theogony\", Aphrodite is unmarried and the wife of Hephaestus is Aglaea, the youngest of the three Charites.\n\nIn Book Eight of the \"Odyssey\", however, the blind singer Demodocus describes Aphrodite as the wife of Hephaestus and tells how she committed adultery with Ares during the Trojan War. The sun-god Helios saw Aphrodite and Ares having sex in Hephaestus's bed and warned Hephaestus, who fashioned a net of gold. The next time Ares and Aphrodite had sex together, the net trapped them both. Hephaestus brought all the gods into the bedchamber to laugh at the captured adulterers, but Apollo, Hermes, and Poseidon had sympathy for Ares and Poseidon agreed to pay Hephaestus for Ares's release. Humiliated, Aphrodite returned to Cyprus, where she was attended by the Charites. This narrative probably originated as a Greek folk tale, originally independent of the \"Odyssey\".\n\nLater stories were invented to explain Aphrodite's marriage to Hephaestus. In the most famous story, Zeus hastily married Aphrodite to Hephaestus in order to prevent the other gods from fighting over her. In another version of the myth, Hephaestus gave his mother Hera a golden throne, but when she sat on it, she became trapped and he refused to let her go until she agreed to give him Aphrodite's hand in marriage. Hephaestus was overjoyed to be married to the goddess of beauty, and forged her beautiful jewelry, including a \"strophion\" known as the \"kestos imas\", a saltire-shaped undergarment (usually translated as \"girdle\"), which accentuated her breasts and made her even more irresistible to men. Such \"strophia\" were commonly used in depictions of the Near Eastern goddesses Ishtar and Atargatis.\n\nAphrodite is almost always accompanied by Eros, the god of lust and sexual desire. In his \"Theogony\", Hesiod describes Eros as one of the four original primeval forces born at the beginning of time, but, after the birth of Aphrodite from the sea foam, he is joined by Himeros and, together, they become Aphrodite's constant companions. In early Greek art, Eros and Himeros are both shown as idealized handsome youths with wings. The Greek lyric poets regarded the power of Eros and Himeros as dangerous, compulsive, and impossible for anyone to resist. In modern times, Eros is often seen as Aphrodite's son, but this is actually a comparatively late innovation. A \"scholion\" on Theocritus's \"Idylls\" remarks that the sixth-century BC poetess Sappho had described Eros as the son of Aphrodite and Uranus, but the first surviving reference to Eros as Aphrodite's son comes from Apollonius of Rhodes's \"Argonautica\", written in the third century BC, which makes him the son of Aphrodite and Ares. Later, the Romans, who saw Venus as a mother goddess, seized on this idea of Eros as Aphrodite's son and popularized it, making it the predominant portrayal in works on mythology until the present day.\n\nAphrodite's main attendants were the three Charites, whom Hesiod identifies as the daughters of Zeus and Eurynome and names as Aglaea \"Splendor\", Euphrosyne \"Good Cheer\", and Thalia \"Abundance\". The Charites had been worshipped as goddesses in Greece since the beginning of Greek history, long before Aphrodite was introduced to the pantheon. Aphrodite's other set of attendants was the three Horae (the \"Hours\"), whom Hesiod identifies as the daughters of Zeus and Themis and names as Eunomia (Good Order), Dike (Justice), and Eirene (Peace). Aphrodite was also sometimes accompanied by Harmonia, her daughter by Ares, and Hebe, the daughter of Zeus and Hera.\n\nThe fertility god Priapus was usually considered to be Aphrodite's son by Dionysus, but he was sometimes also described as her son by Hermes, Adonis, or even Zeus. A \"scholion\" on Apollonius of Rhodes's \"Argonautica\" states that, while Aphrodite was pregnant with Priapus, Hera envied her and applied an evil potion to her belly while she was sleeping to ensure that the child would be hideous. When Aphrodite gave birth, she was horrified to see that the child had a massive, permanently erect penis, a potbelly, and a huge tongue. Aphrodite abandoned the infant to die in the wilderness, but a herdsman found him and raised him, later discovering that Priapus could use his massive penis to aid in the growth of plants.\n\nThe \"First Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite\" (Hymn 5), which was probably composed sometime in the mid-seventh century BC, describes how Zeus once became annoyed with Aphrodite for causing deities to fall in love with mortals, so he caused her to fall in love with Anchises, a handsome mortal shepherd who lived in the foothills beneath Mount Ida near the city of Troy. Aphrodite appears to Anchises in the form of a tall, beautiful, mortal virgin while he is alone in his home. Anchises sees her dressed in bright clothing and gleaming jewelry, with her breasts shining with divine radiance. He asks her if she is Aphrodite and promises to build her an altar on top of the mountain if she will bless him and his family.\n\nAphrodite lies and tells him that she is not a goddess, but the daughter of one of the noble families of Phrygia. She claims to be able to understand the Trojan language because she had a Trojan nurse as a child and says that she found herself on the mountainside after she was snatched up by Hermes while dancing in a celebration in honor of Artemis, the goddess of virginity. Aphrodite tells Anchises that she is still a virgin and begs him to take her to his parents. Anchises immediately becomes overcome with mad lust for Aphrodite and swears that he will have sex with her. Anchises takes Aphrodite, with her eyes cast downwards, to his bed, which is covered in the furs of lions and bears. He then strips her naked and makes love to her.\n\nAfter the lovemaking is complete, Aphrodite reveals her true divine form. Anchises is terrified, but Aphrodite consoles him and promises that she will bear him a son. She prophecizes that their son will be the demigod Aeneas, who will be raised by the nymphs of the wilderness for five years before going to Troy to become a nobleman like his father. The story of Aeneas's conception is also mentioned in Hesiod's \"Theogony\" and in Book II of Homer's \"Iliad\".\n\nThe myth of Aphrodite and Adonis is probably derived from the ancient Sumerian legend of Inanna and Dumuzid. The Greek name (\"Adōnis\", ) is derived from the Canaanite word \"ʼadōn\", meaning \"lord\". The earliest known Greek reference to Adonis comes from a fragment of a poem by the Lesbian poetess Sappho, dating to the seventh century BC, in which a chorus of young girls asks Aphrodite what they can do to mourn Adonis's death. Aphrodite replies that they must beat their breasts and tear their tunics. Later references flesh out the story with more details: Adonis was the son of Myrrha, who was cursed by Aphrodite with insatiable lust for her own father, King Cinyras of Cyprus, after Myrrha's mother bragged that her daughter was more beautiful than the goddess. Driven out after becoming pregnant, Myrrha was changed into a myrrh tree, but still gave birth to Adonis.\n\nAphrodite found the baby, and took him to the underworld to be fostered by Persephone. She returned for him once he was grown and discovered him to be strikingly handsome. Persephone wanted to keep Adonis, resulting in a custody battle between the two goddesses over whom should rightly possess Adonis. Zeus settled the dispute by decreeing that Adonis would spend one third of the year with Aphrodite, one third with Persephone, and one third with whomever he chose. Adonis chose to spend that time with Aphrodite. Then, one day, while Adonis was hunting, he was wounded by a wild boar and bled to death in Aphrodite's arms.\n\nIn different versions of the story, the boar was either sent by Ares, who was jealous that Aphrodite was spending so much time with Adonis, or by Artemis, who wanted revenge against Aphrodite for having killed her devoted follower Hippolytus. The story also provides an etiology for Aphrodite's associations with certain flowers. Reportedly, as she mourned Adonis's death, she caused anemones to grow wherever his blood fell, and declared a festival on the anniversary of his death. In one version of the story, Aphrodite injured herself on a thorn from a rose bush and the rose, which had previously been white, was stained red by her blood. According to Lucian's \"On the Syrian Goddess\", each year during the festival of Adonis, the Adonis River in Lebanon (now known as the Abraham River) ran red with blood.\n\nThe myth of Adonis is associated with the festival of the Adonia, which was celebrated by Greek women every year in midsummer. The festival, which was evidently already celebrated in Lesbos by Sappho's time, seems to have first become popular in Athens in the mid-fifth century BC. At the start of the festival, the women would plant a \"garden of Adonis\", a small garden planted inside a small basket or a shallow piece of broken pottery containing a variety of quick-growing plants, such as lettuce and fennel, or even quick-sprouting grains such as wheat and barley. The women would then climb ladders to the roofs of their houses, where they would place the gardens out under the heat of the summer sun. The plants would sprout in the sunlight, but wither quickly in the heat. Then the women would mourn and lament loudly over the death of Adonis, tearing their clothes and beating their breasts in a public display of grief.\n\nIn Hesiod's \"Works and Days\", Zeus orders Aphrodite to make Pandora, the first woman, physically beautiful and sexually attractive, so that she may become \"an evil men will love to embrace\". Aphrodite \"spills grace\" over Pandora's head and equips her with \"painful desire and knee-weakening anguish\", thus making her the perfect vessel for evil to enter the world. Aphrodite's attendants, Peitho, the Charites, and the Horae, adorn Pandora with gold and jewelry.\n\nAccording to one myth, Aphrodite aided Hippomenes, a noble youth who wished to marry Atalanta, a maiden who was renowned throughout the land for her beauty, but who refused to marry any man unless he could outrun her in a footrace. Atalanta was an exceedingly swift runner and she beheaded all of the men who lost to her. Aphrodite gave Hippomenes three golden apples from the Garden of the Hesperides and instructed him to toss them in front of Atalanta as he raced her. Hippomenes obeyed Aphrodite's order and Atalanta, seeing the beautiful, golden fruits, bent down to pick up each one, allowing Hippomenes to outrun her. In the version of the story from Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", Hippomenes forgets to repay Aphrodite for her aid, so she causes the couple to become inflamed with lust while they are staying at the temple of Cybele. The couple desecrate the temple by having sex in it, leading Cybele to turn them into lions as punishment.\n\nThe myth of Pygmalion is first mentioned by the third-century BC Greek writer Philostephanus of Cyrene, but is first recounted in detail in Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\". According to Ovid, Pygmalion was an exceedingly handsome sculptor from the island of Cyprus, who was so sickened by the immorality of women that he refused to marry. He fell madly and passionately in love with the ivory cult statue he was carving of Aphrodite and longed to marry it. Because Pygmalion was extremely pious and devoted to Aphrodite, the goddess brought the statue to life. Pygmalion married the girl the statue became and they had a son named Paphos, after whom the capital of Cyprus received its name. Pseudo-Apollodorus later mentions \"Metharme, daughter of Pygmalion, king of Cyprus\".\n\nAphrodite generously rewarded those who honored her, but also punished those who disrespected her, often quite brutally. A myth described in Apollonius of Rhodes's \"Argonautica\" and later summarized in the \"Bibliotheca\" of Pseudo-Apollodorus tells how, when the women of the island of Lemnos refused to sacrifice to Aphrodite, the goddess cursed them to stink horribly so that their husbands would never have sex with them. Instead, their husbands started having sex with their Thracian slave-girls. In anger, the women of Lemnos murdered the entire male population of the island, as well as all the Thracian slaves. When Jason and his crew of Argonauts arrived on Lemnos, they mated with the sex-starved women under Aphrodite's approval and repopulated the island. From then on, the women of Lemnos never disrespected Aphrodite again.\n\nIn Euripides's tragedy \"Hippolytus\", which was first performed at the City Dionysia in 428 BC, Theseus's son Hippolytus worships only Artemis, the goddess of virginity, and refuses to engage in any form of sexual contact. Aphrodite is infuriated by his prideful behavior and, in the prologue to the play, she declares that, by honoring only Artemis and refusing to venerate her, Hippolytus has directly challenged her authority. Aphrodite therefore causes Hippolytus's stepmother, Phaedra, to fall in love with him, knowing Hippolytus will reject her. After being rejected, Phaedra commits suicide and leaves a suicide note to Theseus telling him that she killed herself because Hippolytus attempted to rape her. Theseus prays to Poseidon to kill Hippolytus for his transgression. Poseidon sends a wild bull to scare Hippolytus's horses as he is riding by the sea in his chariot, causing the horses to bolt and smash the chariot against the cliffs, dragging Hippolytus to a bloody death across the rocky shoreline. The play concludes with Artemis vowing to kill Aphrodite's own mortal beloved (presumably Adonis) in revenge.\n\nGlaucus of Corinth angered Aphrodite by refusing to let his horses for chariot racing mate, since doing so would hinder their speed. During the chariot race at the funeral games of King Pelias, Aphrodite drove his horses mad and they tore him apart. Polyphonte was a young woman who chose a virginal life with Artemis instead of marriage and children, as favoured by Aphrodite. Aphrodite cursed her, causing her to have children by a bear. The resulting offspring, Agrius and Oreius, were wild cannibals who incurred the hatred of Zeus. Ultimately, he transformed all the members of the family into birds of ill omen.\n\nThe myth of the Judgement of Paris is mentioned briefly in the \"Iliad\", but is described in depth in an epitome of the \"Cypria\", a lost poem of the Epic Cycle, which records that all the gods and goddesses as well as various mortals were invited to the marriage of Peleus and Thetis (the eventual parents of Achilles). Only Eris, goddess of discord, was not invited. She was annoyed at this, so she arrived with a golden apple inscribed with the word καλλίστῃ (kallistēi, \"for the fairest\"), which she threw among the goddesses. Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena all claimed to be the fairest, and thus the rightful owner of the apple.\n\nThe goddesses chose to place the matter before Zeus, who, not wanting to favor one of the goddesses, put the choice into the hands of Paris, a Trojan prince. After bathing in the spring of Mount Ida where Troy was situated, the goddesses appeared before Paris for his decision. In the extant ancient depictions of the Judgement of Paris, Aphrodite is only occasionally represented nude, and Athena and Hera are always fully clothed. Since the Renaissance, however, western paintings have typically portrayed all three goddesses as completely naked.\n\nAll three goddesses were ideally beautiful and Paris could not decide between them, so they resorted to bribes. Hera tried to bribe Paris with power over all Asia and Europe, and Athena offered wisdom, fame and glory in battle, but Aphrodite promised Paris that, if he were to choose her as the fairest, she would let him marry the most beautiful woman on earth. This woman was Helen, who was already married to King Menelaus of Sparta. Paris selected Aphrodite and awarded her the apple. The other two goddesses were enraged and, as a direct result, sided with the Greeks in the Trojan War.\n\nAphrodite plays an important and active role throughout the entirety of Homer's \"Iliad\". In Book III, she rescues Paris from Menelaus after he foolishly challenges him to a one-on-one duel. She then appears to Helen in the form of an old woman and attempts to persuade her to have sex with Paris, reminding her of his physical beauty and athletic prowess. Helen immediately recognizes Aphrodite by her beautiful neck, perfect breasts, and flashing eyes and chides the goddess, addressing her as her equal. Aphrodite sharply rebukes Helen, reminding her that, if she vexes her, she will punish her just as much as she has favored her already. Helen demurely obeys Aphrodite's command.\n\nIn Book V, Aphrodite charges into battle to rescue her son Aeneas from the Greek hero Diomedes. Diomedes recognizes Aphrodite as a \"weakling\" goddess and, thrusting his spear, nicks her wrist through her \"ambrosial robe\". Aphrodite borrows Ares's chariot to ride back to Mount Olympus. Zeus chides her for putting herself in danger, reminding her that \"her specialty is love, not war.\" According to Walter Burkert, this scene directly parallels a scene from Tablet VI of the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" in which Ishtar, Aphrodite's Akkadian precursor, cries to her mother Antu after the hero Gilgamesh rejects her sexual advances, but is mildly rebuked by her father Anu. In Book XIV of the \"Iliad\", during the \"Dios Apate\" episode, Aphrodite lends her \"kestos himas\" to Hera for the purpose of seducing Zeus and distracting him from the combat while Poseidon aids the Greek forces on the beach. In the \"Theomachia\" in Book XXI, Aphrodite again enters the battlefield to carry Ares away after he is wounded.\n\nAphrodite's most prominent avian symbol was the dove, which was originally an important symbol of her Near Eastern precursor Inanna-Ishtar. (In fact, the ancient Greek word for \"dove\", \"peristerá\", may be derived from a Semitic phrase \"peraḥ Ištar\", meaning \"bird of Ishtar\".) Aphrodite frequently appears with doves in ancient Greek pottery and the temple of Aphrodite Pandemos on the southwest slope of the Athenian Acropolis was decorated with relief sculptures of doves with knotted fillets in their beaks. Votive offerings of small, white, marble doves were also discovered in the temple of Aphrodite at Daphni. In addition to her associations with doves, Aphrodite was also closely linked with sparrows and she is described riding in a chariot pulled by sparrows in Sappho's \"Ode to Aphrodite\".\n\nBecause of her connections to the sea, Aphrodite was associated with a number of different types of water fowl, including swans, geese, and ducks. Aphrodite's other symbols included the sea, conch shells, and roses. The rose and myrtle flowers were both sacred to Aphrodite. Her most important fruit emblem was the apple, but she was also associated with pomegranates, possibly because the red seeds suggested sexuality or because Greek women sometimes used pomegranates as a method of birth control. In Greek art, Aphrodite is often also accompanied by dolphins and Nereids.\n\nA scene of Aphrodite rising from the sea appears on the back of the Ludovisi Throne ( 460 BC), which was probably originally part of a massive altar that was constructed as part of the Ionic temple to Aphrodite in the Greek polis of Locri Epizephyrii in Magna Graecia in southern Italy. The throne shows Aphrodite rising from the sea, clad in a diaphanous garment, which is drenched with seawater and clinging to her body, revealing her upturned breasts and the outline of her navel. Her hair hangs dripping as she reaches to two attendants standing barefoot on the rocky shore on either side of her, lifting her out of the water. Scenes with Aphrodite appear in works of classical Greek pottery, including a famous white-ground \"kylix\" by the Pistoxenos Painter dating the between 470 and 460 BC, showing her riding on a swan or goose.\n\nIn BC, the Athenian sculptor Praxiteles carved the marble statue \"Aphrodite of Knidos\", which Pliny the Elder later praised as the greatest sculpture ever made. The statue showed a nude Aphrodite modestly covering her pubic region while resting against a water pot with her robe draped over it for support. The \"Aphrodite of Knidos\" was the first ever full-sized statue to depict Aphrodite completely naked and one of the first sculptures that was intended to be viewed from all sides. The statue was purchased by the people of Knidos in around 350 BC and proved to be tremendously influential on later depictions of Aphrodite. The original sculpture has been lost, but written descriptions of it as well several depictions of it on coins are still extant and over sixty copies, small-scale models, and fragments of it have been identified.\n\nThe Greek painter Apelles of Kos, a contemporary of Praxiteles, produced the panel painting \"Aphrodite Anadyomene\" (\"Aphrodite Rising from the Sea\"). According to Athenaeus, Apelles was inspired to paint the painting after watching the courtesan Phryne take off her clothes, untie her hair, and bathe naked in the sea at Eleusis. The painting was displayed in the Asclepeion on the island of Kos. The \"Aphrodite Anadyomene\" went unnoticed for centuries, but Pliny the Elder records that, in his own time, it was regarded as Apelles's most famous work.\n\nDuring the Hellenistic and Roman periods, statues depicting Aphrodite proliferated; many of these statues were modeled at least to some extent on Praxiteles's \"Aphrodite of Knidos\". Some statues show Aphrodite crouching naked; others show her wringing water out of her hair as she rises from the sea. Another common type of statue is known as \"Aphrodite Kallipygos\", the name of which is Greek for \"Aphrodite of the Beautiful Buttocks\"; this type of sculpture shows Aphrodite lifting her \"peplos\" to display her buttocks to the viewer while looking back at them from over her shoulder. The ancient Romans produced massive numbers of copies of Greek sculptures of Aphrodite and more sculptures of Aphrodite have survived from antiquity than of any other deity.\n\nEarly Christians frequently adapted pagan iconography to suit Christian purposes. In the Early Middle Ages, Christians adapted elements of Aphrodite/Venus's iconography and applied them to Eve and prostitutes, but also female saints and even the Virgin Mary. Christians in the east reinterpreted the story of Aphrodite's birth as a metaphor for baptism; in a Coptic stele from the sixth century AD, a female orant is shown wearing Aphrodite's conch shell as a sign that she is newly baptized. Throughout the Middle Ages, villages and communities across Europe still maintained folk tales and traditions about Aphrodite/Venus and travelers reported a wide variety of stories. Numerous Roman mosaics of Venus survived in Britain, preserving memory of the pagan past. In North Africa in the late fifth century AD, Fulgentius of Ruspe encountered mosaics of Aphrodite and reinterpreted her as a symbol of the sin of Lust, arguing that she was shown naked because \"the sin of lust is never cloaked\" and that she was often shown \"swimming\" because \"all lust suffers shipwreck of its affairs.\" He also argued that she was associated with doves and conchs because these are symbols of copulation, and that she was associated with roses because \"as the rose gives pleasure, but is swept away by the swift movement of the seasons, so lust is pleasant for a moment, but is swept away forever.\"\n\nWhile Fulgentius had appropriated Aphrodite as a symbol of Lust, Isidore of Seville ( 560–636) interpreted her as a symbol of marital procreative sex and declared that the moral of the story of Aphrodite's birth is that sex can only be holy in the presence of semen, blood, and heat, which he regarded as all being necessary for procreation. Meanwhile, Isidore denigrated Aphrodite/Venus's son Eros/Cupid as a \"demon of fornication\" (\"daemon fornicationis\"). Aphrodite/Venus was best known to Western European scholars through her appearances in Virgil's \"Aeneid\" and Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\". Venus is mentioned in the Latin poem \"Pervigilium Veneris\" (\"The Eve of Saint Venus\"), written in the third or fourth century AD, and in Giovanni Boccaccio's \"Genealogia Deorum Gentilium\".\n\nAphrodite is the central figure in Sandro Botticelli's painting \"Primavera\", which has been described as \"one of the most written about, and most controversial paintings in the world\", and \"one of the most popular paintings in Western art\". The story of Aphrodite's birth from the foam was a popular subject matter for painters during the Italian Renaissance, who were attempting to consciously reconstruct Apelles of Kos's lost masterpiece \"Aphrodite Anadyomene\" based on the literary \"ekphrasis\" of it preserved by Cicero and Pliny the Elder. Artists also drew inspiration from Ovid's description of the birth of Venus in his \"Metamorphoses\". Sandro Botticelli's \"The Birth of Venus\" ( 1485) was also partially inspired by a description by Poliziano of a relief on the subject. Later Italian renditions of the same scene include Titian's \"Venus Anadyomene\" ( 1525) and Raphael's painting in the \"Stufetta del cardinal Bibbiena\" (1516). Titian's biographer Giorgio Vasari identified all of Titian's paintings of naked women as paintings of \"Venus\", including an erotic painting from 1534, which he called the \"Venus of Urbino\", even though the painting does not contain any of Aphrodite/Venus's traditional iconography and the woman in it is clearly shown in a contemporary setting, not a classical one.\nJacques-Louis David's final work was his 1824 \"magnum opus\", \"Mars Being Disarmed by Venus\", which combines elements of classical, Renaissance, traditional French art, and contemporary artistic styles. While he was working on the painting, David described it, saying, \"This is the last picture I want to paint, but I want to surpass myself in it. I will put the date of my seventy-five years on it and afterwards I will never again pick up my brush.\" The painting was exhibited first in Brussels and then in Paris, where over 10,000 people came to see it. Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres's painting \"Venus Anadyomene\" was one of his major works. Louis Geofroy described it as a \"dream of youth realized with the power of maturity, a happiness that few obtain, artists or others.\" Théophile Gautier declared: \"Nothing remains of the marvelous painting of the Greeks, but surely if anything could give the idea of antique painting as it was conceived following the statues of Phidias and the poems of Homer, it is M. Ingres's painting: the \"Venus Anadyomene\" of Apelles has been found.\" Other critics dismissed it as a piece of unimaginative, sentimental kitsch, but Ingres himself considered it to be among his greatest works and used the same figure as the model for his later 1856 painting \"La Source\".\n\nPaintings of Venus were favorites of the late nineteenth-century Academic artists in France. In 1863, Alexandre Cabanel won widespread critical acclaim at the Paris Salon for his painting \"The Birth of Venus\", which the French emperor Napoleon III immediately purchased for his own personal art collection. Édouard Manet's 1865 painting \"Olympia\" parodied the nude Venuses of the Academic painters, particularly Cabanel's \"Birth of Venus\". In 1867, the English Academic painter Frederic Leighton displayed his \"Venus Disrobing for the Bath\" at the Academy. The art critic J. B. Atkinson praised it, declaring that \"Mr Leighton, instead of adopting corrupt Roman notions regarding Venus such as Rubens embodied, has wisely reverted to the Greek idea of Aphrodite, a goddess worshipped, and by artists painted, as the perfection of female grace and beauty.\" A year later, the English painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti, a founding member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, painted \"Venus Verticordia\" (Latin for \"Aphrodite, the Changer of Hearts\"), showing Aphrodite as a nude red-headed woman in a garden of roses. Though he was reproached for his \"outré\" subject matter, Rossetti refused to alter the painting and it was soon purchased by J. Mitchell of Bradford. In 1879, William Adolphe Bouguereau exhibited at the Paris Salon his own \"Birth of Venus\", which imitated the classical tradition of \"contrapposto\" and was met with widespread critical acclaim, rivalling the popularity of Cabanel's version from nearly two decades prior.\nWilliam Shakespeare's erotic narrative poem \"Venus and Adonis\" (1593), a retelling of the courtship of Aphrodite and Adonis from Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", was the most popular of all his works published within his own lifetime. Six editions of it were published before Shakespeare's death (more than any of his other works) and it enjoyed particularly strong popularity among young adults. In 1605, Richard Barnfield lauded it, declaring that the poem had placed Shakespeare's name \"in fames immortall Booke\". Despite this, the poem has received mixed reception from modern critics; Samuel Taylor Coleridge defended it, but Samuel Butler complained that it bored him and C. S. Lewis described an attempted reading of it as \"suffocating\".\n\nAphrodite appears in Richard Garnett's short story collection \"The Twilight of the Gods and Other Tales\" (1888), in which the gods' temples have been destroyed by Christians. Stories revolving around sculptures of Aphrodite were common in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Examples of such works of literature include the novel \"The Tinted Venus: A Farcical Romance\" (1885) by Thomas Anstey Guthrie and the short story \"The Venus of Ille\" (1887) by Prosper Mérimée, both of which are about statues of Aphrodite that come to life. Another noteworthy example is \"Aphrodite in Aulis\" by the Anglo-Irish writer George Moore, which revolves around an ancient Greek family who moves to Aulis. The French writer Pierre Louÿs titled his erotic historical novel \"\" (1896) after the Greek goddess. The novel enjoyed widespread commercial success, but scandalized French audiences due to its sensuality and its decadent portrayal of Greek society.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, stories of Aphrodite were used by feminist poets, such as Amy Lowell and Alicia Ostriker. Many of these poems dealt with Aphrodite's legendary birth from the foam of the sea. Other feminist writers, including Claude Cahun, Thit Jensen, and Anaïs Nin also made use of the myth of Aphrodite in their writings. Ever since the publication of Isabel Allende's book \"Aphrodite: A Memoir of the Senses\" in 1998, the name \"Aphrodite\" has been used as a title for dozens of books dealing with all topics even superficially connected to her domain. Frequently these books do not even mention Aphrodite, or mention her only briefly, but make use of her name as a selling point.\n\nIn 1938, Gleb Botkin, a Russian immigrant to the United States, founded the Church of Aphrodite, a Neopagan religion centered around the worship of a Mother Goddess, whom its practitioners identified as Aphrodite. The Church of Aphrodite's theology was laid out in the book \"In Search of Reality\", published in 1969, two years before Botkin's death. The book portrayed Aphrodite in a drastically different light than the one in which the Greeks envisioned her, instead casting her as \"the sole Goddess of a somewhat Neoplatonic Pagan monotheism\". It claimed that the worship of Aphrodite had been brought to Greece by the mystic teacher Orpheus, but that the Greeks had misunderstood Orpheus's teachings and had not realized the importance of worshipping Aphrodite alone.\n\nAphrodite is a major deity in Wicca, a contemporary nature-based syncretic Neopagan religion. Wiccans regard Aphrodite as one aspect of the Goddess and she is frequently invoked by name during enchantments dealing with love and romance. Wiccans regard Aphrodite as the ruler of human emotions, erotic spirituality, creativity, and art. As one of the twelve Olympians, Aphrodite is a major deity within Hellenismos (Hellenic Polytheistic Reconstructionism), a Neopagan religion which seeks to authentically revive and recreate the religion of ancient Greece in the modern world. Unlike Wiccans, Hellenists are usually strictly polytheistic or pantheistic. Hellenists venerate Aphrodite primarily as the goddess of romantic love, but also as a goddess of sexuality, the sea, and war. Her many epithets include \"Sea Born\", \"Killer of Men\", \"She upon the Graves\", \"Fair Sailing\", and \"Ally in War\".\n\n\n\n"}

It takes its name from the \"bimo\", shaman-priests who are also masters of Yi language and scriptures, wearing distinctive black robes and large hats.\n\nSince the 1980s, with the loosening of religion restrictions in China, Bimoism has undergone a revitalisation. In 1996, the Bimo Culture Research Center was founded. In the early 2010s, the government of China has helped the revival of the Bimoist faith through the construction of large temples and ceremonial complexes.\n\nThe \"bimo\", once considered by the Chinese government to be promoting a \"backwards religion\", are now being promoted as ambassadors of Yi culture. They organise large-scale rituals for the yearly Torch Festival.\n\nNosu Bimoism, the religion of the Nosu or Nuosu subgroup of the Yi, distinguishes two sorts of shamans: the \"bimo\" and the \"suni\", respectively hereditary and ordained priests. One can become bimo by patrilineal descent after a time of apprenticeship or formally acknowledging an old bimo as the teacher. A suni must be elected.\n\nBimo can read Yi scripts while suni cannot. Both can perform rituals, but only bimo can perform rituals linked to death. In most cases, suni only perform some exorcisms to cure diseases. Generally, suni can only be from humble civil birth while bimo can be of both aristocratic and humble families.\n\nBimo officiate at births, funerals, weddings and holidays. They are often seen along the street consulting ancient scripts. The Yi worship deified ancestors similarly to the Chinese traditional religion practitioners, besides gods of local nature: fire, hills, trees, rocks, water, earth, sky, wind, and forests.\n\nRitual performances play a major role in daily life through healing, exorcism, blessing, divination and analysis of one's relationship with the gods. They believe dragons (symbols of generation) protect villages against bad spirits. The Yi dragon is represented in Yi art differently from that in Han art.\n\nAfter someone dies, a pig or sheep is sacrificed at the doorway to maintain relationship with the deceased spirit. The Yi believe in numerous evil spirits. They believe that spirits cause illness, poor harvests and other misfortunes and inhabit all material things. The Yi also believe in multiple souls. At death, one soul remains to watch the grave while the other is eventually reincarnated into some living form.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1886671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1886671", "title": "Black drink", "text": "Black drink\n\nBlack drink is a name for several kinds of ritual beverages brewed by Native Americans in the Southeastern United States. Traditional ceremonial people of the Yuchi, Caddo, Chickasaw, Cherokee, Choctaw, Muscogee and some other Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands use the black drink in purification ceremonies. It was occasionally known as \"white drink\" because of the association of the color white with peace leaders in some Native cultures in the Southeast.\n\nThe preparation and protocols vary between tribes and ceremonial grounds; a prominent ingredient is the roasted leaves and stems of \"Ilex vomitoria\" (commonly known as yaupon holly), a plant native to the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Black drink also usually contains emetic herbs.\n\nAccording to the ethnohistorical record, the yaupon leaves and branches used for the black drink were traditionally picked as close to the time of its planned consumption as possible. After picking, historically they were lightly parched in a ceramic container over fire. The roasting increases the solubility in water of the caffeine, which is the same reason coffee beans are roasted. After browning, they were boiled in large containers of water until the liquid reached a dark brown or black color, giving it its name. The liquid was then strained into containers to cool, until it was cool enough to not scald the skin, and drunk while still hot. Because caffeine is 30 times more soluble in boiling water than room temperature water, this heightened its effect. It was then consumed in a ritual manner. Its physiological effects are believed to be mainly those of massive doses of caffeine. Three to six cups of strong coffee is equal to 0.5 to 1.0 grams of caffeine; the black drink could have delivered at least this much and possibly up to 3.0 to 6.0 grams of caffeine. Owen gives the caffeine content of coffee as between 1.01 and 1.42 percent In comparison, \"Ilex vomitoria\" leaves contain 0.0038 to 0.2288 percent caffeine by weight according to experiments performed by Adam Edwards in 2002. Similar methods of production were adopted by European colonists for the production of a drink that often shared the same names with Native names for the black drink but used for different, secular purposes.\n\nWhile the general method of production is known, not all details of the preparation and ceremonial usage of the black drink are. The source of the emetic effect of black drink is not known and has been speculated upon by historians, archaeologists, and botanists. Some professionals believe it to be caused by the addition of poisonous button snakeroot.\n\nContemporary preparation and usage of the black drink by Native Americans is less well documented. Online recipes for the black drink have been criticized by some Native Americans as potentially dangerous and potentially poisonous due those recipes leaving out key steps. The berries of the yaupon holly are poisonous. Kidney failure is one possible outcome of consuming beverages containing holly leaves. Adam Edwards and Bradley Bennett tested stems, roots, and leaves of the yaupon. They found that the only possible toxic substance was theobromine, an alkaloid, but the amounts of the chemical were so low that a single gram of cocoa contained over 2,255 times more theobromine than yaupon.\n\nArchaeologists have demonstrated the use of various kinds of black drink among Native American groups stretching back far into antiquity, possibly dating to Late Archaic times. During the Hopewell period, the shell cups known from later black drink rituals become common in high-status burials along with mortuary pottery and engraved stone and copper tablets. The significance of the shell cups may indicate the beginning of black drink ceremonialism. The fact that both the shells and the yaupon holly come from the same geographical location may indicate they were traded together in the Hopewell Interaction Sphere. The appearance of shell cups can be used as a virtual marker for the advent of Hopewell Culture in many instances. During the Mississippian culture period, the presence of items associated with the black drink ceremony had spread over most of the south, with many hundreds of examples from Etowah, Spiro, Moundville and Hiwassee Island.\n\nArchaeologists working at Cahokia, the largest Mississippian culture settlement located near the modern city of St. Louis, found distinctive and relatively rare pottery beakers dating from 1050 to 1250 CE. The beakers are small round pots with a handle on one side and a tiny lip on the opposing side. The surfaces of the unfired vessels was incised with motifs representing water and the underworld and resemble the whelk shells known to have been used for the consumption of the beverage during historic times. The inside of the vessels were found to be coated with a plant residue, which when tested was found to contain theobromine, caffeine and ursolic acid in the right proportions to have come from the \"Ilex vomitoria\". The presence of the black drink in the Greater Cahokia area at this early date pushes back the definitive use of the black drink by several centuries. The presence of the black drink hundreds of miles outside of its natural range on the East and Gulf coasts is evidence of a substantial trade network with the southeast, a trade that also involved sharks teeth and whelk shells.\n\nIn historic accounts from the 16th and 17th century, the black drink is usually imbibed in rituals using a cup made of marine shell. Three main species of marine shells have been identified as being used as cups for the black drink, lightning whelk, emperor helmet, and the horse conch. The most common was the lightning whelk, which has a left-handed or sinistral spiral. The left-handed spiral may have held religious significance because of its association with dance and ritual. The center columnella, which runs longitudinally down the shell, would be removed, and the rough edges sanded down to make a dipper-like cup. The columnella would then be used as a pendant, a motif that shows up frequently in Southeastern Ceremonial Complex designs. In the archaeological record columnella pendants are usually found in conjunction with bi-lobed arrows, stone maces, earspools, and necklace beads(all of which are motifs identified with the \"falcon dancer/warrior/chunkey player\" mythological figure). Artifacts made from these marine shells have been found as far north as Wisconsin and as far west as Oklahoma. Several examples of cups from Moundville and Spiro have been found to have rings of black residue in the bottoms, suggesting they were used for black drink rituals. Many examples of shell cups found in Mississippian culture mounds are engraved with S.E.C.C. imagery. A few examples portray what is theorized to be black drink rituals, including what some anthropologists have interpreted as vomit issuing from the mouths of mythological beings.\n\nPottery samples recovered from sites in modern Southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico have tested positive for the ratio of methylxanthines associated with those produced by \"Ilex vomitoria\". The same study also identified methylxanthines ratios associated with \"Theobroma cacao\". Neither plants are native to the areas from which the pottery samples were recovered, which suggests trading between areas where those plants are native. The chemical analysis also suggests a possible increase in drinks prepared from cacao after the year 1200, and a decrease in the use of drinks prepared from \"Ilex vomitoria\". Freshwater shells from Texas and Arkansas have been recovered from Pueblo Bonito, which have been used as possible evidence for the trade of \"Ilex vomitoria\" from the east. There are also some stands of \"Ilex vomitoria\" in Mesoamerica, so the exact origins of the \"Ilex vomitoria\" used to prepare the drinks is currently unknown.\n\nA number of tribes across the Southeastern United States use a form of the black drink in their ceremonies. Muscogee Creeks, Cherokees, Choctaws, Ais, Guale, Chickasaws, Chitimacha, Timucua and others are documented users of a type of black drink. Although rituals vary amongst the different tribes, there are some common traits among them. Black drink is most commonly drunk by men, who also prepare it, but there are some accounts of its preparation and use by women among some groups. Removal of tribes to areas outside the natural range of \"Ilex vomitoria\" has been partially responsible for a decline in the preparation of the black drink among present Native Americans.\n\nIn 1696, Jonathan Dickinson witnessed the use of a beverage brewed from the Yaupon Holly among the Ais of Florida. Dickinson later learned that the Spanish called the plant \"casseena\". The Ais parched the leaves in a pot, and then boiled them. The resulting liquid was then transferred to a large bowl using a gourd that had a long neck with a small hole at the top, and a hole in the side. On the occasion Dickinson witnessed, he estimated that there were nearly three gallons of the beverage in the bowl. After the liquid had cooled, the chief was presented with a conch-shell of the beverage. The chief threw part of it on the ground as a blessing and drank the rest. The chief's associates were then served in turn. Lower status men, women, and children were not allowed to touch or taste the beverage. The chief and his associates sat drinking this brew, smoking and talking for most of the day. In the evening, the bowl that had held the beverage was covered with a skin to make a drum. The Ais, accompanied by the drum and some rattles, sang and danced until the middle of the night.\n\nCherokee black drink is taken for purification at several traditional ceremonies. Made with emetics, the complete recipe is not shared with the public. The black drink induces vomiting for purification purposes. Other ritual medicinal beverages are also used in the ceremonies. \"Ilex vomitoria\" was not native to the traditional area controlled by the Cherokee before removal, but it was brought in to the area through trade and then transplanted.\n\nAmong the Muscogee the black drink is called \"ássi\". In the ceremonies of some cultures that use the drink, after its preparation it is passed out to the highest-status person first, then the next highest status, and so forth. During each person's turn to drink, ritual songs may be sung \"Yahola\". Its use was traditionally limited to only adult men. The ritual name \"Asi Yahola\" or \"Black Drink Singer\" is corrupted into English as \"Osceola\").\n\nAmong the Timucua, a type of black drink was called \"cacina\" by the Spanish. The preparation and consumption of the drink were strictly limited to the community council house. Women (other than an occasional female chief) were normally excluded from the council house except for activities such as dances, but did prepare the \"cacina\". In 1678 a bedridden \"cacica\" (a female chief) was given permission to brew and consume \"cacina\" in her house, on the condition that no one else could be present while she did so.\n\nAfter European contact with tribes in what is today the Southeastern United States, colonists began using the charred leaves of the yaupon holly to make a tea similar to the black drink, but without the ritual vomiting of it. Its use by colonists in Spanish Florida is documented as far back as 1615. An account from that year describes Spaniards as experiencing symptoms that would now be described as caffeine dependence due to daily consumption of what they called \"cacina\" or \"té del indio\". The use of \"Ilex vomitoria\" by colonists for tea making and for medicinal uses in the Carolinas is documented by the early eighteenth century. In the English-speaking colonies, it was known variously as cassina, yaupon tea, Indian tea, Carolina tea, and Appalachian tea. It was commonly believed to be and used as a diuretic. By the late 1700s, yaupon tea was described as being more commonly used in North Carolina at breakfast than tea made with \"Camellia sinensis\". In addition to using it on their own, Spanish and British colonist often drank black drink when engaging in discussions and treaties with Natives. Its preparation by British and Spanish colonists was nearly identical to the method of preparation used by their Native neighbors. Its use by colonists in French Louisiana is speculated to have occurred, but lacks documentation other than one source describing its medicinal uses from 1716.\n\nDuring the Civil War, yaupon tea was used as a substitute for coffee and tea throughout the South. Yaupon continued to be used in North Carolina for medicinal purposes and as a common drink until the late 1890s. At that point, its use was stigmatized because of its natural abundance as being a habit associated with rural poor people. By 1928 it was described as only being in common use by on Knotts Island, North Carolina. During the Interwar period the United States Department of Agriculture investigated the use of cassina tea as a substitute for coffee and tea. There were also a few attempts at the commercialization of cassina tea during that same period. By 1973 it was believed that cassina tea was only being served at the Pony Island Restaurant on Ocracoke Island, North Carolina. In the early 2000s yaupon tea began witnessing a resurgence in its popularity, and can now be purchased online and at several historical sites related to Native Americans.\n\n\n\n"}

Beausoleil has continued to be a professional musician as well as developing into a visual artist and creative media technologist during the years of his incarceration.\n\nBeausoleil was born on November 6, 1947, in Santa Barbara, California to a working-class family. Beausoleil's father was a milkman. Beausoleil was a good-looking and rebellious youth. By 15, he was sent to reform school. After reform school, he drifted between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Beausoleil was involved in music and acting. He joined several rock bands in 1966, including The Milky Way and Love. In the following year he met Kenneth Anger, and had a part in Anger's film \"Lucifer Rising\". In 1969, Beausoleil was living with Gary Hinman when Beausoleil began associating with Charles Manson and his cult.\n\nAs described in the book \"Helter Skelter\" by Manson prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi, Gary Hinman was killed over money and property that Manson claimed Hinman owed to the Family. It was also intended to serve as the first of a series of murders committed by the Family to start \"Helter Skelter\", a \"war\" that Manson had preached to his Family would happen in the summer of 1969. Accompanying Beausoleil that night were Susan Atkins and Mary Brunner, both of whom were later involved in other murders and crimes as well.\n\nMore than a decade later, Beausoleil said that Hinman had supplied him with a batch of bad mescaline that Beausoleil in turn had sold to the Straight Satans motorcycle gang. When the bikers demanded their money back, Manson ordered Beausoleil to Hinman's residence to get the money. Hinman is said to have refused to pay, saying \"I don't have any money to give you.\" Beausoleil called Manson back at Spahn Ranch to tell him that no money was forthcoming. Beausoleil, Atkins and Brunner then held him captive in his own home to convince him to refund the money.\n\nManson arrived and proceeded to slice off a part of Hinman's ear with a sword. Atkins and Brunner stitched it up with dental floss afterwards. Manson then ordered Beausoleil to kill Hinman and told him to make it look as if the crime had been committed by black revolutionaries, as he had been predicting to his Family that a race war was imminent. Beausoleil stabbed Hinman to death as Hinman chanted a Buddhist chant. Afterwards, he wrote the words \"Political piggy\" on a wall in Hinman's blood in an attempt to lead police to believe the murder was done by a group of radicals. After he wrote the words, Beausoleil dipped his hand in Hinman's blood and left a paw print, symbolizing The Black Panthers, in order to mislead the investigators of Hinman's murder. Beausoleil was subsequently arrested on August 6, 1969, after falling asleep in Hinman's broken down Fiat alongside the highway at Cuesta Grade, a steep segment of U.S. Route 101 between San Luis Obispo and Atascadero.\n\nAt Beausoleil's two trials for the murder, the defense mentioned nothing about the murder being the result of a drug transaction gone wrong. His first revelation of this came in 1981, 12 years after the murders, in an interview published in \"Oui\" magazine. In that interview, he also denied that Manson had come to the Hinman residence during the event that led to the murder, although he later reversed himself about that aspect. This is the version that Beausoleil currently maintains as truth. Also, conspirator Susan Atkins had stated before her death that she never heard any mention by Beausoleil indicating that the reason they went to Hinman's residence had anything to do with a drug transaction. See Helter Skelter (Manson scenario) for more details on the murders perpetrated by Charles Manson and members of his Family.\n\nOn April 18, 1970, a Superior Court jury in Los Angeles found Beausoleil, aged 22, guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death. His sentence was commuted to life imprisonment when the California Supreme Court ruled the then-prevailing death penalty statutes unconstitutional in 1972.\n\nBeausoleil began serving his sentence on June 23, 1970. He was incarcerated in Oregon between May 1994 and August 2015. He is currently housed at California Medical Facility in Vacaville, California.\n\nBeausoleil's initial parole suitability hearing was held on August 15, 1978. He has had 18 subsequent suitability hearings and has been denied at each one. Beausoleil's 2010 parole was denied. On October 14, 2016, California parole authorities announced that Beausoleil's 2016 bid was also denied. \n\nHe will be eligible to have another parole hearing in January 2019.\n\nBeausoleil was to star in Kenneth Anger's film \"Lucifer Rising\", but little was shot before Beausoleil and Anger had a falling out and the project was abandoned. Some of the footage later appeared in \"Invocation of My Demon Brother\" (and again in the resurrected \"Lucifer Rising\" film). He appeared in a softcore porn film titled \"The Ramrodder\" (a.k.a. \"Savage Passion\"), which also featured his friend Catherine Share, who went on to become a full-fledged member of the Manson Family. This film was shot, in part, at the infamous Spahn Ranch. \n\nBeausoleil had a brief appearance as Cupid in the 1967 film \"Mondo Hollywood\", a documentary about the social, political and cultural climate of Los Angeles featuring a wide cast of Hollywood figures, including hair stylist Jay Sebring, who was also murdered by the Family.\n\nAround 1965, Beausoleil was a member of Arthur Lee's band the Grass Roots, not to be confused with the successful recording artists of the same name. To avoid confusion, the band later changed its name to Love. Lee claimed to have bestowed the nickname \"Bummer Bob\" on Beausoleil due to a drug burn. Beausoleil claims that Lee named his band Love in reference to another of his many nicknames \"Cupid\". Around 1966, Beausoleil joined a band called The Orkustra; bandmate David LaFlamme went on to greater success with It's a Beautiful Day. Following his stint in The Orkustra, Beausoleil put together the band he called The Magick Powerhouse of Oz.\n\nIn the late 1970s, with the permission of the prison, he composed and recorded the soundtrack for Kenneth Anger's film \"Lucifer Rising\". The official Beausoleil soundtrack was released on CD (along with archival material from The Orkustra and The Magick Powerhouse of Oz) in 2004. He recorded and released two albums of instrumental material (\"Orb\" and \"Mantra\").\n\nIn 2005, a selection of his artwork was exhibited in Clair Obscur Gallery, Los Angeles. Just before the exhibition, the gallery exhibited photos of Sharon Tate. The parole board, in denying parole in 2005, stated that this display and marketing of Beausoleil's artwork was exploitative of the victims and showed a lapse of judgment by Beausoleil.\n\nIn 2013, \"The Lucifer Rising Suite\" was rereleased for the last time on LP. This anthology documents the entire \"Lucifer Rising\" soundtrack project from its earliest beginnings in 1967 to its ultimate completion and delivery to the filmmaker in 1979. In addition to the actual soundtrack, alternate themes, musical and soundscape experiments, and some live performances are contained in the boxed set. All of those recordings were acquired from the original reel-to-reel tapes and meticulously restorceed and mastered for vinyl by Robert Ferbrache. In 2014, a CD version of the boxed set was released. This album package has all of the features of the LP version scaled down to compact disc size.\n\nIn 2014, a compilation titled \"Whispers Through The Black Veil\" was released on the Wyrd War label containing the song \"The Wailing On Witch Mountain,\" recorded in 2012, which was composed, performed and recorded by Beausoleil.\n\nIn 2018 with The Ajna Offensive, Bobby Beausoleil released his 2-disk concept album, \"Voodooo Shivaya\", featuring vocal and instrumental tracks that showcase his journey to spiritual understanding. Among the vocal tracks performed by BeauSoleil are both covers and original songs. Guest performances include Annabel Lee Moynihan, Michael Moynihan, Robert Ferbrache, (who are all also in Blood Axis) and Mike Behrenhausen. The triple gatefold LP and CD packaging integrates Nicholas Syracuse's photography with calligraphy by Timo Ketola. This album was recorded at Oregon State Penitentiary between 2008 and 2015.\n\nTruman Capote interviewed Beausoleil while the latter was imprisoned in San Quentin State Prison. Capote then published the interview in the form of a short story \"Then It All Came Down,\" included in \"Music for Chameleons\". Beausoleil's response to the Capote interview can be read here in its entirety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Chinese translation can be found in the Taishō Tripiṭaka. The Tibetan translation can be found in Peking (Beijing) Kangyur 256. From the Tibetan it was also translated into Mongolian and the Manchu languages. It is known alternatively as the ().\n\nThe \"Brahmajāla Sūtra\" is related to the important Huayan metaphor of Indra's net.\n\nIt is not related to the \"Brahmajala Sutta\" of the Pāli Canon of Theravada Buddhism.\n\nThe sutra is traditionally regarded as having been recorded in Sanskrit and then translated into Chinese by Kumārajīva in 406. Several scholars assume that it was composed in East Asia by unknown authors in the mid-5th century, and is apocryphal. The sutra itself claims that it is part of a much longer Sanskrit text, but such a text has never been found. Qu Dacheng (pinyin transliteration) or Wut Tai Shing (Cantonese transliteration) suggests that because the contents of the longer Brahmajala Sutra very much resembled the Avataṃsaka Sutra that was already translated, the translators of the Brahmajala Sutra only translated the key differences. Many scholars and most Mahayana monastics believe the sutra is not apocryphal. Amoghavajra, one of the patriarchs of Shingon Buddhism who was fluent in both Sanskrit and Chinese, stated that the Brahmajala Sutra is a part of the Vajrasekhara Sutra that was not translated into Chinese. Ven. Taixu on his study of the Brahmajala Sutra and the Mahayana Yoga of the Adamantine Sea Mañjuśrī Thousand Arms Thousand Bowls Great King of Tantra noted many similarities between the two and therefore the Brahmajala Sutra must have been translated from Sanskrit. Qu Dacheng states that the Brahmajala Sutra whilst not translated by Kumārajīva is unlikely to be apocryphal. Of special interest, Qu notes some of the Brahmajala Sutra's Ten Bodhisattva Bhūmi matches the Mahāvastu, an early Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Mahayana text never translated into Chinese.\n\nThis sutra introduces Vairocana and his relationship to Gautama Buddha. It also states ten major precepts for Bodhisattvas () and the 48 minor precepts to follow to advance along the bodhisattva path.\n\nThe bodhisattva precepts of the \"Brahmajala Sutra\" came to be treated in China as a higher ethic a monastic would adopt after ordination in addition to the prātimokṣa vows. In Japan, the ten precepts came to displace monastic rules almost completely starting with Saichō and the rise of the Tendai.\n\nThe name of the sutra derives from the vast net that the god Brahma hangs in his palace and how each jewel in the net reflects the light of every other jewel:\nThe sutra is also noteworthy for describing who Vairocana is as personification of the dharma or Dharmakāya:\n\nThe \"Brahmajala Sutra\" has a list of ten major and forty-eight minor rules known as the Bodhisattva Precepts. The Bodhisattva Precepts may be often called the \"Brahma Net Precepts\" (), particularly in Buddhist scholarship, although other sets of bodhisattva precepts may be found in other texts as well. Typically, in East Asian Mahayana traditions, only the 10 Major Precepts are considered the Bodhisattva Precepts. According to the sutra, the 10 Major Bodhisattva Precepts are in summary:\n\n\nBreaking any of these precepts is described as a prarajika (Skt. Unforgivable) offence.\n\n"}

It is one of 122 International Associations of the Faithful. The organization is affiliated with the Vatican recognition from the Pontifical Council for the Laity. It is led by an International Council, which operates in the Philippines under the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines and can report directly to the Vatican. The community is made up of family ministries, social arms, and a pro-life ministry.\n\nCouples for Christ (CFC) was established in 1981 by the charismatic community Ang Ligaya ng Panginoon (LNP; Filipino for \"The Joy of the Lord\") in Manila. Its target groups were married couples. The organisation would invite prospective couples to a private home for a series of weekly gospel discussions.\n\nSince 1993, CFC has also started other groups, including \"Kids for Christ\", \"Youth for Christ, \"Singles for Christ\", \"Handmaids of the Lord\" and \"Servants of the Lord\".\n\nIn 1996, CFC was approved by the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines as a National Private Association of Lay Faithful and in 2000, was recognized by the Holy See (Vatican) as a private international association of the lay faithful of Pontifical Right.\n\nCFC claims to have a presence in dioceses across all 81 Philippine provinces and 163 countries. It sent participants to the Extraordinary Synod on the Family, an event organized by Pope Francis in 2014.\n\nAny validly married Catholic couple can become members of CFC. Although a Catholic movement/organization, CFC remains open to having non-Catholic Christians as members.\n\nThose who want to join CFC will have to go through a weekly seminar series called the Christian Life Program (CLP), which usually spans 13 weeks or sessions. The CLP serves as the primary Evangelization approach, a core activity of CFC members.\n\nAt the end of the CLP, couple-participants are invited to dedicate themselves to the Lord as CFC members and to commit to participating actively in the life of the community and of the Church through regular prayer meetings, attendance in community assemblies and teachings, participation in parish life.\n\nCLP graduates are then grouped into cell groups called \"households,\" consisting of at least 4 and up to 7 couples under the pastoral care supervision of a family head.\n\nThe CLP is also the point of entry for those who wish to join CFC's Family Ministries:\n\nThe household groups or simply 'households' meet once a week or bi-weekly. Each member of the household is encouraged to host meetings at their home, when not held in Church meeting spaces. A household group operates as a 'family of families'.\n\nOver the course of CFC's existence, there has been some restructuring and changes of leadership, and occasionally, divisions. Despite these, the members at large are mostly unaffected, and the respective communities continue to flourish.\n\nIn 1993, a group led by Francisco Padilla, one of the original members recruited by LNP in 1981, severed CFC's ties from LNP citing differences in evangelization approaches. Padilla was CFC's Executive Director until 2007.\n\nIn August 2007, the same group of leaders announced the creation of a separate group known as Couples for Christ Foundation for Family and Life (CFC-FFL). This development, particularly since it was a direct offshoot of the bi-annual CFC elections that saw Frank Padilla and his group defeated, caused a division of membership within CFC, as some of its membership migrated to Foundation for Family and Life (FFL).\nFFL applied and was granted approval by SEC to use a defunct CFC foundation created in the 1980s, the Couples for Christ Foundation, Inc. The group continues to use the name, despite a Vatican admonition that \"no other group may use Couples for Christ\" in their name other than Couples For Christ Global Mission's Foundation, Inc.\n\nCFC leaders have stated that they are open to reconciliation with FFL, but do not expect a quick resolution, particularly since Padilla, current FFL Servant-General, continues to insist that only FFL is recognized by the Vatican. He bases this assertion on a statement issued by one official of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines who stated that “in the dioceses in the Philippines there can be two groups of the CFC provided again the bishop of the place will permit. Abroad, FFL may not use CFC in their names.\" The Vatican has not revoked the recognition given to CFC, evidence cited by CFC that indeed it is the Vatican-recognized CFC.\n\nPadilla's claim to be the founder of CFC, which is supported by FFL, is questioned by CFC. CFC's publication Origins of Couples for Christ directly responds to this claim by including the point of view of Vic Gutierrez, a former LNP leader who was responsible for the conceptualization of CFC in 1981.\n\nAlthough FFL has received support from some Philippine and foreign dioceses, CFC still retains its recognition as a Catholic ministry nationally in the Philippines and internationally. Many bishops have also declared recognition of CFC in their dioceses, including John J. Myers, Archbishop of Newark.\n\nIn 2009, CFC-Global found itself being split again into 2 groups, CFC-IC and CFC-Gawad Kalinga. This was triggered when the existing conflict between CFC and GK leaders resurfaced.\n\nIn 2014, an update of the Christian Life Program has been released to reflect that CFC is explicitly Catholic, truly global, and devotedly Marian.\n\nANCOP stands for Answering the Cry of the Poor. It is an umbrella program made for the purpose of consolidating CFC's efforts in 'Building the Church of the Poor,' essentially a social outreach undertaking. Shelter-building for the poor and child-education sponsorship are among its dominant sub-programs. Certain aspects affecting the society are also being addressed through the ANCOP program, such as health, education, livelihood and community development activities.\n\nAs a social outreach program, ANCOP also involves sectors such as migrants and their families, uniformed personnel, those in prison, and environment stakeholders. Through ANCOP, sub-organizations like cooperatives and mini-programs like The Cornerstone have materialized.\n\nABLAZE Communications, or simply \"ABLAZE\" is registered as a subsidiary of Couples for Christ. It is involved in the production of audio-visual presentations and merchandizing of products.\n\nLiveloud is an annual music event featuring Catholic Christian bands.\n\n\n"}

Since then—with three exceptions—all the first-born males of this dynasty died before they reigned.\n\nWith the end of the Braganzas' reigns, firstly in Brazil (1889) and later in Portugal (1910), the curse appears to have ended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5883250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5883250", "title": "Devil in Christianity", "text": "Devil in Christianity\n\nIn mainstream Christianity, the Devil (or Satan) is a fallen angel who rebelled against God. Satan was expelled from Heaven and sent to Earth. The devil is often identified as the serpent in the Garden of Eden, whose persuasions led to the two corresponding Christian doctrines: the Original Sin and its cure, the Redemption of Jesus Christ. He is also identified as the accuser of Job, the tempter of the Gospels, Leviathan and the dragon in the Book of Revelation.\n\nIn Christianity, the title Satan (Hebrew: הַשָּׂטָן \"ha-Satan\"), \"the adversary\", is a title of various entities, both divine and human, who challenge the faith of humans in the Hebrew Bible. \"Satan\" later became the name of the personification of evil. Christian tradition and theology changed \"Satan\" from an accuser appointed by God to test men's faith to God's godlike fallen opponent: \"the devil\", \"Shaitan\" in Arabic (the term used by Arab Christians and Muslims).\n\nTraditionally, Christians have understood the devil to be the author of lies and promoter of evil. However, the devil can go no further than the word of Christ the Logos allows, resulting in the problem of evil.\n\nLiberal Christianity often views the devil metaphorically. This is true of some Conservative Christian groups too, such as the Christadelphians and the Church of the Blessed Hope. Much of the popular lore of the devil is not biblical; instead, it is a post-medieval Christian reading of the scriptures influenced by medieval and pre-medieval Christian popular mythology.\n\nIn the view of many Christians, the devil's first appearance in the Old Testament is as the serpent in the Garden of Eden. The serpent tempts Adam and Eve into eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, which God had forbidden them to eat, thus causing their expulsion from the Garden and indirectly causing sin to enter the world. In God's rebuke to the serpent, he tells it \"And I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel.\" ()\n\nChristian scriptures are often interpreted to identify the serpent with the Devil. The deuterocanonical Book of Wisdom says, \"But by the envy of the devil, death entered the world and they who are in his possession experience it.\" (Wisdom 2:24) Satan is implicitly identified, in the New Testament, with the serpent in Eden, in Revelation 12:9: \"This great dragon — the ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, the one deceiving the whole world — was thrown down to the earth with all his angels.\"\n\nChristian teaching about the Satan (Hebrew , \"Adversary\"), to whom God proposes his servant Job is that he appears in the heavenly court to challenge Job, with God's permission. This is one of two Old Testament passages, along with Zechariah 3, where Hebrew \"ha-Satan\" (the Adversary) becomes Greek \"ho diabolos\" (the Slanderer) in the Greek Septuagint used by the early Christian church.\n\nChristian teaching about the involvement of Satan in David's census varies, just as the pre-exilic account of 2 Samuel and the later account of 1 Chronicles present differing perspectives:\n\nZechariah's vision of recently deceased Joshua the High Priest depicts a dispute in the heavenly throne room between Satan and the Angel of the Lord (). Goulder (1998) views the vision as related to opposition from Sanballat the Horonite.\n\nSince the time of Origen and Jerome, some Christian concepts of the devil have included the in Isaiah 14:12, which is translated Lucifer (\"Morning Star\" as a noun, \"light-bringing\" as an adjective) in the Latin Vulgate, and transferred directly from Latin into the King James Version as a name \"Lucifer\" When the Bible was translated into Latin (the Vulgate), the name Lucifer appeared as a translation of \"Morning Star\", or the planet Venus, in Isaiah 14:12. Isaiah 14:1-23 is a passage concerned with the plight of Babylon, and its king is referred, in sarcastic and hyperbolic language to as \"morning star, son of the dawn\". This is because the Babylonian king was considered to be of godly status and of symbolic divine parentage (Bel and Ishtar, associated with the planet Venus).\n\nWhile this information is available to scholars today via translated Babylonian cuneiform text taken from clay tablets, it was not as readily available at the time of the Latin translation of the Bible. At some point the reference to \"Lucifer\" was interpreted as a reference to the moment Satan was thrown from Heaven. And despite the clarity of the chapter as a whole, the 12th verse continues to be put forth as proof that Lucifer was the name of Satan before the fall. Thus Lucifer became another name for Satan and has remained so, owing to popular tradition.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible word for the morning star, which was later translated to \"Lucifer\" in English, is הילל (transliterated HYLL), meaning \"morning star\". Although this word, \"Heilel\", has come to be translated as \"morning-star\" from the Septuagint's translation of the Scriptures, the letter ה in Hebrew often indicates singularity, much as the English \"the,\" in which case the translation would be ה \"the\" ילל \"yell,\" or \"the wailing yell.\"\n\nLater, for unknown reasons, Christian demonologists appeared to designate \"Satan\", \"Lucifer\", and \"Beelzebub\" as different entities, each with a different rank in the demonic hierarchy. One hypothesis is that this might have been an attempt to establish a demonic trinity with the same person, akin to the Christian Trinity of Father, Son and the Holy Spirit, but most demonologists do not carry this view.\n\nThe cherub in Eden is a figure mentioned in , identified with the King of Tyre, specifically Ithobaal III (reigned 591–573 BCE) who according to Josephus' list of kings of Tyre was reigning contemporary with Ezekiel at the time of the first fall of Jerusalem. Christianity has traditionally linked the reference to the fall of Satan.\n\n\nThe devil figures much more prominently in the New Testament and in Christian theology than in the Old Testament and Judaism. The New Testament records numerous accounts of the devil working against God and his plan. The Temptation of Christ features the devil, and is described in all three synoptic gospels, (, , and ), although in Mark's gospel he is called Satan. In all three synoptic gospels, (, , and ), Jesus' critics accuse him of gaining his power to cast out demons from Beelzebub, the chief demon (often identified with Satan in mainstream Christendom). In response, Jesus says that a house divided against itself will fall, so, logically speaking, why would the devil allow one to defeat the devil's works with his own power?\n\nThe New Testament includes numerous instances of demonic possession. Satan himself is said to have entered Judas Iscariot before Judas's betrayal. () Jesus encounters those who are possessed and casts out the evil spirit(s). A person may have one demon or multiple demons inhabiting their body. Jesus encountered a man filled with numerous demons in Mark 5:1-20.\n\nThe Epistle of Jude makes reference to an incident where the Archangel Michael argued with the devil over the body of Moses. According to the First Epistle of Peter, \"Like a roaring lion your adversary the devil prowls around, looking for someone to devour.\"\n\nAccording to most Christian eschatology, Satan will wage a final war against Jesus, before being cast into Hell for \"aeonios\". A few early Church Fathers are known to have prayed for Satan's eventual repentance but it was not generally believed that this would happen. On the other hand, Dispensationalists teach that Jesus returns to earth before the Great Tribulation to reclaim the righteous, dead and living, to meet him in the air (known as the Rapture. Many Fundamentalists believe that immediately following this, the Tribulational period will occur as prophesied in the book of Daniel, while others (especially Seventh-day Adventists) believe that immediately following Jesus' Second Coming, Satan will be bound on this Earth for a thousand years, after which he will be \"loosed for a little season\"\n–this is when the battle of Armageddon (the final confrontation between good and evil) will be waged–and Satan and his followers will be destroyed once and for all, the Earth will be cleansed of all evil and there will be \"a new Heaven and a new Earth\" where sin will reign no more.\n\nParticularly in the medieval period, Satan was often shown as having horns and a goat's hindquarters (though occasionally with the legs of a chicken or a mule), and with a tail. He was also depicted as carrying a pitchfork, the implement used in Hell to torment the damned, or a trident, deriving from the regalia of the sea-god Poseidon. Occasionally more imaginative depictions were illustrated: Sometimes the Devil was depicted as having faces all over his body, as in the painting of a Deal with the Devil. Depictions of the Devil covered in boils and scars, animal-like hair, and monstrous deformities were also common. None of these images seem to be based on biblical materials, as Satan's physical appearance is never described in the Bible or any other religious text. Rather, this image is apparently based on pagan Horned Gods, such as Pan, Cernunnos, Molek, Selene and Dionysus, common to many pagan religions. Pan in particular looks very much like the images of the medieval Satan. These images later became the basis for Baphomet, which is portrayed in Eliphas Levi's 1854 \"Dogme et rituel de la haute magie\" (English translation Transcendental Magic, its Doctrine and Ritual). Even some Satanists use Baphomet as the image of Satan in Satanic worship. It has been alleged that this image was chosen specifically to discredit the Horned God.\n\nWhat is known of the Cathars largely comes in what is preserved by the critics in the Catholic Church which later destroyed them in the Albigensian Crusade. Alain de Lille, c.1195, accused the Cathars of believing in two gods - one of light, one of darkness. Durand de Huesca, responding to a Cathar tract c.1220 indicates that they regarded the physical world as the creation of Satan. A former Italian Cathar turned Dominican, Sacchoni in 1250 testified to the Inquisition that his former co-religionists believed that the devil made the world and everything in it.\n\nLuther taught the traditional personal devil. Among his teachings was a recommendation of music since \"the devil cannot stand gaiety.\"\nCalvin taught the traditional view of the devil as a fallen angel. Calvin repeats the simile of Saint Augustine: \"Man is like a horse, with either God or the devil as rider.\" In interrogation of Servetus who had said that all creation was part of God, Calvin asked what of the devil? Servetus responded \"all things are a part and portion of God\".\n\nDavid Joris was the first of the Anabaptists to venture that the devil was only an allegory (c.1540), his view found a small but persistent following in the Netherlands. The view was transmitted to England and Joris's booklet was reprinted anonymously in English in 1616, prefiguring a spate of non-literal devil interpretations in the 1640s-1660s: Mede, Bauthumley, Hobbes, Muggleton and the private writings of Isaac Newton. In Germany such ideas surfaced later, c.1700, among writers such as Balthasar Bekker and Christian Thomasius.\n\nHowever the above views remained very much a minority. Daniel Defoe in his \"The Political History of the Devil\" (1726) describes such views as a form of \"practical atheism\". Defoe wrote \"that to believe the existence of a God is a debt to nature, and to believe the existence of the Devil is a like debt to reason\".\n\nUntil John Milton created the character of Satan for his \"Paradise Lost\", the different attributes of Satan were usually ascribed to different entities. The angel who rebelled in Heaven was not the same as the ruler in Hell. The ruler of Hell was often seen as a sort of jailer who never fell from grace. The tempting serpent of Genesis was just a serpent. Milton combined the different parts of the character to show his fall from near-divine beauty and grace to his eventual skulking role as a jealous tempter. He was so successful in his characterization of Satan as a romantic hero who \"would rather rule in Hell than serve in Heaven\" that his version of Satan has displaced all others.\n\nRudolf Bultmann taught that Christians need to reject belief in a literal devil as part of first century culture. This line is developed by Walter Wink.\n\nAgainst this come the works of writers like Jeffrey Burton Russell, a believer in a literal personal fallen being of some kind. In \"Lucifer, the Devil in the Middle Ages\", the third volume of his five volume history of the devil, Russell argues that such theologians [as Bultmann, unnamed] are missing that the devil is part and parcel of the New Testament from its origins.\n\nA number of prayers and practices against the devil exist within the Roman Catholic tradition. The Lord's Prayer includes a petition for being delivered from evil, but a number of other specific prayers also exist.\n\nThe Prayer to Saint Michael specifically asks for Catholics to be defended \"against the wickedness and snares of the devil.\"\nGiven that some of the Our Lady of Fatima messages have been linked by the Holy See to the \"\"end times\", some Catholic authors have concluded that the angel referred to within the Fatima messages is St. Michael the Archangel who defeats the devil in the War in Heaven. Author Timothy Robertson takes the position that the Consecration of Russia was a step in the eventual defeat of Satan by the Archangel Michael.\n\nThe process of exorcism is used within the Catholic Church against the devil. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that: \"Jesus performed exorcisms and from him the Church has received the power and office of exorcizing\"\".\n\nThe Catholic Church views the battle against the devil as ongoing. During a May 24, 1987 visit to the Sanctuary of Saint Michael the Archangel, Pope John Paul II said:\n\"The battle against the devil, which is the principal task of Saint Michael the archangel, is still being fought today, because the devil is still alive and active in the world. The evil that surrounds us today, the disorders that plague our society, man's inconsistency and brokenness, are not only the results of original sin, but also the result of Satan's pervasive and dark action.\"\nPope Paul VI expressed concern about the influence of the devil and in 1972 stated that: \"Satan's smoke has made its way into the Temple of God through some crack\". However, Pope John Paul II viewed the defeat of Satan as inevitable.\n\nFather Gabriele Amorth, the chief exorcist of the Diocese of Rome, warned about ignoring Satan, saying, \"Whoever denies Satan also denies sin and no longer understands the actions of Christ\".\n\nThe \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\" states that the Church regards the devil as being created as a good angel by God, and by his and his fellow fallen angels choice fell out of God's grace.\n\nSatan is not an infinitely powerful being. Although he was an angel, and thus pure spirit, he is considered a creature nonetheless. Satan's actions are permitted by divine providence. 395\n\nIn Eastern Orthodox Christianity, Satan is one of humanity's three enemies, along with sin and death (in some other forms of Christianity the other two enemies of mankind are \"the world\", and self (or the flesh), which is to be taken as man's natural tendency to sin).\n\nEvangelicals agree with the Protestant orthodox of theology that Satan is a real, created being given entirely over to evil and that evil is whatever opposes God or is not willed by God. Evangelicals emphasize the power and involvement of Satan in history in varying degrees; some virtually ignore Satan and others revel in speculation about spiritual warfare against that personal power of darkness.\nThe literal existence of the Devil is referred to in the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion.\n\nSome Christian groups and individuals view the devil in Christianity figuratively. They see the devil in the Bible as representing human sin and temptation, and any human system in opposition to God. Early Bible fundamentalist Unitarians and Dissenters like Nathaniel Lardner, Richard Mead, Hugh Farmer, William Ashdowne and John Simpson, and John Epps taught that the miraculous healings of the Bible were real, but that the devil was an allegory, and demons just the medical language of the day. Simpson in his \"Sermons\" (publ. posthumously 1816) went so far as to comment that the devil was \"really not that bad\", a view essentially echoed as recently as 2001 by Gregory Boyd in \"Satan and the Problem of Evil: Constructing a Trinitarian Warfare Theodicy\". Such views today are taught today by Christadelphians and the Church of the Blessed Hope.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses believe that Satan was originally a perfect angel who developed feelings of self-importance and craved worship that belonged to God. Satan persuaded Adam and Eve to obey him rather than God, raising the issue—often referred to as a \"controversy\"—of whether people, having been granted free will, would obey God under both temptation and persecution. The issue is said to be whether God can rightfully claim to be sovereign of the universe. Instead of destroying Satan, God decided to test the loyalty of the rest of humankind and to prove to the rest of creation that Satan was a liar. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Satan is God's chief adversary and the invisible ruler of the world. They believe that demons were originally angels who rebelled against God and took Satan's side in the controversy.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses do not believe that Satan lives in Hell or that he has been given responsibility to punish the wicked. Satan and his demons are said to have been cast down from heaven to the earth in 1914, marking the beginning of the \"last days\". Witnesses believe that Satan and his demons influence individuals, organizations and nations, and that they are the cause of human suffering. At Armageddon, Satan is to be bound for 1,000 years, and then given a brief opportunity to mislead perfect humanity before being destroyed.\n\nIn Mormonism, the Devil is a real being, a literal spirit son of God who once had angelic authority, but rebelled and fell prior to the creation of the Earth in a premortal life. At that time, he persuaded a third part of the spirit children of God to rebel with him. This was in opposition to the plan of salvation championed by Jehovah (Jesus Christ). Now the devil tries to persuade mankind into doing evil. Mankind can overcome this through faith in Jesus Christ and obedience to the Gospel. \n\nThe Latter-day Saints traditionally regard Lucifer as the pre-mortal name of the devil. Mormon theology teaches that in a heavenly council, Lucifer rebelled against the plan of God the Father and was subsequently cast out. Mormon scripture reads:\"And this we saw also, and bear record, that an angel of God who was in authority in the presence of God, who rebelled against the Only Begotten Son whom the Father loved and who was in the bosom of the Father, was thrust down from the presence of God and the Son, and was called Perdition, for the heavens wept over him—he was Lucifer, a son of the morning. And we beheld, and lo, he is fallen! is fallen, even a son of the morning! And while we were yet in the Spirit, the Lord commanded us that we should write the vision; for we beheld Satan, that old serpent, even the devil, who rebelled against God, and sought to take the kingdom of our God and his Christ—Wherefore, he maketh war with the saints of God, and encompasseth them round about.\"After becoming Satan by his fall, Lucifer \"goeth up and down, to and fro in the earth, seeking to destroy the souls of men\". Mormons consider Isaiah 14:12 to be referring to both the king of the Babylonians and the devil.\n\nThe Unification Church teaches that Satan will be restored in the last days and become a good angel again.\n\nTeachings about the Devil vary, depending on the local folklore. Still, the characteristics present in the Bible are present in most depictions.\n\nAccording to the gospels of Matthew (chapter 4), Mark (chapter 1), and Luke (chapter 4), the devil tempted Jesus at the beginning of his ministry. After Jesus fasted forty days and forty nights in the wilderness, the devil approached Jesus with offers of stones turned to bread, rulership over the kingdoms of the Earth (but with subservience to the Devil himself), and spectacular protection from physical harm. Satan uses the Scripture of the Old Testament to solidify his arguments. This would indicate Satan's full knowledge of all of Scripture and a use of that knowledge to tempt and deceive man (Mat 4). Jesus refused all three temptations, rebuking Satan with his own knowledge of Scripture (Mat 4).\n\nChristianity holds several different views on Christ's role in defeating Satan. Some emphasize Christ's death and resurrection as sealing Satan's fate, so that the devil is already defeated though not banished. Others emphasize the devil's final judgment when Christ returns, at which time the terror and deceit of Satan will have no more effect on the world. This is because mankind will face final judgment and the earth will be purged or cleansed with fire. Satan will be bound to the lake of fire (Rev 20) with the Beast, the false prophet and all those whose names are not in the Book of Life.\n\nThe devil and his demons are portrayed as able to possess and control humans. The Roman Catholic Church occasionally performs exorcisms, usually only after medical and psychological evaluations have taken place to rule out a mental or physical ailment.\n\nThe Devil has been described as granting magical powers to sorcerers and witches, usually in exchange for worship or souls. In Acts of the Apostles 16:16 Paul the Apostle meets 'a slave girl who had an evil spirit that enabled her to predict the future'. He performs an exorcism using the name of Jesus Christ.\n\nChristian tradition differs from that of Christian demonology in that \"Satan\", \"Lucifer\", \"Samael\" and \"Beelzebub\" all are names that refer to \"the devil\", and \"Prince of this World\", \"The Beast\" and \"Dragon\" (and rarely \"Serpent\" or \"The Old Serpent\") used to be elliptic forms to refer to him. \"The Enemy\", \"The Evil One\" and \"The Tempter\" are other elliptic forms to name the Devil. \"Belial\" is held by many to be another name for the devil. Christian demonology, in contrast, does not have several nicknames for Satan.\n\nThe name \"Mephistopheles\" is used by some people to refer to the Devil, but it is a mere folkloric custom, and has nothing to do with Christian demonology and Christian tradition. \"Prince of Darkness\" and \"Lord of Darkness\" are also folkloric names, although they tend to be incorporated to Christian tradition.\n\nIn English, the devil has a number of epithets, including Old Scratch and Old Nick.\n\nThe Bible states that Satan roams Heaven and Earth. It also states that Satan appeared with other angels \"before the Lord,\" presumably in heaven. When God asked Satan where he had been, Satan replied, \"From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it\". declares, \"Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour\". The only point in the Bible where Satan is in Hell is at the end of the Book of Revelation, where he is thrown into Hell to face his eternal punishment along with the beast. As demonstrated by Dante, Milton, and several other writings, the Devil is commonly thought to be in Hell.\n\nSome theologians believe that angels cannot sin because sin brings death and angels cannot die, or because they are spiritual beings that are completely aware of God's will.\n\nSupporting the idea that an angel may sin, Thomas Aquinas, in his \"Summa Theologiae\", wrote:\n\"An angel or any other rational creature considered in his own nature, can sin; and to whatever creature it belongs not to sin, such creature has it as a gift of grace, and not from the condition of nature. The reason of this is, because \"sinning is nothing else than a deviation from that rectitude which an act ought to have\"; whether we speak of sin in nature, art, or morals. That act alone, the rule of which is the very virtue of the agent, can never fall short of rectitude. Were the craftsman's hand the rule itself engraving, he could not engrave the wood otherwise than rightly; but if the rightness of engraving be judged by another rule, then the engraving may be right or faulty.\" \n\n"}

The outbreak irregular emptying its waters and unexpected, accompanied by the noise that precedes underground filling, had to be at that time matter of respect and adoration. Possibly they were used as baths, laundry and omen. It has been also suggested that the fountain could be dedicated to a god of the waters, where predictions were made based on their irregular filling and emptying cycle. In the thirteenth century it was built beside a hermitage devoted to John the Baptist, to Christianize the place and delete all relations with pagan rites.\n\nStudies of the naturalist and geographer Pliny the Elder on the lands occupied by the Roman Empire are crucial for knowledge and location of Tamaric Fountains.

In the autumn of 1904, the Riga Committee of the Latvian Social Democratic Workers Party and the Riga Committee of the Bund signed a co-operation agreement and founded the Riga Federative Committee. The main liaisons were the engineer Jānis Ozols (\"Zars\") and the railwayman Samuel Klevansky (\"Maksim\"). Bund was active during the 1905 Russian revolution, organizing demonstrations and fighting units.\n\nThe first Bundist activities in independent Latvia began with a congress of members of \"Unzer Tsayt\" in Riga in December 1918, soon after Riga was conquered by Soviet Russia. After the conclusion of Latvian War of Independence, in the fall of 1920 a Central Bureau of the Latvian Bund was constituted. The Latvian Bund became an autonomous organization affiliated with the Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party. The Bund had one seat in the Central Committee of the Latvian Social Democratic Workers Party. The Bund, as well as other left-wing groups in Latvia after the Latvian War of Independence, was under suspicion as Communist supporters. On June 20, 1921 the president of the party Abraham Braun \"Sergei\" (1881-1940) was sentenced to death by a military tribunal for spreading Communist propaganda but released after international socialist outcry over the sentence.\n\nThe relations among Jewish socialists and with the rest of the socialist movement were far better than in Poland; during elections of 1918 two Bundists were elected, then four at the Riga municipal council election in 1919, on a common list of the Social Democratic bloc, which gained 36 of the 96 seats.\n\nThe party published the biweekly \"Di naye tsayt\" for seven years. According to Daniel Blatman, there were 500 active members of the Latvian Bund in 1934.\n\nAs pointed out by Frank Gordon, \"Between the two world wars Latvia was the only country where the Bund had a parliamentary representative of its own.\"., and Bind was only one of a few Jewish parties represented in the 1st Saeima, 2nd Saeima, 3rd Saeima and 4th Saeima.\n\nItzhak Berss (Īzaks Berss), father of Lipman Bers, represented the interests of the Bund in the Constitutional Assembly of Latvia, elected in April 1920. He was later the director of Riga Jewish gymnasium where Yiddish was the language of education. From 1922 until 1934 he was Riga City councilman. He was removed from office after the 1934 Latvian coup d'état on the grounds of \"political unreliability\". On June 14, 1941 he was arrested and deported by Soviets to Siberia from where he was released only in 1956.\n\nDr. Noah Meisel, Daugavpils city council member, was subsequently elected for the Bund in the 1st Saeima in 1922, and again in 1925 and 1928, but was not reelected in 1931. He was arrested and deported by the Soviet authorities after the Soviet invasion and annexation of Latvia in 1940 and died in exile in far Northern Russia in 1956.\n\nAccording to Valdis Lumans, \"the leftist Bund more often than not sided with Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party more than with the Jewish bloc\" (comprising Agudath Israel, the Zionists and the Jewish National Democratic Party).\n\nAfter World War I, the Latvian Bund sent a representative, Raphael Abramovitch, to the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Menshevik) delegation at the founding Vienna conference of the International Working Union of Socialist Parties in 1921, where he was particularly active in association with the Menshevik leader Julius Martov. He \"emerged as one of the recognized leaders of the Vienna Union\".\n\nIn 1920 Jewish communists also formed the illegal underground battle organisation \"Kamp Bund\" (The Bund of Struggle), which functioned as the Jewish section of the banned Communist Party of Latvia. Its leading members included Mark Donskoy, Iosif Lensky and Abraham Gurevich.\n"}

The newspaper's slogan is \"Torah-world's newsletter\". The newspaper is published daily except on the Jewish Sabbath. On weekends the newspaper comes out in an enlarged free edition. \"Hapeles\" was founded by leading Rabbinical authorities of our times in order to fairly represent the Torah view on different subjects.\n\n\"Hapeles\" is a continuation of the ideology underlying line adopted by the founders of the newspaper \"Yated Ne'eman\". \"Yated Ne'eman\" was part of a broad initiative to create communal organizations to serve the Lithuanian Torah community. \"Yated Ne'eman\" rejected secular life and displayed an ambivalent attitude towards the State of Israel and Zionism. They recognized them as a de facto political entity, but denied that Zionism was the destiny of the Jewish people. Instead the newspaper emphasized pious observance of the mitzvot of the Torah and Jewish law.\n\nIn 2012 the paper was taken over by more moderate ultra-Orthodox elements. The CEO, the editor-in-chief and some of its guiding rabbinical board members (the \"spiritual committee\"), who were considered to represent the more strict ideological line, were fired during the changes. \"Hapeles\" was created to continue the original direction of \"Yated Ne'eman\". The dismissed CEO and chief editor were appointed to those positions on the new paper.\n\nHapeles leads an extensive campaign against recruitment of haredim to Israel Defense Forces. As a result, it faced criticism from the Israeli government, including Minister of Defense Avigdor Lieberman.\n\nIn April 2017, \"Hapeles\" editors were arrested and all the computers in the newspaper's HQ were confiscated. The charge was illegal efforts to get large companies in Israel to advertise in the newspaper. However, the newspaper claimed that the charges against it were a government persecution, due to his activity against the recruitment of Haredim. The claims relied on controversial quotations of Eli Ben-Dahan, Israeli deputy minister of defence and Roni Alsheikh, the chief of Israeli police.\n"}

According to 2011 Census of England and Wales, 817,000 residents (1.5%) identified themselves as Hindus.Hindus were the fourth largest religious group in the 2011 Census of the United Kingdom, after Christianity (59%), No Religion (25%), and Islam (5%). Among those of South Asian origins, Hindus in the United Kingdom (27%) constituted the second largest group after South Asian Muslims (57%), and exceeded South Asian Sikhs (14%) in the 2011 census of the United Kingdom.\n\nThere were 101 Hindu temples in the United Kingdom in 2001, compared to 614 Muslim mosques and 193 Sikh temples in 2001.\n\nThe British Hindu population includes those who came directly from the Indian sub-continent, descendants of those Hindus who had originally migrated to other countries but later resettled in the United Kingdom, and those born and raised in the UK. It is not unusual to find third or fourth generation Hindus in the UK.\n\nThere have been three main waves of migration of Hindus in the UK, and most of the Hindu migration has occurred after World War II. The first wave was at the time of British India's independence and partition in 1947. Also, in the early 1960s the Conservative Health Minister the Rt Hon Enoch Powell recruited a large number of doctors from the Indian sub-continent. The second wave occurred in the 1970s mainly from East Africa especially due to the expulsion of Asians from Uganda. Later, communities included those from Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Mauritius and Fiji. The last wave of migration began in the 1990s and is a result of the United Kingdom's immigration policy, which made studying and immigration to the UK easier. This wave also included Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka and professionals including doctors and software engineers from India.\nIn terms of relative numbers of South Asian descendants in England and Wales, Hindu population of 806,000 is the second largest group, after 1,628,000 South Asian Muslims according to the 2011 census. This reflects a growth over the 1991 census, when its Hindu population was 397,000 compared to 703,000 South Asian Muslims and 206,000 South Asian Sikhs in the England and Wales.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, nearly half of the 817,000 Hindus living in the UK were residents of the London metropolitan area. About 300,000 British Hindus of all ages were born in the UK.\n\nThe Hindu population in the UK is predominantly urban, and has relatively higher representation in the professional and managerial positions. Hindu men are more likely than the general population to be entrepreneurs, and both Hindu men and women are more likely than the general population to have higher education. According to United Kingdom's Office of National Statistics, of all ethnic minorities in Britain, the British Hindus had the highest rate of economic activity in 2011, and a median net wealth of in 2006 (compared to median net wealth of for British Christians). Over a 20-year period, British Hindus also had the third lowest poverty level (after British Christian and British Jews), and the second lowest rates of arrest, trial or imprisonment at 0.5% (after British Jews' 0.3%) among all ethnic groups tracked by UK's Ministry of Justice.\n\nA University of Derby report states that there are considerable linguistic and theosophical diversities among Hindus in the United Kingdom, yet they also share certain core beliefs, rites and festivals of Hinduism. The National Council of Hindu Temples and the Hindu Council of the UK are among national umbrella organisations for Hindus in the UK. There are regional organizations that organize community events and social affairs in the UK, such as The Hindu Council of Birmingham.\n\nUK-wide Hindu organisations include the National Council of Hindu Temples UK which is the oldest UK-wide Hindu organisation. It comprises over 300 Hindu Temples and Hindu Faith Organisations. The Hindu Council UK representing almost 400 affiliated cultural and religious organisations of various Hindu denominations including temples, and The Hindu Forum of Britain, with nearly 300 member organisations.\n\nThere were over 150 Hindu Temples in the UK in 2012 with 30 Temples in the London area alone. Slough Hindu Temple was built by the Slough Hindu Cultural Society - formally opened in 1981 - it was the first purpose-built Hindu Temple in the British Isles. However, the first Hindu Temple in the UK was opened in the late 1920s near Earls Court in London and it was functional for about four years.\n\nThere is a diversity of Hindu-based organisations in the UK including the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), Swaminarayan (BAPS) in Neasden (Greater London), the Chinmaya Mission, Ramakrishna Mission and Sai Organisation, each having large followings. SHYAM, an educational Hindu organisation teaches the Bhagavad Gita, Ramayana, Shrimad Bhagavad, Vedas and Upanishads. The predominant Hindu beliefs found in the UK include its Vedanta monist, Vedanta monotheistic and various sampradayas. Less of 1% of the Hindus in the UK identify themselves to be belonging to Divine Life Society, Hare Krishna and other organizations.\n\nHindus in the United Kingdom celebrate major festivals such as Diwali. Homes and businesses are decorated with festive lights and Hindus gift sweets such as laddoo and barfi. Community events such as dances and parties bring Hindus and non-Hindus together. Leicester annually plays hosts to one of the biggest Diwali celebrations outside of India.\n\nThe Hindu festival of Diwali has begun to find acceptance into the larger British community. Prince Charles has attended Diwali celebrations at some of UK’s prominent Hindu temples, such as the Swaminarayan Temple in Neasden. In 2013, Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife joined thousands at the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Neasden to celebrate Diwali and the Annakut festival marking the Hindu New Year. Since 2009, Diwali has been celebrated every year at 10 Downing Street, the residence of the British Prime Minister.\n\nHindu Council UK (HCUK) is an umbrella organisation for all Hindus living in the United Kingdom, formed in 1994. The Hindu Council UK represents all the Hindu faith denominations, various Hindu communities and Hindus from different parts of the world settled in the United Kingdom.\n\nAbout 95.6% of the Hindus in Britain have asian ethnicity,the rest 4.4% are mostly converts-White 1.47%, Mixed 1.19% ,Black 0.67% and others 1%(including 0.13% arab).\n\nFamous Converts to Hinduism include:\n\nA report authored by Robert Berkeley of Runnymede Trust states that the Hindu community groups and organizations in the United Kingdom face systematic disadvantage and discrimination. They face a legacy of inequality, targeting and stereotyping in daily life and by the media, which has left the Hindu community isolated, with a limited capacity to engage with other communities, or address the problems they face.\n\nScholars state that the Hindu community in the United Kingdom, and Europe in general, has faced discrimination in immigration policies adopted by the local governments. In local councils, construction or expansion permits for Hindu temples and community centers have been turned down for years, while Muslim mosques and Christian churches have been approved by the same councils and built. The discrimination suffered by Hindu communities from the local council officials in Britain has been described by Paul Weller as follows,\n\nNearly 50% of Hindu children, both boys and girls, in British schools have reported to being victims of bullying for being Hindu and their religious heritage. However, Claire Monks et al. note that children of various races and religions report being victims of bullying in British schools as well.\n\nThe Hindu community in the United Kingdom is not unique in suffering discrimination and stereotyping. The similarly small Jewish community of the United Kingdom, and in recent years the much larger Muslim community of the United Kingdom, has also expressed similar concerns. New legislation and institutions to understand and respond to religious discrimination are being debated by British politicians.\n\nPrivate golfing, country clubs and other social clubs in Britain have routinely discriminated against and denied entry to Hindus – in addition to Sikhs, Muslims, women, Africans and other minorities after asserting \"freedom of association\" principle, and parts of EU-wide law to limit this practice were adopted in the United Kingdom in 1998. In some instances of Islamist terrorism, such as after the 7 July 2005 London bombings, Hindus along with Sikhs of the United Kingdom became more targeted and vulnerable for backlash than Muslims.\n\nIn October 2018, it was reported that Conservative Party (UK) London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey had written a pamphlet, entitled \"No Man’s Land\", for the Centre for Policy Studies. In it, Bailey argued that accommodating Hindus \"[robs] Britain of its community\" and is turning the country into a \"crime riddled cess pool\". He also claimed that South Asians \"bring their culture, their country and any problems they might have, with them\" and that this was not a problem within the black community \"because we’ve shared a religion and in many cases a language\". In the pamphlet, Bailey had confused the Hindu religion and the Hindi language: \"You don’t know what to do. You bring your children to school and they learn far more about Diwali than Christmas. I speak to the people who are from Brent and they’ve been having Hindi days off.\" The Conservative Party Deputy Chairman, James Cleverly, defended Bailey and insisted he was misunderstood, and that he was implying black boys were drifting into crime as a result of learning more about Hinduism rather than \"their own Christian culture\". However, the anti-racism Hope Not Hate campaign group called Bailey's comments \"grotesque\". The comments were condemned by the Hindu Council of the United Kingdom who expressed \"disappointment at the misrepresentation of our faith\" by Bailey. \n\n"}

{"id": "19437930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19437930", "title": "Iaal", "text": "Iaal\n\nIaal (, also spelt as Ī`āl, Iäal, Izal or I’aal) is a village in northern Lebanon.\n\nIaal is located approximately south-east of Tripoli, from Beirut and from Zgharta. It is situated within the Zgharta District of the North Governorate of Lebanon. Iaal lies at the foot of the Mount Lebanon range and has a road that runs up into the mountains (parallel to Wadi Iaal) passing through its borders. Neighbouring and nearby communities include Jdaydeh, Kfaryachit, Khaldieh, Morh Kfarsghab and Sakhra. Iaal is one of only five Sunni towns in the Zgharta District and is the southernmost entirely Sunni Muslim settlement in the whole North Governorate of Lebanon.\n\nThe most identifiable building in Iaal is the castle/fort built on the hilltop of the village centre: the Fortress of Iaal It was built in 1816 by Mustafa Agha Barbar (the Ottoman governor of Tripoli from 1798) because the area was considered strategic thanks to its panoramic views, which extend all the way down to the Mediterranean coast. The other identifiable building in Iaal is the mosque along the road that runs up into the mountains called Masjid al-Taqwa (Arabic for \"Mosque of Piety\"), built in 1994. There is a second mosque located within the confines of the castle.\n\nIt appears that Iaal was inhabited prior to the arrival of Barbar, as evidenced by a census conducted by the Ottomans in 1555 showing that there were 34 males in the village at that time (females were excluded from the census). However, who these villagers were and where they originated from is unknown. What can be presumably safely deduced is that the modern descendants from Iaal are a product of Barbar, those serving him and those who were counted in the 1555 census. Based upon the 1555 census alone, there should be more than the few thousand people currently claiming an origin from Iaal, i.e. if the population was able to grow without the interference of many unnatural deaths (e.g. killings) and/or significant migration and subsequent loss of identity.\n\nThe land of Iaal is watered by Iaal Dam and its outflow of Wadi Iaal. This makes it fertile, sustaining a variety of produce and grazing animals, and has resulted in making Iaal famous for its olive tree gardens.\n\nIaal’s climate is typical of a Mediterranean plain village: with heavy rains, mild winters and hot, dry, arid summers. Its annual rainfall is . Its average monthly temperatures are shown below:\n\nIts inhabitants are entirely Sunni Muslim and number about 1,000 people (although precise figures are unattainable). In 1988 Iaal had a total population of 903, and in 1998 its population increased by almost 20% to 1,082 people. However, these figures relate to all registered citizens originating from the village, including both residents in Lebanon and those who emigrated abroad. The people of Iaal are also all related to one another through common ancestors. The majority of people who trace their ancestry to the village actually live outside of Iaal. The overwhelming majority of these immigrants and their descendants live in Australia, primarily Sydney, in the local government areas of the Municipality of Kogarah (where they operate a mosque in the suburb of South Hurstville) and the City of Liverpool. This diaspora community also runs the Iaal Charitable Association Inc. During the late 19th and early 20th century, most people from Iaal (at the time) emigrated to Latin America; however, these emigrants fully assimilated into their new environments and lost all connections with their homeland.\n\nSome common surnames of people from Iaal include Affouf, Al-Choukairy, Al-Hage, Ardati, Ayyoub, Dennaoui, Diab, Dib, Elmir, Habib, Hadid, Halbouni, Hammoud, Hussein, Ibrahim, Issa, Jameel, Khidr, Mahrees, Merhi, Nasreddine, Nasser, Shehaddy, Subkhi and Taleb.\n\nSome notable people born in or descending from Iaal include:\n\n"}

It is based on devotion to him as one guru as a means to salvation. Its adherents are from many religious backgrounds as Kabir never advocated change of religions but highlighted their limitations.\n\nKabir Panthis can follow the ethical and social customs of the day according to tradition without hindrance. Lay persons can be cremated according to Hindu law and priests can be buried or cremated depending upon which tradition one wishes to follow . In the Caribbean and across North America, Kabir Panthis may opt for burning or burial.\nModern Kabir Panthis do not seem to be different from orthodox Vaishanavites; they worship the idol of Kabir, wear sacred thread and sandalwood paste.\n\nKabir Panthis observe sanctity and purity in their daily lives and behavior. The foundation of their belief and practice is Dharma, or \"the natural Law of life\", Satya, or \"The primordial and eternal truth\", Ahimsa, or \"Non-violence towards all beings through word and deed\", Bhakti, or \"Devotional love for god and a higher spiritual reality\", Sraddha, or \"Faith and unswerving loyalty\", Asteya, or \"Neither hoarding nor coveting\", Kshama, or \"Forgiveness and patience\", Daya, or \"Compassion, mercy, and conquering feelings of cruelty and insensitivity towards all beings\", Shaucha or \"Purity in body, mind and speech\", Aparigraha, or \"Limiting possessions to what is necessary and being non-materialistic\", Anekantvada, or \"Acceptance of different beliefs and the multiplicity of viewpoints\", Vishwa Bandhutva, or \"The universal brotherhood of all beings\" and Atma Gyan or \"The awareness of ones true self, which is no different from the one true reality which pervades in everyone, thus making everyone the one and only true reality\". These basic set of guidelines gives Kabir Panthis an all-encompassing formula for Love, Humility, Compassion and Unity. A Kabir Panthi lay person is called a Bhakta and priests are addressed with the honorific title of Mahant. Spiritual leaders are called Acharya or Guru. Monks who are more ascetic in nature, who do not marry and engage in more severe spiritual pursuits while never living in one place, constantly moving from monastery to monastery are called Brahmachari Sadhus, whereas those monks who do marry, have children and live a more relaxed spiritual life are \"Grihasta\" Sadhus. Similarly, women who have chosen to be Nuns are called Sadhvis. God is called by an infinite array of names but some of the more common names are \"Satya Purush\", \"Soham Sadguru\", \"Adi Guru\", \" Param Satyeshwar\", or simply \"Sadguru Kabir Saheb\". During their religious ceremonies Kabir Panthis sing the songs, \"bhajan\"s and \"Sakhi\"s of Kabir to the music of cymbals, drums and other Indian instruments. The Guru recites various prayers and Mantras, all of which remind devotees to remember God in all that they do.\n\nOne's mind and body must be kept pure by contemplation and avoiding gross and complicated behaviour. Such practice will allow one to attain salvation while living no matter what ones religion or other personal endeavour may be. A mark of initiation into the Kabir Panth is given in the form of a Kanthi Mala. It is a necklace made from the sacred Tulsi beads. It is also made out of holy Rudraksha beads and can also be made using yagyopaveet string with just one large Tulsi or Rudraksha bead. It is worn by choice and is typically given to one who has committed to avoiding lust, anger, greed, attachment to perishable things, and ego. Sahaja Yoga involves remembering God by repeating \"Satyanaam\". Kabir Panthis believe in simplicity of life; simple food, clothing and belongings. One should only acquire what is needed for sustenance. Kabir Panthis are strictly vegetarian and avoid the use of alcohol and tobacco.\n\nSeparate organizations have formed over the years. One of the largest groups of Kabir Panthis outside India is in Trinidad and Tobago: three smaller active groups exist in Guyana, Suriname and also in Canada. The Kabir Panth Association in Trinidad and Tobago operates two primary schools and was one of the first religious denominational schools founded in the region. Recently, other groups have been formed in Trinidad and Tobago [like Kabir Chaura Math, Satya Kabir Nidhi], each with their own emphasis on the teachings of Kabir Saheb and with their own affiliations in Trinidad and Tobago, Bhaarat and elsewhere in the World.\n\nThe most sacred books of the Kabir Panth sect are the Bijak, many passages from which are presented in the Guru Granth Sahib and the Anurag Sagar. In a blunt and uncompromising style, the Bijak exhorts its readers to shed their delusions, pretensions, and orthodoxies in favor of a direct experience of truth. It satirizes hypocrisy, greed, and violence, especially among the religious.\n\nThe Bijak includes three main sections (called \"Ramainī, Shabda\" and \"Sākhī\") and a fourth section containing miscellaneous folksongs. Most of Kabir's material has been popularized through the song form known as Shabda (or pada) and through the aphoristic two-line sākhī (or doha) that serves throughout north India as a vehicle for popular wisdom. In the Anurag Sagar, the story of creation is told to Dharamdas (one of Kabir's disciples), and the Maan Sarowar is another collection of teachings of Kabir from the Dharamdasi branch of the Kabir panth.\n\n\nThe centres of major branches of Kabir Panthis are the \n\n"}

The archaeological findings testifies the existence of two Jain temples and \"stupas\". Numerous Jain sculptures, \"Ayagapattas\" (tablet of homage), pillars, crossbeams and lintels were found during archaeological excavations.\nSome of the sculptures are provided with inscriptions that report on the contemporary society and organization of the Jain community. \n\nMost sculptures could be dated from the 2nd century BC to the 12th century CE, thus representing a continuous period of about 14 centuries during which Jainism flourished at Mathura. These sculptures are now housed in the Lucknow State Museum and in the Mathura Museum.\n\nAlexander Cunningham worked at the western end in March and November 1871. The objects found by Mr. Cunningham were all Jain, with the exception of one ten-armed Brahmanical figure.\nMr. Growse operated on the northern portion in 1875.

Mr. Harding, a predecessor of Mr. Growse as Magistrate of Mathura, also made some excavations.\nThe excavations at Kankali Tila acted as a testimony to the claims made by Jains regarding the great antiquity of their religion.\nThe sculptures and the inscriptions found at Kankali Tila suggest that in that period a clear Digambar-Shwetabar division had not risen. The Tirthankar images are all unclothed and monks are represented as not wearing a loincloth, but with cloth on one forearm. The names of divisions of the monastic orders match exactly with those given in the Shwetambar Kalpasutra.\n\n\n"}

Magicians are common figures in works of fantasy, such as fantasy literature and role-playing games, and enjoy a rich history in mythology, legends, fiction, and folklore.\n\nIn medieval chivalric romance, the wizard often appears as a wise old man and acts as a mentor, with Merlin from the King Arthur stories being a prime example. Wizards such as Gandalf in \"The Lord of the Rings\" and Albus Dumbledore from \"Harry Potter\" are also featured as mentors, and Merlin remains prominent as both an educative force and mentor in modern works of Arthuriana. Other magicians, such as Saruman, from \"The Lord of the Rings\" or Lord Voldemort from \"Harry Potter\" can appear as hostile villains. Villainous sorcerers were so crucial to pulp fantasy that the genre in which they appeared was dubbed \"sword and sorcery\".\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin's \"A Wizard of Earthsea\" explored the question of how wizards learned their art, introducing to modern fantasy the role of the wizard as protagonist. This theme has been further developed in modern fantasy, often leading to wizards as heroes on their own quests. Such heroes may have their own mentor, a wizard as well.\n\nWizards can be cast similarly to the absent-minded professor: being foolish and prone to misconjuring. They can also be capable of great magic, both good or evil. Even comical wizards are often capable of great feats, such as those of Miracle Max in \"The Princess Bride\"; although he is a washed-up wizard fired by the villain, he saves the dying hero. \n\nWizards are often depicted as old, white-haired, and with long white beards majestic enough to occasionally host lurking woodland creatures. This depiction predates the modern fantasy genre, being derived from the traditional image of wizards such as Merlin.\n\nIn the \"Dragonlance\" campaign setting of the \"Dungeons & Dragons\" role-playing game, wizards show their moral alignment by their robes.\n\nTerry Pratchett described robes as a magician's way of establishing to those they meet that they are capable of practicing magic.\n\nTo introduce conflict, writers of fantasy fiction often place limits on the magical abilities of wizards to prevent them from solving problems too easily. In Larry Niven's \"The Magic Goes Away\", once an area's mana is exhausted, no one can use magic. A common limit used in role-playing games is that a person can only cast a specific number of spells in a day.\n\nMagic can also require various sacrifices or the use of certain materials, such as gemstones, blood, or a live sacrifice. Even if the magician lacks scruples, obtaining the material may be difficult. A. K. Moonfire combines these limits in his book \"The Aubrey Stalking Portal\". The magician expends power to fuel his spells, but does not replenish that power naturally; therefore, he must make sacrifices to generate more magical power.\n\nThe extent of a wizard's knowledge is limited to which spells a wizard knows and can cast. Magic may also be limited by its danger; if a powerful spell can cause grave harm if miscast, wizards are likely to be wary of using it. Other forms of magic are limited by consequences that, while not inherently dangerous, are at least undesirable. In \"A Wizard of Earthsea\", every act of magic distorts the equilibrium of the world, which in turn has far-reaching consequences that can affect the entire world and everything in it. As a result, competent wizards do not use their magic frivolously. \n\nIn Terry Pratchett's \"Discworld\" series, the Law of Conservation of Reality is a principle imposed by forces wanting wizards to not destroy the world, and works to limit how much power it is humanly possible to wield. Whatever your means, the effort put into reaching the ends stays the same. For example, when the wizards of Unseen University are chasing the hapless wizard Rincewind in the forest of Skund, the wizards send out search teams to go and find him on foot. The archchancellor beats them to it by using a powerful spell from his own office, and while he gets there first by clever use of his spell, he has used no less effort than the others.\n\nPeople who work magic are called by several names in fantasy works, and terminology differs widely from one fantasy world to another. While derived from real-world vocabulary, the terms \"wizard\", \"witch\", \"warlock\", \"enchanter/enchantress\", \"sorcerer(ess)\", \"druid(ess)\", \"magician\", \"mage\", and \"magus\" have different meanings depending upon context and the story in question.\n\nThe term \"archmage\", is used in fantasy works as a title for a powerful magician or a leader of magicians.\n\nIn the \"Enchanted Forest Chronicles\", Patricia Wrede depicts wizards who use magic based on their staves and magicians who practice several kinds of magic, including wizard magic; in the \"Regency\" fantasies, she and Caroline Stevermer depict magicians as identical to wizards, though inferior in skill and training.\n\nSteve Pemberton's \"The Times & Life of Lucifer Jones\" describes the distinction thus: \"The difference between a wizard and a sorcerer is comparable to that between, say, a lion and a tiger, but wizards are acutely status-conscious, and to them, it's more like the difference between a lion and a dead kitten.\" In David Eddings's \"The Belgariad\" and \"The Malloreon\" series, several protagonists refer to their abilities powered by sheer will as \"sorcery\" and look down on the term \"magician\", which specifically refers to summoners of demonic agents.\n\nIn role-playing games, the types of magic-users are more delineated and are named so that the players and game masters can know which rules apply. Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson introduced the term \"magic-user\" in the original \"Dungeons & Dragons\" as a generic term for a practitioner of magic (in order to avoid the connotations of terms such as \"wizard\" or \"warlock\"); this lasted until the second edition of \"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\", where it was replaced with \"mage\" (later to become \"wizard\"). The exact rules vary from game to game. The wizard or mage, as a character class, is distinguished by the ability to cast certain kinds of magic but being weak in combat; subclasses are distinguished by strengths in some areas of magic and weakness in others. Sorcerers are distinguished from wizards as having an innate gift with magic, as well as having mystical or magical ancestry. Warlocks are distinguished from wizards as creating forbidden \"pacts\" with powerful creatures to harness their innate magical gifts.\n\n\"Enchanters\" often practice a type of magic that produces no physical effects on objects or people, but rather deceives the observer or target through the use of illusions. Enchantresses in particular practice this form of magic, often to seduce. For instance, the Lady of the Green Kirtle in C.S. Lewis's \"The Silver Chair\" enchants Rilian into forgetting his father and Narnia; when that enchantment is broken, she attempts further enchantments with a sweet-smelling smoke and a thrumming musical instrument to baffle him and his rescuers into forgetting them again.\n\nThe term \"sorcerer\" is more frequently used when the magician in question is evil. This may derive from its use in sword and sorcery, where the hero would be the sword-wielder, leaving the sorcery for his opponent.\n\n\"Witch\" also carries evil connotations. L. Frank Baum named Glinda the \"Good Witch of the South\" in \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\". In \"The Marvelous Land of Oz, \"he dubbed her \"Glinda the Good,\" and from that point forward and in subsequent books, Baum referred to her as a sorceress rather than a witch to avoid the term that was more regarded as evil.\n\n\"Wizard\" and \"warlock\" usually refer to a male, while \"witch\" usually refers to a female. In \"Witch World\", a man who anomalously showed the same abilities as a witch was called a warlock. The term \"warlock\" is sometimes used to indicate a male witch in fiction. However, either term may be used in a unisex manner, in which case there will be members of both sexes bearing that title. If both terms are used in the same setting, this can indicate a gender-based title for practitioners of identical magic, such as in \"Harry Potter\", or it can indicate that the two sexes practice different types of magic, as in \"Discworld\".\n\nA common motif in fiction is that the ability to use magic is innate and often rare, or gained through a large amount of study and practice. In J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, it is mostly limited to non-humans, though some people gain small amounts and become known as sorcerers (wizards being powerful spirits). In many writers' works, it is reserved for a select group of humans, such as in J. K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" books, Katherine Kurtz's \"Deryni\" novels, or Randall Garrett's \"Lord Darcy\" universe.\n\nMagicians normally learn spells by reading ancient tomes called grimoires, which may have magical properties of their own. Sorcerers in \"Conan the Barbarian\" often gained powers from such books, which are demarcated by their strange bindings. In worlds where magic is not an innate trait, the scarcity of these strange books may be a facet of the story; in Poul Anderson's \"A Midsummer Tempest\", Prince Rupert seeks out the books of the magician Prospero to learn magic. The same occurs in the \"Dungeons and Dragons\"-based novel series \"Dragonlance Chronicles\", wherein Raistlin Majere seeks out the books of the sorcerer Fistandantilus.\n\nSome magicians, even after training, continue their education by learning more spells, inventing new ones (and new magical objects), or rediscovering ancient spells, beings, or objects. For example, Dr. Strange from the Marvel Universe continues to learn about magic even after being named Sorcerer Supreme. He often encounters creatures that haven't been seen for centuries or more. In the same universe, Dr. Doom continues to pursue magical knowledge after mastering it by combining magic with science. Fred and George Weasley from \"Harry Potter\" invent new magical items and sell them as legitimate defense items.\n\nHistorically, many self-proclaimed magicians have required rare and precious materials, such as crystal balls, rare herbs (often picked by prescribed rituals), and chemicals such as mercury. This is less common in fantasy. Many magicians require no materials at all; those that do may require only simple and easily obtained materials. Role-playing games are more likely to require such materials for at least some spells to prevent characters from casting them too easily.\n\nWands and staves have long been used as requirements for the magician. The first magical wand was featured in the \"Odyssey,\" used by Circe to transform Odysseus's men into animals. Italian fairy tales put wands into the hands of powerful fairies by the late Middle Ages. Today, magical wands are widespread and are used from \"Witch World\" to \"Harry Potter.\" In \"The Lord of the Rings\", Gandalf refuses to surrender his own staff, breaking Saruman's, which strips the latter of his power. This dependency on a particular magical item is common, and necessary to limit the magician's power for the story's sake – without it, the magician's powers may be weakened or absent entirely. In the \"Harry Potter\" universe, a wizard must expend much greater effort and concentration to use magic without a wand, and only a few can control magic without one; taking away a wizard's wand in battle essentially disarms him.\n\nNevertheless, many magicians live in pseudo-medieval settings in which their magic is not put to practical use in society; they may serve as mentors, act as quest companions, or even go on a quest themselves, but their magic does not build roads or buildings, provide immunizations, construct indoor plumbing, or do any of the other functions served by machinery; their worlds remain at a medieval level of technology.\n\nSometimes this is justified by having the negative effects of magic outweigh the positive possibilities. In Barbara Hambley's \"Windrose Chronicles\", wizards are precisely pledged not to interfere because of the terrible damage they can do. In \"Discworld\", the importance of wizards is that they actively do not do magic, because when wizards have access to lots of \"thaumaturgic energy\", they develop many psychotic attributes and may eventually destroy the world. This may be a direct effect or the result of a miscast spell wreaking terrible havoc.\n\nIn other works, developing magic is difficult. In Rick Cook's \"Wizardry\" series, the extreme danger presented by magic and the difficulty of analyzing the magic have stymied magic and left humanity at the mercy of the dangerous elves until a wizard summons a computer programmer from a parallel world — ours — to apply the skills he learned in our world to magic.\n\nAt other times, magic and technology do develop in tandem; this is most common in the alternate history genre. Patricia Wrede's \"Regency\" fantasies include a Royal Society of Wizards and a technological level equivalent to the actual Regency; Randall Garrett's \"Lord Darcy\" series, Robert A. Heinlein's \"Magic, Incorporated\", and Poul Anderson's \"Operation Chaos\" all depict modern societies with magic equivalent to twentieth-century technology. In \"Harry Potter\", wizards have magical equivalents to non-magical inventions; sometimes they duplicate them, as with the Hogwarts Express train.\n\nThe powers ascribed to magicians often affect their roles in society. In practical terms, their powers may give them authority; magicians may advise kings, such as Gandalf in \"The Lord of the Rings\" and Belgarath and Polgara the Sorceress in David Eddings's \"The Belgariad\". They may be rulers themselves, as in E.R. Eddison's \"The Worm Ouroboros\", where both the heroes and the villains, although kings and lords, supplement their physical power with magical knowledge, or as in Jonathan Stroud's \"Bartimaeus Trilogy\", where magicians are the governing class. On the other hand, magicians often live like hermits, isolated in their towers and often in the wilderness, bringing no change to society. In some works, such as many of Barbara Hambly's, they are despised and outcast specifically because of their knowledge and powers.\n\nIn the magic-noir world of the \"Dresden Files\", wizards generally keep a low profile, though there is no explicit prohibition against interacting openly with non-magical humanity. The protagonist of the series, Harry Dresden, openly advertises in the Yellow Pages under the heading \"Wizard\" and maintains a business office, though other wizards tend to resent him for practicing his craft openly. Dresden primarily uses his magic to make a living finding lost items and people, performing exorcisms, and providing protection against the supernatural.\n\n"}

{"id": "7835879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7835879", "title": "Minoan religion", "text": "Minoan religion\n\nMinoan religion was the religion of the Bronze Age Minoan civilization of Crete. Modern scholars have reconstructed it almost totally on the basis of archaeological remains rather than texts. Minoan religion is considered to have been closely related to Near Eastern prehistoric religions, and its central deity is generally agreed to have been a goddess. Prominent Minoan sacred symbols include the bull and its horns of consecration, the labrys (double-headed axe), and the serpent.\n\nBased on archaeological evidence of such as paintings, statuettes, and seal rings, it is clear that the dominant figure in Minoan religion was a goddess, with whom a younger male figure, perhaps a consort or son, is often associated, usually in contexts suggesting that the male figure is a worshiper. The Goddess was also often associated with animals, especially the snake, but also with bull, lion, and dove. She seems to have been served by priestesses, but there is no evidence that Minoan religious practice was centered around formal public temples. Some scholars see in the Minoan Goddess a female divine solar figure. \n\nKároly Kerényi believed that the most important goddess was Ariadne, daughter of King Minos and \"mistress of the labyrinth\" who is identified in Linear B (Mycenean Greek) tablets in Knossos. Though the notorious bull-headed Minotaur is a purely Greek depiction, seals and seal-impressions reveal bird-headed or masked deities. \nRetrieval of metal and clay votive figures, double axes, miniature vessels, models of artifacts, animals, and human figures has identified sites of cult, such as numerous small shrines in Minoan Crete, and mountain peaks and very numerous sacred caves over 300 have been explored were the centers for some cult, but temples, as the Greeks developed them, were unknown. Within the palace complex, no central rooms devoted to a cult have been recognized other than the center court, where youths of both sexes would practice the bull-leaping ritual. There are no Minoan frescoes that depict any deities.\n\nOne of the cultic figures of ancient Crete and later of the Mycenaeans is known as the Minoan Genius. This was a fantastic creature with similarities both to the lion and the hippopotamus, which implies a connection with ancient Egypt. This deity played a role as a protector of children, and also in various fertility rituals.\n\nA major festive celebration was exemplified in the famous athletic Minoan bull dance, represented at large in the frescoes of Knossos and inscribed in miniature seal stones.\n\nThere is significant debate among scholars as to whether the athletes actually vaulted over the bull. Sir Arthur Evans argued that the Bull-Leaping Fresco depicts acrobats literally seizing the bull by the horns and leaping over the creature’s back. Others have asserted that the fresco more likely shows young Minoan people attempting to ride the bull and that the act of catching a charging bull and vaulting over it is unrealistic.\n\nEvidence pertaining to Minoans and the practice of human sacrifice has been found around three sites: (1) Anemospilia, in a MMII building near Mount Juktas, interpreted as a temple, (2) an EMII sanctuary complex at Fournou Korifi in south central Crete, and (3) Knossos, in an LMIB building known as the \"North House.\" (\"explanation of abbreviations\")\n\nThe temple at Anemospilia was destroyed by earthquake in the MMII period. The building seems to be a tripartite shrine, and terracotta feet and some carbonized wood were interpreted by the excavators as the remains of a cult statue. Four human skeletons were found in its ruins; one, belonging to a young man, was found in an unusually contracted position on a raised platform, suggesting that he had been trussed up for sacrifice, much like the bull in the sacrifice scene on the Mycenaean-era Agia Triadha sarcophagus. A bronze dagger was among his bones, and the discoloration of the bones on one side of his body suggests he died of blood loss. The bronze blade was fifteen inches long and had images of a boar on each side. The bones were on a raised platform at the center of the middle room, next to a pillar with a trough at its base.\n\nThe positions of the other three skeletons suggest that an earthquake caught them by surprise—the skeleton of a twenty-eight-year-old woman was spread-eagled on the ground in the same room as the sacrificed male. Next to the sacrificial platform was the skeleton of a man in his late thirties, with broken legs. His arms were raised, as if to protect himself from falling debris, which suggests that his legs were broken by the collapse of the building in the earthquake. In the front hall of the building was the fourth skeleton, too poorly preserved to allow determination of age or gender. Nearby 105 fragments of a clay vase were discovered, scattered in a pattern that suggests it had been dropped by the person in the front hall when he was struck by debris from the collapsing building. The jar appears to have contained bull's blood.\n\nUnfortunately, the excavators of this site have not published an official excavation report; the site is mainly known through a 1981 article in \"National Geographic\" (Sakellarakis and Sapouna-Sakellerakis 1981.)\n\nNot all agree that this was human sacrifice. Nanno Marinatos says the man supposedly sacrificed died in the earthquake that hit at the time he died. She notes that this earthquake destroyed the building, and killed the two Minoans who supposedly sacrificed him. She also argues that the building was not a temple and that the evidence for sacrifice \"is far from ... conclusive.\" Dennis Hughes concurs and argues that the platform where the man lay was not necessarily an altar, and the blade was probably a spearhead that may not have been placed on the young man, but could have fallen during the earthquake from shelves or an upper floor.\n\nAt the sanctuary-complex of Fournou Korifi, fragments of a human skull were found in the same room as a small hearth, cooking-hole, and cooking-equipment. This skull has been interpreted as the remains of a sacrificed victim.\n\nExcavations at Knossos uncovered additional mass burials, revealing the practice of child sacrifice as well. The British School of Athens, led by Peter Warren, excavated a mass grave of sacrifices, particularly children. The findings also suggest they were victims of cannibalism.\n\nFurthermore, Rodney Castleden, details the findings at a sanctuary near Knossos where the remains of a seventeen year old boy was sacrificed.\nIn the \"North House\" at Knossos, the bones of at least four children (who had been in good health) were found which bore signs that \"they were butchered in the same way the Minoans slaughtered their sheep and goats, suggesting that they had been sacrificed and eaten. The senior Cretan archaeologist Nicolas Platon was so horrified at this suggestion that he insisted the bones must be those of apes, not humans.\"\n\nThe bones, found by Peter Warren, date to Late Minoan IB (1580-1490), before the Myceneans arrived (in LM IIIA, c. 1320-1200) according to Paul Rehak and John G. Younger. Dennis Hughes and Rodney Castleden argue that these bones were deposited as a 'secondary burial'. Secondary burial is the not-uncommon practice of burying the dead twice: immediately following death, and then again after the flesh is gone from the skeleton. The main weakness of this argument is that it does not explain the type of cuts and knife marks upon the bones.\n\nLike much of the archaeology of the Bronze Age, burial remains constitute much of the material and archaeological evidence for the period. By the end of the Second Palace Period Minoan burial practice is dominated by two broad forms: 'Circular Tombs', or \"Tholoi\", (located in South Crete) and 'House Tombs', (located in the north and the east). Of course, there are many trends and patterns within Minoan mortuary practice that do not conform to this simple breakdown. Over all, inhumation was the most popular form of burial, cremation does not seem to have been a popular means of burial in Bronze Age Crete. Throughout this period there is a trend towards individual burials, with some distinguished exceptions. These include the much-debated Chrysolakkos complex, Mallia, consisting of a number of buildings forming a complex. This is located in the centre of Mallia's burial area and may have been the focus for burial rituals, or the 'crypt' for a notable family.\n\nThese tombs often evidence group burial, where more than one body is deposited. These may represent the burial crypts for generations of a kin group, or of a particular settlement where the individuals are not closely related and shared in the construction of the tomb. The 'house tomb' at Gournia is a typical example, where the construction consisted of a clay and reed roof, topping a mud-brick and stone base. At Ayia Photia certain rock-cut chamber tombs may have been used solely for the burial of children, indicating complex burial patterns that differed from region to region. Mortuary furniture and grave goods varied widely, but could include storage jars, bronze articles such as tools and weapons, and beauty articles such as pendants. Little is known about mortuary rituals, or the stages through which the deceased passed before final burial, but it has been indicated that 'toasting rituals' may have formed a part of this, suggested by the prevalence of drinking vessels found at some tombs.\n\nIn later periods (EM III) a trend towards singular burials, usually in clay \"Pithoi\" (large storage vessels), is observed throughout Crete, replacing the practice of built tombs. Equally, the introduction of \"Larnake\" or \"Larnax\" burials emerges, where the body was deposited in a clay or wooden sarcophagus. These coffins were often richly decorated with motifs and scenes similar to those of the earlier fresco and vase painting tradition. However, rock-cut tombs and Tholoi remained in use even by the LM III period, including the site of Phylaki.\n\nThe distribution of burial sites varies in time and space. Some functional demands may have influenced the decision to locate a cemetery: the Late Minoan rock-cut tombs at Armeni utilise the geography of the area for structural support, where chambers are dug deep into the rock. Generally, cemeteries tend to cluster in regions close to settled areas. The Mochlos cemetery, for example, would have served the inhabitants of that island who settled in the south of the area. The cemetery itself has been interpreted to indicate a visible hierarchy, perhaps indicating social differentiation within the local population; larger, monumental tombs for the 'èlite', and smaller tombs, including some early \"Pithoi\" burials, for the larger part of the population.\n\nThe German geologist Hans Georg Wunderlich argued that the Palace of Knossos itself was a mortuary temple. This interpretation is strongly rejected by mainstream archaeology.\n\nWalter Burkert warns, \"To what extent one can and must differentiate between Minoan and Mycenaean religion is a question which has not yet found a conclusive answer\". Burkert suggests that useful parallels will be found in the relations between Etruscan and Archaic Greek culture and religion, or between Roman and Hellenistic culture. Minoan religion has not been transmitted in its own language, and the uses literate Greeks later made of surviving Cretan mythemes, after centuries of purely oral transmission, have transformed the meager sources: consider the Athenian point of view of the Theseus legend. A few Cretan names are preserved in Greek mythology, but there is no way to connect a name with an existing Minoan icon such as the familiar serpent-goddess.\n\nHowever Μ. Nilsson proposed that the origin of the Greek goddess Athena was the Minoan snake-goddess, citing that Athena was closely related with snakes.\n\nPlutarch (\"The Intelligence of Animals\" 983) mentions the horn altar (\"keraton\") associated with Theseus, which survived on Delos: \"I saw, the Altar of Horn, celebrated as one of the Seven Wonders of the World because it needs no glue or any other binding, but is joined and fastened together, made entirely of horns taken from the right side of the head.\"\n\n\n"}

The manuscript in the British Library passed through several hands: Simon Forman, Richard Napier, Elias Ashmole and William Lilly.\n\nAccording to the prologue of the Latin translation, \"Picatrix\" was translated into Spanish from the Arabic by order of Alphonso X of Castile at some time between 1256 and 1258. The Latin version was produced sometime later, based on translation of the Spanish manuscripts. It has been attributed to Maslama ibn Ahmad al-Majriti (an Andalusian mathematician), but many have called this attribution into question. Consequently, the author is sometimes indicated as \"Pseudo-Majriti\".\n\nThe Spanish and Latin versions were the only ones known to Western scholars until Wilhelm Printz discovered an Arabic version in or around 1920.\n\nThe work is divided into six books, which exhibit a marked absence of systematic exposition. Jean Seznec observed, \"\"Picatrix\" prescribes propitious times and places and the attitude and gestures of the suppliant; he also indicates what terms must be used in petitioning the stars.\" As an example, Seznec then reproduces a prayer to Saturn from the work, noting that Fritz Saxl has pointed out that this invocation exhibits \"the accent and even the very terms of a Greek astrological prayer to Kronos. This is one indication that the sources of \"Picatrix\" are in large part Hellenistic.\":\n\nAccording to Garin:\nAccording to the Prologue, the author researched over two hundred works in the creation of \"Picatrix\". However, there are three significant Near/Middle Eastern influences: Jabir ibn Hayyan, the Brethren of Purity, and ibn Wahshiyya's \"Nabataean Agriculture\". The influence of Jabir ibn Hayyan comes in the form of a cosmological background that removes magical practices from the context of diabolical influences and reasserts these practices as having a divine origin. The author of \"Picatrix\" utilizes Neoplatonic theories of hypostasis that mirror the work of ibn Hayyan.\n\nThe Arab historian, Ibn Khaldun, ascribed authorship of \"Picatrix\" (referring to the original Arabic version, under the title \"Ġāyat al-Ḥakīm\") to a mathematician called al-Majriti, who died between 1005CE and 1008CE (398 AH). However, according to Holmyard, the earliest manuscript attribution of the work to Maslama al-Majriti was made by the alchemist al-Jildaki, who died shortly after 1360, while Ibn Khaldun died some 20 years later. However, no biography of al-Majriti mentions him as the author of this work.\n\nMore recent attributions of authorship range from \"the Arabic version is anonymous\" to reiterations of the old claim that the author is \"the celebrated astronomer and mathematician Abu l-Qasim Maslama b. Ahmad Al-Majriti\". One recent study in \"Studia Islamica\" suggests that the authorship of this work should be attributed to Maslama b. Qasim al-Qurtubi (died 353/964), who according to Ibn al-Faradi was \"a man of charms and talismans\". If this suggestion is correct it would place the work in the context of Andalusian sufism and batinism.\n\nThe odd Latin title is sometimes explained as a sloppy transliteration of one \"Buqratis\", mentioned several times in the second of the four books of the work. Others have suggested that the title (or the name of the author) is a way of attributing the work to Hippocrates (via a transcription of the name \"Burqratis\" or \"Biqratis\" in the Arabic text). Where it appears in the Arabic original, the Latin text does translate the name Burqratis as \"Picatrix\", but this still does not establish the identity of Burqratis. Ultimately, linking the name, Picatrix, with Hippocrates, has fallen into disfavor because the text separately cites Hippocrates under the name \"Ypocras\".\n\nMartin Plessner suggests that a translator of the \"Picatrix\" established a medieval definition of scientific experiment by changing a passage in the Hebrew translation of the Arabic original, establishing a theoretical basis for the experimental method: \"the invention of an hypothesis in order to explain a certain natural process, then the arranging of conditions under which that process may intentionally be brought about in accordance with the hypothesis, and finally, the justification or refutation of the hypothesis, depending on the outcome of the experiment\".\n\nPlessner notes that it is generally agreed that awareness of, \"the specific nature of the experimental method–as distinct from the practical use of it–is an achievement of the 16th and 17th centuries.\" However, as the passage by the translator of the Hebrew version makes clear, the fundamental theoretical basis for the experimental method was here established prior to the middle of the 13th century.\n\nThe original passage in Arabic describes how a man who witnessed a treatment for a scorpion's sting (drinking a potion of frankincense that had received seal imprints) had gone on to experiment with different types of frankincense, assuming that this was the cause for the cure, but later found that the seal images were the cause for the cure, regardless of the substance upon which they were impressed. The author of the \"Picatrix\" goes on to explain how the explanation of the effectiveness of cures passed on to him by authorities was then proved to him by his own experience.\n\nThe Hebrew translator changed the passage in question to include the following:\nAnd that was the reason which incited me [to devote myself to astrological magic]. Moreover, these secrets were already made known by Nature, and the experience approved them. The man dealing with nature has nothing to do but producing a reason of what the experience has brought out.\nPlessner also notes that \"neither the Arabic psychology of study nor the Hebrew definition of the experiment is rendered in the Latin \"Picatrix\". The Latin translator omits many theoretical passages throughout the work.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The tradition emerged in the 17th century in Western India, based on the teachings of Bhakti saints, Sri Devchandra Maharaj and his foremost disciple Sri Mehraj Thakur (also known as Mahamati Prannath or Prananath, which gives this tradition the name).\n\nThe tradition grew after Mughal Empire declined, in the wake of Aurangzeb's religious persecution of non-Muslims, when Hindu rebellion led to new kingdoms. King Chhatrasal of one such kingdom of Bundelkhand patronized Prannath. The Pranami tradition welcomed Hindus and Muslims to join the Supreme Truth Akshrateet Shri Krishna worship tradition. At conversion initiation, Prannath would invite the new members to dine together regardless of whether they came from Hindu or Muslim background. He would also explain the Pranami ideas by citing Hindu and Muslim texts to make his teachings connect with the background of the converts.\nThe religious center of the Pranami tradition has been in northeast Madhya Pradesh, in the town of Panna. In the contemporary era, other major Pranami religious centers (\"gaddi\") are in Jamnagar (Gujarat) and Phuguwa (south of Kathmandu, Nepal).\n\nThe Pranami worship Akshrateet Shri Krishna as the Supreme Truth God, and its theology holds \"nirguna Brahman\" (panentheistic) view of influenced by the Shuddhadvaita philosophy of Vallabhacharya. Its Hindu temples include idols, or sometimes just the texts. It's theology is contained in 14 religious texts attributed to Prannath, the \"Bhagavad Gita\" and the \"Bhagavata Purana\". While the Hindu scriptures \"Bhagavad Gita\" and the \"Bhagavata Purana\" are in Sanskrit, the 14 Prannath compositions contain 18,768 \"chaupai\" (verses), and is called \"Kuljam Svarup\". It is, like in other Bhakti movement saint traditions, an eclectic mix of vernacular languages found in central, west and north India: Hindi, Gujarati, Urdu, Arabic, Persian, Sindhi and Sanskrit. The Pranami devotees believe that Prannath taught with his text, the essence of all major religious texts of the world, including the Vedas, the Bhagawat Geeta, the Quran and the Bible. The devotees believe in Hindu bhakti, but willingly accept or reject teachings found in other sources and texts.\nThe tradition is strictly vegetarian (ahimsa, non-violence to animals), non-caste tradition dedicated to Radha-Krishna. Dedicated Pranami temples exist such as in Kathiawar and Gulf of Kutch region, but followers of Pranami traditions substitute it by praying and spiritual pursuits in any nearby convenient Hindu Krishna temples. There are an estimated 5-10 million Pranamis found primarily throughout North India, particularly the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal (Darjeeling , Kalimpong and Sikkim), and Assam, as well as the eastern half of Nepal.\n\nMahatma Gandhi's mother was a pious Pranami Hindu.\n\nPranami Ashok Gupta from Bahjoi started taking initiative in the city and inviting others to the Gyan and doing every week once the Sandhya and sing a lot of Bhajans.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "54320963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54320963", "title": "Revelation 12 sign prophecy", "text": "Revelation 12 sign prophecy\n\nThe Revelation 12 sign prophecy was an apocalyptic belief that suggested an astronomical alignment on September 23, 2017 fulfilled the first two verses of Revelation 12. This date coincided with the Autumnal equinox and the end of the Catholic September Ember Days. This theory, promoted by a number of Christians and Christian news organizations, proposed that a literal fulfillment of the prophecy made in the Book of Revelation 12:1-2 occurred on this date over Jerusalem. Others maintained caution while nevertheless marveling at the coincidence.\n\nThe passage of the New Testament in the Book of Revelation 12:1-3 describes \"a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth.\" (NIV). Many people worldwide believe that an astronomical alignment involving the constellations Virgo and Leo, the sun, moon, and planets Mercury, Mars, Venus, and Jupiter that occurred in September 2017 fulfilled this prophecy word-for-word. It is also known as the Woman of the Apocalypse. Some of the most common Christian interpretations of this passage interpret the woman as Mary or ancient Israel, the man child as the incarnate Jesus and the (\"teknon) child being\" the Body of Christ, and the woman's other offspring as the Church that forms during the tribulation.\n\nOn April 7, 2011, William Tapley's channel ThirdEagleBooks published the first video about the alignment entitled \"Stellarium\" giving the 2017 date of the great sign and explaining how the planetary alignment that year matched the text of Revelation 12 better than a 2011 alignments, which he said three earlier videos from other people had mentioned. A few months later, on July 30, 2011, Scott Clarke from ERF Ministries posted a video on YouTube describing the alignment, which some people worldwide have now come to believe is the Revelation 12 sign.\nDuring 2011, Scott Clarke continued to popularize the alignment on YouTube. On December 10, 2012, Unsealed World News suggested that the purported sign might be connected to the rapture of the Church, though they have repeatedly stated that the exact date of the rapture is unknown and might happen sometime before, on, or after September 23. Years later, Greg Lauer posted about the astronomical alignment and references Scott Clarke's reports on his website dated May 2017 that Lu Vega claimed that he discovered the sign about 2008 but told no one until after several others posted about it in 2011. Also in 2017, Luis (\"Lu\") B. Vega connected the sign to a \"Conception Comet\".\n\nThe Apocalypse of John describes \"a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head.\" The proponents of the \"Revelation 12 Sign\" say that the woman represents the constellation Virgo and the crown of twelve stars represents the nine stars of the constellation Leo in conjunction with Mercury, Mars, and Venus. The moon appears to be under the \"feet\" of the constellation Virgo in September 2017 and the sun will be passing through the constellation, which they say is what is meant by the woman being \"clothed with the sun\". The second verse of the twelfth chapter of John's Apocalypse goes on to say that the woman \"was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth.\" Some people suggest this will be fulfilled because the planet Jupiter will be traversing the constellation after having undergone apparent retrograde motion. After entering what they perceive to be Virgo's \"womb\" around November 20, 2016. Jupiter exits the lower part of the \"womb\" 42 weeks later, which is the approximate length of a human gestation (normal gestation periods lasting from 37 to 42 weeks).\nIt was also discovered that the apparent retrograde of Jupiter in the womb of Virgo was preceded by C/2017 E1 (Comet Borisov) which is being called the \"Conception Comet\". This comet traveled from the loins of the constellation Leo to the womb of the constellation Virgo on November 17, 2016, just before the entrance of Jupiter into the womb. Some proponents of the Revelation 12 Sign are suggesting that this comet represented the divine insemination of the woman, which subsequently produced the male child (Jupiter). This will be the comet's only trip through our solar system as it is not a solar orbital. The complete astronomical alignment occurred on September 23, 2017, over Jerusalem.\n\nThe Revelation 12 Sign may have coincided with the High Holy Day of Rosh Hashanah on the Jewish calendar, which is also called the \"Feast of Trumpets\". The Feast of Trumpets is the first of the Fall Feasts and its timing is traditionally based on the visibility of the new moon, which in 2017 is expected to either begin on the evening of September 21 and end on the evening of the 22nd (if the 2% illuminated moon is sighted) or begin on the evening of the 22nd and end on the evening of the 23rd when the sign is fulfilled. Rosh Hashanah is the Jewish New Year celebration, in this case marking the end of the year 5777 (sometimes abbreviated to the significant number 777) and the beginning of 5778. The Feast of Trumpets in Jewish tradition is believed to be a day when the dead will be resurrected and judgement will begin while Christians believe the period describes the tribulation period found in the Book of Revelation.\n\nInterpretations of Revelation 12 vary, but the general consensus of those who promoted this theory was that the September 2017 alignment was the Great Sign which is described in this passage of Scripture: that the woman represents the nation of Israel, which they believe is about to enter into a multi-year period of Tribulation, and the male child represents the global Church, which might be raptured to Heaven before the Tribulation period begins according to Revelation 12:5. Many proponents say that in order for people to escape before this impending judgment on the world and be \"raptured\", they must accept that the Christian Messiah Jesus Christ died for their sins, rose again, and is the only means of being reconciled to God. These views are shared by all of the major proponents of the Revelation 12 Sign Prophesy. It has also been pointed out by Revelation 12 Sign proponents that a number of eminent biblical scholars support their particular interpretation of Revelation 12, including John Nelson Darby, Harry Ironside, and more recently Dr. Michael Svigel.\n\nThe apocalyptic symbol of \"a woman in labor\" is found throughout Jewish and Christian Scriptures, which proponents suggest is evidence of the September 2017 alignment's importance in prophecy. These particular Scriptures include , , , , , , and . According to Isaiah 66 above, the birth of the man-child occurs before the woman travails in labor and pain. Proponents argue that the rapture is the marvel spoken of by Isaiah in the above passage—the man-child representing the Church that will be born before Israel enters the Tribulation. Since the woman apparently has other children according to Revelation 12 (such as Gentile Tribulation Saints and the 144,000), the dragon, since he cannot devour the raptured Church, persecutes the woman's other children spoken of later in Revelation 12.\n\nSome, such as Lloyd F. Acree, claim a direct revelation from God brought the event to the world's attention as confirmation of the pre-tribulation Rapture and its timing to be in the year 2017. Shortly after L. Acree claims to have received his message in early Spring of 2017, he then took to preaching the prediction on various social media outlets and with the use of a sandwich board in the streets of Simpsonville, SC. Acree started his prophetic claims by saying the Rapture would occur by the end of Calender year 2017, He strongly directed people to Sept. 23 of that year, and when it did not come to pass, he returned to anytime by the end of the year. Since this, too, had failed, he claimed that he had presumed God meant the planet's calender and not God's Holy \nCalender, which he then stated the Rapture would happen before the close of the Winter of 2017, or by March 20, 2018. Since this failed, he, once again, proclaimed that it was, \"Pushed back\" until the passover, March 30, 2018. Having failed four times, Lloyd still has not repented of his presumptuous speaking for God, when it is obvious by failure that he has no actual truthful revelation.\n\nStill others, while hailing the sign as an indicator for Rapture, yet emphasize a broader interest in many possible events for its actual manifestation such as the Jewish holidays of September and the solar eclipse of August 21st, 2017. These and other claims have sparked viral interpretation commentaries from across the spectrum of leading Christian websites, such as Charisma News and AnswersInGenesis, to messages from self-identified prophets and their critics of various persuasions.\n\nThe Revelation 12 Sign has received widespread media attention including from \"The Washington Post\", \"The Boston Globe\", \"LifeSite News\", \"Shoebat\", \"Prophetic.com\", and \"The Catholic Astronomer\", among others.\n\nA number of critics have offered rebuttals of the purported sign arguing that the sign is not unique or is only astrology. Critics include \"Answers in Genesis\" author Dr. Danny Faulkner, Christian author Joel Richardson, Jan Markell from Olive Tree Ministries, Christian bible prophecy author Craig C. White, Christian blogger and author Tim McHyde, and several others.\n\nFaulkner mentions several specific points of contention including:\n\n\nCraig C. White is a proponent of a short timeline end of days, but gives several criticisms of the Rev 12 sign theory:\n\nTim McHyde mentions several flaws in the Rev 12 theory:\n\nEd Stetzer who holds the Billy Graham Distinguished Chair of Church, Mission, and Evangelism at Wheaton College, and Executive Director of the Billy Graham Center, wrote this about it:\n\nIn response to the many critics of the Rev 12 sign theory, Unsealed World News has reiterated their position that the September 2017 alignment perfectly fits the description given in the biblical text and that their interpretation of the events described will be the only such occurrence in human history.\n\nAn AT&T original documentary, \"The Sign\", explored the intersections of science, religion, and history behind the Revelation 12 debate. It aired on Audience on September 14, 2017.\n\nThere are two signs (or wonders) mentioned in Revelation Chapter 12. The second is This second sign is regarding the dragon which is now believed to be Scorpio. The everlasting Abrahamic covenant that God made with Abraham was fulfilled 430 years to the day () after Abraham was told to look up to the sky () and completed when Israel exited Egypt, which is confirmed in (). Many Christian followers of the sign now recognise that after exactly 430 days, Jupiter which represents the manchild enters into Scorpio and is in perfect alignment with the Sun, Mercury, and the stars that comprise Scorpios left claw. This is widely believed to represent the second part of the sign which takes place on November 27, 2018. This day is also exactly 1260 days after Donald Trump announced his presidency on 16 June, 2015. (1260 days is a number for Biblical calculation based on half the seven year tribulation period 2520 days)\n\n\n"}

The first edition was published in 1986, the second in 1987 and the third in 1999.\n\nThe subject matter of this book is censorship, the banning of books and the Quran.\n\nOn July 20, 1984, H.K. Chakraborty wrote to the Secretary, Department of Home Government of West Bengal, demanding the ban of the Quran. He wrote again on 14 August 1984, but received no response. Chakraborty lived in Bangladesh before moving to Kolkata, and witnessed the behaviour of the Muslims towards the Hindu minority in Bangladesh during the Partition of India and later.\n\nChakraborty thereafter met Chandmal Chopra, who also wrote to the Department of Home Government of West Bengal on March 16, 1985. But also Chopra's letter wasn't answered. Chopra therefore filed a writ Petition at the High Court.\n\n\"Chandmal Chopra\" tried to obtain an order banning the Koran, by filing a Writ Petition at the Calcutta High Court on 29 March 1985. The petition claimed that Sections 153A and 295A of the Indian Penal Code, and Section 95 of the Criminal Procedure Code were often used by Muslims to ban or proscribe publications critical of Islam, and stated that \"so far it had been the privilege of the Peoples of the Book to ban and burn the sacred literature of the Pagans.\" Chandmal Chopra thought that the Koran \"on grounds of religion promotes disharmony, feeling of enmity, hatred and ill-will between different religious communities and incite people to commit violence and disturb public tranquility...\"\n\nChandmal Chopra also included a list of several dozens of Quran verses that \"promote disharmony\" in his petition. The book claims that these Quran verses embody one of the main themes of the book: \"Nor have these passages been culled at random from different chapters of the Quran with a view to making the book sound sinister. On the contrary, they provide an almost exhaustive list of Allah’s sayings on a subject of great significance, namely, what the believers should believe about and do to the unbelievers...\"\n\nThe Telegraph of May 9, 1985 reported that the Union Government would make itself a party in the case, and the Union law minister Ashoke Sen and the attorney-general of the Government of India were going to take action against the case. Muslim lawyers after a meeting condemned the case. According to The Telegraph of May 10, the Chief Minister of West Bengal called the petition \"a despicable act\". Other politicians in the Lok Sabha at New Delhi, and the Minister of State for Law condemned the Petition.\n\nPakistan’s minister of state for religious and minority affairs claimed that the petition was the ‘worst example of religious intolerance’, and he urged the Indian government to ‘follow the example of Pakistan’ in ensuring freedom of religion.\n\nThe petition was however dismissed in May 1985. The text of the judgment is included in the book. The Attorney-General of the Government of India and the Advocate-General of West Bengal appeared in the case and argued against Chopra's petition.\n\nOn June 18, 1985 Chandmal Chopra filed a review petition, which was dismissed on June 21.\n\nThe petition by Chandmal Chopra also led to many riots in India and Bangladesh.\n\nThe Statesman reported that \"at least 12 people were killed and 100 wounded all are poor Hindus\" in a border town of Bangladesh during a demonstration of 1000 people. In Dhaka, at least 20,000 Jamaat-i-Islami supporters demonstrated against the petition. The demonstrators were trying to storm the office of India's High Commission. Other riots followed in Kashmir and Bihar.\n\nAfter the case was closed, the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, during a mass rally in Srinagar, demanded action against Justice Padma Khastgir who permitted the petition to be filed. During this mass rally, one person was killed and others injured. A \"hartal\" (strike) against the interference in Muslim personal law was observed during which all shops and colleges were closed.\n\nOn August 31, 1987 Chandmal Chopra was arrested by the police and kept in police custody until September 8 for publishing with Goel this book on the petition. Sita Ram Goel had to abscond to avoid getting arrested.\n\nThe authors write in this book that they do \"not stand for a ban on the publication of the Quran. We take this opportunity to state unambiguously that we regard banning of books, religious or otherwise, as counterproductive. In the case of the Quran, we believe and advocate that more and more non-Muslims should read it so that they know first hand the quality of its teachings.\"\n\nThe book was received with great interest in India and abroad, according to Goel. Goel also read primary Islamic sources like the Urdu translations of six Hadis during his research for this book. In one chapter, Goel also compares Genghis Khan, the Mongols and Tengiri with Islam.\n\nThe Times of India published three articles which praised the Quran during the Petition controversy. Goel claims that a rebuttal to these articles could not be published in the Times of India. Goel claims that the chief editor, Girilal Jain, regretted his inability to do so for reasons he could not reveal.\n\nThe book also gives an account of the banning of a poster that contained 24 citations from the Koran. In 1986, after the first edition of the \"Calcutta Quran Petition\" was published, a Hindi poster by Indra Sain Sharma and Rajkumar Arya was published by the Hindu Raksha Dal, Delhi. Indra Sain Sharma was the president of the Hindu Raksha Dal and the Vice-President of the All India Hindu Mahasabha. The poster cited 24 ayats from the Quran in Hindi.\n\nThe poster with the 24 Ayats also stated that:\n\nThe publishers of the poster were arrested under Sections 153A and 295A of the Indian Penal Code. The metropolitan magistrate of Delhi however discharged Sharma and R. Arya. He concluded on 31 July 1986, that the poster can \"at the most be branded as a fair criticism\" and that “with due regard to the holy book of ‘Quran Majeed’, a close perusal of the ‘Aytes’ shows that the same are harmful and teach hatred, and are likely to create differences between Mohammedans on one hand and the remaining communities on the other\".\n\n\n\n"}

The police, alerted by Salomon, find the bodies and accuse Pivert of the crime.\n\nThe next day, Slimane forces Pivert to go to Orly airport to catch a plane to Slimane's country (if the revolution succeeds, he will become President). However, they are followed by a number of people: the jealous Germaine, Pivert's wife, who thinks her husband is going to leave her for another woman; Farès and the killers; and the police commissioner Andréani (Claude Piéplu), a zealous and overly suspicious cop who imagines that Pivert is the new Al Capone. Farès and his cohorts manage to kidnap Germaine, and they use her own dentist equipment to interrogate her.\n\nTrying to conceal his and Pivert's identities, Slimane attacks two rabbis in the toilets, stealing their clothes and shaving their beards and their payot. The disguises are perfect, and they are mistaken for Rabbi Jacob and Rabbi Samuel by the Schmoll family. The only one who recognizes Pivert (and Slimane) behind the disguise is Salomon, his former driver, who just happens to be a Schmoll nephew. But Pivert and Slimane are able to keep their identity secret and even manage to hold a sermon in Hebrew, thanks to the polylingual Slimane (who is deeply gutted, of course).\n\nAfter a few misunderstandings, Commissioner Andréani and his two inspectors are mistaken by the Jews for terrorists, attempting to kill Rabbi Jacob. The real Rabbi Jacob arrives at Orly, where no one is waiting for him any more. He is mistaken for Victor Pivert by the police, then by Farès and his killers (both times in a painful way for his long beard).\n\nThere is a chaotic, but sweeping happy ending:\n\n\n\n"}

It is operated by a worldwide network of volunteers and employees and has been awarded a special consultative status at the United Nations Economic and Social Council. \n\nThe Tzu Chi Foundation was founded by Master Cheng Yen, a Taiwanese Buddhist nun, or \"bhikkhuni\", in 1966 as a Buddhist humanitarian organization. The foundation has several sub-organizations such as the Tzu Chi International Medical Association (TIMA) and also the Tzu Chi Collegiate Youth Association (Tzu Ching) (慈濟大專青年聯誼會 (慈青)), Tzu Chi volunteers and relief workers are mostly recognizable worldwide by their blue and white uniforms called, in , \"lántiān báiyún\", ( lit. 'blue sky, white clouds'). The foundation's work includes medical aid, disaster relief, and environmental work such as recycling. \n\nWhile Tzu Chi has a policy of being secular in its humanitarian work, Dharma teachings are often integrated into its practices for volunteers. Cheng Yen is considered to be one of the \"Four Heavenly Kings\" of Taiwanese Buddhism, and Tzu Chi itself is considered to be one of the \"Four Great Mountains\", or four major Buddhist organizations of Taiwanese Buddhism along with Fo Guang Shan, Dharma Drum Mountain, and Chung Tai Shan.\n\nThe Tzu Chi Foundation was founded as a charity organization with Buddhist origins by the Buddhist nun Master Cheng Yen on 14 May 1966 in Hualien, Taiwan. She was inspired by her master and mentor, the late Venerable Master Yin Shun (印順導師, Yìn Shùn dǎoshī) a proponent of Humanistic Buddhism, who exhorted her to \"work for Buddhism and for all sentient beings\". The organization began with a motto of \"instructing the rich and saving the poor\" as a group of thirty housewives who saved fifty cents (US$0.02) every day and stored them in bamboo savings banks to donate to needy families.\n\nTzu Chi experienced modest growth in the first two decades of its establishment, it grew to 293 members in 1968 and by 1986 had just 8,000 members. However, with the surge in popularity of Humanistic Buddhism in Taiwan in the late 1980s and 1990s, Tzu Chi enjoyed a rapid expansion in membership alongside several other major Taiwanese Buddhist organizations. From 1987 to 1991, Tzu Chi membership doubled in size each year, by 1994, it boasted a membership of 4 million members. Tzu Chi has grown to become a significant actor in civil society, Tzu Chi is not only the largest Buddhist organization in Taiwan, but also Taiwan's largest owner of private land. \n\nThe foundation achieved much media attention in Taiwan in 2015 with a controversial plan to develop a plot of land in Neihu District into a disaster relief center and cultural park. The project led to the destruction of parts of the Neihu conservation zone and a public outcry in Taiwan that forced the foundation to end the planned development. The incident led to widespread critical coverage of Tzu Chi by the Taiwanese media, and scrutiny into its finances. During this time several unsubstantiated reports circulated in Taiwan about the foundation, including unfounded claims that the foundation invested in tobacco and weapons companies. Despite authorities not finding any illicit activity with its finances, calls for greater transparency were made. \n\nAs of 2013, the organization was estimated to have approximately 10 million members worldwide, and chapters in 47 countries.\n\nThe four major causes of Tzu Chi are \"Charity\", \"Medicine\", \"Education\", and \"Humanity\", as highlighted by the official motto, or concept of \"Four endeavors, eight footprints\" (). The eight footprints are charity causes, medical contributions, education development, humanities, international disaster assistance, bone-marrow donation, community volunteerism, and environmental protection.\n\nThe official website for the organization states that the organization started with Charity, and then extended its aims to include Medicine, Education and Culture. Its stated goal is to promote \"sincerity, integrity, trust, and honesty\".\n\nTzu Chi is notably distinct from the other \"Four Great Mountains\" and the other major Buddhist organizations of Taiwan in respect to three main unique characteristics. First of all, the founder of the organization is a female. Secondly, the founder is not a Buddhist scholar who promotes a specific interpretation of Buddhism nor started any kind of religious movement. And finally, the organization is officially a charitable organization and Tzu Chi itself focuses primarily on humanitarianism and community service rather than Buddhist spiritual development.\n\nConsisting of a ship that also simultaneously bears the lotus fruit and flower, the Tzu Chi logo symbolizes that the world can be made a better place by planting good karmic seeds. Followers believe that these seeds are required for flowers bloom and bear fruit, which is a metaphor for their beliefs that a better society can be created with good actions and pure thoughts. The ship represents Tzu Chi steering a ship of compassion, representing their goal in saving all beings that suffer, while the Eight Petals represent the Noble Eightfold Path in Buddhism, which Tzu Chi uses as their guide.\n\nThe Noble Eightfold Path consists of:\n\nTzu Chi also has its own customized version of the Buddhist Precepts as formulated by Master Cheng-Yen. The Ten Precepts of Tzu Chi are:\n\n\nMaster Cheng-Yen has stated that she developed these rules based on the new needs of modern society.\nThe Great Awakened of the Universe (宇宙大覺著) is the Tzu Chi Foundation's depiction of the Buddha. In the statue, the Buddha is depicted as a monk, with his palm placed over a globe, letting the world witness his enlightenment. The image has been subject to controversy in Taiwan, the primary criticism being that the image looks more like Cheng Yen rather than a traditional depiction of Gautama Buddha.\n\nOne of the first major initiatives Tzu Chi took part in was the \"Tzu Chi Medical Mission\". This effort was inspired in 1970 after Cheng Yen noticed a link between poverty and illness after spending six years among the poor of eastern Taiwan.\n\nTzu Chi's first medical outreach occurred in 1972 when a free clinic was opened in Hualien.\n\nThe Foundation established its first Tzu Chi Hospital in Hualien in 1986. A 600-bed general hospital had been planned in 1979 to service the impoverished eastern coast of Taiwan. A primary concern for Cheng Yen was that the area was isolated and the people in the area were cut off from aid during disasters. Despite setbacks both in funding for the hospital and finding an acceptable site. Ground was broken on the site eventually chosen on 5 February 1983 at a ceremony officiated by then Provincial Governor (later President) Lee Teng-Hui. However, two weeks after ground was broken, Cheng Yen received a notice from the military telling her that the property was needed by the military and that construction would have to stop.\n\nA new site was obtained for the hospital with help from Minister of the Interior Lin Yang-kang. A second groundbreaking occurred on 2 April 1984 at the new site. The publicity of the project to build the hospital led to a significant increase in the number of Tzu Chi volunteers, with Tzu Chi membership increasing six-fold by the time of the second groundbreaking since the announcement of the project in 1979. Construction was completed and the hospital opened on 17 August 1986.\n\nTzu Chi has since built hospitals in Yuli, Hualien County; Dalin, Jiayi County; Guanshan, Taidong County; Tanzi District, Taichung City; and Xindian, New Taipei City.\n\nIn addition to building hospitals the Tzu Chi College of Nursing was founded on 17 September 1989 in Hualien in order to address the shortage of nurses on Taiwan's east coast, with a focus on serving the poor. It was the first private nursing college in Taiwan to waive tuition for selected courses, in addition to providing full scholarships for qualified Taiwan aborigine students.\n\nTzu Chi created a bone marrow registry, the Tzu Chi Bone Marrow Bank, in 1993 after a young follower of Cheng Yen was diagnosed with Leukemia. Cheng Yen referred to the concept of bone marrow donation as a way to \"save a life without harming yourself.\" This effort to register bone marrow donors from an organization with such massive membership like Tzu Chi caused Taiwan to change its laws regarding organ donations. This registry became a division of the new Tzu Chi Stem Cells Center, which was founded to improve research and treatment capabilities. By 2007 the program had saved the lives of almost 1,500 people in 25 different countries. By 2008, Tzu Chi had registered more than 307,657 bone marrow donors.\n\nTzu Chi established the Tzu Chi College of Medicine in 1994. This college became Tzu Chi University in 2000. In the meantime Cheng-Yen appealed to the Taiwanese public to donate their bodies for medical training, attempting to dispel traditional taboos in the process. As a result of this appeal, public support for body donations surged nationwide. Consequently, at the Tzu Chi College of Medicine, there is one body for every four students to study as opposed to one body for every two hundred students at one school, the ratio is the lowest in the country.\n\nIn 1995, the Athletic Drug Testing Center was established at the request of the Ministry of Education and went into operation in 1996 during a national sporting event when gold medal winners were tested for banned drugs.\n\nTzu Chi is most well known for its disaster relief efforts worldwide. In carrying out these projects, Tzu Chi has a policy that forbids public gatherings for the sole purpose of specific political, economic, and religious groups. Tzu Chi volunteers are not to discuss business, politics, or preach religion while giving aid. One of the most iconic attributes of Tzu Chi disaster relief efforts is that volunteers not only provide short term aid but also partake in long term projects to rebuild the communities affected. Tzu Chi often builds new homes, schools, hospitals, and places of worship (including churches and mosques for non-Buddhists) for victims following a disaster.\n\nTzu Chi's involvement with providing aid in the People's Republic of China was difficult at first. Cheng Yen has referred to relief work in China as \"Building a Bridge of Love.\" The initial problems with providing aid in China involved the political tensions between Taiwan and China and Communist China's disdain for religion. In Taiwan, it was difficult to convince Taiwanese to help the Chinese, and in China, it was difficult to convince government officials normally wary of religious organizations to accept Tzu Chi. \n\nTzu Chi's involvement in the People's Republic of China began in 1991, when it undertook relief operations after severe floods hit central and eastern China. The aid provided to China was Tzu Chi's first major effort at international relief aid, it also allowed Tzu Chi to develop its principles of delivering aid and establish relations with the People's Republic of China. Since then, the foundation has built schools, nursing homes and entire villages, including infrastructure in poor inland areas, such as Guizhou province. \n\nOver the past twenty years, Tzu Chi expanded their humanitarian work and influence to 28 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China. Projects include relief work after major disasters like the Sichuan earthquake; distribution of rice and goods to the poor; social programs like regular visits to the needy; scholarship programs to the less privileged students; medical missions like bone marrow donation and free clinics; and educational outings of environmental protection and recycling activities.\n\nIn March 2008, Tzu Chi became the first organization represented by a non-Mainland resident to be registered with the Chinese government.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Tzu Chi sent food, blankets and medical aid to survivors, while volunteers in China set out for the disaster zone. Tzu Chi was also one of the few organizations the Chinese government allowed to bring in aid workers from overseas to join the relief effort. With the motto \"First to arrive, last to leave,\" the organization has continued with long-term reconstruction work in Sichuan, and by 2010, had rebuilt thirteen schools in the region.\n\nIn August 2010, Tzu Chi became the first overseas NGO to receive permission from the Ministry of Civil Affairs to set up a nationwide charity foundation. Normally, overseas organizations must register with the Ministry of Commerce as businesses. The foundation received the China Charity Award from the Ministry of Civil Affairs for its work in charity and promoting the well-being of society in 2006 and again in 2008.\n\nIn 1996, Tzu Chi started a nationwide volunteer program where volunteers are registered according to where they live with the goal of \"neighbors helping neighbors.\" The community volunteer initiative began as a disaster relief effort started in response to Typhoon Herb.\n\nTzu Chi volunteers were one of the first responders in the Jiji earthquake (known in Taiwan as the 921 earthquake) of 1999, mobilizing within 2 hours to provide thousands of sets of food and relief supplies to victims. The volunteers followed a strict system of organization where commissioners and teams of volunteers were assigned to specific townships, and teams were assigned to specific areas within the townships. This organizational structure was what allowed the volunteers to be mobilized so quickly and efficiently. The earthquake prompted Cheng Yen to start \"Project Hope\", a long term project to rebuild 51 schools for those effected by the disaster. Tzu Chi raised more relief funds for the earthquake than any other religious organization in Taiwan, raising nearly sixty times as much funds for the relief effort than the next largest fund raiser, Fo Guang Shan. The 921 earthquake was credited for prompting Tzu Chi to create a disaster relief coordination center at its headquarters to organize quicker disaster response services.\n\nTzu Chi was also active in providing aid after Typhoon Nepartak struck Taiwan in 2016, providing relief supplies, rebuilding communities, and providing medical care through its medical support staff in Taimali, Taiwan which have been holding medical outreach free clinics in the area since 2006.\n\nTzu Chi has participated in numerous other relief projects around the world, including sending teams to Indonesia and Sri Lanka in the wake of the tsunami resulting from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake as well as to Pakistan after the 2005 earthquake in their northern mountains. The later was done despite poor relations between the governments of the two countries. \n\nIn the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, the organization announced on 18 November 2012 a donation of $10 million in the form of $300 and $600 Visa debit cards to those affected in the New York and New Jersey area. Volunteers handed out these cards in parts of Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. Tzu Chi was also active in providing aid following the 2015 Nepal Earthquake. Tzu Chi was also active in relief efforts during Hurricane Harvey in 2017, the group provided aid, as well as cash gifts for those who helped the community during the disaster. In 2016, the organization distributed in the United States over $2 million in cash cards to disaster victims. As of 2015, Tzu Chi has provided disaster relief aid to over 85 countries worldwide.\n\nTzu Chi's headquarters is in Hualien County, Taiwan.\n\nTzu Chi's portfolios include case management, medical, educational and disaster relief.\n\nThe organization builds and operates many hospitals and schools, with outreach efforts that range from visits to nursing homes to providing bone marrow surgery, as well as offering items such as washing machines to struggling single mothers. The television \"Da Ai\" network operates with its own news and television programming. Chinese schools have also been established abroad, such as in Australia and the United States, which apart from teaching Chinese and sign language also guides students in ways of compassion and community service.\n\nA significant fraction of funds raised by Tzu Chi revolves around environmentally friendly goals in encouraging the recycling of items such as water bottles as well as using reusable items or reusing items to reduce waste. \n\nAs of 2014, the foundation operates over 5,600 recycling stations. One of the foundation's projects is the recycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles for the production of textiles. The project, which was started in 2006, collects PET plastic bottles and recycles them into cloth. The project is handled by the Tzu Chi sponsored non-profit Da Ai Technology Co. The products are all designed by members of the paid staff and recycled plastic bottles make up about half of the raw materials for the products. The project collects about 2,000 tons of plastic bottles each year. Tzu Chi's recycling centers have been a source of criticism however, with critics arguing that Tzu Chi's recycling efforts result in lost income for poor trash collectors.\n\nSince 2007, the foundation has produced over 460,000 polyester blankets out of recycled plastic bottles, many of which have been distributed as part of Tzu Chi's disaster relief programs throughout the world. Other items made with the recycled resins include thermal underwear, T-shirts, hospital bed sheets, medical gowns, suitcases, stuffed animals and uniforms for Tzu Chi volunteers. While the project relies on recycled plastic bottles for the production of its products, its leaders have stated that it is still best for people to not use plastic bottles at all.\n\nThe teachings of the Buddha and founder Master Cheng Yen play a core role in the workings of the organization. \"Tzu Chi Day\" is celebrated every year on the second Sunday of May which generally coincides with the Buddha's birthday (Vesak Day), and Mother's Day (as recognised in Taiwan). Celebrations during Tzu Chi Day include the bathing of the Buddha ceremony, the tradition's message is that it is the people that need cleansing before they become better individuals. Tzu Chi promotes many of the teachings of Buddhism, in particular the Lotus Sutra, \nand also has sutra adaptations through the use of sign language on the Sutra of the Innumerable Meanings, which teaches that sentient existence is challenging and filled with disasters in the absence of observations of virtue, as well as the Sutra of the Water Repentance, which advocates and symbolizes the need to repent karmic transgressions. Despite these activities, Tzu Chi has a policy of not proselytizing religion directly at its public activities. Apart from being non-proselytist, Tzu Chi's adaptation of Buddhist principles is apolitical.\n\nIn disaster regions where a particular religious faith is prominent, Tzu Chi regularly works together with local religious organizations. Tzu Chi has re-built mosques and churches in disaster zones where faith plays an important role in local society.\n\nTzu Chi nuns (bhikkhunis) do not rely on donations for their livelihood, something uncommon among most Buddhist orders. In earlier days, the nuns sustained themselves by farming, weaving and other handicrafts. More recently, they sustained themselves by the manufacture of electrical circuit breakers and other products.\n\nTzu Chi has branches in 47 countries and regions including USA, Canada, Australia, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and various locations in Asia, Europe and Africa.\n\nOn 17 August 1999, a television network was formed in Taiwan under the Tzu Chi Foundation of the Culture of Communication, Inc with the slogan \"Love to make the world light up\". Formally known as Da Ai Television, the network grew into a global broadcasting presence with offerings of a radio service, Tzu Chi Channel 1, Tzu Chi Channel 2, Da Ai TV Indonesia, Da Ai TV Thailand, and Da Ai TV Egypt. Live streaming of Channel 1 and 2 can also be found on YouTube.\n\nJing Si Books & Café is a chain of non-profit bookstores and cafes operated by Tzu Chi offering Tzu Chi merchandise and publications by Cheng Yen.\n\nThe Tzu Chi Collegiate Association (慈濟大專青年聯誼會) is the Foundation's college youth organization, and was officially established in Taiwan on 31 May 1992. With chapters at universities worldwide, its goal is to allow university students (known as Tzu Ching or 慈青, literally \"compassionate youth\") to be involved with Tzu Chi's activities. Tzu Ching volunteers are given the opportunity to participate in large-scale events such as disaster relief and international NGO conferences such as the annual UN Youth Assembly. Master Cheng Yen encourages the Tzu Ching volunteers to actively communicate with each other, with the goals of learning and improving. Each year an international Tzu Ching officer training retreat camp is held at the foundation headquarters in Hualien.\n\nTzu Shao (慈少) is the Tzu Chi branch for youths under the age of 18. \n\nEach year Tzu Chi conducts a Year End Ceremony attended by Tzu Chi workers, volunteers and members in December where Master Cheng Yen distributes blessings in the form of red packets that embosses a coin in Taiwanese currency together with auspicious words for the coming year.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23915976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23915976", "title": "Virgen de Copacabana", "text": "Virgen de Copacabana\n\nThe Virgen de Copacabana (literal translation: Virgin of Copacabana; figurative translation: Our Lady of Copacabana; variant: Blessed Virgin of the Candelaria, Our Lady of Copacabana) is the patron saint of Bolivia. She is venerated in Bolivia during her feast day of 2 February, the day of the Purification of Mary, or feast of the Virgen de la Candelaria. She is also venerated on 5 August with her own liturgy and popular celebration.\n\nCopacabana is a Bolivian town located on a peninsula at the southeastern shore of Lake Titicaca. It is close to Isla del Sol and Isla de la Luna, islands sacred to the Aymara and Quechua. In the mid 16th century, the inhabitants of Copacabana were divided into two groups: Anansayas, Inca newcomers, and Urinsayas, the traditional residents of the region. Despite conversion to Christianity, they continued an attachment to their original religion. Poor harvests lead them to consider attracting favor from heaven through a new confraternity. The Anansayas resolved to venerate the Virgin Mary while the Urinsayas selected San Sebastian.\nFrancisco Tito Yupanqui, an amateur sculptor, a descendant of the Inca Huayna Capac, and a member of the Anansayas, did not abandon the idea. He decided to create an image of the Madonna, believing it would influence the local people. Using clay, and assisted by his brother Philip, Francisco Tito created the image of the Virgin. The sculpture was placed at the side of the altar by the pastor, Father Antonio de Almedio. After Father Antonio left Copacabana, the priest Don Antonio Montoro took over. Unhappy with the look of the coarse and disproportionate sculpture, he ordered that it be removed from the altar and be placed in a corner of the sacristy.\n\nFrancisco Tito was humbled by this setback. Advised by relatives, he went to Potosi which had outstanding teachers of sacred image sculpting. While studying in the workshop of Maestro Diego Ortiz, Francisco Tito gained expertise in sculpture and in wood carving. With this skill, he resolved to create an improved image of the Candelaria. He looked through the churches of Potosí for an image of the Virgin which could serve as a model, finally finding the best one in the Convent of Santo Domingo to the Virgen del Rosario. He studied it closely to remember it before starting his new piece and held a Mass in honor of the Holy Trinity as a divine blessing for his work.\n\nThe Urinsayas accepted the establishment of the Virgin Mary confraternity, but they did not accept Francisco Tito's carving, and decided to sell it. In La Paz, the picture reached the priest of Copacabana who decided he would bring the image to the people. On 2 February 1583, the image of Mary was brought to the hills of Guaçu. A series of miracles attributed to the icon made it one of the oldest Marian shrines in the Americas, along with Guadalupe in Mexico.\n\nOn August 1, 1925, during the Papal visit of Pope Pius XI to Bolivia, the image of the Virgin of Copacabana was blessed and granted a canonical coronation.Attending the coronation were three Bolivian bishops, President Bautista Saavedra and ambassadors representing Argentina and Peru. \n\nFrom its beginning, the image gained a reputation for being a miracle. The Augustinians built their first chapel between the 1614 and 1618, and later, the Viceroy of Lima, Conde de Lemos, morally and financially supported the construction of a basilica to honor the Virgin. Construction of the Basilica of Our Lady of Copacabana began in 1668, was inaugurated in 1678, and was completed by 1805. Subsequently, the faithful donated embellishments to the image, including valuable jewels, and the temple was filled with gifts and treasures.\n\nIn 1825, when Bolivia gained independence, it was attributed to the faith of the population through the Virgin of Copacabana. However, in 1826, Marshal Antonio José de Sucre, the President of the Republic of Bolivia, expropriated all the jewels and colonial treasures at the Shrine of the Virgin, using them to create the first coins from Bolivia.\n\nThe body of the image measures about four feet, carved in maguey wood and is laminated in gold leaf. The clothes are that of an Inca princess. The form is covered with luxurious robes and dresses, and wears a wig of long, natural hair. It holds the Child Jesus in a peculiar position, as if about to fall. In her right hand, she holds a basket and a gold baton, a gift and souvenir of the visit in 1669 from the Viceroy of Peru. \n\nThe original image never leaves the sanctuary; a copy is used for processions. Those leaving the shrine walk backwards with the intention not to turn their backs on the Virgin.\n\nThe Bolivian community in Argentina celebrates the Feast of the Virgin of Copacabana in Buenos Aires in October.\n\nIn the early hours of Monday 22 April 2013 the sanctuary of Copacabana was robbed and the image of the Virgen de Copacabana was stripped of her gold and silver accessories. Initial reports indicate that twenty-eight items, including the sculpture of the baby Jesus, were removed from the Virgen de Copacabana by thieves who entered the building using a ladder stolen from a nearby telecommunications station.\n\nThe Saturday 6 July 2013 the town of Copacabana restored the image of the Virgin with new jewelry.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20646351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20646351", "title": "Yuna (Final Fantasy)", "text": "Yuna (Final Fantasy)\n\nTetsuya Nomura based Yuna's overall design on hakama, but also wanted to give her outfit something that would flow and so gave her a furisode. Nomura said that her name means \"night\" in the Okinawan language, which contrasts with Tidus' name, which is Okinawan for \"sun\". For \"Final Fantasy X-2\", the game's staff wanted Tetsu Tsukamoto to redesign her costume to reflect her personality and the game's atmosphere. Yuna's character was well received by many media critics and fans and in particular praised for her relationship to Tidus, as well as her characterization and sex appeal. Despite this positive reception, there was a mixed reception for her role in \"Final Fantasy X-2\" due to her redesign.\n\nIn \"Final Fantasy X\", Yuna is introduced as a summoner who can use healing magic and is able to summon powerful magical entities called aeons with help from spirits known as Fayths. Already known throughout Spira as the daughter of High Summoner Braska, who previously brought a brief respite from Sin's destruction ten years earlier, Yuna decides to embark on the summoner's pilgrimage to become a High Summoner herself. Yuna must journey to temples across the world, acquire the aeon from each and summon the Final Aeon in a battle that will kill them both. She gradually becomes more open and falls in love with Tidus. Upon arriving at the place where Yuna can summon the final aeon, Tidus persuades the group to look for another way to defeat Sin without using any sacrifices. After entering Sin's body, Yuna and her guardians defeat the disembodied spirit of Yu Yevon, who is responsible for reviving Sin after each defeat, allowing an eternal Calm to start in Spira. However, Tidus disappears as he is the product of the Fayth, who could not depart until Sin's defeat.\n\nIn \"Final Fantasy X-2\", set two years after \"Final Fantasy X\", Yuna is a member of the sphere hunting group Gullwings, along with Rikku and Paine. In the game's international version, the Gullwings go their separate ways before the game's opening, with Yuna returning to Besaid Island. The trio then reunite to explore a tower. In \"X-2\", Yuna journeys to Spira in search of the truth behind a sphere containing a video featuring a man resembling Tidus in prison. During her journey, Yuna discovers the man from the sphere was actually Shuyin, a spirit who wishes to destroy Spira in revenge for the death of his lover, Lenne. The Gullwings defeat Shuyin who departs to the afterlife with Lenne's spirit. Depending on the player's progress throughout the game, the Fayth may revive Tidus so that she can reunite with him. The HD Remastered version of the game adds a new audio drama where Yuna becomes a part of the group called Yevoners whose main temple is located on Besaid. In the story she breaks up with Tidus after telling him she loves somebody else before declaring she will fight Sin once again.\n\nShe also appears in \"Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy\", an action game that features several \"Final Fantasy\" characters, as one of the characters to be summoned by the goddess Cosmos to participate in a war against her rival Chaos. For this game, Yuna appears in her \"Final Fantasy X\" form but sightly arranged to fit with the game's cast. Additionally, she has an alternative design based on Yoshitaka Amano's illustration, and a wedding dress from \"Final Fantasy X\". Her \"Final Fantasy X-2\" regular form was made available as downloadable content.\n\nOutside the \"Final Fantasy\" series, Yuna appears in \"Kingdom Hearts II\" as a pixie along with Paine and Rikku. Bribed by Maleficent into spying on Leon's group, the pixies eventually switch sides after being abandoned by the witch and told of Sora's cause. Yuna is also featured in the board game style video game \"Itadaki Street Special\", appearing alongside Auron and Tidus, and represents \"Final Fantasy X\" in the rhythm game \"Theatrhythm Final Fantasy\".\n\nMultiple figures and figurines of Yuna were produced by various manufacturers, including a 2001 figure by Square. A 2003 audio CD \"Final Fantasy X-2 Vocal Collections\" features performances by Mayuko Aoki, Marika Matsumoto and Megumi Toyoguchi, the voice actresses for Yuna, Rikku and Paine, respectively.\n\nAccording to Tetsuya Nomura, he based Yuna's overall design on hakama, a type of traditional Japanese clothing. Nomura said that when he learned the character was to perform a dance called the \"sending,\" he wanted to give her outfit something that would flow. For this reason, the specific type of kimono he chose for her was a furisode, a long-sleeved kimono. Nomura also said that he adorned Yuna's dress and necklace with images of the hibiscus flower also called \"yuna,\" and that her name carries the meaning of \"night\" (夕な) in Okinawan, establishing a contrast between her and the lead male protagonist of \"Final Fantasy X\", Tidus, whose Japanese name (ティーダ) translates to \"sun\" (太陽) in Okinawan. This contrast is also represented in-game by items named for the sun and moon that empower Tidus' and Yuna's most powerful weapons. Nomura explains that while all these subtle details may be unneeded, he wanted his designs to have meaning behind them.\n\nThe positive fan reaction to \"Final Fantasy X\" convinced the developers to continue the story of Yuna and other characters with \"Final Fantasy X-2\". Costume designer Tetsu Tsukamoto said that the radical design changes for Yuna from one game to the other reflected a huge cultural change. Producer Yoshinori Kitase added that they did not want to make \"Final Fantasy X-2\" feel like an extension of its predecessor, so they changed the clothing of Yuna, Rikku and others' to make them seem more active. This was accomplished before the story and setting were created. Because Yuna, Rikku and Paine live in a more care-free world, the designers wanted them to be able to dress up, a feature which became key to the gameplay. Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima described her new outfit as a \"natural reaction to the heavy stuff she wore in \"FFX\".\" Yuna's singing performance was used to demonstrate the pop feel that the game incorporates. \"Final Fantasy X\" director Motomu Toriyama said her personality was the result of not having her bear the responsibility of being a summoner anymore. He added that while \"she could be seen as a completely different person, ... deep in her heart, she is the same old Yuna.\"\n\nIn the Japanese versions of the games Yuna has been voiced by Mayuko Aoki.
