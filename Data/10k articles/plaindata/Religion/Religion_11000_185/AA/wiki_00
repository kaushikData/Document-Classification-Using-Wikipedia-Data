It is associated with Indo-Persian culture. The word is derived from Urdu, through the Arabic word \"Aadaab\", meaning etiquette.\n\nSince the normal greeting of Muslims i.e. \"As-salamu alaykum\" was meant for Muslims only, and Muslims in India lived in a multi-faith and a multi-lingual society, this alternative form of greeting was coined. The use of \"Adab\" is especially popular in the Indian city of Hyderabad, where religious pluralism has been historically emphasized; the Nizam of the region stated: \"Hindus and Muslims are like my two eyes ... How can I favor one eye over the other?\" Fundamentalist elements in the society oppose the use of \"Adab\" in an all-Muslim society.\n\nThe gesture involves raising the right hand towards the face with palm inwards such that it is in front of the eyes and the finger tips are almost touching the forehead, as the upper torso is bent forward. It is typical for the person to say \"adab arz hai\" (Nastaleeq: آداب عرض ہے, Devanagari: आदाब अर्ज़ है), meaning \"I offer my respects to you\", or simply just \"adab\". \nIt is often answered with the same or the word \"Tasleem\" is said as an answer or sometimes it is answered with a facial gesture of acceptance.\n\nIn popular culture today, the adab is often associated with the courtly culture of the Muslim Nawabs.\n\n"}

He is praised for his faith in the Epistle to the Hebrews.\n\nTextual scholars attribute the biblical genealogy to the Book of Generations, a hypothetically reconstructed document theorized to originate from a similar religiopolitical group and date to the priestly source. According to critical scholars, the Torah's genealogy for Levi's descendants, is actually an aetiological myth reflecting the fact that there were four different groups among the Levites – the Gershonites, Kohathites, Merarites, and Aaronids; Aaron – the eponymous ancestor of the Aaronids – could not be portrayed as a brother to Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, as the narrative about the birth of Moses (brother of Aaron), which textual scholars attribute to the earlier Elohist source, mentions only that \"both\" his parents were Levites (without identifying their names). Critical scholars suspect that the Elohist account offers both matrilineal and patrilineal descent from Levites in order to magnify the religious credentials of Moses.\n\n\"Amram\" is Arabicized to \"‘Imrān\" (, ). Commentators of the Quran have linked two individuals to the Arabic name. They are unanimous in asserting that Imran in verse is clearly the father of Mary, mother of Jesus, whose genealogy, according to al-Tabari, traces back to David. However, they disagreed whether the Imran mentioned in verse was the father of Moses and Aaron, or Mary. According to Islam, Imran was a noble man.\n\nAccording to the Septuagint, Amram's family tree would be as follows:\n\nAccording to the Masoretic Text, Amram's family tree would be:\n\nAccording to The Book of Jasher, Amram's family tree would be:\n\nIn the Apocryphal \"Testament of Levi\", it is stated that Amram was born, as a grandson of Levi, when Levi was 64 years old. The Exodus Rabbah argues that when the Pharaoh instructed midwives to throw male children into the Nile, Amram divorced Jochebed, who was three months pregnant with Moses at the time, arguing that there was no justification for the Israelite men to father children if they were just to be killed; however, the text goes on to state that Miriam, his daughter, chided him for his lack of care for his wife's feelings, persuading him to recant and marry Jochebed again. According to the Talmud, Amram promulgated the laws of marriage and divorce amongst the Jews in Egypt; the Talmud also argues that Amram had extreme longevity, which he used to ensure that doctrines were preserved through several generations.\n\nDespite the legend of his divorce and remarriage, Amram was also held to have been entirely sinless throughout his life, and was rewarded for this by his corpse remaining without any signs of decay. The other three ancient Israelites who died without sin, being Benjamin, Jesse and Chileab.\n\nAccording to the Book of Jubilees, Amram was among the Israelites who took the bones of Jacob's sons (excluding those of Joseph) to Canaan for burial in the cave of Machpelah. Most of the Israelites then returned to Egypt but some remained in Canaan, including Amram who only returned somewhere up to forty years later.\n\nOne of the Dead Sea Scrolls (4Q535, Manuscript B) is written from Amram's point of view, and hence has been dubbed the \"Visions of Amram\". The document is dated to the 2nd century BC and, in the form of a vision, briefly discusses dualism and the Watchers:\n"}

Much like Critical Buddhism and Buddhist modernism, it is a result of recent exchanges of Eastern and Western thought. While generally thought of as a sub-field of Buddhist studies, the discipline of Buddhist ethics draws together history, philosophy, religious studies, anthropology, and more in an attempt to understand what may be the fundamental question of Buddhism: how ought man live?\n\nSpecific work has been produced on Buddhist ethics dating back to the 1920s. Early descriptive accounts of Buddhist ethics include Tachibana’s \"Ethics of Buddhism\" (1926), focused on Theravādin ethics, and Poussin’s \"La Morale Bouddhique\" (1927), based on Mahāyāna texts. Other early authors that expressed interest in Buddhist ethics include Caroline Augusta Foley Rhys Davids and Isaline Blew Horner. In 1979 the \"Journal of Religious Studies\" featured a section devoted to the study of Theravādin ethics. featuring four prominent scholars in Buddhist studies.\n\nBuddhist ethics emerged as an academic discipline in 1992, with the publication of Damien Keown's book \"The Nature of Buddhist Ethics\". His subsequent co-founding of the \"Journal of Buddhist Ethics\" in 1994 further solidified the birth of a new field in the discipline of Buddhist studies. Prior to Keown's book, only a handful of books and articles existed that attempted to delve into the questions of a specifically Buddhist ethic. Even more daunting, however, has been the separation of 'ethics' from the rest of Buddhism. Buddhism has been called an eminently ethical religion. It has also been argued, by Keown and others, that the very question the Buddha sought to answer was a purely ethical one, namely, \"the perennial problem of the best kind of life for man to lead.\"\n\nIn October 2011 Columbia University hosted the first conference dedicated solely to Buddhist ethics entitled Contemporary Perspectives on Buddhist Ethics.\n\nArguably the most fruitful attempt to define Buddhist ethics has been in terms of Western theories from Aristotle (virtue), Kant (deontological), and Bentham and James Mill (utilitarian). However, others—mainly non-Western scholars—have sought to present Buddhist ethics in a more direct or traditional form.\n\nIn \"Buddhist Ethics as Virtue Ethics\", Nick Gier compares Buddha's ethical teachings to Aristotle's, \"Like Greek virtue ethics, Buddhist ethics is also humanistic and thoroughly personalist.\"\n\nDamien Keown devotes a great deal of his work to debunking claims that Buddhism is utilitarian in nature. His work then goes on to examine the structure of Buddhist ethics, focusing specifically on morality (Pali: \"siila\"). His conclusion is that Buddhist ethics most closely resembles the ancient Greek virtue ethics found in Aristotle.\n\nJames Whitehill, in \"Buddhist Ethics in Western Context: The Virtues Approach\", says, \"Buddhism's legitimation in the West can be partially met by demonstrating that Buddhist morality is a virtue-oriented, character-based, community-focused ethics, commensurate with the Western 'ethics of virtue' tradition.\"\n\nA handful of pioneering works have sought to examine similarities between Kantian and Buddhist ethics. One such is Bradford Cokelet's \"Reflections on Kant and Karma\".\n\n\"I would argue that, given the recent popularity of claiming that Buddhist ethics is a type of virtue ethics, Buddhist ethicists should respond to criticisms that Kant and Kantians have made of western versions of virtue ethics and to claims that most virtue-ethical criticisms of Kantianism rest on misunderstandings of Kant and Kantianism. See for example, J.B. Schneewind, “The Misfortunes of Virtue,” in Ethics, Volume 101, 1990, p. 42-63, Barbara Herman, “Making Room for Character,” and Allen W. Wood, “Self-love, Self-benevolence, and Self-conceit,” both in Kant, Aristotle, and the Stoics, ed. Jennifer Whiting and Stephen Engstrom, Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 1996, and Onora O’Neill, Towards Justice and Virtue, Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 1996.\" fn. 20, p.13.\"\n\nMark Siderits suggests that the doctrine of anatta provides the grounding for an \"aretaic consequentialism\" in which the goal is the alleviation of suffering for all beings (realizing that there is no \"self\" to be freed apart from others). He follows a long line of thinkers in Buddhist ethics.\n\nTwo key teachers of traditional Buddhist ethics are Hammalawa Saddhatissa and Padmasiri De Silva. Saddhatissa was a Sri Lankan Buddhist monk who wrote \"Buddhist Ethics\" in 1970 (reprinted in 1987, 1997 & 2003). De Silva has a similar work, \"Buddhism, Ethics and Society: The Conflicts and Dilemmas of Our Times\" (2002). A third, and less notable work is \"The Way to Social Harmony\" (1989, available online) by Venerable U Pyinnyathiha.\n\nThese works can be invaluable as an introduction into key Buddhist canonical texts such as the Sigalovada Sutta.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5185", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5185", "title": "Christ (title)", "text": "Christ (title)\n\nIn Christianity, Christ (, \"Christós\", meaning \"the anointed one\") is a title for the saviour and redeemer who would bring salvation to the whole House of Israel. Christians believe Jesus is the Israelite messiah foretold in both the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament. \"Christ\", used by Christians as both a name and a title, is synonymous with Jesus.\n\nThe role of the Christ in Christianity originated from the concept of the messiah in Judaism. Although the conceptions of the messiah in each religion are similar, for the most part they are distinct from one another due to the split of early Christianity and Judaism in the 1st century.\n\nThough the original followers of Jesus believed Jesus to be the Jewish messiah, e.g. in the Confession of Peter, before the crucifixion and resurrection, Jesus was usually referred to as \"Jesus of Nazareth\" or \"Jesus, son of Joseph\". Jesus came to be called \"Jesus Christ\" (meaning \"Jesus the \"Khristós\"\", i.e. \"Jesus the Messiah\" or \"Jesus the Anointed\") by his followers after his crucifixion and resurrection. Christians believe that the messianic prophecies were fulfilled in his mission, death, and resurrection. The Pauline epistles, the earliest texts of the New Testament, often refer to Jesus as \"Christ Jesus\" or \"Christ\". The word \"Christ\" was originally a title, but later became part of the name \"Jesus Christ\". It is also used as a title, in the reciprocal use \"Christ Jesus\", meaning \"the Messiah Jesus\", and independently as \"the Christ\".\n\nThe followers of Jesus became known as Christians (as in Acts ) because they believed Jesus to be the \"Khristós\" or \"Mashiach\" prophesied in the Hebrew Bible. Jesus was not, and is not, accepted in Judaism as a Jewish messiah, and the concept of a divine messiah was always rejected by Judaism as idolatry. Religious Jews still await their messiah's first coming and the Messianic prophecies of Jewish tradition to be accomplished. Religious Christians believe in the Second Coming of Christ, and they await the rest of Christian messianic prophecies to be fulfilled. One of those prophecies, distinctive in both the Jewish and Christian concept of the messiah, is that a Jewish king from the Davidic line, who will be \"anointed\" with holy anointing oil, will be king of God's kingdom on earth, and rule the Jewish people and mankind during the Messianic Age and World to come. Muslims accept Jesus () as \"al-Masih\", the messiah in Islam, and believe he will come again, but don't believe that the messiah is divine or the Son of God.\n\nThe area of Christian theology called Christology is primarily concerned with the nature and person of Jesus Christ as recorded in the canonical gospels and the letters of the New Testament.\n\nChrist comes from (\"Christos\"), meaning \"anointed one\". In the Greek Septuagint, \"christos\" was used to translate the Hebrew מָשִׁיחַ (\"Mašíaḥ,\" messiah), meaning \"[one who is] anointed.\", a title allegedly adopted from the term for the tradition of anointing the Egyptian pharaoh during coronation or marriage with oil drawn from the fat of \"messeh\", who was the sacred crocodile or crocodile star in the spells and the same anointing ritual may be traced to earlier Mesopotamian Mušḫuššu. In coffins of Egyptian mummies the word \"krst\" is found as a blessing and anointing from Horus and Osiris, hence the word \"Christos\" is thought as loaned. \"Krst\" denoted the process of preparation of the mummy by embalming, purifying and anointing, and can mean anointed, buried or covered in oil.. \n\nIn the Old Testament, anointing was reserved to the Kings of Israel, to the High Priest (Exodus 29:7, Leviticus 4:3–16), and to the prophets (1 Kings 19:16).\n\nThe word \"Christ\" (and similar spellings) appears in English and in most European languages. English-speakers now often use \"Christ\" as if it were a name, one part of the name \"Jesus Christ\", though it was originally a title (\"the Messiah\"). Its usage in \"Christ Jesus\" emphasizes its nature as a title. Compare the usage \"the Christ\".\n\nThe spelling \"Christ\" in English became standardized in the 18th century, when, in the spirit of the Enlightenment, the spelling of certain words changed to fit their Greek or Latin origins. Prior to this, scribes writing in Old and Middle English usually used the spelling \"Crist\" - the \"i\" being pronounced either as , preserved in the names of churches such as St Katherine Cree, or as a short , preserved in the modern pronunciation of \"Christmas\". The spelling \"Christ\" in English is attested from the 14th century.\n\nIn modern and ancient usage, even in secular terminology, \"Christ\" usually refers to Jesus, based on the centuries-old tradition of such usage. Since the Apostolic Age, the[...] use of the definite article before the word Christ and its gradual development into a proper name show the Christians identified the bearer with the promised Messias of the Jews.\n\nIn the Ancient Greek text of the deuterocanonical books, the term \"Christ\" (Χριστός, translit. Christós) is found in 2 Maccabees 1:10 (referring to the anointed High Priest of Israel) and in the Book of Sirach 46:19, in relation to Samuel, prophet and institutor of the kingdom under Saul.\n\nAt the time of Jesus, there was no single form of Second Temple Judaism, and there were significant political, social, and religious differences among the various Jewish groups. However, for centuries the Jews had used the term \"moshiach\" (\"anointed\") to refer to their expected deliverer. A large number of Old Testament passages were regarded as messianic by the Jews, many more than are commonly considered messianic by Christians, and different groups of Jews assigned varying degrees of significance to them.\n\nThe Greek word \"messias\" appears only twice in the Septuagint of the promised prince (; ). This title was used when a name was wanted for the promised one who was to be at once King and Savior. The New Testament states that the long-awaited messiah had come and describes this savior as \"the Christ\". In , the apostle Peter said, in what has become a famous proclamation of faith among Christians since the first century, \"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\"\n\nMark (\"The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God\") identifies Jesus as both Christ and the Son of God. The divinity is re-affirmed in . Thereafter, Mark never applies the term \"Christ\" to Jesus as a name. uses Christ as a name and Matthew explains it again with: \"Jesus, who is called Christ\". In the Gospel of John, Jesus referred to himself as the Son of God far more frequently than in the Synoptic Gospels.\n\nThe use of the definite article before the word \"Christ\" and its gradual development into a proper name show that the Christians identified Jesus with the promised messiah of the Jews who fulfilled all the Messianic predictions in a fuller and a higher sense than had been given them by the rabbis.\n\nThe Gospels of Mark and Matthew begin by calling Jesus both Christ and the Son of God, but these are two distinct attributions. They develop in the New Testament along separate paths and have distinct theological implications. At the time in Roman Judaea, the Jews had been awaiting the \"Messiah\", and many people were wondering who it would be. When John the Baptist appeared and began preaching, he attracted disciples who assumed that he would be announced as the messiah, or \"the one\" that they had been awaiting. \n\nIn the three Synoptic Gospels, the Baptism of Jesus is the first fact of the public ministry of Jesus and the first instance explicitly claiming that He is the Son of God, directly by God the Father and the descent of the Holy Spirit God, in aspect of a dove upon Him: Mark, chapter 1 (verses from 9 to 11), Matthew, chapter 3 (verses 15 to 17), and Luke, chapter 3 (vv. 15 to 17). Unlike Mark 1, the other two Synoptic Gospels don't refer the Baptism of Jesus in their first chapter. Nevertheless, Luke 1 narrows the birth of John the Baptist, and chapter 3 of Matthew is titled as its \"first narrative section\" by some translations of the Bible. \n\nIn the Gospel of St. John the Apostle and Evangelist too, the first instance of Jesus being called the Son of God appears during his baptism by John the Baptist. In the narrative, a voice from heaven called Jesus \"My Son\". John the Baptist was in prison in the Messengers from John the Baptist episode ( and Luke ), and two of his disciples ask Jesus a question on his behalf: \"Are you the one to come after me or shall we wait for another?\"—indicating that John doubted the identity of Jesus as Christ at that time (see also Rejection of Jesus).\n\nIn Martha told Jesus, \"you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world\", signifying that both titles were generally accepted (yet considered distinct) among the followers of Jesus before the raising of Lazarus.\n\nExplicit claims of Jesus being the messiah are found in the canonical gospels in the Confession of Peter (e.g. ) and the words of Jesus before his judges at his trial before the Sanhedrin. These incidents involve far more than a mere Messianic claim; taken in their setting, they constitute a claim to be the Son of God.\n\nIn the trial of Jesus before the Sanhedrin and Pontius Pilate, it might appear from the narratives of Matthew and Luke that Jesus at first refused a direct reply to the high priest's question: \"Art thou the Christ?\", where his answer is given merely as \"su eipas\" (\"thou hast said it\"). The Gospel of Mark, however, states the answer as \"ego eimi\" (\"I am\"), and there are instances from Jewish literature in which the expression \"thou hast said it\" is equivalent to \"you are right\". The Messianic claim was less significant than the claim to divinity, which caused the high priest's horrified accusation of blasphemy and the subsequent call for the death sentence. Before Pilate, on the other hand, it was merely the assertion of his royal dignity which gave grounds for his condemnation.\n\nThe word \"Christ\" is closely associated with Jesus in the Pauline epistles, which suggests that there was no need for the early Christians to claim that Jesus is Christ because it was considered widely accepted among them. Hence Paul can use the term \"Khristós\" with no confusion as to whom it refers, and he can use expressions such as \"in Christ\" to refer to the followers of Jesus, as in and . Paul proclaimed him as the Last Adam, who restored through obedience what Adam lost through disobedience. The Pauline epistles are a source of some key Christological connections; e.g., relates the love of Christ to the knowledge of Christ, and considers the love of Christ as a necessity for knowing him.\n\nThere are also implicit claims to him being the Christ in the words and actions of Jesus. Episodes in the life of Jesus and statements about what he accomplished during his public ministry are found throughout the New Testament. Trinitarianism summarily claims: \"Jesus Christ was fully God and fully man in one person, and will be so forever.\"\n\nThere are distinct, and differing, views among Christians regarding the existence of Christ before his conception. A key passage in the New Testament is where John 1:17 specifically mentions that \"grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.\" Those who believe in the Trinity, consider Christ a pre-existent divine hypostasis called the Logos or the Word. Other, non-Trinitarian views, question the aspect of personal pre-existence or question the aspect of divinity, or both. An example is the Orthodox Gnomic view, which asserts that Christ was, in fact, not a pre-existent divine being.\n\nThe concept of Christ as Logos derives from : \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\" In the original Greek, \"Logos\" (λόγος) is used for \"Word,\" and is often used untranslated. In the Christology of the Logos, Christ is viewed as the Incarnation of the \"Divine Logos\", i.e. The Word.\n\nIn the 2nd century, with his theory of \"recapitulation\", Irenaeus connected \"Christ the Creator\" with \"Christ the Savior\", relying on (\"when the times reach their fulfillment – to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ\") to gather together and \"wrap up\" the cycle of the Nativity and Resurrection of Christ.\n\nIn Apostle Paul viewed the Nativity of Jesus as an event of cosmic significance which changed the nature of the world by paving the way for salvation.\n\nChristian teachings present the Love of Christ as a basis for his sacrificial act that brought forth salvation. In Jesus explains that his sacrifice was performed so: \"that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do.\" then states that: \"Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it\".\n\nIn the 2nd century, Irenaeus expressed his views of salvation in terms of the imitation of Christ and his theory of \"recapitulation\". For Irenaeus the imitation of Christ is based on God's plan of salvation, which involved Christ as the \"Last Adam\" He viewed the incarnation as the way in which Christ repaired the damage done by Adam's disobedience. For Irenaeus, salvation was achieved by Christ restoring humanity to the image of God, and he saw the Christian imitation of Christ as a key component on the path to salvation. For Irenaeus Christ succeeded on every point on which Adam failed. Irenaeus drew a number of parallels, e.g. just as in the fall of Adam resulted from the fruit of a tree, Irenaeus saw redemption and salvation as the fruit of another tree: the cross of crucifixion.\n\nFollowing in the Pauline tradition, in the 5th century Augustine of Hippo viewed Christ as the mediator of the New Covenant between God and man and as the conqueror over sin. He viewed Christ as the cause and reason for the reconciliation of man with God after the fall of Adam, and he saw in Christ the path to Christian salvation. Augustine believed that salvation is available to those who are worthy of it, through faith in Christ.\n\nIn the 13th century Thomas Aquinas aimed to recapture the teachings of the Church Fathers on the role of the Holy Trinity in the economy of salvation. In Aquinas' view angels and humans were created for salvation from the very beginning. For Aquinas the Passion of Christ poured out the grace of salvation and all its virtues unto humanity.\n\nMartin Luther distinguished the history of salvation between the Old and the New Testament, and saw a new dimension to salvation with the arrival of Christ.\n\nThe focus on human history was an important element of the biblically grounded 16th-century theology of John Calvin. Calvin considered the first coming of Christ as the key turning point in human history. He viewed Christ as \"the one through whom salvation began\" and he saw the completion of Christ's plan of salvation as his death and Resurrection.\n\nThe use of \"Χ\", derived from Chi, the Greek alphabet initial, as an abbreviation for Christ (most commonly in the abbreviation \"Χmas\") is often misinterpreted as a modern secularization of the term.

Traditionally, the reading in Benedictine monasteries of excerpts from \"Collationes patrum in scetica eremo\", written by John Cassian, was followed by a light meal. Historically, an evening collation was defined as being less than eight ounces of food.\n\nThe traditional Black Fast of Western Christianity, which was broken after sunset, did not permit a collation. After the 14th century AD, taking a collation became a part of Christian fasting practices in many localities.\n\nToday, on Christian fasting days of Lent (Ash Wednesday and Good Friday), the Catholic Church prescribes \"one full meal, as well as two smaller meals that together are not equal to a full meal\". Similarly, an Evangelical Lutheran publication delineating fasting guidelines states that \"On fasting days, two ¼ meals are eaten, and one regular meal in the evening\". The Traditional Saint Augustine's Prayer Book: A Book of Devotion for Members of the Anglican Communion defines \"Fasting, usually meaning not more than a light breakfast, one full meal, and one half meal, on the forty days of Lent.\"\n\nThe French court of Louis XIV used the term collation to refer to light meals in general. In British English today, a collation is likewise a light meal, offered to guests when there is insufficient time for fuller entertainment. It is often rendered cold collation in reference to the usual lack of hot or cooked food. The Polish word \"kolacja\" (\"supper\") is a derivation. \n\nIn modern Italian, the two small meals are the \"prima colazione\" (breakfast) and \"seconda colazione\" (lunch). The word \"colazione\" itself in the general language now means \"breakfast\" (whereas the English \"break their fast\" for breakfast; lunch is \"pranzo\" in Italian).\n"}

Though best-documented in West Africa as well as in Afro-American religions, such as Santería, Candomblé, and Umbanda, cowrie-shell divination has also been recorded in other regions, notably East Africa and India.\n\nSeveral forms of cowrie-shell divination are distributed broadly throughout West Africa.\n\nWhile there are many variants using from eight to 21 cowrie shells, West African-derived forms most commonly use 16 cowrie shells on a prepared table or on a mat on the ground, interpreting the patterns that result which are known as Odu. Before casting the shells, the priest/priestess invokes and salutes the Orishas, and puts questions to them. The Orishas answer the questions by influencing the way the shells fall on the table.\n\nMerindinlogun (from the Yoruba \"mẹrindínlógún\" \"sixteen\", literally \"four taken from 20\") is a cowrie-shell divination method practiced in the Yoruba religion.\n\nThe number 16 holds important significance in Yoruba mythology as it was the purported number of original divinities that established life on earth. In merindinlogun divination, the shells are thrown and the number of shells that fall with the opening facing up is associated with a certain odu. This system of divination is used when consulting the Orishas.\n\nCowrie-shell divination is found in Latin America where it plays an important role in religions like Santería and Candomblé.\n\nIn Cuba, Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico, it is called \"dilogun\".\n\nIn Brazil, it is called \"merindinlogun\".\n\nThough they share a common root, Caribbean and South American cowrie shell divination have subsequently developed in independence from West African practice. For example, among Caribbean diviners, the first throw of the shells involves throwing them twice to derive a composite \"Odu.\"\n\nThe cowrie-shells, called dilogun, are used by priests and priestesses of Santería, who are called Santeros and Santeras, respectively. Both men and women who have been initiated into Santería can read cowrie shells. There are a combination of 256 possible odu and a skilled diviner can interpret the meaning of each one, depending on the orientation of the reading. If the reading comes in Ire, the client will experience good fortune, and if it comes in Osorbo, the client faces obstacles that can be overcome with the help of the Orichás.\n\nThe cowrie shell, as collected from a beach, has a flattened side with a longitudinal slit, and a smooth, rounded side. Like a coin, the shell has only two stable positions on a flat surface, with the slit side facing either up or down. A few cowrie-shell diviners use the shells in this natural state; then the outcome of the throw, for each piece, is either \"open\" (slit up) or \"closed\" (slit down).\n\nMost priests, however, use modified shells whose rounded part has been ground away, creating a second, artificial opening. The two stable positions of the shell are still called \"open\" or \"closed\" for divination purposes. In most Candomblé houses, \"open\" still means that the natural opening is facing up; but some traditions (mainly in Candomblé Ketu) use the opposite convention.\nThe number of \"open\" shells is used to select an item (\"odú\") which direct the diviner to a fixed list of oracular verses.\n\n\n7.

{"id": "244774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=244774", "title": "Curse", "text": "Curse\n\nA curse (also called an imprecation, malediction, execration, malison, anathema, or commination) is any expressed wish that some form of adversity or misfortune will befall or attach to some other entity: one or more persons, a place, or an object. In particular, \"curse\" may refer to such a wish or pronouncement made effective by a supernatural or spiritual power, such as a god or gods, a spirit, or a natural force, or else as a kind of spell by magic or witchcraft; in the latter sense, a curse can also be called a hex or a jinx. In many belief systems, the curse itself (or accompanying ritual) is considered to have some causative force in the result. To reverse or eliminate a curse is sometimes called \"removal\" or \"breaking\", as the spell has to be dispelled, and is often requiring elaborate rituals or prayers.\n\nThe study of the forms of curses comprise a significant proportion of the study of both folk religion and folklore. The deliberate attempt to levy curses is often part of the practice of magic. In Hindu culture the Sage or Rishi is believed to have the power to bless and curse. Examples include the curse placed by Rishi Bhrigu on king Nahusha and the one placed by Rishi Devala.\nSpecial names for specific types of curses can be found in various cultures:\n\nTecumseh's curse was reputed to cause the deaths in office of Presidents of the United States elected in years divisible by 20, beginning in 1840. This alleged curse appears to have fallen dormant, since Ronald Reagan (elected in 1980) survived an assassination attempt and George W. Bush (elected in 2000) survived his eight-year presidency.\n\nCurses have also been used as plot devices in literature and theater. When used as a plot device they involve one character placing a curse or hex over another character. This is distinguished from adverse spells and premonitions and other such plot devices. Examples of the curse as a plot device are the following:\n\nA number of curses are used to explain the failures or misfortunes of specific sports teams, players, or even cities. For example:\n\nCursed objects are generally supposed to have been stolen from their rightful owners or looted from a sanctuary. The Hope Diamond is supposed to bear such a curse, and bring misfortune to its owner. The stories behind why these items are cursed vary, but they usually are said to bring bad luck or to manifest unusual phenomena related to their presence. Busby's stoop chair was reportedly cursed by the murderer Thomas Busby shortly before his execution so that everyone who would sit in it would die.\n\nThere is a broad popular belief in curses being associated with the violation of the tombs of mummified corpses, or of the mummies themselves. The idea became so widespread as to become a pop-culture mainstay, especially in horror films (though originally the curse was invisible, a series of mysterious deaths, rather than the walking-dead mummies of later fiction). The \"Curse of the Pharaohs\" is supposed to have haunted the archeologists who excavated the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun, whereby an imprecation was supposedly pronounced from the grave by the ancient Egyptian priests, on anyone who violated its precincts. Similar dubious suspicions have surrounded the excavation and examination of the (natural, not embalmed) Alpine mummy, \"Ötzi the Iceman\". While such curses are generally considered to have been popularized and sensationalized by British journalists of the 19th century, ancient Egyptians were in fact known to place curse inscriptions on markers protecting temple or tomb goods or property.\n\nAccording to the Catholic Encyclopedia article \"Cursing\", the Bible depicts God cursing the serpent, the earth, and Cain (, , ). Similarly Noah curses Canaan (), and Joshua curses the man who should build the city of Jericho (). In various books of the Hebrew Bible there are long lists of curses against transgressors of the Law (, , etc.). The 10 Plagues of Egypt, preceeding the 10 Commandments, can be seen as curses cast from the magical rods of Aron and Moses acting on instruction from the God of Israel, in order to enable the enthralled to come free from the yoke of enforced serfdom, slavery and the like.\n\nIn the New Testament, Christ curses the barren fig-tree (), pronounces his denunciation of woe against the incredulous cities (), against the rich, the worldly, the scribes and the Pharisees, and foretells the awful malediction that is to come upon the damned (). The word curse is also applied to the victim of expiation for sin (), to sins temporal and eternal (; ).\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "534250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=534250", "title": "Egungun", "text": "Egungun\n\nEgungun, in the broadest sense of the word, refers to all types of Yoruba masquerades or masked, costumed figures. More specifically, \"Egungun\" refers to the Yoruba masquerades connected with ancestor reverence, or to the ancestors themselves as a collective force. The singular form, for an individual ancestor, is Egun or Eegun.\n\nThe classification of Egun or Egungun types, might appear to be a fairly straightforward task, but in fact it is extremely complex deciphering the comprehension of indigenous taxonomies. The difficulties include: the problem of distinguishing between personal Egun names and generic terms for types; the problem of determining \"sets\" where one masquerader may be regarded as within several type categories simultaneously; the practice of \"layering,\" in which a masquerader wears one costume type over another and changes these during performance; and the variety of criteria used to classify Egungun as well as the range of variations within type categories. Such factors demonstrate the complexity of the analysis of indigenous taxonomies and the classification of masquerade types. These same difficulties arise in the definition and use of the term Egungun itself.\n\nIn the Yoruba religion, the annual ceremonies in honor of the dead serve as a means of assuring their ancestors a place among the living. They believe the ancestors have the responsibility to compel the living to uphold the ethical standards of the past generations of their clan, town or family. The Egungun are celebrated in festivals, known as Odun Egungun, and in family ritual through the masquerade custom.\n\nIn family situations, a family elder known either formally or informally as \"Alagba\" presides over ancestral rites. He may or may not be initiated into the local Egungun society. In matters that deal with whole communities, Egungun priests and initiates who are trained in ancestral communication, ancestral elevation and funerary rites are assigned to invoke and bring out the ancestors. They wear elaborate costumes in masquerade. Through drumming and dance, the Egungun robed performers are believed to become possessed by the spirits of the ancestors, as manifested as a single entity. The Egungun spiritually cleans the community; through the dramatic acting and miming of the robed priests, they demonstrate both ethical and amoral behavior that have occurred since their last visit. In this way, they expose the strengths and weaknesses of the community to encourage behavior more befitting of their descendants. When this performance is completed, the performers as Egungun give messages, warnings and blessings to the assembled spectators.\n\nImportant Egungun include the Oloolu and Alapansanpa, both of Ibadanland. Elewe of the Ìgbómìnà Yoruba clan, which is common in the towns of Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún, Ìlá Òràngún, and Arandun, is also of particular prominence.\n\nIn Brazil, the main cult of the Egungun is found on the island of Itaparica, in the State of Bahia. Houses of worship dedicated to the Egungun also exist in other states.\n\nCloth plays an important role in the world of the Yoruba. Their beliefs equate nakedness with infancy, insanity, or the lack of social responsibility. More elaborate dress reflects social power and prestige. In performances honoring ancestors, exquisite cloth is the major medium for the masker's transformation. An Egungun costume is composed of multiple layers of cloth lappets made from expensive and prestigious textiles, expressing the wealth and status of a family as well as the power of the ancestor.\n\nThe composition of an Egungun ensemble has several distinctive features. The layer worn closest to the masker's skin, the undersack, must be made of Aso-Oke, the indigo and white strip-cloth (Fig. 6). It closely resembles the shroud in which the dead are wrapped. This sack, along with the netting for the face and hands, must completely seal the masker's body. The netting effectively disguises facial and hand features that might disclose his identity.\n\nOn top of this base are placed the layers of lappets. As the masker whirls, the lappets are sent flying, creating a \"breeze of blessing.\" The design of the costume is therefore closely related to the choreography of the performance. Henry Drewal hypothesizes that the breeze of blessing created by the Egungun may also relate to Oya, the wife of Shango, the deified fourth king of Oyo and the god of thunder. Oya is the whirlwind, considered a wind of blessing, that precedes Shango, the storm.\n\nTo make the costume beautiful, and thus powerful, the lappets are decorated with patchwork patterns, braids, sequins, tassels, and amulets. The amulets hold medicinal preparations which have performative power (ase), providing protection against enemies at a time when the transformed person is vulnerable.The main protective amulets, however, are on the inside of the costume, not the outside. Metallic objects are also sewn onto the garment. These catch the light as the wearer moves, creating flashes that suggest connection to the spirit world, orun. \n\nThe multiple hidden and visible layers of fabric used to create an Egungun costume signify the sacred and the worldly, respectively. The layers, used in combination, suggest the reunion of the departed and the living.\n\nAn ensemble is repaired and refurbished for use year after year, with layers of new lappets and amulets added to express remembrance and honour. Through divination, however, an ancestor might request a new costume altogether. The owner and the patron, the priest of divination, the tailor, the herbalist who prepares the packets of medicines, and the entire lineage collaborate in creating the ensemble. Depending upon its wealth, a family may own several types of Egungun costumes, which may represent specific or collective ancestors of the lineage.\n\nThe Egungun ensemble acts as the medium for the masker's transformation into his ancestors. An Egungun society is composed of men and women whose lineages have the right to present the masquerade. Men do the masking. Women never wear the costume, although they participate in the chorus that sings the oriki praise poems and histories of the families. Elder women of high title also perform invocations, prayers, and offerings. At annual festivals, each of the numerous lineages is given a separate day to perform. The masker is kept at a distance from the surrounding crowd with the help of attendants dressed in masquerade costumes of different types. After all the Egungun have danced, the ensembles are stored until the next performance.\n\nEgungun masquerades are male dominated within the performance aspect and women play an integral role in the ritual. Only males are allowed to connect with the spirits in Egungun by transforming into the masked figure. However, women are not powerless in the ritual of Egungun. Women are important to the creation of the materials, dramatizing the performance, singing, dancing and serving as an audience member. Elders say separation is necessary because of the dangers of women power. \n\nAccording to the Ifa corpus,  women were once in control of Egungun and the ritual originates from women’s religious experience in Yoruba. It is also argued that women were the sustainers of Egungun and according to the \"Odu Irantegbe\" \"chapter\" of the  Ifa corpus, they were tricked by men and their powers over the Egungun cult were taken away. \n\nAn Egungun masquerade performance at the palace of HRM The Alafin, Oyo, Oyo State, Nigeria, this being video footage that was filmed in August, 1999: Egungun Energized to Dance\n\n Portuguese \n"}

{"id": "7018908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7018908", "title": "Foundation Stone", "text": "Foundation Stone\n\nThe Foundation Stone ( \"Even ha-Shtiyya\" or \"Selā‛\", \"Sakhrah\" \"Rock\") is the name of the rock at the centre of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. It is also known as the Pierced Stone because it has a small hole on the southeastern corner that enters a cavern beneath the rock, known as the Well of Souls. There is a difference of opinion in classical Jewish sources as to whether this was the location of the Holy of Holies or of the Outer Altar. According to those that hold it was the site of the Holy of Holies, that would make this the holiest site in Judaism (\"Tanhuma\", chapter 10).\n\nJewish tradition views the Holy of Holies as the spiritual junction of Heaven and Earth, the axis mundi, and is therefore the direction that Jews face when praying the Amidah. The other view, that this was the site of the Outer Altar, would explain the holes in the stone which served various sacrificial purposes in the Outer Altar. From a classical Jewish textual standpoint, there is no conclusive opinion on the matter.\n\nThe rock is located towards the centre of the Temple Mount, an artificial platform built and expanded over many centuries. The current shape is the result of an expansion by Herod the Great on top of vaults over a summit called Mount Moriah which three millennia ago was the highest elevation in early Jerusalem's proximity to the City of David.\n\nThere is some controversy among secular scholars about equating Mount Moriah, the Temple Mount and the Foundation Stone as the location where events occurred according to the Biblical narrative.\n\nEarly Jewish writings assist in confirming that the Dome of the Rock, completed in 691, is the site of the Holy of Holies and therefore the location of the Foundation Stone. \"Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer\", a midrashic narrative of the more important events of the Torah believed to have been compiled in Italy shortly after 833 CE, writes: \"Rabbi Ishmael said: In the future, the sons of Ishmael (the Arabs) will do fifteen things in the Land of Israel … They will fence in the breaches of the walls of the Temple and \"construct a building on the site of the sanctuary\".\"\n\nRabbis have discussed the precise location of the rock. David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra was convinced that \"under the dome on the Temple Mount, which the Arabs call El-Sakhrah, without a doubt is the location of the Foundation Stone.\" The \"Travels of Petachia of Ratisbon\", c.1180, \"The Travels of Benjamin of Tudela\" and \"The Travels of the Student of the Ramban\" all equally state that \"on the Temple Mount stands a beautiful sanctuary which an Arab king built long ago, over the place of the Temple sanctuary and courtyard.\" Obadiah ben Abraham Bartenura, who wrote a letter from Jerusalem in 1488, says that \"I sought the place of the Foundation Stone where the Ark of the Covenant was placed, and many people told me it is under a tall and beautiful dome which the Arabs built in the Temple precinct.\"\n\nOther traditional sources disagreed; operating under the belief that the Southern Wall of the Temple Mount as it stood in their time was the Southern Wall of the Biblical era, they argued that the measurements given in the Talmud do not reconcile. The Holy of Holies ends up being too far north and they therefore locate the Foundation Stone as being directly opposite the current exposed section of the Western Wall, where no building currently stands. This is the view of Isaac Luria and the Maharsha, who state the prophecy that \"Zion will become a ploughed field\" indicates that no dwelling will be established there until the time of the Redemption. It therefore follows that the footprint of the Temple courtyard and Holy of Holies is situated in the unbuilt area between the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque.\n\nSome believe the position is north of the Dome of the Rock, opposite the Gate of Mercy, which Emmanuel Hai Ricci identifies as the Shushan Gate mentioned in the Talmud. This gate was described as being opposite the opening of the sanctuary.\n\nModern Jewish academics list four possible locations of the Foundation Stone:\n\nAlthough the rock is part of the surrounding 90-million-year-old, Upper Turonian Stage, Late Cretaceous karsted limestone, the southern side forms a ledge, with a gap between it and the surrounding ground; a set of steps currently uses this gap to provide access from the Dome of the Rock to the Well of Souls beneath it.\n\nThe rock has several artificial cuts in its surface generally attributed to the Crusaders whose frequent damage to the rock was so severe that the Christian kings of Jerusalem placed a protective marble slab over the rock. The marble slab was removed by Saladin. More recently, there has been speculation that several artificial features of the rock's surface may substantially predate the Crusades. Archaeologist Leen Ritmeyer reports that there are sections of the rock cut completely flat, which north-to-south have a width of 6 cubits, precisely the width that the Mishnah credits to the wall of the Holy of Holies, and hence Ritmeyer proposed that these flat sections constitute \"foundation trenches\" on top of which the walls of the original temple were laid. However, according to Josephus there were 31 steps up to the Holy of Holies from the lower level of the Temple Mount, and the Mishnah identifies 29 steps in total, and each step was half a cubit in height (according to the Mishnah); this is a height of at least 22 feet—the height of the Sakhra is 21 feet above the lower level of the Temple Mount, and should therefore have been under the floor.\n\nMeasuring the flat surface as the position of the southern wall of a square enclosure, the west and north sides of which are formed by the low clean-cut \"scarp\" at these edges of the rock, at the position of the hypothetical centre is a rectangular cut in the rock that is about 2.5 cubits (min. 120.4 cm SI) long and 1.5 cubits (min. 72.24 cm SI) wide, which are the dimensions of the Ark of the Covenant (according to the Book of Exodus).\n\nThe Mishnah gives the height of the rock as three thumb-breadths (min. 6 cm SI) above the ground. Radbaz discusses the apparent contradiction of the Mishnah’s measurements and the actual measurement of the rock within the Dome he estimates as a “height of two men” above the ground. He concluded that many changes in the natural configuration of the Temple Mount have taken place which can be attributed to excavations made by the various occupiers of Jerusalem since the Second Temple construction.\n\nThis is the holiest site in Judaism. Jews all over the world pray towards the Foundation Stone.\n\nThe Roman-Era midrash \"Tanhuma\" sums up the centrality of and holiness of this site in Judaism:\n\nAccording to the sages of the Talmud, it was from this rock that the world was created, itself being the first part of the Earth to come into existence. In the words of the \"Zohar\", \"The world was not created until God took a stone called \"Even haShetiya\" and threw it into the depths where it was fixed from above till below, and from it the world expanded. It is the centre point of the world and on this spot stood the Holy of Holies.\"\n\nAccording to the Talmud, it was close to here, on the site of the altar, that God gathered the earth that was formed into Adam. It was on this rock that Adam—and later Cain and Abel and Noah—offered sacrifices to God. Jewish sources identify this rock as the place of the Binding of Isaac mentioned in the Bible, where Abraham fulfilled God's test to see if he would be willing to sacrifice his son. The mountain is identified as Moriah in Genesis 22. It is also identified as the rock upon which Jacob dreamt about angels ascending and descending on a ladder and consequently consecrating and offering a sacrifice upon..\n\nWhen, according to the Bible, King David purchased a threshing floor owned by Araunah the Jebusite, it is believed that it was upon this rock that he offered the sacrifice mentioned in the verse. He wanted to construct a permanent temple there, but as his hands were \"bloodied\", he was forbidden to do so himself. The task was left to his son Solomon, who completed the Temple in c. 950 BCE.\n\nThe Mishnah in tractate Yoma mentions a stone situated in the Holy of Holies that was called \"Shetiya\" and had been revealed by the early prophets (i.e. David and Samuel.).\n\nAn early Christian source noting Jewish attachment to the rock may be found in the \"Itinerarium Burdigalense\", written between 333–334 CE when Jerusalem was under Roman rule, which describes a \"perforated stone to which the Jews come every year and anoint it, bewail themselves with groans, rend their garments, and so depart.\"\n\nSituated inside the Holy of Holies, this was the rock upon which the Ark of the Covenant was placed in Solomon's Temple. During the Second Temple period when the Ark of the Covenant was not present, the stone was used by the High Priest who offered up the incense and sprinkled the blood of the sacrifices on it during the Yom Kippur service.\n\nThe Jerusalem Talmud states:\nCiting this, the \"Mishnah Berurah\" rules that not only are women not to prepare or attach warp threads to a weaving loom, but it is forbidden for anyone to make, buy or wear new clothes or shoes from the beginning of the week in which Tisha B'Av falls until after the fast, and that people should ideally not do so from the beginning of Av.\n\nIn further commemoration of the Foundation Stone, it is also forbidden to eat meat or drink wine from the beginning of the week in which Tisha B'av falls until after the fast. Some have the custom to refrain from these foodstuffs from Rosh Chodesh Av, while others do so from the Seventeenth of Tammuz.\n\nIn the days when Selichot are recited, in the days leading up to Rosh Hashanah until Yom Kippur, the supplications include the following references:\n\nDuring Sukkot, the following references to the Foundation Stone are mentioned in the Hoshanot recital:\n\nהושענא! – אבן שתיה – הושענא\n\n\"Please save! – Foundation Stone – Please save!\"\n\nהושענא! – תאדרנו באבן תלולה – הושענא\n\n\"Please save! – Adorn us with the elevated Stone – Please save!\"\n\nThe Temple Mount, where the Foundation Stone is located, is thought by commentators of the Qur'an to be the place to which Muhammad traveled in the Night Journey. Although the Qur'an does not specifically mention Jerusalem in name as the ascension site, labelling the site as the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the Hadith, the recorded sayings of Muhammad, specify that the site is indeed the Foundation Stone in Jerusalem. According to Islamic belief, angels visited the site 2,000 years before the creation of Adam. It is also thought to be the place where Israfil, the angel of the trumpet, will sound his horn on Resurrection Day.\n\nBeneath the Foundation Stone is a cavern known as the Well of Souls. It is sometimes thought of as the traditional hiding place of the Ark of the Covenant.\n\n"}

They are ascribed various and conflicting abilities, temperaments and appearances depending on the story and country of origin. They are almost always small and grotesque, mischievous or outright malicious, and greedy, especially for gold and jewelry. They often have magical abilities similar to a fairy or demon. Similar creatures include brownies, dwarfs, duendes, gnomes, imps, and kobolds.\n\nAlternative spellings include \"gobblin\", \"gobeline\", \"gobling\", \"goblyn\", \"goblino\", and \"gobbelin\"\n\nEnglish \"goblin\" is first recorded in the 14th century and is probably from unattested Anglo-Norman \"*gobelin\", similar to Old French \"gobelin\", already attested around 1195 in Ambroise of Normandy's \"Guerre sainte\", and to Medieval Latin \"gobelinus\" in Orderic Vitalis before 1141, which was the name of a devil or daemon haunting the country around Évreux, Normandy.\n\nIt may be related both to German \"kobold\" and to Medieval Latin \"cabalus\", or \"*gobalus\", itself from Greek κόβαλος (\"kobalos\"), \"rogue\", \"knave\", \"imp\", \"goblin\". Alternatively, it may be a diminutive or other derivative of the French proper name \"Gobel\", more often \"Gobeau\", diminutive forms \"Gobelet, Goblin, Goblot\", but their signification is probably \"somebody who sells tumblers or beakers or cups\". Moreover, these proper names are not from Normandy, where the word \"gobelin, gobelinus\" first appears in the old documents. German \"Kobold\" contains the Germanic root \"kov-\" (Middle German \"Kobe\" \"refuge, cavity\", \"hollow in a rock\", Dial. English \"cove\" \"hollow in a rock\", English \"sheltered recess on a coast\", Old Norse \"kofi\" \"hut, shed\" ) which means originally a \"hollow in the earth\". The word is probably related to Dial. Norman \"gobe\" \"hollow in a cliff\", with simple suffix \"-lin\" or double suffixation \"-el-in\" (cf. Norman surnames \"Beuzelin\", \"Gosselin\", \"Étancelin\", etc.)\n\nThe Welsh \"coblyn\", a type of knocker, derives from the Old French \"gobelin\" via the English \"goblin\".\n\nThe term goblette has been used to refer to female goblins.\n\n\nMany Asian lagyt creatures have been likened to, or translated as, goblins.

Although Hindus and Sikhs have been living peacefully for centuries, apostates are not seen kindly. Apostates, including atheists, are considered safe if they were brought up as Muslim and do not make their beliefs public. Apostates are usually disowned by their families.

His mastaba (named \"Saqqara C8\") was discovered by Auguste Mariette in the Saqqara necropolis, just north of the Step Pyramid of Djoser. During the excavation, the Egyptian diggers unearthed the statue and, apparently impressed by its exceptional realism, they called it \"Sheikh el-Beled\" (Arabic for \"Headman of the village\") likely because of a certain similarity between the statue and their local elder. The statue – located in the Cairo Egyptian Museum, CG 34 – is tall and carved from sycamore wood, and depicts the corpulent Kaaper while walking with a staff. The statue's round, peaceful face is almost lifelike thanks to the eyes, which were made using rock crystal and small copper plates; it is often cited as an example of the remarkable level of craftmanship and realism achieved during the late 4th Dynasty.

His specialisation is in comparative studies of Hindu scriptures and literature with Islamic literature. He stays in Delhi.\n\nAfter retirement from the Jamaat he is engaged in translation of rare Islamic manuscripts into the Hindi language. Recently he has translated Bukhari in three volumes. He belongs to the famous Deobandi Muslim family of Maulana Husain Ahmad Madani.\n\nKausar Yazdani was born 1935 in Katalpur, Azamgarh district of Uttar Pradesh. His father was in the police department and retired when he was studying in class VII. He did his metrication in 1951, BA in 1955 from Shibli College and married in his own family in same year. Then he entered in the practical life.\n\nHe completed his graduation from Shibli College, Azamgarh, and Masters and doctorate of philosophy (PhD) in the Hindi language from Agra University. He is also completed Aalimiat from Sunni Muslim seminary called Nadwatul Ulema, Lucknow, and Fazeelat from Rampur.\n\nThe topic of his PhD was Sufi Darshan evam Sadhna ka Kramik Vikas tatha Kutban, Manjhan evam Jaysee. (Development of Mysticism in Hindi with reference to the Poetry of Kutban, Manjhan and Jaysee).\n\nYazdani came into the contact of Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH), when he was in Intermediate at Tanda. Jamaat was writing new chapters in Islamic dawah and awakening for non-Muslims as well as Muslims. He learnt, Islam is for everybody. Yazdani, whose subject in BA was not Hindi, chose Hindi journalism as his lifelong career under the influence of the Islamic movement. At that time, Muslims of north India had a hate relationship with Hindi. Urdu had not become their preferred language but it was crushed just after the Independence. It is a historical fact that Urdu was vastly used in government and non-government works before 1947. But its use stopped in government offices, its teaching banned in schools and other educational institutions and it was labelled as anti-Indian. It place was given to Hindi, which was finally declared the official language of the province in 1951 by Congress government in UP, under its chief minister Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant. But no reciprocal safeguard was given to Urdu language. Yazdani chose Hindi as his first love.\n\nJamaat decided to publish a Hindi magazine and called him for the job in 1956-7. After some preparations 'Kanti' monthly started its publication in 1958. It became a weekly after a decade and changed its place of publication from Rampur to Delhi.\n\nWhen Nadvi joined the Kanti, he did not know the Arabic language. But as he chose the dawah path, he decided to learn Arabic and studied the language from Maulana Salman Qasmi at Rampur. Then he took three years leave to study Arabic and Islamic sciences at Nadwa College, Lucknow. Jamaat chief Maulana Abul lais allowed him to work from Lucknow and granted him the required leave. Maulana Syed Abul Hasan Ali Nadvi gave special permission to enroll him for Almiat. He cleared all the papers in one year and got Almiat degree. Later he completed his Fazilat at Rampur. Kanti was banned during emergency and its editor was jailed for few months. In this critical period he did his MA in Hindi Literature and a PhD in 1980. His thesis was on Sufism and Sadhna. Kanti was divided into weekly and monthly in the same year. Weekly was generally for Muslims and monthly was for non-Muslims. But according to Nadvi, its readership were prominently Muslims, although non-Muslims also read it.\n\nHe remained its editor for about 37 years and left it in 1995. Nadvi told us that 'generally Hindus have a little or no interest for understanding Islam. We reached them and explained its message'. So its circulation in his time remained between 3 and 5 thousands. It published extracts from the Quran and Hadith, episodes from Islamic history and true principles of Islam. It also tried to remove misunderstandings against Islam and Muslims. It had one or two short stories. After 1968, political and social issues increased considerably. Then it became a weekly. To a query, whether Kanti criticised Hindu Dharam also former editor replied that we criticised very little and never made such criticism a formal topic. 'It was not appropriate in the early phase of Dawah'. Islam's fundamental teachings were introduced in a positive way, polytheism was mildly criticised. If reverse was done, it could have caused a riot and then nobody would have heard our message, he explained. He concluded that when Islam would be described in more details, in the next phase of our dawah, such criticism may increase, then it would be relevant.\n\nHe was not just a journalist or writer, but an active worker and a leader also. He became chief of J. I. H. (Delhi & Haryana State) in 1979 and remained so till 1995. At that time, he used to start his day before morning prayers (salat Fajr), read daily newspaper and wrote editorial, etc. Later, he worked for the Kanti till about 1 o'clock. After 3 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon, to 11 in the night, he spent his time, visiting different places of Delhi & Haryana for Dawah and Islamic awakening. It was his daily routine. In 1995 he was called to central office of the Jamaat as its all India secretary to look after the Dawah work from which he just retired. As his health deteriorated, he spent most of his time at his residence at Abul Fazl Enclave in New Delhi. He has three sons and one daughter. His wife died in 1990.\n\nNadvi translated about 40 books in Hindi and wrote a dozen books. He also wrote more than 500 articles published in different national and international journals and magazines.\n\n"}

He is also the Chief Education Officer of the Ethics and Performance Institute which delivers web-based ethics education to corporations and individuals. He is also President of the Spitzer Center of Ethical Leadership, which delivers similar curricula to non-profit organizations.\n\nMagis Institute originally was created to be only a center for Catholic spirituality. In 2008, Father Spitzer and his associates at Magis considered how they might offer a reasoned, scientific alternative viewpoint to those publicly expressed by \"new atheism\" writers such as Christopher Hitchins and Richard Dawkins. As a result of these conversations, Father Spitzer began the Magis Center for Reason and Faith to provide a framework for the creation and distribution of materials expressing this alternative viewpoint.\n\nOn 3 September 2010, the Catholic News Agency featured Magis founder Father Spitzer in their response to the announcement of Stephen Hawking's new book touching on the subject of the origins of the universe.

During World War I, Baring served in the Intelligence Corps and Royal Air Force.\n\nBaring was the eighth child, and fifth son, of Edward Charles Baring, first Baron Revelstoke, of the Baring banking family, and his wife Louisa Emily Charlotte Bulteel, granddaughter of the second Earl Grey. Born in Mayfair, he was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. After an abortive start of a diplomatic career, he travelled widely, particularly in Russia. He reported as an eye-witness of the Russo-Japanese War for the London \"Morning Post\".\n\nAt the start of World War I he joined the Royal Flying Corps, where he served as assistant to David Henderson and Hugh Trenchard in France. In 1918, Baring served as a staff officer in the Royal Air Force and was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1918 Birthday Honours. In 1925 Baring received an honorary commission as a wing commander in the Reserve of Air Force Officers. After his death, Trenchard wrote, \"He was the most unselfish man I have ever met or am likely to meet. The Flying Corps owed to this man much more than they know or think.\"\n\nAfter the war he enjoyed a period of success as a dramatist, and began to write novels. He suffered from chronic illness during the last years of his life; for the final 15 years of his life he was debilitated by Parkinson's Disease.\n\nHe was widely known socially, to some of the Cambridge Apostles, to The Coterie, and to the literary group associating with G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc in particular. He was staunch in his anti-intellectualism with respect to the arts, and a convinced practical joker.\n\nPreviously an agnostic, he converted to Roman Catholicism in 1909, \"the only action in my life which I am quite certain I have never regretted.\" Speaking from personal experience, however, he once advised Belloc to \"never, never, never talk theology or discuss the Church with those outside it. People simply do not understand what you are talking about and they merely (a) get angry and (b) come to the conclusion that one doesn't believe in the thing oneself and that one is simply doing it to annoy.\"\n\nBaring is remembered in verse in \"Belloc's Cautionary Verses:\"\n\n\"Like many of the upper class\"<br>\n\"He liked the sound of broken glass*\"<br>\n\"* A line I stole with subtle daring\"<br>\n\"From Wing-Commander Maurice Baring\"\n\nHe once gave Virginia Woolf a copy of his book \"C\".

{"id": "42512927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42512927", "title": "Miss World riots", "text": "Miss World riots\n\nThe Miss World riots were a series of religiously-motivated riots in the Nigerian city of Kaduna in November 2002, claiming the lives of more than 200 people. The Miss World beauty pageant, that was controversial in Nigeria, was relocated to London after bloody clashes between Muslims and Christians, caused by what some Muslims deemed to be a \"blasphemous\" article in the Christian newspaper \"ThisDay\" about the event. The Miss World riots were part of the Sharia conflict in Nigeria, that started in 1999 when several predominantly Islamic states in Northern Nigeria decided to introduce Sharia law.\n\nBecause the 2001 contest was won by the Nigerian Agbani Darego, Miss World 2002 would take place in (and be aired from) the Nigerian capital Abuja. In the run-up to the pageant there were many controversies, like the fact that it coincided with the Muslim holy month of ramadan, and the whole beauty contest was perceived by many conservative Muslims and also Christians to be unchaste. The organisation conceded to the first complaint by moving the event from the end of November to 7 December, but did not act on the second complaint. In several places, especially in the mostly Muslim North, peaceful protests were held against conducting Miss World in Nigeria. Feminists argued the pageant was too sexist because it merely considered women's beauty and paid no attention to intelligence and character; the organisation conceded to them by altering the swimsuit parade to a photo shoot.\n\nHowever, conservative Islamic groups turned even more strongly against the Miss World organisation when it took a stand in the case of the Nigerian woman Amina Lawal. Amina had been condemned to death by stoning by a regional Islamic court because of alleged adultery. First, Miss Côte d'Ivoire Yannick Azébian and Miss Norway Kathrine Sørland indicated at the end of August 2002 that they would boycott the beauty contest; other Misses expressed their doubts as well. Miss Belgium, Denmark, France and Spain too decided to stay away, Miss Holland ignored calls to do so; the chairman of the Miss Holland opined: \"Then you are actually giving the people in the North what they want. They are stopping an event which is 'perverse' in their eyes and are just continuing their ridiculous legislation.\" Other Misses also found that exactly by showing up in Abuja they could make a statement against conservative beliefs about women. Civil rights activists eventually were able to persuade the Miss World organisation as a whole to plead for the release of Amina Lawal to the Nigerian federal authorities, eventually convincing them to promise that the stoning would not be permitted.\n\nAfter this, a column appeared in the Lagos-based Christian newspaper \"ThisDay\" on Saturday 16 November, in which journalist Isioma Daniel wrote that the Islamic prophet Muhammad would probably have approved of the Miss World competition: 'The Muslims thought it was immoral to bring ninety-two women to Nigeria and ask them to revel in vanity. What would Mohammed think? In all honesty, he would probably have chosen a wife from one of them.' This sparked outrage among some Muslims, and from 20 till 23 November the city of Kaduna was the stage of bloody riots between Muslims and Christians. Two years earlier, Kaduna had already seen violent Christian-Muslim clashes. Many inhabitants had a strong sense of injustice because none of the perpetrators had been prosecuted afterwards. Moreover, the riots had caused Christians and Muslims to concentrate and isolate themselves in separate districts. The \"ThisDay\" incident caused latent tensions in the religiously-divided city to erupt.\n\nOn 26 November, Islamic clerics from Zamfara State issued a fatwa against the journalist Isioma Daniel for insulting the prophet. The fatwa constituted a death sentence, and all Muslims worldwide were called on to murder her. In a statement that was later broadcast on local radio, the deputy governor Mamuda Aliyu Shinkafi of Zamfara declared: \"Like Salman Rushdie, the blood of Isioma Daniel can be shed. It is binding on all Muslims wherever they are to consider the killing of the writer as a religious duty.\" The federal government of Nigeria rejected the fatwa, and it was declared null and void by the relevant Saudi Arabian authorities.\n\nThe Kaduna riots claimed the lives of about 250 people, mostly men and boys; 20,000 to 30,000 people lost their homes. More than 1,000 people were arrested on suspicion of inciting or partaking in the violence. The Committee to Protect Journalists and Amnesty International eventually helped Daniel to go in exile in Europe, because it was too dangerous for her to return to Nigeria. Among those killed were the parents of Nigerian footballer and international, Victor Moses, who fled the country as a result.\n\nAmina Lawal, who was very thankful to the Misses for their concern about her fate, but who had spoken out against a boycott (just before the riots broke out), was eventually acquitted on 25 September 2003. Upon the pageant's return to England, many of the boycotting contestants chose to attend, including Miss Norway, Kathrine Sørland, who was ironically tipped in the last few days as the number one favourite for the crown she had previously boycotted. The competition was eventually won by the Turkish Azra Akin; she was the second and at present last Miss World from a Muslim-majority country (the first being the Egyptian Antigone Costanda in 1954).\n\n"}
{"id": "10614069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10614069", "title": "Paritta", "text": "Paritta\n\nParitta (Pali), generally translated as \"protection\" or \"safeguard,\" refers to the Buddhist practice of reciting certain verses and scriptures in order to ward off misfortune or danger, as well as to the specific verses and discourses recited as paritta texts. The practice of reciting or listening to the paritta suttas began very early in the history of Buddhism.\n\nIn the Pali literature, these short verses are recommended by the Buddha as providing protection from certain afflictions. The belief in the effective power to heal, or protect, of the \"sacca-kiriya\", or asseveration of something quite true is an aspect of the work ascribed to the \"paritta\".\n\nIt is also widely believed that all night recitations of paritta by monks bring safety, peace and well-being to a community. Such recitations will also occur on auspicious occasions, such as the inauguration of a new temple or home or to provide blessings upon those who hear. Conversely, paritta discourses are recited on inauspicious occasions as well, such as at a funeral or on the death anniversary of a loved one. They may also be recited to placate antagonistic spirits.\n\nThere are several paritta verses that are identified as such within the Pali Canon.\n\nMost paritta involve offering praise to the Buddha or, more broadly, the Triple Gem (Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha). Of these paritta, one of the best known is the Ratana Sutta (Sn 2.1) where, for instance, it states in part:\n\nA few paritta involve the asking directly for the aid of the Buddha. Examples of this type of paritta verse can be seen in the Candima Sutta (SN 2.9) and Suriya Sutta (SN 2.10) of the Samyutta Nikaya. In these two scriptures, the deities Canda and Surya protect themselves from the attack of the eclipse deity Rahu by reciting short verses praising the Buddha and pleading for his protection:\nIn these cases, the Buddha is shown as specifically hearing and responding to the paritta; he enjoins Rahu to release the captive deities rather than have his \"head split into seven pieces\".\n\nAnother type of paritta relies on the virtue of the individual who is ascribed as reciting the paritta in the Canon, rather than making reference to the virtues of the Buddha. This type of paritta can be seen in the Angulimala Sutta, the story of the murderer-turned-monk Angulimala. On passing a pregnant woman experiencing a difficult labor, Angulimala is moved to provide assistance. Asking the Buddha how he can help, the Buddha tells him to provide a sort of blessing to the woman by reciting a short verse proclaiming his own virtue:\nSister, since I was born in the noble birth, I do not recall intentionally killing a living being. Through this truth may there be wellbeing for you, wellbeing for your fetus.\nThis verse is now used as a blessing for expectant mothers in the Theravada Buddhist tradition.\n\nThe Buddha and the arahants (the Consummate Ones) can concentrate on the paritta suttas without the aid of another. However, when they are ill, it is easier for them to listen to what others recite, and thus focus their minds on the dhamma that the suttas contain, rather than think of the dhamma by themselves. There are occasions, as in the case of illness, which weaken the mind (in the case of worldlings), when hetero-suggestion has been found to be more effective than autosuggestion. In the \"Gilana Sutta\", even the Buddha Himself had the Seven Factors of Enlightenment recited to him by another monk to recover from a grave illness.\n\nWhile paritta texts generally are recited aloud, other mediums are known as well. In Thailand, paritta texts are printed on small pieces of cloth containing images of the Buddha or famous monks. Similar text- often in the Khom script- is sometimes incorporated into tattoos believed to have protective powers, known as Sak Yant.\n\nParitta discourses are widely used and known, even if not necessarily understood, throughout the Theravada Buddhist world. Popular collections of paritta verses are among the most widely known Pali texts in many Theravada countries.\n\nAn example of such a collection is the Sinhala \"Pirit Potha\" (\"The Book of Protection\"), also known as \"Maha Pirit Potha\" and the \"Catubhanavarapali\" (\"Text of the Four Recitals\"). It has also been referred to as \"The Buddhist Bible.\" This collection is typically given an important place in the Buddhist home, and is even treated with veneration. The book contains a collection of twenty-four or twenty-nine discourses (\"suttas\") almost all delivered by the Buddha, and found scattered in the five original collections (\"nikayas\") in Pali, which form the Sutta Pitaka, the \"Canonical Discourses.\" Below, these discourses and related canonical sources are identified.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "212368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=212368", "title": "Pierre Leroux", "text": "Pierre Leroux\n\nPierre Henri Leroux (7 April 1797 – 12 April 1871), French philosopher, and political economist, was born at Bercy, now a part of Paris, the son of an artisan.\n\nHis education was interrupted by the death of his father, which compelled him to support his mother and family. Having worked first as a mason and then as a compositor, he joined P. Dubois in the foundation of \"Le Globe\" which became in 1831 the official organ of the Saint-Simonian community, of which he became a prominent member. In November of the same year, when Prosper Enfantin became leader of the Saint-Simonians and preached the enfranchisement of women and the functions of the \"couple-prétre\", Leroux separated himself from the sect. In 1834 he published an essay entitled \"Individualism and Socialism\" which, despite its message of scepticism towards both tendencies, introduced the term socialism in French political discourse. In 1838, with Jean Reynaud, who had seceded with him, he founded the \"Encyclopédie nouvelle\" (eds. 1838-1841). Amongst the articles which he inserted in it were \"De l'egalité\" and \"Refutation de l'éclectisme\", which afterwards appeared as separate works.\nIn 1840 he published his treatise \"De l'humanité\" (2nd ed. 1845), which contains the fullest exposition of his system, and was regarded as the philosophical manifesto of the Humanitarians. In 1841 he established the \"Revue indépendante\", with the aid of George Sand, over whom he had great influence. Her \"Spiridion\", which was dedicated to him, \"Sept cordes de la lyre\", \"Consuelo\", and \"La Comtesse de Rudolstadt\", were written under the Humanitarian inspiration. Leroux also became embroiled in the philosophical controversy between F.W.J. Schelling and the Young Hegelians in the early 1840s. A favourable comment about Schelling prompted a public reply from Hegel's disciple Karl Rosenkranz. Leroux continued to take an interest in German philosophy and literature; he also translated and commented on some writings by Goethe.\n\nIn 1843 he established at Boussac (Creuse) a printing association organized according to his systematic ideas, and founded the \"Revue sociale\". In 1848 he joined the Freemasons. At the outbreak of the Revolution of 1848 Leroux proclaimed the republic in the town of Boussac, becoming its mayor on February 25. Subsequently he was elected to the Constituent Assembly, and in 1849 to the Legislative Assembly, where he sat with the radical socialist deputies and often spoke, though his speeches were criticised as abstract and mystical. He also published numerous writings, including \"La Plutocratie\" (1848), another term he seems to have coined.\n\nAn opponent of Louis Bonaparte, Leroux went into exile after the \"coup d'état\" of 1851, settling with his family in Jersey, where he pursued agricultural experiments and wrote his socialist poem \"La Grève de Samarez\". Marx nominated Leroux for the Central Committee of the International Workingmen's Association. On the definitive amnesty of 1869 he returned to Paris. He supported the Paris Commune but died before its suppression.\n\nLeroux' thought is a unique medley of doctrines borrowed from Saint-Simonian, German Idealist, Pythagorean and Buddhistic sources. His fundamental philosophical principle is that of what he calls the \"triad\"—a triplicity which he finds to pervade all things, which in God is \"power, intelligence and love,\" in man \"sensation, sentiment and knowledge\".\n\nHis religious doctrine is pantheistic; and, rejecting the belief in a future life as commonly conceived, he substitutes for it a theory of metempsychosis. In social economy he preserves the family, country and property, but finds in all three, as they now are, a despotism which must be eliminated. He imagines certain combinations by which this triple tyranny can be abolished. His solution seems to require the creation of families without heads, countries without governments and property without right of possession. In politics he advocates absolute equality — a democracy.\n\nLeroux's significance in the history of ideas lies in his attempt to resuscitate spirituality and community in France in the wake of the revolutionary decades of the 1790s and the Napoleonic Era. As was the case with many of his romantic socialist contemporaries, Leroux sought a basis on which to refound the human community that did not rely on the pillars of the old Regime, authority, hierarchy, and the Catholic Church. The span of his lifetime were years of the rise of capitalism and liberal trade policies, and also of the rise of an organized workers' movement. Romantic socialism as a movement attempted to reconcile religious and material needs in society. Leroux' most thorough exposition of this idea is found in his \"Doctrine de l'Humanité\", published first in 1840. In this and other works he argues for a reciprocal notion of human need and identity, emphasizing humanity's interdependence in lieu of atomized individuality.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "708276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=708276", "title": "Praxis (Byzantine Rite)", "text": "Praxis (Byzantine Rite)\n\nPraxis, a transliteration of the Greek word πρᾶξις (derived from the stem of the verb πράσσειν, \"prassein\" \"to do, to act\"), means \"practice, action, doing\". More particularly, it means either:\n\nEastern Christian writers, especially those in the Byzantine tradition, use the term \"praxis\" to refer to what others, using an English rather than a Greek word, call practice of the faith, especially with regard to ascetic and liturgical life.\n\nPraxis is a key to understanding the Byzantine tradition, which is observed by the Eastern Orthodox Church and some Eastern Catholic Churches. This is because praxis is the basis of the understanding of faith and works as conjoint, without separating the two. The importance of praxis, in the sense of action, is indicated in the dictum of Saint Maximus the Confessor: \"Theology without action is the theology of demons.\"\n\nUnion with God, to which Christians hold that Jesus invited man, requires not just faith, but correct practice of faith. This idea is found in the Scriptures (1 Cor 11:2,\n2 Thes 2:14) and the Church Fathers, and is linked with the term \"praxis\" in Byzantine theology and vocabulary. In the context of Orthodoxy, praxis is mentioned opposite theology, in the sense of 'theory and practice'. Rather, it is a word that means, globally, all that Orthodox \"do\". Praxis is 'living Orthodoxy'.\n\nPraxis is perhaps most strongly associated with worship. \"Orthopraxis\" is said to mean \"right glory\" or \"right worship\"; only correct (or proper) practice, particularly correct worship, is understood as establishing the fulness glory given to God. This is one of the primary purposes of liturgy (divine labor), the work of the people. Some Byzantine sources maintain that in the West, Christianity has been reduced \"to intellectual, ethical or social categories,\" whereas right worship is fundamentally important in our relationship to God, forming the faithful into the Body of Christ and providing the path to \"true religious education.\" A \"symbiosis of worship and work\" is considered to be inherent in Byzantine praxis.\n\nFasting, another key part of the practice of the Christian faith, is mentioned as part of Byzantine praxis, in connection with the Sermon on the Mount (Mt 6), and in comparison with the history and commemorations of Lenten fasts.\n\nPraxis may also refer to proper religious etiquette.\n\nIn the Latin Church, parallel ideas of asceticism and worship exist. The word used in this regard is the regular English word \"practice\", since in English the term \"praxis\" is not normally used in this sense.\n\nThe simplest and most common understanding of the term \"practising Catholic\", a minimal interpretation of the phrase, is that the person has been baptized (or canonically received into full communion with the Catholic Church) and strives to observe the Church's precept of attending celebration of the Mass or Divine Liturgy on Sundays and holy days of obligation. Someone who does not fulfil even this minimum requirement for being considered \"practising\" is referred to as a lapsed Catholic.\n\nA more ample indication of what practice involves is given in a statement by Bishop Luc Matthys of Armidale, New South Wales, Australia. Living the Catholic faith involves much more than the minimum requirements referred to above.\n\nMatters such as fasting have applications that vary according to place and according to the autonomous particular Church to which a person belongs. In each of the Eastern Catholic Churches, practice is generally the same as in the associated Eastern Church with which it is not in full communion. Thus, practice in the Eastern Catholic Churches of Byzantine Rite is identical with that described above for the Churches that constitute the Eastern Orthodox Church, but differs from that of, for instance, the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church. Within the Latin Church too, there are variations in such matters in accordance with rules laid down by the episcopal conferences in view of local conditions and traditions.\n\nIn English the word \"praxis\" is more commonly used in the sense not of practice but with the meaning given to it by Immanuel Kant, namely application of a theory to cases encountered in experience or reasoning about what there should be as opposed to what there is: this meaning Karl Marx made central to his philosophical ideal of transforming the world through revolutionary activity. Inspired by Marxism, proponents of Latin American liberation theology have used the word \"praxis\" with specific reference to human activity directed towards transforming the conditions and causes of poverty. Their \"liberation theology\" consists then in applying the Gospel to that praxis to guide and govern it.\n\n"}
{"id": "27623079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27623079", "title": "Presumption of priestly descent", "text": "Presumption of priestly descent\n\nThe presumption of priestly descent (or presumed kohen or status-quo kohen) in Judaism is the attribution to a kohen of equivalent position as if there was proven descent from the priestly family of Aaron. This is evidenced not by genealogical records but by \"de facto\" priestly behavior as defined in rabbinical halakhic texts.\n\nIn the Land of Israel it was the raising up of hands in the priestly benediction, and sharing heave offering at the threshing floor, whereas in Syria and Babylonia the raising up of hands constituted adequate grounds, but not sharing heave offering at the threshing floor as stated in the Jerusalem Talmud Ketubot 2:7 and other texts.\n\nThe \"presumed kohen\" (\"kohen mukhzaq\") (, from חזק) is a rabbinic title which legitimates kohen status to a kohen who—among multiple criteria—exhibits conduct exemplary of and is recognized by his peers and community as such.\n\nThe tannaitic rabbi Jose ben Halafta extolled the soundness of the said \"presumption\" (\"chazakah\") by calling it a basis for the entire halakhic concept of \"chazakah\" (B.Ketubot 24b). It is based on this presumption that all \"poskim\" agree, unanimously, to forbid presumptive kohanim from marrying a divorcee. Of note is that from among the opinions of the Acharonim, the mentioned presumption is given the title \"a sound presumption\".\n\nAccording to Maimonides, once he is established as a presumptive kohen it is a commandment to sanctify the kohen and assist him in abstaining from the prohibitions that apply to a kohen. Maimonides considered that presumption of the kohen is deemed valid and in good standing unless a valid objection to his lineage is made before a Beit Din.\n\nFrom the time of Aaron being chosen as High Priest up to the times of the Babylonian exile the lineage of a kohen was taken as matter-of-fact. This changed by the onset of the Jewish nation's returning from Babylonian exile and the building of the temple anew. This national revival created a call for the kohanim to do their necessary priestly duty on the temple. However, due to the occurrence of intermarriage among the returnees in general and the kohanim as well, the need to ascertain that each kohen was lineage verifiable as being a male descendant, 'son after son', also termed 'a paternal grandchild', of Aaron the High Priest and \"kosher\" in the literal sense; \"in line\" with the directives of the Law', for example not an offspring of a forbidden marriage such as if a kohen were to marry a divorcee where the child would be disqualified from the priesthood.\n\nThis necessity created an investigation ordered by Nehemiah that produced the first recorded investigation questioning the authenticity of apparently legitimate kohanim:\nBy first glance at the above verse it is understood that the mentioned families were rejected entirely from all duties and privileges exclusive to the kohanim. However, the Tanna Rabbi Yossi adopted a more analytical approach based on the following verse:\nBased on the latter verse making explicit what these persons may not eat from the most holy things it is apparent that consumption of simply holy things was allowed. Yossi gives the opinion that since the investigated families had prior to the investigation consumed only offerings from outside the Holy Land, from the point of investigative results and onward they were permitted to eat from offerings of the Land of Israel (Ketubot 24b). He further explains that offerings from outside the Holy Land are prohibited to a non-kohen based on rabbinic command whereas offerings from the Holy Land are prohibited to a non-kohen by a direct Biblical directive. From the apparent unpleasant narrated event of the Beit Din of Nehemiah questioning the legitimacy of the mentioned Kohanic family, Yossi extracted the positive factor of the strength of the Chazakah form of ownership.\n\nYossi understood this from the fact that not only did Nehemiah allow the said kohanic family to consume the \"Terumah\" from outside of the Land of Israel but also allowed them to consume \"Terumah\" from Israel itself—an act punishable by death if performed by a non-kohen.\n\nAs to why the investigators of Nehemiah were suspicious that the priestly family of the children of Chavaya were not qualified to function as kohanim is a matter of Talmudic and rabbinic debate.\n\nThe author of \"Avodah Tamma\" points out that this family was known to be descendants of Aaron for certain, the suspicion was that these male children were offspring of a woman forbidden to a kohen for marriage.\n\nThe Talmud Yerushalmi explains that Barzilai himself was a Jew, but his daughters were not born Jewish but converted before being three years of age, posing a (rabbinic) problem to a kohen marrying those daughters.\n\nIn discussing the reason as to why the verse chooses to penn the known lineage of the questioned kohanim as being descendants of Barzilai the Gileadite, the 13th century Talmudic scholar, Menachem Meiri points out the wording of the verse transmit a unique message.\n\nBarzilai the Gileadite, explained the Meiri, was reputed by Talmudic scholars to be a person of excessive sexual indulgence. Additionally, Barzilai was suspected as a common liar and entirely not versed in Torah law. These facts, Menachem concludes, is why the verse chose to tell us this seemingly unimportant detail, since it was who these kohanim chose to marry that was the source of the unpleasant outcome of being the subject of investigation.\n\nIn any case both according to Talmud Bavli and Yerushalmi, the root cause for suspicion of these kohanim was only \"MiDirabbanan\", and therefor at the conclusion of the investigation this Kohanic family was permitted to consume \"Terumah\".\n\nAs to the essential content of the lineage document—and its general appearance—little information is given by the Talmud. This being contrary to other Rabbinic documents that are described at somewhat greater length, for example the Ketubah, the Get, various business documents (Shtarei Kinyan), and the document of freedom for a bondsman (Shtar Shichrur).\n\nRashi, in his Torah commentary mentions that when the congregation of Israel were required to ascertain their lineage to join their respective tribe, this document was brought in tandem with the testifying of witnesses. In the book of Divrei HaYamim, the lineage document is usually cited in relation to the soldiers of Israel joining their respective legions based on their patrilineal tribe.\n\nYair Bacharach noted that the lineage document was not commonly used by kohanim. To be deemed eligible for Kohanic service, explained Yair, is sufficient that two Kosher witnesses testify that the said kohen is of legitimate lineage. The Tur Shulchan Aruch follows a similar tone by stating that to be eligible for Kohanic service on the Mizbeach two witnesses is sufficient. According to the opinion of the Avodah Tamma, the option was available for the incoming kohen to either produce his lineage document or have two Kosher witnesses testify to his authenticity as a kohen.\n\nAs to whom was appointed to verify the lineage of the kohanim during this pre-temple era is a matter of debate. The Mishnah state that, as part of the Great Beit Din, there was a branch-commission occupied exclusively with this investigative task. While the Sifri and Babylonian Talmud point out that it was a commission of kohanim themselves that investigated the legitimacy of fellow kohanim.\n\nWith the destruction of the Second Temple and the Jews entry to exile hard-copy lineage recording was lost. In its stead came the actions exclusive to kohanim and the absence of a disqualifying objection in Beit Din that expressed that one was a legitimate kohen.\n\nBased on a lengthy and highly-analytical responsum by the composer of the Sdei Chemed, Rabbi Chaim Hezekiah Medini concluded that the modern \"Kohen Muchzak\" is considered a valid and true kohen for all purposes that a kohen is to fulfill.\n\nThe source of questioning the legitimacy of kohanim is rooted in a single responsum of Isaac ben Sheshet. This fourteenth-century responsum deals with a letter to Rabbi Yitzchok detailing an event where an individual publicly humiliated a kohen. The query was as to whether it is halachic to impose an increased monetary fine to the humiliator since the subjected was a kohen, or to suffice with the standard fine afforded a non-kohen.\n\nRabbi Yitzchok responded that \"Although it is halacha that he who humiliates another by use of words is not liable, one who embarrasses a Kohen should be publicly rebuked and subject to request forgiveness from and to appease the Kohen — so long as the Kohen exhibits conduct expected from a son of Aaron\". Isaac ben Sheshet continued and negated amplifying the penalty since the embarrassed kohen was not a learned Talmid Chacham kohen, but an unschooled am ha-aretz kohen. Ben Sheshet explained that even were the regular kohen to produce a lineage document certifying his direct lineage to Aaron the high priest the halachic ruling would stay, since it is found in the Talmud that the rabbis did not withhold from humiliating a \"lineage-verified kohen\" who was not well-versed in Torah (\"Am Haaretz\") all the more so today's kohen who cannot produce his lineage document does not receive an amplified penalty\". Of note is that the Shulchan Aruch (Tur Choshen Mishpat 420:24) rules that the humiliator of a kohen is liable to pay amplified compensation.\n\nIsaac ben Sheshet's words \"today's Kohen who cannot produce his lineage document\", which he intended on using as a sidebar explanation to his final ruling of standard compensation, over time evolved into an underpinning foundation for Poskim who sought to approve rabbinically-questionable marriages to a kohen.\n\nLeading Rabbinic authorities, such as Joseph Trani and Samuel Ashkenazi, disputed reliance on the Isaac ben Sheshet's response for purpose of questioning the authenticity of the kohen. They, as part of various proofs, cited reasoning from a latter response from Isaac ben Sheshet himself (Tshuvat HaRivash res. 348) where he is stringent that a kohen who married a divorcee is obligated to cease his marriage, thus proving the Isaac ben Sheshet's fundamental stance of upholding the legitimacy of the presumptive kohen.\n\nRabbi Samuel de Medina, in a response concerning a woman who was held captive as a young girl, ruled that a kohen is permitted to marry her. The logic, he explained, is one of a double uncertainty. One uncertainty being that we are unsure the woman was exposed to forced intimacy, which would disqualify the woman from marrying a kohen, and even where she have been the kohen is prohibited from wedding her only according to rabbinical decision. In addition, the Samuel de Medina wrote that he is unsure as to the authenticity of the modern kohen based on the response of the Isaac ben Sheshet.\n\nThis responsum of Samuel de Medina was met with a fiery reply from Ezekiel Katzenellenbogen;\n\nRabbinic authorities such as Joseph Trani have come to the defense of Samuel de Medina by stating that the case brought before his court was one of Rabbinic degree, and never would Samuel de Medina have permitted a marriage prohibited in the Hebrew Bible marriage to presumptive kohen. They cite, as proof, additional responsa of Samuel where he is stringent on a presumptive kohen from continued marriage to his wife due to only the possible but not certain receipt of a bill of divorce.\n\nThe opinion of Solomon Luria is somewhat obscure. On the one hand Luria opines with the advice to give the \"devoted things\", both land and goods, as one of the ten priestly gifts applicable outside of Israel, to a presumptive kohen, provided the estate owner of the devoted property explicitly states to give it to a kohen. Luria also encouraged the giving of shoulder, cheeks and maw to a presumptive kohen.\nHowever, Luria writes of the basic questioning of the kohen as legitimate due to upheaval of the Khmelnytsky Uprising, writing that this and similar upheavals utterly confused the entire lineage tracking of Jews subjected to persecution in Europe.\n\nLuria quotes a story where Hai ben Sherira, Hai Gaon practiced a \"minhag\" to travel to Jerusalem for Sukkot and circle the Temple Mount with hundreds of kohanim with the company of Elijah the Prophet. One year a student of his noticed rav Hai laughing during the procession, at the completion of the procession he queried his rabbi as to why, to which rav Hai responded that Elijah revealed to him that, from among the hundreds of kohanim that accompanied him in a haughty way, none were legitimate kohanim aside for one kohen who proceeded humbly.\n\nLuria although quoting the story as one \"known amongst the works of Rabbinic leaders\" was not one of great familiarity amongst rabbinic writers. The story was eventually traced by scholars to have originated in the Parma manuscript of Sefer Chasidim, a manuscript with multiple textual differences to the common edition of \"Sefer Chasidim.\" However, in addition to the story detail creating an anachronism of sorts in that the story portrays rav Hai and Evyathar Kohen-Tzedek as proceeding together in Jerusalem whereas they lived at separate times, some scholars have labeled the story as a Karaite forgery.\n\nOthers maintain that the story detail falls in line with the opinion spelled out by Hai Gaon in his letter to the priests of Djerba, where Hai expresses that humility is a proper virtue of the kohen and the kohen who does not possess this attribute is of questionable priestly lineage\n\nLuria's Talmudic explanation that put a damper on the legitimacy of Jewish priests was not readily accepted amongst some poskim. Some cited Luria's reasoning as \"a feeble enough reason\", while others validated Luria's reasoning solely outside of Israel. Some even went so far as to legitimize Luria's reasoning only to disqualify Ashkenazic priesthood while stating that Sephardic priesthood is of superior quality. The Chatam Sofer rejected Luria's reasoning that the lineage of Ashkenazic priesthood was utterly confused.\n\nRegarding the commandment of giving the five silver coins of the firstborn to the kohen. Jacob Emden opined that the presumed status of a presumptive kohen is insufficient to merit actually keeping those five silver coins. Hence, he suggested the kohen agree to a conditional transaction, with the intent on returning the coins to the father of the firstborn, all this in order to skirt the potential prohibition of theft on the kohen's part.\n\nNumerous Poskim, however, did not agree with Emden on this issue, for example, Sofer wrote that this type of conditional transaction would invalidate the redemption of the firstborn itself and the child would not be halachically redeemed so long as any pressure is exerted on the kohen to agree to this type of conditional transaction. A more extreme approach was taken by Chaim Hezekiah Medini who exclaimed, amongst a group of arguments, that Emden's advice created a cloud of uncertainty and doubt as to the otherwise legitimate lineage of the modern kohen. Medini concluded that the Emden's idea should not be relied on for the actual redemption of the firstborn.\n\nIn regards to the lineage of a kohen, Emden, in another responsum, writes that it is possible to find a kohen with a lineage document up until his patrilinial priestly division in hand even though the rest of Israel do not have their lineage documents at all.\n\n\n"}

Published in 2012, the book covers Edward's controversial career as both a performer and a skeptical activist.\n\nMark Edward gives the reader a look into the world of the psychic entertainer. From working the overnight shift answering the telephone for the Psychic Friends Network to counseling the rich and famous at celebrity galas, the author paints a picture of what it is really like to work in this profession. The book was published in paperback format in 2012 by Feral House. In 2015, Edward announced plans for the production of an audiobook version containing a substantial amount of additional material about his influences, personal life, and motivations.\n\nMark Edward (born Mark Edward Wilson) first acquired an interest in performing and magic from his grandfather, who was a magician himself. His career as a performer began in the 1970s, and has included 14 years at The Magic Castle, where he gave palmistry and tarot readings and conducted séances. He has also performed at a wide variety of venues, including private homes, a spiritualist church, corporate events, celebrity parties (including a baby shower at Eddie Murphy’s house and Buddy Hackett's 70th birthday party), and large public gatherings such as Dragon Con. His work with the Psychic Friends Network led him to the conclusion that all psychic entertainers were using only natural techniques, and that the public would be better served by his revealing these techniques.\n\nMark Oppenheimer of \"The New York Times\" placed Edward's book in the tradition of other performers—such as James Randi, Harry Houdini, and Penn & Teller—who simultaneously \"perform their crafts and debunk them\". Oppenheimer also commented on the \"conflicted\" nature of the book, saying, \"there is something tragic about his own ambivalence. From page to page, he cannot decide which side he is on. Sometimes he is crusading against the mountebanks and charlatans. Other times he defends his work as pure entertainment.\" He called the book, \"A strange mishmash of self-pity, self-justification, and genuine repentance—and a compelling look at the disputed territory where entertainment meets religion, where some practitioners actually think they can practice both at the same time.\"\n\nThe subject matter of this book caused ITV's program \"This Morning\" to invite Edward to speak about \"supernatural swindlers\" on May 1, 2014.\n\nA \"Carmel\" \"Pine Cone\" newspaper article noted, \"The book has stirred up attention both in the United States and abroad\", and, \"His message is that so-called psychics don’t have supernatural powers—they're just master manipulators and are well versed in saying what people want to hear—and that most of them are simply frauds.\"\n\nSkeptical activist and podcaster John Rael also recognized the dual nature of the book. Writing in a Skeptic.com book review, Rael chided Edward for continuing to perform as a psychic entertainer while still recognizing the value of the book itself. “The greatest tragedy of this book is that Edward seems to miss out on his own lesson, and it’s a really good one: . . . that we should listen to each other and talk to each other much more than we do.\" Of the book, Rael said: \"[D]o you want to learn about psychics? The people, not the tricks? Do you want to understand who psychics are and not just how they operate? Here is your book.\"\n\nWriting for \"Skeptical Inquirer\", Ray Hyman acknowledged Edward's \"ambiguous role in the skeptical community,\" stating that, \"He is quite active in helping skeptical groups test psychic claims and debunk obviously phony psychics who exploit their clients. At the same time, Edward still performs as a 'psychic.' He does not claim to have psychic powers. On the other hand, he does not openly disclaim such powers.\" Of the book itself, Hyman said, \"Because it provides us a rare insight into a psychic's world, as well as raising some important ethical issues for skeptics to ponder, I highly recommend every skeptic carefully read and ponder this book's contents.\"\n"}

Lechler spent 52 years in China. The Basel Hakka Mission that he administered was responsible for establishing over 51 mission stations, 56 schools with over two thousand members.\nLechler is known today for administering to the early Hakka Christian church and, together with his mission coworkers, facilitated in the resettling of Hakka Christian communities fleeing from persecution to Southeast Asian countries of which new congregations such as the Basel Christian Church of Malaysia and the Lutheran Church in Malaysia and Singapore were subsequently formed. Lechler appreciated China's cultural heritage and was able to preach in several varieties of Chinese, including Mandarin, Hokkien, and Hakka, the last of which he knew well enough to help prepare a Romanized Hakka edition of the Gospel of Matthew and Gospel of Luke. Today the Hakka Christian community is estimated to have 150,000 members worldwide.\n\nLechler was born on 26 July 1824 to pastor and Pietist Gottlob Lechler. He initially joined the merchant industry as an apprentice. During this time, an illness in which he contracted resulted in his Christian faith being strengthened and in 1844 committed himself to becoming a missionary by entering a Mission school run by the Basel Mission. It was during this time that he became acquainted with Theodore Hamberg During this time, the missionary Karl Gützlaff began touring churches in Western Europe and calling for missionary work to begin on the inland areas of China where no Westerner had ventured before. The Rhenish Missionary Society and the Basel Mission heeded the call and arranged for Theodor and Lechler to set sail for China, arriving on March 19, 1847.\n\nIn 1838, the Basel Missionary residing in India, C. Krückeberg travelled to Macau to recuperate from an illness and during this time he met Karl Gutzlaff and began to take an interest in the mission work taking place in China. He recommendeded that the Basel Mission society also begin sending its workers to China. On the May 13, 1846, the Basel Mission commissioned pastors Theodore Hamberg and Rudolph Lechler to China. On the same year, the Barmen Mission resolved to send Heinrich Köster and Ferdinand Genähr to assist Gutzlaff. The four of them reached Hong Kong on March 19. The Berlin Missionary Society also sent pastors Newman and Schubert as missionaries to China. \nIn the early year, the three mission societies had their own separate mission goals - Gutzlaff arranged for the Basel Church to be responsible for evangelizing the eastern Guangdong region, Lechler was to administer to the Teochew people in the Chaozhou and Shantou areas, whereas Hamberg was minister to the Hakka population. The Barmen Mission workers were to be assigned the southeastern and western parts of the province where the language of the local population is predominantly Cantonese. The Berlin Mission Society was allotted the Guangzhou area north of the Beijiang River to preach to both the local Hakka and Cantonese residents. This strategy continued until after the Boxer Incident when all three mission socieites began to cooperate and jointly develop common goals amongst themselves.\n\n\n"}

Originally published by CrossGen, it was revived in 2011 by Marvel Comics as part of its acquisition of CrossGen titles.\n\nRuse ran for twenty-six issues from November 2001 to January 2004 before it was forced to end by the bankruptcy of CrossGen. The first half of the series was written by Mark Waid and the last half by Scott Beatty; nearly the entire series featured pencils by Butch Guice. The critically acclaimed series was known for complex plots, the witty repartee between the two protagonists, and being of an unusual genre in comic books (Victorian-era detective fiction).\n\nThe series also had three spin-off issues, each called \"Ruse: Archard's Agents\" and all written by Chuck Dixon.\n\nIn 2010, Marvel Comics announced plans to revive CrossGen titles, and revealed that \"Ruse\" was scheduled to return as a four-issue miniseries in March 2011. Mark Waid was also announced as the writer.\n\nThe series takes place on the planet Arcadia, primarily in the fictional town of Partington, in a Victorian-era setting tinged with elements of magic and fantasy. The most visible difference from real London is that it has living gargoyles which are regarded by the populace as creatures as commonplace as pigeons.\n\nThe revived series established the city of Partington as a settlement in Victorian England, and made no mention of the Sigils or Negation characters from the original series. References were made to events and characters from the Crossgen series.\n\nThe series focused on two primary protagonists: Simon Archard and Emma Bishop. The relationship between the two attractive leads is purely professional, although the two share great chemistry and other characters make numerous innuendos about their relationship.\n\nSimon Archard is a detective. He is a master sleuth and extremely competent. He has an eidetic memory. He is feared by the criminals of Partington, and his presence apparently keeps the crime rate low. He is close to emotionless, remaining utterly calm in situations of crisis. He is also emotionally distant from other people. His character is based on Sherlock Holmes. It is implied that Simon Archard is his world's Sigil Bearer, but he does not receive the mark from anyone at the beginning of the series nor does he seem to have any special powers except his mental abilities (he does however wear the Sigil mark upon his tie pin). It is possible that Simon received the mark before the series began, gets his abilities from it and is able to hide it from everyone (and wears the mark on his tie pin as respect for the powers it gives him).\n\nEmma Bishop is Simon Archard's assistant. She has mysterious magical powers which she is not supposed to use. Careful to maintain her identity, she conceals her powers (though it was revealed in the last issue of the series, #26, that Archard had secretly deduced her powers almost from the very beginning). The source of her abilities was never revealed in the series, though a reader familiar with the rest of the CrossGen Universe could deduce from her powers and her orange eyes that she was one of the guides that accompanied Sigil-bearers.\n\nMiranda Cross is the primary antagonist of the series. She initially appears to be a beautiful baroness; however, it is revealed that she is evil, many centuries old, and from a different world. She also possesses magical powers, which are at least the equal of and probably stronger than those of Emma Bishop. She is possibly a demon of some sort, though the exact nature of her identity is not resolved by the end of the series. Some readers consider her dialogue in \"Ruse\" #18 (April 2003) to possibly hint that she is a Negation Lawbringer.\n\nMalcolm Lightbourne is Simon Archard's former mentor and chief rival. Lightbourne's main goal throughout the series is the retrieval of the Enigmatic Prism, which Archard stole from him at the end of their partnership. Lightbourne also seeks to kill Archard and attempts to achieve both of his goals by destroying the city of Partington.\n\nThe Consortium of Aggrieved Man Servants are a group of Butlers that strive to achieve the impossible; kill Simon Archard. This underground conspiracy has swelled in ranks over the years every time Archard has muttered the phrase \"the Butler did it.\" Even though the consortium has made many (botched) attempts on Archard's life, he seems un-characteristically unaware of their existence or perhaps he just doesn't care.\n\nArchard's Agents are a network of people that Archard uses to gather information on cases. Members of the group include a former prize fighter, a child psychic, and a bearded lady.\n\nWhile some issues were standalone issues in which Simon Archard and Emma Bishop solved some small mystery in Partington, most issues were concerned with the larger storyline running throughout the entire series.\n\nThis storyline focused on a mysterious artifact called the Enigmatic Prism, which incited evil desires, such as hate, lust, and a need to do violence, within people. Miranda Cross wanted the Enigmatic Prism to do evil with, and to use it to return to her homeworld. Simon Archard and Emma Bishop sought to destroy the prism, to prevent the artifact from causing further harm.\n\n\nThere have been a number of trade paperbacks collecting some of the issues:\n\n\nThe following collections were solicited, but never published due to Crossgen's bankruptcy:\n\n\nThe series has been nominated for five Eisners and has won a number of awards, including:\n\n\nIt was mentioned, in passing, that Siavash Farahani has written a \"Ruse\" film script for Disney with Sam Raimi directing the project.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53083263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53083263", "title": "Sacred trees and groves in Germanic paganism and mythology", "text": "Sacred trees and groves in Germanic paganism and mythology\n\nTrees hold a particular role in Germanic paganism and Germanic mythology, both as individuals (sacred trees) and in groups (sacred groves). The central role of trees in Germanic religion is noted in the earliest written reports about the Germanic peoples, with the Roman historian Tacitus stating that Germanic cult practices took place exclusively in groves rather than temples. Scholars consider that reverence for and rites performed at individual trees are derived from the mythological role of the world tree, Yggdrasil; onomastic and some historical evidence also connects individual deities to both groves and individual trees. After Christianization, trees continue to play a significant role in the folk beliefs of the Germanic peoples.\n\nThe pagan Germanic peoples referred to holy places by a variety of terms and many of these terms variously referred to stones, groves, and temple structures. From Proto-Germanic or , a masculine noun, developed Old Norse meaning 'temple, idol', Old English 'temple, idol', and Old High German meaning 'holy grove, holy stone'. According to philologist Vladimir Orel, the term was borrowed from the continental Celtic * or, alternately, the same non-Indo-European source as the Celtic source. A more general term for a sacred place was .\n\nThe Proto-Germanic masculine noun , which developed into Old Frankish ('holy grove'), similarly either developed from, or is otherwise connected to, Gaulish , Latin and Old Irish 'holiness'.\n\nAnother Proto-Germanic masculine noun, or , has given rise to words with a variety of meanings in various Germanic languages, including Anglo-Saxon , 'meadow', Middle Low German , 'bush', and Old High German , , 'grove, copse, bush'; it is cognate with Latin , 'sacred grove'.\n\nScandinavian placenames occur with the name of a deity compounded with , 'grove', or , 'wood'.\n\nSacred trees and groves are widely attested among the records of the ancient Germanic peoples. Some scholars hypothesize that they even predated the development of temples (according to Rudolf Simek, \"there were sacred woods long before there were temples and altars\"). In his \"Germania\", Tacitus says that the Germanic peoples \"consecrate woods and groves and they apply the name of gods to that mysterious presence which they see only with the eye of devotion\", Tacitus describes the grove of the Semnones and refers to a \"castum nemus\" (chaste grove) in which the image of the goddess Nerthus was hallowed, and other reports from the Roman period also refer to rites held by continental Germanic tribes in groves, including the sacrifices in forest clearings of survivors by the Cherusci after their victory at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, recounted by Tacitus in his \"Annals\" based on a report by Germanicus. Such groves were sometimes dedicated to a particular deity: in addition to the case of Nerthus, there was a \"silva Herculi sacra\" (\"wood sacred to Hercules\", an \"interpretatio romana\") near the River Weser, and the Semnones reportedly held their rituals in honor of the \"regnator omnium deus\" (god the ruler of all). The scholar of Germanic religion Jan de Vries noted that placenames such as Frølund (Denmark), and Ullunda, Frösvi, and Mjärdevi (Sweden), in which the name of a deity is compounded with words meaning \"grove\" or \"wood\", suggest a continuation of the same practice, but are found almost exclusively in eastern Scandinavia; however, there is a \"Coill Tomair\" recorded near Dublin, an oak forest apparently sacred to Thor. Sacred groves leave few archaeological traces, but two such sites may have been identified, both in Sweden: under the church in Frösö in Jämtland, and on a farm near Strängnäs in Södermanland.\n\nReverence for individual trees among the Germanic peoples is a common theme in medieval Christian denunciations of backsliding into paganism. In some cases, such as Donar's oak felled by St Boniface, these were associated with particular gods, and the association of individual trees with saints can be seen as a continuation of the tradition into modern times. There is also a Scandinavian folk tradition of farmers making small offerings to a \"warden tree\" that is regarded as exercising a protective function over the family and land. However, there are no indications that the trees were regarded in the pagan period as the abode of gods and spirits. Scholars presume that publicly revered trees such as that at the temple in Uppsala were regarded as counterparts to the mythic world tree Yggdrasil.\n\nThe present section divides particularly notable examples into texts discussing the religious activities of the ancient Germanic peoples involving trees and groves (\"Germanic paganism\") and their appearance in the myths of the Germanic peoples, particularly the North Germanic peoples (\"Germanic mythology\").\n\nSacred trees and groves are mentioned throughout the history of the ancient Germanic peoples, from their earliest attestations among Roman scribes to references made by medieval monks.\n\nIn Norse mythology, the northernmost extension of Germanic mythology, several sacred trees are mentioned. The most prominent of these trees is the holy tree central to the cosmos, Yggdrasil. \n\n"}

{"id": "5055507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5055507", "title": "Shanghai Ghetto", "text": "Shanghai Ghetto\n\nThe Shanghai Ghetto, formally known as the Restricted Sector for Stateless Refugees, was an area of approximately one square mile in the Hongkew district of Japanese-occupied Shanghai (the southern Hongkou and southwestern Yangpu districts of modern Shanghai). The area included the community around the Ohel Moshe Synagogue but about 23,000 of the city's Jewish refugees were restricted or relocated to the area from 1941 to 1945 by the \"Proclamation Concerning Restriction of Residence and Business of Stateless Refugees\". It was one of the poorest and most crowded areas of the city. Local Jewish families and American Jewish charities aided them with shelter, food, and clothing. The Japanese authorities increasingly stepped up restrictions, but the ghetto was not walled, and the local Chinese residents, whose living conditions were often as bad, did not leave.\n\nAt the end of the 1920s, most German Jews were loyal to Germany, assimilated and relatively prosperous. They served in the German army and contributed to every field of German science, business and culture. After the Nazis were elected to power in 1933, the state-sponsored anti-Semitic persecution such as the Nuremberg Laws (1935) and the Kristallnacht (1938) drove masses of German Jews to seek asylum abroad, but as Chaim Weizmann wrote in 1936, \"The world seemed to be divided into two parts—those places where the Jews could not live and those where they could not enter.\"\n\nThe Evian Conference demonstrated that by the end of the 1930s it was almost impossible to find a destination open for Jewish immigration.\n\nAccording to Dana Janklowicz-Mann:\n\"Jewish men were being picked up and put into concentration camps. They were told you have \"X\" amount of time to leave—two weeks, a month—if you can find a country that will take you. Outside, their wives and friends were struggling to get a passport, a visa, anything to help them get out. But embassies were closing their doors all over, and countries, including the United States, were closing their borders. ... It started as a rumor in Vienna... ‘There’s a place you can go where you don’t need a visa. They have free entry.’ It just spread like fire and whoever could, went for it.\"\n\nThe International Settlement of Shanghai was established by the Treaty of Nanking. Police, jurisdiction and passport control were implemented by the foreign autonomous board. Under the Unequal Treaties between China and European countries, visas were only required to book tickets departing from Europe.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Shanghai in 1937, the city was occupied by the army of Imperial Japan, and the port began to allow entry without visa or passport. By the time when most German Jews arrived, two other Jewish communities had already settled in the city: the wealthy Baghdadi Jews, including the Kadoorie and Sassoon families, and the Russian Jews. The last ones fled the Russian Empire because of anti-Semitic pogroms pushed by the tsarist regime and counter-revolutionary armies as well as the class struggle manifested by the Bolsheviks. They had formed the Russian community in Harbin, then the Russian community in Shanghai.\n\nMany in the Polish-Lithuanian Jewish community were saved by Chiune Sugihara, the Japanese consul in Kaunas, Lithuania. They managed to flee across the vast territory of Russia by train to Vladivostok and then by boat to Kobe in Japan. The refugees in number of 2,185 arrived in Japan from August 1940 to June 1941. Tadeusz Romer, the Polish ambassador in Tokyo, had managed to get transit visas in Japan, asylum visas to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Burma, immigration certificates to Palestine, and immigrant visas to the United States and some Latin American countries. Finally, Tadeusz Romer arrived in Shanghai on November 1, 1941, to continue the action for Jewish refugees. Among those saved in the Shanghai Ghetto were leaders and students of Mir yeshiva, the only yeshiva in occupied Europe to survive the Holocaust.\n\nSimilarly, thousands of Austrian Jews were saved by the Chinese consul-general in Vienna Ho Feng Shan, who issued visas during 1938-1940 against the orders of his superior the Chinese ambassador in Berlin, Chen Jie.\n\nThe refugees who managed to purchase tickets for luxurious Italian and Japanese cruise steamships departing from Genoa later described their three-week journey with plenty of food and entertainment—between persecution in Germany and squalid ghetto in Shanghai—as surreal. Some passengers attempted to make unscheduled departures in Egypt, hoping to smuggle themselves into the British Mandate of Palestine.\n\nThe first German Jewish refugees—twenty-six families, among them five well-known physicians—had already arrived in Shanghai by November 1933. By the spring of 1934, there were reportedly eighty refugee physicians, surgeons, and dentists in China. On August 15, 1938, the first Jewish refugees from Anschluss Austria arrived by Italian ship. Most of the refugees arrived after Kristallnacht. During the refugee flight to Shanghai between November 1938 and June 1941, the total number of arrivals by sea and land has been estimated at 1,374 in 1938; 12,089 in 1939; 1,988 in 1940; and 4,000 in 1941. In 1939-1940, Lloyd Triestino ran a sort of \"ferry service\" between Italy and Shanghai, bringing in thousands of refugees a month - Germans, Austrians, a few Czechs. Added to this mix were approximately 1,000 Polish Jews in 1941. Among these, all the faculty of the Mir Yeshiva, some 400 in number, who with the outbreak of World War II in 1939, fled from Mir to Vilna and then to Keidan, Lithuania. In late 1940, they obtained visas from Chiune Sugihara, the Japanese consul in Kaunas, to travel from Keidan, then Lithuanian SSR, via Siberia and Vladivostok to Kobe, Japan. By November 1941 the Japanese moved this group and most of others on to the Shanghai Ghetto in order to consolidate the Jews under their control.\nFinally, a wave of more than 18,000 Ashkenazi Jews from Germany, Austria, and Poland immigrated to Shanghai until the Attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan in December 1941.\n\nThe Ohel Moshe Synagogue served as a religious center for the Russian Jewish community since 1907 (currently the Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum, located at 62 Changyang Road, Hongkou District). In April 1941, a modern Ashkenazic Jewish synagogue was built (called the New Synagogue).\n\nMuch needed aid was provided by International Committee for European Immigrants (IC), established by Victor Sassoon and Paul Komor, a Hungarian businessman, and Committee for the Assistance of European Jewish Refugees (CFA), founded by Horace Kadoorie, under the direction of Michael Speelman. These organizations prepared the housing in Hongkou, a relatively cheap suburb compared with the Shanghai International Settlement or the Shanghai French Concession. They were accommodated in shabby apartments and six camps in a former school.\nThe Japanese occupiers of Shanghai regarded German Jews as \"stateless persons\", after Japanese government decides Jewish exclusion does not match the spirit of racial equalities. \n\nIn 1943, the occupying Japanese army required these 18,000 Jews to relocate to a 3/4 square mile area of Shanghai's Hongkou district where many lived in group homes called \"Heime\" or \"Little Vienna\".\n\nThe authorities were unprepared for massive immigration and the arriving refugees faced harsh conditions in the impoverished Hongkou District: 10 per room, near-starvation, disastrous sanitation and scant employment.\n\nThe Baghdadis and later the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) provided some assistance with the housing and food problems. Faced with language barriers, extreme poverty, rampant disease and isolation, the refugees were able to make the transition from being supported by welfare agencies to establishing a functioning community. Jewish cultural life flourished: schools were established, newspapers were published, theaters produced plays, sports teams participated in training and competitions, and even cabarets thrived.\n\nAfter Japanese forces attacked Pearl Harbor, the wealthy Baghdadi Jews (many of whom were British subjects) were interned, and American charitable funds ceased. As communication with the US was banned and broken, unemployment and inflation intensified and times got harder for the refugees.\n\nThe JDC liaison Laura Margolis, who came to Shanghai, attempted to stabilize the situation by getting permission from the Japanese authorities to continue her fundraising effort, turning for assistance to the Russian Jews who arrived before 1937 and were exempt from the new restrictions.\n\nAs World War II intensified, the Nazis stepped up pressure on Japan to hand over the Shanghai Jews. While the Nazis regarded their Japanese allies as \"Honorary Aryans\", they were determined that the Final Solution to the Jewish Question also be applied to the Jews in Shanghai. Warren Kozak describes the episode when the Japanese military governor of the city sent for the Jewish community leaders. The delegation included Amshinover rabbi Shimon Sholom Kalish. The Japanese governor was curious and asked \"Why do the Germans hate you so much?\"\n\nWithout hesitation and knowing the fate of his community hung on his answer, Reb Kalish told the translator (in Yiddish): \"\"Zugim weil wir senen orientalim\"—Tell him [the Germans hate us] because we are Orientals.\" The governor, whose face had been stern throughout the confrontation, broke into a slight smile. In spite of the military alliance, he did not accede to the German demand and the Shanghai Jews were never handed over.\nAccording to another rabbi who was present there, Reb Kalish' answer was \"They hate us because we are short and dark-haired.\" \"Orientalim\" was not likely to have been said because the word is an Israeli academic term in modern Hebrew, not a word in classical Yiddish or Hebrew.\n\nOn November 15, 1942, the idea of a restricted ghetto was approved, which was after the visit of Shanghai by Josef Meisinger. On February 18, 1943, the Japanese authorities declared a \"Designated Area for Stateless Refugees\" and ordered those who arrived after 1937 to move their residences and businesses within it by May 18, three months later. The stateless refugees needed permission from the Japanese to dispose of their property; others needed permission to move into the ghetto. The English version of the order read:\n\nWhile this area was not walled or surrounded with barbed wire, it was patrolled and a curfew enforced in its precincts. Food was rationed, and everyone needed passes to enter or leave the ghetto.\n\nAccording to Dr. David Kranzler,\nThus, about half of the approximately 16,000 refugees, who had overcome great obstacles and had found a means of livelihood and residence outside the 'designated area' were forced to leave their homes and businesses for a second time and to relocate into a crowded, squalid area of less than one square mile with its own population of an estimated 100,000 Chinese and 8,000 refugees.\n\nAlthough a few temporary passes were issued to work and to 16 students of St. Francis Xavier College outside the ghetto, these were granted arbitrarily and were severely curtailed after the first year. But the fact that the Chinese did not leave the Hongkou ghetto meant the Jews were not isolated. Nevertheless, economic conditions worsened; psychological adjustment to ghettoization was difficult; the winter of 1943 was severe and hunger was widespread.\n\nThe US air raids on Shanghai began in 1944. There were no bomb shelters in Hongkou as the water table was close to the surface. The most devastating raid started on July 17, 1945, and was the first attack on Hongkou. The bombings by the US 7th Air Force continued daily until the Atomic Bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, which ended the air raids.\n\nRefugees in the ghetto, improvised their own shelters, with one family surviving the bombing under a bed with a second mattress on top, mounted on two desks. Thirty-eight refugees and hundreds of Chinese were killed in the 17 July raid.\n\nSome Jews of the Shanghai ghetto took part in the resistance movement. They participated in an underground network to obtain and circulate information and were involved in some minor sabotage and in providing assistance to downed Allied aircrews. In addition, over 90% of the residents were unable to leave the ghetto until after the liberation in August 1945.\n\nThe ghetto was officially liberated on September 3, 1945, after some delay to allow Chiang Kai-shek's army to take political credit for the liberation of Shanghai. With the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 and the fall of Chiang Kai-shek in 1949, almost all the Shanghai ghetto Jews left. By 1957, only 100 remained, and today only a few may still live there.\n\nThe Government of Israel bestowed the honor of the Righteous Among the Nations to Chiune Sugihara in 1985 and to Ho Feng Shan in 2001.\n\nSince the establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and China in 1992, the connection between the Jewish people and Shanghai has been recognised in various ways. In 2007, the Israeli consulate-general in Shanghai donated 660,000 Yuan, provided by 26 Israeli companies, to community projects in Hongkou District, in recognition of the safe harbour provided by the ghetto. The only Jewish monument in Shanghai is located at Houshan Park (formerly Rabin Park) in Hongkou District.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the site of the Greco-Roman Temple of Dakka, dedicated to Thoth, the god of wisdom in the ancient Egyptian pantheon. The temple was initially a small one-room shrine or chapel, first begun in the 3rd century BC by a Meroitic king named Arqamani (or Ergamenes II) in collaboration with Ptolemy IV who added an antechamber and a gate structure. Ptolemy IX \"subsequently enlarged the temple by adding a pronaos with two rows of probably three columns.\" During the Roman period, the Emperors Augustus and Tiberius further enlarged the structure with \"the addition, at the rear, of a second sanctuary as well as inner and outer enclosure walls with a large pylon. The sanctuary contained a granite naos.\" The Temple of Dakka was transformed into a temple fortress by the Romans and surrounded by a stone wall, 270 by 444 metres long, with an entrance along the Nile. \n\nA large dromos leads to the pylon, which formed the entrance to the temple. Each of the pylon's towers is decorated in high relief and bears numerous graffiti from visitors, mostly in Greek but some in Demotic and Meroitic script. There are reliefs of cows offered as gifts to the god Thoth carved into the naos of the Temple of Dakka. While the temple of Dakka was similar architecturally to the temple of Wadi es-Sebua, it lacked a front courtyard of sphinxes; however, its 12-metre-high pylon is in near perfect condition. A 55-metre-long processional approach ran from the temple's pylon to a cult terrace at the Nile. During the Christian period of Egypt, the facade of the pronaos was converted for use into a church, and Christian paintings were still visible here in the 20th century before the temple was enveloped by the Nile floods. \n\nThe temple of Dakka collapsed in 1908–1909 and was subsequently rebuilt by Alessandro Barsanti.\n\nDuring the construction of the Aswan dam in the 1960s, the temple was dismantled and moved to the site of Wadi es-Sebua. At the time of its removal, some reused stone blocks from Thutmose III, Seti I and Merneptah were discovered which originated from an earlier New Kingdom structure in or near Kubban. The temple's pylon is now separated from the remainder of the temple due to the missing enclosure walls of the open court.\n\nThe Temple of Maharraqa was also moved and rebuilt at the New Wadi es-Sebua temple complex area.\n"}

The authors, both Freemasons, present a theory of the origins of Freemasonry as part of their \"true story\" of the historical Jesus and the original Jerusalem Church.\n\nThe authors claim that their work proves the following:\n\nKnight and Lomas begin by quoting Henry Ford, who was a Freemason, as saying \"all history is bunk\". They express the belief that, though Ford's statement may be abrupt, it is accurate, as history is often not a completely accurate and comprehensive account of facts, but only what the dominant or orthodox view of the time has recorded for posterity.\n\nThe authors make their case through the use of dialectics. The technique requires the reader to accept a basic premise, and then proceeds in a logical order; requiring the reader to weigh the merit of each step on the way to a conclusion. If the initial premise, and each of the steps in logic towards the conclusion have merit, the conclusion can represent a legitimate, possible explanation.\n\nThe authors of The Hiram Key propose a possible sequence of events that led to modern Freemasonry, although much of their narrative has been debated by historians and other researchers. A criticism of their approach by those unfamiliar with the science of \"dialectical progression\" is that the authors have gathered irrelevant and often unevidenced 'facts' to arrive at an equally unproven theory. Even those familiar with the application of dialectics may concede that the conclusion of such logic is only as good as its weakest link. All Historical study is based on dialectical appraisal of evidence, and all sources of information subject to interpretation as the \"weakest link.\"\n\nKnight and Lomas are not professional historians nor have they any qualifications in history or research, and their case is open to the criticism that they accept references that fit their theory and reject those that conflict with it. .\n\nNonetheless they argue in the book that the foundations of the Christian religion are a distortion by the early Roman Catholic Church of the teachings of the real Jesus and his followers. They claim to have found in Freemasonry a new 'key' to unlock the secrets of civilization. This key is also the key to the origins of Christianity and, they assert, proves that many of the beliefs of modern Religion may well have come to be, at least partly, through imprecise historical interpretation.\n\nKnight and Lomas state that one of the main motivations in writing the book stemmed from a desire to ascertain the origins of Freemasonry, following their own experiences of being initiated into it. Did it arrive, fully formed at the foundation of the Premier Grand Lodge of England on 24 June 1717, or was that the first public acknowledgement of something much older?\n\nOne widely held theory is that Freemasonry evolved out of guilds of stonemasons. Traditional Masonic ritual claims that one of the first Freemasons was Hiram Abiff, a widow's son from the tribe of Naphtali, who was the Architect of King Solomon's Temple. His name has never been recorded as such historically, although there is a similar character in the Old Testament of the Bible, who is not named, but is described as a widow's son, in the First Book of Kings.\n\nAlthough not apparently named in some translations of the bible, others, such as the Coverdale translation and the original Martin Luther translation do indeed refer to him as \"Hiram Abiff\" or as \"Huram Abi\". The word \"abi\" is translated as \"father\" or \"my father\" in other translations whilst the Luther and Coverdale translations treated it as a personal name. The Jewish Study Bible suggests that the word \"father\" is an honorific title applied to a skilled craftsman. The use of \"abu\" meaning \"father\" as an honorific is still used in the Middle East today, hence \"Abukir\" named after \"Father\" or Saint Cyril.\n\nThe book's authors claim that the stonemason-origin theory could be discounted because it had so many apparent fallacies. Why would powerful and rich people have been attracted to join a fraternity that came from poor and uneducated stonemasons' Guilds? The theory of Freemasonry originating in London in 1717 is also regarded as unlikely, because there are earlier mentions of Freemasonry in other locations. The authors concluded that Freemasonry was actually as old as it claimed in its traditional ritual, dating back to the building of King Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem\n\nKnight and Lomax claim to have analysed their sources rigorously, including the Old Testament and New Testament of the Bible, ancient Jewish texts, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Gnostic Gospels, and Masonic rituals to support their conclusions. They note the global significance of religion and that any major refutation of commonly held beliefs would meet resistance from the established and orthodox authorities in any particular religion. In support of that point Knight and Lomax cite the treatment of the Dead Sea Scrolls.They note that, 40 years after their discovery, only about half of the available material had ever been published or made available for independent review. It was not until 1991 that public access restrictions were lifted. The scrolls contained various versions of Biblical texts, all of which were more than 1000 years older than the oldest surviving Hebrew texts that were produced by Aaron ben Moses ben Asher in AD 1008. The texts of these scrolls are believed by the authors to have been written by ancestors of the same Qumran community of the Judaean hills that found them. The authors also believe that the Qumran Community were Essenes, and that they and the Nasoreans and the original Jerusalem Church were all one and the same. That is, the ancient Qumranians were the first Christians.\n\nThey decided that the story of Hiram Abiff was actually based on the initiation ceremonies of the ancient kings of Egypt. They also came to the conclusion, after analysis of the New Testament, the Gnostic Gospels, and Masonic ritual, that Jesus and the original Christians were thoroughly different from what the Roman Catholic Church and orthodox Christianity has taught they were.\n\nThe authors believe that Jesus did not claim to be divine, but was instead a messiah in the Jewish sense of the term, a good man and a freedom fighter, trying to liberate the Jews from Roman occupation.\n\nThe authors do not claim that the Christianity is incompatible with the ideals and goals of Freemasonry. Neither do they claim that the Jewish Faith or the Muslim faith or Buddhist faith are incompatible with the tenets of Freemasonry. Although The Hiram Key highlights some inconsistent historical references within various dogmas, they do not claim dogma to be devoid of value to humanity. The book is more an examination of historical references rather than an examination of religion.\n\nJesus did not claim to work miracles, according to the authors. When Jesus claimed to have raised Lazarus from the dead, it was intended as an allegorical reference; followers were referred to as the \"living\" and others were referred to as the \"dead\" in certain Jewish esotericism of the time. Similarly, Jesus' turning water into wine merely meant elevating people to a higher status within the framework of the sect.\n\nThe authors believe that Jesus' sect, the Jerusalem Church, operated some kind of \"quasi-Masonic\" initiation ceremonies and develop that line of thought to claim that Jesus was thus, in a sense, a Freemason.\n\nIn Chapter 5 of the Hiram Key, \"Jesus Christ: Man, God, Myth, or Freemason?\", the authors state: \"We realise that this is a statement that will offend many Christians, and particularly many Roman Catholics,\" but the conclusion they came to, based upon historical context derived outside the accepted religious context, was that Jesus was a Freemason.\n\nThe book contains a radical hypothesis about the origins of Freemasonry, seeking to demonstrate a heritage back through the Knights Templar to the Jerusalem Church and Pharaoic Egypt, claiming to draw on a wide range of material to support this hypothesis.\n\nThe work has been subject to criticism from within the established body of masonic-research, based on:\n\n\nQuatuor Coronati Lodge No 2067 the principal Lodge of Masonic research under the United Grand Lodge of England, has criticised the book as Pseudohistory, and some Masonic libraries categorise the volume as fiction.\n\nReviews of the work are commonly critical; publishers of this criticism include:\n\n\n"}

Tishtrya is Tir in Middle- and Modern Persian. As has been judged from the archaic context in which Tishtrya appears in the texts of the Avesta, the divinity/concept is almost certainly of Indo-Iranian origin.\n\nIn a hymn of the Avesta (incorporated by Ferdowsi, with due acknowledgement, in the Shahnameh), Tishtrya is involved in a cosmic struggle against the drought-bringing demon Apaosha. According to the myth, in the form of a pure white horse the god did battle with the demon who, in contrast, had assumed the form of a terrifying black horse. Apaosa soon gained the upper hand over Tishtrya, who was weakened from the lack of sufficient prayers and sacrifices from humankind. The yazata proceeded to call upon the Creator Ahura Mazda, who himself then intervened by offering a sacrifice to the overwhelmed god. Infused with the power brought by this sacrifice, Tishtrya was able to overcome Apaosa, and his rains were able to flow to the parched fields and pastures unabated by drought. This story serves to underscore the importance of votive offerings and sacrifice in religious tradition.\n\nIn the Zoroastrian religious calendar, the 13th day of the month and the 4th month of the year are dedicated to Tishtrya/Tir, and hence named after the entity. In the Iranian civil calendar, which inherits its month names from the Zoroastrian calendar, the 4th month is likewise named Tir.\n\nDuring the Achaemenid period, Tishtrya was conflated with Semitic Nabu-*Tiri, and thus came to be associated with the Dog Star, Sirius. The Tiregan festival, previously associated with *Tiri (a reconstructed name), was likewise transferred to Tishtrya. During the Hellenic period, Tishtrya came to be associated with Pythian Apollo, patron of Delphi, and thus a divinity of oracles.\n\nThe other names of Tishtrya in Persian is Tishter, Roozahang, Shabahang and Varahang.\n\nTishtrya (Tishter) or Roozahang is the God of Rainfall. It is a white, bright and afar star, bright and afar and its nature is water.\n\n"}

Its typical form is a projecting cross-piece resting on two uprights or posts. It is made of wood or stone, and the cross-piece is generally of three bars placed one on the top of the other; both cross-piece and posts are usually sculpted.\n\nToranas are associated with Buddhist stupas like the \"Great Stupa\" in Sanchi, as well as with Jain and Hindu structures, and also with several secular structures. Symbolic toranas can also be made of flowers and even leaves and hung over the doors and at entrances, particularly in Western and Southern India. They are believed to bring good fortune and signify auspicious and festive occasions. They can also serve didactic and narrative purposes or be erected to mark the victory of a king.\n\nDuring Vesak festival of Sri Lanka it is a tradition to erect electrically illuminated colorful Vesak toranas in public places. These decorations are temporary installations which remain in public display for couple of weeks starting from the day of Vesak.\n\nToranas are also referred to as vandanamalikas. There are many different types of toranas - dvara-toranas, patra-toranas, ratne-toranas and so on. These are mentioned in medieval Indian architectural treatises.\n\nThe earliest archaeological evidence of Torana dates back to Sanchi stupa built by Mauryan Empire in 3rd century BCE. The Sanchi torana and architecture is imitation of timber and brick construction in stone, which was popular feature in Indian architecture before 3rd century BCE.\n\nBoth Chinese paifang gateways and Japanese torii gateways have been derived from the Indian torana. The functions of all three are similar, but they generally differ based on their respective architectural styles, such as having multiple tiered and arched roofs and various \"supporting posts\" that are prevalent in East Asian architectural style. The Korean gateway is also related to the Japanese torii, and similar structures exist in Thailand.\n\nA great deal of cultural exchange between these countries took place in ancient times, so that many Indian, Thai, Chinese, Korean and Japanese cultural practices are related. For example, Benzaiten is a Japanese name for the Hindu goddess Saraswati, and the ancient Siddhaṃ script, which disappeared from India by 1200 CE, is still written by monks in Japan.\n\nIn Kalinga architecture we can see the Toran in many temples built from the 7th to 12th centuries. Jagannath Temple, Puri, Rajarani Temple and Mukteswar Temple are the few example of Kalinga architecture having torana.\n\nIn Gujarat, several \"Torana\"s built during reign of Chaulukya dynasty (10th-12th century). They were mostly associated with temples.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4779542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4779542", "title": "Trinitarian universalism", "text": "Trinitarian universalism\n\nTrinitarian Universalism is a variant of belief in universal salvation, the belief that every person will be saved, that also held the Christian belief in Trinitarianism (as opposed to, or contrasted with, liberal Unitarianism which is more usually associated with Unitarian Universalism). It was particularly associated with an ex-Methodist New England minister, John Murray, and after his death in 1815 the only clergy known to be preaching Trinitarian Universalism were Paul Dean of Boston and Edward Mitchell in New York.\n\nTraditionally, the doctrine of Universalism was traced by Universalist historians back to the teachings of Origen of Alexandria (c.185–284), an influential early Church Father and writer. Origen believed in apocatastasis, the ultimate restoration and reconciliation of creation with God, which was interpreted by Universalists historians to mean the salvation and reconciliation with God of all souls which had ever existed, including Satan and his demons. However more recent research has shown that this analysis of Origen's views is uncertain. Origen also believed in the pre-existence of souls and that glorified Man may have to go through cycles of sin and redemption before reaching perfection. The teachings of Origen were declared anathema at the Ecumenical Council of 553, centuries after his death, though Gregory of Nyssa, another figure to whom Universalist historians attributed Universalist belief, was commended as an Orthodox defender of the faith by the same Council. Universalist historians have also identified Johannes Scotus Eriugena (815–877), and Amalric of Bena (c. 1200). as Universalists. Much of this research was incorporated by French priest Pierre Batiffol into an article on Apocatastasis later translated for the 1911 Catholic Encyclopedia.\n\nDuring the Protestant Reformation, all doctrines and practices of the Catholic (Universal) Church were re-examined and numerous sects formed, although none revived the belief (originally attributed to Origen) in universal reconciliation. In 1525, Hans Denck (1425–1527) was accused of being a Universalist, but this is now considered unlikely.\n\nJane Leade (1623–1704), a mystic who claimed to have seen heaven and hell, started a Universalist congregation, the Philadelphians, which dissipated after her death. She was a Behmenist rather than orthodox Trinitarian.\n\nJohn Murray (1741–1815) was forced to leave the Methodist Church because of his Universalism. In 1770, he came to New England and is credited with being the Father of Universalism in North America. Although Murray was a Trinitarian (as was his mentor, James Relly), his successor, Hosea Ballou (1771–1852) was a strong Unitarian who opposed Trinitarianism, Calvinism, and legalism. During his tenure, Universalism became linked with liberal theology as well as Unitarianism.\n\nModern Trinitarian Universalists include Robin Parry an evangelical writer, who under the pseudonym of \"Gregory MacDonald\" released a book \"The Evangelical Universalist\", (2006) and Thomas Talbott author of \"The Inescapable Love of God\" (1999).\n\nThomas Talbott offers three propositions which are biblically based, but which he asserts to be mutually exclusive:\n\nTraditional theology clarifies omnipotence or omni-benevolence to resolve the contradiction. Calvinism resolves it by positing a doctrine of limited atonement, which claims that God's love is restricted. Only a select number of people are elected to be saved, which includes redemption and purification. This demonstrates a special love, and most people (the 'eternally reprobate' or non-elect) are given only common grace and tolerance. This bifurcation of grace intends to retain a doctrine of God's omnibenevolence and a doctrine of hell. In comparison, Arminianism resolves the contradiction by rejecting divine omnipotence with respect to human will. This is commonly referred to as synergism. It posits that human beings have an inviolable free will, which allows the choice of accepting or rejecting God's grace. Universalists disagree with the third claim, and argue that all people receive salvation.\n\nSince traditional interpretations of multiple biblical verses seem to be about people experiencing everlasting conscious torment in hell, many Christians hold that Universalists must either refute or reinterpret these verses. There are many verses of scripture supporting universal salvation with which supporters of eternal damnation must contend, including (but not limited to): Matthew 18:14, Luke 3:6, John 3:17, John 12:32, John 12:47, John 15:16, Romans 8:38-9, 1 Timothy 2:3–4, and 1 Timothy 4:9–10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeresy is \"adherence to a religious opinion contrary to church dogma\". Because dogma varies among denominations, what is considered heresy by one denomination or congregation may be accepted as doctrine or opinion by another. In a socially free world, free moral agents may identify with whichever perspectives and positions, persons and communities, and traditions (or subtraditions) they find most intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually palatable. However, the results of their exercise of this operational freedom may be understood or interpreted differently by different persons.\n\nThere are three (3) generally accepted understandings of hell:\n\nThere is also the doctrine of purgatory, distinct from hell, where imperfect souls are cleansed and made ready for heaven. It may be a place of rehabilitation, correction, or retribution.\n\nUniversalists believe that every person will be saved, where more orthodox Roman Catholics believe that only those who died in God's grace will find purgation for their venial sins in Purgatory.\n\nThe Argument\n\nThere are four (4) major theories about human salvation in Christendom:\n\nChristian denominations and churches will generally profess one of the above to be true and the others as error; however, they are not all mutually exclusive. For example, some who hold to #4 \"Universalism\" also hold to #1 \"Exclusivism.\" For these, anyone who is not a Christian will go to hell, but ultimately everyone will become a Christian and therefore be saved. Others may be #2 \"Inclusivists\" and #3 \"Pluralists.\" For those who might hold to these, because God may use the tools of any particular religion or culture to reveal his grace in Christ (Inclusivism), other religions therefore, potentially exhibiting the effects of this work, may in fact hold valuable insights to truth for theology (Pluralism), consequently calling the members of a particular congregation/denomination/religion to be open to that possibility.\n\nThis anecdote by Rev. Elizabeth Strong, a Unitarian Universalist, sums up the issue:\n\nThe following are problematic verses for Trinitarian Universalists and which they usually seek to qualify in some way.\n\n\n\n\nSome attempts to explain the passage note the ancient uses of burning sulfur for ritual purification and even medicinal therapy, that the Greek word for 'torment' -basanazo- refers to applying a touchstone \nto determine the presence of gold, and that the Greek word for sulfur 'theoin\" is rooted in the Greek 'theos' for 'god'. Thus, the passage could be paraphrased that those who worship the Beast would \nbe tested, tried, even purged and healed through the \"burning sulfur\" of the Divine Presence, and that such an ordeal will endure for aions of anions, however long is needed for their restoration. \n\nRomans 9, according to Calvinism, teaches that some people are natural objects of God's wrath, created and prepared for the purpose of being destroyed. Judas was predestined to be the Son of Perdition, the one prophesied to betray Jesus. It is written that \"It would be better for him if he had not been born\" (despite the fact that, without Judas' betrayal there would have been no crucifixion, no resurrection and therefore no salvation). God foreknew all those he would save and that some people are destined for eternal damnation. Also, according to Calvinism, justice requires that sins against an infinite, holy God merit eternal punishment, especially for those who reject his gift of salvation. God is love and also holy. Thirdly, Calvinists would contend that nowhere in the bible does it even hint at the possibility of post-mortem salvation. After death comes judgment.\n\nTrinitarian Universalists might answer that, if all are created totally lost in sin, it would therefore not be logical or (more importantly) just for God, the epitome of justice himself, to hold them accountable for their actions or liable for their state of being without providing them a way to find redemption, and this could be said even of a being that is not all-merciful and all-loving, as God is. Romans 9 deals with God's hidden will to choose some to salvation in this life (the elect) and pass others, called reprobates, by in this life. That is not the final word God speaks to those individuals he passes by. Jesus said, as he was dying on the cross, \"Father forgive them for they know not what they do.\" He also promised \"I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw (or, literally, \"drag\" in the Greek) all men unto me.\" Surely these global statements cover all of humanity.\n\nF.W. Farrar offers this possible interpretation to Jesus' remarks regarding Judas. When Jesus said, \"it would be better for him if he had not been born,\" the \"him\" was referring to the Son of Man (Jesus) and the \"he\" to Judas. Thus he meant that it would have been better for the Son of Man if Judas had not been born. Another view is that although everyone else is to be saved, perhaps Judas will be punished and then annihilated. At any rate the passage does not disprove universalism and certainly does not prove eternal torment.\n\nPointing to God's eternality is not a satisfactory explanation as to why a temporal sin logically entails unending punishment, though it may be for that reason eternally grave. God's attributes can never conflict with one another, lest God be an imperfect being who is subject to internal strife. God's mercy can never violate his justice, as if God's Love pushes him in one direction whereas his holiness pushes him in another. Universalism brings all his attributes into harmony by pointing out the way in which they describe the one single will of God. The early twentieth century theologian Paul Tillich described this relationship between God's justice and mercy as \"creative justice\" and as \"the strange work of love\" in \"Love, Power, and Justice\". Creative justice refers to justice under the principle of agape, or unambiguous and unconditional love. Because it drives towards the reunion of the separated (eros) unconditionally (agape), it makes amends with s/he whom is separated by severing from their personal center that which entrenches the separation (i.e. \"the strange work\"). This ultimately entails being faced with the Law, or the unconditionality of the moral imperative, and recognizing the need for reconciliation and forgiveness. This \"destructive\" work of love is always for the sake of building up love's object as and into a subject. Gestalt therapy and psychotherapy are modern examples of love doing this strange work: the process is painful and entails major reform, but health and well-being are its intention. Martin Luther said \"the love of God creates its own object.\"\n\nFrom the point of view of Trinitarian Universalism the following questions could be asked of more \"orthodox\" believers: If there is no hint of post-mortem salvation in the Bible, then why does Paul refer to people being baptized for the dead? Why did Jesus preach to those in hell? Why did the majority of church fathers, including Augustine and Luther, believe in the possibility of post-mortem salvation?\n\nArminianism holds that God will not abrogate humanity's free will because love must be chosen, not forced, and that some people will choose alienation from God over consummation, and so God has \"graciously\" provided a place for them to exist. C.S. Lewis speculated, through literary allegory, that hell is locked from within but few will leave because over a lifetime and through the coming ages, they will become more and more at home in hell.\n\nA Trinitarian Universalist believer might counter that for God to allow his misguided and confused children to suffer eternal separation from him is the very opposite of grace, runs counter to his loving and sovereign nature, and would compare unfavorably to the attitude and behavior of even average human parents toward their children. The Bible seems to teach that those who believe do so because God caused them to believe, not by any freedom of choice of their own (Ephesians 2:8–10), and they might cite the following in support their answer:\n\"He choose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.\" Ephesians 1:4–6\n\n\"For He says to Moses, 'I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.' So then it {does} not {depend} on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy.\" Romans 9:15–16\nAlso, the Bible in several places refers to freedom being only for those freed through Christ, and that those who are not in Christ are in darkness under the dominion of Satan (Acts 26:18), and are slaves to sin (John 8:34). Therefore, it would make no sense to maintain that someone can have the \"freedom\" to \"reject God\"—it is only by sin that people reject God. Those in sin are slaves to sin and Satan, and therefore it is only God who can, by his grace, release them from that bondage and make them able to believe:\n\"The Lord's bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged, with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth, and they may come to their senses {and escape} from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will.\"\nFurthermore, the idea that God wills us to have real love, and that therefore the love cannot be forced upon us, is not to say that, therefore, the only other alternative is absolute and total freedom, even freedom to condemn ourselves. A good parent would certainly allow their son or daughter to develop into their own genuine person, making free choices. That doesn't mean, however, that the parent's earnest desire for authenticity in their child's life, based on the child making real, honest, personal choices, would therefore lead them to not intervene if the child were about to jump in front of a moving train, or take a fatal dose of sleeping pills. To say that God either gives us absolute and total freedom to accept or reject him, or else we are mindless robots or marionettes is a false dichotomy. It also conveniently ignores the blatant fact that almost nothing in our life is under our control, from when and where we are born, to our economic status, to what sorts of beliefs we are taught and raised with—all of which have a bearing on our decision to accept or reject Him. No matter how much we would like to pretend otherwise, the decision to have faith in Christ is not as much \"free will\" as it is the enormously personal culmination of all the circumstances of our lives, and therefore enormously influenced by the myriad external, uncontrollable factors that have shaped our hearts and minds.\n\nMortalists object that, in their view, the Bible does not teach torment of souls, either in Hades, nor at the Last Day in Gehenna.\n\nApart from the dogmatic belief that a sentence of endless torment in hell is incompatible with God's moral character there are notable theologians who believe that God wants everyone to be saved and that it is possible for God to save everyone but, at the same time, they will not limit God's sovereign right to choose not to save everyone.\n\nWhile Thomas Talbott, \"Gregory MacDonald\" (the penname for Robin Parry) and Eric Reitan regard everlasting punishment as impossible, Reformed, neo-orthodox theologian Karl Barth and Catholic theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar believed that the eventual salvation of all was merely a possibility.\n\n\n"}
