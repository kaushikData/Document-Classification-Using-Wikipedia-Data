The claim was criticized as lending support to blood libel, an allegation that modern historians have described as unsupported by facts and which the Catholic Church has similarly repudiated since the 13th century. Toaff wrote that these critics had misunderstood his book, which argued that the ritual use of small quantities of dried blood in magical curses had been a real practice among medieval \"Ashkenazi extremists\", but that this was unrelated to the accusation of ritual murder which was the central claim of blood libel.\n\nAriel Toaff is the son of Elio Toaff, late former Chief Rabbi of Rome.\n\nAmong his works are \"The Jews in Medieval Assisi 1305-1487: A social and economic history of a small Jewish community\" (1979); \"Il vino e la carne. Una comunità ebraica nel Medioevo\" (\"Wine and Meat. A Jewish Community in the Middle Ages\", 1989); \"Mostri giudei. L'immaginario ebraico dal Medioevo alla prima età moderna\" (\"Jewish Monsters. The Jewish Imaginary from the Middle Ages to the Early Modern Era\", 1996); and \"Mangiare alla giudia. La cucina ebraica in Italia dal Rinascimento all'età moderna\" (\"Eating Jewish style. Jewish Cooking in Italy from the Renaissance to the Modern Age\", 2000).\n\nToaff's book, \"Pasque di sangue. Ebrei d'Europa e omicidi rituali\" (\"Passovers of Blood: The Jews of Europe and Ritual Murders\"), was published in February 2007. The book analyzes the cultural and historical background to a notorious 1475 murder trial in Italy. A group of Jews were accused of murdering a young boy, later known as Simon of Trent, and using his blood for Passover rites. The accused were tortured and confessed to killing the boy, who was informally venerated as a saint by Catholics until the 1960s. The consensus of scholarship has dismissed cases such as Simon of Trent's as a blood libel against Jews. \n\nThe book's publication, among other responses, led to calls for Toaff to resign from or be fired from his professorship, and questioning of his research, historical method, and motives as they relate to his writing of the book. Threats were made against his life, and some sought his prosecution.\n\nThe book was much criticized for providing material that anti-Semites might capitalize on, though Sergio Luzzatto praised his intellectual courage in reopening a dossier that had lain under a taboo. While Toaff framed his analysis in hypothetical language, and phrased his speculations in conditional language, the reception of the book often tended to translate this caution, according to Hanna Johnson, into the indicative language of accepted fact.\n\nToaff promised not to give in to pressure and defend his work \"even if crucified\". In response to a statement from Italian Jewish leaders that consumption or use of blood is prohibited by Jewish law and tradition, Toaff stressed that he was not implicating all Jews, but only \"a group of fundamentalist Jews [who] did not respect the biblical prohibition [against use of blood].\" However, Toaff did eventually pull his book from circulation. He clarified that in regard to the specific trial, dealing with Jews accused of killing Simon of Trent for ritual purposes at Passover, there was no relationship whatsoever between the so-called 'ritual of blood' and ritual infanticide. He denied that the Jews implicated were in any way involved in the murder of Simon. On February 14, 2007, Toaff said in a statement that he ordered the Italian publisher of his book to freeze distribution of his book so that he can \"re-edit the passages which comprised the basis of the distortions and falsehoods that have been published in the media.\" \n\nA second edition of the book appeared in February, 2008. In an afterword to this edition in defense of his book, Toaff responded to his critics. To forestall possible misinterpretations, he said that the idea that Jews practiced ritual murder is a slanderous stereotype, and that ritual homicide or infanticide was a myth. That said, the possibility existed that:\nThe evidence supporting this hypothesis draws on confessions extracted under torture. His book examines the strong documentary evidence in medieval medical handbooks that dried human blood, traded by both Jewish and Christian merchants, was thought to be medicinally efficacious. Under the stress of forced conversions, expulsions and massacres, Toaff thinks it possible that in certain Ashkenazi groups dried human blood came to play a magical role in calling down God's vengeance on Christians, the historic persecutors of the Jews, and that this reaction may have affected certain forms of ritual practice among a restricted number of Ashkenazi Jews during Passover.\n\n\n\n"}

It is sometimes mistaken as equivalent to Christian use of the word, \"sister.\" Ayya can refer to either a bhikkhuni (fully ordained and usually wearing orange or yellow robes in Southeast Asia) or a samaneri (shramanerika) ten-precept novice renunciant or a sikkhamana (wearing white, brown or sometimes pink), but not to non-ordained precept-holders.\n\nGenerally for bhikkhunis, robes would be maroon with yellow in Tibet; gray (for Mahayanans) or orange/yellow (for Theravadans) in Vietnam; gray in Korea; gray or black in China and Taiwan; black in Japan; orange or yellow in Thailand, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Laos, Cambodia, and Burma. The colour of robes distinguishes both level of ordination and tradition, with white (usually worn by a male renunciant before ordination) or pink symbolising a state of ambiguity, being on the threshold of a decision, no longer secular and not yet monastic. A key exception to this is in the countries where women are not allowed to wear robes that signify full ordination, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and (Theravadans in) Vietnam. So, the majority of ayyas wear orange/yellow or white/pink.\n\nThere are very few fully ordained (bhikkhuni) ayyas in the 21st century because the Theravadan nuns' lineage was lost in most of Southeast Asia over the last 1,000 years. The Theravadan bhikkhuni lineage was reinstated in 1996 at Sarnath, India, by a quorum of Theravada monks and Korean nuns. Eleven Sinhalese dasa sil mata nuns took full bhikkhuni ordination in that ceremony, reviving the Theravada Bhikkhuni Order after 980 years of decline and dissipation. Theravadan ordination is available for women (as of 2006) in Sri Lanka, where many of the current bhikkhunis have been ordained. The ordination process has several stages, which can begin with anagarika (non-ordained) precepts and wearing white robes, but is as far as many women are allowed to take their practice. In Thailand, where it is illegal for women to take ordination, nearly all female monastics are known as maechis (also spelled \"mae chee\"), regardless of their level of attainment.\n\nAs awareness of the need for ordained women to study and practice grows, so does the support for female monks. There are very few places for an ayya to reside, once she ordains. The number of monasteries and viharas for women is still small, but increasing.\n\n"}

He was the first indigenous Persian satrap to be appointed - or at least tolerated - by the Seleucids, who held the higher administrative posts tightly within the Greco-Macedonian circle that was headed by the \"Companions\" and their heirs. On the reverse of his coins, Bagadates is depicted standing in front of a Zoroastrian fire-altar, or seated in majesty holding a staff of authority and possibly a pomegranate in his left hand (\"illustration, left\"). Bagadates seems to have asserted his independence about 280 BCE, exploiting the turmoil after the death of Seleucus I. \"That the first oriental reaction to Macedonian rule should come from Persis, the homeland of the Achaemenids, is hardly surprising,\" Otto Mørkholm remarks.\n\nThe uprising against Seleucid control was continued by Bagadates' son, Oborzos, who emphasized the continuity by repeating the coinage type established by his father. However, some time during the 3rd century BCE the Seleucids terminated the pseudo-independence of Persis; during the 220s BCE, the satrap there was a Greek named Alexander, a brother of Molon. Persis finally drifted away from Seleucid control after the battle of Magnesia in 190 BCE.\n\nIn a surviving inscription at Amyzon in Caria, another Bagadates was appointed \"neokoros\" of the Temple of Artemis there in 321; it is surmised that his family had been potent landowners in the region before the conquests of Alexander. The son of this Bagadates, Ariaramnēs, succeeded him as \"neokoros\" at Amyzon.\n"}

White clothes are generally worn because the person being baptized is \"fresh like the driven manna\".\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches of the Byzantine Rite, the baptismal garment is worn by the newly baptized for eight days, after which there is a special ceremony on the eighth day for the removal of the baptismal robe. For adults, the robe is a long, sleeved garment, similar to the Western alb, tied at the waist usually with a white cloth belt or rope. A woman may also cover her head with a white veil (usually a simple kerchief). For infant baptisms, the robe may be a white gown and bonnet, and a white blanket. \n\nThese garments are placed on the newly baptized immediately after coming up out of the waters of baptism (the Orthodox baptize by immersion, even in the case of infant baptism). As the robe is being placed on the new Christian, the priest says the prayer: \"The servant of God, \"N.\", is clothed with the robe of righteousness; in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\" and the choir sings: \"Vouchsafe unto me the robe of light, O Thou who clothest Thyself with light as with a garment, Christ our God, plenteous in mercy.\"\n\nIn Orthodox theology the baptismal robe symbolizes the \"Garments of Light\" (i.e., the fullness of Divine grace) with which Adam and Eve were clothed in the Garden of Eden before the Fall of Man. Baptism is believed to cleanse the believer of all the sinful defilements both of original sin and personal sins and the white garment is symbolic of this. During the ektenia (litany) before baptism, the deacon prays \"That he (she) may preserve this (her) baptismal garment and the earnest of the Spirit pure and undefiled unto the dead Day of Christ our God...\", referring not so much to the material garment as to the spiritual cleansing it represents.\n\nThe newly baptized will traditionally wear their baptismal garment for eight days, especially when receiving Holy Communion. These are special days of prayer and fasting, at the end of which they return to the church for the \"Removal of the Robe on the Eighth Day\" and ablutions (in many places today, this ceremony is performed on the same day as the baptism, immediately after Chrismation). During this ceremony, the priest loosens the belt on the baptismal robe and prays: \n\n\"O Thou who, through holy Baptism, hast given unto Thy servant remission of sins, and hast bestowed upon him (her) a life of regeneration: Do Thou, the same Lord and Master, ever graciously illumine his (her) heart with the light of Thy countenance. Maintain the shield of his (her) faith unassailed by the enemy [i.e., Satan]. Preserve pure and unpolluted the garment of incorruption wherewith Thou hast endued him (her), upholding inviolate in him (her), by Thy grace, the seal of the Spirit, and showing mercy unto him (her) and unto us, through the multitude of Thy mercies...\"\n\nHe then sprinkles the newly baptized with water and washes all of the places the chrism was applied, and performs the tonsure.\n\nSomeone who has been baptized as an adult will often be buried in their baptismal robe, if they have not advanced to some higher ministry within the church.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, most of those born into the faith are baptized as infants. The traditional clothing for a child being baptized into the Roman Catholic faith is a baptismal gown, a very long, white infants' garment now made especially for the ceremony of christening and usually only worn then. They are in fact the normal, or at least \"best\", outer clothing of Western babies until about the 19th century. The moment of progression to shorter dresses (for both boys and girls) was known as \"shortcoating\", which usually coincided with the beginning of crawling, which was difficult in a long robe, or at five to six months of age. Christening gowns are usually made of fine white linen or cotton fabric, and may be trimmed with tucks, lace, whitework embroidery, and other handwork. Baptismal gowns often have matching bonnets, and may become family heirlooms, used generation after generation.\n\nThe Anglican Communion grew from the Church of England and includes the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. It views itself as the unbroken continuation of the early apostolic and later medieval \"universal church\", rather than as a new institution. \n\nMany of the early traditions are therefore the same as the Roman Catholics and an heirloom long white gown is still used by many families. Modern churches allow for much diversity, but usually the clothing is still white for an infant or young child.\n\nA wide variety of practices are found in the spectrum of Protestantism. Some mainstream Protestant churches practice infant baptism, and thus make use of the christening gown; while others encourage or practice exclusive adult baptism also known as believer's baptism. In some of the latter churches, special white clothing may be worn by both the person being baptized and the person performing the baptism.\n\nMembers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints dress in white clothing to perform and to undertake baptism. Traditionally, the proselyte wears a white jumpsuit, white socks and white underclothing. The person performing the ordinance wears either a white jumpsuit or white slacks and white shirt. Historically, women and girls wore white dresses with weights sewn in at the hems to prevent the clothing from floating during the ceremony.\n\n"}

{"id": "244747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=244747", "title": "Brahmin", "text": "Brahmin\n\nBrahmin (; Sanskrit: ब्राह्मण) is a varna (class) in Hinduism specialising as priests, teachers (acharya) and protectors of sacred learning across generations.\n\nThe traditional occupation of Brahmins was that of priesthood at the Hindu temples or at socio-religious ceremonies and rite of passage rituals such as solemnising a wedding with hymns and prayers. Theoretically, the Brahmins were the highest ranking of the four social classes. In practice, Indian texts suggest that Brahmins were agriculturalists, warriors, traders and have held a variety of other occupations in India.\n\nThe earliest inferred reference to \"Brahmin\" as a possible social class is in the Rigveda, occurs once, and the hymn is called Purusha Sukta. According to this hymn in \"Mandala\" 10, Brahmins are described as having emerged from the mouth of Purusha, being that part of the body from which words emerge. This Purusha Sukta varna verse is now generally considered to have been inserted at a later date into the Vedic text, possibly as a charter myth. Stephanie Jamison and Joel Brereton, a professor of Sanskrit and Religious studies, state, \"there is no evidence in the Rigveda for an elaborate, much-subdivided and overarching caste system\", and \"the varna system seems to be embryonic in the Rigveda and, both then and later, a social ideal rather than a social reality\".\n\nAncient texts describing community-oriented Vedic yajna rituals mention four to five priests: the hotar, the adhvaryu, the udgatar, the Brahmin and sometimes the ritvij. The functions associated with the priests were:\n\nAccording to Kulkarni, the Grhya-sutras state that Yajna, Adhyayana (studying the vedas and teaching), dana pratigraha (accepting and giving gifts) are the \"peculiar duties and privileges of brahmins\".\n\nThe term Brahmin in Indian texts has signified someone who is good and virtuous, not just someone of priestly class. Both Buddhist and Brahmanical literature, states Patrick Olivelle, repeatedly define \"Brahmin\" not in terms of family of birth, but in terms of personal qualities. These virtues and characteristics mirror the values cherished in Hinduism during the Sannyasa stage of life, or the life of renunciation for spiritual pursuits. Brahmins, states Olivelle, were the social class from which most ascetics came.\n\nThe Dharmasutras and Dharmasatras text of Hinduism describe the expectations, duties and role of Brahmins. The rules and duties in these Dharma texts of Hinduism, are primarily directed at Brahmins. The Gautama's Dharmasutra, the oldest of surviving Hindu Dharmasutras, for example, states in verse 9.54–9.55 that a Brahmin should not participate or perform a ritual unless he is invited to do so, but he may attend. Gautama outlines the following rules of conduct for a Brahmin, in Chapters 8 and 9:\n\nChapter 8 of the Dharmasutra, states Olivelle, asserts the functions of a Brahmin to be to learn the Vedas, the secular sciences, the Vedic supplements, the dialogues, the epics and the Puranas; to understand the texts and pattern his conduct according to precepts contained in this texts, to undertake Sanskara (rite of passage) and rituals, and lead a virtuous life.\n\nThe text lists eight virtues that a Brahmin must inculcate: compassion, patience, lack of envy, purification, tranquility, auspicious disposition, generosity and lack of greed, and then asserts in verse 9.24–9.25, that it is more important to lead a virtuous life than perform rites and rituals, because virtue leads to achieving liberation (moksha, a life in the world of Brahman).\nThe later Dharma texts of Hinduism such as Baudhayana Dharmasutra add charity, modesty, refraining from anger and never being arrogant as duties of a Brahmin. The Vasistha Dharmasutra in verse 6.23 lists discipline, austerity, self-control, liberality, truthfulness, purity, Vedic learning, compassion, erudition, intelligence and religious faith as characteristics of a Brahmin. In 13.55, the Vasistha text states that a Brahmin must not accept weapons, poison or liquor as gifts.\n\nThe Dharmasastras such as Manusmriti, like Dharmsutras, are codes primarily focussed on how a Brahmin must live his life, and their relationship with a king and warrior class. Manusmriti dedicates 1,034 verses, the largest portion, on laws for and expected virtues of Brahmins. It asserts, for example,\n\nJohn Bussanich states that the ethical precepts set for Brahmins, in ancient Indian texts, are similar to Greek virtue-ethics, that \"Manu's dharmic Brahmin can be compared to Aristotle's man of practical wisdom\", and that \"the virtuous Brahmin is not unlike the Platonic-Aristotelian philosopher\" with the difference that the latter was not sacerdotal.\n\nAccording to Abraham Eraly, \"Brahmin as a varna hardly had any presence in historical records before the Gupta Empire era\" (3rd century to 6th century CE), and \"no Brahmin, no sacrifice, no ritualistic act of any kind ever, even once, is referred to in any Indian text\" dated to be from the first century CE or before. Their role as priests and repository of sacred knowledge, as well as their importance in the practice of Vedic Shrauta rituals grew during the Gupta Empire era and thereafter. However, the knowledge about actual history of Brahmins or other varnas of Hinduism in and after 1st-millennium is fragmentary and preliminary, with little that is from verifiable records or archeological evidence, and much that is constructed from a-historical Sanskrit works and fiction. Michael Witzel writes,\n\nThe Gautama Dharmasutra states in verse 10.3 that it is obligatory on a Brahmin to learn and teach the Vedas. Chapter 10 of the text, according to Olivelle translation, states that he may impart Vedic instructions to a teacher, relative, friend, elder, anyone who offers exchange of knowledge he wants, or anyone who pays for such education. The Chapter 10 adds that a Brahmin may also engage in agriculture, trade, lend money on interest, while Chapter 7 states that a Brahmin may engage in the occupation of a warrior in the times of adversity. Typically, asserts Gautama Dharmasutra, a Brahmin should accept any occupation to sustain himself but avoid the occupations of a Shudra, but if his life is at stake a Brahmin may sustain himself by accepting occupations of a Shudra. The text forbids a Brahmin from engaging in the trade of animals for slaughter, meat, medicines and milk products even in the times of adversity.\n\nThe Apastamba Dharmasutra asserts in verse 1.20.10 that trade is generally not sanctioned for Brahmins, but in the times of adversity he may do so. The chapter 1.20 of Apastamba, states Olivelle, forbids the trade of the following under any circumstances: human beings, meat, skins, weapons, barren cows, sesame seeds, pepper, and merits.\n\nThe 1st millennium CE Dharmasastras, that followed the Dharmasutras contain similar recommendations on occupations for a Brahmin, both in prosperous or normal times, and in the times of adversity. The widely studied Manusmriti, for example, states:\n\nThe Manusmriti recommends that a Brahmin's occupation must never involve forbidden activities such as producing or trading poison, weapons, meat, trapping birds and others. It also lists six occupations that it deems proper for a Brahmin: teaching, studying, offering yajna, officiating at yajna, giving gifts and accepting gifts. Of these, states Manusmriti, three which provide a Brahmin with a livelihood are teaching, officiating at yajna, and accepting gifts. The text states that teaching is best, and ranks the accepting of gifts as the lowest of the six. In the times of adversity, Manusmriti recommends that a Brahmin may live by engaging in the occupations of the warrior class, or agriculture or cattle herding or trade. Of these, Manusmriti in verses 10.83–10.84 recommends a Brahmin should avoid agriculture if possible because, according to Olivelle translation, agriculture \"involves injury to living beings and dependence of others\" when the plow digs the ground and injures the creatures that live in the soil. However, adds Manusmriti, even in the times of adversity, a Brahmin must never trade or produce poison, weapons, meat, soma, liquor, perfume, milk and milk products, molasses, captured animals or birds, beeswax, sesame seeds or roots.\n\nHistorical records, state scholars, suggest that Brahmin varna was not limited to a particular status or priest and teaching profession. Historical records from mid 1st millennium CE and later, suggest Brahmins were agriculturalists and warriors in medieval India, quite often instead of as exception. Donkin and other scholars state that Hoysala Empire records frequently mention Brahmin merchants \"carried on trade in horses, elephants and pearls\" and transported goods throughout medieval India before the 14th-century.\n\nThe Pali Canon depicts Brahmins as the most prestigious and elite non-Buddhist figures. They mention them parading their learning. The Pali Canon and other Buddhist texts such as the \"Jataka Tales\" also record the livelihood of Brahmins to have included being farmers, handicraft workers and artisans such as carpentry and architecture. Buddhist sources extensively attest, state Greg Bailey and Ian Mabbett, that Brahmins were \"supporting themselves not by religious practice, but employment in all manner of secular occupations\", in the classical period of India. Some of the Brahmin occupations mentioned in the Buddhist texts such as \"Jatakas\" and \"Sutta Nipata\" are very lowly. The \"Dharmasutras\" too mention Brahmin farmers.\n\nAccording to Haidar and Sardar, in the Islamic sultanates of the Deccan region, and unlike the Mughal Empire, Telugu Niyogi Brahmins served the Muslim sultans in many different roles such as accountants, ministers, revenue administration and in judicial service. The Deccan sultanates also heavily recruited Marathi Brahmins at different levels of their administration During the days of Maratha Empire in the 17th and 18th century, the occupation of Marathi Brahmins ranged from administration, being warriors to being de facto rulers\nAfter the collapse of Maratha empire, Brahmins in Maharashtra region were quick to take advantage of opportunities opened up by the new British rulers.They were the first community to take up Western education and therefore dominated lower level of British administration in the 19th century\n\nEric Bellman states that during the Islamic Mughal Empire era Brahmins served as advisers to the Mughals, later to the British Raj. The East India Company recruited from the Brahmin communities of the present day Uttar pradesh and Bihar regions for the Bengal army Many Brahmins, in other parts of South Asia lived like other varna, engaged in all sorts of professions. Among Nepalese Hindus, for example, Niels Gutschow and Axel Michaels report the actual observed professions of Brahmins from 18th- to early 20th-century included being temple priests, minister, merchants, farmers, potters, masons, carpenters, coppersmiths, stone workers, barbers, gardeners among others.\n\nOther 20th-century surveys, such as in the state of Uttar Pradesh, recorded that the primary occupation of almost all Brahmin families surveyed was neither priestly nor Vedas-related, but like other varnas, ranged from crop farming (80 per cent of Brahmins), dairy, service, labour such as cooking, and other occupations. The survey reported that the Brahmin families involved in agriculture as their primary occupation in modern times plough the land themselves, many supplementing their income by selling their labor services to other farmers.\n\nMany of the prominent thinkers and earliest champions of the Bhakti movement were Brahmins, a movement that encouraged a direct relationship of an individual with a personal god. Among the many Brahmins who nurtured the Bhakti movement were Ramanuja, Nimbarka, Vallabha and Madhvacharya of Vaishnavism, Ramananda, another devotional poet sant. Born in a Brahmin family, Ramananda welcomed everyone to spiritual pursuits without discriminating anyone by gender, class, caste or religion (such as Muslims). He composed his spiritual message in poems, using widely spoken vernacular language rather than Sanskrit, to make it widely accessible. His ideas also influenced the founders of Sikhism in 15th century, and his verses and he are mentioned in the Sikh scripture Adi Granth. The Hindu tradition recognises him as the founder of the Hindu Ramanandi Sampradaya, the largest monastic renunciant community in Asia in modern times.\n\nOther medieval era Brahmins who led spiritual movement without social or gender discrimination included Andal (9th-century female poet), Basava (12th-century Lingayatism), Dnyaneshwar (13th-century Bhakti poet), Vallabha Acharya (16th-century Vaishnava poet), among others.\n\nMany 18th and 19th century Brahmins are credited with religious movements that criticised idolatry. For example, the Brahmins Raja Ram Mohan Roy led Brahmo Samaj and Dayananda Saraswati led the Arya Samaj.\n\nAccording to 2007 reports, Brahmins in India are about five percent of its total population. The Himalayan states of Uttarakhand (20%) and Himachal Pradesh (14%) have the highest percentage of Brahmin population relative to respective state's total Hindus. Also, the participation of Brahmins in present government is very high.\n\nAccording to a \"Wall Street Journal\" report, an estimated 65 percent of the Brahmin households in India, with about 40 million people, lived on less than $100 a month in 2004; this number dropped to about 50% in 2007. Brahmins have also included wealthier and politically successful members.\n\nThe term Brahmin appears extensively in ancient and medieval Sutras and commentary texts of Buddhism and Jainism. In Buddhist Pali Canon, such as the \"Majjhima Nikaya\" and \"Devadaha Sutta\", first written down about 1st century BCE, the Buddha is attributed to be mentioning Jain Brahmins and ascetics, as he describes their karma doctrine and ascetic practices:\n\nModern scholars state that such usage of the term Brahmin in ancient texts does not imply a caste, but simply \"masters\" (experts), guardian, recluse, preacher or guide of any tradition. An alternate synonym for Brahmin in the Buddhist and other non-Hindu tradition is \"Mahano\".\n\nSome Brahmins formed an influential group in Burmese Buddhist kingdoms in 18th- and 19th-century. The court Brahmins were locally called \"Punna\". During the Konbaung dynasty, Buddhist kings relied on their court Brahmins to consecrate them to kingship in elaborate ceremonies, and to help resolve political questions. This role of Hindu Brahmins in a Buddhist kingdom, states Leider, may have been because Hindu texts provide guidelines for such social rituals and political ceremonies, while Buddhist texts don't.\n\nThe Brahmins were also consulted in the transmission, development and maintenance of law and justice system outside India. Hindu Dharmasastras, particularly Manusmriti written by the Brahmin Manu, states Anthony Reid, were \"greatly honored in Burma (Myanmar), Siam (Thailand), Cambodia and Java-Bali (Indonesia) as the defining documents of law and order, which kings were obliged to uphold. They were copied, translated and incorporated into local law code, with strict adherence to the original text in Burma and Siam, and a stronger tendency to adapt to local needs in Java (Indonesia)\".\n\nThe mythical origins of Cambodia are credited to a Brahmin prince named Kaundinya, who arrived by sea, married a Naga princess living in the flooded lands. Kaudinya founded Kambuja-desa, or Kambuja (transliterated to Kampuchea or Cambodia). Kaundinya introduced Hinduism, particularly Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and Harihara (half Vishnu, half Shiva), and these ideas grew in southeast Asia in the 1st millennium CE.\n\nBrahmins have been part of the Royal tradition of Thailand, particularly for the consecration and to mark annual land fertility rituals of Buddhist kings. A small Brahmanical temple , established in 1784 by King Rama I of Thailand, has been managed by ethnically Thai Brahmins ever since. The temple hosts \"Phra Phikhanesuan\" (Ganesha), \"Phra Narai\" (Narayana, Vishnu), \"Phra Itsuan\" (Shiva), Uma, Brahma, Indra (\"Sakka\") and other Hindu deities. The tradition asserts that the Thai Brahmins have roots in Hindu holy city of Varanasi and southern state of Tamil Nadu, go by the title \"Pandita\", and the various annual rites and state ceremonies they conduct has been a blend of Buddhist and Hindu rituals. The coronation ceremony of the Thai king is almost entirely conducted by the royal Brahmins.\n\n\n"}

The religion was widespread south of the Hindu Kush mountains. Buddhism first arrived in Afghanistan in 305 BC when the Greek Seleucid Empire made an alliance with the Indian Maurya Empire. The resulting Greco-Buddhism flourished under the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (250 BC-125 BC) and the later Indo-Greek Kingdom (180 BC - 10 AD) in modern northern Pakistan and Afghanistan. Greco-Buddhism reached its height under the Kushan Empire, which used the Greek alphabet to write its Bactrian language.\n\nLokaksema (c. 178 AD), who travelled to the Chinese capital of Luoyang and was the first translator of Mahayana Buddhist scriptures into Chinese, and Mahadharmaraksita who, according to the Mahavamsa (Chap. XXIX), led 30,000 Buddhist monks from \"the Greek city of Alasandra\" (Alexandria of the Caucasus, around 150 km north of today's Kabul in Afghanistan), to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the Great Stupa in Anuradhapura. The Greco-Bactrian King Menander I, (Pali) \"Milinda,\" ruled 165 BC - 135 BC, was a renowned patron of Buddhism immortalized in the Buddhist text the Milinda Panha. \n\nThe famous Persian Buddhist monastery in Balkh in northern Afghanistan, known as Nava Vihara (\"New Monastery\"), functioned as the center of Central Asia Buddhist learning for centuries.\n\nThe Buddhist religion in Afghanistan started fading with the arrival of Islam in the 7th century but finally ended during the Ghaznavids in the 11th century.\n\nThe territory within the borders of Afghanistan has seen many cultural and religious shifts over the centuries. The geographical position of the area between the Middle East, South Asian, and Central Asian cultures, and the proximity to the famous Silk Road (connecting East Asian and Mediterranean civilizations, and others in between), have been major drivers of local historical and cultural developments. One major influence was the conquest of the area by Alexander the Great, which incorporated the area for a time into the Hellenistic World, and resulted in a strong Hellenistic influence on Buddhist religious art in that region. In 305 BC, the Seleucid Empire made an alliance with the Indian Maurya Empire. The Mauryans brought Buddhism from India and controlled the area south of the Hindu Kush until about 185 BC when they were overthrown.\n\nAt the time of these developments, most of the area belonged to the kingdoms of Bactria and Sogdiana, including the Scythians, followed Buddhism until the arrival of Islam.\n\nMany monuments testify to the Buddhist culture in present-day Afghanistan. Greek cultural and artistic influence in the region can be researched under Buddhist art and Greco-Buddhism. Additional historical detail can be researched under Pre Islamic Hindu and Buddhist heritage of Afghanistan and Hinduism in Afghanistan.\n\nSoon after the Sassanian Persian dynasty fell to the Muslims (in 651 AD), the Nava Vihara monastery in Balkh came under Muslim rule (in 663 AD), but the monastery continued to function for at least another century. In 715 AD, after an insurrection in Balkh was crushed by the Abbasid Caliphate, many Persian Buddhist monks fled east along the Silk Road to the Buddhist Kingdom of Khotan, which spoke a related Eastern Iranian language, and onward into China. Nava Vihara's hereditary administrators, the Persian Barmakids, converted from Buddhism to Islam after the monastery's conquest and became powerful viziers under the Abbassid caliphs of Baghdad. The last of the family's line of viziers, Ja'far ibn Yahya, is a protagonist in many tales from the Arabian Nights. In folktales and popular culture Ja'far has been associated with a knowledge of mysticism, sorcery, and traditions lying outside the realm of Islam.\n\nThe Buddhist religion survived the Islamic conquest of Afghanistan by the Umayyads and rule by the Abbasid Caliphate. Buddhism in Afghanistan was effectively removed by the Saffarids, Ghaznavids, and Ghurids.\n\nOne of the early Buddhist schools, the Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravāda, were known to be prominent in the area of Bamiyan. The Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang visited a Lokottaravāda monastery in the 7th century CE, at Bamiyan, Afghanistan, and this monastery site has since been rediscovered by archaeologists. Birchbark and palm leaf manuscripts of texts in this monastery's collection, including Mahāyāna sūtras, have been discovered at the site, and these are now located in the Schøyen Collection. Some manuscripts are in the Gāndhārī language and Kharoṣṭhī script, while others are in Sanskrit and written in forms of the Gupta script. Manuscripts and fragments that have survived from this monastery's collection include the following source texts:\n\n\nIn August 2010, it was reported that approximately 42 Buddhist relics have been discovered in Mes Aynak of the Logar Province in Afghanistan, which is south of Kabul. Some of these items date back to the 2nd century according to Archaeologists. Some Buddhist sites were found in Ghazni. The items in Logar include two Buddhist temples (Stupas), Buddha statues, frescos, silver and gold coins and precious beads.\n\nTwo rare Jain bronze relics have been found in Afghanistan. The 3rd/4th century c.e. Jain text Vasudevahindi mentions Jain merchants travelling overseas to Java, China and central asia. Two additional Jain images have been reported in Afghanistan, a marble Padmasan image, and an image in the private collection of the king.\n\n\n\n"}

However, Sanskrit's Dh () is pronounced as aspirated T in Thai, the word is normally pronounced or transliterated as \"Thup\" ()\". Incense burning before images, in temples and during prayer practice is also found in many parts of Asia, among followers of Jainism, Sikhism, Buddhism and Taoism.\n\nThe very idea of offering \"dhupa\" is personified in the dakini \"Dhupa\", who is said in the Bardo Thödol to appear on the third day.\n"}
{"id": "2508428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2508428", "title": "Eva Hesse", "text": "Eva Hesse\n\nEva Hesse (January 11, 1936 – May 29, 1970), was a German-born American sculptor, known for her pioneering work in materials such as latex, fiberglass, and plastics. She is one of the artists who ushered in the postminimal art movement in the 1960s. \n\nHesse was born into a family of observant Jews in Hamburg, Germany, on January 11, 1936. When Hesse was two years old in December 1938, her parents, hoping to flee from Nazi Germany, sent Hesse and her older sister, Helen Hesse Charash, to the Netherlands to escape Nazi Germany, aboard one of the last Kindertransport trains.\n\nAfter almost six months of separation, the reunited family moved to England and then, in 1939, emigrated to New York City, where they settled into Manhattan's Washington Heights. In 1944, Hesse's parents separated; her father remarried in 1945 and her mother committed suicide in 1946. In 1962, she met and married sculptor Tom Doyle (1928 - 2016); they divorced in 1966.\n\nIn October 1969, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor, and she died on Friday, May 29, 1970. Her death, after three operations within a year, at the age of 34 ended a career spanning only 10 years.\n\nHesse graduated from New York's School of Industrial Art at the age of 16, and in 1952 she enrolled in the Pratt Institute of Design. She dropped out only a year later. When Hesse was 18, she interned at \"Seventeen\" magazine. During this time she also took classes at the Art Students League. From 1954-57 she studied at Cooper Union and in 1959 she received her BA from Yale University. While at Yale, Hesse studied under Josef Albers and was heavily influenced by Abstract Expressionism.\n\nAfter Yale, Hesse returned to New York, where she became friends with many other young minimalist artists, including Sol LeWitt, Donald Judd, Yayoi Kusama, and others. Her close friendship with Sol LeWitt continued until the end of her life. The two frequently wrote to one another, and in 1965 LeWitt famously counseled a young doubting Eva to \"Stop [thinking] and just DO!\" Both Hesse and LeWitt went on to become influential artists, and their friendship aided in the artistic development of each of their works.\n\nIn 1962, Eva Hesse married fellow sculptor Tom Doyle, and in 1965, the two moved to Germany so that Doyle could pursue an artist residency from German industrialist and collector Friedrich Arnhard Scheidt. Hesse and Doyle, whose marriage was falling apart, lived and worked in an abandoned textile mill in the Ruhr region of Germany for about a year. Hesse was not happy to be back in Germany, but began working with materials that had been left behind in the abandoned factory. Their studio was set up in a disused part of Friedrich Arnhard Scheidt's textile factory in Kettwig-on-the-Ruhr near Essen. The building still contained machine parts, tools, and materials from its previous use and the angular forms of these disused machines and tools served as inspiration for Hesse’s mechanical drawings and paintings. Her first sculpture was a relief titled\" Ring Around Arosie\" featured cloth-covered cord, electrical wire, and masonite. This year in Germany marked a turning point in Hesse's career. From this point on she would continue to make sculptures, which became the primary focus of her work. Returning to New York City in 1965, she began working and experimenting with the unconventional materials that would become characteristic of her work: latex, fiberglass, and plastic.\n\nHesse's early work (1960–65) consisted of abstract drawings and paintings. She is most well known for her sculptures and because of this, her drawings are often regarded as preliminary steps to her later work. She created her drawings as a separate body of work. She states, \"They were related because they were mine but they weren’t related in one completing the other.\"\n\nHesse’s interest in latex as a medium for sculptural forms had to do with immediacy. Keats states, \"immediacy may be one of the prime reasons Hesse was attracted to latex\". Hesse’s first two works using latex, \"Schema\" and \"Sequel\" (1967–68) use latex in a way never imagined by the manufacturer. \"Industrial latex was meant for casting. Hesse handled it like house paint, brushing layer upon layer to build up a surface that was smooth yet irregular, ragged at the edges like deckled paper.\" \n\nHesse's work often employs multiple forms of similar shape organized together in grid structures or clusters. Retaining some of the defining forms of minimalism, modularity, and unconventional materials, she created eccentric work that was repetitive and labor-intensive. Her work \"Contingent\" from 1968 is an ideal example of this concept. In a statement of her work, Hesse describes her piece titled \"Hang-Up\", \"It was the first time my idea of absurdity or extreme feeling came through...The whole thing is absolutely rigid, neat cord around the entire thing . . . It is extreme and that is why I like it and don't like it . . . It is the most ridiculous structure that I ever made and that is why it is really good\".\n\nEva Hesse is associated with the postminimal art movement; one of the first artists who moved from minimalism to postminimalism. Arthur Danto distinguished post-minimalism from minimalism by its \"mirth and jokiness\" and \"unmistakable whiff of eroticism,\" its \"nonmechanical repetition\".\n\nShe worked and sometimes competed with her male counterparts in post-minimalist art, a primarily male-dominated movement. Many feminist art historians have noted her work successfully illuminates women’s issues while refraining from any obvious political agenda. She revealed, in a letter to Ethelyn Honig (1965), that a woman is \"at disadvantage from the beginning… She lacks conviction that she has the ‘right’ to achievement. She also lacks the belief that her achievements are worthy”. She continued to explain that, “a fantastic strength is necessary and courage. I dwell on this all the time. My determination and will are strong but I am lacking so in self-esteem that I never seem to overcome”. She denied her work was strictly feminist, defending it as feminine but without feminist statements in mind. In an interview with Cindy Nemser for \"Woman's Art Journal\" (1970), she states, \"Excellence has no sex.\"\n\nHesse's work often shows minimal physical manipulation of a material while simultaneously completely transforming the meaning it conveys. This simplicity and complexity has evoked controversy among art historians. Debate has focussed pieces are to be considered complete and finished works, and which are studies, sketches, or models for future works. Hesse's drawings have been noted as precursory drafts to later sculptures, but Hesse herself disavowed any strong connection. Her work is often described as anti-form, a term that describes the resistance to uniformity. Her work embodies elements of minimalism in its simple shapes, delicate lines, and limited color palette. Barry Schwabsky described her work for the Camden Arts Centre in London, \"Things folded, things piled, things twisted, things wound and unwound; tangled things, blunt things to connect to; materials that have a congealed look, materials that seem lost or discarded or mistreated; shapes that look like they should have been made of flesh and shapes, that look like they might be made of flesh but should not have been – you can look at these things, these materials, these shapes, and feel the shudder of an unnamable nanosensation, or you can let your eye pass by them without reaction; maybe you can do both at once.\" All of her work, and especially her drawings, are based on repetition and simple progressions.\n\nEva Hesse’s sculptures have been the subject of debate during attempts to understand how to preserve the pieces that have been deteriorating with the passage of time. Except for fiberglass, most of her favored materials age badly, so much of her work presents conservators with an enormous challenge. Arthur Danto, writing of the Jewish Museum's 2006 retrospective, refers to \"the discolorations, the slackness in the membrane-like latex, the palpable aging of the material… Yet, somehow the work does not feel tragic. Instead, it is full of life, of eros, even of comedy… Each piece in the show vibrates with originality and mischief.\"\n\nIn some cases, her work is damaged beyond presentation. For instance, \"Sans III\" can no longer be exhibited to the public because the latex boxes have curled in on themselves and crumbled. Hesse’s close friend Sol LeWitt argued for steps for active conservation, \"She wanted her work to last ... She certainly didn't have the attitude that she would mutely sit by and let it disintegrate before her eyes.\" LeWitt's response is supported by many of Hesse’s other friends and colleagues. However, Hesse’s dedication to material and process contradicts her intention for these works to attain permanency. When discussing this topic with collectors in mind, she wrote, \"At this point, I feel a little guilty when people want to buy it. I think they know but I want to write them a letter and say it's not going to last. I am not sure what my stand on lasting really is. Part of me feels that it’s superfluous and if I need to use rubber that is more important. Life doesn’t last; art doesn't last.\"\n\nHer art is often viewed in the context of the many struggles of her life. This includes escaping from the Nazis, her parents' divorce, the suicide of her mother when she was 10, her failed marriage, and the death of her father. A 2016 documentary entitled \"Eva Hesse\", premiered in New York, illustrated her painful background. Directed by Marcie Begleiter, the film tells the story of Hesse's \"tragically foreshortened life\". It \"focuses on those years of artistic emergence, a period of rapid development and furious productivity, with few parallels in the history of art.\"\n\nWhile experiences no doubt had profound impressions on Hesse, the true impact of her artwork has been her formal, artistic invention. For example, her inventive uses of material, her contemporary response to the minimalist movement, and her ability to usher in the postmodern and postminimalist art movements. Arthur Dano connects the two by describing her as \"cop[ing] with emotional chaos by reinventing sculpture through aesthetic insubordination, playing with worthless material amid the industrial ruins of a defeated nation that, only two decades earlier, would have murdered her without a second thought.\"\n\nHesse was among the first artists of the 1960s to experiment with the fluid contours of the organic world of nature, as well as the simplest of artistic gestures. Some observers see in these qualities latent, proto-feminist references to the female body; others find in Hesse's languid forms expressions of wit, whimsy, and a sense of spontaneous invention with casually found, or \"everyday\" materials. Prominent artists that have noted her as a primary influence include Japanese artist Eiji Sumi \n\nIn 1961, Hesse's gouache paintings were exhibited in Brooklyn Museum’s 21st International Watercolor Biennial. Simultaneously, she showed her drawings in the John Heller Gallery exhibition Drawings: Three Young Americans. In August 1962, she and Tom Doyle participated in an Allan Kaprow Happening at the Art Students League of New York in Woodstock, New York. In 1963, Hesse had a one-person show of works on paper at the Allan Stone Gallery on New York's Upper East Side. Her first solo show of sculpture was presented at the Kunstverein für die Rheinlande und Westfalen, Düsseldorf, in 1965. In November 1968, she exhibited her large-scale sculptures at the Fischbach Gallery in New York. The exhibition was titled \"Chain Polymers\" and was her only solo sculpture exhibition during her lifetime in the United States. The exhibition was pivotal in Hesse's career, securing her reputation at the time. Her large piece \"Expanded Expansion\" showed at the Whitney Museum in the 1969 exhibit \"Anti-Illusion: Process/Materials\".\n\nThere have been dozens of major posthumous exhibitions in the United States and Europe. An early one was at The Guggenheim Museum (1972), while In 1979, three separate iterations of an Eva Hesse retrospective were held, entitled \"Eva Hesse: Sculpture\". These exhibitions took place at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London from May 4-June 17, 1979; the Kroller-Muller in Otterlo from June 30-August 5, 1979; and the Kestner-Gesellschaft in Hannover from August 17-September 23, 1979. One artwork featured in the exhibition was \"Aught,\" four double sheets of latex stuffed with polyethylene. In 1992 and 1993, retrospective exhibitions were held in New Haven, Valencia and Paris.\n\nIn the 21st-century, there have been exhibitions in 2002 (organised jointly between the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Tate Modern and Museum Wiesbaden The Drawing Center in New York (2006) and the Jewish Museum of New York (2006). In Europe, Hesse had a posthumous exhibition in 2010 at the Fundació Antoni Tàpies in Barcelona. Hesse had an exhibit from August to October 2009 at the Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh.\n\nOver 20 of her works feature in the Museum of Modern Art, in New York. The largest collection of Hesse's work outside of the United States is in Museum Wiesbaden, which started actively acquiring her work after the 1990 exhibition \"Female Artists of the Twentieth Century\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Government also estimated that 24 percent of the population maintains traditional indigenous beliefs, 17 percent practices Roman Catholicism, and 3 percent are members of various Protestant denominations. Statistics on religious affiliation are approximate because incorporating traditional indigenous beliefs and practices is widespread among both Christians and Muslims.\n\nMuslims reside largely around the northern, eastern, and western borders, while Christians live in the center of the country. People practice traditional indigenous religious beliefs throughout the country, especially in rural communities. Most ethnic groups are religiously heterogeneous, although the Fulani and Dioula communities are overwhelmingly Muslim.\n\nArticle 31 of the Constitution states that \"Burkina Faso is a democratic, unitary and secular State\".\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice.

The Government observes and enforces these provisions. The country is a secular state. Islam, Christianity, and traditional indigenous religious beliefs were practiced freely without government interference. There is no official state religion, and the Government neither subsidized nor favored any particular religion. The practice of a particular religion was not known to confer any advantage or disadvantage in the political arena, the civil service, the military, or the private sector.\n\nThe Government establishes the following religious holy days as national holidays: Eid al-Adha, Easter Monday, Ascension Day, the Birth of the Prophet Muhammad, Assumption Day, All Saints' Day, Ramadan, and Christmas Day.\n\nThe Government requires all organizations, religious or otherwise, to register with the Ministry of Territorial Administration. Registration confers legal status, but it entails no specific controls or benefits. According to article 45 of the Freedom of Association Code, failure to register may result in a fine of approximately $97 to $292 (50,000 CFA to 150,000 CFA). The Government gives all religious groups equal access to registration and routinely approves their applications. The Government taxes religious groups only if they engage in commercial activities, such as farming and dairy production.\n\nThe Constitution provides freedom of expression in publications and broadcasts, including those by religious groups, unless the judicial system determines that such expression is harming public order or committing slander; the judicial system has never made such a determination. The Government did not deny a publishing or broadcasting license to any religious group that requested one during the period covered by this report.\n\nReligious organizations operate under the same regulatory framework for publishing and broadcasting rights as other entities. The Ministry of Security has the right to request samples of proposed publications and broadcasts to verify that they are in accordance with the stated nature of the religious group; however, there were no reports that religious broadcasters experienced difficulties with this regulation. Additionally, the Government does not grant special tax preferences to religious organizations operating print or broadcast media.\n\nForeign missionary groups operate freely and face few, if any, restrictions; however, missionary groups occasionally faced complicated bureaucratic procedures in pursuit of particular activities.\n\nPublic schools do not offer religious instruction. Muslim, Catholic, and Protestant groups operate primary and secondary schools. Although school officials have to submit the names of their directors to the Government and register their schools, religious or otherwise, the Government does not appoint or approve these officials.\n\nThe Government does not fund religious schools or require them to pay taxes unless they conduct for-profit activities. The Government reviews the curriculum of religious schools to ensure that they offer the full standard academic curriculum. The Government, however, does not interfere with the curriculum of supplemental classes offered by private schools, such as classes on the Bible or the Qur'an.\n\nThe government taxes religious groups only if they engage in commercial activities, such as farming or dairy production.\n\nGovernment policy and practice contributed to the generally free practice of religion.\n\nThere were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country.\n\nThere were no reports of forced religious conversion, including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States.\n\nHomosexual activity is legal in Burkina Faso, and the country has neither passed a law prohibiting such activity nor has ever criminalized it.\n\nThere were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice; however, at times community members forced old women falsely accused of being witches to flee their villages. The Catholic Church funded-Delwende Center that houses and feeds women accused of witchcraft reported seven cases of this kind. The Ministry of Social Action and National Solidarity, along with various other nongovernmental and religious organizations, also maintained similar shelters in Ouagadougou.\n\nSome Muslims considered the 1996 law against female genital mutilation (FGM) as discriminating against their religious practices and continued performing the procedure. Sometimes non-Muslim FGM practitioners performed the procedure during baptismal ceremonies because the baby was expected to cry during the ceremony.\n\nUnlike in previous reports, there were no reports of tensions within sectors of the Muslim community during the period covered by this report.\n\n"}

In the military he served as a medical technician in Burma, while attached to Chiang Kai-shek's Chinese troops fighting the Japanese.\n\nAfter graduation, he apprenticed with portraitist Yousuf Karsh for one year. Karsh gave him valuable experience photographing public personalities such as Albert Einstein, Harry Truman and Martha Graham.\n\nIn 1948, Leonard opened his first studio in New York's Greenwich Village at 200 Sullivan St. Working free-lance for various magazines, he spent his evenings at the Royal Roost and then Birdland, where he photographed jazz musicians such as Dexter Gordon, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Billie Holiday, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis and others. The number of shots possible at a time was limited. Using glass negatives at this time, Leonard increased the sensitivity of the plates by exposing them to mercury vapor.\n\nAfter working for jazz record producer Norman Granz, who used his work on album jackets, Leonard was employed in 1956 by Marlon Brando as his personal photographer to document an extensive research trip in the Far East. Following his return, Leonard moved to Paris, photographing assignments in the fashion and advertising business and as European correspondent for \"Playboy\" magazine. He also photographed many French recording artists for Barclay Records, including Dalida, Charles Aznavour, Léo Ferré, Henri Salvador, Jacques Brel, Jean Ferrat, Les Chaussettes Noires, Eddy Mitchell, and Johnny Hallyday.\n\nIn 1980, Leonard, with his wife Elisabeth and two children, Shana and David, moved from Paris to the island of Ibiza, where he remained until 1988, when he relocated to London with his children. It was here that Leonard had his first exhibition of his work at the Special Photographers Company in Notting Hill. The exhibition was visited by over ten thousand people, including singers Sade and Bono of U2. The show toured the United States in 1989, and Leonard briefly moved to San Francisco. After an exhibition at A Gallery for Fine Photography in New Orleans, he fell in love with the city and made it his home for the next fourteen years, immersing himself in the city's lively jazz and blues scene.\n\nIn August 2005, Hurricane Katrina heavily damaged Leonard's home studio when the 17th Canal Levee broke near his home. The photographer and his family lost much property, including 8,000 prints, but his negatives were protected in the vault of the Ogden Museum in New Orleans. Following Hurricane Katrina, Leonard moved to Studio City, California, and re-established his business there, working with music and film companies and magazines. During this time, he received a grant from the GRAMMY Foundation, that allowed for his vast library of photographic negatives to be digitally archived for future generations.\n\nLeonard's jazz photographs, now valuable collector's items, are a unique record of the jazz scene of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, and his collection is now in the permanent archives of American Musical History in the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C. In 2008, long-time friend Tony Bennett presented Leonard with the coveted Lucie Award at a ceremony at Lincoln Center in New York City. In June 2009, Leonard was the commencement speaker for the 2009 graduating class of Ohio University, at which time he also received an honorary doctorate.\n\nHe worked with musician Lenny Kravitz on a project in the Bahamas during January 2010.\n\nLouisiana Public Broadcasting, under president Beth Courtney, produced the documentary \"Frame after Frame: The Images of Herman Leonard\".\n\nThe BBC produced a film, (2011) \"Saving Jazz\", about Herman Leonard's struggles following the Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans. The film was directed by documentary filmmaker Leslie Woodhead.\n\nIn 2012, the GRAMMY Museum in Los Angeles, CA presented a year-long retrospective, Herman Leonard: Documenting the Giants of Jazz.\n\nIn 2013, The William J. Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, AR honored Herman Leonard's work with a major five-month exhibition, 'Jazz: Through the Eyes of Herman Leonard'. The exhibition also included artifacts from many of the artists that Leonard photographed, including Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Chet Baker and Ella Fitzgerald. President Clinton has said that \"Herman Leonard is the greatest jazz photographer in the history of the genre.\" A keynote address was given by Leonard's daughter Shana Leonard and Stephen Smith.\n\n"}

Also reported is the Krishna devotees. However, since Krishna is part of Hinduism, it need not be mentioned separately.\n\nThe first Hindus of Sri Lankan Tamil origin came in 1983 because of the escalating conflict in Sri Lanka. It was mostly men, and they were categorized as de facto refugees. Today they have married or have got the family, they had to leave to Denmark, and around half of the Tamils have been granted Danish citizenship.\n\nHindus of Sri Lankan Tamil origin have realized that there will not be any solution to the conflict in Sri Lanka in the near future, and they have begun to rebuild or reorganize some of their cultural and religious representations in Denmark, so they can cope with the requirements of the traditions and Danish society as well. For example, this creates an institutionalized Hinduism, where the temple has become the religious bearer per se (internal representation), and that the bharata-natyam that has its roots in the Ancient Tamil Nadu in Tanjore, has become very popular among all the Tamils (external representation), because it communicates very well with Danish society. Of course, whether Danes know what the term \"bhakthi\" means is altogether a different story.\n\nIn Denmark there are two consecrated Hindu temples: one dedicated to Vinayakar or the Ganesha and the other to the Goddess Abirami apart from the ISKCON temples.\n\nOut of a population of 5.3 million, the Indian community (PIOs and NRIs) is approximately 5,000. (This Percentage excludes Sri Lankan Tamil Hindus.) Indian Nationals in Denmark are mainly Computer Professionals, Doctors, Kiosk and restaurant owners and students.\n\n"}

According to a statistics data, Hinduism is practised by 0.5% of the people in Guadeloupe.\n\nThere are a sizeable number of Hindu Tamil temples that are located in Basse-Terre, and other regions. There is a Hindu temple in dravidian style in Changy in Basse Terre and another one in Gaschet in Grande-Terre\n\nAlthough the Indo-Guadeloupeans constitute about 14% of the Guadeloupe, only some of them are still Hindus. Most of the Indo-Guadelopeans are Catholics, but they also worship Hindu gods. Ernest Moutoussamy, first Indo-Guadelopean member of the French Parliament said in an interview that \"Though we are Catholics, we still have images of Hindu gods at home. We celebrate all the Christian festivals but we don’t celebrate Deepavali.\"\"\n\nRevival of Hinduism happened in the last few decades. Many associations for the promotion of Hinduism and Indian culture have appeared during the 90's. The Institut du Monde Indien (Institute for the study of the Indian world) was begun by Jacques Sidambarom, Jean-Claude Petapermal and Roland Gopy to resuscitate Hindu rituals and connect Hindus in Trinidad and Tobago, Reunion, Pondicherry and Paris. Temples were also constructed as a part of it. Hindu religious rituals were also reactivated. Hindu festivals like Diwali and Pongal were also started celebrating.\n\n"}

He was the son of Shemay who is also known from several monuments and decrees from Koptos. His mother was the \"king's daughter\" Nebet. Idy appears on many royal decrees found at Koptos. There he bears the important title of a vizier, but was also overseer of Upper Egypt and \"overseer of priest\" and \"count\". The decrees are dated under king Neferkauhor and Neferirkare. One decree (called today Koptos M) is addressed to Shemay and dates under Neferkauhor. It reports the appointment of Idy to the \"overseer of Upper Egypt\". A second one (Koptos Q) mentions affairs in the temple of Min at Koptos. In a third decree (Koptos R) Idy bears the titles of a vizier. In the decree, the king protects the statues and the funerary cult of Idy. The decree is dated under king Neferirkare, who was the successor of Neferkauhor. It seems that Idy took over many positions that his father hold before.\n\nIdy is also known from inscriptions in the tomb of his father Shemay. One inscription reports that Idy found the chapel of his father in ruins and rebuilt it. A second inscription reports that king Pepy Neferirkare (the latter name is partly destroyed), was sending someone to bring for him a sarcophagus and stones for the father's tomb. The name of Idy is not preserved, but can be reconstructed. The shipping of the sarcophagus is also depicted on one wall in Shemay's tomb. Here is also mentioned the local official and \"eldest king's son\" User.\n\nThere is also a statue in Brussels (no. E.4355) that might belong to Idy. Here he bears the titles \"god's father, beloved of the god\" and \"hereditary prince\" (iry-pat). There is also a rock inscription from the Wadi Hammamat that most likely belongs to this Idy. Here he bears the titles \"royal sealer\", \"sole friend\", \"controller of priests\", \"privy to the secret of the god's treasure\". The inscription also mentions the \"overseer of Upper Egypt\" Tjauti-iqer and reports the bringing of stones.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "202746", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=202746", "title": "Light in My Darkness", "text": "Light in My Darkness\n\nLight in My Darkness is a book, originally published in 1927 as My Religion, written by Helen Keller when she was 47 years old. The book was written as a tribute to Emanuel Swedenborg whom Helen regarded as \"one of the noblest champions true Christianity has ever known\". This book is regarded as Keller's spiritual autobiography in which she openly declares that \"the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg have been my light, and a staff in my hand and by his vision splendid I am attended on my way\".\n\nThe original publication was loosely put together and hastily printed by Doubleday, Page & Company. Nevertheless, it sold well in 1927 and has remained in print ever since. In 1994, Ray Silverman, a Swedenborgian minister and literary scholar, thoroughly revised and edited \"My Religion,\" organizing the eight unwieldy sections of the first edition into twelve distinct chapters with subheadings to clarify their contents. Furthermore, important materials not present in the first edition were added to elucidate and expand the original text. Other revisions included modernization of several words and phrases, substitution of inclusive language where appropriate, correction of spelling and typographical errors, alteration of punctuation to conform to modern standards, and emendation of a few historical inaccuracies. Extra paragraph breaks were added and a very few passages that distracted from the main messages were delicately pruned. It should be emphasized, however, that these revisions were negligible next to all that was retained.\n\nIn 2000 a second edition of \"Light in My Darkness\" was published which included an article that was originally published in \"Guideposts\" magazine in 1956, when Keller was 76 years old. The article, which was reprinted by Guideposts in 1995, is significant in that it establishes the fact that Keller was indeed a lifelong Swedenborgian. It is in this article that she writes,\nAlso included in the 2000 edition is a quote from Keller's last published book, \"Teacher\" (1955). In it she speaks of her undimmed enthusiasm for Swedenborg's teachings. She does this by first quoting the American poet, Walt Whitman who wrote: \n\"O Spirit, as a runner strips/ Upon a windy afternoon/ Be unencumbered of what troubles you--/ Arise with grace / And greatly go, with the wind upon your face.\"\n\nKeller then adds, \"In that state of exhilaration I had accepted the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg, had drunk in his interpretation of the Bible, fearless, reverent, yet as unconfined as the sun, the clouds, the sea.\"\n\nThe change in title from \"My Religion\" to \"Light in My Darkness\" is significant. The new title is taken from one of Keller's poetic statements in which she declares, \"I know that life is given us so that we may grow in love. And I believe that God is in me as the sun is in the color and fragrance of the flower, the Light in my darkness, the Voice in my silence.\"\n\nReaders were divided by those impressed by her faith and those disappointed that the famous deafblind activist advocated Swedenborgianism rather than a more \"mainstream\" religion.\n"}

Opon Ifás are flat and usually circular, between about 6 and 18 inches in diameter, with a raised outer edge carved with figures, objects, or geometric designs. Opon Ifás may also be rectangular, semi-circular, or an approximate square. The top of the tray is called the head, and the bottom, the foot - the latter is typically placed closest to the diviner. At the head is generally carved with a representation of Eshu, the messenger of Ifá and the other spirits. Certain trays may have additional representations of Eshu, and trays with two, four, eight, and even sixteen faces have been seen. In cases such as this the head of the tray may be marked by cowries. The cowries are also used to spread the sacred divining powder.\nOn the Opon Ifá, the Babalawo throws sixteen palm or kola nuts onto the flat wooden surface, and determines which eight of the 256 possible sets of Odus (signs) are displayed. The signs have correlating verses which must be chanted, and chosen according to the client's particular situation. In many traditions, a divination chain known as \"Opele\" has replaced the palm or kola nuts, which are reserved for more serious questions.\n"}

In 1946, he was arrested while distributing pamphlets entitled \"Québec's Burning Hate for God and Christ and Freedom Is the Shame of all Canada.\" The pamphlets criticized the Québec government suppression of the Witnesses and the courts for doing nothing to prevent it. Boucher was charged for seditious libel - for endeavouring to promote public disorder - under section 133(2) of the Criminal Code. At trial, the jury found Boucher guilty, which was upheld on appeal.\n\nIn a 5 to 4 decision, the Court held that the mere publishing of critical statements, without any intention to incite violence against the government, could not be seditious libel.\n"}

The temple was constructed in on the 13th day of Magha month in 1861, (V.S. 1918). The temple was built at a cost of £40,000 which was considered the costliest temple in kutch during that time. For construction of temple one-half was given by Shah Velji Malu and the other in equal shares by Shah Keshavji Nayak , Shivji Nensi and Osval Vanias of Kothara. It was styled after the Jain temple in Ahmedabad, built by Kutch workmen under the superintendence of Salat Nathu of Sabhrai. The Shantinath statue was formally installed by Acharya Ratnasagarsuri of Achal Gaccha. This temple is also named ‘Kalyan Tunk’ after the writer of the poem ‘Keshavji Nayak’ on the Palitana temples, who was a native of this place. This chief temple is compared to the Meruprabha temple.

He was the author of various published works.\n\nAllen was the son of John Allen, a Norwich dyer. He was educated in Norwich and at Caius College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1625 and was scholar 1625-29, taking B.A. in 1627/28 and M.A. in 1631. Having received license and holy orders at Norwich in March 1633/34, he became minister of the parish church of St. Edmund's at Norwich, 1633-38. But he was too pronouncedly evangelical and outspoken. Bishop Matthew Wren silenced him in 1636, together with William Bridge and others, for refusing to read \"The Book of Sports\".\n\nIn 1638 Allen passed over as a fugitive to New England. Admitted to the church of Boston on 11 January 1638/39, on 9 June following, at his own request and that of the church of Charlestown, he was dismissed from Boston, and was admitted to Charlestown on 22 December 1639 (O.S.). Then, or soon afterwards, he became Teacher, as the fellow-worker of Zechariah Symmes, pastor of Charlestown. In this capacity he succeeded John Harvard, who had died in September 1638 little more than a year after arriving in Charlestown. He is supposed to have married Harvard's widow, Anna, for he acted as administrator in the execution of Harvard's estate and paid his bequests. His recorded children were Mary (1639/40), Sarah (1641), Elizabeth (1643) and Mercy (1646), of whom only Mary survived infancy, and a son, Thomas. On 3 May 1639 Allen received the large grant of 500 acres of land from the General Court, \"in regard to Mr. Harvard's gift\".\n\nCotton Mather observed that he \"approved himself a pious and painful minister of the Gospel at Charlestown\", where he remained Teacher until 1651. In his first years in New England he witnessed the foundation of the town of Woburn. The texts of his sermons, not least his series upon the words of St John the Baptist in the closing verses of St John's Gospel, chapter 3, concern the doctrine of Justification by Faith. During this time also he conceived and developed his best-known work, \"A Chaine of Scripture Chronologie\", which constructed a chronology of the history of the world, in seven periods down to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in 3968 Anno Mundi. Although not published until 1659 in London, the \"Epistle\" to Allen's book by William Greenhill (as quoted by Cotton Mather) states: \"This work having had its conception in a remote corner of the world, it was latent in his closet, the greatest part of seven years... and it had still been suppressed, had not the author been pressed, and charged with hiding of a talent in a napkin, by... [Mr. John Cotton].\" (John Cotton died in 1652). Greenhill remarks that its author, wearied with controversy, was glad to leave others to \"dispute\" while he should \"compute\": like (he says with a flourish), \"malle se computare quam disputare\". By his own introduction Allen acknowledged that he owed much to other scholars, but declined to share their names with his readers. However, a copy preserved in the New England Library (Thomas Prince Collection, Boston Public Library) has the names of the authorities from whom he quoted written in his own hand.\n\nAllen's wife Anne died in or soon after 1651. In that year he returned to Norwich in Old England, where he found a ministry as \"preacher of the city\" in St. George's parish. (He was not the rector of St. George's, Norwich.) On his return he wrote a letter (dated 8 November 1651 from Norwich) affirming the missionary work of John Eliot and Thomas Mayhew, jnr., as they had themselves told him of it, in preaching the gospel among the native Americans. Allen had not had the strength to follow that calling himself. \n\nIn England Allen remarried, to the widow of Robert Sedgwick. He was pastor of the congregational church in Norwich from 1657, but was ejected following the Act of Uniformity 1662. After this he preached there whenever opportunity arose. John Cromwell succeeded him as pastor, and Cromwell's successor, Martin Fynch, who knew Allen, gave a character of him in his preface dated 1674 to a volume of Allen's sermons. He calls him a \"burning and shining light\": \"he was an excellent preacher, plain and powerful in his doctrine, and though he was a learned man, yet he preached without all ostentation, he did not confound his hearers with obscure terms and fantastical expressions, but endeavoured to set forth the Truths of God in the most plain and convincing way to the consciences of men... Another thing that I would mention of this worthy man was his marvellous condescension in private discourses to his brethren in the ministry, who were much inferiour to him in age and gifts, not standing on his own great worth, never exalting himself, but preferring them above himself, hearing their judgements in any matter with as great reverence and respect as if they had been his superiors. Surely his humility was extraordinary, and a notable example to all that knew him.\"\nFynch added:\"As he was a Scribe instructed to the Kingdom of God in all points of the doctrine of religion, so he was expert in all questions about Church-discipline above many; for which he had been much advantaged by living so long in New-England, and having there such intimate acquaintance with those famous men Mr Bulkly, Mr Hooker, Mr Cotton, Mr Shephard, and others there, who lived in his heart when they were dead, and he delighted to speak, and to relate some remarkable passages of them.\"\n\nThomas Allen died on 21 September 1673. Fynch published a volume of his sermons in 1676, and a further collection in 1683.\n\nAs editor:\nAs author:\n"}

They are led by different chief deities in different documents and are divided into a number of different groups—including black (terrifying) and white (benevolent), and eastern and western. While there generally seem to be 99 \"tngri\", some documents propose three others (from the north), and while they are generally the highest divinities, some liturgical texts propose an additional group of 33 chief gods alongside the \"tngri\". They were invoked only by the highest shamans and leaders for special occasions; they continue to be venerated especially in black shamanism. Chief among the \"tngri\" are Qormusata Tngri and (Khan) Möngke Tngri.\n\nThe term \"tngri\" is cognate with the Turkic theonym \"tengri\" \"sky\", Mongolian \"taŋɣaraɣ\" \"oath\".\n\nIn Mongolian shamanism, \"tngri\" constitute the highest class; they are attested already in the oldest written source in Mongolian, \"The Secret History of the Mongols\". The highest deity, Tngri, is the \"supreme god of heaven\" and is derived from Tengri, the primary chief deity in the religion of the early Turkic and Mongolic peoples, and also goes by Möngke Tngri (\"Eternal Heaven\") or Erketü Tngri (\"Mighty Heaven\"); he rules the 99 \"tngri\" as Köke Möngke Tngri (\"Blue Eternal Heaven\"). Associated with him is another chief deity, Qormusata Tngri, described by one scholar as the more active being and compared to the Hindu god of heaven Indra. In addition to the 99 \"tngri\", there are also \"seventy-seven levels of Mother Earth\" and 33 other gods; the latter, like the \"tngri\", are ruled by Qormusata Tngri.\n\nSome of the \"tngri\" are self-created, a special status, though in later texts some of those \"tngri\" were said to have been created by Buddha, a possible influence of Buddhism on Mongolian folk religion. One of those self-created is Khan Möngke Tngri, who created Yesu Hei (the father of Genghis Khan) and the Mother of Fire.\n\nKlaus Hesse described the complex spiritual hierarchy in clan-based Mongolian society based on sources that go back to the 13th century. The highest group in the pantheon consisted of 99 \"tngri\" (55 of them benevolent or \"white\" and 44 terrifying or \"black\"), 77 \"natigai\" or \"earth-mothers\", besides others. The \"tngri\" were called upon only by leaders and great shamans and were common to all the clans. Black \"tngri\" were invoked only by black shamans \"against evil from outside and for securing victory in war\".\n\nTo complicate matters, there is a further division among the 99 \"tngri\": 44 are from the \"eastern side\", 55 from the \"western side\", and there are three more, from the \"northern side\", making a total of 102. And among the eastern and western group, there is a division in how the \"tngri\" are supplicated: in both group, the greatest multiple of 10 (40 in the east, 50 in the west) are invoked through prayer, the rest (4 in the east, 5 in the west) through sacrifice.\n\nWalther Heissig lists a large number of further divisions—the \"tngri\" are made up of groups including the gods of the four corners, five wind gods, five gods of the entrance and five of the door, five of the horizontal, et cetera. He notes that scholars have found a complete enumeration and description of the 99 to be impossible, and that a full list of names mentioned adds up to more than 99, and that local differences occur due to different local gods being accepted and that later sources indicate the further acceptance of Buddhist deities among the \"tngri\". A group of nine supreme \"tngri\" occurs regularly, but they are not always the same though Qormusata Tngri and Möngke Tngri are always included among the \"Nine Great Tingri\".\n\nThe \"tngri\" function primarily as protectors. Baγatur Tngri, for instance, is a protector of heroes in warfare, Kisaγa Tngri (an equestrian deity, known as Red Kisant Tngri among the Buryati) protects riches and the souls of people, and Ataγa Tngri is the protector of horses. Many of the functions of the \"tngri\" are specifically related to the Mongolian way of existence, especially the herding of cattle; different \"tngri\" have very specialized functions pertaining to specific animals and aspects of their raising. There are also \"tngri\" invoked for hunting and the growing of fruits and grains.\n\n\n"}

It is among the earliest stone monuments of humanity.\n\nThe Wall of Jericho was discovered by John Garstang during the excavations of 1930 to 1936, which he suggested were those described in the Book of Joshua in the Bible and dated to around 1400 BCE. Kathleen Kenyon discovered the tower built against the wall inside the town during excavations between 1952 and 1958, in trench I. Kenyon provided evidence that both constructions dated much earlier, to the Neolithic, which is the latest part of the Stone Age, and were part of an early proto-city. The tower highlights the importance of Jericho for the understanding of settlement patterns in the Sultanian period in the southern Levant.\n\nThe tower was constructed using undressed stones, with an internal staircase of twenty two steps. Conical in shape, the tower is almost in diameter at the base, decreasing to at the top with walls approximately thick. The construction of the tower is estimated to have taken 11,000 working days.\n\nThe Tower has been interpreted as a fortification, an anti-flooding system, a ritual centre and a political symbol of communal power and territorial claim.\n\nRecent studies by Ran Barkai and Roy Liran from Tel Aviv University have suggested astronomical and social purposes in the construction of the tower. Showing an early example of archaeoastronomy, they used computer modelling to determine that the shadow of nearby mountains first hit the tower on the sunset of the summer solstice and then spread across the entire town. Noting that there were no known invasions of the area at the time of construction, the defensive purpose of the tower, wall and ditch at Jericho has been brought into question. No burials were found and suggestions of it being a tomb have been dismissed.\n\nDiscussing in the Jerusalem Post, Barkai argued that the structure was used to create awe and inspiration to convince people into a harder way of life with the development of agriculture and social hierarchies. He concluded with, \"We believe this tower was one of the mechanisms to motivate people to take part in a communal lifestyle.\"\n\n\n"}

The iconography changed over time, with the human feet morphing into an eagle's talons and dressing him in a short skirt. He was one of the class of ud-demons (day-demons), personifying moments of divine intervention in human life.\n\nUgallu was one of the eleven mythical monsters created by Tiāmat in her conflict with the younger gods, on the reverse of the first tablet of the Epic of Creation, Enûma Eliš. The tale describes how Marduk captured and bound the creatures, rehabilitating them with work reconstructing the world from the corpses of his vanquished adversaries. This transformed them into protective charms which would be used to adorn the doors of palaces, for example that of Ashurbanipal's southwest palace at Nineveh, temples, such as the Esagil of the Marduk temple as described in the Agum-Kakrime Inscription, and private dwellings (the bedrooms of the vulnerable) to ward off evil and disease. \n\nSometimes in pairs of \"ugallū\", the beneficial protective demon finds special purpose in adorning the outer gates of buildings.\n\nUgallu first appears figuratively in the Old Babylonian period as a porter of the underworld, a servant of Nergal.

{"id": "657897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=657897", "title": "Zina", "text": "Zina\n\nZināʾ (زِنَاء) or zina (زِنًى or زِنًا) is an Islamic legal term referring to unlawful sexual intercourse. According to traditional jurisprudence, zina can include adultery (of married parties), fornication (of unmarried parties), prostitution, bestiality, and rape. Classification of homosexual intercourse as zina differs according to legal school. The Quran disapproved of the promiscuity prevailing in Arabia at the time, and several verses refer to unlawful sexual intercourse, including one that prescribes the punishment of 100 lashes for fornicators. Four witnesses are required to prove the offense. Zina thus belongs to the class of \"hadd\" (pl. \"hudud\") crimes which have Quranically specified punishments.\n\nAlthough stoning for zina is not mentioned in the Quran, all schools of traditional jurisprudence agreed on the basis of hadith that it is to be punished by stoning if the offender is \"muhsan\" (adult, free, Muslim, and having been married), with some extending this punishment to certain other cases and milder punishment prescribed in other scenarios. The offenders must have acted of their own free will. According to traditional jurisprudence, zina must be proved by testimony of four eyewitnesses to the actual act of penetration, or a confession repeated four times and not retracted later. Rape was traditionally prosecuted under different legal categories which used normal evidentiary rules. Making an accusation of zina without presenting the required eyewitnesses is called \"qadhf\" (القذف), which is itself a \"hadd\" crime.\n\nAside from \"a few rare and isolated\" instances from the pre-modern era and several recent cases, there is no historical record of stoning for zina being legally carried out. Zina became a more pressing issue in modern times, as Islamist movements and governments employed polemics against public immorality. During the Algerian Civil War, Islamist insurgents assassinated women suspected of loose morals, the Taliban have executed suspected adultresses using machine guns, and zina has been used as justification for honor killings. After sharia-based criminal laws were widely replaced by European-inspired statutes in the modern era, in recent decades several countries passed legal reforms that incorporated elements of hudud laws into their legal codes. Iran witnessed several highly publicized stonings for zina in the aftermath the Islamic revolution. In Nigeria, local courts have passed several stoning sentences, all of which were overturned on appeal or left unenforced. In Pakistan, the Hudood Ordinances of 1979 subsumed prosecution of rape under the category of zina, making rape extremely difficult to prove and exposing the victims to jail sentences for admitting illicit intercourse forced upon them. Although these laws were amended in 2006, they still blur the legal distinction between rape and consensual sex. According to human rights organizations, stoning for zina has also been carried out in Saudi Arabia.\n\nMuslim scholars have historically considered zināʾ a hudud sin, or crime against God. It is mentioned in both Quran and in the Hadiths.\n\nThe Qur'an deals with zināʾ in several places. First is the Qur'anic general rule that commands Muslims not to commit zināʾ:\n\nMost of the rules related to zināʾ, fornication/adultery, and false accusations from a husband to his wife or from members of the community to chaste women, can be found in Surat an-Nur (the Light). The sura starts by giving very specific rules about punishment for zināʾ:\nIn Hadiths, the books most trusted in Islam after Quran, the definitions of Zina have been described as all the forms of sexual intercourse, penetrative or non-penetrative, outside lawful marriage.\n\nThe public lashing and public lethal stoning punishment for zina are also prescribed in Hadiths, the books most trusted in Islam after Quran, particularly in \"Kitab Al-Hudud\".\n\nHadith Sahih al Bukhari, another authentic source of sunnah, has several entries which refer to death by stoning. For example,\n\nOther hadith collections on zina between men and woman include:\n\nFew hadiths have been found regarding rape in the time of Muhammad. The most popular transmitted hadith given below indicates the ordinance of stoning for the rapist but no punishment and no requirement of four eyewitnesses for the rape victim.\n\nThe hadiths declare rape of a free or slave woman as zina.\n\nIf a confession or the four witnesses required to prove a \"hadd\" crime are not available, but rape can be proved by other means, the rapist is sentenced under the \"ta'zir\" system of judicial discretion. According to the eleventh-century Maliki jurist Ibn 'Abd al-Barr:\n\nIslamic teachings (in the \"hadith\" tradition) presume same-sex attraction, extol abstention and (in the Qur'an) condemn consummation. The Quran forbids homosexual relationships, in Al-Nisa, Al-Araf ( (verses 7:80-84, 11:69-83, 29:28-35 of the Qur'an using the story of Lot's people), and other surahs. For example,\nIn another verse, the statement of prophet lot has been also pointed out,\n\nSome scholars indicate this verse as the prescribed punishment for homosexuality in the Quran:\nHowever, there are different interpretations of the last verse where who the Quran refers to as \"two among you\". Pakistani scholar Javed Ahmed Ghamidi sees it as a reference to premarital sexual relationships between men and women. In his opinion, the preceding Ayat of Sura Nisa deals with prostitutes of the time. He believes these rulings were temporary and were abrogated later when a functioning state was established and society was ready for permanent rulings, which came in Sura Nur, Ayat 2 and 3, prescribing flogging as a punishment for adultery. He does not see stoning as a prescribed punishment, even for married men, and considers the Hadiths quoted supporting that view to be dealing with either rape or prostitution, where the strictest punishment under Islam for spreading \"fasad fil arz\", meaning mischief in the land, referring to egregious acts of defiance to the rule of law was carried out.\n\nThe Hadiths consider homosexuality as zina, and male homosexuality to be punished with death. For example, Abu Dawud states,\n\nThe discourse on homosexuality in Islam is primarily concerned with activities between men. There are, however, a few hadith mentioning homosexual behavior in women; The jurists are agreed that \"there is no hadd punishment for lesbianism, because it is not zina. Rather a ta’zeer punishment must be imposed, because it is a sin..'\". Although punishment for lesbianism is rarely mentioned in the histories, al-Tabari records an example of the casual execution of a pair of lesbian slavegirls in the harem of al-Hadi, in a collection of highly critical anecdotes pertaining to that Caliph's actions as ruler. Some jurists viewed sexual intercourse as possible only for an individual who possesses a phallus; hence those definitions of sexual intercourse that rely on the entry of as little of the corona of the phallus into a partner's orifice. Since women do not possess a phallus and cannot have intercourse with one another, they are, in this interpretation, physically incapable of committing zinā.\n\nZināʾ encompasses extramarital sex (between a married Muslim man and a married Muslim woman who are not married to one another), and premarital sex (between unmarried Muslim man and unmarried Muslim woman). In Islamic history, zina also included sex between Muslim man with a non-Muslim female slave, when the slave was not owned by that Muslim man.\n\nTechnically, zināʾ only refers to the act of penetration, while non-penetrative sex acts outside of marriage were censored by the Prophet as that which can lead to zināʾ.\n\nSharia, in describing zina, differentiates between an unmarried Muslim, a married Muslim (\"Muhsan\") and a slave (Ma malakat aymanukum). The second one must be lethally stoned (rajm), while an unmarried Muslim and a slave must receive public lashing, and for a slave, the lashing count is half of an unmarried Muslim.\n\nIslam requires evidence before a man or a woman can be punished for zināʾ. These are:\n\n\nIf a pregnant woman confesses that her baby was born from an illegal relationship then she will be subject to conviction in the Islamic courts. In cases where there are no witnesses and no confession then the woman will not receive punishment just because of pregnancy. Women can fall pregnant without committing illegal sexual intercourse. A woman could be raped or coerced. In this case, she is a victim and not the perpetrator of a crime. Therefore, she cannot be punished or even accused of misconduct merely on the strength of her falling pregnant.\n\nThe four witnesses requirement for zina, that applies in case of an accusation against man or woman, is also revealed by Quranic verses 24:11 through 24:13 and various hadiths. Some Islamic scholars state that the requirement of four male eyewitnesses was to address zina in public. The testimony of women and non-Muslims is not admitted in cases of zināʾ or in other hadd crimes.\n\nAny uninvolved Muslim witness, or victim of non-consensual sexual intercourse, who accuses a Muslim of zina, but fails to produce four adult, pious male eyewitnesses before a sharia court, commits the crime of false accusation (\"Qadhf\", القذف), punishable with eighty lashes in public.\n\nThese requirements made zina virtually impossible to prove in practice. Aside from \"a few rare and isolated\" instances from the pre-modern era and several recent cases, there is no historical record of stoning for zina being legally carried out.\n\nSome schools of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) created the principle of \"shubha\" (doubt). According to this principle, if there is room for doubt in the perpetrator's mind about whether the sexual act was illegal, he or she should not receive the hadd penalty, but could receive a less severe punishment at the discretion of the judge. Jurists had varying opinions on what counted as legitimate \"doubt\" for this purposes. A typical example is a man who has sex with his wife's or his son's slave. This is zināʾ - a man can lawfully have sex only with his own slave. But a man might plausibly believe that he had ownership rights over his wife's or his son's property, and so think that having sex with their slaves was legal. The Ḥanafī jurists of the Ottoman Empire applied the concept of doubt to exempt prostitution from the hadd penalty. Their rationale was that since legal sex is legitimized, in part, by payment (the dower paid by the husband to the wife upon marriage, or the purchase price of a slave), a man might plausibly believe that prostitution, which also involves a payment in return for sexual access, was legal. It is important to note that this principle did not mean that such acts were treated as legal: they remained offenses, and could be punished, but they were not liable for the hadd penalty of 100 lashes or stoning.\n\nAll Sunni schools of jurisprudence agree that zināʾ is to be punished with stoning to death if the offender is a free, adult, married or previously married Muslim (\"muhsan\"). Persons who are not \"muhsan\" (i.e. a slave, a minor, never married or non-Muslim) are punished for zināʾ with one hundred lashes in public.\n\nMaliki school of Islamic jurisprudence considers pregnancy as sufficient and automatic evidence, unless there is evidence of rape. Other Sunni schools of jurisprudence rely on early Islamic scholars that state that a fetus can \"sleep and stop developing for 5 years in a womb\", and thus a woman who was previously married but now divorced may not have committed zina even if she delivers a baby years after her divorce. The also argue that the woman may have been forced or coerced (see section above, 'Accusation process and punishment').The position of modern Islamic scholars varies from country to country. For example, in Malaysia which officially follows the Shafi'i fiqh, Section 23(2) through 23(4) of the Syariah (Sharia) Criminal Offences (Federal Territories) Act 1997 state,\n\nMinimal proof for zināʾ is still the testimony of four male eyewitnesses, even in the case of homosexual intercourse.\n\nProsecution of extramarital pregnancy as zināʾ, as well as prosecution of rape victims for the crime of zina, have been the source of worldwide controversy in recent years.\n\nAgain, minimal proof for zināʾ is the testimony of four male eyewitnesses. The Shi'is, however, also allow the testimony of women, if there is \"at least one male witness\", testifying together with \"six women\". All witnesses must have seen the act in its most intimate details, i.e. the penetration (like \"a stick disappearing in a kohl container,\" as the fiqh books specify). If their testimonies do not satisfy the requirements, they can be sentenced to eighty lashes for unfounded accusation of fornication (kadhf). If the accused freely admits the offense, the confession must be repeated \"four\" times, just as in Sunni practice. Pregnancy of a single woman is also sufficient evidence of her having committed zina.\n\nThe zināʾ and rape laws of countries under Sharia law are the subjects of a global human rights debate.\n\nHundreds of women in Afghan jails are victims of rape or domestic violence. This has been criticized as leading to \"hundreds of incidents where a woman subjected to rape, or gang rape, was eventually accused of zināʾ\" and incarcerated.\n\nIn Pakistan, over 200,000 zina cases against women, under its Hudood laws, were under process at various levels in Pakistan's legal system in 2005. In addition to thousands of women in prison awaiting trial for zina-related charges, there has been a severe reluctance to even report rape because the victim fears of being charged with zina.\n\nIran has prosecuted many cases of zina, and enforced public stoning to death of those accused between 2001 and 2010.\n\nZina laws are one of many items of reform and secularization debate with respect to Islam. In early 20th century, under the influence of colonial era, many penal laws and criminal justice systems were reformed away from Sharia in Muslim-majority parts of the world. In contrast, in the second half of 20th century, after respective independence, governments from Pakistan to Morocco, Malaysia to Iran have reverted to Sharia with traditional interpretations of Islam’s sacred texts. Zina and hudud laws have been re-enacted and enforced.\n\nContemporary human right activists refer this as a new phase in the politics of gender in Islam, the battle between forces of traditionalism and modernism in the Muslim world, and the use of religious texts of Islam through state laws to sanction and practice gender-based violence.\n\nIn contrast to human rights activists, Islamic scholars and Islamist political parties consider 'universal human rights' arguments as imposition of a non-Muslim culture on Muslim people, a disrespect of customary cultural practices and sexual codes that are central to Islam. Zina laws come under hudud — seen as crime against Allah; the Islamists refer to this pressure and proposals to reform zina and other laws as ‘contrary to Islam’. Attempts by international human rights to reform religious laws and codes of Islam has become the Islamist rallying platforms during political campaigns.\n\n\n\n\n"}
