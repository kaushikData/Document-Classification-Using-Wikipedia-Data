When Brahma appeared before him, he was unable to express his desire clearly. Brahma took advantage of the ambiguity of the words and granted him the boon, but with the twist that made him invincible only when he was in the form of a demon, not in any disguise. Adi was aware of this limitation. He thought he was ready to face Shiva and kill him. Armed with the power he got from Brahma, he went to Mount Kailasha, the abode of Shiva, in the guise of a snake, because snakes were allowed to enter Kailash freely. But when he tried to enter into the presence of Shiva in the guise of Parvati, Shiva recognized him and killed him instantly.\n\nAnother version of the story tells us that Brahma granted him another boon that he can learn warfare under Shiva. Adi started to train under Shiva. However, after a few years he started to trouble the residents of Mount Kailasha. Adi appeared as Parvati in front of Shiva and asked him for one more chance. However Shiva realised this was Adi and killed him with his trishula. Adi begged for forgiveness and Shiva gave him moksha.\n\n"}

Ambrosii ad Nemus, had anything more than a very local significance. This order is known from a bull of Pope Gregory XI addressed to the monks of the church of St Ambrose outside Milan.\n\nSaint Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, certainly did not found religious orders, though he took an interest in the monastic life and watched over its beginnings in his diocese, providing for the needs of a monastery outside the walls of Milan, as Saint Augustine recounts in his \"Confessions\". Ambrose also made successful efforts to improve the moral life of women in the Milan of his time by promoting the permanent institution of Virgins, as also of widows. His exhortations and other interventions have survived in various writings: \"De virginibus\", \"De viduis\", \"De virginitate\", \"De institutione virginis\", \"De exhortatione virginitatis\", and \"De lapsu virginis consecratae\". Ambrose was the only Father of the Church to leave behind so many writings on the subject and his attentions naturally enough led to the formation of communities which later became formal monasteries of women.\n\nIt is against this background that two religious orders or congregations—one of men and one of women, when founded in the Milan area during the 13th and 15th centuries—took Saint Ambrose as their patron and hence adopted his name.\n\nThe first of these groups was formed in a wood outside Milan by three noble Milanese, Alexander Grivelli, Antonio Petrasancta, and Albert Besuzzi, who were joined by others, including some priests. In 1375 Pope Gregory XI gave them the Rule of St Augustine, with set of constitutions. As a canonically recognized order they took the name \"Fratres Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus\" and adopted a habit consisting of a brown tunic, scapular, and hood. The brethren elected a superior with the title of prior who was then instituted by the Archbishop of Milan. The priests of the congregation undertook preaching and other tasks of the ministry but were not allowed to accept charge parishes. In the liturgy they followed the Ambrosian Rite. Various monasteries were founded on these lines, but without any formal bond between them. In 1441 Pope Eugene IV merged them into one congregation called \"Congregatio Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus\", made the original house the main seat, and laid down a system of government whereby a general chapter met every three years, elected the priors who stayed in office till the next chapter. There was a rector, or superior general, who was assisted by two \"visitors\".\n\nSaint Charles Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan, successfully reformed their discipline, grown lax, in 1579. In 1589 Pope Sixtus V united to the Congregation of St Ambrose the monasteries of a group known as the \"Brothers of the Apostles of the Poor Life\" (or \"Apostolini\" or \"Brothers of St. Barnabas\"), whose houses were in the province of Genoa and in the March of Ancona. This was an order that had been founded by Giovanni Scarpa at the end of the 15th century. The union was confirmed by Pope Paul V in 1606, at which time the congregation added the name of St. Barnabas to its title, adopted new constitutions, divided its houses into four provinces, two of them, St Clement's and St Pancras's, being in Rome. Published works have survived from the pen of Ascanio Tasca and Michele Mulozzani, each of whom was superior-general, and of Zaccaria Visconti, Francesco-Maria Guazzi and Paolo Fabulotti. Although various Ambrosians were given the title of Blessed in recognition of their holiness: Antonio Gonzaga of Mantua, Filippo of Fermo, and Gerardo of Monza, the order was eventually dissolved by Pope Innocent X in 1650.\n\nThe Nuns of St Ambrose (Ambrosian Sisters) wore a habit of the same colour as the Brothers of St Ambrose, conformed to their constitutions, and followed the Ambrosian Rite, but were independent in government. Pope Sixtus IV gave the nuns canonical status in 1474. Their one monastery was on the top of Monte Varese, near Lago Maggiore, on the spot where their foundress, the Blessed Catarina Morigia (or Catherine of Palanza), had first led a solitary life. Other early nuns were the Blessed Juliana of Puriselli, Benedetta Bimia, and Lucia Alciata. The nuns were esteemed by St Charles Borromeo.\n\nAnother group of cloistered \"Nuns of St Ambrose\", also called the Annunciatae (Italian: \"Annunziate\") of Lombardy or \"Sisters of St Marcellina\", were founded in 1408 by three young women of Pavia, Dorothea Morosini, Eleonora Contarini, and Veronica Duodi. Their houses, scattered throughout Lombardy and Venetia, were united into a congregation by St Pius V, under the Rule of St Augustine with a mother-house, residence of the prioress general, at Pavia. One of the nuns in this group was Saint Catharine Fieschi Adorno, who died on September 14, 1510.\n\nIn some sense also \"Ambrosians\" are the members of a diocesan religious society founded by St Charles Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan. All priests or destined to become priests, they took a simple vow of obedience to their bishop. The model for this was a society that already existed at Brescia, under the name of \"Priests of Peace\". In August 1578 the new society was inaugurated, being entrusted with the church of the Holy Sepulchre and given the name of \"Oblates of St. Ambrose.\" They later received the approbation of Gregory XIII. St Charles died in 1584. These Oblates were dispersed by Napoleon I in 1810, while another group called the Oblates of Our Lady of Rho escaped this fate. In 1848 they were reorganized and given the name of \"Oblates of St. Charles\" and reassigned the house of the Holy Sepulchre. In the course of the 19th century similar groups were founded in a number of countries, including the \"Oblates of St Charles\", established in London by Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman.\n\n"}

{"id": "241425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=241425", "title": "Avalokiteśvara", "text": "Avalokiteśvara\n\nAvalokiteśvara or Padmapani ( ; ) is a bodhisattva who embodies the compassion of all Buddhas. This bodhisattva is variably depicted, described and portrayed in different cultures as either male or female. In Tibet, he is known as Chenrezik, and in Cambodia as \"អវលោកិតេស្វរៈ\". In Chinese Buddhism, Avalokiteśvara has evolved into the somewhat different female figure Guanyin. In Japan this figure is known as Kanzeon or Kannon.\n\nThe name \"Avalokiteśvara\" combines the verbal prefix \"ava\" \"down\", \"lokita\", a past participle of the verb \"lok\" \"to notice, behold, observe\", here used in an active sense; and finally \"īśvara\", \"lord\", \"ruler\", \"sovereign\" or \"master\". In accordance with sandhi (Sanskrit rules of sound combination), \"a\"+\"īśvara\" becomes \"eśvara\". Combined, the parts mean \"lord who gazes down (at the world)\". The word \"loka\" (\"world\") is absent from the name, but the phrase is implied. It does appear in the Cambodian form of the name, \"Lokesvarak\".\n\nThe earliest translation of the name into Chinese by authors such as Xuanzang was as \"Guānzìzài\" (), not the form used in East Asian Buddhism today, Guanyin (). It was initially thought that this was due to a lack of fluency, as \"Guanzizai\" indicates the original Sanskrit form was \"Avalokitasvara\", \"who looks down upon sound\" (i.e., the cries of sentient beings who need help). It is now understood that was the original form, and is also the origin of \"Guanyin\" \"Perceiving sound, cries\". This translation was favored by the tendency of some Chinese translators, notably Kumārajīva, to use the variant \"Guānshìyīn\" \"who perceives the world's lamentations\"—wherein \"lok\" was read as simultaneously meaning both \"to look\" and \"world\" (Sanskrit \"loka\"; ). The original form \"Avalokitasvara\" appears in Sanskrit fragments of the fifth century.\n\nThis earlier Sanskrit name was supplanted by the form containing the ending \"-īśvara\" \"lord\"; but \"Avalokiteśvara\" does not occur in Sanskrit before the seventh century.\n\nThe original meaning of the name fits the Buddhist understanding of the role of a bodhisattva. The reinterpretation presenting him as an \"īśvara\" shows a strong influence of Hinduism, as the term \"īśvara\" was usually connected to the Hindu notion of Vishnu (in Vaishnavism) or Śiva (in Shaivism) as the Supreme Lord, Creator and Ruler of the world. Some attributes of such a god were transmitted to the bodhisattva, but the mainstream of those who venerated Avalokiteśvara upheld the Buddhist rejection of the doctrine of any creator god.\nIn Sanskrit, Avalokiteśvara is also referred to as \"Padmapāni\" (\"Holder of the Lotus\") or \"Lokeśvara\" (\"Lord of the World\"). In Tibetan, Avalokiteśvara is \"Chenrézik\", () and is said to emanate as the Dalai Lama the Karmapa and other high lamas. An etymology of the Tibetan name Chenrézik is \"spyan\" \"eye\", \"ras\" \"continuity\" and \"gzig\" \"to look\". This gives the meaning of one who always looks upon all beings (with the eye of compassion).\n\nAccording to the \"Kāraṇḍavyūha Sūtra\", the sun and moon are said to be born from Avalokiteśvara's eyes, Shiva from his brow, Brahma from his shoulders, Narayana from his heart, Sarasvati from his teeth, the winds from his mouth, the earth from his feet, and the sky from his stomach. In this text and others, such as the \"Longer Sukhavativyuha Sutra\", Avalokiteśvara is an attendant of Amitabha.\n\nSome texts which mention Avalokiteśvara include:\nThe \"Lotus Sutra\" is generally accepted to be the earliest literature teaching about the doctrines of Avalokiteśvara. These are found in the \"Lotus Sutra\" chapter 25 (). This chapter is devoted to Avalokiteśvara, describing him as a compassionate bodhisattva who hears the cries of sentient beings, and who works tirelessly to help those who call upon his name. A total of 33 different manifestations of Avalokiteśvara are described, including female manifestations, all to suit the minds of various beings. The chapter consists of both a prose and a verse section. This earliest source often circulates separately as its own sutra, called the \"Avalokiteśvara Sūtra\" (), and is commonly recited or chanted at Buddhist temples in East Asia.\nWhen the Chinese monk Faxian traveled to Mathura in India around 400 CE, he wrote about monks presenting offerings to Avalokiteśvara. When Xuanzang traveled to India in the 7th century, he provided eyewitness accounts of Avalokiteśvara statues being venerated by devotees from all walks of life: kings, to monks, to laypeople. \n\nIn Chinese Buddhism and East Asia, Tangmi practices for the 18-armed form of Avalokiteśvara called Cundī are very popular. These practices have their basis in the early Indian Vajrayana: her origins lie with a yakshini cult in Bengal and Orissa, and her name in Sanskrit \"connotes a prostitute or other woman of low caste but specifically denotes a prominent local ogress ... whose divinised form becomes the subject of an important Buddhist cult starting in the eighth century\". The popularity of Cundī is attested by the three extant translations of the \"Cundī Dhāraṇī Sūtra\" from Sanskrit to Chinese, made from the end of the seventh century to the beginning of the eighth century. In late imperial China, these early esoteric traditions still thrived in Buddhist communities. Robert Gimello has also observed that in these communities, the esoteric practices of Cundī were extremely popular among both the populace and the elite.\n\nIn the Tiantai school, six forms of Avalokiteśvara are defined. Each of the bodhisattva's six qualities are said to break the hindrances respectively of the six realms of existence: hell-beings, pretas, animals, humans, asuras, and devas.\n\nVeneration of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva has continued to the present day in Sri Lanka:\n\nIn times past both \"Tantrayana\" and \"Mahayana\" have been found in some of the \"Theravada\" countries, but today the Buddhism of Ceylon, Burma, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia is almost exclusively \"Theravada\", based on the Pali Canon. The only \"Mahayana\" deity that has entered the worship of ordinary Buddhists in \"Theravada\" countries is \"Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara\". In Ceylon he is known as \"Natha-deva\" and mistaken by the majority for the Buddha yet to come, \"Bodhisattva Maitreya\". The figure of \"Avalokitesvara\" usually is found in the shrine room near the Buddha image. In more recent times, some western-educated Theravādins have attempted to identify Nātha with Maitreya Bodhisattva; however, traditions and basic iconography (including an image of Amitābha Buddha on the front of the crown) identify Nātha as Avalokiteśvara. Andrew Skilton writes:\nAvalokiteśvara is popularly worshiped in Myanmar, where he is called \"Lokanat\" or lokabyuharnat, and Thailand, where he is called \"Lokesvara\". The bodhisattva goes by many other names. In Indochina and Thailand, he is \"Lokesvara\", \"The Lord of the World.\" In Tibet he is \"Chenrezig\", also spelled Spyan-ras gzigs, \"With a Pitying Look.\" In China, the bodhisattva takes a female form and is called \"Guanyin\" (also spelled Quanyin, Kwan Yin, Kuanyin or Kwun Yum), \"Hearing the Sounds of the World.\" In Japan, Guanyin is \"Kannon\" or Kanzeon; in Korea, \"Gwan-eum\"; in Vietnam, \"Quan Am\".\n\nAvalokiteśvara is worshipped as Nātha in Sri Lanka. Tamil Buddhist tradition developed in Chola literature, such as in Buddamitra's \"Virasoliyam \", states that the Vedic sage Agastya learnt Tamil from Avalokiteśvara. The earlier Chinese traveler Xuanzang recorded a temple dedicated to Avalokitesvara in the South Indian Mount Potalaka, a Sanskritzation of Pothigai, where Tamil Hindu tradition places Agastya having learnt the Tamil language from Shiva. Avalokitesvara worship gained popularity with the growth of the Abhayagiri vihāra's Tamraparniyan Mahayana sect.\nWestern scholars have not reached a consensus on the origin of the reverence for Avalokiteśvara. Some have suggested that Avalokiteśvara, along with many other supernatural beings in Buddhism, was a borrowing or absorption by Mahayana Buddhism of one or more deities from Hinduism, in particular Shiva or Vishnu. This seems to be based on the name Avalokiteśvara.\n\nOn the basis of study of Buddhist scriptures, ancient Tamil literary sources, as well as field survey, the Japanese scholar Shu Hikosaka proposes the hypothesis that, the ancient mount Potalaka, the residence of Avalokiteśvara described in the \"Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra\" and Xuanzang’s \"Great Tang Records on the Western Regions\", is the real mountain Pothigai in Ambasamudram, Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu. Shu also says that mount Potalaka has been a sacred place for the people of South India from time immemorial. It is the traditional residence of Siddhar Agastya, at Agastya Mala. With the spread of Buddhism in the region beginning at the time of the great king Aśoka in the third century BCE, it became a holy place also for Buddhists, who gradually became dominant as a number of their hermits settled there. The local people, though, mainly remained followers of the Hindu religion. The mixed Hindu-Buddhist cult culminated in the formation of the figure of Avalokiteśvara.\n\nThe name Lokeśvara should not be confused with that of Lokeśvararāja, the Buddha under whom Dharmakara became a monk and made forty-eight vows before becoming Amitābha.\n\nMahāyāna Buddhism relates Avalokiteśvara to the six-syllable mantra .\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhism, due to his association with this mantra, one form of Avalokiteśvara is called \"Ṣaḍākṣarī\" \"Lord of the Six Syllables\" in Sanskrit. Recitation of this mantra while using prayer beads is the most popular religious practice in Tibetan Buddhism. The connection between this famous mantra and Avalokiteśvara is documented for the first time in the '. This text is dated to around the late 4th century CE to the early 5th century CE. In this sūtra, a bodhisattva is told by the Buddha that recitation of this mantra while focusing on the sound can lead to the attainment of eight hundred samādhis. The ' also features the first appearance of the dhāraṇī of Cundī, which occurs at the end of the sūtra text. After the bodhisattva finally attains samādhi with the mantra \"oṃ maṇipadme hūṃ\", he is able to observe 77 koṭīs of fully enlightened buddhas replying to him in one voice with the Cundī Dhāraṇī: \n\nIn Shingon Buddhism, the mantra for Avalokiteśvara is \n\nThe Nīlakaṇṭha Dhāraṇī is an 82-syllable dhāraṇī for Avalokiteśvara.\n\nOne prominent Buddhist story tells of Avalokiteśvara vowing never to rest until he had freed all sentient beings from saṃsāra. Despite strenuous effort, he realizes that many unhappy beings were yet to be saved. After struggling to comprehend the needs of so many, his head splits into eleven pieces. Amitābha, seeing his plight, gives him eleven heads with which to hear the cries of the suffering. Upon hearing these cries and comprehending them, Avalokiteśvara tries to reach out to all those who needed aid, but found that his two arms shattered into pieces. Once more, Amitābha comes to his aid and invests him with a thousand arms with which to aid the suffering multitudes.\n\nThe Bao'en Temple located in northwestern Sichuan has an outstanding wooden image of the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteśvara, an example of Ming dynasty decorative sculpture.\n\nAvalokiteśvara is an important deity in Tibetan Buddhism. He is regarded in the Vajrayana teachings as a Buddha.\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhism, Tãrã came into existence from a single tear shed by Avalokiteśvara. When the tear fell to the ground it created a lake, and a lotus opening in the lake revealed Tara. In another version of this story, Tara emerges from the heart of Avalokiteśvara. In either version, it is Avalokiteśvara's outpouring of compassion which manifests Tãrã as a being.\n\nAvalokiteśvara has an extraordinarily large number of manifestations in different forms (including wisdom goddesses (vidyaas) directly associated with him in images and texts). Some of the more commonly mentioned forms include:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1008505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1008505", "title": "Catlinite", "text": "Catlinite\n\nCatlinite (also called pipestone) is a type of argillite (metamorphosed mudstone), usually brownish-red in color, which occurs in a matrix of Sioux Quartzite. Because it is fine-grained and easily worked, it is prized by Native Americans, primarily those of the Plains nations for use in making ceremonial pipes such as chanunpas. Pipestone quarries are located and preserved in Pipestone National Monument outside Pipestone, Minnesota, in Pipestone County, Minnesota, and at the Pipestone River in Ontario, Canada.\n\nThe term \"Catlinite\" came into use after the American painter George Catlin visited the quarries in Minnesota in 1835; but it was Philander Prescott who first wrote about the rock in 1832, noting that evidence indicated that American Indians had been using the quarries since at least as far back as 1637.\n\nMinnesota catlinite is buttery smooth and can be cut with a regular hacksaw or even a knife, it comes out of the ground a pinkish color often with a cream layer protecting it from the hard quartzite. It is weaker and more subject to breaking under stress than Utah pipestone. Most catlinite deposits exist beneath the level of groundwater or are in deep enough layers where the soil is constantly moist as the iron compounds which give catlinite its red color quickly convert into iron oxides when exposed to the elements and the stone degrades and breaks down.\n\nThe red catlinite from the Pipestone, Minnesota quarries is a soft claystone bed which occurs between layers of hard Sioux Quartzite. Only hand tools are used to reach the catlinite so it takes a long time to get to it. Only enrolled Native Americans are allowed to quarry for the stone at the Pipestone National Monument, and thus it is protected from over-mining. Another quarry is located near Hayward, Wisconsin on the reservation, which the Ojibwa have used for centuries. The stone there is harder than the stone from Pipestone National Monument.\nUtah pipestone has a more variable range of hard and soft forms, since it occurs as layers between deposits of harder slates. Utah pipestone is a by-product of slate mining in Delta, Utah, and several natural deposits have been mined and used for pipemaking by Native Americans in the area for millennia.\n\nThe Canadian quarry is no longer used, although there are quarries in Canada where another type of pipestone, black stone, is gleaned. The Ojibwe use both the red and black stone for their sacred pipes.\n\nCatlinite is often used to make the hollow tubes in pipeclay triangles.\n\nA large range of pipestones exist, not just those in Minnesota, and numerous Native American tribes use a variety of materials in addition to catlinite for pipemaking.\n\nSmoking pipes molded from wet clay are different from those where the bowl is carved from solid pipestone and then fitted with a wooden stem (as is the case with Catlinite pipes).\n\nThe Eastern Band Cherokee are social smokers, and use molded clay pipes for this purpose.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, since the 17th century \"pipe-clay\" has meant a pale, whitish clay. The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as \"fine white kind of clay, which forms a ductile paste with water\". It is traditionally used for all sorts of polishing and whitening purposes as well as for making tobacco pipes and pottery.\n\n\n"}

The Maranaos of Lanao were acquainted with the sultanate system when Islam was introduced to the area by Muslim missionaries and traders from the Middle East, Indian and Malay regions who propagated Islam to Sulu and Maguindanao.\n\nUnlike in Sulu and Maguindanao, the Sultanate system in Lanao was uniquely decentralized. The area was divided into Four Sovereign States of Lanao or the \"Pat a Phangampong a Ranao\" which are composed of a number of royal houses (Sapolo ago nem a Panoroganan or The Sixteen (16) Royal Houses) with specific territorial jurisdictions within mainland Mindanao. This decentralized structure of royal power in Lanao was adopted by the founders, and maintained up to the present day, in recognition of the shared power and prestige of the ruling clans in the area, emphasizing the values of unity of the nation (\"Kaiisaisa o Bangsa\"), patronage (\"kaseselai\") and fraternity (\"kaphapagaria\").\n\nThey had maintained and had successfully defended their Sultanate from all Spanish attempts. After the last attempt, the Spanish never again ventured in all their duration in the Archipelago for 333 years.\n\nThe four sovereign states of Lanao are:\n\nThe alleged unethical integration by the republican form of government under the Philippine Commonwealth without consent by the 1st Presidency of then Manuel Quezon, the 1st Philippine Constitution since 1934 has prohibited the granting of titles of nobility to Filipino citizens. Legally, the state does not recognise the Sultanate system.\n\nThe Sultanate system in Lanao has survived colonialism and non-recognition by state authorities. Like the sultanates in present-day Sultanate of Brunei, Republic of Indonesia, Federal Government of Malaysia and the Muslim region in the Kingdom of Thailand, sultanates in Mindanao have continued to exist despite its non-recognition.\n\nIn Lanao region (composed of Lanao del Sur and Lanao del Norte), the Sultanate system has remained important as an integral part of the Maranao society, symbolizing royal authority, cultural heritage and Islamic influence. At present, Maranaos trace their lineage, legitimacy and authority through their \"Salsila\" that has chronicled the origins of the Lanao royal houses.\n\nDespite having no legal recognition of the Sultanate system, the Royal Houses of Lanao are now protected ethnic and traditional houses when the Philippine government legislated the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act of 1997 which recognizes and promotes all the rights of Indigenous Cultural Communities and Indigenous Peoples of the Philippines.\n\nShariff Bangkaya begot two children from his 3rd wife Bae sa Matampay namely, Dakeneq of Malabang and Shariff Laut Buisan. Shariff Laut Buisan was installed as 6th Sultan of Maguindanao in 1597, and was married to the sister of Sultan Batara Shah Tengah of Sulu. Shariff Laut Buisan begot Gayang and Muhammad Dipatuan Kudarat. Gayang was married to the grandson of Dimasangcay Adel – Shariff Matonding, whose children reigned as the Sultans and Bai a Labi of Lanao, while his brother Shariff Muhammad Kudarat was installed as 7th Sultan of Maguindanao in 1619. In 1656, Sultan Kudarat declared a jihad against the Spanish colonialist. His Sultanate was felt as far as Ternate in Indonesia and Borneo, and in fact, its power reached the shores of Bohol, Cebu, Panay, Mindoro and Manila in north.\n\nIn 1637, Sebastean Hurtado-de Curcuera decided to send an expedition to subdue the Datus and the people of Lake Lanao. As early as September 1637, he had promised the lake area to the Jesuits, who would get the same the moment it was conquered.\n\nThe conquest of the Maranaos was entrusted to Captain Francesco Atienza, the Alcalde Mayor of Caraga. With fifty Spaniards and five hundred Caragans, the captain landed in Bayug, then proceeded to the Maranao territory, reaching the lake on 4, April 1639. There were about 2,000 families or 800 inhabitants. The Spaniards brought with them six collapsible boats that they fitted out in the lake.\n\nThe Datus of Lanao initially stalled the Spaniards. They promised tribute and to accepted the missionaries. The allies of the Spaniards observed the movement of inhabitants into the interior. The Maranaos could easily muster 6,000 warriors from among the four confederation of Lanao. Lack of firearms though was their disadvantage although they have their traditional weapons. Governor Almonte dispatched Major Pedro Fernandez del Rio with 70 Spaniards and 500 Visayans to join with the forces of Atienza. \n\nThe expedition had to pass through the area of Dalawn, Gandamatu and Nanagen where Shariff Matonding, who was married to Gayang, a sister of Sultan Kudarat, they engaged and harassed the reinforments of the colonizers. After a most difficult passage made by the fierce resistance of Shariff Matonding, Major Pedro del Rio finally made it to the shores of the lake where he join the forces of Atienza. In the middle of April, Capt Atienza and part of his troops left for Bayug and fortified it with a stockade and sailed for Caraga.\n\nIn October of the same year, an additional force of 50 Spaniards and 500 Boholanos arrived under the command of Captain Pedro Bermudez de Castro who had orders to build a fort in Marawi to start imposing Spanish sovereignty.\n\nSultan Kudarat visited his sons-in-law in Lanao, Balindong Bsar and Dianaton Naim of Butig. He gathered all the Datus of Lanao and delivered the now legendary speech in this form:\n\nThe Maranaos, inspired by the Sultan's speech took up arms against the newly built fort. They used indigenous means to get at the fort and set it on fire. Three of the Spanish boats, brought from Bayug were captured. Atienza formed a relief expedition and saved the Spaniards. The Maranao warriors after 29 days of siege left their position. Afraid to experience once more the starvation and horrors of siege warfare, the Spaniards proceeded to burn their own fort and made a retreat back to Iligan.\n\nIn 1640, Capt Atienza tried once more to conquer the Maranaos. For the second time, the Spaniards burned the fields and retired to the coast, but not without losing some men on the way due to ambushes. \n\nThe second attempt to colonize and make Catholics of the Maranaos had utterly failed. In payment for their freedom, making true Sultan Kudarat's wisdom, the Maranaos lost that years harvest but remained unmolested until the coming of the American Capt John Pershing and his troops.\n\nIn Lanao, the Maranaos started to be acquainted with the sultanate system in the 15th century before Spanish Colonial Era through the influence of Shariff Kabungsuan, who was enthroned as first Sultan of Maguindanao in 1520, In 1640 Balindong Bsar of the house of Masiu became the first Maranao Chieftain enthroned as Sultan, with specific title as Sultan Diagaborolah. He was charged to enforce the teaching of Islam and the law and order in Lanao. On the same year Sultan Diagaborolah consulted the seven Maranao Datus on how to govern Lanao. \n\nThey were Dianaton Naim of Butig, Sultan Mardan of Macadar. Datu Burus of Pagayawan, Datu Ottowa of Ditsaan, Datu Acari of Ramain, Onbaor of Bansaya, Engki-Okoda of Minitepad, Alanake of Baloi. The eight wise men (including Balindong Bsar) agreed to create the four sovereign states of Lanao (\"Pat a Phangampong a Ranao\") composed of the States of Unayan, Masiu, Bayabao and Baloi, and the 16th Royal houses (\"Panoroganan or Royal Houses\") and on a lower level, the 28 members of the legislative body (\"Pyakambaya ko Taritib\"), and the area sultans. \n\nThe socio-political system was based on the Taritib, Ijma, laws, customary laws, and adapted practices of the Maranaos. The Phangampong system was further divided into smaller socio-political units. \n\nThe Taritib, an ancient order or law bound together the four states or principalities of Lanao into an alliance or confederation and defined their relationships. There is no central, all powerful authority but every state or principality respected the traditional alliance termed Kangiginawai.\n\nOne problem that beset the sultanate of the four confederation of Lanao was the identification of ancestral land area (\"Kawali\") of each state (\"Phangampong\"). They were consequently defined by Datu Pascan of Unayan, Datu Popawan of Bayabao, Amiyanon Simban of Masiu and Datu Dilion of Baloi. The agreement known as \"Kiatathamana-an\" delineated the areas as: Dalama, located in the municipality of Molondo, the boundary between Bayabao and East Masiu; Sawer, Masiu municipality the boundary between East Masiu municipality and East Unayan to Madamba municipality, the boundary between West Unayan and West Masiu; and Bacayawan in Marantao municipality, the boundary between west Masiu and Bayabao. Surprisingly, there is no identified boundary between Bayabao and Baloi but the reason is that both \"Pangampong\" lineage come from the same family tree. \"Under the Kiangginawai\" (friendship) their boundary need not be established.\n\nIn 1754, the Maranaos kept on increasing their maritime strength and accelerated their attacks on the Spaniards. Leyte and Calamianes bore part of the brunt of their attacks. About nine hundred Maranaos and Iranuns once landed to raid for slaves in Albay and captured more than a hundred inhabitants. In Balayan, Batangas, they looted everything they could lay their hands on. The Maranaos and Iranuns were thus responsible to discouraged the Pintados of the Visayas to come with the Spaniards into their forays in Mindanao and Sulu. \n\nThe Maranaos and other Moros made these attacks since most of the native troops used against them were Visayans. The events prompted the Spaniards to devise a more elaborate and effective naval system of defense as the Visayans blames the Spanish Government to be unable to defend them even after giving yearly tribute to the Crown.\n\nIn 1757, the Iranuns and Maranaos accelerated their attacks on the Spaniards. There were frequent naval encounters between them and the Spaniards. In some of them, according to reports, thousands have perished.\n\nIn a span of four years, the Maranao raids for slaves on Visayas reduced the number of tributes to the Spanish government by at least 100,000. For example, figures showed that the district of Panay, it paid 1,500 tributes in 1750. By the year 1757 there only 500 tributes paid. In Romblon, the number of tributes went down from 1370 to 995, while in Kalibu (Capiz) it decreased from 1,164 to 549. Many coastal towns were totally destroyed and the Visayan population was reduced considerably.\n\nIn 1759, Datu Aber Palawan and his men attacked the Spanish squadron in the northern part of Mindanao. He was martyred and buried in Radapan, Lanao (now Tarapan, Linamon, Lanao del Norte).\n\nGeneral Valeriano Weyler, the Spanish Governor General, decided to deal with the Maranaos in 1889. He ordered his troops to land in Malabang (in Lanao) to conquer the unconquered Maranaos. He had 1,242 soldiers in two columns. The first column started from Malabang while the second column started from Iligan. (This two-pronged attack on Maranao territory from the northern and western parts of Mindanao was a reminiscent of the 1639 campaign against the Maranaos). After a few bloody clashes, Marawi was occupied on August 19, 1889, but not without encountering strong resistance from the Maranaos led by Datu Amai Pakpak. In September 1891, Weyler finally terminated his campaign without actually conquering the Maranaos. \n\nOn May 15, 1892, Friar Pablo Pastel drafted the blue print for the temporal and spiritual conquest of the Sultanates in Philippines for the gradual reduction of the political and other powers of the Sultans, Datus, Shariffs and Panditas in such a way that they would all eventually become powerless. The Spaniards considered all the Moro communities as the primary obstacle in their conquest and colonisation of the whole Archipelago. \n\nOn June 5, 1892, the Datus of Lanao cooperated in the fortification of the section around Agus River for their mutual defense. In February 1895, systematic Maranao attacks on the Spanish forts began. As a result, the Spanish invaders launched another Spanish expedition on March 10 of the same year to attack and capture Marawi, once and for all. The march to Marawi commenced. The Spaniards found themselves faced by strong cotta under the command of the same Amai Pakpak. The Maranao warriors fought with equal bravery but lost the war with the martyrdom of Datu Akader Amai Papak, his son, 23 datus and 150 Maranao warriors. The Spaniards lost 194 men. About 3,000 Spanish troops, and countless volunteer from Zamboanga, Misamis and Sibugay were involved. This did not stop the Maranaos to continue fighting. \n\nThe Spanish Kotah in Marawi was in a state of siege. Sporadic attacks on the garrison and ambushes became the order of the day. The Maranaos around the lake continued their resistance against the Spaniards even after gunboats were brought to Lake Lanao to launch a campaign against the communities around it. Maranao efforts to wrest the area from the Spanish however proved fruitless as the Spanish held on to their conquered territory until they eventually withdrew, but only after their defeat to the Americans in the Spanish–American War which commenced on May 1, 1898.\n\nIn 1899, the Sultans themselves led their people in fighting both the Spaniards and later, the Americans. They all ended as martyrs along with their families and warriors. In 1889, the Americans landed in Malabang (Lanao) and occupied the Spanish camp without much fanfare and named it Camp Concuera. Two years later, the Americans proceeded to the lake area but were met by Maranao warriors in Upper Bayang: Amai Barang, Mamarinta, Pitiilan, Sultan of Bayang and 300 warriors clashed with the Americans in a fierce battle. The Sultan and his men were crushed. The Sultan of Bayang perished but Captain Vicar also died. (The American camp in Upper Bayang was named after him --- Camp Vicar, Lanao). In Tugaya (Lanao), Datu Saruang and many others also died fighting against the American forces coming to their place.\nDuring the Commonwealth regime, Amai Manabilang of Marawi challenged the authority of Justice Cayetano Arellano, of the Philippine Supreme Court, in enforcing the government laws to the Maranaos. He led a campaign that Mindanao should be separated from the Philippines. The policy of attraction of the Americans in Lanao under General Pershing offered empty promises to the Maranaos who felt that the government deprived them with the continued exercise of their traditional and cultural practices and interference to their religion, customs and traditions.\n\nOn March 18, 1935, one hundred twenty Datus of Lanao, with thirty Sultans signed a strongly worded letter, popularly known as \"Dansalan Declaration\" to U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt and the United States Congress asking them that the Filipinos should be granted independence and the Moro Province should also be given their own independence or better left under American rule until such time that they were prepared to grant their independence to be known as Bangsamoro Republik.\n\nThe entire Sultanates in Mindanao, Philippines at present have legally been unrecognized and practically reduced to non-entities by a provision in the Philippines Constitution prohibiting the granting of a title of nobility to a Filipino citizen. It was the responsibility of the sultans not only to defend their people and communities but also their religion. Among the Muslims in Mindanao, there is no way one can separate the sultanate from their culture and tradition.\n\nThe Royal Sultanate could play a very important role especially because by accepted tradition, constituents respect and value Sultanate authority. For example, in the Preservation of Social Order.\n\nThe original number of the ruling Royal Sultans of Lanao was only fifteen (15). It is now increased to seventeen (17) with the creation of Sultan a Domalondong sa Butig Hence, it was recently renamed as the 17 \"Panoroganans of Lanao\". A \"Pangampong\" is a principality where the head is addressed as His Royal Highness (HRH).\n\nThe Panoroganans are the ones entitled to approve or disapprove the Taritib, Ijmas and Adats in their respective Pangampong. This gave them the title as \"His Royal Highness\" or now localized as \"Panoroganans\". They also created the 28 \"Piakambaya ko Taritib\" (ruled by a Sultan but not Royal Sultan) that is seemingly similar to a legislative council or body that formulates the Taritib and Ijma which are distributed by pangampong.\n\nThe places under each of the \"Pat a Pangmpong a Ranao\" (Four Principalities of Lanao) are:\n\n\"UNAYAN\":.\n\n\"MASIU\":\n\n\"POONA-BAYABAO\":\n\n\"LUMBA-BAYABAO\":\n\n\"MALA-BAYABAO\":\n\n\"BALOI\":\n\n\"Short history about\" Kalangit of Unayan and Bataraan di kilaten of Maciu formerly Zainun, the first founding ancestor of Masiu Pangampong, his later descendant were Pondag and Amaloya Thopaan.

{"id": "25429238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25429238", "title": "Deathbed confession", "text": "Deathbed confession\n\nA deathbed confession is an admittance or confession when someone is nearing death, or on their \"death bed\". This confession may help alleviate any guilt, regrets, secrets, or sins the dying person may have had in their life. These confessions can occur because the dying want to live the last moments of their life free of any secrets they have been holding in for a portion, or the entirety of their life. A deathbed confession can be given to anyone, but a family member is usually with their loved one during this time. Doctors and nurses may also hear a deathbed confession because they are often present in a person’s last moments.\n\nThese confessions can range from a confession of sins that have been committed to crimes that have been committed or witnessed. Often, these confessions are made to clear the dying’s conscience. A common type of confession is either religious or spiritually based. On the death bed, the dying will confess sins or mistakes they have made in their lifetime, and ask for forgiveness, so that they may move on to the afterlife according to their religion. Different religions have different protocols for the deathbed confession, but all religions seek to provide relief for the dying. People may also confess their feelings for another person while dying. This can relieve the dying of the internal struggle with hiding how they actually feel for someone. These emotions can range from hatred to love, and everything in between.\n\nMany confessions have involved the admittance of a crime that the dying has committed, which obviously cannot be prosecuted once the perpetrator has died. On the other hand, someone can confess that they have knowledge of or witnessed a crime that has been committed. This special kind of confession can sometimes be admissible in court to get a conviction, depending on the circumstances of the statement. Another use for a deathbed confession in the criminal justice system is to re-open a case that may have gone cold to get closure for the victim's family or friends, even if prosecution is not an option.\n\nMany terminal patients look to religion or spirituality to bring comfort in their remaining time. Buddhism has been showing up in palliative care more frequently to help patients cope with death and come to peace with the end of their life. Buddhism is a philosophically based religion mainly focused on suffering: why it exists, what causes it, and how to escape it. The belief is that ignorance, anger, and attachment cause inevitable suffering to the body. Buddhism also believes that life and the body is temporary and it is a privilege used to look for enlightenment. Discussing any issues in a patient's life related to suffering can bring inner peace and relief. Buddhism does not seek to manipulate a dying patient into following a religion or forcing dying confessions, but rather to become a thought-provoking way to talk about their suffering and clear themselves of attachment to their body, to prepare for death. Talking about suffering may bring up confessions or secrets that can be released before death to journey towards enlightenment.\n\nMany Christians, most notably Catholics, believe that sins must be confessed to a priest before death. The priest can then absolve the dying of their sins, so that they can be properly prepared for the afterlife. The admittance of sin is important to the dying individual, because this frees them from sin, purifying the soul for a happy afterlife with God in Heaven. These final confessions, sometimes along with the Last Rites, are often performed by a hospital priest or chaplain when a patient's quality of life suddenly declines.\n\nHinduism is largely centered around the idea of karma and reincarnation. Good karma allows the soul to move up on the incarnation hierarchy to a better life. Bad karma does the opposite; it causes the soul to have to pay for its actions in this life or the previous one. The next incarnation is less fortunate until the bad karma is cancelled out by good deeds or suffering. This heavy emphasis on karma leads many Hindus to carry out many final acts to improve their chances in the next life and reduce end of life suffering. The main ways Hindus try to increase their karma before moving onto the next life is by apologizing to people, resolving any issues with family or friends, confessions with a guru or other religious figure, religious ceremonies, sacrifices or repentance. Performing all, or some, of these actions allows the patient to think about God, while they pass and prepare for the next life.\n\nThe Talmud teaches that \"if one falls sick and his life is in danger, he is told: 'Make confession, for all who are sentenced to death make confession.'\" Masechet Semachot adds, \"When someone is approaching death, we tell him to confess before he dies, adding that on the one hand, many people confessed and did not die, whilst on the other, there are many who did not confess and died, and there are many who walk in the street and confess; because on the merit of confession you will live.\"\n\nMany tribes of Native Americans have similar views regarding death. Death is seen as a natural transition, and a part of life. The world is seen as an interconnected web, and a person is an extension of the web, as well as all other life. After death, it is believed by many that the components of your person is returned to the web of life. Making this transition smoothly is important to both the dying, and the loved ones left behind after they have passed on. Ensuring that there are no secrets remaining is vital to a transition back to the web of life.\n\nA deathbed confession can be admissible evidence in court under the right circumstances. If someone confesses knowledge of a crime and then dies or their condition worsens, the law does not consider the statement to be hearsay and can be used in a criminal trial. A deathbed confession can be a valuable piece of evidence in a case that may not have much physical evidence. Even criminal confessions that have been secret for years can still be of use, such as in a murder case, because there is no statute of limitations on murder cases.\n\nDeathbed confessions can be used to re-open cold cases to benefit the victim's family. \n\nBridget Sullivan, who had been employed as a housekeeper by the family of Lizzie Borden, died in Butte, Montana in 1948, where she allegedly gave a deathbed confession to her sister, stating that she had changed her testimony on the stand in order to protect Lizzie from being convicted of the murders of her father and step-mother.\n\nMany decades after the 1926 disappearance of a 16-year-old girl named Emma Alice Smith in Sussex, in 2009, a man named David Wright claimed his deceased great-aunt Lillian Smith, a sister of Emma Alice Smith, had told her niece that in the 1950s she had taken a death bed confession from a man claiming that he had murdered Emma Alice on her way to the train station in Horam. The case was reopened, not to find a killer, but to find the body of the young girl to give her a proper burial and give her relatives some closure. In 2011, Sussex Police concluded that despite the alleged death-bed confession, Emma Alice Smith had not been murdered but had in fact eloped with a married man named Thomas Wills. Police concluded the pair had probably ended up in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n"}
{"id": "29456257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29456257", "title": "Debaptism", "text": "Debaptism\n\nMost Christian churches see baptism as a once-in-a-lifetime event that can be neither repeated nor undone. They hold that those who have been baptized remain baptized, even if they renounce the Christian faith by adopting a non-Christian religion or by rejecting religion entirely. But some other organizations and individuals are practicing debaptism.\n\nIn addition to \"de facto\" renunciation through apostasy, or heresy, the Roman Catholic Church envisaged from 1983 to 2009 the possibility of formal defection from the Church through a decision manifested personally, consciously and freely, and in writing, to the competent church authority, who was then to judge whether it was genuinely a case of \"true separation from the constitutive elements of the life of the Church ... (by) an act of apostasy, heresy or schism.\" A formal defection of this kind was then noted in the register of the person's baptism, an annotation that, like those of marriage or ordination, was independent of the fact of the baptism and was not an actual \"debaptism\", even if the person who formally defected from the Catholic Church had also defected from the Christian religion. The fact of having been baptized remains a fact and the Catholic Church holds that baptism marks a person with a lasting seal or character that \"is an ontological and permanent bond which is not lost by reason of any act or fact of defection.\" Nonetheless, formal requests for debaptisms are made; in France, a man sued the French Catholic church for \"its refusal to let him nullify his baptism.\" He had been \"un-baptized\" in 2000, and ten years later he demanded to have his name stricken from the baptismal records, a request granted by a judge in Normandy, a decision appealed by the church.\n\nSome atheist organizations, such as the Italian Union of Rationalist Atheists and Agnostics and the British National Secular Society, offer certificates of \"debaptism\". Not even those who provide the certificates consider them as having legal or canonical effect. The Church of England refuses to take any action on presentation of the certificate. The Roman Catholic Church likewise treats it as any other act of renunciation of the Catholic faith, although for a few years, from 2006 to 2009, it did note in the baptismal register any formal act of defection from the Catholic Church, a concept quite distinct from that of presentation of such a certificate.\n\nIn the years 2010 to 2016, 12,442 people \"debaptised\" in the Dutch-speaking Flemish region of Belgium by formally leaving the Catholic Church.\n\nUsing a hair dryer, some atheist groups have conducted tongue-in-cheek \"debaptism\" ceremonies, not intended to be taken seriously.\n"}

{"id": "26563776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26563776", "title": "Domvs Romana", "text": "Domvs Romana\n\nThe Domvs Romana is a ruined Roman-era house located on the boundary between Mdina and Rabat, Malta. It was built in the 1st century BC as an aristocratic town house (\"domus\") within the Roman city of Melite. In the 11th century, a Muslim cemetery was established on the remains of the domus. The site was discovered in 1881, and archaeological excavations revealed several well preserved Roman mosaics, statues and other artifacts, as well as a number of tombstones and other remains from the cemetery. Since 1882, the site has been open to the public as a museum, which is currently run by Heritage Malta\n\nThe \"Domvs Romana\" is believed to have been built in the beginning of the 1st century BC, and it remained in use until the 2nd century AD. The house had a colonnaded peristyle inspired by ancient Greek architecture, and its best features are the well-made polychrome Hellenistic style mosaics found in the peristyle and the surrounding rooms, which show decorative motifs or mythological scenes. Two types of tesserae were employed: opus vermiculatum, in the centre of the pavement; opus tessellatum, larger tesserae to create three-dimensional designs all around the main image. The picture sought to imitate a highly popular motif which may be first painted by an artist from Sophos. The \"domus\" also shows fine painted wall plaster imitating coloured marbles and showing partly stylized architectural elements which would place them somewhere between the 1st and 2nd Pompeian Styles.\n\nAlthough the house was mostly destroyed over time, its mosaics have survived largely intact, and they are comparable with those found at Pompeii or Sicily. A number of 1st century AD statues of the imperial Roman family, along with coins, glassware, tableware, bath accessories, amphorae and other fine artifacts have also been found in the domus.\n\nIn the 11th century, while Malta was part of the Fatimid Caliphate, the site of the domus was converted into a cemetery. At least 245 burials were discovered during the excavations, which also unearthed a number of limestone (and one marble) tombstones with Naskh or Kufic inscriptions. Some ceramics and a silver ring were also found during the excavations.\n\nThe \"Domvs Romana\" was discovered accidentally in 1881 by workers during a landscaping project. It was subsequently excavated by the leading archaeologists of the time, including Antonio Annetto Caruana, Sir Themistocles Zammit, Robert V. Galea, Harris Dunscombe Colt and Louis Upton Way.\n\nAfter the domus was first excavated, a museum was built on the site of the peristyle of the house in order to preserve its mosaics. The museum opened in February 1882, and it was the first building in Malta that was constructed specifically to house a museum of a particular archaeological site. The museum was originally known as the Museum of Roman Antiquities, and apart from the mosaics and other Roman or Muslim artifacts uncovered from the domus, it also exhibited some other Roman marble pieces which were found in the streets of Mdina. Eventually, many Roman artifacts found elsewhere in Malta were transferred to this museum.\n\nIn 1922, the museum was enlarged to designs by the architect Galizia, and a neoclassical façade and a large display room were added. The remains of the domus were included on the Antiquities List of 1925. The museum closed during World War II, and it housed a restoration centre before reopening to the public in 1945.\n\nThe mosaic of the peristyle was restored in the second half of the 20th century, but was unintentionally damaged in the process. Currently, Heritage Malta is carrying out a report on how to conserve the mosaic and repair it with as little damage as possible. The displays of the museum were renovated between 2002 and 2005, and again in 2011.\n\n"}

Since 1987, it has been operated as a Civil War museum that is open to the public.\n\nWith the outbreak of the American Civil War in April 1861, there were concerns on the Union side about the loyalty and security of the Los Angeles area. Many of the area's residents were recent arrivals from the Southern states, and southerner John C. Breckinridge received twice as many local votes as Abraham Lincoln in the 1860 Presidential election. A company of secessionists was also holding public drills in El Monte, California, displaying California's Bear flag instead of the Stars and Stripes.\n\nPhineas Banning, the founder of Wilmington (then known as New San Pedro), wrote a letter to President Lincoln advising that the Union would lose California unless some provision was made to quell pro-Confederacy sentiment. Initially, the Union moved a garrison from Fort Tejon to Camp Latham near Culver City, California. Later in 1861, Banning and Benjamin Davis Wilson, the first mayor of Los Angeles, donated in Wilmington to the government for one dollar each for use in construction of a Union garrison. By January 1862, the military command had moved from Camp Latham to Camp Drum in Wilmington, and by March 1862, all but one company of Camp Latham's troops had been moved to Camp Drum. The camp was built between 1862 and 1863 at a cost of $1 million and consisted of 19 buildings located on in Wilmington with another near the harbor. By March 1864, official letters and papers referred to the encampment as Drum Barracks rather than Camp Drum.\n\nCamp Drum and Drum Barracks get their name from Col. Richard Coulter Drum, then Assistant Adjutant General of the Army's Department of the Pacific, stationed in San Francisco, and not after a percussion instrument. There is no record that Col. Drum ever saw or set foot in the station bearing his name.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Camp Drum was the headquarters of the District of Southern California and the home to the California Column, commanded by Colonel James Henry Carleton. Between 2,000 and 7,000 soldiers were stationed at Camp Drum, and Wilmington became a thriving community with a population greater than Los Angeles during the war.\n\nIn 1862, Texas Volunteers had taken control of large portions of New Mexico Territory (which included present-day Arizona) for the Confederacy, and Colonel Carleton was ordered to retake control of the territory. Approximately 2,350 soldiers from the California Column marched from Camp Drum and fought the Battle of Picacho Pass, the westernmost battle of the Civil War.\n\nIn 1864, the federal government feared attempts by Confederate sympathizers to outfit privateers to sink ships carrying gold and silver from the Comstock Lode to aid the Union. To deprive them of an anchorage, Company C, 4th California Infantry under Captain West, occupied Catalina Island on January 1, 1864, and put an end to gold mining by ordering everyone off the island. A small garrison of Union troops were stationed at Camp Santa Catalina Island on the isthmus on the island's west end for about nine months. Their barracks remain as the oldest structure on the island in the Two Harbors area and are currently the home of the Isthmus Yacht Club.\n\nCamp Drum also served as a deterrent to Confederate sympathizers in the Los Angeles area, helped keep the territory loyal to the Union, and prevented Confederate use of the Los Angeles harbor.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Camp Drum remained active for several years in the Indian Wars. By 1870, it had been deactivated and fallen into disrepair. In October 1871, the \"Los Angeles Star\" reported that all remaining troops at Drum Barracks had been ordered to Fort Yuma.\n\nIn 1873, the government returned the land to Banning and Wilson after auctioning off the buildings. Banning bought five of the buildings for $2,917, and Wilson bought one for $200.\n\nIn 1927, the Drum Barracks was designated a historic monument by the Native Sons of the Golden West, and in 1935 it was officially designated as California Historic Landmark #169. With the formation of the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission in 1962, Drum Barracks was one of the first sites designated as a Historic Cultural Landmark (HCM #21), receiving the monument designation in 1963. It was also designated as and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.\n\nIn 1963, the owner of the property offered the property for sale, and concerns arose about its potential demolition. Under the leadership of Walter Holstein, local residents formed The Society for The Preservation of Drum Barracks, raising funds to purchase the property. In 1967, under the leadership of Oliver Vickery, curator of the Banning House, and Joan Lorenzen, the State of California purchased the Drum Barracks, with the Society retaining responsibility for maintenance and operation of the barracks as a historic site. In 1986, the State turned over the property to the City of Los Angeles on the condition that it be operated as a Civil War museum.\n\nThe surviving 16-room structure was the officers' quarters, which was once one of 19 similar buildings on the site. Today, the barracks is open as a museum which commemorates California's contribution to the Civil War.\n\nThe surviving building holds a local reputation as the locale of various paranormal activity, with visitors and local residents claiming to hear the sound of rattling chains or wagon wheels and horses' hooves, seeing smoke (presumably from soldiers' pipes), spotting apparitions of a woman in a hoop skirt, and smelling a strong lavender violet perfume. The Drum Barracks was profiled on \"Unsolved Mysteries\" in the early 1990s in a segment called 'Civil War Ghosts'. Some of the people interviewed in that segment claimed to have seen apparitions of Civil War soldiers. In 2005 the Barracks was featured in an episode of \"Most Haunted\".\n\n\n"}

In the Eastern Orthodox Church certain official awards and honours may be bestowed upon members of the clergy and laity. Such awards are bestowed either by the ruling bishop under whose jurisdiction the recipient resides, or—in the case of higher awards— by a synod of bishops. \n\nWhen a bishop wishes to confer an ecclesiastical award or honor on a deacon or priest under his jurisdiction, this will normally be accomplished at the Little Entrance of the Divine Liturgy. At the end of the Third Antiphon (normally the Beatitudes), the procession with the Gospel Book will halt at the bishop's cathedra (episcopal throne). The clergyman who is to receive the award will be presented to the bishop, the protodeacon will remove the bishop's mitre, the bishop will lay his hand upon the head of the clergyman and say the prayer proper to that particular award. He will then confer the award and the people will exclaim, \"Axios! Axios! Axios!\" as an expression of their acknowledgment of the clergyman's worthiness for the award, similar to applause at a secular awards ceremony.\n\nAwards differ according to the rank of the individual honored, and will vary among the ecclesiastical jurisdictions. Awards granted to bishops and the higher awards to priests are often reserved to begin conferred by a synod of bishops.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of these awards have their origin in the Byzantine court, others developed later. During the reign of Catherine the Great these awards came to be tied to the stipend which was paid to clergymen.\n"}

It is a sacred grass of the indigenous people's of the United States. It is used as a smudge, in herbal medicine and in the production of distilled beverages (e.g., Żubrówka, Wisent). It owes its distinctive sweet scent to the presence of coumarin.\nThis variety of grass is different from the species commonly known as buffalo grass (\"Stenotaphrum secundatum\") in Australia.\n\n\"Hierochloe odorata\" is a very hardy perennial, able to grow to the Arctic Circle. Its leaves do not have rigid stems, so only grow to about in height, and then the leaves grow outward horizontally to long or more, by late summer. The base of the leaf, just below the soil surface, is broad and white, without hairs; the underside of the leaf is shiny, without hairs. In the wild, the bases of the leaves are frequently purple-red colored, and this indicates a phosphorus-deficient soil.\n\nThere are several strains of sweetgrass — a regular strain that can be harvested once or twice a year, and a naturally occurring polyploid strain, which is much faster growing and can be harvested three to five times a year.\n\nTwo chemicals found in sweetgrass, phytol and coumarin, repel mosquitoes.\n\nThe name \"Hierochloe odorata\" is from the Greek and Latin. \"Hierochloe\" means \"holy grass\" and \"odorata\" means \"fragrant\". Some authors include \"Hierochloe\" in \"Anthoxanthum\"; in this case this species is given the epithet \"nitens\" to avoid confusion with a different species, \"Anthoxanthum odoratum\", sweet vernal grass.\n\nPropagation is easiest by cutting out plugs from established plants. Grown in sun or partial shade, they do not like drought. Seeds are usually not viable, or if they are, take two to three years to develop a robust root system.\n\nIn North America \"Hierochloe odorata\" occurs in southern Canada, northern Great Plains/Rocky Mountains and northwest of U.S., and New England. In continental Europe it occurs north from Switzerland. There is only one site in Ireland, and it is recorded in four counties of Scotland.\n\nThe plant is harvested by cutting grass in early to late summer at the desired length. \"Hierochloe odorata\" harvested after the first frost has little or no scent and is less desirable for basketry. Basketweavers sun-dry cut sweet grass until it is dry and brittle. The brittle form of sweet grass must be soaked in warm water until it becomes pliable. The pliable grass is typically braided into thick threads and then redried for use.\n\nHoly grass was strewn before church doors on saints' days in northern Europe, presumably because of the sweet smell that arose when it was trodden on. It was used in France to flavor candy, tobacco, soft drinks, and perfumes. In Europe, the species \"Hierochloe alpina\" is frequently substituted or used interchangeably. In Russia, it was used to flavor tea. It is still used in flavored vodka, the most notable example being Polish Żubrówka.\n\nSweet grass is widely used by North American indigenous peoples from many different Nations. Among many of the Plains Indians is considered one of the \"four sacred medicines\". Though being used for many purposes, its main purpose for many tribes is to attract good spirits. It is also known as the \"Hair of Mother Earth\".\n\n"}
{"id": "3082906", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3082906", "title": "Hyderabadi Muslims", "text": "Hyderabadi Muslims\n\nHyderabadi Muslims are an ethnoreligious community of Dakhini Urdu-speaking Muslims, part of a larger group of Dakhini Muslims, from the area that used to be the princely state of Hyderabad, India, including cities like Hyderabad, Aurangabad, Latur, Gulbarga and Bidar.\n\nWhile the term \"Hyderabadi\" now only refers to residents in and around the city of Hyderabad, the term Hyderabadi Muslims can refer to those native Muslim residents of the erstwhile princely state. The native language of the Hyderabadi Muslims is Hyderabadi Urdu, which is a form of the Dakhini language.\n\nWith their origins in the Muslim Bahmani Sultanate and then the Deccan sultanates, Hyderabadi Muslim culture became defined in the latter half of the reign of the Asif Jahi Dynasty in Hyderabad. The culture exists today mainly in the old city of Hyderabad, Aurangabad, Bidar and among the Hyderabadi Muslim diaspora around the world, in particular, Pakistan, the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, USA, Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Deccan plateau acted as a bulwark sheltering South India from the invasions and political turmoil that affected North India. This allowed the Muslim-ruled state of Hyderabad to develop a distinctive culture during the Qutb Shahi dynasty, brief Mughal rule and later the Asaf Jahi dynasty of the Nizams.\n\nAccording to \"Time\", the seventh Nizam was the richest man in the world during the late 1940s, and fifth richest person of all time according to Forbes Magazine after adjustment for inflation and currency purchasing power parity.\n\nThe Nizam was the Muslim ruler of the vast princely Hyderabad State. The capital city of Hyderabad was primarily Urdu-speaking Muslim until the Incorporation of Hyderabad into India and the subsequent rise to dominance of Telugu-speaking people of Telangana State. The state's economy was agrarian, and Hyderabad was primarily a government and administrative hub, run mostly (but far from exclusively) by Muslims. The aristocracy, \"jagirdars\" and \"deshmukhs\" (wealthy landowners), and even minor government officials, could afford to hire servants, usually also Muslims, in a social order similar to the class system of Victorian England. The Nizam allied himself with the British early on, with ensuing political stability. The Muslim upper and middle classes were free to concentrate on a care-free and leisurely lifestyle involving clothes, jewelry, food, music, literary arts, and other indulgences, little of which trickled down to the servant class, known as \"naukar\" (a word originally used for the Mughal Emperor Babur's closest feudal retainers).\n\nAfter the fall of the Mughal Empire in 1857, many Muslim writers, poets, scholars, musicians and other eminent personalities migrated from Delhi to Hyderabad in hope of seeking patronage of the Nizam or the nobility. Muslims continued to emigrate to the state seeking employment in the Nizam's court, army, Hyderabad Civil Service or educational institutions. Among those who spent significant time in Hyderabad are writers Dagh Dehlvi, Fani Badayuni, Josh Malihabadi, Ali Haider Tabatabai, religious scholar Shilbi Nomani and classical musicians Tanrus Khan and Bade Ghulam Ali Khan. \n\nAfter Indian Independence from the British Raj, Hyderabad State, under the rule of the seventh Nizam lasted for a year, until September 18, 1948, when the Indian Army launched Operation Polo, and invaded Hyderabad state, annexing it into the Indian Union. The Invasion resulted in the massacre of thousands of Hyderabadi Muslims, and mass migration mainly to the west, and Pakistan.\n\nThe Integration of Hyderabad, into the dominion of India, other than the shock of the controversial massacre of the integration, took a turn of an identity crisis for the Hyderabadi Muslim people. Thousands of Hyderabadi Muslims emigrated from the newly integrated Indian state of Hyderabad to Pakistan, the UK, the U.S. and Canada, resulting in a large diaspora.\n\nThe people who migrated to Pakistan were now placed under a new term called Muhajir, along with other Urdu speaking immigrants from present day India. The Muhajir people began to dominate politics and business mainly in the metropolitan city of Karachi but their unique Hyderabadi Muslim Identity was lost, and has now evolved into a result of Karachi's booming cosmopolitan scene. The Hyderabadi Muslims who stayed in the integrated Hyderabad state were faced with new language issues, and a wave of immigration from other Indian states, especially after 1956.\n\nAfter the Indian reorganization of 1956, with states being divided on linguistic lines, Hyderabadi Muslims, in Telangana, Marathwada, and Hyderabad-Karnataka were faced with the learning and emerging dominance of Telugu, Marathi, and Kannada respectively, and their native language Dakhini became a home language while Urdu in the forefront of Politics in these regions became comparatively less widespread. The present day Hyderabadi Muslims know very little about their cultural heritage, especially those who aren't from Hyderabad city, or India. Hyderabadi Muslims are now seen as a result of Indian cosmopolitanism, and their history is being lost in Indian textbooks.\n\nThe relative isolation of Hyderabad until annexation to India, its distinctive dialect of Urdu and the strong web of interconnecting family relationships that still characterizes Hyderabadi Muslims, sometimes leads to charges of parochialism from other Indian Muslim communities, but it also ensures a Hyderabadi Muslim identity endures among the Indian diaspora.\n\nThe largest concentration of Hyderabadi Muslims is in the old city of Hyderabad. After the Partition of India and the Incorporation of Hyderabad by India, the Muslims of the state lost their privileged status, so significant numbers chose to migrate to other countries such as Pakistan, the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, the United States, UK, Canada and Australia.\n\nA section of Hyderabadi Muslims are of Hadhrami Arab origin, who came to serve in the Nizam's military. They are known as Chaush and mostly reside in the Barkas neighbourhood of Hyderabad. There are also some Siddis who are of African descent.\n\nIn Pakistan, most of the Hyderabadi migrants are settled in the southern port city of Karachi. Estimates of the Hyderabadi population in Karachi range between 20,000 and 200,000 today. The main neighbourhoods where the Hyderabadi migrants in Karachi initially settled were Hyderabad Colony, Bahadurabad and Laiqabad. In 2007, a replica of the famous Charminar monument in Hyderabad was built at the main crossing of Bahadurabad. Some notable Pakistani people who migrated from the former Hyderabad State include Muhammad Raziuddin Siddiqui, Syed Mohammad Ahsan, Asif Iqbal Razvi, Waheed Yar Khan, and Anwar Maqsood.\n\nHyderabadi Muslims today, refer to the Urdu speaking Muslim community, from the 1801 landlocked princely state of Hyderabad, who developed a distinct cultural identity from other Dakhini Muslims. Even though the princely state of Hyderabad had once reached the southernmost points of India, it's the culture from the known landlocked territories of the Nizam, that constitutes Hyderabadi Muslim culture, while the Dakhini Muslims of the Carnatic, and the Circars, developed their own distinct culture, and culinary tradition. The Chaush community, even though they speak Urdu, and live in the erstwhile Hyderabad State, are usually not considered Hyderabadi Muslims, since they came recently to the region. Even though they absorbed many Hyderabadi Muslim cultural features, namely language and cuisine (Chaush cuisine has more Arab influences), they're a more homogeneous group, of Hadhrami Arab ancestry, and reside in close knit Chaush communities such as the Barkas neighborhood of Hyderabad. This is compared to most Hyderabadi Muslims, who have ancestries from various ethnic origins, and are less a homogeneous group.\nHyderabadi Muslims have organized themselves politically along religious lines.The most prominent example of this is the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, currently led by Asaduddin Owaisi. The party dominates the politics in Hyderabad's Old City, and consistently wins seats for the Lok Sabha (Lower House of Indian Parliament) and the Telangana Legislative Assembly. The party claims to represent the interests of Muslims by campaigning for greater protection of minority rights. A rival breakaway faction of the AIMIM is the Majlis Bachao Tehreek that also claims to represent the interests of Muslims in Hyderabad.\n\nHyderabadi Muslims who have been strong supporters of secular progressive movements, such as Indian freedom fighters Maulvi Allauddin, Turrebaz Khan, Abid Hasan, Urdu poets Makhdoom Mohiuddin and Sulaiman Areeb, and Hassan Nasir who participated in the Telangana Rebellion against the rule of the Nizam. Hyderabadi Muslims were also at the forefront of the formation of the Comrades Association in 1939, one of the first communist organizations in Hyderabad which struggled against the Nizam. Other secular members of the community include Shoaibullah Khan, the editor of the Urdu daily \"Imroz\" that was critical of the Razakars and urged Hyderabad's integration with India (he was stabbed to death). The story of a poor Muslim peasant named \"Bandagi\" who was killed while struggling against the landlord was immortalised in the popular drama Ma Bhoomi about the Telangana Rebellion. In 1946, editor of Urdu daily\" Saltanat\" Sayyid Ahmedullah Qadri was the first journalist of Hyderabad state who wrote articles on the One nation Theory.\n\nHyderabadi Muslims, are noted for their hospitable nature also known as Deccani Tehzeeb. While Hyderabadi Muslims take pride in their \"Nawabi\" language, literature, poetry, architecture, and cuisine. The performing arts are often overlooked, especially regarding Hyderabadi culture. In fact, the culture of the Hyderabadi Muslims is being lost. The founding of the city of Hyderabad can be attributed to one of the wives of Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, Queen Bhagyamati, who was a dancer in the courts of the Golkonda kings, with whom the founder of Hyderabad had named the city in her honour, \"Bhagyanagar\", and later Hyderabad. Tales of the legendary dancers Taramati, and Premamati, are also an insight into the rich culture under the Qutb Shahi era. Mah Laqa Bhai, a prominent Hyderabadi Muslim poet of the 18th century, patronized the Kathak dance form in the courts of the Nizam, which is now being lost amongst Hyderabadi Muslims. \n\nApart from these, a traditional Hyderabadi Muslim wedding is identified by various local traditional elements, such as the traditional garb, Sherwani for the groom and Khada Dupatta along with jewelry for the bride, as well as Hyderabadi cuisine served at the ceremony.\n\nAnother cultural practice unique to the region is \"Tasmia Qwani\" also known as \"Bismillah Ceremony\", family ceremony in which a Muslim child is initiated to read the Quran. It is also characterized by local elements.\n\nCommunal Harmony, known as Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb, is integral to the Culture of Hyderabad.\n\nOther than musical forms of art, Hyderabadi Muslims have taken great honour in the writing, and reading of poetry, and annual Mushairas and Mehfils take place around the world, which has become a symbol of unity for Hyderabadi Muslims, and Urdu poets alike, continuing an ancient tradition.\n\nOne of the most identifiable markers of Hyderabadi Muslim culture is the local dialect of Urdu, called Hyderabadi Urdu which in itself is a form of Dakhini. It is distinct by its mixture of vocabulary from Turkish, Persian and Arabic, as well in some vocabulary from Telugu and Marathi that are not found in the standard dialect of Urdu. In terms of pronunciation, the easiest way to recognize a Hyderabadi Urdu is use of \"nakko\"(no) and \"hau\"(yes); whereas in standard Urdu its \"nahi\" for (no) and \"haa\" for (yes).\n\nThough Hyderabadi Urdu or Dakhini are the native languages of the Hyderabadi Muslim people, most people can speak standard Urdu, and often put Urdu as their mother tongue on censuses, as Dakhini is not a recognized language as such. Along with the languages they learn from birth, they can speak Hindi, which is mutually ineligible with standard Urdu, and taught in most Indian schools. Hyderabadi Muslims can also speak the majority languages spoken in the regions they live, namely Telugu, Marathi, and Kannada. The other important characteristic of the natives is cultural refinement in terms of interpersonal communication, referred to as \"meethi boli\" (sweet and civilised speech). \"Tameez\", \"tehzeeb\" and \"akhlaq\" (etiquette, custom, and tradition) are considered very important and guests are treated well with a lot of \"mehmaan nawaazi\" (hospitality).\n\nThe Qutb Shahs were regarded as the great patrons of Urdu, Farsi and Telugu language. The region saw a growth of Deccani Urdu literature, the \"Deccani Masnavi\" and \"Diwan\" composed during those periods are among the earliest available manuscripts in the Urdu language. The literary work of this region is influenced with the regional Marathi, Telugu, and Kannada in parallel with Arabic and Persian including the adoption of poetic meters and a great quantity of renovated words. The Fifth Sultan of the dynasty, Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah was himself an Urdu poet.\n\nThe period of Nizams saw a growth of literary growth since after printing was introduced in Hyderabad. In 1824 AD, the first collection of Urdu \"Ghazals\" named \"Gulzar-e-Mahlaqa\" (Mahlaqa's garden of flowers) written by Mah Laqa Bai, was printed and published from Hyderabad.\n\nAfter the Revolt of 1857, many Urdu writers, scholars and poets who lost their patronage at Delhi made Hyderabad their home, that grew and brought reforms in the literary and poetry work. Scholars continued to migrate to Hyderabad during the reign of Asaf Jah VI and his successor Asaf Jah VII. These included Shibli Nomani, Dagh Dehlvi, Fani Badayuni, Josh Malihabadi, Ali Haider Tabatabai, Zahir Dehlvi and many others.\n\nThe reign of Nizam VII saw many reforms in literary work. For the first time in history the Nizams introduced Urdu as a language of court, administration and education. Other notable poets, scholars and writers of the early 20th century are Amjad Hyderabadi, Makhdoom Mohiuddin, Sayyid Shamsullah Qadri, Mohiuddin Qadri Zore and Sulaiman Areeb. Maharaja Sir Kishen Pershad, although not a Muslim himself, was steeped in Hyderabadi Muslim Culture and wrote poetry under the pen name \"Shad\".\n\nIn 2017, Urdu was declared the second official language of the state of Telangana. (after Telugu) This move was praised by many, especially Muslims of Hyderabad who spoke Urdu as their mother tongue.\n\nThough, the once great dance traditions among the Hyderabadi Muslims are almost lost, two distinct, cultural practices are still popular, namely Marfa, and Dholak ke Geet. Marfa was brought by the Siddi and Chaush peoples, of Africa and Yemen, who were deployed in the army of the Nizams. This music, is accompanied by the beating drums of a great tradition, which were once popular in national celebrations of the dissolved Hyderabad state, is still popular among Hyderabadi Muslims in weddings. \"Dholak ke geet\" is also one such great tradition. \"Dholak ke geet\" are songs, that have been orally passed down from generation to generation since the time of the Nizams, and is sung at weddings, accompanied by a Dholak drum.\n\n\"Qawwali\" is also popular among the community, and is performed regularly at \"dargahs\" such as Dargah Yousufain and Dargah Pahadi Shareef. It used to be patronized by the Nizams as well as the nobility. The great classical musicians such as Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Inayat Khan, Ustad Tanrus Khan, Munshi Raziuddin and Bahauddin Khan used to perform at the Nizam's court. The contemporary \"qawwals\" Ateeq Hussain Khan and the Warsi Brothers reside in Hyderabad and perform regularly in the city.\n\nThe native cooking style of the community is the Hyderabadi cuisine, which evolved during the Asaf Jahi period. It is heavily influenced by Mughal, Turkish, and Arab along with the influence of the native Telugu and Marathwada cuisines. It comprises a broad repertoire of rice, wheat and meat dishes and the skilled use of various spices, herbs and natural edibles.\n\nSome famous Hyderabadi cuisine (dishes) that are served at weddings are: Hyderabadi Biryani, Haleem, Khubani ka Mitha, Gil-e-Firdaus, Double Ka Meetha, Luqmi, Kaddu ki Kheer (A type of Kheer), Mirchi ka Salan and Baghare Baigan.\n\nOther popular food items are: Chakna, Tamate ka Kut, Khatti Dal, Dalcha, Shirmal, Rawghani Roti, Nahari, Pasande, Pathar Ka Ghosht, Naan, Dum Ka Murgh, Khagina, Khichdi, Nargisi Kheema, Shaami, Kofte, Tala Hua Ghosht, Poori, Kheer, Sheer Khorma, Til ka Khatta, Til ki Chutney and Qubuli, Shikampur, Tahari, Khichdi. The Arab dishes Mandi and Shawarma are also popular.\n\nThe dishes are tied to events, such as Hyderabadi Haleem, made almost exclusively during the month of Ramadan, and Sheer Khorma which is especially made on the day of Eid-ul-Fitr. Talawa Gosht is prepared on Fridays.\n\nIrani Chai is enjoyed throughout the city, along with Osmania Biscuits. Irani Cafes found all over Hyderabad serve these along with Lukhmi, Samosa and other snacks.\n\nThe \"Khada Dupatta\" or \"Khara Dupatta\" (uncut veil) is an outfit composed of a \"kurta\" (tunic), \"chooridaar\" (ruched pair of pants), and 6 yard \"dupatta\" (veil) and is traditionally worn by Hyderabad brides. Sometimes the \"kurta\" is sleeveless and worn over a \"koti\" resembling a choli. The bride also wears a matching \"ghoonghat\" (veil) over her head. The accompanying jewellery is:\n\n\nThe \"Sherwani\" is the traditional men's garb of Hyderabad. It is a coat-like tunic with a tight-fitting collar (hook & eyelet fastening), close-fitting in the upper torso and flaring somewhat in its lower half. It usually has six or seven buttons, often removable ones made from gold sovereigns for special occasions. The material is usually silk or wool. A groom may use gold brocade for his wedding sherwani, but otherwise good taste dictates understated colors, albeit with rich and textured fabrics. The sherwani is usually worn over a silk or cotton \"kurta\" (long shirt) and \"pyjamas\" (baggy pants with a drawstring at the waist).\n\nThe \"Sherwani\" is closely associated with Hyderabad, although it has spread since to the rest of India and to Pakistan. Former Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru adapted its design and turned it into his trademark \"Nehru Jacket\", further popularizing the garment.\n\nAttar, or \"Ittar\" is a traditional perfume made from botanical sources. It is still available in the bazaars near Charminar and at the Moazam Jahi Market. Many of the older generations still prefer \"attar\" over modern perfumes.\n\nThe majority of Hyderabadi Muslims are Sunni and the two largest minorities are Shia and Mahdavi. Sunni Muslims mostly follow the Hanafi school of Islamic Jurisprudence, although the Chaush community follows the Shafi'i school of thought. Islam in Hyderabad, with historical patronizing by the rulers, has a strong Sufi influence. Tablighi Jamaat has also been active since late 1950's, with its headquarters at Jama Masjid Mallepally. Salafis, Dawoodi Bohra and Ismai'li are also in some areas. Bismillah ceremony is an Islam initiation ceremony held for children, unique to the region.\n\nMourning of Muharram is observed by the Shia community. Processions are held every year, since the time of the Qutb Shahi dynasty as well as the Nizams. \n\nReligious knowledge and its propagation flourished under the Nizam with institutions like the world-famous Jamia Nizamia. The largest Mosque of Hyderabad, the Makkah Masjid gathers congregations of more than two hundred thousand on the occasions of Eid prayers and \"Jumu'at-al Wida\". (the last Friday of Ramadan) \n\nHyderabad has also produced many renowned religious scholars of representing different Islamic sects and trends, including Bahadur Yar Jung, Muhammad Hamidullah, Hashim Amir Ali, Sayyid Shamsullah Qadri, Sayyid Ahmedullah Qadri, Abul Ala Maududi and M. A. Muqtedar Khan.\n\n\n"}

Members who engage in conduct that is considered inappropriate may be counseled privately by elders and congregational responsibilities may be withheld or restricted. If initial counsel is not accepted, elders may present a talk to the congregation about the type of behavior, alerting other members already aware of the individual's conduct to limit social interaction with that person.\nHearings involving \"serious sin\" are performed by formal \"judicial committees\", in which guilt and repentance are determined by a tribunal of elders. A variety of controls can be enforced, from \"reproof\" and restriction of congregational duties to excommunication, known as \"disfellowshipping\", which includes shunning by the congregation. Individuals who are disfellowshipped may be reinstated after an extended period if they are deemed to demonstrate repentance. The practice of disfellowshipping has been criticized by many non-members and ex-members.\n\nAt the elders' discretion, \"non-judicial\" situations may involve discipline of one or more of several types.\n\n\"Counsel\" may be given in situations involving actions that are considered inappropriate but are not considered to be of sufficient gravity to necessitate a judicial committee. Counsel may be provided by a mature Witness in addition to self-discipline and family discipline. Elders may also give recommendations or warnings to members in non-judicial situations.\n\nAt conventions and assemblies, and about once each month at a local midweek meeting, a short talk regarding \"local needs\" is presented. An elder addresses matters that are relevant to the local congregation, with instructions outlining the course of action considered appropriate. No specific individuals are identified during the talk, but the talk may relate to a matter for which a member has recently been \"reproved\". At times, some temporary policy may be announced that might be seen as disciplinary; for example, it may be that an additional attendant is assigned outside a Kingdom Hall to discourage children from running on the sidewalk.\n\nPersonal \"shepherding visits\" are intended to encourage members of the congregation, though may also include counsel and correction, then or on a subsequent visit. Two elders (or an elder and a ministerial servant) may schedule and perform a particular shepherding visit on their own or at the direction of the body of elders.\n\nThe body of elders may withhold its recommendation for a member to serve in a new position of responsibility, though still permitting existing responsibilities.\n\nFor example, a ministerial servant who consistently seems insufficiently prepared for his meeting parts may have such assignments withheld for a time, even though he may continue serving as a ministerial servant or in some other \"special privilege of service\".\n\nAn active Jehovah's Witness may have their congregational \"privileges of service\" limited, even without having committed a serious sin. While Witnesses sometimes refer to field ministry, after-meeting cleanup, and other responsibilities as \"privileges\", the term \"privileges of service\" often implies a specific range of assignments assisting elders and ministerial servants with meeting demonstrations and other responsibilities. Such limitations are usually temporary.\n\nElders, ministerial servants, pioneers, or other appointed Witnesses can lose their \"special privileges of service\". For example, an elder may be removed or choose to step aside voluntarily from his position if members of his household are not in \"good standing\". After resignation or removal from an appointed position, an announcement is made during the congregation's Service Meeting indicating that the person is \"no longer serving [in that capacity]\", without elaboration.\n\nMembers who persist in a course considered scripturally wrong after repeated counsel by elders, but who are not considered guilty of something for which they could be disfellowshipped, can be \"marked\", based on Jehovah's Witnesses' interpretation of 2 Thessalonians 3:14. Actions for which an individual may be \"marked\" include dating a non-member, dating when not \"scripturally\" or legally free to marry, being lazy, critical, or dirty, meddling, taking material advantage of others or indulging in \"improper\" entertainment. \"Marking\" is indicated by means of a warning talk given to the congregation outlining the shameful course, without explicitly naming any particular individual. Members who know whose actions are being discussed may then consider the individual \"marked\". Though not shunned, \"marked\" individuals are looked upon as \"bad association\" and social interaction outside of formal worship settings is generally curtailed. This action is intended to \"shame\" the person into following a particular course of action.\n\nIf an active baptized Witness is considered to have committed a \"serious sin\" for which the individual must demonstrate formal repentance, correction (or, \"discipline\") is administered by the congregation's body of elders. Such situations usually involve a \"judicial committee\" of three or more elders.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses consider many actions to be \"serious sins\", for which baptized Witnesses are subject to a judicial committee hearing. Such actions include:\n\nAn individual may also be disfellowshipped for promoting one of the above listed \"sins\" without actually engaging in the practice, or for accepting employment related to one of them (e.g. selling lottery tickets, firearms or cigarettes; working in an abortion clinic, church or military base).\n\nIf a baptized Witness teaches contrary to Witness doctrines, it is considered apostasy and grounds for disfellowshipping. A 1981 letter to overseers—reproduced in a book by former Governing Body member Raymond Franz—directed that a member who \"persists in believing other doctrine\", even without promoting such beliefs, may also be subject to disfellowshipping. Elders usually try to reason with the individual before such action is taken. If a person believes that a teaching should be adjusted or changed, he is encouraged \"to be patient and wait on Jehovah for change\".\"The Watchtower\" states that \"apostates are \"mentally diseased,\" and they seek to infect others with their disloyal teachings. (1 Timothy 6:3, 4 [\"NWT\"]).\"; some have stated that this applies to all individuals who leave the organization.\n\nEvidence for actions that can result in congregational discipline is obtained by voluntary confession to the elders or by witnesses of the violation. A minimum of two witnesses is required to establish guilt, based on their understanding of Deuteronomy 17:6 and Matthew 18:16, unless the person confesses voluntarily. Members are instructed to report serious sins committed by others members. Failure to report a serious sin of another member is viewed as sharing in the sins of others, a sin before God. Witnesses are instructed that pledges of confidentiality may be broken to report what they believe to be transgressions.\n\nA congregation's body of elders considers confessions or credible allegations of serious sin, and decides whether a \"judicial committee\" will be formed to address the matter. A judicial committee, usually consisting of three elders, investigates the details of the alleged sin further. The committee arranges a formal \"judicial hearing\" to determine the circumstances of the sin, whether the accused is repentant, and whether disciplinary actions will be taken.\n\nIn certain situations, a body of elders may handle a situation involving \"serious sin\" by a baptized Witness without a judicial committee:\n\nA person accused of a serious sin is informed of the allegations and invited to attend a judicial committee meeting. The individual is permitted to bring witnesses who can speak in their defense; observers are not allowed, and the hearing is held privately even if the accused individual requests that it be heard openly so all may witness the evidence. Recording devices are not permitted at the hearing. If the accused repeatedly fails to attend an arranged hearing, the committee will proceed but will not make a decision until evidence and testimony by witnesses are considered.\n\nThe committee takes the role of prosecutor, judge and jury when handling its cases. After the hearing is opened with a prayer, the accused is invited to make a personal statement. If there is no admission of guilt, the individual is informed of the source of the charges and witnesses are presented one at a time to give evidence. Witnesses do not remain present for the entire hearing. Once all the evidence is presented, the accused and all witnesses are dismissed and the committee reviews the evidence and the attitude of the accused.\n\nThe committee may determine that there was no \"serious sin\", or that mitigating circumstances absolve the accused individual. The committee may then proceed with discipline such as is described for 'non-judicial' situations. Alternatively, the committee may decide that a serious sin was committed, in which case, the committee gives verbal admonitions and gauges the individual's attitude and repentance. The committee then decides whether discipline will involve formal reproof or disfellowshipping.\n\n\"Reproof\" involves actions for which a person could be disfellowshipped, and is said to be an effort to 'reach the heart' and convince a person of the need to hate the sanctioned actions and repent. Reproof is considered sufficient if the individual is deemed repentant.\nReproof is given before all who are aware of the transgression. If the conduct is known only to the individual and the judicial committee, reproof is given privately. If the sin is known by a small number, they would be invited by the elders, and reproof would be given before the sinner and those with knowledge of the sin. If the action is known generally by the entire congregation or the wider community, an announcement is made that the person \"has been reproved\". A related \"local needs\" talk may be given, separately to the announcement, without naming anyone.\n\nIn all cases of reproof, restrictions are imposed, typically prohibiting the individual from sharing in meeting parts, commenting during meetings, and giving group prayers. A reproved Witness cannot enroll as a pioneer or auxiliary pioneer for at least one year after reproof is given.\n\nAll members are expected to abide by the beliefs and moral standards of Jehovah's Witnesses. Serious violations of these requirements can result in \"disfellowshipping\" (similar to excommunication) and subsequent shunning if not deemed repentant. When a judicial committee decides that a baptized Witness has committed a serious sin and is unrepentant, the person is disfellowshipped. A person who believes that a serious error in judgment has been made may appeal the decision. Requests for appeal must be made in writing and within seven days of the decision of the judicial committee. Their shunning policy is based on their interpretation of scriptures such as 1 Corinthians 5:11–13; Matthew 18:15–17; and 2 John 9–11. Witness literature states that avoiding interaction with disfellowshipped former adherents helps to:\n\nShunning is also practiced when a member formally resigns membership or is deemed to indicate by their actions—such as accepting a blood transfusion or association with another religion or military organization—that they do not wish to be known as a Witness. Such individuals are said to have \"disassociated\", and are described by the Watch Tower Society as \"lawless\" in a spiritual sense.\n\nWhen a person is disfellowshipped or is deemed to have disassociated, an announcement is made at the next midweek meeting that the named individual \"is no longer one of Jehovah's Witnesses\". Congregation members are not informed whether a person is being shunned due to \"disfellowshipping\" or \"disassociation\", or on what grounds. Shunning starts immediately after the announcement is made. A notification form is sent to the local branch office and records of the disfellowshipping are saved in the congregational records. Both are kept until at least five years after reinstatement.\n\nFailure to adhere to the directions on shunning is itself considered a serious offense. Members who continue to speak to or associate with a disfellowshipped or disassociated person are said to be sharing in their \"wicked works\" and may themselves be disfellowshipped. Exceptions are made in some cases, such as business relations and immediate family household situations. If a disfellowshipped person is living in the same home with other baptized family members, religious matters are not discussed, with the exception of minors, for whose training parents are still responsible. Disfellowshipped family members outside the home are shunned. Disfellowshipped individuals can continue attending public meetings held at the Kingdom Hall, though they are shunned by the congregation.\n\nDisfellowshipped individuals may be reinstated into the congregation if they are considered repentant of their previous actions and attitude. If a disassociated or disfellowshipped individual requests reinstatement, a judicial committee, (the committee originally involved, if available) seeks to determine whether the person has repented. Such individuals must demonstrate that they no longer practice the conduct for which they were expelled from the congregation, as well as submission to the group's regulations. Individuals disfellowshipped for actions no longer considered serious sins, such as organ transplants, are not automatically reinstated. Attending meetings while being shunned is a requirement for eventual reinstatement. Once a decision is made to reinstate, a brief announcement is made to the congregation that the individual \"is reinstated as one of Jehovah's Witnesses\".\n\nElders are instructed to make an attempt each year to remind disfellowshipped individuals of the steps they can take to qualify for reinstatement. No specific period of time is prescribed before this can happen; however, the Watch Tower Society suggests a period of \"perhaps many months, a year, or longer.\" In 1974, the Watch Tower Society stated that about one third of those disfellowshipped eventually return to the group, based on figures gathered from 1963 to 1973.\n\nCongregational restrictions are imposed on reinstated individuals. Participation at religious meetings, including commenting from the audience, is initially not permitted; such \"privileges\" may be gradually permitted over time if the individual is considered to have \"progressed spiritually\". Reinstated individuals may be ineligible for many years from serving in positions of responsibility such as an elder, ministerial servant or pioneer.\n\nIn June 1987, the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld the Witnesses' right to shun those who fail to live by the group's standards and doctrines, upholding the ruling of a lower court. The court concluded that, \"Shunning is a practice engaged in by Jehovah's Witnesses pursuant to their interpretation of canonical text, and we are not free to reinterpret that text. ... We find the practice of shunning not to constitute a sufficient threat to the peace, safety, or morality of the community as to warrant state intervention. ... the defendants are entitled to the free exercise of their religious beliefs. ... Courts generally do not scrutinize closely the relationship among members (or former members) of a church. Churches are afforded great latitude when they impose discipline on members or former members. ... The members of the Church Paul decided to abandon have concluded that they no longer want to associate with her. We hold that they are free to make that choice. ... Although we recognize that the harms suffered by Janice Paul are real and not insubstantial, permitting her to recover for intangible or emotional injuries would unconstitutionally restrict the Jehovah's Witnesses free exercise of religion. ... The constitutional guarantee of the free exercise of religion requires that society tolerate the type of harms suffered by Paul as a price well worth paying to safeguard the right of religious difference that all citizens enjoy.\"\n\nIn a review of the case, the \"Washington University Law Quarterly\" remarked, \"The Ninth Circuit's extension of the free exercise clause to include a privilege against tort liability is incorrect. First, by distinguishing emotional harms from physical harms, the court downplayed the significance of an emotional injury, which is often times as great as physical harm. ... In most of the free exercise cases decided by the Supreme Court the government has acted against the religious group, either by imposing criminal sanctions for religious conduct or denying members some benefit because of their religious beliefs. In Paul, however, the religious group acted as the aggressor, violating the plaintiff's right to emotional well-being. By granting defendants an absolute privilege against tort liability, the court has allowed the Church to use the shield of the first amendment as a sword. ... The Paul decision is an unfortunate expansion of a doctrine intended to protect individual rights. To turn the doctrine on its head and use it as a means to thwart another person's rights is an ironic twist that would undoubtedly displease the drafters of the first amendment. ... At best, Paul can be viewed as a slight detour from the correct interpretation of the free exercise clause and the proper balancing of interests performed by the Supreme Court and numerous lower courts.\"\n\nAn unbaptized individual who has previously been approved to share in Jehovah's Witnesses' formal ministry, but who subsequently behaves in a manner considered inappropriate may lose privileges, such as commenting at meetings, receiving assignments, or even accompanying the congregation in the public ministry.\n\nIf an unbaptized individual is deemed unrepentant of actions for which baptized members might be disfellowshipped, an announcement would be made that the person \"is no longer a publisher of the good news.\" Such individuals were previously shunned, but formal restrictions are no longer imposed on unbaptized individuals, though association is generally curtailed. The elders might privately warn individuals in the congregation if the unbaptized person is considered to pose \"an unusual threat\".\n\nThe only way to officially leave Jehovah's Witnesses is to disassociate or be disfellowshipped, and both entail the same set of prohibitions and penalties, with no provision for continued normal association. Sociologist Andrew Holden has claimed that fear of family break-up or loss causes people who might otherwise freely leave the group to remain members. Jehovah's Witnesses state that disfellowshipping is a scripturally documented method to protect the congregation from the influence of those who practice serious wrongdoing. Critics contend that the judicial process itself, due to its private and nearly autonomous nature, directly contradicts the precedent found in the Bible and the organization's own teachings and can be used in an arbitrary manner if there is consensus among just a few to abuse their authority.\n\nAccording to Raymond Franz, a letter dated September 1, 1980, from the Watch Tower Society to all circuit and district overseers advised that a member who \"merely disagrees in thought with any of the Watch Tower Society's teachings is committing apostasy and is liable for disfellowshipping.\" The letter states that one does not have to \"promote\" different doctrines to be an apostate, adding that elders need to \"discern between one who is a trouble-making apostate and a Christian who becomes weak in the faith and has doubts.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "14240977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14240977", "title": "Jewish state", "text": "Jewish state\n\nThe \"Jewish state\" is a political term used to describe the nation state of Israel.\n\nModern Israel came into existence on 14 May 1948 as the homeland for the Jewish people. It was also defined in its declaration of independence as a \"Jewish state,\" a term that appeared in the United Nations partition decision of 1947 as well. The related term \"Jewish and democratic state\" dates from 1992 legislation by the Israeli Knesset.\n\nSince its establishment, Israel has passed many laws which reflect on the Jewish identity and values of the majority (about 75% in 2016) of its citizens. However, the secular versus religious debate in Israel in particular has focused debate on the Jewish nature of the state. Another aspect of the debate is the status of minorities in Israel, most notably the Israeli Arab population.\n\nIn pre-modern times, the religious laws of Judaism defined a number of prerogatives for a Halachic state. However, when Theodor Herzl who in 1896 wrote \"Der Judenstaat\" (\"The Jewish State\") giving birth to the modern Zionist movement, he envisioned a state based on European models, which included religious institutions under the aegis of the state. In order to avoid alienating the Ottoman Sultan, there was no explicit reference to a Jewish state by the Zionist Organisation that he founded. The phrase \"national home\" was intentionally used instead of \"state.\"\n\nThe 1942 Biltmore Program of the Zionist Organization explicitly proposed \"that Palestine be established as a Jewish Commonwealth.\" In 1946, the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry, also known as the Grady-Morrison Committee, noted that the demand for a Jewish State went beyond the obligations of either the Balfour Declaration or the Mandate, and had been expressly disowned by the Chairman of the Jewish Agency as recently as 1932.\n\nThe United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, which brought the British mandate to an end in 1948, referred to a \"Jewish state\" and an \"Arab state.\"\n\nThe term \"Jewish state\" has been in common usage in the media since the establishment of Israel, and the term was used interchangeably with Israel. George W. Bush used the term in his speeches and in an exchange of letters with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2004. Barack Obama has also used the phrase, for instance in a speech in September 2010 to the U.N. General Assembly. The Israeli government of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert made Palestinian recognition of Israel as a \"Jewish state\" a precondition in the peace negotiations, as has the government of his successor Benjamin Netanyahu. However, Palestinians regard a \"Jewish state\" as a trap, a new demand that did not come up during years of negotiations in the 1990s or in peace treaties reached with Egypt and Jordan. The Palestine Liberation Organization recognized the State of Israel as part of the Oslo Accords in 1993. Palestinians regard acceptance of the demand as giving up the right of return.\n\nIsrael has no official religion. However, the definition of the state as Jewish creates a strong connection as well as a conflict between state law and religious law. Political interaction of different parties keeps the balance between state and religion largely as it existed during the British Mandate.\n\nThe 1917 Balfour Declaration, referred to \"the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people\". The 1922 Churchill White Paper clarified that \"Phrases have been used such as that Palestine is to become 'as Jewish as England is English.' His Majesty's Government regard any such expectation as impracticable and have no such aim in view. They would draw attention to the fact that the terms of the Declaration referred to do not contemplate that Palestine as a whole should be converted into a Jewish National Home, but that such a Home should be founded 'in Palestine.'\"\n\nThe concept of a national homeland for the Jewish people is enshrined in Israeli national policy and reflected in many of Israel's public and national institutions. The concept was adopted in the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948 as the objective of the establishment of modern Israel. The principle was given legal effect in the Law of Return, which was passed by the Knesset on 5 July 1950, and stated \"Every Jew has the right to come to this country as an oleh.\" This was modified in 1970 to include non-Jews with a Jewish grandparent, and their spouses.\n\nThere has been ongoing debate in Israel on the character of the state, regarding whether it should enshrine more Jewish culture, encourage Judaism in schools, and enshrine certain laws of Kashrut and Shabbat observance. This debate reflects a historical divide within Zionism and among the Jewish citizens of Israel, which has large secular and traditional/Orthodox minorities as well as a majority which lies somewhere in between.\n\nSecular Zionism, the historically dominant stream, is rooted in a concept of the Jews as a people that have a right to self-determination. Another reason sometimes submitted for such establishment was to have a state where Jews would not be afraid of antisemitic attacks and live in peace. But such a reason is not a requirement of the self-determination right and so is subsidiary to it in secular Zionist thinking.\n\nReligious Zionists, who believe that religious beliefs and traditional practices are central to Jewish peoplehood, counter that assimilating to be a secular \"nation like any other\" would be oxymoronic in nature, and harm more than help the Jewish people. They seek instead to establish what they see as an \"authentic Jewish commonwealth\" which preserves and encourages Jewish heritage.\nDrawing an analogy to diaspora Jews who assimilated into other cultures and abandoned Jewish culture, whether voluntary or otherwise, they argue that the creation of a secular state in Israel is tantamount to establishing a state where Jews assimilate \"en masse\" as a nation, and therefore anathema to what they view as Jewish national aspirations. Zionism is rooted in a concept of the Jews as a nation. In this capacity, they believe that Israel has a mandate to promote Judaism, to be the center of Jewish culture and center of its population, perhaps even the sole legitimate representative of Jews worldwide.\n\nPartisans of the first view are predominantly, though by no means exclusively, secular or less traditional. Partisans of the second view are almost exclusively traditional or Orthodox, although they also include supporters who follow other streams of Judaism or are less traditional but conservative and would not object to a more prominent state role in promoting Jewish beliefs—although not to the point of creating a purely Halachic state.\n\nThe debate is therefore characterized by significant polarities. Secular and religious Zionists argue passionately about what a Jewish state should represent. Post-Zionists and Zionists argue about whether a Jewish state should exist at all. Because Israel was created within the sphere of international law as the instrument for Jewish self-determination, these polarities are captured by the questions: should Israel maintain and strengthen its status as a state for the Jewish people, or transition to being a state purely for \"all of its citizens\", or identify as both? And, if both, how to resolve any tensions that arise from their coexistence. To date, Israel has steered a course between secularism and Jewish identity, usually depending on who controls the Israeli High Court of Justice.\n\nOn 19 November 2008, Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni addressed the United Jewish Communities General Assembly in Jerusalem. In her speech, she announced: \"These two goals of Israel as a Jewish and a democratic state must coexist and not contradict each other. So, what does that mean, a Jewish state? It is not only a matter of the number of Jews who live in Israel. It is not just a matter of numbers but a matter of values. The Jewish state is a matter of values, but it is not just a matter of religion, it is also a matter of nationality. And a Jewish state is not a monopoly of rabbis. It is not. It is about the nature of the State of Israel. It is about Jewish tradition. It is about Jewish history, regardless of the question of what each and every Israeli citizen does in his own home on Saturdays and what he does on the Jewish holidays. We need to maintain the nature of the State of Israel, the character of the State of Israel, because this is the \"raison d'être\" of the State of Israel.\"\n\nAdvocates of Israel becoming a more narrowly Jewish commonwealth face at least the following practical and theoretical difficulties:\n\n\nTheorists who grapple with these issues focus on the future of the State of Israel and realize that although the sovereign political state has been established, there is still much work to be done in relation to the \"identity\" of the state itself.\n\nA poll commissioned by the Israel Democracy Institute in 2007 found that 75% of Arab-Israelis would support a constitution that maintained Israel as a Jewish and democratic state with equal minority rights:\n\nA vast majority of Israeli Arabs would support a constitution that maintained Israel's status as a Jewish and democratic state while guaranteeing equal rights for minorities, according to a poll whose results were published on Sunday 29 April 2007. Among the 507 people who participated in the poll, some 75 percent said they would agree with such a definition while 23 percent said they would oppose it.\n\nThe notion that Israel should be constituted in the name of and maintain a special relationship with a particular group of people, the Jewish people, has drawn much controversy vis-à-vis minority groups living in Israel—the large number of Muslim and Christian Palestinians residing in Israel and, to the extent that those territories are claimed to be governed as part of Israel and not as areas under military occupation, in the West Bank and Gaza. For example, the Israeli National Anthem, Hatikvah, refers to Jews by name as well as alluding to the concept of Zionism, and it contains no mention of Palestinian Arab culture. This anthem therefore excludes non-Jews from its narrative of national identity. Similar criticism has been made of the Israeli flag which resembles the Tallit (a Jewish prayer shawl) and features a Star of David, universally acknowledged as a symbol of Judaism. Critics of Israel as a Jewish state, particularly a nation state, have suggested that it should adopt more inclusive and neutral symbolism.\n\nIn the course of the Cold War, the Soviet Union, its satellite states and agencies, as well as many African, Asian and Arab states, presented the concept of Zionism and the Jewish state as an embodiment of racism, imperialism and colonialism. In 1975, the UN General Assembly Resolution 3379, which equated Zionism with racism, was passed by a vote of 72 to 35. It was partially revoked by UN General Assembly Resolution 4686 in 1991 by a vote of 111 to 25.\n\nLinguist and political commentator Noam Chomsky makes a distinction between the concept of \"a Jewish ethnic homeland in Palestine\" and that of \"a Jewish state\" in his interview on C-SPAN, saying that he has always supported a Jewish ethnic homeland in Palestine, which is different from a Jewish state. He says that there is a strong case to be made for an ethnic homeland, but he has always been opposed to a Jewish state, for the same reasons he would be opposed to \"a Christian state, or a White state, or an Islamic republic\". Chomsky believes the concept of a Jewish State (or Muslim, Christian or White State) directly contradicts the concept of a democratic state as it is understood in the Western tradition, because liberal democracy is founded upon a principle in which there is no privileged citizen.\n\nSome Jewish nationalists base the legitimacy of Israel as a Jewish state on the Balfour Declaration and ancient historical ties to the land, asserting that both play particular roles as evidence under international law, as well as a fear that a hostile Arab world might be disrespectful of a Jewish minority—alleging a variety of possible harms up to and including genocide—were Israel to become a post-national \"state for all its citizens.\" They also note that many European and Asian states such as Republic of Ireland, Germany, Japan, China, Russia, Turkey, Greece, Serbia, and Finland maintain identities based on ethnicity and culture, and often provide simpler immigration procedures to individuals with ethnic ties to them.\n\nTo many Arab and Muslim leaders, following the popular usage in their communities, even referring to Israel by its proper name has political and cultural implications, resulting in use of circumlocutions such as \"the Zionist entity\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34655358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34655358", "title": "L. W. Rogers", "text": "L. W. Rogers\n\nLouis William Rogers (May 28, 1859 – April 18, 1953), commonly known as \"L.W.,\" was an American teacher, railway brakeman, trade union functionary, socialist political activist, and newspaper editor. Rogers is best remembered in this context as one of the key officials of the American Railway Union jailed in conjunction with the Pullman Strike of 1894. After more than two decades in and around the labor movement, Rogers shifted his activity to mysticism as a prominent lecturer, writer, and long-time President of the Theosophical Society in America.\n\nLouis William Rogers was born in the state of Iowa in the Midwestern United States on May 28, 1859. Trained as a teacher, Rogers taught in the public schools of Iowa and Kansas for a period of five years, beginning late in the 1870s.\n\nRogers later went to work as a brakeman, a crew member of a locomotive train who helped regulate the speed through the manual application of brakes. He worked across a number of midwestern railways, including the Kansas City, Springfield & Memphis, the Wabash & Western, the Santa Fe, and the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy. Rogers was fired from his position on the latter road during the Burlington railroad strike of 1888, when he supported the locomotive engineers striking the road. Following his dismissal Rogers toured the Burlington route engaging in public speeches on behalf of the strikers, traveling from Illinois all the way to Colorado on his mission.\n\nLeaving actual railway work after his dismissal from the Burlington & Quincy, Rogers launched his first newspaper, the \"Railroad Patriot\" in St. Joseph, Missouri. The paper proved to be short-lived, terminating publication the following year.\n\nWith his newspaper having folded, in 1889 Rogers moved to the state of Colorado, where he first became active in the Brotherhood of Railroad Brakemen (BRB), known from 1890 as the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen (BRT). He edited two short-lived newspapers in Colorado, the \"Denver Patriot\" and the \"Vona Herald\" as the 1880s came to a close. \n\nIn September 1889, Rogers was chosen as a delegate to the national convention of the BRB, which selected him as editor of the official organ of the union, the \"Railroad Brakemen's Journal.\" He continued in this capacity until the end of 1892.\n\nIn the 1880s Rogers also became a public lecturer on Freethought and its underlying philosophical doctrine of Rationalism.\n\nEarly in the 1890s Rogers returned to the Midwest, moving first to Galesburg, Illinois, then to Chicago, and finally in 1892 to Oshkosh, Wisconsin. There Rogers established a new newspaper, the \"Age of Labor,\" which he published and edited until its 1893 merger with \"The Labor Advocate,\" one of the prominent labor newspapers of the day.\n\nIn 1893 Rogers helped to establish the Wisconsin State Federation of Labor.\n\nAs a veteran trade unionist and railway worker, Rogers found the 1894 establishment of the American Railway Union (ARU) by former Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen official Eugene V. Debs to be irresistible — an attempt to create an industrial union joining workers in the myriad of railway crafts into a centralized and therefore powerful organization. Rogers became active in the ARU, was named to the organization's 7 member Executive Board, and was appointed editor of the organization's weekly newspaper, \"Railway Times.\"\n\nThis position as an ARU executive put Rogers in harm's way, however, as a victim of the process set in motion when the U.S. government sought to end the bitter 1894 Pullman Strike launched by the ARU by means of judicial injunction.\n\nOn July 2, 1894, United States Attorney General Richard Olney and his assistant Edwin Walker instructed Chicago US Attorney Thomas M. Milchrist to file a bill in equity with the combined US District and Circuit Courts summarizing the harm allegedly done to the railroads and to commerce by the ARU strike. District Court Judge Peter S. Grosscup and Circuit Court Judge William A. Woods actively worked with the petitioner to shape and refine the injunction request, which was granted.\n\nThe judges on that same day ordered that 10,000 copies of their newly granted injunction be printed and distributed by federal marshals along the striking railroad lines. The ARU was thereby ordered to cease and desist interfering with or hindering trains on any involved railroad or any train carrying U.S. Mail.\n\nWhen the strike was not terminated two weeks after issuance of the injunction, the government returned to court charging that ARU head Gene Debs, Vice President George W. Howard, Secretary Sylvester Keliher, and Editor Rogers were in contempt of court for failing to abide by the injunction. This July 17 hearing did not actually find the four to be in contempt, but nevertheless presiding judge William H. Seaman ordered the defendants to be temporarily held pending another hearing on July 23. Bail was set at $3,000 each.\n\nRogers and his three ARU associates surrendered to authorities the same afternoon that the so-called \"body attachment order\" was issued. To the surprise of contemporary observers, all four ARU officials waived the right to post bail and were immediately jailed. Rogers later recalled that the substantial amount set for bail was not the cause of this decision, declaring, \"If it was $2, I'd go to jail. This is a mighty test between labor and capital, and we will fight it to the finish.\"\n\nOwing to an indefinite end to the period of incarceration, this decision was quietly reversed on July 25, 1894, when bail was posted and Debs, Rogers and the other ARU leaders freed from the Cook County Jail. Trial was set to begin on September 5.\n\nOn December 14, 1894, fully three months after the trial of the ARU had been held, Judge Woods finally issued a lengthy ruling. Wood found the union and its leaders guilty of having conducted an illegal strike in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.\n\nDebs was sentenced to 6 months in jail as leader of the ARU, while Rogers and the other defendants in the case were sentenced to terms of 3 months. These sentences were not to be served in Chicago's Cook County Jail, but rather in McHenry County Jail in neighboring Woodstock, Illinois. These sentences were served, starting in June 1895, with Rogers and the other 5 members of the ARU Executive Board gaining their release on August 22. Debs was released three months later. Additional civil penalties were assessed against the union.\n\nUpon his release, the ARU having been effectively crushed in the failed Pullman strike, Rogers moved to Pueblo, Colorado, where he worked as an organizer for the American Federation of Labor. He also edited yet another labor newspaper in 1896, the \"Industrial Advocate.\"\n\nWith the launch of the Social Democratic Party of America in 1897, an organization springing in large part from activists loyal to Gene Debs and his ARU, Rogers became involved in the affairs of that organization. He returned to Chicago to edit the new political party's official organ, \"The Social Democrat\" for a time, and helped to manage the massive speaking tours of Debs, one of the renowned orators of the day, for the next two years.\n\nWhile remaining involved in socialist politics, Rogers remained a participant in the economic labor movement as well, serving as President of the Michigan Federation of Labor from 1898 to 1899.\n\nIn the 20th Century, Rogers turned his attention to a new interest, mysticism and theosophy. In 1903 Rogers joined the Theosophical Society in America (TSA). Rogers was soon absorbed by the Theosophical movement, lecturing extensively and publishing numerous books and pamphlets on reincarnation, life after death, karma, and sundry matters of philosophical idealism.\n\nAs one of the most prominent American exponents of esoteric mysticism, Rogers would be elected Vice President of the TSA in 1918, serving in that capacity until 1920, when he would ascend to the Presidency of that organization. Rogers would remain as President of the Theosophical Society for more than a decade, standing down in 1931.\n\nFollowing his time at the helm of the TSA, Rogers served as the editor of two of the organization's periodicals — \"Ancient Wisdom,\" which he edited from 1935 to 1936, and \"The Voice,\" from 1951 to 1952.\n\nLouis Rogers died on April 18, 1953 in Santa Barbara, California.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "647722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=647722", "title": "Master of Divinity", "text": "Master of Divinity\n\nIn the academic study of theology, the Master of Divinity (MDiv, \"magister divinitatis\" in Latin) is the first professional degree of the pastoral profession in North America. It is the most common academic degree in seminaries and divinity schools (e.g. in 2014 nearly 44% of all US students in schools accredited by the Association of Theological Schools were enrolled in an MDiv program). In many Christian denominations and in some other religions the degree is the standard prerequisite for ordination to the priesthood or pastorship or other appointment, ordination or licensing to professional ministry. At accredited seminaries in the United States this degree requires between 72 and 106 credit hours of study (72 being the minimum determined by academic accrediting agencies and 106 being on the upper end of certain schools that wish to ensure a broader study of the related disciplines).\n\nChristian MDiv programs generally include studies in Christian ministry and theology. In 1996 the Association of Theological Schools established the standard that all accredited MDiv programs should include the following four content areas: Religious Heritage, Cultural Context, Personal and Spiritual Formation, and Capacity for Ministerial and Public Leadership. Coursework usually includes studies in New Testament Greek, theology, philosophy, church history, pastoral theology, Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), and New Testament studies. Many programs also contain courses in church growth, ecclesiology, evangelism, systematic theology, Christian education, liturgical studies, Latin, Hebrew, canon law, and patristics. The degree may or may not include a thesis.\n\nThe MDiv is a requirement for ordination in many denominations. For example, the United Methodist Church, one of the largest Protestant Christian denominations in the US, whose students in 2014 made up 9% of all MDiv students enrolled in schools accredited by the Association of Theological Schools, requires candidates for ordination as elder to earn an MDiv and requires candidates for ordination as deacon to earn either an MDiv or a master's degree in another field with additional theological studies.\n\nThe Master of Divinity has replaced the Bachelor of Divinity in most United States seminaries as the first professional degree, since the former title implied in the American academic system that it was on a par with a Bachelor of Arts or other basic undergraduate education even though a bachelor's degree previously was and remains a prerequisite for entrance into graduate divinity programs. The Commission on Accrediting of the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada accredits most Christian schools in North America and approves the degree programs they offer, including the MDiv.\n\nThe MDiv is a significantly more extensive program than most taught (as opposed to research-based) master's degrees. In the United States the degree usually consists on average of 90 semester hours, as opposed to the usual 36 or 48. Ordination in most mainline Protestant denominations and the Roman Catholic Church thus requires seven or eight years of education past high school: the first four in undergraduate studies leading to a bachelor's degree (which may or may not be in a related field) and then three or four years of seminary or divinity school education leading to the MDiv.\n\nThe MDiv stands in contrast to the Master of Arts (MA) in theology and Master of Theological Studies (MTS), the usual academic degrees in the subject (which tend not to include \"pastoral\" or \"practical\" courses), and the Bachelor of Sacred Theology (STB), Licentiate in Sacred Theology (STL), Master of Theology (MTh), Master of Sacred Theology (STM), and Master of Religion (MRel), which are also academic degrees. Schools with Pontifical faculties in North America often award both the MDiv and STB at the same time after a three-year period of graduate studies.\n\nAlthough in 2014 women made up approximately 53% of all students enrolled in ministerial non-MDiv degree programs at US schools accredited by the Association of Theological Schools, they constituted only approximately 29% of all MDiv students in the same schools in that year. The group with the most parity in MDiv enrollment numbers between men and women at those schools in that time period were African American students, among whom enrollment numbers were almost equal between genders.\n\nFor the 2014–2015 academic year the average cost per year for MDiv tuition and fees at a school accredited by the Association of Theological Schools was $14,673.50 in the US and $9,493.25 in Canada.\n\n"}

He stated that \"to learn about religion we have to come to our senses. Literally.

In their editorial statement, the editors described it as \"a new project in the study of religious images, objects, spaces, and material practices.\"\n\nThe anthropologist Simon Coleman suggested that the term \"material religion\" was tautological, in that \"religion is inherently material in its very constitution.\"\n\nThe scholars of religion Christopher R.

{"id": "806532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=806532", "title": "Moleosophy", "text": "Moleosophy\n\nMoleosophy or moleomancy is a technique of divination and fortune telling based upon the observation and interpretation of bodily marks — primarily those of the \"melanocytic nevus\" condition (i.e. moles).\n\nAlthough divination by moles, birthmarks and blemishes has been practiced in many societies throughout history, it has never achieved the status of dream divination, astrology, or even palmistry. As such, it has generally been classed a species of superstition or folklore, rather than a pseudo-science.\n\nDespite a cultural predeliction for physiognomy, which developed in a considerable literature, mole divination was not a major feature of Greco-Roman culture, and references to the practice are rare. Birthmarks enjoyed a somewhat higher status, and are mentioned. Seleucus I Nicator, the first Macedonian king of Syria, was said to have received from Apollo an anchor-shaped birthmark on his thigh, which was also borne by his descendants.\n\nA short Greek manual of mole interpretation survives from antiquity, appended to the end of a much longer work on divination by twitches ascribed to the legendary Greek seer Melampus. Although the treatise on moles lacks an author, and differs in style from the work on twitches, it is customarily also referred to as by pseudo-Melampus. The text is titled \"Peri Elaion tou Somatos\" \"On the Olives of the Body,\" the term presumably being applied to moles because of their similarity in shape and color. There are indications, however, that the text also covers birthmarks, as \"fiery\" red \"olives\" are mentioned.\n\nIn general, the work relies on fairly straightforward analogical association. A mark on the back of the throat portends beheading. One on the lips portends overeating. A mark on the nose—which the Greeks like many other cultures associated with the privates—portends the recipient will be \"insatiate in lovemaking.\" Some distinctions are made between men and women, left and right.\n\nA later Turkish translation of the Ps-Melampus text, ascribed to \"Leo the Wise,\" was translated into French by Jean Nicolaides (\"Les Livres de Divination Traduits sur un Manuscrit Turc Inédit\", 1889).\n\n"}

{"id": "4251353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4251353", "title": "Religion in North Korea", "text": "Religion in North Korea\n\nThere are no known official statistics of religions in North Korea. Based on estimates from the late 1990s and the 2000s, North Korea is mostly irreligious, with the religious life dominated by the traditions of Korean shamanism and Chondoism. There are small communities of Buddhists and Christians. Chondoism is represented in politics by the Party of the Young Friends of the Heavenly Way, and is regarded by the government as Korea's \"national religion\" because of its identity as a \"minjung\" (popular) and \"revolutionary anti-imperialist\" movement.\n\nIn ancient times, most Koreans believed in their indigenous religion socially guided by \"mu\" (shamans). Buddhism was introduced from the Chinese Former Qin state in 372 to the northern Korean state of Goguryeo, and developed into distinctive Korean forms. At that time, the Korean peninsula was divided into three kingdoms: the aforementioned Goguryeo in the north, Baekje in the southwest, and Silla in the southeast. Buddhism reached Silla only in the 5th century, but it was made the state religion only in that kingdom in the year 552. In Goguryeo the Korean indigenous religion remained dominant, while Buddhism became more widespread in Silla and Baekje (both areas comprehended in modern South Korea).\n\nIn the following unified state of Goryeo (918–1392), that developed from Goguryeo incorporating the southern kingdoms, Buddhism flourished even becoming a political force. In the same period, the influence of Chinese Confucianism penetrated the country and led to the formation of Korean Confucianism that would have become the state ideology and religion of the following Joseon state.\n\nThe Joseon kingdom (1392–1910), strictly Neo-Confucian, harshly suppressed Korean Buddhism and Korean shamanism. Buddhist monasteries were destroyed and their number dropped from several hundreds to a mere thirty-six; Buddhism was eradicated from the life of towns as monks and nuns were prohibited from entering them and were marginalised to the mountains. These restrictions lasted until the 19th century.\nIn this environment, Christianity began to rapidly gain foothold since the late 18th century, due to an intense missionary activity that was aided by the endorsement at first by the \"Silhak\" and \"Seohak\" intellectual parties, and then at the end of the following century by the king of Korea himself and the intellectual elite of the crumbling Joseon state, who were looking for a new social factor to invigorate the Korean nation. In the late 19th century, the Joseon state was politically and culturally collapsing. The intelligentsia was looking for solutions to invigorate and transform the nation. It was in this critical period that they came into contact with Western Protestant missionaries who offered a solution to the plight of Koreans. Christian communities already existed in Joseon, however it was only by the 1880s that the government allowed a large number of Western missionaries to enter the country. Protestant missionaries set up schools, hospitals and publishing agencies. The king of Korea and his family tacitly supported Christianity. From the late nineteenth century, the northwest of Korea, and Pyongyang in particular, became a stronghold of Christianity. As a result, Pyongyang was called the \"Jerusalem of the East\".\n\nAt the dawn of the 20th century, almost the totality of the population of Korea believed in the indigenous shamanic religion and practiced Confucian rites and ancestral worship. Korean Buddhism was nearly dead, reduced to a tiny and weak minority of monks, despite its long history and cultural influence, because of 500 years of suppression by the ruling Neo-Confucian Joseon kingdom, which also disregarded traditional cults.\n\nDuring the absorption of Korea into the Japanese Empire (1910–1945) the already formed link of Christianity with Korean nationalism was strengthened, as the Japanese tried to impose State Shinto and Christians refused to take part in Shinto rituals. At the same time, numerous religious movements that since the 19th century had been trying to reform the Korean indigenous religion, notably Chondoism, flourished. Christianity became widespread especially in the north of the peninsula, as did Chondoism which aimed to counter Christian influence.\n\nThe Korean peninsula was divided into two states in 1945, the communist north and the anti-communist south. Most of the Korean Christians, that had been until then in the northern half of the peninsula, fled to South Korea. By contrast, most of Korean Chondoists remained in the newly formed North Korea. At the time of the partition they were 1.5 million, or 16% of North Korea's population. They participate to the politics of North Korea through the Party of the Young Friends of the Heavenly Way. In 1994 the Central Guidance Committee of the Korean Chondoist Association organised an impressive ceremony at the newly constructed Mausoleum of Dangun (mythical founder of the Korean nation) near Pyongyang.\n\nAccording to some estimates in 2005 in North Korea there are 3,846,000 (16% of the total population) believers of Korean shamanism, 3,245,000 (13.5%) Chondoists, 1,082,000 (4.5%) Buddhists, and 406,000 (1.7%) Christians.\n\nIn 2007 there were approximately 800 Chondoist churches throughout the country and a large central building in Pyongyang, 60 Buddhist temples (maintained more as cultural relics than places of worship), and 5 Christian churches—three Protestant churches, one Catholic church, and one Russian Orthodox church, all of which located in Pyongyang.\n\nIn 2014, the Korea Conference of Religions for Peace held an inter-Korean meeting at Mount Kumgang, North Korea, and another is planned in 2017 in Pyongyang.\n\nDifferent official attitudes toward organized religion are reflected in various constitutions. Article 14 of the 1948 constitution noted that \"\"citizens of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea shall have the freedom of religious belief and of conducting religious services\". Article 54 of the 1972 constitution stated that \"citizens have religious liberty and the freedom to oppose religion.\" Some observers argued that the change occurred because in 1972 the political authorities no longer needed the support of the much-weakened organized religions. In the 1992 constitution, Article 68 grants freedom of religious belief and guarantees the right to construct buildings for religious use and religious ceremonies. The article also states that \"no one may use religion as a means by which to drag in foreign powers or to destroy the state or social order\"\". North Korea has been represented at international religious conferences by state-sponsored religious organizations such as the Korean Buddhist Federation, the Korean Christian Federation, and the Chondoist Church and Chondoist Party.\n\nThis cult of the Kims, together with the doctrine of \"Juche\" (self-reliance) are said by some to have religious overtones. Juche appeared in the 1960s as an idea of national autonomy but it has developed universal characters. The doctrine proclaims that human beings should break free of any dependency on spiritual ideas and realize that, working together, they can achieve all their goals without supernatural assistance. It promises believers that, through joining the Juche community, they can overcome death and become immortals. According to the Juche teachings, human beings only exist in social contexts. There is no human that is utterly alone, who has no relationships or interactions with other humans. Human beings will continue to exist even after physical death only if the society that defines them continues to exist.\n\nSome scholars see Juche as having Confucian features, but without the Confucian ancestral kinship structuration of society. Rather, Juche's aim is a national community. Moreover, Juche has as its spiritual focus the mythified figure of Kim Il-sung. He gained mythical connotations already in the 1930s for his heroic actions against the Japanese occupators. In Juche writings, Kim Il-sung and his successors are at times portrayed as divine beings. In addition, the North Korean Juche calendar counts the years starting from the birth of Kim Il-sung in 1912.\n\nOther studies see Christian influences in Juche. Between 1989 and 1992, discussions about unification and compatibility of Juche and Christianity took place between North Korean, South Korean and Korean American theologians. Park Seung-deok, a Juche scholar from Pyongyang, concluded that Juche and Christianity share common goals and values.\n\nIt is very difficult for outside observers to know what has happened to North Korean religious bodies over the past 60 years due to the extreme isolation of the state. One interpretation has held that all open religious activity in North Korea was persecuted and eradicated after Kim Il-sung took power, only to be revived in the present as part of a political show. Another interpretation has held that religion survived and has genuinely been revived in the past few decades.\n\nKim Il-sung criticized religion in his writings, and North Korean propaganda in literature, movies and other media have presented religion in a negative light. Kim Il-sung's attack on religion was strongly based on the idea that religion had been used as a tool for imperialists in the Korean peninsula. He criticized Christians for collaborating with the United Nations' forces against him during the Korean War, although he praised Christians who supported him.\n\nAccounts from the Korean War speak of harsh persecution of religion by Kim Il-sung in the areas he controlled. Prior to the war, the Christian population of the Korean peninsula was most heavily concentrated in the north; during the war, many of these Christians fled to the South. Some interpretations have considered that the Christian community was often of a higher socio-economic class than the rest of the population, which may have prompted its departure for fear of persecution. The large-scale destruction caused by the massive air raids and the suffering experienced by North Koreans during the Korean War helped foster hatred of Christianity as being the American religion.\n\nReligion was attacked in the ensuing years as an obstacle to the construction of communism, and many people abandoned their former religions in order to conform to the new reality. On the basis of accounts from the Korean War as well as information from defectors, an interpretation has held that the North Korea was the only state in the world to have completely eradicated religion by the 1960s. Buddhism was thought to have been eradicated, under this interpretation and its reappearance later was thought to be a show. The Federation of Korean Christians in North Korea (created in 1970), under this interpretation, has been considered a fake organization meant to present a favourable image to the outside world.\n\nOther interpretations have thought that they do represent genuine faith communities that survived the persecutions. An interpretation has considered that these religious communities may have been believers who genuinely adhered to Marxism–Leninism and the leadership of Kim Il-sung, thus ensuring their survival. This interpretation has been supported by recent evidence gathered that has shown that the North Korean government may have tolerated the existence of up to 200 pro-communist Christian congregations during the 1960s, and by the fact that several high-ranking people in the government were Christians and they were buried with high honours (for instance Kang Yang Wook was a Presbyterian minister who served as vice president of North Korea from 1972 to 1982, and Kim Chang Jun was a Methodist minister who served as vice chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly). Differing interpretations often agree on the disappearance of religion under Kim Il-sung in the first few decades of his rule. The government never made an open public policy statement about religion, leading to unresolved speculation among scholars as to what exactly the government's position was at any point in time.\n\nChondoism (천도교 \"Ch'ŏndogyo\") or Cheondoism (South Korean spelling) is a religion with roots in Confucianised indigenous shamanism. It is the religious dimension of the \"Donghak\" (\"Eastern Learning\") movement that was founded by Choe Je-u (1824–1864), a member of an impoverished yangban (aristocratic) family, in 1860 as a counter-force to the rise of \"foreign religions\", which in his view included Buddhism and Christianity (part of \"Seohak\", the wave of Western influence that penetrated Korean life at the end of the 19th century). Choe Je-u founded Chondoism after having been allegedly healed from illness by an experience of \"Sangje\" or \"Haneullim\", the god of the universal Heaven in traditional shamanism.\n\nThe Donghak movement became so influential among common people that in 1864 the Joseon government sentenced Choe Je-u to death. The movement grew and in 1894 the members gave rise to the Donghak Peasant Revolution against the royal government. With the division of Korea in 1945, most of the Chondoist community remained in the north, where the majority of them dwelled.\n\nChondoism is the sole religion to be favoured by the North Korean government. It has political representation as the Party of the Young Friends of the Heavenly Way, and is regarded by the government as Korea's \"national religion\" because of its identity as a \"minjung\" (popular) and \"revolutionary anti-imperialist\" movement.\n\nKorean shamanism, also known as \"Muism\" (무교 \"Mugyo\", \"\"mu\" [shaman] religion\") or \"Sinism\" (신교 \"Singyo\", \"religion of the \"shin\" () [gods]\"), is the ethnic religion of Korea and the Koreans. Although used synonymously, the two terms aren't identical: Jung Young Lee describes Muism as a form of Sinism – the shamanic tradition within the religion. Other names for the religion are \"Sindo\" (신도 \"Way of the Gods\") or \"Sindoism\" (신도교 \"Sindogyo\", \"religion of the Way of the Gods\").\n\nIn contemporary Korean language the shaman-priest or \"mu\" () is known as a \"mudang\" ( ) if female or \"baksu\" if male, although other names and locutions are used. Korean \"mu\" \"shaman\" is synonymous with Chinese \"wu\", which defines priests both male and female. The role of the \"mudang\" is to act as intermediary between the spirits or gods, and the human plain, through \"gut\" (rituals), seeking to resolve problems in the patterns of development of human life.\n\nCentral to the faith is the belief in \"Haneullim\" or \"Hwanin\", meaning \"source of all being\", and of all gods of nature, the utmost god or the supreme mind. The \"mu\" are mythically described as descendants of the \"Heavenly King\", son of the \"Holy Mother [of the Heavenly King]\", with investiture often passed down through female princely lineage. However, other myths link the heritage of the traditional faith to Dangun, male son of the Heavenly King and initiator of the Korean nation.\n\nKorean Muism has similarities with Chinese Wuism, Japanese Shinto, and with the Siberian, Mongolian, and Manchurian religious traditions. As highlighted by anthropological studies, the Korean ancestral god Dangun is related to the Ural-Altaic Tengri \"Heaven\", the shaman and the prince. The \"mudang\" is similar to the Japanese \"miko\" and the Ryukyuan \"yuta\". Muism has exerted an influence on some Korean new religions, such as Chondoism in North Korea. According to various sociological studies, many Christian churches in Korea make use of practices rooted in shamanism as the Korean shamanic theology has affinity to that of Christianity.\n\nIn the 1890s, the twilight years of the Joseon kingdom, Protestant missionaries gained significant influence, and led a demonisation of the traditional religion through the press, and even carried out campaigns of physical suppression of local cults. The Protestant discourse would have had an influence on all further attempts to uproot Muism.\n\nThere is no knowledge about the survival of Korean shamanism in contemporary North Korea. Many northern shamans, displaced by war and politics, migrated to South Korea. Shamans in North Korea were (or are) of the same type of those of northern and central areas of South Korea (\"kangshinmu\").\n\nBuddhism (불교 \"Pulgyo\") entered Korea from China during the period of the three kingdoms (372, or the 4th century). Buddhism was the dominant religious and cultural influence in the Silla (668–935) and subsequent Goryeo (918–1392) states. Confucianism was also brought to Korea from China in early centuries, and was formulated as Korean Confucianism in Goryeo. However, it was only in the subsequent Joseon kingdom (1392–1910) that Korean Confucianism was established as the state ideology and religion, and Korean Buddhism underwent 500 years of suppression, from which it began to recover only in the 20th century.\n\nBuddhists are a minority in North Korea, and their traditions have developed differently from those of South Korean Buddhists after the division of the country. Buddhism in North Korea is practiced under the auspices of the official Korea Buddhist Federation, an organ of the North Korean state apparatus. North Korean Buddhist monks are entirely dependent on state wages for their livelihood as well as state authorization to practice. As of 2009, the leader of the Korean Buddhist Federation is Yu Yong-sun.\n\nThere are only 60 Buddhist temples in the country, and they are viewed as cultural relics from Korea's past rather than places of active worship. Also, there is a three-year college for training Buddhist clergy. A limited revival of Buddhism is apparently taking place. This includes the establishment of an academy for Buddhist studies and the publication of a twenty-five-volume translation of the Korean Tripitaka, or Buddhist scriptures, which had been carved on 80,000 wooden blocks and kept at the temple at Myohyangsan in central North Korea. Recently, South Korean Buddhist leaders have been allowed to travel to North Korea and participate in religious ceremonies or give aid to civilians.\n\nChristianity () became very popular in northern Korea from the late 18th century to the 19th century. The first Catholic missionaries arrived in 1794, a decade after the return of Yi Sung-hun, a diplomat who was the first baptised Korean in Beijing. He established a grassroots lay Catholic movement in the peninsula. However, the writings of the Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci, who was resident at the imperial court in Beijing, had been already brought to Korea from China in the 17th century. Scholars of the \"Silhak\" (\"Practical Learning\"), were attracted to Catholic doctrines, and this was a key factor for the spread of the Catholic faith in the 1790s. The penetration of Western ideas and Christianity in Korea became known as \"Seohak\" (\"Western Learning\"). A study of 1801 found that more than half of the families that had converted to Catholicism were linked to the Silhak school. Largely because converts refused to perform Confucian ancestral rituals, the Joseon government prohibited the proselytisation of Christianity. Some Catholics were executed during the early 19th century, but the restrictive law was not strictly enforced.\n\nProtestant missionaries entered Korea during the 1880s and, along with Catholic priests, converted a remarkable number of Koreans this time with the tacit support of the royal government. Methodist and Presbyterian missionaries were especially successful. They established schools, universities, hospitals, and orphanages and played a significant role in the modernisation of the country. During the Japanese colonial occupation, Christians were in the front ranks of the struggle for independence. Factors contributing to the growth of Catholicism and Protestantism included the decayed state of Korean Buddhism, the support of the intellectual elite, and the encouragement of self-support and self-government among members of the Korean church, and finally the identification of Christianity with Korean nationalism.\n\nA large number of Christians lived in the northern half of the peninsula (it was part of the so-called \"Manchurian revival\") where Confucian influence was not as strong as in the south. Before 1948 Pyongyang was an important Christian center: The city was known as the \"Jerusalem of the East\".\n\nMany Korean Communists came from a Christian background. Kim Il-sung's mother was a Presbyterian deaconess. He attended a mission school and played the organ in church. In his memoir \"With the Century\" he wrote: \"I do not think the spirit of Christianity that preaches universal peace and harmony contradicts my idea advocating an independent life for man\". In 1945, with the establishment of the communist regime in the north, however, most Christians fled to South Korea to escape persecution. Christianity came to be discouraged by the North Korean government because of its association with America.\n\nIn the 1980s, North Korea produced its own translation of the Bible, which has since been used by Southern missionaries attempting to evangelize the North. By the late 1980s, it became apparent that Christians were active in the governmental elite. In those years three new churches, two Protestant and one Catholic, were opened in Pyongyang.\n\nOther signs of the regime's changing attitude towards Christianity included holding the \"International Seminar of Christians of the North and South for the Peace and Reunification of Korea\" in Switzerland in 1988, allowing papal representatives to attend the opening of the Changchung Cathedral of Pyongyang in that same year, and sending two North Korean novice priests to study in Rome. A Protestant seminary in Pyongyang taught future leaders of the North Korean government. A new association of Roman Catholics was established in June 1988. A North Korean Protestant pastor reported at a 1989 meeting of the National Council of Churches in Washington that his country has 10,000 Protestants and 1,000 Catholics who worship in 500 home churches. In 1992 and 1994, American evangelist Billy Graham visited North Korea. He met Kim Il-sung, giving him a Bible, and preached at Kim Il-sung University. In 2008, his son Franklin Graham visited the country.In 1991, North Korea even tried to invite the pope in an attempt to escape international isolation, but eventually dropped the idea.\n\nNorth Korean Christians are officially represented by the Korean Christian Federation, a state-controlled body responsible for contacts with churches and governments abroad. In Pyongyang there are five church buildings: the Catholic Changchung Cathedral, three Protestant churches inaugurated in 1988 in presence of South Korean church officials, and a Russian Orthodox church consecrated in 2006.\n\nThe internationally supported Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, which opened in 2010, operates with a Christian ethos. Christian aid groups, including the American Friends Service Committee, the Eugene Bell Foundation, and World Vision, are able to operate in the country, but not allowed to proselytize.\n\nIn 2016, Christmas was celebrated in North Korea, but with the religious overtones downplayed. \n\nAccording to Open Doors, North Korea is the country where Christians are persecuted the most.\n\nThere is a mosque in the Iranian embassy in Pyongyang called Ar-Rahman Mosque, the only mosque in the country. The mosque was likely built for the embassy staff, but visits by other foreigners are deemed possible, too. Every Friday prayers, most Muslims would pray at Ar-Rahman Mosque regardless of their differences in sect.\n\n\n\n"}

(TV series)\n\nRev. is a British television sitcom produced by Big Talk Productions. The show premiered on BBC Two on 28 June 2010 and ended on 28 April 2014. The show's working titles were \"The City Vicar\" and \"Handle with Prayer\". The series revolves around a Church of England priest, played by Tom Hollander, who becomes the vicar of an inner-city London church after leaving a small rural Suffolk parish.\n\nHollander said: \"we wanted to define ourselves in opposition to the cliché of a country vicar, partly because we wanted to depict England as it is \"now\", rather than having a sort of bucolic-y, \"over the hills and far away\", bird-tweeting England – we wanted the complications of the multi-cultural, multi-ethnic inner-city, where everything is much harder.\"\n\nThe Reverend Adam Smallbone is an Anglican priest who has recently moved from a small rural parish to the \"socially disunited\" St Saviour in the Marshes in Hackney, East London. Unable to turn anyone away from his pastoral care, Smallbone is faced with a series of moral challenges as he balances the needs of genuine believers, people on the streets, and drug addicts, as well as the demands of social climbers using the church to get their children into the best schools.\n\nAdam has an impossibly difficult job being a modern city vicar. His wife Alex, who has her own career as a solicitor to worry about, provides fantastic support for him, seeing through his life as a priest, whilst not being involved with his work. He is also supported by lay reader Nigel, who believes he should be running the church. In supervision is Archdeacon Robert, who puts pressure on Adam to increase the congregation and church income.\n\nParishioners include Colin, a heavy drinking, unemployable lost soul who is Adam's most devoted parishioner; Adoha, well known for her romantic intentions towards the clergy; and Mick, who is homeless and appears on Adam's doorstep in different situations asking for money.\n\nInterviewed in late April 2014, Tom Hollander has said that he did not know whether there would be a fourth series, and that after the third series \"we all want to just pause\". He added that \"The idea of not doing it any more is sad but also quite attractive, because you wouldn't want for it to ever get worse.\"\n\n\n\nSix episodes were produced for the first series by Big Talk Productions for BBC Two. The show was created by Tom Hollander and James Wood. The church scenes were filmed at St Leonard's in Shoreditch, east London. The BBC Two comedy was renewed by the BBC in September 2010 and filming began again in the middle months of 2011, with the second series of seven episodes premiering on 10 November 2011. On 1 August 2012, the show was renewed for a third series of six episodes to air in 2014.\n\nRichard Coles, a Church of England priest and former member of the pop group The Communards, advised the show's writers and has been cited as an inspiration for the Adam Smallbone character.\n\nThe six episodes of Series 3 commenced filming on 31 October 2013 and premiered on 24 March 2014.\n\nThe series was commended by \"The Independent\" as intelligent comedy, with Hollander \"as good as ever\" and a strong support cast.\n\nIn 2011, \"Rev.\" won the South Bank Award for best comedy and was nominated for the Royal Television Society Programme Awards for best scripted comedy and best comedy performance (Hollander). The series also won best sitcom at the 2011 British Academy Television Awards.\n\nIt is BBC2's highest rated sitcom and has sold to 140 countries.\n\n2 Entertain released the complete first series on DVD on 21 November 2011.\n\nThe second series was released on 19 November 2012. A boxset containing the first two series was also released.\n\nThe third series was released on 5 May 2014, a week after transmission of the final episode. A boxset containing the first three series was also released.\n\n"}

{"id": "45660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45660", "title": "Swami Vivekananda", "text": "Swami Vivekananda\n\nSwami Vivekananda (; 12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta (), was an Indian Hindu monk, a chief disciple of the 19th-century Indian mystic Ramakrishna. He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century. He was a major force in the revival of Hinduism in India, and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India. Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission. He is perhaps best known for his speech which began, \"Sisters and brothers of America ...,\" in which he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893.\n\nBorn into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family of Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined towards spirituality. He was influenced by his guru, Ramakrishna, from whom he learnt that all living beings were an embodiment of the divine self; therefore, service to God could be rendered by service to mankind. After Ramakrishna's death, Vivekananda toured the Indian subcontinent extensively and acquired first-hand knowledge of the conditions prevailing in British India. He later travelled to the United States, representing India at the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions. Vivekananda conducted hundreds of public and private lectures and classes, disseminating tenets of Hindu philosophy in the United States, England and Europe. In India, Vivekananda is regarded as a patriotic saint and his birthday is celebrated there as National Youth Day.\n\nVivekananda was born Narendranath Datta (shortened to Narendra or Naren) in a Bengali Kayastha family at his ancestral home at 3 Gourmohan Mukherjee Street in Calcutta, the capital of British India, on 12 January 1863 during the Makar Sankranti festival. He belonged to a traditional family and was one of nine siblings. His father, Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney at the Calcutta High Court. Durgacharan Datta, Narendra's grandfather was a Sanskrit and Persian scholar who left his family and became a monk at age twenty-five. His mother, Bhubaneswari Devi, was a devout housewife. The progressive, rational attitude of Narendra's father and the religious temperament of his mother helped shape his thinking and personality.\n\nNarendranath was interested in spirituality from a young age and used to meditate before the images of deities such as Shiva, Rama, Sita, and Mahavir Hanuman. He was fascinated by wandering ascetics and monks. Naren was naughty and restless as a child, and his parents often had difficulty controlling him. His mother said, \"I prayed to Shiva for a son and he has sent me one of his ghosts\".\n\nIn 1871, at the age of eight, Narendranath enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan Institution, where he went to school until his family moved to Raipur in 1877. In 1879, after his family's return to Calcutta, he was the only student to receive first-division marks in the Presidency College entrance examination. He was an avid reader in a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, religion, history, social science, art and literature. He was also interested in Hindu scriptures, including the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the \"Ramayana\", the \"Mahabharata\" and the Puranas. Narendra was trained in Indian classical music, and regularly participated in physical exercise, sports and organised activities. Narendra studied Western logic, Western philosophy and European history at the General Assembly's Institution (now known as the Scottish Church College). In 1881 he passed the Fine Arts examination, and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1884. Narendra studied the works of David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Baruch Spinoza, Georg W. F. Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer, Auguste Comte, John Stuart Mill and Charles Darwin. He became fascinated with the evolutionism of Herbert Spencer and corresponded with him, translating Spencer's book \"Education\" (1861) into Bengali. While studying Western philosophers, he also learned Sanskrit scriptures and Bengali literature. \n\nWilliam Hastie (principal of Christian College, Calcutta, from where Narendra graduated) wrote, \"Narendra is really a genius. I have travelled far and wide but I have never come across a lad of his talents and possibilities, even in German universities, among philosophical students. He is bound to make his mark in life\".\n\nNarendra was known for his prodigious memory and the ability at speed reading. Several incidents have been given as examples. In a talk, he once quoted verbatim, two or three pages from Pickwick Papers. Another incident that is given is his argument with a Swedish national where he gave reference to some details on Swedish history that the Swede originally disagreed with but later conceded. In another incident with Dr.Paul Deussen's at Kiel in Germany, Vivekananda was going over some poetical work and did not reply when the professor spoke to him. Later, he apologized to Dr.Deussen explaining that he was too absorbed in reading and hence did not hear him. The professor was not satisfied with this explanation but Vivekananda quoted and interpreted verses from the text leaving the professor dumbfounded about his feat of memory. Once, he requested some books written by Sir John Lubbock from a library and returned them the very next day claiming that he had read them. The librarian refused to believe him until cross examination about the contents convinced him that Vivekananda was being truthful.\n\nSome accounts have called Narendra a \"shrutidhara\" (a person with a prodigious memory).\n\nIn 1880 Narendra joined Keshab Chandra Sen's \"Nava Vidhan\", which was established by Sen after meeting Ramakrishna and reconverting from Christianity to Hinduism. Narendra became a member of a Freemasonry lodge \"at some point before 1884\" and of the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in his twenties, a breakaway faction of the Brahmo Samaj led by Keshab Chandra Sen and Debendranath Tagore. From 1881 to 1884 he was also active in Sen's Band of Hope, which tried to discourage youths from smoking and drinking.\n\nIt was in this cultic milieu that Narendra became acquainted with Western esotericism. His initial beliefs were shaped by Brahmo concepts, which included belief in a formless God and the deprecation of idolatry, and a \"streamlined, rationalized, monotheistic theology strongly coloured by a selective and modernistic reading of the \"Upanisads\" and of the Vedanta.\" Rammohan Roy, the founder of the Brahmo Samaj who was strongly influenced by unitarianism, strived toward an universalistic interpretation of Hinduism. His ideas were \"altered [...] considerably\" by Debendranath Tagore, who had a romantic approach to the development of these new doctrines, and questioned central Hindu beliefs like reincarnation and karma, and rejected the authority of the \"Vedas\". Tagore also brought this \"neo-Hinduism\" closer in line with western esotericism, a development which was furthered by Keshubchandra Sen. Sen was influenced by transcendentalism, an American philosophical-religious movement strongly connected with unitarianism, which emphasised personal religious experience over mere reasoning and theology. Sen strived to \"an accessible, non-renunciatory, everyman type of spirituality\", introducing \"lay systems of spiritual practice\" which can be regarded as prototypes of the kind of Yoga-exercises which Vivekananda popularised in the west.\n\nThe same search for direct intuition and understanding can be seen with Vivekananda. Not satisfied with his knowledge of philosophy, Narendra came to \"the question which marked the real beginning of his intellectual quest for God.\" He asked several prominent Calcutta residents if they had come \"face to face with God\", but none of their answers satisfied him. At this time, Narendra met Debendranath Tagore (the leader of Brahmo Samaj) and asked if he had seen God. Instead of answering his question, Tagore said \"My boy, you have the \"Yogi\"s eyes.\" According to Banhatti, it was Ramakrishna who really answered Narendra's question, by saying \"Yes, I see Him as I see you, only in an infinitely intenser sense.\" Nevertheless, Vivekananda was more influenced by the Brahmo Samaj's and its new ideas, than by Ramakrishna. It was Sen's influence who brought Vivekananda fully into contact with western esotericism, and it was also via Sen that he met Ramakrishna.\n\nIn 1881 Narendra first met Ramakrishna, who became his spiritual focus after his own father had died in 1884.\n\nNarendra's first introduction to Ramakrishna occurred in a literature class at General Assembly's Institution when he heard Professor William Hastie lecturing on William Wordsworth's poem, \"The Excursion\". While explaining the word \"trance\" in the poem, Hastie suggested that his students visit Ramakrishna of Dakshineswar to understand the true meaning of trance. This prompted some of his students (including Narendra) to visit Ramakrishna.\nThey probably first met personally in November 1881, though Narendra did not consider this their first meeting, and neither man mentioned this meeting later. At this time Narendra was preparing for his upcoming F. A. examination, when Ram Chandra Datta accompanied him to Surendra Nath Mitra's, house where Ramakrishna was invited to deliver a lecture. According to Paranjape, at this meeting Ramakrishna asked young Narendra to sing. Impressed by his singing talent, he asked Narendra to come to Dakshineshwar.\n\nIn late 1881 or early 1882, Narendra went to Dakshineswar with two friends and met Ramakrishna. This meeting proved to be a turning point in his life. Although he did not initially accept Ramakrishna as his teacher and rebelled against his ideas, he was attracted by his personality and began to frequently visit him at Dakshineswar. He initially saw Ramakrishna's ecstasies and visions as \"mere figments of imagination\" and \"hallucinations\". As a member of Brahmo Samaj, he opposed idol worship, polytheism and Ramakrishna's worship of Kali. He even rejected the Advaita Vedanta of \"identity with the absolute\" as blasphemy and madness, and often ridiculed the idea. Narendra tested Ramakrishna, who faced his arguments patiently: \"Try to see the truth from all angles\", he replied.\n\nNarendra's father's sudden death in 1884 left the family bankrupt; creditors began demanding the repayment of loans, and relatives threatened to evict the family from their ancestral home. Narendra, once a son of a well-to-do family, became one of the poorest students in his college. He unsuccessfully tried to find work and questioned God's existence, but found solace in Ramakrishna and his visits to Dakshineswar increased.\n\nOne day Narendra requested Ramakrishna to pray to goddess Kali for their family's financial welfare. Ramakrishna suggested him to go to the temple himself and pray. Following Ramakrishna's suggestion, he went to the temple thrice, but failed to pray for any kind of worldly necessities and ultimately prayed for true knowledge and devotion from the goddess. Narendra gradually grew ready to renounce everything for the sake of realising God, and accepted Ramakrishna as his Guru.\n\nIn 1885, Ramakrishna developed throat cancer, and was transferred to Calcutta and (later) to a garden house in Cossipore. Narendra and Ramakrishna's other disciples took care of him during his last days, and Narendra's spiritual education continued. At Cossipore, he experienced \"Nirvikalpa samadhi\". Narendra and several other disciples received ochre robes from Ramakrishna, forming his first monastic order. He was taught that service to men was the most effective worship of God. Ramakrishna asked him to care for the other monastic disciples, and in turn asked them to see Narendra as their leader. Ramakrishna died in the early-morning hours of 16 August 1886 in Cossipore.\n\nAfter Ramakrishna's death, his devotees and admirers stopped supporting his disciples. Unpaid rent accumulated, and Narendra and the other disciples had to find a new place to live. Many returned home, adopting a \"Grihastha\" (family-oriented) way of life. Narendra decided to convert a dilapidated house at Baranagar into a new \"math\" (monastery) for the remaining disciples. Rent for the Baranagar Math was low, raised by \"holy begging\" (\"mādhukarī\"). The math became the first building of the Ramakrishna Math: the monastery of the monastic order of Ramakrishna. Narendra and other disciples used to spend many hours in practising meditation and religious austerities every day. Narendra later reminisced about the early days of the monastery:\nIn 1887, Narendra compiled a Bengali song anthology named \"Sangeet Kalpataru\" with Vaishnav Charan Basak. Narendra collected and arranged most of the songs of this compilation, but could not finish the work of the book for unfavourable circumstances.\n\nIn December 1886, the mother of Baburam invited Narendra and his other brother monks to Antpur village. Narendra and the other aspiring monks accepted the invitation and went to Antpur to spend few days. In Antpur, in the Christmas Eve of 1886, Narendra and eight other disciples took formal monastic vows. They decided to live their lives as their master lived. Narendranath took the name \"Swami Vivekananda\".\n\nIn 1888, Narendra left the monastery as a \"Parivrâjaka\"— the Hindu religious life of a wandering monk, \"without fixed abode, without ties, independent and strangers wherever they go\". His sole possessions were a kamandalu (water pot), staff and his two favourite books: the \"Bhagavad Geeta\" and \"The Imitation of Christ\". Narendra travelled extensively in India for five years, visiting centres of learning and acquainting himself with diverse religious traditions and social patterns. He developed sympathy for the suffering and poverty of the people, and resolved to uplift the nation. Living primarily on bhiksha (alms), Narendra travelled on foot and by railway (with tickets bought by admirers). During his travels he met, and stayed with Indians from all religions and walks of life: scholars, \"dewans\", rajas, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, \"paraiyars\" (low-caste workers) and government officials. Narendra left Bombay for Chicago on 31 May 1893 with the name \"Vivekananda\", as suggested by Ajit Singh of Khetri, which means \"the bliss of discerning wisdom,\" from Sanskrit \"viveka\" and \"ānanda\".\n\nVivekananda started his journey to the West on 31 May 1893 and visited several cities in Japan (including Nagasaki, Kobe, Yokohama, Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo), China and Canada en route to the United States, reaching Chicago on 30 July 1893, where the \"Parliament of Religions\" took place in September 1893. The Congress was an initiative of the Swedenborgian layman, and judge of the Illinois Supreme Court, Charles C. Bonney, to gather all the religions of the world, and show \"the substantial unity of many religions in the good deeds of the religious life.\" It was one of the more than 200 adjunct gatherings and congresses of the Chicago's World's Fair, and was \"an avant-garde intellectual manifestation of [...] cultic milieus, East and West,\" with the Brahmo Samaj and the Theosophical Society being invited as being representative of Hinduism.\n\nVivekananda wanted to join, but was disappointed to learn that no one without credentials from a \"bona fide\" organisation would be accepted as a delegate. Vivekananda contacted Professor John Henry Wright of Harvard University, who invited him to speak at Harvard. Vivekananda wrote of the professor, \"He urged upon me the necessity of going to the Parliament of Religions, which he thought would give an introduction to the nation\". Vivekananda submitted an application, \"introducing himself as a monk 'of the oldest order of \"sannyāsis\" ... founded by Sankara,'\" supported by the Brahmo Samaj representative Protapchandra Mozoombar, who was also a member of the Parliament's selection committee, \"classifying the Swami as a representative of the Hindu monastic order.\"\n\nThe Parliament of the World's Religions opened on 11 September 1893 at the Art Institute of Chicago as part of the World's Columbian Exposition. On this day, Vivekananda gave a brief speech representing India and Hinduism. He was initially nervous, bowed to Saraswati (the Hindu goddess of learning) and began his with \"Sisters and brothers of America!\". At these words, Vivekananda received a two-minute standing ovation from the crowd of seven thousand. According to Sailendra Nath Dhar, when silence was restored he began his address, greeting the youngest of the nations on behalf of \"the most ancient order of monks in the world, the Vedic order of sannyasins, a religion which has taught the world both tolerance, of and universal acceptance\". Vivekananda quoted two illustrative passages from the \"Shiva mahimna stotram\": \"As the different streams having their sources in different places all mingle their water in the sea, so, O Lord, the different paths which men take, through different tendencies, various though they appear, crooked or straight, all lead to Thee!\" and \"Whosoever comes to Me, through whatsoever form, I reach him; all men are struggling through paths that in the end lead to Me.\" According to Sailendra Nath Dhar, \"it was only a short\nspeech, but it voiced the spirit of the Parliament.\"\n\nParliament President John Henry Barrows said, \"India, the Mother of religions was represented by Swami Vivekananda, the Orange-monk who exercised the most wonderful influence over his auditors\". Vivekananda attracted widespread attention in the press, which called him the \"cyclonic monk from India\". The \"New York Critique\" wrote, \"He is an orator by divine right, and his strong, intelligent face in its picturesque setting of yellow and orange was hardly less interesting than those earnest words, and the rich, rhythmical utterance he gave them\". The \"New York Herald\" noted, \"Vivekananda is undoubtedly the greatest figure in the Parliament of Religions. After hearing him we feel how foolish it is to send missionaries to this learned nation\". American newspapers reported Vivekananda as \"the greatest figure in the parliament of religions\" and \"the most popular and influential man in the parliament\".\nThe \"Boston Evening Transcript\" reported that Vivekananda was \"a great favourite at the parliament... if he merely crosses the platform, he is applauded\". He spoke \"at receptions, the scientific section, and private homes\" on topics related to Hinduism, Buddhism and harmony among religions until the parliament ended on 27 September 1893. Vivekananda's speeches at the Parliament had the common theme of universality, emphasising religious tolerance. He soon became known as a \"handsome oriental\" and made a huge impression as an orator.\n\nSponsorship of Swami Vivekananda for Parliament of the World's Religions\n\nIn 1892, Swami Vivekananda stayed with Bhaskara Sethupathy, who was a Raja of Ramnad, when he visited Madurai and he sponsored Vivekananda's visit to Parliament of the World's Religions held in Chicago.\n\nAfter the Parliament of Religions, he toured many parts of the US as a guest. His popularity opened up new views for expanding on \"life and religion to thousands\". During a question-answer session at Brooklyn Ethical Society, he remarked, \"I have a message to the West as Buddha had a message to the East.\"\n\nVivekananda spent nearly two years lecturing in the eastern and central United States, primarily in Chicago, Detroit, Boston, and New York. He founded the Vedanta Society of New York in 1894. By spring 1895 his busy, tiring schedule had affected his health. He ended his lecture tours and began giving free, private classes in Vedanta and yoga. Beginning in June 1895, Vivekananda gave private lectures to a dozen of his disciples at Thousand Island Park in New York for two months.\n\nDuring his first visit to the West he travelled to the UK twice, in 1895 and 1896, lecturing successfully there. In November 1895 he met Margaret Elizabeth Noble an Irish woman who would become Sister Nivedita. During his second visit to the UK in May 1896 Vivekananda met Max Müller, a noted Indologist from Oxford University who wrote Ramakrishna's first biography in the West. From the UK, Vivekananda visited other European countries. In Germany he met Paul Deussen, another Indologist. Vivekananda was offered academic positions in two American universities (one the chair in Eastern Philosophy at Harvard University and a similar position at Columbia University); he declined both, since his duties would conflict with his commitment as a monk.\nHis success led to a change in mission, namely the establishment of Vedanta centres in the West. Vivekananda adapted traditional Hindu ideas and religiosity to suit the needs and understandings of his western audiences, who were especially attracted by and familiar with western esoteric traditions and movements like Transcendentalism and New thought. An important element in his adaptation of Hindu religiosity was the introduction of his \"four yogas\" model, which includes Raja yoga, his interpretation of Patanjali's Yoga sutras, which offered a practical means to realise the divine force within which is central to modern western esotericism. In 1896 his book \"Raja Yoga\" was published, which became an instant success and was highly influential in the western understanding of Yoga.\n\nVivekananda attracted followers and admirers in the US and Europe, including Josephine MacLeod, William James, Josiah Royce, Robert G. Ingersoll, Nikola Tesla, Lord Kelvin, Harriet Monroe, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, Sarah Bernhardt, Emma Calvé and Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz. He initiated several followers : Marie Louise (a French woman) became Swami Abhayananda, and Leon Landsberg became Swami Kripananda, so that they could continue the work of the mission of the Vedanta Society. This society still is filled with foreign nationals and is also located in Los Angeles. During his stay in America, Vivekananda was given land in the mountains to the southeast of San Jose, California to establish a retreat for Vedanta students. He called it \"Peace retreat\", or, \"Shanti Asrama\". The largest American centre is the Vedanta Society of Southern California in Hollywood, one of the twelve main centres. There is also a Vedanta Press in Hollywood which publishes books about Vedanta and English translations of Hindu scriptures and texts. Christina Greenstidel of Detroit was also initiated by Vivekananda with a mantra and she became Sister Christine, and they established a close father–daughter relationship.\n\nFrom the West, Vivekananda revived his work in India. He regularly corresponded with his followers and brother monks, offering advice and financial support. His letters from this period reflect his campaign of social service, and were strongly worded. He wrote to Akhandananda, \"Go from door to door amongst the poor and lower classes of the town of Khetri and teach them religion. Also, let them have oral lessons on geography and such other subjects. No good will come of sitting idle and having princely dishes, and saying \"Ramakrishna, O Lord!\"—unless you can do some good to the poor\". In 1895, Vivekananda founded the periodical \"Brahmavadin\" to teach the Vedanta. Later, Vivekananda's translation of the first six chapters of \"The Imitation of Christ\" was published in \"Brahmavadin\" in 1889. Vivekananda left for India on 16 December 1896 from England with his disciples Captain and Mrs. Sevier and J.J. Goodwin. On the way they visited France and Italy, and set sail for India from Naples on 30 December 1896. He was later followed to India by Sister Nivedita, who devoted the rest of her life to the education of Indian women and India's independence.\n\nThe ship from Europe arrived in Colombo, British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) on 15 January 1897, and Vivekananda received a warm welcome. In Colombo he gave his . From there on, his journey to Calcutta was triumphant. Vivekananda travelled from Colombo to Pamban, Rameswaram, Ramnad, Madurai, Kumbakonam and Madras, delivering lectures. Common people and rajas gave him an enthusiastic reception. During his train travels, people often sat on the rails to force the train to stop so they could hear him. From Madras (now Chennai), he continued his journey to Calcutta and Almora. While in the West, Vivekananda spoke about India's great spiritual heritage; in India, he repeatedly addressed social issues: uplifting the people, eliminating the caste system, promoting science and industrialisation, addressing widespread poverty and ending colonial rule. These lectures, published as \"Lectures from Colombo to Almora\", demonstrate his nationalistic fervour and spiritual ideology.\n\nOn 1 May 1897 in Calcutta, Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Mission for social service. Its ideals are based on \"\", and its governing body consists of the trustees of the Ramakrishna Math (which conducts religious work). Both Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission have their headquarters at Belur Math. Vivekananda founded two other monasteries: one in Mayavati in the Himalayas (near Almora), the \"Advaita Ashrama\" and another in Madras. Two journals were founded: \"Prabuddha Bharata\" in English and \"Udbhodan\" in Bengali. That year, famine-relief work was begun by Swami Akhandananda in the Murshidabad district.\n\nVivekananda earlier inspired Jamshedji Tata to set up a research and educational institution when they travelled together from Yokohama to Chicago on Vivekananda's first visit to the West in 1893. Tata now asked him to head his Research Institute of Science; Vivekananda declined the offer, citing a conflict with his \"spiritual interests\". He visited Punjab, attempting to mediate an ideological conflict between Arya Samaj (a reformist Hindu movement) and \"sanatan\" (orthodox Hindus). After brief visits to Lahore, Delhi and Khetri, Vivekananda returned to Calcutta in January 1898. He consolidated the work of the math and trained disciples for several months. Vivekananda composed \"Khandana Bhava–Bandhana\", a prayer song dedicated to Ramakrishna, in 1898.\n\nDespite declining health, Vivekananda left for the West for a second time in June 1899 accompanied by Sister Nivedita and Swami Turiyananda. Following a brief stay in England, he went to the United States. During this visit, Vivekananda established Vedanta Societies in San Francisco and New York and founded a \"shanti ashrama\" (peace retreat) in California. He then went to Paris for the Congress of Religions in 1900. His lectures in Paris concerned the worship of the \"lingam\" and the authenticity of the Bhagavad Gita. Vivekananda then visited Brittany, Vienna, Istanbul, Athens and Egypt. The French philosopher Jules Bois was his host for most of this period, until he returned to Calcutta on 9 December 1900.\n\nAfter a brief visit to the Advaita Ashrama in Mayavati Vivekananda settled at Belur Math, where he continued co-ordinating the works of Ramakrishna Mission, the math and the work in England and the US. He had many visitors, including royalty and politicians. Although Vivekananda was unable to attend the Congress of Religions in 1901 in Japan due to deteriorating health, he made pilgrimages to Bodhgaya and Varanasi. Declining health (including asthma, diabetes and chronic insomnia) restricted his activity.\n\nOn 4 July 1902 (the day of his death) Vivekananda awoke early, went to the monastery at Belur Math and meditated for three hours. He taught \"Shukla-Yajur-Veda\", Sanskrit grammar and the philosophy of yoga to pupils, later discussing with colleagues a planned Vedic college in the Ramakrishna Math. At 7:00 p.m. Vivekananda went to his room, asking not to be disturbed; he died at 9:20 p.m. while meditating. According to his disciples, Vivekananda attained mahasamādhi; the rupture of a blood vessel in his brain was reported as a possible cause of death. His disciples believed that the rupture was due to his \"brahmarandhra\" (an opening in the crown of his head) being pierced when he attained \"mahasamādhi\". Vivekananda fulfilled his prophecy that he would not live forty years. He was cremated on a sandalwood funeral pyre on the bank of the Ganga in Belur, opposite where Ramakrishna was cremated sixteen years earlier.\n\nVivekananda propagated that the essence of Hinduism was best expressed in Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta philosophy. Nevertheless, following Ramakrishna, and in contrast to Advaita Vedanta, Vivekananda believed that the Absolute is both immanent and transcendent. According to Anil Sooklal, Vivekananda's neo-Advaita \"reconciles Dvaita or dualism and Advaita or non-dualism\". Vivekananda summarised the Vedanta as follows, giving it a modern and Universalistic interpretation:\nNationalism was a prominent theme in Vivekananda's thought. He believed that a country's future depends on its people, and his teachings focused on human development. He wanted \"to set in motion a machinery which will bring noblest ideas to the doorstep of even the poorest and the meanest\".\n\nVivekananda linked morality with control of the mind, seeing truth, purity and unselfishness as traits which strengthened it. He advised his followers to be holy, unselfish and to have \"shraddhā\" (faith). Vivekananda supported \"brahmacharya\" (celibacy), believing it the source of his physical and mental stamina and eloquence. He emphasised that success was an outcome of focused thought and action; in his lectures on Raja Yoga he said, \"Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life – think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success, that is the way great spiritual giants are produced\".\n\nVivekananda was one of the main representatives of Neo-Vedanta, a modern interpretation of selected aspects of Hinduism in line with western esoteric traditions, especially Transcendentalism, New Thought and Theosophy. His reinterpretation was, and is, very successful, creating a new understanding and appreciation of Hinduism within and outside India, and was the principal reason for the enthusiastic reception of yoga, transcendental meditation and other forms of Indian spiritual self-improvement in the West. Agehananda Bharati explained, \"...modern Hindus derive their knowledge of Hinduism from Vivekananda, directly or indirectly\". Vivekananda espoused the idea that all sects within Hinduism (and all religions) are different paths to the same goal. However, this view has been criticised as an oversimplification of Hinduism.\nIn the background of emerging nationalism in British-ruled India, Vivekananda crystallised the nationalistic ideal. In the words of social reformer Charles Freer Andrews, \"The Swami's intrepid patriotism gave a new colour to the national movement throughout India. More than any other single individual of that period Vivekananda had made his contribution to the new awakening of India\". Vivekananda drew attention to the extent of poverty in the country, and maintained that addressing such poverty was a prerequisite for national awakening. His nationalistic ideas influenced many Indian thinkers and leaders. Sri Aurobindo regarded Vivekananda as the one who awakened India spiritually. Mahatma Gandhi counted him among the few Hindu reformers \"who have maintained this Hindu religion in a state of splendor by cutting down the dead wood of tradition\".\n\nThe first governor-general of independent India, Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, said \"Vivekananda saved Hinduism, saved India\". According to Subhas Chandra Bose, a proponent of armed struggle for Indian independence, Vivekananda was \"the maker of modern India\"; for Gandhi, Vivekananda's influence increased Gandhi's \"love for his country a thousandfold\". Vivekananda influenced India's independence movement; his writings inspired independence activists such as Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Aurobindo Ghose, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Bagha Jatin and intellectuals such as Aldous Huxley, Christopher Isherwood, Romain Rolland. Many years after Vivekananda's death Rabindranath Tagore told French Nobel laureate Romain Rolland, \"If you want to know India, study Vivekananda. In him everything is positive and nothing negative\". Rolland wrote, \"His words are great music, phrases in the style of Beethoven, stirring rhythms like the march of Händel choruses. I cannot touch these sayings of his, scattered as they are through the pages of books, at thirty years' distance, without receiving a thrill through my body like an electric shock. And what shocks, what transports, must have been produced when in burning words they issued from the lips of the hero!\"\n\nJamshedji Tata was inspired by Vivekananda to establish the Indian Institute of Science, one of India's best-known research universities. Abroad, Vivekananda communicated with orientalist Max Müller, and scientist Nikola Tesla was one of those influenced by his Vedic teachings. While National Youth Day in India is observed on his birthday, 12 January, the day he delivered his masterful speech at the Parliament of Religions, 11 September 1893 is \"World Brotherhood Day\". In September 2010, India's Finance Ministry highlighted the relevance of Vivekananda's teachings and values to the modern economic environment. The then Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, the President of India before the current President Ram Nath Kovind, approved in principle the Swami Vivekananda Values Education Project at a cost of , with objectives including involving youth with competitions, essays, discussions and study circles and publishing Vivekananda's works in a number of languages. In 2011, the West Bengal Police Training College was renamed the Swami Vivekananda State Police Academy, West Bengal.\nThe state technical university in Chhattisgarh has been named the Chhattisgarh Swami Vivekanand Technical University. In 2012, the Raipur airport was renamed Swami Vivekananda Airport.\n\nThe 150th birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda was celebrated in India and abroad. The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports in India officially observed 2013 as the occasion in a declaration. Year-long events and programs were organised by branches of the Ramakrishna Math, the Ramakrishna Mission, the central and state governments in India, educational institutions and youth groups. Bengali film director Tutu (Utpal) Sinha made a film, \"\" as a tribute for his 150th birth anniversary.\n\nAlthough Vivekananda was a powerful orator and writer in English and Bengali, he was not a thorough scholar, and most of his published works were compiled from lectures given around the world which were \"mainly delivered [...] impromptu and with little preparation\". His main work, \"Raja Yoga\", consists of talks he delivered in New York.\n\nAccording to Banhatti, \"[a] singer, a painter, a wonderful master of language and a poet, Vivekananda was a complete artist\", composing many songs and poems, including his favourite, \"Kali the Mother\". Vivekananda blended humour with his teachings, and his language was lucid. His Bengali writings testify to his belief that words (spoken or written) should clarify ideas, rather than demonstrating the speaker (or writer's) knowledge.\n\n\"Bartaman Bharat\" meaning \"Present Day India\" is an erudite Bengali language essay written by him, which was first published in the March 1899 issue of Udbodhan, the only Bengali language magazine of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission. The essay was reprinted as a book in 1905 and later compiled into the fourth volume of The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda. In this essay his refrain to the readers was to honour and treat every Indian as a brother irrespective of whether he was born poor or in lower caste.\n\nHere a list of selected books by Vivekananda that were published after his death (1902)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the 1668 canon law a child was to be baptized within eight days after the birth. Ulrika Eleonora and Charles XI had their children baptized in different rounds, first straight after the birth, and then a bit later at the formal ceremony.\n\nIn 1864 it was determined that all baptisms should take place within six weeks from the birth, a tradition that was maintained by the Royal family until the baptism of Carl XVI Gustaf in 1946. He was baptized first eleven weeks after his birth. The royal children, crown princess Victoria, prince Carl Philip and princess Madeleine were also baptized between eleven and fifteen weeks after they were born. The baptism of royal children is about more than tradition. The order of succession states that all members of the royal family must \"confess to the true evangelic faith\", or the right to the throne is lost. Many royal baptisms have taken place in the Royal Chapel, with a few exceptions.\n\nSilver was long to equate with the colour white in royal ceremonies. White long had a deep symbolic meaning in Christian contexts, the colour stood for light, virginity and purity. Silver cloths were therefor often used for swaddling infants and to carry as a canopy over parts of the baptism party.\n\nIn 1655 the future Charles XI received a cradle as a christening gift from his mothers parents. It is exhibited at the Royal Armoury in Stockholm, and it is the only item that still is in use. The cradle is made out of sculptured, gold plated and painted wood. The last time it was used was at Princess Estelle's baptism on May 22, 2012. A special parade cradle for princesses had been used since 1830, but when Estelle was born it was as an heir to the throne, so for her baptism Charles XI's cradle was taken out of the Royal Armoury.\n"}

He was the son of the 49th Da'i al-Mutlaq Mohammed Burhanuddin, whose family lineage can be traced back to Syedi Fakhruddin Shaheed.\n\nDuring his reign, Taher Saifuddin RA adapted the modernisation in Western and European ideas, and over the course of it, he established its benefits for the Bohra community. This sets him an ideal for the mixture of modern isation, education while being rooted in the traditions and the culture of the Fatimi Heritage and his son and successor Syedna Mohammad Burhanuddin and grandson and his successor Syedna Aaliqadr Mufaddal Saifuddin have continued in his path taking giant strides in the benefit of the community. ,\n\nSayedna Taher Saifuddin was born to Mohammed Burhanuddin and Aaisaheba Amatullah Aaisaheba on 4 August 1888 in Surat, British Raj (now in the Indian state of Gujarat).\n\nSaifuddin became the 51st al-Dāʿī al-Mutlaq in the year 1915.\nHe rebuilt or repaired many monuments of Fatimi Imams, al-Dāʿī al-Mutlaq and other prominent structures and artifacts.\n\nHe was the Chancellor of the Aligarh Muslim University for four consecutive terms. He was made honorary chancellor of this university, which had only few Bohra students.\n\nSaifuddin contributed vast sums of money towards the refurbishment of mosques and shrines. He along with the Nizam of Hyderabad were among the few Indian Muslims to contribute towards the renovation of Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem: \"Sultan Tahir Saif al-Din is said to have come from India with one hundred and fifty of his followers...At the Jerusalem station he was welcomed by the Mufti and other Sheikhs of the Supreme Moslem Council and a number of Arab notables including Ragheb Bey Nashashibi. A troop of Arab boy scouts paraded in his honour and there were two bands from Moslem institutions...The sultan was reputed to be a man of great wealth who had made substantial contributions to the religious and political funds of the Arabs of this country.\"\n\nSyedna Taher Saifuddin also gifted the internal curtains which were kept in the Kaaba for decades to King Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia in 1354AH, with whom he kept warm relations.\n\nHe constructed Ghurratul Masajid (Saifee Masjid) in Mumbai, al Mahal al Saifee for pilgrims in Mecca, the Zarih of Ali Ibn Abi Talib in Najaf and Husayn ibn Ali in Karbala and Cairo, the mausoleum of Qutubuddin Shaheed and Fakhruddin Shaheed. He also made and donated the Kiswah of the Kaaba.\n\nSyedna Taher Saifuddin married Aaisaheba Husaina Aaisaheba, who was also from the family of Da'i al-Mutlaq. After her death, he then married Wazeerah Aaisaheba, Fatema Aaisaheba and Amenah Aaisaheba.\n\nHe had a total of 12 sons and 8 daughters. His sons were Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin, Husain Husamuddin, Abdut Taiyeb Zakiyuddin, Yusuf Najmuddin, Ismail Shehabuddin, Hatim Hamiduddin, Qasim Hakimuddin, Aliasghar Kalimudddin, Shabbir Nooruddin, Abbas Fakhruddin, Khuzaima Qutbuddin and Mohammed al-Baqir Jamaluddin.

He also has link with Mohammad Rasulullah family as indicated in tree placed below.\n\nThe following are a list of Rasāʾil Ramaḍāniyya composed by Taher Saifuddin . Each Risalah (epistle) is given a title gematrically equivalent to the Hijri year of its publication:\nThe Chandabhoy Galla Case is celebrated case in the history of religion where a human being is challenged for the representative of God on earth who is infallible and immaculate. The case was filed by the Advocate General of Mumbai at the behest of Adamjee Pirbhai family members against Syedna Taher Saifuddin. The case was filed in 1917 and decided in 1921. The claim was based on the belief of Imam as representative of the Prophet, and through him the representative of God, having withdrawn from the world, someone must represent him, and so ultimately the Deity on earth. The Dai, according to community religious belief, is that representative. The ownership of the Chandabhoy ‘Galla’( box kept for religious offerings) was denied on the plea of improper succession. \n\nConcluding this extraordinary case then Advocate general Strangman remark about Syedna Taher saifuddin recorded is as follows :\n\n\"Looking back on the proceedings, I think what impressed me the most, even more than the extravagance of the claims, was the personality of the Mullaji, a frail looking figure possessed nevertheless of an iron will, great determination, and organising capacity. At the time he assumed office the administration must have been extremely slack. Yet he managed in a very few years not only to pull the administration together but to obtain a hold upon his followers greater perhaps than that of any of his predecessors.\"\n\nDuring testimony of 51st Dai Syedna Taher Saifuddin, he clarified about knowledge classes of 'Zahir', 'Tavil' and, 'Hakikat' present in community. First two are known to many but third one namely 'Hakikat' content some religious truths known to very few. Some of which are known to only 2 or 3 persons in community, and there is also knowledge which is available with Dai only, and he gets it from his predecessor Dai.\n\nSaifuddin died on 12 November 1965 in Matheran, Maharashtra, India.

The temple is situated on the Heavenly Horse (, \"Tianma\") peak of White Horse Mountain (, \"Báimǎ shān\") in the Wudang Mountains. The Wudang Mountains are home to a famous complex of Taoist temples and the monasteries and associated with the god Xuan Wu. The Temple of the Five Immortals is one of the very few temples in the Wudang mountain range which is still maintained by real Daoist monks who dedicate their life to explore the great Dao.\n\nWudang was named a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational Scientific Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1994.\n\nInside the Hubei Province, looming above the Yellow Dragon River, at 1048 meters elevation, sits the Temple of the Five Immortals. The grounds are located approximately one hour hiking distance from the nearest village, at the base of the mountain. The nearest city is located about a one-hour bus journey from the village. Locals have been using this temple for generations as a place of worship and prayer and many believe the Five Immortals to be their heavenly protectors. On special days of celebration, many hike to the temple to pay homage there, or to carry daily necessities to the residing Taoists.\n\nThe temple was erected approximately 1000 years ago during a time of great conflict. It was known then as ‘The Sanctuary’. People who were seeking refuge from the war fled to this fortress and were protected by five Daoists who later became known as ‘The Five Immortals’. The Temple has been maintained throughout the many centuries that have passed between then and now. An Abbot remains still and continues to impart the knowledge passed on by the five immortals to the students that are now arriving from all parts of the globe.\n\nAlthough the temple has been maintained throughout the ages, much of it suffered great damage and has been in a state of disrepair for much time. In 1995, Master Li Shifu came to practice as an Abbot here and to train disciples in the arts of Daoism. Since he has arrived, the restoration project has begun. It has been a slow and challenging process due to the state of dilapidation but improvement and development has been consistent over the last two decades and the temple is gradually increasing its capacity to host more students.\n\nThe current structure is approximately 100 years old. It is a small and relatively unknown and humble estate. Knowledge of the Temple has not yet reached much of the wider world community. It is known mostly by the local mountain people. There are usually fewer than three practicing Daoists residing there. It is a simple, peaceful place to practice and potentially cultivate immortality.\n\nAccording to the ancient legends, the Five Immortals were endowed with great wisdom. \nThe Immortals were known by the locals as the protector Gods of their families and relatives. On special days of celebration, the local people would climb the mountain to offer gratitude and reverence or to haul daily necessities to the residing Daoist monks. It is about one hours journey on foot from the village to the temple. The Immortals teach people the virtue of morality and compassion and the essence of heart-mind. They teach people to cultivate integrity and to nurture the innate nature of the self. The masters have revealed their supernatural abilities to help people in need and so crowds of people from the surrounding areas often climb to carry sacrificial offerings to them.\n\nXing De (Daoist name)\nDate of Birth: 1964, Henan Province, Shang Qiu. \nXing De traveled extensively in his youth, seeking out many grandmasters in the mountains of China. He was accepted by many elders and has received many names. In 1991 he began his journey as an official devotee of Taoism. In 1996 he committed himself to a life of renunciation in White Horse Mountain (Wudang, Hubei Province). He studied the practices of cultivating Internal Alchemy from the grandmasters and devoted much of his time to mantras, rituals, talismans and Taoist Medicine for which he received transmissions from the elders. He became the Abbot of Five Immortals Temple in 2000. He is a priest of the Mount Wudang Dragon Gate Sect and Pure Yang Sect and he is a Master of Jing Chan Ceremonies.\n\nAs we enter 2015, the quantity of pilgrims is increasing and more tourists are arriving on the Wudang Mountain. This once sacred place of hermitage is slowly changing as people seek escape from the chaos of the cities. The solace of the mountain drives them en masse at weekends and during holidays into the holy grounds. The mountain remains quiet during the winter months but tourists, pilgrims and explorers arrive in great numbers during the summer months. The disturbance caused by these arrivals is considered necessary for a true cultivation in this modern world. They are considered to be important source material to promote potential and refinement in the midst of the chaos one must encounter on The Path.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33237981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33237981", "title": "The Creation structure", "text": "The Creation structure\n\nThe Creation, the oratorio by Joseph Haydn, is structured in three parts. He composed it in 1796–1798 on German text as Die Schöpfung. The work is set for soloists, chorus and orchestra. Its movements are listed in tables for their form, voice, key, tempo marking, time signature and source. \n\nThe origin of the libretto is not known. Haydn received the booklet in English in London on his second extended stay in 1795 from his impresario Johann Peter Salomon. According to Haydn, it was passed by a certain Lidley, or perhaps Thomas Linley, and was attributed to him, but may be written by an unknown author. Back in Vienna, Haydn passed it to his friend and sponsor Baron Gottfried van Swieten, who translated and organized it.\n\nThe sources for the libretto are the two Creation narratives from the Book of Genesis, some Psalms, and John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\", an epic poem in ten volumes, first published in 1667. The libretto is structured in three parts, the first dealing with the Creation of the universe and the plants, the second with the Creation of the animals, and of man and woman, and the third with Adam and Eve in Paradise, showing an idealized love in harmony with the \"new world\".\n\nHaydn had composed symphonies, operas, string quartets and more chamber music for the court at Eszterháza. For the oratorio he used the vocal means of contemporary opera, recitative, aria, ensemble and chorus. The orchestra plays a decisive role in structure and tone painting.\n\nThe oratorio has five solo roles, in Part I and II the three archangels Gabriel (soprano), Uriel (tenor) and Raphael (bass), in Part III Adam (bass) and Eve (soprano). The final movement needs an additional alto soloist. The chorus is in four parts, SATB. Haydn used three soloists, some conductors prefer different soloists for Adam and Eve.\nHaydn set most of the narration from the Genesis in secco recitative. The rendering of the words is simple, different for example from Bach's approach in the parts of the Evangelist in his Passions. Haydn exceptions are the two recitatives opening Part I and II, which are accompanied by the orchestra. For each day, the recitative is followed by a contemplation of it, typically in accompanied recitative and aria, and affirmed by a choral movement.\n\nAs Bach in his \"Christmas Oratorio\" and Handel in \"Messiah\", Haydn saves the soprano voice for a late appearance. Whereas Bach and Handel reserve the high voice for the Annunciation to the shepherds, Haydn has Gabriel be the first to proclaim the wonder of the Wunderwerk (miraculous work).\n\nDifferently from Handel, who keeps solo and choral singing mostly separate in his operas and oratorios, Haydn strives for an interaction of solo and chorus, as in his late Masses and contemporary opera. In the conclusion of Part I, \"Die Himmel erzählen die Ehre Gottes\" (The heavens are telling the glory of God), which covers the first two verses of Psalm 19, the second verse, \"To day that is coming speaks it the day ...\", is given to the soloists, who sing to each other. This trio section is repeated, leading to a choral repetition of verse 1, the second time a bit faster (Più allegro) and concluded by an elaborate fugue, crafted on its second part, \"and the firmament sheweth his handywork\". In \"Vollendet ist das große Werk\", the chorus frames a slow trio section by two different fast movements. In \"Von deiner Güt, o Herr und Gott\" (By thy goodness, O bounteous Lord), the soloists sing a duet, accompanied by triplets, while the choir with the timpani sings simultaneously, as a soft foundation in even rhythm speaking of eternity, \"Gesegnet sei des Herren Macht\" (Forever blessed be his pow'r).\n\nThe orchestra plays a distinct role in word painting. For example, flute and clarinet imitate the singing of the birds, trombones and contrabassoon articulate the roaring of the lion. When God speaks in person, \"Seid fruchtbar\" (be fruitful), the bass voice is accompanied by the low strings only. The solemn sound is reminiscent of the string quartet accompanying the Vox Christi (voice of Christ) in Bach's \"St Matthew Passion\". The cellos have the melody speaking of human love, three flutes illustrate Paradise.\n\nRichard Wigmore summarizes: \"In our own sceptical and precarious age we can still delight, perhaps with a touch of nostalgia, in Haydn’s unsullied optimism, expressed in some of the most lovable and life-affirming music ever composed.\"\n\nThe following tables are organized by a number and first line of the movements. Different numbering of the movement exists. The voices are sometimes abbreviated S for soprano, T for tenor, B for bass. The modulating keys of many recitatives are written in accidentals. Recitatives typically come without a tempo marking. If no source is given, the text is derived from \"Paradise Lost\". The book of Genesis is abbreviated \"Gen\", the Book of Psalms \"Ps\". The English translations are taken from the edition of the Oxford University Press, 1991.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4842689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4842689", "title": "Thelemic mysticism", "text": "Thelemic mysticism\n\nWithin the modern system of Thelema, developed by occultist Aleister Crowley in the first half of the 20th century, Thelemic mysticism is a complex mystical path designed to do two interrelated things: to learn one's unique True Will and to achieve union with the All. The set of techniques for doing so falls under Crowley's term Magick, which draws upon various existing disciplines and mystical models, including Yoga, Western ceremonial ritual (especially invocations and eucharistic ceremony), the Qabalah, and several divination systems, especially the tarot and astrology.\n\nThe path to mystical attainment or enlightenment was initially developed by Crowley largely based on the meditation/mystical techniques found in Buddhism and also the Tree of Life, especially as it was examined by Eliphas Levi in the 19th century and later by various members in the occult society, the Golden Dawn. In 1904, Crowley claimed to have transcribed, via \"direct-voice transmission\" from a \"praeternatural intelligence\" named Aiwass, The Book of the Law, which he eventually called the central sacred text of Thelema, heralding a new Aeon for mankind.\n\nBetween 1907 and 1911, Crowley wrote a series of other small texts which he considered to be \"inspired\" in that they were written \"through\" him rather than \"by\" him, which were afterwards collected together and termed the Holy Books. The final text added to the list was \"The Vision and the Voice\", a vivid account of Crowley's astral travels through the thirty Enochian Aethyrs. These texts formed the final mystical backbone of Crowley's system.\n\nWithin the system that Crowley developed, the core task for the adept is the discovery and manifestation of Will, defined at times as a grand destiny and at other times as a moment to moment path of action that operates in perfect harmony with Nature. This Will does not spring from conscious intent, but from the interplay between the deepest Self and the entire Universe. Therefore, the enlightened Thelemite is one who is able to eliminate or bypass the consciousness-created desires, conflicts, and habits, and tap directly into the Self/Universe nexus. Theoretically, at this point, the Thelemite acts in alignment with Nature, just as the stream flows downhill, with neither resistance nor \"lust of result.\"\n\nThe ability to accomplish this Great Work requires a great deal of preparation and effort, according to Crowley's system. The programme consists of several key elements, including a thorough knowledge of the Hermetic Qabalah (especially the Tree of Life), disciplined concentration (i.e. meditation), the development of one's Body of Light (or astral body) (in order to experience other spiritual realms) and the consistent and regular invocation of certain deities or spiritual beings.\n\nThe Tree of Life is a tool used to categorize and organize various mystical concepts. At its most simple level it is composed of ten spheres, or emanations, called sephiroth (sing. \"sephira\") which are connected by twenty-two paths. The sephiroth are represented by the planets and the paths by the characters of the Hebrew alphabet, which are subdivided by the five elements, the seven classical planets, and the twelve signs of the Zodiac.\n\nWithin the western magical tradition, the Tree is used as a kind of conceptual filing cabinet. Each sephira and path is assigned various ideas, such as gods, cards of the Tarot, astrological planets and signs, elements, etc. Within Thelema, the seminal book which defines all these correspondences is Crowley's Liber 777, although there have been other influential writers on the topic, including Israel Regardie and Eliphas Levi.\n\nThe path of attainment is largely defined by the Tree of Life. The aspirant begins in Malkuth, which is the everyday material world of phenomena, with the ultimate goal being at Kether, the sphere of Unity with the All. Through various exercises and practices, he or she attains certain spiritual and mental states that are characterized by the various sephiroth that ascend the Tree. Crowley considered a deep understanding of the Qabalah to be essential to the Thelemite:\n\nThe Tree of Life has got to be learnt by heart; you must know it backwards, forwards, sideways, and upside down; it must become the automatic background of all your thinking. You must keep on hanging everything that comes your way upon its proper bough.\n\nand,\n\nThe art of using it consists principally in referring all our ideas to it, discovering thus the common nature of certain things and the essential differences between others, so that ultimately one obtains a simple view of the incalculably vast complexity of the Universe.\n<br><br>\nThe whole subject must be studied in the Book 777, and the main attributions committed to memory: then when by constant use the system is at last understood—as opposed to being merely memorised—the student will find fresh light break in on him at every turn as he continues to measure every item of new knowledge that he attains by this Standard. For to him the Universe will then begin to appear as a coherent and a necessary Whole.\n\nPart of the reason why the Qabalah is so important is that it is the key to understanding the Holy Books. Most of them, including The Book of the Law, are written in abstract, poetic, and often obscure language. Through the use of the Qabalah, and especially the function of gematria (a form of numerology), the normally opaque meaning of the texts can be made clear. Thelemites can also make use of gematria to link words and concepts and to validate revelations given to them in magical operations, such as astral travel.\n\nAnother key element to Thelemic mysticism is the ability to concentrate. This skill has two modalities: the first is the rapid, accurate, and efficient movement of thought (which is the realm of magick) and the other is the stopping of thought altogether (which is accomplished in Yoga). In the first, it is the manipulation of all ideas into one idea, and in the second is the taking of that one thought and reducing it to nothing. Of this skill, Crowley writes:\n\nFor concentration does indeed unlock all doors; it lies at the heart of every practice as it is of the essence of all theory; and almost all the various rules and regulations are aimed at securing adeptship in this matter. All the subsidiary work—awareness, one-pointedness, mindfulness and the rest—is intended to train you to this.\n\nConcentration is essentially the prerequisite for all sustained success, not only in spiritual practices, but in day-to-day life as well. The general program for developing concentration is borrowed almost completely from the practice of Yoga within the Hindu and Buddhist systems. Crowley gives a general overview of the techniques in two books: \"Eight Lectures on Yoga\" and in the section called \"Mysticism\" in his opus, Magick (Book 4).\n\nThe Body of Light—Crowley's term for the subtle body—is the theoretical aspect of self that can leave the corporeal body and carry one's senses and consciousness during astral travels. Crowley writes of it in \"Book 4\": \"The work of the Body of Light—with the technique of Yoga—is the foundation of Magick.\" \n\nThe Body of Light must be developed and trained with exactly the same rigid discipline as the brain in the case of mysticism. The essence of the technique of Magick is the development of the Body of Light, which must be extended to include all members of the organism, and indeed of the cosmos [...] The object is to possess a Body which is capable of doing easily any particular task that may lie before it. There must be no selection of special experience which appeals to one's immediate desire. One must go steadily through all possible pylons.\n\nCrowley explains that the most important practices for developing the Body of Light are:\n\n\nThe benefit of astral travel is essentially one of education...it is akin to exploring one's own spiritual universe (\"Every Magician possesses an Astral Universe peculiar to himself\") and understanding the fundamental components, so that the adept can eventually master it. The general object is the \"control of the Astral Plane, the ability to find one's way about it, to penetrate such sanctuaries as are guarded from the profane, [and] to make such relations with its inhabitants as may avail to acquire knowledge and power, or to command service\". Also, \"one's apprehension of the Astral Plane must be accurate, for Angels, Archangels, and Gods are derived therefrom by analysis. One must have pure materials if one wishes to brew pure beer.\" It is vital to understand that all this must be in service to the Great Work of discovering one's True Will:\n\nLet the Magician therefore adventure himself upon the Astral Plane with the declared design to penetrate to a sanctuary of discarnate Beings such as are able to instruct and fortify him, also to prove their identity by testimony beyond rebuttal. All explanations other than these are of value only as extending and equilibrating Knowledge, or possibly as supplying Energy to such Magicians as may have found their way to the Sources of Strength. In all cases, naught is worth an obol save as it serve to help the One Great Work\"\n\nCrowley was also willing to admit that what was experienced during \"astral travel\" was not relevant in terms of what is \"real\" or \"unreal.\" Ultimately, the only value to this practice is in the utility it provides to the adept.\n\nThe 'reality' or 'objectivity' of these symbols is not pertinent to the discussion. [...] The Magician must not accept [my] account of the Astral Plane, [my] Qabalistic discoveries, [my] instructions in Magick. They may be correct in the main for most men; yet they cannot be wholly true for any save [myself], even as no two artists can make identical pictures of the same subject [...] What one sees and hears is 'real' in its way, whether it be itself, or distorted by one's desires, or created by one's personality [...] The true, the final test, of the Truth of one's visions is their Value. The most glorious experience on the Astral plane, let it dazzle and thrill as it may, is not necessarily in accordance with the True Will of the seer; if not, though it be never so true objectively, it is not true for him, because not useful for him.\n\nThe Body of Light is more important than simply for astral travel—it is the storehouse of all experiences.\n\nIn Magick, on the contrary, one passes through the veil of the exterior world (which, as in Yoga, but in another sense, becomes \"unreal\" by comparison as one passes beyond) one creates a subtle body (instrument is a better term) called the Body of Light; this one develops and controls; it gains new powers as one progresses, usually by means of what is called 'initiation': finally, one carries on almost one's whole life in this Body of Light, and achieves in its own way the mastery of the Universe.\n\nAccording to Crowley, there is a single definition of the purpose for ritual magick: to achieve Union with God through \"the uniting of the Microcosm with the Macrocosm.\" Since this process is so arduous, it is also acceptable to use magick to develop the self (i.e. one's Body of Light) or to create ideal circumstances for the Work (e.g. having access to a place in which to do ritual undisturbed). There are many kinds of magick, but the categories of ritual that are recommended by Crowley include (all quotes are from \"Book 4\"):\n\n\nCrowley often wrote that every adept's path will be unique. He also wrote that two major milestones are fundamental to Thelemic mysticism, which he called the knowledge of and conversation with one's Holy Guardian Angel and the crossing of the Abyss. Crowley wrote, \"the two crises—the Angel and the Abyss—are necessary features in every career. The other tasks are not always accomplished in [any given order]\". \n\nEven though the Holy Guardian Angel (or HGA) is, in a sense, the “higher self”, it is often experienced as a separate being, independent from the adept. In the system of the A∴A∴ magical order, the single most important goal is to consciously connect with one’s HGA, a process termed “Knowledge and Conversation.” By doing so, the magician becomes fully aware of his own True Will. For Crowley, this event was the single most important goal of any adept:\n\nIt should never be forgotten for a single moment that the central and essential work of the Magician is the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. Once he has achieved this he must of course be left entirely in the hands of that Angel, who can be invariably and inevitably relied upon to lead him to the further great step—crossing of the Abyss and the attainment of the grade of Master of the Temple.\n\nIn most of his writings, Crowley described the Holy Guardian Angel as one's \"Silent Self\", at times equitable with one's deepest unconscious. In later writings, he insisted that the HGA is an entirely separate and objective being. Whichever position is taken, the object remains the same—to gain an intimate spiritual connection so that one's True Will can become fully known and manifested. When using the Tree of Life as a guide, this event occurs in the Sphere of Tiphareth.\n\nCrowley wrote Liber Samekh as an example of a ritual designed specifically for attaining the Knowledge and Conversation with one’s HGA. In his notes to this ritual, Crowley sums up the key to success: “INVOKE OFTEN.” Another detailed description of the general operation is given in \"The Vision and the Voice,\" Aethyr 8 .\n\nAfter one attains Knowledge and Conversation with the Holy Guardian Angel, the adept may choose to then reach the next major milestone: the crossing of the Abyss, the great gulf or void between the phenomenal world of manifestation and its noumenal source, that great spiritual wilderness which must be crossed by the adept to attain mastery.\nThis doctrine is extremely difficult to explain; but it corresponds more or less to the gap in thought between the Real, which is ideal, and the Unreal, which is actual. In the Abyss all things exist, indeed, at least \"in posse\", but are without any possible meaning; for they lack the substratum of spiritual Reality. They are appearances without Law. They are thus \"Insane Delusions\".\nChoronzon is the Dweller in the Abyss; he is there as the final obstruction. If he is met with the proper preparation, then he is there to destroy the ego, which allows the adept to move beyond the Abyss. If unprepared, then the unfortunate traveller will be utterly dispersed into annihilation. Both Choronzon and the Abyss are discussed in Crowley's \"Confessions\" (ch. 66):\n\nThe name of the Dweller in the Abyss is Choronzon, but he is not really an individual. The Abyss is empty of being; it is filled with all possible forms, each equally inane, each therefore evil in the only true sense of the word—that is, meaningless but malignant, in so far as it craves to become real. These forms swirl senselessly into haphazard heaps like dust devils, and each such chance aggregation asserts itself to be an individual and shrieks, \"I am I!\" though aware all the time that its elements have no true bond; so that the slightest disturbance dissipates the delusion just as a horseman, meeting a dust devil, brings it in showers of sand to the earth.\n\nHowever, just on the other side of the Abyss awaits Babalon. She calls the adept to surrender completely, so that he or she may cross over.\n\nChoronzon is the dweller within the Abyss, and his purpose is to trap the traveller in a meaningless world of illusion. However Babalon is just on the other side, beckoning (in the sphere of Binah on the Tree of Life). If the adept gives himself to her—the symbol of this act is the pouring of the adept’s blood into her graal—he becomes impregnated in her (a state called \"Babe of the Abyss\"), then he is reborn as a Master and a Saint that dwells in the City of the Pyramids.\n\nThe \"City of the Pyramids\" is the home to those adepts that have crossed the great Abyss, having spilled all their blood in the Graal of Babalon. They have destroyed their earthly ego-identities, becoming nothing more than piles of dust (i.e. the remaining aspects of their True Selves without the self-sense of \"I\"). Within, they take on the name or title of Saint or Nemo (Latin for \"No-Man\" or \"No-One\"). In the system of A∴A∴ they are called Masters of the Temple. It is a step along the path of spiritual purification, and a spiritual resting place for those who have successfully shed their attachments to the mundane world.\n\nOf these adepts, it is written in \"The Vision and the Voice\" (Aethyr 14):\nThese adepts seem like Pyramids—their hoods and robes are like Pyramids [...] And the Beatific Vision is no more, and the glory of the Most High is no more. There is no more knowledge. There is no more bliss. There is no more power. There is no more beauty. For this is the Palace of Understanding: for thou art one with the Primeval things.' \n\nThe Master of the Temple accordingly interferes not with the scheme of things, except just so far as he is doing the Work which he is sent to do. Why should he struggle against imprisonment, banishment, death? [...] The Master of the Temple is so far from the man in whom He manifests that all these matters are of no importance to Him. It may be of importance to His Work that man shall sit upon a throne, or be hanged.\n\nI was instantly blotted in blackness. Mine Angel whispered the secret words whereby one partakes of the Mysteries of the Masters of the Temple. Presently my eyes beheld (what first seemed shapes of rocks) the Masters, veiled in motionless majesty, shrouded in silence. Each one was exactly like the other. Then the Angel bade me understand whereto my aspiration led: all powers, all ecstasies, ended in this—I understood. He then told me that now my name was Nemo, seated among the other silent shapes in the City of the Pyramids under the Night of Pan; those other parts of me that I had left for ever below the Abyss must serve as a vehicle for the energies which had been created by my act. My mind and body, deprived of the ego which they had hitherto obeyed, were now free to manifest according to their nature in the world, to devote themselves to aid mankind in its evolution. In my case I was to be cast out into the Sphere of Jupiter. My mortal part was to help humanity by Jupiterian work, such a governing, teaching, creating, exhorting men to aspire to become nobler, holier, worthier, kinglier, kindlier and more generous.\nThe City exists under the \"Night of Pan\", or N.O.X. The playful and lecherous Pan is the Greek god of nature, lust, and the masculine generative power. The Greek word \"Pan\" also translates as \"All\", and so he is “a symbol of the Universal, a personification of Nature; both Pangenetor, \"all-begetter,\" and Panphage, \"all-devourer\" (Sabazius, 1995). Therefore, Pan is both the giver and the taker of life, and his Night is that time of symbolic death where the adept experiences unification with the All through the ecstatic destruction of the ego-self. In a less poetic symbolic sense, this is the state where one transcends all limitations and experiences oneness with the universe.\n\nOnly a few reach the final two stages, The penultimate is the becoming of a Magus (symbolized by entering Chokmah on the Tree of Life), whose essential duty is to communicate a new Truth to mankind. Of the Magi, Crowley writes:\n\nThere are many magical teachers but in recorded history we have scarcely had a dozen Magi in the technical sense of the word. They may be recognized by the fact that their message may be formulated as a single word, which word must be such that it overturns all existing beliefs and codes. We may take as instances the Word of Buddha—\"Anatta\" (absence of an atman or soul) [...] Mohammed, again, with the single word \"Allah\" [...] Similarly, Aiwass, uttering the word \"Thelema\" (with all its implications), destroys completely the formula of the Dying God.\n\nThe state of being a Magus is described in Crowley's \"Liber B vel Magi\". Elsewhere, he admits the possibility of someone reaching this rank without uttering a new magick Word. Such a Magus, he says, would identify himself or herself with the Word of the current Aeon and work to establish it. In \"Magick Without Tears\", Crowley suggests (without actually saying so) that the Secret Chiefs of the A∴A∴ have reached at least the rank of Magus, in some sense. \n\nThe state of Ipsissimus is the very highest possible (symbolized by the sphere of Kether on the Tree of Life). Relatively little is openly written of this state of enlightenment\n\nThe Ipsissimus is wholly free from all limitations whatsoever, existing in the nature of all things without discriminations of quantity or quality between them. He has identified Being and not-Being and Becoming, action and non-action and tendency to action, with all other such triplicities, not distinguishing between them in respect of any conditions, or between any one thing and any other thing as to whether it is with or without conditions.\n<br><br>\nHe is sworn to accept this Grade in the presence of a witness, and to express its nature in word and deed, but to withdraw Himself at once within the veils of his natural manifestation as a man, and to keep silence during his human life as to the fact of his attainment, even to the other members of the Order.\n<br><br>\nThe Ipsissimus is pre-eminently the Master of all modes of existence; that is, his being is entirely free from internal or external necessity. His work is to destroy all tendencies to construct or to cancel such necessities. He is the Master of the Law of Unsubstantiality (Anatta).\"\n<br><br>\nThe Ipsissimus has no relation as such with any Being: He has no will in any direction, and no Consciousness of any kind involving duality, for in Him all is accomplished; as it is written 'beyond the Word and the Fool, yea, beyond the Word and the Fool'.\"\n\n\n"}
