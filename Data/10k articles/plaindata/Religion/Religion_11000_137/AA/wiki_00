{"id": "2345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2345", "title": "Archbishop of Canterbury", "text": "Archbishop of Canterbury\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury is the senior bishop and principal leader of the Church of England, the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion and the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Canterbury. The current archbishop is Justin Welby, who was enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral on 21 March 2013. Welby is the 105th in a line which goes back more than 1400 years to Augustine of Canterbury, the \"Apostle to the English\", sent from Rome in the year 597. Welby succeeded Rowan Williams.\n\nFrom the time of Augustine until the 16th century, the Archbishops of Canterbury were in full communion with the See of Rome and usually received the pallium from the Pope. During the English Reformation, the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Catholic Church. Thomas Cranmer became the first Protestant holder of the office in 1533, while Reginald Pole was the last Catholic in the position, serving from 1556 to 1558 during the Counter-Reformation. In the Middle Ages there was considerable variation in the methods of nomination of the Archbishop of Canterbury and other bishops. At various times the choice was made by the canons of Canterbury Cathedral, the Pope, or the King of England. Since the English Reformation, the Church of England has been more explicitly a state church and the choice is legally that of the Crown; today it is made by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister, who receives a shortlist of two names from an \"ad hoc\" committee called the Crown Nominations Commission.\n\nToday the archbishop fills four main roles:\n\n\nIn the last two of these functions, he has an important ecumenical and interfaith role, speaking on behalf of Anglicans in England and worldwide.\n\nThe archbishop's main residence is Lambeth Palace in the London Borough of Lambeth. He also has lodgings in the Old Palace, Canterbury, located beside Canterbury Cathedral, where the Chair of St Augustine sits.\n\nAs holder of one of the \"five great sees\" (the others being York, London, Durham and Winchester), the Archbishop of Canterbury is \"ex officio\" one of the Lords Spiritual of the House of Lords. He is one of the highest-ranking men in England and the highest ranking non-royal in the United Kingdom's order of precedence.\n\nSince Henry VIII broke with Rome, the Archbishops of Canterbury have been selected by the English (British since the Act of Union in 1707) monarch. Since the 20th century, the appointment of Archbishops of Canterbury conventionally alternates between Anglo-Catholics and Evangelicals.\n\nThe current archbishop, Justin Welby, the 105th Archbishop of Canterbury, was enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral on 4 February 2013. As archbishop he signs himself as \"+ Justin Cantuar\". His predecessor, Rowan Williams, 104th Archbishop of Canterbury, was enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral on 27 February 2003. Immediately prior to his appointment to Canterbury, Williams was the Bishop of Monmouth and Archbishop of Wales. On 18 March 2012, Williams announced he would be stepping down as Archbishop of Canterbury at the end of 2012 to become Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge.\n\nIn addition to his office, the archbishop also holds a number of other positions; for example, he is Joint President of the Council of Christians and Jews in the United Kingdom. Some positions he formally holds \"ex officio\" and others virtually so (the incumbent of the day, although appointed personally, is appointed because of his office). Amongst these are:\n\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury is also a president of Churches Together in England (an ecumenical organisation). Geoffrey Fisher, 99th Archbishop of Canterbury, was the first since 1397 to visit Rome, where he held private talks with Pope John XXIII in 1960. In 2005, Rowan Williams became the first Archbishop of Canterbury to attend a papal funeral since the Reformation. He also attended the inauguration of Pope Benedict XVI. The 101st archbishop, Donald Coggan, was the first to attend a papal inauguration, that of Pope John Paul II in 1978.\n\nSince 2002, the Archbishop of Canterbury has co-sponsored the Alexandria Middle East Peace process with the Grand Mufti of Egypt. In July 2008, the archbishop attended a conference of Christians, Jews and Muslims convened by the King of Saudi Arabia at which the notion of the \"clash of civilizations\" was rejected. Delegates agreed \"on international guidelines for dialogue among the followers of religions and cultures.\" Delegates said that \"the deepening of moral values and ethical principles, which are common denominators among such followers, would help strengthen stability and achieve prosperity for all humans.\"\n\nIt has been suggested that the Roman province of Britannia had four archbishops, seated at Londinium (London), Eboracum (York), Lindum Colonia (Lincoln) and Corinium Dobunnorum (Cirencester). However, in the 5th and 6th centuries Britannia began to be overrun by pagan, Germanic peoples who came to be known collectively as the Anglo-Saxons. Of the kingdoms they created, Kent arguably had the closest links with European politics, trade and culture, because it was conveniently situated for communication with continental Europe. In the late 6th century, King Æthelberht of Kent married a Christian Frankish princess named Bertha, possibly before becoming king, and certainly a number of years before the arrival of the first Christian mission to England. He permitted the preaching of Christianity.\n\nThe first Archbishop of Canterbury was St Augustine (not to be confused with St Augustine of Hippo), who arrived in Kent in 597 AD, having been sent by Pope Gregory I on a mission to the English. He was accepted by King Æthelbert, on his conversion to Christianity, about the year 598. It seems that Pope Gregory, ignorant of recent developments in the former Roman province, including the spread of the Pelagian heresy, had intended the new archiepiscopal sees for England to be established in London and York. In the event, Canterbury was chosen instead of London, owing to political circumstances. Since then the Archbishops of Canterbury have been referred to as occupying the Chair of St. Augustine.\n\nA Gospel Book believed to be directly associated with St Augustine's mission survives in the Parker Library, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge University, England. Catalogued as Cambridge \"Manuscript 286\", it has been positively dated to 6th century Italy and this bound book, the St Augustine Gospels, is still used during the swearing-in ceremony of new archbishops of Canterbury.\n\nBefore the break with papal authority in the 16th century, the Church of England was an integral part of the Western European church. Since the break the Church of England, an established national church, still considers itself part of the broader Western Catholic tradition (although this is not accepted by the Roman Catholic Church which regards Anglicanism as schismatic and does not accept Anglican holy orders as valid) as well as being the \"mother church\" of the worldwide Anglican Communion.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury exercises metropolitical (or supervisory) jurisdiction over the Province of Canterbury, which encompasses thirty of the forty-two dioceses of the Church of England, with the rest falling within the Province of York. The four dioceses of Wales were formerly also under the Province of Canterbury until 1920 when they were transferred from the established Church of England to the disestablished Church in Wales.\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury has a ceremonial provincial \"curia\", or court, consisting of some of the senior bishops of his province. The Bishop of London—the most senior cleric of the church with the exception of the two archbishops—serves as Canterbury's provincial dean, the Bishop of Winchester as chancellor, the Bishop of Lincoln as vice-chancellor, the Bishop of Salisbury as precentor, the Bishop of Worcester as chaplain and the Bishop of Rochester as cross-bearer.\n\nAlong with primacy over the Archbishop of York, the Archbishop of Canterbury also has a precedence of honour over the other bishops of the Anglican Communion. He is recognised as \"primus inter pares\", or first amongst equals. He does not, however, exercise any direct authority in the provinces outside England, except in certain minor roles dictated by Canon in those provinces (for example, he is the judge in the event of an ecclesiastical prosecution against the Archbishop of Wales). He does hold metropolitical authority over several extra-provincial Anglican churches, and he serves as \"ex officio\" Bishop of the Falkland Islands.\n\nAt present the archbishop has three suffragan bishops:\n\n\nThe Bishop of Maidstone was previously a second \"actual\" suffragan bishop working in the diocese, until it was decided at the diocesan synod of November 2010 that a new bishop will not be appointed.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York are both styled as \"The Most Reverend\"; retired archbishops are styled as \"The Right Reverend\". Archbishops are, by convention, appointed to the Privy Council and may, therefore, also use the style of \"The Right Honourable\" for life (unless they are later removed from the council). In formal documents, the Archbishop of Canterbury is referred to as \"The Most Reverend Forenames, by Divine Providence Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England and Metropolitan\". In debates in the House of Lords, the archbishop is referred to as \"The Most Reverend Primate, the Archbishop of Canterbury\". \"The Right Honourable\" is not used in either instance. He may also be formally addressed as \"Your Grace\"—or, more often these days, simply as \"Archbishop\", or \"Father\".\n\nThe surname of the Archbishop of Canterbury is not always used in formal documents; often only the first name and see are mentioned. The archbishop is legally entitled to sign his name as \"Cantuar\" (from the Latin for Canterbury). The right to use a title as a legal signature is only permitted to bishops, Peers of the Realm and peers by courtesy. The current Archbishop of Canterbury usually signs as \"+Justin Cantuar:\".\n\nIn the English and Welsh order of precedence, the Archbishop of Canterbury is ranked above all individuals in the realm, with the exception of the Sovereign and members of the Royal Family. Immediately below him is the Lord Chancellor and then the Archbishop of York.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury awards academic degrees, commonly called \"Lambeth degrees\".\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury's official residence in London is Lambeth Palace.\nHe also has a residence, named The Old Palace, next to Canterbury Cathedral on the site of the medieval Archbishop's Palace.\nThe archbishops had palaces on the periphery of London and on the route between London and Canterbury.\n\nFormer palaces of the archbishops include\n\nSince 1900, the following have served as Archbishop of Canterbury:\n\n\n\n"}

He has hair and a beard made from living grass, and is sometimes depicted with a tail, hooves, and horns. Archura has a close bond with the gray wolf (Turkish: Bozkurt). Legend describes him as having a red scarf and his left shoe on his right foot. He also had no shadow.\n\nArchura protects the animals and birds in the forest and tells them when to migrate. He can shapeshift into many different forms. As a human, he looks like a peasant with glowing eyes.\n\nArchuras are terribly mischievous beings: they have horrible cries, and can imitate voices of people familiar to wanderers and lure them back to their caves, where the Archuras will tickle them to death; they also remove signs from their posts. They aren't evil: although they enjoy misguiding humans and kidnapping young women, they are also known to keep grazing cattle from wandering too far into the forests and getting lost. Sometimes more than one Archura inhabits a forest, and then they will fight for their territory, knocking down trees and scaring animals.\n\nThere are two different kinds of Chura.

As with conspiracy theories surrounding his citizenship status, the claims are promoted by various fringe theorists and political opponents, with American bloggers and conservative talk radio hosts particularly promoting the theories.\n\nBelief in these claims in the public sphere endured and, in some cases, even expanded during Obama's presidency according to the Pew Research Center, with 17% of Americans (including one third of conservative Republicans) believing him to be a Muslim in a 2012 poll.\n\nBarack Obama is a Protestant Christian. While in his twenties, Obama was involved with the Black churches. From 1992 until 2008, he was a member of the Trinity United Church of Christ—a Reformed denomination. Obama left it in the wake of the Jeremiah Wright controversy. Since 2008, he attends various Protestant churches, including Baptist, Methodist and Episcopalian churches.\n\nObama was baptized into the United Church of Christ (UCC) denomination and formally joined it in 1988. He left the UCC in 2008 because of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright controversy. He now worships with a Southern Baptist pastor at Camp David but has not become a formal member of any church since 2008.\n\nThough Obama is a practicing Christian and he was chiefly raised by his mother and her Christian parents, his father, Barack Obama, Sr., with whom he lived only as a baby, he characterized as a Muslim-raised atheist, and his stepfather, Lolo Soetoro, with whom he lived during his early childhood, was nominally Muslim. This familial connection to Islam, among other things, is a basis of claims that Obama secretly practices Islam.\n\nAccording to the \"Los Angeles Times\", false rumors saying that Obama was secretly a Muslim started during his campaign for the United States Senate in 2004 and had expanded through viral e-mails by 2006. The \"Times\" compared these rumors to earlier false rumors about 2000 presidential candidate John McCain fathering a dark-skinned child out of wedlock. The rumors were subsequently promoted by conservative talk show hosts, including Michael Savage.\n\nIn December 2007 the Hillary Clinton campaign asked a volunteer county coordinator to step down after she forwarded an e-mail message which repeated the false rumor that Obama was Muslim. In June 2008, New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, himself Jewish, spoke out to Jewish voters in Florida against false e-mail rumors which said that Obama was secretly a Muslim and did not support Israel. Bloomberg said: \"I hope all of you will join me throughout this campaign in strongly speaking out against this fear mongering, no matter who you'll be voting for.\"\n\nIn 2015, Taha al-Lahibi, a former member of the Iraqi parliament known for promoting fringe conspiracy theories, claimed that Obama was \"the son of a Shiite Kenyan father.\" These unfounded claims do not have broad support among Iraqis, and al-Lahibi's claim prompted mockery.\n\nA chain e-mail circulating during the presidential campaign claimed that Obama took his oath of office as a U.S. Senator in 2005 while placing his hand on a Qur'an rather than a Bible. This claim is false, as Obama was sworn into office using a Bible that he owned. The claim may have been inspired by a photo-op re-enactment of the 2007 swearing-in of U.S. Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, who used a Qur'an that had belonged to Thomas Jefferson.\n\nAn early version of a rumor that Obama had \"spent at least four years in a so-called \"madrassa\", or Muslim seminary, in Indonesia\" appeared in an article published by \"Insight on the News\", a magazine published by News World Communications, an international media conglomerate then owned by the Unification Church. \"Insight on the News\" ceased publication soon after the incident. Its editor, Jeff Kuhner, claimed that a person working for the Clinton campaign had told him that the campaign was \"preparing an accusation that her rival Senator Barack Obama had covered up a brief period he had spent in an Islamic religious school in Indonesia when he was six\". Senator Clinton denied the allegations. When interviewed by \"The New York Times\", Kuhner did not name the person said to be his reporter's source.\n\nObama attended two schools during the four years he lived in Indonesia as a child (1967–1971). From the first grade until some time in the third grade he attended the Roman Catholic St. Francis Assisi School, where classes began and ended each day with Christian prayers. He was registered there as Muslim because of his stepfather's nominal religion. At some point during the third grade he transferred to State Elementary School Menteng 01, also known as Besuki School, for less than a year. Besuki is a secular public school. Students there wear Western clothing, and the \"Chicago Tribune\" described the school as \"so progressive that teachers wore miniskirts and all students were encouraged to celebrate Christmas\".\n\nSoon after \"Insight\"s story, CNN reporter John Vause visited State Elementary School Menteng 01 and found that each student received two hours of religious instruction per week in his or her own faith. Hardi Priyono, the deputy headmaster of the school told Vause: \"This is a public school. We don't focus on religion. In our daily lives, we try to respect religion, but we don't give preferential treatment.\"\n\nInterviews by Nedra Pickler of the Associated Press found that students of all faiths have been welcome there since before Obama's attendance. Akmad Solichin, the vice-principal of the school, told Pickler: \"The allegations are completely baseless. Yes, most of our students are Muslim, but there are Christians as well. Everyone's welcome here ... it's a public school.\"\n\nOne chain e-mail claimed incorrectly that President Obama's middle name is Mohammed or Muhammed. His actual middle name is Hussein.\n\nPublic opinion surveys carried out, beginning in 2008, have shown that a number of Americans believe that Obama is a Muslim. In March 2008, a survey conducted by Pew Research Center found that 10% of respondents believed that rumor. Those who were more likely to believe he is a Muslim included political conservatives (both Republicans and Democrats), people who had not attended college, people who lived in the Midwest or the South, and people in rural areas.\n\nA study conducted by the University of Georgia found that the percentage of Americans who believed that Obama is a Muslim remained constant at approximately 20% in September, October, and November 2008, despite frequent attempts by the media as well as the Obama campaign to correct this misconception. However, the study also showed that some people who had initially believed Obama to be a Christian later believed the rumor that he is a Muslim. The survey found that respondents who had shifted to the misconception were generally younger, less politically involved, less educated, more conservative, and more likely to believe in Biblical literalism. According to Professor Barry Hollander, \"These are groups of people who are generally distrustful of the mainstream media...So therefore journalists telling them that this is not true could actually have the opposite effect and make them more likely to believe the rumor.\"\n\nIn August 2010, a Pew Research poll showed that 18% of Americans and 30% of Republicans believed that Obama is a Muslim.\n\nIn 2012, data from the aforementioned Pew Center found that the popularity of the misinformation had increased in some groups. Specifically, over one in seven Americans (including one third of conservative Republicans) labeled the President a Muslim. Haris Tarin of the Muslim Public Affairs Council remarked that the survey \"shows there's a lot of fear-mongering and politicking in America\".\n\nBarack Obama has publicly responded to questions regarding his religion on more than one occasion. During a debate of Democratic presidential candidates on January 15, 2008, in Las Vegas, Nevada, the moderator, Brian Williams, asked Obama about the rumor that he was \"trying to hide the fact that he is a Muslim\". Obama responded that \"the facts are: I am a Christian. I have been sworn in [to the US Senate] with a Bible.\" He then said \"in the Internet age, there are going to be lies that are spread all over the place. I have been victimized by these lies.\"\n\nOn June 4, 2009, Barack Obama delivered a speech at Cairo University titled \"A New Beginning\". The entire speech was recorded by C-SPAN. During his speech to the largely Muslim audience, Obama declared, \"I’m a Christian.\"\n\nIn an interview with NBC journalist Brian Williams on August 29, 2010, Williams asked Obama about a poll that said that 20% of the American public do not believe that he is a Christian or American born. Obama gave a similar answer to the one he gave in the January 2008 debate. During the 2011 National Prayer Breakfast, the President stated, \"My Christian faith then has been a sustaining force for me over these last few years, all the more so when Michelle and I hear our faith questioned from time to time\".\n\nIn addition to Obama's personal responses, the 2008 Obama presidential campaign responded to the false claims made against him by people opposed to his candidacy by launching a website called \"FightTheSmears.com\". One of the false claims countered by the website is that he is a Muslim and not a Christian.\n\nIn October 2010 the White House announced that it was cancelling a stop at the Golden Temple during Obama's trip to India. The decision to cancel was received with disappointment by the Sikh community, and it was speculated that the decision was in response to a photo that was circulated during the 2008 campaign of Obama wearing Kenyan traditional wardrobe during a 2006 trip to Kenya. The 2006 photo was used to raise doubts about Obama's religion.\n\nDuring the 2008 presidential campaign, one chain e-mail accused Barack Obama of secretly being the biblical Antichrist, saying:\nAccording to The Book of Revelations the anti-christ is: The anti-christ will be a man, in his 40s, of MUSLIM descent, who will deceive the nations with persuasive language, and have a MASSIVE Christ-like appeal...the prophecy says that people will flock to him and he will promise false hope and world peace, and when he is in power, he will destroy everything is it OBAMA?\n\nPolitiFact.com has analyzed the elements in this false claim and debunked each one: The word \"Antichrist\" does not appear in the Book of Revelation (though it does appear in 1 John and 2 John); the Book of Revelation instead refers to The Beast. The Book of Revelation never mentions the Beast's age, nor does it include any references to \"Muslim descent\", as the religion of Islam was not founded until hundreds of years after the book was written.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1639690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1639690", "title": "Bhagavata", "text": "Bhagavata\n\nIn Hinduism a Bhagavata (a \"vrddhi\" formation from \"Bhagavanta\", meaning \"devotee of \"Bhagavanta\"\", the Lord, i.e. God), is a devotee, worshipper or follower of \"Bhagavanta\" namely God in his personal aspect. The form of worship is called \"bhakti\" which has the meaning of 'adoration'. In Sanskrit language 'Bhaga' stands for desire as well as vagina, 'antha' stands for the end. Hence \"Bhagavanta\" or \"Bhagavan\" means 'the one beyond desire or rebirth', whereas \"Bhagavata\" indicates a worshiper of this purified and persistent entity. It also refers to a tradition devoted to worship of Krishna, later assimilated into the concept of Narayana where Krishna is conceived as \"svayam bhagavan\". According to some historical scholars, worship of Krishna emerged in the 1st century BC. However, Vaishnava traditionalists place it in the 4th century BC. Despite relative silence of the earlier Vedic sources, the features of Bhagavatism and principles of monotheism of Bhagavata school unfolding described in the Bhagavad Gita as viewed as an example of the belief that Vasudeva-Krishna is not an avatar of the Vedic Vishnu, but is the Supreme.\n\nIn the ninth century CE \"Bhagavatism\" was already at least a millennium old and many disparate groups, all following the \"Bhagavata Purana\" could be found. Various lineages of \"Gopala\" worshipers developed into identifiable denominations. However, the unity that exists among these groups in belief and practice has given rise to the general term \"Krishnaism\". Today the faith has a significant following outside of India as well. Many places associated with \"Krishna\" such as \"Vrindavan\" attract millions of pilgrims each year who participate in religious festivals that recreate scenes from \"Krishna's\" life on Earth. Some believe that early Bhagavatism was enriched and transformed with powerful and popular Krishna tradition with a strong \"human\" element to it.\n\nIt is believed that Bhagavatas borrowed or shared the attribute or title Purusa of their monotheistic deity from the philosophy of Sankhya. The philosophy was formulated by the end of the 4th century BC and as time went other names such as Narayana were applied to the main deity of Krishna-\"Vāsudeva\".\n\nSome relate absorption by Brahmanism to be the characteristic of the second stage of the development of the Bhagavata tradition. It is believed that at this stage Krishna-\"Vāsudeva\" was identified with the deity of Vishnu, that according to some belonged to the pantheon of Brahmanism.\nRulers onwards from Chandragupta II, Vikramaditya were known as parama Bhagavatas, or Bhagavata Vaishnavas. The Bhagavata Purana entails the fully developed tenets and philosophy of the Bhagavata cult whereis Krishna gets fused with Vasudeva and transcends Vedic Vishnu and cosmic Hari to be turned into the ultimate object of bhakti.\n\nReferences to \"Vāsudeva\" also occur in early Sanskrit literature. Taittiriya Aranyaka (X, i,6) identifies him with \"Narayana\" and \"Vishnu\". Pāṇini, ca. 4th century BCE, in his Ashtadhyayi explains the word \"Vāsudevaka\" as a \"Bhakta\" (devotee) of Vāsudeva. At some stage during the Vedic period, Vasudeva and Krishna became one deity or three distinct deities Vasudeva-Krishna, Krishna-Gopala and Narayana, all become identified with Vishnu. and by the time of composition of the redaction of Mahabharata that survives till today.\n\nA Gupta period research makes a \"clear mention of Vasudeva as the exclusive object of worship of a group of people\", who are referred as bhagavatas.\n\nAccording to an opinion of some scholars in Patanjali's time identification of Krishna with Vasudeva is an established fact as is surmised from a passage of the Mahabhasya – (\"jaghana kamsam kila vasudevah\"). This \"supposed earliest phase is though to have been established from the sixth to the fifth centuries BCE at the time of Pāṇini, who in his Astadhyayi explained the word \"vasudevaka\" as a bhakta, devotee, of Vasudeva and its believed that Bhagavata religion with the worship od Vasudeva Krishna were at the root of the Vaishnavism in Indian history.\"\n\nIn the recent times this often refer to a particular sect of Vaishnavas in West India, referring to themselves as 'Bhagavata-sampradaya'.\n\nIt is also a common greeting among the followers of Ramanujacharya and other yoga sects.\n\nConstant Satsanga with devotees and Bhagavatas, repetition of His Name, Sri Ram, Sita Ram, Hari Om, etc., constant remembrance of the Lord, prayer, study of religious books such as the Ramayana, the Bhagavata, Hari Kirtan, service of ... It can also be spelled 'Bhagavats' and refer to a Buddhist concept.\n\nBhagavata Sampradaaya is a very old vedic tradition that respects all the darshana shastras & siddantas. It is neutral to any particular practices like only Vaishnava, Smarta, Shakta, Gaanapatya, Saura etc., And instructs to practice the rituals that is in accordance with Vedas. Some of the practices of this Sampradaaya are continuous study of Vedas, all time chanting of Gayatri, Nitya Agni Upaasana, Atiti Satkaara, Vaishwadeva, Pancha Yagnas, Daana-Dharma, Simpleness, humbleness, socially accepted life style, Sachitdananda Dhyana, leaving egotism, Sarva samarpana Bhaava of one's own Sampat-Bhakti-Punya Karma-Knowledge.

His work was informed by his Catholicism, his background in science and philosophy, and his connection to surrealism. He was close to an intellectual European Catholic tradition and mainstream Irish Catholic culture. Two of his long poems, \"Advent\" (1975) and \"Death of Hektor\" (1979), were widely considered to be important works in the canon of Irish poetic modernism. He also ran Advent, a small press, during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nCoffey was born in Dublin in the suburb of Dún Laoghaire. He attended the Mount St Benedict boarding school in Gorey, County Wexford from 1917 to 1919 and then James Joyce's old school, Clongowes Wood College, in Clane, County Kildare, from 1919 until 1922. In 1923, he went to France to study for a Bachelor's degree in Classical Studies at the Institution St Vincent, Senlis, Oise.\n\nHis father, Denis Coffey, was a professor of anatomy who served as the first president of University College Dublin (UCD) from 1908 to 1940. Coffey entered UCD in 1924 and earned advanced degrees in mathematics, physics and chemistry. He also represented the college in boxing tournaments.\n\nWhile still at college, Coffey began writing poetry. He published his first poems in UCD's \"The National Student\" under the pseudonym Coeuvre. These poems, which have never been collected, showed the influence of French Symbolism and of TS Eliot. During this time Coffey met Denis Devlin and together they published a volume entitled \"Poems\" in 1930. Coffey and Devlin both also participated in college dramatics, taking roles in French plays.\n\nIn the early 1930s, Coffey moved to Paris, where he studied Physical Chemistry under Jean Baptiste Perrin, who had won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1926. He completed these studies in 1933, and his \"Three Poems\" was printed in Paris by Jeanette Monnier that same year, as was the poem card \"Yuki Hira\", which was admired by George William Russell and William Butler Yeats. He also became friendly with other Irish writers based in the city, including Thomas MacGreevy and Samuel Beckett. In his 1934 essay \"Recent Irish Poetry\", Beckett picked out Coffey and Devlin as forming 'the nucleus of a living poetic in Ireland'.\n\nHe entered the Institut Catholique de Paris that year to work with the noted French philosopher Jacques Maritain, taking his licentiate examination in 1936. He then moved to London for a time and contributed reviews and a poem to Eliot's \"Criterion\" magazine. On trips home to Dublin, he contributed to programmes on literary topics on RTÉ radio and published poems in \"Ireland Today\".\n\nHe returned to Paris in 1937 as an exchange student to work on his doctoral thesis on the idea of order in the work of Thomas Aquinas. In 1938, Coffey's second volume of poetry, \"Third Person\", was published by George Reavey's Europa Press. He also contributed translations to the same publisher's \"Thorns of Thunder\" (1936), the first collection of Paul Éluard's work published in English. The poems of this period saw Coffey shake off his earlier influences and begin to find his own voice but, for a variety of reasons, \"Third Person\" was to be his last poetry publication for a quarter of a century.\n\nDuring the war, Coffey taught in schools in London and Yorkshire, leaving his young family in Dublin. After the war, he returned to Paris and completed his doctoral thesis. The family then moved so Coffey could take up a teaching post at the Jesuit Saint Louis University. During this period, Coffey seems to have done very little, if any, creative writing as he focused mainly on philosophical work based on his thesis, publishing a number of essays in \"The Modern Schoolman\".\n\nBy the early 1950s, Coffey had become uncomfortable for a number of reasons, including the nature of his work, his distance from Ireland and the pressures that inevitably came to bear on an academic who had previously associated with well-known left-wing writers in Paris. For these reasons, he began to look for a suitable opportunity to leave the United States and resigned, possibly on a matter of academic principle, in 1952.\n\nIn 1952, Coffey returned to live in London and, from 1973, Southampton. He began again to publish his poetry and translations, mainly of French poetry. The first work in English to appear after this period of silence was \"Missouri Sequence\", apparently begun in St. Louis but first appearing in the \"University Review\" in 1962. This poem deals with the experience of exile, memories of the poet's dead parents and the premature birth of a child. It is written in a much more conventional syntax than most of Coffey's work and, thanks to this greater accessibility, is one of his most widely read works.\n\nOver the next decade or so, he published regularly in the \"University Review\" (later known as the \"Irish University Review\"), a relationship that culminated in the 1975 special issue. This featured an introduction by Dr JCC Mays, a selection of translations from French, the satire \"Leo\" and \"Advent\", a meditation on death inspired by the death of the poet's son in a motorcycle accident. The poem is in seven sections, based, according to Coffey, in an interview with Parkman Howe on the canonical hours of the Catholic Church.\n\nAnother key work of this period was \"Death of Hektor\", which uses the myth of Troy as a framework for a meditation on war and its victims. The trade editions of \"Advent\" and \"Death of Hektor\" were both published by the Menard Press. He also edited Devlin's \"Collected Poems\", first for a \"University Review\" Devlin special issue and later as a book from Dolmen Press.\n\nHe also set up his own publishing enterprise, Advent Press, which published work by himself and by younger writers he wanted to support. He learned printmaking and produced a good deal of original work, including an interesting set of images based on the plays of his old friend Beckett. His interest in visual art also led to some experiments in concrete poetry, most notably his 1966 Advent Press book \"Monster: A Concrete Poem\". His work was championed by a number of younger Irish poets, especially Michael Smith and Trevor Joyce. These two published poetry, prose and translations by Coffey in their journal \"The Lace Curtain\", and his \"Selected Poems\" (1971), under their New Writers Press imprint. This book was instrumental in helping establish his reputation as a leading Irish exponent of modernist poetry.\n\nThe appearance in 1991 of a major selection \"Poems and Versions 1929–1990\" and his translations \"Poems from Mallarmé\" helped confirm his status as one of the leading Irish modernists. He died at the age of 89 and was buried in Southampton, England.\n\nPoetry\n\n\nPhilosophy and criticism\n\n\nAs editor\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\nOnline\n"}

The only people allowed to enter the temple, be married there, or attend these weddings are those who hold an official temple recommend. Obtaining a temple recommend requires one to abide by LDS Church doctrine and be interviewed and considered worthy by their bishop and stake president. A prerequisite to contracting a celestial marriage, in addition to obtaining a temple recommend, involves undergoing the temple endowment, which involves making of certain covenants with God. \n\nIn particular, one is expected to promise to be obedient to all the Lord's commandments including living a clean chaste life, abstaining oneself from any impure thing, willing to sacrifice and consecrate all that one has for the Lord. In the marriage ceremony a man and a woman make covenants to God and to each other and are said to be sealed as husband and wife for time and all eternity. Mormonism, citing and , distinguishes itself on this point from some other religious traditions by emphasizing that marriage relationships and covenants made in this life in the temple will continue to be valid in the next life if they abide by these covenants.\n\nIn the 19th century, the term \"celestial marriage\" usually referred to the practice of plural marriage, a practice which the LDS Church formally abandoned in 1890. The term is still used in this sense by Mormon fundamentalists not affiliated with the LDS Church.\n\nIn the LDS Church today, both men and women may enter a celestial marriage with only one living partner at a time. A man may be sealed to more than one woman. If his wife dies, he may enter another celestial marriage, and be sealed to both his living wife and deceased wife or wives. Many Mormons believe that all these marriages will be valid in the eternities and the husband will live together in the celestial kingdom as a family with all to whom he was sealed. In 1998, the LDS Church changed the policy and now also allows women to be sealed to more than one man. A woman, however, may not be sealed to more than one man at a time while she is alive. She may only be sealed to subsequent partners after she has died. Proxy sealings, like proxy baptisms, are merely \"offered\" to the person in the afterlife. According to church teachings, the celestial marriage covenant, as with other covenants, requires the continued righteousness of the couple to remain in effect after this life. If only one remains righteous that person is promised a righteous eternal companion in eternity.\n\nIn , Jesus is asked about the continuing state of marriage after death and he affirms that at the resurrection \"people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.\" Mormons do not interpret Jesus' statement as meaning \"that marriages will not \"exist\" after the Resurrection, but that marriages will not be \"performed\" after the Resurrection; for all questions of marital status must be settled before that time.\" Thus, Mormons believe that only mortals can be the subject of an eternal marriage ordinance; mortals may receive the ordinance for themselves or by proxy for those who have already died. \n\nCelestial marriage is an instance of the LDS Church doctrine of sealing. Following a celestial marriage, not only are the couple sealed as husband and wife, but children born into the marriage are also sealed to that family. In cases where the husband and wife have been previously married civilly and there are already children from their union, the children accompany their parents to the temple and are sealed to their parents following the marriage ceremony.\n\nMormons believe that through this sealing, man, wife and children will live together forever, if obedient to God's commandments.\n\nThere is substantial doctrinal dispute between the LDS Church and its offshoots as to whether celestial marriage is plural or monogamous sealings for \"time and eternity\" (i.e., celestial marriages) were being performed for monogamous couples long before 1890. Throughout all time periods of the LDS Church's history, the great majority of temple sealings were between one man and one wife.\n\nSome argue that the official Mormon scripture, Doctrine and Covenants section 132, which describes celestial marriage, specifies that only plural marriages qualify. Others argue that the text indicates \"a wife\", which would mean that any temple sealing ordinance of marriage could qualify. The latter view is supported by the official \"History of the Church\", which indicates that marriage for eternity was monogamous except in \"some circumstances\":\n\n[I]t is borne in mind that at this time the new law of marriage for the Church—marriage for eternity, \"including plurality of wives under some circumstances\"—was being introduced by the Prophet [Joseph Smith], it is very likely that the following article was written with a view of applying the principles here expounded to the conditions created by introducing said marriage system.\n\nIn the following quote, apostle Lorenzo Snow, who later became president of the LDS Church, refers to \"celestial plural marriage\" rather than simply \"celestial marriage\":\n\nHe knew the voice of God—he knew the commandment of the Almighty to him was to go forward—to set the example, and establish Celestial plural marriage. He knew that he had not only his own prejudices and pre-possessions to combat and to overcome, but those of the whole Christian world...; but God ... had given the commandment. Nevertheless, it is correct that \"celestial marriage\" was often used to refer to plural marriage.\n\nMormon fundamentalists cleave to the view that there is no celestial marriage that is not plural, while the LDS Church claims otherwise. As viewed by the LDS Church, plural marriages in the early church, when properly authorized and conducted, were, in fact, celestial marriages; but celestial marriages need not be plural marriages. In addition, since celestial marriages must be performed by someone with proper priesthood authority, and since plural marriage is no longer authorized by the LDS Church, no authorized celestial plural marriages can be performed today. Mormon fundamentalists argue, in return, that they have retained the priesthood authority to perform these marriages.\n\nA concept of celestial marriage was described by Emanuel Swedenborg as early as 1749. Swedenborg's Latin term \"conjugium coeleste\" was translated as \"celestial marriage\" by John Clowes in 1782. Two more recent translators have preferred the term \"heavenly marriage.\" In all his authoritative writing, Swedenborg only mentions the term \"celestial marriage\" twice.\n\nSwedenborg defined the celestial marriage or heavenly marriage as the marriage of love with wisdom or of goodness with truth. He wrote, \"Truth and good joined together is what is called the celestial marriage, which constitutes heaven itself with a person.\" Swedenborg does not use \"celestial marriage\" to refer to the marriage of husband and wife, although he says that the marriage of husband and wife has its origin in the heavenly or celestial marriage of goodness and truth.\n\nAccording to Swedenborg, true married love forms an eternal bond, an actual joining together of minds, so that married partners who truly love each other are not separated by death but continue to be married to eternity. He writes that this love is \"celestial, spiritual, holy pure and clean above every love which exists from the Lord with angels of heaven and people in the church.\" None can come into this love, he says, but those who are monogamous and \"who go to the Lord and love the truths of the church and do the good things it teaches.\"\n\nCraig Miller has investigated the possibility that Swedenborg influenced Joseph Smith, as there are similarities between some of their teachings. He concludes that Smith may have learned something about Swedenborg through third parties, but was unlikely to have read much if any of Swedenborg's works for himself. Among Smith's connections was Sarah Cleveland, who was married to a Swedenborgian at the time of her plural marriage to Smith in 1842. It was shortly afterwards, in July 1843, that Smith recorded receiving a revelation regarding eternal marriage in Doctrine and Covenants 132.\n\n\n\n"}

Various denominations of Christianity have differing worldviews on some issues based on biblical interpretation, but many thematic elements are commonly agreed-upon within the Christian worldview. A common theme is the distrust of secular authority.\n\nAccording to Leo Apostel, a worldview is an ontology, or a descriptive model of the world. It should comprise these six elements:\n\nDifferent denominations of Christianity have varying worldviews. There are varieties of particulars within the Christian worldview, and disputes of the meaning of concepts in a Christian worldview. Certain thematic elements are common within the Christian worldview. For instance, Northrop Frye indicated as the central clusters of the system of metaphors in the Bible - mountain, garden, and cave. A similar thematic representation of Christian worldview in the Reformed tradition has been formulated as Creation, Fall, Redemption and Consummation.\n\nThe U.S. use of the term \"worldview\" in Christian rhetoric can be traced to the evangelical Reformed philosopher H. Evan Runner of Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Runner used the term in his evangelical Reformed community in North America, promoting the worldview concept from a philosophical concept to a synonym for \"doctrine.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1311332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1311332", "title": "Christopher Dawson", "text": "Christopher Dawson\n\nChristopher Henry Dawson (12 October 1889, Hay Castle – 25 May 1970, Budleigh Salterton) was a British independent scholar, who wrote many books on cultural history and Christendom. Dawson has been called \"the greatest English-speaking Catholic historian of the twentieth century\". The 1988–1989 academic year at the College of Europe was named in his honour.\n\nDawson was born into family deep roots in the English gentry as the only son of Lt. Colonel H.P. Dawson and Mary Louisa, eldest daughter of Archdeacon Bevan, Hay Castle. He was brought up at Hartlington Hall, Yorkshire. He was educated at Winchester College and Trinity College, Oxford. He obtained 2nd class honours in Modern History at Oxford in 1911. After his degree he studied economics. He also read the work of the German theologian Ernst Troeltsch. His background was Anglo-Catholic but he became a Roman Catholic convert in 1914. In 1916 Dawson married Valery Mills, youngest daughter of the architect Walter Edward Mills. They had two daughters and one son.\n\nHe began publishing articles in \"The Sociological Review\", in 1920. His starting point was close to that of Oswald Spengler and Arnold J. Toynbee, others who were also interested in grand narratives conducted at the level of a civilisation. His first book, \"The Age of the Gods\" (1928), was apparently intended as the first of a set of five to trace European civilisation to the twentieth century, but the schematic plan was not followed to a conclusion.\n\nHis general point of view is as a proponent of an 'Old West' theory, the later term of David Gress, who cites Dawson in his \"From Plato to Nato\" (1998). That is, Dawson rejected the blanket assumption that the Middle Ages in Europe failed to contribute any essential characteristics. He argued that the medieval Catholic Church was an essential factor in the rise of European civilisation, and wrote extensively in support of that thesis.\n\nDawson was considered a leading Catholic historian. He was a Lecturer in the History of Culture, University College, Exeter (1930–6), Forwood Lecturer in the Philosophy of Religion, University of Liverpool (1934), Gifford Lecturer at the University of Edinburgh (1947 and 1948), and Professor of Roman Catholic Studies, Harvard University (1958–62). He was elected as a Fellow of the British Academy in 1943.\n\nFrom 1940 for a period he was editor of the \"Dublin Review\". He was Chauncey Stillman Chair of Roman Catholic Studies at Harvard University from 1958–1962.\n\nHis writings in the 1920s and 1930s made him a significant figure of the time, and an influence in particular on T. S. Eliot, who wrote of his importance. He was on the fringe of 'The Moot', a discussion group involving Eliot, John Baillie, Karl Mannheim, Walter Moberly, Michael Polanyi, Marjorie Reeves, Bernard Lonergan and Alec Vidler; and also the Sword of the Spirit ecumenical group. According to Bradley Birzer, Dawson also influenced the theological underpinnings of J. R. R. Tolkien's writings. Russell Kirk was another who greatly admired Dawson, although the two men never met. The topical approach outlined by Dawson for the study of Christian culture forms the core of the Catholic Studies program at Aquinas College. His work was influential in the founding of Campion College in NSW, Australia, and in the formation in 2012 of The Christopher Dawson Society for Philosophy and Culture Inc. in Perth, Western Australia.\n\nAs a revivalist of the Christian historian, Christopher Dawson has been compared with Kenneth Scott Latourette and Herbert Butterfield.\nComparisons have also been made between the work of Dawson and German sociologist and historian Max Weber. Both employ a metahistorical approach to their subjects, and their subjects themselves bear similarities; namely, the influence of religion on aspects of western culture.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3407481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3407481", "title": "Church of the New Faith", "text": "Church of the New Faith\n\nChurch of the New Faith was a name used by the Church of Scientology in Australia from 1969 until 1983 to avoid laws that restricted or banned the practice of Scientology.\n\nIn 1965 the State of Victoria passed a law, the \"Psychological Practices Act, 1965\", banning the use of the E-meter and teaching Scientology for money. Considering Scientology to be a form of psychology, it required anyone practising psychology to be registered with a newly established Victorian Psychological Council. However, since the Act's definition of psychology was broad enough to include the pastoral counselling traditionally done by priests and ministers of religion, any religious denomination recognised by the Australian government under the federal Marriage Act was exempted from its provisions. The Scientology organisation in Spring Street, Melbourne, closed in response to this law.\n\nSimilar laws were later passed in Western Australia in 1968 (the \"Scientology Act\") and South Australia (the \"Psychological Practices Act\") in 1973. The Church changed its name to \"Church of the New Faith\" and remained active in these two States.\n\nIn November 1968, two Australian Scientologists who had been working at Saint Hill, Ian and Judith Tampion, set up a mission of the Church of the New Faith in an inner suburb of Melbourne. They held meetings and sold books, but Scientologists in Melbourne would travel to Adelaide, South Australia for training.\n\nThe Church of the New Faith was incorporated in Adelaide on 18 June 1969\n\nIn 1972, Western Australia repealed its \"Scientology Act\". In January 1973, the newly elected federal Labor government recognised Scientology as a religious denomination under the Marriage Act, allowing Scientology ministers to conduct marriages and making them effectively exempt from the provisions of Victoria's \"Psychological Practices Act\". The mission in Melbourne now became a fully functional Church offering training and counselling to the public. However, Victoria's law remained active, though the Victorian Scientology organisation was incorporated in South Australia.\n\nIn 1980, the Victorian branch of the Church of the New Faith applied for exemption from payroll tax. (The Church had exemption already in all other states where it operated). The Commissioner of Pay-Roll Tax rejected the application. The Church appealed against the decision, and lost on 18 December 1980. The Church lodged a Victorian Supreme Court appeal against this on 24 February 1981, which the full Supreme Court rejected on 5 May 1982.\n\nAround this time, the Victorian Psychological Practices Act was becoming controversial, and was seen by many to be counter-productive. On 25 February 1981, officials of major religions urged repeal of the Act. Later, leading Churchmen including heads of Theological Colleges had signed a petition: \"to remove all prohibitive sections aimed at members of the Church of Scientology purely on religious grounds. It further asks 'that in future no legislation be passed which discriminates against any minority because of its beliefs'\". \n\nThe Victorian Minister for Health, Tom Roper, explained to the Legislative Assembly that the Act was not being enforced in much of Australia. The Church of Scientology was flourishing in spite of the legislation banning its practice. Roper urged the lawmakers that in the future they shouldn't single out a minority group for legislation \"in the way the Psychological Practices Act discriminates against Scientology.\"\n\nThe Liberal and National Parties did not oppose the Labor Government's action to repeal the Psychological Practices Act. The Act was amended by the \"Psychologists Registration (Scientology) Act, 1982\" to remove all references to Scientology on 24 June 1982 and was repealed in 1987.\n\nThis did not, however, give the Church tax exempt status in Victoria. The Church appealed against the payroll decision to the High Court on 9 November 1982 and the case was accepted. They won the case (\"Church of the New Faith v. Commissioner of Pay-Roll Tax (Victoria)\") in late 1983 and immediately started operating as the Church of Scientology once more, with confirmed status as a tax-exempt religion. Subsequently in 2013, the UK Supreme Court affirmed the religious status of Scientology in that country, and credited the Australian High Court case judgment of Wilson and Deane as the \"most helpful\" of various international cases in defining the characteristics of religion. \n\nVictoria's \"Psychological Practices Act\" was finally repealed by the \"Psychologists Registration Act, 1987\". The South Australian \"Psychological Practices Act\" has remained in force and regulates the activities of hypnotists and psychologists in that State. However, neither this Act itself nor the current regulations now contain any reference to Scientology. The Western Australian \"Scientology Act, 1968\" has been replaced by a \"Psychologists Registration Act, 1976\" with similar provisions.\n"}
{"id": "5820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5820", "title": "Confucianism", "text": "Confucianism\n\nConfucianism, also known as Ruism, is described as tradition, a philosophy, a religion, a humanistic or rationalistic religion, a way of governing, or simply a way of life. Confucianism developed from what was later called the Hundred Schools of Thought from the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius (551–479 BCE), who considered himself a recodifier and retransmitter of the theology and values inherited from the Shang (c. 1600 BCE–1046 BCE) and Zhou dynasties (c. 1046 BCE–256 BCE). In the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), Confucian approaches edged out the \"proto-Taoist\" Huang–Lao as the official ideology, while the emperors mixed both with the realist techniques of Legalism.\n\nA Confucian revival began during the Tang dynasty (618–907). In the late Tang, Confucianism developed in response to Buddhism and Taoism and was reformulated as Neo-Confucianism. This reinvigorated form was adopted as the basis of the imperial exams and the core philosophy of the scholar official class in the Song dynasty (960–1297). The abolition of the examination system in 1905 marked the end of official Confucianism. The intellectuals of the New Culture Movement of the early twentieth century blamed Confucianism for China's weaknesses. They searched for new doctrines to replace Confucian teachings; some of these new ideologies include the \"Three Principles of the People\" with the establishment of the Republic of China, and then Maoism under the People's Republic of China. In the late twentieth century Confucian work ethic has been credited with the rise of the East Asian economy.\n\nWith particular emphasis on the importance of the family and social harmony, rather than on an otherworldly source of spiritual values, the core of Confucianism is humanistic. According to Herbert Fingarette's conceptualisation of Confucianism as a religion which regards \"the secular as sacred\", Confucianism transcends the dichotomy between religion and humanism, considering the ordinary activities of human life—and especially human relationships—as a manifestation of the sacred, because they are the expression of humanity's moral nature (\"xìng\" 性), which has a transcendent anchorage in Heaven (\"Tiān\" 天) and unfolds through an appropriate respect for the spirits or gods (\"shén\") of the world. While \"Tiān\" has some characteristics that overlap the category of godhead, it is primarily an \"impersonal\" absolute principle, like the \"Dào\" (道) or the \"Brahman\". Confucianism focuses on the practical order that is given by a this-worldly awareness of the \"Tiān\". Confucian liturgy (called 儒 \"rú\", or sometimes 正統/正统 \"zhèngtǒng\", meaning \"orthoprax\") led by Confucian priests or \"sages of rites\" (禮生/礼生 \"lǐshēng\") to worship the gods in public and ancestral Chinese temples is preferred on certain occasions, by Confucian religious groups and for civil religious rites, over Taoist or popular ritual.\n\nThe worldly concern of Confucianism rests upon the belief that human beings are fundamentally good, and teachable, improvable, and perfectible through personal and communal endeavor, especially self-cultivation and self-creation. Confucian thought focuses on the cultivation of virtue in a morally organised world. Some of the basic Confucian ethical concepts and practices include \"rén\", \"yì\", and \"lǐ\", and \"zhì\". \"Rén\" (仁, \"benevolence\" or \"humaneness\") is the essence of the human being which manifests as compassion. It is the virtue-form of Heaven. \"Yì\" (義/义) is the upholding of righteousness and the moral disposition to do good. \"Lǐ\" (禮/礼) is a system of ritual norms and propriety that determines how a person should properly act in everyday life in harmony with the law of Heaven. \"Zhì\" (智) is the ability to see what is right and fair, or the converse, in the behaviors exhibited by others. Confucianism holds one in contempt, either passively or actively, for failure to uphold the cardinal moral values of \"rén\" and \"yì\".\n\nTraditionally, cultures and countries in the East Asian cultural sphere are strongly influenced by Confucianism, including mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, as well as various territories settled predominantly by Chinese people, such as Singapore. Today, it has been credited for shaping East Asian societies and Chinese communities, and to some extent, other parts of Asia. In the last decades there have been talks of a \"Confucian Revival\" in the academic and the scholarly community, and there has been a grassroots proliferation of various types of Confucian churches. In late 2015 many Confucian personalities formally established a national Holy Confucian Church (孔聖會/孔圣会 \"Kǒngshènghuì\") in China to unify the many Confucian congregations and civil society organisations.\n\nStrictly speaking, there is no term in Chinese which directly corresponds to \"Confucianism\". In the Chinese language, the character \"rú\" 儒 meaning \"scholar\" or \"learned\" or \"refined man\" is generally used both in the past and the present to refer to things related to Confucianism. The character \"rú\" in ancient China had diverse meanings. Some examples include \"to tame\", \"to mould\", \"to educate\", \"to refine\". Several different terms, some of which with modern origin, are used in different situations to express different facets of Confucianism, including:\n\n\nThree of them use \"rú\". These names do not use the name \"Confucius\" at all, but instead focus on the ideal of the Confucian man. The use of the term \"Confucianism\" has been avoided by some modern scholars, who favor \"Ruism\" and \"Ruists\" instead. Robert Eno argues that the term has been \"burdened... with the ambiguities and irrelevant traditional associations\". Ruism, as he states, is more faithful to the original Chinese name for the school.\n\nAccording to Zhou Youguang, 儒 \"rú\" originally referred to shamanic methods of holding rites and existed before Confucius' times, but with Confucius it came to mean devotion to propagating such teachings to bring civilisation to the people. Confucianism was initiated by Confucius, developed by Mencius (~372–289 BCE) and inherited by later generations, undergoing constant transformations and restructuring since its establishment, but preserving the principles of humaneness and righteousness at its core.\n\nTraditionally, Confucius was thought to be the author or editor of the Five Classics which were the basic texts of Confucianism. The scholar Yao Xinzhong allows that there are good reasons to believe that Confucian classics took shape in the hands of Confucius, but that \"nothing can be taken for granted in the matter of the early versions of the classics\". Professor Yao says that perhaps most scholars today hold the \"pragmatic\" view that Confucius and his followers, although they did not intend to create a system of classics, \"contributed to their formation\". In any case, it is undisputed that for most of the last 2,000 years, Confucius was believed to have either written or edited these texts. \n\nThe scholar Tu Weiming explains these classics as embodying \"five visions\" which underlie the development of Confucianism:\n\nConfucianism revolves around the pursuit of the unity of the individual self and the God of Heaven (\"Tiān\" 天), or, otherwise said, around the relationship between humanity and Heaven. The principle of Heaven (\"Lǐ\" 理 or \"Dào\" 道), is the order of the creation and the source of divine authority, monistic in its structure. Individuals may realise their humanity and become one with Heaven through the contemplation of such order. This transformation of the self may be extended to the family and society to create a harmonious fiduciary community. Joël Thoraval studied Confucianism as a diffused civil religion in contemporary China, finding that it expresses itself in the widespread worship of five cosmological entities: Heaven and Earth (\"Di\" 地), the sovereign or the government (\"jūn\" 君), ancestors (\"qīn\" 親) and masters (\"shī\" 師).\n\nHeaven is not some being pre-existing the temporal world. According to the scholar Stephan Feuchtwang, in Chinese cosmology, which is not merely Confucian but shared by all Chinese religions, \"the universe creates itself out of a primary chaos of material energy\" (\"hundun\" 混沌 and \"qi\" 氣), organising through the polarity of yin and yang which characterises any thing and life. Creation is therefore a continuous ordering; it is not a creation \"ex nihilo\". Yin and yang are the invisible and visible, the receptive and the active, the unshaped and the shaped; they characterise the yearly cycle (winter and summer), the landscape (shady and bright), the sexes (female and male), and even sociopolitical history (disorder and order). Confucianism is concerned with finding \"middle ways\" between yin and yang at every new configuration of the world.\n\nConfucianism conciliates both the inner and outer polarities of spiritual cultivation, that is to say self-cultivation and world redemption, synthesised in the ideal of \"sageliness within and kingliness without\". \"Rén\", translated as \"humaneness\" or the essence proper of a human being, is the character of compassionate mind; it is the virtue endowed by Heaven and at the same time the means by which man may achieve oneness with Heaven comprehending his own origin in Heaven and therefore divine essence. In the \"Dàtóng shū\" (《大同書/大同书》) it is defined as \"to form one body with all things\" and \"when the self and others are not separated ... compassion is aroused\".\n\n\"Tiān\" (天), a key concept in Chinese thought, refers to the God of Heaven, the northern culmen of the skies and its spinning stars, earthly nature and its laws which come from Heaven, to \"Heaven and Earth\" (that is, \"all things\"), and to the awe-inspiring forces beyond human control. There are such a number of uses in Chinese thought that it is not possible to give one translation into English.\n\nConfucius used the term in a mystical way. He wrote in the \"Analects\" (7.23) that Tian gave him life, and that Tian watched and judged (6.28; 9.12). In 9.5 Confucius says that a person may know the movements of the Tian, and this provides with the sense of having a special place in the universe. In 17.19 Confucius says that Tian spoke to him, though not in words. The scholar Ronnie Littlejohn warns that Tian has not to be interpreted as personal God comparable to that of the Abrahamic faiths, in the sense of an otherworldly or transcendent creator. Rather it is similar to what Taoists meant by \"Dao\": \"the way things are\" or \"the regularities of the world\", which Stephan Feuchtwang equates with the ancient Greek concept of \"physis\", \"nature\" as the generation and regenerations of things and of the moral order. Tian may also be compared to the \"Brahman\" of Hindu and Vedic traditions. The scholar Promise Hsu, in the wake of Robert B. Louden, explained 17:19 (\"What does Tian ever say? Yet there are four seasons going round and there are the hundred things coming into being. What does Tian say?\") as implying that even though Tian is not a \"speaking person\", it constantly \"does\" through the rhythms of nature, and communicates \"how human beings ought to live and act\", at least to those who have learnt to carefully listen to it.\n\nZigong, a disciple of Confucius, said that Tian had set the master on the path to become a wise man (9.6). In 7.23 Confucius says that he has no doubt left that the Tian gave him life, and from it he had developed right virtue (德 \"dé\"). In 8.19 he says that the lives of the sages are interwoven with Tian.\n\nRegarding personal gods (\"shén\", energies who emanate from and reproduce the Tian) enliving nature, in the \"Analects\" Confucius says that it is appropriate (義/义 \"yì\") for people to worship (敬 \"jìng\") them, though through proper rites (禮/礼 \"lǐ\"), implying respect of positions and discretion. Confucius himself was a ritual and sacrificial master. Answering to a disciple who asked whether it is better to sacrifice to the god of the stove or to the god of the family (a popular saying), in 3.13 Confucius says that in order to appropriately pray gods one should first know and respect Heaven. In 3.12 he explains that religious rituals produce meaningful experiences, and one has to offer sacrifices in person, acting in presence, otherwise \"it is the same as not having sacrificed at all\". Rites and sacrifices to the gods have an ethical importance: they generate good life, because taking part in them leads to the overcoming of the self. Analects 10.11 tells that Confucius always took a small part of his food and placed it on the sacrificial bowls as an offering to his ancestors.\n\nOther movements, such as Mohism which was later absorbed by Taoism, developed a more theistic idea of Heaven. Feuchtwang explains that the difference between Confucianism and Taoism primarily lies in the fact that the former focuses on the realisation of the starry order of Heaven in human society, while the latter on the contemplation of the Dao which spontaneously arises in nature.\n\nAs explained by Stephan Feuchtwang, the order coming from Heaven preserves the world, and has to be followed by humanity finding a \"middle way\" between yin and yang forces in each new configuration of reality. Social harmony or morality is identified as patriarchy, which is expressed in the worship of ancestors and deified progenitors in the male line, at ancestral shrines.\n\nConfucian ethical codes are described as humanistic. They may be practiced by all the members of a society. Confucian ethics is characterised by the promotion of virtues, encompassed by the Five Constants, \"Wǔcháng\" (五常) in Chinese, elaborated by Confucian scholars out of the inherited tradition during the Han dynasty. The Five Constants are:\n\nThese are accompanied by the classical \"Sìzì\" (四字), that singles out four virtues, one of which is included among the Five Constants:\n\nThere are still many other elements, such as \"chéng\" (誠/诚, honesty), \"shù\" (恕, kindness and forgiveness), \"lián\" (廉, honesty and cleanness), \"chǐ\" (恥/耻, shame, judge and sense of right and wrong), \"yǒng\" (勇, bravery), \"wēn\" (溫/温, kind and gentle), \"liáng\" (良, good, kindhearted), \"gōng\" (恭, respectful, reverent), \"jiǎn\" (儉/俭, frugal), \"ràng\" (讓/让, modestly, self-effacing).\n\n\"Rén\" () is the Confucian virtue denoting the good feeling a virtuous human experiences when being altruistic. It is exemplified by a normal adult's protective feelings for children. It is considered the essence of the human being, endowed by Heaven, and at the same time the means by which man may act according to the principle of Heaven (天理, \"Tiān lǐ\") and become one with it.\n\nYán Huí, Confucius's most outstanding student, once asked his master to describe the rules of \"rén\" and Confucius replied, \"one should see nothing improper, hear nothing improper, say nothing improper, do nothing improper.\" Confucius also defined \"rén\" in the following way: \"wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others.\"\n\nAnother meaning of \"rén\" is \"not to do to others as you would not wish done to yourself.\" Confucius also said, \"\"rén\" is not far off; he who seeks it has already found it.\" \"Rén\" is close to man and never leaves him.\n\n\"Li\" (禮/礼) is a classical Chinese word which finds its most extensive use in Confucian and post-Confucian Chinese philosophy. \"Li\" is variously translated as \"rite\" or \"reason,\" \"ratio\" in the pure sense of Vedic \"ṛta\" (\"right,\" \"order\") when referring to the cosmic law, but when referring to its realisation in the context of human social behaviour it has also been translated as \"customs\", \"measures\" and \"rules\", among other terms. \"Li\" also means religious rites which establish relations between humanity and the gods.\n\nAccording to Stephan Feuchtwang, rites are conceived as \"what makes the invisible visible\", making possible for humans to cultivate the underlying order of nature. Correctly performed rituals move society in alignment with earthly and heavenly (astral) forces, establishing the harmony of the three realms—Heaven, Earth and humanity. This practice is defined as \"centring\" (央 \"yāng\" or 中 \"zhōng\"). Among all things of creation, humans themselves are \"central\" because they have the ability to cultivate and centre natural forces.\n\n\"Li\" embodies the entire web of interaction between humanity, human objects, and nature. Confucius includes in his discussions of \"li\" such diverse topics as learning, tea drinking, titles, mourning, and governance. Xunzi cites \"songs and laughter, weeping and lamentation... rice and millet, fish and meat... the wearing of ceremonial caps, embroidered robes, and patterned silks, or of fasting clothes and mourning clothes... spacious rooms and secluded halls, soft mats, couches and benches\" as vital parts of the fabric of \"li\".\n\nConfucius envisioned proper government being guided by the principles of \"li\". Some Confucians proposed that all human beings may pursue perfection by learning and practising \"li\". Overall, Confucians believe that governments should place more emphasis on \"li\" and rely much less on penal punishment when they govern.\n\nLoyalty (, \"zhōng\") is particularly relevant for the social class to which most of Confucius' students belonged, because the most important way for an ambitious young scholar to become a prominent official was to enter a ruler's civil service.\n\nConfucius himself did not propose that \"might makes right,\" but rather that a superior should be obeyed because of his moral rectitude. In addition, loyalty does not mean subservience to authority. This is because reciprocity is demanded from the superior as well. As Confucius stated \"a prince should employ his minister according to the rules of propriety; ministers should serve their prince with faithfulness (loyalty).\"\n\nSimilarly, Mencius also said that \"when the prince regards his ministers as his hands and feet, his ministers regard their prince as their belly and heart; when he regards them as his dogs and horses, they regard him as another man; when he regards them as the ground or as grass, they regard him as a robber and an enemy.\" Moreover, Mencius indicated that if the ruler is incompetent, he should be replaced. If the ruler is evil, then the people have the right to overthrow him. A good Confucian is also expected to remonstrate with his superiors when necessary. At the same time, a proper Confucian ruler should also accept his ministers' advice, as this will help him govern the realm better.\n\nIn later ages, however, emphasis was often placed more on the obligations of the ruled to the ruler, and less on the ruler's obligations to the ruled. Like filial piety, loyalty was often subverted by the autocratic regimes in China. Nonetheless, throughout the ages, many Confucians continued to fight against unrighteous superiors and rulers. Many of these Confucians suffered and sometimes died because of their conviction and action. During the Ming-Qing era, prominent Confucians such as Wang Yangming promoted individuality and independent thinking as a counterweight to subservience to authority. The famous thinker Huang Zongxi also strongly criticised the autocratic nature of the imperial system and wanted to keep imperial power in check.\n\nMany Confucians also realised that loyalty and filial piety have the potential of coming into conflict with one another. This may be true especially in times of social chaos, such as during the period of the Ming-Qing transition.\n\nIn Confucian philosophy, filial piety (, \"xiào\") is a virtue of respect for one's parents and ancestors, and of the hierarchies within society: father–son, elder–junior and male–female. The Confucian classic \"Xiaojing\" (\"Book of Piety\"), thought to be written around the Qin-Han period, has historically been the authoritative source on the Confucian tenet of \"xiào\". The book, a conversation between Confucius and his student Zeng Shen (曾參, also known as Zengzi 曾子), is about how to set up a good society using the principle of \"xiào\".\n\nIn more general terms, filial piety means to be good to one's parents; to take care of one's parents; to engage in good conduct not just towards parents but also outside the home so as to bring a good name to one's parents and ancestors; to perform the duties of one's job well so as to obtain the material means to support parents as well as carry out sacrifices to the ancestors; not be rebellious; show love, respect and support; display courtesy; ensure male heirs, uphold fraternity among brothers; wisely advise one's parents, including dissuading them from moral unrighteousness, for blindly following the parents' wishes is not considered to be \"xiao\"; display sorrow for their sickness and death; and carry out sacrifices after their death.\n\nFilial piety is considered a key virtue in Chinese culture, and it is the main concern of a large number of stories. One of the most famous collections of such stories is \"The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars\" (\"Ershi-si xiao\" ). These stories depict how children exercised their filial piety in the past. While China has always had a diversity of religious beliefs, filial piety has been common to almost all of them; historian Hugh D.R. Baker calls respect for the family the only element common to almost all Chinese believers.\n\nSocial harmony results in part from every individual knowing his or her place in the natural order, and playing his or her part well. Reciprocity or responsibility (\"renqing\") extends beyond filial piety and involves the entire network of social relations, even the respect for rulers. When Duke Jing of Qi asked about government, by which he meant proper administration so as to bring social harmony, Confucius replied:\n\nThere is government, when the prince is prince, and the minister is minister; when the father is father, and the son is son. (\"Analects\" XII, 11, tr. Legge)\nParticular duties arise from one's particular situation in relation to others. The individual stands simultaneously in several different relationships with different people: as a junior in relation to parents and elders, and as a senior in relation to younger siblings, students, and others. While juniors are considered in Confucianism to owe their seniors reverence, seniors also have duties of benevolence and concern toward juniors. The same is true with the husband and wife relationship where the husband needs to show benevolence towards his wife and the wife needs to respect the husband in return. This theme of mutuality still exists in East Asian cultures even to this day.\n\nThe Five Bonds are: ruler to ruled, father to son, husband to wife, elder brother to younger brother, friend to friend. Specific duties were prescribed to each of the participants in these sets of relationships. Such duties are also extended to the dead, where the living stand as sons to their deceased family. The only relationship where respect for elders isn't stressed was the friend to friend relationship, where mutual equal respect is emphasised instead. All these duties take the practical form of prescribed rituals, for instance wedding and death rituals.\n\nThe \"junzi\" (, \"jūnzǐ\", \"lord's son\") is a Chinese philosophical term often translated as \"gentleman\" or \"superior person\" and employed by Confucius in his works to describe the ideal man. In the \"I Ching\" it is used by the Duke of Wen.\n\nIn Confucianism, the sage or wise is the ideal personality; however, it is very hard to become one of them. Confucius created the model of \"junzi\", gentleman, which may be achieved by any individual. Later, Zhu Xi defined \"junzi\" as second only to the sage. There are many characteristics of the \"junzi\": he may live in poverty, he does more and speaks less, he is loyal, obedient and knowledgeable. The \"junzi\" disciplines himself. \"Ren\" is fundamental to become a \"junzi\".\n\nAs the potential leader of a nation, a son of the ruler is raised to have a superior ethical and moral position while gaining inner peace through his virtue. To Confucius, the \"junzi\" sustained the functions of government and social stratification through his ethical values. Despite its literal meaning, any righteous man willing to improve himself may become a \"junzi\".\n\nOn the contrary, the \"xiaoren\" (小人, \"xiăorén\", \"small or petty person\") does not grasp the value of virtues and seeks only immediate gains. The petty person is egotistic and does not consider the consequences of his action in the overall scheme of things. Should the ruler be surrounded by \"xiaoren\" as opposed to \"junzi\", his governance and his people will suffer due to their small-mindness. Examples of such \"xiaoren\" individuals may range from those who continually indulge in sensual and emotional pleasures all day to the politician who is interested merely in power and fame; neither sincerely aims for the long-term benefit of others.\n\nThe \"junzi\" enforces his rule over his subjects by acting virtuously himself. It is thought that his pure virtue would lead others to follow his example. The ultimate goal is that the government behaves much like a family, the \"junzi\" being a beacon of filial piety.\n\nConfucius believed that social disorder often stemmed from failure to perceive, understand, and deal with reality. Fundamentally, then, social disorder may stem from the failure to call things by their proper names, and his solution to this was \"zhèngmíng\" (). He gave an explanation of \"zhengming\" to one of his disciples.\nZi-lu said, \"The vassal of Wei has been waiting for you, in order with you to administer the government. What will you consider the first thing to be done?\"<br>\nThe Master replied, \"What is necessary to rectify names.\"<br>\n\"So! indeed!\" said Zi-lu. \"You are wide off the mark! Why must there be such rectification?\"<br>\nThe Master said, \"How uncultivated you are, Yu! The superior man [Junzi] cannot care about the everything, just as he cannot go to check all himself!<br>\n        If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things.<br>\n        If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success.<br>\n        When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music do not flourish.<br>\n        When proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly awarded.<br>\n        When punishments are not properly awarded, the people do not know how to move hand or foot.<br>\nTherefore a superior man considers it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that in his words there may be nothing incorrect.\"<br>\nXun Zi chapter (22) \"On the Rectification of Names\" claims the ancient sage-kings chose names () that directly corresponded with actualities (), but later generations confused terminology, coined new nomenclature, and thus could no longer distinguish right from wrong. Since social harmony is of utmost importance, without the proper rectification of names, society would essentially crumble and \"undertakings [would] not [be] completed.\" \n\nAccording to He Guanghu, Confucianism may be identified as a continuation of the Shang-Zhou (~1600 BCE–256 BCE) official religion, or the Chinese aboriginal religion which has lasted uninterrupted for three thousand years. Both the dynasties worshipped the supreme godhead, called \"Shangdi\" (上帝 \"Highest Deity\") or simply \"Dì\" (帝) by the Shang and \"Tian\" (天 \"Heaven\") by the Zhou. Shangdi was conceived as the first ancestor of the Shang royal house, an alternate name for him being the \"Supreme Progenitor\" (上甲 \"Shàngjiǎ\"). In Shang theology, the multiplicity of gods of nature and ancestors were viewed as parts of Di, and the four 方 \"fāng\" (\"directions\" or \"sides\") and their 風 \"fēng\" (\"winds\") as his cosmic will. With the Zhou dynasty, which overthrew the Shang, the name for the supreme godhead became \"Tian\" (天 \"Heaven\"). While the Shang identified Shangdi as their ancestor-god to assert their claim to power by divine right, the Zhou transformed this claim into a legitimacy based on moral power, the Mandate of Heaven. In Zhou theology, Tian had no singular earthly progeny, but bestowed divine favour on virtuous rulers. Zhou kings declared that their victory over the Shang was because they were virtuous and loved their people, while the Shang were tyrants and thus were deprived of power by Tian.\n\nJohn C. Didier and David Pankenier relate the shapes of both the ancient Chinese characters for Di and Tian to the patterns of stars in the northern skies, either drawn, in Didier's theory by connecting the constellations bracketing the north celestial pole as a square, or in Pankenier's theory by connecting some of the stars which form the constellations of the Big Dipper and broader Ursa Major, and Ursa Minor (Little Dipper). Cultures in other parts of the world have also conceived these stars or constellations as symbols of the origin of things, the supreme godhead, divinity and royal power. The supreme godhead was also identified with the dragon, symbol of unlimited power (\"qi\"), of the \"protean\" primordial power which embodies both yin and yang in unity, associated to the constellation Draco which winds around the north ecliptic pole, and slithers between the Little and Big Dipper.\n\nBy the 6th century BCE the power of Tian and the symbols that represented it on earth (architecture of cities, temples, altars and ritual cauldrons, and the Zhou ritual system) became \"diffuse\" and claimed by different potentates in the Zhou states to legitimise economic, political, and military ambitions. Divine right no longer was an exclusive privilege of the Zhou royal house, but might be bought by anyone able to afford the elaborate ceremonies and the old and new rites required to access the authority of Tian.\n\nBesides the waning Zhou ritual system, what may be defined as \"wild\" (野 \"yě\") traditions, or traditions \"outside of the official system\", developed as attempts to access the will of Tian. The population had lost faith in the official tradition, which was no longer perceived as an effective way to communicate with Heaven. The traditions of the 九野 (\"Nine Fields\") and of the \"Yijing\" flourished. Chinese thinkers, faced with this challenge to legitimacy, diverged in a \"Hundred Schools of Thought\", each proposing its own theories for the reconstruction of the Zhou moral order.\n\nConfucius (551–479 BCE) appeared in this period of political decadence and spiritual questioning. He was educated in Shang-Zhou theology, which he contributed to transmit and reformulate giving centrality to self-cultivation and agency of humans, and the educational power of the self-established individual in assisting others to establish themselves (the principle of 愛人 \"àirén\", \"loving others\"). As the Zhou reign collapsed, traditional values were abandoned resulting in a period of moral decline. Confucius saw an opportunity to reinforce values of compassion and tradition into society. Disillusioned with the widespread vulgarisation of the rituals to access Tian, he began to preach an ethical interpretation of traditional Zhou religion. In his view, the power of Tian is immanent, and responds positively to the sincere heart driven by humaneness and rightness, decency and altruism. Confucius conceived these qualities as the foundation needed to restore socio-political harmony. Like many contemporaries, Confucius saw ritual practices as efficacious ways to access Tian, but he thought that the crucial knot was the state of meditation that participants enter prior to engage in the ritual acts. Confucius amended and recodified the classical books inherited from the Xia-Shang-Zhou dynasties, and composed the \"Spring and Autumn Annals\".\n\nPhilosophers in the Warring States period, both \"inside the square\" (focused on state-endorsed ritual) and \"outside the square\" (non-aligned to state ritual) built upon Confucius' legacy, compiled in the \"Analects\", and formulated the classical metaphysics that became the lash of Confucianism. In accordance with the Master, they identified mental tranquility as the state of Tian, or the One (一 \"Yī\"), which in each individual is the Heaven-bestowed divine power to rule one's own life and the world. Going beyond the Master, they theorised the oneness of production and reabsorption into the cosmic source, and the possibility to understand and therefore reattain it through meditation. This line of thought would have influenced all Chinese individual and collective-political mystical theories and practices thereafter.\n\nSince the 2000s, there has been a growing identification of the Chinese intellectual class with Confucianism. In 2003, the Confucian intellectual Kang Xiaoguang published a manifesto in which he made four suggestions: Confucian education should enter official education at any level, from elementary to high school; the state should establish Confucianism as the state religion by law; Confucian religion should enter the daily life of ordinary people through standardisation and development of doctrines, rituals, organisations, churches and activity sites; the Confucian religion should be spread through non-governmental organisations. Another modern proponent of the institutionalisation of Confucianism in a state church is Jiang Qing.\n\nIn 2005, the Center for the Study of Confucian Religion was established, and \"guoxue\" started to be implemented in public schools on all levels. Being well received by the population, even Confucian preachers have appeared on television since 2006. The most enthusiastic New Confucians proclaim the uniqueness and superiority of Confucian Chinese culture, and have generated some popular sentiment against Western cultural influences in China.\n\nThe idea of a \"Confucian Church\" as the state religion of China has roots in the thought of Kang Youwei, an exponent of the early New Confucian search for a regeneration of the social relevance of Confucianism, at a time when it was de-institutionalised with the collapse of the Qing dynasty and the Chinese empire. Kang modeled his ideal \"Confucian Church\" after European national Christian churches, as a hierarchic and centralised institution, closely bound to the state, with local church branches, devoted to the worship and the spread of the teachings of Confucius.\n\nIn contemporary China, the Confucian revival has developed into various interwoven directions: the proliferation of Confucian schools or academies (\"shuyuan\" 书院), the resurgence of Confucian rites (\"chuántǒng lǐyí\" 传统礼仪), and the birth of new forms of Confucian activity on the popular level, such as the Confucian communities (\"shèqū rúxué\" 社区儒学). Some scholars also consider the reconstruction of lineage churches and their ancestral temples, as well as cults and temples of natural and national gods within broader Chinese traditional religion, as part of the renewal of Confucianism.\n\nOther forms of revival are salvationist folk religious movements groups with a specifically Confucian focus, or Confucian churches, for example the \"Yidan xuetang\" (一耽学堂) of Beijing, the \"Mengmutang\" (孟母堂) of Shanghai, Confucian Shenism (儒宗神教 \"Rúzōng Shénjiào\") or the phoenix churches, the Confucian Fellowship (儒教道坛 \"Rújiào Dàotán\") in northern Fujian which has spread rapidly over the years after its foundation, and ancestral temples of the Kong kin (the lineage of the descendants of Confucius himself) operating as Confucian-teaching churches.\n\nAlso, the Hong Kong Confucian Academy, one of the direct heirs of Kang Youwei's Confucian Church, has expanded its activities to the mainland, with the construction of statues of Confucius, Confucian hospitals, restoration of temples and other activities. In 2009, Zhou Beichen founded another institution which inherits the idea of Kang Youwei's Confucian Church, the Holy Hall of Confucius (孔圣堂 \"Kǒngshèngtáng\") in Shenzhen, affiliated with the Federation of Confucian Culture of Qufu City. It was the first of a nationwide movement of congregations and civil organisations that was unified in 2015 in the Holy Confucian Church (孔圣会 \"Kǒngshènghuì\"). The first spiritual leader of the Holy Church is the renowned scholar Jiang Qing, the founder and manager of the Yangming Confucian Abode (阳明精舍 \"Yángmíng jīngshě\"), a Confucian academy in Guiyang, Guizhou.\n\nChinese folk religious temples and kinship ancestral shrines may, on peculiar occasions, choose Confucian liturgy (called 儒 \"rú\" or 正统 \"zhèngtǒng\", \"orthoprax\") led by Confucian ritual masters (礼生 \"lǐshēng\") to worship the gods, instead of Taoist or popular ritual. \"Confucian businessmen\" (儒商人 \"rúshāngrén\", also \"refined businessman\") is a recently rediscovered concept defining people of the economic-entrepreneurial elite who recognise their social responsibility and therefore apply Confucian culture to their business.\n\nTo govern by virtue, let us compare it to the North Star: it stays in its place, while the myriad stars wait upon it. (\"Analects\" 2.1)\n\nA key Confucian concept is that in order to govern others one must first govern oneself according to the universal order. When actual, the king's personal virtue (\"de\") spreads beneficent influence throughout the kingdom. This idea is developed further in the Great Learning, and is tightly linked with the Taoist concept of wu wei (): the less the king does, the more gets done. By being the \"calm center\" around which the kingdom turns, the king allows everything to function smoothly and avoids having to tamper with the individual parts of the whole.\n\nThis idea may be traced back to the ancient shamanic beliefs of the king being the axle between the sky, human beings, and the Earth. The emperors of China were considered agents of Heaven, endowed with the Mandate of Heaven. They hold the power to define the hierarchy of divinities, by bestowing titles upon mountains, rivers and dead people, acknowledging them as powerful and therefore establishing their cults.\n\nIn teaching, there should be no distinction of classes. (\"Analects\" 15.39)\nAlthough Confucius claimed that he never invented anything but was only transmitting ancient knowledge (\"Analects\" 7.1), he did produce a number of new ideas. Many European and American admirers such as Voltaire and H. G. Creel point to the revolutionary idea of replacing nobility of blood with nobility of virtue. \"Jūnzǐ\" (君子, lit. \"lord's child\"), which originally signified the younger, non-inheriting, offspring of a noble, became, in Confucius' work, an epithet having much the same meaning and evolution as the English \"gentleman.\"\n\nA virtuous commoner who cultivates his qualities may be a \"gentleman\", while a shameless son of the king is only a \"small man.\" That he admitted students of different classes as disciples is a clear demonstration that he fought against the feudal structures that defined pre-imperial Chinese society.\n\nAnother new idea, that of meritocracy, led to the introduction of the imperial examination system in China. This system allowed anyone who passed an examination to become a government officer, a position which would bring wealth and honour to the whole family. The Chinese imperial examination system started in the Sui dynasty. Over the following centuries the system grew until finally almost anyone who wished to become an official had to prove his worth by passing written government examinations. The practice of meritocracy still exists today in the Chinese cultural sphere, including China, Taiwan, Singapore and so forth.\n\nThe works of Confucius were translated into European languages through the agency of Jesuit scholars stationed in China. Matteo Ricci was among the very earliest to report on the thoughts of Confucius, and father Prospero Intorcetta wrote about the life and works of Confucius in Latin in 1687.\n\nTranslations of Confucian texts influenced European thinkers of the period, particularly among the Deists and other philosophical groups of the Enlightenment who were interested by the integration of the system of morality of Confucius into Western civilisation.\n\nConfucianism influenced Gottfried Leibniz, who was attracted to the philosophy because of its perceived similarity to his own. It is postulated that certain elements of Leibniz's philosophy, such as \"simple substance\" and \"preestablished harmony,\" were borrowed from his interactions with Confucianism. The French philosopher Voltaire was also influenced by Confucius, seeing the concept of Confucian rationalism as an alternative to Christian dogma. He praised Confucian ethics and politics, portraying the sociopolitical hierarchy of China as a model for Europe.\nFrom the late 17th century onwards a whole body of literature known as the Han Kitab developed amongst the Hui Muslims of China who infused Islamic thought with Confucianism. Especially the works of Liu Zhi such as \"Tiānfāng Diǎnlǐ\"（天方典禮）sought to harmonise Islam with not only Confucianism but also with Daoism and is considered to be one of the crowning achievements of the Chinese Islamic culture.\n\nImportant military and political figures in modern Chinese history continued to be influenced by Confucianism, like the Muslim warlord Ma Fuxiang. The New Life Movement in the early 20th century was also influenced by Confucianism.\n\nReferred to variously as the Confucian hypothesis and as a debated component of the more all-encompassing Asian Development Model, there exists among political scientists and economists a theory that Confucianism plays a large latent role in the ostensibly non-Confucian cultures of modern-day East Asia, in the form of the rigorous work ethic it endowed those cultures with. These scholars have held that, if not for Confucianism's influence on these cultures, many of the people of the East Asia region would not have been able to modernise and industrialise as quickly as Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and even China have done.\n\nFor example, the impact of the Vietnam War on Vietnam was devastating, but over the last few decades Vietnam has been re-developing in a very fast pace. Most scholars attribute the origins of this idea to futurologist Herman Kahn's \"World Economic Development: 1979 and Beyond\".\n\nOther studies, for example Cristobal Kay's \"Why East Asia Overtook Latin America: Agrarian Reform, Industrialization, and Development\", have attributed the Asian growth to other factors, for example the character of agrarian reforms, \"state-craft\" (state capacity), and interaction between agriculture and industry.\n\nAfter Confucianism had become the official 'state religion' in China, its influence penetrated all walks of life and all streams of thought in Chinese society for the generations to come. This did not exclude martial arts culture. Though in his own day, Confucius had rejected the practice of Martial Arts (with the exception of Archery), he did serve under rulers who used military power extensively to achieve their goals. In later centuries, Confucianism heavily influenced many educated martial artists of great influence, such as Sun Lutang, especially from the 19th century onwards, when bare-handed martial arts in China became more widespread and had begun to more readily absorb philosophical influences from Confucianism, Buddhism and Daoism. Some argue therefore that despite Confucius' disdain with martial culture, his teachings became of much relevance to it.\n\nConfucius and Confucianism were opposed or criticised from the start, including Laozi's philosophy and Mozi's critique, and Legalists such as Han Fei ridiculed the idea that virtue would lead people to be orderly. In modern times, waves of opposition and vilification showed that Confucianism, instead of taking credit for the glories of Chinese civilisation, now had to take blame for its failures. The Taiping Rebellion described Confucianism sages as well as gods in Taoism and Buddhism as devils. In the New Culture Movement, Lu Xun criticised Confucianism for shaping Chinese people into the condition they had reached by the late Qing Dynasty: his criticisms are dramatically portrayed in \"A Madman's Diary,\" which implies that Confucian society was cannibalistic. Leftists during the Cultural Revolution described Confucius as the representative of the class of slave owners.\n\nIn South Korea, there has long been criticism. Some South Koreans believe Confucianism has not contributed to the modernisation of South Korea. For example, South Korean writer Kim Kyong-il wrote an essay entitled \"Confucius Must Die For the Nation to Live\" (공자가 죽어야 나라가 산다, \"gongjaga jug-eoya naraga sanda\"). Kim said that filial piety is one-sided and blind, and if it continues social problems will continue as government keeps forcing Confucian filial obligations onto families.\n\nConfucianism \"largely defined the mainstream discourse on gender in China from the Han dynasty onward.\" The gender roles prescribed in the Three Obediences and Four Virtues became a cornerstone of the family, and thus, societal stability. Starting from the Han period, Confucians began to teach that a virtuous woman was supposed to follow the males in her family: the father before her marriage, the husband after she marries, and her sons in widowhood. In the later dynasties, more emphasis was placed on the virtue of chastity. The Song dynasty Confucian Cheng Yi stated that: \"To starve to death is a small matter, but to lose one's chastity is a great matter.\" Chaste widows were revered and memorialised during the Ming and Qing periods. This \"cult of chastity\" accordingly condemned many widows to poverty and loneliness by placing a social stigma on remarriage.\n\nFor years, many modern scholars have regarded Confucianism as a sexist, patriarchal ideology that was historically damaging to Chinese women. It has also been argued by some Chinese and Western writers that the rise of neo-Confucianism during the Song dynasty had led to a decline of status of women. Some critics have also accused the prominent Song neo-Confucian scholar Zhu Xi for believing in the inferiority of women and that men and women need to be kept strictly separate, while Sima Guang also believed that women should remain indoor and not deal with the matters of men in the outside world. Finally, scholars have discussed the attitudes toward women in Confucian texts such as Analects. In a much-discussed passage, women are grouped together with \"xiaoren\" (小人, literally \"small people\", meaning people of low status or low moral) and described as being difficult to cultivate or deal with. Many traditional commentators and modern scholars have debated over the precise meaning of the passage, and whether Confucius referred to all women or just certain groups of women.\n\nFurther analysis suggests, however, that women's place in Confucian society may be more complex. During the Han dynasty period, the influential Confucian text Lessons for Women (Nüjie), was written by Ban Zhao (45–114 CE) to instruct her daughters how to be proper Confucian wives and mothers, that is, to be silent, hard-working, and compliant. She stresses the complementarity and equal importance of the male and female roles according to yin-yang theory, but she clearly accepts the dominance of the male. However, she does present education and literary power as important for women. In later dynasties, a number of women took advantage of the Confucian acknowledgment of education to become independent in thought.\n\nIndeed, as Joseph A. Adler points out, \"Neo-Confucian writings do not necessarily reflect either the prevailing social practices or the scholars' own attitudes and practices in regard to actual women.\" Matthew Sommers has also indicated that the Qing dynasty government began to realise the utopian nature of enforcing the \"cult of chastity\" and began to allow practices such as widow remarrying to stand. Moreover, some Confucian texts like the \"Chunqiu Fanlu\" 春秋繁露 have passages that suggest a more equal relationship between a husband and his wife. More recently, some scholars have also begun to discuss the viability of constructing a \"Confucian feminism.\"\n\nEver since Europeans first encountered Confucianism, the issue of how Confucianism should be classified has been subject to debate. In the 16th and the 17th centuries, the earliest European arrivals in China, the Christian Jesuits, considered Confucianism to be an ethical system, not a religion, and one that was compatible with Christianity. The Jesuits, including Matteo Ricci, saw Chinese rituals as \"civil rituals\" that could co-exist alongside the spiritual rituals of Catholicism.\n\nBy the early 18th century, this initial portrayal was rejected by the Dominicans and Franciscans, creating a dispute among Catholics in East Asia that was known as the \"Rites Controversy.\" The Dominicans and Franciscans argued that Chinese ancestral worship was a form of idolatry that was contradictory to the tenets of Christianity. This view was reinforced by Pope Benedict XIV, who ordered a ban on Chinese rituals.\n\nSome critics view Confucianism as definitely pantheistic and nontheistic, in that it is not based on the belief in the supernatural or in a personal god existing separate from the temporal plane. Confucius views about Tiān 天 and about the divine providence ruling the world, can be found above (in this page) and in Analects 6:26, 7:22, and 9:12, for example. On spirituality, Confucius said to Chi Lu, one of his students: \"You are not yet able to serve men, how can you serve spirits?\" Attributes such as ancestor worship, ritual, and sacrifice were advocated by Confucius as necessary for social harmony; these attributes may be traced to the traditional Chinese folk religion.\n\nScholars recognise that classification ultimately depends on how one defines religion. Using stricter definitions of religion, Confucianism has been described as a moral science or philosophy. But using a broader definition, such as Frederick Streng's characterisation of religion as \"a means of ultimate transformation,\" Confucianism could be described as a \"sociopolitical doctrine having religious qualities.\" With the latter definition, Confucianism is religious, even if non-theistic, in the sense that it \"performs some of the basic psycho-social functions of full-fledged religions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Dhammacaris follow four training vows in addition to the traditional Five Precepts that all lay devotees follow.\n\nDhammacārī literally means a person who forms his or her thinking and behavior according to the Dhamma. Dhamma is the knowledge that enhances the quality of life. It is the knowledge and understanding of the true nature of things: the knowledge that all things are causally conditioned. After realizing the causes and conditions of things one can generate a desired effect by changing the causes and conditions as necessary. This is the same principle that is used to improve things in science and technology. Dhammacārī applies this method to improve things related to human behavior.\n\n“Dhammacārī” (one who follows Dhamma) is committed to putting effort towards understanding how life works (Dhamma) and reforms the lifestyle and thinking patterns according to this understanding. The goal is the reduction of discomfort of life and becoming more and more effective in handling ups and downs of life. Buddha has taught Dhamma in many different ways and his teachings help us to understand the many subtle details regarding the nature of life. Dhammacārī is convinced that learning the teaching of the Buddha makes learning “life” much easier.\n\nTi-Sarana & Life-long Eight Precepts\n\n• Namo Tassa Bhagavato Arahato Sammā Sambudhassa (3 times).\n\nHomage to the blessed One, the Perfected One, the Fully Awakened One (3 times).\n\n• Buddham Saranam Gacchāmi\n\nI go to the Buddha for refuge.\n\n• Dhammam Saranam Gacchāmi\n\nI go to the Dhamma for refuge.\n\n• Sangham Saranam Gacchāmi\n\nI go to the Sangha for refuge.\n\n• Dutiyampi Buddham Saranam Gacchāmi\n\nFor the second time, I go to the Buddha for refuge.\n\n• Dutiyampi Dhammam Saranam Gacchāmi\n\nFor the second time, I go to the Dhamma for refuge.\n\n• Dutiyampi Sangham Saranam Gacchāmi\n\nFor the second time, I go to the Sangha for refuge.\n\n• Tatiyampi Buddham Saranam Gacchāmi\n\nFor the third time, I go to the Buddha for refuge.\n\n• Tatiyampi Dhammam Saranam Gacchāmi\n\nFor the third time, I go to the Dhamma for refuge.\n\n• Tatiyampi Sangham Saranam Gacchāmi\n\nFor the third time, I go to the Sangha for refuge.\n\nLife-long Eight Precepts\n\n• Pānātipātā veramanī, sikkhāpadam samādiyāmi.\n\nI undertake the training step to abstain from taking life.\n\n• Adinnādanā veramanī, sikkhāpadam samādiyāmi.\n\nI undertake the training step to abstain from taking what is not given.\n\n• Kāmesu micchācārā veramanī, sikkhāpadam samādiyāmi.\n\nI undertake the training step to abstain from sexual misconduct.\n\n• Musāvādā veramanī, sikkhāpadam samādiyāmi.\n\nI undertake the training step to abstain from lying.\n\n• Pisunāvācā veramanī, sikkhāpadam samādiyāmi.\n\nI undertake the training step to abstain from divisive speech.\n\n• Pharusāvācā veramanī, sikkhāpadam samādiyāmi.\n\nI undertake the training step to abstain from harsh speech.\n\n• Samphappalāpā veramanī, sikkhāpadam samādiyāmi\n\nI undertake the training step to abstain from idle chatter.\n\n• Micchā ājīvā veramanī, sikkhāpadam samādiyāmi.\n\nI undertake the training step to abstain from wrong livelihood.\n\nBuddha: The term Buddha means ultimate human perfection, the perfection of insight and compassion. It is also the absence of fear and all other defects of the human mind. Any one can achieve Buddha-hood by using the correct method. Taking refuge in the Buddha means setting oneself in the direction of perfect wisdom and compassion.\n\nDhamma: Dhamma is the necessary information regarding the method that gradually leads us toward human perfection. After carefully verifying the accuracy of this method, all Buddhas make that information available to others for their benefit. Dhamma is the knowledge that is utilized and verified by individuals who seek to refine the quality of life. Taking refuge in Dhamma is committing oneself to study and practice it for the benefit of oneself and others.\n\nSangha: Sangha is the numerous men, women and children who have tested the method and proved that gradual improvement and final personal perfection is possible. They were average people who achieved perfect wisdom and compassion, by following Dhamma. They became free from sorrow, frustration, stress, fear, and other mental weaknesses that make life difficult. Taking refuge in the Sangha means looking up to them as role models.\n\nIn the early 1990s Bhante Madawala Seelawimala of American Buddhist Seminary in West Sacramento and Bhante Walpola Piyananda of Dhamma Vijaya Buddhist Vihara in Los Angeles decided to establish this formal initiation ceremony to train future American Buddhist leadership.\n\nDhammacārī Initiation is designed to encourage the students of Dhamma to study and practice Dhamma deeply and more seriously. Additionally, they are encouraged to teach Dhamma School for children, give introductory talks on Buddhism, give public Dhamma talks on simple topics, conduct basic meditation sessions and organize Dhamma study groups. The American Buddhist Seminary may even certify Dhammacārīs who have the proper background and in-depth knowledge of Dhamma for Buddhist counseling.\n\n\n\n"}

DePauw (11 October 1918 - 6 May 2005) was a traditionalist Catholic priest and founder of the Catholic Traditionalist Movement.\n\nDePauw was born in Stekene, Belgium, the son of a newspaper editor. After graduating as a Diplomate in Classical Humanities, magna cum laude, from the College of St. Nicholas, he entered the diocesan seminary of Ghent for his philosophical and theological studies. During the Second World War he served as a combat medic with the 9th Belgian Infantry Hunters Regiment, and was taken prisoner at Dunkirk in 1940. After escaping from prison camp, he returned to his seminary studies and was ordained priest for the Diocese of Ghent in 1942. He served as a battle-field chaplain with the Belgian Underground Army and the Polish 1st Armoured Division until the end of the war.\n\nFor three years DePauw studied at the University of Leuven, where he earned a bachelor's degree in canon law and a licentiate in canon law, moral theology and church history.\n\nIn 1949 DePauw joined his family in the United States. He served as an assistant priest in two New York City parishes: St. Stephen's in Manhattan and St. Clare's in The Bronx. At the same time he pursued graduate studies at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. In 1953 he received a doctorate in canon law with a dissertation entitled \"The Educational Rights of the Church and Elementary Schools in Belgium\".\n\nFrom 1952 to 1963 DePauw taught canon law at Mount Saint Mary's Seminary in Emmitsburg, Maryland. In 1955 he requested and was granted incardination from the Diocese of Ghent to the Archdiocese of Baltimore and was named academic dean of the seminary. On 9 May 1955 he became a United States citizen. While teaching at the seminary, he contributed articles to the \"New Catholic Encyclopedia\", the \"Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Bible\", \"Homiletic and Pastoral Review\", and \"Ephemerides Theologicae Lovanienses\".\n\nDuring the Second Vatican Council he was called to Rome to serve as a peritus, a theological advisor to bishops at the Council. At the request of the Cardinal Secretary of State, Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, Pope Paul VI made him a domestic prelate with the title \"Right Reverend Monsignor\".\n\nTowards the end of the Second Vatican Council DePauw came into conflict with Cardinal Lawrence Shehan, Archbishop of Baltimore, over the interpretation of the council's teachings, particularly about liturgical matters. In January 1965 DePauw incorporated an organization called the \"Catholic Traditionalist Movement\" in New York State, purportedly with the support of Cardinal Francis Spellman, Archbishop of New York. Shehan demanded that DePauw break with the organization. In summer 1965 Shehan removed DePauw from teaching duties at Mount Saint Mary's Seminary and transferred him to a parish in a Baltimore suburb. Shortly thereafter DePauw left for Rome.\n\nOn 15 November 1965 Luigi Faveri, Bishop of Tivoli in Italy, signed a document transferring DePauw's incardination from the Archdiocese of Baltimore to the Diocese of Tivoli. Faveri said that he had taken this step at the request of Cardinal Spellman and of the Cardinal Secretary of the Holy Office, Alfredo Ottaviani. This transfer would have allowed DePauw to continue his work with the Catholic Traditionalist Movement in New York.\n\nIn January 1966 after the attempted transfer from Baltimore to Tivoli became public, Cardinal Shehan said that the transfer was never legally completed and that DePauw was still a priest incardinated in the Archdiocese of Baltimore. In order to excardinate and incardinate, a priest must request excardination of his bishop, and it must be granted. As Cardinal Shehan was following the universal law of the Church, the Bishop of Tivoli supported Cardinal Shehan. Bishop Blais Kurz, the exiled Prefect Apostolic of Yungchow in China, supported DePauw.\n\nOn 23 June 1968 DePauw established the Ave Maria Chapel in Westbury, Long Island, where he ministered until his death. He became well-known among traditionalist Catholics for his Sunday radio Mass, his video and audio cassettes, and pamphlets. He edited two magazines: \"Sounds of Truth and Tradition\" and \"Quote .. Unquote\". His two best-known works are the \"Traditional Roman Catholic Mass\" and \"The Challenge of Peace through Strength\", a critique of the American Catholic bishops' pastoral letter on war and peace, \"The Challenge of Peace\".\n\nDePauw died on 6 May 2005.\n\n"}
{"id": "3098574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3098574", "title": "Hamd", "text": "Hamd\n\nHamd (), \"praise\" in English, is a word that exclusively praises God - whether written or spoken. \n\nA Hamd is usually written in Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Punjabi, or Urdu and recited all over the Muslim world, from Indonesia to Morocco. A Qawwali performance usually includes at least one Hamd, which is traditionally at the beginning of the performance.\n\nIn the five pillars of Islam, the concept of Hamd is in each pillar to emphasize the importance of this word. In the first pillar Shahada, Muslims praise Allah for the blessings of being born Muslim and the belief in one god and his prophet. They also praise Him for giving them better health and wealth than those who suffer. The second pillar is Salat which is performing prayer, Muslims pray five times a day in order to keep remembering Allah and this allows a direct link between the worshipper and God. In each prayer Muslims recite Surah (passage), Al-Fatiha and choose the next surah they would like to recite, but Al-Fatiha must always be recited in order for prayers to be accepted. The third pillar is giving Zakat which is the act of giving a percentage of a Muslim's income to certain classes of needy people; this allows Muslims to remember the poor and to never forget that everything belongs to Allah. Therefore they should be thankful for what they have at all times. Fasting is the fourth pillar, and this emphasizes the depth meaning of Hamd in the holy month of Ramadan. Muslims fast every year for a month from sunrise to sunset. This helps purify the worshiper's soul and helps them gain true sympathy with the hungry in addition to remind them of their blessings and amounts of food they have. The fifth pillar is Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca, the concept of Hamd is implemented in the action of Muslims visiting the Kaabah or House of God. In all five pillars in Islam, Hamd is used either by action or words.\nIn all aspects of Islam, Hamd is used and can only be used for Allah alone. Hamd is the root word for AlHamdAllah which means praise to Allah. When a Muslim thanks or praises Allah for his favours and bounties it can be done by reciting the word or by act of prayer.\n\nHamd is a word to be recited by every Muslim in order for him/her to keep Allah in mind. For example, when a Muslim sneezes, first thing they should say is HamdAllah praising God in every small or large situation. It is believed when a person sneezes, his or her soul is taken out for milliseconds and returned, therefore thanking God for returning the soul is a blessing. Muslims should always praise God no matter what state they are in. \nHamd is always true and implies admiration, love and magnifying the creator. Hamd is sincere and true praise therefore when praising Allah most deserving; called Mahmood which comes from the word Hamd. When Muslims say \"AlHamdAllah\", it is out of love, humility and complete submission to the oneness and perfection of Allah.\n\nSome well-known Hamd singers are Mishary Rashid Alafasy, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Sabri Brothers, Najam Sheraz, Qari Waheed Zafar Qasmi and Muhammad al-Muqit. Some modern English language singers of Hamd are Yusuf Islam (formerly known as Cat Stevens), Sami Yusuf, Ahmed Mac and \"Nusrullah Khan Noori\". Hamd is a word that is used in the Islamic religion. Muslims use the word Hamd in many aspects in their lives. The Quran starts with a Hamd opening chapter or Surah which is Al-Fatiha starts with praising God (\"Allah\"). It is found to be in the first Ayah, the first Surah in the Quran; Al-Fatiha . It is significant because it allows Muslims to remember (\"Allah\") throughout the day and to keep praising Him for his blessings.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14036", "title": "Hinayana", "text": "Hinayana\n\n\"Hīnayāna\" () is a Sanskrit term literally meaning the \"inferior vehicle\". Tibetan teachers translate it \"smaller vehicle\". The term was applied to the \"Śrāvakayāna\", the Buddhist path followed by a śrāvaka who wished to become an arhat. This pejorative term appeared around the first or second century. Hīnayāna was often contrasted with \"Mahāyāna\", which means the \"great vehicle\".\n\nIn 1950 the World Fellowship of Buddhists declared that the term Hīnayana should not be used when referring to any form of Buddhism existing today.\n\nIn the past, the term was widely used by Western scholars to cover \"the earliest system of Buddhist doctrine\", as the \"Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary\" put it. Modern Buddhist scholarship has deprecated the pejorative term, and uses instead the term \"Nikaya Buddhism\" to refer to early Buddhist schools. \n\n\"Hinayana\" has also been used as a synonym for Theravada, which is the main tradition of Buddhism in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia; this is considered inaccurate and derogatory. Robert Thurman writes, \"'Nikaya Buddhism' is a coinage of Professor Masatoshi Nagatomi of Harvard University, who suggested it to me as a usage for the eighteen schools of Indian Buddhism to avoid the term 'Hinayana Buddhism,' which is found offensive by some members of the Theravada tradition.\" \n\nWithin Mahayana Buddhism, there were a variety of interpretations as to whom or to what the term \"Hinayana\" referred. Kalu Rinpoche stated the \"lesser\" or \"greater\" designation \"did not refer to economic or social status, but concerned the spiritual capacities of the practitioner\".\nThe Chinese monk Yijing, who visited India in the 7th century, distinguished Mahāyāna from Hīnayāna as follows:\nThe word \"hīnayāna\" is formed of \"hīna\": \"little\", \"poor\", \"inferior\", \"abandoned\", \"deficient\", \"defective\"; and \"yāna\" (यान): \"vehicle\", where \"vehicle\" means \"a way of going to enlightenment\". The Pali Text Society's \"Pali-English Dictionary\" (1921–25) defines \"hīna\" in even stronger terms, with a semantic field that includes \"poor, miserable; vile, base, abject, contemptible\", and \"despicable\".\n\nThe term was translated by Kumārajīva and others into Classical Chinese as \"small vehicle\" (小 meaning \"small\", 乘 meaning \"vehicle\"), although earlier and more accurate translations of the term also exist. In Mongolian (\"Baga Holgon\") the term for hinayana also means \"small\" or \"lesser\" vehicle, while in Tibetan there are at least two words to designate the term, \"theg chung\" meaning \"small vehicle\" and \"theg dman\" meaning \"inferior vehicle\" or \"inferior spiritual approach\".\n\nThrangu Rinpoche has emphasized that \"hinayana\" is in no way implying \"inferior\". In his translation and commentary of Asanga's \"Distinguishing Dharma from Dharmata\", he writes, \"all three traditions of hinayana, mahayana, and vajrayana were practiced in Tibet and that the hinayana which literally means \"lesser vehicle\" is in no way inferior to the mahayana.\"\n\nAccording to Jan Nattier, it is most likely that the term Hīnayāna postdates the term Mahāyāna and was only added at a later date due to antagonism and conflict between the bodhisattva and śrāvaka ideals. The sequence of terms then began with the term \"Bodhisattvayāna\" \"bodhisattva-vehicle\", which was given the epithet Mahāyāna \"Great Vehicle\". It was only later, after attitudes toward the bodhisattva teachings had become more critical, that the term Hīnayāna was created as a back-formation, contrasting with the already established term Mahāyāna. The earliest Mahāyāna texts often use the term Mahāyāna as an epithet and synonym for Bodhisattvayāna, but the term Hīnayāna is comparatively rare in early texts, and is usually not found at all in the earliest translations. Therefore, the often-perceived symmetry between Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna can be deceptive, as the terms were not actually coined in relation to one another in the same era.\n\nAccording to Paul Williams, \"the deep-rooted misconception concerning an unfailing, ubiquitous fierce criticism of the Lesser Vehicle by the [Mahāyāna] is not supported by our texts.\" Williams states that while evidence of conflict is present in some cases, there is also substantial evidence demonstrating peaceful coexistence between the two traditions.\n\nAlthough the 18–20 early Buddhist schools are sometimes loosely classified as Hīnayāna in modern times, this is not necessarily accurate. There is no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school of Buddhism but rather as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines. Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate vinaya or ordination lineage from the early Buddhist schools, and therefore bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs adhering to the Mahāyāna formally adheres to the vinaya of an early school. This continues today with the Dharmaguptaka ordination lineage in East Asia and the Mūlasarvāstivāda ordination lineage in Tibetan Buddhism. Mahāyāna was never a separate sect of the early schools. From Chinese monks visiting India, we now know that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side.\n\nThe Chinese Buddhist monk and pilgrim Yijing wrote about the relationship between the various \"vehicles\" and the early Buddhist schools in India. He wrote, \"There exist in the West numerous subdivisions of the schools which have different origins, but there are only four principal schools of continuous tradition.\" These schools are the Mahāsāṃghika Nikāya, Sthavira nikāya, Mūlasarvāstivāda Nikāya, and Saṃmitīya Nikāya. Explaining their doctrinal affiliations, he then writes, \"Which of the four schools should be grouped with the Mahāyāna or with the Hīnayāna is not determined.\" That is to say, there was no simple correspondence between a Buddhist school and whether its members learn \"Hīnayāna\" or \"Mahāyāna\" teachings.\n\nTo identify entire schools as \"Hīnayāna\" that contained not only śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas but also Mahāyāna bodhisattvas would be attacking the schools of their fellow Mahāyānists as well as their own. Instead, what is demonstrated in the definition of \"Hīnayāna\" given by Yijing is that the term referred to individuals based on doctrinal differences.\n\nScholar Isabelle Onians asserts that although \"the Mahāyāna ... very occasionally referred to earlier Buddhism as the Hinayāna, the Inferior Way, [...] the preponderance of this name in the secondary literature is far out of proportion to occurrences in the Indian texts.\" She notes that the term Śrāvakayāna was \"the more politically correct and much more usual\" term used by Mahāyānists. Jonathan Silk has argued that the term \"Hinayana\" was used to refer to whomever one wanted to criticize on any given occasion, and did not refer to any definite grouping of Buddhists.\n\nIn the 7th century, the Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang describes the concurrent existence of the Mahāvihara and the Abhayagiri vihāra in Sri Lanka. He refers to the monks of the Mahāvihara as the \"Hīnayāna Sthaviras\" and the monks of Abhayagiri vihāra as the \"Mahāyāna Sthaviras\". Xuanzang further writes, \"The Mahāvihāravāsins reject the Mahāyāna and practice the Hīnayāna, while the Abhayagirivihāravāsins study both Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna teachings and propagate the \"Tripiṭaka\".\"\n\nMahayanists were primarily in philosophical dialectic with the Vaibhāṣika school of Sarvāstivāda, which had by far the most \"comprehensive edifice of doctrinal systematics\" of the nikāya schools. With this in mind it is sometimes argued that the Theravada would not have been considered a \"Hinayana\" school by Mahayanists because, unlike the now-extinct Sarvastivada school, the primary object of Mahayana criticism, the Theravada school does not claim the existence of independent dharmas; in this it maintains the attitude of early Buddhism. Additionally, the concept of the bodhisattva as one who puts off enlightenment rather than reaching awakening as soon as possible, has no roots in Theravada textual or cultural contexts, current or historical. Aside from the Theravada schools being geographically distant from the Mahayana, the Hinayana distinction is used in reference to certain views and practices that had become found within the Mahayana tradition itself. Theravada, as well as Mahayana schools stress the urgency of one's own awakening in order to end suffering. Some contemporary Theravadin figures have thus indicated a sympathetic stance toward the Mahayana philosophy found in the \"Heart Sutra\" and the \"Mūlamadhyamakakārikā\".\n\nThe Mahayanists were bothered by the substantialist thought of the Sarvāstivādins and Sautrāntikins, and in emphasizing the doctrine of śūnyatā, David Kalupahana holds that they endeavored to preserve the early teaching. The Theravadins too refuted the Sarvāstivādins and Sautrāntikins (and followers of other schools) on the grounds that their theories were in conflict with the non-substantialism of the canon. The Theravada arguments are preserved in the \"Kathavatthu\".\n\nMost western scholars regard the Theravada school to be one of the Hinayana schools referred to in Mahayana literature, or regard Hinayana as a synonym for Theravada. These scholars understand the term to refer to schools of Buddhism that did not accept the teachings of the Mahāyāna sūtras as authentic teachings of the Buddha. At the same time, scholars have objected to the pejorative connotation of the term Hinayana and some scholars do not use it for any school.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2331978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331978", "title": "History of Hinduism", "text": "History of Hinduism\n\nHistory of Hinduism denotes a wide variety of related religious traditions native to the Indian subcontinent. Its history overlaps or coincides with the development of religion in Indian subcontinent since the Iron Age, with some of its traditions tracing back to prehistoric religions such as those of the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization. It has thus been called the \"oldest religion\" in the world. Scholars regard Hinduism as a synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions, with diverse roots and no single founder.\n\nThe history of Hinduism is often divided into periods of development. The first period is the pre-Vedic period, which includes the Indus Valley Civilisation and local pre-historic religions, ending at about 1750 BCE. This period was followed in northern India by the Vedic period, which saw the introduction of the historical Vedic religion with the Indo-Aryan migrations, starting somewhere between 1900 BCE to 1400 BCE. The subsequent period, between 800 BCE and 200 BCE, is \"a turning point between the Vedic religion and Hindu religions\", and a formative period for Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. The Epic and Early Puranic period, from c. 200 BCE to 500 CE, saw the classical \"Golden Age\" of Hinduism (c. 320-650 CE), which coincides with the Gupta Empire. In this period the six branches of Hindu philosophy evolved, namely Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mīmāṃsā, and Vedanta. Monotheistic sects like Shaivism and Vaishnavism developed during this same period through the Bhakti movement. The period from roughly 650 to 1100 CE forms the late Classical period or early Middle Ages, in which classical Puranic Hinduism is established, and Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta, which incorporated Buddhist thought into Vedanta, marking a shift from realistic to idealistic thought.\n\nHinduism under both Hindu and Islamic rulers from c. 1200 to 1750 CE, saw the increasing prominence of the Bhakti movement, which remains influential today. The colonial period saw the emergence of various Hindu reform movements partly inspired by western movements, such as Unitarianism and Theosophy. The Partition of India in 1947 was along religious lines, with the Republic of India emerging with a Hindu majority. During the 20th century, due to the Indian diaspora, Hindu minorities have formed in all continents, with the largest communities in absolute numbers in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nWestern scholars regard Hinduism as a fusion or synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions.\nAmong its roots are the historical Vedic religion of Iron Age northern India itself already the product of \"a composite of the Indo-Aryan and Harappan cultures and civilizations\", but also the Sramana or renouncer traditions of northeast India, and mesolithic and neolithic cultures of India, such as the religions of the Indus Valley Civilisation, Dravidian traditions, and the local traditions and tribal religions.\n\nAfter the Vedic period, between 500-200 BCE and c. 300 CE, at the beginning of the \"Epic and Puranic\" c.q. \"Preclassical\" period, the \"Hindu synthesis\" emerged, which incorporated śramaṇic and Buddhist influences and the emerging \"bhakti\" tradition into the Brahmanical fold via the \"smriti\" literature. This synthesis emerged under the pressure of the success of Buddhism and Jainism. During the Gupta reign the first Puranas were written, which were used to disseminate \"mainstream religious ideology amongst pre-literate and tribal groups undergoing acculturation.\" The resulting Puranic Hinduism differed markedly from the earlier Brahmanism of the Dharmaśāstras and the \"smritis\". Hinduism co-existed for several centuries with Buddhism, to finally gain the upper hand at all levels in the 8th century.\n\nFrom northern India this \"Hindu synthesis\", and its societal divisions, spread to southern India and parts of Southeast Asia. It was aided by the settlement of Brahmins on land granted by local rulers, the incorporation and assimilation of popular non-Vedic gods, and the process of Sanskritization, in which \"people from many strata of society throughout the subcontinent tended to adapt their religious and social life to Brahmanic norms\". This process of assimilation explains the wide diversity of local cultures in India \"half shrouded in a taddered cloak of conceptual unity.\"\n\nJames Mill (1773–1836), in his \"The History of British India\" (1817), distinguished three phases in the history of India, namely Hindu, Muslim and British civilisations. This periodisation has been criticised, for the misconceptions it has given rise to. Another periodisation is the division into \"ancient, classical, medieval and modern periods\", although this periodization has also received criticism.\n\nRomila Thapar notes that the division of Hindu-Muslim-British periods of Indian history gives too much weight to \"ruling dynasties and foreign invasions,\" neglecting the social-economic history which often showed a strong continuity. The division in Ancient-Medieval-Modern overlooks the fact that the Muslim-conquests took place between the eight and the fourteenth century, while the south was never completely conquered. According to Thapar, a periodisation could also be based on \"significant social and economic changes,\" which are not strictly related to a change of ruling powers.\n\nSmart and Michaels seem to follow Mill's periodisation, while Flood and Muesse follow the \"ancient, classical, medieval and modern periods\" periodisation. An elaborate periodisation may be as follows:\n\nThe earliest prehistoric religion in India that may have left its traces in Hinduism comes from mesolithic as observed in the sites such as the rock paintings of Bhimbetka rock shelters dating to a period of 30,000 BCE or older, as well as neolithic times. Some of the religious practices can be considered to have originated in 4,000 BCE. Several tribal religions still exist, though \"[w]e must not assume that there are many similarities between prehistoric and contemporary tribal communities\".\n\nSome Indus valley seals show swastikas, which are found in other religions worldwide. Phallic symbols interpreted as the much later Hindu linga have been found in the Harappan remains.\n\nIn view of the large number of figurines found in the Indus valley, some scholars believe that the Harappan people worshipped a mother goddess symbolizing fertility, a common practice among rural Hindus even today.\nHowever, this view has been disputed by S. Clark who sees it as an inadequate explanation of the function and construction of many of the figurines.\n\nThere are no religious buildings or evidence of elaborate burials... If there were temples, they have not been identified. However, House - 1 in HR-A area in Mohenjadaro's Lower Town has been identified as a possible temple.\n\nThe commonly proposed period of earlier Vedic age is dated back to 2nd millennium BCE. Vedism was the sacrificial religion of the early Indo-Aryans, speakers of early Old Indic dialects, ultimately deriving from the Proto-Indo-Iranian peoples of the Bronze Age who lived on the Central Asian steppes.\n\nThe Vedic period, named after the Vedic religion of the Indo-Aryans, lasted from c. 1750 to 500 BCE. The Indo-Aryans were a branch of the Indo-European language family, which many scholars believe originated in Kurgan culture of the Central Asian steppes. Indeed, the Vedic religion, including the names of certain deities, was in essence a branch of the same religious tradition as the ancient Greeks, Romans, Persians, and Germanic peoples. For example, the Vedic god Dyaus Pita is a variant of the Proto-Indo-European god *Dyēus phter (or simply *Dyēus), from which also derive the Greek Zeus and the Roman Jupiter. Similarly the Vedic Manu and Yama derive from the PIE *Manu and *Yemo, from which also derive the Germanic Mannus and Ymir.\n\nAccording to the Indo-European migration theory, the Indo-Iranians were the common ancestor of the Indo-Aryans and the Proto-Iranians. The Indo-Iranians split into the Indo-Aryans and Iranians around 1800-1600 BC.\n\nThe Indo-Aryans were pastoralists who migrated into north-western India after the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilization, The Indo-Aryans were a branch of the Indo-Iranians, which originated in the Andronovo culture in the Bactria-Margiana era, in present northern Afghanistan. The roots of this culture go back further to the Sintashta culture, with funeral sacrifices which show close parallels to the sacrificial funeral rites of the \"Rig Veda\".\n\nDuring the Early Vedic period (c. 1500 - 1100 BCE) Vedic tribes were pastoralists in north-west India. After 1100 BCE, with the introduction of iron, the Vedic tribes moved into the western Ganges Plain, adapting an agrarian lifestyle. Rudimentary state-forms appeared, of which the Kuru-tribe and realm was the most influential. It was a tribal union, which developed into the first recorded state-level society in South Asia around 1000 BCE. It decisively changed the Vedic heritage of the early Vedic period, collecting the Vedic hymns into collections, and developing new rituals which gained their position in Indian civilization as the orthodox srauta rituals, which contributed to the so-called \"classical synthesis\" or \"Hindu synthesis\".\n\nThe Indo-Aryans brought with them their language and religion. The Vedic beliefs and practices of the pre-classical era were closely related to the hypothesised Proto-Indo-European religion, and the Indo-Iranian religion. According to Anthony, the Old Indic religion probably emerged among Indo-European immigrants in the contact zone between the Zeravshan River (present-day Uzbekistan) and (present-day) Iran. It was \"a syncretic mixture of old Central Asian and new Indo-European elements\", which borrowed \"distinctive religious beliefs and practices\" from the Bactria–Margiana Culture. At least 383 non-Indo-European words were borrowed from this culture, including the god Indra and the ritual drink Soma. According to Anthony,\nThe oldest inscriptions in Old Indic, the language of the \"Rig Veda\", are found not in northwestern India and Pakistan, but in northern Syria, the location of the Mitanni kingdom. The Mitanni kings took Old Indic throne names, and Old Indic technical terms were used for horse-riding and chariot-driving. The Old Indic term r'ta, meaning \"cosmic order and truth\", the central concept of the \"Rig Veda\", was also employed in the mitanni kingdom. And Old Indic gods, including Indra, were also known in the Mitanni kingdom.\n\nTheir religion was further developed when they migrated into the Ganges Plain after c. 1100 BCE and became settled farmers, further syncretising with the native cultures of northern India. The Vedic religion of the later Vedic period co-existed with local religions, such as the Yaksha cults, and was itself the product of \"a composite of the indo-Aryan and Harappan cultures and civilizations\". David Gordon White cites three other mainstream scholars who \"have emphatically demonstrated\" that Vedic religion is partially derived from the Indus Valley Civilizations. \n\nIts liturgy is preserved in the three Vedic Samhitas: the Rig-Veda, Sama-Veda and the Yajur-Veda. The Vedic texts were the texts of the elite, and do not necessarily represent popular ideas or practices. Of these, the Rig-Veda is the oldest, a collection of hymns composed between ca. 1500-1200 BCE. The other two add ceremonial detail for the performance of the actual sacrifice. The Atharva-Veda may also contain compositions dating to before 1000 BCE. It contains material pertinent to domestic ritual and folk magic of the period.\n\nThese texts, as well as the voluminous commentary on orthopraxy collected in the Brahmanas compiled during the early 1st millennium BCE, were transmitted by oral tradition alone until the advent, in the 4th century AD, of the Pallava and Gupta period and by a combination of written and oral tradition since then.\n\nThe Hindu samskaras\nThe earliest text of the Vedas is the Rigveda, a collection of poetic hymns used in the sacrificial rites of Vedic priesthood. Many Rigvedic hymns concern the fire ritual (Agnihotra) and especially the offering of Soma to the gods (Somayajna). Soma is both an intoxicant and a god itself, as is the sacrificial fire, Agni. The royal horse sacrifice (Ashvamedha) is a central rite in the Yajurveda.\n\nThe gods in the Rig-Veda are mostly personified concepts, who fall into two categories: the devas – who were gods of nature – such as the weather deity Indra (who is also the King of the gods), Agni (\"fire\"), Usha (\"dawn\"), Surya (\"sun\") and Apas (\"waters\") on the one hand, and on the other hand the asuras – gods of moral concepts – such as Mitra (\"contract\"), Aryaman (guardian of guest, friendship and marriage), Bhaga (\"share\") or Varuna, the supreme Asura (or Aditya). While Rigvedic \"deva\" is variously applied to most gods, including many of the Asuras, the Devas are characterised as Younger Gods while Asuras are the Older Gods (pūrve devāḥ). In later Vedic texts, the Asuras become demons.\n\nThe Rigveda has 10 Mandalas ('books'). There is significant variation in the language and style between the family books (RV books 2–7), book 8, the \"Soma Mandala\" (RV 9), and the more recent books 1 and 10. The older books share many aspects of common Indo-Iranian religion, and is an important source for the reconstruction of earlier common Indo-European traditions. Especially RV 8 has striking similarity to the Avesta, containing allusions to Afghan Flora and Fauna, e.g. to camels (\"\" = Avestan \"uštra\"). Many of the central religious terms in Vedic Sanskrit have cognates in the religious vocabulary of other Indo-European languages (\"deva\": Latin \"deus\"; \"hotar\": Germanic \"god\"; \"asura\": Germanic \"ansuz\"; \"yajna\": Greek \"hagios\"; \"brahman\": Norse \"Bragi\" or perhaps Latin \"flamen\" etc.). In the Avesta, Asura (Ahura) is considered good and Devas (Daevas) are considered evil entities, quite the opposite of the Rig Veda.\n\nEthics in the Vedas are based on the concepts of Satya and Rta. Satya is the principle of integration rooted in the Absolute. Ṛta is the expression of Satya, which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe and everything within it. Conformity with Ṛta would enable progress whereas its violation would lead to punishment. Panikkar remarks: \nThe term \"dharma\" was already used in Brahmanical thought, where it was conceived as an aspect of Rta. The term rta is also known from the Proto-Indo-Iranian religion, the religion of the Indo-Iranian peoples prior to the earliest Vedic (Indo-Aryan) and Zoroastrian (Iranian) scriptures. \"Asha\" (\"aša\") is the Avestan language term corresponding to Vedic language ṛta.\n\nThe 9th and 8th centuries BCE witnessed the composition of the earliest Upanishads. Upanishads form the theoretical basis of classical Hinduism and are known as Vedanta (conclusion of the Veda). The older Upanishads launched attacks of increasing intensity on the rituals, however, a philosophical and allegorical meaning is also given to these rituals. In some later Upanishads there is a spirit of accommodation towards rituals. The tendency which appears in the philosophical hymns of the Vedas to reduce the number of gods to one principle becomes prominent in the Upanishads. The diverse monistic speculations of the Upanishads were synthesised into a theistic framework by the sacred Hindu scripture \"Bhagavad Gita\".\n\nIn Iron Age India, during a period roughly spanning the 10th to 6th centuries BCE, the Mahajanapadas arise from the earlier petty kingdoms of the various Rigvedic tribes, and the failing remnants of the Late Harappan culture. In this period the \"mantra\" portions of the Vedas are largely completed, and a flowering industry of Vedic priesthood organised in numerous schools (shakha) develops exegetical literature, viz. the Brahmanas. These schools also edited the Vedic \"mantra\" portions into fixed recensions, that were to be preserved purely by oral tradition over the following two millennia.\n\nIncreasing urbanisation of India in the 7th and 6th centuries BCE led to the rise of new ascetic or sramana movements which challenged the orthodoxy of rituals. Mahavira (c. 549–477 BCE), proponent of Jainism, and Buddha (c. 563-483 BCE), founder of Buddhism, were the most prominent icons of this movement. According to Heinrich Zimmer, Jainism and Buddhism are part of the pre-Vedic heritage, which also includes Samkhya and Yoga:\nThe Sramana tradition in part created the concept of the cycle of birth and death, the concept of samsara, and the concept of liberation, which became characteristic for Hinduism.\n\nPratt notes that Oldenberg (1854-1920), Neumann (1865-1915) and Radhakrishnan (1888-1975) believed that the Buddhist canon had been influenced by Upanishads, while la Vallee Poussin thinks the influence was nihil, and \"Eliot and several others insist that on some points the Buddha was directly antithetical to the Upanishads\".\n\nVedism as the religious tradition of Hinduism of a priestly elite was marginalised by other traditions such as Jainism and Buddhism in the later Iron Age, but in the Middle Ages would rise to renewed prestige with the Mimamsa school, which as well as all other \"astika\" traditions of Hinduism, considered them authorless (\"apaurusheyatva\") and eternal. A last surviving elements of the Historical Vedic religion or Vedism is Śrauta tradition, following many major elements of Vedic religion and is prominent in Southern India, with communities in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, but also in some pockets of Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and other states; the best known of these groups are the Nambudiri of Kerala, whose traditions were notably documented by Frits Staal.\n\nThe Mauryan period saw an early flowering of classical Sanskrit Sutra and Shastra literature and the scholarly exposition of the \"circum-Vedic\" fields of the Vedanga. However, during this time Buddhism was patronised by Ashoka, who ruled large parts of India, and Buddhism was also the mainstream religion until the Gupta empire period.\n\nSince Vedic times, \"people from many strata of society throughout the subcontinent tended to adapt their religious and social life to Brahmanic norms\", a process sometimes called Sanskritization. It is reflected in the tendency to identify local deities with the gods of the Sanskrit texts.\n\nBetween 500-200 BCE and c. 300 CE developed the \"Hindu synthesis\", which incorporated Sramanic and Buddhist influences and the emerging \"bhakti\" tradition into the Brahmanical fold via the \"smriti\" literature. This synthesis emerged under the pressure of the success of Buddhism and Jainism.\n\nAccording to Embree, several other religious traditions had existed side by side with the Vedic religion. These indigenous religions \"eventually found a place under the broad mantle of the Vedic religion\". When Brahmanism was declining and had to compete with Buddhism and Jainism, the popular religions had the opportunity to assert themselves. According to Embree, \nAccording to Larson, the Brahmins responded with assimilation and consolidation. This is reflected in the \"smriti\" literature which took shape in this period. The \"smriti\" texts of the period between 200 BCE-100 CE proclaim the authority of the Vedas, and acceptance of the Vedas became a central criterium for defining Hinduism over and against the heterodoxies, which rejected the Vedas. Most of the basic ideas and practices of classical Hinduism derive from the new \"smriti\" literature.\n\nOf the six Hindu darsanas, the Mimamsa and the Vedanta \"are rooted primarily in the Vedic \"sruti\" tradition and are sometimes called \"smarta\" schools in the sense that they develop \"smarta\" orthodox current of thoughts that are based, like \"smriti\", directly on \"sruti\". According to Hiltebeitel, \"the consolidation of Hinduism takes place under the sign of \"bhakti\"\". It is the \"Bhagavadgita\" that seals this achievement. The result is an \"universal achievement\" that may be called \"smarta\". It views Shiva and Vishnu as \"complementary in their functions but ontologically identical\".\n\nThe major Sanskrit epics, \"Ramayana\" and \"Mahabharata\", which belong to the \"smriti\", were compiled over a protracted period during the late centuries BCE and the early centuries CE. They contain mythological stories about the rulers and wars of ancient India, and are interspersed with religious and philosophical treatises. The later Puranas recount tales about devas and devis, their interactions with humans and their battles against rakshasa. The Bhagavad Gita \"seals the achievement\" of the \"consolidation of Hinduism\", integrating Brahmanic and sramanic ideas with theistic devotion.\n\nIn early centuries CE several schools of Hindu philosophy were formally codified, including Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Purva-Mimamsa and Vedanta.\n\nThe Sangam literature (300 BCE – 300 CE) is a mostly secular body of classical literature in the Tamil language. Nonetheless there are some works, significantly Pattupathu and Paripaatal, wherein the personal devotion to god was written in form of devotional poems. Vishnu, Shiva and Murugan were mentioned gods. These works are therefore the earliest evidences of monotheistic Bhakti traditions, preceding the large bhakti movement, which was given great attention in later times.\n\nDuring this period, power was centralised, along with a growth of near distance trade, standardization of legal procedures, and general spread of literacy. Mahayana Buddhism flourished, but orthodox Brahmana culture began to be rejuvenated by the patronage of the Gupta Dynasty, who were Vaishnavas. The position of the Brahmans was reinforced, the first Hindu temples dedicated to the gods of the Hindu deities, emerged during the late Gupta age. During the Gupta reign the first Puranas were written, which were used to disseminate \"mainstream religious ideology amongst pre-literate and tribal groups undergoing acculturation.\" The Guptas patronised the newly emerging Puranic religion, seeking legitimacy for their dynasty. The resulting Puranic Hinduism, differed markedly from the earlier Brahmanism of the Dharmasastras and the \"smritis\".\n\nAccording to P.S. Sharma \"the Gupta and Harsha periods form really, from the strictly intellectual standpoint, the most brilliant epocha in the development of Indian philosophy\", as Hindu and Buddhist philosophies flourished side by side. Charvaka, the atheistic materialist school, came to the fore in North India before the 8th century CE.\n\nThe Gupta period (4th to 6th centuries) saw a flowering of scholarship, the emergence of the classical schools of Hindu philosophy, and of classical Sanskrit literature in general on topics ranging from medicine, veterinary science, mathematics, to astrology and astronomy and astrophysics. The famous Aryabhata and Varahamihira belong to this age. The Gupta established a strong central government which also allowed a degree of local control. Gupta society was ordered in accordance with Hindu beliefs. This included a strict caste system, or class system. The peace and prosperity created under Gupta leadership enabled the pursuit of scientific and artistic endeavors.\n\nThe Pallavas (4th to 9th centuries) were, alongside the Guptas of the North, patronisers of Sanskrit in the South of the Indian subcontinent. The Pallava reign saw the first Sanskrit inscriptions in a script called Grantha. Early Pallavas had different connexions to Southeast Asian countries. The Pallavas used Dravidian architecture to build some very important Hindu temples and academies in Mamallapuram, Kanchipuram and other places; their rule saw the rise of great poets, who are as famous as Kalidasa.\n\nThe practice of dedicating temples to different deities came into vogue followed by fine artistic temple architecture and sculpture (see Vastu Shastra).\n\nThis period saw the emergence of the Bhakti movement. The Bhakti movement was a rapid growth of \"bhakti\" beginning in Tamil Nadu in Southern India with the Saiva Nayanars (4th to 10th centuries CE) and the Vaisnava Alvars (3rd to 9th centuries CE) who spread \"bhakti\" poetry and devotion throughout India by the 12th to 18th centuries CE.\n\nHindu influences reached the Indonesian Archipelago as early as first century. At this time, India started to strongly influence Southeast Asian countries. Trade routes linked India with southern Burma, central and southern Siam, lower Cambodia and southern Vietnam and numerous urbanised coastal settlements were established there.\n\nFor more than a thousand years, Indian Hindu/Buddhist influence was therefore the major factor that brought a certain level of cultural unity to the various countries of the region. The Pali and Sanskrit languages and the Indian script, together with Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism, Brahmanism and Hinduism, were transmitted from direct contact as well as through sacred texts and Indian literature, such as the Ramayana and the Mahabharata epics.\n\nFrom the 5th to the 13th century, South-East Asia had very powerful Indian colonial empires and became extremely active in Hindu and Buddhist architectural and artistic creation. The Sri Vijaya Empire to the south and the Khmer Empire to the north competed for influence.\n\nLangkasuka (-\"langkha\" Sanskrit for \"resplendent land\" -\"sukkha\" of \"bliss\") was an ancient Hindu kingdom located in the Malay Peninsula. The kingdom, along with Old Kedah settlement, are probably the earliest territorial footholds founded on the Malay Peninsula. According to tradition, the founding of the kingdom happened in the 2nd century; Malay legends claim that Langkasuka was founded at Kedah, and later moved to Pattani.\n\nFrom the 5th-15th centuries Sri Vijayan empire, a maritime empire centred on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia, had adopted Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism under a line of rulers named the Sailendras. The Empire of Sri Vijaya declined due to conflicts with the Chola rulers of India. The Majapahit Empire succeeded the Singhasari empire. It was one of the last and greatest Hindu empires in Maritime Southeast Asia.\n\nFunan was a pre-Angkor Cambodian kingdom, located around the Mekong delta, probably established by Mon-Khmer settlers speaking an Austroasiatic language. According to reports by two Chinese envoys, K'ang T'ai and Chu Ying, the state was established by an Indian Brahmin named Kaundinya, who in the 1st century CE was given instruction in a dream to take a magic bow from a temple and defeat a Khmer queen, Soma. Soma, the daughter of the king of the Nagas, married Kaundinya and their lineage became the royal dynasty of Funan. The myth had the advantage of providing the legitimacy of both an Indian Brahmin and the divinity of the cobras, who at that time were held in religious regard by the inhabitants of the region.\n\nThe kingdom of Champa (or \"Lin-yi\" in Chinese records) controlled what is now south and central Vietnam from approximately 192 through 1697. The dominant religion of the Cham people was Hinduism and the culture was heavily influenced by India.\n\nLater, from the 9th to the 13th century, the Mahayana Buddhist and Hindu Khmer Empire dominated much of the South-East Asian peninsula. Under the Khmer, more than 900 temples were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand. Angkor was at the centre of this development, with a temple complex and urban organisation able to support around one million urban dwellers. The largest temple complex of the world, Angkor Wat, stands here; built by the king Vishnuvardhan.\n\nAfter the end of the Gupta Empire and the collapse of the Harsha Empire, power became decentralised in India. Several larger kingdoms emerged, with \"countless vasal states\". The kingdoms were ruled via a feudal system. Smaller kingdoms were dependent on the protection of the larger kingdoms. \"The great king was remote, was exalted and deified\", as reflected in the Tantric Mandala, which could also depict the king as the centre of the mandala.\n\nThe disintegration of central power also lead to regionalisation of religiosity, and religious rivalry. Local cults and languages were enhanced, and the influence of \"Brahmanic ritualistic Hinduism\" was diminished. Rural and devotional movements arose, along with Shaivism, Vaisnavism, Bhakti and Tantra, though \"sectarian groupings were only at the beginning of their development\". Religious movements had to compete for recognition by the local lords. Buddhism lost its position after the 8th century, and began to disappear in India. This was reflected in the change of puja-ceremonies at the courts in the 8th century, where Hindu gods replaced the Buddha as the \"supreme, imperial deity\".\n\nThe Brahmanism of the Dharmashastras and the \"smritis\" underwent a radical transformation at the hands of the Purana composers, resulting in the rise of Puranic Hinduism, \"which like a colossus striding across the religious firmanent soon came to overshadow all existing religions\". Puranic Hinduism was a \"multiplex belief-system which grew and expanded as it absorbed and synthesised polaristic ideas and cultic traditions\" It was distinguished from its Vedic Smarta roots by its popular base, its theological and sectarioan pluralism, its Tantric veneer, and the central place of \"bhakti\".\n\nThe early mediaeval Puranas were composed to disseminate religious mainstream ideology among the pre-literate tribal societies undergoing acculturation. With the breakdown of the Gupta empire, gifts of virgin waste-land were heaped on brahmanas, to ensure provitable agrarical exploitation of land owned by the kings, but also to provide status to the new ruling classes. Brahmanas spread further over India, interacting with local clans with different religions and ideologies. The Brahmanas used the Puranas to incorporate those clans into the agrarical society and its accompanying religion and ideology. According to Flood, \"[t]he Brahmans who followed the puranic religion became known as \"smarta\", those whose worship was based on the \"smriti\", or \"pauranika\", those based on the Puranas.\" Local chiefs and peasants were absorbed into the varna, which was used to keep \"control over the new \"kshatriyas\" and \"shudras\".\" The Brahmanic group was enlarged by incorporating local subgroups, such as local priests. This also lead to a stratification within the Brahmins, with some Brahmins having a lower status than other Brahmins. The use of caste worked better with the new Puranic Hinduism than with the sramanic sects. The Puranic texts provided extensive genealogies which gave status to the new \"kshatriyas\". Buddhist myths pictured government as a contract between an elected ruler and the people. And the Buddhist \"chakkavatti\" \"was a distinct concept from the models of conquest held up to the \"kshatriyas\" and the Rajputs.\"\n\nMany local religions and traditions were assimilated into puranic Hinduism. Vishnu and Shiva emerged as the main deities, together with Sakti/Deva. Vishnu subsumed the cults of Narayana, Jagannaths, Venkateswara \"and many others\". Nath:\nThe transformation of Brahmanism into Pauranic Hinduism in post-Gupta India was due to a process of acculturation. The Puranas helped establish a religious mainstream among the pre-literate tribal societies undergoing acculturation. The tenets of Brahmanism and of the Dharmashastras underwent a radical transformation at the hands of the Purana composers, resulting in the rise of a mainstream \"Hinduism\" that overshadowed all earlier traditions.\n\nRama and Krishna became the focus of a strong \"bhakti\" tradition, which found expression particularly in the \"Bhagavata Purana\". The Krishna tradition subsumed numerous Naga, yaksa and hill and tree based cults. Siva absorbed local cults by the suffixing of \"Isa\" or \"Isvara\" to the name of the local deity, for example Bhutesvara, Hatakesvara, Chandesvara. In 8th-century royal circles, the Buddha started to be replaced by Hindu gods in pujas. This also was the same period of time the Buddha was made into an avatar of Vishnu.\n\nThe first documented bhakti movement was founded by Karaikkal-ammaiyar. She wrote poems in Tamil about her love for Shiva and probably lived around the 6th century CE. The twelve Alvars who were Vaishnavite devotees and the sixty-three Nayanars who were Shaivite devotees nurtured the incipient bhakti movement in Tamil Nadu.\n\nDuring the 12th century CE in Karnataka, the Bhakti movement took the form of the Virashaiva movement. It was inspired by Basavanna, a Hindu reformer who created the sect of Lingayats or Shiva \"bhaktas\". During this time, a unique and native form of Kannada literature-poetry called Vachanas was born.\n\nShankara (8th century CE) is regarded as the greatest exponent of Advaita Vedanta. Shankara himself, and his grand-teacher Gaudapada, were influenced by Buddhism. Gaudapda took over the Buddhist doctrines that ultimate reality is pure consciousness (\"vijñapti-mātra\") and \"that the nature of the world is the four-cornered negation\". Gaudapada \"wove [both doctrines] into a philosophy of the \"Mandukya Upanishad\", which was further developed by Shankara\". Gaudapada also took over the Buddhist concept of \"ajāta\" from Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka philosophy. Shankara succeeded in reading Gaudapada's \"mayavada\" into Badarayana's \"Brahma Sutras\", \"and give it a \"locus classicus\"\", against the realistic strain of the \"Brahma Sutras\".\n\nShankara is the founder of the \"Dashanami Sampradaya\" of Hindu monasticism and \"Shanmata\" tradition of worship. Shankara is also regarded as the greatest teacher and reformer of the Smartha Tradition. According to Hinduism-guide.com:\nIn modern times, due to the influence of western Orientalism and Perennialism on Indian Neo-Vedanta and Hindu nationalism, Advaita Vedanta has acquired a broad acceptance in Indian culture and beyond as the paradigmatic example of Hindu spirituality.\n\nHindu and also Buddhist religious and secular learning had first reached Persia in an organised manner in the 6th century, when the Sassanid Emperor Khosrau I (531–579) deputed Borzuya the physician as his envoy, to invite Indian and Chinese scholars to the Academy of Gundishapur. Burzoe had translated the Sanskrit Panchatantra. His Pahlavi version was translated into Arabic by Ibn al-Moqaffa under the title of \"Kalila and Dimna\" or \"The Fables of Bidpai\".\n\nUnder the Abbasid caliphate, Baghdad had replaced Gundishapur as the most important centre of learning in the then vast Islamic Empire, wherein the traditions as well as scholars of the latter flourished. Hindu scholars were invited to the conferences on sciences and mathematics held in Baghdad.\n\nThough Islam came to Indian subcontinent in the early 7th century with the advent of Arab traders, it started impacting Indian religions after the 10th century, and particularly after the 12th century with the establishment and then expansion of Islamic rule. Will Durant calls the Muslim conquest of India \"probably the bloodiest story in history\". During this period, Buddhism declined rapidly while Hinduism faced military-led and Sultanates-sponsored religious violence. There was a widespread practice of raids, seizure and enslavement of families of Hindus, who were then sold in Sultanate cities or exported to Central Asia. Some texts suggest a number of Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam. Starting with 13th century, for a period of some 500 years, very few texts, from the numerous written by Muslim court historians, mention any \"voluntary conversions of Hindus to Islam\", suggesting its insignificance and perhaps rarity of such conversions. Typically enslaved Hindus converted to Islam to gain their freedom. There were occasional exceptions to religious violence against Hinduism. Akbar, for example, recognized Hinduism, banned enslavement of the families of Hindu war captives, protected Hindu temples, and abolished discriminatory Jizya (head taxes) against Hindus. However, many Muslim rulers of Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire, before and after Akbar, from 12th century to 18th century, destroyed Hindu temples and persecuted non-Muslims.\n\nHinduism underwent profound changes, aided in part by teachers such as Ramanuja, Madhva, and Chaitanya. Followers of the Bhakti movement moved away from the abstract concept of Brahman, which the philosopher Adi Shankara consolidated a few centuries before, with emotional, passionate devotion towards the more accessible Avatars, especially Krishna and Rama. According to Nicholson, already between the 12th and the 16th century, \"certain thinkers began to treat as a single whole the diverse philosophical teachings of the Upanishads, epics, Puranas, and the schools known retrospectively as the \"six systems\" (\"saddarsana\") of mainstream Hindu philosophy.\" Michaels notes that a historicization emerged which preceded later nationalism, articulating ideas which glorified Hinduism and the past.\n\nThe fall of Vijayanagar Empire to Muslim rulers had marked the end of Hindu imperial assertions in the Deccan. But, taking advantage of an over-stretched Mughal Empire (1526–1857), Hinduism once again rose to political prestige, under the Maratha Empire, from 1674 to 1818.\n\nAfter the conquest of Persia by the Mongol Empire, a regional Turko-Persio-Mongol dynasty formed. Just as eastern Mongol dynasties inter-married with locals and adopted the local religion of Buddhism and the Chinese culture, this group adopted the local religion of Islam and the Persian culture; their descendants ruled in India as Mughals.\n\nThe official State religion of the Mughal Empire was Islam, with the preference to the jurisprudence of the Hanafi Madhhab (Mazhab). Hinduism remained under strain during Babur and Humanyun's reigns. Sher Shah Suri, the Afghan ruler of North India was comparatively non-repressive. Hinduism came to fore during the three-year rule of Hindu king 'Hemu' during 1553-56 when he had defeated Akbar at Agra and Delhi and had taken up the reign from Delhi as a Hindu 'Vikramaditya' king after his 'Rajyabhishake' or coronation at 'Purana Quila' in Delhi. However, during Mughal history, at times, subjects had freedom to practise any religion of their choice, though non-Muslim able-bodied adult males with income were obliged to pay the Jizya, which signified their status as Dhimmis.\n\nAkbar, the Mughal emperor Humayun's son and heir from his Sindhi queen Hameeda Banu Begum, had a broad vision of Indian and Islamic traditions. One of Emperor Akbar's most unusual ideas regarding religion was Din-i-Ilahi (Faith of God), which was an eclectic mix of Islam, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, Jainism and Christianity. It was proclaimed the state religion until his death. These actions however met with stiff opposition from the Muslim clergy, especially the Sufi Shaykh Alf Sani Ahmad Sirhindi. Akbar's abolition of poll-tax on non-Muslims, acceptance of ideas from other religious philosophies, toleration of public worship by all religions and his interest in other faiths showed an attitude of considerable religious tolerance, which, in the minds of his orthodox Muslim opponents, were tantamount to apostasy.\n\nAkbar's son, Jahangir, half Rajput, was also a religious moderate, his mother being Hindu. The influence of his two Hindu queens (the Maharani Maanbai and Maharani Jagat) kept religious moderation as a centre-piece of state policy which was extended under his son, Emperor Shah Jahan, who was by blood 75% Rajput and less than 25% Moghul.\n\nReligious orthodoxy would only play an important role during the reign of Shah Jahan's son and successor, Aurangzeb, a devout Sunni Muslim. Aurangzeb was comparatively less tolerant of other faiths than his predecessors had been, and his reign saw an increase in the number and importance of Islamic institutions and scholars. He led many military campaigns against the remaining non-Muslim powers of the Indian subcontinent – the Sikh states of the Punjab, the last independent Hindu Rajputs and the Maratha rebels – as also against the Shia Muslim kingdoms of the Deccan. He also virtually stamped out, from his empire, open proselytisation of Hindus and Muslims by foreign Christian Missionaries, who remained successfully active, however, in the adjoining regions: the present day Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Goa.\n\nThe Hindu Marathas long had lived in the Desh region around Satara, in the western portion of the Deccan plateau, where the plateau meets the eastern slopes of the Western Ghats mountains. They had resisted incursions into the region by the Muslim Mughal rulers of northern India. Under their ambitious leader Shivaji, the Maratha freed themselves from the Muslim sultans of Bijapur to the southeast and, becoming much more aggressive, began to frequently raid Mughal territory, eventually sacking the wealthy Mughal port of Surat in 1664. After substantial territorial gains, Shivaji was proclaimed 'Chhatrapati' (Emperor) in 1674; the Marathas had spread and conquered much of central India by Shivaji's death in 1680. Subsequently, under the able leadership of Brahmin prime ministers (Peshwas), the Maratha Empire reached its zenith; Pune, the seat of Peshwas, flowered as a centre of Hindu learning and traditions. The empire at its peak stretched from Tamil Nadu in the south, to Peshawar (modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan ) in the north, and Bengal and Andaman Islands in the east. In 1761, the Maratha army lost the Third Battle of Panipat to Ahmad Shah Abdali of the Afghan Durrani Empire which halted their imperial expansion into Afghanistan. Ten years after Panipat, the young Peshwa Madhavrao I's Maratha Resurrection reinstated Maratha authority over North India.\n\nIn 1761, the Maratha army lost the Third Battle of Panipat to Ahmad Shah Abdali of the Afghan Durrani Empire which halted their imperial expansion into Afghanistan. Ten years after Panipat, the Peshwa Madhavrao I's Maratha Resurrection reinstated Maratha authority over North India. In a bid to effectively manage the large empire, he gave semi-autonomy to the strongest of the knights, which created a confederacy of Maratha states. They became known as the Gaekwads of Baroda, the Holkars of Indore and Malwa, the Scindias of Gwalior and Ujjain, the Bhonsales of the Nagpur and the Puars of Dhar & Dewas. In 1775, the East India Company intervened in a Peshwa family succession struggle in Pune, which became the First Anglo-Maratha War. The Marathas remained the preeminent power in India until their defeat in the Second Anglo-Maratha War which left the East India Company in control of most of India.\n\nPortuguese missionaries had reached the Malabar Coast in the late 15th century, made contact with the St Thomas Christians in Kerala and sought to introduce the Latin Rite among them. Since the priests for St Thomas Christians were served by the Eastern Christian Churches, they were following Eastern Christian practices at that time. Throughout this period, foreign missionaries also made many new converts to Christianity. This led to the formation of the Latin Catholics in Kerala.\n\nThe Goa Inquisition was the office of the Christian Inquisition acting in the Indian city of Goa and the rest of the Portuguese empire in Asia. St. Francis Xavier, in a 1545 letter to John III, requested for an Inquisition to be installed in Goa. It was installed eight years after the death of Francis Xavier in 1552. Established in 1560 and operating until 1774, this highly controversial institution was aimed primarily at Hindus and wayward new converts.\n\nIn the century from 1760 to 1860, India was once more divided into numerous petty or unstable kingdoms, gradually coming under the paramountcy the British Empire: the \"lesser Mughals\", the Kingdom of Mysore, Hyderabad State, Maratha Confederacy, Rajput Kingdoms, Palaiyakkarar states, North-Eastern states such as Kingdom of Manipur, Himalayan states, etc. From 1799 to 1849 the only major stable kingdom in India was the Sikh Empire, although it had a syncretic character with a large number of Hindu and Muslim subjects living in peace. It too became unstable after the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. The entire subcontinent fell under British rule (partly indirectly, via princely states) following the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\n\nWith the onset of the British Raj, the colonization of India by the British, there also started a Hindu renaissance in the 19th century, which profoundly changed the understanding of Hinduism in both India and the west. Indology as an academic discipline of studying Indian culture from a European perspective was established in the 19th century, led by scholars such as Max Müller and John Woodroffe. They brought Vedic, Puranic and Tantric literature and philosophy to Europe and the United States. Western orientalist searched for the \"essence\" of the Indian religions, discerning this in the Vedas, and meanwhile creating the notion of \"Hinduism\" as a unified body of religious praxis and the popular picture of 'mystical India'. This idea of a Vedic essence was taken over by Hindu reform movements as the Brahmo Samaj, which was supported for a while by the Unitarian Church, together with the ideas of Universalism and Perennialism, the idea that all religions share a common mystic ground. This \"Hindu modernism\", with proponents like Vivekananda, Aurobindo and Radhakrishnan, became central in the popular understanding of Hinduism.\n\nDuring the 19th century, Hinduism developed a large number of new religious movements, partly inspired by the European Romanticism, nationalism, scientific racism and esotericism (Theosophy) popular at the time (while conversely and contemporaneously, India had a similar effect on European culture with Orientalism, \"Hindoo style\" architecture, reception of Buddhism in the West and similar). According to Paul Hacker, \"the ethcial values of Neo-Hinduism stem from Western philosophy and Christianity, although they are expressed in Hindu terms.\"\n\nThese reform movements are summarised under Hindu revivalism and continue into the present.\n\nAn important development during the British colonial period was the influence Hindu traditions began to form on Western thought and new religious movements. An early champion of Indian-inspired thought in the West was Arthur Schopenhauer who in the 1850s advocated ethics based on an \"Aryan-Vedic theme of spiritual self-conquest\", as opposed to the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism of the superficially this-worldly \"Jewish\" spirit. Helena Blavatsky moved to India in 1879, and her Theosophical Society, founded in New York in 1875, evolved into a peculiar mixture of Western occultism and Hindu mysticism over the last years of her life.\n\nThe sojourn of Vivekananda to the World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893 had a lasting effect. Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Mission, a Hindu missionary organisation still active today.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Western occultists influenced by Hinduism include Maximiani Portaz – an advocate of \"Aryan Paganism\" – who styled herself \"Savitri Devi\" and Jakob Wilhelm Hauer, founder of the German Faith Movement. It was in this period, and until the 1920s, that the swastika became a ubiquitous symbol of good luck in the West before its association with the Nazi Party became dominant in the 1930s.\n\nHinduism-inspired elements in Theosophy were also inherited by the spin-off movements of Ariosophy and Anthroposophy and ultimately contributed to the renewed New Age boom of the 1960s to 1980s, the term \"New Age\" itself deriving from Blavatsky's 1888 \"The Secret Doctrine\".\n\nInfluential 20th-century Hindus were Ramana Maharshi, B.K.S. Iyengar, Paramahansa Yogananda, Prabhupada (founder of ISKCON), Sri Chinmoy, Swami Rama and others who translated, reformulated and presented Hinduism's foundational texts for contemporary audiences in new iterations, raising the profiles of Yoga and Vedanta in the West and attracting followers and attention in India and abroad.\n\nAs of 2007, of an estimated 944 million Hindus, 98.5% live in South Asia. Of the remaining 1.5% or 14 million, 6 million live in Southeast Asia (mostly Indonesia), 2 million in Europe, 1.8 million in North America, 1.2 million in Southern Africa.\n\nModern Hinduism is the reflection of continuity and progressive changes that occurred in various traditions and institutions of Hinduism during the 19th and 20th centuries.\nIts main divisions are into Vaishnavism (largely influenced by Bhakti), Shaivism, Shaktism and Smartism (Advaita Vedanta).\n\nBesides these traditional denominations, movements of Hindu revivalism look to founders such as Swami Vivekananda, Swami Dayananda (Arya Samaj), Rabindranath Tagore, Ramana Maharshi, Aurobindo, Shriram Sharma Acharya, Swami Sivananda, Swami Rama Tirtha, Narayana Guru, Paramhansa Yogananda, Swami Chinmayananda, Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, Pandurang Shastri Athavale (Swadhyay Movement) and others.\n\nThe Hindutva movement advocating Hindu nationalism originated in the 1920s and has remained a strong political force in India. The major party of the religious right, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), since its foundation in 1980 has won several elections, and after a defeat in 2004 remained the leading force of opposition against the coalition government of the Congress Party. The last national general election, held in early 2014, saw a dramatic victory of BJP; it gained an absolute majority and formed the government, with Narendra Modi as Prime Minister.\n\nThe resurgence of Hinduism in Indonesia is occurring in all parts of the country. In the early seventies, the Toraja people of Sulawesi were the first to be identified under the umbrella of 'Hinduism', followed by the Karo Batak of Sumatra in 1977 and the Ngaju Dayak of Kalimantan in 1980.\n\nThe growth of Hinduism has been driven also by the famous Javanese prophesies of Sabdapalon and Jayabaya. Many recent converts to Hinduism had been members of the families of Sukarno's PNI, and now support Megawati Sukarnoputri. This return to the 'religion of Majapahit' (Hinduism) is a matter of nationalist pride.\n\nThe new Hindu communities in Java tend to be concentrated around recently built temples (\"pura\") or around archaeological temple sites (\"candi\") which are being reclaimed as places of Hindu worship. An important new Hindu temple in eastern Java is Pura Mandaragiri Sumeru Agung, located on the slope of Mt. Semeru, Java's highest mountain. Mass conversions have also occurred in the region around Pura Agung Blambangan, another new temple, built on a site with minor archaeological remnants attributed to the kingdom of Blambangan, the last Hindu polity on Java, and Pura Loka Moksa Jayabaya (in the village of Menang near Kediri).\n\nIn modern times Smarta-views have been highly influential in both the Indian and western understanding of Hinduism via Neo-Vedanta. Vivekananda was an advocate of Smarta-views, and Radhakrishnan was himself a Smarta-Brahman. According to iskcon.org,\n\nInfluential in spreading Hinduism to a western audience were Swami Vivekananda, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (Hare Krishna movement), Sri Aurobindo, Meher Baba, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (Transcendental Meditation), Jiddu Krishnamurti, Sathya Sai Baba, Mother Meera, among others.\n\nIn the 20th century, Hinduism also gained prominence as a political force and a source for national identity in India. With origins traced back to the establishment of the Hindu Mahasabha in the 1910s, the movement grew with the formulation and development of the Hindutva ideology in the following decades; the establishment of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 1925; and the entry, and later success, of RSS offshoots Jana Sangha and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in electoral politics in post-independence India. Hindu religiosity plays an important role in the nationalist movement.\n\n\nSubnotes\nPrint\n\nWeb\n\n"}
{"id": "16186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16186", "title": "Homosexuality and Judaism", "text": "Homosexuality and Judaism\n\nThe subject of homosexual behavior and Judaism dates back to the Torah. The book of Vayikra (Leviticus) is traditionally regarded as classifying sexual intercourse between males as a \"to'eivah\" (something abhorred or detested) that can be subject to capital punishment by the currently non-existent Sanhedrin under \"halakha\" (Jewish law).\n\nThe issue has been a subject of contention within modern Jewish denominations, and has led to debate and division. Traditionally, Judaism has understood homosexual male \"intercourse\" as contrary to Judaism, and this opinion is still maintained by Orthodox Judaism. On the other hand, Reconstructionist Judaism and Reform Judaism do not hold this view, and allow homosexual intercourse and same-sex marriage. Conservative Judaism's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, which until December 2006 held the same position as Orthodoxy, recently issued multiple opinions under its philosophy of pluralism, with one opinion continuing to follow the Orthodox position and another opinion substantially liberalizing its view of homosexual sex and relationships, while continuing to regard certain sexual acts as prohibited.\n\nThe traditional viewpoint is that the \"Torah\" mentions homosexuality twice in the book of Leviticus (JPS):\n\n.וְאֶת-זָכָר, לֹא תִשְׁכַּב מִשְׁכְּבֵי אִשָּׁה — תּוֹעֵבָה הִוא\n.וְאִישׁ אֲשֶׁר יִשְׁכַּב אֶת-זָכָר מִשְׁכְּבֵי אִשָּׁה — תּוֹעֵבָה עָשׂוּ שְׁנֵיהֶם. מוֹת יוּמָתוּ; דְּמֵיהֶם בָּם\nDeuteronomy 23:17 tells followers:\n\nThis has been interpreted as prohibiting the \"sons of Israel\" from serving as a homosexual temple prostitute.\n\nThe story of Ruth and Naomi in the \"Book of Ruth\" is also occasionally interpreted as the story of a lesbian couple, while the biblical description of the relationship between David and Jonathan in the \"Book of Kings\" is sometimes interpreted as male homosexual love.\n\nLike many similar commandments, the stated punishment for willful violation was the death penalty, though minors under 13 years of age were exempt from this, as from any other penalty (Sanh. 54a). However, even in Biblical times, it was very difficult to get a conviction that would lead to this prescribed punishment. The Jewish Oral Law states that capital punishment would be applicable only if two men were caught in the act of anal sex, if there were two witnesses to the act, if the men involved were warned that they committed a capital offense, and the two men — or the willing party, in case of rape — subsequently acknowledged the warning, but continued to engage in the prohibited act anyway. In fact, there is no account of capital punishment, in regards to this law, in Jewish history.\n\nRabbinic tradition understands the Torah's system of capital punishment to not be in effect for the past approximately 2,000 years, in the absence of a Sanhedrin and Temple.\n\nClassical rabbinic Jewish sources do not specifically mention that homosexual \"attraction\" is inherently sinful. However, someone who has had homosexual \"intercourse\" is considered to have violated a prohibition. If he does teshuva (repentance), i. e., he ceases his forbidden actions, regrets what he has done, apologizes to God, and makes a binding resolution never to repeat those actions, he is seen to be forgiven by God.\n\nWhy lesbianism is not explicitly prohibited in the Bible has become a matter of interpretation. Suggestions range from the idea that in ancient times, only acts in which men emitted semen were defined as sexual, to the assumption that in biblical times, sexual attraction between women did not exist, to the belief that religious rules that apply to men automatically apply to women.\n\nSexual liaisons between women are, however, viewed as forbidden by Orthodox rabbis. This view is based on a Drash interpretation of the Biblical verse, \"Do not follow the ways of Egypt, where you once lived, nor of Canaan, where I will be bringing you. Do not follow any of their customs.\" (Leviticus 18:3).\n\nThe Talmud prohibits any activity which it defines as mesolelot or tribadism (women rubbing genitals together). The main concern in the Talmud was whether women who carried out acts were eligible to marry a member of the priesthood. It was doubtful whether this activity removed their status as a virgin, or made them a harlot. Maimonides suggests that this behavior should not disqualify a woman from marrying a priest. Talmudic law limits the penalty for lesbianism to flagellation, rather than the death penalty.\n\nThe Babylonian Talmud is one of the few ancient religious texts that makes reference to same-sex marriage:\n\"'Ula said: Non-Jews [litt. Bnei Noach, the progeny of Noah] accepted upon themselves thirty mitzvot [divinely ordered laws], but they only abide by three of them: The first one is that they do not write marriage documents for male couples, the second one is that they don't sell dead [human] meat by the pound in stores, and the third one is that they respect the Torah.'\"\n\nThe Midrash Rabba states:\n\"Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Joseph [said]: \"The generation of the flood was not obliterated from the world until they wrote marriage contracts from males and beasts.\"\"\n\nThe \"Pesikta Zutrasa\" interprets the reason for the prohibition in Leviticus against (male) homosexuality in terms of homosexuality being non-procreative. Nachmanides and the author of the \"Sefer Hachinuch\" similarly follow this interpretation.\n\nThe Tosafot, the Rosh and the Ran understand the reason for the prohibition as that as a result of (male) homosexuality, a man abandons his wife to pursue a homosexual relation.\n\nWhile a variety of views regarding homosexuality as an inclination or status exist within the Orthodox Jewish community, Orthodox Judaism generally prohibits homosexual conduct. While there is some disagreement about which male homosexual acts come under core prohibitions, the majority of Orthodox Judaism puts male-male anal sex in the category of \"yehareg ve'al ya'avor\", \"die rather than transgress\", the small category of Biblically-prohibited acts (also including murder, idolatry, adultery, and incest) which an Orthodox Jew is obligated under the laws of Self-sacrifice under Jewish Law to die rather than do. Similarly, some consider lesbianism a martyrdom-demanding transgression if only based upon the principle of \"abizrayhu\" (corollary prohibitions of the more severe martyrdom-requiring prohibitions). According to the Talmud, homosexual acts are forbidden between non-Jews as well, and this is included among the sexual restrictions of the Noachide laws. The archetypal model in Judaism is marital heterosexuality with celibacy, fornication, incest, bestiality and homosexuality seen to be part of a continuous prism of wrong.\n\nIn a speech given in 1986, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, discussed \"individuals who express an inclination towards a particular form of physical relationship in which the libidinal gratification is sought with members of one's own gender\". He wrote that \"society and government must be to offer a helping hand to those who are afflicted with this problem\".\n\nRabbi Dr. Immanuel Jakobovits, in his entry \"Homosexuality\" in the \"Encyclopedia Judaica\" (Keter Publishing), describes the traditional opinion on homosexuality in this way:\n\nJewish law [...] rejects the view that homosexuality is to be regarded merely as a disease or as morally neutral... Jewish law holds that no hedonistic ethic, even if called \"love\", can justify the morality of homosexuality any more than it can legitimize adultery or incest, however genuinely such acts may be performed out of love and by mutual consent.\n\nRabbi Norman Lamm (the Chancellor, \"Rosh Yeshiva\" [\"head of the yeshiva\"], and former president of Yeshiva University, a major Modern Orthodox Jewish institution) advocated that some (although not all) homosexuals should be viewed as diseased and in need of compassion and treatment, rather than willful rebels who should be ostracized. He distinguishes between six varieties of homosexuals, including \"genuine homosexuals\" who have \"strong preferential erotic feelings for members of the same sex\", \"transitory\" and \"situational\" homosexuals who would prefer heterosexual intercourse but are denied it or seek gain in homosexuality, and heterosexuals who are merely curious.\n\nWhen Steven Greenberg, who received Orthodox rabbinic ordination, publicly announced in 1999 that he was homosexual, there was a significant response from rabbis of all denominations reported in the Jewish newspapers. Rabbi Moshe Tendler, a leading rabbi at Yeshiva University, stated, \"It is very sad that an individual who attended our yeshiva sunk to the depths of what we consider a depraved society.\"\n\nTendler said that Rabbi Greenberg's announcement is \"the exact same as if he said, 'I'm an Orthodox Rabbi, and I eat ham sandwiches on Yom Kippur.' What you are is a Reform Rabbi.\"\n\nOrthodox Israeli rabbi Ron Yosef became in 2009 the first Israeli orthodox Rabbi to come out, by appearing in Uvda (\"Fact\"), Israel's leading investigative television program, in an episode regarding conversion therapies in Israel. Yosef remains in his position as a pulpit Rabbi. Yosef testified that his Yemenite congregation didn't accept him being a homosexual very easily and it took them a while to accept it. He stated that the younger generation strengthened and supported him, while the older generation had a more difficult experience.↵Yosef received death threats in the year leading up to the 2009 Tel Aviv gay centre shooting.\n\nIn 2013, he stated he is in a relationship with a man.\n\nYosef has stated his approach to the issue of homosexuality in Judaism as follows: \"It is clear to me that lying with another man is forbidden, and our starting point is commitment to halacha and Torah. The goal is not to seek permission. But you need to give us a shoulder and support.\"\n\nIn an open letter distributed to Orthodox community leaders, the Hod organization appealed to the Orthodox community to recognize them as part of the religious society. This was sent to over 100 rabbis in 2008, and eventually was known as the \"Document of Principles\". In part, the document states:\n\nUp to 2013, 163 Orthodox rabbis from Israel and abroad have signed this statement, among them: rabbi Yuval Cherlow, rabbi Binyamin Lau, rabbi Haim Navon, rabbi Daniel Sperber, rabbi Eliezer Melamed, rabbi Shai Piron, and rabbi Yehuda Gilad.\n\nIn 2010, TorahWeb.org published a brief position statement entitled \"Torah View on Homosexuality\". It was co-authored by Rav Hershel Schachter, Rav Mordechai Willig, Rav Michael Rosensweig, and Rav Mayer Twersky. These four are all roshei yeshiva (i. e., rabbinic leaders) at the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary at Yeshiva University, the largest and most influential Modern Orthodox rabbinic program in America. In part, the statement reads:\n\nOn July 22, 2010, a \"Statement of Principles on the Place of Jews with a Homosexual Orientation in Our Community\" was released. It was written primarily by Nathaniel Helfgot, Aryeh Klapper, and Yitzchak Blau. Signatories include more than a hundred rabbis and laypeople. Some of the statement's more notable supporters are Rabbi Marc Angel, co-founder of The Rabbinic Fellowship; Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, founder of Lincoln Square Synagogue, Efrat, and Ohr Torah Stone Institutions; and Rabbi Avi Weiss, head of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, founder of Yeshivat Chovevei Torah and Yeshivat Maharat, and co-founder of The Rabbinic Fellowship.\n\nThe statement affirms that homosexual sexual activity is prohibited, saying inter alia that \"Halakhah sees heterosexual marriage as the ideal model and sole legitimate outlet for human sexual expression\"; \"Halakhic Judaism views all male and female same-sex sexual interactions as prohibited\"; and \"halakhic values proscribe individuals and communities from encouraging practices that grant religious legitimacy to gay marriage and couplehood\". The statement emphasizes the community obligation to treat its gay friends, family, and community members with compassion and respect. \n\nSome of the statement's points that diverge from other common Orthodox positions are:\n\nAn edict signed by dozens of Israeli Orthodox rabbis and published in 2016 by the Israeli Modern Orthodox rabbinic group Beit Hillel, a group which promotes inclusiveness in Orthodox Judaism, stated, in part, \"According to the Torah and halacha, the [same-sex sexual] acts are forbidden, but not the proclivities, and therefore, people with same-sex tendencies, men and women, have no invalidation in halacha or tradition. They are obligated by the commandments of the Torah, they can fulfill a [ritual] obligation on behalf of the public, and carry out all of the community functions just like any member.\" It also stated, in part, \"Just as it [is] inconceivable to mock someone for being physically, behaviorally, or mentally different, so too those with same-sex tendencies should not be mocked. On the contrary, those around them — family and community — should show special feeling for them, and apply to them the Torah commandment of 'Love thy neighbor as thyself' and to be diligent in avoiding the prohibition of insulting another.\"\n\nJONAH was a Jewish ex-gay organization that focuses on \"prevention, intervention, and healing of the underlying issues causing same-sex attractions\". In 2012, four former clients of JONAH sued the organization for fraud, claiming that it sold them therapies that were ineffective and counterproductive. Soon after in that same year, the Rabbinical Council of America (RCA), a professional association of more than 1,000 Orthodox rabbis around the world, sent an open email to its members that it no longer supported reparative therapy generally, or JONAH specifically. In 2015, a New Jersey jury found JONAH guilty of consumer fraud for promising to be able to change its clients' sexual urges and determined its commercial practices to be unconscionable. As part of the sentence, JONAH was required to cease all operations, but continues to operate under the name JIFGA as of 2018.\n\nUK Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks wrote the foreword to Rabbi Chaim Rapoport's book \"Judaism and Homosexuality: An Authentic Orthodox View\". In the foreword, Rabbi Sacks has written: \"Compassion, sympathy, empathy, understanding - these are essential elements of Judaism. They are what homosexual Jews who care about Judaism need from us today.\"\n\nModern Orthodox leader Rabbi Aharon Lichtenstein is reported to have said that the intensity of Orthodox community's condemnation of homosexuality goes beyond what its status as a religious transgression warrants, and that he feels toward homosexual people \"criticism, disapproval, but tempered with an element of sympathy\".\n\nIn both the United States and in Israel several groups have sprung up in the last few years that seek to support those who identify as both Orthodox and homosexual; support Orthodox parents of LGBT children; and promote understanding of homosexuality within Orthodox communities and among Orthodox rabbis. These include an umbrella organization called Eshel, the Gay and Lesbian Yeshiva Day School Alumni Association, the women's group OrthoDykes, the youth group JQYouth, the American-Israeli group headquartered in Jerusalem Bat Kol and the Israeli group Hod (\"Majesty\"). In 2012, Hod held an advertising campaign against conversion therapies and for self-acceptance of the religious homosexual community in Israel. Online blogs and support groups have enabled many to find other Orthodox LGBT people with whom to share the conflict between Orthodox religious and social norms and LGBT self-identification.\n\nOrthodox rabbis Shmuley Boteach and Zev Farber have questioned the opposition of orthodox groups to government recognition of same-sex civil marriages, arguing that although Judaism does not condone homosexuality, governments should not enforce any particular religion's view of marriage, and that conferring civil benefits to committed homosexual couples should be viewed as promoting family values. Orthodox Rabbi Shmuly Yanklowitz declared that the Jewish values of justice, equality, and dignity lead him to support the cause of gay rights and advocate for same-sex civil marriage.\n\nIn November 2016, dozens of LGBT activists protested in Jerusalem against comments reportedly made by the city's chief rabbi Rabbi Shlomo Amar, who reportedly told an Israeli newspaper that gay people were an \"abomination\", and homosexuality a \"cult\".\n\nIn 2017, the Senior Rabbi of the Spanish & Portuguese Sephardi Community Joseph Dweck gave a class describing \"the entire revolution of feminism and even homosexuality in our society ... is a fantastic development for humanity\". These words were condemned by Rabbi Aaron Bassous as \"false and misguided ... corrupt from beginning to end\". This affair caused Dweck to step down from the Sephardic Beth Din but not as a communal leader.\n\nAs a matter of both Jewish law and institutional policy, Conservative (\"Masorti\") Judaism has wrestled with homosexuality issues since the 1980s.\n\nConservative Jewish writer Herschell Matt initially argued that homosexuals may be excused because Judaism does recognise 'constraint' as a valid excuse to disobey the law. However, Matt later shifted to outright support for homosexuality, viewing it as part of the natural order. Conservative Rabbi Robert Kirshchner states that Jews have historically adapted their laws to new circumstances, indicating accommodation for homosexuality.\n\nIn Conservative Judaism, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards (CJLS) of the Rabbinical Assembly makes the movement's decisions concerning Jewish law. In 1992, the CJLS action affirmed its traditional prohibition on homosexual conduct, blessing same-sex unions, and ordaining openly gay/lesbian/bisexual clergy. However, these prohibitions grew increasingly controversial within the Conservative movement.\n\nIn 2006, the CJLS shifted its position and paved the way for significant changes regarding the Conservative movement's policies toward homosexuality. On December 6, 2006, The CJLS adopted three distinct responsa reflecting very different approaches to the subject. One responsum substantially liberalized Conservative Judaism's approach including lifting most (but not all) classical prohibitions on homosexual conduct and permitted the blessing of homosexual unions and the ordination of openly gay/lesbian/bisexual clergy. Two others completely retained traditional prohibitions. Under the rules of the Conservative movement, the adoption of multiple opinions permits individual Conservative rabbis, congregations, and rabbinical schools to select which opinion to accept, and hence to choose individually whether to maintain a traditional prohibition on homosexual conduct, or to permit openly gay/lesbian/bisexual unions and clergy.\n\nThe liberalizing responsum, adopted as a majority opinion by 13 of 25 votes, was authored by Rabbis Elliot N. Dorff, Daniel Nevins, and Avram Reisner. It lifted most restrictions on homosexual conduct and opened the way to the ordination of openly gay/lesbian/bisexual rabbis and cantors and acceptance of homosexual unions, but stopped short of religiously recognizing same-sex marriage. The responsum invoked the Talmudic principle of \"kavod habriyot\", which the authors translated as \"human dignity\", as authority for this approach. The responsum maintained a prohibition on male-male anal sex, which it described as the sole Biblically prohibited homosexual act. This act remains a \"yehareg ve'al ya'avor\" (\"die rather than transgress\" offense) under the decision.\n\nTwo traditionalist responsa were adopted. A responsum by Rabbi Joel Roth, adopted as a majority opinion by 13 votes, reaffirmed a general complete prohibition on homosexual conduct. A second responsum by Rabbi Leonard Levy, adopted as a minority opinion by 6 votes, delineated ways in which to ensure that gays and lesbians would be accorded human dignity and a respected place in Conservative communities and institutions while maintaining the authority of the traditional prohibitions against same-sex sexual activity.\n\nThe Committee rejected a fourth paper by Gordon Tucker which would have lifted all restrictions on homosexual sexual practices.\n\nThe consequences of the decision have been mixed. On the one hand, four members of the Committee - Rabbis Joel Roth, Leonard Levy, Mayer Rabinowitz, and Joseph Prouser - resigned from the CJLS following adoption of the change. On the other hand, the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies of the University of Judaism (now the American Jewish University) in Los Angeles had previously stated that it will immediately begin admitting gay/lesbian/bisexual students as soon as the law committee passes a policy that sanctions such ordination. On March 26, 2007, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York followed suit and began accepting openly gay/lesbian/bisexual candidates for admission for their Rabbinical program.\n\nIn June 2012, the American branch of Conservative Judaism formally approved same-sex marriage ceremonies in a 13–0 vote.\n\nMeanwhile, Masorti synagogues in Europe and Israel, which have historically been somewhat more traditional than the American movement, continue to maintain a complete ban on homosexual and bisexual conduct, clergy, and unions. As such, most Conservative rabbis outside the United States are exercising their authority as local rabbinic authorities (\"mara d'atra\") to reject the more liberal responsa. The head of the Israeli Masorti movement's Vaad Halakha (equivalent to the CJLS), Rabbi David Golinkin, wrote the CJLS protesting its reconsideration of the traditional ban on homosexual conduct. The Masorti movements in Argentina, Hungary, and the United Kingdom have indicated that they will not admit or ordain openly gay/lesbian/bisexual rabbinical students. The Masorti Movement's Israeli seminar also rejected a change in its view of the status of homosexual conduct, stating that, \"Jewish law has traditionally prohibited homosexuality\".\n\nRabbi Bradley Artson, Dean of the Rabbinic School at American Jewish University, claims to have studied every reference he could find to homosexual activity mentioned in ancient Greek and Latin writers. Every citation he found described an encounter between males where one party, the master, physically abused another, the slave. Rabbi Artson could not find a single example where one partner was not subservient to the other. \"Homosexual relationships today\", Rabbi Artson says, \"should not be compared to the ancient world. I know too many homosexual individuals, including close friends and relatives, who are committed to one another in loving long-term monogamous relationships. I know too many same-sex couples that are loving parents raising good descent ethical children. Who's to say their family relationships are less sanctified in the eyes of God than mine is with my wife and our children?\"\n\nThe Reform Judaism movement, the largest branch of Judaism in North America, has rejected the traditional view of Jewish Law on homosexuality and bisexuality. As such, they do not prohibit ordination of openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual people as rabbis and cantors. They view Levitical laws as sometimes seen to be referring to prostitution, making it a stand against Jews adopting the idolatrous fertility cults and practices of the neighbouring Canaanite nations, rather than a blanket condemnation of same-sex intercourse, homosexuality, or bisexuality. Reform authorities consider that, in light of what is seen as current scientific evidence about the nature of homosexuality and bisexuality as inborn sexual orientations, a new interpretation of the law is required.\n\nIn 1972, Beth Chayim Chadashim, the world's first explicitly-gay-and-lesbian-centered synagogue recognized by the Reform Jewish community, was established in West Los Angeles, resulting in a slew of non-Orthodox congregations being established along similar lines. Beth Chayim Chadashim now focuses on the entire LGBT community, rather than just gays and lesbians.\n\nIn 1977, the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR), which is the Union for Reform Judaism's principal body, adopted a resolution calling for legislation decriminalizing homosexual acts between consenting adults, and calling for an end to discrimination against gays and lesbians. The resolution called on Reform Jewish organizations to develop programs to implement this stand.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the primary seminary of the Reform movement, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, changed its admission requirements to allow openly gay and lesbian people to join the student body.\n\nIn 1990, the Union for Reform Judaism announced a national policy declaring lesbian and gay Jews to be full and equal members of the religious community. Also in 1990, the CCAR officially endorsed a report of their own Ad Hoc Committee on Homosexuality and the Rabbinate. This position paper urged that \"all rabbis, regardless of sexual orientation, be accorded the opportunity to fulfill the sacred vocation that they have chosen\". The committee endorsed the view that \"all Jews are religiously equal, regardless of their sexual orientation\".\n\nIn 1995, Reform Rabbi Margaret Wenig's essay \"Truly Welcoming Lesbian and Gay Jews\" was published in \"The Jewish Condition: Essays on Contemporary Judaism Honoring [Reform] Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler\"; it was the first published argument to the Jewish community on behalf of civil marriage for gay couples.\n\nIn 1996, the CCAR passed a resolution approving same-sex civil marriage. However, this same resolution made a distinction between civil marriages and religious marriages; this resolution thus stated:\n\nIn 1998, an ad hoc CCAR committee on Human Sexuality issued its majority report (11 to 1, 1 abstention) which stated that the holiness within a Jewish marriage \"may be present in committed same gender relationships between two Jews and that these relationships can serve as the foundation of stable Jewish families, thus adding strength to the Jewish community\". The report called for the CCAR to support rabbis in officiating at same-sex marriages. Also in 1998, the Responsa Committee of the CCAR issued a lengthy \"teshuvah\" (rabbinical opinion) that offered detailed argumentation in support of both sides of the question whether a rabbi may officiate at a commitment ceremony for a same-sex couple.\n\nIn March 2000, the CCAR issued a new resolution stating that, \"We do hereby resolve that the relationship of a Jewish, same gender couple is worthy of affirmation through appropriate Jewish ritual, and further resolve, that we recognize the diversity of opinions within our ranks on this issue. We support the decision of those who choose to officiate at rituals of union for same-sex couples, and we support the decision of those who do not.\"\n\nAlso in 2000, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion established the Institute for Judaism, Sexual Orientation & Gender Identity to \"educate HUC-JIR students on lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender issues to help them challenge and eliminate homophobia and heterosexism; and to learn tools to be able to transform the communities they encounter into ones that are inclusive and welcoming of LGBT Jews\". It is the first and only institute of its kind in the Jewish world.\n\nIn 2003, the Union for Reform Judaism retroactively applied its pro-rights policy on gays and lesbians to the bisexual and transgender communities, issuing a resolution titled, \"Support for the Inclusion and Acceptance of the Transgender and Bisexual Communities\".\n\nAlso in 2003, Women of Reform Judaism issued a statement describing their support for human and civil rights and the struggles of the bisexual and transgender communities, and saying, \"Women of Reform Judaism accordingly: Calls for civil rights protections from all forms of discrimination against bisexual and transgender individuals; Urges that such legislation allows transgender individuals to be seen under the law as the gender by which they identify; and\nCalls upon sisterhoods to hold informative programs about the transgender and bisexual communities.\"\n\nIn 2009, \"Siddur Sha'ar Zahav\", the first complete prayer book to address the lives and needs of LGBTQ as well as straight Jews, was published. Publisher: J Levine Judaica & Sha'ar Zahav (2009); ; . Sha'ar Zahav is a progressive Reform synagogue in San Francisco.\n\nIn 2014, the CCAR joined a lawsuit challenging North Carolina's ban on same-sex marriage, which is America's first faith-based challenge to same-sex marriage bans.\n\nIn 2015, Rabbi Denise Eger became the first openly gay president of the CCAR.\n\nAlso in 2015, the High Holy Days Reform Jewish prayer book Mishkan HaNefesh was released; it is intended as a companion to Mishkan T'filah. Mishkan HaNefesh can be translated as \"sanctuary of the soul\". It replaces a line from the Reform movement's earlier prayerbook, \"Gates of Repentance\", that mentioned the joy of a bride and groom specifically, with the line \"rejoicing with couples under the chuppah [wedding canopy]\", and adds a third, non-gendered option to the way worshippers are called to the Torah, offering \"mibeit\", Hebrew for \"from the house of\", in addition to the traditional \"son of\" or \"daughter of\".\n\nThe Reconstructionist movement sees homosexuality and bisexuality as normal expressions of sexuality and welcomes gays, bisexuals, and lesbians into Reconstructionist communities to participate fully in every aspect of community life. Since 1985, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College has admitted openly gay, bisexual, and lesbian candidates to their rabbinical and cantorial programs. In 1993, a movement Commission issued: \"Homosexuality and Judaism: The Reconstructionist Position\". The Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association (RRA) encourages its members to officiate at same-sex marriages/commitment ceremonies, though the RRA does not require its members to officiate at them. In 2007, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association elected as president Rabbi Toba Spitzer, the first openly LGBT person chosen to head a rabbinical association in the United States. In 2013, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association elected as president Rabbi Jason Klein, the first openly gay man chosen to head a national rabbinical association of one of the major Jewish denominations in the United States. Also in 2013, Rabbi Deborah Waxman was elected as the president of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College. As the President, she is believed to be the first woman and first lesbian to lead a Jewish congregational union, and the first female rabbi and first lesbian to lead a Jewish seminary; the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College is both a congregational union and a seminary.\n\nJewish Renewal is a recent movement in Judaism which endeavors to reinvigorate modern Judaism with Kabbalistic, Hasidic, musical and meditative practices; it describes itself as \"a worldwide, transdenominational movement grounded in Judaism's prophetic and mystical traditions\". The Jewish Renewal movement ordains people of all sexual orientations as rabbis and cantors. In 2005, Eli Cohen became the first openly gay rabbi ordained by the Jewish Renewal Movement, followed by Chaya Gusfield and Rabbi Lori Klein in 2006, who became the two first openly lesbian rabbis ordained by the Jewish Renewal movement. In 2007, Jalda Rebling, born in Amsterdam and now living in Germany, became the first openly lesbian cantor ordained by the Jewish Renewal movement. In 2011, the bisexual rights activist Debra Kolodny was ordained as a rabbi by the Jewish Renewal movement and hired as the rabbi for congregation P'nai Or of Portland. The Statement of Principles of ALEPH: Alliance for Jewish Renewal (and OHALAH and the Rabbinic Pastors Association) states in part, \"We welcome and recognize the sanctity of every individual regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. We recognize respectful and mutual expressions of adult human sexuality as potentially sacred expressions of love, and therefore, we strive to welcome a variety of constellations of intimate relationships and family forms including gay, lesbian, and heterosexual relationships as well as people choosing to be single.\" \n\nHumanistic Judaism is a movement in Judaism that offers a non-theistic alternative in contemporary Jewish life. In 2004, the Society for Humanistic Judaism issued a resolution supporting \"the legal recognition of marriage and divorce between adults of the same sex\", and affirming \"the value of marriage between any two committed adults with the sense of obligations, responsibilities, and consequences thereof\". In 2010 they pledged to speak out against homophobic bullying. The Association of Humanistic Rabbis has also issued a pro-LGBT statement titled \"In Support of Diverse Sexualities and Gender Identities\". It was adopted in 2003 and issued in 2004.\n\nJewish LGBT rights advocates and sympathetic clergy have created various institutions within Jewish life to accommodate gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender parishioners. Beth Chayim Chadashim, established in 1972 in West Los Angeles, was the world's first explicitly-gay-and-lesbian-centered synagogue recognized by the Reform Jewish community, resulting in a slew of non-Orthodox congregations being established along similar lines, including Congregation Beit Simchat Torah in New York City, Bet Mishpachah in Washington, D. C., and Congregation Or Chadash in Chicago. Beth Chayim Chadashim now focuses on the entire LGBT community, rather than just gays and lesbians.\n\nLGBT-inclusive services and ceremonies specific to Jewish religious culture have also been created, ranging from LGBT-affirmative haggadot for Passover to a \"Stonewall Shabbat Seder\".\n\nIn October 2012 Rainbow Jews, an oral history project showcasing the lives of Jewish bisexual, lesbian, gay, and transgender people in the United Kingdom from the 1950s until the present, was launched. It is the United Kingdom's first archive of Jewish bisexual, lesbian, gay, and transgender history.\n\nThe ONE National Gay and Lesbian Archives has, among other things, the Twice Blessed Collection, circa 1966-2000; this collection \"consists of materials documenting the Jewish lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender experience, circa 1966-2000, collected by the Jewish Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Archives, founded and operated by Johnny Abush\". \n\nRecent research by the sociocultural psychologist, Chana Etengoff, has highlighted the therapeutic benefits of LGBTQ petitions to religious leaders, including meaning-making, social action, agency and empowerment.\n\n\n\n\nResearch References:\n\n"}

It was founded in 1986.\n\nThe establishment of the Islamic world Academy of Sciences (IAS) was initially proposed by the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), now the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation) Standing Committee on Scientific and Technological Co-operation (COMSTECH), and approved by the Fourth Islamic Summit held in Casablanca in 1984.\n\nUpon the invitation of Jordan, the Founding Conference of the Academy was held in Amman (Jordan) in October 1986, under the patronage of HRH Prince Al-Hassan, who accepted the patronage of the Academy together with HE the President of Pakistan.\nOperating from its Amman Secretariat, the Academy aims to continue the work it had started in 1986, assisting the decision-makers and scientists and technologists of the OIC-Member Countries and helping them achieve an advanced level of development for their countries.\n\nThe main objectives of the IAS are to:\n\n\nThe underlying objective of the programme of the Islamic World Academy of Sciences is to establish a framework for the development of science and technology in the Islamic World.\n\nThe programme, by facilitating interaction among scientists, and promoting the exchange of views and ideas on science and technology issues in particular, can catalyse the overall process of socio-economic development in Islamic countries.\n\nSince its inception in 1986, the IAS has been implementing programmes that address serious contemporary issues facing the Islamic World, with the aim of formulating remedial policies that can be adopted by OIC and developing countries in their quest to achieve their development objectives.\n\nOperating on a year to year basis, the IAS has organised several international conferences, published a series of Conference Proceedings, Newsletters and some monographs, and has also established a quality Science Journal which is of an international standard.\n\nMoreover, the IAS has established numerous contacts with national and international non-governmental organisations, as well as governments throughout the World.\n\nSince its establishment, the IAS has been implementing regular and ad hoc activities that are in line with its programme. The objective of all such activities has been to advance the science and technology sector in OIC and developing countries. This, the IAS believes, can generate increased interest in this sector, enabling countries to reap the fruits of its outputs in the areas of education, health, industry, and human welfare in general.\n\nThe IAS has built itself into an action-oriented institution of OIC-Member countries utilising most of its limited resources for activities that accelerate the pace of development of OIC-Member countries.\n\nA primary function of the Academy is to act as a Pan-Islamic affiliating body to the relevant international organisations. Through this, Muslim scholars can have a channel of communication, through the Academy, with such international agencies as the UNESCO, the World Bank, etc.\nAt the level of the OIC, examples of the co-operation that exists between the Academy and other institutions are outlined\n\nThe Islamic World Academy of Sciences and COMSTECH have had solid relations, since COMSTECH helped to create the Academy in 1986, in compliance with the OIC Summit recommendations.\n\nThe IDB has been helping to finance Academy conferences since 1990. It has often delegated its own specialists to present papers describing its activities within the scope of the theme of the annual IAS Conference.\n\nThe IAS, during March 2009, participated in the launch of the UNESCO International Science, Technology and Innovation Centre for South-South Cooperation (ISTIC) in Kuala Lumpur and has implemented a number of programmes with this newly founded centre since.\n\nFurthermore, the IAS - through Prof. Adnan Badran FIAS and Moneef Zou’bi, DG-IAS - was commissioned to author the ‘Arab States Chapter’ of the UNESCO Science Report 2010, a task that has been successfully accomplished.\n\nThe IAS also has been invited through Dr Moneef Zou’bi to author the ‘Arab States Chapter’ of the UNESCO Science Report for 2015.\n\nIn its effort to establish scientific and academic relations with similar Islamic organisations, the Academy signed a co-operation agreement with the Islamic Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (ISESCO), in 1989.\n\nThe Academy signed a co-operation agreement with The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) some years ago. That was a first step towards enhancing co-operation between these two international academies, which have been in close liaison recently on their scientific activities. The IAS often joins TWAS at its scientific meetings and both academies exchange information in the context of G77, as well as TWNSO meetings, especially as the IAS has been a member of the Third World Network of Scientific Organisation (TWNSO) for a number of years.\n\nIn order to interact fully with 100 or so national and international academies of sciences the world over, the IAS joined the Inter-Academy Partnership, which is a global network of science academies. The IAS was elected to join the IAP at latter's General Assembly Meeting which was held in Alexandria, Egypt, during December 2006.\n\nThe IAS has signed Memoranda of Understanding with the Kazakhstan, the Azerbaijan, and the Uzbekistan Academies of Sciences. These agreements lay the foundation for long-term co-operative relationships between OIC institutions and these republics and their scientific infrastructure.\n\nThe IAS has been actively supporting the Palestine Academy of Science and Technology (PALAST) through facilitating the participation of PALAST officials in the various scientific activities in the Middle East, as well as providing help and advice to this sister academy on a regular bases.\n\nThe Bangladesh Academy of Sciences played an important part in organising the 19th IAS conference which was held in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and a number of the BAS Fellows took part in the conference.\n\nThe Inter Academy Medical Panel on Global Health Issues (IAMP) is an association created by the world’s academies of medicine and academies of sciences or engineering having members from the health sciences for the purpose of working together through bilateral, regional and worldwide. The IAS was elected to join the IAMP at latter's General Assembly Meeting which was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, during March 2010.\n\nDuring September 2011, the IAS hosted a meeting of the executive council of the IUA at IAS Headquarters in Amman, where a number of IUA matters as well as a number of possible joint initiatives between the IAS and IUA were discussed.\n\nDuring January 2014, the IAS co-organised an international conference in Erlangen (Germany) under the title The Impact of Arabic Sources on Divination and the Practical Sciences in Europe and Asia in association with the International Union of Academies (IUA).\n\nThe IAS will co-organise a second IUA International Conference on the “Impact of Arab Sciences in Europe and Asia from the Middle Ages to the Modern Period,” to be held in Amman (Jordan), during April 2017.\n\nThe InterAction Council was established in 1983 as an independent international organization to mobilize the experience, energy and international contacts of a group of statesmen who have held the highest office in their own countries.\n\nIn May 2013, IAS President presented a keynote address at the 31st Annual Plenary Meeting of the Interaction Council, 9–11 May 2013, Manama, Bahrain, under the title Uprisings in the Arab World: The Reality beyond the Failure of Politics and Policies.\n\nOn 20 October 2014, the Council launched its latest publication, “Water, Energy, and the Arab Awakening.” This book is the third in the Council’s “Global Agenda” series and the second book the Council has published in partnership with the United Nations University Institute of Water, Environment and Health (UNU-INWEH).\n\n\n\nSource: Islamic World Academy of Sciences (IAS)\n\nThe Medical Journal of the Islamic World Academy of Sciences, which first appeared in August 1988, is a quality publication comparable to international scientific journals. The Journal has established itself as a major scientific publication in the Islamic world and has been granted an ISS number (ISSN 1016-3360). It is a forum for scientists and technologists in developing countries through which they can get their research work published.\n\nThe Journal, which is published in Turkey and distributed internationally, was launched with the help of the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences (KFAS), and has since, received some grants from the Academy Secretariat and COMSTECH.\n\nThe IAS, through its Secretariat, regularly publishes the Newsletter of the Islamic World Academy of Sciences.\n\nThis widely distributed publication aims to publicise the various activities the IAS undertakes, and also to put across the Academy’s programmes. It also often contains news about the Academy, its Fellows and staff.\n\nThe Newsletter, as well as regularly profiling some Academy Fellows, frequently contains specialised and guest articles on contemporary scientific and technical topics including such matters as the S&T potential of OIC-member countries and institutions.\n\nUpon the request of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Standing Committee on Scientific and Technological Co-operation (COMSTECH), and under its sponsorship, the Academy published for over 6 years (1991 – 1996) the Arabic version of COMSTECH’s Islamic Thought and Scientific Creativity, the high quality quarterly publication.\n\nA total of twenty issues of the Arabic version were published and distributed. This was done, as a joint activity of the Academy and the Amman-based Royal Academy for Islamic Civilisation Research, Al Albait Foundation, Amman, Jordan.\n\nThe structure of the IAS consists of a General Assembly, Council, Headquarters, Fellows, Deceased Fellows and Ibrahim Award.\n\nThe Academy itself is governed by the General Assembly in which all founding and elected Fellows are member. The number of Academy Fellows was 110 on 1 December 2016. They represent more than 40 countries and many scientific disciplines. The Fellows of the Academy are eminent figures, each in his/her field has achieved a great deal and has contributed significantly both to his/her country’s development and the global arena. Since its establishment in 1986, the General Assembly has convened annually and the major issues discussed at each of these gatherings are the planning and accomplishing of future Academy activities.\n\nThe Council is responsible for the management and direction of the Academy and consists of eleven executive members which are elected by the General Assembly for a four-year term of office, and which is subject to its regulation and supervision.\n\nCouncil of the Islamic World Academy of Sciences (2017–2021)\n\nBased in Amman, the capital of Jordan, the academy secretariat is the executive arm of the IAS and its primary function is to maintain the institutional establishment of the IAS and implement its plan of action within the guidelines set by the Council and General Assembly. The secretariat receives an annual maintenance grant and is provided with the diplomatic immunities by the Jordanian government.\n\nSource: Islamic World Academy of Sciences (IAS)\n\n\nSource: Islamic World Academy of Sciences (IAS)\n\n\nSource: Islamic World Academy of Sciences (IAS)\n\n"}

{"id": "4461978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4461978", "title": "Jesus Christians", "text": "Jesus Christians\n\nThe Jesus Christians were a small Christian millennialist group which practiced communal living, voluntary work, activism and distributed Christian comics and books written by the founder, David Mckay. They were founded in Australia in the early 80's by Dave and Cherry Mckay and have had a three decade long history of controversy documented extensively by the media. Remaining small in number the group has operated under many different names and since 2010 the \"End Time Survivors\" movement has emerged which continues to be led by Dave and Cherry Mckay.\n\nThe history and activities of the Jesus Christians over the years have been extensively documented by both the group and the mainstream media, attracting both positive and negative attention. Some older newspaper articles were reproduced on the group's website, and where these are used below this is noted in the references.\n\nThe group was started in Melbourne, Australia, by Dave and Cherry McKay when Neville Williams moved in with the Mckay family in early 1981. David Mckay was a former member of the Children of God and left following disagreements over practices such as flirty fishing. The Jesus Christians operated under several different names, including Christians; The Medowie Christian Volunteers; Australian Christian Volunteers, and Voices in the Wilderness. The name 'Jesus Christians' was selected in 1996. (\"A Change of Name\", August, 1996)\n\nIn 1983 Australian media followed members of the community who offered to do free work for one day for any\nfamily or business which requested their assistance.\n\nIn 1984 group member Boyd Ellery was sentenced to three months prison in Sydney for burning an Australian dollar note in a statement about trusting God and not money. The protest was broadcast on national television by Mike Willisee.\n\nIn January 1985 the group glued Australian $2 notes to pavements to spell out messages against greed and money outside post offices around Victoria and New South Wales.\n\nChristian messages also appeared written on a claimed AUS$100,000 worth of $2 notes in Sydney. The group claimed that as a result the federal police confiscated their mail until the Council for Civil Liberties intervened.\n\nIn May and June 1985, six of the youngest members of the community, 12 -year-old Rachel Sukamaran, Malcolm Wrest, Roland Gianstefani, Robin Dunn and Gary McKay, headed by 15-year-old Christine McKay, walked 1,000 miles across the Nullarbor Desert in the interior of Australia without taking any money, provisions or support vehicle for their journey, prompting controversy and media interest.\n\nIn 1990, members of the group travelled to the United States to hand out 290,000 booklets prophesying America's destruction. They wore T-shirts with an upside down American flag (as a symbol of distress) and the caption \"Pride Goeth Before a Fall\" \n\nIn 1994, Rob & Christine Dunn, Gary, Dave & Cherry McKay, Ross Parry, Rachel Sukamaran, Malcolm Wrest, Craig, Kevin, Rols, Sue, Sinni, Liz, Boyd, Chris, Roshini, and Sheri were among Jesus Christian members who voluntarily cleaned sewers and toilets in India. After one protest where members stood in the sewer for a week to draw attention to the filth that spread disease, Craig Hendry contracted Typhoid.\n\nIn 1995 the Jesus Christians converted a section of open sewer in Chennai into a children's playground. The real estate created by covering the sewer was estimated to be worth AUD $950,000. After one year the project was handed over to Indian charities to run, however the Indian government eventually demolished the site because it had been built on government land without permission.\n\nIn April 1997 and 1998 several Jesus Christians were arrested at the Royal Easter Show in Sydney dressed as babies in over-sized nappies while distributing \"The Baby Books\", highlighting how Jesus said his followers need to become like children to enter into God's Kingdom. The introduction of the books stated \"We are children of God\" which led to confusion about the group being the same as the Children of God group started by David Berg of the same name. This continuing confusion can be seen in a 2013 article which uses a photograph of the \"Nappy Chappies\" labelled as the Children of God.\n\nIn 1998 there was a split in the community. Craig and Yesamma Hendry and their family, Kevin and Elisabeth McKay, Boyd and Sheri Ellery and their family, Darren and Donna Cooke, Ray Sippel, Josh and Tim left the community in Australia. Boyd wrote to the remaining community \"The Spirit you are following is not Christ's. We will have no part of your hierarchies and fleshly importance.\" The remaining community were \"encouraged to avoid private correspondence or discussions with them...\" '\n\nIn July 1999, 19-year-old Kyri Sheridan joined the Jesus Christians in the UK. His mother reported him missing to the Guildford Police in Surrey. Kyri (accompanied by fellow Jesus Christian Francisco Gonzales) signed in at the Guildford police station to state that he was not actually \"missing\". The police confirmed Kyri was happy and making his own decision to be with the Jesus Christians. When his mother held Kyri to stop him from leaving she was pinned down, handcuffed and arrested by the police.\n\nOn 14 July 2000 the group was splashed across the front page of the British tabloid Daily Express, which declared that members Susan and Roland Gianstefani had kidnapped a 16-year-old boy, Bobby Kelly. Bobby had picked up a Jesus Christians cartoon book called \"The Liberator\" in Romford High Street, Essex, near the end of June 2000, and gone home to tell his grandmother about the Christian man he met. Bobby went out again that afternoon and returned to tell his grandmother he wanted to join the Jesus Christians. A few days later \"an Australian couple with their young son, a German and two English men\" from the group visited and met Bobby's grandmother. In the first two weeks of July while Bobby was with the group, before the scandal had hit the headlines, Bobby visited his youth worker from St. Peters Anglican Church in Harold Wood. He had previously attended that church. The youth worker, David Whitehouse, told the press a week later, \"The group has a veneer of respectability, but there is something very disturbing about them. When I saw Bobby a week ago, he was with three of them, and he seemed very scared, which was unlike him.\n\nSometime before July 14, anti-cult expert, Graham Baldwin, was reportedly contacted by \"someone close to the family who suspected that something was wrong, and did something to try to save him.\" It has not been established that David Whitehouse was the person who contacted him. Baldwin worked for a charity, Catalyst, which helps families of people caught up in groups with whom the family disagrees. A solicitor who \"specialises in cases against cults\" was hired after legal aid was acquired and the solicitor succeeded in getting an emergency High Court action to try to \"rescue the schoolboy\". The front page newspaper report in \"The Express\" was published two weeks after Bobby first met the Jesus Christians with the story that Bobby had \"disappeared\" after he met the group: \"Within hours Bobby had forsaken his possessions and moved in with the group. The police were called and the airports and docks were put on the highest alert.\" After \"The Express\" broke the story, instead of handing the boy over to the police, the Jesus Christians with Bobby \"in tow\" panicked went \"on the run\". The UK Jesus Christians became fugitives for two weeks.\n\nWhen the Jesus Christians could not be found in the nationwide search, and when Bobby started doing telephone interviews with the media declaring that he had not been kidnapped, an emergency court ruling was made banning the broadcast of interviews with Bobby or the group, which the BBC successfully challenged. Bobby was eventually located hiding out with two Jesus Christian men, including Reinhard Zeuner, in a Hampshire forest, and placed in a foster home. No members of the Jesus Christians were charged with kidnapping but a charge of contempt of court (for failing to answer questions from the High Court judge) resulted in six-month sentences for Susan and Roland Gianstefani. The solicitor for the Gianstefani's told the court that the Gianstefani's feared Bobby might be subjected to the deprogramming of his religious beliefs if they had revealed his whereabouts. Minutes before the Gianstefanis were due to be sentenced, Bobby, who was kept in a separate room at the High Court, sent a note to the judge through the representative of the Official Solicitor saying that the Gianstefani's had acted nobly and they feared he (Bobby) might be subjected to the deprogramming of his religious beliefs if they had revealed his whereabouts. Bobby said: \"I hope they don't get into trouble. They were willing to go to prison for me.\" The Gianstefanis' sentences were suspended after Bobby had pleaded with the judge in their defence.\n\nOver half of the Jesus Christian members donated a kidney to people they did not know prior to agreeing to donate, thus earning them the nickname 'the kidney cult'.\n\nIn January 2003, Jon Ronson's documentary called \"Kidneys for Jesus\" aired on Channel 4 in the UK. After an invitation from Dave McKay, Jon Ronson followed the group over a year as they attempted to donate their kidneys to strangers in the UK and the US. The successful donations of members Casey Crouch, Robin Dunn and Susan Gianstefani are featured. The film also documents the tension that arose between Ronson and McKay during filming: McKay became increasingly concerned that Ronson was portraying the Jesus Christians in a poor light and Ronson was concerned about McKay's ideas to try to manipulate a media storm around the donations as well as his role in the decisions made by members to donate kidneys.\n\nIn 2004 the group made headlines in Australia when the leader, David Mckay, revealed that members in Australia had lied to health authorities in order to be able to donate their kidneys. David Mckay later admitted it was his teaching that if you must lie, be honest about your dishonesty.\n\nIn June 2008, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation broadcast a report on Ash Falkingham's fight for his right to donate a kidney to a stranger. The documentary covers the attempts of his parents to thwart the young Jesus Christian's intentions and his final success. Ash left the community shortly afterwards to work restoring bicycles for a charity.\n\nIn 2005 a charge of abduction was made against Roland and Susan Gianstefani in Kenya, this time by the father of a 27-year-old single mother, Betty Njoroge, who had joined the community with her 7 year old son. The woman released a video on the group's website declaring that she and her son had not been kidnapped and that her father was responsible for the case being pursued as he wanted custody of her son. Roland Gianstefani was arrested and questioned by police and held for several days without charge, until the Australian embassy insisted he be charged or else released. Roland and his wife Susan were charged and Roland was held in a remand prison in Nairobi until 600,000 Kenyan shillings bail was paid. The charges against him and Susan were dropped when Betty Njoroge appeared in court and presented an affidavit confirming she was acting of her own free will. Roland contracted tuberculosis in prison and Susan, who had earlier told the media that she and her husband would never stoop to bribery, not even to save their lives, claimed she had to resort to bribery to get basic amenities provided for Roland from the prison guards.\n\nIn October 2006 Jesus Christians in the United States, along with Dave and Cherry McKay, held a mock trial in Long Beach, California where they charged the parents and two brothers of one of their members, Joseph Johnson, with attempted murder and with aiding and abetting others in doing this. It followed an attack on one of their members, Reinhard Zeuner, in which he received a fractured spine, bleeding on the brain, broken teeth and numerous cuts to the head and face. An amateur video was made of the attack, but the police never prosecuted the case. Although the family did not attend the trial, various sentences of 5-25 lashes of the whip were carried out on volunteers from the Jesus Christians themselves, as an attempt to illustrate their understanding of the cross of Christ. \"God hates the sin, but loves the sinner\", they said, in an effort to summarize what they were doing. (\"The Trial\")\n\nOn 11 December 2007, Dave and Cherry McKay and Roland and Susan Gianstefani were interviewed on stage as part of a two-day feature on religious cults on the UK television programme \"The Jeremy Kyle Show\". The show attempted to link the Jesus Christians with such groups as Jim Jones' People's Temple, and the Children of God. Dave and Cherry and Roland and Sue were questioned by Jeremy Kyle and opponents of David McKay. At one point, due to the nature of the questioning, Dave McKay refused to reply to any more questions and McKay walked out of the interview and then returned to say \"Just let them do their thing\".\n\nIn February 2008, Roland, Susan and Daniel Gianstefani were featured on the Channel 4 program \"Wife Swap\", where freegan Susan went to live with the millionaire family of an IT consultant.\n\nIn July 2010 Jesus Christians held a mock trial in Sydney, Australia, to draw attention to the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners who were being persecuted in China. The \"court\" heard testimonies of victims, then Alf Montagu and Jayme Kronmiller submitted to 25 lashes of the whip as a form of substitutionary punishment for the former leader of the Communist Party of China, Jiang Zemin, and the Secret Police, Luo Gan, who unsurprisingly did not attend the trial.\n\nIn August 2010, long term members Roland, Susan and Daniel Gianstefani left the community after \"numerous tensions over their parenting skills\". This followed \"a number of community discussions\", according to the Jesus Christians Newsletter. Susan and Roland had been members of the group for more than twenty years.\n\nRoland and Susan Gianstefani, continue to identify as Jesus Christians. Their current ministry is now focused on anti war and human rights activism.\n\nNovember 2010: Founder, David McKay claims the group has disbanded, graduated or dispersed.\nLong Term members, Roland and Sue Gianstefani and Ross Parry claim they have been excommunicated at this time from all correspondence with other members at the behest of McKay, for objecting to changes in the dishonest manner in which the group is to operate.\nAnother member, Alan Wright, is also disfellowshipped from the group for refusing to comply with dictates from the groups leadership regarding not suing his wife for more money in a divorce settlement.\n\nSince the founder David Mckay´s announcement in 2010 of either disbandment or graduation or dispersal, there is some confusion with regard to the continuing organisation of members of Jesus Christians.\n\nRoland and Susan Gianstefani still identify as Jesus Christians UK, but have been excommunicated by the founder. Evidence that Jesus Christians appear to be operating under the name of \"End Time Survivors\" with Dave and Cherry Mckay continuing to lead the group in a more covert form has recently come to light.\n\nIn October 2017 Roland and Susan Gianstefani had a live radio interview with Bobby Kelly on a Welsh radio station where they discussed their life and the controversies they were involved in when they were a part of the community now called \"End Times Survivors\", formerly called the \"Jesus Christians\" community.\n\nOn December 7, 2017 at the annual conference of \"The Australian Association for the Study of Religion\" in Sydney, an academic paper was presented with a formal discussion about a New religious movement that was founded in Australia in the 1980s and led by Dave and Cherry McKay. The author, Geraldine Smith, described the movement as a \"Christian millennialist group\" called the \"End Time Survivors (ETS)\". \nThere is evidence that a web site and YouTube channel called \"End Time Survivors\" appeared in 2015. Several ex members of the Jesus Christians know and recognise voices and faces of Jesus Christians long term members despite minor attempts to digitally obscure their identities. Ex members, Roland and Sue Gianstefani assert that it has been a deliberate long term plan by David McKay to take the group underground and hide its identity from the public, by presenting the group or groups under different names while claiming loose associations between members living in different locations. They assert that the influence of the founder over these groups and their real identities is to be kept hidden from the public in order to avoid persecution.\n\nThe EndTime Survivors website contains many identical teachings from the Jesus Christians and promotes David McKay's books \"Survivors\", \"Armageddon for Beginners\" and Jesus Christian pamphlets such as \"Christian But Not Religious\" as well as many of the Jesus Christians articles from their website.\n\"End Time Survivors\" also appears as a you tube channel and is linked to \"Voice in the Desert\" with similar topics.\n\n\nMembers forsook all private ownership, with the option of either handing over all of their earthly possessions to the Jesus Christian community, or giving it all to charity. (\"Forsaking\nAll\", from Jesus and Money) The group teaches that all members must have equal say in how funds are to be used. (\"Power--Good or Evil\", and \"Setting Up Your Own Community\")\n\nFor many years members of the Jesus Christians distributed religious literature, much of it written by Dave McKay. In recent years, they primarily distributed copies of novels written by McKay, the main one being Survivors (novel) (), in exchange for \"a few cents to help with the cost of printing them\". In 2006 they reported that sales for this book had exceeded one million.\n\n\"Survivors\" is a response to the popular \"Left Behind series\" of novels on Bible prophecy, written by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins. In its own words, \"Survivors\" attempts to include material that was left out of the LaHaye-Jenkins series. Mckay has also published a second book in the series, entitled \"Listening\". It purports to be an \"equel\" (sic) to \"Survivors\", taking place during the same time period, although from another viewpoint. A third book, also set during the same time period as the first two, is entitled \"Destroyers\". It is available on the JC website, and was released in paperback from around Christmas 2008. The story for that mostly takes place in Kenya and is told through the perspective of someone who takes the mark of the beast.\n\nAs of 2009, the Jesus Christians had produced several videos, including a documentary expounding on various aspects of their lifestyle. They had also produced several music videos. Their latest videos included a documentary (\"The Tyrant Within\") about the implementation of RFID microchip implants and a video about the justice system, its effect on society and a radical Christian approach to mixing justice with mercy (\"Beyond Justice\").\n\n(reprinted with the new title \"Not for Everyone by Anonymous\" .\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1135086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1135086", "title": "Jonathan Sacks", "text": "Jonathan Sacks\n\nJonathan Henry Sacks, Baron Sacks (Hebrew: \"Yaakov Zvi\", יעקב צבי; born 8 March 1948) is a British Orthodox rabbi, philosopher, theologian, author and politician.\n\nHe served as the Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth from 1991 to 2013. As the spiritual head of the United Synagogue, the largest synagogue body in the UK, he was the Chief Rabbi of those Orthodox synagogues, but was not recognized as the religious authority for the Haredi Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations or for the progressive movements such as Masorti, Reform and Liberal Judaism. As Chief Rabbi, Sacks formally carried the title of Av Beit Din (head) of the London Beth Din. He is now known as the Emeritus Chief Rabbi.\n\nSince stepping down as Chief Rabbi, in addition to his international travelling and speaking engagements and prolific writing, Sacks has served as the Ingeborg and Ira Rennert Global Distinguished Professor of Judaic Thought at New York University and as the Kressel and Ephrat Family University Professor of Jewish Thought at Yeshiva University. He has also been appointed as Professor of Law, Ethics and the Bible at King's College London. He won the Templeton Prize (awarded for spiritual affirmation) in 2016.\nHe is also a Senior Fellow to the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights.\n\nBorn in Lambeth, London on 8 March 1948, Sacks commenced his formal education at St Mary's Primary School and at Christ's College, Finchley. He completed his higher education at Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge where he gained a first-class Honours Degree in Philosophy. While a student at Cambridge, Sacks traveled to New York to meet Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, to discuss a variety of issues relating to religion, faith and philosophy. Schneerson urged Sacks to seek rabbinic ordination and to enter the rabbinate.\n\nSacks subsequently continued postgraduate study at New College, Oxford and King's College London, completing a PhD which was awarded by the University of London in 1982. Sacks received his rabbinic ordination from Jews' College and London's Etz Chaim Yeshiva. \n\nSacks's first rabbinic appointment (1978–1982) was as the Rabbi for the Golders Green synagogue in London. In 1983, he became Rabbi of the prestigious Marble Arch synagogue in Central London, a position he held until 1990. Between 1984 and 1990, Sacks also served as Principal of Jews' College, the world's oldest rabbinical seminary. Dr. Sacks was inducted to serve as Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth on 1 September 1991, a position he held until 1 September 2013.\n\nSacks became a Knight Bachelor in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 2005 \"for services to the Community and to Inter-faith Relations\". He was made an Honorary Freeman of the London Borough of Barnet in September 2006. On 13 July 2009 the House of Lords Appointments Commission announced that Sacks was recommended for a life peerage with a seat in the House of Lords. He took the title \"Baron Sacks of Aldgate in the City of London\", and sits as a crossbencher. Sacks is a vegetarian.\n\nA visiting professor at several universities in Britain, the United States and Israel, Sacks holds 16 honorary degrees, including a doctorate of divinity conferred on him in September 2001 by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Carey, to mark his first ten years in office as Chief Rabbi. In recognition of his work, Sacks has won several international awards, including the Jerusalem Prize in 1995 for his contribution to diaspora Jewish life and The Ladislaus Laszt Ecumenical and Social Concern Award from Ben Gurion University in Israel in 2011.\n\nThe author of 25 books, Sacks has published commentaries on the daily Jewish prayer book siddur and has completed commentaries to the Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Pesach festival prayer-books (machzorim) . His most recent secular book—\"The Great Partnership: God, Science and the Search for Meaning\"—was published in July 2011. A number of his books have won literary awards, including the Grawemeyer Prize for Religion in 2004 for \"The Dignity of Difference\", and a National Jewish Book Award in 2000 for \"A Letter in the Scroll\". \"Covenant & Conversation: Genesis\" was also awarded a National Jewish Book Award in 2009, and most recently his commentary to the Pesach festival prayer book won the Modern Jewish Thought and Experience Dorot Foundation Award in the 2013 National Jewish Book Awards in America. His \"Covenant & Conversation\" commentaries on the weekly Torah portion are read by thousands of people in Jewish communities around the world.\n\nSacks' contributions to wider British society have also been recognised. A regular contributor to national media, frequently appearing on BBC Radio 4's \"Thought for the Day\" or writing the Credo column or opinion pieces in \"The Times\", Sacks was awarded The Sanford St Martin's Trust Personal Award for 2013 for \"his advocacy of Judaism and religion in general\". He was invited to the wedding of Prince William of Wales and Kate Middleton as a representative of the Jewish community.\n\nAt a Gala Dinner held in Central London in May 2013 to mark the completion of the Chief Rabbi's time in office, HRH The Prince of Wales called Sacks a \"light unto this nation\", \"a steadfast friend\" and \"a valued adviser\" whose \"guidance on any given issue has never failed to be of practical value and deeply grounded in the kind of wisdom that is increasingly hard to come by\".\n\nIn his Installation address upon succeeding Lord Jakobovits as Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth in September 1991, Sacks called for a Decade of Renewal which would \"revitalize British Jewry's great powers of creativity\". He said this renewal should be based on five central values: \"love of every Jew, love of learning, love of God, a profound contribution to British society and an unequivocal attachment to Israel.\" Sacks said he wanted to be \"a catalyst for creativity, to encourage leadership in others, and to let in the fresh air of initiative and imagination\". This led to a series of innovative communal projects including Jewish Continuity, a national foundation for Jewish educational programmes and outreach; the Association of Jewish Business Ethics; the Chief Rabbinate Awards for Excellence; the Chief Rabbinate Bursaries, and Community Development, a national scheme to enhance Jewish community life. The Chief Rabbi began his second decade of office with a call to 'Jewish Responsibility' and a renewed commitment to the ethical dimension of Judaism.\n\nIn addition to serving as Chief Rabbi, Sacks has held numerous appointments during his career including:\n\nSacks is also a frequent guest on both television and radio, and regularly contributes to the national press. He delivered the 1990 BBC Reith Lectures on \"The Persistence of Faith\".\n\nSacks has been awarded numerous prizes including:\n\nMuch has been written about Sacks' philosophical contribution to Judaism and beyond, most recently in three works: (1) a volume on his work entitled \"Universalizing Particularity\" that forms part of The Library of Contemporary Jewish Philosophers series, edited by Hava Tirosh-Samuelson and Aaron W. Hughes; (2) a book entitled \"Radical Responsibility\" edited by Michael J. Harris, Daniel Rynhold and Tamra Wright; and (3) a book entitled \"Morasha Kehillat Yaakov\" edited by Rabbi Michael Pollak and Dayan Shmuel Simons.\n\nIn a pamphlet written to mark the completion of his time as Chief Rabbi entitled \"A Judaism Engaged with the World\", Sacks cites three individuals who have had a profound impact on his own philosophical thinking. The first figure was the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson who \"was fully aware of the problem of the missing Jews... inventing the idea, revolutionary in its time, of Jewish outreach... [He] challenged me to lead.\" Indeed, Sacks called him \"one of the greatest Jewish leaders, not just of our time, but of all time\" The second was Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik whom Sacks described as \"the greatest Orthodox thinker of the time [who] challenged me to think.\"\n\nSacks argued that for Rav Soloveichik \"Jewish philosophy, he said, had to emerge from halakhah, Jewish law. Jewish thought and Jewish practice were not two (sic) different things but the same thing seen from different perspectives. Halakhah was a way of living a way of thinking about the world – taking abstract ideas and making them real in everyday life.\" The third figure was Rabbi Nachum Rabinovitch, a former principal of the London School of Jewish Studies.\n\nSacks called Rabinovitch \"One of the great Maimonidean scholars of our time, [who] he taught us, his students, that Torah leadership demands the highest intellectual and moral courage. He did this in the best way possible: by personal example. The following thoughts, which are his, are a small indication of what I learned from him – not least that Torah is, among other things, a refusal to give easy answers to difficult questions.\"\n\nAs a rabbi, social philosopher, proponent of interfaith dialogue and public intellectual, Tirosh-Samuelson and Hughes note that \"his [Sacks's] vision—informed as it is by the concerns of modern Orthodoxy—is paradoxically one of the most universalizing voices within contemporary Judaism. Sacks possesses a rare ability to hold in delicate balance the universal demands of the modern, multicultural world with the particularism associated with Judaism.\" This is a view supported by Rabbi Nathan Lopez Cardozo who wrote in The Jerusalem Post that Sacks' \"confidence in the power of Judaism and its infinite wisdom enabled him to enter the lion's den, taking on famous philosophers, scientists, religious thinkers and sociologists and showing them that Judaism had something to teach that they couldn't afford to miss if they wanted to be at the forefront of philosophy and science.\" Harris and Rynhold, in their introduction to \"Radical Responsibility\" argued that: \"The special contribution made by the thought of Chief Rabbi Sacks is that it not only continues the venerable Jewish philosophical tradition of maintaining traditional faith in the face of external intellectual challenges, but also moves beyond this tradition by showing how core Jewish teachings can address the dilemmas of the secular world itself. What make Lord Sacks' approach so effective is that he is able to do so without any exception of the wider world taking on Judaism's theological beliefs.\"\n\nThe framework for Sacks' philosophical approach and his interaction between the universal and the particular is not too dissimilar from those positions adopted by other leading Orthodox thinkers of recent times. The favoured phrase of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch was \"Torah im derekh eretz\", 'Torah and general culture'; for Rabbi Norman Lamm it was \"Torah u-mada\". 'Torah and Science'. For Sacks, his favoured phrase has been \"Torah vehokhmah\", 'Torah and Wisdom'. As noted in the introduction to \"Radical Responsibility\": \"\"Torah\", for Jonathan Sacks represents the particularistic, inherited teachings of Judaism, while \"hokhmah\" (wisdom) refers to the universal realm of the sciences and humanities.\" Framed in religious terms, as Sacks sets out in his book \"Future Tense\": \"Chokhmah is the truth we discover; Torah is the truth we inherit. Chokhmah is the universal language of humankind; Torah is the specific heritage of Israel. Chokhmah is what we attain by being in the image of God; Torah is what guides Jews as the people of God. Chokhmah is acquired by seeing and reasoning; Torah is received by listening and responding. Chokhmah tells us what is; Torah tells us what ought to be.\"\n\nTirosh-Samuelson and Hughes note that whilst \"Torah v'Chokhmah\" is certainly a valid overarching framework, they note that Sacks' perspective is one rooted in modern orthodoxy: \"Although he [Sacks] will try to understand various denominations of Judaism, he is always quick to point out that Orthodoxy cannot recognize the legitimacy of interpretations of Judaism that abandon fundamental beliefs of halakhic (Jewish law) authority. Judaism that departs from the truth and acceptance of the halakha is a departure from authentic Judaism and, he reasons, is tantamount to the accommodation of secularism. So, while Sacks will develop a highly inclusive account of the world's religions, there were times when he was critical of the denominations \"within\" Judaism.\"\n\nAfter the publication of his book \"The Dignity of Difference\", a group of Haredi rabbis, most notably Rabbis Yosef Shalom Elyashiv and Bezalel Rakow, accused Sacks of heresy against what they consider the traditional Orthodox viewpoint. According to them, some words seemed to imply an endorsement of pure relativism between religions, and that Judaism is not the sole true religion, e.g. \"No one creed has a monopoly on spiritual truth.\" This led him to rephrase more clearly some sentences in the book for its second edition, though he refused to recall books already in the stores.\n\nIn his \"Preface to the Second Edition\" of the book, Sacks wrote that certain passages in the book had been misconstrued: He had already explicitly criticised cultural and religious relativism in his book, and he did not deny Judaism's uniqueness. He also stressed, however, that mainstream rabbinic teachings teach that wisdom, righteousness, and the possibility of a true relationship with God are all available in non-Jewish cultures and religions as an ongoing heritage from the covenant that God made with Noah and all his descendants, so the tradition teaches that one does not need to be Jewish to know God or truth, or to attain salvation. As this diversity of covenantal bonds implies, however, traditional Jewish sources do clearly deny that any one creed has a monopoly on spiritual truth. Monopolistic and simplistic claims of universal truth he has characterized as imperialistic, pagan and Platonic, and not Jewish at all. The book received international acclaim, winning the Grawemeyer Award for Religion in 2004.\n\nA book by the British historian and journalist Meir Persoff, \"Another Way, Another Time\", has argued that \"Sacks's top priority has been staying in the good graces of the Haredi, or strictly Orthodox, faction, whose high birthrate has made it the fastest-growing component of British Jewry.\"\n\nSacks provoked considerable controversy in the Anglo-Jewish community in 1996 when he refused to attend the funeral service of the late Reform Rabbi Hugo Gryn and for a private letter he had written in Hebrew, which (in translation) asserted that Auschwitz survivor Gryn was \"among those who destroy the faith\", was leaked and published. He wrote further that he was an \"enemy\" of the Reform, Liberal and Masorti movements, leading some to reject the notion that he is \"Chief Rabbi\" for all Jews in Britain. He attended a memorial meeting for Gryn, a move that brought the wrath of some in the ultra-Orthodox community. Rabbi Dow Marmur, an Israel-based progressive Rabbi, argued that after attending the memorial service, Sacks then attempted to placate the ultra-Orthodox community, an attempt which Marmur has described as \"neurotic and cowardly.\"\n\nLater, in a letter to \"The Jewish Chronicle\" in May 2013, Jackie Gryn, the widow of Rabbi Gryn, wrote: \"I feel the time has come for me to lay to rest, once and for all , the idea… that there ever was a ‘Hugo Gryn Affair’, as far as I am concerned, regarding the absence of the Chief Rabbi at the funeral of my late husband, Hugo… From the beginning, relations were cordial and sympathetic and have remained so\", she wrote. \"There has never been any personal grievance between us concerning his non-attendance at the funeral, which promoted such venomous and divisive comments and regrettably continues to do so.\"\n\nSacks responded to the incident by rethinking his relationship with the non-Orthodox movements, eventually developing what he called the \"two principles\". Responding to an interview shortly before his retirement, he wrote that \"You try and make things better in the future. As a result of the turbulence at that time, I was forced to think this whole issue through and I came up with these two principles; on all matters that affect us as Jews regardless of our religious differences we work together regardless of our religious differences, and on all things that touch our religious differences we agree to differ, but with respect. As a result of those two principles, relations between Reform and Orthodox have got much better and are actually a model for the rest of the Jewish world. Progressive rabbis sit with me on the top table of the Council of Christians and Jews, we stand together for Israel. All of this flowed from those two principles. Until then there had been a view never to do anything with the non-Orthodox movements but once you thought it through you saw that there were all sorts of opportunities.\"\n\nRabbi Sacks would later draw some criticism when he and his Beth Din prevented the retired Rabbi Louis Jacobs, who had helped establish the British branch of the Masorti movement, from being called up for the Reading of the Torah on the Saturday before his granddaughter's wedding.\n\nSacks has expressed concern at what he regards as the negative effects of materialism and secularism in European society, arguing that they undermine the basic values of family life and lead to selfishness. In 2009, Sacks gave an address claiming that Europeans have chosen consumerism over the self-sacrifice of parenting children, and that \"the major assault on religion today comes from the neo-Darwinians\". He argued that Europe is in population decline \"because non-believers lack shared values of family and community that religion has\".\n\nRabbi Sacks made remarks at an inter-faith reception attended by the Queen, in November 2011, in which he criticised what he believed to be the selfish consumer culture that has only brought unhappiness. \"The consumer society was laid down by the late Steve Jobs coming down the mountain with two tablets, iPad one and iPad two, and the result is that we now have a culture of iPod, iPhone, iTune, i, i, i. When you're an individualist, egocentric culture and you only care about 'I', you don’t do terribly well.\" In a later statement, the Chief Rabbi's office said \"The Chief Rabbi meant no criticism of either Steve Jobs personally or the contribution Apple has made to the development of technology in the 21st century.\"\n\nIn July 2012 a group of prominent British Jews criticised Sacks for opposing plans to allow civil marriage for gays and lesbians. He has said that he understands \"the fear that gays have of prejudice and persecution\" and went on to say, in a lecture on the institution of marriage, that a world that persecutes homosexuals is one \"to which we should never return.\"\n\nRabbi Sacks is an advocate of interfaith dialogue and sits on the Board of World Religious Leaders for the Elijah Interfaith Institute.\n\nIn October 2017, Jonathan Sacks inveighed against a “politics of anger” he said was corroding the fabric of U.S. society. “The politics of anger that’s emerged in our time is full of danger,” Sacks said. He decried the breakdown of American society into narrower and narrower identities that nurtured a “culture of grievances.” Sacks warned that “The social contract is still there, but the social covenant is being lost.”\n\nIn 2013, before he became Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn complained that the Palestinian ambassador had been “berated” by “Zionists” who “don't understand English irony”, while the ambassador “does understand English irony”. In 2018, Rabbi Sacks said these remarks depicted Jews as alien to the UK and that now “we have an anti-Semite as the leader of the Labour Party.”\n\nFollowing his remarks, multiple Corbyn supporters made critical statements about Sacks.\n\n\n\n\nSacks married Elaine Taylor in 1970 and together they had three children: Joshua, Dina and Gila.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47863585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47863585", "title": "Kalasha", "text": "Kalasha\n\nA kalasha, also spelled kalash or kalasa (, ; , , literally \"pitcher, pot\"), is a metal (brass, copper, silver or gold) pot with a large base and small mouth, large enough to hold a coconut.\n\nSometimes \"Kalasha\" also refers to such a pot filled with water and topped with a coronet of mango leaves and a coconut. This combination is often used in Hindu rites and depicted in Hindu iconography. The entire arrangement is called Purna-Kalasha (), Purna-Kumbha (), or Purna-ghata (). Each of these names literally means \"full or complete vessel\" when the pot is referred to as the Kalasha (to avoid confusion, this article will refer to the pot as Kalasha and the entire arrangement as Purna-Kalasha). Sometimes the Kalasha is filled with coins, grain, gems, gold, or a combination of these items instead of water. The coronet of 5, 7, or 11 mango leaves is placed such that the tips of the leaves touch water in the Kalasha. The coconut is sometimes wrapped with a red cloth and red thread; the top of the coconut (called \"Shira\" – literally \"head\") is kept uncovered. A sacred thread is tied around the metal pot. The Shira is kept facing the sky. \nThe Kalasha is viewed as an auspicious object in Jainism. The Kalasha is used as a ceremonial object as well as a decorative motif in Indian art and architecture. The Kalasha motif was used in decorating bases and capitals of pillars from the 5th century.\n\nThe Purna-Kalasha is considered a symbol of abundance and \"source of life\" in the Vedas. \nPurna-Kumbha is preeminently a Vedic motif, known from the time of Rigveda. It is also called Soma-Kalasha, Chandra-Kalasha, Indra-Kumbha, Purnaghata, Purna-Virakamsya, Bhadra ghata, or Mangala ghata. It is referred to as \"overflowing full vase\" (purno-asya Kalasha) in the Vedas.\n\nThe Kalasha is believed to contain amrita, the elixir of life, and thus is viewed as a symbol of abundance, wisdom, and immortality. The Kalasha is often seen in Hindu iconography as an attribute, in the hands of Hindu deities like the creator god Brahma, the destroyer god Shiva as a teacher, and the goddess of prosperity Lakshmi.\n\nThe Purna-Kalasha is believed to be a symbol of auspiciousness embodying either Ganesha, remover of obstacles, or his mother Gauri, the goddess of household bounty or Lakshmi. The Purna-Kalasha is worshipped in all Hindu festivities related to marriage and childbirth, as a mother goddess or Devi. In this context, the metal pot or Kalasha represents material things: a container of fertility - the earth and the womb, which nurtures and nourishes life. The mango leaves associated with Kama, the god of love, symbolize the pleasure aspect of fertility. The coconut, a cash crop, represents prosperity and power. The water in the pot represents the life-giving ability of Nature.\n\nSometimes, a silver or brass face of the Goddess is attached over the coconut of the Purna-Kalasha. In this form, the Purna-Kalasha symbolizes the Goddess as the manifestation of mother earth with her water, minerals, and vegetation. This method of \"Kalash pooja\" (worship) has come in for Vishnu in household functions too.\n\nThe Purna-Kalasha is also worshipped at Hindu ceremonies like \"Griha Pravesha\" (house warming), child naming, \"havan\" (fire-sacrifice), \"Vaastu dosha\" rectification, and daily worship.\n\nOther intrepretations of the Purna-Kalasha associate with the five elements or the chakras. The wide base of metal pot represents the element Prithvi (Earth), the expanded centre - Ap (water), neck of pot - Agni (fire), the opening of the mouth - Vayu (air), and the coconut and mango leaves - Akasha (aether). In contexts of chakras, the \"Shira\" (literally \"head\") - top of the coconut symbolizes \"Sahasrara chakra\" and the \"Moola\" (literally \"base\") - base of Kalasha - the \"Muladhara chakra\".\n\nA kalash is placed with due rituals on all important occasions. It is placed near the entrance as a sign of welcome. It is also used in a traditional manner while receiving holy personages.\n\nThe Kalasha is included in the Ashtamangala lists of both the Svetambara and Digambara sects of Jainism. Two eyes are depicted around the Kalasha, symbolising right faith and right knowledge. It is used for religious and social ceremonies. It is used in temples when certain images are being worshipped. When one enters a new home it is customary to carry the kalasha on the head reciting mantras. This ceremony is performed to welcome grace and happiness into the new home. They first appear in stone in the Kushan Empire period (65-224 AD). It is a symbol of auspiciousness.\n\nThe Kalasha is part of the official state emblem of Andhra Pradesh state in India. \n"}

The term \"misbahah\" is also used by Arab Christians to refer to the Christian rosary or prayer rope.\n\nThe misbaḥah is also known as tasbīḥ () — not to be confused the of dhikr of tasbih — in non-Arab languages, particularly in Persian. In Turkey, it is known as \"tespih\".\n\nA misbaḥah is a tool which is used as an aid to perform dhikr, including the names of God in Islam, and the glorification of God after regular prayer. It is often made of wooden or plastic beads, but also of semi-precious gemstones such as carnelian and onyx, olive seeds, ivory, amber, pearls. \n\nThey usually consist of 99 beads to assist in the glorification of God following prayers: 33 Tasbeeh (subhāna-llāh ), 33 Tahmeed (ʾal-ḥamdu li-llāh), and 33 Takbeer (ʾAllāhu ʾakbar). Some suggest the 99 beads also refer to the 99 names of Allah. Smaller misbahas consist of 33 beads, in which case one cycles through them three times to complete 99.

{"id": "2448259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2448259", "title": "New Forest coven", "text": "New Forest coven\n\nThe New Forest coven were an alleged group of witches who met around the area of the New Forest in southern England during the early 20th century. According to his own claims, in September 1939, a British occultist named Gerald Gardner was initiated into the coven and subsequently used its beliefs and practices as a basis from which he formed the tradition of Gardnerian Wicca. Gardner described some of his experiences with the coven in his published books \"Witchcraft Today\" (1954) and \"The Meaning of Witchcraft\" (1959) although on the whole revealed little about it, saying he was respecting the privacy of its members. Meanwhile, another occultist, Louis Wilkinson, corroborated Gardner's claims by revealing in an interview with the writer Francis X. King that he too had encountered the coven and expanded on some of the information that Gardner had provided about them. According to Gardner, the faith which they followed was the continuation of the Witch-Cult, a pre-Christian religion that originated in the paganism of ancient Western Europe. This was in keeping with the widely held theories then propagated by the anthropologist Margaret Murray and her supporters.\n\nAs Wicca developed in the latter decades of the twentieth century, some of the figures who were researching its origins, such as Aidan Kelly and later Leo Ruickbie, came to the conclusion that the New Forest coven was simply a fictional invention of Gardner's to provide a historical basis for his faith. The historian Ronald Hutton accepted this as a possibility, although recognised that it was not \"implausible\" that the coven had indeed existed. Later research by Philip Heselton which was published in the early twenty-first century, indicated that there was much evidence for a coven of practitioners - whose members he identified as being Dorothy Clutterbuck, Edith Woodford-Grimes, Ernest Mason, Susie Mason, Rosamund Sabine and Katherine Oldmeadow. \n\nGerald Gardner believed that the New Forest coven was a survival of the Witch-Cult, a pre-Christian pagan religion that worshipped a Horned God and a Triple Goddess and which had been persecuted during the witch trials of the Early Modern period. The existence of the Witch-Cult had been put forward by various writers in the nineteenth century, such as Jules Michelet and Charles Leland, but had risen to prominence in the early twentieth century when it was promoted in two of the works of Egyptologist Dr Margaret Murray: \"The Witch-Cult in Western Europe\" (1921) and \"The God of the Witches\" (1933). The idea of the pagan Witch-Cult has been disproved and dismissed by historians specialising in the Early Modern witch trials since Murray's death in 1963, with works by academics like Elliot Rose, Norman Cohn, Carlo Ginzburg and Keith Thomas instead showing the real nature of the witch trials as a combination of social, economic and religious factors. It is for this reason that the historian Ronald Hutton (1999) dismissed any possibility of the New Forest coven being the continuation of the Witch-Cult.\n\nInstead, it has been proposed that the New Forest coven had been founded in the early twentieth century by various occultists who wished to resurrect the Witch-Cult as described in Murray's works. Philip Heselton (2003), who performed the most exhaustive research into the group, speculated that the coven had been formed by a woman named Rosamund Sabine, who prior to moving to the New Forest in 1924 had been involved in various esoteric groups like the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. He thought that she, after reading \"The Witch-Cult in Western Europe\", became interested in witches, and believed herself to be the reincarnation of one. It was for this reason, he believed, that she gathered together some of her friends who also had an interest in the occult, and founded the coven. However, researcher Vikki Bramshaw suggests that Gardner may well have had some, albeit brief, meeting with local traditions in operation at that time. She writes that whilst a number of the members were from masonic or academic backgrounds of high society, others were working class people outside of those class-bound organisations. They included blacksmiths, manual labourers, and some with gypsy connections in the Forest. Davis Stanton writes, 'In other words, Wicca was only 'new' in the sense the New Forest was new - a re-designation of something that was there before, under another name.'\n\nA different origin theory was put forward by Steve Wilson (1996), who speculated that the coven might have been founded by members of a scouting organisation, the Order of Woodcraft Chivalry. Heselton accepted similarities between the Order and the coven, but did not believe that there was any direct connection.\n\nGerald Gardner claimed that after moving to the borough of Christchurch, Dorset in 1939, he got involved with the Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship, an occult organisation based upon Rosicrucianism. However, he was largely dissatisfied with the Order, and in particular its leader, George Alexander Sullivan, believing them to be devoid of any genuine esoteric knowledge. Meanwhile, he met a group of people within the Fellowship who claimed to have been involved in a form of Freemasonry known as Co-Masonry, who informed him that they had moved to the area where they had joined the Rosicrucian Order when their friend and fellow Co-Mason, Mabel Besant-Scott, had done so. The researcher Philip Heselton identified two of these individuals as Ernest and Susie Mason, a brother and sister couple who had in prior decades been involved in a variety of occult groups, including Co-Masonry and Theosophy, and who had recently moved to the area from Southampton. According to Gardner:\n\nThis group claimed to have known Gardner from a past life, and in September 1939, revealed to him that they were members of a Witches' coven, and then initiated him into Wicca in a ritual which took place in one of the homes owned by Dorothy Clutterbuck.\n\nGardner would reveal little about the coven and its members, although claimed that in August 1940, during the midst of the Second World War, they performed a ritual known as Operation Cone of Power which they hoped would influence the High Command of Nazi Germany and prevent them from invading Britain. This magical ritual, Gardner claimed, took place inside the Forest, and involved the Witches raising a Cone of Power which they directed toward Germany and focused on sending the message into the minds of the German leaders that they would not be able to cross the English Channel. Gardner also noted that several of the older and frailer practicing Witches died after practicing the ritual, something that was confirmed by Louis Wilkinson, who claimed that it was because they had performed the ritual naked, without goose grease on the skin to keep them warm, and that as such they had contracted pneumonia. Investigating these claims, Heselton found two locals who died soon after the ritual: a reporter, Walter Forder (1881–1940), and a blacksmith, Charles Loader (1864–1940), whom he speculated were involved in the rite.\n\nAccording to Gardner, his first contact with the witches was through an inner group within the Crotona Fellowship, a Rosicrucian society that operated a theatre in Christchurch. They were a reserved group, who remained somewhat separate from other members of the order and the theatre. Historian Philip Heselton has identified some of the members of this group as Edith Woodford-Grimes, Ernie Mason, and his sisters Susie Mason and Rosetta Fudge. It is possible that by the late 1930s some members of the Crotona Fellowship, inspired by the work of Margaret Murray, were performing rituals based on Co-Masonry and incorporating elements of folklore, and that these were the rituals that Gardner encountered.\n\nThe Mason family, researched by Heselton, lived in Southampton for a period of over 150 years. One of Heselton's informants described Ernie in particular and the family in general, as 'witches', adding that Ernie, who he had known for several years, had had to give up because he found the rituals too strenuous. Rosetta was a keen follower of Anthroposophy; Susie was a Co-Freemason and Theosophist, and Ernie, who claimed to have been fully aware from the moment of his birth, was an enthusiastic esotericist and taught mental exercises in the Crotona Fellowship. Their father George Miles Mason, an optician and astronomer, had built a meeting hall in Southampton which seems to have been used for the meetings of various esoteric groups, including Co-Freemasonry. Heselton points to a reference to nearby Toothill as a \"witch centre\" in a book by Justine Glass, who does not name her informant. In the 1881 census nearly a quarter of the inhabitants of that hamlet (three families) had the surname Mason (an otherwise uncommon name in that part of England); based on this and other circumstantial evidence he proposes that the Mason family could have been the custodians of a hereditary witchcraft tradition.\n\nThe priestess who initiated Gardner into witchcraft was referred to as \"Dafo\" or \"Daffo\". She taught music and elocution, and her daughter married a dentist; these and other details identify her as Edith Rose Woodford-Grimes. She lived in the same street as the Mason family between 1922 and 1937, when they were heavily involved in esoteric activities. By 1938 she was living in Christchurch near the Rosicrucian theatre, and was an active member. In August 1940, at her daughter's wedding, the bride was given away by Gerald Gardner, who was described as a \"close friend\". Edith remained a close friend of Gardner's for the rest of his life.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1523052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1523052", "title": "Olmec religion", "text": "Olmec religion\n\nThe religion of the Olmec people significantly influenced the social development and mythological world view of Mesoamerica. Scholars have seen echoes of Olmec supernatural in the subsequent religions and mythologies of nearly all later pre-Columbian era Mesoamericans cultures.\n\nThe first Mesoamerican civilization, the Olmecs, developed on present-day Mexico southern Gulf Coast in the centuries before 1200 BCE. The culture lasted until roughly 400 BCE, at which time their center of La Venta lay abandoned. The Olmec culture is often considered a \"mother culture\" to later Mesoamerican cultures. \n\nThere is no surviving direct account of the Olmec's religious beliefs, unlike the Mayan \"Popol Vuh\", or the Aztecs, with their many codices and conquistador accounts. \n\nArchaeologists, therefore, have had to rely on other techniques to reconstruct Olmec beliefs, most prominently:\n\nThe latter two techniques assume that there is a continuity extending from Olmec times through later Mesoamerican cultures to the present day. This assumption is called the Continuity Hypothesis. Using these techniques, researchers have discerned several separate deities or supernaturals embodying the characteristics of various animals.\n\nOlmec religious activities were performed by a combination of rulers, full-time priests, and shamans. The rulers seem to have been the most important religious figures, with their links to the Olmec deities or supernaturals providing legitimacy for their rule. There is also considerable evidence for shamans in the Olmec archaeological record, particularly in the so-called \"transformation figures\". \n\nSpecifics concerning Olmec religion are a matter of some conjecture. Early researchers found religious beliefs to be centered upon a jaguar god. This view was challenged in the 1970s by Peter David Joralemon, whose Ph. D. paper and subsequent article posited what are now considered to be 8 different supernaturals. Over time Joralemon's viewpoint has become the predominant exposition of the Olmec pantheon. The study of Olmec religion, however, is still in its infancy and any list of Olmec supernaturals or deities can be neither definitive nor comprehensive. \n\nThe names and identities of these supernaturals are only provisional and the details concerning many of them remain poorly known. The confusion stems in part because the supernaturals are defined as a cluster of icongraphic motifs. Any given motif may appear in multiple supernaturals. For example, \"flame eyebrows\" are seen at times within representations of both the Olmec Dragon and the Bird Monster, and the cleft head is seen on all five supernaturals that appear on Las Limas Monument 1. To add to the confusion, Joralemon suggested that many of these gods had multiple aspects – for example, Joralemon had identified a God I-A through a God I-F.\n\nDespite the use of the term \"god\", none of these deities and supernaturals show any sexual characteristics which would indicate gender.\n\nAlso known as the Earth Monster, the Olmec Dragon has flame eyebrows, a bulbous nose, and bifurcated tongue. When viewed from the front, the Olmec Dragon has trough-shaped eyes; when viewed in profile, the eyes are L-shaped. Fangs are prominent, often rendered as an upside-down U-shaped bracket. With the Bird Monster, the Olmec Dragon is one of the most commonly depicted supernaturals.\n\nMiller & Taube differentiate a Personified Earth Cave, equating it with Joralmon's God I-B.\n\nAnother probable supernatural is identified by the plants sprouting from its cleft head. A carved celt from Veracruz shows a representation of God II, or the Maize God, growing corn from his cleft, and also shows this god with the snarling face associated with the jaguar. This deity is rarely shown with a full body.\n\nThere is considerable disagreement between researchers whether the Rain Spirit and were-jaguar are one distinct or two separate supernaturals. Christopher Pool, Anatole Pohorilenko, and Miller & Taube each equate the were-jaguar with the Rain Deity, while Joralemon finds them to be two separate supernaturals. Joralemon states that the Olmec rain spirit \"is based on were-jaguar features\", but is not the were-jaguar per se. More recent scholarship by Carolyn Tate questions the existence of \"were-jaguar\" (a fantastical concept coined soon after the release of the \"WereWolf in London\") imagery and instead argues for the centrality of embryo-corn kernel iconography within Olmec iconography.\n\nIn a later paper, Taube proposed that the Rain Spirit was instead the seed phase version of the Maize God.\n\nThis enigmatic deity is named for the narrow band that runs along the side of its face through its almond-shaped eye with its round iris. Like many other supernaturals, the Banded-eye God has a cleft head and a downturned mouth. Unlike others, the Banded-eye God is only known from its profile - these renditions are generally concentrated on bowls from the Valley of Mexico (as shown on left), although the Banded-eye God is one of the five supernaturals shown on Las Limas Monument 1 from the Olmec heartland.\n\nRather than a distinct supernatural in its own right, however, Taube finds God VI to be yet another aspect of the Maize God.\n\nDesignated God VII by Scott Pelly, the feathered (or plumed) serpent depicted throughout Mesoamerica first appears in Olmec times, although there is some disagreement concerning its importance to the Olmec. The Feathered Serpent appears on La Venta Stele 19 (above) and within a Juxtlahuaca cave painting (see ), locations hundreds of miles apart.\n\nMost often recognized by its shark tooth, the head of the monster also features a crescent-shaped eye, and a small lower jaw. When depicted in its full-body form, such as on San Lorenzo Monument 58 or on the Young Lord figurine, the anthropomorphic Fish Monster also displays crossed bands, a dorsal fin, a split tail. This supernatural's profile is shown on the left leg of Las Limas Monument 1 (see ).\n\nMarshall Howard Saville first suggested in 1929 that the Olmec deities were forerunners of later Mesoamerican gods, linking were-jaguar votive axes with the Aztec god Tezcatlipoca. This proposal was amplified by Miguel Covarrubias in his 1957 work \"Indian Art of Mexico and Central America\" where he famously drew a family tree showing 19 later Mesoamerican rain deities as descendents of a \"jaguar masked\" deity portrayed on a votive axe. The Continuity Hypothesis has since been generally accepted by scholars, although the extent of Olmec influence on later cultures is still debated.\n\n"}

From their 'about us' page: \"A worldwide network of individuals...whose purpose is to make known the fact that Maitreya ― the World Teacher for the coming age ― and his group, the Masters of Wisdom, are now among us...\" \n\nThe organisation believes that a spiritually advanced being named Maitreya, the World Teacher, has returned to the everyday world and has been living among the Asian community in London since 19 July 1977. They assert that when Maitreya first arrived in London he lived in the Brick Lane area for several years before moving to another unspecified location in the city.\n\nShare International's publications claim that the coming of Maitreya (meaning \"friendly\" in Sanskrit) fulfills not only Buddhist prophecies about the appearance of a future great teacher named \"Maitreya\", but also the prophecies of a number of other world religions - including Christianity (the second coming of Christ), Hinduism (the Kalki avatar of Vishnu), Islam (the Imam Mahdi) and Judaism (the Jewish Messiah). Creme claims that Maitreya manifested himself through (or \"overshadowed\") Jesus 2,000 years ago, that Maitreya resided in the Himalayas, and that in 1977 he descended from his ancient retreat in the Himalayas and took an aeroplane to London. His belief is that Maitreya is omniscient and omnipresent, and that he took up residence in the Indian-Pakistani community of London in the Brick Lane area and has been living and working there, seemingly as an ordinary man, his true status known to relatively few. Furthermore, that Maitreya has been emerging gradually into full public view so as not to infringe humanity's free will. Journalists had been invited to find Maitreya in the Brick Lane area but were unable to do so. According to Creme, Maitreya influenced the ending of the Cold War, German reunification, and the ending of apartheid in South Africa.\n\nIn 1974, Benjamin Creme introduced a meditation called Transmission Meditation which he says is a way of transmitting spiritual energies through the meditators to create a pool of positive, spiritual energy for the benefit of humanity. Share International says there are 600 Transmission Meditation groups all over the world. The groups sit silently while spiritual energy is transmitted or 'stepped-down' by the Masters of Wisdom (also called by some groups Ascended Masters). This group meditation is a form of service, rather than the traditional personal meditation, which can be continued as well as this service activity. Transmission Meditation is a non-denominational meditation and people from all faiths (or none) take part in this form of service.\n\nBenjamin Creme was a student of the teachings of Alice Bailey, Helena Blavatsky and Helena Roerich.\n\nShare International says that Maitreya appeared before a Christian gathering of 6,000 people on the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya on 11 June 1988. This happening was widely published, among others by CNN, and photographs of the Jesus-like apparition were distributed worldwide. Since then, it is claimed that he has made many more appearances. From 1991 to 2002, they say Maitreya appeared before gatherings of orthodox religious groups worldwide. He addressed them briefly in their own language and was recognized by the majority of people in attendance as their awaited Teacher. Maitreya also apparently created healing springs of water in the areas near these appearances. These healing waters in Mexico, Germany, and India have drawn millions of visitors. The organisation has published a list of Maitreya's alleged appearances.\n\nIn the spring of 1982 Creme held a press conference in Los Angeles, California, USA. Afterwards, Creme wrote: \"It was hoped that the media would respond to my information at a level which would allow Him to come forward to them. This hope, however, was not fulfilled. While the media did show an interest in the reappearance story, it did not go so far as to actually get involved in searching for Maitreya. \n\nCreme wrote: In January 1986, Maitreya contacted media representatives at the highest level in Britain who agreed to make an announcement living in the Asian community of London. Under pressure from high religious and government officials, however, this statement was withheld.\nIn 1997 Creme made similar announcements that there would be imminent global TV broadcasts from Christ/Maitreya, though with far less media interest.\n\nIn the last month of 2008 Creme & Share International distributed a news release stating that soon, a very bright star would appear visible throughout the world, both night and day. Creme said it would be a sign that Maitreya’s first major public appearance would be very soon. In January 2009, several sightings of the ‘star’ were reported in the media, posted on YouTube, described in letters to Share International's magazine. \n\nOn 14 January 2010 in London, Benjamin Creme reported that Maitreya had given his first television interview recently \"...on a major US television network, inaugurating his public work.\" Creme stated that Maitreya had given over two dozen television interviews in 2010, and had not been introduced as Maitreya \"but as a seemingly ordinary man\" and that His media interviews continue with him proposing \"practical solutions to our pressing global problems.\" \n\nCreme continued until his demise in October of 2016, to claim that time is now very near for Maitreya's emergence. He did not receive any money for this work or royalties from his 14 books, and for over 30 years gave free public lectures around the world. A worldwide network of volunteers worked with Benjamin Creme to inform the public of this information.\n\nShare International maintains that Maitreya's interviews will eventually \"lead to an international press conference and, ultimately, Maitreya's 'Day of Declaration' when he will reveal his true identity.\"\n\nShare International does not claim Maitreya as a religious leader, or that he is to found a new religion, but that he is a teacher and guide for people of every religion and those of no religion. They believe this to be a time of great political, economic and social crisis, that Maitreya will inspire humanity to see itself as one family, and create a civilization based on sharing, economic and social justice, and global cooperation.\n\nThey highlight the main goals that Maitreya will immediately recommend dealing with after the 'Day of Declaration.' They say that he will call to action the people of the world to save the 862 million who are starving and hungry in a world of plenty. Among Maitreya's recommendations will be a shift in social priorities so that adequate food, housing, clothing, education, and medical care become universal human rights.\n\nBelievers claim that through the years, Maitreya has given 140 messages. Share International quotes him as saying, \"See your brother as yourself\". They say that Maitreya says only through sharing can the world be renewed, and that only sharing will bring justice and peace, and that his can only be achieved by the perception of brotherhood.\n\nShare International has offices in Amsterdam, London, Berkeley, Tokyo and several other countries. It publishes a monthly magazine, also called \"Share International\". In it, Creme has published a number of articles that he claims were dictated to him telepathically by a Master of Wisdom (Ascended Master), an enlightened being who apparently has already passed through evolution on this planet and has an expanded consciousness and therefore does not have to reside in a fixed human body. The magazine documents the gradual Emergence of Maitreya the World Teacher & the Masters of Wisdom, world changes, and many miracles sent in by people experiencing them, that they assert appear all over the world.\nAccording to the American religious scholar J. Gordon Melton, Creme's statement served as a catalyst for assessment of the New Age movement by Evangelical Christians. A week after the advertisements in 1982, other advertisements appeared in the \"Los Angeles Times\" denouncing Creme as an instrument of the Antichrist. Constance Cumbey (an Evangelical Christian and a Detroit area attorney and author) holds that \"Maitreya\" is a pseudonym for the Antichrist and regards Share International as an openly Luciferian movement.\nOther Christian Evangelicals distanced themselves from Cumbey's conspiracy theory.\n\nBritish journalist Mick Brown wrote \"I came to enjoy my talks with Mr. Creme. His stories of the Hierarchy, of hidden retreats in Tibet, of... the cogs... guiding the planet towards an age of harmony and enlightenment ...\" He described Creme's claims as fantastic and outlandish.

The park was opened to the public in 1998.\n\nNiki de Saint Phalle, inspired by Antoni Gaudí´s Parc Güell in Barcelona, and Parco dei Mostri in Bomarzo, as well as Palais Idéal by Ferdinand Cheval, and Watts Towers by Simon Rodia, decided to make something similar in design for her monumental sculpture park based on the Tarot. In 1979, she acquired some land on top of an Etruscan ruin in Garavicchio, Tuscany, about 100 km north-west of Rome along the coast. There she built the Giardino dei Tarocchi, containing twenty-two monumental figures representing her idea of the greater Mysteries of the tarot, constructed of reinforced concrete and covered with mirrors and ceramic mosaic. The figures can be walked through; the artist lived inside the sphinx-like \"Empress\" for several months during the construction of the garden.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2160292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2160292", "title": "The Way to Happiness", "text": "The Way to Happiness\n\nThe Way to Happiness is a 1980 booklet written by science-fiction author and Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard listing 21 moral precepts. The booklet is distributed by The Way to Happiness Foundation International, a Scientology-related nonprofit organization founded in 1984.\n\n\"The Way to Happiness\" is used as part of Scientology's Criminon rehabilitation program and is promoted by Scientology celebrities. The unsolicited distribution of personalised copies of the booklet to schools and mayors' offices has caused controversy, and while it is promoted as secular in nature, critics have stated that it includes ideas that are specific to Scientology, and is used as a recruiting tool. The booklet has been translated into 70 languages, which is a Guinness World Record for the most translations of a single work.\n\nThe Way to Happiness Foundation International is a non-profit 501(c)(3), incorporated in 1984. Headquartered at 201 East Broadway, Glendale, California, the foundation coordinates the activities of the Way to Happiness international network, including continental and national officies, associates and local groups. The Way to Happiness Foundation International is a division of the Association for Better Living and Education (ABLE), and is a \"Scientology-related entity\" under the 1993 IRS Closing Agreement.\n\nThe \"Way to Happiness\" booklet contains a set of 21 precepts, which were written by L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology. The precepts are: 1.Take Care of Yourself, 2. Be Temperate, 3. Don't Be Promiscuous, 4. Love and Help Children, 5. Honor and Help your Parents, 6. Set a Good Example, 7. Seek to Live with the Truth, 8. Do Not Murder, 9. Don’t Do Anything Illegal, 10. Support a Government Designed and Run for all the People, 11. Do not Harm a Person of Good Will, 12. Safeguard and Improve Your Environment, 13. Do Not Steal, 14. Be Worthy of Trust, 15. Fulfill Your Obligations, 16. Be Industrious, 17. Be Competent, 18. Respect the Religious Beliefs of Others, 19. Try Not to Do Things to Others That You Would Not Like Them to Do to You, 20. Try to Treat Others as You Would Want Them to Treat You, 21. Flourish and Prosper. The code is not limited to negative prohibition of actions that are bad, (stealing, killing, promiscuity, illegalities) but also the positive advisement of good actions (“care of oneself, temperateness, respect for parents, aid for children, truthfulness, safeguard of environment, etc.”) It was first published in 1981 by Regent House, Los Angeles as a 48-page paper-covered booklet (). This book is frequently given out by Scientologists. A campaign in the early 1990s to distribute the book in United States schools was described in Church of Scientology publications as \"the largest dissemination project in Scientology history\" and \"the bridge between broad society and Scientology.\" A song titled \"The Way to Happiness\" appears on the music album \"The Road to Freedom\", with music and lyrics by Hubbard.\n\n\"The Way to Happiness\" forms the core of the Church of Scientology prison program Criminon. It is also used in the Scientology-affiliated organization Narconon - all clients receive a pamphlet of \"The Way to Happiness\" when they begin the program. Volunteer Ministers, a Scientology-affiliated organization which responds to disaster scenes, distributes \"The Way to Happiness\" pamphlets, and did so in the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, and the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre. The Scientology organization Concerned Businessmen's Association of America (CBAA) has also distributed \"The Way to Happiness\", though representatives of the group have denied connections to Scientology. A 1993 article in \"Newsweek\" described cases where schools in Bellflower, California and Brooklyn, New York were influenced by CBAA to use \"The Way to Happiness\" in their schools, without knowing of the connections to Scientology. A 1990 \"Los Angeles Times\" article described the situation of a school in Fresno, California, where CBAA representatives refused to sponsor a contest at the school if \"The Way to Happiness\" pamphlet was not distributed.\nThe booklet has been distributed to hotels.\n\nScientologist Nancy Cartwright, the voice actor for Bart Simpson, mailed 1 million copies of \"The Way to Happiness\" booklet to residents of San Fernando Valley, California in December 2007. Cartwright told the \"Daily News of Los Angeles\": \"The mailing was from me to the San Fernando Valley community, the highest gang-infested area of Los Angeles. I thought it would make an impact, give someone a tool in order to make their lives happier at home.\" Isaac Hayes distributed \"The Way to Happiness\" pamphlets at his jazz performances in 2005.\n\nTom Cruise has distributed \"The Way to Happiness\" pamphlets, and passed out brochures embossed with his name at the elementary school where the 2005 movie \"War of the Worlds\" was filmed. He also gave copies of the pamphlet to managers of United International Pictures, the company which distributed \"War of the Worlds\" overseas. In a Church of Scientology-produced promotional video which appeared on YouTube in January 2008, Cruise cites \"the way to happiness\" as one of the benefits of Scientology: \"When you're a Scientologist and you drive by an accident, you know you have to do something about it, because you know you're the only one who can really help,\" said Cruise. \"We are the way to happiness. We can bring peace and unite cultures.\" Actor Miles Fisher parodies this quote by Cruise, in a scene in the 2008 film \"Superhero Movie\". Fisher's character in the film states that he can \"eat planets\" and that he is \"the way to happiness\".\n\nThe Church of Scientology offers two courses based on \"The Way to Happiness\": \"The Way to Happiness Course\", done at a Church organization or mission and \"The Way to Happiness Extension Course\", which can be done at home. There is also the \"Happiness Rundown\" which is a Scientology procedure of a \"Rundown\" including auditing.\n\nIn 1992, teachers in Anchorage, Alaska found copies of \"The Way to Happiness\" in their school mailboxes accompanied by a letter inviting the teachers to order more copies and distribute them to their students. Parents complained to the school district, and the school districts director of secondary education, Bill Mell, instructed school principals to tell teachers not to order \"The Way to Happiness\". Mell told the \"Anchorage Daily News\": \"I don't know that it went to every teacher ... It looks as if they got a hold of the teachers' mailing list.\" A local businessman and Scientologist who was a member of the Concerned Businessmen's Association of America organization paid for the books to be distributed to the schools, and told the \"Anchorage Daily News\" that he believed both \"The Way to Happiness\" and the Concerned Businessmen's Association of America were not affiliated with the Church of Scientology.\n\nAt a 2005 fundraiser for the Boys & Girls Clubs of Clearwater, Florida, attendants found \"The Way to Happiness\" booklets in their goodie bags. The booklets contained the insignia of Boys & Girls Clubs on the front cover, and instructions on the back cover stating that additional copies could be obtained at the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Suncoast facilities. Carl Lavender, executive director of the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Suncoast, said that this usage of the Boys & Girls Clubs was unauthorized: \"...I'm not pleased. You can't produce materials with our logo on it unless I give permission. We are going to collect all of them back and have them discarded.\" Joanie Sigal of the Scientology volunteer group Clearwater Community Volunteers, and a member of the Clearwater Boys & Girls Club's board of managers, had originally suggested adding the Club's insignia and distributing the booklets, and requested that the corporate board officially endorse the booklet. Executive director Lavender denied the request, stating: \"The booklet ends as of today ... There needs to be a lesson. This cannot happen.\"\n\nIn 2005, Commander Mike Downing of the Los Angeles Police Department complained that \"the Church of Scientology forged his endorsement on The Way To Happiness Web site, prompting the LAPD to disavow any endorsement of Scientology and The Way To Happiness.\" \n\nIn 2007, The Way to Happiness Foundation produced and distributed pamphlets with sample endorsements from the mayors of Dallas, Texas and San Francisco, California. The books were sent to mayor's offices, accompanied by a letter asking mayors to purchase copies of the books for distribution in their city. The mayor of Dallas did not appreciate this unauthorized usage of the mayor's logo and the official seal of the city of Dallas, stating: \"Clearly we were not very comfortable and did not think it was appropriate to use the seal of the city of Dallas, the mayor's logo or my name on something we were not aware of.\" According to a report in \"The Dallas Morning News\", the city attorney's office of Dallas looked into possible options of response regarding the matter.\nSimilarly, in San Francisco, California, the mayor's office also received a boxful of the booklets and voiced displeasure with the unauthorized usage of the mayor's image, logo, and the seal of the city. According to a report by the Associated Press, the city ordered the Scientology group to stop using an unauthorized picture of Mayor Gavin Newsom on its promotional pamphlets. An official spokesman for the mayor of San Francisco released a statement, saying: \"The mayor does not support the unauthorized use of his image or the city seal on this booklet.\" The city attorney for San Francisco wrote a letter to \"The Way to Happiness Foundation\", citing California state law, which prohibits deceptive and misleading advertising that could create an appearance that the pamphlets are from a government agency. The city attorney also cited San Francisco law, writing that the Board of Supervisors must approve any commercial use of the city's official seal.\n\nIn Winnipeg, Manitoba a box of pamphlets was delivered to the mayor's office with the official City of Winnipeg logo and the image of mayor Sam Katz. No legal action was taken: \"This is obviously a sample sent to our office and it was not approved or paid for by our office... If material was being distributed on our behalf with a false endorsement, it would be a different story.\"\n\nIn a 2007 published US embassy cable, Ursula Caberta, the Director of the Working Group on Scientology (created by the Hamburg State Parliament to address all \"destructive groups\" which endanger society), obtained a booklet that contained the Hamburg mayor's photograph and signature, yet was actually a publication from The Way to Happiness Foundation. \nCaberta contended that \"Scientology regularly used misleading methods to fool individuals into joining and said that such booklets had been distributed to other German cities. For someone unfamiliar with Scientology publications, the booklet looked very much like information brochures from the City of Hamburg.\"\n\nIn October 2007, uniformed police officers visiting Whyalla High School in Australia distributed a booklet called \"Whyalla High School presents the way to happiness, a common-sense guide for better living\", against the school's guidelines for religious education. One parent told the Adelaide, Australia paper \"The Advertiser\" she had specifically told the school not to give religious instruction to her children, and other parents mistakenly thought that the booklets were distributed by the Education Department because Whyalla High School was displayed on the booklet's cover.\n\nIn March 2008, The Way to Happiness Foundation agreed to stop sending thousands of unsolicited, personalized copies of the booklet to elected officials in Florida after hundreds of them complained. Booklets sent to mayors had the mayor's name on the front, and an endorsement from the mayor on the back, along with the Florida state flag and the address of the town hall. A note advised prospective readers to contact town hall if they had further questions. The Foundation said it had sent about 2,800 mailings, comprising a total of 250,000 booklets, to Florida mayors, businesses and community groups. Following the complaints, the Foundation explained that the books were only samples meant to encourage the recipients to buy further copies, and said that it would henceforth send out unpersonalized stock copies only. Unlike many mayors who were reported to have been displeased at seeing their names on the personalized samples, Anthony Masiello, the mayor of Buffalo from 1994 to 2005, did authorize distribution of the booklet, complete with the city seal and a picture of the city hall, after a Scientology center opened in Buffalo in 2003.\n\nIn a speech given at a New Year's event in 2007, David Miscavige, the current leader of the Church of Scientology, claimed that the distribution of the booklet is aided by \"corporate tie-ins\", mentioning 7-Eleven in Taiwan, Coca-Cola Pakistan, Philips Electronics in Pakistan, and Dell in Africa as companies who supported the Foundation as part of their efforts to address their \"third-world image problems\". A video of the speech was released to YouTube in February 2008. A spokesman for Dell told the \"Los Angeles Times\" that they had researched the matter with their colleagues in Africa and elsewhere and found \"no evidence that this is accurate ... it's not our practice to disseminate religious materials of any kind.\" Representatives from Philips and 7-Eleven told the \"Los Angeles Times\" that they were unaware of any such association, but said they were looking into the matter.\n\n\"The Way to Happiness\" pamphlet caused controversy in Sderot, Israel in February 2008, when a group calling itself the \"Association for Prosperity and Security in the Middle East\" became active in the city. The non-profit group sent e-mails to social workers in Sderot, offering to help people cope with Kassam rocket attacks the city has been enduring. Dalia Yosef, head of an umbrella psychological organization in the region called Hosen Center, received complaints from multiple social workers about the e-mails, and stated: \"We intend to investigate this association, as we do every group that offers social and psychological services in Sderot\". In an e-mail response to \"The Jerusalem Post\", the Association for Prosperity stated: \"We are unaware of any Scientology activity whatsoever being offered to Sderot residents. In general, regarding your question on Scientology activity in Sderot or elsewhere, you should contact the official representatives of the religion and receive their response\".\n\nA representative of Scientology told \"The Jerusalem Post\" that the director-general of the Association for Prosperity was a Scientologist, as were most individuals in the organization, but that some were not, and said that the principles found in \"The Way to Happiness\" were \"totally different\" from Scientology. The organization stated: \"Claiming our organization is connected with Scientology just because our director-general studied Scientology is like saying that other nonprofits are hi-tech because volunteers work in hi-tech.\" Director-general of the Israeli Center for Cult Victims Ayelet Kedem described the organization as a front group for Scientology: \"Hiding behind a front organization is a common tactic... The idea is to create a positive image by obscuring the connection with Scientology... Later, people who undergo free workshops are convinced that they must correct flaws in their personality by taking Scientology courses. Those who are hooked end up giving all their possessions to the Church of Scientology\".\n\nIn Illinois in 2011, Rep. Dan Burke (D-Chicago) sponsored a resolution endorsing the \"Good Choices\" program, which is based on \"The Way to Happiness\", as one of a number of suitable tools for teaching character, morals and values. Actress Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson and a Scientologist, submitted testimony to a House education committee, stating the program had \"nothing to do with religion.\" Opponents voiced concerns about the program's links to the Scientology belief system, and said that promoting its use in schools would violate the principle of the separation of church and state. Burke accepted that the program's Scientology links were more substantial than he had thought. He said he would work on the resolution and present it again at a later date. The reporter stated, \"Not even the voice of Bart Simpson could convince Illinois lawmakers to approve a resolution aimed at teaching character in public schools because of its link to the Church of Scientology.\"\n\nThe Way to Happiness is described by the foundation as \"a non-religious moral code, based entirely on common sense, which is having profound effects around the world\". The religious scholar Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi states he has performed an extensive search in the history of religions, and has been unable to find a single case in which \"a religion was publicly propagating a secular version of its ethical system\". To illustrate the uniqueness of the booklet, he gave the following analogy: \"How about a secular, improved version of the Ten Commandments?\"\n\nThe text uses key words and concepts taken directly from Scientology beliefs – for example that \"survival\" is the fundamental point of life, that you can be truly happy if you become the \"cause\" of your own actions, and that the truth is \"what is true for you.\" A Brooklyn school principal who at first appreciated the booklet as \"a values-oriented book about righteousness and peace\" stopped using it after becoming aware that it contained \"an undercurrent of a religious nature.\"\n\nCritics argue that \"The Way to Happiness\" is primarily a recruiting tool for the church. According to Vicki Aznaran, former Inspector General of the Church's highest ecclesiastical organization, the Religious Technology Center, The Way to Happiness Foundation is \"a front group to get people into Scientology\" and the book is designed \"to make Scientology palatable to the masses.\" \n\n"}

{"id": "33870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33870", "title": "Walt Whitman", "text": "Walt Whitman\n\nWalter \"Walt\" Whitman (; May 31, 1819 – March 26, 1892) was an American poet, essayist, and journalist. A humanist, he was a part of the transition between transcendentalism and realism, incorporating both views in his works. Whitman is among the most influential poets in the American canon, often called the father of free verse. His work was very controversial in its time, particularly his poetry collection \"Leaves of Grass\", which was described as obscene for its overt sexuality.\n\nBorn in Huntington on Long Island, Whitman worked as a journalist, a teacher, a government clerk, and—in addition to publishing his poetry—was a volunteer nurse during the American Civil War. Early in his career, he also produced a temperance novel, \"Franklin Evans\" (1842). Whitman's major work, \"Leaves of Grass\", was first published in 1855 with his own money. The work was an attempt at reaching out to the common person with an American epic. He continued expanding and revising it until his death in 1892. After a stroke towards the end of his life, he moved to Camden, New Jersey, where his health further declined. When he died at age 72, his funeral became a public spectacle.\n\nWalter Whitman was born on May 31, 1819, in West Hills, Town of Huntington, Long Island, to parents with interests in Quaker thought, Walter (1789–1855) and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873). The second of nine children, he was immediately nicknamed \"Walt\" to distinguish him from his father. Walter Whitman, Sr. named three of his seven sons after American leaders: Andrew Jackson, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson. The oldest was named Jesse and another boy died unnamed at the age of six months. The couple's sixth son, the youngest, was named Edward. At age four, Whitman moved with his family from West Hills to Brooklyn, living in a series of homes, in part due to bad investments. Whitman looked back on his childhood as generally restless and unhappy, given his family's difficult economic status. One happy moment that he later recalled was when he was lifted in the air and kissed on the cheek by the Marquis de Lafayette during a celebration in Brooklyn on July 4, 1825.\n\nAt age eleven Whitman concluded formal schooling. He then sought employment for further income for his family; he was an office boy for two lawyers and later was an apprentice and printer's devil for the weekly Long Island newspaper the \"Patriot\", edited by Samuel E. Clements. There, Whitman learned about the printing press and typesetting. He may have written \"sentimental bits\" of filler material for occasional issues. Clements aroused controversy when he and two friends attempted to dig up the corpse of Elias Hicks to create a plaster mold of his head. Clements left the \"Patriot\" shortly afterward, possibly as a result of the controversy.\n\nThe following summer Whitman worked for another printer, Erastus Worthington, in Brooklyn. His family moved back to West Hills in the spring, but Whitman remained and took a job at the shop of Alden Spooner, editor of the leading Whig weekly newspaper the \"Long-Island Star\". While at the \"Star\", Whitman became a regular patron of the local library, joined a town debating society, began attending theater performances, and anonymously published some of his earliest poetry in the \"New-York Mirror\". At age 16 in May 1835, Whitman left the \"Star\" and Brooklyn. He moved to New York City to work as a compositor though, in later years, Whitman could not remember where. He attempted to find further work but had difficulty, in part due to a severe fire in the printing and publishing district, and in part due to a general collapse in the economy leading up to the Panic of 1837. In May 1836, he rejoined his family, now living in Hempstead, Long Island. Whitman taught intermittently at various schools until the spring of 1838, though he was not satisfied as a teacher.\n\nAfter his teaching attempts, Whitman went back to Huntington, New York, to found his own newspaper, the \"Long-Islander\". Whitman served as publisher, editor, pressman, and distributor and even provided home delivery. After ten months, he sold the publication to E. O. Crowell, whose first issue appeared on July 12, 1839. There are no known surviving copies of the \"Long-Islander\" published under Whitman. By the summer of 1839, he found a job as a typesetter in Jamaica, Queens with the \"Long Island Democrat\", edited by James J. Brenton. He left shortly thereafter, and made another attempt at teaching from the winter of 1840 to the spring of 1841. One story, possibly apocryphal, tells of Whitman's being chased away from a teaching job in Southold, New York, in 1840. After a local preacher called him a \"Sodomite\", Whitman was allegedly tarred and feathered. Biographer Justin Kaplan notes that the story is likely untrue, because Whitman regularly vacationed in the town thereafter. Biographer Jerome Loving calls the incident a \"myth\". During this time, Whitman published a series of ten editorials, called \"Sun-Down Papers—From the Desk of a Schoolmaster\", in three newspapers between the winter of 1840 and July 1841. In these essays, he adopted a constructed persona, a technique he would employ throughout his career.\n\nWhitman moved to New York City in May, initially working a low-level job at the \"New World\", working under Park Benjamin, Sr. and Rufus Wilmot Griswold. He continued working for short periods of time for various newspapers; in 1842 he was editor of the \"Aurora\" and from 1846 to 1848 he was editor of the \"Brooklyn Eagle\".\n\nHe also contributed freelance fiction and poetry throughout the 1840s. Whitman lost his position at the \"Brooklyn Eagle\" in 1848 after siding with the free-soil \"Barnburner\" wing of the Democratic party against the newspaper's owner, Isaac Van Anden, who belonged to the conservative, or \"Hunker\", wing of the party. Whitman was a delegate to the 1848 founding convention of the Free Soil Party, which was concerned about the threat slavery would pose to free white labor and northern businessmen moving into the newly colonised western territories. Abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison derided the party philosophy as \"white manism.\"\n\nIn 1852, he serialized a novel titled \"Life and Adventures of Jack Engle: An Auto-Biography: A Story of New York at the Present Time in which the Reader Will Find Some Familiar Characters\" in six installments of New York's \"The Sunday Dispatch\". In 1858, Whitman published a 47,000 word series called \"Manly Health and Training\" under the pen name Mose Velsor. Apparently he drew the name Velsor from Van Velsor, his mother's family name. This self-help guide recommends beards, nude sunbathing, comfortable shoes, bathing daily in cold water, eating meat almost exclusively, plenty of fresh air, and getting up early each morning. Present-day writers have called \"Manly Health and Training\" \"quirky\", \"so over the top\", \"a pseudoscientific tract\", and \"wacky\".\n\nWhitman claimed that after years of competing for \"the usual rewards\", he determined to become a poet. He first experimented with a variety of popular literary genres which appealed to the cultural tastes of the period. As early as 1850, he began writing what would become \"Leaves of Grass\", a collection of poetry which he would continue editing and revising until his death. Whitman intended to write a distinctly American epic and used free verse with a cadence based on the Bible. At the end of June 1855, Whitman surprised his brothers with the already-printed first edition of \"Leaves of Grass\". George \"didn't think it worth reading\".\nWhitman paid for the publication of the first edition of \"Leaves of Grass\" himself and had it printed at a local print shop during their breaks from commercial jobs. A total of 795 copies were printed. No name is given as author; instead, facing the title page was an engraved portrait done by Samuel Hollyer, but 500 lines into the body of the text he calls himself \"Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos, disorderly, fleshly, and sensual, no sentimentalist, no stander above men or women or apart from them, no more modest than immodest\". The inaugural volume of poetry was preceded by a prose preface of 827 lines. The succeeding untitled twelve poems totaled 2315 lines—1336 lines belonging to the first untitled poem, later called \"Song of Myself\". The book received its strongest praise from Ralph Waldo Emerson, who wrote a flattering five-page letter to Whitman and spoke highly of the book to friends. The first edition of \"Leaves of Grass\" was widely distributed and stirred up significant interest, in part due to Emerson's approval, but was occasionally criticized for the seemingly \"obscene\" nature of the poetry. Geologist John Peter Lesley wrote to Emerson, calling the book \"trashy, profane & obscene\" and the author \"a pretentious ass\". On July 11, 1855, a few days after \"Leaves of Grass\" was published, Whitman's father died at the age of 65.\n\nIn the months following the first edition of \"Leaves of Grass\", critical responses began focusing more on the potentially offensive sexual themes. Though the second edition was already printed and bound, the publisher almost did not release it. In the end, the edition went to retail, with 20 additional poems, in August 1856. \"Leaves of Grass\" was revised and re-released in 1860 again in 1867, and several more times throughout the remainder of Whitman's life. Several well-known writers admired the work enough to visit Whitman, including Amos Bronson Alcott and Henry David Thoreau.\n\nDuring the first publications of \"Leaves of Grass\", Whitman had financial difficulties and was forced to work as a journalist again, specifically with Brooklyn's \"Daily Times\" starting in May 1857. As an editor, he oversaw the paper's contents, contributed book reviews, and wrote editorials. He left the job in 1859, though it is unclear whether he was fired or chose to leave. Whitman, who typically kept detailed notebooks and journals, left very little information about himself in the late 1850s.\n\nAs the American Civil War was beginning, Whitman published his poem \"\" as a patriotic rally call for the North. Whitman's brother George had joined the Union army and began sending Whitman several vividly detailed letters of the battle front. On December 16, 1862, a listing of fallen and wounded soldiers in the \"New York Tribune\" included \"First Lieutenant G. W. Whitmore\", which Whitman worried was a reference to his brother George. He made his way south immediately to find him, though his wallet was stolen on the way. \"Walking all day and night, unable to ride, trying to get information, trying to get access to big people\", Whitman later wrote, he eventually found George alive, with only a superficial wound on his cheek. Whitman, profoundly affected by seeing the wounded soldiers and the heaps of their amputated limbs, left for Washington on December 28, 1862, with the intention of never returning to New York.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Whitman's friend Charley Eldridge helped him obtain part-time work in the army paymaster's office, leaving time for Whitman to volunteer as a nurse in the army hospitals. He would write of this experience in \"The Great Army of the Sick\", published in a New York newspaper in 1863 and, 12 years later, in a book called \"Memoranda During the War\". He then contacted Emerson, this time to ask for help in obtaining a government post. Another friend, John Trowbridge, passed on a letter of recommendation from Emerson to Salmon P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, hoping he would grant Whitman a position in that department. Chase, however, did not want to hire the author of such a disreputable book as \"Leaves of Grass\".\n\nThe Whitman family had a difficult end to 1864. On September 30, 1864, Whitman's brother George was captured by Confederates in Virginia, and another brother, Andrew Jackson, died of tuberculosis compounded by alcoholism on December 3. That month, Whitman committed his brother Jesse to the Kings County Lunatic Asylum. Whitman's spirits were raised, however, when he finally got a better-paying government post as a low-grade clerk in the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the Department of the Interior, thanks to his friend William Douglas O'Connor. O'Connor, a poet, daguerreotypist and an editor at \"The Saturday Evening Post\", had written to William Tod Otto, Assistant Secretary of the Interior, on Whitman's behalf. Whitman began the new appointment on January 24, 1865, with a yearly salary of $1,200. A month later, on February 24, 1865, George was released from capture and granted a furlough because of his poor health. By May 1, Whitman received a promotion to a slightly higher clerkship and published \"Drum-Taps\".\n\nEffective June 30, 1865, however, Whitman was fired from his job. His dismissal came from the new Secretary of the Interior, former Iowa Senator James Harlan. Though Harlan dismissed several clerks who \"were seldom at their respective desks\", he may have fired Whitman on moral grounds after finding an 1860 edition of \"Leaves of Grass\". O'Connor protested until J. Hubley Ashton had Whitman transferred to the Attorney General's office on July 1. O'Connor, though, was still upset and vindicated Whitman by publishing a biased and exaggerated biographical study, \"The Good Gray Poet\", in January 1866. The fifty-cent pamphlet defended Whitman as a wholesome patriot, established the poet's nickname and increased his popularity. Also aiding in his popularity was the publication of \"O Captain! My Captain!\", a relatively conventional poem on the death of Abraham Lincoln, the only poem to appear in anthologies during Whitman's lifetime.\n\nPart of Whitman's role at the Attorney General's office was interviewing former Confederate soldiers for Presidential pardons. \"There are real characters among them\", he later wrote, \"and you know I have a fancy for anything out of the ordinary.\" In August 1866, he took a month off in order to prepare a new edition of \"Leaves of Grass\" which would not be published until 1867 after difficulty in finding a publisher. He hoped it would be its last edition. In February 1868, \"Poems of Walt Whitman\" was published in England thanks to the influence of William Michael Rossetti, with minor changes that Whitman reluctantly approved. The edition became popular in England, especially with endorsements from the highly respected writer Anne Gilchrist. Another edition of \"Leaves of Grass\" was issued in 1871, the same year it was mistakenly reported that its author died in a railroad accident. As Whitman's international fame increased, he remained at the attorney general's office until January 1872. He spent much of 1872 caring for his mother who was now nearly eighty and struggling with arthritis. He also traveled and was invited to Dartmouth College to give the commencement address on June 26, 1872.\n\nAfter suffering a paralytic stroke in early 1873, Whitman was induced to move from Washington to the home of his brother—George Washington Whitman, an engineer—at 431 Stevens Street in Camden, New Jersey. His mother, having fallen ill, was also there and died that same year in May. Both events were difficult for Whitman and left him depressed. He remained at his brother's home until buying his own in 1884. However, before purchasing his home, he spent the greatest period of his residence in Camden at his brother's home in Stevens Street. While in residence there he was very productive, publishing three versions of \"Leaves of Grass\" among other works. He was also last fully physically active in this house, receiving both Oscar Wilde and Thomas Eakins. His other brother, Edward, an \"invalid\" since birth, lived in the house.\n\nWhen his brother and sister-in-law were forced to move for business reasons, he bought his own house at 328 Mickle Street (now 330 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard). First taken care of by tenants, he was completely bedridden for most of his time in Mickle Street. During this time, he began socializing with Mary Oakes Davis—the widow of a sea captain. She was a neighbor, boarding with a family in Bridge Avenue just a few blocks from Mickle Street. She moved in with Whitman on February 24, 1885, to serve as his housekeeper in exchange for free rent. She brought with her a cat, a dog, two turtledoves, a canary, and other assorted animals. During this time, Whitman produced further editions of \"Leaves of Grass\" in 1876, 1881, and 1889.\n\nWhile in Southern New Jersey, Whitman spent a good portion of his time in the then quite pastoral community of Laurel Springs, between 1876 and 1884, converting one of the Stafford Farm buildings to his summer home. The restored summer home has been preserved as a museum by the local historical society. Part of his \"Leaves of Grass\" was written here, and in his \"Specimen Days\" he wrote of the spring, creek and lake. To him, Laurel Lake was \"the prettiest lake in: either America or Europe.\"\n\nAs the end of 1891 approached, he prepared a final edition of \"Leaves of Grass\", a version that has been nicknamed the \"Deathbed Edition.\" He wrote, \"L. of G. \"at last complete\"—after 33 y'rs of hackling at it, all times & moods of my life, fair weather & foul, all parts of the land, and peace & war, young & old.\" Preparing for death, Whitman commissioned a granite mausoleum shaped like a house for $4,000 and visited it often during construction. In the last week of his life, he was too weak to lift a knife or fork and wrote: \"I suffer all the time: I have no relief, no escape: it is monotony—monotony—monotony—in pain.\"\nWhitman died on March 26, 1892. An autopsy revealed his lungs had diminished to one-eighth their normal breathing capacity, a result of bronchial pneumonia, and that an egg-sized abscess on his chest had eroded one of his ribs. The cause of death was officially listed as \"pleurisy of the left side, consumption of the right lung, general miliary tuberculosis and parenchymatous nephritis.\" A public viewing of his body was held at his Camden home; over 1,000 people visited in three hours. Whitman's oak coffin was barely visible because of all the flowers and wreaths left for him. Four days after his death, he was buried in his tomb at Harleigh Cemetery in Camden. Another public ceremony was held at the cemetery, with friends giving speeches, live music, and refreshments. Whitman's friend, the orator Robert Ingersoll, delivered the eulogy. Later, the remains of Whitman's parents and two of his brothers and their families were moved to the mausoleum.\n\nWhitman's work breaks the boundaries of poetic form and is generally prose-like. He also used unusual images and symbols in his poetry, including rotting leaves, tufts of straw, and debris. He also openly wrote about death and sexuality, including prostitution. He is often labeled as the father of free verse, though he did not invent it.\n\nWhitman wrote in the preface to the 1855 edition of \"Leaves of Grass\", \"The proof of a poet is that his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorbed it.\" He believed there was a vital, symbiotic relationship between the poet and society. This connection was emphasized especially in \"Song of Myself\" by using an all-powerful first-person narration. As an American epic, it deviated from the historic use of an elevated hero and instead assumed the identity of the common people. \"Leaves of Grass\" also responded to the impact that recent urbanization in the United States had on the masses.\n\nWhitman was a vocal proponent of temperance and in his youth rarely drank alcohol. He once stated he did not taste \"strong liquor\" until he was 30 and occasionally argued for prohibition. One of his earliest long fiction works, the novel \"Franklin Evans; or, The Inebriate\", first published November 23, 1842, is a temperance novel. Whitman wrote the novel at the height of popularity of the Washingtonian movement though the movement itself was plagued with contradictions, as was \"Franklin Evans\". Years later Whitman claimed he was embarrassed by the book and called it \"damned rot\". He dismissed it by saying he wrote the novel in three days solely for money while he was under the influence of alcohol himself. Even so, he wrote other pieces recommending temperance, including \"The Madman\" and a short story \"Reuben's Last Wish\". Later in life he was more liberal with alcohol, enjoying local wines and champagne.\n\nWhitman was deeply influenced by deism. He denied any one faith was more important than another, and embraced all religions equally. In \"Song of Myself\", he gave an inventory of major religions and indicated he respected and accepted all of them—a sentiment he further emphasized in his poem \"With Antecedents\", affirming: \"I adopt each theory, myth, god, and demi-god, / I see that the old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are true, without exception\". In 1874, he was invited to write a poem about the Spiritualism movement, to which he responded, \"It seems to me nearly altogether a poor, cheap, crude humbug.\" Whitman was a religious skeptic: though he accepted all churches, he believed in none. God, to Whitman, was both immanent and transcendent and the human soul was immortal and in a state of progressive development. \"American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia\" classes him as one of several figures who \"took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world.\"\n\nThough biographers continue to debate Whitman's sexuality, he is usually described as either homosexual or bisexual in his feelings and attractions. Whitman's sexual orientation is generally assumed on the basis of his poetry, though this assumption has been disputed. His poetry depicts love and sexuality in a more earthy, individualistic way common in American culture before the medicalization of sexuality in the late 19th century. Though \"Leaves of Grass\" was often labeled pornographic or obscene, only one critic remarked on its author's presumed sexual activity: in a November 1855 review, Rufus Wilmot Griswold suggested Whitman was guilty of \"that horrible sin not to be mentioned among Christians.\"\n\nWhitman had intense friendships with many men and boys throughout his life. Some biographers have suggested that he may not have actually engaged in sexual relationships with males, while others cite letters, journal entries, and other sources that they claim as proof of the sexual nature of some of his relationships. English poet and critic John Addington Symonds spent 20 years in correspondence trying to pry the answer from him. In 1890 he wrote to Whitman, \"In your conception of Comradeship, do you contemplate the possible intrusion of those semi-sexual emotions and actions which no doubt do occur between men?\" In reply, Whitman denied that his work had any such implication, asserting \"[T]hat the calamus part has even allow'd the possibility of such construction as mention'd is terrible—I am fain to hope the pages themselves are not to be even mention'd for such gratuitous and quite at this time entirely undream'd & unreck'd possibility of morbid inferences—wh' are disavow'd by me and seem damnable,\" and insisting that he had fathered six illegitimate children. Some contemporary scholars are skeptical of the veracity of Whitman's denial or the existence of the children he claimed.\n\nPeter Doyle may be the most likely candidate for the love of Whitman's life. Doyle was a bus conductor whom Whitman met around 1866, and the two were inseparable for several years. Interviewed in 1895, Doyle said: \"We were familiar at once—I put my hand on his knee—we understood. He did not get out at the end of the trip—in fact went all the way back with me.\" In his notebooks, Whitman disguised Doyle's initials using the code \"16.4\" (P.D. being the 16th and 4th letters of the alphabet). Oscar Wilde met Whitman in America in 1882 and told the homosexual-rights activist George Cecil Ives that Whitman's sexual orientation was beyond question —\"I have the kiss of Walt Whitman still on my lips.\" The only explicit description of Whitman's sexual activities is secondhand. In 1924, Edward Carpenter told Gavin Arthur of a sexual encounter in his youth with Whitman, the details of which Arthur recorded in his journal. Late in his life, when Whitman was asked outright whether his \"Calamus\" poems were homosexual, he chose not to respond. The manuscript of his love poem \"Once I Pass'd Through A Populous City\", written when Whitman was 29, indicates it was originally about a man.\n\nAnother possible lover was Bill Duckett. As a teenager, he lived on the same street in Camden and moved in with Whitman, living with him a number of years and serving him in various roles. Duckett was 15 when Whitman bought his house at 328 Mickle Street. From at least 1880, Duckett and his grandmother, Lydia Watson, were boarders, subletting space from another family at 334 Mickle Street. Because of this proximity, Duckett and Whitman met as neighbors. Their relationship was close, with the youth sharing Whitman's money when he had it. Whitman described their friendship as \"thick\". Though some biographers describe him as a boarder, others identify him as a lover. Their photograph [pictured] is described as \"modeled on the conventions of a marriage portrait\", part of a series of portraits of the poet with his young male friends, and encrypting male–male desire. Yet another intense relationship of Whitman with a young man was the one with Harry Stafford, with whose family Whitman stayed when at Timber Creek, and whom he first met when Stafford was 18, in 1876. Whitman gave Stafford a ring, which was returned and re-given over the course of a stormy relationship lasting several years. Of that ring, Stafford wrote to Whitman, \"You know when you put it on there was but one thing to part it from me, and that was death.\"\n\nThere is also some evidence that Whitman may have had sexual relationships with women. He had a romantic friendship with a New York actress, Ellen Grey, in the spring of 1862, but it is not known whether it was also sexual. He still had a photograph of her decades later, when he moved to Camden, and he called her \"an old sweetheart of mine\". In a letter, dated August 21, 1890, he claimed, \"I have had six children—two are dead\". This claim has never been corroborated. Toward the end of his life, he often told stories of previous girlfriends and sweethearts and denied an allegation from the \"New York Herald\" that he had \"never had a love affair\". As Whitman biographer Jerome Loving wrote, \"the discussion of Whitman's sexual orientation will probably continue in spite of whatever evidence emerges.\"\n\nWhitman reportedly enjoyed bathing naked and sunbathing nude. In his work \"Manly Health and Training\" written under the pseudonym Mose Velsor, he advises men to swim naked. In \"A Sun-bathed Nakedness\", he wrote,\n\nWhitman was an adherent of the Shakespeare authorship question, refusing to believe in the historical attribution of the works to William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon. Whitman comments in his \"November Boughs\" (1888) regarding Shakespeare's historical plays:\n\nWhitman opposed the extension of slavery in the United States and supported the Wilmot Proviso. At first he was opposed to abolitionism, believing the movement did more harm than good. In 1846, he wrote that the abolitionists had, in fact, slowed the advancement of their cause by their \"ultraism and officiousness\". His main concern was that their methods disrupted the democratic process, as did the refusal of the Southern states to put the interests of the nation as a whole above their own. In 1856, in his unpublished \"The Eighteenth Presidency\", addressing the men of the South, he wrote \"you are either to abolish slavery or it will abolish you\". Whitman also subscribed to the widespread opinion that even free African-Americans should not vote and was concerned at the increasing number of African-Americans in the legislature. George Hutchinson and David Drews have argued, without providing textual evidence from Whitman's own early writings or other sources, that what little that \"is known about the early development of Whitman's racial awareness suggests that he imbibed the prevailing white prejudices of his time and place, thinking of black people as servile, shiftless, ignorant, and given to stealing, although he would remember individual blacks of his youth in positive terms\".\n\nWalt Whitman is often described as America's national poet, creating an image of America for itself. \"Although he is often considered a champion of democracy and equality, Whitman constructs a hierarchy with himself at the head, America below, and the rest of the world in a subordinate position.\" In his study, \"The Pragmatic Whitman: Reimagining American Democracy\", Stephen John Mack suggests that critics, who tend to ignore it, should look again at Whitman's nationalism: \"Whitman's seemingly mawkish celebrations of the United States … [are] one of those problematic features of his works that teachers and critics read past or explain away\" (xv-xvi). Nathanael O'Reilly in an essay on \"Walt Whitman's Nationalism in the First Edition of \"Leaves of Grass\"\" claims that \"Whitman's imagined America is arrogant, expansionist, hierarchical, racist and exclusive; such an America is unacceptable to Native Americans, African-Americans, immigrants, the disabled, the infertile, and all those who value equal rights.\" Whitman's imaginative \"mawkish\" nationalism avoided issues concerning the genocide of Native Americans. As George Hutchinson and David Drews further suggest in an essay \"Racial attitudes\",\"Clearly, Whitman could not consistently reconcile the ingrained, even foundational, racist character of the United States with its egalitarian ideals. He could not even reconcile such contradictions in his own psyche.\" The authors concluded their essay with:\n\nWalt Whitman has been claimed as America's first \"poet of democracy\", a title meant to reflect his ability to write in a singularly American character. A British friend of Walt Whitman, Mary Smith Whitall Costelloe, wrote: \"You cannot really understand America without Walt Whitman, without \"Leaves of Grass\"... He has expressed that civilization, 'up to date,' as he would say, and no student of the philosophy of history can do without him.\" Modernist poet Ezra Pound called Whitman \"America's poet... He \"is\" America.\" Andrew Carnegie called him \"the great poet of America so far\". Whitman considered himself a messiah-like figure in poetry. Others agreed: one of his admirers, William Sloane Kennedy, speculated that \"people will be celebrating the birth of Walt Whitman as they are now the birth of Christ\".\n\nThe literary critic, Harold Bloom wrote, as the introduction for the 150th anniversary of \"Leaves of Grass\":\nIn his own time, Whitman attracted an influential coterie of disciples and admirers. Some, like Oscar Wilde and Edward Carpenter, viewed Whitman both as a prophet of a utopian future and of same-sex desire – the passion of comrades. This aligned with their own desires for a future of brotherly socialism.\nWhitman's vagabond lifestyle was adopted by the Beat movement and its leaders such as Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac in the 1950s and 1960s as well as anti-war poets like Adrienne Rich and Gary Snyder.\nLawrence Ferlinghetti numbered himself among Whitman's \"wild children\", and the title of his 1961 collection \"Starting from San Francisco\" is a deliberate reference to Whitman's \"Starting from Paumanok\".\nWhitman also influenced Bram Stoker, author of \"Dracula\", and was the model for the character of Dracula. Stoker said in his notes that Dracula represented the quintessential male which, to Stoker, was Whitman, with whom he corresponded until Whitman's death. Other admirers included the Eagle Street College, an informal group established in 1885 at the home of James William Wallace in Eagle Street, Bolton, to read and discuss the poetry of Whitman. The group subsequently became known as the Bolton Whitman Fellowship or Whitmanites. Its members held an annual 'Whitman Day' celebration around the poet's birthday.\n\nWhitman's poetry has been set to music by a large number of composers; indeed it has been suggested his poetry has been set to music more than that of any other American poet except for Emily Dickinson and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. Those who have set his poems to music have included John Adams; Ernst Bacon; Leonard Bernstein; Benjamin Britten; Rhoda Coghill; Ronald Corp; George Crumb; Frederick Delius; Howard Hanson; Karl Amadeus Hartmann; Hans Werner Henze; Paul Hindemith; Ned Rorem; Robert Strassburg; Ralph Vaughan Williams; Kurt Weill; and Roger Sessions. \"Crossing\", an opera composed by Matthew Aucoin and inspired by Whitman's Civil War diaries, premiered in 2015.\n\nIn 2014, German publisher issued the bilingual double-CD audio book of the \"Kinder Adams/Children of Adam\" cycle, based on translations by in the 2005 \"Children of Adam from Leaves of Grass\" (Galerie Vevais), accompanying a collection of nude photography by Paul Cava. The audio release included a complete reading by Iggy Pop, as well as readings by Marianne Sägebrecht; Martin Wuttke; Birgit Minichmayr; Alexander Fehling; Lars Rudolph; Volker Bruch; Paula Beer; Josef Osterndorf; Ronald Lippok; Jule Böwe; and Robert Gwisdek. In 2014 composer John Zorn released \"On Leaves of Grass\", an album inspired by and dedicated to Whitman.\n\nThe Walt Whitman Bridge, which crosses the Delaware River near his home in Camden, was opened on May 16, 1957. In 1997, the Walt Whitman Community School opened, becoming the first private high school catering to LGBT youth. His other namesakes include Walt Whitman High School (Bethesda, Maryland), Walt Whitman High School (Huntington Station, New York), the Walt Whitman Shops (formerly called \"Walt Whitman Mall\") in Huntington Station, Long Island, New York, near his birthplace, and Walt Whitman Road located in Huntington Station and Melville, New York.\n\nWhitman was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2009, and, in 2013, he was inducted into the Legacy Walk, an outdoor public display that celebrates LGBT history and people.\n\nA statue of Whitman by Jo Davidson is located at the entrance to the Walt Whitman Bridge and another casting resides in the Bear Mountain State Park.\n\nA coed summer camp founded in 1948 in Piermont, New Hampshire is named after Whitman.\n\n\n\n\n\nSites\n"}
