{"id": "4345455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4345455", "title": "Babalon", "text": "Babalon\n\nBabalon (also known as the Scarlet Woman, Great Mother or Mother of Abominations) is a goddess found in the occult system of Thelema, which was established in 1904 with English author and occultist Aleister Crowley's writing of \"The Book of the Law\", her name being later given in other works. In her most abstract form, she represents the female sexual impulse and the liberated woman. In the creed of the Gnostic Mass she is also identified with Mother Earth, in her most fertile sense. At the same time, Crowley believed that Babalon had an earthly aspect in the form of a spiritual office, which could be filled by actual women—usually as a counterpart to his own identification as \"To Mega Therion\" (The Great Beast)—whose duty was then to help manifest the energies of the current Aeon of Horus. He believed in his life the Lady of Babalon was personified as Lady Leah Hirsig, who, after several portraits, was consecrated, taking the name Alostrael.\n\nBabalon's consort is Chaos, the \"Father of Life\" and the male form of the Creative Principle. Babalon is often described as being girt with a sword and riding the Beast. She is often referred to as a sacred whore, and her primary symbol is the Chalice or Graal.\n\nAs Crowley wrote in his \"The Book of Thoth\", \"she rides astride the Beast; in her left hand she holds the reins, representing the passion which unites them. In her right she holds aloft the cup, the Holy Grail aflame with love and death. In this cup are mingled the elements of the sacrament of the Aeon\".\n\nBabalon is a complex figure, although, within one particular view of Thelemic literature, she is said to have three essential aspects: she is the Gateway to the City of the Pyramids, the Scarlet Woman and the Great Mother.\n\nWithin the mystical system of the A∴A∴, after the adept has attained the Knowledge and Conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel, he then might reach the next and last great milestone — the crossing of the Abyss, that great spiritual wilderness of nothingness and dissolution. Choronzon is the dweller there, and its job is to trap the traveler in his meaningless world of illusion. \n\nHowever, Babalon is just on the other side, beckoning. If the adept gives himself totally to her—the symbol of this act being the pouring of the adept’s blood into her graal — he becomes impregnated in her, then to be reborn as a Master of the Temple and a saint that dwells in the City of the Pyramids. From Crowley's book \"Magick Without Tears\":\n\nand from \"The Vision and the Voice\" (12th Aethyr):\n\nShe is considered to be a sacred whore because she denies no one, and yet she extracts a great price — the very blood of the adept and his ego-identity as an earthly individual. This aspect of Babalon is described further from the 12th Aethyr:\n\nThe concept contained within this aspect of Babalon is that of the mystical ideal, the quest to become one with All through the annihilation of the earthly ego (\"For as thy blood is mingled in the cup of BABALON, so is thine heart the universal heart.\"). The blood spilling into the graal of Babalon is then used by her to \"flood the world with Life and Beauty\" (meaning to create Masters of the Temple that are \"released\" back into the world of men), symbolized by the Crimson Rose of 49 Petals.\n\nIn sex magic, the mixture of female sexual fluids and semen produced in the sexual act with the Scarlet Woman or Babalon is called the Elixir of Life. Another alternative form of this Elixir is the Elixir Rubeus consisting of the menstrual blood and semen (abbreviated as \"El. Rub.\" by Crowley in his magical diaries), and is referred to as the \"effluvium of Babalon, the Scarlet Woman, which is the menstruum of the lunar current\" by Kenneth Grant.\n\nOne of the most extensive descriptions by Crowley of Babalon's Daughter is to be found in \"The Vision and the Voice\", 9th Aethyr, quoted in \"The Book of Thoth\":\n\n\"This is Babalon, the true mistress of The Beast; of Her, all his mistresses on lower planes are but avatars,\" said Crowley in \"The Vision and the Voice\".\n\nAlthough Crowley often wrote that Babalon and the Scarlet Woman are one, there are also many instances where the Scarlet Woman is seen more as a representative or physical manifestation of the universal feminine principle. In a footnote to \"Liber Reguli\", Crowley mentions that of the “Gods of the Aeon,” the Scarlet Woman and the Beast are “the earthly emissaries of those Gods.” . He then writes in \"The Law is for All:\"\n\nAleister Crowley believed that many of his lovers and magical companions were playing a cosmic role, even to the point of fulfilling prophecy. The following is a list of women that he considered to have been (or might have been) scarlet women (quotes are from \"The Law is for All\"):\n\n\nWithin the Gnostic Mass, Babalon is mentioned in the Gnostic Creed:\n\nHere, Babalon is identified with Binah on the Tree of Life, the sphere that represents the Great Sea and such mother-goddesses as Isis, Bhavani, and Ma'at. Moreover, she represents all physical mothers. Bishops T. Apiryon and Helena write:\n\nThe Whore of Babylon is referred to in several places in the Book of Revelation, a book which may have had an influence on Thelema, as Aleister Crowley says he read it as a child and imagined himself as the Beast. She is described in Chapter 17:3-6:\n\nAleister Crowley recorded his view of the Book of Revelation in \"The Vision and the Voice\".\n\nAnother source is from the system of Enochian magic created by Dr. John Dee and Sir Edward Kelley in the 16th century. This system is based upon a unique language, Enochian, two words of which are certainly relevant. The first is BABALOND, which is translated as \"harlot\". The other is BABALON, which means \"wicked\". Some flavour of context in which they appear in can be found in a communication received by Dee & Kelley in 1587:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1795739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1795739", "title": "Cosmic year (Chinese astrology)", "text": "Cosmic year (Chinese astrology)\n\nAccording to Jeung San Do, the universe generates and cultivates life through a cyclic process of birth, growth, harvest, and rest (生長殮藏). This is closely related to the fluctuation and interplay of the two polar energies, yin and yang and its cycle appeared in daily, yearly, and cosmically. 129,600 calendar years make up one Cosmic year and it was discovered by Shao Yung.\n\nThe creative cycle can be seen in the passing of one day. At night, yin is at its strongest. The moon, darkness, stillness, and quietness all have yin nature. Night is a time of rest. When the sun, which has yang nature, rises, it is a time of birth. People tend to follow this flow of energy by sleeping at night and waking up in the morning. As the sun rises, yang becomes stronger and people tend to become more active. The afternoon is a time of growth. Eventually, yang reaches its highest peak, and from that point on, yin starts to regain its influence, and human activity starts to wind down. For many people, the evening is a time of relaxation and entertainment. This is the harvest in which they enjoy what they have worked for. Finally, yin becomes very dominant and things tend to return to the night time state of rest.\n\nThis process can also be seen in the cycle of one year. Heat is a manifestation of yang, and when the temperature rises in spring, sprouts break through the surface of the ground, dead yellow grass is replaced with new green grass, and new leaves appear on the trees. Spring is a time of birth. As summer approaches, yang continues to rise as yin diminishes. Things grow more rapidly and vegetation becomes lush. Summer is a time of growth. By the time autumn comes, yin has started to regain its influence. Autumn is a time of harvest when things come to fruition, and during autumn, as yin becomes more and more dominant, things return to the winter state of rest. Year after year this cycle repeats.\n\nAccording to Jeung San Do's teachings, the universe follows the cycle of birth-growth-harvest-rest (生長殮藏) or spring-summer-autumn-winter. This cycle, called the Cosmic Year, repeats every 129,600 calendar years, a number calculated by Chinese scholar Shao Yung. At the beginning and end of each cycle, the universe is in a yin state of dormancy called the cosmic winter. On our planet, this manifests as an ice age. As the yang energy regains its influence, the cosmic winter changes to spring and new life and a new human species appear on the earth. We call the current stage of humanity homo sapiens sapiens. The time of cosmic spring and summer is one of growth and diversity during which many cultures and civilizations develop. It is also a time of conflict. Cosmic autumn is a time of returning to oneness, a time in which humanity harvests its diverse experiences and accomplishments to create a global civilization of harmony.\n\nAt any stage of the cosmic year, the position of the Earth's axis demonstrates the concurrent relationship between yin and yang. It is generally accepted that in the history of our planet there have been periodic changes in the Earth's poles, magnetism, and orbit.\n\nWhat is left to debate is whether these changes occur gradually or suddenly. If we examine changes in nature during a calendric year, it becomes obvious that change occurs both suddenly and gradually. An example of this is the cherry blossom, which blooms in March. Gradually, over the course of a few months buds grow on the cherry tree, but suddenly, within a day or so, all of the flowers bloom at once. Finally, with just one strong wind or a heavy rain all of the blossoms fall.\n\nIn anthroposophy, based on teachings by Rudolf Steiner, a cosmic year represents the Platonic year, a period of 25,920 years. This is the time required for the Sun's position at spring equinox to traverse the complete zodiac. So each zodiacal sign covers about 2160 years. The year 747 BCE marked the transition from Taurus to Aries and since 1453, the spring equinoctial sun is in Pisces. This cosmic cycle has a considerable influence on humanity in both physical and spiritual respects. For instance, the Aries period covered the Greek/Roman culture period ranging from the foundation of Rome (753 BCE) to the fall of Byzantium (1453), whereas the Taurus period marked the Egyptian/Chaldaean era. Another example is human breathing rhythm: an average of 18 cycles per minute represents 18 x 60 x 24 = 25,920 cycles per day. The number of daily sleep-wake-cycles of the conscious mind in an average human lifetime of 72 years adds up to the same platonic figure. Shao Yung's cosmic year represents exactly five platonic years (5x25,920=129,600).\n\nVedic scriptures delineate a cosmic cycle of creation and destruction marked by 4 Yugas. There is considerable debate on the duration of one Yuga, varying from 1200 to 432,000 or millions years. Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri estimates the duration of two total cycles (an descending and an ascending part) to comprise 24000 years. According to Vamadeva David Frawley the Yuga cycle relates to the precession of the equinoxes, thus suggesting a relationship with the platonic year. In the interpretations of these and other vedic scholars, modern times (1700–1900) have witnessed the end of the dark \"Iron Age\" (Kali Yuga), a notion supported by Rudolf Steiner.\n\n"}
{"id": "8169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8169", "title": "Dante Alighieri", "text": "Dante Alighieri\n\nDurante degli Alighieri (), commonly known by his short name Dante Alighieri or simply as Dante (; , ; – 1321), was a major Italian poet of the Late Middle Ages. His \"Divine Comedy\", originally called ' (modern Italian: \"Commedia\") and later christened ' by Giovanni Boccaccio, is widely considered the most important poem of the Middle Ages and the greatest literary work in the Italian language.\n\nIn the late Middle Ages, most poetry was written in Latin, accessible only to the most educated readers. In \"De vulgari eloquentia\" (\"On Eloquence in the Vernacular\"), however, Dante defended the use of the vernacular in literature. He would even write in the Tuscan dialect for works such as \"The New Life\" (1295) and the \"Divine Comedy\"; this highly unorthodox choice set a precedent that important later Italian writers such as Petrarch and Boccaccio would follow. \n\nDante was instrumental in establishing the literature of Italy, and his depictions of Hell, Purgatory and Heaven provided inspiration for the larger body of Western art. He is cited as an influence on John Milton, Geoffrey Chaucer and Alfred Tennyson, among many others. In addition, the first use of the interlocking three-line rhyme scheme, or the \"terza rima\", is attributed to him. In Italy, he is often referred to as ' (\"the Supreme Poet\") and '; he, Petrarch, and Boccaccio are also called \"the three fountains\" or \"the three crowns\".\n\nDante was born in Florence, Republic of Florence, present-day Italy. The exact date of his birth is unknown, although it is generally believed to be around 1265. This can be deduced from autobiographic allusions in the \"Divine Comedy.\" Its first section, the \"Inferno,\" begins, \"Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita\" (\"Midway upon the journey of our life\"), implying that Dante was around 35 years old, since the average lifespan according to the Bible (Psalm 89:10, Vulgate) is 70 years; and since his imaginary travel to the netherworld took place in 1300, he was most probably born around 1265. Some verses of the \"Paradiso\" section of the \"Divine Comedy\" also provide a possible clue that he was born under the sign of Gemini: \"As I revolved with the eternal twins, I saw revealed, from hills to river outlets, the threshing-floor that makes us so ferocious\" (XXII 151–154). In 1265, the sun was in Gemini between approximately May 11 and June 11 (Julian calendar).\n\nGiovanni Boccaccio described Dante's appearance and demeanor as follows: \"the poet was of middle height, and in his later years he walked somewhat bent over, with a grave and gentle gait. He was clad always in most seemly attire, such as befitted his ripe years. His face was long, his nose aquiline, and his eyes big rather than small. His jaws were large, and his lower lip protruded. He had a brown complexion, his hair and beard were thick, black, and curly, and his countenance was always melancholy and thoughtful.\"\nDante claimed that his family descended from the ancient Romans (\"Inferno\", XV, 76), but the earliest relative he could mention by name was Cacciaguida degli Elisei (\"Paradiso\", XV, 135), born no earlier than about 1100. Dante's father, Alighiero or Alighiero di Bellincione, was a White Guelph who suffered no reprisals after the Ghibellines won the Battle of Montaperti in the middle of the 13th century. This suggests that Alighiero or his family may have enjoyed some protective prestige and status, although some suggest that the politically inactive Alighiero was of such low standing that he was not considered worth exiling.\n\nDante's family was loyal to the Guelphs, a political alliance that supported the Papacy and which was involved in complex opposition to the Ghibellines, who were backed by the Holy Roman Emperor. The poet's mother was Bella, likely a member of the Abati family. She died when Dante was not yet ten years old, and Alighiero soon married again, to Lapa di Chiarissimo Cialuffi. It is uncertain whether he really married her, since widowers were socially limited in such matters, but this woman definitely bore him two children, Dante's half-brother Francesco and half-sister Tana (Gaetana). When Dante was 12, he was promised in marriage to Gemma di Manetto Donati, daughter of Manetto Donati, member of the powerful Donati family. Contracting marriages at this early age was quite common and involved a formal ceremony, including contracts signed before a notary. But by this time Dante had fallen in love with another, Beatrice Portinari (known also as Bice), whom he first met when he was only nine. Years after his marriage to Gemma he claims to have met Beatrice again; he wrote several sonnets to Beatrice but never mentioned Gemma in any of his poems. The exact date of his marriage is not known: the only certain information is that, before his exile in 1301, he had three children (Pietro, Jacopo and Antonia).\n\nDante fought with the Guelph cavalry at the Battle of Campaldino (June 11, 1289). This victory brought about a reformation of the Florentine constitution. To take any part in public life, one had to enroll in one of the city's many commercial or artisan guilds, so Dante entered the Physicians' and Apothecaries' Guild. In the following years, his name is occasionally recorded as speaking or voting in the various councils of the republic. A substantial portion of minutes from such meetings in the years 1298–1300 was lost, however, so the true extent of Dante's participation in the city's councils is uncertain.\n\nGemma bore Dante several children. Although several others subsequently claimed to be his offspring, it is likely that only Jacopo, Pietro, Giovanni, and Antonia were his actual children. Antonia later became a nun, taking the name Sister Beatrice.\n\nNot much is known about Dante's education; he presumably studied at home or in a chapter school attached to a church or monastery in Florence. It is known that he studied Tuscan poetry and that he admired the compositions of the Bolognese poet Guido Guinizelli—whom in \"Purgatorio\" XXVI he characterized as his \"father\"—at a time when the Sicilian school (\"Scuola poetica Siciliana\"), a cultural group from Sicily, was becoming known in Tuscany. His interests brought him to discover the Provençal poetry of the troubadours, such as Arnaut Daniel, and the Latin writers of classical antiquity, including Cicero, Ovid and especially Virgil.\nDante said he first met Beatrice Portinari, daughter of Folco Portinari, at age nine, and claimed to have fallen in love with her \"at first sight\", apparently without even talking with her. He saw her frequently after age 18, often exchanging greetings in the street, but never knew her well. In effect, he set an example of so-called courtly love, a phenomenon developed in French and Provençal poetry of prior centuries. Dante's experience of such love was typical, but his expression of it was unique. It was in the name of this love that Dante left his imprint on the \"dolce stil novo\" (\"sweet new style,\" a term which Dante himself coined), and he would join other contemporary poets and writers in exploring never-before-emphasized aspects of love (\"Amore\"). Love for Beatrice (as Petrarch would show for Laura somewhat differently) would be his reason for poetry and for living, together with political passions. In many of his poems, she is depicted as semi-divine, watching over him constantly and providing spiritual instruction, sometimes harshly. When Beatrice died in 1290, Dante sought refuge in Latin literature. The \"Convivio\" chronicles his having read Boethius's \"De consolatione philosophiae\" and Cicero's \"De Amicitia.\" He then dedicated himself to philosophical studies at religious schools like the Dominican one in Santa Maria Novella. He took part in the disputes that the two principal mendicant orders (Franciscan and Dominican) publicly or indirectly held in Florence, the former explaining the doctrines of the mystics and of St. Bonaventure, the latter expounding on the theories of St. Thomas Aquinas.\n\nAt 18, Dante met Guido Cavalcanti, Lapo Gianni, Cino da Pistoia and soon after Brunetto Latini; together they became the leaders of the \"dolce stil novo.\" Brunetto later received special mention in the \"Divine Comedy\" (\"Inferno\", XV, 28) for what he had taught Dante: \"Nor speaking less on that account I go With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are his most known and most eminent companions.\" Some fifty poetical commentaries by Dante are known (the so-called \"Rime,\" rhymes), others being included in the later \"Vita Nuova\" and \"Convivio.\" Other studies are reported, or deduced from \"Vita Nuova\" or the \"Comedy,\" regarding painting and music.\n\nDante, like most Florentines of his day, was embroiled in the Guelph–Ghibelline conflict. He fought in the Battle of Campaldino (June 11, 1289), with the Florentine Guelphs against Arezzo Ghibellines; then in 1294 he was among the escorts of Charles Martel of Anjou (grandson of Charles I of Anjou) while he was in Florence. To further his political career, he became a pharmacist. He did not intend to practice as one, but a law issued in 1295 required nobles aspiring to public office to be enrolled in one of the Corporazioni delle Arti e dei Mestieri, so Dante obtained admission to the Apothecaries' Guild. This profession was not inappropriate since at that time books were sold from apothecaries' shops. As a politician, he accomplished little but held various offices over some years in a city rife with political unrest.\nAfter defeating the Ghibellines, the Guelphs divided into two factions: the White Guelphs (\"Guelfi Bianchi\")—Dante's party, led by Vieri dei Cerchi—and the Black Guelphs (\"Guelfi Neri\"), led by Corso Donati. Although the split was along family lines at first, ideological differences arose based on opposing views of the papal role in Florentine affairs, with the Blacks supporting the Pope and the Whites wanting more freedom from Rome. The Whites took power first and expelled the Blacks. In response, Pope Boniface VIII planned a military occupation of Florence. In 1301, Charles of Valois, brother of King Philip IV of France, was expected to visit Florence because the Pope had appointed him peacemaker for Tuscany. But the city's government had treated the Pope's ambassadors badly a few weeks before, seeking independence from papal influence. It was believed that Charles had received other unofficial instructions, so the council sent a delegation to Rome to ascertain the Pope's intentions. Dante was one of the delegates.\n\nPope Boniface quickly dismissed the other delegates and asked Dante alone to remain in Rome. At the same time (November 1, 1301), Charles of Valois entered Florence with the Black Guelphs, who in the next six days destroyed much of the city and killed many of their enemies. A new Black Guelph government was installed, and Cante dei Gabrielli da Gubbio was appointed \"podestà\" of the city. In March 1302, Dante, a White Guelph by affiliation, along with the Gherardini family, was condemned to exile for two years and ordered to pay a large fine. Dante was accused of corruption and financial wrongdoing by the Black Guelphs for the time that Dante was serving as city prior (Florence's highest position) for two months in 1300. The poet was still in Rome in 1302 where the Pope, who had backed the Black Guelphs, had \"suggested\" that Dante stay. Florence under the Black Guelphs therefore considered Dante an absconder. Dante did not pay the fine, in part because he believed he was not guilty and in part because all his assets in Florence had been seized by the Black Guelphs. He was condemned to perpetual exile; if he returned to Florence without paying the fine, he could have been burned at the stake. (In June 2008, nearly seven centuries after his death, the city council of Florence passed a motion rescinding Dante's sentence.)\n\nHe took part in several attempts by the White Guelphs to regain power, but these failed due to treachery. Dante, bitter at the treatment he received from his enemies, also grew disgusted with the infighting and ineffectiveness of his erstwhile allies and vowed to become a party of one. He went to Verona as a guest of Bartolomeo I della Scala, then moved to Sarzana in Liguria. Later he is supposed to have lived in Lucca with a woman called Gentucca, who made his stay comfortable (and was later gratefully mentioned in \"Purgatorio\", XXIV, 37). Some speculative sources claim he visited Paris between 1308 and 1310, and other sources even less trustworthy took him to Oxford: these claims, first occurring in Boccaccio's book on Dante several decades after his death, seem inspired by readers who were impressed with the poet's wide learning and erudition. Evidently, Dante's command of philosophy and his literary interests deepened in exile and when he was no longer busy with the day-to-day business of Florentine domestic politics, and this is evidenced in his prose writings in this period, but there is no real evidence that he ever left Italy. Dante's \"Immensa Dei dilectione testante\" to Henry VII of Luxembourg confirms his residence \"beneath the springs of Arno, near Tuscany\" in March 1311.\n\nIn 1310, Holy Roman Emperor Henry VII of Luxembourg marched into Italy at the head of 5,000 troops. Dante saw in him a new Charlemagne who would restore the office of the Holy Roman Emperor to its former glory and also retake Florence from the Black Guelphs. He wrote to Henry and several Italian princes, demanding that they destroy the Black Guelphs. Mixing religion and private concerns in his writings, he invoked the worst anger of God against his city and suggested several particular targets that were also his personal enemies. It was during this time that he wrote \"De Monarchia\", proposing a universal monarchy under Henry VII.\n\nAt some point during his exile, he conceived of the \"Comedy\", but the date is uncertain. The work is much more assured and on a larger scale than anything he had produced in Florence; it is likely he would have undertaken such a work only after he realized his political ambitions, which had been central to him up to his banishment, had been halted for some time, possibly forever. It is also noticeable that Beatrice has returned to his imagination with renewed force and with a wider meaning than in the \"Vita Nuova\"; in \"Convivio\" (written c. 1304–07) he had declared that the memory of this youthful romance belonged to the past.\n\nAn early outside indication that the poem was underway is a notice by Francesco da Barberino, tucked into his \"Documenti d'Amore\" (\"Lessons of Love\"), written probably in 1314 or early 1315. Speaking of Virgil, Francesco notes in appreciative words that Dante followed the Roman classic in a poem called \"Comedy\" and that the setting of this poem (or part of it) was the underworld; i.e., hell. The brief note gives no incontestable indication that he himself had seen or read even the \"Inferno\" or that this part had been published at the time, but it indicates composition was well underway and that the sketching of the poem might have begun some years before. (It has been suggested that a knowledge of Dante's work also underlies some of the illuminations in Francesco da Barberino's earlier \"Officiolum\" [c. 1305–08], a manuscript that came to light only in 2003.) We know that the \"Inferno\" had been published by 1317; this is established by quoted lines interspersed in the margins of contemporary dated records from Bologna, but there is no certainty as to whether the three parts of the poem were each published in full or, rather, a few cantos at a time. \"Paradiso\" seems to have been published posthumously.\n\nIn Florence, Baldo d'Aguglione pardoned most of the White Guelphs in exile and allowed them to return. However, Dante had gone too far in his violent letters to \"Arrigo\" (Henry VII) and his sentence was not revoked.\n\nIn 1312 Henry assaulted Florence and defeated the Black Guelphs, but there is no evidence that Dante was involved. Some say he refused to participate in the assault on his city by a foreigner; others suggest that he had become unpopular with the White Guelphs, too, and that any trace of his passage had carefully been removed. Henry VII died (from a fever) in 1313, and with him any hope for Dante to see Florence again. He returned to Verona, where Cangrande I della Scala allowed him to live in certain security and, presumably, in a fair degree of prosperity. Cangrande was admitted to Dante's Paradise (\"Paradiso\", XVII, 76).\n\nDuring the period of his exile Dante corresponded with Dominican theologian Fr. Nicholas Brunacci OP [1240–1322] who had been a student of Thomas Aquinas at the Santa Sabina \"studium\" in Rome, and later at Paris. and of Albert the Great at the Cologne \"studium\". Brunacci became lector at the Santa Sabina \"studium\", forerunner of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, and later served in the papal curia.\n\nIn 1315, Florence was forced by Uguccione della Faggiuola (the military officer controlling the town) to grant an amnesty to those in exile, including Dante. But for this, Florence required public penance in addition to a heavy fine. Dante refused, preferring to remain in exile. When Uguccione defeated Florence, Dante's death sentence was commuted to house arrest on condition that he go to Florence to swear he would never enter the town again. He refused to go, and his death sentence was confirmed and extended to his sons. He still hoped late in life that he might be invited back to Florence on honorable terms. For Dante, exile was nearly a form of death, stripping him of much of his identity and his heritage. He addressed the pain of exile in \"Paradiso\", XVII (55–60), where Cacciaguida, his great-great-grandfather, warns him what to expect:\n\nAs for the hope of returning to Florence, he describes it as if he had already accepted its impossibility (in \"Paradiso\", XXV, 1–9):\nAlighieri accepted Prince Guido Novello da Polenta's invitation to Ravenna in 1318. He finished \"Paradiso\" and died in 1321 (aged 56) while returning to Ravenna from a diplomatic mission to Venice, possibly of malaria contracted there. He was buried in Ravenna at the Church of San Pier Maggiore (later called Basilica di San Francesco). Bernardo Bembo, praetor of Venice, erected a tomb for him in 1483.\n\nOn the grave, some verses of Bernardo Canaccio, a friend of Dante, dedicated to Florence:\n\nThe first formal biography of Dante was the \"Vita di Dante\" (also known as \"Trattatello in laude di Dante\"), written after 1348 by Giovanni Boccaccio. Although several statements and episodes of it have been deemed unreliable on the basis of modern research, an earlier account of Dante's life and works had been included in the \"Nuova Cronica\" of the Florentine chronicler Giovanni Villani.\n\nFlorence eventually came to regret Dante's exile, and the city made repeated requests for the return of his remains. The custodians of the body in Ravenna refused, at one point going so far as to conceal the bones in a false wall of the monastery. Nonetheless, a tomb was built for him in Florence in 1829, in the Basilica of Santa Croce. That tomb has been empty ever since, with Dante's body remaining in Ravenna, far from the land he had loved so dearly. The front of his tomb in Florence reads \"Onorate l'altissimo poeta\"—which roughly translates as \"Honor the most exalted poet\". The phrase is a quote from the fourth canto of the \"Inferno,\" depicting Virgil's welcome as he returns among the great ancient poets spending eternity in limbo. The ensuing line, \"L'ombra sua torna, ch'era dipartita\" (\"his spirit, which had left us, returns\"), is poignantly absent from the empty tomb.\n\nItaly's first dreadnought battleship was completed in 1913 and named \"Dante Alighieri\" in honor of him.\n\nOn April 30, 1921, in honor of the 600th anniversary of Dante's death, Pope Benedict XV promulgated an encyclical named \"In praeclara summorum\", calling him one \"of the many celebrated geniuses of whom the Catholic faith can boast\" and the \"pride and glory of humanity\".\n\nIn 2007, a reconstruction of Dante's face was undertaken in a collaborative project. Artists from Pisa University and engineers at the University of Bologna at Forlì constructed the model, portraying Dante's features as somewhat different from what was once thought.\n\nIn 2008, the Municipality of Florence officially apologized for expelling Dante 700 years earlier.\n\nA celebration was held in 2015 for the 750th anniversary of his birth.\n\nThe \"Divine Comedy\" describes Dante's journey through Hell (\"Inferno\"), Purgatory (\"Purgatorio\"), and Paradise (\"Paradiso\"); he is first guided by the Roman poet Virgil and then by Beatrice, the subject of his love (and of another of his works, \"La Vita Nuova\"). While the vision of Hell, the \"Inferno,\" is vivid for most modern readers, the theological niceties presented in the other books require a certain amount of patience and knowledge to appreciate. \"Purgatorio\" is arguably the most lyrical of the three, referencing more contemporary poets and artists than \"Inferno\"; \"Paradiso\" is the most heavily theological, and the one in which, many scholars have argued, the \"Divine Comedy\"'s most beautiful and mystic passages appear (e.g., when Dante looks into the face of God: \"all'alta fantasia qui mancò possa\"—\"at this high moment, ability failed my capacity to describe,\" \"Paradiso,\" XXXIII, 142).\nWith its seriousness of purpose, its literary stature and the range—both stylistic and thematic—of its content, the \"Comedy\" soon became a cornerstone in the evolution of Italian as an established literary language. Dante was more aware than most early Italian writers of the variety of Italian dialects and of the need to create a literature and a unified literary language beyond the limits of Latin writing at the time; in that sense, he is a forerunner of the Renaissance, with its effort to create vernacular literature in competition with earlier classical writers. Dante's in-depth knowledge (within the limits of his time) of Roman antiquity, and his evident admiration for some aspects of pagan Rome, also point forward to the 15th century. Ironically, while he was widely honored in the centuries after his death, the \"Comedy\" slipped out of fashion among men of letters: too medieval, too rough and tragic, and not stylistically refined in the respects that the high and late Renaissance came to demand of literature.\n\nHe wrote the \"Comedy\" in a language he called \"Italian\", in some sense an amalgamated literary language mostly based on the regional dialect of Tuscany, but with some elements of Latin and other regional dialects. He deliberately aimed to reach a readership throughout Italy including laymen, clergymen and other poets. By creating a poem of epic structure and philosophic purpose, he established that the Italian language was suitable for the highest sort of expression. In French, Italian is sometimes nicknamed \"la langue de Dante\". Publishing in the vernacular language marked Dante as one of the first in Roman Catholic Western Europe (among others such as Geoffrey Chaucer and Giovanni Boccaccio) to break free from standards of publishing in only Latin (the language of liturgy, history and scholarship in general, but often also of lyric poetry). This break set a precedent and allowed more literature to be published for a wider audience, setting the stage for greater levels of literacy in the future. However, unlike Boccaccio, Milton or Ariosto, Dante did not really become an author read all over Europe until the Romantic era. To the Romantics, Dante, like Homer and Shakespeare, was a prime example of the \"original genius\" who sets his own rules, creates persons of overpowering stature and depth, and goes far beyond any imitation of the patterns of earlier masters; and who, in turn, cannot truly be imitated. Throughout the 19th century, Dante's reputation grew and solidified; and by 1865, the 600th anniversary of his birth, he had become established as one of the greatest literary icons of the Western world.\nNew readers often wonder how such a serious work may be called a \"comedy\". In the classical sense the word \"comedy\" refers to works which reflect belief in an ordered universe, in which events tend toward not only a happy or amusing ending but one influenced by a Providential will that orders all things to an ultimate good. By this meaning of the word, as Dante himself wrote in a letter to Cangrande I della Scala, the progression of the pilgrimage from Hell to Paradise is the paradigmatic expression of comedy, since the work begins with the pilgrim's moral confusion and ends with the vision of God.\nDante's other works include \"Convivio\" (\"The Banquet\"), a collection of his longest poems with an (unfinished) allegorical commentary; \"De Monarchia\", a summary treatise of political philosophy in Latin which was condemned and burned after Dante's death by the Papal Legate Bertrando del Poggetto, which argues for the necessity of a universal or global monarchy in order to establish universal peace in this life, and this monarchy's relationship to the Roman Catholic Church as guide to eternal peace; \"De vulgari eloquentia\" (\"On the Eloquence of Vernacular\"), on vernacular literature, partly inspired by the \"Razos de trobar\" of Raimon Vidal de Bezaudun; and \"La Vita Nuova\" (\"The New Life\"), the story of his love for Beatrice Portinari, who also served as the ultimate symbol of salvation in the \"Comedy\". The \"Vita Nuova\" contains many of Dante's love poems in Tuscan, which was not unprecedented; the vernacular had been regularly used for lyric works before, during all the thirteenth century. However, Dante's commentary on his own work is also in the vernacular—both in the \"Vita Nuova\" and in the \"Convivio\"—instead of the Latin that was almost universally used. \n\n"}

In 1961, Eaton returned to Washington, D.C. as the Methodist chaplain for Howard University, where he later served as registrar.\n\nIn 1969, Eaton became the minister of All Souls Church, which then had a primarily white congregation, although the neighborhood was becoming predominantly black. Eaton was not only the first black minister at All Souls but of any large UU church. Eaton was a close advisor to Washington mayor Marion Barry, one of the church's congregants.\n\nOne of Eaton's first sermons, a May 1970 critique of Nixon legislation that would allow police to invade homes without knocking, stoked widespread controversy. The sermon, entitled \"Take the Blindfold Off the Lady: The D.C. Crime Bill,\" included the line: \"If this legislation is passed, I suggest to you and instruct myself . . . [that] any time persons break into your house unannounced, shoot them!\" He went on: \"In order to understand true morality, one must understand that oppression must be stopped at all cost.\"\n\nEaton was a long-time at-large member of the District of Columbia State Board of Education, serving from 1981 until his death. He served as the school board president from 1982 to 1985.\n\nIn 1964, Eaton founded the Washington Institute for Employment Training, which became the local branch of the Opportunities Industrialization Center.\n\nIn 1968, Eaton joined the faculty of Federal City College as associate dean of community education and assistant professor of philosophy.

The \"Devīmāhātmyam\", in turn, forms a part of the \"Sāvarṇikamanvantara\" Section (सावर्णिकमन्वन्तर, Chapters 77 - 90) of the \"Mārkaṃḍeyapurāṇa\" (मार्कंडेयपुराण). \n\nThe \"Devīsūktam\" eulogises the manifold manifestations of the fierce goddess (\"Devī), Caṇḍī\" or \"Durgā\" (दुर्गा), in her objective and subjective aspects. This hymn is very popular and is chanted every day in the Devī temples across India, during the morning and evening ritual worship. It is specially recited during the \"Śarannavarātri\" festival which occurs in the Gregorian months of October - November; it is also recited during the \"Vasantanavarātri\".\n\nThis particular \"Devīsūktam\" belongs to the Puranic and Tantric traditions. It is different from, and should not be confused with, the \"Devīsūkta\" which occurs in the 10th mandala of the \"Ṛgveda\".\n\nThe Devīsūktam, as stated earlier, belongs to the 5th Chapter of the Devīmāhātmyam. In the preceding (4th) chapter, the Devī, having slain the demon \"Mahiṣāsura\" (महिषासुर), assures the gods that she would help them if they come to distress in the future too. \n\nAfter some time, two \"asura\" (demon) brothers, Śuṃbha and Niśuṃbha terrorise the three worlds, usurp the offices and powers Sūrya, Caṃdra, Kubera, Yama, Varuṇa, Agni, Vāyu and other gods, and establish themselves in their steads. These gods, having been defeated and having lost their power, authority and honour, recall the assurance given by the Devī of alleviating them from their troubles. They decide to pray for her help, and arrive at the Himalayas. Having assembled there, they begin praising Her, who is also known as Aparājitā (अपराजिता) and Viṣṇumāyā (विष्णुमाया):\n\nदेवा ऊचुः ॥\n\nThe gods spake thus:\n\n\"namo devyai mahādevyai śivāyai satataṃ namaḥ\" ।\n\"namaḥ prakṛtyai bhadrāyai niyatāḥ praṇatāḥ sma tām\" ॥\n\n\"Our obeisances unto the Devī, the Great Goddess;

It is the largest mosque in the world by area. Also contained within the complex are the Goharshad Mosque, a museum, a library, four seminaries, a cemetery, the Razavi University of Islamic Sciences, a dining hall for pilgrims, vast prayer halls, and other buildings.\n\nThe complex is one of the tourism centers in Iran and has been described as \"the heart of the Shia Iran\" with 12 million Iranian and non-Iranian Shias visiting the shrine each year, according to a 2007 estimate. The complex is managed by Astan Quds Razavi Foundation currently headed by a prominent Iranian cleric, Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi.\n\nThe shrine itself covers an area of 267,079m while the seven courtyards which surround it cover an area of 331,578m - totaling .\n\nEvery year the ceremony of \"Dust Clearing\" is celebrated in the Imam Reza shrine.\n\nShia sources quote several hadiths from the Shia Imams and Prophet Muhammad that highlight the importance of pilgrimage to the shrine. A hadith from the Islamic Prophet reads: One of my own flesh and blood will be buried in the land of Khorasan. God the Highest will surely remove the sorrows of any sorrowful person who goes on pilgrimage to his shrine. God will surely forgive the sins of any sinful person who goes on pilgrimage to his shrine.\n\nDar-ul-Imarah (Royal Residence) or the garden of Humayd ibn Qahtaba al-Ta'i was a fortress in the village of Sanabad. It dates back to the era before the Islam religion. It had been placed at the fork road of Sanabad, Neishabour, Sarakhs, Toos and Radkan. In fact, this fortress has been a place for the frontier guards to take position and establish the security of these roads and regions. After the demise of Harun al-Rashid, he was buried in this place. Due to this historical event, the Dar-ul-Imarah was known as the Mausoleum of Haruniyyeh. The original inner building of Dar-ul-Imarah has been in fact a temple used by the Zoroastrians to worship. This building was demolished by the order of al-Ma'mun, and then it was reconstructed according to the special architecture of Khorasan. Four plain and short walls, covered with a low-slope dome, were constructed around the building. Afterwards, the name of the mausoleum (Haruniyyeh) was changed and known as the Mashhad-ur-Reza, due to the Holy Imam. Mashhad literally means a place where a martyr has been buried.\n\nIn 818, Imam Ali al-Ridha was murdered by the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun (ruled 813–833) and was buried beside the grave of al-Ma'mun's father, Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809). After this event, the location was called as Mashhad al-Ridha (\"the place of martyrdom of al-Ridha\"). Shias and Sunnis began visiting his grave on pilgrimage. By the end of the 9th century a dome was built on the grave and many buildings and bazaars sprang up around it. For the next thousand years, it has been devastated and reconstructed several times.\n\nThe celebrated Muslim traveler Ibn Battuta visited Mashhad in 1333 and reported that it was a large town with abundant fruit trees, streams and mills. A great dome of elegant construction surmounts the noble mausoleum, the walls being decorated with colored tiles. Opposite the tomb of the Imam is the tomb of Caliph Harun al-Rashid, which is surmounted by a platform bearing chandeliers. However, the tomb of Harun al-Rashid is not considered sacred, as he was responsible for the murders of the 6th and 7th Shia Imams.\n\nBy the end of the third Hijri century, a dome was built on the grave of Imam Reza and many buildings and bazaars sprang around the holy shrine. In 383 A.H. / 993 A.D., Sebuktigin, the Ghaznevid sultan devastated Mashhad and stopped the pilgrims from visiting the holy shrine of Imam Reza. But in 400 A.H./ 1009 A.D., Mahmud of Ghazni (born 971, ruled, 998-1030 A.D.,) started the expansion and renovation of the holy shrine and built many fortifications around the city.\n\nSultan Sanjar (b. 1086 A.D., r. 1097-1157 A.D.), after the miraculous healing of his son in the holy shrine of Imam Reza, renovated the sanctuary and added new buildings within its precincts. At the time of Sultan Sanjar Saljuqi, after Sharaf al-Din Abu Tahir b. Sa'd b. Ali Qummi repaired the shrine, he began to construct a dome over it. In 612 A.H./ 1215 A.D., as borne out by inscriptions on certain tiles, Allaudin Khwarezm Shah carried out renovations on the shrine.\n\nDuring Khwarazm-Shahs period, Razavi Shrine was paid much attention and some repairment and decoration were made in it. In this era(612/1215), two very glorious embossed Thuluth (a large Naskh handwriting) inscriptions in form of square tile work were fixed on both sides of the shrine entrance-by the side of Dar al-Huffaz porch—in which the names and descent of Imam Reza back to Imam Ali were written. Some other inscriptions and three mihrabs (a special place for prayer-leader in mosques) belonging to this age exist in this holy complex.\nDuring the Mongol invasion in 1220 AD (617 A.H.), Khorasan was plundered by the invading hordes and the survivors of this massacre took refuge in Mashhad and settled around the holy shrine. Sultan Muhammad Khudabandeh Iljaitu (b. 1282 AD), the Mongol ruler of Iran, converted to Shi'ism and ruled Iran in 703–716 A.H (1304–1316 AD), once again renovated the holy shrine on a grand scale.\n\nThe glorious phase of Mashhad started during the reign of Shahrukh Mirza (b. 1377 A.D., r, 1405-1447) son of Tamerlane and reached its zenith during the reign of Safavid kings who ruled Iran from 1501-1786 A.D. Shahrukh Mirza, whose capital was Herat, regularly visited Mashhad for the pilgrimage of the holy shrine of Imam Reza (A.S.). In the 15th century, during the reign of the Timurid Shahrukh Mirza, Masshad became one of the main cities of the realm. In 1418, his wife Empress Goharshad funded the construction of an outstanding mosque beside the shrine, which is known as the Goharshad Mosque.\n\nWith the emergence of the Safavid dynasty in 1501 A.D. and their declaration of the Shi'ite school as the state religion, Mashhad reached the peak of its development and soon became one of the greatest sites of pilgrimage. However, since Khorasan was a border province of the Safavid Empire, Mashhad consequently suffered repeated invasions and periods of occupation by the Uzbek Khans - Muhammad Khan, Abdullah Khan Shaibani, Muhammad Sultan and especially Abdul - Momen Khan. These invasions continued up to 996 A.H./ 1586 A.D., the time of Shah Abbas I, who finally drove out the Uzbeks from Khourasan.\n\nSahn Atiq was extended in the time of Shah Abbas I, and still, during the Safavids era, great efforts were made for its improvement. Shah Tahmasp I began to repair and gild the minaret near the dome and in 932/1525, precious tiles covering the dome were changed into gold-coated bricks. After they were plundered during Abd al-Mu'min Khan Uzbeg invasion, the gold-coated bricks were rebuilt by Shah 'Abbas in 1010/1601, the details of which was written on an enamelled inscription by Ali Reza Abbasi. Shah Abbas also began to establish northern porch, rooms, chambers, facades, as well eastern and western porches. It is said that Mullah Muhsin Fayd Kashani ordered to establish Tawhid Khanah portico in the north side of the Shrine. Allahverdikhan portico, porch in the north side of Dar al-Ziyafah (reception chamber) and Hatam Khani portico, all were built in the time of great princes of Safavids, Allahverdikhan and Hatam Beq Ordoobadi.\n\nShah Abbas II commanded to repair and tile Sahn Atiq and Shah Sulaiman also ordered the repair of the Holy Shrine Dome which had been split because of the earthquake; this can be read in an erected inscription. He also commanded to establish several Madrasahs (Islamic Seminaries). The northern porch of Goharshad Mosque, the Holy Shrine entrance, along with Musallah (place of prayer) located in Payeen Khiyaban (lower street) were repaired and tiled by a skillful Isfahani mason called Ustad Shuja'.\n\n \nNadir Shah Afshar (b. 1688, r. 1736-1747 A.D.) and the Qajar kings who ruled Iran from 1779-1923 illuminated, beautified and expanded the various courtyards (Sahn), porches (Riwaq) and places in the holy shrine. The golden porch of Sahn Atiq and the minaret on its top were repaired and gilded, the minaret of north porch was erected and illuminated; and Sangab (a vessel or container made of single block of marble) in Ismail Tala'ee Saqqa Khanah (a public place for drinking water) was built in Sahn Atiq. All these happened during Nadir Shah Afshar's monarchy.\n\nThere have also been some improvements in Holy Shrine complex during Qajar period, including new courtyard establishment and gilding its porch, both of them started in the time of Fath Ali Shah Qajar and ended in Nasir al-Din Shah's era. The porch and northern façade of Sahn Atiq, as written in the inscription of its top, were also repaired during Muhammad Shah's rule. Tawhid Khanah was repaired in 1276/1859 in the time of Adud al-Mulk's custodianship. He had the fine paintings and tiles of the Shrine decorated with mirrors in 1275/1858. Nasir al-Din Shah, too, had the gold-coated bricks put up on the walls, from dado up to the top of western proch of the new courtyard and its stalactite-shaped ceiling. So it was called \"Nasiri Porch\". There was also some repairment in both courtyards, the old and the new one during Muzaffar al-Din Shah's monarchy.\n\nFollowing the coup in December 1911, Russian artillery shelled revolutionaries that had taken refuge in the holy shrine. The whole complex was greatly damaged in 1911, but it was repaired again after a while by Hussein Mirza Nayyir al-Dawla, Khorasan's governor.\n\nThere happened some essential changes round the complex in 1347/1928, when Falakah (round open space with the radius of 180 meters from the top of the Dome was established. Then they began to build the Museum, the library and the Hall for ceremonies. Old Falakah was extended up to a radius of 620 meters before the victory of the Islamic Revolution, and an important part of Holy Buildings' historical structure was demolished without considering its antiquity and elegance.\n\nOn 11th Rabi al-Thani 1354 A.H. /13 July 1935, the armed forces of Reza Shah (b. 1878, r. 1925-1941 A.D.), the founder of Pahlavi dynasty in Iran, invaded the holy shrine and massacred people gathered in the Goharshad Mosque. The people there were protesting against the anti-Islamic rule of Reza Shah for banning Hijab (headscarf) for women in Iran. During the days of Islamic revolution, on 21 November 1978 Mohammad Reza Shah's (b. 1919, r. 1941-1978 A.D.) troops of the Shah killed a large number of people within the holy shrine of Imam Reza.\n\nThe shrine is depicted on the reverse of the Iranian 100 rials coin, issued since 2004.\n\nThe complex contains a total of Seven courtyards, which cover an area of over : The courtyards also contain a total of 14 minarets, and 3 fountains.\n\nFrom the courtyards, external hallways named after scholars lead to the inner areas of the mosque. They are referred to as \"Bast\" (\"Sanctuary\"), since they were meant to be a safeguard for the shrine areas:\n\n\nThe \"Bast\" hallways lead towards a total of 21 internal halls (Riwaq) which surround the burial chamber of Ali al-Ridha. Adjacent to the burial chamber is also a mosque dating back to the 10th century known as, Bala-e-Sar Mosque.\n\nThis mosque is one of the most reputed in Iran and is situated adjacent to the Holy Shrine of Imam Ridha. It was built in 821 AH. under the orders of Goharshad Begum, Shahrukh Mirza's wife. Its area is 9410 Sq Meters and includes a courtyard, four porches and seven large prayer halls. Two minarets, each 40 meters high, are located on both sides of Maqsureh Porch. There is an inscription on the left on the margin of the porch written by Baisonqor, one of the best calligraphists of the time. The Sahib-al Zaman Pulpit is in Maqsureh porch. It was built in 1243 H with walnut wood and without using any iron or nail. This mosque has a public library with 34,650 volumes.\n\nIt is located beneath the Golden Dome (The Golden Dome is the most prominent symbol of the city of Mashad with an altitude of 31.20 meters) and surrounded by different porches each bearing a separate name. The skilled artists have done their best in the creation of this place. It is square in shape and some 135 sq. meters have been added to its area after extension works. The walls are covered by marble up to twenty centimeters and the next ninety two centimeters are covered by expensive tiles known as Sultan Sanjari tiles. Quranic verses and Ahadiths of the Ahle Bait have been carved on these tiles. The important inscription written round the walls is eighty centimeters wide and written by Ali Ridha Abbasi, the famous calligraphist of the Safavid period and bears Surah Jumah of the Quran.\n\nThere are two Museums in the Holy shrine limits. Astan Quds Museum and Quran Museum.\nThe Astan Quds museum is one of the richest and most exquisite museums of Iran. The building is located in the eastern quarter of Sahne Imam Khomeini and close to Haram square. Some of its objects date back to the 6th century AH. The collection of carpets, rugs and golden covers for the Tomb are all unique and date back to the 11 and 13th centuries.Some inscriptions written by Ali Reza Abbasi are among the valuable objects. Among the unique works of art in the museum is Imam's first tombstone, the inscription of which was carved in kufi relief script belonging to 516 H.\nAlso Quran museum is located in the vicinity of the Astan Quds museum. It contains precious manuscripts of the Glorious Quran attributed to the Holy Imams and some gilded manuscripts. It was opened in 1364 H. The oldest manuscript attributed to the Holy Imams is in kufi script on deer skin belonging to the First century AH.\n\nBecause of historical background of Imam Reza shrine, it is collection of historical objects such as; Minarets,Nqqareh Khaneh (Place of Kettle Drums), Saqqa Khaneh (Public Drinking Place), Sa'at (the Clock),Dar-al Hoffaz (the place of the Reciters), Towhid Khaneh (place of Divine Unity),Dar-al-Siyadah, Bala-Sar Mosque, Dar-al Rahmah Porch, Allahverdi Khan Dome, Hatam Khani Dome, Golden Dome, Astan Quds Mehmansara.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Inocencio Junquera (Gran Canaria 1831 – Santillana del Mar, 1911) was a civil and political governor of Cebu, Philippines, from 1893 – 1895. He left a legacy to Cebuano culture by establishing the Teatro Junquera, the most important theater of Cebu in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nJunquera's governorship was marked by protests from the Spanish friars, who saw Junquera as a liberal because he supported separation of Church and State.\n\nIn 1894 the residents of the district of Parian (in what is now Cebu City) staged a Spanish play titled \"El Alcalde Interino\". The play was performed in the convent of the old church of Parian (destroyed in 1878 because of misunderstandings between the residents and the Spanish friar assigned to the parish). The special guest was Junquera.\n\nJunquera, who was also interested in the theater, commented that the convent is too small for a theater. He suggested to prominent residents Florentino Rallos and Francisco Sales that Cebu must have its own \"real\" theater and a Colegio de Artes y Oficios. After a few months, Junquera called for a meeting and discussed his plans to create a college with an attached theater in the same place were the old church of Parian was.\n\nBut Junquera was not popular with the friars, because of his support for church-state separation. His plans were blocked. When Martin Garcia Alcocer, the bishop of Cebu, knew the Junquera's plans, he immediately ordered the construction of a religious monument in the lot where the theater was to be constructed. He announced that the monument could not be removed because it has been blessed and therefore holy. The friars also spread rumors that Junquera would tax the residents to support his construction project. In the face of opposition, Junquera did not push through his plan for a theater in Parian.\n\nJunquera found a suitable place in barangay Kanipaan (now the commerce center of the city), the lot of Rafael Veloso. He used his own money to finance the project. Other prominent individuals helped. Marcelo Regner and Rafael de Ocampo designed the arabesque style; Francisco Sales recruited carpenters and painters for the project.\n\nThe theater was finished in 1895, a year before Junquera left Cebu. It was, not surprisingly, called Teatro Junquera. On December 16 of the same year, before Junquera left Cebu, a Spanish play was performed by the Cebuanos to honor him. However, the formal inauguration of the theater was on April 19, 1896.\n\nThe theater was later bought by Pedro Royo, a Spanish businessman and a filmmaker. Then it was bought by Leopold Falek and Pedro Rivera-Mir, and finally, by Don Jose Leon Avila (1884–1959), whose family still own the lot where the original theater was located. It was during Avila's ownership when the name was changed to Teatro/Cine Oriente. As years pass by, the Cebuanos stopped calling it Teatro/Cine Oriente but just Cine Oriente.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2442097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2442097", "title": "Jengu", "text": "Jengu\n\nA jengu (plural miengu) is a water spirit in the traditional beliefs of the Sawa ethnic groups of Cameroon, particularly the Duala, Bakweri, and related Sawa peoples. Among the Bakweri, the name is liengu (plural: maengu). Miengu are similar to Mami Wata spirits. \n\nThe miengus appearance differs from people to people, but they are typically said to be beautiful, mermaid-like figures with long hair and beautiful gap-teeth. They live in rivers and the sea and bring good fortune to those who worship them. They can also cure disease and act as intermediaries between worshippers and the world of spirits. For this reason, a jengu cult has long enjoyed popularity among the Duala peoples. Among the Bakweri, this cult is also an important part of a young girl's rite of passage into womanhood.\n\nJengu may refer to a single spirit, as well. In some traditions, this spirit replaces the class of miengu spirits, while in others, it acts as their leader. Among the Isubu, for example, this spirit is called Jengu.\n\nBakweri belief talks of a female spirit named Mojili or Mojele. Mojili became the progenitor of the miengu when she lost a bet with Moto, the ancestor of mankind, over who could build the longer-lasting fire. Moto won the right to stay in the village, but Mojili was forced to flee to the sea. The Bakweri still worship Mojili as the ruler of the miengu. In fact, her name is so powerful, that many believe that children under seven may die if they hear it uttered. By extension of this tale, the miengu are said to be the wives of the rats, as the ancestor of the rats also lost the bet and fled to the forest.\n\nAnother Bakweri tradition names this spirit Liengu la Mwanja and makes her the consort of Efasa-Moto, spirit of Mount Fako (Mount Cameroon). Long ago, the two formed an understanding that Efasa-Moto would live on the mountain, while Liengu la Mwanja would inhabit the sea. When lava from Mount Fako's 1992 eruption made it all the way to the ocean, many hailed it as a sign that the spirit was visiting his wife.\n\nThe Duala and related groups hold the jengu cult in high importance. The cult may have originated with peoples further west, possibly the Ijo, and then passed from people to people, reaching the Batanga at its most eastward extent. In the earliest days, jengu-worship centred on the water spirits as the source of four boons: crayfish, the end of the rainy season in one of the world's wettest regions, victory in the pirogue races, and protection from epidemics of disease. Among the Duala proper, membership was originally reserved to \"free\" (pure-blooded) Duala, a stipulation that even excluded members of the prestigious Akwa clan due to one of their ancestors being a Bassa woman. Observations by European traders and explorers prove that jengu-worship was well established by the early 19th century. Early missionaries largely failed in their attempts to suppress it.\n\nThe cult is still active in Cameroon's Littoral and Southwest Provinces. Both males and females are eligible to join, though this openness may be a fairly recent development. Jengu-worship is primarily male among the Duala proper, but among the Bakweri, on the other hand, the cult is primarily for women.\n\nJengu worship centres on a secret society led by an individual known as the \"ekale\". This person traditionally wears a mask at all meetings, though this practice all but died out by the mid-20th century. Anyone can supplicate the miengu, however, and the simplest rituals involve nothing more than prayers or sacrifices to the deities before fishing or traveling by water.\n\nEarly jengu worshippers performed rituals in pirogues on the Wouri River, its tributaries and estuary, and on nearby islands. The person would first dress in ceremonial garb, a cape, skirt, and headdress of raffia fronds, and carry palm fronds and wooden paddles. He would then summon the miengu and offer them oblations of food and drink. He might also visit a jengu shrine further up the Wouri.\n\nMuch jengu worship is related to healing and medicine, and the miengu are called upon when mainstream healing fails. For example, a jengu doctor can treat a patient by first sacrificing a cock and goat. He then administers a vomit-inducing medicine and waves a small stool over the patient's head. The one treated must then follow a series of taboos. Among the Bakweri, this rite is known as \"Liengu la Vafea\". \n\nThe highest-profile miengu ceremony today is the annual Ngondo celebration in Douala, first held in 1949. The night before the fête's culmination, members of the jengu cult hold a private ceremony at Jebale Island on the Wouri. There they sacrifice to the water spirits and prepare a package of gifts. The next day, this offering is presented to the miengu during a public ceremony on a beach near Douala. One cult member dives into the sea with the gift and stays down as long as possible. Afterward, he returns with a message from the miengu about the year to come.\n\nThe climax of the ngondo festival is the jengu cult. Wherein the traditional diver goes into the river under supervision of the traditional rulers. This undisclosed custodian of tradition, accompanied by a woman and two men, embarks on a ritual boat. He will then submerge himself in the middle of the river and stay underneath the water for three to ten minutes. It is believed that he visits the kingdom of their ancestors (spirits) beneath the waters. He returns with news of the successor of the ngondo presidency and a coded message from the gods of the land in a calabash. One mystery of this ritual is that the calabash, which the diver holds as he re-emerges from underneath the river, is dry.\n\nThe rites observed by the Bakweri people of Mount Cameroon serve as an example of similar rituals among other coastal groups. \n\nToward the coast, the Bakweri practice two major induction rituals. In the \"Liengu la Ndiva\", cult members take a seizure or collapse as a sign that a young girl is ready for induction. A cult member then speaks to her in a secret liengu language, and if she seems to understand any of it, a traditional healer begins the initiation rites. The girl must live in seclusion for several months, during which she must follow a strict set of taboos and may see visions of spirits. She also receives a secret name and teaching in the secret liengu language. Eventually, the healer releases her into the custody of a group of strong men and a number of women singing in the liengu language. The men take turns carrying her until she reaches the middle of a stream. There, the healer plunges her in, inducting her into the cult. Meanwhile, other cult members attempt to capture a crab from the waters, as this animal represents the liengu spirit. The new member's taboos remain, however, and she must live in seclusion for several more months. Finally, the cult holds a feast in her honour, and the initiation comes to an end. The entire process takes the better part of a year.\n\nAn alternate Bakweri initiation ritual is the \"Liengu la Mongbango\". If a young girl disappears into the bush, her female relatives try to track her down by singing to her in the liengu language and carrying cult insignia made of wicker. When they find her, they hide her away for several months (outsiders may visit, however). Afterward, the cult prepares a feast for the girl. She and her sponsor then go alone into the forest. The initiate dresses in traditional regalia of fern fronds and rubs her body with red camwood. She is then led back to the village tied to the middle of a long rope. Two groups play a tug of war over her until the rope breaks, and she collapses. The cult members call to her nine times in the liengu language, which causes her to stand back up. After a few more weeks of taboos, a traditional healer bathes her in a stream, and her initiation ends. This process also takes most of a year.\n\n"}

At the start of the series, she meets Bolin and Mako after arriving in Republic City, where she first experiences independence after living a secluded life of training, led by the Order of the White Lotus. The series' final scene, indicating the beginning of a romantic relationship between Korra and Asami Sato, was unprecedented in its LGBT representation in western children's television.\n\nAfter the death of Aang, Korra is born among the Southern Water Tribe, her bending abilities over Water, Earth and Fire manifesting by age 4.\n\nKorra, now seventeen, and having mastered three of the elements, needs to learn airbending from the only living airbending master, Aang's son, Tenzin. Korra moves to Republic City to go after him following a brief encounter with , being taken in by Tenzin and meeting both Mako and Bolin before joining their pro-bending team. After saving Bolin and having her first sighting of Amon, Korra's romantic struggles lead to difficulty with the pro-bending team, which the group recovers from to successfully win their match and make it to the finals, where they are defeated and Amon strikes with his group of followers, the Equalists. Korra afterward discovers Hiroshi Sato's ties to the Equalists, then allowing Asami Sato, Bolin and Mako to live with her, forming a team with the group that Councilman Tarrlok breaks up by arresting the others and revealing himself as a bloodbender in an encounter with Korra where he subdues her. She is locked in a secluded cabin that holds her for a short time before she breaks out once it is ambushed by Amon and his Equalists, the group launching an assault on Republic City that Korra and the others are overpowered in, forcing them to retreat until General Iroh and the United Forces come to the city as reinforcements, who are also overwhelmed. Following saving Tenzin and his children and seemingly losing her bending of three of the elements to Amon, Korra engages in a battle with Amon where she emerges victorious thanks to her airbending, having the other elements restored by Aang and in doing so gaining the power to restore bending as well.\n\nIn \"\", taking place six months after the Anti-bending Revolution, Korra learns from her uncle Unalaq of her seclusion being set by both Tenzin and her father, causing her to break off with Tenzin and have Unalaq become her mentor. During her training, Korra has to mend fences between both factions of the Water Tribe and after learning that her father had nothing to do with an attempted kidnapping of Unalaq, she participates in freeing him. Her actions prompt a civil war between the Southern and Northern Water Tribes, Korra afterward making a move to have General Iroh's assistance without President Raiko's authority, which Mako reveals to Raiko. Korra loses consciousness after an attack by her cousins Desna and Eska and a dark spirit swallowing her. She was left without her memory, learning the origins of Wan, the first Avatar, and entering the Spirit World to prevent Vaatu's escape with the aid of Jinora. After the two are separated, Korra reverts to her child self and meets Iroh, then meets her again before opening the Northern spirit portal per Unalaq's request in exchange for Jinora's soul not being destroyed by him. Korra escapes but is unable to bring Jinora with her, returning to the physical world where she makes plans to counter Unalaq, engaging him in battle where she is not only bested, but has her connections to her past lives disconnected with the destruction of the Light Spirit. In another confrontation not long after, Korra destroys Unalaq by purifying him, ending the Civil War and ushering the coexistence of humans and spirits.\n\nTwo weeks later, marking the beginning of \"Book Three: Change\", Korra leaves Republic City to offer training to new airbenders across the Earth Kingdom after further straining her relations with President Raiko, recruiting Kai and freeing airbenders who Earth Queen Hou-Ting had been training underground to join her army. She traveled to Zaofu next, meeting Suyin Beifong, who taught her metalbending, nearly being kidnapped after by Zaheer, Ghazan, P'Li and Ming-Hua though she is saved by her allies. With it being discovered Aiwei was part of the conspiracy to kidnap her, Korra sets out to find him, staking out his room and entering the Spirit World after him, where she learns Zaheer and his followers are part of the Red Lotus from the latter. Though managing to escape the Red Lotus, she is captured by Earth Kingdom soldiers, the Earth Queen having declared Korra an enemy. Korra and Asami succeed in escaping, but Korra is forced to give herself up so Zaheer will not harm the captive airbenders. Zaheer double-crosses Korra, taking her unconscious body with him, poisoning her with mercury so she can enter the Avatar State and be killed in it to end the Avatar Cycle. She breaks free and is able to combat Zaheer while battling the poison, though succumbs to it before Suyin bends it out of her, Korra being left in a fragile emotional state and being confined to a wheelchair as well.\n\nIn the final season, \"Book Four: Balance\", Korra returns to the Southern Water Tribe to recuperate under Katara's care for two-and-a-half years, regaining her ability to walk but losing her ability to enter the Avatar State. She then travels the world though is haunted by a spirit of herself, even losing to it in battle. With the help of Toph Beifong, she removed the mercury from her body and reconnected with the world. Initially planning to reach a peace agreement with Kuvira, Korra duels her and loses her advantage when being haunted once more, being saved by Jinora and Opal. She is then reunited with Asami and Mako when they as a group of three are successful in recovering a kidnapped Prince Wu, though Korra soon begins doubting her effectiveness as Avatar prior to Asami and Tenzin encouraging her. Korra has a reunion with Zaheer who aids her in rescuing trapped souls in the Spirit World, preparing afterward for a showdown with Kuvira by requesting the aid of spirits in the conflict and tries to interrogate Baatar Jr., Kuvira's fiancé, nearly being killed when the Future Industries factory they are in is destroyed by Kuvira. After convincing Kuvira to surrender following showing sympathy with her motivations, she begins a romantic relationship with Asami.\n\nIn \"\" part one, Korra and Asami spend time in the Spirit World exploring their romantic feelings for each other. The pair travel to the Southern Water Tribe to reveal their relationship to Korra's parents. Upon returning to Republic City, Korra attempts to stop tycoon Wongyong Keum's plans to form an amusement park on the land surrounding the Spirit Portal, which has angered the spirits. Korra also tries to reassure and help the people whose homes were destroyed during Kuvira's assault. Korra helps the Air Nomads when the Triple Threat triad, on Keum's orders, attempt to drive them away from the Spirit Portal. Korra tries to convince the spirits to stay out of the battle, but is distracted when Asami is nearly killed in the fighting, allowing the dragon-eel spirit to attack the Triple Threat's new leader, Tokuga. Three weeks after Tokuga was defeated, Korra confessed to Asami that she is in love with her, to which Asami said she feels the same way.\n\nKorra is featured in \"The Legend of Korra\" video game, which takes place in between the second and third seasons of the series. She has her bending abilities taken away from her at the beginning of the game and she has to regain them as it progresses. She is the only \"The Legend of Korra\" character, besides Naga and Jinora, to make an appearance in the game's story mode, which earned it criticism.\n\nIn March 2015, Bryan Konietzko posted artwork of Korra and Asami embracing, entitled \"Turtle-duck Date Night\". The art was announced to be sold as an exclusive print for \"The Legend of Korra / Avatar: The Last Airbender Tribute Exhibition\" at Gallery Nucleus with its proceeds donated by Konietzko to a LGBTQ suicide prevention hotline. After same-sex marriage was declared legal in all 50 states of the U.S., Konietzko posted a rainbow version of the artwork. Korra and her predecessor Aang will be featured on a print available for attendees of the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con.\n\nKorra appears in \"The Legend of Korra\" books \"Revolution\" and \"Endgame\", two novels that together adapt the first season of the series.\n\nBryan Konietzko's interest in martial arts influenced him to draw inspirations from various female MMA fighters for the design of Korra's character, one inspiration being Gina Carano. In addition, she was indirectly inspired by one of Bryan Konietzko's sisters. Korra was also designed to be an inversion of Aang, the title character of the preceding story \"\". Instead of the young, spiritual Aang, Korra is a more physical character who has trouble grasping the spiritual side of being the Avatar while being able to already bend three elements at the age of four. In contrast, Aang takes a while to master each of the elements, but connects with the spirit world instantaneously. Korra's name was settled long after her character was imagined. Konietzko and DiMartino couldn't agree to a name for her until they learned \"Cora\", the name of a hotel operator's dog. The name was kept, and only changed in spelling.\n\nThe creators felt the second season was built around Korra becoming more in-tuned with her spiritual side, reinforcing their belief that a giant spirit version of herself would be the \"ultimate manifestation\". DiMantino wrote that Korra's lack of usage of the Avatar State during the third season was purposefully done to show her connection with Raava as being full-fledged, her developed understanding that type of power should be reserved for the \"most extreme circumstances.\"\n\nAlong with Asami Sato, Korra is half of the first major acknowledged LGBT couple in western children's animation. Regarding Korra's bisexuality, Konietzko admitted that the idea of a romantic relationship between Korra and Asami had been discussed by the creators during production of season one, but had not been given much weight due to assumptions that the show would not be permitted to openly depict a same-sex relationship. As development of the last two seasons went on and Korra and Asami’s friendship progressed, \"the more the idea of a romance between them organically blossomed for [the creators],\" and so the show started hinting at the possibility of such a relationship. In the end, Konietzko and DiMartino chose to openly depict Korra and Asami's relationship in the series finale because they didn't want to regret not doing so after the series ended. While still having limits on what could be shown, Nickelodeon was supportive of the relationship when approached.\n\nBefore drawing the character, Konietzko and DiMartino discussed her athleticism and physicality which factored into the earliest illustrations of Korra. It took the pair and Joaquim Dos Santos's combined efforts to finalize her character design. In the pilot (2012) episode \"Welcome to Republic City\", Korra is introduced as a teenager wearing Fire Nation attire over her traditional Water Tribe garb. She is briefly seen wearing it again during a flashback in the fourth season. Konietzko thought it was \"fun to play with\" the familiar Water Tribe outfit. After her defeat of Amon, she underwent an outfit change, gaining an asymmetrical top and sleeves.\n\nKorra for the first three seasons is depicted with long hair that is usually kept in a ponytail, though she has it down on several occasions such as when attending festivities, while entering the Avatar State by the Red Lotus and during her battle with Zaheer shortly afterward. Korra is so rarely seen with her hair down that DiMartino wrote that whenever the character had her hair down, \"you know something bad has happened.\" She maintains the hairstyle for the next three years as she recovers until shortly after regaining her mobility, at which point she cuts it. The hairstyle change was revealed in September 2014 by Konietzko, who wrote that the character was returning to her roots by sporting a bob cut similar to the one she was given by Dos Santos in his original concept for her, Konietzko adding that the alteration was carrying on a tradition in the \"Avatar\" franchise to have hairstyle changes over the course of a series. Korra's initial clothing in the fourth season is purposely designed to mirror that of her Water Tribe attire in the previous seasons, consisting of a sleeveless shirt and baggy pants, DiMartino finding it paramount that it resemble her prior clothing due to the duration for which she wore it. Korra gains another outfit midway through the fourth season. This outfit's boots are based on an existing pair of faux suede flat winter buckle boots.\n\nKorra is voiced by Janet Varney. Varney stated that she loved the character, describing her as being \"complicated\" while reasoning that this was due to her age and responsibilities and summarized her experience voicing Korra as having been \"such a privilege to be a part of\". Varney understood the criticism of her character and felt it was one of the compelling aspects of the series, as Korra was someone that \"you're not always looking up to\" and mentioned Superman while saying that a character is more interesting to her when they are flawed. Responding to being questioned about negative reception for the series in general, Varney admitted to preferring to live in a world of \"unicorns and rainbows\" and only pay attention to the positive feedback she received since she believed she would not \"do a better job on the show if my feelings are crushed by someone who’s just angry at me for no reason.\" Friends with Grey DeLisle, who voiced Azula in the original series \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\", Varney remembered her advice about the fandom where DeLisle told her to be ready for her \"life to change.\"\n\nUnlike her predecessor Aang, Korra is described by her creators as \"very tough, very headstrong, and not scared to get into a fight.\" Although she is talented, her stubborn and hot-headed personality prevents her from easily learning airbending or connecting with the Spirit World. The Avatar traditionally has the greatest difficulty mastering the element diametrically opposed to the Avatar's personality. For instance, Avatar Roku - a firebender - took longer to learn waterbending and Aang - an airbender - took longer to learn earthbending. The waterbender Korra, on the other hand, had little difficulty with firebending but had considerable trouble with airbending, a situation noted to be spiritual and not elemental.\n\nHer best friend and animal guide is a polar bear-dog named Naga, whose strength helps Korra out of many dangerous situations. Although wild polar bear dogs were originally feared and hunted by Water Tribes, Korra is the first person to ever tame one. Korra is good friends with her pro-bending teammates, the brothers Mako (her romantic interest in seasons 1 and 2) and Bolin. She also develops a strong friendship, and later romance, with Asami Sato, a wealthy industrialist. Korra has strong relationships with the family of her previous life: Having learned waterbending from Katara and then airbending from Tenzin, Tenzin's children look up to her as an older sister, and Kya and Bumi regard her as a friend. Korra is generally on good terms with her own parents, but has little contact with her uncle or cousins, whom she considers weird (and her father considers dangerous). Korra is unusual amongst her past lives in that she is technically royalty: her father Tonraq was in line to be the chief of the Northern Water Tribe before being banished and relocating to the South.\n\nKorra's character develops and matures during episodes 11 through 12 of the first season when she is confronted with detachment from her main three bending skills, leaving her only with airbending, which she had unlocked to save Mako from Amon. Later, she connects to her spiritual self through Aang. Once the connection to her Avatar predecessors is established, Aang is able to bestow energybending upon Korra (as well as her main three bending skills lost earlier). Although Korra is able to bend all four elements, while being capable of entering the Avatar State, Korra is still in the process of perfecting her airbending skills as well as having a true connection and understanding of her spiritual self to complete her training as a fully realized Avatar. Combined with the events of seasons 2 and 3 placing her in life and death situations, the former having her no longer able to contact her past lives for advice, Korra begins to suffer post traumatic stress by the events of \"Book Four: Balance\" while doubting her abilities as the Avatar to maintain balance after those she faced have each disrupted the order she was struggling to protect in massive ways. But ultimately, once able to let go of the pain she went through and realizing the significance to her past suffering, Korra returns to her usual self while becoming a more compassionate person from her ordeals.\n\nKorra has impeccable athleticism and acrobatics, shown being capable of simultaneously lifting Tenzin and his children with relative ease. She has surprising speed that go along with her agility and reflexes, which make her a skilled combatant in and of themselves. Her physical strength and stamina makes her capable of swimming across large bodies of water for days, or lift and throw significantly larger opponents. She can punch with enough force to break iron pipes or shatter large chunks of ice launched at her. Her dexterity and balance allows her to skillfully dodge a large barrage of projectiles and easily leap across long distances and over high obstacles from a stationary position. She is shown to be quite flexible, able to bend and twist effectively enough to attack from various angles or squeeze through tight spaces.\nAs the Avatar, Korra is capable of bending all four elements (air, water, earth and fire). The series' creators consulted a professional martial artist in the design of the show's fighting style. At the start of the series, Korra is proficient in water, earth and fire, having been able to bend them with ease since she was a young child, but struggles with airbending due to the difficulties of embracing her spiritual side. She uses all elements equally as much but each one for different strategies: airbending mostly for non-lethal purposes, such as gliding and evasive manoeuvres; waterbending for both defensive and offensive manoeuvres; earthbending for strong attacks. She learned metalbending being the first metalbending Avatar. She also tends to use firebending when she is angered or acts with hostility towards an opponent, as she demonstrated when threatening the Red Lotus when expressing outrage with Zaheer for apparently murdering her father.\n\nAfter learning energybending following her defeat of Amon, she becomes capable of restoring bending to those who had lost their abilities thanks to his actions. Korra became the second known Avatar to possess the capability. Her duties as Avatar and her personal feelings towards people did come into play with the restoring power, as she did not grant bending abilities back to individuals with backgrounds in crime. She is able to use energybending to connect with her inner spirit and gain cosmic energy from the universe.\n\nAs the Avatar, Korra is as a bridge between \"Material World\" and the \"Spirit World\", the plane of existence where the universe's disembodied spirits dwell. As her training under Tenzin progressed, she had slowly reconnected with her spirituality, seeing visions and accessing various memories from her past lives. Korra is able to purify \"dark spirits\" by balancing the energy within them. Following the events of the Harmonic Convergence in 171 AG, Korra lost her connection to her past lives by being temporarily separated from Raava, who was destroyed. Due to some residual traces of mercury in her body after her battle with Zaheer, Korra lost the ability to contact Raava and was unable to enter the Avatar State for three years.\n\nHer most powerful ability is the Avatar State, which allows her to access bending techniques she would not have learned during her own lifetime but throughout that of her predecessors. In addition, she also receives a massive boost in raw power, enabling her to easily overcome any opponent that tries to fight her head on. The form is activated by Korra being in a predicament that she will either not be able to combat with her current skills or when her life is in mortal danger. While speaking in the Avatar State, Korra's voice becomes in-sync with that of Raava's as a testament to their connection. Her weaknesses in the state is that she vulnerable, and if killed, then this would cause the Avatar to cease being reincarnated.\n\nKorra has been widely praised as a realistic, well-developed and sophisticated character by critics and viewers alike. Her position as a female protagonist, unusual for American animation, caused Nickelodeon to originally suspend production on the series. According to co-creator Bryan Koniezko, this was because the executives believed that \"girls will watch shows about boys, but boys won't watch shows about girls\". Production resumed when \"Korra\" test screened well, in particular with young boys.\n\nCommon Sense Media praised Korra as a good role model, citing her dedication to her goals and open-mindedness towards new ideas.\n\nNoel Kirkpatrick felt the character had become unlikeable during the second season, though applauded the show for putting her at the center of its narrative as we saw the character \"without a moderating influence, like Tenzin\".\n\nKorra's experience with post traumatic stress disorder during Book Four has been highly praised as a realistic approach to the subject. Max Nicholson of IGN wrote that it was \"heartbreaking\" to see Korra following her battle with Zaheer \"in such a vulnerable, weakened state.\" Janet Varney's acting received particular praise, with \"The A.V. Club\" describing it as \"an exceptional performance that fully captures the Avatar's pain, fear, and sadness. [Varney's] voice work is essential to bringing a sense of reality to Korra's struggle\".\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the series, Zach Blumenfeld of \"Paste\" ranked Korra as the second-best character from the \"Avatar\" universe, concluding that Korra was more interesting, relatable and inspiring that her predecessor, Avatar Aang. ScreenRant ranked Korra #8 on its \"30 Best Animated TV Characters Of All Time\" list.\n\nKorra's position as a bisexual protagonist, as well as her eventual relationship with Asami Sato have been the subject of many very positive reviews from the media. In light of the finale, \"Vanity Fair\" called the show \"one of the most powerful, subversive shows of 2014\", saying that the show \"challenged expectations and bravely explored content outside the scope of children’s television\". \"IGN\" commended the action-packed and emotional finale, noting that ending was one that \"fans will be talking about for a long time\". \"Forbes\" predicted that, in the future, Korra holding Asami's hand and leaping into the Spirit World \"will become one of the hallmarks of this series\". Megan Farokhmanesh of \"Polygon\" wrote that by portraying Korra and Asami as bisexual, the series even avoided the error of assuming sexual orientation, as many other TV series did, to be a strict divide between \"gay\" and \"straight\". Reviewers have noted that the two characters complement each other well as a couple, with Korra's brashness balancing Asami's levelheadedness.\n\nKorra and Asami's relationship has also been noted for being a \"landmark moment for American and family animation.\" \"The Advocate\" included Korra and Asami in their 2017 list of \"35 LGBT Characters Who Redefined Family TV\", noting that the series \"ended on a note that changed family television forever.\" In 2018, \"io9\" ranked the series finale's reveal of Korra and Asami's relationship #55 on its list of \"The 100 Most Important Pop Culture Moments of the Last 10 Years\".\n\nAmong the critics who viewed the pairing negatively, E. Steven Burnett of \"Christ and Pop Culture\" wrote that the depiction of a same-sex relationship \"hijacks Korra’s story in service of social causes to the detriment of its own creative storytelling.\" Daniel Rodrigues-Martin of \"Geeks Under Grace\" agreed that the pairing was a detriment to the characters and the story, opining that there was no foreshadowing of a romantic relationship between the two characters until the series' final moments.\n\nIn response to criticism that Korra and Asami's relationship was thrown in to appeal to fans who \"shipped\" the two of them together, Konietzko pointed out that any decision they made regarding Korra's romantic life could be interpreted as caving to a specific group of fans who supported Korra being paired with a certain character, and claimed that at the end of the day, the creators went for the relationship that felt right to them. He also suggested that anyone who felt the relationship was not adequately foreshadowed had watched the last two seasons only expecting to see heterosexual relationships.\n\n"}

{"id": "1399150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1399150", "title": "Martin Nodell", "text": "Martin Nodell\n\nMartin Nodell (November 15, 1915 – December 9, 2006) was an American cartoonist and commercial artist, best known as the creator of the Golden Age superhero Green Lantern. Some of his work appeared under the pen name \"Mart Dellon.\"\n\nBorn in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Nodell was the son of Jewish immigrants. He attended the Art Institute of Chicago. He moved to New York City in the 1930s, where he attended Pratt Institute.\n\nNodell began his illustrating career in 1938, working first as a freelancer. In 1940 he provided some work for Sheldon Mayer, an editor at All-American Publications, one of three companies that ultimately merged to form National Comics Publications (present-day DC Comics). Interested in gaining more steady employment, Nodell created designs for a new character that would become the Golden Age Green Lantern (Alan Scott). The inspiration came in January 1940 at the 34th Street subway station in Manhattan. Nodell noticed a trainman waving a lantern along the darkened tracks. He coupled the imagery with elements from Richard Wagner's operatic Ring cycle as well as Chinese folklore and Greek mythology to create the hero.\n\nAs Nodell himself described in 2000:\nThe first adventure, drawn by Nodell (as Mart Dellon) and written by Bill Finger, appeared in \"All-American Comics\" #16 (July 1940). Nodell continued to use the pseudonym through at least \"All Star Comics\" #2 (Fall 1940). He said in 2000 he had used the pen name since, \"Comics were a forbidden literature, culturally unacceptable. It wasn't something you were proud of\". Nodell penciled and virtually always self-inked Green Lantern stories in \"All-American\" and \"All Star\" until the character got his own title, the premiere issue cover-dated July 1941. He would continue with it through to #25 (May 1947), very rarely drawing the covers, before being succeeded by a variety of artists including Howard Purcell, Irwin Hasen, and Alex Toth.\n\nNodell left All-American in 1947 and joined Timely Comics, the 1930s–40s forerunner of Marvel Comics), where he drew postwar stories of Captain America, the Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner. His work there was rarely signed, making idenfication difficult, though comics historians have confirmed that Nodell drew two well-known covers: The first issue of \"Marvel Tales\", Timely's horror-comics revamp of the company's flagship series \"Marvel Mystery Comics\"; and the penultimate issue (#74) of Captain America's book, which for its last two issues became the horror-oriented \"Captain America's Weird Tales\".\n\nIn 1950, Nodell left comics to work in advertising and later joined the Leo Burnett Agency in Chicago as an art director. In 1965, his design team there developed the long-running flour-company mascot the Pillsbury Doughboy.\n\nHis only known comics work in the interim are penciling the story \"The Glistening Death\" in the Avon Comics one-shot \"City of the Living Dead\" (1952), reprinted two decades later in the Skywald horror-comics magazine \"Psycho\" #1 (Jan. 1971); and \"Master of the Dead\" in Avon's \"Eerie\" (1951 series) #14, reprinted in Skywald's \"Nightmare\" #1 (Dec. 1970).\nIn the 1980s, Nodell submitted new work to DC, which led to his being rediscovered by comic fans. His first pieces included a 13-page puzzle-and-activity section in \"Super Friends Special\" #1 (1981), and drawing the Golden Age Harlequin in \"Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe\" #10 (Dec. 1985). His final two published pieces of Green Lantern art were a one-page illustration of Golden Age Alan Scott Green Lantern in the 50th-anniversary issue \"Green Lantern\" vol. 3, #19 (Dec. 1991) and a one-page illustration of the Alan Scott Green Lantern and Superman in the one-shot \"Superman: The Man of Steel Gallery\" #1 (Dec. 1995). At 80, Nodell penciled his final comic-book work, the whimsical, 10-page Harlan Ellison adaptation \"Gnomebody\", scripted by John Ostrander and Ellison and inked by Jed Hotchkiss, in Dark Horse Comics' \"Harlan Ellison's Dream Corridor Quarterly\" #1 (Aug. 1996).\n\nNodell met his future wife, Carrie, at Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, in September 1940. They were married December 1, 1941, and afterward moved to Huntington, Long Island, to move in with Nodell's brother Simon, an engineer at Republic Aviation. They lived there two years before moving back to Brooklyn, New York City. The couple were living in West Palm Beach, Florida, by 2000. Nodell died December 9, 2006, in a nursing home in Muskego, Wisconsin, of natural causes, almost one month past his 91st birthday. They had two sons: Spencer, who lived in Waukesha, Wisconsin at the time of his father's death, and Mitchell.\n\nIn 2011, Nodell was nominated as a Judges' Choice for The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame.\n\n"}
{"id": "4804361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4804361", "title": "Octave (liturgy)", "text": "Octave (liturgy)\n\n\"Octave\" has two senses in Christian liturgical usage. In the first sense, it is the eighth day after a feast, reckoning inclusively, and so always falls on the same day of the week as the feast itself. The word is derived from Latin \"octava\" (eighth), with \"dies\" (day) understood. In the second sense, the term is applied to the whole period of these eight days, during which certain major feasts came to be observed.\n\nOctaves, not being successive, are quite distinct from eight-day weeks and simply refer to the return of the same day of a seven-day week in the inclusive counting system used in Latin (just as the ninth day was a return to the same day of a nundinal cycle, the eight-day week of the pre-Christian Roman calendar).\n\nThe \"eighth day\" or \"octava dies\" was associated with the weekly Christian celebration of the resurrection of Christ every \"eighth day\", which became a name for Sunday.\n\nAs circumcision was performed on the \"eighth day\" after birth, the number 8 became associated also with baptism, and baptismal fonts have from an early date often been octagonal.\n\nThe practice of octaves was first introduced under Constantine I, when the dedication festivities of the basilicas at Jerusalem and Tyre, Lebanon were observed for eight days. \nAfter these one-off occasions, annual liturgical feasts began to be dignified with an octave. \nThe first such feasts were Easter, Pentecost, and, in the East, Epiphany. This occurred in the fourth century and served as a period of time for the newly baptized to take a joyful retreat.\n\nThe development of octaves occurred slowly. From the 4th century to the 7th century, Christians observed octaves with a celebration on the eighth day, with little development of the liturgies of the intervening days. Christmas was the next feast to receive an octave. By the 8th century, Rome had developed liturgical octaves not only for Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas, but also for the Epiphany and the feast of the dedication of a church. From the seventh century, saints' feasts also began to have octaves (an eighth-day feast, not eight days of feasts), among the oldest being the feasts of Saints Peter and Paul, Saint Lawrence and Saint Agnes. From the twelfth century, the custom developed of liturgical observance of the days between the first and the eighth day, as well as the eighth day. During the Middle Ages, octaves for various other feasts and saints were celebrated depending upon the diocese or religious order.\n\nAfter 1568, when Pope Pius V reduced the number of octaves, they were still numerous. Not only on the eighth day from the feast but on all the intervening days, the liturgy was the same as on the feast itself, with exactly the same prayers and Scripture readings. Octaves were classified into several types. Easter and Pentecost had \"specially privileged\" octaves, during which no other feast whatsoever could be celebrated. Christmas, Epiphany, and Corpus Christi had \"privileged\" octaves, during which certain highly ranked feasts might be celebrated. The octaves of other feasts allowed even more feasts to be celebrated.\n\nTo reduce the repetition of the same liturgy for several days, Pope Leo XIII and Pope Pius X made further distinctions, classifying octaves into three primary types: privileged octaves, common octaves, and simple octaves. Privileged octaves were further arranged in a hierarchy of first, second, and third orders. For the first half of the 20th century, octaves were ranked in the following manner, which affected holding other celebrations within their timeframes:\n\n\nIn addition to these, the patron saint of a particular nation, diocese, or church was celebrated with an octave, on each day of which the Mass and Office of the feast was repeated, unless impeded by another celebration.\n\nAlthough the feasts of St. Lawrence and the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary officially still had simple octaves, by the 20th century they had all but vanished as higher-ranking feasts were added to the calendar. The octave day alone of St. Lawrence was still commemorated during the mass of St. Hyacinth. The entire octave of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary was impeded, but The Most Holy Name of Mary was celebrated during the octave and The Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary was celebrated on the former octave day.\n\nPope Pius XII simplified the calendar with a decree dated 23 March 1955: only the octaves of Christmas, Easter and Pentecost were kept, octaves that differed from the others in not repeating the same liturgy daily. All other octaves in the Roman Rite were suppressed, including those in local calendars. (See General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII#Octaves.) In 1969 the Roman Catholic Church further revised the Roman Calendar by removing the octave of Pentecost.\n\nThe first eight days of the Easter Season make up the octave of Easter and are celebrated as solemnities of the Lord, with proper readings and prayers. Since 30 April 2000, the \"Second Sunday of Easter\", which concludes the Easter Octave, has also been called Divine Mercy Sunday.\n\nThe Christmas Octave is arranged as follows:\n\nAmong the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic Churches, what in the West would be called an Octave is referred to as an Afterfeast. The celebration of the Great Feasts of the church year are extended for a number days, depending upon the particular Feast. Each day of an Afterfeast will have particular hymns assigned to it, continuing the theme of the Feast being celebrated.\n\nMost of these Great Feasts also have a day or more of preparation called a Forefeast (those Feasts that are on the moveable Paschal Cycle do not have Forefeasts). Forefeasts and Afterfeasts will affect the structure of the services during the Canonical Hours.\n\nThe last day of an Afterfeast is called the Apodosis (lit. \"giving-back\") of the Feast. On the Apodosis, most of the hymns that were chanted on the first day of the Feast are repeated. On the Apodosis of Feasts of the Theotokos, the Epistle and Gospel of the Feast are repeated again at the Divine Liturgy.\n\nThe term \"octave\" is applied to some church observances that are not strictly liturgical. For example, many churches observe an annual \"Octave of Prayer for Christian Unity\", which runs from 18 January to 25 January. The octave was established in 1895 by Pope Leo XIII for the period between Ascension and Pentecost. In 1909, Pope Pius X approved the transfer of this octave to the period between the former feast of the Chair of St. Peter and the feast of the Conversion of St. Paul. In 1968, the World Council of Churches and the Vatican's Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity agreed to jointly publish prayer materials for the occasion under the title \"Week of Prayer for Christian Unity\", but it is still often referred to as an octave, especially within the Roman Catholic and Anglo-Catholic traditions. The Week of Prayer is observed at various times around the world, especially in the Southern Hemisphere where it is commonly observed from Ascension to Pentecost.\n\nEach year, Luxembourg holds what is called the octave celebration from the 3rd to the 5th Sunday after Easter, 15 instead of 8 days, in honour of Our Lady of Luxembourg, patroness of the city.\n"}

However, John Calvin believed Christians were commanded to avoid recreation as well as work on Sunday in order to devote the day to worship, and during the seventeenth century there was consensus among continental as well as British Reformed theologians that the entire Sabbath was to be set aside for worship.\n\nWhile John Calvin's theology of the fourth commandment differed from that of the Puritans, he believed that Christians were commanded to cease from labor and recreation in order to devote the entire day to worship. The Genevan Consistory during the time of Calvin regularly interviewed people for working or engaging in recreation considered inappropriate for spiritual refreshment such as hunting, dancing, banqueting, playing tennis or billiards, or bowling skittles on Sundays.\n\nDuring the Vestiarian controversy, Reformers were spurred to develop the regulative principle of worship, a fundamental article that no corporate worship is permissible that does not have the sanction of Scripture, whether stated explicitly, or derived by a necessary deduction from Scripture. By the 17th century, Puritans had applied the regulative principle to devote first-day Sabbath entirely to God, indulging in neither the labors nor the recreations common to the other six days.\n\nSunday Sabbatarianism as \"jure divino\" or divinely ordained command, in contrast to non-Sabbatarian and antinomian reliance on Christian liberty, thus was a closely linked development to the regulative principle amongst English Protestants over the 17th century. Stricter observance of Lord's Day arose in England and Scotland, in reaction to the Prelatic laxity with which Sunday observance was customarily kept, which included recreations classified as lawful. Opposed also by seventh-day Sabbatarians John Traske, Theophilus Brabourne, and the Seventh-day Baptists, some Puritans stated that Sabbath was a proportion (one-seventh) rather than a particular day (either Saturday or Sunday), while others further specifically identified the first day as Christian Sabbath.\n\nThough there are slight differences between confessional formulations of British and continental European Reformed churches, in the seventeenth century there came to be a consensus among the Reformed that the Sabbath should be devoted primarily to the worship of God.\n\nPuritan Sabbatarianism is enshrined in its most mature expression, the \"Westminster Confession of Faith\" (1646), in the Calvinist theological tradition (Chapter 21, \"Of Religious Worship, and the Sabbath Day\", sections 7-8):\n\nJonathan Edwards delivered three sermons on \"The Perpetuity and Change of the Sabbath\" that are central to Puritan tradition. The first sermon emphasises Sabbath as an immutable, divine natural and positive law (as to proportion), while the second emphasises an alteration of \"another law, which determined the beginning and ending of their working days\" (as to order); the first day of creation is regarded as unknowable, and the weekday assigned to Sabbath regarded as not revealed until the Exodus. The third sermon regards the proper keeping of Sabbath: \"We are strictly to abstain from being outwardly engaged in any worldly thing, either worldly business or recreations,\" because \"the sabbath-day is an accepted time, a day of salvation, a time wherein God especially loves to be sought, and loves to be found.\"\n\nReformed Sabbatarian theologian G. I. Williamson accordingly suggests that \"television, reading of newspapers and magazines, and engaging in sports and excursions ... are not proper to the Sabbath because 'Sabbath' means to cease from these things in order to give one day exclusively to worship and the reading of God's Word, etc.\" The cessation described entails all engrossing activities of the six days of the week, whether employment or recreations, and thus specifically excludes ceasing only from work while continuing favorite recreations. Williamson affirms striving toward holiness, calling it a lofty goal to avoid \"even thoughts and words about our worldly employments or recreations.\"\n\nThough modern expression of Puritan Sabbath has been caricatured as being boring, organisations that promote Sabbaths as joyous, delightful appointments include Day One Christian Ministries.\n\nHistorical theologian R. Scott Clark has criticized the idea that distinct \"Puritan\" and \"Continental\" views on the Sabbath exist, instead arguing that the Reformed have historically agreed that recreation is prohibited on Sunday.\n\nIn the United States throughout the nineteenth century, Protestant moralists organized the \"Sabbath reform\" that pushed for stricter Sunday keeping. Their efforts prompted the enforcement of Sunday laws (often called blue laws) that legally barred a variety of activities on Sundays. The enforcement of Sunday laws gave rise to substantial church-state debates as well as minority-rights movements fueled by the resistance of Jews, Seventh Day Baptists, Catholics, and other religious minorities.\n\nIn 1671, the Province of Massachusetts Bay, codified the following law with respect to the Sunday Sabbath in its charter:\n\n"}

{"id": "2523862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2523862", "title": "Religion in France", "text": "Religion in France\n\nReligion in France can attribute its diversity to the country's adherence to freedom of religion and freedom of thought, as guaranteed by the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The Republic is based on the principle of \"laïcité\" (or \"freedom of conscience\") enforced by the 1880s Jules Ferry laws and the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State. Catholicism, the religion of a now small majority of French people, is no longer the state religion that it was before the French Revolution, as well as throughout the various, non-republican regimes of the 19th century (the Restoration, the July Monarchy and the Second French Empire).\n\nMajor religions practised in France include the Catholic Church, Islam, various branches of Protestantism, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Russian Orthodoxy, Armenian Christianity, and Sikhism amongst others, making it a multiconfessional country. Sunday mass attendance has fallen to 5% for the Catholics, and the overall level of observance is considerably lower than in the past. According to a Eurobarometer survey conducted in 2010, 27% of French citizens responded that they \"believe there is a God\", 27% answered that they \"believe there is some sort of spirit or life force\", and 40% answered that they \"do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force\". This makes France one of the most irreligious countries in the world.\n\nIn 2017, the Pew Research Center found in their \"Global Attitutes Survey\" that 54.2% of the French regarded themselves as Christians, with 47.4% belonging to the Catholic Church, 3.6% were Unaffiliated Christians, 2.2% were Protestants, 1.0% were Eastern Orthodox. Unaffiliated people were the 37.8% divided in 24.8% Atheists, 8.2% nothing in particular and 4.8% Agnostics. Muslims were the 5.0%, Jews comprised the 0.4% and members of other religions were the 1.4%. 1.1% was either undecided or didn't answer the question. \n\nIn 2015 the Eurobarometer, a survey funded by the European Union, found that Christianity was the religion of 54.3% of the respondents, with Catholicism being the main denomination with 47.8%, followed by other Christians with 4.1%, Protestants with 1.8% and the Eastern Orthodox with 0.6%. Muslims were found to comprise the 3.3%, Jews were the 0.4% and members of other religions were the 1.0%. Unaffiliated people were the 40.4%, 22.8% declared to be atheist and 17.6% declared to be agnostic.\n\nIn 2018, a study by the French polling agency \"OpinionWay\", based on a sample of 1.000, found that 41% of 18 to 30 years old Frenchmen declared themselves as Catholics, 3% as Protestants, 8% as Muslim, 1% were Buddhists, 1% were Jews and 3% were affiliated with other religions, 43% regarded themselves as unaffiliated. Regarding their belief of God, 52% believed that the existence of God to be certain or probable, whilst 28% believed it to be improbable and 19% regarded it as excluded.\n\nIn the same year, according to a study jointly conducted by London's St Mary's University's Benedict XVI Centre for Religion and Society and the Institut Catholique de Paris, and based on data from the European Social Survey 2014–2016, collected on a sample of 600, among 16 to 29 years-old Frenchmen 25% were Christians (23% Catholic and 2% Protestant), 10% were Muslims, 1% were of other religions, and 64% were not religious. The data was obtained from two questions, one asking \"Do you consider yourself as belonging to any particular religion or denomination?\" to the full sample and the other one asking \"Which one?\" to the sample who replied with \"Yes\".\n\nFrance guarantees freedom of religion as a constitutional right and the government generally respects this right in practice. A tradition of anticlericalism led the state to break its ties to the Catholic Church in 1905 and adopt a strong commitment to maintaining a totally secular public sector.\n\nCatholicism is the largest religion in France. During the pre-1789 \"Ancien Régime\", France was traditionally considered the Church's eldest daughter, and the King of France always maintained close links to the Pope. However, the \"Gallicanism\" principle meant that the king selected bishops.\n\nA strong Protestant population resided in France, primarily of Reformed confession. It was persecuted by the state for most of the time, with temporary periods of relative toleration. These wars continued throughout the 16th century, with the 1572 St. Bartholomew's Day massacre as its apex, until the 1598 Edict of Nantes issued by Henry IV.\n\nFor the first time, Huguenots were considered by the state as more than mere heretics. The Edict of Nantes thus opened a path for secularism and tolerance. In offering general freedom of conscience to individuals, the edict offered many specific concessions to the Protestants, for instance, amnesty and the reinstatement of their civil rights, including the right to work in any field or for the State and to bring grievances directly to the king.\n\nThe 1598 Edict also granted the Protestants fifty places of safety (\"places de sûreté\"), which were military strongholds such as La Rochelle for which the king paid 180,000 écus a year, along with a further 150 emergency forts (\"places de refuge\"), to be maintained at the Huguenots' own expense. Such an innovative act of toleration stood virtually alone in a Europe (except for the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth) where standard practice forced the subjects of a ruler to follow whatever religion that the ruler formally adopted – the application of the principle of \"cuius regio, eius religio\".\n\nReligious conflicts resumed in the end of the 17th century, when Louis XIV, the \"Sun King\", initiated the persecution of Huguenots by introducing the \"dragonnades\" in 1681. This wave of violence intimidated the Protestants into converting to Catholicism. He made the policy official with the 1685 revocation of the Edict of Nantes. As a result, a large number of Protestants – estimates range from 200,000 to 500,000 – left France during the following two decades, seeking asylum in England, the United Provinces, Denmark, in the Protestant states of the Holy Roman Empire (Hesse, Brandenburg-Prussia, etc.), and European colonies in North America and South Africa.\n\nThe 1685 revocation of the Edict of Nantes created a state of affairs in France similar to that of virtually every other European country of the period, where only the majority state religion was tolerated. The experiment of religious toleration in Europe was effectively ended for the time being. In practice, the revocation caused France to suffer a brain drain, as it lost a large number of skilled craftsmen, including key designers such as Daniel Marot.\n\nDuring the French Revolution, the Catholic Church was stripped of most of its wealth, its power and influence. The early revolutionaries sought to secularize all of French society, an effort inspired by the writings and philosophy of Voltaire. In August 1789, the new National Assembly abolished tithes, the mandatory 10% tax paid to the Catholic Church. In November 1789, they voted to expropriate the vast wealth of the Church in endowments, lands and buildings. In 1790, the Assembly abolished monastic religious orders. Statues and saints were rejected in a burst of iconoclasm, and most religious instruction ended.\n\nThe Civil Constitution of the Clergy of 1790, put the Catholic Church under state control. It required priests and bishops to be elected by French people, which usurped the traditional authority of the Church. The Republic legalized divorce and transferred the powers of birth, death, and marriage registration to the state. The Catholic clergy was persecuted by the commune of Paris and by some of the representatives on mission. Most notably, Jean-Baptiste Carrier conducted large-scale drownings of priests and nuns in the river Loire.\n\nIn 1793, the government established a secular Republican calendar to erase memory of Sundays, saint days and religious holidays. Traditionally, every seventh day – Sunday – was a day of rest, together with numerous other days for celebration and relaxation. The government tried to end all that; the new calendar only allowed one day in 10 for relaxation. Workers and peasants felt cheated and overworked. The new system disrupted daily routines, reduced work-free days and ended favorite celebrations. When the reformers were overthrown or executed, their radical new calendar was quickly abandoned.\n\nReligious minorities—Protestants and Jews—were granted full civil and political rights, which represented a shift towards a more secular government to some, and an attack on the Catholic Church to others. New religions and philosophies were allowed to compete with Catholicism. The introduction of the prominent cults during the revolutionary period – the Cult of Reason and the Cult of the Supreme Being – responded to the belief that religion and politics should be seamlessly fused together. This is a shift from the original Enlightenment ideals of the Revolution that advocated for a secular government with tolerance for various religious beliefs. While Maximilien Robespierre favored a religious foundation to the Republic, he maintained a hard stance against Catholicism because of its association with corruption and the counterrevolution.\n\nThe cults sought to erase the old ways of religion by closing churches, confiscating church bells, and implementing a new Republican Calendar that excluded any days for religious practice. Many churches were converted into Temples of Reason. The Cult of Reason was first to de-emphasize the existence of God, and instead focus on deism, featuring not the sacred, divine, nor eternal, but the natural, earthy, and temporal existence. To tie the church and the state together, the cults transformed traditional religious ideology into politics. The Cult of the Supreme Being used religion as political leverage. Robespierre accused political opponents as hiding behind God and using religion to justify their oppositional stance against the Revolution. It was a shift in ideology that allowed for the cult to use the new deistic beliefs for political momentum.\n\nFollowing the Thermidorian Reaction the persecutions of Catholic clergy ceased and the role of new cults practically ended.\n\nThe Catholic Church was badly hurt by the Revolution. By 1800 it was poor, dilapidated and disorganized, with a depleted and aging clergy. The younger generation had received little religious instruction, and was unfamiliar with traditional worship. However, in response to the external pressures of foreign wars, religious fervor was strong, especially among women.\n\nNapoleon took control by 1800 and realized that religious divisiveness had to be minimized to unite France. The Concordat of 1801 was an agreement between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII, signed in July 1801 that remained in effect until 1905. It sought national reconciliation between revolutionaries and Catholics and solidified the Roman Catholic Church as the majority church of France, with most of its civil status restored. The hostility of devout Catholics against the state had then largely been resolved. It did not restore the vast church lands and endowments that had been seized upon during the revolution and sold off. Catholic clergy returned from exile, or from hiding, and resumed their traditional positions in their traditional churches. Very few parishes continued to employ the priests who had accepted the Civil Constitution of the Clergy of the Revolutionary regime. While the Concordat restored much power to the papacy, the balance of church-state relations tilted firmly in Napoleon's favour. He selected the bishops and supervised church finances.\n\nWith the Bourbon Restoration and the Catholic Church again became the state religion of France. Other religion was tolerated, but Catholicism was favored financially and politically. Its lands and financial endowments were not returned, but now the government paid salaries and maintenance costs for normal church activities. The bishops had regained control of Catholic affairs. The aristocracy before the Revolution did not place a high priority on religious doctrine or practice, the decades of exile created an alliance of throne and altar. The royalists who returned were much more devout, and much more aware of their need for a close alliance with the Church. They had discarded fashionable skepticism and now promoted the wave of Catholic religiosity that was sweeping Europe, with a new regard to the Virgin Mary, the Saints, and popular religious rituals such as saying the rosary. Devotionalism and was far stronger in rural areas, and much less noticeable in Paris and the other cities. The population of 32 million included about 680,000 Protestants, and 60,000 Jews. They were tolerated. Anti-clericalism of the sort promoted by the Enlightenment and writers such as Voltaire had not disappeared, but it was in recession.\n\nAt the elite level, there was a dramatic change in intellectual climate from the dry intellectually oriented classicism to emotionally based romanticism. A book by François-René de Chateaubriand entitled \"Génie du christianisme\" (\"The Genius of Christianity\") (1802) had an enormous influence in reshaping French literature and intellectual life. The book emphasized the power of religion in creating European high culture. Chateaubriand’s book:\n\nNapoleon III was a strong supporter of Catholic interest, such as financing, and support for Catholic missionaries in the emerging French Empire. His primary goal was conciliation of all the religious and anti-religious interests in France, to avoid the furious hatreds and battles that took place during the revolution, and that would reappear after he left office.\n\nIn foreign policy, he was the leading supporter of the Pope, especially against the anti-clerical Kingdom of Italy that emerged in 1860, took control of parts of the papal states, and sought to take complete control of Rome. The French army prevented that. In Paris, the Emperor was supported the conservative Gallican bishops to minimize the people role inside France, in the liberal Catholic intellectuals who wanted to use the Church as an instrument of reform. Problem came with Pope Pius IX who reigned 1846 to 1878. He began as a liberal, but suddenly in the 1860s became the leading champion of reactionary politics in Europe, in opposition to all forms of modern liberalism. He demanded complete autonomy for the church and religious and educational affairs, and had the First Vatican Council (1869–70) decree papal infallibility. Napoleon III was too committed in foreign-policy to the support of Rome to break with the Pope, but that alliance seriously weakened him at home. When he declared war on Prussia in 1870, he brought his army home, and the kingdom of Italy swallowed up the papal domains and the Pope became the prisoner of the Vatican. Vatican statements attacking progress, industrialization, capitalism, socialism, and virtually every new idea not only angered the liberal and conservative Catholic elements in France, but energized the secular liberals (including many professionals) and anti-clerical socialist movement; they escalated their attacks on church schools.\n\nThroughout the lifetime of the Third Republic (1870–1940), there were battles over the status of the Catholic Church in France among the republicans, monarchists and the authoritarians (such as the Napoleonists). The French clergy and bishops were closely associated with the monarchists and many of its hierarchy were from noble families. Republicans were based in the anti-clerical middle class, who saw the Church's alliance with the monarchists as a political threat to republicanism, and a threat to the modern spirit of progress. The republicans detested the Church for its political and class affiliations; for them, the Church represented the Ancien Régime, a time in French history most republicans hoped was long behind them. The republicans were strengthened by Protestant and Jewish support. Numerous laws were passed to weaken the Catholic Church. In 1879, priests were excluded from the administrative committees of hospitals and boards of charity; in 1880, new measures were directed against the religious congregations; from 1880 to 1890 came the substitution of lay women for nuns in many hospitals; in 1882, the Ferry school laws were passed. Napoleon's Concordat of 1801 continued in operation, but in 1881, the government cut off salaries to priests it disliked.\n\nRepublicans feared that religious orders in control of schools—especially the Jesuits and Assumptionists—indoctrinated anti-republicanism into children. Determined to root this out, republicans insisted they needed control of the schools for France to achieve economic and militaristic progress. (Republicans felt one of the primary reasons for the German victory in 1870 was their superior education system.)\n\nThe early anti-Catholic laws were largely the work of republican Jules Ferry in 1882. Religious instruction in all schools was forbidden, and religious orders were forbidden to teach in them. Funds were appropriated from religious schools to build more state schools. Later in the century, other laws passed by Ferry's successors further weakened the Church's position in French society. Civil marriage became compulsory, divorce was introduced, and chaplains were removed from the army.\n\nWhen Leo XIII became pope in 1878, he tried to calm Church-State relations. In 1884, he told French bishops not to act in a hostile manner toward the State ('Nobilissima Gallorum Gens').\nIn 1892, he issued an encyclical advising French Catholics to rally to the Republic and defend the Church by participating in republican politics ('Au milieu des sollicitudes').\nThis attempt at improving the relationship failed. Deep-rooted suspicions remained on both sides and were inflamed by the Dreyfus Affair (1894–1906). Catholics were for the most part anti-Dreyfusard. The Assumptionists published anti-Semitic and anti-republican articles in their journal La Croix. This infuriated republican politicians, who were eager to take revenge. Often they worked in alliance with Masonic lodges. The Waldeck-Rousseau Ministry (1899–1902) and the Combes Ministry (1902–05) fought with the Vatican over the appointment of bishops. Chaplains were removed from naval and military hospitals in the years 1903 and 1904, and soldiers were ordered not to frequent Catholic clubs in 1904.\n\nEmile Combes, when elected Prime Minister in 1902, was determined to defeat Catholicism thoroughly. After only a short while in office, he closed down all parochial schools in France. Then he had parliament reject authorisation of all religious orders. This meant that all fifty-four orders in France were dissolved and about 20,000 members immediately left France, many for Spain. \nThe Combes government worked with Masonic lodges to create a secret surveillance of all army officers to make sure that devout Catholics would not be promoted. Exposed as the Affaire Des Fiches, the scandal undermined support for the Combes government, and he resigned. It also undermined morale in the army, as officers realized that hostile spies examining their private lives were more important to their careers than their own professional accomplishments.\n\nRadicals (as they called themselves) achieved their main goals in 1905: they repealed Napoleon's 1801 Concordat. Church and State were finally separated. All Church property was confiscated. Religious personnel were no longer paid by the State. Public worship was given over to associations of Catholic laymen who controlled access to churches. However, in practice, masses and rituals continued to be performed.\n\nA 1905 law instituted the separation of Church and State and prohibited the government from recognising, salarying, or subsidising any religion. The 1926 Briand-Ceretti Agreement subsequently restored for a while a formal role for the state in the appointment of Catholic bishops, but evidence for its exercise is not easily obtained. Prior to 1905, the 1801–1808 Concordat compelled the State to support the Catholic Church, the Lutheran Church, the Calvinist Church, and the Jewish religion, and to fund public religious education in those established religions.\n\nFor historical reasons, this situation is still current in Alsace-Moselle, which was a German region in 1905 and only joined France again in 1918. Alsace-Moselle maintains a local law of pre-1918 statutes which include the Concordat: the national government salaries as state civil servants the clergy of the Catholic diocese of Metz and of Strasbourg, of the Lutheran Protestant Church of Augsburg Confession of Alsace and Lorraine, of the Protestant Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine, and of the three regional Israelite consistories, and it provides for now non-compulsory religious education in those religions in public schools and universities. For also historical reasons, Catholic priests in French Guiana are civil servants of the local government.\n\nReligious buildings built prior to 1905 at taxpayers' expense are retained by the local or national government, and may be used at no expense by religious organisations. As a consequence, most Catholic churches, Protestant temples, and Jewish synagogues are owned and maintained by the government. The government, since 1905, has been prohibited from funding any post-1905 religious edifice, and thus religions must build and support all newer religious buildings at their own expense. Some local governments \"de facto\" subsidise prayer rooms as part of greater \"cultural associations\".\n\nAn ongoing topic of controversy is whether the separation of Church and State should be weakened so that the government would be able to subsidise Muslim prayer rooms and the formation of imams. Advocates of such measures, such as Nicolas Sarkozy at times, declare that they would encourage the Muslim population to better integrate into the fabric of French society. Opponents contend that the state should not fund religions. Furthermore, the state ban on wearing conspicuous religious symbols, such as the Islamic female headscarf, in public schools has alienated some French Muslims, provoked minor street protests and drawn some international criticism.\n\nIn the late 1950s after the close of the Algerian war, hundreds of thousands of Muslims, including some who had supported France (Harkis), settled permanently to France. They went to the larger cities where they lived in subsidized public housing, and suffered very high unemployment rates. In October 2005, the predominantly Arab-immigrant suburbs of Paris, Lyons, Lille, and other French cities erupted in riots by socially alienated teenagers, many of them second- or third-generation immigrants.\n\nAmerican University professor C. Schneider says:\n\nFor the next three convulsive weeks, riots spread from suburb to suburb, affecting more than three hundred towns...Nine thousand vehicles were torched, hundreds of public and commercial buildings destroyed, four thousand rioters arrested, and 125 police officers wounded.\n\nTraditional interpretations say these race riots were spurred by radical Muslims or unemployed youth. Another view states that the riots reflected broader problem of racism and police violence in France.\n\nIn March 2012, a Muslim radical named Mohammed Merah shot three French soldiers and four Jewish citizens, including children in Toulouse and Montauban.\n\nIn January 2015, the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo that had ridiculed the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, and a neighborhood Jewish grocery store came under attack from radicalized Muslims who had been born and raised in the Paris region. World leaders rally to Paris to show their support for free speech. Analysts agree that the episode had a profound impact on France. \"The New York Times\" summarized the ongoing debate:\n\nSo as France grieves, it is also faced with profound questions about its future: How large is the radicalized part of the country's Muslim population, the largest in Europe? How deep is the rift between France's values of secularism, of individual, sexual and religious freedom, of freedom of the press and the freedom to shock, and a growing Muslim conservatism that rejects many of these values in the name of religion?\n\nAs of the 2000s Buddhism in France was estimated to have between 1 million (Ministry of the Interior) strict adherents and 5 million people influenced by Buddhist doctrines, very large numbers for a Western country. Many French Buddhists do not consider themselves \"religious\". According to scholar Dennis Gira, who was the director of the Institute of Science and Theology of Religions of Paris, Buddhism in France has a missionary nature and is undergoing a process of \"inculturation\" that may represent a new turning of the \"Wheel of the Dharma\", similar to those that it underwent in China and Japan, from which a new incarnation of the doctrine — a \"French Buddhism\" — will possibly arise.\n\nAbout 2% of the working-age, internet connected population of France declared they were Buddhists in 2016. In 2012, the European headquarters of the Fo Guang Shan monastic order opened in France, near Paris. It was the largest Buddhist temple in Europe at that time.\n\nAccording to a survey held by Institut français d'opinion publique (Ifop) for the Institut Montaigne think-tank, 51.1% of the total population of France was Christian in 2016. The following year, a survey by Ipsos focused on Protestants and based on 31,155 interviews found that 57.5% of the total population of France declared to be Catholic and 3.1% declared to be Protestant.\n\nIn 2016, \"Ipsos Global Trends\", a multi-nation survey held by Ipsos and based on approximately 1,000 interviews, found that Christianity is the religion of 45% of the working-age, internet connected population of France; 42% stated they were Catholic, 2% stated that they were Protestants, and 1% declared to belong to any Orthodox church.\n\nEarly Christianity was already present among the Gauls by the 2nd century; Irenaeus, bishop of Lugdunum (Lyon), detailed the deaths of ninety-year-old bishop Pothinus and other martyrs during the persecution in Lyon which took place in 177. The Gaulish church was soon established in communion with the bishop of Rome. With the Migration Period of the Germanic peoples, the Gauls were invaded by the Franks, who at first practised Frankish paganism. Their tribes were unified into a kingdom, which came to be called France, by Clovis I. He was proclaimed the king of the Franks in 509, after having been baptised in 496 by Remigius, bishop of Reims. Roman Catholicism was made the state religion of France. This made the Franks the only Germanic people who directly converted from their paganism to Roman Catholicism without first embracing Arianism, which was the first religion of choice among Germanic peoples in the Migration Period.\n\nIn 800, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, forming the unified political and religious foundation of Christendom, medieval European Christian civilisation, and establishing in earnest France's long historical association with the Catholic Church, for which it was known as the \"eldest daughter of the church\" throughout the Middle Ages. The French Revolution (1789–1790), which resulted in the establishment of the French First Republic (1792–1804), involved a heavy persecution of the Catholic Church, within a policy of dechristianisation, which led to the destruction of many churches, religious orders and artworks, including the very influential Cluny Abbey. During the First French Empire (1804–1814), the Bourbon Restoration (1814–1830) and the following July Monarchy (1830–1848), Roman Catholicism was made again the state religion, and maintained its role as the \"de facto\" majority religion during the Second French Republic (1848–1852) and the Second French Empire (1852–1870). \"Laïcité\" (secularism), absolute neutrality of the state with respect to religious doctrines, was first established during the Third French Republic (1870–1940), codified with the 1905 Law on the Separation of Church and State, and remains the official policy of the contemporary French republic.\n\nIn a 2016 study sponsored by two Catholic newspapers, the scholars Cleuziou and Cibois estimated that Catholics represented 53.8% of the French population. According to the same study, 23.5% were engaged Catholics and 17% were practising Catholics. The following year, in a survey focused on Protestantism, 57.5% of a sample of 31,155 people declared to be Catholic.\n\nAccording to a survey by Ifop, in 2012 770 people out of the 37,743 interviewed (or 2.1%) declared to be Protestants of various types. About 42% of them were Calvinists (Huguenots), 21% were evangelical Protestants, 17% were Lutherans and another 20% were affiliated with other Protestant churches. The percentage rose to 3.1% in 2017, mainly due to recent conversions. Out of 100% of people that have become Protestants, 67% were Catholic and 27% were of no religion.\n\nIn a study regarding the various religions of France, based on 51 surveys held by the Ifop in the period 2011-2014, so based on a sample of 51.770 interviewed, there were 17.4% of Protestants in the Bas-Rhin, 7.3% in the Haut-Rhin, 7.2% in the Gard, 6.8% in the Drôme and 4.2% in the Ardèche. In the other departments this presence is residual, with, for example, only 0.5% in Côte-d'Or and in the Côtes-d'Armor.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church in France is represented by several communities and ecclesiastical jurisdictions. Traditionally, Eastern Orthodox Christians in France are mainly ethnic Greeks, Russians, Romanians, Bulgarians, Serbs and Georgians, but there are also some ethnic French converts to Eastern Orthodoxy. Different Eastern Orthodox churches have separate jurisdictions and organisations in France, the oldest among them being the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of France under the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.\n\nOriental Orthodox Christianity in France is represented by several communities and ecclesiastical jurisdictions. Traditionally, Oriental Orthodox Christians in France are mainly ethnic Armenians, Copts, Ethiopians and Syriacs, but there are also French converts. The largest Oriental Orthodox church in France is the French Coptic Orthodox Church.\n\nOther Christian groups in France include the Jehovah's Witnesses, the Mormons, and other small sects. The European Court on Human Rights reckoned 249,918 \"regular and occasional\" Jehovah's Witnesses in France and according to their official website, there are 128,759 ministers who teach the Bible in the country.\n\nA 2016 survey held by Institut Montaigne and Ifop found that 6.6% of the French population had an Islamic background, while 5.6% declared they were Muslims by faith. According to the same survey, 84.9% of the French people who had an Islamic background were still Muslims, 3.4% were Christians, 10.0% were not religious and 1.3% belonged to other religions.\n\nIn the same year, Ipsos found that just 2% of the working-age, internet connected French declared they were Muslims. This gap is most likely due to the difference of the samples, since the survey held by the Institut Montaigne and the Institut français d'opinion publique has a total sample of 15,459 people, while the Ipsos Global Trends survey has a sample of only about 1,000, so the margin of error is bigger.\n\nIn 2016, 0.8% of the total population of France, or about 535.000 people, were religious Jews. There has been a Jewish presence in France since at least the early Middle Ages. France was a center of Jewish learning in the Middle Ages, but persecution increased as the Middle Ages wore on, including multiple expulsions and returns. During the late 18th-century French Revolution, France was the first country in Europe to emancipate its Jewish population. Antisemitism persisted despite legal equality, as expressed in the Dreyfus affair of the late 19th century.\n\nDuring World War II, the Vichy government collaborated with Nazi occupiers to deport numerous French and foreign Jewish refugees to concentration camps. 75% of the Jewish population in France nonetheless survived the Holocaust.\n\nPaganism, in the sense of contemporary Neopaganism, in France has been described as twofold, on one side represented by ethnically identitary religious movements and on the other side by a variety of witchcraft and shamanic traditions without ethnic connotations. According to the French historian of ideas and far-right ideologies Stéphane François, the term \"pagan\" (Latin \"paganus\"), used by Christians to define those who maintained polytheistic religions, originally meant \"countryman\" in the sense of \"citizen\", the \"insiders\" (inside the cultural tradition or citizenry), and its opposite term was \"alien\" (Latin \"alienus\"), the \"others\", the \"outsiders\", which defined Christians. Modern French Pagans of the identitary movements hearken back to this meaning.\n\nIdentitary Pagan movements are the majority and are represented by Celtic Druidry and Germanic Heathenry, many of whom uphold the idea of a superiority of the white race and of the Indo-Europeans. They are aligned with the \"Nouvelle Droite\" political movement, espousing the idea that each ethnically-defined folk has its own natural land and natural religion. The identitary Pagan movement carries within itself a warrior ethic which is concerned with the erosion of French and European culture under growing immigration and Islamisation, so that Jean Haudry, longtime identitary Pagan and professor of linguistics at Lyon III, in a 2001 article entitled \"Païens !\" for the journal of the organisation \"Terre et Peuple\" says that \"Pagans will be at the forefront of the reconquest (of Europe)\". Dominique Venner, who committed suicide in 2013 inside Notre-Dame de Paris in protest against the erosion of French culture, was a Pagan close to the Groupement de recherche et d'études pour la civilisation européenne (GRECE), an identitary Pagan think-tank founded by the \"Nouvelle Droite\" ideologist Alain de Benoist. Other politically-engaged Pagans include Pierre Vial, who with other members of the National Front was among the founders of \"Terre et Peuple\".\n\nAccording to the French sociologist Régis Dericquebourg, in 2003 the main small religious minorities were the Jehovah's Witnesses (130,000, though the European Court on Human Rights reckoned the number at 249,918 \"regular and occasional\" Jehovah's Witnesses), Adventists, Evangelicals, Mormons (31,000 members), Scientologists (4,000), and Soka Gakkai Buddhists. According to the 2005 Association of Religion Data Archives data there were close to 4,400 Bahá'ís in France. According to the 2007 edition of the \"Quid\", other notable religious minorities included the New Apostolic Church (20,000), the Universal White Brotherhood (20,000), Sukyo Mahikari (15,000–20,000), the New Acropolis (10,000), the Universal Alliance (1,000), and the Grail Movement (950).\n\nMany groups have around 1,000 members, including Antoinism, Aumism, Christian Science, Invitation to Life, Raelism, and the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, while the Unification Church has around 400 members. In 1995, France created the first French parliamentary commission on cult activities which led to a report registering a number of religious groups considered as socially disruptive and/or dangerous. Some of these groups have been banned, including the Children of God.\n\nIn Paris and the surrounding Île-de-France region French Muslims tend to be more educated and religious, and the vast majority of them rejects violence and say they are loyal to France. Among Muslims in Paris, in the early 2010s, 77% disagreed when asked whether violence is an acceptable moral response for a noble cause or not; 73% said that they were loyal to France; and 18% believed homosexuality to be acceptable.\n\nIn 2015 there were 2,500 mosques in France, up from 2,000 in 2011. In 2015, Dalil Boubakeur, rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris, said the number should be doubled to accommodate the large and growing population of French Muslims.\n\nFinancing to the construction of mosques was a problematic issue for a long time; French authorities were concerned that foreign capital could be used to acquire influence in France and so in the late 1980s it was decided to favour the formation of a \"French Islam\", though the 1905 law on religions forbids the funding of religious groups by the state. According to Salah Bariki, advisor to the mayor of Marseille in 2001, at a Koranic school in Nièvre only three percent of the books were written in French and everything was financed from abroad. She supported the public participation in financing an Islamic cultural centre in Marseille to encourage Muslims to develop and use French learning materials, in order to thwart foreign indoctrination. Even secular Muslims and actors of civil society were to be represented by the centre. Local authorities have financed the construction of mosques, sometimes without minarets and calling them Islamic \"cultural centres\" or municipal halls rented to \"civil associations\". In the case of the plans to build the Mosque of Marseille, due to protests and tribunal decision by the National Rally, the National Republican Movement, and the Mouvement pour la France, the rent of a terrain for the mosque was increased from €300/year to €24,000/year and the renting period was reduced from 99 to 50 years.\n\nAfter the shooting at the \"Charlie Hebdo\" satirical newspaper by Al-Qaeda's followers, two million people in Paris, including President Hollande, and more than forty world leaders led a rally of national unity. One teacher in Clichy-sous-Bois, a suburb with many immigrants, reported that three quarters of the students had refused to observe the minute of silence in memory of the victims of the attack. There have been about two hundred incidents in schools after the attack, some of them \"glorifying terrorism\". In Bobigny, a suburb of Paris, a couple of students grunted \"Allahu Akbar\" during the minute of silence, the same words that were shouted by the terrorists during the attack.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31556946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31556946", "title": "Religious orientation", "text": "Religious orientation\n\nAn individual's or community's religious orientation involves presumptions about the existence and nature of God or gods, religious prescriptions about morality and communal and personal spirituality. Such presumptions involve the study of psychology, ethics, sociology and anthropology.\n\nAccording to Whitley and Kite, researchers who were interested in studying the psychological effects of religion on prejudice initially studied the relationship between simple indicators of religiosity such as whether or not a person went to church and the level of prejudice that that person showed. Surprisingly these researchers found that \"religious involvement was consistently correlated with a variety of forms of prejudice.\" (Whitley & Kite, 2010) \n\nNaturally these findings were not well received by religious leaders or the religious community in general. It was at this point that there was a clear shift in the nature of the research. Instead of being concerned with factors such as church attendance and the quantity of religious involvement, researchers were now interested in the quality of religious involvement. As Whitley and Kite said, \"These ideas evolved into the concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic religious orientation.\" (Whitley & Kite, 2010) \n\nAllport & Ross developed a means of measuring religious orientation. The Extrinsic measures extrinsic religious orientation (1967). A sample statement from this scale would be “The church is most important as a place to formulate good social relationships” (Whitley & Kite, 2010). This scale brought forth a lot of interest in religious orientations and much research has been done over the years. But as more researchers began studying religious orientation, the more problems that arose with the Intrinsic and Extrinsic scales measuring what they were supposed to be measuring (Hunsberger & Jacson, 2005).\n\nExtrinsic Religious Orientation is a method of using religion to achieve non-religious goals, essentially viewing religion as a means to an end. It is used by people who go to religious gatherings and claim certain religious ideologies to establish or maintain social networks while minimally adhering to the teachings of the religion. People high in external religious orientation are more likely to conform to social norms and demands rather than what the religion requires, and are often prone to twist religious beliefs to serve their own political goals. Gordon Allport stated that people high in external religious orientation use religion, “to provide security and solace, sociability and distraction, status and self-justification” (Allport &Ross, 1967, p. 434). (Whitley & Kite, 2010)\n\nHunsberger & Jackson did a review of studies on religious orientation that had taken place since 1990 (2005). Links have been made between prejudice and religious orientation but there have been no agreement on the relationship with intolerance. This is because there are many targets of prejudice, such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and age. Hunsberger and Jackson have found support for the idea that the target of prejudice is important when looking at prejudice and religious orientation relationships. After careful analysis, they have found that extrinsic orientation is positively related to racial/ethnic and gay/lesbian intolerance. People who measure high in extrinsic religious orientation have a utilitarian approach and view religion as a meaningful source of social status. Having high extrinsic religious orientation means you conform to popular trends, such trends including prejudice. The validity of the religious orientation scales have proved debatable, thus relationships to prejudice have either supported or refuted Allport and Ross's theories (Hunsberger & Jackson, 2005).\n\nAn example would be a politician who goes to church in order to gain votes.\n\nAccording to Whitley and Kite, a person with an Intrinsic Religious Orientation sincerely believes in their religion and all its teachings and attempt to live their lives as their religion preaches that they should (Whitley & Kite, 2010). This agrees with what Daniel Batson would say; that while a person with an extrinsic religious orientation sees religion as a means to an end, a person with an intrinsic orientation sees their religion as that end. To them their religion is, \"An active directing force, not just a tool used to reach self-serving ends.\" Those with this orientation find their religion to be the most important aspect of their life and seek to contextualize other aspects of their life through their religion. \n\nResearch has found that people who hold an intrinsic religious orientation sincerely believe in and follow the teachings of their religion. They live their religion, and as a result those, \"with a strong internal orientation should be unprejudiced to the extent that their religions teach inter group tolerance.\" Studies have found that these people show either no correlation or a negative correlation for racial prejudice. On the other hand, these same people often show a positive correlation for prejudice against gays. This effect would be predicted, being that while most religions do not speak ill of other races (racism being due to upbringing rather than any Biblical foundation), they do tend to have little regard for homosexuals. \n\nWhile this research appears more favorable than the research that showed a correlation between religious activity and prejudice, some researchers are convinced that these people are merely showing what they believe to be a more socially acceptable bias. Batson tested this hypothesis by having participants in a study (a study the participants were led to believe was about watching and evaluating a movie) choose whether to sit in a theater with a white confederate, or a black one. There were two conditions in this study, an overt condition in which both theaters were showing the same movie and a covert condition in which each theater was showing a different movie. The researchers believed that a prejudiced person who was attempting to appear unprejudiced would sit with the black confederate when the movie selection was the same in order to appear unprejudiced, but would sit with the white confederate (participants were white) when their choice could be attributed to wanting to watch the different movie. The researchers found that 75% of intrinsically religious participants chose to sit with the black confederate in the overt condition, but only 46% choose to sit with the black confederate in the covert condition. While these results do show that intrinsically motivated people do want to appear racially unbiased, it also shows that they are not racially prejudiced in general. Contrary to the religious orientations theory, extrinsic religiosity was unrelated to prejudice in either condition.\n\nAn example would be a person who truly believes in their religion and uses this belief to guide them in all other aspects of their life.\n\nA third religious orientation proposed by Batson is the quest orientation. People with this orientation treats their religion not as a means or an end, but a search for truth. As Batson said, \"An individual who approaches religion in this way recognizes that he or she does not know, and probably never will know, the final truth about such matters. Still the questions are deemed important, and however tentative and subject to changes, answers are sought.\" \n\nIntuitively, it is logical to assume that people who hold a quest orientation would be low in prejudice because by having this orientation they have already shown that they are open-minded and willing to change. This idea was tested alongside the intrinsic and extrinsic orientations by Batson in his theater experiment (described above in the \"Intrinsic Religious Orientation and Prejudice\" section). People who scored high in quest orientation choose to sit with the black confederate about half the time in both the overt and covert conditions, indicating both a lack of prejudice and a lack of the attempt to appear unprejudiced. To summarize Whitley and Kite as well as Batson, quest orientation appears to be the source of \"universal love and compassion\" that has long been sought by both religious scholars and researchers interested in the psychology of religion.\n\nExamples of people who have attained a quest orientation are Gautama Buddha, Malcolm X, and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.\n"}

In older Sanskrit, शर्वर is written as कर्वर (karvara).\n\nSharvara can be compared with the Greek Cerberus, the mythological dog of the Greeks with similar characteristics. However, there is no description of Cerberus having a companion, and he is usually depicted with three heads. Scholars have concluded that the three heads were a Greek addition to the underlying Indo-Aryan myth.\n\nShavara can also be compared to Odin's wolves in Norse mythology.

{"id": "26612065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26612065", "title": "Sikhism in Afghanistan", "text": "Sikhism in Afghanistan\n\nSikhism in Afghanistan is limited to small populations, primarily in major cities, with the largest numbers of Afghan Sikhs living in Jalalabad, Ghazni, Kabul, and to a lesser extent Kandahar. These Sikhs are Afghan nationals who normally speak native Pashto, but also speak Dari, Hindi or Punjabi. Their total population is around 1200 families or 8000 members.\n\nThere were over 20,000 Sikhs in Kabul in the 1980s, but after the start of the Civil War in 1992, most had fled. Seven of Kabul's eight Gurdwaras were destroyed during the civil war. Only Gurdwara Karte Parwan, located in the Karte Parwan section of Kabul, remains. They are centered today in Karte Parwan and some parts of the old city.\n\nAs of 2001, Jalalabad had 100 Sikh families, totaling around 700 people, who worship at two large Gurdwaras. Legend states that the older of the Gurudwaras was built to commemorate the visit of Guru Nanak Dev. On July 1, 2018, at least 10 Sikhs were killed in a targeted suicide bombing at the PD1 market.\n\nKandahar has a remarkably small Sikh community, with only about 15 families living there as of 2002. \n\nSome early Khatri Sikhs established and maintained colonies in Afghanistan for trading purposes. Later, conflicts between the Sikh misls and empire against the Afghan-based Durrani Empire led to tension. Sikhs also served in the British Empire's military during several operations in Afghanistan in the 19th century.\n\nDuring the 1980s Soviet-Afghan War, many Afghan Sikhs fled to India, where the Sikh community is well-established; a second, much larger wave followed following the 1992 fall of the Najibullah regime. Sikh gurdwaras (temples) throughout the country were destroyed in the Afghan Civil War of the 1990s, leaving only the Gurdwara Karte Parwan in Kabul.\n\nUnder the Taliban, the Sikhs were a relatively tolerated religious minority, and allowed to practice their religion. However, the Sikh custom of cremation of the dead was prohibited by the Taliban, and cremation grounds vandalized. In addition, Sikhs were required to wear yellow patches or veils to identify themselves.\n\nBy tradition, Sikhs cremate their dead, an act considered sacrilege in Islam. Cremation has become a major issue among Sikh Afghans, as traditional cremation grounds have been appropriated by Muslims, particularly in the Qalacha area of Kabul, which Sikhs and Hindus had used for over a century. In 2003 Sikhs complained to the Afghan government regarding the loss of cremation grounds, which had forced them to send a woman's body to Pakistan to be cremated, following which the Minister of Religious affairs investigated the issue. Though the grounds were reported as returned to Sikh control in 2006, in 2007 local Muslims allegedly beat Sikhs attempting to cremate a community leader, and the funeral proceeded only with police protection. As of 2010, cremation in Kabul is still reported as being disapproved of by locals.\n\nSikhs in Afghanistan continue to face problems, with the issue of the Sikh custom of cremation figuring prominently.

{"id": "3715143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3715143", "title": "Spirit rescue", "text": "Spirit rescue\n\nSpirit Rescue relates to the practice within Spiritualism of assisting spirit entities who are believed to have failed to make the transition into the afterlife. They are therefore considered by Spiritualists to remain within our physical dimension in a wandering or lost state. The usual causes of this are purported to be sudden or traumatic death, guilt, fear of punishment, restrictive religious beliefs and other emotional conditions that may limit a person's focus and prevent a successful transition.\n\nSpirit Rescue is typically performed by a Spiritualist medium who will attempt to communicate with the discarnate spirit and explain their condition to them, reassure them or explore whatever it is that holds them within the earthly dimension of existence. \nMany of these spirits are considered to display a reduced degree of awareness and consciousness compared to normal human consciousness, and it is a common belief among Spiritualists that the spirit may not even realize they have died, especially as they may exist within a projected reality of their own making, a mental construct conforming to their expectations and emotions. This is allegedly much like a dream state from which a medium may attempt to move the spirit into a higher consciousness. The essence of rescue work appears to be reaching earthbound spirit and attempting to raise their conscious awareness to include other options of reality.\n\nCommon rescue methods may involve a medium using clairvoyant abilities, mentally \"seeing\" or sensing the spirit concerned, or they may employ a trance state of consciousness and channel the spirit, therefore allowing the spirit to speak to others present.\n\nThe use of spirit rescue and spiritual releasement therapy remain controversial within the medical community. Considered by many to be a complementary or alternative practice. Practitioners sometimes use diagnoses which are not recognized within the mainline of psychiatric practice.\n\n"}
{"id": "2894130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2894130", "title": "Starving artist", "text": "Starving artist\n\nA starving artist is an artist who sacrifices material well-being in order to focus on their artwork. They typically live on minimum expenses, either for a lack of business or because all their disposable income goes toward art projects. Related terms include starving actor and starving musician.\n\nSome starving artists desire mainstream success but have difficulty due to high barriers to entry in fields such as the visual arts, the film industry, and theatre. These artists frequently take temporary positions such as waitering or other service industry jobs while they focus their attention on \"breaking through\" in their preferred field. The Starving Artists Project describes these artists as those who have not yet broken into their careers.\n\nOther artists may find enough satisfaction in living as artists to choose voluntary poverty regardless of their prospects for future financial reward or broad recognition. Virginia Nicholson writes in \"Among the Bohemians: Experiments in Living 1900–1939\":\n\nFifty years on we may judge that Dylan Thomas's poverty was noble, while Nina Hamnett's was senseless. But a minor artist with no money goes as hungry as a genius. What drove them to do it? I believe that such people were not only choosing art, they were choosing the life of the artist. Art offered them a different way of living, one that they believed more than compensated for the loss of comfort and respectability.\n\nThe starving artist is a typical figure of Romanticism in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, seen in many paintings and works of literature. In 1851, Henri Murger wrote about four starving artists in \"Scènes de la Vie de Bohème\", the basis for the operas \"La bohème\" by Puccini and Leoncavallo by Leoncavallo. In 1890, Knut Hamsun's novel, \"Hunger,\" depicted a period of a starving artist's life. In 1924, Franz Kafka wrote a short story called \"A Hunger Artist\" about a man who is world-famous for his public performances of fasting.\n\n"}
{"id": "46700568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46700568", "title": "Temple Stay", "text": "Temple Stay\n\nTemple Stay is cultural program in several South Korean Buddhist temples. Temple Stay allows participants to experience the life of Buddhist practitioners and learn the various aspects of Korean Buddhist culture and history through stories told by monks. The temple stay program has been operating since the 2002 World Cup game.\nTemplestay is an experiential program in Korean Buddhism initiated by the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism at the onset of the 2002 World Cup.\nDuring its 1,700 years of history, Korean Buddhism has preserved and passed down Ganhwa Seon practice, a kind of Seon (Zen) meditation. Every year during the retreat seasons of summer and winter, about 2,500 monastics enter a 100-day meditation retreat in one of the 100 temples nationwide. This is a unique Korean tradition in the sphere of Mahayana Buddhism. \n\nThis tradition has influenced the architectural layout of temples and monastic life over the years, and one can attain inner calm and peace of mind and body at any of these temples. In their effort to transform the 2002 World Cup into a cultural opportunity, the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism decided to open their temple gates during the games and allowed both Koreans and non-Koreans to stay in one of their mountain temples. \n\nAs a result, in the 30 days the World Cup lasted (May 31, 2002 to June 30), 1,000 foreigners and 10,000 Koreans experienced the Templestay program. That was a sizable achievement, but more importantly, Korean Buddhism and the Templestay program became known to the wider world as major international media, including CNN, the New York Times, BBC and NHK, paid growing attention and reported feature stories about them. \n\nAfter the end of the 2002 World Cup, the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism announced the permanent establishment of the Templestay program on July 2, 2002. The Order then established the Cultural Corps of Korean Buddhism on July 16, 2004 as an operative body to run the Templestay program. As the national government promised budget support, the number of temples operating a Templestay program grew from 31 in the first year to 110 in 2015. \n\nThe Templestay program is now recognized as one of the major tourist programs in Korea. In 2009, the OECD selected the Templestay program as one of the five most successful combinations of culture and tourism. \nAccording to statistics issued by the Cultural Corps of Korean Buddhism on May 29, 2011, a total of 700,000 people have experienced Templestay in the decade following 2002 when the program began. \n\nIn most temples this is the very first item on the schedule for Templestay participants. The aim of this guided tour around the temple for first-time visitors is to get to know the age-old traditions and culture of temples as well as the monastic lifestyle of Buddhist monks and nuns. In this way, participants are shown where the temple dining hall and public restrooms are and so they feel more at home. As they are led through the various buildings and structures of the temple, they discover firsthand the beauty of monastic architecture, paintings, handicrafts and landscaping, and so see many things that they might have otherwise missed. The guide often tells ancient stories behind many of the buildings and art as well as the temple itself. \n\nSeon meditation (chamseon) is similar to other forms of meditation. However, it does differ in one particular respect and that is that chamseon’s goal is to achieve single-minded absorption through the illogical doubt raised by a hwadu (the punch-line to a koan) so that the rambling mind is momentarily quieted. It is one of the most important practices of Korean Buddhism. A chamseon session usually consists of 50 minutes of Seon meditation followed by 10 minutes of slow and fast walking (pohaeng or gyeonghaeng). Depending on the temple and the program, longer or shorter periods of meditation are offered in which participants learn the aim and method as well as correct posture.\n\nSometime in the afternoon or evening, when monastics are not so busy with daily tasks, one of them invites the Templestay participants to drink tea. For monastics, all aspects of the day are a part of Buddhist practice, and drinking tea is considered an important one. This is the time for participants to enjoy a moment with monastics while asking questions about temples or monastic life or even requesting advice about how to live better. Participants may have the opportunity to view the world through the eyes of Buddhist practitioners and even reassess their own lives and improve their well being.\n\nIn Korean Buddhism, “gongyang” means “offering.” During a meal one reflects deeply on the countless people and efforts that have brought the food that one receives. In this way, one learns to be grateful for even a single spoonful of rice.\n\nBefore the meal, everyone recites a verse which teaches participants how to reflect upon the Buddha’s teachings that are embodied in the act of receiving food. Everyone eats from a set of bowls called “baru” as monastics do, and they are told not to waste a single grain of rice out of respect for the offering. \n\nIn the daily routine of Korean temples, the most important event is the Buddhist ceremony called yebul. This ceremony refers to paying respect to the Buddhas enshrined in the Dharma halls three times a day and repeating the teachings, usually before dawn, 10 a.m., and in the evening. Yebul is also called the “ceremony of five fragrances (obunhyangnye)” because participants reaffirm the five virtues that practitioners hope to perfect. Yebul is the ceremony that regulates the day and is attended by everyone possible in the temple compound.\n\nDifferent instruments are used to symbolically call all beings to join the ceremony. First of all the large bell is sounded, next the drum calls all animals, then the wooden fish for the water-dwelling animals and finally the cloud-shaped gong for the animals of the air. The ceremony continues with a re-affirmation of the refuge we take in the various Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and generations of Seon Patriarchs. Then follows the recitation of the Heart Sutra and the Wishes for the welfare of the temple and all people (Barunmoon). \n\nAnother major practice of Korean Buddhism is bowing. This practice consists of 3 bows, 108 bows, 1,080 bows or 3,000 bows and aims at ridding the practitioner of greed and attachment. The 108 bows is an act of atonement for one’s recognized ignorance and cravings, and the 108 kinds of afflictions that arise within them. In this respect, the 108 bows symbolize a fresh start as well and so one empties the illusions one has come to believe to make up one’s “self” and earnestly fills the void with new good intentions. \n\nIn Buddhism, lotus flowers symbolize Buddha Nature, the potential to become enlightened, which we all possess. Just as lotus flowers are not stained with the mud in which they grow, ignorant sentient beings can reveal their inherent Buddha Nature once awakened.\n\nKorean Buddhism holds the Lotus Lantern Festival every year on the Buddha’s Birthday, which falls on the eighth day of the fourth lunar month. Buddhists handcraft their own lanterns (which are unique to Korean Buddhism), which represent purification and wisdom. The way each petal of thin paper is glued to the paper cup, one by one with great care by Templestay participants, is meant to be a reminder of Buddhists’ fervent wish to persevere in becoming less selfish and more compassionate.\n\nThere is also a huge lantern parade through the center of Seoul and cultural performances until late at night during this national festival.\n"}
{"id": "31275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31275", "title": "The Age of Reason", "text": "The Age of Reason\n\nThe Age of Reason; Being an Investigation of True and Fabulous Theology is a work by English and American political activist Thomas Paine, arguing for the philosophical position of Deism. It follows in the tradition of eighteenth-century British deism, and challenges institutionalized religion and the legitimacy of the Bible. It was published in three parts in 1794, 1795, and 1807.\n\nIt was a best-seller in the United States, where it caused a short-lived deistic revival. British audiences, fearing increased political radicalism as a result of the French Revolution, received it with more hostility. \"The Age of Reason\" presents common deistic arguments; for example, it highlights what Paine saw as corruption of the Christian Church and criticizes its efforts to acquire political power. Paine advocates reason in the place of revelation, leading him to reject miracles and to view the Bible as an ordinary piece of literature rather than as a divinely inspired text. It promotes natural religion and argues for the existence of a creator-god.\n\nMost of Paine's arguments had long been available to the educated elite, but by presenting them in an engaging and irreverent style, he made deism appealing and accessible to the masses. Originally distributed as unbound pamphlets, the book was also cheap, putting it within the reach of a large number of buyers. Fearing the spread of what they viewed as potentially revolutionary ideas, the British government prosecuted printers and book-sellers who tried to publish and distribute it. Nevertheless, Paine's work inspired and guided many free thinkers.\n\nPaine's book followed in the tradition of early eighteenth-century British deism. These deists, while maintaining individual positions, still shared several sets of assumptions and arguments that Paine articulated in \"The Age of Reason\". The most important position that united the early deists was their call for \"free rational inquiry\" into all subjects, especially religion. Saying that early Christianity was founded on freedom of conscience, they demanded religious toleration and an end to religious persecution. They also demanded that debate rest on reason and rationality. Deists embraced a Newtonian worldview, and they believed that all things in the universe, even God, must obey the laws of nature. Without a concept of natural law, the deists argued, explanations of the workings of nature would descend into irrationality. This belief in natural law drove their skepticism of miracles. Because miracles had to be observed to be validated, deists rejected the accounts laid out in the Bible of God's miracles and argued that such evidence was neither sufficient nor necessary to prove the existence of God. Along these lines, deistic writings insisted that God, as the first cause or prime mover, had created and designed the universe with natural laws as part of his plan. They held that God does not repeatedly alter his plan by suspending natural laws to (miraculously) intervene in human affairs. Deists also rejected the claim that there was only one revealed religious truth or \"one true faith\"; religion could only be \"simple, apparent, ordinary, and universal\" if it was to be the logical product of a benevolent God. They therefore distinguished between \"revealed religions\" (which they rejected), such as Christianity, and \"natural religion\", a set of universal beliefs derived from the natural world that demonstrated God's existence (they were, thus, not atheists).\n\nWhile some deists accepted revelation, most argued that revelation's restriction to small groups or even a single person limited its explanatory power. Moreover, many found the Christian revelations in particular to be contradictory and irreconcilable. According to these writers, revelation could reinforce the evidence for God's existence already apparent in the natural world, but more often it led to superstition among the masses. Most deists argued that priests had deliberately corrupted Christianity for their own gain by promoting the acceptance of miracles, unnecessary rituals, and illogical and dangerous doctrines (these accusations were typically referred to as \"priestcraft\"). The worst of these doctrines was original sin. By convincing people that they required a priest's help to overcome their innate sinfulness, deists argued, religious leaders had enslaved the human population. Deists therefore typically viewed themselves as intellectual liberators.\n\nBy the time Part I of \"The Age of Reason\" was published in 1794, many British and French citizens had become disillusioned by the French Revolution. The Reign of Terror had begun, Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette had been tried and executed and Britain was at war with France. Those few British radicals who still supported the French revolution and its ideals were viewed with deep suspicion by their countrymen. \"The Age of Reason\" belongs to this later, more radical stage of the British political reform movement, one that openly embraced republicanism and atheism and is exemplified by such texts as William Godwin's \"Political Justice\" (1793). By the middle of the decade, the moderate voices had disappeared: Richard Price, the Dissenting minister whose sermon on political liberty had prompted Edmund Burke's \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\" (1790), had died in 1791, and Joseph Priestley had been forced to flee to America after a Church–and–King mob burned down his home and church.\n\nThe conservative government, headed by William Pitt, responded to this increasing radicalization by prosecuting several reformers for seditious libel and treason in the famous 1794 Treason Trials. Following the trials and an attack on George III, conservatives were successful in passing the Seditious Meetings Act and the Treasonable Practices Act (also known as the \"Two Acts\" or the \"gagging acts\"). These acts prohibited freedom of assembly for groups such as the radical London Corresponding Society (LCS) and encouraged indictments against radicals for \"libelous and seditious\" statements. Afraid of prosecution and disenchanted with the French revolution, many reformers drifted away from the cause. The LCS, which had previously unified religious Dissenters and political reformers, fractured when Francis Place and other leaders helped Paine publish \"The Age of Reason\"; the society's more religious members withdrew in protest and the LCS lost around one-fifth of its membership.\n\nIn December 1792, Paine's \"Rights of Man, part II\" was declared seditious in Britain and he was forced to flee to France in order to avoid arrest. Dismayed by the French revolution's turn toward secularism and atheism, he composed Part I of \"The Age of Reason\" in 1792 and 1793:\n\nAlthough Paine wrote \"The Age of Reason\" for the French, he dedicated it to his \"Fellow Citizens of the United States of America\", alluding to his bond with the American revolutionaries.\n\nIt is unclear when exactly Paine drafted Part I although he says in the preface to Part II:\n\nAccording to Paine scholars Edward Davidson and William Scheick, he probably wrote the first draft of Part I in late 1793, but Paine biographer David Hawke argues for a date of early 1793. It is also unclear whether or not a French edition of Part I was published in 1793. François Lanthenas, who translated \"The Age of Reason\" into French in 1794, wrote that it was first published in France in 1793, but no book fitting his description has been positively identified. Barlow published the first English edition of \"The Age of Reason, Part I\" in 1794 in London, selling it for a mere three pence.\n\nMeanwhile, Paine, considered too moderate by the powerful Jacobin wing of the French revolutionaries, was imprisoned for ten months in France. He only escaped the guillotine by accident: the sign marking him out for execution was improperly placed on his cell door. When James Monroe, at that time the new American Minister to France, secured his release in 1794, Paine immediately began work on Part II of \"The Age of Reason\", despite his poor health. Part II was first published in a pirated edition by H.D. Symonds in London in October 1795. In 1796 Daniel Isaac Eaton published Parts I and II, and sold them at a cost of one shilling and six pence. (Eaton was later forced to flee to America after being convicted of seditious libel for publishing other radical works.) Paine himself financed the shipping of 15,000 copies of his work to America. Later, Francis Place and Thomas Williams collaborated on an edition which sold about 2,000 copies. Williams also produced his own edition, but the British government indicted him and confiscated the pamphlets.\n\nIn the late 1790s, Paine fled from France to the United States, where he wrote Part III of \"The Age of Reason\": \"An Examination of the Passages in the New Testament, Quoted from the Old and Called Prophecies Concerning Jesus Christ\". Fearing unpleasant and even violent reprisals, Thomas Jefferson convinced him not to publish it in 1802; five years later Paine decided to publish despite the backlash he knew would ensue.\n\nFollowing Thomas Williams's sentence of one year's hard labor for publishing \"The Age of Reason\" in 1797, no editions were sold openly in Britain until 1818 when Richard Carlile included it in an edition of Paine's complete works. Carlile charged one shilling and sixpence for the work, and the first run of 1,000 copies sold out in a month. He immediately published a second edition of 3,000 copies. Like Williams, he was prosecuted for seditious libel and blasphemous libel. The prosecutions surrounding the printing of \"The Age of Reason\" in Britain continued for thirty years after its initial release and encompassed numerous publishers as well as over a hundred booksellers.\n\n\"The Age of Reason\" is divided into three sections. In Part I, Paine outlines his major arguments and personal creed. In Parts II and III he analyzes specific portions of the Bible in order to demonstrate that it is not the revealed word of God.\n\nAt the beginning of Part I of the \"Age of Reason\", Paine lays out his personal belief:\n\nPaine's creed encapsulates many of the major themes of the rest of his text: a firm belief in a creator-God; a skepticism regarding most supernatural claims (miracles are specifically mentioned later in the text); a conviction that virtues should be derived from a consideration for others rather than oneself; an animus against corrupt religious institutions; and an emphasis on the individual's right of conscience.\n\nPaine begins \"The Age of Reason\" by attacking revelation. Revelation, he maintains, can only be verified by the individual receivers of the message and is therefore weak evidence for God's existence. Paine rejects prophecies and miracles, writing: \"it is revelation to the first person only, and hearsay to every other, and consequently they are not obliged to believe it\". He also points out that the Christian revelations appear to have altered over time to adjust for changing political circumstances. Urging his readers to employ reason rather than to rely on revelation, Paine argues that the only reliable, unchanging and universal evidence of God's existence is the natural world. \"The Bible of the Deist\", he contends, should not be a human invention such as the Bible, but rather a divine invention—it should be \"creation\". Paine takes this argument even further, maintaining that the same rules of logic and standards of evidence that govern the analysis of secular texts should be applied to the Bible. In Part II of \"The Age of Reason\", he will do just this, pointing out numerous contradictions in the Bible. For example Thomas Paine notes, \" The most extraordinary of all the things called miracles, related in the New Testament, is that of the devil flying away with Jesus Christ, and carrying him to the top of a high mountain, and to the top of the highest pinnacle of the temple, and showing him and promising to him all the kingdoms of the World. How happened it that he did not discover America, or is it only with kingdoms that his sooty highness has any interest? \"\n\nAfter establishing that he would refrain from using extra-Biblical sources to inform his criticism, but would instead apply the Bible's own words against itself, Paine questions the sacredness of the Bible, analyzing it as one would any other book. For example, in his analysis of the Book of Proverbs he argues that its sayings are \"inferior in keenness to the proverbs of the Spaniards, and not more wise and economical than those of the American Franklin\". Describing the Bible as \"fabulous mythology\", Paine questions whether or not it was revealed to its writers and doubts that the original writers can ever be known (he dismisses the idea that Moses wrote the Pentateuch or that the Gospel's authors are known, for example).\n\nUsing methods that would not become common in Biblical scholarship until the nineteenth century, Paine tested the Bible for internal consistency and questioned its historical accuracy, concluding that it was not divinely inspired.\n\nPaine also argues that the Old Testament must be false because it depicts a tyrannical God. The \"history of wickedness\" pervading the Old Testament convinced Paine that it was simply another set of human-authored myths. He deplores people's credulity: \"Brought up in habits of superstition,\" he wrote, \"people in general know not how much wickedness there is in this pretended word of God.\" Citing Numbers 31:13–47 as an example, in which Moses orders the slaughter of thousands of boys and women, and sanctions the rape of thousands of girls, at God's behest, Paine calls the Bible a \"book of lies, wickedness, and blasphemy; for what can be greater blasphemy than to ascribe the wickedness of man to the orders of the Almighty!\"\n\nPaine also attacks religious institutions, indicting priests for their lust for power and wealth and the Church's opposition to scientific investigation. He presents the history of Christianity as one of corruption and oppression. Paine criticizes the tyrannical actions of the Church as he had those of governments in the \"Rights of Man\" and \"Common Sense\", stating that \"the Christian theory is little else than the idolatry of the ancient Mythologists, accommodated to the purposes of power and revenue.\" This kind of attack distinguishes Paine's book from other deistic works, which were less interested in challenging social and political hierarchies. He argues that the Church and the State are a single corrupt institution which does not act in the best interests of the people—both must be radically altered:\n\nAs Jon Mee, a scholar of British radicalism, writes: \"Paine believed ... a revolution in religion was the natural corollary, even prerequisite, of a fully successful political revolution.\" Paine lays out a vision of, in Davidson and Scheick's words, \"an age of intellectual freedom, when reason would triumph over superstition, when the natural liberties of humanity would supplant priestcraft and kingship, which were both secondary effects of politically managed foolish legends and religious superstitions.\" It is this vision that scholars have called Paine's \"secular millennialism\" and it appears in all of his works—he ends the \"Rights of Man\", for example, with the statement: \"From what we now see, nothing of reform in the political world ought to be held improbable. It is an age of revolutions, in which everything may be looked for.\" Paine \"transformed the millennial Protestant vision of the rule of Christ on earth into a secular image of utopia,\" emphasizing the possibilities of \"progress\" and \"human perfectibility\" that could be achieved by humankind, without God's aid.\n\nAlthough Paine liked to say that he read very little, his writings belie this statement; \"The Age of Reason\" has intellectual roots in the traditions of David Hume, Spinoza, and Voltaire. Since Hume had already made many of the same \"moral attacks upon Christianity\" that Paine popularized in \"The Age of Reason\", scholars have concluded that Paine probably read Hume's works on religion or had at least heard about them through the Joseph Johnson circle. Paine would have been particularly drawn to Hume's description of religion as \"a positive source of harm to society\" that \"led men to be factious, ambitious and intolerant\". More of an influence on Paine than Hume was Spinoza's \"Tractatus Theologico-politicus\" (1678). Paine would have been exposed to Spinoza's ideas through the works of other eighteenth-century deists, most notably Conyers Middleton.\n\nThough these larger philosophical traditions are clear influences on \"The Age of Reason\", Paine owes the greatest intellectual debt to the English deists of the early eighteenth century, such as Peter Annet. John Toland had argued for the use of reason in interpreting scripture, Matthew Tindal had argued against revelation, Middleton had described the Bible as mythology and questioned the existence of miracles, Thomas Morgan had disputed the claims of the Old Testament, Thomas Woolston had questioned the believability of miracles and Thomas Chubb had maintained that Christianity lacked morality. All of these arguments appear in \"The Age of Reason\", albeit less coherently.\n\nThe most distinctive feature of \"The Age of Reason\", like all of Paine's works, is its linguistic style. Historian Eric Foner argues that Paine's works \"forged a new political language\" designed to bring politics to the people, using a \"clear, simple and straightforward\" style. Paine outlined \"a new vision—a utopian image of an egalitarian republican society\" and his language reflected these ideals. He originated such phrases as \"the rights of man\", \"the age of reason\", \"the age of revolution\", and \"the times that try men's souls\". Foner also maintains that with \"The Age of Reason\" Paine \"gave deism a new, aggressive, explicitly anti-Christian tone\".\n\nHe did this by employing \"vulgar\" (that is, \"low\" or \"popular\") language, an irreverent tone, and even religious rhetoric. In a letter to Elihu Palmer, one of his most loyal followers in America, Paine describes part of his rhetorical philosophy:\n\nPaine's rhetoric had broad appeal; his \"pithy\" lines were \"able to bridge working-class and middle-class cultures\" and become common quotations.\n\nPart of what makes Paine's style so memorable is his effective use of repetition and rhetorical questions in addition to the profusion of \"anecdote, irony, parody, satire, feigned confusion, folk matter, concrete vocabulary, and ... appeals to common sense\". Paine's conversational style draws the reader into the text. His use of \"we\" conveys an \"illusion that he and the readers share the activity of constructing an argument\". By thus emphasizing the presence of the reader and leaving images and arguments half-formed, Paine encourages his readers to complete them independently.\n\nThe most distinctive element of Paine's style in \"The Age of Reason\" is its \"vulgarity\". In the eighteenth century \"vulgarity\" was associated with the middling and lower classes and not with obscenity; thus, when Paine celebrates his \"vulgar\" style and his critics attack it, the dispute is over class accessibility, not profanity. For example, Paine describes the Fall this way:\n\nThe irreverent tone that Paine combined with this vulgar style set his work apart from its predecessors. It took \"deism out of the hands of the aristocracy and intellectuals and [brought] it to the people\".\n\nPaine's rhetorical appeal to \"the people\" attracted almost as much criticism as his ridicule of the Bible. Bishop Richard Watson, forced to address this new audience in his influential response to Paine, \"An Apology for the Bible\", writes: \"I shall, designedly, write this and the following letters in a popular manner; hoping that thereby they may stand a chance of being perused by that class of readers, for whom your work seems to be particularly calculated, and who are the most likely to be injured by it.\" But it was not only the style that concerned Watson and others, it was also the cheapness of Paine's book. At one sedition trial in the early 1790s, the Attorney–General tried to prohibit Thomas Cooper from publishing his response to Burke's \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\", arguing that \"although there was no exception to be taken to his pamphlet when in the hands of the upper classes, yet the government would not allow it to appear at a price which would insure its circulation among the people.\"\n\nPaine's style is not only \"vulgar\", it is also irreverent. For example, he says that once one dismisses the false idea of Moses being the author of Genesis, \"The story of Eve and the serpent, and of Noah and his ark, drops to a level with the Arabian tales, without the merit of being entertaining.\" Although many early English deists had relied on ridicule to attack the Bible and Christianity, theirs was a refined wit rather than the broad humor Paine employed. It was the early Deists of the middling ranks, and not the educated elite, who initiated the kind of ridicule Paine would make famous.\n\nIt was Paine's \"ridiculing\" tone that most angered Churchmen. As John Redwood, a scholar of deism, puts it: \"the age of reason could perhaps more eloquently and adequately be called the age of ridicule, for it was ridicule, not reason, that endangered the Church.\" Significantly, Watson's \"Apology\" directly chastises Paine for his mocking tone:\nPaine's Quaker upbringing predisposed him to deistic thinking at the same time that it positioned him firmly within the tradition of religious Dissent. Paine acknowledged that he was indebted to his Quaker background for his skepticism, but the Quakers' esteem for plain speaking, a value expressed both explicitly and implicitly in \"The Age of Reason\", influenced his writing even more. As the historian E. P. Thompson has put it, Paine \"ridiculed the authority of the Bible with arguments which the collier or country girl could understand\". His description of the story of the virgin birth of Jesus demystifies biblical language: it is \"an account of a young woman engaged to be married, and while under this engagement she is, to speak plain language, debauched by a ghost\". Quaker conversion narratives also influenced the style of \"The Age of Reason\"; Davidson and Scheick argue that its \"introductory statement of purpose, a fervid sense of inward inspiration, a declared expression of conscience, and an evangelical intention to instruct others\" resemble the personal confessions of American Quakers.\n\nPaine takes advantage of several religious rhetorics beyond those associated with Quakerism in \"The Age of Reason\", most importantly a millennial language that appealed to his lower-class readers. Claiming that true religious language is universal, Paine uses elements of the Christian rhetorical tradition to undermine the hierarchies perpetuated by religion itself. The sermonic quality of Paine's writing is one of its most recognizable traits. Sacvan Bercovitch, a scholar of the sermon, argues that Paine's writing often resembles that of the jeremiad or \"political sermon\". He contends that Paine draws on the Puritan tradition in which \"theology was wedded to politics and politics to the progress of the kingdom of God\". One reason Paine may have been drawn to this style is because he may have briefly been a Methodist preacher, although this suspicion cannot be verified.\n\n\"The Age of Reason\" provoked a hostile reaction from most readers and critics, although the intensity of that hostility varied by locality. There were four major factors for this animosity: Paine denied that the Bible was a sacred, inspired text; he argued that Christianity was a human invention; his ability to command a large readership frightened those in power; and his irreverent and satirical style of writing about Christianity and the Bible offended many believers.\n\nPaine's \"Age of Reason\" sparked enough anger in Britain to initiate not only a series of government prosecutions but also a pamphlet war. Around 50 unfavorable replies appeared between 1795 and 1799 alone and refutations were still being published in 1812. Many of these responded specifically to Paine's attack on the Bible in Part II (when Thomas Williams was prosecuted for printing Part II, it became clear its circulation had far exceeded that of Part I). Although critics responded to Paine's analysis of the Bible, they did not usually address his specific arguments. Instead, they advocated a literal reading of the Bible, citing the Bible's long history as evidence of its authority. They also issued \"ad hominem\" attacks against Paine, describing him \"as an enemy of proper thought and of the morality of decent, enlightened people\". Dissenters such as Joseph Priestley who had endorsed the arguments of the \"Rights of Man\" turned away from those presented in \"The Age of Reason\". Even the liberal \"Analytical Review\" was skeptical of Paine's claims and distanced itself from the book. Paine's deism was simply too radical for these more moderate reformers and they feared being tarred with the brush of extremism.\n\nDespite the outpouring of antagonistic replies to \"The Age of Reason\", some scholars have argued that Constantin Volney's deistic \"The Ruins\" (translations of excerpts from the French original appeared in radical papers such as Thomas Spence's \"Pig's Meat\" and Daniel Isaac Eaton's \"Politics for the People\") was actually more influential than \"The Age of Reason\". According to David Bindman, \"The Ruins\" \"achieved a popularity in England comparable to \"Rights of Man\" itself\". One minister complained that \"the mischief arising from the spreading of such a pernicious publication [as \"The Age of Reason\"] was infinitely greater than any that could spring from limited suffrage and septennial parliaments\" (other popular reform causes).\n\nIt was not until Richard Carlile's 1818 trial for publishing \"The Age of Reason\" that Paine's text became \"the anti-Bible of all lower-class nineteenth-century infidel agitators\". Although the book had been selling well before the trial, once Carlile was arrested and charged, 4,000 copies were sold in just a few months. At the trial itself, which created a media frenzy, Carlile read the entirety of \"The Age of Reason\" into the court record, ensuring it an even wider publication. Between 1818 and 1822, Carlile claimed to have \"sent into circulation near 20,000 copies of the \"Age of Reason\"\". Just as in the 1790s, it was the language that most angered the authorities in 1818. As Joss Marsh, in her study of blasphemy in the nineteenth century, points out, \"at these trials plain English was reconfigured as itself 'abusive' and 'outrageous.' The \"Age of Reason\" struggle almost tolled the hour when the words 'plain,' 'coarse,' 'common,' and 'vulgar' took on a pejorative meaning.\" Carlile was convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to one year in prison, but spent six years instead because he refused any \"legal conditions\" on his release.\n\nPaine's new rhetoric came to dominate popular nineteenth-century radical journalism, particularly that of freethinkers, Chartists and Owenites. Its legacy can be seen in Thomas Wooler's radical periodical \"The Black Dwarf\", Richard Carlile's numerous newspapers and journals, the radical works of William Cobbett, Henry Hetherington's periodicals the \"Penny Papers\" and the \"Poor Man's Guardian\", the works of the Chartist William Lovett, George Holyoake's newspapers and books on Owenism, and freethinker Charles Bradlaugh's \"New Reformer\". A century after the publication of \"The Age of Reason\", Paine's rhetoric was still being used: George Foote's \"\"Bible Handbook\" (1888) ... systematically manhandles chapters and verses to bring out 'Contradictions,' 'Absurdities,' 'Atrocities,' and 'Obscenities,' exactly in the manner of Paine's \"Age of Reason\".\" The periodical \"The Freethinker\" (founded in 1881 by George Foote) argued, like Paine, that the \"absurdities of faith\" could be \"slain with laughter\".\n\n\"The Age of Reason\", despite having been written for the French, made very little, if any, impact on revolutionary France. Paine wrote that \"the people of France were running headlong into atheism and I had the work translated into their own language, to stop them in that career, and fix them to the first article ... of every man's creed who has any creed at all – \"I believe in God\"\" (emphasis Paine's). Paine's arguments were already common and accessible in France; they had, in a sense, already been rejected.\n\nWhile still in France, Paine formed the Church of Theophilanthropy with five other families; this civil religion held as its central dogma that man should worship God's wisdom and benevolence and imitate those divine attributes as much as possible. The church had no priest or minister, and the traditional Biblical sermon was replaced by scientific lectures or homilies on the teachings of philosophers. It celebrated four festivals honoring St. Vincent de Paul, George Washington, Socrates, and Rousseau. Samuel Adams articulated the goals of this church when he wrote that Paine aimed \"to renovate the age by inculcating in the minds of youth the fear and love of the Deity and universal philanthropy\". The church closed in 1801, when Napoleon concluded a concordat with the Vatican.\n\nIn the United States, \"The Age of Reason\" initially caused a deistic \"revival\", but was then viciously attacked and largely forgotten. Paine became so reviled that he could still be maligned as a \"filthy little atheist\" by Theodore Roosevelt over one hundred years later.\n\nAt the end of the eighteenth century, America was ripe for Paine's arguments. Ethan Allen published the first American defense of deism, \"Reason, The Only Oracle of Man\" (1784), but deism remained primarily a philosophy of the educated elite. Men such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson espoused its tenets, while at the same time arguing that religion served the useful purpose of \"social control\". It was not until the publication of Paine's more entertaining and popular work that deism reached into the middling and lower classes in America. The public was receptive, in part, because they approved of the secular ideals of the French Revolution. \"The Age of Reason\" went through seventeen editions and sold thousands of copies in the United States. Elihu Palmer, \"a blind renegade minister\" and Paine's most loyal follower in America, promoted deism throughout the country. Palmer published what became \"the bible of American deism\", \"The Principles of Nature\", established deistic societies from Maine to Georgia, built Temples of Reason throughout the nation, and founded two deistic newspapers for which Paine eventually wrote seventeen essays. Foner writes that \"\"The Age of Reason\" became the most popular deist work ever written. ... Before Paine it had been possible to be both a Christian and a deist; now such a religious outlook became virtually untenable.\" Paine presented deism to the masses and, as in Britain, educated elites feared the consequences of such material in the hands of so many. Their fear helped to drive the backlash which soon followed.\n\nAlmost immediately after this deistic upsurge, the Second Great Awakening began. George Spater explains that \"the revulsion felt for Paine's \"Age of Reason\" and for other anti-religious thought was so great that a major counter-revolution had been set underway in America before the end of the eighteenth century.\" By 1796 every student at Harvard was given a copy of Bishop Watson's rebuttal of \"The Age of Reason\". In 1815, Parson Weems, an early American novelist and moralist, published \"God's Revenge Against Adultery\", in which one of the major characters \"owed his early downfall to reading 'PAINE'S AGE OF REASON'\". Paine's \"libertine\" text leads the young man to \"bold slanders of the bible\", even to the point that he \"threw aside his father's good old family bible, and for a surer guide to pleasure took up the AGE OF REASON!\"\n\nPaine could not publish part III of \"The Age of Reason\" in America until 1807 because of the deep antipathy against him. Hailed only a few years earlier as a hero of the American Revolution, Paine was now lambasted in the press and called \"the scavenger of faction\", a \"lilly-livered sinical rogue\", a \"loathsome reptile\", a \"demi-human archbeast\", \"an object of disgust, of abhorrence, of absolute loathing to every decent man except the President of the United States [Thomas Jefferson]\". In October 1805 John Adams wrote to his friend Benjamin Waterhouse, an American physician and scientist:\n\nAdams viewed Paine's \"Age of Reason\" not as the embodiment of the Enlightenment but as a \"betrayal\" of it. Despite all of these attacks, Paine never wavered in his beliefs; when he was dying, a woman came to visit him, claiming that God had instructed her to save his soul. Paine dismissed her in the same tones that he had used in \"The Age of Reason\": \"pooh, pooh, it is not true. You were not sent with any such impertinent message. ... Pshaw, He would not send such a foolish ugly old woman as you about with His message.\"\n\n\"The Age of Reason\" was largely ignored after 1820, except by radical groups in Britain and freethinkers in America, among them Robert G. Ingersoll and the American abolitionist Moncure Daniel Conway, who edited his works and wrote the first biography of Paine, favorably reviewed by \"The New York Times\". Not until the publication of Charles Darwin's \"The Origin of Species\" in 1859, and the large-scale abandonment of the literal reading of the Bible that it caused in Britain, did many of Paine's ideas take hold. As writer Mark Twain said, \"It took a brave man before the Civil War to confess he had read the \"Age of Reason\"...I read it first when I was a cub pilot, read it with fear and hesitation, but marveling at its fearlessness and wonderful power.\" Paine's criticisms of the church, the monarchy, and the aristocracy appear most clearly in Twain's \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\" (1889).\n\nPaine's text is still published today, one of the few eighteenth-century religious texts to be widely available. Its message still resonates, evidenced by Christopher Hitchens's statement that \"if the rights of man are to be upheld in a dark time, we shall require an age of reason\". His ends with the claim that \"in a time ... when both rights and reason are under several kinds of open and covert attack, the life and writing of Thomas Paine will always be part of the arsenal on which we shall need to depend.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

An organisation founded in 2012 by a group from London, England, \"Who is Hussain\" seeks to \"[let] the world know about an inspirational man who lived fourteen-hundred years ago.\" Primarily through public advertising, including tube posters on the London Underground, billboards in prominent urban areas and leaflet hand-outs, volunteers refer members of the public to the organisation's website. The organisation's stated vision is \"to see a world inspired by the unique personality of Hussain: his actions and his compassion for those around him.\"\n\nHussain, son of Ali and Fatimah and the grandson of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, lived 1400 years ago in Arabia, and is recognized as an important figure in Islam, as he was a member of the Ahl al-Bayt (the household of Prophet Muhammad) and Ahl al-Kisa, as well as being the third Shia Imam. He is most well known for his death in the battle of Karbala, 61 A.H./680 AD, in which Hussain and his companions fought the caliph Yazid and his army of circa 30,000. \"Who is Hussain\" cites this battle as epitomising Hussain's greatest qualities, saying that while Hussain had little or no hope of victory for himself, it was hoped the stand would shake the nation's conscience to battle the injustice and immorality Hussain felt present in Arabia. According to \"Who is Hussain\" the battle of Karbala laid the foundations for the overthrow of the Caliph's dynasty.\n\nThe organisation also seek to highlight other stories of Hussain's life to promote compassion, honour and integrity. For example, \"a celebrated example was when he and his brother Hassan cared tirelessly for a poor blind man they came upon in their city, in spite of traditional social expectations.\n\nThe event of Karbala holds a core concern with water shortage, this is why supply of water is provided without considering race or religion. The organization donated 30,000 bottles of water to the Red Cross in Flint Michigan during the water contamination crisis in early 2016. A similar move was also arranged in India at local level with the motivation that Hussain stands as a timeless example for all irrespective of their faith or color Repeating the tradition of water supply, team of volunteers to introduce their campaign distributed the bottles of water tagged with information about Hussain Ibn Ali in Seattle, Washington, US. \n\nWHOISHUSSAIN.ORG\n\n\"Who is Hussain's\" website is the group's main platform for sharing the message of Hussain ibn Ali, which explains the full story of Hussain's life, details of how to get involved in promoting the campaign, famous quotes of Hussain, merchandise and how to request an information pack.\n\nUpon launch in 2012, the website was widely shared on Facebook and Twitter. Since its launch in December 2012, the website has had over 100,000 unique hits from over 30 countries.\n\nOver time the organisation began to gain international recognition. In 2013, \"Who is Hussain\" began to accumulate global representatives. These representatives are local ambassadors for the organisation with a twofold purpose: (i) the organisation of local advertising promoting \"Who is Hussain\" and in particular its website and (ii) putting on goodwill and charitable events in honour of and 'inspired by' Hussain ibn Ali. Examples of these initiatives include blood donation drives, initiating food collections for the homeless and winter coat collections for the elderly.\n\nAs at December 2014, \"Who is Hussain\" had 68 representatives in cities across the globe. Each representative liaises with the central London team on a periodic basis. Representatives span cities in five continents including Chicago, Ottawa, Sydney, Adelaide, Birmingham, Karachi, Stockholm, Cape Town and Christchurch.\n\nIn November 2014, \"Who is Hussain\" launched a campaign entitled '#TeamGiveBack'. The aim of the campaign was to engage with the public on social media to identify how Hussain ibn Ali inspired them. The public was invited to donate to Iraq Relief Fund (Iraq being the site of Hussain's shrine). \"Who is Hussain\" encouraged individuals to 'give back' to the community. A variety of events were organised by \"Who is Hussain\" global representatives, including the donation of care packages to the homeless and blood donation drives\n\n\n"}
