It was released as a CD single on June 16, 2008 by Relentless Records and became the first Top 40 hit for the band in the UK. A music video was filmed for this song which was directed by D.A.R.Y.L of Pulse Films. A later re-release in North America the following year reached number 92 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, reached number 3 on the Alternative Songs chart and number 8 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.\n\nThe song talks about three particular instances in which the narrator realizes \"there ain't no rest for the wicked.\" First, he encounters a prostitute asking if he desires to spend the night with her. The narrator proceeds to ask her why she does what she does. The chorus (her response) analyzes the main reasons why individuals follow the paths they follow (\"...Money don't grow on trees, I've got bills to pay, I've got mouths to feed...\"). The narrator, fifteen minutes later, is mugged by a criminal, whom he asks the same question and from whom he receives the same answer. Finally, upon turning on the television, the narrator sees a preacher being arrested for stealing the funds of his church. This is followed by a third chorus saying that everyone is the same and we all have no rest \"until we close our eyes for good.\"\n\nLead singer Matt Shultz stated the song was inspired by an old co-worker of his who at the time was a drug dealer. When Shultz asked him why he dealt drugs, the co-worker told him that \"There's no rest for the wicked.\" Shultz was a plumber at the time, and said that he wrote the lyrics on a piece of drywall which he found while working at his co-worker's house.\n\nThe song appeared in a commercial for the TNT series \"Leverage\"; in the 2010 film \"The Bounty Hunter\"; in an episode of \"The Vampire Diaries\" (\"Isobel\"); in a third-season episode of \"Jersey Shore\"; as the opening song of Canadian reality television series \"Yukon Gold\"; and for the opening sequence of the 2009 video game \"Borderlands\". It is also mentioned in \"Borderlands 2\". Cage the Elephant performed the song on national television on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\". In the pilot episode for FOX's \"Lucifer\", the song is in both the opening and closing scenes of the episode. It was also used in the Netflix series, \"13 Reasons Why\". Also used in Hawaii Five-0, Season 8, episode 1: \"A'ole e 'olelo mai ana ke ahi ua ana ia.\"\n\n"}

(\"FCC\"). It is one of a number of autonomous national TFPs which claims to form \"the world's largest anticommunist and antisocialist network of Catholic inspiration.\"\n\nFounded in 1973, it is one of many \"Tradition, Family and Property\" groups (TFPs) and like-minded organizations worldwide, all of which are inspired by the work of the Brazilian intellectual, politician and activist Plinio Corrêa de Oliveira. The first American group was incorporated in 1975, and established its first hermitage in 1977 in Yonkers, New York. The Yonkers location was subsequently closed, with the hermits establishing their permanent hermitage on 70 acres in Spring Grove, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Foundation for a Christian Civilization (\"Foundation\") was incorporated in 1973, drawing on earlier ties between Brazilians, who traveled to the US to develop a North American affiliate. The American TFP developed early connections with leaders of the religious and political right, including Paul Weyrich of the Heritage Foundation and the Free Congress Foundation and Morton Blackwell of the College Republican National Committee and the Reagan administration. Founded to help fundraising for a Catholic counterrevolution against communism, it subsequently becoming a civil cultural organization that aims to uphold and promote the values of Christian civilization. The Foundation later merged in June 1992 with American TFP to form a single corporation identified as The Foundation for a Christian Civilization. Following the death of the founder in 1995, the American TFP split away from the original ideals of the Brazilian TFP.\n\nThe American TFP is staffed by approximately 75 full-time members and employees. It claims, with its affiliated America Needs Fatima campaign, to have more than 120,000 members nationwide. The organization's national headquarters are in Spring Grove, Pennsylvania, with regional offices in Chicago, Illinois; McLean, Virginia; Lafayette, Louisiana; Orange County, California; Hazleton, Pennsylvania; and Rossville, Kansas.\n\nThe organization solicits funds as a non-profit charity, not as a diocesan organization.\" Its annual public reports to the Internal Revenue Service indicate that between 2002 and 2014 it dispersed $1,800,000 to support the St. Louis de Montfort Academy and $1,500,000 to support related organizations in North and South America, most significantly Canada Needs Our Lady, Associação dos Fundadores and the \"Tradición y Acción\" organizations of Colombia and Peru.\n\nThe American TFP's worldview is based on Oliveira's 1959 essay, \"Revolution and Counter-Revolution\". According to the aims laid out in this book, TFP acts to oppose what Oliveira believed was an anti-Christian process that had undermined Christian civilization since the 14th century, the \"Revolution\" of the study's title. Oliveira considered that this \"Revolution\" had three phases which progressively undermined the Church and social order:\n\n\nThe American TFP promotes what it sees as the values of Christianity, and opposes liberal and egalitarian ideas, policies, and trends in both society as a whole and in the Catholic Church. While supporting selected elements of Catholic teaching, the group also argues for the need for authentic elites in society that raise, above all, the moral tone of general society, as witnessed by Oliveira's \"Nobility & Analogous Traditional Elites in the Allocutions of Pius XII\". In this book, Oliveira seeks to counter the \"preferential option for the poor\" found in Catholic social teaching and in Liberation theology, with support for the natural elite that exists in all societies, following the teaching of Pius XII, that they may become the obligated class working for the good of society (Noblesse Oblige).\n\nAccording to some commenters, including traditionalist Catholic sources, TFP claims \"to move from Christian principles, but they tend\nto move in the political arena\". Ardently anti-Communist, the group's interpretation of Catholic teaching led it to voice its opposition to the Vatican's policy of rapprochement with Communism.\n\nThe American TFP actively promotes its views through newspaper advertisements, direct mail, leafleting, public meetings, and 'caravans', groups of volunteers that spread TFP's message to the public at large. Its campaigns cover a wide range of issues, including the sexual abuse scandals in the Catholic Church, Islam and 9/11, just war, abortion, euthanasia, embryonic stem cell research, homosexuality and same-sex marriage, and homosexuals in the military. In addition, TFP also supports creation science and intelligent design. The group also protests against films and plays that it views as blasphemous, including Jean-Luc Godard's 1985 film \"Hail Mary\", Scorsese's 1988 film \"The Last Temptation of Christ\", McNally's 1998 play \"Corpus Christi\", Kevin Smith's 1999 film \"Dogma\", and Dan Brown's \"The Da Vinci Code\". In October 1999, TFP local coordinators carried out 300 protests at movie theaters against \"Dogma\", and have mobilized 17,000 volunteers to hand out over 5 million protest fliers.\n\nThe group has also been involved in other public and political actions, such as protesting the 2009 invitation to President Barack Obama to deliver the commencement address at the University of Notre Dame. The president of TFP, Raymond E. Drake, wrote a letter to the president of Notre Dame, Fr. John Jenkins, concerning this issue, expressing \"great perplexity and grief...that a priest of Holy Mother Church and president of one of America's most outstanding and emblematic Catholic universities would invite a manifestly pro-abortion president to give the commencement address and receive an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. TFP has continued its ties with the political right as a participating sponsor of the Conservative Political Action Conference and by signing statements issued by the Heartland Institute that opposed housing finance reform legislation and discussions of climate change in comprehensive energy legislation and in the State Department funding authorization.\n\nTFP Student Action is the university campus outreach of the TFP. Its activities include distributing fliers and other literature on the streets of universities, sponsoring speakers on campuses, hosting student conferences, and organizing protests and petitions, especially against the provision of information about abortion and the acceptance of LGBT students at Catholic universities. Its most recent campaign is against the 96 Catholic colleges and universities that allow LGBT student groups. In April 2009, volunteers of TFP Student Action traveled to the major cities of New Hampshire and Maine to distribute literature against same-sex marriage.\n\nThe American TFP provides the staff to run Saint Louis de Montfort Academy, a boys' boarding school in Herndon, Pennsylvania, that provides students with a traditional Catholic education. It also operates Call to Chivalry summer camps, which express Oliveira's nostalgic medieval view of nobility, chivalry, and the imagined glory of the feudal past.\n\nThe American TFP has been cited in several article by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) for their anti-LGBTQ views. According to the SPLC the TFP is a “virulently anti-LGBT group.”\n\n\n"}

{"id": "969947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=969947", "title": "Bridget Loves Bernie", "text": "Bridget Loves Bernie\n\nBridget Loves Bernie is an American sitcom created by Bernard Slade. Depicting an interfaith marriage between a Catholic woman and a Jewish man, \"Bridget Loves Bernie\" was based loosely on the premise of the 1920s Broadway play and 1940s radio show \"Abie's Irish Rose\". It stars Meredith Baxter and David Birney as the title characters. It was canceled by CBS after only one season, despite high ratings.\n\nBaxter and Birney married in real life after the program went off the air.\n\nThe series depicted an interfaith marriage between an Irish Catholic teacher (Bridget) from a wealthy family and a Jewish cab driver (Bernie), whom she had met at a bus stop. With a primetime slot between \"All in the Family\" and \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" on Saturday nights, the situation comedy was #5 in the ratings among all shows for the 1972-73 television season and obtained a 24.2 rating, tying with \"The NBC Sunday Mystery Movie.\" However, CBS executives canceled the show in response to negative reactions to the characters' marriage, making it the highest-rated television program to be canceled after only one season.\n\nSupporting cast members included Audra Lindley, David Doyle, Harold J. Stone, Ned Glass, and Bibi Osterwald. Lindley and Doyle played Bridget's wealthy parents, Walter and Amy Fitzgerald, and Stone and Osterwald played Bernie's working class parents, Sam and Sophie Steinberg. The Steinbergs owned a delicatessen above which Bridget and Bernie lived. Glass played Bernie's uncle, Moe Plotnik. Actor Robert Sampson played Bridget's brother, Catholic priest Father Michael Fitzgerald; he was more sympathetic than others to his sister's marriage. Bill Elliott played Otis, Bernie's best friend and fellow cab driver. Nora Marlowe was cast as Aunt Agnes in the 1972 episode \"The Little White Lie That Grew and Grew\".\n\n\nThe series was controversial due to the differing faiths of the married characters. Some Jewish groups charged that the series \"mocked the teachings of Judaism.\" Rabbi Wolfe Kelman, executive vice-president of the Rabbinical Assembly of America, called the show “an insult to some of the most sacred values of both the Jewish and Catholic religions.\" Rabbi Meir Kahane dedicated full columns to the episode. Orthodox rabbis met with CBS officials several times. A conservative rabbi organized a boycott by advertisers, and reform rabbis met with CBS staff in secret to have the show cancelled. Rabbi Abraham Gross, president of the Rabbinical Alliance of Orthodox Rabbis and Educators, described the show as a \"flagrant insult\" to Jews, protesting that intermarriage was strictly forbidden under Jewish law. Threats followed. Meredith Baxter said, \"We had bomb threats on the show. Some guys from the Jewish Defense League came to my house to say they wanted to talk with me about changing the show.\" Threatening phone calls made to the home of producer Ralph Riskin resulted in the arrest of Robert S. Manning, described as a member of the Jewish Defense League. Manning was later indicted on murder charges, and fought extradition to the U.S. from Israel, where he had moved. \n\nOn December 4, 2012, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the complete series on DVD in Region 1. This is a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release, available exclusively through Amazon.com and WBShop.com and only in the US.\n\n"}

It stars Jim Carrey as Bruce Nolan, a down-on-his-luck TV reporter who complains to God (Morgan Freeman) that he is not doing his job correctly, and is offered the chance to try being God himself for one week.\n\nIt is Shadyac and Carrey's third collaboration, having previously worked together on \"\" in 1994 and \"Liar Liar\" in 1997. It co-stars Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter, Philip Baker Hall and Steve Carell, and received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nWhen released in American theaters in May 2003 it opened to $85.9 million, making it the best Memorial Day opening weekend of any film in history at the time. The film surprised film pundits when it beat \"The Matrix Reloaded\" the following weekend. By the end of its theatrical run, it made $242 million domestically and a total $484 million worldwide, making it the fifth highest-grossing film of 2003.\n\n\"Evan Almighty\", a spin-off sequel focusing on Carell's character, with Shadyac and Oedekerk returning to direct and write, and Freeman also reprising his role, was released in 2007.\n\nBruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a television field reporter for Eyewitness News at WKBW-TV in Buffalo, New York, but desires to be the news anchorman instead. Bruce is in a relationship with his girlfriend, Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston), but he also has a mild crush on his co-worker, Susan Ortega (Catherine Bell). However, Bruce suffers from constant bad luck and reaches his breaking point when he is passed over for promotion by his rival, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), who later steals dialogue from an unaired segment by Bruce while accepting the promotion on air. This causes Bruce himself to aggressively and insanely criticize the station during his first live report, and he is promptly fired. Following a series of other misfortunes (getting beaten up by a group of street thugs who vandalize his car, and later plowing his car into a street post), Bruce takes out his frustration on God, blaming Him and claiming that He is \"the one who should be fired.\"\n\nBruce later receives a message on his pager directing him to an empty warehouse, where he meets God (Morgan Freeman). God offers to give Bruce His job to see if Bruce can do a better job. God gives Bruce two rules that he must follow: Bruce cannot tell anyone else that he is God, and Bruce cannot use his powers to interfere with free will. Initially, Bruce becomes jubilant with the powers, using them for personal gain such as getting revenge on the street gang that assaulted him earlier, transforming his clothes and his damaged car into a Saleen S7 and sexually impressing Grace.\n\nBruce also finds ways of using the powers to cause miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events that he covers, such as discovering the body of Jimmy Hoffa, earning him his job back, and causing a meteor to harmlessly land near a Mark Twain-themed chili cook-off. Bruce, still wanting the anchor position as well as wanting to get revenge on Evan Baxter for taunting him, uses his powers to make Evan humiliate himself on air, causing Evan to be replaced in favor of Bruce as the new anchor.\n\nAfter taking Grace to a fancy dinner and telling her about his promotion (disappointing her, as she thought he was going to propose), Bruce begins to hear voices in his head. He re-encounters God, who explains that the voices are prayers to God, and that Bruce must deal with them. Bruce creates an e-mail system to receive prayers and respond to them - but finds that the influx is far too great for him to handle, even with the use of his powers. So he sets the program to automatically answer \"Yes\" to every prayer, thinking this will make everyone happy.\n\nDuring a party to celebrate Bruce's promotion, Susan seduces and kisses him. When Grace arrives and sees this, she angrily storms out; Bruce follows her, but she is heartbroken and won't listen to him. He tries to use his powers to convince Grace to stay, but cannot influence her free will. As Bruce looks around, he realizes that automatically granting everyone's prayers has plunged the city into chaos. Bruce returns to God, who explains that despite how chaotic things seem, there is always a way to make things right, and that Bruce must figure out a way to solve it himself. Bruce then begins to solve his problems in life practically, such as helping a man whose car has broken down, potty training his dog properly, and allowing Evan to have his job back.\n\nBruce returns to his computer system, having briefly unplugged it, and he finds many prayers from Grace about Bruce. As he reads them, another prayer from Grace arrives, this one wishing not to be in love with Bruce anymore. A despondent Bruce walks alone on a highway, asking God to take back His powers and letting his fate be in His hands. Bruce is suddenly struck by a truck and regains consciousness in a white void.\n\nGod appears and tells Bruce to pray for what he truly wants; Bruce prays for Grace to find a man that would make her happy. God agrees and Bruce finds himself in the hospital, shortly after being miraculously revived by the doctors. Grace arrives and the two reconcile. After his recovery, Bruce returns to his field of reporting, but takes more pleasure in simple stories. Bruce and Grace announce their engagement on live television during a 'Be the Miracle' blood drive. The film ends with a homeless man holding a sign with philosophical messages that Bruce previously ran into on various occasions finally revealing himself to be God.\n\n\"Bruce Almighty\" received mixed reviews from critics. The film has a score of 49% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 188 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes, but \"Bruce Almighty\" gets bogged down in treacle\". The film also has a score of 46 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 35 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". The film was released in the United Kingdom on June 27, 2003, and topped the country's box office that weekend.\n\nThe film was banned in Egypt, due to the portrayal of God as a visually ordinary man. Bans in both Malaysia and Egypt were eventually lifted after the censorship boards in respective countries gave it the highest rating, (18-PL in the case of Malaysia).\n\nSince God contacts Bruce using an actual phone number rather than a number in the standard fictional 555 telephone exchange, several people and groups sharing this number subsequently received hundreds of phone calls from people wanting to talk to God, including a church in North Carolina (where the Minister was named Bruce), a Pastor in Northern Wisconsin and a man in Manchester, England. The producers noted that the number (776-2323) was not in use in the area code (716, which was never specified on screen) in the film's story but did not check anywhere else. The home video and television versions changed it to the fictional 555-0123.\n\nA spin-off/sequel, titled \"Evan Almighty\", was released on June 22, 2007, with Steve Carell reprising his role as Evan Baxter and Morgan Freeman returning to his role as God. Although Shadyac returned to direct the sequel, neither Carrey nor Aniston were involved with the film, and Carrey's character, Bruce, is never mentioned in the film. The sequel was not as well received as its predecessor, with a 23% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 37/100 score on Metacritic.\n\nThe soundtrack was released on June 3, 2003 by Varèse Sarabande. Tracks 8-13 are from the score composed by John Debney, performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony (conducted by Pete Anthony) with Brad Dechter and Sandy De Crescent.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8722998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8722998", "title": "Comparative theology", "text": "Comparative theology\n\nComparative theology is a relatively new discipline within theology, which holds together \"comparative\" and \"theology\" in creative tension. It represents a particular type of theological practice committed to deep interreligious learning (\"comparative\") while staying rooted in a particular religious tradition (\"theology\"). Moreover, while many of its proponents come from the Christian religious tradition, it can have as a starting point the theology of any religious tradition.\n\nFrancis X. Clooney, a leading figure within comparative theology, sees comparative theology essentially as \"faith seeking understanding\". He explains the distinctiveness of comparative theology by clarifying the relationship between comparative theology and the related disciplines of comparative religion, theology of religions, and interreligious dialogue.\n\nComparative theology shares with comparative religion an interest in the comparative study of religion. However, in contrast to comparative religion, which seeks to examine the similarities and differences between a variety of religious traditions from a neutral point of view, comparative theology focuses on the theological reflection of one's own religion in light of the insights from another religious tradition. Rather than emphasizing a religiously-detached position, comparative theology is deeply rooted in a particular religious tradition. Francis X. Clooney explains:\nComparative theology – comparative and theological beginning to end – marks acts of faith seeking understanding which are rooted in a particular faith tradition but which, from that foundation, venture into learning from one or more other faith traditions. This learning is sought for the sake of fresh theological insights that are indebted to the newly encountered tradition/s as well as the home tradition.\n\nComparative theology shares with theology of religions a theological interest in the encounter between Christian faith and other religions; but from a different angle, and with a different emphasis and aim. Theology of religion attempts to clarify the relationship between Christian faith and other religious traditions with regard to how other religions can be understood in light of normative claims of Christian faith, in particular, related to salvation and Christ. Theology of religion thus reflects from Christian theological claims, based on general descriptions of other religious traditions. In contrast to this, comparative theology is a theology of religious learning. It emphasizes an in-depth study of the particularities of other religious traditions instead of basing itself on general descriptions. \"Comparative theology is not primarily about which religion is the true one, but about learning across religious borders in a way that discloses the truth of my faith, in the light of their faith.\"\n\nComparative theology shares with interreligious dialogue a commitment to engage in dialogue and listen carefully to the religious other. It must, however, go further than just listening: \"The comparative theologian must do more than listen to others explain their faith; she must be willing to study their traditions deeply alongside her own, taking both to heart.\"\n\nThe unique character of comparative theology derives from its sources and methodology.\n\nComparative theology works with two types of religious sources. While rooted in one tradition, comparative theology has its foundation also in at least one additional religious tradition. Clooney describes comparative theology. . . as truly constructive theology, distinguished by its sources and ways of proceeding, by its foundation in more than one tradition (although the comparativist always remains rooted in one tradition), and by reflection which builds on that foundation, rather than simply on themes or by methods already articulated prior to comparative practice.\nComparative theology is dialectical practice. The comparison starts with a critical study of the other religion. This first step involves a persistent and disciplined in-depth study of the other religious tradition where the theologian exposes herself to the sacred texts of the other tradition. The comparative theologian practices \"hermeneutical openness\" in a manner where comprehension should precede judgment. This implies a \"bracketing\" of subjective commitments / theological judgments, allowing the other religious tradition to speak as much as possible on its own terms. It is a practice of making oneself \"vulnerable to intellectual, imaginative, affective transformation.\"\n\nThe comparison, in turn, becomes a conversation with your own tradition. The insights emerging from the encounter with the other religious tradition might influence the conceptual framework for interpreting your own tradition, causing a reconsideration of your Christian identity. Correlations are made between the two traditions, which might imply recognition of similarities or recognition of differences. At this point \"the 'normative theological judgments' that were temporarily suspended are brought back into the hermeneutical circle.\" Grounds are provided for raising more profound theological questions, conversation with other theologians, and potentially leading to new theological construction. This theological procedure resonates with Clooney's claim thatComparative theology is a theology deeply changed by its attention to the details of multiple religious and theological traditions, a theology that occurs only after comparison.Contemporary theology has, so far, been mainly a text-based discipline, and comparative theologians engage primarily with texts from one religious tradition outside their own, due to the in-depth study that is required. Although associated with Christian theology, the approach applied in comparative theology is not particularly Christian and can be a practiced grounded in other religious traditions as well.\n\nComparative theology has historical forerunners in figures such as the Jesuit missionaries Francis Xavier and Roberto de Nobili.\n\nSince the 1980s, comparative theology has developed as a particular theological response to the growing religious diversity in the contemporary world. It has been introduced by Francis X. Clooney and James L. Fredericks, and is a methodology used by individuals such as David Tracy, Keith Ward, and Robert C. Neville. The discipline arose through the growing impact of Alan Race's three-fold understanding of theology of religions, that resulted in various arguments about the benefits of the models of theology of religions.\n\nA new generation of comparative theologians is today expanding the discourse, drawing it in new directions.\n\n"}

The two remixes available on the CD maxi and vinyl 12\" maxi are made by Nuzak.\n\nKurt Cobain of the hugely successful alternative rock group Nirvana praised the band in his posthumously published journals, but specifically the song \"Crucified.\"\n\nThe song was successful in several European countries, including Germany, Sweden, Austria and Switzerland, where it reached the top 10. It reached the #1 in Belgium. In the United States, \"Crucified\" became a huge club hit and radio favorite, debuting at #6 in the U.S. \"Billboard\" Dance singles chart and spending a total of 14 weeks in the Top-20.\n\nThe song was played in Gabriel Aghion's 1996 film, \"Pédale douce\", and was thus included in the track listing of the soundtrack. It was also played in the film \"Marock\" (2005).\n\nThe video for the song was featured in the third season episode of Beavis and Butthead \"Cleaning House\". The pair react favourably to the video when Camilla is on screen (mainly due to her breasts) but complain when the men appear.\n\nThe song was featured on the dance video game Just Dance 4.\n\nBard's future music project, Gravitonas uses a sample of this song on the track \"Sacrifice\" from their 2012 \"Black Ceremony EP\".\n\nIn 2013, Army of Lovers made a new version of the song, simply called 'Crucified 2013'. It contains new vocals from Dominika Peczynski.\n\nThe Swedish heavy metal band Ghost covered the song on their 2013 EP 'If You Have Ghost'.\n\nCassette single\n\nCD single\n\n7\" single\n\n12\" maxi-single\n\nCD single (UK re-issue)\n\nCD maxi (U.S.)\n\n12\" maxi (UK Re-issue)\n\n\nIn 2013, Swedish heavy metal band Ghost covered the song for their EP \"If You Have Ghost\".\n"}

Diksa is given in a one-to-one ceremony, and typically includes the taking on of a serious spiritual discipline. The word is derived from the Sanskrit root \"dā\" (\"to give\") plus \"kṣi\" (\"to destroy\") or alternately from the verb root \"dīkṣ\" (\"to consecrate\"). When the mind of the guru and the disciple become one, then we say that the disciple has been initiated by the guru.\nDiksa can be of various types, through the teacher's sight, touch, or word, with the purpose of purifying the disciple or student. Initiation by touch is called \"sparśa dīkṣā\". The bestowing of divine grace through diksa is sometimes called \"śaktipāt\".\n\nVishnu Yamala (tantra) says:\n\"The process that bestows divyam jnanam (transcendental, spiritual knowledge) and destroys sin (pāpa), the seed of sin and ignorance, is called diksha by the spiritual persons who have seen the Truth (desikais tattva-kovidaih).\"\n\nDifferent traditions and sects treat diksa in various ways. Tantra mentions five types of initiation or \"diksa\": initiation by a ritual or \"samaya-diksa\"; \"sparsa-diksa\" is an initiation by touch and is done without a ritual; \"vag-diksa\" is done by word or mantra; \"sambhavi-diksa\" is arising from perception of external appearance of the guru; \"mano-diksa\" is when initiation is performed in the mind. For ISKCON members first diksa, or \"harinama-diksa\" initiation, is performed as part of a fire sacrifice where grains, fruit, and ghee are placed on an open fire of the sacrifice. In the tradition of Lahiri Mahasaya, initiation into Kriya Yoga is given as diksa. The Bengali saint Anandamayi Ma often gave \"sparśa dīkṣā\" (divine touch) or \"drik\" diksa (through her look), in which she would bestow \"śaktipāt\" (divine grace).\n\nAnother type of diksa, into a monastic order, involves a vow of celibacy, renunciation of all personal possessions and of all worldly duties, including family ties. Diksha has the same meaning in Jainism. Diksha is also called \"Charitra\" or \"Mahanibhiskraman\" in Jainism.\nInitiation in Hinduism involves performing one of several rituals depending on the person being initiated and the Hindu group involved.\n\nVarious tantric works enumerate different types of disksha rituals: \n\nISKCON, for example, commonly advise those that want to be initiated into the movement to begin by repeatedly chanting the name of Krishna. This chanting is a sort of unofficial induction. The official initiation as a disciple occurs during an organized ceremony. Additionally, followers are required to wear a string of beads, or kanthi, around their neck.\n\nTranscendental Meditation (TM) began initiation under the guidance of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in the late 1950s. New members were initiated through a “devotional ritual (puja) whose focus was Brahmananda Saraswati and the Shankarcharya lineage. Initiates were given a specially suited mantra, and taught how to practice meditation.”\n\nBAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha initiates new members via a ritual known as vartman. This ritual involves taking water in the right palm and repeating a mantra that is spoken by the ritual initiator, often a renunciate. After the mantra is repeated, the water is poured away, signifying the acceptance of a lifestyle as established by the movement. A kanthi is adorned and vows are taken. Vows for new initiates include abstaining from meat, alcohol, adultery, stealing, and harmful addictive substances.\n\n"}

{"id": "16148460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16148460", "title": "Freedom of religion in Russia", "text": "Freedom of religion in Russia\n\nIn Russia, the prominence and authority of various religious groups is closely tied to the country's political situation. In the 10th century, Prince Vladimir I, who was converted by missionaries from Byzantium, embraced Christianity as the official Russian religion. For approximately 1,000 years thereafter, Russian Orthodoxy became the country’s primary denomination. \n\nAlthough the constitution of the former Soviet Union nominally guaranteed religious freedom, religious activities were greatly constrained and membership in religious organizations was considered incompatible with membership in the Communist Party. Thus, overt claims of religious beliefs was a hindrance to individual advancement. While open expression of Christian beliefs was permitted during World War II, because the government sought the support of Christians and Jews in the fight against fascism, restrictions were re-imposed when the war ended. \n\nIn the 1980s, under the reformist regime of Mikhail Gorbachev, a policy of glasnost () was declared, allowing greater tolerance for the unrestricted practice of religion. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, religious freedom was made a reality and revealed that large segments of the population continued to practice a variety of faiths. Russian nationalists who emerged in the 1990s identified the Russian Orthodox church as a major element of Russian culture. \n\nThe Russian government has a number of laws against religious extremism and foreign funding of non-government organizations including the Yarovaya Law, that can be used to restrict the practices of religious minorities, such as evangelism or the importation of foreign religious literature. Critics of these laws argue that the Russian government gives priority to the Russian Orthodox Church, making it into an unofficial state church.\n\nConditions improved for some minority religious groups while remaining largely the same for most, and government policy continued to contribute to the generally free practice of religion for most of the population. Some federal agencies, such as the Federal Registration Service, and many local authorities, continued to restrict the rights of a few religious minorities. Legal obstacles to registration under a complex 1997 Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations (the 1997 Law stating Orthodox Christianity, Jehovah's witnesses, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism as traditional religions) continued to seriously disadvantage some religious groups considered nontraditional. There were indications that the security services, including the Federal Security Service (FSB), treated the leadership of some Islamic groups as security threats.\n\nThere were reports of societal abuses and discrimination based on religious belief or practice. Religious matters were not a source of social tension or problems for the large majority of citizens, but there were some problems between majority and minority groups.\n\nResistance against non-Orthodox religions were behind manifestations of anti-Semitism and occasional friction with non-Orthodox Christian denominations. Conservative activists claiming ties to the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) occasionally disseminated negative publications and held protest meetings against religions considered nontraditional, including alternative Orthodox congregations. Some ROC clergy stated publicly their opposition to any expansion of the presence of Roman Catholics, Protestants, and other non-Orthodox denominations.\n\nThe country has an area of and a population of 142.8 million. In practice, only a minority of citizens actively participated in any religion. Many who identified themselves as members of a faith rarely participated in religious life or not at all. There is no single set of reliable statistics that breaks down the population by denomination, and the statistics below are compiled from government, polling, and religious group sources.\n\nApproximately 100 million citizens consider themselves Russian Orthodox Christians, although the vast majority are not regular churchgoers. The largest religious minority is formed by 14 to 23 million Muslims, most of whom live in the Volga-Urals region and the North Caucasus, although Moscow, St. Petersburg, and parts of Siberia and Yakutia have sizable Muslim populations. The Buddhist Association of Russia estimated that there were between 1.5 and 2 million Buddhists, who live in the traditionally Buddhist regions of Buryatiya, Tuva, and Kalmykiya. According to the Slavic Center for Law and Justice, Protestants make up the second-largest group of Christian believers, with 3,500 registered organizations and more than 2 million followers. There are an estimated 600,000 Jews (0.4% of the population), the vast majority of which live in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The Catholic Church estimated that there are 600,000 Catholics, most of whom are not ethnic Russians. In Yakutiya and Chukotka, pantheistic and nature-based religions are practiced independently or alongside other religions.\n\nAccording to Human Rights Ombudsman Vladimir Lukin's annual report, the Ministry of Justice had registered 22,956 religious organizations as of January 1, 2007, 443 more than in January 2006. Among the registered religious groups are Russian Orthodox, Orthodox Old Believers, Muslim, Buddhist, Jewish, Evangelical Christians, Catholic, and other denominations.\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice; however, in some cases the authorities imposed restrictions on certain groups, most often through the registration process. The Constitution also provides for the equality of all religions before the law and the separation of church and state; however, the Government did not always respect this provision.\n\nIn November 2006, the Government eliminated the value-added tax on religious products sold by religious organizations.\n\nThe Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations ( the 1997 Law) declares all religions equal before the law, prohibits government interference in religion, and establishes simple registration procedures for religious groups. The country is by law a secular state without a state religion. The preamble to the 1997 Law, however, acknowledges Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, and other religions as constituting an inseparable part of the country's historical heritage and also recognized the \"special contribution\" of Orthodoxy to the country's history and to the establishment and development of its spirituality and culture.\n\nThe 1997 Law creates three categories of religious communities (groups, local organizations, and centralized organizations) with different levels of legal status and privileges.\n\nThe most basic unit is the \"religious group\" which has the right to conduct worship services and rituals and to teach religion to its members. A group is not registered with the Government and consequently does not have the legal status to open a bank account, own property, issue invitations to foreign guests, publish literature, receive tax benefits, or conduct worship services in prisons, state-owned hospitals, and the armed forces. However, individual members of a group may buy property for the group's use, invite personal guests to engage in religious instruction, and import religious material. In principle, members of unregistered groups are thus able to rent public spaces and hold services, but in practice, they sometimes encountered significant difficulty in doing so.\n\nThe next level is the \"local religious organization\", which can be registered if it has at least 10 citizen members and is either a branch of a centralized organization or has existed in the locality as a religious group for at least 15 years. Local religious organizations have legal status and may open bank accounts, own property, issue invitation letters to foreign guests, publish literature, enjoy tax benefits, and conduct worship services in prisons, state-owned hospitals, and the armed forces.\n\n\"Centralized religious organizations\" can be registered by joining at least three local organizations of the same denomination. In addition to all the legal rights enjoyed by local organizations, centralized organizations also have the right to open new local organizations without any waiting period. Centralized organizations that have existed in the country for more than 50 years have the right to use the words \"Russia\" or \"Russian\" in their official names.\n\nThe 1997 Law gives officials the authority to ban religious groups and thereby prohibit all of the activities of a religious community. Following the passage of the law, groups that failed to re-register by December 31, 2000, became subject to legal dissolution (often translated as \"liquidation\"), i.e., deprivation of juridical status.\n\nThe 2006 Law on Public Associations (NGO or NPO Law) contains a few provisions that apply to religious organizations.\n\nThe NGO law grants the Ministry of Justice the authority to obtain certain documents, to send its representatives (with advance notice) to attend religious organization events, and to conduct an annual review of the organization's compliance with its registered mission statement. Religious organizations are required to inform the Federal Registration Service (FRS) of changes in leadership or address within 3 days of the changes taking effect. The law allows FRS to file suit against organizations that fail to comply with the law's requirements. If a court finds in favor of FRS, then the organization may be closed down. In addition, a contemporaneous amendment to the Civil Code may affect religious organizations, but the effect of this amendment and all other amendments remains to be seen. Some denominations with numerous local organizations feared that compliance with these changes would be highly burdensome.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses reported that federal officials used the NGO Law to investigate their headquarters, and that government officials told them the investigation was launched on the basis of this law.\n\nUnder the NGO law, religious organizations have new reporting requirements. These reporting requirements are extensive, and many NGOs and religious groups complained about the time and effort needed to complete them. The required reporting includes information about \"organized events and activities\" and accounts of funds received from international and foreign organizations, foreign citizens, and stateless persons. This generates difficulties for reporting anonymous donors. Failure to file reports and complete them adequately can result in warnings that may lead to the organization being closed down.\n\nAfter lobbying by many religious groups, including the ROC, the Government reduced the reporting requirements for all religious organizations and extended the financial reporting deadline of the NGO Law to June 1. Russian organizations are no longer asked whether they receive income from Russian individuals or the Russian state. Although each organization must still supply full names, addresses, and passport details of members belonging to its governing body, they no longer have to provide details of religious congresses, conferences or governing body meetings, including the number of participants. The accounting procedures have been significantly simplified.\n\nWhile neither the constitution nor the 1997 Law grants explicit privileges or advantages to the four \"traditional\" religions, in practice the ROC cooperates more closely with the Government than do other faiths. The ROC has entered into a number of formal and informal agreements with various government ministries that give the ROC far greater access than other religious groups to public institutions such as schools, hospitals, prisons, the police, and the army. ROC activities with the Government include support for the psychological rehabilitation of servicemen returning from conflict zones, the holding of religious services for those serving in conflict zones, and cooperation with the Ministry of Internal Affairs to combat extremism.\n\nThe ROC has special arrangements with government agencies to conduct religious education and to provide spiritual counseling. These include agreements with the Ministries of Education, Defense, Health, Internal Affairs, and Emergency Situations, and other bodies, such as the Federal Tax Service, Federal Border Service, and Main Department of Cossack Forces. Not all of the details of these agreements were accessible, but available information indicated that the ROC received preferential treatment.\n\nOfficials in law enforcement and the legislative branches spoke of protecting the \"spiritual security\" of the country by discouraging the growth of \"sects\" and \"cults\", usually understood to include some Protestant and newer religious movements. In January 2007, the Moscow City Prosecutor warned of the danger posed by extremist and dangerous new religious movements entering the country, and promised tough measures to stop their activities. To date, no such measures have been proposed or implemented.\n\nThe National Security Concept of the Russian Federation, last updated in 2000, states that \"ensuring national security includes countering the negative influence of foreign religious organizations and missionaries.\"\n\nRepresentative offices of foreign religious organizations are required to register with state authorities, and they may not conduct services or other religious activities unless they have acquired the status of a group or organization. In practice, many foreign religious representative offices opened without registering or were accredited to a registered religious organization.\n\nThe Moscow City Duma is proposing a law that would prohibit \"religion agitation\" in public. Administrative punishment for violations under this article would be approximately $4–20 (100-500 rubles).\n\nThe regions of Kabardino-Balkariya and Dagestan have laws banning extremist Islamic \"Wahhabism\", but there were no reports that authorities invoked these laws to deny registration to Muslim groups. However, the former president of the Kabardino-Balkaria republic ordered the closure of six of seven mosques in Nalchik, the region's capital. The new president of the region has reopened one mosque and announced plans to reopen another.\n\nOfficials of the Presidential Administration, regions, and localities maintain consultative mechanisms to facilitate government interaction with religious communities and to monitor application of the 1997 Law. At the national level, groups interact with a special governmental commission on religion, which includes representatives from law enforcement bodies and government ministries. On broader policy questions, religious groups continued to deal with the Presidential Administration through the Presidential Council on Cooperation with Religious Associations. The broad-based Council is composed of members of the Presidential Administration, secular academic specialists on religious affairs, and representatives of traditional and major nontraditional groups. Other governmental bodies for religious affairs include a Governmental Commission for the Affairs of Religious Associations, headed by the Minister of Culture and Mass Communications.\n\nAvenues for interaction with regional and local authorities also exist. The offices of some of the seven Plenipotentiary Presidential Representatives (Polpreds) include suboffices that address social and religious issues. Regional administrations and many municipal administrations also have designated officials for liaison with religious organizations. Religious minorities most often encounter problems at the regional level.\n\nThe Russian Academy of State Service works with religious freedom advocates, such as the Slavic Center for Law and Justice, to train regional and municipal officials in properly implementing the 1997 Law. The Academy opens many of its conferences to international audiences.\n\nThe Office of Federal Human Rights Ombudsman Vladimir Lukin has a department for religious freedom issues, which receives and responds to complaints. The Ombudsman's Office receives 200–250 religious freedom complaints annually, which represents thousands of alleged individual violations. The Office has determined that approximately 75 percent of these cases represent genuine violations of religious freedoms guaranteed under the law.\n\nContradictions between federal and local laws, and varying interpretations of the law, were used by some regional officials to restrict the activities of religious minorities. According to many observers, local governments are more susceptible to pressure from the local religious majority and therefore are more likely to discriminate against local minority religious communities. Many localities appeared to implement their own policies with very little federal interference. When the federal Government intervenes in local cases, it works through the Procuracy, Ministry of Justice, Presidential Administration, and the courts. The federal Government only occasionally intervened to prevent or reverse discrimination at the local level.\n\nIn July 2006, the country hosted the World Summit of Religious Leaders, where President Putin spoke to the participants about increasing religious tolerance. Officials met regularly during the reporting period with leaders of several faiths, including Christian, Muslim, and Jewish communities.\n\nThe federal Government does not require religious instruction in schools, but it continues to allow public use of school buildings after hours for the ROC to provide religious instruction on a voluntary basis. Several regions offer a course on Orthodoxy in public schools, and five regions (Kaluga, Tver, Bryansk, Smolensk, and Voronezh) have a mandatory class on the Fundamentals of Orthodox Culture. The Belgorod Oblast voluntary course can be avoided only if the parents themselves provide and pay for an alternative course. The course is offered as an elective in several other regions. In regions where the class is not mandatory, in practice students may be compelled to take it where schools do not provide alternatives. Minister of Education Andrey Fursenko warned against these lessons, and he proposed instead a course on \"world religions\" or on Orthodoxy. Fursenko's proposal remained controversial among some experts, including some in the ROC. Some regions offer a class on \"History of Religion\", a proposal that Fursenko suggested but did not introduce nationally. The Ministry of Education rejected continued publication and dissemination of a textbook that detailed Orthodox Christianity's contribution to the country's culture, with descriptions of some minority religions that members of those religions found objectionable; for example, the text's stance on Jews, certain non-traditional denominations, and foreigners is considered problematic by some. Some schools continued to use the text.\n\nThere is a universal military draft for men, but the Constitution provides for alternative service for those who refuse to bear arms for reasons of conscience. The length of alternative service is longer than the standard military service. The standard length of military service is 18 months, alternative service in a Ministry of Defense agency is 27 months, and alternative service in a nondefense agency is 31.5 months. Some human rights groups have complained that the extended length of service for draftees requesting alternative assignments acts as a punishment for those who exercise their convictions.\n\nIn July 2006, a new law came into effect that repeals deferrals for students of religious training institutions. The law was protested by many religious groups, including the ROC.\n\nThe 2002 Law on Extremism, amended in July 2006, can affect religious groups, particularly Muslim groups, by criminalizing a broad spectrum of activities. For example, Mansur Shangareev was convicted of extremism and sentenced to 2 years in prison for \"actively adhering to a radical trend of Islam\" that claimed superiority over mainstream Islam, and for making \"remarks to Muslim girls about their immodest dress\", among other things.\n\nThe 2006 amendments allow some charges of extremism where people are alleged to have defended or expressed sympathy with other individuals already charged with extremism.\n\nLaws against extremism have been tightened over time. The 2016 Yarovaya Law, named after politician Irina Yarovaya, extends the legal restrictions against extremism to include evangelism by minority faiths.\n\nOn May 5, 2015, customs authorities in Russia seized a shipment of religious literature containing Ossetian-language Bibles published by Jehovah's Witnesses. Russian customs officials in the city of Vyborg held up a shipment of 2,013 Russian-language copies of Bibles on July 13, 2015. Customs authorities confiscated three of the Bibles, sent them to an \"expert\" to study the Bibles to determine whether they contained \"extremist\" language, and impounded the rest of the shipment.\n\nOn July 21, 2015, the Russian Federation Ministry of Justice added Jehovah's Witnesses official website to the Federal List of Extremist Materials thereby making it a criminal offense to promote the website from within the country and requiring Internet providers throughout Russia to block access to the site.\n\nOn March 23, 2017, the Russian News Agency TASS reported, \"Russia's Justice Ministry has suspended the activities of the religious organization calling itself Administrative Center of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia due to its extremist activities.\" The Supreme Court of Russia is scheduled on April 5 to hear a request by the Russian Justice Ministry to declare Jehovah's Witnesses an extremist organization. If adopted, the ruling would ban the organization's activity across Russia and result in seizure of their property.\n\nRestrictions on religious freedom generally fall into four categories: registration of religious organizations, access to places of worship (including access to land and building permits), visas for foreign religious personnel, and government harassment of religious organizations or individuals. In the first three cases, religious communities rely upon government officials to grant them permission to assemble, own, or build property, or allow people into the country.\n\nMany of the difficulties that religious communities face are rooted in bureaucratic obstacles and corruption, not religious bigotry. While it is nearly impossible to discern if groups are being targeted because of their religious beliefs or because they are vulnerable to demands by corrupt officials, the net effect is a restriction on their ability to worship.\n\nFollowing the 1997 Law's registration deadline of 31 December, 2001, the Ministry of Justice began to legally dissolve approximately 2,000 organizations that had not re-registered, sometimes over the complaints of groups who claimed that they were still active. Complaints of involuntary dissolution have decreased as this wave of dissolutions has passed, and only a few remain to be contested in court.\n\nDue to legal restrictions, poor administrative procedures on the part of some local authorities or disputes between religious organizations, an unknown number of groups have been unable to register. Some religious groups registered as social organizations because they were unable to do so as religious organizations.\n\nIn June 2007, a St. Petersburg Court suspended and ordered The Scientology Centre in St. Petersburg to close. The Centre had refused to allow government officials to sit in on confidential \"auditing\" sessions and did not hand over confidential documents from these sessions when requested. Government authorities claimed to have a right to these inspections and documents under the new NGO law. The Centre continued to operate at the end of the period covered by this report.\n\nThe Unification Church was contesting the refusal of officials to re-register three local organizations. The Unification Church alleged that its registration process had been complicated by the requirements imposed by a broad range of government agencies, including the fire safety office, tax inspectors, and epidemiological inspectors. The Church also reported that federal authorities investigated its compliance with visa rules, and scrutinized missionaries' activities and property holdings.\n\nLocal authorities continued an investigation of the Jehovah's Witnesses Administrative Center—their national headquarters in St. Petersburg—in what the Jehovah's Witnesses described as a search for an excuse to shut down their operations. The authorities indicated to the Jehovah's Witnesses that any irregularity they found would be used as grounds to close the center. On 16 February, 2007, the center wrote to the Prosecutor General's Office expressing concern over the investigations, which had continued for more than 2 years. The St. Petersburg Prosecutor's Office, the Prosecutor General's Office, and the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman of the Russian Federation sent replies stating that the investigators had not exceeded their authority and had not violated the law.\n\nAs of December 2006, the Federal Registration Service had registered 407 Jehovah's Witnesses local organizations in 72 regions, but problems with registration continued in some areas, notably Moscow, where the Moscow Golovinskiy Intermunicipal District Court and the Moscow City Court (of appeal) have banned them since 2004. The Moscow community appealed the ban to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).\n\nIn June 2006, the FRS branch in Novosibirsk used the NGO law and found that a local Pentecostal church, the Word of Life, violated its charter by organizing a show in a Siberian military unit. The FRS sent a written notification to the church stating that if they violated their charter again, the FRS would file a suit to close the church.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) unanimously ruled against the Government on three religious freedom cases involving the registration of the Salvation Army, the Jehovah's Witnesses, and the Church of Scientology. In all three cases, the court unanimously determined that the Government violated its international obligations under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Other religious freedom cases against the Government were pending at the ECHR.\n\nIn \"Moscow Branch of the Salvation Army v. Russia\", the ECHR ruled in October 2006 that the Government's refusal to re-register the Moscow branch of the organization violated the right of assembly and freedom of religion of the Salvation Army. The Government paid $13,418 (10,000 euros) in damages and legal fees to the Salvation Army. The Salvation Army cannot re-register its Moscow branch, as the deadline for re-registration under the 1997 Religions Law was May 2000. They may only be re-registered by the Moscow Chief Directorate of the Ministry of Justice. It was the Chief Directorate that designated the Salvation Army as a paramilitary organization, and successfully argued in court that this prevented re-registration. The Supreme Court did not address this designation, nor did they remove it.\n\nIn the Jehovah's Witnesses case, Kuznetsov and Others v. Russia, the ECHR ruled in January 2007 that Chelyabinsk authorities had violated the rights of the Chelyabinsk Jehovah's Witnesses when they disrupted a worship meeting in 2000. The court ordered the Government to pay $121,486 (90,544 euros) to the Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nIn the Church of Scientology Moscow v. Russia, the ECHR ruled that Moscow authorities violated the religious freedom rights of the Church of Scientology under the European Convention on Human Rights by refusing to re-register their Moscow church. The Scientologists had applied to re-register 11 times with no success. The Government did not appeal, and the decision is final.\n\nLocal authorities refused to register Scientology centers as religious organizations in Dmitrovgrad, Izhevsk, and other localities. Since these centers have not been in existence for 15 years, they are by law ineligible to register as religious organizations and cannot perform religious services (although they were allowed to hold meetings and seminars). The Churches of Scientology in Surgut City and Nizhnekamsk (Tatarstan) filed suits with the ECHR contesting the refusal of officials to register the churches based on the 15-year rule. The ECHR found the suits admissible in June 2005 and combined the cases. The case awaited a final decision, which the Church of Scientology expected by the end of 2007.\n\nAccording to FRS statistics, there are 22,956 registered religious groups operating in the country, approximately half of which are affiliated with the ROC. In 2005, the last year for which statistics are available, authorities investigated the activities of 3,526 religious organizations during the 2005 calendar year. The Ministry of Justice sent notifications of violations to 2,996 religious organizations. The courts made decisions to liquidate 59 local organizations for violations of constitutional norms and federal legislation during that period.\n\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses alleged in some cases that authorities had consulted with the ROC in determining whether to approve their requests for registration.\n\nMany religious groups had difficulty acquiring land or permits to build houses of worship. Some local governments prevented religious groups from using venues suitable for large gatherings such as cinemas and government facilities.\n\nSome religious groups, particularly Jehovah's Witnesses, but also the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), Pentecostal congregations, and the Evangelical Christian Missionary Union, reported that local authorities in recent years denied them permission to acquire land on which to construct places of worship. Authorities continued to deny construction permits to several groups.\n\nMany non-traditional denominations frequently complained that they were unable to obtain venues for worship. Because they are small and often newly established, they often lacked the necessary resources to buy or rent facilities on the open market and must rely on government assistance. Because they are nontraditional, they frequently met opposition from the traditional communities and often were unable to find government officials who were willing to assist them in renting state-owned property. There were multiple reports of religious organizations who were not allowed to renew leases on public and private buildings. Increased competition for space in a growing economy and increasing real estate prices led many owners (public and private) to lease property to higher-paying clients, and in some cases, religious groups were refused outright at any price.\n\nRepresentatives of multiple Protestant groups spoke about increasing difficulty in extending existing leases or signing new leases for worship premises, the majority of which are still state-controlled. For example, administrations in Tikhoretsk and Volgograd refused to extend rental agreements with member churches of the Union of Christian Evangelical Missionaries, which used the spaces for worship.\n\nThe Word of Life Christian Church in Kaluga region faced great difficulties trying to build its church. The Church had been frequently visited by tax, fire, and other government inspectors. In December 2006, the mayor issued a decree to confiscate the Church's building and land, which would then be given to a foreign commercial developer. The Church's appeals to the governor, prosecutor, and police were unsuccessful, although the property had not been confiscated.\n\nThe NGO Sova Center reported at the end of the reporting period that the Vladimir Muslim community still was not able to obtain public land to build a mosque. In 2004, despite interference from the Vladimir city authorities, the congregation constructed a mosque on private land near a house that community members bought and used as a temporary prayer house. The mosque was called a community house and was used by the local community of Muslims even though it did not have room for all 25,000 members.\n\nThe Sochi mayor's office continued to deny the Muslim community authorization to build a new mosque; the current premises insufficiently accommodate the membership. Officials allotted land several times but never transferred it to the Muslim community. According to the regional government, authorities can allocate land for a mosque only after a public opinion survey indicates that the proposed location would not cause conflict. In March 2007 Abdul-Vakhed Niyazov, Chairman of the Sochi Russian Islamic Cultural Center, asked Presidential Representative to the Southern Federal District Dmitriy Kozak to investigate.\n\nOn 14 May, 2007, at a public hearing in the city of Murmansk, residents of the central city district voted to refuse the Jehovah's Witnesses permission to build a church in the city's downtown area. Mayor Mikhail Savchenko issued a statement noting that even though it was his preference that new places of worship be built outside of the city center, he regretted the lack of tolerance shown at the public hearing. Jehovah's witnesses in Dezershinsk, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast failed to obtain land for constructing a building of worship.\n\nReligious news sources claimed that authorities acting on behalf of the ROC sometimes prevented Orthodox churches not belonging to the ROC, including the True Orthodox, from obtaining or maintaining buildings for worship. In 2005 a church reconstructed and renovated by the Russian Orthodox Autonomous Church (ROAC) was transferred to the ROC Diocese of Stavropol. The subsequent protest by the ROAC culminated in the beating of Metropolitan Valentin (see the Abuse section) and threats to other ROAC clergy. The Zheleznogorsk City Administration subsequently promised to allot a new building to the ROAC, but had not done so by the end of the reporting period.\n\nThere was an ongoing conflict between the Moscow Hare Krishnas and the Government regarding allocating a plot of land for worship. In the first half of 2007, Moscow City authorities rescinded their allotment of land for the construction of a Krishna temple in the Moscow city center and instead allotted the Krishnas of land in the Moscow suburbs.\n\nSince Richen Ling, a Tibetan Buddhist community, lost its Moscow city center premises in 2004 due to a municipal construction project, it continued to rent facilities since it has been unable to secure a permanent house of worship.\n\nThe Unification Church reported difficulties in establishing a Eurasian Church Center in Moscow to coordinate church activities in the region. The authorities would not allow the church building to be occupied until an annex illegally built by the former owner was legalized. The church estimated that the building would remain closed for 2 years until all the necessary documentation was done.\n\nLocal officials have refused permission to build to a Catholic parish in Barnaul (Altai Region) and to a Muslim community in Sochi for more than 10 years.\n\nThe Church of Scientology reported that it sometimes had difficulties getting permits for large events in Moscow.\n\nIn October 2006 local authorities in Tyumen destroyed a building that was intended to house a mosque. The Muslim community had spent years working to receive ownership of the building, which had been a mosque before the 1917 revolution. The authorities had decided to give the building to the Muslim community earlier that year.\n\nIn June 2006, the city of Krasnodar demanded the demolition of a private home intended to host worship for an Evangelical group. The lower court upheld the city's decision. A court appeal was pending.\n\nIn January 2006, the district court in Astrakhan ordered the demolition of a mosque on an access road to the city. The construction of the mosque had been allowed by the mayor in 1998, but officials argued in 2006 that the land was zoned residential, that the mosque was illegally built, and that the community must demolish it. Following the failure of their appeal to the Russian Supreme Court, which upheld the demolition order and held the Muslim community must pay for the demolition itself, the Muslim community appealed to the ECHR, which agreed to hear the case.\n\nThe Emmanuel Pentecostal Church continued to face difficulties building its church in Moscow. The old House of Culture, which the Emmanuel church wants to convert into a prayer house and office building, sits on land that the local land committee agreed to rent to the church. Other local authorities opposed to that location for the church have up the registration of the land title, some on grounds that local public opinion is against the religious community involved. They refused to allow the building to be reconstructed as a church. On 26 March, 2007, arsonists set the building on fire.\n\nThe 1997 Law appeared to change the visa regime for religious and other foreign workers. Immediately after its implementation, nontraditional groups reported problems receiving long-term visas.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the number of foreign religious personnel experiencing visa and customs difficulties while entering or leaving the country decreased, although some problems continued. Authorities have deported or denied entry to religious workers with valid visas in the past. The Unification Church in Moscow appealed the January 2006 deportation of its founder and legal/spiritual advisor, Jack Corley, to the ECHR. By law he must remain outside of the country for at least 5 years, at which point he can reapply for residence. The ECHR appeal joined two similar cases involving deportations of Unification Church foreign missionaries. A member of the Japanese Unification Church invited to Ufa to make a presentation was detained by FSB officers and forced to buy tickets to Moscow for himself and an FSB officer for onward deportation to Japan. He appealed the deportation and won the right to re-enter.\n\nIn June 2007 the Government threatened to deport three Falun Gong followers to c, where they could face official persecution. The UN High Commission on Refugees arranged to have these practitioners resettled to other countries. On 28 March, 2007, officials deported a Falun Gong follower and her young daughter to China.\n\nIn December 2006, a Moscow court rejected the appeal against deportation of Sunday Adelaja, a leader of the Ukrainian \"Embassy of God.\" The court found Adelaja's deportation to be \"in the interests of state security.\" In May 2006, while traveling to Moscow in order to participate in a television program, Adelaja had been denied entry at a Moscow airport, despite having a multiple-entry visa.\n\nVisa problems decreased for some groups. Groups such as the LDS and Roman Catholic churches, among others, reported that the Government issued most of their clergy 1-year visas that may be extended to 5-year visas after they have entered the country. They reported that the administration of the visas had improved since the last reporting period. Foreign clergy are particularly important for the Roman Catholic Church, since there are few ordained Russian priests. Catholic authorities reported a decrease in visa problems for priests during the period covered by this report.\n\nMany religious groups were unable to regain property confiscated in the Soviet era and to acquire new property. The SOVA Center said the property problem was most prevalent among Muslims and Protestants.\n\nAlthough authorities have returned many properties used for religious services, including churches, synagogues, and mosques, all four traditional religions continued to pursue restitution cases. As of May 2007, the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade was preparing legislation on returning most religious property (except for a few cultural and historical treasures) to its pre-1917 owners.\n\nThe ROC appeared to have greater success reclaiming prerevolutionary property than other groups, although it still had disputed property claims. At the end of the reporting period, the Moscow Diocese of the ROC owned more than 1,400 buildings, up from 130 in 1998.\n\nProperty claims for the ROC are legally complicated, since there was no separation of church and state before the revolution. Most of the Orthodox church buildings that were returned to the ROC were not considered ROC property before 1917. The ROC was only entitled to use these buildings and theoretically could have been evicted, but there was no attempt to do so. The ROC fully owned only churches built, bought, or received after 1991.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Community reported 44 disputed properties, including the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Cathedral in Moscow. While most state-owned property was returned, the community had no success with buildings that had been privatized. The community continued to work with authorities in the federal and local levels to resolve these issues.\n\nMuslims in Beslan appealed to the Presidential Council for Cooperation with Religious Associations for the return of its Cathedral Mosque.\n\nThe Jewish community was still seeking the return of a number of synagogues and cultural and religious artifacts. The Federation of Jewish Communities reported that federal officials had been cooperative in the community's efforts to seek restitution of former synagogues, as had some regional officials, although some Jews asserted that the Government had returned only a small portion of the total properties confiscated during the Soviet period. The international Chabad Lubavitch organization repeatedly sought return of the Schneerson Collection, a large collection of revered religious books and documents of the Lubavitcher rebbes, which the authorities consider part of the country's cultural heritage.\n\nSome human rights groups and religious minorities accused the Procurator General of encouraging legal action against a number of minority religions and of giving official support to materials that are biased against Muslims, Jehovah's Witnesses, the LDS, and others. There were credible reports that individuals within the federal security services and other law enforcement agencies harassed certain minority religious groups, investigated them for purported criminal activity and violations of tax laws, and pressured landlords to renege on contracts. In some cases the security services were thought to have influenced the Ministry of Justice to reject registration applications.\n\nLaw enforcement officials in Kabardino-Balkariya reportedly kept lists of students who said Muslim prayers, had Muslim middle names, or who sent clips with Islamic themes through their mobile phones. During the reporting period, the Sova Center reported that in general the pressure on Muslims in Kabardino-Balkariya dropped with the appointment of the republic's new leadership.\n\nA school principal in Argayash allegedly forced a member of the Pentecostal church to resign from her kindergarten teaching post or else face criminal charges of maltreating children. Local news reports cited complaints from parents that implied that the teacher had been teaching about religion and alleged that she had physically mistreated them. Church officials maintained that these charges were fabricated and that she was actually removed due to her religious beliefs.\n\nIn June 2007 officials in the city of Uzlovaya banned a Christian music festival organized by local Baptist churches. The officials originally gave permission for the festival but revoked it after reportedly receiving phone calls from the local FSB. The mayor reportedly claimed not to have known that the festival was a religious event.\n\nIn May 2007 local authorities in the town of Revda, Murmansk Oblast ordered the closure of a Pentecostal drug and alcohol rehabilitation center for the homeless. Two members of the town council and a local Russian Orthodox priest first organized public opposition to the center and held a screening of a negative film about Pentecostals. Pentecostals were not invited to the public hearing that decided the issue; they showed up nonetheless and were booed by the approximately 800 participants. The town council then voted to close the center. The Pentecostals planned to appeal the matter to a court.\n\nOn December 25, 2006, a court found Viktor Tanakov, high priest of the ethnic Mari faith, guilty of incitement to religious and ethnic hatred for having written and distributed a brochure entitled \"The Priest Speaks\", which describes all world religions as \"demonic.\" He lost his appeal to the Supreme Court on 21 March, 2007.\n\nIn June 2007 a Moscow district court published a ban on the works of Said Nursi, a Turkish pacifist Islamic theologian. The ban, which was being appealed, was condemned by religious and human rights leaders. Ravil Gainutdin, Chairman of the Russian Council of Muftis, wrote an open letter to President Putin describing the Risale-i Nur ban as \"a crude violation of freedom of conscience in our country.\" Vladimir Lukin, the Human Rights Ombudsman, denounced the ban, saying that Nursi's works contained no trace of religious hatred or intolerance. In an open letter to the court, Lukin wrote that \"It is very important that we do not allow interference in the convictions and beliefs of millions of citizens on the poorly grounded, unproven pretext of fighting against extremism, as this really could provoke wide-scale violations of their right to freedom of belief.\"\n\nThere has been a trend of senior government officials showing support for those religious leaders who endorse them; this can lead to indirect discrimination. For example, in St. Petersburg, an Imam at Cathedral Mosque endorsed United Russia, which supported his plans for a second mosque in the city. At the same time, Muslims not part of Cathedral Mosque were unable to obtain permission to construct their own mosque in St. Petersburg. Governor Valentina Matviyenko noted in response to a letter of enquiry that this is in part because they are \"in a state of conflict\" with and \"follow a different trend of Islam\" from the Cathedral Mosque community.\n\nLocal authorities in St. Petersburg began an investigation of the Jehovah's Witnesses Administrative Center, their national headquarters, even before the 2006 NGO law's implementing regulations were published. The authorities indicated that any irregularity they found would cause them to close the center. Federal and local authorities continued their investigations of the center in 2007. On 16 February, 2007, the center wrote to the Prosecutor General's Office, expressing concern over the investigations, which had continued for more than 2 years. The St. Petersburg Prosecutor's Office, the Prosecutor General's Office, and the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman sent replies stating that the investigators had not exceeded their authority and had not violated the law.\n\nThe Government in practice gave preference to the ROC. Authorities permitted Orthodox chapels and priests on army bases. Protestant groups had more limited access to military facilities, while authorities largely banned Islamic services in the military and generally did not give Muslim conscripts time for daily prayers or alternatives to pork-based meals. Some recruits serving in the army reported that fellow servicemen insulted and abused them because they were Muslim.\n\nAlthough there are several laws addressing crimes motivated by ethnic or religious hatred, law enforcement agencies enforced these laws in an inconsistent, generally infrequent, and sometimes arbitrary manner.\n\nAuthorities rarely prosecuted or sentenced those arrested for attacks and vandalism against religious minorities, and they often failed to bring hate-crime charges even when religious bigotry was clearly involved. Some government officials denied that there was a problem with hate crimes, or if they did exist, they were manifestations of economic ills. Some government officials and human rights observers noted that, due to heavy caseloads, prosecutors chose to file easily proven charges of vandalism or hooliganism rather than risk an acquittal on the harder-to-prove hate-crime motive. The end result was that hate crime legislation was often not enforced.\n\nThe Government also used counter-terrorism to commit serious violations of religious freedom against the Muslim population. There were numerous cases of Muslims being prosecuted for extremism or terrorism even when they have no clear relation to such activities. These included individuals detained for possessing religious literature such as the Qur'an, or on the basis of evidence allegedly planted by the police. Some people suspected by local police of Islamic extremism allegedly were subjected to torture and ill-treatment.\n\nAccording to human rights groups, a Supreme Court decision to ban 15 Muslim groups for alleged ties to international terrorism made it easier for officials to arbitrarily detain Muslims for alleged connections to these groups.\n\nOn 24 May, 2007, during an interethnic brawl in Stavropol between hundreds of Russian and Chechen youths, Gelani Ayatev was badly beaten and soon after died of his injuries. Zaurbek Akhmadov, an eyewitness, said that riot troops and local police cheered on skinheads as they physically assaulted Ayatev, who had been handcuffed. Police then put Ayatev, still in handcuffs, and Akhmadov, who had been shot in the leg by police as he tried to help Ayatev, in the back of a police vehicle. According to Akmadov, the police refused to allow medical attention for Ayatev or Akmadov for more than an hour, and in response to Akhmadov's cries to help Ayatev and bring him to a doctor, the policemen answered \"Don't worry. He won't be shouting Allah Akbar anymore.\"\n\nIn the case where a suspect threw a Molotov cocktail at a synagogue in Saratov in May 2007, police were investigating it as a case of \"hooliganism\" rather than as a hate crime, and had not apprehended any suspects. They declared it may not have been clear to the perpetrator that the building was a synagogue.\n\nIn Saratov at the beginning of April 2007, when a Jewish community member's home was targeted in an arson attack and graffiti reading \"kikes to Israel\" was written on a fence near the synagogue, police investigators classified these incidents as \"hooliganism\" and had not detained any suspects as of May.\n\nIn February 2007 the court gave light prison sentences to five teenagers who beat and fatally stabbed a Jewish man in October 2005, a murder motivated by ethnic hatred.\n\nThere were isolated instances in which local officials detained individuals who were publicly discussing their religious views, but usually authorities resolved these instances quickly.\n\nOn 13 and 14 of May, 2007 police arrested and detained 15 members of the Voskresenye Baptist community in Ivanovo, who were holding an event in a movie theater, distributing the New Testament and Book of Psalms. The organizers of the event had a written agreement with the theater. The reason given for the inspection appeared erroneous. The police tried to intimidate the detainees and urged them not to attend Baptist meetings, stating it was a \"harmful sect.\"\n\nOn 31 March, 2006, residents of Novaya Adygeia village were prevented from going to their mosque for Friday prayers. Police and Adygeia militia blocked all the roads into the village, stopped cars, and searched Muslims. According to the Maykop mosque imam, police officers also allegedly assaulted and apprehended a group of young Muslims, including the imam; masked policemen dragged the group to minibuses and took them to the Interior Ministry's Anti-Organized Crime Department. The policemen beat and questioned them about why they wore beards and observed Islamic norms of hygiene. After the Muslims were detained for a night in prison, officials took them before a judge who ordered their immediate release. The NGOs Memorial and SOVA reported that government officials have harassed Muslims in Adygeia since summer 2005, including seizing religious literature, preventing congregants from attending Friday prayers, and warning them to stop attending the mosque.\n\nA complicated case regarding the disruption of an April 2006 meeting of Jehovah's Witnesses in Moscow was still pending. In April 2006 the Lyublino Police Department of Moscow disrupted a religious meeting of Jehovah's Witnesses, and officers detained and interrogated 14 male leaders of the congregation, taking their passports. Police refused to provide written reasons for their detention, reportedly physically assaulted their attorney Vitaly Sinyukov when he went to the police station to assist them, and threatened him at knife-point not to file a complaint. In June 2006 a Moscow district court found the detention of the plaintiffs unlawful but dismissed the remainder of the suit because the Jehovah's Witnesses did not have legal permission to hold the meeting. Both the Jehovah's Witnesses and the police appealed the decision, and on March 22, 2007, the court reversed the June 2006 decision and ruled that the detention had in fact been lawful. The Moscow City Court refused to allow the ECHR judgment Kuznetsov v. Russia to be introduced as evidence in the case.\n\nVitaliy Sinyukov filed a suit against the Lyublino District Police Department. On 20 April, 2006, the Lyublino District Court dismissed the complaint against the police without considering its merits. Sinyukov appealed, and on 13 July, 2006, the Moscow City Court reversed the ruling and returned the case to the Lyublino District Court for consideration. On 16 August, 2006, the Lyublino District Court again ruled to dismiss the case without considering its merits. Sinyukov appealed again, and on 14 December, 2006, the Moscow City Court reversed the ruling in part and again returned the case to the Lyublino District Court for partial consideration of its merits. The case was pending at the end of the reporting period.\n\nOn 24 December, 2006, local police and officials from the Chelyabinsk Emergencies and Youth departments raided a Pentecostal service at a private house in Argayash and demanded documents relating to the property and church. Police Colonel Ramil Galilullin told the press that the reason for the raid was a complaint by local citizens that children attended the Pentecostal church without parental permission. Following the raid, the authorities also conducted a fire inspection and fined the church for incorrect use of a stove and defective wiring. The Chelyabinsk region public prosecutor opened an investigation into the actions of the authorities in February 2007.\n\nFrom 1 July 2005 through 30 June, 2006, the courts convicted 46 Muslims, 29 of whom were in prison, for membership in Hizb-ut-Tahrir. Courts gave Anton (Abdullah) Stepanenko, an imam in Pyatigorsk (Stavropol Region), a suspended sentence, partially for inciting religious hatred. Stepanenko's lawyer maintained that he was not permitted to order a psychiatric assessment of a key witness with a long history of mental illness, or to cross-examine scholars responsible for an expert analysis which alleged that Islamic literature—with no proven link to Stepanenko personally—was extremist. Whereas criminal investigators reportedly claimed that Stepanenko was in possession of \"Wahhabi\" literature (a term widely and loosely used in the country to denote Islamic extremism), President Putin stated that \"Wahhabism in itself does not pose any threat.\"\n\nIn February 2006 local police in Kabardino-Balkariya started compiling a list of \"Wahhabis\" by going to educational institutions and noting the names of students who prayed regularly. Under the new government in that region, however, pressure against Muslims seemed to diminish.\n\nIn October 2005, following a dispute between the ROAC and the ROC over the ownership of St. Olga's Church (see Restrictions section), three armed men beat and attempted to kidnap the ROAC Metropolitan from his home. The FSB reportedly interrogated and threatened several ROAC clergy and members following this incident.\n\nThroughout 2005 tensions increased in Kabardino-Balkariya between Islamists and police. Police closed a large number of mosques, especially in areas declared \"liberated\" by Islamist militants. In October 2005, local militants joined Islamic militants loyal to the Chechen fighter Shamil Basayev and attacked and occupied government and police buildings in Nalchik. Several hundred militants were killed; many of the bodies have still not been returned to their families. Government officials said they arrested more than 60 persons on suspicion of participating in raids, while human rights groups claimed the number of detainees was higher and that most of them were not involved in the unrest.\n\nFollowing the 2004 hostage-taking in Beslan, police stepped up activity in the North Caucasus. Authorities allegedly charged increasing numbers of Muslims, both Russian citizens and citizens of the predominantly Muslim states bordering the country, with extremism. The NGO Memorial described 23 cases involving more than 80 individuals charged with extremism as \"trumped-up.\" Of these, 18 resulted in verdicts, only 1 of which was an acquittal.\n\nAccording to the Sova Center, on 19 April, 2005, police briefly detained and interrogated nine female students in Kabardino-Balkariya for wearing the hijab and studying the Qur'an as a group.\n\nWhile most detentions for religious practices were of Muslims, there were occasional reports of short-term police detentions of non-Muslims on religious grounds, but such incidents were generally resolved quickly. For example, local police frequently detained missionaries for brief periods throughout the country or asked them to cease their proselytizing activities, regardless of whether they were actually in violation of local statutes. During the reporting period, the Jehovah's Witnesses reported approximately 55 incidents, 21 of which took place in Moscow, in which authorities briefly detained their members or other citizens who were conducting lawful preaching activities.\n\nIn Vladimir Oblast, authorities inspected the property owned by the ROAC several times. In January 2006, FSB representatives seized about 20 files with documentation on ROAC ownership without informing ROAC leaders or giving any reasons.\n\nAs of now there are several religious prisoners including a Dutch man. \n\nThere were no reports of forced religious conversion.\n\nRacially motivated violent attacks against Jews decreased during the reporting period, despite an increase in racist violence targeting other ethnic groups. Anti-Semitism remained a serious problem, and there were several anti-Semitic attacks on persons and synagogues during the reporting period.\n\nIn September 2006, a court convicted of attempted murder and of inciting ethnic and religious strife, and sentenced to 16 years in prison, a man who stabbed eight persons during evening prayers in the Chabad synagogue in Moscow in January 2006. The assailant did not deny that anti-Semitism was a motive in his attack. The courts increased the 13-year sentence he received in April 2006 because it had not taken into account the extremist motive of the attack.\n\nA student attempted a copy-cat attack on a synagogue in Rostov-on-Don in January 2006, but security guards stopped him before he could harm anyone. An appeals court overturned his attempted murder conviction on the basis that he was mentally unfit to stand trial, and ordered him to undergo psychiatric treatment.\n\nOn 1 October, 2005, 21-year-old Andrey Dzyuba was killed by a gang of drunken teenagers in Yekaterinburg. The group yelled anti-Semitic insults at Dzyuba, dragged him to a cemetery, beat him, and killed him with a metal cross grave marker. Courts convicted five of the attackers of murder for reason of ethnic hatred, and gave them sentences ranging from five to ten years in prison. Ten underage attackers who participated in the beating but not the murder were not charged due to their age.\n\nAccording to the NGO Moscow Bureau of Human Rights (MBHR), the ultranationalist and anti-Semitic Russian National Unity (RNE) paramilitary organization continued to propagate hostility toward Jews and non-Orthodox Christians. The RNE appeared to have lost political influence in some regions since its peak in 1998, but the organization maintained high levels of activity in other regions, such as Voronezh.\n\nSome branches of the ultranationalist and anti-Semitic National Sovereign Way of Russia (NDPR) participated in events organized by local officials.\n\nThe primary targets of skinheads were foreigners and individuals from the North Caucasus, but they expressed anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic sentiments as well.\n\nVandals desecrated several synagogues and Jewish community centers during the reporting period, including in Saratov, Lipetsk, Borovichy, Murmansk, Nizhniy Novgorod, Taganrog, Samara, Petrozavodsk, Perovo, Baltiisk, Kurgan, Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, Tomsk, and Kaliningrad. Officials often classified the crimes as \"hooliganism.\" In the cases where local authorities prosecuted cases, courts generally imposed suspended sentences.\n\nIn May 2007 Dmitry Levanov firebombed the Jewish center in Ulyanovsk and nailed a threatening note on its door with a knife. The next day he returned with a friend and threw a brick through its window. He was detained by police, tried in court, and given a 2-year suspended sentence for inciting ethnic hatred. His friend was released without being charged.\n\nOn 5 May, 2007, an assailant threw a Molotov cocktail at a synagogue in Saratov. No suspects were apprehended. The police were investigating the arson as a case of \"hooliganism\" rather than as a hate crime. They stated it may not have been clear to the perpetrator that the building was a synagogue.\n\nIn the same town at the beginning of April 2007, a Jewish community member's home was targeted in an arson attack. Graffiti reading \"kikes to Israel\" was written on a fence near the synagogue. Police investigators also classified these incidents as hooliganism and had not detained any suspects as of May 2007.\n\nOn the night of 18 March, 2007, vandals painted extremist phrases and swastikas on the walls of a synagogue in Voronezh. Officials initiated a criminal investigation on charges of vandalism and inciting extremist activity. The head of the Voronezh Jewish Community believed that the synagogue was attacked in response to the arrest of two young persons suspected of vandalizing a Jewish cemetery in Voronezh.\n\nOn the night of 1 March, 2007, vandals desecrated a synagogue in Vladivostok and painted swastikas and anti-Semitic phrases on the walls of the synagogue. The synagogue was also vandalized on 26 October, 2006.\n\nOn 15 December, 2006, the Jewish Charity Center in Pskov reported that pepper spray was sprayed through a keyhole during its Hanukkah celebration. Police found no evidence of an attack but agreed to step up patrols when the Center was having public events.\n\nIn September 2006 unidentified persons threw stones at synagogues in Khabarovsk and Astrakhan, breaking several windows. One perpetrator threw a Molotov cocktail at the Astrakhan synagogue during this attack.\n\nVandals also desecrated several Jewish cemeteries and memorials during the reporting period.\n\nOn 30 March, 2007, unknown vandals defaced seven grave markers in a Jewish cemetery in St. Petersburg with swastikas and graffiti. Police were investigating.\n\nOn 29 March, 2007, unknown vandals spray painted swastikas and fascist graffiti on a holocaust memorial in Kaliningrad. The local Jewish community chairman asked the prosecutor to investigate.\n\nOn 6 March, 2007, vandals desecrated a Jewish cemetery in Voronezh, ruining more than 20 tombstones. Officials initiated a criminal case under article 244 of the Criminal Code—desecrating a cemetery.\n\nCharges of \"hooliganism\" were quite common for crimes that would normally be considered bias crimes against a particular community, but prosecutors, even by governmental opinion, were reluctant to pursue aggravated charges of racial bias in crimes and were many times content with the lesser charge being applied. At times, there was a fear of not being able to win a court judgment of a bias crime.\n\nThere were many reports of anti-Semitic publications during the reporting period.\n\nA number of small, radical-nationalist newspapers that print anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim, and xenophobic articles, many of which appeared to violate the law against extremism, were readily available throughout the country. There were also reports of anti-Semitic literature on sale in cities across the country. The estimated number of xenophobic publications exceeded 100, many sponsored by the local chapters of the National Power Party. In addition, there were at least 80 websites in the country that disseminated anti-Semitic propaganda.\n\nThe Euro-Asian Congress noted that in 2006 prosecutors recorded the highest number of attempts to prosecute purveyors of anti-Semitic propaganda. While the Government has publicly denounced nationalist ideology and supported legal action against anti-Semitic acts, the reluctance of some lower-level officials to call such acts anything other than \"hooliganism\" remained an impediment.\n\nIn June 2007 a court in Novosibirsk sentenced the publisher of a local newspaper to two years in prison for inciting anti-Semitism. He had published articles that openly called for violence against Jews.\n\nIn April 2007, at a book fair in Moscow, police arrested a trader in extremist books and charged him with inciting ethnic, racial, and religious enmity. The police stated that they were seeking to identify the publisher of these materials.\n\nMembers of the State Duma and other prominent figures expressed anti-Semitic sentiments in a January 2005 letter, urging the prosecutor general to investigate Jewish organizations and initiate proceedings to ban them, charging that a Russian translation of ancient Jewish law, the Kitzur Shulchan Arukh, incited hatred against non-Jews. According to the ADL, in 2006 human rights organizations made numerous unsuccessful attempts to prosecute the authors of the \"Letter of 500.\"\n\nThe Rodina party merged with the Party of Life and the Party of Pensioners to form the new \"For a Just Russia\" party in 2006. Rodina members with known anti-Semitic views generally did not approve of the merger and did not join the new party. \"For a Just Russia\" was led by Federation Council Speaker Sergey Mironov, who frequently spoke out against intolerance and anti-Semitism, including at a September 2006 visit to the Babiy Yar memorial in Ukraine.\n\nIn 2006 Nikolay Kurianovich, an LDPR Duma deputy, initiated and publicized a \"list of the enemies of the Russian people\", which mostly featured Jewish names. On 7 March, 2007, aides to Kurianovich were expelled from the Duma chambers for wearing swastika armbands. Kurianovich declared their expulsion part of a \"struggle against all that is Russian.\"\n\nDuring the reporting period, President Putin spoke several times on the need to combat interethnic and interreligious intolerance. The ROC hosted the World Summit of Religious Leaders in July 2006, including 200 leaders from 40 countries. The conference focused on political and social issues and included calls for interreligious tolerance. President Putin addressed the leaders and urged them to lead their congregations away from extremism.\n\nOn 13 March, 2007, President Putin visited the Vatican and discussed with Pope Benedict XVI ways to improve relations between the ROC and Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe LDS succeeded in registering 51 local religious organizations as of the end of 2006.\n\nOn 12 December, 2006, a court affirmed the New Testament Church and the Perm Community of Evangelical Christians' title to the former Lenin Palace of Culture, providing an official certificate documenting the community's ownership of the facility, which they planned to use as a house of worship.\n\nAn Old Believer community in Samara regained its prerevolutionary church through a municipal decision during the reporting period.\n\nDespite the prolonged series of investigations, Jehovah's Witness officials in St. Petersburg told consulate staff that the situation in Northwest Russia had improved. The officials said they had been able to engage in constructive dialogue with Government officials with regard to the general situation on religious freedom and the investigation of their Administrative Center.\n\nIn November 2006 the Permskiy Kray court ruled in favor of the Pentecostal Church, allowing the church to register its property, overturning several previous lower court decisions against the group. The Pentecostal group reported having received no official harassment since the resolution of the case.\n\nIn February 2007 a Sverdlovsk oblast court convicted five teenagers of the 2005 murder of a Jewish man, sentencing them to prison sentences ranging from 5 to 10 years. The teens were skinheads and members of extremist and Nazi-affiliated groups. The court acknowledged the anti-Semitic nature of the crime in its verdict, which came under Article 105, Section 2, \"Ethnic or Religious Hate Crime.\"\n\nFederal and regional officials participated actively in, and in many cases strongly supported, a range of government and NGO-organized programs to promote tolerance. The December 2006 conference \"A Multi-Ethnic Russia\" was cosponsored by the Federation Council and UNESCO and included sessions on religious diversity and tolerance.\n\nThe Commission for Human Rights in the Russian Federation, a government body headed by Vladimir Lukin, released its annual report on human rights and publicized the difficulty that some religious groups faced in property restitution and land acquisition, and the difficulties that religious minorities faced with government officials.\n\nThe Public Chamber's Commission on Tolerance and Freedom of Conscience promoted tolerance in troubled areas, by holding a public hearing in March 2006 on how to promote stability and civil accord in the North Caucasus. Among the participants were government and religious leaders from the region.\n\nFederal authorities, and in many cases regional and local authorities, facilitated the establishment of new Jewish institutions. In June 2006 work began on the construction of a $100 million Moscow Jewish community center on land donated by the Moscow city government to house Jewish community institutions including a school, a hospital, and a major new museum devoted to the history of the country's Jews, the Holocaust, and tolerance. The construction was scheduled to be completed by the end of 2008.\n\nEvangelical Christian leaders in St. Petersburg reported important progress in obtaining federal permission to expand work with prisoners, in particular through its broadcasting network. With the cooperation of the ROC, satellite receivers were installed in dozens of prisons to allow broadcasting of programming that was broadly Protestant but tried to reach across denominations. The prison broadcasting program's stated goal was to provide inmates with an alternative to mainstream television.\n\nROC Patriarch Aleksiy II and spiritual leaders of Russian Muslims held an interfaith appeal for peace and joint efforts to counter ethnic and religious strife, following interethnic violence in the city of Kondopoga.\n\nDespite the problems the Jehovah's Witnesses faced, church leaders said that their community grew by 3 percent (to 140,000) in the last year. Although in the past the Jehovah's Witnesses had difficulty securing large venues, they held an annual congress on 14-16 July, 2006, at the Luzhniki Sports Complex in Moscow, which more than 22,000 attended. The April 2007 Jehovah's Witnesses' observances of the death of Jesus in Moscow proceeded without official or community disruption.\n\nHere were reports of societal abuses and discrimination based on religious belief or practice, including some physical attacks against individuals and communities because of the victims' religious affiliation (see also the section on Anti-Semitism). Groups that monitor hate crimes reported at least 70 incidents of vandalism against religious targets, including 36 aimed at Jews, 12 against Russian Orthodox, and 11 against Muslims.\n\nOn 9 April, 2007, the Stavropol court charged a suspect with murder on religious hatred grounds for the September 2006 killing of Imam Kurdzhiyev.\n\nIn February 2007 police charged suspects in the June 2004 killing of Nikolay Girenko, an expert on xenophobia, racism, and anti-Semitism. Girenko had served for many years as an expert witness in trials involving alleged skinheads and neo-Nazis.\n\nOn 8 December, 2006, a hand grenade was thrown into the yard of the house of Ismail Berdiyev, Chairman of the Coordinating Council of Moslems of the North Caucasus. No one was hurt in the attack.\n\nRussian Orthodox priest Andrey Nikolayev, his wife, and their three children were killed on 2 December, 2006, when their house was set on fire. The motive for the arson and murder was not known, but media reported that a criminal group had threatened the priest in the past and had burned down his house in another village.\n\nAccording to Jehovah's Witness officials, there were 5 incidents of physical attacks on Jehovah's Witnesses, and 11 incidents of police detention in the first half of 2007. In 2006 there were 24 physical attacks and 40 cases of police detention.\n\nMany citizens believe that at least nominal adherence to the ROC is a part of Russian culture, and three other faiths—Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism—are widely considered \"traditional religions.\" Terrorism and events related to the war in Chechnya have given rise to negative popular attitudes toward traditionally Muslim ethnic groups in many regions. Hostility toward non-Russian-Orthodox religious groups sparked harassment and occasionally physical attacks. Religiously motivated violence continued, although it was often difficult to determine whether xenophobia, religion, or ethnic prejudices were the primary motivation. Conservative activists claiming ties to the ROC disseminated negative publications and staged demonstrations throughout the country against Roman Catholics, Protestants, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other minority religions.\n\nSome religious groups participated in interfaith dialogues. Pentecostal and Baptist organizations, as well as the ROC, were reluctant to support ecumenism at the local level, although the national leaders engaged each other at public forums during the reporting period. At the international level, the ROC has traditionally pursued interfaith dialogue with other Christian groups. In the Muslim-dominated regions of the Tatarstan republic and the surrounding Volga region, tensions between Muslims and Russian Orthodox believers occasionally emerged. Law enforcement organizations closely watched Muslim groups. Officials often described Muslim charitable organizations as providing aid to extremists in addition to their overt charity.\n\nA small splinter group of the ultranationalist Russian National Unity (RNE) organization called \"Russian Rebirth\" registered successfully in the past in Tver and Nizhniy Novgorod as a social organization, prompting protests from human rights groups; however, in several regions such as Moscow and Karelia, the authorities limited the activities of the RNE by denying registration to its local affiliates. According to Sova Center, there were neither registration denials nor registrations of RNE during the reporting period. Sova Center reported that three other ultranationalist organizations were dissolved in 2006. In one case, the Supreme Court upheld the decision by a Krasnodar court to ban the Krasnodar Orthodox Slavic community, an Orthodox Old Believers group that used neo-Nazi symbols.\n\nOn 2 July, 2006, 15 shots were fired over a 15-minute period at the Trinikolsky monastery in the Dmitrovsky District of the Moscow Oblast. While no one was injured, the shots caused $12,000 in damage.\n\nOn 27 August, 2006, an unknown attacker sprayed teargas, disrupting a Pentecostal church service in the \"New Testament\" Evangelical Church in the city of Perm.\n\nMuslims continued to encounter societal discrimination and antagonism in some regions. After terrorists associated with Chechen, Ingush, and Islamic extremists seized a school in 2004 in Beslan, North Ossetia, interethnic and interreligious tensions resulting in discrimination persisted in the region without the authorities' intervention, according to NGOs. Muslims claimed that citizens in certain regions feared Muslims, citing cases such as a dispute in Kolomna, approximately southeast of Moscow, over the proposed construction of a mosque. Government officials, journalists, and the public have liberally labeled Muslim organizations \"Wahhabi\", a term that has become equivalent with \"extremist.\" Numerous press reports documented anti-Islamic sentiment.\n\nIn Muslim-dominated regions, relations between Muslims and Russian Orthodox believers were generally harmonious. Extremely traditional or orthodox versions of Islam were often associated in the public mind with terrorism and radical Muslim fighters in the North Caucasus.\n\nAlthough the previous reporting period saw the chairman of the Council of Muftis, the head of the Central Spiritual Board of the country's Muslims, and the head of the Coordinating Center of Muslims of the North Caucasus jointly denounce terrorism, the national press carried stories during the reporting period highlighting their public differences in attitudes toward Wahabbism, among other things.\n\nAs in the past, there were many attacks against houses of worship, meeting halls, and cemeteries across the country. Attacks ranged from threats and graffiti to arson. Often, even in the face of blatant anti-religious signs, local authorities investigated the cases as \"hooliganism\", and not under the stronger anti-hate laws, although there were signs that prosecutors were using the hate-crime laws more often. In April 2007 the Government amended the Criminal Code to increase punitive measures for hate crimes and extremism. According to new legislation, an individual convicted of committing an act of vandalism motivated by ideological, political, national, racial and religious hatred or enmity can be sentenced for up to 3 years.\n\nSova Center reported that 25 acts of vandalism motivated by religious hatred were committed against churches and other religious buildings in 2006, including 11 attacks on Muslim religious buildings. A mosque was bombed in Yahroma village of Moscow region. Mosques in Vladimir and Yaroslavl were attacked with Molotov cocktails.\n\nOn 27 September, 2006, arsonists attempted to burn down a mosque in Yaroslavl by throwing six Molotov cocktails at the building. Vandals painted extremist phrases and swastikas on the outer wall of the mosque. Police arrested and charged an 18-year-old student with instigation of nationalist, racial, and religious hatred. There was another attempt of arson on the same mosque 3 days earlier. On 25 December, 2006, the arsonists were convicted of desecration and arson; one was given a suspended sentence of 1 year and 3 months, and the other was sentenced to 10 months in a labor camp. The arsonists apologized publicly.\n\nEmmanuel Moscow Evangelical Church reported an arson attack on their building in Solntsevo district of Moscow on the night of 26 March, 2007. Also in March 2007, attackers threw bottles filled with resin at the front wall of Central Prayer House of the Christians of Evangelical Faith in Voronezh.\n\nSova Center registered 24 cases of vandalism in Orthodox, Muslim, and Jewish cemeteries in 2006. On 3 October, 2006, a group of skinheads desecrated approximately 150 Jewish and Tatar tombs in a cemetery in Tver. Extremist leaflets were found at the scene. A criminal case was initiated on charges of desecrating a cemetery.\n\nOn 4 August, 2006, a Muslim cemetery was vandalized in Yekaterinburg. More than a dozen headstones, many of them of historic value, were destroyed. Police characterized the vandalism as hooliganism, not a hate crime, and Muslim community representatives in Yekaterinburg, including Imam Sibgatulla-Hazrat, agreed with this view.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the tensions between the Vatican and the ROC notably decreased, although the Patriarchy in Moscow continued to object to the transfer of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic See from Lviv to Kiev, Ukraine, which occurred in August 2005. The press coverage of President Putin's March 2007 meeting with Pope Benedict XVI was positive, and Roman Catholic representatives noted a decrease in tensions during the reporting period. Other issues of concern that remained between the two groups included the continued belief that Roman Catholics were proselytizing in the country and a proposal by a local priest to open a Catholic Carmelite convent whose main mission would be to work with orphans in the city of Nizhniy Novgorod. The ROC alleged that the convent would serve as a base for missionary activities, while the Catholic Church maintained that the convent was not a full-fledged convent but a means for caring for local orphans. In April 2007 the Head of the ROC's Inter-Christian Relations Secretariat publicly criticized the Catholic Church for allegedly proselytizing at orphanages, calling their missionary activity \"unacceptable.\"\n\nReports of the harassment of evangelicals and Pentecostals dramatically decreased during the reporting period, particularly after September 2005, when Bishop Sergey Ryakhovskiy joined the Public Chamber. Nevertheless, African-Russian and African ministers of non-Orthodox Christian churches were subject to religious and racial bigotry.\n\nAccording to a 13 July, 2006, report by SOVA, an Orthodox priest and other activists attempted to interrupt a Baptist service in the village of Achit (Sverdlovsk region). They reportedly told persons walking by that the Baptists were a dangerous \"sect.\" Police arrived on the scene and fined the Baptists for holding an \"unauthorized meeting.\" Similar actions were reported against Pentecostals and Hare Krishnas.\n\nThe press routinely continued to reference members of Jehovah's Witnesses as a religious \"sect\", although they have been present in the country for approximately 100 years.\n\nIn the past, Jehovah's Witnesses officials reported physical attacks against their members throughout the country. The officials were unable to update these figures for this reporting period, citing the difficulty of collecting the information.\n\nA case at the ECHR continued 4 years after a provocative exhibit on religion was vandalized at the Sakharov Center. Although the authorities never prosecuted the vandals, a court found the Center Director and a staff member guilty of inciting religious hatred, and fined them. The case was being appealed at the ECHR.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the Slavic Center for Law and Justice and a number of minority \"nontraditional\" religious leaders asserted that the Government and majority religious groups increasingly used the mass media, conferences, and public demonstrations to foment opposition to minority religions as threats to physical, mental, and spiritual health, asserting that these groups threatened national security. During the reporting period, television channels broadcast several programs about \"dangerous cults and sects\" and implied that these included Pentecostals and other proselytizing religions.\n\n\n\n"}

He attended the Gymnasium bei St. Anna from 1767 to 1777, and between 1777 and 1781 studied theology, philosophy and philology in Leipzig under Professor Ernst Platner, Samuel Frederick Nathanael Morus and Johann August Ernesti. From 1781 he was in the service of the Protestant Church in Augsburg, and also a teacher at the high school at St. Anna. From 1786 to 1796, he was a deacon of the Barfüßer (Discalced) Parish, 1796-1806 deacon at St. Jakob and 1806-1811 pastor of the Barfüßer Parish. In 1787 he married Christina Johanna Regina Preu, the marriage being childless. William was a member of several Natural History organisations: \"Gesellschaft Naturforschender Freunde zu Berlin“, \"Naturforschende Gesellschaft zu Halle“, \"Vaterländische Gesellschaft der Ärzte und Naturforscher Schwabens“ und \"Regensburgische Botanische Gesellschaft“\".\n\nWilhelm was a popular preacher and author of items that were mostly anonymously written for calendars, almanacs and magazines. From 1792 publication of his \"Unterhaltungen aus der Naturgeschichte\" (Discourse on Natural History) in weekly instalments from his father's publishing house, with illustrations by renowned Augsburg engravers such as Jacob Xaver Schmuzer. Overall scope of the work: 25 volumes (with a total of 1469 illustrations), 19 volumes by Wilhelm himself. From 1808 it was reprinted by Pichler of Vienna. From 1798 a French translation of \"Insects\" at Haag in Basel (3 vols.).\n\n"}
{"id": "226959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=226959", "title": "Hyoscyamine", "text": "Hyoscyamine\n\nHyoscyamine (also known as daturine) is a tropane alkaloid. It is a secondary metabolite found in certain plants of the family Solanaceae, including henbane (\"Hyoscyamus niger\"), mandrake (\"Mandragora officinarum\"), jimsonweed (\"Datura stramonium\"), tomato (\"Solanum lycopersicum\") and deadly nightshade (\"Atropa belladonna\"). It is the levorotary isomer of atropine (third of the three major nightshade alkaloids) and thus sometimes known as levo-atropine.\n\nBrand names for hyoscyamine include Symax, HyoMax, Anaspaz, Egazil, Buwecon, Cystospaz, Levsin, Levbid, Levsinex, Donnamar, NuLev, Spacol T/S and Neoquess.\n\nHyoscyamine is used to provide symptomatic relief of spasms caused by various lower abdominal and bladder disorders including peptic ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulitis, pancreatitis, colic, and interstitial cystitis. It has also been used to relieve some heart problems, control some of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, as well as for control of abnormal respiratory symptoms and \"hyper-mucus secretions\" in patients with lung disease.\n\nIt is also useful in pain control for neuropathic pain, chronic pain and palliative care – \"comfort care\" – for those with intractable pain from treatment resistant, untreatable, and incurable diseases. When combined with opioids it increases the level of analgesia (pain relief) obtained. Several mechanisms are thought to contribute to this effect. The closely related drugs atropine and hyoscine and other members of the anticholinergic drug group like cyclobenzaprine, trihexyphenidyl, and orphenadrine are also used for this purpose. When hyoscyamine is used along with opioids or other anti-peristaltic agents, measures to prevent constipation are especially important given the risk of paralytic ileus.\n\nSide effects include dry mouth and throat, increased appetite leading to weight gain, eye pain, blurred vision, restlessness, dizziness, arrhythmia, flushing, and faintness. An overdose will cause headache, nausea, vomiting, and central nervous system symptoms including disorientation, hallucinations, euphoria, sexual arousal, short-term memory loss, and possible coma in extreme cases. The euphoric and sexual effects are stronger than those of atropine but weaker than those of Hyoscine, as well as dicycloverine, orphenadrine, cyclobenzaprine, trihexyphenidyl, and ethanolamine antihistamines like phenyltoloxamine. It can also act as a diuretic.\n\nHyoscyamine is an antagonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (antimuscarinic). It blocks the action of acetylcholine at parasympathetic sites in sweat glands, salivary glands, stomach secretions, heart muscle, sinoatrial node, smooth muscle in the gastrointestinal tract, and the central nervous system. It increases cardiac output and heart rate, lowers blood pressure and dries secretions. It may antagonize serotonin. At comparable doses, hyoscyamine has 98 per cent of the anticholinergic power of atropine. The other major belladonna-derived drug Hyoscine (known in the United States as Scopolamine) has 92 per cent of the antimuscarinic potency of atropine.\n\nHyoscyamine can be extracted from plants of the Solanaceae family, notably \"Datura stramonium\". As hyoscyamine is a direct precursor in the plant biosynthesis of hycosine, it is produced via the same metabolic pathway. \n\nThe biosynthesis of hycosine begins with the decarboxylation of \"L\"-ornithine to putrescine by ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17). Putrescine is methylated to \"N\"-methylputrescine by putrescine \"N\"-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.53). \n\nA putrescine oxidase (EC 1.4.3.10) that specifically recognizes methylated putrescine catalyzes the deamination of this compound to 4-methylaminobutanal which then undergoes a spontaneous ring formation to \"N\"-methylpyrrolium cation. In the next step, the pyrrolium cation condenses with acetoacetic acid yielding hygrine. No enzymatic activity could be demonstrated that catalyzes this reaction. Hygrine further rearranges to tropinone. \n\nSubsequently, tropinone reductase I (EC 1.1.1.206) converts tropinone to tropine which condenses with phenylalanine-derived phenyllactate to littorine. A cytochrome P450 classified as Cyp80F1 oxidizes and rearranges littorine to hyoscyamine aldehyde.\n"}

The JHU was launched in February 2004 by the lay-based, Sinhala nationalist political party Sihala Urumaya. Founding members include Kolonnawe Sumangala Thero, Uduwe Dhammaloka Thero, Ellawala Medhananda Thero, Omalpe Sobhitha Thero, Athuraliye Rathana Thero and Thilak Karunaratne. Some Sri Lankan Buddhists, including the All Island Clergy Organization, denounced the decision by monks to enter politics. The party drew support mainly from the middle class conservatives and the Buddhist youth.\n\nThe Jathika Hela Urumaya (National Sinhala Heritage) party contested its first parliamentary election on 2 April 2004. On that occasion, all of its candidates were Buddhist monks. At the election the party won 5.97% of the popular vote (a total of 552,724 votes) and nine out of 225 seats.\n\nSince the election, the party has been involved in a number of controversial issues: one important action was introducing a bill to prohibit unethical, manipulative and highly aggressive religious conversions. This was viewed as a reaction against proselytism systematically carried out by Christian fundamentalist groups with many guises, some of whom happened to be foreigners affiliated with non-governmental organizations. There had been some dramatic infighting within the JHU parliamentary group early on in its parliamentary profile. This was partly due the fact that this group had been cobbled together just before the polls and lacked unity on several grounds including the issue of how to relate to government formation.\n\nTwo of its founding members, Theros Kolonnawe Sumangala and Uduwe Dhammaloka left the party due to conflicts within the party between the monastic and lay members. The lay leader of the Sihala Urumaya also defected to the United National Party after seizing the party headquarters. After months of trouble, the party is strong again with the young monk Athuraliye Rathana Thero and the Sihala Urumaya member Champika Ranawaka leading the comeback. Ellawela Medhananda and Omalpe Sobhitha theros remain in the leadership. Other influential members include Dr Neville Karunatilake and Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe. JHU is also affiliated with the National Movement Against Terrorism (NMAT), SPUR, North-East Sinhala Organisation (NESO) and other local and international Sinhala nationalist groups.\n\nJathika Hela Urumaya successfully appealed the supreme court to cut President Chandrika Kumaratunga's term short. In October 2005, former JHU member Uduwe Dhammaloka indicated that there was a growing sentiment among the monks of the JHU that a mistake had been made in directly entering the political realm. Dhammaloka indicated that he personally believed that monks could have a more positive impact on Sri Lankan society by focusing on religious work, and that the current crop of monk-parliamentarians intended to \"ensure that monks will not enter politics again\" (\"Monks\"). It is unclear if Uduwe Dhammaloka and other ordained members of parliament will resign their positions, or if legislation will be introduced to restrict monks from standing for public office (as is currently the case in Thailand). Jathika Hela Urumaya supported President Mahinda Rajapakse in the presidential election in 2005. In 2007, the JHU officially became part of the Rajapakse Government with one of its Buddhist monk MP, Omalpe Thero resigning and in his place a lay member Champika Ranawaka being made a MP and then the Cabinet Minister of Environment and Natural Resources.\n\nIn 2014 party decided to withdraw support to Mahinda Rajapaksha and support the common candidate Maithripala Sirisena backed by United National Party. In the 2015 general election party contested under the United National Party symbol elephant and won 3 seats. Champika Ranawaka was appointed as the Minister of Megalopolis and Western Development.\n\nThe JHU launched a campaign to collect one million signatures to petition United Nations General Secretary Ban Ki Moon to establish a commission to inquire into human rights violations committed by the United States\n\nThe party advocated the wiping out the LTTE by military force, and the party played a major role in making that dream a reality. It wants to maintain Sri Lanka's unitary constitution. The JHU is active against deforestation and is active to promote organic farming. The JHU have also been instrumental in implementing several policy programmes including a ban on smoking in public places and limitations in alcohol, banning of harmful pesticides, including the mandatory shut-down of liquor stores and ban on meat on Poya and other Buddhist festivals.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51415718", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51415718", "title": "Lands of Borland", "text": "Lands of Borland\n\nThe Lands of Borland formed an estate lying between Aiket Castle and the town of Dunlop, East Ayrshire, Parish of Dunlop, Scotland. The laird's house at Borland stood near the Sandy Ford over the Glazert Water. The names Bordland, Boreland, Borland, Laigh Borland, Low Borland and Nether Borland have all been applied to the site of the laird's house.\n\nIn 1848 the \"Scottish Journal\" records that \"a number of years ago the foundation of a ruin of considerable extent was removed by the late proprietor.\" In 1853 Mr. Dobie recorded that \"There can still be traced the meiths (boundary line) of a building of considerable extent on the top of the Hill of Borland\". Mr. G. Howie, of Dunlop in 1856, stated that he remembered seeing a small portion of what was said to be one of the walls about 70 or 80 years ago. It was a sort of bank, quite crumbled down and overgrown with grass. Since then, the ruins of a building of considerable extent have been removed and the ground cultivated. On the southern side of the hill there are the remains of a wide ditch or fosse, locally known as the 'Cuckoo slide.' Paterson in 1866 states that \"the foundation of a ruin was removed some years ago by a late proprietor.\"\n\nA local tradition is that the monks of Kilwinning Abbey had a hospice for their brethren at Borland where medicinal herbs were grown in a formal garden. It is recorded that a two merk land at Dunlop was appropriated to the church and the remainder used by the monks. Borland may have been similar to Monkredding near Kilwinning that was also once held by the Tironensian monks of Kilwinning Abbey and was the 'Monk's Garden', effectively a rest home for the brothers.\n\nA substantial and ornately carved table style gravestone in the Dunlop graveyard records a William Anderson who died aged 70 on 3 December 179(?)6 and his wife who died in 1784. The memorial was erected by his son Robert Anderson of Borland. This stone is now leaning against the 'Picture House' building. \n\nThe 1797-98 Farm Horse Tax records list John Dunlop's horses at Laigh Borland.\n\nIn around 1823 Andrew and Mary Brown inherited \"the original mansion, lately rebuilt, on the banks of the Glazert, in a remarkable pleasant situation..\" Mary Dunlop married Andrew Brown of Craighead, the eldest son of John Brown of Hill and received as her inheritance the portion of Borland that contained the old mansion house, \"..romantically situated by the Glazert Water..\". One of their first acts was to rebuild the old mansion house. These reports do not agree on when Borland was rebuilt however the early 19th century seems likely. The walled garden was probably built in the 19th century and stones from the old castle may have been used in its construction.\n\nBorland, later Nether or Laigh Borland, was described in the OS 'Name Book' of 1855-57 as being composed of \"Two small farm houses & steadings with gardens etc. attached, in a sheltered situation on the side of Glazert Burn about ½ mile south-west of Dunlop, the property of Andrew Brown Esq. of Hill and occupied by Mr. James Templeton and Mr. Robert Frew.\"\n\nWalled gardens are not generally associated with farms and the presence of one at Borland suggests that the site at one time had a higher status than that of a tenanted farm. The walled garden is square, probably originally 18th century in date with its south, east and west walls rebuilt circa 1916 and greatly reduced in height and also in length. They are mainly built from random rubble with flat sandstone copings and are much thinner than the north wall. The prominent cylindrical gate piers with conical caps to the south also date from 1916 and are placed slightly back from the line of the wall. An old door on the east side has been blocked off. A culvert or cundy runs beneath the garden and exists as a stream on the north side that drains into the Glazert Water. The north wall was not altered in 1916. A sundial is indicated as standing in the centre of the garden and is visible in an old black and white photograph.\n\nLaigh Borland was demolished in the mid 20th century and it is recorded that a 16th or 17th century datestone with the initials of the Brown family once existed above the entrance door of the attached building that was latterly a kitchen. Its relative inaccessibility due to the ford had been partly overcome by a hardcore access from Over Borland however it had fallen into disrepair and the council required its demolition on safety grounds as a public access still existed via North Borland with a pedestrian crossing at the ford for footpath walkers, the concrete bases used as handrails supports are still present.\n\nThe workers cottages, one occupied by Mrs Watt, were thatched up until demolition and an associated small ruined building, probably a pigsty, still exists partly built into the hillside. The family grave of the Watt family records that Martha Watt née Stevenson died in 1916 at Laigh Borland at the age of 81. The cottages were demolished shortly after this date and the changes to the walled garden enacted at the same time.\n\nRobert Wilson of Over Borland was married to Agnes Gemmill who died in November 1636. In her Will she bequeathed legacies to her grandsons John Dunlop and William Gemmill.\n\nJohn Dunlop of Over Borland married Elizabeth Walkinshaw and in 1650 was valued at 100 Scots.\n\nA gravestone in Dunlop's churchyard records the deaths of John Dunlop of Over Borland, his wife Jean Gilmour and their children, namely John who died aged 4 in 1778, Margaret who died aged 5 months in 1784, William who died aged 3 in 1792, John who died aged 12 in 1792 and Jane who died aged 27 in 1804. Jean Gilmour died in 1827.\n\nOver Borland is a Category 'C' Listed farm house located at the end of a lane that branches off from the lane to Dunlop near the Millennium Woodlands (55.7099, -4.5491) (NS239940, 6492150). The building carries a 1770 datestone inscribed 'RN JS 1770' and another stone next to the doorway inscribed 'JMN MRS 1912'.\n\nOver Borland in 1855-1857 is recorded as \"A small farm house & steading with garden & land attached about half a mile south-west of Dunlop, belonging to Andrew Brown Esq. and occupied by Mrs. Watt.\" Together with 'Hill' aka 'Over Hill' is one of the oldest surviving 2-storey farmhouses in Dunlop parish.\n\nA possible date for the removal of the old castle masonry would be 1781 + or - 5 years which effectively embraces the year 1770, the date of the probable rebuilding of Over Borland as stated on the 'RN JS 1770' date stone. It has been stated that the enlargement of Over Borland was carried out to provide a replacement for Borland aka Laigh Borland and this property was later let out to tenants.\n\nA family gravestone in Dunlop parish church graveyard records a John Watt, farmer in Boreland (sic) whose wife was Ann Craig. This couple had offspring Catherine and Matthew who died young and a son who inherited, David, living to 79 years of age and dying in 1881. David's wife was Martha Stevenson who died in 1916 at Leigh (sic) Borland.\n\nJane Dunlop married Thomas Reid of Balgray near Irvine and inherited the North Borland portion of the Lands of Borland, their son John Dunlop Reid then inherited North Borland. Thomas and Jane Reid built a fine new house at North Borland.\n\nHill or Over-Hill of Dunlop was once part of the Lands of Borland, passing to the Brown family through marriage, notably the burial stone of John Dunlop of Overhill and Barbara Gilmour his wife is located in Dunlop churchyard with the date 1732. John Dunlop's grandson, Andrew Brown, is also recorded, dated 1794.\n\nJohn Dunlop and Barbara Gilmour had one child, Mary, who married Allan Brown of Gabroch-hill and several generations and inter-marriages later Andrew Brown of Craighead married the aforementioned Mary Dunlop of Borland and the couple later inherited Hill or Overhill.\n\nBorlandhills and several other properties were once part of the Lands of Borland.\n\nThe native chiefs, although displaced from Boarland Hill (sic) do not appear to have been exiled, instead they established themselves as the Dunlops of that Ilk at what is now Dunlop House on the Clerkland Burn.\n\nA tradition states that the De Ross first held Borland or Dunlop Hill (NS 4019 4940) as their seat and a well-fortified stone built structure existed there, later their seat was moved to Corsehill in Stewarton. A Celtic hillfort may have existed here, as suggested by the etymology of the placename. Corsehill Castle became their primary residence after Godfrey de Ross was granted the Lands of Stewarton.\n\nThe De Ross family were vassals to the De Morvilles, Overlords of Cunninghame. The De Morvilles backed John Balliol's claim to the crown and forfeited their lands to the Boyds, and in 1570 the lands were held by the Cassilis family. Timothy Pont records that Over and Nether Borland were held by the Kennedys, Earls of Cassilis in the early 17th century, the lands having passed to them from Godfrey de Ross who \"..hauing his refidence heir enioyed ample possefions abrode in ye countrey and ves for ye tyme Shriffe of Aire.\" Alexander Cunninghame of Aiket married the sister of the Earl of Cassilis and this may explain how Borland passed into Cunninghame of Aiket hands.\nThe name 'Borland' is popularly thought to derive from the hunting of boar in the area however another authority points out that \"Bordlands signifie the desmenes which lords keep in their hands for the maintenance of their board or table.\" The De Ross family were vassals of Richard de Morville.\n\nPrior to 1597 the 6 Merk land of the nearby estate of Hapland was part of the Lands of Dunlop and David Dunlop, fourth of Hapland, exchanged or excambied Hapland for the Lands of Borland 1600 accordingly to Robertson. Although a merk land was a measure of rental value it can be estimated that 6 merks would be between 6 and 12 acres. 1660 is another suggested date for when Patrick Cuninghame exchanged his lands of Borland for those of nearby Hapland.\n\nJohn Dunlop, fourth of Borland, married a Montgomerie of High Cross near Stewarton and had three children, one of whom died young. The eldest son, John, inherited and his brother is designated James of Loanhead. John Dunlop, fifth of Borland, married Mary Clark of Shitterflat (sic) who was the daughter of William Clerk, portioner of that property and his spouse Margaret Simpson. The couple had four sons and two daughters with the eldest son, John, inheriting.\n\nThe Dunlops of Borland continued in possession until the male line ended sometime around 1823 with two daughters, Mary and Jane, the parents being John Dunlop (sixth of Borland) and Jean, daughter of John Gilmour of Tailend in situated in the east of Dunlop parish. They had a large family however only Mary and Jane survived to adulthood.\n\nMary Dunlop married Andrew Brown of Craighead, the eldest son of John Brown of Hill and received as her inheritance the portion of Borland that contained the old mansion house, \"..romantically situated by the Glazert Water..\". One of their first acts was to rebuild the old mansion house. The couple had two sons and six daughters with the eldest son, John Brown, inherited Borland and is recorded as 'John Brown of Hill, Craighead and Borland' who married Marion Duncan of Brockwellmuir and this couple had three sons and two daughters, the eldest son being John Brown.\n\nAs stated, Jane Dunlop married Thomas Reid of Balgray near Irvine and inherited the North Borland portion of the Lands of Borland, their son John Dunlop Reid then inherited North Borland.\n\nThomas and Jane Reid built a fine new house at North Borland whilst Andrew and Mary Brown inherited \"the original mansion, lately rebuilt, on the banks of the Glazert, in a remarkable pleasant situation..\"\n\nThe Lands of Borland were apparently held for many years by what might be best described as 'Bonnet Lairds', named from petty landowners who wore a hat or bonnet like the humble working labourers. It seems that Over Borland was the farm or 'mains' associated with the 'Laird's' house and this is born out by the fact that Borland never had all the required buildings associated with a working farm and was embellished with a walled garden usually associated with mansion houses.\n\nOn 4 November 1570, William and Alexander Cunninghame of Aiket were brought to trial for ambushing and together with others, killing John Mure of Caldwell on the Lands of Borland, however they were acquitted. An old tradition relates that 'shortly' after the murder of John Mure, the young Dunlop Laird of Hapland was persuaded against his mother's wishes to join the Cunninghames of Aiket in a raid on one of their neighbours that they were feuding with. The laird's mother had a dream that predicted her son's death and it indeed came to pass that he fell, mortally wounded, on the banks of the Annick Water, near Stewarton and his horse \"foaming and spent\" returned riderless to Hapland, having escaped from the field \nof battle where his master had died.\n\nThis old tradition seems to relate to the Murder of Hugh Montgomerie, 4th Earl of Eglinton at the Annick Ford in Stewarton in 1586 that occurred as a consequence of the long running feud between the Montgomeries, Earls of Eglinton and the Cunninghames, Earls of Glencairn, families who were competing for power and influence locally and nationally. The significant repercussions of this act were felt throughout the county of Ayrshire and beyond. In the list of the conspirators there is a Gilbert Dunlop, however he is recorded as a servant of 'Patrick of Baidland'. Paterson records that a Gilbert Dunlop existed in 1498 so it was a name used by the family. Patrick Cunninghame of Bordland (sic) was certainly present at the ambush.\n\nIt is interesting that as detailed above Patrick Cunninghame shortly after excambied or exchanged his 'Lands of Borland' for those of David Dunlop's 'Lands of Hapland'. The reasons for this exchange could relate in some way to the aforementioned incident and its many repercussions. In 1612 Patrick Cunninghame however sold these lands to Gabriel Porterfield, son of Alexander Porterfield of that Ilk.\n\nThe OS maps indicate that the main entrance to Laigh Borland was via the Sandy Ford lane that ran past North Borland and crossed the Glazert water. A minor access branched off from the lane to Over Borland and ran down the steep lower slope of Borland Hill to enter close to the walled garden's south-eastern corner. A footpath with a stile ran down from Over Borland to Laigh Borland.\n\nIn 1856 Laigh Borland was recorded as 'Borland' whilst Over Borland did carry the name is still has today. The walled garden is shown with internal beds equally divided into four by paths with an entrance off Sandy Ford Lane. A small structure stands at the front entrance of the walled garden. A well is shown close to the old worker's cottages and another lies off the end of a well made path that extends towards the Glazert behind Borland House. A lane or more likely a cart track runs from Borland and eventually joins the lane to Over Borland. The land behind Borland is wooded with a rectangular open area. The Sandy Ford appears to have stepping stones and provides the only vehicular access to Borland House.\n\nIn 1895 a small pond is located behind the north wall of the walled garden that no longer has a formal laid out interior. A footbridge stands at the ford and a second path links what is now marked as Laigh Borland with the lane out towards Dunlop via the Straitbow Bridge. Two small buildings stand against the walled garden, south and west walls.\n\nThe 1909 OS map shows a few changes in that the pond is not marked, only a single track runs up towards the Dunlop road via the Straitbow Bridge and the farm cottages have fenced or walled enclosures behind them. A sundial is indicated as standing in the centre of the garden.\n\nBy 1957 Laigh Borland is not named separately and a road access has been constructed from Over Borland via the Middle Rig field and the worker's cottages have been demolished, no doubt supplying hard core for the new access. The cottages were present in 1925.\n\nThe name Boarland (sic) could refer to the presence of wild boar, however a 'Boor' also meant a serf and Norman lords often apportioned lands near their castles for their servants. Another interpretation is that Borland or Bordland meant the land that was granted to the feudal superior, Godfrey de Ross, specifically to be used to furnish food for his castle or dwelling. The name 'Borland' occurs in the names of the properties of Borlandhill, Over Borland, North Borland and Laigh Borland.\n\nMiddle Rig runs below the Fox Covert wood and Corsbie Craigs lies to the south with Black Craigs to the north-west with a White Craigs just across the Glazert Water. The name 'Glazert' may come from the Gaelic \"glas\" that means grey or green and \"dur\" meaning water. Corsbie or Crosbie refers to a 'cross' with the Scandinavian suffix '-by' meaning a settlement.\n\nA 'Rig' is a long narrow ridge and a 'Fox Covert' was usually woodland reserved for fox breeding, feeding, etc. in relation to fox hunting. A 'craig' is a cliff. The Sandy Ford derives its name from the coarse sand that accumulates there to this day.\n\nAndrew Brown of Over Hill aka 'The Hill' who died in 1791 was the grandson of John Dunlop of Over Hill, husband of Barbara Gilmour. As previously mentioned, Mary Dunlop, daughter of John Dunlop of Borland and Jean Gilmour of Tailend, had half of Borland (Borland House) with her husband Andrew Brown and died at the Hill aka Over Hill in Dunlop parish, the property of her mother's brother-in-law, in 1839.\n\nBarbara Gilmour or Dunlop was a significant figure in 17th century Ayrshire having introduced a method of cheese making which became common throughout Ayrshire and beyond, providing employment and extra income for farmers and others.\n\nA Cunninghame of Borland was involved in a raid against Drumlanrig in 1650.\n\nin 1618 Gabriel Porterfield married Mariot Crawfurd and inherited the lands of Gills, Lothrihill, the Templeland and Maynes (Mains) of Hapland, including the mansion house and also acquired Dunlop Hill.\n\nLocal tradition has it that a Ley Tunnel runs from the site of Laigh Borland House to Aiket Castle.\n\nA Mr 'Pop' McGaw was one of the last tenants of Laigh Borland.\n\nAn artificial fox den built with stones existed in the fox covert wood to encourage foxes to breed for the purposes of the hunt.\n\nOne of the group of four who removed the Stone of Scone from Westminster Abbey in 1950 was descended from the Watt family of Laigh Borland.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21466465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21466465", "title": "List of Hindu temples in Indonesia", "text": "List of Hindu temples in Indonesia\n\nThis is a list of Hindu temples and their remains in Indonesia. Indonesia has been part of Indosphere of Greater India where sanskritization and Hinduism spread across Indonesia. Hindus in Indonesia are a multi-ethnic society consisting of different Indonesian ethnicities, such as Balinese, Javanese, Indian and other ethnic groups. Majority of Indonesian Hindus are Balinese that inhabit the volcanic island of Bali and out of them some have migrated to other parts of Indonesia. There is also a significant Indonesian Indian Hindu minority settled in large cities. Numbers of Indonesian natives that adhere to a form of native Austronesian ancestral and natural worship might also be categorized as Hindus, such as Dayaks, Kaharingan, Karo, Parmalim and Sundanese, Sunda Wiwitan. Hindu Dayak and Kaharingan groups are concentrated in Central Kalimantan.\n\nThe design, style, layout, architecture and decoration of Hindu temples differ among various ethnic groups. Balinese Hindu temples do not have the Gopuram above temples unlike Indian Tamil Hindu temples which feature a prominent Gopuram at the entrance. Indian temples are designed as indoor house of worship, while Balinese temples are designed as open-air temple within walled compound connected by series of intricately decorated roofed gates and split gates. In Indonesia, there are roughly three types of Hindu templesː\n\n\"Candi\" is an Indonesian term to refer to ancient temples. Prior to the rise of Islam, between the 5th to 15th century Dharmic faiths (Hinduism and Buddhism) were the majority in Indonesian archipelago, especially in Java and Sumatra. As the result numerous Hindu temples, locally known as \"candi\", constructed and dominated the landscape of Java. According to local beliefs, Java valley had thousands of Hindu temples which co-existed with Buddhist temples, most of which were buried in massive eruption of Mount Merapi in 1006 AD.\n\nBetween 1100 and 1500 additional Hindu temples were built, but abandoned by Hindus and Buddhists as Islam spread in Java circa 15th to 16th century.\n\nIn last 200 years, some of these have been rediscovered mostly by farmers while preparing their lands for crops. Most of these ancient temples were rediscovered and reconstructed between 19th to 20th century, and treated as the important archaeological findings and also as tourist attraction, but not as the house of worship. The local population mostly has converted to Islam or Christianity and practically has no connection nor recollection of Hindu rituals and traditions of their ancestors. Today, these ancient Hindu temples in Java are under the authority of \"Dinas Purbakala\" (Archaeological Authority) under the Ministry of Culture. Nevertheless, initiated by Balinese and local Hindu community, the Hindu rituals and festivals have been revived and performed in these ancient temples on certain Hindu holy days, such as those performed annually in Prambanan temple compound.\n\nMajority of Hindu temples in Java were dedicated to Shiva, who Javanese Hindus considered as the God who commands the energy to destroy, recombine and recreate the cycle of life. Small temples were often dedicated to Shiva and his family (wife Durga, son Ganesha). Larger temple complexes include temples for Vishnu and Brahma, but the most majestic, sophisticated and central temple was dedicated to Shiva. The 732 AD Canggal inscription found in Southern Central Java, written in Indonesian Sanskrit script, eulogizes Shiva, calling him God par-excellence. Historical scripts suggest Javanese recognized amongst themselves three sects of Shiva - Mahesvara, Buddhist (Saugata) and Mahabrahmana (Rsi). The Hindu and Buddhist temples co-existed, people intermarried, with occasional couple featuring a Hindu king and Buddhist wife as evidenced by \"Candi Plaosan\", the husband and wife maintaining their different religious beliefs after marriage. Most of the temples are laid out in perfect squares, with secondary temples or lingas arranged geometrically or circularly. However, midst of the perfect symmetries, is present a shift of the temple complex axis and primary statue enclosure axis; this asymmetry is believed to be deliberate because the shift is always to the north and the ratio of asymmetry is exactly the same in a dozen temples where this has been measured. Some of sculptures and reliefs in the temples represent Hindu dance forms, currently seen in India but not in Java. Some in temples Java have a mix of Hindu and Buddhist features which has made attribution and original purpose against later usage difficult to ascertain.\n\nCentral Java region consist of modern Central Java and Yogyakarta provinces. Most of Hindu temples in Cantral Java region are \"candi\" or ancient temples built between 8th to 15th century. Some known Hindu temples in Java include:\n\n\n\n\n\"Pura\" is Balinese Hindu temples. Balinese Hinduism is the continuation of Javanese Hindu Dharmic tradition developed in Java between the 8th to 15th century. After Islam toppled Hinduism in Java circa 15th century, the remnants of this ancient Indonesian Hinduism are confined in Bali. Balinese Hinduism incorporate native Austronesian and Hindu worship of ancestors batara-s in Balinese from Sanskrit pitr-s) next to the general ideas from Hinduism of Vedic deities, terms and rituals imported from India. In Bali, a \"Pura\" (Balinese temple) is designed as an open-air worship place within a walled compound. The compound walls have a series of intricately decorated gates without doors for the devotee to enter. The design, plan and layout of the holy \"pura\" follows a square layout.\n\nToday, Balinese Hindus are concentrated in Bali island and some other cities in Indonesia. In Bali, Hindu Balinese temples (\"Pura\") can be found quite easily, since they are the majority in the island. Outside Bali, they can be found too but not too many, for mostly these temples were followed the migration and only to accommodate Balinese people outside Bali, such as Balinese temples in Greater Jakarta.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Kovil\" or \"koil\" (\"kuil\" in Indonesian) are used to refer Indian Hindu temples. Because of the influx of Indian immigrants into Indonesia back in the 19th century, there are numbers of Indian-style temples erected in Indonesian cities, especially in Medan and Jakarta. The Indian Hindu temples in Indonesia followed closely the design, style, layout and architecture commonly found in India and neighboring Malaysia and Singapore. Tamil Hindus are most concentrated in Medan, North Sumatra. There are around 40 Hindu temples in Medan and nearby but only a few Balinese Hindu temples in North Sumatra. Balaji Venkateshvara Temple (Pasar IV Padang Bulan, Medan) is developed by Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam groups. Punjabis are mostly Sikh and Hindu. Most of them mixed these religions and some of them can speak Punjabi. Hindi and Sindhi are concentrated in Jakarta and usually open textile and garment business. There are around 12 Sikh temples in Indonesia.\n\n\n\n\nCompared to Indian Hindu temples, there are relatively few Hindu temples of Indonesian architecture outside the country. They are as follows:\n\n"}

{"id": "8763163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8763163", "title": "Medieval Christian views on Muhammad", "text": "Medieval Christian views on Muhammad\n\nDuring the Early Middle Ages, Christendom largely viewed Islam as a Christological heresy and Muhammad as a false prophet. By the Late Middle Ages, Islam was more typically grouped with heathenism, and Muhammad was viewed as inspired by the devil. A more relaxed or benign view of Islam only developed in the modern period, after the Islamic empires ceased to be an acute military threat to Europe. See Orientalism.\n\nThe earliest documented Christian knowledge of Muhammad stems from Byzantine sources, written shortly after Muhammad's death in 632. With the Crusades of the High Middle Ages, and the wars against the Ottoman Empire during the Late Middle Ages, the Christian reception of Muhammad became more polemical, moving from the classification as a heretic to depiction of Muhammad as a servant of Satan or as the Antichrist, who will be suffering tortures in Hell.\n\nIn contrast to the views of Muhammad in Islam, the Christian image stayed highly negative for over a millennium.\n\nThe earliest written Christian knowledge of Muhammad stems from Byzantine sources, written shortly after Muhammad's death in 632. In the anti-Jewish polemic the \"Teaching of Jacob\", a dialogue between a recent Christian convert and several Jews, one participant writes that his brother \"wrote to [him] saying that a deceiving prophet has appeared amidst the Saracens\". Another participant in the \"Doctrina\" replies about Muhammad: \"He is deceiving. For do prophets come with sword and chariot?, …[Y]ou will discover nothing true from the said prophet except human bloodshed\". Though Muhammad is never called by his name, there seems to have been knowledge of his existence. It also appears that both Jews and Christians viewed him in a negative light. Other contemporary sources, such as the writings of Sophronius of Jerusalem, show there was no knowledge of the Saracens having their own prophet or faith, and only remark that the Saracen attacks must be a punishment for Christian sins.\n\nKnowledge of Muhammad was available in Christendom from after the early expansion of his religion and, later, the translation of a polemical work by John of Damascus, who used the phrase \"false prophet in \"Heresies in Epitome: How They Began and Whence They Drew Their Origin.\". According to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" Christian knowledge of Muhammad's life \"was nearly always used abusively\". Another influential source was the Epistolae Saraceni or the “Letters of a Saracen” written by an Oriental Christian and translated into Latin from Arabic. From the 9th century onwards, highly negative biographies of Muhammad were written in Latin, such as the one by Álvaro of Córdoba proclaiming him the Antichrist. Christendom also gained some knowledge of Muhammad through the Mozarabs of Spain, such as the 9th-century Eulogius of Córdoba, who was one of the Martyrs of Córdoba.\n\nIn the 11th century Petrus Alphonsi, a Jew who converted to Christianity, was another Mozarab source of information on Muhammad. Later during the 12th century Peter the Venerable, who saw Muhammad as the precursor to the Antichrist and the successor of Arius, ordered the translation of the Quran into Latin (\"Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete\") and the collection of information on Muhammad so that Islamic teachings could be refuted by Christian scholars.\n\nDuring the 13th century European biographers completed their work on the life of Muhammad in a series of works by scholars such as Peter Pascual, Riccoldo da Monte di Croce, and Ramon Llull in which Muhammad was depicted as an Antichrist while Islam was shown to be a Christian heresy. The fact that Muhammad was unlettered, that he married a wealthy widow, that in his later life he had several wives, that he was involved in several wars, and that he died like an ordinary person in contrast to the Christian belief in the supernatural end of Jesus' earthly life were all arguments used to discredit Muhammad.\n\nMedieval scholars and churchmen held that Islam was the work of Muhammad who in turn was inspired by Satan. Kenneth Setton wrote that Muhammad was frequently calumniated and made a subject of legends taught by preachers as fact. For example, in order to show that Muhammad was the anti-Christ, it was asserted that Muhammad died not in the year 632 but in the year 666 – the number of the beast – in another variation on the theme the number \"666\" was also used to represent the period of time Muslims would hold sway of the land. A verbal expression of Christian contempt for Islam was expressed in turning his name from Muhammad to Mahound, the \"devil incarnate\". Others usually confirmed to pious Christians that Muhammad had come to a bad end. According to one version after falling into a drunken stupor he had been eaten by a herd of swine, and this was ascribed as the reason why Muslims proscribed consumption of alcohol and pork. In another account of the alcohol ban, Muhammad learns about the Bible from a Jew and a heretical Arian monk. Muhammad and the monk get drunk and fall asleep. The Jew kills the monk with Muhammad's sword. He then blames Muhammad, who, believing he has committed the crime in a drunken rage, bans alcohol.\n\n\"Leggenda di Maometto\" is another example of such a story. In this version, as a child Muhammad was taught the black arts by a heretical Christian villain who escaped imprisonment by the Christian Church by fleeing to the Arabian Peninsula; as an adult he set up a false religion by selectively choosing and perverting texts from the Bible to create Islam. It also ascribed the Muslim holiday of Friday \"dies Veneris\" (day of Venus), as against the Jewish (Saturday) and the Christian (Sunday), to his followers' depravity as reflected in their multiplicity of wives. A highly negative depiction of Muhammad as a heretic, false prophet, renegade cardinal or founder of a violent religion also found its way into many other works of European literature, such as the chansons de geste, William Langland's \"Piers Plowman\", and John Lydgate's \"The Fall of the Princes\".\nThe thirteenth century \"Golden Legend\", a best-seller in its day containing a collection of hagiographies, describes \"Magumeth (Mahomet, Muhammad)\" as \"a false prophet and sorcerer\", detailing his early life and travels as a merchant through his marriage to the widow, Khadija and goes on to suggest his \"visions\" came as a result of epileptic seizures and the interventions of a renegade Nestorian monk named Sergius.\n\nIn Dante Alighieri's \"Divine Comedy\", Muhammad is in the ninth ditch of Malebolge, the eighth realm, designed for those who have caused schism; specifically, he was placed among the Sowers of Religious Discord. Muhammad is portrayed as split in half, with his entrails hanging out, representing his status as a heresiarch (Canto 28):\nThis scene is frequently shown in illustrations of the \"Divine Comedy\". Muhammad is represented in a 15th-century fresco \"Last Judgment\" by Giovanni da Modena and drawing on Dante, in the San Petronio Basilica in Bologna, as well as in artwork by Salvador Dalí, Auguste Rodin, William Blake, and Gustave Doré.\n\nOne common allegation laid against Muhammad was that he was an impostor who, in order to satisfy his ambition and his lust, propagated religious teachings that he knew to be false. Cultural critic and author Edward Said wrote in \"Orientalism\" regarding Dante's depiction of Muhammad:\n\nA more positive interpretation appears in the 13th-century \"Estoire del Saint Grail\", the first book in the vast Matter of Britain, the Lancelot-Grail. In describing the travels of Joseph of Arimathea, keeper of the Holy Grail, the author says that most residents of the Middle East were pagans until the coming of Muhammad, who is shown as a true prophet sent by God to bring Christianity to the region. This mission however failed when Muhammad's pride caused him to alter God's wishes, thereby deceiving his followers. Nevertheless, Muhammad's religion is portrayed as being greatly superior to paganism.\n\nThe depiction of Islam in the \"Travels of Sir John Mandeville\" is also relatively positive, though with many inaccurate and mythical features. It is said that Muslims are easily converted to Christianity because their beliefs are already so similar in many ways, and that they believe that only the Christian revelation will last until the end of the world. The moral behaviour of Muslims at the time is shown as superior to that of Christians, and as a standing reproach to Christian society.\n\nDepictions of Muhammad in the form of picaresque novel began to appear from the 13th century onward, such as in Alexandre du Pont's \"Roman de Mahom\", the translation of the Mi'raj, the \"Escala de Mahoma\" (“The Ladder of Muhammad”) by the court physician of Alfonso X of Castile and León and his son.\n\nMedieval European literature often referred to Muslims as \"infidels\" or \"pagans\", in sobriquets such as the \"paynim foe\". These depictions such as those in \"The Song of Roland\" represent Muslims worshiping Muhammad (spelt e.g. 'Mahom' and 'Mahumet') as a god, and depict them worshiping various deities in the form of \"idols\", ranging from Apollyon to Lucifer, but ascribing to them a chief deity known as \"Termagant\".\n\nConversely, in medieval romances such as the French Arthurian cycle, pagans such as the ancient Britons or the inhabitants of \"Sarras\" before the conversion of King Evelake, who presumably lived well before the birth of Muhammad, are often described as worshipping the same array of gods and as identical to the imagined (Termagant-worshipping) Muslims in every respect. In the same vein, the definition of \"Saracen\" in Raymond of Penyafort's \"Summa de Poenitentia\" starts by describing the Muslims but ends by including every person who is neither a Christian nor a Jew.\n\nWhen the Knights Templar were being tried for heresy reference was often made to their worship of a demon Baphomet, which was notable by implication for its similarity to the common rendition of Muhammad's name used by Christian writers of the time, Mahomet. All these and other variations on the theme were all set in the \"temper of the times\" of what was seen as a Muslim-Christian conflict as Medieval Europe was building a concept of \"the great enemy\" in the wake of the quickfire success of the early Muslim conquests shortly after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, as well as the lack of real information in the West of the mysterious East.\n\nMuhammad is characterized as \"pseudo-prophet\" in Byzantine and post-Byzantine religious and historic texts, as for example by Niketas Choniates (12th-13th c.).\n\n"}
{"id": "27357444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27357444", "title": "Organized secularism", "text": "Organized secularism\n\nIn Belgium, organized secularism (, ) is the local associations and organizations which provide moral support for naturalist, atheist, agnostic, secular humanist, freethinking, Bright, or irreligious and non-confessional citizens. A person who subscribes to such entities or ideologies, or at least espouses an interest in \"free inquiry\" apart from religious traditions is described as a \"secular\" or \"free-thinker\" (, ).\n\nIn Dutch-speaking Belgium, the leading humanist group is \"deMens.nu\" (Humanity Now, formerly known as the Union of Liberal Associations), which acts as a national federation for the non-religious and an umbrella group for local \"liberal humanist\" and freethought associations. In French-speaking Belgium it is the \"Centre d'Action Laïque\" (CAL, or Centre for Secular Action).\n\nIn contrast to the French model for communal organization for irreligionists and nontheists, the Belgian model is considerably more structured and tight-knit due to the Netherlands-like pillarization of Belgian religious systems and communities; in such a structure, various social organizations, such as scouting troops, trade unions and cooperatives and mutual societies are duplicated for each religious or philosophical community (Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Muslim, socialist, liberal, etc.). Hence, many Belgian nontheists and secular humanists participate in congregation-style services led by secular pastors and chaplains. This parallels the distinction in the United States between secular humanists and religious humanists, who differ according to their view of humanism as an analytical term for their implicit beliefs or a distinct religion-like philosophy.\n\nCurrently, section 181 of the Belgian Constitution provides as follows:\n\nUnder § 1st, recognized the Catholic religion, the Protestant, the Anglican, Orthodox worship, Jewish worship and the Muslim faith.\n\nUnder § 2, \"Act of June 21, 2002 on the Central Council of Philosophical non-denominational Communities of Belgium, delegates and institutions responsible for the management of financial and material interests of recognized non-confessional philosophical communities\" recognizes a \"philosophical non-confessional community\" by province and at national level a \"Central Secular Council\", composed of the \"Secular Action Center\" on the French side and the \"United Liberal Associations\" on the Dutch side.\n\n\nAs part of that public status, there are many secular organizations – often much older than the public forum which are also meeting places for people with a common conception of life and homes of secularism have been started in many places for this purpose (sometimes with the support of municipal authorities).\n\nSome associations offer legal assistance on a non-denominational philosophical basis and therefore constitute an alternative to chaplains in hospitals, prisons, army or in the city. Some of these associations organize ceremonies celebrating locally for those who ask some key moments of life:\n\nThese ceremonies are an alternative rite of passage for those who wish to socialize some important moments of their lives without recourse to the splendours of a religion in which they can identify.\n\nThe budget at the expense of the Belgian state in 2003 for these grants amounted to € 9,010,190.\n\nThe Central Secular Council, consisting of the Secular Action Center (Walloon-oriented) and the Union of Liberal Associations (Flemish-oriented), assembles a large number of civil organizations which service non-confessional individuals and families.\n\nOf course, associations \"secular\" in this sense also exist in France and in many other countries. A public status, assimilating this type of organization to a \"recognized religion\" are particularly Norway and Germany. The Norwegian organization has even won the right to solemnize marriages valid under civil law as well as the recognized churches.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Humanists UK (which inherited the British wing of the Ethical Culture movement) is the largest provider of Humanist officiants and celebrants for ceremonies and rituals.\n\nIn the United States, Freethought congregations have existed since the mid-19th century, when German freethinkers and anti-clericalists emigrated from their homeland in the midst of the 1848 Revolution; they were among the first to establish openly \"free congregations\" in the country. Today, Greg Epstein currently heads the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard University, which was founded in 1974 by current Chaplain Emeritus and former Roman Catholic priest Tom Ferrick.\n\nIn addition, the Ethical Culture movement and most Unitarian Universalist churches carry out services for, and welcome participation from, non-theists and secular humanists.\n\n"}

Shomrei Emet was briefly affiliated with the counter-missionary organization, Jews for Judaism, Jerusalem during 2008.\n\nPenina was born into a secular Jewish home in Lakewood Township, New Jersey. After a traumatic childhood, Penina embraced Christianity in high school, and then went on to Miami Christian College (Now Trinity University) where she obtained a Bible Certificate. In college Penina became certified in the Evangelism Explosion (EE) program, was trained and served as a counselor with the Billy Graham Crusade several times and was certified as a crisis pregnancy counselor.\n\nShortly after leaving Miami Christian College, Penina married Paul Taylor, who had attended Moody Bible Institute and the two of them continued to serve in lay leadership positions in a variety of churches.\n\nIn 1991, Paul and Penina became involved in the Messianic movement and in 1994 Paul and Penina, along with Penina's parents, started the Messianic congregation, Knesset Hashuvim in Bowie, Maryland. During this time, Penina began reading books about Orthodox Judaism and the four leaders adopted the concept of \"Torah Observant Messianic Judaism.\" Penina's father, Yeshayahu Heiliczer, established the \"Association of Torah Observant Messianics\" or ATOM.\n\nAfter moving to Baltimore, Maryland in 2000 - while still Messianic Jews, Paul and Penina began to attend an Orthodox synagogue where they were introduced by the rabbi to the (then) director of Jews for Judaism, Mark Powers. As a result of their discussion with Mark, Penina rejected all forms of Christianity, including Messianic Judaism, and adopted Orthodox Judaism.\n\nIn 2009, Penina published her first book, \"Coming Full Circle: A Jewish Woman's Journey through Christianity and Back\", which narrates her spiritual journey through Evangelical Christianity, Messianic Judaism, and finally Orthodox Judaism.\n\nIn 2011, Penina published her second book, \"Scripture Twisting\", which examines Christian claims for the messiahship of Jesus, and the Jewish response to these claims.\n\nIn addition to publishing her books, Penina lectures and teaches around the world at Jewish centers, seminaries, and yeshivas, discussing her religious journey at synagogues and with youth groups, engaging in Jewish polemics against Messianic-Christian interpretations of the Hebrew Bible, and opines on the nature of the relationship between Israel and Evangelical Christianity.\n\nMore recently, Penina has been teaching on personal growth, marriage, and relationships.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "458277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=458277", "title": "Red Jacket", "text": "Red Jacket\n\nRed Jacket (known as Otetiani in his youth and Sagoyewatha [Keeper Awake] \"Sa-go-ye-wa-tha\" as an adult because of his oratorical skills) (c. 1750–January 20, 1830) was a Seneca orator and chief of the Wolf clan, based in western New York. On behalf of his nation, he negotiated with the new United States after the American Revolutionary War, when the Seneca as British allies were forced to cede much land following the defeat of the British; he signed the Treaty of Canandaigua (1794). He helped secure some Seneca territory in New York state, although most of his people had migrated to Canada for resettlement after the Paris Treaty.\n\nRed Jacket's speech on \"Religion for the White Man and the Red\" (1805) has been preserved as an example of his great oratorical style.\n\nRed Jacket's birthplace has long been a matter of debate. Some historians claim he was born about 1750 at \"Kanadaseaga\", also known as the Old Seneca Castle. Present-day Geneva, New York, developed near here, at the foot of Seneca Lake. Others believe he was born near Cayuga Lake and present-day Canoga, Others say he was born south of present-day Branchport, at Keuka Lake near the mouth of Basswood Creek. It is known that he grew up with his family at Basswood Creek, and his mother was buried there after her death. The Iroquois had a matrilineal kinship system, with inheritance and descent figured through the maternal line. Red Jacket was considered to be born into his mother's Wolf Clan, and his social status was based on her family and clan.\n\nRed Jacket lived much of his adult life in Seneca territory in the Genesee River Valley in western New York. In the later years of his life, Red Jacket moved to Canada for a short period of time. He and the Mohawk chief Joseph Brant became bitter enemies and rivals before the American Revolutionary War, although they often met together at the Iroquois Confederacy's Longhouse. During the war, when most of both the Seneca and Mohawk were allies of the British, Brant contemptuously referred to Red Jacket as \"cow killer\". He alleged that at the Battle of Newtown in 1779, Red Jacket killed a cow and used the blood as evidence to claim he had killed an American rebel.\nRed Jacket became famous as an orator, speaking for the rights of his people. After the war, he played a prominent role in negotiations with the new United States federal government. In 1792 he led a delegation of 50 Native American leaders to Philadelphia. The US president George Washington presented him with a special \"peace medal\", a large oval of silverplate engraved with an image of Washington on the right-hand side shaking Red Jacket's hand; below was inscribed \"George Washington\", \"Red Jacket\", and \"1792\".\n\nRed Jacket wore this medal on his chest in every portrait painted of him. (Today the medal is held in the collection of the Buffalo History Museum.)He was also presented with a silver inlaid half-stock long rifle, bearing his initials and Wolf clan emblem in the stock and his later name \"Sagoyewatha\" inlaid on the barrel. This rifle has been in private hands since his death.\n\nIn 1794, Red Jacket was a signatory, along with Cornplanter, Handsome Lake, and fifty other Iroquois leaders, of the Treaty of Canandaigua, by which they were forced to cede much of their land to the United States due to the defeat of their British ally during the war. Britain had ceded all its claims to land in the colonies without consulting the Iroquois or other Native American allies. The treaty confirmed peace with the United States, as well as the boundaries of the postwar the Phelps and Gorham Purchase (1788) of most of the Seneca land east of the Genesee River in western New York.\n\nIn 1790 Jemima Wilkinson, known as The Publick Universal Friend, and her Philadelphia Society of Friends were the first settlers in the formerly Seneca region. Despite the pillaging of the Native River-Settlement in Ah-Wa-Ga Oswego, New York, by generals Clinton and Sullivan during the Revolutionary War, the Society made peace with the wary Seneca tribe. Most of the Seneca, including Red Jacket, recognized the Universal Friend as Chieftain. The Seneca Tribe made peace with settlers in the Finger Lakes region, but they suffered hardship in the Genesee Region and other parts of Western New York.\n\nIn 1797, by the Treaty of Big Tree, Robert Morris paid $100,000 to the Seneca for rights to some of their lands west of the Genesee River. (This area developed as present-day Geneseo in Livingston County). Red Jacket had tried to prevent the sale but, unable to persuade the other chiefs, he gave up his opposition. As often occurred, Morris used gifts of liquor to the Seneca men and trinkets to the women to \"grease\" the sale. Morris had previously purchased the land from Massachusetts, subject to the Indian title, then sold it to the Holland Land Company for speculative development. He retained only the Morris Reserve, an estate near the present-day city of Rochester. During the negotiations, Brant was reported to have told an insulting story about Red Jacket. Cornplanter intervened and prevented the Seneca leader from attacking and killing Brant.\nRed Jacket took his name, one of several he used as an adult, for a highly favored embroidered coat given to him by the British for his wartime services. The Seneca allied with the British Crown during the American Revolution, both because of their long trading relationships and in the hope that the British could limit colonial encroachment on their territory. After their ally lost, the Seneca were forced to cede much of their territory to the United States. Many of their people resettled in Canada at what is now the Six Nations Reserve in Ontario. In the War of 1812, Red Jacket supported the American side.\n\nHis later adult name, \"Sagoyewatha\", which roughly translates as \"he keeps them awake\", was given by the Seneca about 1780 in recognition of his oratory skill. When in 1805 Mr. Cram, a New England missionary, asked to do mission work among the Seneca, Red Jacket responded by saying that the Seneca had suffered much at the hands of Europeans. His speech, \"Religion for the White Man and the Red\", expressed his profound belief that Native American religion was fitting and sufficient for Seneca and Native American culture. It has been documented and preserved as one of the best examples of North American oratory.\n\nRed Jacket developed a problem with alcohol and deeply regretted having taken his first drink (see following quote). When asked if he had children, the chief, who had lost most of his offspring to illness, said:\n\nRed Jacket was once a great man, and in favor with the Great Spirit. He was a lofty pine among the smaller trees of the forest. But, after years of glory, he degraded himself by drinking the firewater of the white man. The Great Spirit has looked upon him in anger, and his lightning has stripped the pine of its branches.\n\nIn his later years, \"Segoyewatha\" lived in Buffalo, New York. On his death, his remains were buried in an Indian cemetery (now within Seneca Indian Park in South Buffalo, New York). In 1876, the politician William C. Bryant presented a plan to the Council of the Seneca Nation to reinter Red Jacket's remains in Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo. This was carried out on October 9, 1884. The proceedings, with papers documenting speeches given by Horatio Hale, General Ely S. Parker (Red Jacket's nephew's grandson, known as a \"clan grandson,\" who inherited the famous medal), and others, were published (Buffalo, 1884). A memorial to Red Jacket still stands within Seneca Indian Park.\n\nAccording to \"Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography\", \"Several portraits were made of him. George Catlin painted him twice, Henry Inman once, and Robert W. Weir did his portrait in 1828, when Red Jacket was on a visit to New York City. Fitz-Greene Halleck has celebrated him in song.\"\n\nThis famous speech, also known as his talk on \"Religion for the White Man and the Red\", is an example of his great skill as an orator. He spoke in 1805 as a response to a request by Jacob Cram, a New England missionary, to evangelize among the Seneca. On this day, the two men met in Buffalo Creek, New York, to discuss their religious beliefs. After meeting with the leaders of the Seneca delegation, Red Jacket provided a thought-out response representing his people as a whole. He responded to Cram's words: \"There is but one religion, and but one way to serve God, and if you do not embrace the right way, you cannot be happy hereafter\". He argued peacefully that the European Americans and Native American peoples should each have the right to worship the religion that suits them best.\n\nAt the time, the Iroquois of present-day New York State were having difficulty dealing with the constant increase of European immigrants and encroachment on their remaining lands. As the numbers of European Americans grew in the Iroquois territories, the two peoples' opposing cultures became more and more apparent.\n\nRed Jacket made it clear that he and his people would not change their religious beliefs based on the white man's word. He began, \"It was the will of the Great Spirit that we should meet together this day. He orders all things, and has given us a fine day for our Council.\" He proceeded to count all the blessings on the day, attributing them to the Great Spirit. \"For all these favors we thank the Great Spirit, and Him only.\"\n\nRed Jacket said that his peoples' beliefs were very like those of the missionary, differing only in the names of their omnipresent and almighty creator. Their creation stories were the same. \"There was a time when our forefathers owned this great island. Their seats extended from the rising to the setting sun. The Great Spirit had made it for the use of Indians. He had created the buffalo, the deer, and other animals for food ... He had caused the earth to produce corn for bread. All this He had done for his red children, because He loved them.\" The difference between the faiths involved not whether an almighty creator existed, but which faith was the truth and deserved to be followed.\n\nRed Jacket questioned the legitimacy of the white man's beliefs. \"You say that you are sent to instruct us how to worship the Great Spirit agreeably to his mind, and, if we do not take hold of the religion which you white people teach, we shall be unhappy hereafter. You say that you are right and we are lost.\" Iroquois \"separatist\" belief held that there is not necessarily one true religion for all people. Red Jacket acknowledged that the Americans' religious beliefs were based on a sacred text, but said, \"If it was intended for us as well as you, why has not the Great Spirit given to us, and not only to us, but why did he not give to our forefathers, the knowledge of that book, with the means of understanding it rightly?\"\n\nIn conclusion he urged the US Senators to accept different forms of belief. \"The Great Spirit has made us all, but He has made a great difference between his white and red children ... to you He has given the arts. To these He has not opened our eyes. We know these things to be true. Since He has made so great a difference between us in other things, why may we not conclude that he has given us a different religion according to our understanding? The Great Spirit does right. He knows what is best for his children; we are satisfied.\" \"We do not wish to destroy your religion, or take it from you. We only want to enjoy our own.\"\n\nIn his \"Speech to the U.S. Senate\", Red Jacket was respectful and open-minded regarding his visitors' beliefs, hoping that his audience would respond similarly. \"We have listened with attention to what you have said. You requested us to speak our minds freely. This gives us great joy; for we now consider that we stand upright before you, and can speak what we think.\" He reassured his audience that he understood they were far from home, and would waste no time in giving them his answer.\n\nOn the relations between his people and the first white settlers to come to their land, he said, \"They found friends and not enemies ... they asked for a small seat. We took pity on them, granted their request; and they sat amongst us. We gave them corn and meat; they gave us poison.\" He argued that it was wrong to portray his people as savages, when they had shown kindness but received in return only \"poison\" (hard liquor). Further, \n\nYet we did not fear them. We took them to be friends. They called us brothers. We believed them and gave them a larger seat ... they wanted more land; they wanted our country. Our eyes were opened, and our minds became uneasy. You have got our country, but are not satisfied; you want to force your religion upon us.\n\nThe white settlers' actions did not encourage belief in their religion. \"How shall we know when to believe, being so often deceived by the white people?\"\n\nRed Jacket also acknowledged that the white settlers' religion was beset with divisive controversies, unlike his peoples' own faith. \n\nWe also have a religion, which was given to our forefathers, and has been handed down to us their children. We worship in that way. It teaches us to be thankful for all the favors we receive; to love each other, and to be united. We never quarrel about religion.\n\nHe wished his visitors well. \"You have now heard our answer to your talk, and this is all we have to say at present. As we are going to part, we will come and take you by the hand, and hope the Great Spirit will protect you on your journey, and return you safe to your friends.\"\n\nRed Jacket's \"Speech to the U.S. Senate\" expresses his ability to use a distinct form of rhetoric that distinguishes the difference in religious tolerance between the Indians and United States citizens. His emotional appeal to members of the US Senate, whom he feels are neglecting the Indians' right of religious freedom, is an example of his attempt to persuade his audience to recognize their fallacies. He repeatedly refers to the Great Spirit, who he believes oversees both the red and white man.\n\nAt the beginning, he says, \"But we will first look back a little, and tell you what our fathers have told us, and what we have heard from the white people\". Red Jacket is referring to the history of how the white man has treated the red man on the latter's native soil. The white man commonly tried to persuade the Indians, whom he considered less fortunate, to adopt the ways of Western society. Red Jacket noted the Americans had tried to force their religion on the Indian peoples. Red Jacket recognized religion as a cultural right, but he explained that the Indians had inherited their belief system within their culture just as the European Americans had been given the Bible and Christianity. He said that both people came from a similar Great Spirit, yet it is up to the beholder as to how he accepts religion. The attempts of Americans to force Christianity on the Indians violated the liberties of both people. Red Jacket said, \"You have now become a great people, and we have scarcely a place left to spread our blankets. You have got our country, but are not satisfied; you want to force your religion upon us\".\n\nRed Jacket continues to identify the religious continuities that exist between both people with his elaboration on the Great Spirit. He states, \"You say there is but one way to worship and serve the Great Spirit. If there is but one religion, why do you white people differ so much about it? Why not all agreed, as you can all read the book?\". Red Jacket distinguishes the fallacies that exist between the Americans speech and their actions. If the Indians are being secularized for their religious beliefs, yet they believe in one ultimate Creator, just like the Americans, how can they be viewed as a lesser body? Red Jacket says they do not understand the Americans mission to eradicate the Indians based on religion, but Red Jacket sees the Americans as divided in their beliefs. However, he goes on to say that the Great Spirit is not one that can tear the two people apart but ultimately unite them in their ability to peacefully coexist.\n\nRed Jacket's ability to distinguish this form of religious discussion was very favorable to his legacy in history. He argues the injustices of the cultural system in the time period but does not back away from recognizing their common cultural and religious beliefs.\n\nA variety of structures, ships and places were named in his honor, especially in the Finger Lakes region and Buffalo:\n\nU.S. Constitution, Native American influence\n\n\n\n"}

His father was the Vibhandak Rishi, and his mother was a celestial paramour. According to another legend, he was believed to have been born of a doe and from the slight protrusion of his forehead. According to legend, his father was seduced by the celestial danseuse Urvasi by order of Indra, the king of gods, who feared the yogic powers gained out of penance by the rishi could prove fatal to the very existence of heavenly world. The father was seduced and out of his relation with the danseuse was born Rishyasringa.\n\nHowever, immediately after the child was born, Urvashi, after completing the duty she was sent for, left the young born child and her lover and made her way to the heavens. The incident left the father with extreme hatred towards women folk, and he raised the boy in a forest, isolated from society. He never saw any girls or women, and was not told of their existence. The tradition states that he was endowed with magical and miraculous powers.\n\nIn the usual version of the story, at the time that the boy becomes a young man, the kingdom of Anga suffers from drought and famine. The king, Romapada, is told that this can only be alleviated by a brahmin with the powers that come from observance of perfect chastity. The only such person is Rishyasringa. He has to be brought to the city, and be persuaded to carry out the necessary ceremonies. Despite his fear of the power and anger of the boy's father, the king sends young women to introduce the boy into normal society. This was successfully done by Vaishali, Rishyasringa uses his powers, the kingdom receives bountiful rains and Rishyasringa marries Shanta. Much of the story is taken up by accounts of the feelings of the young man as he becomes aware of women for the first time.\n\nIn another version of the story, the forest in which the boy is brought up is part of Anga. The boy's upbringing without knowledge of women is itself the cause of the troubles of the kingdom.\n\nThe story can be found in both the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. According to the \"Ramayana\", Ekashringa was the chief priest when the king Dasharatha performed a yajna to beget progeny, and Rama, Bharata, and the twins Lakshmana and Shatrughna were born.\n\nIn Naḷinikā Jātaka (Jā 526), a sage lives alone in the Himālayas, there is semen in the urine he passes, and a deer who happens to eat the grass in that place gets pregnant from it. A human boy is later born to the deer and he is brought up in complete seclusion from mankind, and most importantly, from womankind.\n\nThe boy's ascetic power becomes so great that Sakka (the Buddhist Indra) in his heaven is worried by it and causes a drought to occur in the country and blames it on the boy. He then convinces the King to send his daughter to seduce him and to break his power. The King and his daughter accept Sakka's reasoning and in good faith – and for the benefit of the country – agree to the plot.\n\nThe girl dresses up as an ascetic and while the father (the Bodhisatta) is away gathering roots and fruits in the forest, she manages to seduce the boy, who has never seen a woman before. Through their revelling, the boy does indeed lose his powers, the girl then leaves. When his father returns, the boy, who has become infatuated with his new friend, tells him all about it, only to be instructed and rebuked by his father, and repent his actions.\n\nThis is not the only story of Isisiṅga that appears in the Jātakas. There is another, and somewhat similar, story just a few pages before, and which is referred to in this story. That is Jātaka 523, the Alambusājātaka, but there Sakka chooses a heavenly nymph to seduce the ascetic. The outcome is the same, the sage is seduced, repents and Sakka is thwarted, but some reason he does not seem upset. In fact, he grants a boon to the seductress.\n\nThe story also appears in the Mahāvastu (Jones' translation pp. 139–147), but Ekaśr̥ṅga, as he is known there, is the Bodhisattva, and Nalinī is Yaśodharā in an earlier existence. There is a variation in the story as without his knowing it, Ekaśr̥ṅga is married to the girl and has to take up his responsibilities, eventually becoming the King and having 32 children, before he retires once again to the forest and regains his former powers.\n\nThe town Kigga near by Sringeri is the place today holds religious values based on Rishyashringa. Lord Shiva temple in the town is said to be worshiped by Rishyashringa. In the modern days also the Jagadguru of Sringeri Sharada Peetham performs pooja at Kigga Sri Rushasringeswara temple for rain or to reduce rain.\n\nThe town of Sringeri in Karnataka is named after this sage. The name \"Sringeri\" is derived from \"Rishya sringa giri (hill), then sringa giri and now sringeri\". This is based on the legend that Sage Rishyasringa performed penance here. The Advaitin philosopher, Adi Shankara, founded the Sringeri Sharada Peetham at Sringeri after seeing a hooded snake giving shelter to a frog in labor, in spite of snakes and frogs being mortal enemies. Adi Shankara realized that the place must have been a spot of penance and established the \"Dakshninamnaya Sharada Peetham\" (Southern Seat of Goddess Sharada) here.\n\nThere is a temple of Rishyashringa in Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh. Idol of Shringa Rishi with goddess Shanta resides in the temple. This place is about 50 km from Kullu. Lord Shringa is the presiding deity of this secluded valley named Banjar.\nThe descendants of Shanta and Rishyasringa are Brahmins in Rajasthan state known as Shringi/ Sukhwal Brahmins.\n\nThere is a sect of Sengar Rajputs who are called the only Rishivanshi rajputs who associate their lineage to Shring Rishi and Mata Shanta.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27107555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27107555", "title": "Shalban Vihara", "text": "Shalban Vihara\n\nShalban vihara (Sanskrit; \"Shalban Bihar\") is an archaeological site in Mainamati, Cumilla, Bangladesh. The ruins are in the middle of the Lalmai hills ridge, and these are of a 7th-century Paharpur-style Buddhist viharas with about 100 cells for monks. It operated through the 12th century.\n\nExcavations have revealed many archaeological artifacts dated to between the 7th and 12th centuries. Most of them are kept in the Mainamati Museum now.\n\nOriginally, the monastery was called \"Bhavadev Bihar\" after the king, but today the Shalban name comes from a grove of Shal (\"shorea robusta\") trees.\n\nBefore 1200 years ago the King Bhava Deva, the fourth ruler of the Early-Deva dynasty built that place on 168 square meters of ground. It was the royal palace for the early Buddhist students. This site, previously called \"Shalban Rajar Bari\", came out after archaeological excavation as a Buddhist monastery and hence termed as Salban vihara from the terracotta seals and copper plates discovered. Its original name is supposed to have been Bhava Deva Mahavihara after the 4th king of the early Deva dynasty which ruled this region from the mid-7th to mid-8th centuries AD. It was built in or on the outskirts of Devaparvata, the Samatata capital bordering the Lalambi forest.\n\nAbout eight kilometres west of Comilla town, lies a range of low hills known as the Mainamati-Lalmai range which is dotted with more than 50 ancient Buddhist settlements dating from the 8th to the 12th centuries. Almost at middle is the Salvan Vihara of 115 cells built around a spacious courtyard with a cruciform temple in the centre. About 5 kilometres north of Shalvan Vihara is Kutila Mura, which is a picturesque relic of a unique Buddhist establishment.\n\nThis was once a self-contained Buddhist monastery where, monks lived, studied and prayed.It was the royal palace for the early Buddhist students.Students from various places come here for their meditation and religious learning. During their study period the students stay in the dormitory/cells around the temple. It’s such a quite place inside a barren forest and one of the greatest tourist spots in Bangladesh.\n\nDeep diggings have revealed four repair and rebuilding phases in the monastery, the earliest corresponding to period III of the cruciform central shrine. No monastery remains corresponding to period I and II (7th century AD) has yet been found. Some scanty and ill-defined remains below the present structure may suggest their existence, probably of smaller size. During the next two phases (period IV and V: 9th–10th centuries AD) new floors and thresholds were built on top of earlier remains. Two interesting features observed inside the cells, fireplaces and ornamental brick-pedestals, were not included in the original plan. Though there was a community kitchen and dining establishment, many of the resident monks (probably sramanas: lay-students) preferred to cook their meals individually inside their cells. The pedestals certainly served the purpose of private cult worship. Discoveries made during explorations and excavations suggests that this establishment may probably have some provision for accommodating poorer lay students (sramanas) from neighbouring settlements with cheaper arrangements for cooking their own food with materials brought from home, an age-old practice still in vogue in certain parts of rural Bengal .\nExcavations at Shalban Vihara have also exposed a number of subsidiary structures including a community dining establishment, a small oblong, a pillared and a square shrine with exquisitely moulded plinth, two oblong chapels and a number of small votive stupas inside, and an interesting medium-sized shrine with a small sanctum connected by a long narrow passage and enclosed by a solid and massive brick structure, a columned terrace and colonnades just outside the monastery quadrangle.\n\nThe large square monastery of 550-foot sides with 115 monastic cells, a dominant central shrine and a number of subsidiary shrines. Stupas and chapels, provides access through its monumental gateway on the north. While the central shrine revealed six building phases and the monastery four. The 1st and 2nd phases of the central shrine remains buried under the ruins of the 3rd, 4th and 5th periods but the remains of the 6th phase have been removed from the top. The cruciform central shrine of third built with the monastery as a single complex.\n\nIn the middle of each wing, the monastery verandah is provided with a shallow projection to serve as the base for a flight of steps leading down to the brick-paved courtyard, the arrangement in the front side being larger and more elaborate. Compared to them, the arrangement in each corner of the monastery is a grand affair. Here, occupying a pair of cells, a solidly built broad and massive staircase leads to the roof or an upper floor. Such elaborate arrangements coupled with the evidence of a strong roof naturally suggest the existence of an upper storey.\n\nThe central cell in each wing is larger, stronger and more elaborate with certain special features such as small pedestals and platforms with decorative mouldings, larger niches, etc. By analogy to similar arrangements in Nalanda and Paharpur monasteries, they certainly represent subsidiary chapels or shrines.\n\nEach of the cells were originally provided with three excellently built corbelled niches in the inner walls, the one in the back wall being larger. Objects recovered in and around them strongly indicate that these were primarily intended for keeping votive images, oil lamps and reading and writing materials.\n\nThe shrine at Shalban Vihara is actually not but six different structures built successively on the same spot in different periods and on different plans. They provide interesting evidence of the evolution and gradual transforming of the traditional Buddhist stupa architecture into that of the Hindu temple. The remains of the first two periods are hidden below the cruciform shrine of period III which was built with the monastery as a single complex. It is an exceedingly interesting piece of architecture resembling in ground plan a Greek cross, 51.8m long with chapels built in the projecting arms. Its basement walls are embellished with a string course of delightfully sculptured terracotta plaques set within parallel bands of ornamental bricks. This shrine bearing a striking resemblance with that of Paharpur represents a fully developed and finished example of the 7th- to 8th-century Buddhist temple architecture of Bengal. Since the Mainamati monuments are unquestionably earlier in date by about a century, and as there are a number of early and intermediary stages of development in this evolutionary process clearly traceable in Mainamati.Mainamati supplied prototypes of cruciform shrines not only for Paharpur and Vikramashila in eastern India but also for the subsequent Buddhist architectural development in Burma, Indonesia and Indochina. The next two periods (IV and V) witnessed an interesting further transformation and development in the plan of the central shrine, the cruciform shape being replaced by an oblong one. Now fully open, spacious and functional, it is much nearer to a Hindu temple. In these structural changes may lie the primary reason for discontinuing the earlier Biddhist tradition of the delightful terracotta decorations in the early Muslim architecture of Bengal, though in a somewhat different form. The main interest in these evolved shrines shifted from the outer walls around the circumambulatory path to the inner chambers with space enough for images, sculptures and architectural decorations, and specially to the principal cult images consecrated in them.\n\nThe finds from excavations at Shalban Vihara have been very rich and valuable which include seven copper-plate inscriptions, about 350 golds and a large number of sculptural specimens in stone, bronze and terracotta, and innumerable terracotta sculptured plaques found both in \"situ\" and otherwise.\n\n"}

{"id": "183528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=183528", "title": "Subdeacon", "text": "Subdeacon\n\nSubdeacon (or sub-deacon) is a title used in various branches of Christianity.\n\nA subdeacon or hypodeacon is the highest of the minor orders of clergy in the Orthodox Church. This order is higher than the reader and lower than the deacon.\n\nLike the reader, the clerical street-dress of the subdeacon is the cassock, which is usually black but only need be so if he is a monk. This is symbolic of his suppression of his own tastes, will, and desires, and his canonical obedience to God, his bishop, and the liturgical and canonical norms of the Church. As a concession in countries where Orthodoxy is little known, many only wear the cassock when attending services or when moving about the faithful on church business. In some jurisdictions in the United States, a clergy-shirt will sometimes be worn instead of a cassock, and is commonly worn buttoned but with no collar or collar-tab to indicate a rank lower than deacon.\n\nThere is a special service for the tonsuring of a subdeacon, although in contemporary practice an acolyte or a reader may receive the bishop's blessing to vest and act as a subdeacon generally or for a particular occasion if there is no subdeacon available. This situation often arises if there is a need for a subdeacon and a likely candidate has stated an intention to marry but has not yet done so, causing a delay in his ordination. The reason for this lies in the fact that the canons prohibit subdeacons to marry after their ordination (just like deacons and priests). This latter stipulation has led, in some places, to the reservation of the formal ordination service as a stepping-stone for candidates for the priesthood, although this is by no means universal. It also means that, while teenagers who show particular fervour may be ordained as acolytes and readers, the subdiaconate is usually reserved for those of more mature years; the canonical minimum age for subdiaconal ordination is twenty years.\n\nA custom in some jurisdictions is that former seminarians who have discerned not to have a calling to the priesthood or diaconate, are, if they wish (and provided that they are married, or being unmarried, do not intend to marry), ordained subdeacons as a sign of investment, faith, and to award their service.\n\nIn the Byzantine Rite, (followed by the majority of Orthodox churches), the subdeacon's liturgical role is primarily that of servant to the bishop. He assists the bishop during hierarchical services, (services at which a hierarch/bishop is present and presiding) by vesting him, by looking after and presenting the trikiridikiri, placing the orletzi, operating the veil and Royal Doors, and handing the bishop and relieving him of all that he needs so as to enable him to perform his role of prayer undistracted. Outside of hierarchical services, the subdeacon serves in the altar as any other server but, as highest-ranking of the minor clergy, is responsible for co-ordinating and leading the serving team. In addition to the above duties, the subdeacon may read the reading from the Epistle at the Divine Liturgy if there is only one deacon. The subdeacon also has practical responsibilities in the care of the altar, by cleaning it, looking after the clergy vestments and the cloths of the Holy Table, cleaning and mending them, and changing them according to the feasts, fasts, and seasons. For this reason, he has a general blessing to touch the Holy Table and the Table of Oblation, which Readers and other servers may not do. He is also responsible for the training of new servers.\n\nThe clerical street-wear of a subdeacon is the inner-cassock (podryasnik) and outer cassock (ryasa). Many wear the cassock only when present among the church community or attending to church business.\n\nFor services, the subdeacon is vested in a sticharion with an orar tied around his waist, up over his shoulders (forming a cross in back), and with the ends crossed over, and tucked under the section around the waist. This distinguishes them from acolytes in those jurisdictions where acolytes are ordained and blessed to wear the orar, as the latter do not wear the orar crossed in front but simply hanging straight down.\n\nThe ordination to the subdiaconate is performed outside of the altar and in a context other than the Divine Liturgy. The reader who is to be tonsured subdeacon is presented to the bishop by two other subdeacons, who first lead him to the nave. There he faces east and makes a prostration before turning to make three prostrations towards the bishop, moving further west after each one. He is then led to stand immediately before the bishop. The subdeacons present the orar to the bishop, who blesses it. The ordinand then kisses the orar and the bishop's hand, and the subdeacons vest the ordinand in the orar.\n\nThe bishop blesses the ordinand three times with the sign of the Cross upon his head, then lays his right hand upon the ordinand's head and prays the prayer of ordination. The new subdeacon kisses the bishop's right hand and makes a prostration before the bishop, after which the more senior subdeacons drape a towel over his shoulders and present him with a ewer and basin, with which he washes the bishop's hands after the usual manner. The bishop dries his hands and the three subdeacons receive the bishop's blessing and kiss his hands.\n\nThe senior subdeacons return to the altar while the new subdeacon, still holding the ewer and basin, stands on the solea, facing the icon of the Mother of God and saying particular prayers quietly. The Sixth Hour is completed and the Divine Liturgy continues as usual. The subdeacon remains on the solea until the Cherubikon, when he and two senior subdeacons wash the bishop's hands as usual.\n\nAt the Great Entrance, the new subdeacon joins on the very end of the procession, carrying the ewer and basin and, after the commemorations, takes the blessed water to the people so that they may bless themselves with it.\n\nOn occasions when there is a shortage of altar servers, the newly ordained subdeacon may be required to serve at the Liturgy, in which case the taking of the blessed water to the people may be omitted, and he may be asked not to stay on the solea but rather to assist with serving duties in the altar and at the entrances.\n\nIn the Western Rite, the subdeacon's role is essentially as an assistant to the deacon in performing his diaconal role. This perhaps more clearly reflects the origins of the subdiaconate than in the Byzantine Rite, where, rather than the subdeacon assisting the deacon, many formerly diaconal functions have, over time, come to be seen as properly belonging to the subdeacon in his own right. In the Western Rite, the subdeacon is charged with reading the epistle at a High Mass (the most solemn and elaborate form of the western Eucharist) - a role that may be performed by a priest or reader at a simpler form of the mass, and with assisting the deacon with the preparation of the oblations and with carrying them to the altar, (in those western rites that retain the Offertory Procession). He also assists the deacon during the reading of the Gospel by carrying the Gospel book to and from (depending on the rite used) the place of proclamation, and by acting as a support for the book while the Gospel is read. At pontifical services (services at which a pontiff or bishop is present and presiding), the subdeacon also assists the deacon in the vesting of the bishop.\n\nThe usual street-wear of the subdeacon is the cassock. (There is no distinction between an inner and outer cassock in the Western Rite, and all clergy wear one cassock only).\n\nDuring services, the subdeacon vests in an alb, over which he wears the maniple, the cincture, and the tunicle. Unlike his brother subdeacons in the Byzantine Rite who wear the orar, the Western Rite subdeacon does not wear its western equivalent - the stole - which is reserved for deacons, priests, and bishops.\n\nPrior to the reform instituted by Pope Paul VI with his \"motu proprio\" \"Ministeria quaedam\" of 15 August 1972, the subdiaconate was regarded as the lowest of the three major orders of the Latin Catholic Church. He decreed that \"the major order of subdiaconate no longer exists in the Latin Church\" and that the functions previously assigned to the subdeacon are now entrusted to the acolyte and the reader; he also decreed that, where the local episcopal conference so desired, the acolyte could be called a subdeacon.\n\nThe traditional rites of ordination to the subdiaconate and the minor orders (those of acolyte, exorcist, reader and porter) are still employed for members of certain Catholic religious institutes and societies of apostolic life authorized to use the 1962 form of the Roman Rite.\n\nAs men in major orders, subdeacons as well as deacons, were styled in English-speaking countries as \"The Rev. Mr.\". In French the title of \"Abbé\" was often given to them and even to those in minor orders, as in the case of Franz Liszt.\n\nThe subdiaconate was only generally considered a major order in the Latin church from the late 12th century. Even after that, ordination of a subdeacon does not include the laying on of hands. Instead, the bishop hands to him an empty chalice and paten, his vestments, cruets of wine and water, and the Book of the Epistles and pronounces a prayer of blessing for him. As a recipient of a major order, a subdeacon could not contract marriage, and any breach by him of the obligation to observe celibacy was classified as a sacrilege (cf. canon 132 of the 1917 Code of Canon Law). Canon 135 of the same Code of Canon Law obliged him to say all the canonical hours of the Divine Office (Liturgy of the Hours or Breviary).\n\nThe other major orders were those of the deacon and priest, that of bishop not being then considered an order distinct from that of priesthood. Thus, in speaking of orders, the Catechism of the Council of Trent declares : \"Their number, according to the uniform and universal doctrine of the Catholic Church, is seven, Porter, Reader, Exorcist, Acolyte, Sub-deacon, Deacon and Priest. [...] Of these, some are greater, which are called 'Holy', some lesser, which are called 'Minor Orders'. The great or Holy Orders are Sub-deaconship, Deaconship and Priesthood; the lesser or Minor Orders are Porter, Reader, Exorcist, and Acolyte\".\n\nToday the Latin Church, as stated in the Code of Canon Law in force since 1983 (\"The orders are the episcopate, the presbyterate, and the diaconate\"), recognizes only three orders, those of bishop, priest (presbyter) and deacon, also referred to as \"sacred orders\" or \"holy orders\".. In line with Pope Paul VI's \"Ministeria quaedam\", what were called minor orders are now called ministries.\n\nIn the Solemn High Mass form of Tridentine Mass, the duties of a subdeacon include those of crucifer, singing the Epistle, holding the Book of Gospels while the deacon sings the Gospel, carrying it back to the celebrant afterwards and assisting the priest or deacon in setting the altar. The subdeacon's specific vestment is the tunicle, in practice almost indistinguishable in form from the deacon's dalmatic (the tunicle is sometimes somewhat longer than the dalmatic or had slightly less elaborate decoration, but this is often unnoticeable by the casual church-goer). He wears a maniple. Unlike deacon and priest, he never wears a stole. He also wears a humeral veil while holding the paten from the Offertory to the \"Our Father\"; and, if the chalice and paten with host are not already on the altar, he also uses the humeral veil when bringing these to the altar at the Offertory. In practice, the roles of deacon and subdeacon in Solemn High Mass have generally been performed by men already ordained as priests, wearing the subdiaconal or diaconal vestments.\n\nIn the Eastern Catholic Churches, the order of subdeacon is the highest of the minor orders and its functions are equivalent to those of Orthodox subdeacons.\n\nWhilst the office of subdeacon was not included in the Orders of Clergy when the Church of England was reformed during the 16th century, certain churches and communities in the Anglican Communion and within the Anglican Continuing Churches assign a layperson to act as subdeacon in the celebration of the liturgy of the mass or Holy Eucharist (especially Solemn High Mass). However, this is considered a liturgical function one fulfills and not an order to which one is ordained. In some dioceses and provinces, laypersons who act as subdeacons in this manner may be required to be specifically authorised by the respective bishop or archbishop. In practice, an Anglican subdeacon performs similar roles to those performed in Latin Rite Catholic or Western Rite Orthodox churches. The proper garments of the subdeacon are the alb and tunicle.\n\n"}

The founding member was Debendranath Tagore, previously of the Brahmo Samaj, eldest son of influential entrepreneur Dwarkanath Tagore, and eventually father to renowned polymath Rabindranath Tagore. In 1859, the Tattwabodhinī Sabhā were dissolved back into the Brāhmo Samāj by Debendranath Tagore.\n\nOn 6 October 1839 Debendranath Tagore established \"Tattvaranjini Sabha\" which was shortly thereafter renamed the Tattwabodhini (\"Truth-seekers\") Sabha. Initially confined to immediate members of the Tagore family, in 2 years it mustered over 500 members. In 1840 Debendranath published a Bangla translation of \"Katha Upanishad\". A modern researcher describes the Sabha's philosophy as \"modern middle-class (bourgeois) Vedanta\". Among its first members were the \"two giants of Hindu reformation and Bengal Renaissance, Akshay Kumar Datta \"who in 1839 emerged from the life of an anonymous squalor-beset individual\" and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar the \"indigenous modernizer\".\n\nOn 7th Pous 1765 Shaka (1843) Debendranath Tagore and twenty other Tattwabodhini stalwarts were formally invited by Pt. Vidyabagish into the Trust of Brahmo Sabha. The Pous Mela at Santiniketan starts on this day. From this day forth, the Tattwabodhini Sabha dedicated itself to promoting Ram Mohan Roy's creed. The other Brahmins who swore the First Covenant of Brahmoism are:-\n\nIn Nov 1855 the Rev. Charles Dall (a Unitarian minister of Boston) arrived in Calcutta to start his mission and immediately established contact with Debendranath and other Brahmos. Debendranath's suspicion of foreigners alienated Dall and in 1857, Debendranath Tagore barred the entry of the Reverend from the Sabha premises for preaching \"the name of Christ who some people worship as God\" within. Debendranath then proceeded on spiritual retreat to Simla. Dall, immediately formed a counter group \"The friends of Rammmohun Roy Society\" and then got admitted a protégé to Sabha. The presence of Dall's protégé Keshub Chandra Sen (a non-Brahmin) into the Calcutta Brahmo Sabha in 1857 while Debendranath was away in Simla caused considerable stress in the movement, with many long time Tattvabodhini Brahmin members publicly leaving the Brahmo Sabha and institutions due to his high-handed ways. In September 1858, Debendranath returned to Calcutta to resolve the simmering disputes. but his conservative mien did not allow him to take decisive steps. He proceeded on a sea voyage to Ceylon accompanied by Sen and his 2nd son Satyendranath (a firm admirer of Mr Sen) but no concord was achieved. In 1859, the venerable and beloved Secretary of the Tattwabodhini Sabha Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar resigned from the Brahmo Sabha in the face of Debendranath's vacillation. A meeting of the Tatwabodhini was promptly summoned with Debendranath resigning from the group he had founded. His third son Hemendranath Tagore then a boy barely 15 years in age, and the favorite pupil of Vidyasgar, was commonly acclaimed as Debendranath's successor to head the Tattwabodhini. In the course of time he would become known as the \"MahaAcharya\" (or \"Great Teacher\").\n\nDisgusted by politics within the Tagore family and the support to K.C.Sen's faction by his own brother Satyendranath Tagore, Hemendranath took the bold decisions to expand his Sabha out from Calcutta. His close associate Pandit Nobin Chandra Roy who had joined the new institution of \"Railways\" in 1860 as its \"Paymaster\" for Upper India was tasked to spread Brahmoism there. With a predominantly monotheistic populace following Islam and Sikhism it was perceived as fertile soil for Rammohun's message. The Tattwabodhini decreed that the uncorrupted faith of the original 1830 Trust Deed would be known there as the Adi Dharm to distinguish it from the distorted versions of the squabbling factions of Calcutta. The steps taken by Hemendranath Tagore, with the blessing of his father, was to institute in 1860 a suit before the Supreme Court to restore the title \"Brahmo Samaj\" to his faction. After losing in this suit in 1861, Keshub Sen's faction altered the name of their Samaj from \"The Brahmo Samaj of India\" to \"Navabidhan (or the New Dispensation)\". With victory in this suit and the promulgation of his \"Brahmo Anusthan\" (Code of Brahmaic doctrine and practice) in 1861, Hemendranath's Samaj-ists are henceforth known as the \"Anusthanic\" Brahmos (or Brahmos who follow the Code). The other factions were designated as \"\"An\"anusthanic\" Brahmos (or those who do not follow the Code) (this distinction was again to be legally examined before the Privy Council of Great Britain in 1901 and in 1902 the Privy Council upheld the 1897 finding of the Chief Court of the Punjab that the Adi Dharm (\"anusthanic\" Brahmos) were definitely not Hindus whereas the \"Ananusthanics\" Brahmos of Calcutta fall within Hinduism).\n\nThe main objective of the Sabhā was to promote a more rational and humanist form of Hinduism based on the Vedānta, the Upanishads that form the last part of the Vedās. With increasing missionary presence in Calcutta tending to view the Classical branch of 'Avaida' Vedānta as amoral and renunciatory, the Tattwabodhinī Sabhā aimed to shield themselves and their reformed faith from criticism by distancing themselves from this 'outdated' version.\n\nDebendranath Tagore said in 1843 that \"It was to counteract influences like these [missionary] and inculcate on the Hindu religious inquirer's mind doctrines at once consonant to reason and human nature, for which he has to explore his own sacred resources, the Vedānta, that the society was originally established\". This focus on rationality and humanity, whilst alleviating Missionary pressure, also allowed the materially wealthy 'bhadralok' members of the society to participate in a spiritual medium which did not condemn worldly concern. The group's writings, particularly the recently rediscovered 'Sabhyadiger Vaktṛtā', display a marked stress upon the role of the 'householder' (\"gṛhastha\") as a religious path, over that of the renouncer or hermit. The Brahman, like the renouncer, must restrain his senses and passions, but only to the extent of not becoming obsessed with, or overcome by, anything in the material world.\n\nEssentially, the Tattwabodhinī Sabhā's humanism is displayed in a profound focus on society and its interrelation. Their view, at least in the early years, was that the world is created by God, and all things within it are pathways to knowledge of Brahman, the Ultimate Self, and the ultimate goal. Similarly, they saw that material wealth, if made and possessed with the correct \"intention\" - that of helping society and others – was in fact not only ethically sound, but an utter necessity for harmonious society. Once again, their rationality is evident.\n\n"}
{"id": "83133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=83133", "title": "Thyrsus", "text": "Thyrsus\n\nA thyrsus or thyrsos () was a wand or staff of giant fennel (\"Ferula communis\") covered with ivy vines and leaves, sometimes wound with taeniae and topped with a pine cone or by a bunch of vine-leaves and grapes or ivy-leaves and berries.\n\nThe thyrsus, associated with Dionysus (or Bacchus) and his followers, the Satyrs and Maenads, is a symbol of prosperity, fertility, hedonism, and pleasure/enjoyment in general. It has been suggested that this was specifically a fertility phallus, with the fennel representing the shaft of the penis and the pine cone representing the \"seed\" issuing forth. The thyrsus was tossed in the Bacchic dance:\n\"Pentheus\": The thyrsus— in my right hand shall I hold it?\n\"Dionysus\": In thy right hand, and with thy right foot raise it\".\nSometimes the thyrsus was displayed in conjunction with a kantharos wine cup, another symbol of Dionysus, forming a male-and-female combination like that of the royal scepter and orb.\n\nIn Greek religion, the staff was carried by the votaries of Dionysus. Euripides wrote that honey dripped from the thyrsos staves that the Bacchic maenads carried. The thyrsus was a sacred instrument at religious rituals and fêtes.\n\nThe fabulous history of Bacchus relates that he converted the thyrsi carried by himself and his followers into dangerous weapons, by concealing an iron point in the head of leaves. Hence his thyrsus is called \"a spear enveloped in vine-leaves\", and its point was thought to incite to madness.\n\nIn the \"Iliad\", Diomedes, one of the leading warriors of the Achaeans, mentions the thyrsus while speaking to Glaucus, one of the Lycian commanders in the Trojan army, about Lycurgus, the king of Scyros:\n\nHe it was that/drove the nursing women who were in charge/of frenzied Bacchus through the land of Nysa,/and they flung their thyrsi on the ground as/murderous Lycurgus beat them with his ox-/goad. (\"Iliad\", Book VI.132-37)\nThe thyrsus is explicitly attributed to Dionysus in Euripides's play \"The Bacchae\" as part of the costume of the Dionysian cult. ...To raise my Bacchic shout, and clothe all who respond/ In fawnskin habits, and put my thyrsus in their hands–/ The weapon wreathed with ivy-shoots...\" Euripides also writes, \"There's a brute wildness in the fennel-wands—Reverence it well.\" (\"The Bacchae and Other Plays\", trans. by Philip Vellacott, Penguin, 1954.)\n\nPlato writes in \"Phaedo\":\n\nI conceive that the founders of the mysteries had a real meaning and were not mere triflers when they intimated in a figure long ago that he who passes unsanctified and uninitiated into the world below will live in a slough, but that he who arrives there after initiation and purification will dwell with the gods. For \"many,\" as they say in the mysteries, \"are the thyrsus bearers, but few are the mystics,\"--meaning, as I interpret the words, the true philosophers.\nIn Part II of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's \"Faust\", Mephistopheles tries to catch a Lamia, only to find out that she is an illusion:\n\nWell, then, a tall one I will catch.../And now a thyrsus-pole I snatch!/Only a pine-cone as its head. (7775-7777)\nRobert Browning mentions the thyrsus in passing in \"The Bishop Orders His Tomb at St Praxed's Church\", as the dying bishop confuses Christian piety with classical extravagance.\n\nOvid talks about Bacchus carrying a thyrsus and his followers doing the same in his Metamorphoses Book III, which is a retelling of The Bacchae.\nThe bas-relief in bronze ye promised me,/Those Pans and nymphs ye wot of, and perchance/Some tripod, thrysus, with a vase or so, (56-58)\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17382595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17382595", "title": "Yogmaya Neupane", "text": "Yogmaya Neupane\n\nYogmaya Neupane \"(Nepali: योगमाया न्यौपाने)\" (1860–1941) was a religious leader, women's rights activist and poet based in Bhojpur district of Nepal. Yogmaya is considered to be among the pioneer female poets in Nepal with her only published book of poems, the Sarwartha Yogbani (\"In Nepali: सर्वार्थ योगवाणी\") considered to be her most notable contribution.\n\nYogmaya’s poems are set around the time when Nepal was ruled by the Rana regime and when India was ruled under the British raj. Her style, characterized by the cultural and political oppression of the time was distinctly original and courageously outspoken. Despite putting a significant focus on the Hindu religious context as a religious leader, her poems and activism themes heavily revolved on female and minority rights in the region, which appealed to a lot of people around the time. In her later years, her activities were heavily monitored by the government and her works were banned by the authorities under the command of the Rana rulers and despite the persecution of her group, she is notable for opting to remain in Nepal and spending her last days around her birthplace in Eastern Nepal. It is also regarded that Yogmaya founded the first organization of Nepali women, the Nari Samiti for women's rights in 1918, which was considered to be the main lobby behind the abolition of the Sati Pratha in Nepal in 1920.\n\nYogmaya's activism begun after she declared renunciation and returned to Nepal. With the authorities increasingly harsh towards Yogmaya and her group of supporters, as well as, unwilling to reform their brutal and corrupt approach to governance, Yogmaya and her 67 disciples consciously committed the biggest mass suicide (Jal-Samadhi) in Nepali history by jumping into the Arun River in 1941. In January 2016, the Nepal Government issued a postage stamp recognizing her contributions.\n\nYogmaya was born into a Brahmin family in Majhuwabeshi, Nepaledada VDC at 1860. She was born as the eldest child and the only daughter from her parents, father Shrilal Upadhyaya Neupane and mother Chandrakala Neupane, among three children.\n\nAccording to the prevalent Brahmin customs of the period, Yogmaya was married off by her parents to a boy named Manorath Koirala, when she was just 7 years old. But, she later became a widow within 3 years of her marriage. As widows were granted immensely low status in the Hindu society during the time, Yogmaya faced several difficulties from her in-laws and the society which ultimately compelled her to return to her maternal home in her teenage years. However, there too, Yogmaya faced discrimination because of her widowed status.\n\nIn her mid-teen years, despite being a widow in the highly conservative and repressive Brahmin society of the time, Yogmaya secretly developed a relationship with a neighborhood Brahmin boy with the surname Kandel (name unidentified). As widow marriage wasn't regarded positively in the Hindu society, Yogmaya decided to flee from her home at Bhojpur and she later married her lover at Assam. After over a decade of marriage, her second husband died and she became a widow again. Later, Yogmaya married a man in Assam with the surname Dotel, who also died after a few years. Historians have disputed about whether Yogmaya gave birth to two daughters or only one in her three marriages, but the existence of Nainakala Neupane as her daughter has been recorded.\n\nAfter deciding that she had enough of marriages and the worldly ways, Yogmaya decided to adopt a life of renunciation and live the rest of her life as an ascetic. While it was fairly common for males to become ascetics in the Hindu society during the time, it was very rare for females being so. Yogmaya then returned to Nepal with her daughter Nainakala to her home village at Majhuwabesi and handed over daughter Nainakala to her brother Agnidhar Neupane and sister-in-law Ganga. She hence gave up all her responsibilities and fully assumed the life of an ascetic. It was during this period that Yogmaya began composing her religious poems. Analysis of her earlier themes has pointed out scholars to assume that Yogmaya was heavily influenced by the principles of reformist Hindu leader Dayananda Saraswati, who had gained immense popularity across India when Yogmaya resided in Assam.\n\nYogmaya later commenced her ascetic journey across different parts of Nepal. During her journey she came in contact with many renowned religious leaders, including Swargadwari Mahaprabhu Abhayananda Second, who was highly appreciative of her devotion and thus guided her with the Yogic spiritual education under the . After her journey, Yogmaya decided to vigorously practice her meditative Sadhana by returning to her home village.\n\nYogmaya practiced some extremely difficult meditation techniques during her Sadhana, including meditating near fire during summers and then without thickly covered clothes inside cold caves during the Himalayan winter. Sometimes she would even meditate while fasting and only drinking water for several weeks. At other times, she would meet with people and her relatives to whom she would recite her poems. Unlike anything the people in Majhuwabesi had ever heard or known, her poems influenced many locals and her following steadily began to grow. One of her disciples, Chandra Bahadur Basnet later constructed a hut for Yogmaya and also compiled her poems and later published them from Sikkim.\n\nThe tragedies and discrimination faced by Yogmaya in her pre-ascetic life heavily defined her outlook on the injustices present in the Nepali Hindu society. Despite being a follower and preacher of Hindu spirituality, she felt that the patriarchal society around the time was unfairly discriminatory towards women, lower caste groups and in the case of Nepal, towards the lower economic class as well. Her poems attempted to make the masses around Bhojpur aware of such underlying discrimination, which resonated with large number of locals. Following the publication of her poems, people from as far away as Darjeeling and Kathmandu began to become her disciples.\n\nAlthough Yogmaya's teachings easily influenced many underprivileged and politically isolated masses, many local feudalistic landlords belonging to the Basnet lineage, as well as, local people close to the central administrators in Kathmandu considered the ascetic and her followers a threat to their patriarchal privileges and vehemently started opposing her. Ultimately her activism and popularity gained the attention of the administrators of the brutal Rana Regime as well.\n\nYogmaya believed that the administration had become extremely corrupt and had added to the misery of the common people by not adhering to the Dharma, despite propagating to the public that they adhered to the Hindu religious code. She also openly criticized the bureaucrats who were thriving from bribery and denying people even the basic rights through her poems. With a view to promote and preach her ideas as well convince the administrators in Kathmandu to change their discriminatory and corrupt policies Yogmaya sent one of her disciples Premnarayan Bhandari to Kathmandu in 1931, who later began to be known popularly by the masses in Kathmandu as Hareram Prabhu. The then Prime Minister of Nepal, Juddha Shumsher Rana also decided to meet Bhandari following which he gave a spoken assurance to adhere to the holy vow of truth and sent him to give the message to Yogmaya. However, the administrators didn't reform any of their brutal and corrupt techniques in the next four years. Dejected by the attitude of the rulers in Kathmandu, Yogmaya once again sent Bhandari to Kathmandu in 1936 and then later that year the leader herself came to Kathmandu with her daughter. She was welcomed by Juddha Shumsher during her visit her where he reportedly asked what she wanted and in response Yogmaya replied 'the alms of the holy order of truth and justice' (in Nepali: सत्य धर्मको भिक्षा). The prime minister gave her his assurance again, but didn't implement any concrete reform as her group had expected. Then, before leaving the Kathmandu Valley, Yogmaya handed a 24-point appeal to the prime minister detailing the reforms she and her followers wanted to see in the country. This alarmed Juddha Shumsher and his followers, who began seeing Yogmaya as a threat to their political establishment and so made special preparations to send her back to Bhojpur that year.\n\nDissent against Rana Regime had begun to increase in the late 1930s, primarily influenced by the Freedom Movement in India. As a response, the then government resorted to using more brutal techniques against dissidents. The reforms demanded by Yogmaya and her followers were repeatedly ignored by the state and the activities of her group was consistently being monitored. In 1935, Yogmaya began vocally opposing the corrupt and brutal administration. She declared that it was time to establish a new era by destroying the injustices, superstitions and corrupt practices that had taken hold of the Nepali society. She further declared that she didn't wish to be entangled in the changing era as she was already nearing salvation and she thus was soon willfully going to sacrifice herself in the name of god.\n\nIn the pretext of Juddha Shumser not fulfilling his assurances, Yogmaya made a plan to sacrifice herself by sitting on a giant pyre along with 240 willful disciples in a ritual called the Agni Samadhi and thus commanded her followers to post a public appeal to the common people for any kind of alms they could give to her group by the Kartik Shukla Purnima. She also sent personal appeals for alms to Madhav Shumsher, the then head administrator of Dhankuta district and Juddha Shumser.\n\nWith the administrators not paying heed to her appeal yet again, Yogmaya set the date for her sacrifice to November 12, 1938 and publicly began making preparations for the same.\n\nFearing a mass rebuttal if the mass sacrifice was allowed to happen, Juddha Shumser ordered the disruption of the event by deploying around 500 security personnel to the event venue on November 11, following which 11 male disciples were jailed at Dhankuta while most female participants of the disrupted agni samadhi ritual, including Yogmaya and Nainakala were kept in close arrest in the Radhakrishna Temple at Bhojpur. The administrators released the female members from detention after three months, while most of the male followers were released from jail three years later on April, 1941.\n\nAfter the release of all her disciples Yogmaya decided to continue with her self-sacrificing plans, but this time she ordered to keep the plans an in-group secret. She set the new date of the event to July 5, 1941, which was the day of the holy Harisayani Ekadasi and personally allowed only a select group of disciples to join in with her. The religious ritual for the Jal Samadhi began on the night of July 4, 1941 and in the morning of July 5 at around 4AM, Yogmaya led the ritualistic mass suicide by climbing on a rock placing a plate with firelit oil lamps on her head at the banks of the raging Arun River. After Yogmaya, 65 of her disciples then jumped on the river in succession on that day and the next day 2 more of her disciples followed suit. Ultimately, the total death count from the event stood at 68.\n\nYogmaya and her daughter Nainakala were illiterate. Her poems were compiled and published by her literate disciples. In fact, the Yogbani is considered to be a small part of her poem collections, which she continued to compose until the year of her Jal Samadhi.\n\nNews and materials on Yogmaya and the mass suicide were aggressively censored by the Rana Regime until they were overthrown in 1951. However, even during the first multi-party democracy era (1951-1960) and the Panchayat Era (1960-1990), mention about Yogmaya's activities were generally discouraged by the state. Yet, her disciples, who were spread around Bhojpur, Khotang and Sankhuwasabha continued the tradition locally through the 1990s. Some of Yogmaya's disciples, mostly female, also lived in the Manakamana Temple in Tumlingtar.\n\nAfter travel restrictions for foreign visitors to Nepal were gradually lifted around the Panchayat Era, scholars from outside Nepal also began pursuing Yogmaya. After the 1980s, notable Western scholars, including Barbara Nimri Aziz and Michael Hutt researched and published their literary works based on Yogmaya.\n\nTopics on Yogmaya have been also included in the curriculum in specific Social Science based disciplines in different universities in Nepal including Sociology, Anthropology and Women's Studies.\n\nA local organization has also been formed in Bhojpur by relatives and locals of Yogmaya Neupane called the ‘Yogamaya Shakti Pith Tapobhumi Bikash Tatha Vikas Sanstha’, to promote her work and activities as well as preserve the places where Yogmaya spent a significant time during her ascetic life around Nepaledada and Dingla.\n\nOn November 16, 2016, the Nepal Government issued a postal stamp in recognition of her contributions to the history of Nepal.\n\n"}

Because someone from her family, probably her father, was accused of crimes, she was forced to be a servant and assigned to the palace of Yuwen Yun, who was then crown prince under his father Emperor Wu. She was in charge of the clothes of Yuwen Yun, 12 years younger than her. On one occasion, he summoned her to have sexual relations with him; in summer 573, she gave birth to his first son, Yuwen Yan (宇文衍), whose name was later changed to Yuwen Chan.\n\nIn 578 Emperor Wu died, and Yuwen Yun took the throne as Emperor Xuan. He created Yuwen Chan crown prince, and after Emperor Xuan passed the throne to Yuwen Chan and became retired emperor in spring 579 (with the atypical title of \"Emperor Tianyuan\" (天元皇帝, \"Tianyuan Huangdi\"), he, in another unusual move, decided to create three (and later one more) additional empresses in addition to his wife, Yang Lihua, and Consort Zhu, on account of her being the mother of Emperor Jing, received the title of Empress Tianyuan (\"Tianyuan Di Hou\", 天元帝后, a slightly less honored title than Empress Yang's \"Tianyuan Huanghou\" (天元皇后)), later changed to \"Tian Huanghou\" (天皇后), and then further changed in 580 to \"Tian Da Huanghou\" (天大皇后). It was said that she was not favored by him on account of her being much older and also of lowly birth.\n\nEmperor Xuan died in 580, and Empress Yang's father Yang Jian became regent. Three of Emperor Xuan's empresses, other than Empresses Yang and Zhu, became Buddhist nuns, but Empress Zhu did not at this point, and was honored as empress dowager (along with Empress Yang) but with the secondary title of \"Di Taihou\" (帝太后), lower than Empress Dowager Yang's title of \"Huang Taihou\" (皇太后). In 581, Yang Jian seized the throne from Emperor Jing, ending Northern Zhou and establishing the Sui dynasty. Emperor Jing and other members of the imperial Yuwen clan were soon slaughtered. Empress Dowager Zhu became a Buddhist nun and took the name Fajing. She died in 586 and was buried only with ceremonies due a Buddhist nun, west of the capital Chang'an.\n"}
