The Bahá'í community says the review is needed to protect the teachings of the Bahá'í Faith in its infancy when inaccurate statements could cause harm, especially given the current persecution of Bahá'ís in Iran and other parts of the world. Some characterize this requirement as a form of censorship, since there are penalties for non-compliance.\n\nBahá'u'lláh wrote that Bahá'í authors should write in a manner as to attract souls:\n\nThe origin of the requirement for review comes from `Abdu'l-Bahá.\n\nShoghi Effendi, with the above statement in mind, stated that due to the infancy of the Bahá'í Faith, the accuracy of information presented about it needed to be verified since an inaccurate statement could cause much harm to it. Shoghi Effendi wrote:\n\nThe purpose of the review is threefold:\n\nThe review committee is recommended to be small, composed of two or three believers which have an adequate education and knowledge of the Bahá'í Faith; and they need to deal with submitted works in a prompt manner. Their purpose is to uphold the following standards for the publication:\n\nThe review committee does not evaluate the literary merit of the work which is the prerogative of the publisher.\n\nSome people have suggested that since accurate information on the faith is now widely available, the policy should be discontinued. An example would be Juan Cole, who writes:\n\nBahá'ís would note that Juan Cole is not a disinterested observer, as he states in his paper, as he had withdrawn from membership in the Bahá'í Faith as a result of an investigation into his email postings on a variety of controversial issues.\n\nIn regards to the process of review, the Bahá'í institutions have signalled their intention to continue the requirement into the indefinite future; they state that even though the Bahá'í Faith is no longer an obscure religion, the large majority of people do not know of its existence, and that most of its adherents are relatively new Bahá'ís. Because of these two things, and that the Bahá'í Faith can no longer be protected by obscurity, it becomes more important to follow the guidance of `Abdu'l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi to present a correct view when more people will first hear about it:\n\n\n"}

Some important Baptist figures in the struggle were John Smyth, Thomas Helwys, Edward Wightman, Leonard Busher, Roger Williams (who was a Baptist for a short period but became a \"Seeker\"), John Clarke, Isaac Backus, and John Leland.\n\nIn 1612 John Smyth wrote, \"the magistrate is not by virtue of his office to meddle with religion, or matters of conscience\". That same year, Thomas Helwys wrote that the King of England could \"command what of man he will, and we are to obey it,\" but, concerning the church—\"with this Kingdom, our lord the King hath nothing to do.\" In 1614, Leonard Busher wrote what is believed to be the earliest Baptist treatise dealing exclusively with the subject of religious liberty.\n\nThe Danbury Baptist Association of Danbury, Connecticut sent a letter, dated October 7, 1801, to the newly elected President Thomas Jefferson, expressing concern over the lack in their state constitution of explicit protection of religious liberty, and against a government establishment of religion.\n\nIn their letter to the President, the Danbury Baptists affirmed that \"Our Sentiments are uniformly on the side of Religious Liberty\":\nAs a religious minority in Connecticut, the Danbury Baptists were concerned that a religious majority might \"reproach their chief Magistrate... because he will not, dare not assume the prerogatives of Jehovah and make Laws to govern the Kingdom of Christ,\" thus establishing a state religion at the cost of the liberties of religious minorities.\n\nThomas Jefferson's response, dated January 1, 1802, concurs with the Danbury Baptists' views on religious liberty, and the accompanying separation of civil government from concerns of religious doctrine and practice.\n\nThis doctrine, known as the \"wall of separation\" or \"strict separationism,\" would later become highly influential in 20th century Supreme Court understandings of the relationship between church and state. The phrase \"separation of church and state\" does not appear in the United States Constitution, despite its wide use and origin from a founding father. The relevance of this reply is a subject of heated debate, with scholars such as Robert Boston emphasizing its importance, and others such as Mark David Hall arguing that the letter was a historical outlier.\n\nIn the U.S. today, a group of Baptists believe the United States was formed as a Christian nation by the Founding Fathers. There is neither a unifying nor a codified doctrinal position among American Baptists. Interpretations of the meaning of \"separation of church and state\" vary among different Baptist affiliations.\n\nHowever, many Baptists in the United States still believe in the wall of separation and support maintaining it. For example, fifteen Baptist organizations, representing collectively over 10 million Baptists in America, collaborate with one another to protect religious liberty and the separation of church and state through their funding of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty. Freedom of conscience is a historic Baptist distinctive, and many Baptists continue to believe the best course for obtaining and securing freedom of conscience is through the separation of church and state.\n"}

{"id": "4423687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4423687", "title": "Bhog", "text": "Bhog\n\nBhog (n. 'pleasure' or 'delight', v. 'to end' or 'to conclude') is a term used in Hinduism and Sikhism. In Sikhism, it is used for observances that are fulfilled along with the reading of the concluding part of the Guru Granth Sahib. It can be performed in conjunction with weddings, obsequies, anniversaries, funeral services and other occasions when a family or a worshipping community may consider such a reading appropriate.\n\nBhog in the Hindu religion is food given to the Gods.\n\nThe term Bhog is used in the Sikh religion for observances that are fulfilled along with the reading of the concluding part of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji. The reading of this holy scripture is done on a day-to-day basis with a staff of readers at a major worship centre. The community generally relates 'Bhog' to an uninterrupted and complete reading of their holy book (Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji). This usually takes days to complete through a relay of readers who work round-the-clock. This is also called the Akhand Path. This type of path and hence the 'Bhog' as it comes to its end, can be performed in conjunction with weddings, obsequies, anniversaries and other occasions, when a family or a worship community might consider such reading to be appropriate.\n\nBhog also takes place when a family or a community decides to go for a slower reading of the holy scripture (Sahaj Path). The reading is done as and when circumstances permit. The 'Bhog' comes at its end and has to be recited in a single session, without a break. Another variation is the Saptahik Path, in which the reading of the scripture has to be completed within a week. The Sahaj Path may continue for months.\n\n'Bhog' is a derivative from the Sanskrit word \"Bhoga\" and as a verb it means 'to end' or 'to conclude'. It is generally used to denote a funeral service. The Karah Prasad that is distributed at the end of any congregational service might also be termed 'Bhog'. An occasion of joy or sorrow, prompt a Sikh householder to follow the path of the Holy Book, preferred by himself or his family. If this is not possible, then Pathis or scripture-readers are invited for this purpose. The assignation of the time period is often announced at a local Gurudwara during the Sangat. Notices might be placed in the newspapers.\n\nIn the case of Saptahik Paths, the reader reads the entire Holy Book except for the last five pages. This is when the Karah Prasad is prepared. The unread portion is continued after the 'inaugural hymns'. The Pathi would start slowly and would read Guru Teg Bahadur's 57 couplets, \"Mundavani\" and a \"Sloka\" (or a hymn) by Guru Arjan. The Ragamala follows this.\n\nThe \"Mundavani\" is an essential part and is like a seal to the scripture. It reiterates the essentials of the teachings of the book - \"Sat(ya)\" (the truth), \"santokh\" (contentment), \"vichar\" (wisdom) and the remembrance to the Holy name (Nam).\n\nThe Ardas is read after the reading is completed. Ardas has its own powerful associations brought into bhog. These include recalling the glorious past of the Sikhs: their heroism, devotion, martyrdom and marking the present Khalsa.\n\nAfter the Ardas, the Hukam or command for the day is obtained by reading out the hymn offered by the text which is naturally interpreted in the context of the intention of the path, that is, as the word of the Guru to those receiving it at that point, with their purposes particularly in mind, be it a family event, a funeral, a wedding, or invocation for blessing on a new venture.\n\nIn West Bengal and neighboring regions, Bhog is commonly distributed in major festivals like the Durga Puja, Kali Puja, Saraswati Puja and other community poojas. It is commonly served in large temple complexes. The bhog is a blessed food that doubles up as a complete meal as opposed to prasad, which in West Bengal, would be in smaller quantity and would not be intended to be a meal. A most common form of bhog is in the form of Khichdi, served with a semi dry vegetable preparation, sweet tomato chutney and payesh (kheer), which is a rice pudding. This is typically served on flat plates of leaves of Sal (tree) joined together with small twigs, all of which are then discarded.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1491156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1491156", "title": "Chinese folk religion", "text": "Chinese folk religion\n\nChinese folk religion (Chinese popular religion) or Han folk religion is the religious tradition of the Han Chinese, including veneration of forces of nature and ancestors, exorcism of harmful forces, and a belief in the rational order of nature which can be influenced by human beings and their rulers as well as spirits and gods. Worship is devoted to a multiplicity of gods and immortals (神 \"shén\"), who can be deities of phenomena, of human behaviour, or progenitors of lineages. Stories regarding some of these gods are collected into the body of Chinese mythology. By the 11th century (Song period), these practices had been blended with Buddhist ideas of karma (one's own doing) and rebirth, and Taoist teachings about hierarchies of gods, to form the popular religious system which has lasted in many ways until the present day.\n\nChinese religions have a variety of sources, local forms, founder backgrounds, and ritual and philosophical traditions. Despite this diversity, there is a common core that can be summarised as four theological, cosmological, and moral concepts: \"Tian\" (), Heaven, the transcendent source of moral meaning; \"qi\" (), the breath or energy that animates the universe; \"jingzu\" (), the veneration of ancestors; and \"bao ying\" (), moral reciprocity; together with two traditional concepts of fate and meaning: \"ming yun\" (), the personal destiny or burgeoning; and \"yuan fen\" (), \"fateful coincidence\", good and bad chances and potential relationships. \n\nYin and yang () is the polarity that describes the order of the universe, held in balance by the interaction of principles of growth (\"shen\") and principles of waning (\"gui\"), with \"yang\" (\"act\") usually preferred over \"yin\" (\"receptiveness\") in common religion. \"Ling\" (), \"numen\" or \"sacred\", is the \"medium\" of the two states and the inchoate order of creation.\n\nBoth the present day government of China and the imperial dynasties of the Ming and Qing tolerated village popular religious cults if they bolstered social stability but suppressed or persecuted those that they feared would undermine it. After the fall of the empire in 1911, governments and elites opposed or attempted to eradicate folk religion in order to promote \"modern\" values, and many condemned \"feudal superstition\". These conceptions of folk religion began to change in Taiwan in the late 20th century and in mainland China in the 21st. Many scholars now view folk religion in a positive light. In recent times Chinese folk religions are experiencing a revival in both mainland China and Taiwan. Some forms have received official understanding or recognition as a preservation of traditional Chinese culture, such as Mazuism and the Sanyi teaching in Fujian, Huangdi worship, and other forms of local worship, for example the Longwang, Pangu or Caishen worship.\n\nChinese \"popular religion\" or \"folk religion\" or \"folk belief\" have long been used to indicate the local and communal religious life and complexities of Han local indigenous cults of China in English-language academic literature, though the Chinese language historically has not had a concept or overarching name for this. In Chinese academic literature and common usage \"folk religion\" (民間宗教 \"mínjiān zōngjiào\") refers to specific organised folk religious sects. \"Folk beliefs\" (民間信仰 \"mínjiān xìnyǎng\") is a technical term with little usage outside the academia, in which it entered into usage at first among Taiwanese scholars from Japanese language during Japan's occupation (1895–1945), and later between the 1990s and the early 21st century among mainland Chinese scholars.\n\nWith the rise of the study of traditional cults and the creation of a government agency to give legal status to this religion, intellectuals and philosophers in China have proposed the adoption of a formal name in order to solve the terminological problems of confusion with folk religious sects and conceptualise a definite field for research and administration. The terms that have been proposed include \"Chinese native religion\" or \"Chinese indigenous religion\" (民俗宗教 \"mínsú zōngjiào\"), \"Chinese ethnic religion\" (民族宗教 \"mínzú zōngjiào\"), or also simply \"Chinese religion\" (中華教 \"Zhōnghuájiào\") viewed as comparable to the usage of the term \"Hinduism\" for Indian religion, and \"Shenxianism\" (神仙教 \"Shénxiānjiào\", \"religion of deities and immortals\"), partly inspired by the term \"Shenism\" (神教 \"Shénjiào\") that was used in the 1950s by the anthropologist Allan J. A. Elliott. The Qing dynasty scholars Yao Wendong and Chen Jialin used the term \"shenjiao\" not referring to Shinto as a definite religious system, but to local \"shin\" beliefs in Japan. Other definitions that have been used are \"folk cults\" (民間崇拜 \"mínjiān chóngbài\"),\"spontaneous religion\" (自發宗教 \"zìfā zōngjiào\"), \"lived (or living) religion\" (生活宗教 \"shēnghuó zōngjiào\"), \"local religion\" (地方宗教 \"dìfāng zōngjiào\"), and \"diffused religion\" (分散性宗教 \"fēnsàn xìng zōngjiào\").\n\n\"Shendao\" (神道 \"Shéndào\", the \"Way of the Gods\") is a term already used in the \"Yijing\" referring to the divine order of nature. Around the time of the spread of Buddhism in the Han period (206 BCE–220 CE), it was used to distinguish the indigenous religion from the imported religion. Ge Hong used it in his \"Baopuzi\" as a synonym for Taoism. The term was subsequently adopted in Japan in the 6th century as \"Shindo\", later \"Shinto\", with the same purpose of identification of the Japanese indigenous religion. In the 14th century, the Hongwu Emperor (Taizu of the Ming dynasty, 1328–1398) used the term \"Shendao\" clearly identifying the indigenous cults, which he strengthened and systematised.\n\n\"Chinese Universism\", not in the sense of \"universalism\", that is a system of universal application, that is Tian in Chinese thought, is a coinage of Jan Jakob Maria de Groot that refers to the metaphysical perspective that lies behind the Chinese religious tradition. De Groot calls Chinese Universism \"the ancient metaphysical view that serves as the basis of all classical Chinese thought. ... In Universism, the three components of integrated universe—understood epistemologically, \"heaven, earth and man\", and understood ontologically, \"Taiji (the great beginning, the highest ultimate), yin and yang\"—are formed\".\n\nContemporary Chinese scholars have identified what they find to be the essential features of the folk (or indigenous—ethnic) religion of China. According to Chen Xiaoyi 陳曉毅 local indigenous religion is the crucial factor for a harmonious \"religious ecology\" (宗教生態), that is the balance of forces in a given community. Professor Han Bingfang 韓秉芳 has called for a rectification of distorted names (正名). Distorted names are \"superstitious activities\" (迷信活動) or \"feudal superstition\" (封建迷信), that were derogatorily applied to the indigenous religion by leftist policies. Christian missionaries also used the label \"feudal superstition\" in order to undermine their religious competitor. Han calls for the acknowledgment of folk religion for what it really is, the \"core and soul of popular culture\" (俗文化的核心與靈魂).\n\nAccording to Chen Jinguo 陳進國, folk religion is a core element of Chinese cultural and religious self-awareness (文化自覺, 信仰自覺). He has proposed a theoretical definition of Chinese indigenous religion in \"three inseparable attributes\" (三位一體), apparently inspired to Tang Junyi's thought:\n\nChinese religious practices are diverse, varying from province to province and even from one village to another, for religious behaviour is bound to local communities, kinship, and environments. In each setting, institution and ritual behaviour assumes highly organised forms. Temples and the gods in them acquire symbolic character and perform specific functions involved in the everyday life of the local community. Local religion preserves aspects of natural beliefs such as totemism, animism and shamanism.\n\nChinese folk religion pervades all aspects of social life. Many scholars, following the lead of sociologist C. K. Yang, see Chinese religion deeply embedded in family and civic life, rather than expressed in a separate organisational structure like a \"church,\" as in the West.\n\nDeity or temple associations and lineage associations, pilgrimage associations and formalised prayers, rituals and expressions of virtues, are the common forms of organisation of Chinese religion on the local level. Neither initiation rituals nor official membership into a church organisation separate from one person's native identity are mandatory in order to be involved in religious activities. Contrary to institutional religions, Chinese religion does not require \"conversion\" for participation.\n\nThe prime criterion for participation in Chinese folk religion is not \"to believe\" in an official doctrine or dogma, but \"to belong\" to the local unit of Chinese religion, that is the \"association\", the \"village\" or the \"kinship\", with their gods and rituals. Scholar Richard Madsen describes Chinese religion, adopting the definition of Tu Weiming, as characterised by \"immanent transcendence\" grounded in a devotion to \"concrete humanity\", focused on building moral community within concrete humanity.\n\nInextricably linked to the aforementioned question to find an appropriate \"name\" for Chinese religion, is the difficulty to define it or clearly outline its boundaries. Old sinology, especially Western, tried to distinguish \"popular\" and \"élite\" traditions (the latter being Confucianism and Taoism conceived as independent systems). Chinese sinology later adopted another dichotomy which continues in contemporary studies, distinguishing \"folk beliefs\" (\"minjian xinyang\") and \"folk religion\" (\"minjian zongjiao\"), the latter referring to the doctrinal sects.\n\nMany studies have pointed out that it is impossible to draw clear distinctions, and since the 1970s several sinologists swung to the idea of a unified \"Chinese religion\" that would define the Chinese national identity, similarly to Hinduism for India and Shinto for Japan. Other sinologists who have not espoused the idea of a unified \"national religion\" have studied Chinese religion as a system of meaning, or have brought further development in C. K. Yang's distinction between \"institutional religion\" and \"diffused religion\", the former functioning as a separate body from other social institutions, and the latter intimately part of secular social institutions.\n\nBy the Han dynasty, Chinese religion mostly consisted of people organising into \"shè\" 社 (\"group\", \"body\", local community altars) who worshipped their godly principle. In many cases the \"lord of the \"she\"\" was the god of the earth, and in others a deified virtuous person (\"xiān\" 仙, \"immortal\"). Some cults such as that of Liu Zhang, a king in what is today Shandong, date back to this period.\n\nFrom the 3rd century on by the Northern Wei, accompanying the spread of Buddhism in China, strong influences from the Indian subcontinent penetrated the Chinese indigenous religion. A cult of Ganesha (象頭神 \"Xiàngtóushén\", \"Elephant-Head God\") is attested in the year 531. Pollination from Indian religions included processions of carts with images of gods or floats borne on shoulders, with musicians and chanting.\n\nThe Chinese folk religion was subject to persecution in the 19th and 20th centuries. Many local temples were destroyed during the Taiping Rebellion and the Boxer Rebellion in the late 1800s. After the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 \"most temples were turned to other uses or were destroyed, with a few changed into schools\". During the Japanese invasion of China between 1937 and 1945 many temples were used as barracks by soldiers and destroyed in warfare.\n\nIn the past, popular cults were regulated by imperial government policies, promoting certain deities while suppressing other ones. In the 20th century, with the decline of the empire, increasing urbanisation and Western influence, the issue for the new intellectual class was no longer controlling unauthorised worship of unregistered gods, but became the delegitimisation of folk religion as a superstitious obstacle to modernisation.\n\nIn 1904 a government regulation of the late empire approved for schools to be built through the confiscation of temple property. Various \"anti-superstition\" campaigns followed. The Guomindang government of the early republic intensified the suppression of local religion with the 1928 \"Standards for retaining or abolishing gods and shrines\"; the policy abolished all cults of gods with the exception of human heroes such as Yu the Great, Guan Yu and Confucius.\n\nThese policies were the background of those that were implemented in communist China after 1949. The Cultural Revolution between 1966 and 1976 of the Maoist period was the last systematic effort to destroy the folk religion.\n\nAfter 1978 Chinese folk religion started to rapidly revive in China, with millions of temples being rebuilt or built from scratch. Since the 1980s the central government moved to a policy of benign neglect or \"wu wei\" () in regard to rural community life, and the local government's new regulatory relationship with local society is characterized by practical mutual dependence; these factors have given much space for popular religion to develop. In recent years, in some cases, local governments have taken an even positive and supportive attitude towards indigenous religion in the name of promoting cultural heritage.\n\nInstead of signaling the demise of traditional religion, China's economic development has brought a spiritual renewal. As its images and practices integrate the codes of Chinese culture, Chinese folk religion provides the Chinese people a means to face the challenges of modernisation.\n\nChinese religion draws from a vast heritage of sacred books, which according to the general worldview treat cosmology, history and mythology, mysticism and philosophy, as aspects of the same thing. Historically, the revolutionary shift toward a preference for textual transmission and text-based knowledge over long-standing oral traditions first becomes detectable in the 1st century CE. The spoken word, however, never lost its power. Rather than writing replacing the power of the spoken word, both existed side by side. Scriptures had to be recited and heard in order to be efficacious, and the limitations of written texts were acknowledged particularly in Taoism and folk religion.\n\nThere are the classic books (經 \"jīng\", \"warp\") such as the Confucian canon including the \"Four Books and Five Classics\" (四書五經 \"Sìshū wǔjīng\") and the \"Classic of Filial Piety\" (孝經 \"Xiàojīng\"), then there are the \"Mozi\" (Mohism), the \"Huainanzi\", the \"Shizi\" and the \"Xunzi\". The \"Interactions Between Heaven and Mankind\" (天人感應 \"Tiānrén Gǎnyìng\") is a set of Confucianised doctrines compiled in the Han dynasty by Dong Zhongshu, discussing politics in accordance with a personal \"Tian\" of whom mankind is viewed as the incarnation.\n\nTaoism has a separate body of philosophical, theological and ritual literature, including the fundamental \"Daodejing\" (道德經 \"Book of the Way and its Virtue\"), the \"Daozang\" (Taoist Canon), the \"Liezi\" and the \"Zhuangzi\", and a great number of other texts either included or not within the Taoist Canon. Vernacular literature and the folk religious sects have produced a great body of popular mythological and theological literature, the \"baojuan\" (寶卷 \"precious scrolls\").\n\nRecent discovery of ancient books, such as the \"Guodian texts\" in the 1990s and the \"Huangdi sijing\" (黃帝四經 \"Four Books of the Yellow Emperor\") in the 1970s, has given rise to new interpretations of Chinese religion and new directions in its post-Maoist renewal. Many of these books overcome the dichotomy between Confucian and Taoist traditions. The Guodian texts include, among others, the \"Taiyi Shengshui\" (太一生水 \"The Great One Gives Birth to Water\"). Another book attributed to the Yellow Emperor is the \"Huangdi yinfujing\" (黃帝陰符經 \"Yellow Emperor's Book of the Hidden Symbol\").\n\nClassical books of mythology include the \"Classic of Mountains and Seas\" (山海經 \"Shānhǎijīng\"), the \"Record of Heretofore Lost Works\" (拾遺記 \"Shíyíjì\"), \"The Peach Blossom Spring\" (桃花源記 \"Táohuāyuánjì\"), the \"Investiture of the Gods\" (封神演義 \"Fēngshén yǎnyì\"), and the \"Journey to the West\" (西遊記 \"Xīyóujì\") among others.\n\nFan and Chen summarise four spiritual, cosmological, and moral concepts: \"Tian\" (), Heaven, the source of moral meaning; \"qi\" (), the breath or substance of which all things are made; the practice of \"jingzu\" (), the veneration of ancestors; \"bao ying\" (), moral reciprocity.\n\nConfucians, Taoists, and other schools of thought share basic concepts of \"Tian\". \"Tian\" is both the physical heavens, the home of the sun, moon, and stars, and also the home of the gods and ancestors. \"Tian\" by extension is source of moral meaning, as seen in the political principal, Mandate of Heaven, which holds that \"Tian\", responding to human virtue, grants the imperial family the right to rule and withdraws it when the dynasty declines in virtue. This creativity or virtue (\"de\"), in humans is the potentiality to transcend the given conditions and act wisely and morally. \"Tian\" is therefore both transcendent and immanent.\n\n\"Tian\" is defined in many ways, with many names, the most widely known being \"Tàidì\" 太帝 (the \"Great Deity\") and \"Shàngdì\" 上帝 (the \"Primordial Deity\"). The concept of \"Shangdi\" is especially rooted in the tradition of the Shang dynasty, which gave prominence to the worship of ancestral gods and cultural heroes. The \"Primordial Deity\" or \"Primordial Emperor\" was considered to be embodied in the human realm as the lineage of imperial power. \"Di\" () is a term meaning \"deity\" or \"emperor\" (Latin: \"imperator\", verb \"im-perare\"; \"making from within\"), used either as a name of the primordial god or as a title of natural gods, describing a principle that exerts a fatherly dominance over what it produces. With the Zhou dynasty, that preferred a religion focused on gods of nature, \"Tian\" became a more abstract and impersonal idea of God. A popular representation is the Jade Deity (玉帝 \"Yùdì\") or Jade Emperor (玉皇 \"Yùhuáng\") originally formulated by Taoists. According to classical theology he manifests in five primary forms (五方上帝 \"Wǔfāng Shàngdì\", \"Five Forms of the Highest Deity\").\n\nThe \"qi\" 气 is the breath or substance of which all things are made, including inanimate matter, the living beings, thought and gods. It is the continuum energy—matter. Stephen F. Teiser (1996) translates it as \"stuff\" of \"psychophysical stuff\". Neo-Confucian thinkers such as Zhu Xi developed the idea of \"li\" 理, the \"reason\", \"order\" of Heaven, that is to say the pattern through which the \"qi\" develops, that is the polarity of \"yin\" and \"yang\". In Taoism the \"Tao\" 道 (\"Way\") denotes in one concept both the impersonal absolute \"Tian\" and its order of manifestation (\"li\").\n\n\"Yin\" 陰 and \"yang\" 陽, whose root meanings respectively are \"shady\" and \"sunny\", or \"dark\" and \"light\", are modes of manifestation of the \"qi\", not material things in themselves. Yin is the \"qi\" in its dense, dark, sinking, wet, condensing mode; yang denotes the light, and the bright, rising, dry, expanding modality. Described as \"Taiji\" (the \"Great Pole\"), they represent the polarity and complementarity that enlivens the cosmos. They can also be conceived as \"disorder\" and \"order\", \"activity\" or \"passivity\", with act (\"yang\") usually preferred over receptiveness (\"yin\").\n\nThe concept 神 \"shén\" (cognate of 申 \"shēn\", \"extending, expanding\") is translated as \"gods\" or \"spirits\". There are \"shén\" of nature; gods who were once people, such as the warrior Guan Gong; household gods, such as the Stove God; as well as ancestral gods (\"zu\" or \"zuxian\"). In the domain of humanity the \"shen\" is the \"psyche\", or the power or agency within humans. They are intimately involved in the life of this world. As spirits of stars, mountains and streams, \"shen\" exert a direct influence on things, making phenomena appear and things grow or extend themselves. An early Chinese dictionary, the \"Shuowen jiezi\" by Xu Shen, explains that they \"are the spirits of Heaven\" and they \"draw out the ten thousand things\". As forces of growth the gods are regarded as \"yang\", opposed to a \"yin\" class of entities called 鬼 \"guǐ\" (cognate of 歸 \"guī\", \"return, contraction\"), chaotic beings. A disciple of Zhu Xi noted that \"between Heaven and Earth there is no thing that does not consist of yin and yang, and there is no place where yin and yang are not found. Therefore there is no place where gods and spirits do not exist\". The dragon is a symbol of \"yang\", the principle of generation.\n\nIn Taoist and Confucian thought, the supreme God and its order and the multiplicity of \"shen\" are identified as one and the same. In the \"Yizhuan\", a commentary to the \"Yijing\", it is written that \"one \"yin\" and one \"yang\" are called the Tao ... the unfathomable change of \"yin\" and \"yang\" is called \"shen\"\". In other texts, with a tradition going back to the Han period, the gods and spirits are explained to be names of \"yin\" and \"yang\", forces of contraction and forces of growth.\n\nWhile in popular thought they have conscience and personality, Neo-Confucian scholars tended to rationalise them. Zhu Xi wrote that they act according to the \"li\". Zhang Zai wrote that they are \"the inherent potential (\"liang neng\") of the two ways of \"qi\"\". Cheng Yi said that they are \"traces of the creative process\". Chen Chun wrote that \"shen\" and \"gui\" are expansions and contractions, going and coming, of \"yin\" and \"yang\"—\"qi\".\n\nLike all things in matter, also humans have a soul that is a dialectic of \"hun\" and \"po\" (魂魄), respectively the \"yang\" spirit or mind, and the \"yin\" animal soul that is the body. \"Hun\" (mind) is the \"shen\" (that gives a form to the \"qi\") of humans, and it develops through the \"po\", stretching and moving intelligently in order to grasp things. The \"po\" is the \"feminine\" soul which controls the physiological and psychological activities of man, while the \"hun\", the god attached to the vital breath, is the \"masculine\" soul that is totally independent of corporeal substance. The \"hun\" is virile, independent and perpetual, and as such it never allows itself to be limited in matter. Otherwise said, the \"po\" is the \"earthly\" (\"di\") soul that goes downward, while the \"hun\" is the \"heavenly\" (\"tian\") soul that moves upward.\n\nTo extend life to its full potential the human \"shen\" must be cultivated, resulting in ever clearer, more luminous states of being. It can transform in the pure intelligent breath of deities. In man there's no distinction between rationality and intuition, thinking and feeling: the human being is \"xin\" (), mind-heart. With death, while the \"po\" returns to the earth and disappears, the \"hun\" is thought to be pure awareness or \"qi\", and is the \"shen\" to whom ancestral sacrifices are dedicated.\n\nThe \"shen\" of men who are properly cultivated and honoured after their death are upheld ancestors and progenitors (\"zuxian\" or simply \"zu\" ). When ancestries aren't properly cultivated the world falls into disruption, and they become \"gui\". Ancestral worship is intertwined with totemism, as the earliest ancestors of an ethnic lineage are often represented as animals or associated to them.\n\nAncestors are means of connection with the \"Tian\", the primordial god which does not have form. As ancestors have form, they shape the destiny of humans. Ancestors who have had a significant impact in shaping the destiny of large groups of people, creators of genetic lineages or spiritual traditions, and historical leaders who have invented crafts and institutions for the wealth of the Chinese nation (culture heroes), are exalted among the highest divine manifestations or immortal beings (\"xian\" 仙).\n\nIn fact, in the Chinese tradition there is no distinction between gods (\"shen\") and immortal beings (\"xian\"), transcendental principles and their bodily manifestations. Gods can incarnate with a human form and human beings can reach higher spiritual states by the right way of action, that is to say by emulating the order of Heaven. Humans are considered one of the three aspects of a trinity (三才 \"Sāncái\", \"Three Powers\"), the three foundations of all being; specifically, men are the medium between Heaven that engenders order and forms and Earth which receives and nourishes them. Men are endowed with the role of completing creation.\n\nThe Chinese traditional concept of \"bao ying\" (\"reciprocity\", \"retribution\" or \"judgement\"), is inscribed in the cosmological view of an ordered world, in which all manifestations of being have an allotted span (\"shu\") and destiny, and are rewarded according to the moral-cosmic quality of their actions. It determines fate, as written in Zhou texts: \"on the doer of good, heaven sends down all blessings, and on the doer of evil, he sends down all calamities\" ().\n\nThe cosmic significance of \"bao ying\" is better understood by exploring other two traditional concepts of fate and meaning:\n\n\"Ming yun\" and \"yuan fen\" are linked, because what appears on the surface to be chance (either positive or negative), is part of the deeper rhythm that shapes personal life based on how destiny is directed. Recognising this connection has the result of making a person responsible for his or her actions: doing good for others spiritually improves oneself and contributes to the harmony between men and environmental gods and thus to the wealth of a human community.\n\nThese three themes of the Chinese tradition—moral reciprocity, personal destiny, fateful coincidence—are completed by a fourth notion:\n\nAs part of the trinity of being (the Three Powers), humans are not totally submissive to spiritual force. While under the sway of spiritual forces, humans can actively engage with them, striving to change their own fate to prove the worth of their earthly life. In the Chinese traditional view of human destiny, the dichotomy between \"fatalism\" and \"optimism\" is overcome; human beings can shape their personal destiny to grasp their real worth in the transformation of the universe, seeing their place in the alliance with the gods and with Heaven to surpass the constraints of the physical body and mind.\n\nIn Chinese religion the concept of \"ling\" () is the equivalent of holy and numen. \"Shen\" in the meaning of \"spiritual\" is a synonym. The \"Yijing\" states that \"spiritual means not measured by yin and yang\". \"Ling\" is the state of the \"medium\" of the bivalency (\"yin\"-\"yang\"), and thus it is identical with the inchoate order of creation. Things inspiring awe or wonder because they can't be fathomed as either \"yin\" or \"yang\", because they cross or disrupt the polarity and therefore can't be conceptualised, are regarded as numinous. Entities possessing unusual spiritual characteristics, such as albino members of a species, beings that are part-animal part-human, or people who die in unusual ways such as suicide or on battlefields, are considered numinous.\n\nThe notion of \"xian ling\" (), variously translated as \"divine efficacy, virtue\" or simply the \"numen\", is important for the relationship between men and gods. It describes the manifestation, activity, of the power of a god ( \"ling qi\", \"divine energy\" or \"effervescence\"), the evidence of the holy.\n\nThe term \"xian ling\" may be interpreted as the god revealing his presence in a particular area and temple, through events that are perceived as extraordinary, miraculous. Divine power usually manifests in the presence of a wide public. The \"value\" of human deities (\"xian\") is judged according to his or her efficacy. The perceived effectiveness of a deity to protect or bless also determines how much he or she should be worshipped, how big a temple should be built in his or her honour, and what position in the broader pantheon he or she would attain.\n\nZavidovskaya (2012) has studied how the incentive of temple restorations since the 1980s in northern China was triggered by numerous alleged instances of gods becoming \"active\" and \"returning\", reclaiming their temples and place in society. She mentions the example of a Chenghuang Temple in Yulin, Shaanxi, that was turned into a granary during the Cultural Revolution; it was restored to its original function in the 1980s after seeds stored within were always found to have rotted. This phenomenon, which locals attributed to the god Chenghuang, was taken a sign to empty his residence of grain and allow him back in. The \"ling qi\", divine energy, is believed to accumulate in certain places, temples, making them holy. Temples with a longer history are considered holier than newly built ones, which still need to be filled by divine energy.\n\nAnother example Zavidovskaya cites is the cult of the god Zhenwu in Congluo Yu, Shanxi; the god's temples were in ruins and the cult inactive until the mid 1990s, when a man with terminal cancer, in his last hope prayed (\"bai\" 拜) to Zhenwu. The man began to miraculously recover each passing day, and after a year he was completely healed. As thanksgiving, he organised an opera performance in the god’s honour. A temporary altar with a statue of Zhenwu and a stage for the performance were set up in an open space at the foot of a mountain. During the course of the opera, large white snakes appeared, passive and unafraid of the people, seemingly watching the opera; the snakes were considered by locals to be incarnations of Zhenwu, come to watch the opera held in his honour.\n\nWithin temples, it is common to see banners bearing the phrase \"if the heart is sincere, the god will reveal his power\" ( \"xin cheng shen ling\"). The relationship between men and gods is an exchange of favour. This implies the belief that gods respond to the entreaties of the believer if his or her religious fervour is sincere (\"cheng xin\" ). If a person believes in the god's power with all his heart and expresses piety, the gods are confident in his faith and reveal their efficacious power. At the same time, for faith to strengthen in the devotee’s heart, the deity has to prove his or her efficacy. In exchange for divine favours, a faithful honours the deity with vows (\"huan yuan\" or \"xu yuan\" ), through individual worship, reverence and respect (\"jing shen\" ).\n\nThe most common display of divine power is the cure of diseases after a believer piously requests aid. Another manifestation is granting a request of children. The deity may also manifest through mediumship, entering the body of a shaman-medium and speaking through them. There have been cases of people curing illnesses \"on behalf of a god\" (\"ti shen zhi bing\" ). Gods may also speak to people when they are asleep (\"tuomeng\" ).\n\nWu Hsin-Chao (2014) distinguishes four kinds of Chinese traditional religious organisation: ① ancestry worship; ② deity worship; ③ secret societies; and ④ folk religious sects.\n\nChinese religion in its communal expression involves the worship of gods that are the generative power and tutelary spirit (\"genius loci\") of a locality or a certain aspect of nature (for example water gods, river gods, fire gods, mountain gods), or of gods that are common ancestors of a village, a larger identity, or the Chinese nation (Shennong, Huangdi, Pangu).\n\nThe social structure of this religion is the \"shénshè\" 神社 (literally \"society of a god\"), synonymous with \"shehui\" 社會, in which \"shè\" 社 originally meant the altar of a community's earth god, while 會 \"huì\" means \"association\", \"assembly\", \"church\" or \"gathering\". This type of religious trusts can be dedicated to a god which is bound to a single village or temple or to a god which has a wider following, in multiple villages, provinces or even a national importance. Mao Zedong distinguished \"god associations\", \"village communities\" and \"temple associations\" in his analysis of religious trusts. In his words: \"every kind and type of god [\"shen\"] can have an association [\"hui\"]\", for example the Zhaogong Association, the Guanyin Association, the Guangong Association, the Dashen Association, the Bogong Association, the Wenchang Association, and the like. Within the category of \"hui\" Mao also distinguished the sacrifice associations (\"jiàohuì\" 醮會) which make sacrifices in honour of gods.\n\nThese societies organise gatherings and festivals (\"miaohui\" 廟會) participated by members of the whole village or larger community on the occasions of what are believed to be the birthdays of the gods or other events, or to seek protection from droughts, epidemics, and other disasters. Such festivals invoke the power of the gods for practical goals to \"summon blessings and drive away harm\". Special devotional currents within this framework can be identified by specific names such as Mazuism (媽祖教 \"Māzǔjiào\"), Wang Ye worship, or the cult of the Silkworm Mother.\n\nThis type of religion is prevalent in north China, where lineage religion is absent, private, or historically present only within families of southern origin, and patrilineal ties are based on seniority, and villages are composed of people with different surnames. In this context, the deity societies or temple societies function as poles of the civil organism. Often deity societies incorporate entire villages; this is the reason why in north China can be found many villages which are named after deities and their temples, for example \"Léishénmiào\" village (雷神廟 \"[Village of the] Temple of the Thunder God\") or \"Mǎshénmiàocūn\" (馬神廟村 \"Village of the Temple of the Horse God\").\n\nAnother dimension of the Chinese folk religion is based on family or genealogical worship of deities and ancestors in family altars or private temples (\"simiao\" or \"jiamiao\" ), or ancestral shrines (\"citang\" or \"zongci\" , or also \"zumiao\" ). Kinship associations or churches (\"zōngzú xiéhuì\" 宗族協會), congregating people with the same surname and belonging to the same kin, are the social expression of this religion: these lineage societies build temples where the deified ancestors of a certain group (for example the \"Chens\" or the \"Lins\") are enshrined and worshiped. These temples serve as centres of aggregation for people belonging to the same lineage, and the lineage body may provide a context of identification and mutual assistance for individual persons.\n\nThe construction of large and elaborate ancestral temples traditionally represents a kin's wealth, influence and achievement. Scholar K. S. Yang has explored the ethno-political dynamism of this form of religion, through which people who become distinguished for their value and virtue are considered immortal and receive posthumous divine titles, and are believed to protect their descendants, inspiring a mythological lore for the collective memory of a family or kin.\n\nIf their temples and their deities enshrined acquire popularity they are considered worthy of the virtue of \"ling\", \"efficacy\". Worship of ancestors (\"jingzu\" ) is observed nationally with large-scale rituals on Qingming Festival and other holidays.\n\nThis type of religion prevails in south China, where lineage bonds are stronger and the patrilineal hierarchy is not based upon seniority, and access to corporate resources held by a lineage is based upon the equality of all the lines of descent.\n\n\"The extent to which shamanism pervaded ancient Chinese society\", says scholar Paul R. Goldin (2005), \"is a matter of scholarly dispute, but there can be no doubt that many communities relied upon the unique talents of shamans for their quotidian spiritual needs\". The Chinese usage distinguishes the Chinese \"wu\" tradition or \"Wuism\" as it was called by Jan Jakob Maria de Groot (巫教 \"wūjiào\"; properly shamanic, with control over the gods) from the \"tongji\" tradition (童乩; mediumship, without control of the godly movement), and from non-Han Chinese Altaic shamanisms (薩滿教 \"sàmǎnjiào\") that are practised in northern provinces.\n\nAccording to Andreea Chirita (2014), Confucianism itself, with its emphasis on hierarchy and ancestral rituals, derived from the shamanic discourse of the Shang dynasty. What Confucianism did was to marginalise the \"dysfunctional\" features of old shamanism. However, shamanic traditions continued uninterrupted within the folk religion and found precise and functional forms within Taoism.\n\nIn the Shang and Zhou dynasty, shamans had a role in the political hierarchy, and were represented institutionally by the Ministry of Rites (大宗拍). The emperor was considered the supreme shaman, intermediating between the three realms of heaven, earth and man. The mission of a shaman (巫 \"wu\") is \"to repair the dis-functionalities occurred in nature and generated after the sky had been separated from earth\":\n\nSince the 1980s the practice and study of shamanism has undergone a massive revival in Chinese religion as a means to repair the world to a harmonious whole after industrialisation. Shamanism is viewed by many scholars as the foundation for the emergence of civilisation, and the shaman as \"teacher and spirit\" of peoples. The Chinese Society for Shamanic Studies was founded in Jilin City in 1988.\n\nNuo folk religion is a system of the Chinese folk religion with distinct institutions and cosmology present especially in central-southern China. It arose as an exorcistic religious movement, and it is interethnic but also intimately connected to the Tujia people.\n\nConfucianism and Taoism—which are formalised, ritual, doctrinal or philosophical traditions—can be considered both as embedded within the larger category of Chinese religion, or as separate religions. In fact, one can practise certain folk cults and espouse the tenets of Confucianism as a philosophical framework, Confucian theology instructing to uphold the moral order through the worship of gods and ancestors that is the way of connecting to the Tian and awakening to its harmony (\"li\", \"rite\").\n\nFolk temples and ancestral shrines on special occasions may choose Confucian liturgy (that is called 儒 \"rú\", or sometimes 正統 \"zhèngtǒng\", meaning \"orthoprax\" ritual style) led by Confucian \"sages of rites\" (禮生 \"lǐshēng\") who in many cases are the elders of a local community. Confucian liturgies are alternated with Taoist liturgies and popular ritual styles.\n\nThere are many organised groups of the folk religion that adopt Confucian liturgy and identity, for example the Way of the Gods according to the Confucian Tradition or phoenix churches (Luanism), or the Confucian churches, schools and fellowships such as the \"Yīdān xuétáng\" (一耽學堂) of Beijing, the \"Mèngmǔtáng\" (孟母堂) of Shanghai, the Confucian Fellowship (儒教道壇 \"Rújiào Dàotán\") in northern Fujian, and ancestral temples of the Kong (Confucius) lineage operating as well as Confucian-teaching churches. In November 2015 a national Holy Confucian Church was established with the contribution of many Confucian leaders.\n\nScholar and Taoist priest Kristofer Schipper defines Taoism as a \"liturgical framework\" for the development of local religion. Some currents of Taoism are deeply interwoven with the Chinese folk religion, especially the Zhengyi school, developing aspects of local cults within their doctrines; however Taoists always highlight the distinction between their traditions and those which aren't Taoist. Priests of Taoism are called \"daoshi\" (), literally meaning \"masters of the Tao\", otherwise commonly translated simply the \"Taoists\", as common followers and folk believers who are not part of Taoist orders are not identified as such.\n\nTaoists of the Zhengyi school, who are called \"sǎnjū dàoshi\" () or \"huǒjū dàoshi\" (), respectively meaning \"scattered daoshi\" and \"daoshi living at home (hearth)\", because they can get married and perform the profession of priests as a part-time occupation, may perform rituals of offering (\"jiao\"), thanks-giving, propitiation, exorcism and rites of passage for local communities' temples and private homes. Local gods of local cultures are often incorporated into their altars. The Zhengyi Taoists are trained by other priests of the same sect, and historically received formal ordination by the Celestial Master, although the 63rd Celestial Master Zhang Enpu fled to Taiwan in the 1940s during the Chinese Civil War.\n\nLineages of ritual masters ( \"fashi\"), also referred to as practitioners of \"Faism\", also called \"Folk Taoism\" or (in southeast China) \"Red Taoism\", operate within the Chinese folk religion but outside any institution of official Taoism. The ritual masters, who have the same role of the \"sanju daoshi\" within the fabric of society, aren't considered Taoist priests by the \"daoshi\" of Taoism who trace their lineage to the Celestial Masters and by Taoists officially registered with the state Taoist Church. \"Fashi\" are defined as of \"kataphatic\" (filling) character in opposition to professional Taoists who are \"kenotic\" (of emptying, or apophatic, character).\n\nChina has a long history of sect traditions characterised by a soteriological and eschatological character, often called \"salvationist religions\" (救度宗教 \"jiùdù zōngjiào\"), which emerged from the common religion but are neither ascribable to the lineage cult of ancestors and progenitors, nor to the communal deity religion of village temples, neighbourhood, corporation, or national temples.\n\nThe 20th-century expression of this religions has been studied under Prasenjit Duara's definition of \"redemptive societies\" (救世團體 \"jiùshì tuántǐ\"), while modern Chinese scholarship describes them as \"folk religious sects\" (民間宗教 \"mínjiān zōngjiào\", 民間教門 \"mínjiān jiàomén\" or 民间教派 \"mínjiān jiàopài\"), abandoning the ancient derogatory definition of \"xiéjiào\" (邪教), \"evil religion\".\n\nThey are characterised by egalitarianism, a foundation through a charismatic figure and a direct divine revelation, a millenarian eschatology and voluntary path of salvation, an embodied experience of the numinous through healing and cultivation, and an expansive orientation through good deeds, evangelism and philanthropy. Their practices are focused on improving morality, body cultivation, and recitation of scriptures.\n\nMany of the redemptive religions of the 20th and 21st century aspire to become the repository of the entirety of the Chinese tradition in the face of Western modernism and materialism. This group of religions includes Yiguandao and other sects belonging to the Xiantiandao ( \"Way of Former Heaven\"), Jiugongdao ( \"Way of the Nine Palaces\"), various proliferations of the Luo teaching, the Zaili teaching, and the more recent De teaching, Weixinist, Xuanyuan and Tiandi teachings, the latter two focused respectively on the worship of Huangdi and the universal God. Also, the qigong schools are developments of the same religious context.\n\nThese movements were banned in the early Republican China and later Communist China. Many of them still remain illegal, underground or unrecognised in China, while others—specifically the De teaching, Tiandi teachings, Xuanyuan teaching, Weixinism and Yiguandao—have developed cooperation with mainland China's academic and non-governmental organisations. The Sanyi teaching is an organised folk religion founded in the 16th century, present in the Putian region (Xinghua) of Fujian where it is legally recognised. Some of these sects began to register as branches of the state Taoist Association since the 1990s.\n\nAnother category that has been sometimes confused with that of the sects of salvation by scholars, is that of the secret societies (會道門 \"huìdàomén\", 祕密社會 \"mìmì shèhuì\", or 祕密結社 \"mìmì jiéshè\"). They are religious communities of initiatory and secretive character, including rural militias such as the Red Spears (紅槍會) and the Big Knives (大刀會), and fraternal organisations such as the Green Gangs (青幫) and the Elders' Societies (哥老會). They became very popular in the early republican period, and often labeled as \"heretical doctrines\" (宗教異端 \"zōngjiào yìduān\"). Recent scholarship has created the label of \"secret sects\" (祕密教門 \"mìmì jiàomén\") to distinguish the peasant \"secret societies\" with a positive dimension of the Yuan, Ming and Qing periods, from the negatively viewed \"secret societies\" of the early republic that became instruments of anti-revolutionary forces (the Guomindang or Japan).\n\nA further distinctive type of sects of the folk religion, that are possibly the same as the positive \"secret sects\", are the martial sects. They combine two aspects: the \"wénchǎng\" (文場 \"cultural field\"), that is the doctrinal aspect characterised by elborate cosmologies, theologies, initiatory and ritual patterns, and that is usually kept secretive; and the \"wǔchǎng\" (武場 \"martial field\"), that is the body cultivation practice and that is usually the \"public face\" of the sect. They were outlawed by Ming imperial edicts that continued to be enforced until the fall of the Qing dynasty in the 20th century. An example of martial sect is Meihuaism (梅花教 \"Méihuājiào\", \"Plum Flowers\"), that has become very popular throughout northern China. In Taiwan, virtually all of the \"redemptive societies\" operate freely since the late 1980s.\n\nThe Tiandi teachings is a religion that encompasses two branches, the Holy Church of the Heavenly Virtue (天德聖教 \"Tiāndé shèngjiào\") and the Church of the Heavenly Deity (天帝教 \"Tiāndìjiào\"), both emerged from the techings of Xiao Changming and Li Yujie, disseminated in the early 20th century. The latter is actually an outgrowth of the former established in the 1980s.\n\nThe religions focus on the worship of \"Tiandi\" (), the \"Heavenly Deity\" or \"Heavenly Emperor\", on health through the proper cultivation of qi, and teach a style of qigong named \"Tianren qigong\". According to scholars, Tiandi teachings derive from the Taoist tradition of Huashan, where Li Yujie studied for eight years. The Church of the Heavenly Deity is very active both in Taiwan and mainland China, where it has high-level links.\n\nWeixinism ( or simply ) is a religion primarily focused on the \"orthodox lineages of \"Yijing\" and feng shui\", the Hundred Schools of Thought, and worship of the \"three great ancestors\" (Huangdi, Yandi and Chiyou). The movement promotes the restoration of the authentic roots of the Chinese civilization and Chinese reunification.\n\nThe Weixinist Church, whose headquarters are in Taiwan, is also active in Mainland China in the key birthplaces of the Chinese culture. It has links with the government of Henan where it has established the \"City of Eight Trigrams\" templar complex on Yunmeng Mountain (of the Yan Mountains), and it has also built temples in Hebei.\n\nVincent Goossaert has recently (2011) published a review of scholarly works which study \"north China folk religion\" as a distinct phenomenon. In contrast to the folk religion of southern and southeastern provinces which is primarily focused on the lineages and their churches (\"zōngzú xiéhuì\" 宗族協會) focusing on ancestral gods, the folk religion of central-northern China (North China Plain) predominantly hinges on the communal worship of tutelary deities of creation and nature as identity symbols by villages populated by families of different surnames, structured into \"communities of the god(s)\" (\"shénshè\" 神社, or \"huì\" 會, \"association\"), which organise temple ceremonies (\"miaohui\" 廟會), involving processions and pilgrimages, and led by indigenous ritual masters (\"fashi\") who are often hereditary and linked to secular authority.\n\nNorthern and southern folk religions also have a different pantheon, of which the northern one is composed of more ancient gods of Chinese mythology. Furthermore, folk religious sects have historically been more successful in the central plains and in the northeastern provinces than in southern China, and central-northern folk religion shares characteristics of some of the sects, such as the heavy importance of mother goddess worship and shamanism, as well as their scriptural transmission. Confucian churches as well have historically found much resonance among the population of the northeast; in the 1930s the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue alone aggregated at least 25% of the population of the state of Manchuria and contemporary Shandong has been analysed as an area of rapid growth of folk Confucian groups.\n\nAlong the southeastern coast, ritual functions of the folk religion are reportedly dominated by Taoism, both in registered and unregistered forms (Zhengyi Taoism and unrecognised \"fashi\" orders), which since the 1990s has developed quickly in the area.\n\nGoossaert talks of this distinction, although recognising it as an oversimplification, of a \"Taoist south\" and a \"village-religion/Confucian centre-north\", with the northern context also characterised by important orders of \"folk Taoist\" ritual masters, one of which are the 陰陽生 \"yīnyángshēng\" (\"sages of yin and yang\"), and sectarian traditions, and also by a low influence of Buddhism and official Taoism.\n\nThe folk religion of northeast China has unique characteristics deriving from the interaction of Han religion with Tungus and Manchu shamanisms; these include \"chūmǎxiān\" (出馬仙 \"riding for the immortals\") shamanism, the worship of foxes and other zoomorphic deities, and the Fox Gods (狐神 \"Húshén\")—Great Lord of the Three Foxes (胡三太爺 \"Húsān Tàiyé\") and the Great Lady of the Three Foxes (胡三太奶 \"Húsān Tàinǎi\")—at the head of pantheons. Otherwise, in the religious context of Inner Mongolia there has been a significant integration of Han Chinese into the traditional folk religion of the region.\n\nIn recent years there has also been an assimilation of deities from Tibetan folk religion, especially wealth gods. In Tibet, across broader western China, and in Inner Mongolia, there has been a growth of the cult of Gesar with the explicit support of the Chinese government, a cross-ethnic Han-Tibetan, Mongol and Manchu deity (the Han identify him as an aspect of the god of war analogically with Guandi) and culture hero whose mythology is embodied as a culturally important epic poem.\n\nChinese religion has both influenced, and in turn has been influenced by, indigenous religions of ethnic groups that the Han Chinese have encountered along their ethnogenetic history. Seiwert (1987) finds evidence of pre-Chinese religions in the folk religion of certain southeastern provinces such as Fujian and Taiwan, especially in the local \"wu\" and lineages of ordained ritual masters.\n\nA process of sinicization, or more appropriately a \"Taoisation\", is also the more recent experience of the indigenous religions of some distinct ethnic minorities of China, especially southwestern people. Chinese Taoists gradually penetrate within the indigenous religions of such peoples, in some cases working side by side with indigenous priests, in other cases taking over the latter's function and integrating them by requiring their ordination as Taoists. Usually, indigenous ritual practices remain unaffected and are adopted into Taoist liturgy, while indigenous gods are identified with Chinese gods. Seiwert discusses this phenomenon of \"merger into Chinese folk religion\" not as a mere elimination of non-Chinese indigenous religions, but rather as a cultural re-orientation. Local priests of southwestern ethnic minorities often acquire prestige by identifying themselves as Taoists and adopting Taoist holy texts.\n\nMou (2012) writes that \"Taoism has formed an indissoluble bond\" with indigenous religions of southwestern ethnic minorities, especially the Tujia, Yi and Yao. Seiwert mentions the Miao of Hunan. \"Daogongism\" is Taoism among the Zhuang, directed by the \"dàogōng\" (道公 \"lords of the Tao\") and it forms an established important aspect of the broader Zhuang folk religion.\n\nOn the other hand, it is also true that in more recent years there has been a general revival of indigenous lineages of ritual masters without identification of these as Taoists and support from the state Chinese Taoist Church. An example is the revival of lineages of \"bimo\" (\"scripture sages\") priests among the Yi peoples. Bimoism has a tradition of theological literature and though clergy ordination, and this is among the reasons why it is taken in high consideration by the Chinese government. Bamo Ayi (2001) attests that \"since the early 1980s ... minority policy turned away from promoting assimilation of Han ways\".\n\nChinese religions are polytheistic, meaning that many deities are worshipped as part of what has been defined as \"yǔzhòu shénlùn\" (宇宙神論), translated as \"cosmotheism\", a worldview in which divinity is inherent to the world itself. The gods (\"shen\" 神; \"growth\", \"beings that give birth\") are interwoven energies or principles that generate phenomena which reveal or reproduce the way of Heaven, that is to say the order (\"li\") of the Greatnine(\"Tian\").\n\nIn Chinese tradition, there is not a clear distinction between the gods and their physical body or bodies (from stars to trees and animals); the qualitative difference between the two seems not to have ever been emphasised. Rather, the disparity is said to be more quantitative than qualitative. In doctrinal terms, the Chinese view of gods is related to the understanding of \"qi\", the life force, as the gods and their phenomenal productions are manifestations of it. In this way, all natural bodies are believed to be able to attain supernatural attributes by acting according to the universal oneness. Meanwhile, acting wickedly (that is to say against the Tian and its order) brings to disgrace and disaster.\n\nIn folk religions, gods (\"shen\") and immortals (\"xian\" 仙) are not specifically distinguished from each other. Gods can incarnate in human form and human beings can reach immortality, which means to attain higher spirituality, since all the spiritual principles (gods) are begotten of the primordial \"qi\" before any physical manifestation.\n\nIn the \"Doctrine of the Mean\", one of the Confucian four books, the \"zhenren\" (wise) is the man who has achieved a spiritual status developing his true sincere nature. This status, in turn, enables him to fully develop the true nature of others and of all things. The sage is able to \"assist the transforming and nourishing process of Heaven and Earth\", forming a trinity (三才 \"Sāncái\", the \"Three Powers\") with them. In other words, in the Chinese tradition humans are or can be the medium between Heaven and Earth, and have the role of completing what had been initiated.\n\nTaoist schools in particular espouse an explicit spiritual pathway which pushes the earthly beings to the edge of eternity. Since the human body is a microcosm, enlivened by the universal order of yin and yang like the whole cosmos, the means of immortality can be found within oneself.\n\nAmong those worshipped as immortal heroes (\"xian\", exalted beings) are historical individuals distinguished for their worth or bravery, those who taught crafts to others and formed societies establishing the order of Heaven, ancestors or progenitors (\"zu\" 祖), and the creators of a spiritual tradition. The concept of \"human divinity\" is not self-contradictory, as there is no unbridgeable gap between the two realms; rather, the divine and the human are mutually contained.\n\nIn comparison with gods of an environmental nature, who tend to remain stable throughout human experience and history, individual human deities change in time. Some endure for centuries, while others remain localised cults, or vanish after a short time. Immortal beings are conceived as \"constellations of qi\", which is so vibrant in certain historical individuals that, upon the person's death, this \"qi\" nexus does not dissipate but persists, and is reinforced by living people's worship. The energetic power of a god is thought to reverberate on the worshipers influencing their fortune.\n\nGods and immortals (collectively 神仙 \"shénxiān\") in the Chinese cultural tradition reflect a hierarchical, multiperspective experience of divinity. In Chinese language there is a terminological distinction between 神 \"shén\", 帝 \"dì\" and 仙 \"xiān\". Although the usage of the former two is sometimes blurred, it corresponds to the distinction in Western cultures between \"god\" and \"deity\", Latin \"genius\" (meaning a generative principle, \"spirit\") and \"deus\" or \"divus\"; \"dì\", sometimes translated as \"thearch\", implies a manifested or incarnate \"godly\" power. It is etymologically and figuratively analogous to the concept of \"di\" as the base of a fruit, which falls and produces other fruits. This analogy is attested in the \"Shuowen jiezi\" explaining \"deity\" as \"what faces the base of a melon fruit\". The latter term 仙 \"xiān\" unambiguously means a man who has reached immortality, similarly to the Western idea of \"hero\".\n\nMany classical books have lists and hierarchies of gods and immortals, among which the \"Completed Record of Deities and Immortals\" (神仙通鑒 \"Shénxiān tōngjiàn\") of the Ming dynasty, and the \"Biographies of Deities and Immortals\" (神仙傳 \"Shénxiān zhuán\") by Ge Hong (284-343). There's also the older \"Liexian zhuan\" (列仙傳 \"Collected Biographies of Immortals\").\n\nThere are the great cosmic gods representing the first principle in its unmanifested state or its creative order—Yudi (玉帝 \"Jade Deity\") and Doumu (斗母 \"Mother of the Meaning\" or \"Great Chariot\"), Pangu (盤古, the macranthropic metaphor of the cosmos), Xiwangmu (西王母 \"Queen Mother of the West\") and Dongwanggong (東王公 \"King Duke of the East\") who personificate respectively the yin and the yang, as well as the dimensional Three Patrons and the Five Deities; then there are the sky and weather gods, the scenery gods, the vegetal and animal gods, and gods of human virtues and crafts. These are interpreted in different ways in Taoism and folk sects, the former conferring them long kataphatic names. Below the great deities, there is the unquantifiable number of gods of nature, as every phenomena have or are gods.\n\nThe Three Patrons (三皇 \"Sānhuáng\")—Fuxi, Nüwa and Shennong—are the \"vertical\" manifestation of the primordial God corresponding to the Three Realms (三界 \"Sānjiè\"), representing the yin and yang and the medium between them, that is the human being.\n\nThe Five Deities (五帝 \"Wǔdì\") or \"Five Forms of the Highest Deity\" (五方上帝 \"Wǔfāng Shàngdì\")—the Yellow, Green or Blue, Black, Red and White Deities—are the five \"horizontal\" manifestations of the primordial God and according with the Three Realms they have a celestial, a terrestrial and a chthonic form. They correspond to the five phases of creation, the five constellations rotating around the celestial pole, the five sacred mountains and the five directions of space (the four cardinal directions and the centre), and the five Dragon Gods (龍神 \"Lóngshén\") which represent their mounts, that is to say the chthonic forces they preside over.\n\nThe Yellow God (黃神 \"Huángshén\") or \"Yellow God of the Northern Dipper\" (黃神北斗 \"Huángshén Běidǒu\") is of peculiar importance, as he is a form of the universal God (Tian or Shangdi) symbolising the \"axis mundi\" (Kunlun), or the intersection between the Three Patrons and the Five Deities, that is the center of the cosmos. He is therefore described in the \"Shizi\" as the \"Yellow Emperor with Four Faces\" (黃帝四面 \"Huángdì Sìmiàn\"). His human incarnation, the \"Yellow Emperor (or Deity) of the Mysterious Origin\" (軒轅黃帝 \"Xuānyuán Huángdì\"), is said to be the creator of the \"Huaxia\" civility, of marriage and morality, language and lineage, and patriarch of all the Chinese together with the Red Deity. Xuanyuan was the fruit of virginal birth, as his mother Fubao conceived him as she was aroused, while walking in the country, by a lightning from the Big Dipper.\n\nThe worship of mother goddesses for the cultivation of offspring is present all over China, but predominantly in northern provinces. There are nine main goddesses, and all of them tend to be considered as manifestations or attendant forces of a singular goddess identified variously as Bixia (碧霞 \"Blue Dawn\"), the daughter or female consort of the Green God of Mount Tai, or Houtu (后土 the \"Queen of the Earth\"). Bixia herself is identified by Taoists as the more ancient goddess Xiwangmu, Goddesses are commonly entitled \"mǔ\" (母 \"mother\"), \"lǎomǔ\" (老母 \"old mother\"), \"shèngmǔ\" (聖母 \"holy mother\"), \"niángniáng\" (娘娘 \"lady\"), \"nǎinai\" (奶奶 \"granny\").\n\nAltars of goddess worship are usually arranged with Bixia at the center and two goddesses at her sides, most frequently the Lady of Eyesight and the Lady of Offspring. A different figure but with the same astral connections as Bixia is the Qixing Niangniang (七星娘娘 \"Goddess of the Seven Stars\"). There is also the cluster of the Holy Mothers of the Three Skies (三霄聖母 \"Sanxiao Shengmu\"; or \"Ladies of the Three Skies\", 三霄娘娘 \"Sanxiao Niangniang\"), composed of \"Yunxiao Guniang\", \"Qiongxiao Guniang\" and \"Bixiao Guniang\". In southeastern provinces the cult of Chen Jinggu (陳靖姑) is identified by some scholars as an emanation of the northern cult of Bixia.\n\nThere are other local goddesses with motherly features, including the northern Canmu (蠶母 \"Silkworm Mother\") and Mazu (媽祖 \"Ancestral Mother\"), popular in provinces along the eastern coast and in Taiwan. The title of \"Queen of Heaven\" (天后 \"Tiānhòu\") is most frequently attributed to Mazu and Doumu (the cosmic goddess).\n\nAdam Yuet Chau identifies five styles or modalities of \"doing\" Chinese religion:\n\nGenerally speaking, the Chinese believe that spiritual and material well-being ensues from the harmony of humanity and gods in their participation in the same cosmic power, and also believe that by taking the right path and practice anybody is able to reach the absolute reality. Religious practice is therefore regarded as the bridge to link the human world to the spiritual source, maintaining the harmony of the micro and macrocosmos, protecting the individual and the world from disruption. In this sense, the Chinese view of human life is not deterministic, but one is a master of his own life and can choose to collaborate with the deities for a harmonious world.\nChinese culture being a holistic system, in which every aspect is a part of a whole, Chinese folk religious practice is often intermingled with political, educational and economic concerns. A gathering or event may be encompassed with all of these aspects; in general, the commitment (belief) and the process or rite (practice) together form the internal and external dimensions of Chinese religious life. In village communities, religious services are often organised and led by local people themselves. Leaders are usually selected among male heads of families or lineages, or village heads.\n\nA simple form of individual practice is to show respect for the gods (\"jing shen\" ) through \"jingxiang\" (incense offering), and the exchange of vows (\"huan yuan\" ). Sacrifice can consist of incense, oil, and candles, as well as money. Religious devotion may also express in the form of performance troupes (\"huahui\"), involving many types of professionals such as stilt walkers, lion dancers, musicians, martial arts masters, \"yangge\" dancers, and story-tellers.\n\nDeities can also be respected through moral deeds in their name (\"shanshi\" ), and self-cultivation (\"xiuxing\" ). Some forms of folk religion develop clear prescriptions for believers, such as detailed lists of meritorious and sinful deeds in the form of \"morality books\" (\"shanshu\" ) and ledgers of merit and demerit. Involvement in the affairs of communal or intra-village temples are perceived by believers as ways for accumulating merit (\"gongde\" ). Virtue is believed to accumulate in one's heart, which is seen as energetic centre of the human body (\"zai jun xin zuo tian fu\" ). Practices of communication with the gods comprehend different forms of Chinese shamanism, such as \"wu\" shamanism and \"tongji\" mediumship, or \"fuji\" practice.\n\nClassical Chinese has characters for different types of sacrifice, probably the oldest way to communicate with divine forces, today generally encompassed by the definition \"jìsì\" 祭祀. However different in scale and quantity, all types of sacrifice would normally involve food, wine, meat and later incense.\n\nSacrifices usually differ according to the kind of deity they are devoted to. Traditionally, cosmic and nature gods are offered uncooked (or whole) food, while ancestors are offered cooked food. Moreover, sacrifices for gods are made inside the temples that enshrine them, while sacrifices for ancestors are made outside temples. Yearly sacrifices (\"ji\") are made to Confucius, the Red and Yellow Emperors, and other cultural heroes and ancestors.\n\nBoth in past history and at the present, all sacrifices are assigned with both religious and political purposes. Some gods are considered carnivorous, for example the River God (河神 \"Héshén\") and Dragon Gods, and offering to them requires animal sacrifice.\n\nThe aims of rituals and sacrifices may be of thanksgiving and redeeming, usually involving both. Various sacrifices are intended to express gratitude toward the gods in the hope that spiritual blessing and protection will continue. The \"jiào\" 醮, an elaborate Taoist sacrifice or \"rite of universal salvation\", is intended to be a cosmic community renewal, that is to say a reconciliation of a community around its spiritual centre. The \"jiao\" ritual usually starts with \"zhai\", \"fasting and purification\", that is meant as an atonement for evil-doing, then followed by sacrificial offerings.\n\nThis rite, of great political importance, can be intended for the whole nation. In fact, as early as the Song dynasty, emperors asked renowned Taoists to perform such rituals on their behalf or for the entire nation. The modern Chinese republic has given approval for Taoists to conduct such rituals since the 1990s, with the aim of protecting the country and the nation.\n\nA variety of practices are concerned with personal well-being and spiritual growth. Rites of passage are intended to narrate the holy significance of each crucial change throughout a life course. These changes, which are physical and social and at the same time spiritual, are marked by elaborate customs and religious rituals.\n\nIn the holistic view about nature and the human body and life, as macro and microcosmos, the life process of a human being is equated with the rhythm of seasons and cosmic changes. Hence, birth is likened to spring, youth to summer, maturity to autumn and old age to winter. There are ritual passages for those who belong to a religious order of priests or monks, and there are the rituals of the stages in a life, the main four being birth, adulthood, marriage and death.\n\nChinese language has a variety of words defining the temples of the Chinese religion. Some of these terms have a precise functional use, although with time some confusion has arisen and some of them have been used interchangeably in some contexts. Collective names defining \"temples\" or places of worship are 寺廟 \"sìmiào\" and 廟宇 \"miàoyǔ\".\n\nHowever, 寺 \"sì\", which originally meant a type of residence for imperial officials, with the introduction of Buddhism in China became associated with Buddhist monasteries as many officials donated their residences to the monks. Today \"sì\" and 寺院 \"sìyuàn\" (\"monastery\") are used almost exclusively for Buddhist monasteries, with sporadic exceptions, and \"sì\" is a component character of names for Chinese mosques. Another term now mostly associated with Buddhism is 庵 \"ān\", \"thatched hut\", originally a form of dwelling of monks later extended to mean monasteries.\n\nTemples can be public, private (私廟 \"sìmiào\") and household temples (家廟 jiāmiào). The \"jing\" 境 is a broader \"territory of a god\", a geographic region or a village or city with its surroundings, marked by multiple temples or complexes of temples and delineated by the processions.\n\nPertaining to Chinese religion the most common term is 廟 \"miào\" graphically meaning a \"shrine\" or \"sacred enclosure\"; it is the general Chinese term that is translated with the general Western \"temple\", and is used for temples of any of the deities of polytheism. Other terms include 殿 \"diàn\" which indicates the \"house\" of a god, enshrining one specific god, usually a chapel within a larger temple or sacred enclosure; and 壇 \"tán\" which means \"altar\" and refers to any indoor or outdoor altars, majestic outdoor altars being those for the worship of Heaven and Earth and other gods of the environment. 宮 \"Gōng\", originally referring to imperial palaces, became associated to temples of representations of the universal God or the highest gods and consorts, such as the Queen of Heaven.\n\nAnother group of words is used for the temples of ancestral religion: 祠 \"cí\" (either \"temple\" or \"shrine\", meaning a sacred enclosure) or 宗祠 \"zōngcí\" (\"ancestor shrine\"). These terms are also used for temples dedicated to immortal beings. 祖廟 \"Zǔmiào\" (\"original temple\") instead refers to a temple which is believed to be the original temple of a deity, the most legitimate and powerful.\n\n堂 \"Táng\", meaning \"hall\" or \"church hall\", originally referred to the central hall of secular buildings but it entered religious usage as a place of worship of the folk religious sects. Christianity in China has borrowed this term from the sects.\n\n觀 \"Guàn\" is the appropriate Chinese translation of the Western term \"temple\", as both refer to \"contemplation\" (of the divine, according to the astral patterns in the sky or the icon of a deity). Together with its extension 道觀 \"dàoguàn\" (\"to contemplate or observe the Dao\"), it is used exclusively for Taoist temples and monasteries of the state Taoist Church.\n\nGeneric terms include 院 \"yuàn\" meaning \"sanctuary\", from the secular usage for a courtyard, college or hospital institution; 岩 \"yán\" (\"rock\") and 洞 \"dòng\" (\"hole\", \"cave\") referring to temples set up in caves or on cliffs. Other generic terms are 府 \"fǔ\" (\"house\"), originally of imperial officials, which is a rarely used term; and 亭 \"tíng\" (\"pavilion\") which refers to the areas of a temple where laypeople can stay. There is also 神祠 \"shéncí\", \"shrine of a god\".\n\nAncestral shrines are sacred places in which lineages of related families, identified by shared surnames, worship their common progenitors. These temples are the \"collective representation\" of a group, and function as centers where religious, social and economic activities intersect.\n\nChinese temples are traditionally built according to the styles and materials (wood and bricks) of Chinese architecture, and this continues to be the rule for most of the new temples. However, in the early 20th century and especially in the mainland religious revival of the early 21st century, there has been a proliferation of new styles in temple construction. These include the use of new materials (stones and concrete, stainless steel and glass) and the combination of Chinese traditional shapes with styles of the West or of transnational modernity. Examples can be found in the large ceremonial complexes of mainland China.\n\n分香 \"Fēnxiāng\", meaning an \"incense division\", is a term that defines both hierarchical networks of temples dedicated to a god, and the ritual process by which these networks form. These temple networks are economic and social bodies, and in certain moments of history have even taken military functions. They also represent routes of pilgrimage, with communities of devotees from the affiliated temples going up in the hierarchy to the senior temple (\"zumiao\").\n\nWhen a new temple dedicated to the same god is founded, it enters the network through the ritual of division of incense. This consists in filling the incense burner of the new temple with ashes brought from the incense burner of an existing temple. The new temple is therefore spiritually affiliated to the older temple where the ashes were taken, and directly below it in the hierarchy of temples.\n\n廟會 \"Miàohuì\", literally \"gatherings at the temple\", are \"collective rituals to greet the gods\" (迎神賽會 \"yíngshén sàihuì\") that are held at the temples on various occasione such as the Chinese New Year or the birthday or holiday of the god enshrined in the temple. In north Chine they are also called 賽會 \"sàihuì\" (\"communal ritual gatherings\") or 香會 \"xiānghuì\" (\"incense gatherings\"), while a 賽社 \"sàishè\" (\"communal ritual body\") is the association which organises such events and by extension it has become another name of the event itself.\n\nActivities include rituals, theatrical performances, processions of the gods' images throughout villages and cities, and offerings to the temples. In north China temple gatherings are generally week-long and large events attracting tens of thousands of people, while in south China they tend to be smaller and village-based events.\n\nAccording to Yang and Hu (2012):\n\nAccording to their research, 55.5% of the adult population (15+) of China, or 578 million people in absolute numbers, believe and practise folk religions, including a 20% who practice ancestor religion or communal worship of deities, and the rest who practise what Yang and Hu define \"individual\" folk religions like devotion to specific gods such as Caishen. Members of folk religious sects are not taken into account. Around the same year, Kenneth Dean estimates 680 million people involved in folk religion, or 51% of the total population. At the same time, self-identified folk religion believers in Taiwan are 42.7% of the adult (20+) population, or 16 million people in absolute numbers, although devotion to ancestors and gods can be found even among other religions' believers or 88% of the population. According to the 2005 census of Taiwan, Taoism is the statistical religion of 33% of the population.\n\nThe Chinese Spiritual Life Survey conducted by the Center on Religion and Chinese Society of Purdue University, published in 2010, found that 754 million people (56.2%) practise ancestor religion, but only 216 million people (16%) \"believe in the existence\" of the ancestor. The same survey says that 173 million (13%) practise Chinese folk religion in a Taoist framework.\n\nThe China Family Panel Studies' survey of 2012, published in 2014, based on the Chinese General Social Surveys which are held on robust samples of tens of thousands of people, found that only 12.6% of the population of China belongs to its five state-sanctioned religious groups, while among the rest of the population only 6.3% are atheists, and the remaining 81% (1 billion people) pray to or worship gods and ancestors in the manner of the traditional popular religion. The same survey has found that 2.2% (≈30 million) of the total population declares to be affiliated to one or another of the many folk religious sects. At the same time, reports of the Chinese government claim that the sects have about the same number of followers of the five state-sanctioned religions counted together (~13% ≈180 million).\n\nScholars have studied the economic dimension of Chinese folk religion, whose rituals and temples interweave a form of grassroots socio-economic capital for the well-being of local communities, fostering the circulation of wealth and its investment in the \"sacred capital\" of temples, gods and ancestors.\n\nThis religious economy already played a role in periods of imperial China, plays a significant role in modern Taiwan, and is seen as a driving force in the rapid economic development in parts of rural China, especially the southern and eastern coasts.\n\nAccording to Law (2005), in his study about the relationship between the revival of folk religion and the recostruction of patriarchal civilisation:\n\nYang Mayfair (2007) defines it as an \"embedded capitalism\", which preserves local identity and autonomy, and an \"ethical capitalism\" in which the drive for individual accumulation of money is tempered by religious and kinship ethics of generosity which foster the sharing and investment of wealth in the construction of civil society.\n\nMost of the overseas Chinese populations have maintained Chinese folk religions, often adapting to the new environment by developing new cults and incorporating elements of local traditions. In Southeast Asia, Chinese deities are subject to a \"re-territorialisation\" and maintain their relation to the ethnic associations (i.e. the Hainanese Association or the Fujianese Association, each of them has a patron deity and manages one or more temples of such a deity).\n\nThe most important deity among Southeast Asian Chinese is Mazu, the Queen of Heaven and goddess of the sea. This is related to the fact that most of these Chinese populations are from southeastern provinces of China, where the goddess is very popular. Some folk religious sects have spread successfully among Southeast Asian Chinese. They include especially Church of Virtue (Deism), Zhenkongdao and Yiguandao.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

During the ritual, a coven's High Priestess enters a trance and requests that the Goddess or Triple Goddess, symbolized by the Moon, enter her body and speak through her. The High Priestess may be aided by the High Priest, who invokes the spirit of the Goddess. During her trance, the Goddess speaks through the High Priestess.\n\nThe name most likely comes from a depiction of two women and the moon on an ancient Greek vase, believed to date from the second century BCE.\n\nIn classical times, ancient Thessalian witches were believed to control the moon, according to the tract: \"If I command the moon, it will come down; and if I wish to withhold the day, night will linger over my head; and again, if I wish to embark on the sea, I need no ship, and if I wish to fly through the air, I am free from my weight.\"\n\nThe drawing down of the moon derives from the Vangelo. In this a poem defining the drawing down of the moon is written and this has been used as the basis for the drawing down of the moon by various Wiccan groups. The practice forms part of both Gardnerian and Cochranian rites. The practice is also reference in Reginald Scot's \"The Discoverie of Witchcraft\".\n\nThough a number of Wiccan traditions may practice a variation of the ritual, the modern form likely originated in Gardnerian Wicca, and is considered a central element of Gardnerian and Alexandrian Wiccan ceremonies. During the modern rite, the High Priestess may recite the Charge of the Goddess, a text based in a mixture of writings by Gerald Gardner and Aleister Crowley, though now often used in its rescension by Doreen Valiente, High Priestess in the Gardnerian tradition.\n\nMel D. Faber explains the ritual in psychoanalytical terms of attempting to re-unite with the protective-mother archetype.\n\nIn modern traditions, some solitary Wiccans also perform the ritual, usually within a circle and performed under the light of a full Moon. The solitary will stand in the Goddess Pose (both arms held high, palms up, body and arms forming a 'Y') and recite a charge, or chant.\n\n\"Drawing Down the Moon\" is also the title of a book by National Public Radio reporter, Margot Adler— \"\"—originally published in 1979. Adler writes:\n\n...in this ritual, one of the most serious and beautiful in the modern Craft, the priest invokes into the priestess (or, depending on your point of view, she evokes from within herself) the Goddess or Triple Goddess, symbolized by the phases of the moon. She is known by a thousand names, and among them were those I had used as a child. In some Craft rituals the priestess goes into a trance and speaks; in other traditions the ritual is a more formal dramatic dialogue, often of intense beauty, in which, again, the priestess speaks, taking the role of the Goddess. In both instances, the priestess functions as the Goddess incarnate, within the circle.\n\n\n\n"}

Some of these prohibitions—those listed in Leviticus 18, known as ' ()—are considered such a serious transgression of Jewish law that one must give up one's life rather than transgress one of them. (This does not necessarily apply to a rape victim.) This is as opposed to most other prohibitions, in which one is generally required to transgress the commandment when a life is on the line.\n\nAdultery is prohibited by the seventh of the Ten Commandments () which says simply:\n\nIt is forbidden for a man to have sexual relations with a married woman not his wife. (, )\n\nA man is not allowed to have sexual relations with a woman - including his wife - during and after her menstrual period (), until after she undergoes the proper cleansing procedures in a mikveh. Such a woman is referred to as niddah.\n\nReligious intermarriage is forbidden in Judaism. There are differing opinions among the rabbis as to when the prohibition on sexual relations with non-Jews is from the Torah, and when it is rabbinic.\n\nSexual relation with certain close relations are forbidden. Though they are generally called incestuous relations, the biblical list does not necessarily correspond to those prohibited under state laws. The prohibited relations are:\n\n\nIn addition to the relationships biblically prohibited to Jews, rabbis have gone further to prohibit certain additional relationships with various blood relatives and in-laws. These are called \"Shni'ot\" (secondary prohibitions). Some of these are:\n\nAdopted children who are raised together are not permitted to marry because of appearances, even if they are not biologically related.\n\nThe Bible excludes certain categories of people from taking part in the \"qahal (assembly) of Hashem\". Jewish tradition considers this to be solely a limitation on marriage.\n\nA Jew is prohibited from marrying a male Moabite and Ammonite convert (); or an Egyptian or Edomite convert up to the third generation from conversion ().\n\nNethinim / Gibeonites are prohibited by rabbinic injunction.\n\nAs the people currently living in those areas may not be descended from the original peoples, these prohibitions may not apply today.\n\nA mamzer in Jewish law is a child resulting from an incestuous liaison or an adulterous liaison by a married woman. (This is not necessarily the same definition as a bastard by other societies, as it does not include a child of an unmarried woman.) As a mamzer is excluded from the assembly, () the Talmud forbids a marriage by an ordinary Jew to a mamzer. However, a mamzer may marry a convert or another mamzer, though their child would also be considered a mamzer.\n\nJewish tradition also forbids marriage to a man who has been forcibly emasculated; the Greek term \"spadon\" (; Latin: \"spado\") which is used to refer to such people, is used in the Septuagint to denote certain foreign political officials (resembling the meaning of \"eunuch\"). The Jewish prohibition does not include men who were born without visible testicles (conditions including cryptorchidism), or without a visible penis (conditions including hermaphroditism). There is dispute, even in traditional Judaism, about whether this prohibited group of men should include those who have become, at some point since their birth, emasculated as the result of a disease.\n\nIsraelite priests (kohanim) are not allowed to marry:\n\n\nSome of these prohibitions are biblical, and some are rabbinical.\n\nThe Kohen Gadol (high priest) must also not marry a widow (Lev. 21:14). Sexual relations with a widow are also forbidden (Lev. 21:14). He is required to marry a virgin maiden (Lev. 21:13). However, if he was married to a woman otherwise permitted to a kohen, and was then elevated to the high priesthood, he may remain married to her.\n\nOrthodox Judaism interprets () as forbidding men from lying with other men in the manner in which they would with a woman, and calls it an abomination. ( specifically prohibits such relationships with one's father or uncle.)\n\nThere are three reasons rabbis give for men lying with other men being prohibited in Jewish law:\n\nThere is no prohibition in the Torah against sexual intercourse between two women, but rabbinic law has prohibited it as an extension of the \"activities of (ancient) Egypt\" (see ). However, it is not considered adultery, and does not prohibit the woman to a kohen.\n\nConservative Judaism's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards has validated different approaches to homosexuality and bisexuality, with one opinion being like the Orthodox position in many respects, and another opinion permitting many forms of homosexual sex and relationships, while continuing to regard anal intercourse between men as prohibited.\n\nIn 2012, the American branch of Conservative Judaism devised a commitment ceremony for same-sex couples, though not defined as kiddushin. In 2016, the rabbis of the American branch of Conservative Judaism passed a resolution supporting transgender rights.\n\nIn 2004, the Society for Humanistic Judaism issued a resolution supporting \"the legal recognition of marriage and divorce between adults of the same sex\", and affirming \"the value of marriage between any two committed adults with the sense of obligations, responsibilities, and consequences thereof\".\n\nReform Judaism interprets Leviticus 18:22 as forbidding men from using sex as a form of ownership over men. Reform Jewish authors have revisited the Leviticus text, and ask why the text mentions that one should not lie with a man \"as with a woman\". If it is to be assumed that the Torah does not waste words, the authors ask why the Torah includes this extra clause. Most Reform Jews suggest that since intercourse involved possession (one of the ways in which a man \"acquired\" a wife was to have intercourse with her), similar to the Christian theology of using sex to \"consummate\" a marriage, it was abhorrent that a man might acquire another man - it is not the act of homosexual intercourse itself which is abhorrent, but using this act to acquire another man and therefore confuse the gender boundary.\n\nMen and women are forbidden from engaging in bestiality. () It is considered an abomination according to the Torah.\n\nRather than being seen as merely a literary device to quickly describe the populating of the earth, the biblical instruction to \"go forth and multiply\" was interpreted by the classical rabbis to mean that it was the duty of every male Jew to marry as soon as possible. Several Talmudic rabbis urged that children should be married as soon as they had reached the average age of puberty, which was deemed to occur at 14 years of age; however, it was also strictly forbidden, by classical rabbinical literature, for parents to allow their children to marry before the children had reached this age. Despite the young threshold for marriage, marriages with a large age gap between the spouses (e. g., between a young man and an old woman) were thoroughly opposed by the classical rabbis\n\nThe classical rabbis saw 18 as the ideal age to become married, and anyone unmarried after the age of twenty was said to have been cursed by God; rabbinical courts frequently tried to compel an individual to marry, if they had passed the age of twenty without marriage. Nevertheless, the classical rabbis viewed study of the Torah as a valid reason for remaining unmarried, although they were only rarely willing to regard life-long celibacy favourably. Since the classical rabbis viewed marriage as a duty deriving from the instruction to \"go forth and multiply\", they also believed that the duty to marry ended once the husband had fathered both a son and a daughter; despite this, they also argued that no man should live without a wife even after he has several children.\n\nChildren, however, were not regarded as old enough to make an informed decision, and so could not consent to marriage themselves, although marriage to a female child was still permissible if her father consented, whether she agreed to it or not; if the father was dead, such consent could be given by her mother, or her brothers, but in this latter case, the girl could annul the marriage when she reached the \"standard\" age of puberty (12), if she wished.\n\nThe mentally handicapped, and deaf-mutes, were also regarded, by traditional Jewish law, as being unable to give their consent; indeed, marriage to such people was forbidden. However, the rabbis allowed deaf-mutes to marry each other.\n\n"}

This was recited by him in 1506 or 1508 at the revered Jagannath Temple, Puri during his journey (called \"udaasi\") to east India. This arti is sung (not performed with platter & lamps etc.) daily after recitation of Rehraas Sahib & Ardās at the Harmandir Sahib, Amritsar.\nFamous saint poet of India Rabindranath Tagore was once asked by Balraj Sahni, who used to teach at Santiniketan then, that the way he has written the National Anthem of India, why doesn't he write one for the world? He replied that it has already been written. It was written in 16th Century by Guru Nanak,and this was sung by Guru Nanak as Arati at Jagannath puri to the lord(the omnipresent God).\n\nGuru Nanak Dev has imagined the entire universe decorated as a prayer platter on the altar of the almighty. The starting verses of the aarti are as follows :\n\nGagan mein thaal, rav chand deepak bane,\ntaarka mandal janak moti\ndhoop malay aan lao, pawan chavro kare\nsagal ban raai phulant jyoti\nkaisi aarti hoye, bhavkhandana teri aarti.\n\nanhat sabad bajant bheri\nkaisi aarti hoye, bhavkhandana teri aarti.\n\nMeans - The sky is the prayer-platter, the sun and the moon are the lamps, the stars and the constellations are the pearls and jewels.

{"id": "3698410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3698410", "title": "Incidents during the Hajj", "text": "Incidents during the Hajj\n\nThere have been incidents during the Hajj', the Muslim pilgrimage to the city of Mecca, that have caused loss of life. Every follower of Islam is required to visit Mecca during the Hajj at least once in his or her lifetime, if able to do so; the pilgrimage is one of the Five Pillars of Islam. During the month of the Hajj, Mecca must cope with as many as three million pilgrims.\n\nPlane travel makes Mecca and the Hajj more accessible to pilgrims from all over the world. As a consequence, the Hajj has become increasingly crowded. City officials are required to control large crowds and provide food, shelter, sanitation, and emergency services for millions. However, it has not always been possible to prevent incidents.\n\nSometimes the dense, surging troupes, trekking from one station of the pilgrimage to the next, cause a stampede, or more precisely, a progressive troupe collapse. At densities above 6 or 7 persons per square meter, individuals cannot move, groups are swept along in waves, individuals jostle to find breath and to avoid falling and being trampled, and hundreds of deaths can occur as a result. The stoning of the devil (\"ramī aj-jamarāt\") ceremony is particularly crowded and dangerous. Pilgrims ritualistically throw pebbles at three walls (formerly pillars) which represent the three places where the Quran describes how the devil tempted Abraham. It is one of a series of ritual acts that must be performed in the Hajj.\n\nSome notable incidents include:\n\n\n\n\nMingling of visitors from many countries, some of which have poor health care systems still plagued by preventable infectious diseases, can lead to the spread of epidemics. If an outbreak were to occur on the road to Mecca, pilgrims could exacerbate the problem when they returned home and passed their infection on to others. This was more of a problem in the past. One such disease, which has prompted response from the Saudi government, is meningitis as it became a primary concern after an international outbreak following the Hajj in 1987. Due to post-Hajj outbreaks globally of certain types of meningitis in previous years, it is now a visa requirement to be immunised with the ACW135Y vaccine before arrival. Every year, the Saudi government publishes a list of required vaccines for pilgrims, which for 2010 also included yellow fever, polio, and influenza.\n\n, the Saudi government asked \"elderly and chronically ill Muslims to avoid the hajj this year\" and restricted the numbers of people allowed into the country due to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Although MERS-CoV was not detected among pilgrims, this does not rule out risk of the disease at Hajj. The disease, though, is only mildly contagious.\n\nIn 1905 the El Tor strain of cholera was discovered in six pilgrims returning from Hajj at the El-Tor quarantine camp in Egypt.\n\nA concrete multi-story building located in Mecca close to the Grand Mosque collapsed on January 5, 2006. The building, the Al-Ghaza Hotel, is said to have housed a restaurant, a convenience store, and a hotel. The hotel was reported to have been housing pilgrims to the 2006 Hajj. It is not clear how many pilgrims were in the hotel at the time of the collapse. As of the latest reports, the death toll was 76 and the number of injured was 64.\n\nA crane fell in the grand mosque on September 11, 2015, ten days before Hajj, causing 118 deaths and 394 injuries.\n\nOf the millions of pilgrims each year, many are elderly, and some die of their illnesses, exacerbated in some cases by the heat and exertion.\n\nOf late, pickpocketing has created numerous problems for Hajj pilgrims. According to the Save Madina Foundation, 321 were victims of pickpocketing during Hajj in 2010.\n\nFemale pilgrims have spoken up about sexual abuse experienced on the Hajj through a movement called the Mosque Me Too movement. Using the hashtag #MosqueMeToo, which stems from the Me Too movement which used the hashtag #MeToo, Muslim women have shared their experiences online about sexual abuse in Mecca.\n\nCritics say that the Saudi government should have done more to prevent such tragedies. The Saudi government insists that any such mass gatherings are inherently dangerous and difficult to handle, and that they have taken a number of steps to prevent the problems. The fatalities in the largest tragedy in September 2015 are alleged to have been downplayed by the Saudis by as many as 1,700.\n\nOne of the biggest steps, which is also controversial, is a new system of registrations, passports, and travel visas to control the flow of pilgrims. This system is designed to encourage and accommodate first-time visitors to Mecca, while restricting repeat visits. Pilgrims who have the means and desire to perform the Hajj several times have protested what they see as discrimination, but the Hajj Commission has stated that they see no alternative if further tragedies are to be prevented.\n\nFollowing the 2004 stampede, Saudi authorities embarked on major construction work in and around the Jamaraat Bridge area. Additional accessways, footbridges, and emergency exits were built, and the three cylindrical pillars were replaced with concrete walls to enable more pilgrims simultaneous access to them without the jostling and fighting for position of recent years. The government has also announced a multimillion-dollar project to expand the bridge to five levels; the project is planned for completion in time for the 1427 AH (Dec. 2006 – Jan. 2007) Hajj.\nFollowing the 2006 incident, the Jamaraat Bridge and the pillars representing Satan were demolished and reconstructed. A wider, multi-level bridge was built, and massive columns replaced the pillars themselves. Now, each level of the bridge allows easier and safer access to the columns representing Satan. In addition, the stoning ceremony must be carried out according to pre-determined schedules to prevent over-crowding and the attendant risks. The Jamaraat basin has been expanded from its current circular shape into an oval to allow better access to the pillars. The new arrangements provide for separate access and departure routes.\nHowever, a security breakdown is mentioned as cause for the 2015 stampede. A group of pilgrims who had cast their own stones and were returning to their camp, instead of taking the route designated for returning pilgrims, they took the route meant for those who were coming and crossed the other group of pilgrims heading straight to the jamaraat.\n\n"}

{"id": "9368161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9368161", "title": "Kala pani (taboo)", "text": "Kala pani (taboo)\n\nin Hindu culture, Kala Pani or Kalapani, meaning \"Black Water\", refers to a past proscription of crossing the ocean. According to this mindset, crossing the seas to foreign lands causes the loss of one's social respectability, as well as the putrefaction of one’s cultural character and posterity.\n\nThe offense of crossing the sea is also known as \"Samudrolanghana\" or \"Sagarollanghana\". The Dharma Sutra of Baudhayana (II.1.2.2) lists sea voyages as first of the offences that cause the loss of varna. The Dharma Sutra suggests a person can wipe away this offense in three years by eating little at every fourth meal time; bathing at dawn, noon and dusk; standing during the day; and seated during the night.\n\nThe reasons behind the proscription include the inability to carry out the daily rituals of traditional Hindu life and the sin of contact with the characterless, uncivilized mleccha creatures of the foreign lands. An associated notion was that crossing the ocean entailed the end of the reincarnation cycle, as the traveler was cut off from the regenerating waters of the Ganges. Such voyages also meant breaking family and social ties. In another respect, the inhabitants of the land beyond the \"black water\" were \"hougli\"s, bad-spirited and monstrous swines, as well. The mleccha people were thought to have been spawned by immoral reprobates and blasphemously held religious belief in \"nāstika\", albeit in different forms. They were thought to have rejected the Vedas and have ceased to worship the divine Vedic God in favor of concocted religions and irreligions, with contemptible manners of reverence. Their societies were immoral and built on deceit, subjugation, and corruption. Therefore, it was thought that true Hindus should not come under their influence or embrace their beliefs, as they will be just as deserving of contempt as a mleccha.\n\nDuring the Portuguese Age of exploration, Portuguese sailors noted that Hindus were reluctant to engage in maritime trade due to the kala pani proscription. In the eighteenth century, the banias of North India even considered the crossing of the Indus River at Attock to be prohibited, and underwent purification rituals upon their return. However, not all Hindus adhered to the proscription, so as to gain monetary wealth. For instance, Hindu merchants were present in Burma, Muscat, and other places around Asia and Africa, as well as Australia.\n\nThe East India Company recruited several upper-caste soldiers, and adapted its military practices to the requirements of their religious rituals. Consequently, the overseas service, considered polluting to their caste, was not required of them.\n\nDuring the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824–26), the Bengal Army was ordered to go to Chittagong. Since no bullock carts were available and since sea voyage was a taboo, the Indian soldiers were asked to march to Chittagong by land. The soldiers were concerned about the difficulty involved in a land march, and were also afraid that their superiors might force them to take a sea voyage if the march failed. As a result of these fears, the 47th Regiment refused to march. This resulted in a mutiny on 2 November 1824 at Barrackpore.\n\nThe General Services Enlistment Act of 1856 required the new recruits to serve overseas if asked. The serving high-caste sepoys were fearful that this requirement would be eventually extended to them. Thus, the Hindu soldiers viewed the Act as a potential threat to their faith. The resulting discontent was one of the causes of the Indian rebellion of 1857.\nCellular Jail, the British Indian prison on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands was known as Kala Pani: an incarceration in this jail threatened the convicts with the loss of caste and the resulting social exclusion.\n\nWhen slavery was abolished in British colonies (such as Mauritius in 1834), the authorities looked for indentured labor to replace the slaves who had been emancipated. The emissaries sent to India for this purpose were astute in attracting so-called \"coolies\" to the countries such as South Africa, Mauritius, Fiji and the Caribbean that requiring cheap labor, which were often presented as \"promised lands.\" But many prospective candidates for the distant colonies expressed their fears of crossing the Kala Pani. So the British often employed a stratagem to dispel the doubts of the indentured: they placed water from the Ganges in large cauldrons on the ships, to ensure the continuity of reincarnation beyond the Kala Pani. The sea voyage was then seen as less fearsome.\n\nThe Kala Pani theme features prominently in the Indo-Caribbean history, and has been elaborately discussed in the writings of V. S. Naipaul. Mauritian poet and critic Khal Torabully, who is partly of Indo-Mauritian descent, describes the Kala Pani as a source not only of the dissolution of identity, but also of beauty and reconstruction, leading to what he terms a \"coral imaginary.\"\n\nThe Tirupati Temple does not allow a priest who has crossed the seas to enter the temple's sanctum sanctorum.\n\nIn 2007, the ascension of Sugunendra Tirtha to the Udupi Krishna Temple was opposed by some seers, because he had visited foreign countries, thus committing the offence of \"saagarolanga\" (crossing the sea). In 2008, a court verdict formally allowed his ascension. In 2012, both he and his opponent Vishwesha Teertha announced fasts to pressure each other on the issue.\n\nVishnunarayanan Namboothiri, a noted poet who served as a priest at the Sreevallabha Temple, was not allowed to enter the temple after he returned from an overseas trip to London. The temple authorities, led by the thantri (chief priest), asked him to go a thorough cleansing, penance and \"punaravrodha\" (reinstallation) before he would be allowed in again. Namboothiri was asked to purify himself by reciting the Gayatri Mantra 1008 times, which he refused to do. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh supported him, calling the taboo an \"outdated ritual\". The Travancore Devaswom Board also supported him, and fired two of its officials for refusing to his reinstatement. After the board served the thantri a show-cause notice, Namboothiri was allowed back after purification by sprinkling of holy water (theertham).\n\n"}

Pope-elect Stephen was considered legitimate under the name \"Stephen II\" until the 1961 edition, when his name was erased.

He attempts to show how the curtailing of democracy and freedom of speech have caused those countries to collapse. He further draws a distinction between Islam and its current practises, and offers his perspective that current practises of Muslims are not in vein with the true meaning of Islam with that being the underlying cause for the collapse of those countries.\n\nThe book takes pains to stress that many practises that define Islam on the world stage like stringent laws, cruel punishments and irrational beliefs cannot be found in the Quran. Syed Akbar Ali then proceeds to show that many of these extra Quranic beliefs and practises which have brought about the downfall of the Muslims are actually taken from the Bible.\n\nIn the Malaysian context, his book also exposes a masquerade whereby certain 'Islamic' laws pertaining to divorce are actually a reworded version of English Law taken from the Marriage and Divorce Act - a left over of British colonialism. The book also dismisses 'Islamic banking' as 'Arabic banking' i.e. conventional banking with Arabic prefixes attached for camouflage.\n\nSyed Akbar Ali (49 years' old) is well known among the Malaysian intelligentsia, especially among its Muslim intellectuals. A graduate of an American university who developed a career in banking, Syed was also an often controversial newspaper columnist - pushing the envelope on free and unfettered discussion on religious and political issues in Malaysia.\n\nHis debut book \"To Digress A Little\", published in July 2005, stirred much discussion in Malaysia for its frank and honest appraisal of Malaysia's affirmative action policies which it claims have now outlived their usefulness.\n\n"}

{"id": "11414968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11414968", "title": "Military career of L. Ron Hubbard", "text": "Military career of L. Ron Hubbard\n\nThe military career of L. Ron Hubbard saw the future founder of Scientology serving in the United States Armed Forces as a member of the Marine Corps Reserve and, between 1941–50, the Navy Reserve. He saw active service between 1941–45, during World War II, as a naval Lieutenant (junior grade) and later as a Lieutenant. After the war he was mustered out of active service and resigned his commission in 1950.\n\nAs with many other aspects of L. Ron Hubbard's life, accounts of his military career are much disputed. His account of his military service later formed a major element of his public persona, as depicted by his Scientologist followers. The Church of Scientology presents Hubbard as a \"much-decorated war hero who commanded a corvette and during hostilities was crippled and wounded.\" According to Scientology publications, he served as a \"Commodore of Corvette squadrons\" in \"all five theaters of World War II\" and was awarded \"twenty-one medals and palms\" for his service. He was \"severely wounded and was taken crippled and blinded\" to a military hospital, where he \"worked his way back to fitness, strength and full perception in less than two years, using only what he knew and could determine about Man and his relationship to the universe.\"\n\nHowever, his official Navy service records indicate that \"his military performance was, at times, substandard\", that he was only awarded a handful of campaign medals and that he was never injured or wounded in combat and was never awarded a Purple Heart. Most of his military service was spent ashore in the continental United States on administrative or training duties. He briefly commanded two anti-submarine vessels, the USS \"YP-422\" and USS \"PC-815\", in coastal waters off Massachusetts, Oregon and California in 1942 and 1943 respectively. He was removed from command of both vessels and rated by his superiors as being unsuitable for independent duties and \"lacking in the essential qualities of judgment, leadership and cooperation\". Although Hubbard asserted that he had attacked and crippled or sunk two Japanese submarines off Oregon while in command of the USS \"PC-815\", his claim was rejected by the commander of the Northwest Sea Frontier after a subsequent investigation. He was hospitalized for the last seven months of his active service, not with injuries but with an acute duodenal ulcer.\n\nThe Church of Scientology rejects the official record and insists that Hubbard had a \"second\" set of records that the U.S. Navy has concealed. According to the Church's chief spokesman, if it was true that Hubbard had not been injured, \"the injuries that he handled by the use of Dianetics procedures were never handled, because they were injuries that never existed; therefore, Dianetics is based on a lie; therefore, Scientology is based on a lie.\"\n\nHubbard's first military service was with the Montana Army National Guard, which he joined at the age of 16 in October 1927 while still at school, falsely stating that his age was 18. Enlisting at the State Armory in his home town of Helena, Montana, he served as a private in the Headquarters Company of 163rd Infantry. In May 1930, at the age of 19, he joined the Marine Corps Reserve 20th Regiment, a training unit connected with George Washington University where he was a student from 1930–32.\n\nHubbard attributed his service in the regiment to his need for \"a little recreation. Life was dull. Fellow came up to me and he says, 'The Marine Reserves are organizing a twentieth regiment. Why don't you come down?'\" He made the dubious claim of being rapidly promoted to the rank of First Sergeant; Hubbard later explained his unusually rapid promotion as being due to his unit being newly formed and his superiors being unable to \"find anyone else who could drill.\" He stated that he was rated 'excellent' for military efficiency, obedience and sobriety. On October 22, 1931, Hubbard received an honorable discharge along with the annotation \"not to be re-enlisted.\"\n\nHubbard joined the United States Navy during the summer of 1941, a few months before the United States entered the Second World War. He applied in March 1941 and was commissioned as a lieutenant, junior grade in the Naval Reserve on July 19, 1941. Hubbard was called to active duty in November. He specifically volunteered for \"Special Service (intelligence duties)\", an assignation recorded on his commission papers. He spent only a brief time in this nominal role with the Office of Naval Intelligence. After four months working in public relations and at the US Hydrographic Office, he spent three weeks at the Third Naval District in New York training for the role of Intelligence Officer.\n\nHubbard's training was curtailed by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and on December 18 he was sent to the Philippines via Australia. He was put ashore in Brisbane in January 1942 when his ship was re-routed. He was ordered back to the United States aboard the transport vessel USS \"Chaumont\" the following month at the instigation of the US Naval Attaché to Australia, who cabled Washington to complain:\n\nHubbard and the Church of Scientology presented a number of different accounts of his time in the western Pacific. In 1963, Hubbard told Australian journalists that he had been \"the only anti-aircraft battery in Australia in 1941–42... There was me and a Thompson submachine gun... I was a mail officer and I was replaced, I think, by a Captain, a couple of commanders and about 15 junior officers.\" Hubbard stated on another occasion that he had been \"one of the first officers back from the upper battle areas\" and that he had \"sent on my own authority, four cargo ships loaded to the gunwales with machine gun ammunition, rifle ammunition and quinine up to MacArthur.\" When \"Melbourne found out ... there were enough troops in the area so the danger was over, so I went home. I wrote myself some orders and reported back to the US.\" According to the Church of Scientology, Hubbard was landed on the island of Java \"in the closing days of February 1942\" to search for \"stockpiled weapons and fast, shallow-draft vessels.\" He was cut off by invading Japanese \"and was only able to escape the island after scrambling into a rubber raft and paddling out to meet an Australian destroyer.\" Another Church of Scientology account describes Hubbard as \"Senior Officer Present Ashore in Brisbane, Australia\" and asserts that \"his duties included counter-intelligence and the organization of relief for beleaguered American forces on Bataan. It was in this latter capacity that he eventually saw action on the island of Java, and only eluded capture through a daring escape on a raft. In a 1956 lecture to Scientologists, Hubbard said:\n\nIn another lecture of the same year, Hubbard provided an alternative version of his return to the United States:\n\nThe US Navy's files do not record Hubbard spending any time on Java and do not show any evidence of wounds or injuries sustained in combat.\n\nHubbard was posted to the Office of the Cable Censor in New York City after returning to the US at the end of March 1942. As the office had recently ceased to be an organ of Naval Intelligence, his status was amended to deck officer. He was also promoted (as part of a batch of other officers of the same grade) on June 15, 1942 to lieutenant, senior grade, the highest rank he was to hold during his active service.\n\nIn June 1942 he requested that he be assigned to sea duty in the Caribbean; he was sent instead to the shipyard of George Lawley & Son of Neponset, Massachusetts, where the fishing trawler MV \"Mist\" was being converted for military use as a naval yard patrol (YP) vessel. The navy commandeered numerous fishing vessels and redesignated them as YP boats, tasked with defending coastal waters against enemy submarines and delivering food and equipment to military personnel offshore; they were particularly prized for having refrigeration units. The vessel was commissioned as the USS \"YP-422\" on July 28, 1942, having been refitted as a freighter armed with a 3-inch deck gun and two .30-caliber machine guns. In August, the \"YP-422\" put to sea from the Boston Navy Yard to carry out a 27-hour training exercise.\n\nHowever, Hubbard fell out with a senior officer at the shipyard and sent a critical memorandum to the Vice-Chief of Naval Operations (VCNO) in Washington, D.C. The Commandant of the Navy Yard responded on 25 September 1942 by informing the VCNO that, in his view, Hubbard was \"not temperamentally fitted for independent command\" and requesting that Hubbard be removed and ordered to \"other duty under immediate supervision of a more senior officer.\" Hubbard duly lost his command on October 1, 1942 and was ordered to New York, ending his service in the Atlantic.\n\nVarious accounts of Hubbard's service in the North Atlantic have been put forward by the Church of Scientology and Hubbard himself. The Church of Scientology states in one publication that Hubbard \"took command of an antisubmarine escort vessel with Atlantic convoys\". In a 1954 lecture, Hubbard asserted that he had been sent \"to Boston in the very early part of the war to take command of a corvette\" and had been given a crew made up of convicts from the Portsmouth Naval Prison. Hubbard stated in another lecture that he had been posted aboard \"corvettes, North Atlantic. And I went on fighting submarines in the North Atlantic and doing other things and so on. And I finally got a set of orders for the ship. By that time I had the squadron.\"\n\nBiographical accounts published by the Church of Scientology have described Hubbard as commanding the \"Fourth British Corvette Squadron\" and Hubbard himself stated that he \"was running British corvettes during the war\". A biographical interview with Hubbard published in 1956 speaks of him commanding \"the former British corvette, the \"Mist\"\". (The only British naval vessel named \"Mist\" was an Admiralty drifter, one of a number of small wooden vessels constructed for the Royal Navy in 1918.) Hubbard also asserted that he had sustained wounds \"aboard a corvette in the North Atlantic\". A biographical profile published in 2008 by the Scientology-related imprint Galaxy Press asserts that Hubbard \"served with distinction in four theaters and was highly decorated for commanding corvettes in the North Pacific. He was also grievously wounded in combat [and] lost many a close friend and colleague ...\"\n\nIn November 1942, Hubbard was sent to the Submarine Chaser Training Center in Miami, Florida for training on submarine chaser vessels. He subsequently undertook a ten-day anti-submarine warfare training course at the Fleet Sound School in Key West and on January 17, 1943 he was posted to the Albina Engine & Machine Works in Portland, Oregon, where he was to take command of the subchaser USS \"PC-815\" when she was commissioned.\n\nWhen Hubbard arrived in Portland, the USS \"PC-815\" was in the last stages of its construction. The ship, a 173 ft (53 m) steel-hulled subchaser of the \"PC-461\" class, had been laid down on October 10, 1942 at the Albina shipworks. She was commissioned on April 21, 1943 with Hubbard in command and Lt (jg) Thomas Moulton, an officer with whom he had studied in Florida, as the ship's executive officer. The ship left Portland on May 18 to travel down the Columbia River to Astoria, Oregon, where she took on ammunition. After participating for a day in an air-sea rescue operation, USS \"PC-815\" was ordered to sail to San Diego to commence its shakedown cruise.\n\nIn the early hours of May 19, \"PC-815's\" sonar detected what the crew believed to be an enemy submarine off Cape Lookout, about ten to twelve miles offshore. Over the next two and a half days, Hubbard ordered his crew to fire a total of 35 depth charges and a number of gun rounds to target what Hubbard believed to be two Imperial Japanese Navy submarines. The \"PC-815\" was joined by the US Navy blimps \"K-39\" and \"K-33\", the US Coast Guard patrol boats \"Bonham\" and \"78302\" and the subchasers USS \"SC-536\" and USS \"SC-537\" to assist it in the search for the suspected enemy vessels. Hubbard was given temporary command of the vessels on the afternoon of May 19. The larger subchaser \"PC-778\" also joined the submarine search, though it found no indication of submarines and its commander was subsequently castigated by Hubbard for his refusal to lay its own larger stock of depth charges or resupply the \"PC-815\".\n\nHubbard stated in his eighteen-page after-action report that he had intended to force the submarine to surface so that it could be attacked by the surface vessels' guns. He reported that his vessel had seen oil on the surface, though the \"PC-815\" took no samples, and asserted that the blimps had seen air bubbles, oil and a periscope, though the blimps' own reports did not corroborate this. No wreckage was seen, despite the heavy depth-charging. The \"PC-815\" sustained some minor damage and three crew were injured during the incident when the ship's radio antenna was accidentally hit by gunfire. At midnight on 21 May, with depth charges exhausted and the presence of a submarine still unconfirmed by any other ship, \"PC-815\" was ordered back to Astoria.\n\nThe incident attracted the attention of the naval high command, as there had been a verified Japanese submarine attack against Fort Stevens about 50 miles further north in June 1942 and there had been an invasion scare in southern California earlier in 1942. Hubbard claimed to have \"definitely sunk, beyond doubt\" one submarine and critically damaged another. His view was not shared by his superiors. After reviewing the action reports and interviewing Hubbard and the other commanders present, Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher noted: \"An analysis of all reports convinces me that there was no submarine in the area. Lieutenant Commander Sullivan states that he was unable to obtain any evidence of a submarine except one bubble of air which is unexplained except by turbulence of water due to a depth charge explosion. The commanding officers of all ships except the \"PC-815\" state they had no evidence of a submarine and do not think a submarine was in the area.\" Fletcher also noted that there was a \"known magnetic deposit in the area in which depth charges were dropped.\" The clear implication was that Hubbard had been targeting the deposit all along.\n\nHubbard nonetheless continued to believe that he had sunk at least one Japanese submarine. Years later, in 1956, he told Scientologists:\n\nIn another lecture, he commented:\n\nAfter the war, the British Admiralty and the US Navy analysed the captured records of the Japanese navy to account for all of its vessels. Their reports do not list any Japanese submarine losses off the coast of the contiguous United States during the whole of the war. According to military records, the \"I-76\" was destroyed off Buka Island in the western Pacific by USS \"Franks\", USS \"Haggard\" and USS \"Johnston\" on 16 May 1944. Hubbard's crew however, who were very loyal to him, shared his conviction that they had engaged an enemy submarine. His second-in-command, Thomas Moulton, later asserted that the Navy had hushed up the incident, fearing that the presence of Japanese submarines so close to the Pacific coast might cause panic.\n\nFollowing its return to Astoria, the USS \"PC-815\" was ordered to escort a new aircraft carrier to San Diego, where the subchaser was to participate in exercises. On June 28, 1943, Hubbard ordered his crew to fire four shells from the ship's 3-inch gun and a number of rifle and pistol shots in the direction of the Coronado Islands, off which the ship anchored for the night. He did not realize that the islands belonged to Mexico, an ally, nor that he had taken the USS \"PC-815\" into Mexican territorial waters. The islands were garrisoned by Mexican Navy personnel during the war. The Mexican government complained and two days later, Hubbard found himself before a naval Board of Investigation in San Diego. He was found to have disregarded orders by carrying out an unsanctioned gunnery practice and violating Mexican waters. He was reprimanded and removed from command, effective July 7. Rear Admiral Frank A. Braisted commented, in a fitness report written shortly after the Coronado incident, that he \"consider[ed] this officer lacking in the essential qualities of judgment, leadership and cooperation. He acts without forethought as to probable results. He is believed to have been sincere in his efforts to make his ship efficient and ready. Not considered qualified for command or promotion at this time. Recommend duty on a large vessel where he can be properly supervised.\"\n\nOn the same day that Hubbard was sent a formal letter of admonition, he reported sick with complaints of epigastric pains and possible malaria. After 77 days on the sick list, it was finally determined that he was suffering from a duodenal ulcer. In October 1943, he asked to be transferred to landing craft and was sent on a six-week training course at the Naval Small Craft Training Center in San Pedro, California. He was then ordered in December 1943 to join the crew of the USS \"Algol\", an attack cargo ship, to assist with the ship's fitting out and crew training in Portland, Oregon. The vessel was commissioned in July 1944 with Hubbard aboard in the role of Navigation and Training Officer. The next two months were occupied with training exercises off the California coast in preparation for the ship's envisaged departure in September for the western Pacific theater of operations.\n\nHubbard, however, applied instead to undertake a three-month training course in military administration at the School of Military Government, a faculty that had been established on the campus of Princeton University (but was not part of the University itself, although Hubbard later asserted that he had been a Princeton student). His commanding officer approved the detachment and gave Hubbard a generally good fitness report, rating him to be \"of excellent personal and military character\" though he \"is very temperamental and often has his feelings hurt.\" On September 27, a curious incident occurred aboard the USS \"Algol\"; the ship's deck log records that Hubbard reported that he had discovered \"an attempt at sabotage\" consisting of a Coke bottle filled with gasoline with a cloth wick inserted, concealed among the ship's cargo. A few hours later Hubbard was ordered to depart the ship and proceed to Princeton.\n\nIn later years, Hubbard asserted that the 1955 film \"Mister Roberts\" was based on his service aboard the USS \"Algol\" with Henry Fonda's eponymous character being based on Hubbard himself and James Cagney's tyrannical character based on the commander of the \"Algol\". In a February 1956 lecture, Hubbard told Scientologists: \"There was a story made about that vessel [the \"Algol\"], by the way. It was called \"Mister Roberts\". You may have seen this picture or read the book.\" According to a Church of Scientology publication,\n\nGeorge Malko comments that \"this [claim] has never been substantiated\" and notes that the author of the original novel, Thomas Heggen, \"would only say about Roberts: \"He is too good to be true, he is a pure invention.\"\" The novel was reportedly \"loosely based on [Heggen's] service on the USS \"Virgo\"\".\n\nAt the conclusion of his course at the School of Military Government, Hubbard failed to pass his examinations – finishing only mid-way down the class list – and did not qualify for an overseas posting. He was posted in January 1945 to the Naval Civil Affairs Staging Area in Monterey, California for further training but, as he later acknowledged, he became depressed and fell ill with a duodenal ulcer. He reported sick with stomach pains in April 1945 and spent the remainder of the war on the sick list as a patient in Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in Oakland, California. A Church of Scientology account asserts that \"eventual combat wounds would finally preclude him from serving with American occupation forces.\"\n\nIn October 1945, a Naval Board found that he was \"considered physically qualified to perform duty ashore, preferably within the continental United States\" in reflection of his chronic ulcer. He was discharged from the hospital and mustered out of active service on December 6, 1945. He resigned his commission in October 1950. According to the Church of Scientology, he quit because the US Navy had \"attempted to monopolize all his researches and force him to work on a project \"to make man more suggestible\" and when he was unwilling, tried to blackmail him by ordering him back to active duty to perform this function. Having many friends he was able to instantly resign from the Navy and escape this trap.\" Hubbard himself told Scientologists:\n\nAccording to the US Navy, \"There is no evidence on record of an attempt to recall him to active duty.\"\n\nAs the psychologist and computer scientist Christopher Evans has noted, \"One aspect of [Hubbard's] war record that is particularly confused, and again typical of the mixture of glamour and obscurantism which surrounds Hubbard and his past, is the matter of wounds or injuries suffered on active service.\" Hubbard asserted after the war that he had been \"blinded with injured optic nerves, and lame with physical injuries to hip and back... Yet I worked my way back to fitness and strength in less than two years, using only what I knew about Man and his relationship to the universe.\" Accounts published by the Church of Scientology asserted that he had been \"flown home in the late spring of 1942 in the secretary of the Navy's private plane as the first U.S.-returned casualty from the Far East\". A 2006 publication goes further, describing him as \"the first American casualty of South Pacific combat\".\n\nThomas Moulton, Hubbard's executive officer on the USS \"PC-815\", testified in 1984 that Hubbard had said that he had been shot in the Dutch East Indies, and that on another occasion Hubbard had told him that his eyes had been damaged by the flash of a large-caliber gun. Hubbard himself told Scientologists in a taped lecture that he had suffered eye injuries after having had \"a bomb go off in my face.\" He told Robert Heinlein, the science fiction writer, that \"both of his feet had been broken (drumhead-type injury) when his last ship was bombed.\" According to Heinlein, Hubbard said that he \"had had a busy war – sunk four times and wounded again and again\". Hubbard was said to have been \"twice been pronounced dead\" and to have spent a year in a naval hospital which he \"utilized in the study of endocrine substances and protein\". The techniques that he developed \"made possible not only his own recovery from injury, but helped other servicemen to regain their health\". On another occasion, Hubbard said that he had been hospitalized because \"I was utterly exhausted. I'd just been in combat theater after combat theater, you see, with no rest, no nothing between.\"\n\nThis account was challenged by a series of writers and journalists from the mid-1970s onwards. Writing in 1974, Evans noted that the Veterans Administration had confirmed that (even at that late stage in his life) Hubbard \"receives $160 a month in compensation for disabilities incurred during the Second World War. However the conditions listed as being '40% disabling' are: duodenal ulcer, bursitis (right shoulder), arthritis, and blepharoconjunctivitis.\" Evans noted: \"a Navy Department spokesman has stated that 'an examination of Mr Hubbard's record does not reveal any evidence of injuries suffered while in the service of the United States Navy'.\"\n\nSixteen years later, the \"Los Angeles Times\" obtained Hubbard's medical records through the Freedom of Information Act. The records stated that Hubbard had told doctors that he had been \"lamed\" by a chronic hip infection, and that his eye problems were the result of conjunctivitis caused by exposure to \"excessive tropical sunlight\". Hubbard's post-war correspondence with the VA was also included, including letters in which he requested psychiatric treatment to address his \"long periods of moroseness\" and \"suicidal inclinations.\" He continued to complain to the VA about various physical ailments into the 1950s, well after he had founded Dianetics; the \"Times\" noted that, significantly, Hubbard had promised that Dianetics would provide \"a cure for the very ailments that plagued the author himself then and throughout his life, including allergies, arthritis, ulcers and heart problems.\" Other documents on Hubbard's medical file stated that he had injured his back in 1942 after falling off a ship's ladder.\n\nHubbard's war medals have also been an issue of contention. Although the Church of Scientology has stated that Hubbard was \"highly decorated for duties under fire,\" the actual number of decorations said to have been awarded to Hubbard has varied considerably over the years. In a 1968 interview with British journalists, Hubbard showed his visitors sixteen war medals that he claimed to have been awarded. A few months later, the Church of Scientology published a \"Data Sheet on Lafayette Ron Hubbard\" that stated that he had been awarded \"Twenty-one medals and palms\". (The \"Data Sheet\" lists Hubbard as the Commanding Officer (CO) of the USS \"Howland\", however, there has never been a USS \"Howland\" in the history of the United States Navy.)\n\nIn May 1974, the Church asked the Navy Department to supply seventeen medals that he was said to have been awarded, including the Purple Heart and Navy Commendation Medal, many of them with bronze service stars denoting participation in military campaigns or multiple bestowals of the same award. The Navy sent only four medals, noting, \"The records in this Bureau fail to establish Mr. Hubbard's entitlement to the other medals and awards listed in your response.\" Hubbard responded by circulating to Scientologists a photograph of 21 medals and palms that he said he had been awarded and explained that he had actually won 28, but that the missing seven had been awarded to him in secret because the naval high command was embarrassed that he had sunk two Japanese submarines in the United States' \"back yard\". A 1994 biography published by the Church of Scientology states that he was awarded 29 medals and awards.\n\nIn 1990 the Church of Scientology released a document, said to be a copy of Hubbard's official record of service, to support its assertion that Hubbard had been awarded 21 medals and decorations. The Church asserts that Hubbard was awarded a \"Unit Citation which is only awarded by the President to combat units that perform particularly meritorious service.\" Among the other awards listed on the record released by the Church is the British Victory Medal, an award issued for service in the British armed forces in the \"First\" World War and that was never awarded by itself. The Church's document also credits Hubbard with a Purple Heart with a Palm, implying two wounds received in action. However, the U.S. Navy uses gold and silver stars, not a palm, to indicate multiple wounds. The Church has distributed a photograph of medals said to have been won by Hubbard; two of the medals (specifically the National Defense Service Medal and the Armed Forces Reserve Medal) were not even created until after Hubbard left active service.\n\nThe Church's record lists Hubbard as commanding the \"USS \"Mist\"\". Although the USS \"YP-422\" was originally named the \"Mist\" when it was in civilian service, it was never called the USS \"Mist\"; the only 20th century US Navy vessel of that name listed in the \"Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships\" left naval service in 1919, when Hubbard was six years old. It also lists the USS \"Howland\", a vessel that is not listed at all in the \"Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships\". It is signed by \"Howard D. Thompson, Lt. Cmdr.\", who is not listed in the records of commissioned naval officers at that time. Archivist Eric Voelz of the National Personnel Records Center told \"The New Yorker\" that the document is a forgery.\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" commented, and NPR later confirmed, that the US Navy's version of the same record – a DD Form 214 – \"indicates Hubbard received four medals during his Navy career, as well as two marksmanship medals\" and noted \"discrepancies\" with the Scientology version. The four medals that the US Navy's record credits to Hubbard were the American Defense Service Medal, which was awarded to all members of the military in service at the time of the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor; the American Campaign Medal, awarded to all service members who had performed duty in the American Theater of Operations during the war; the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, awarded to all who had served in the Pacific Theater; and the World War II Victory Medal, awarded to all who served during World War II. According to the Department of the Navy, there was \"no record of the additional decorations the church says Hubbard received.\"\n\nChurch officials have argued the Navy's records were \"not only grossly incomplete but perhaps were falsified to conceal Hubbard's secret activities as an intelligence officer.\" In the 1980s the Church turned to L. Fletcher Prouty, a former U.S. Army colonel, who said that Hubbard's records had been falsified to cover up his \"intelligence background\". Prouty, who died in 2001, was a prominent conspiracy theorist best known for advocating John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories and was also associated with the anti-semitic Liberty Lobby group and the Lyndon LaRouche organization.\n\nHubbard's military career has attracted comment from a number of journalists and writers over the years. The claims made by the Church of Scientology were not challenged by some early writers; C.H. Rolph quoted without comment a 1968 Scientology biographical sketch circulated to British Members of Parliament in which Hubbard's war service was summarized, and in 1971 Paulette Cooper described as \"true\" the claim that Hubbard \"was severely injured in the war (and in fact was in a lifeboat for many days, badly injuring his body and his eyes in the hot Pacific sun).\" Others were more skeptical. George Malko attempted to verify Hubbard's \"revealing, anonymously authored, and totally unsubstantiated biography\" in 1970 but reported that \"I was unable to confirm a single one of [Hubbard's] critical claims: that he had been crippled and blind, the nature of his 'discoveries,' and the medical records stating he had 'twice been pronounced dead.'\" His inquiries were frustrated by the Navy's refusal to provide Hubbard's service record \"without the written consent of the person whose records are concerned.\"\n\nInformation later released by the Navy and the Veterans Administration prompted some to express doubts. Christopher Evans commented in 1974 that \"faced with this impressive, if annoyingly undetailed, record it is hard to assess the nature or extent of Hubbard's battle scars in the service of his country\" but noted contradictions between claims of war wounds and the official record. In 1978, the \"Los Angeles Times\" described Hubbard's war record as \"obscure\" and quoted Navy spokesmen stating that Hubbard had not received a Purple Heart and had not been treated for any injuries sustained during his military career, contrary to the statements of the Church of Scientology.\n\nBy 1979, an amateur researcher, Michael Shannon, had gathered \"a mountain of material which included some files that no one else had bothered to get copies of – for example, the log books of the Navy ships that Hubbard had served on, and his father's Navy service file.\" Although Shannon was unable to find a publisher, he sent a hundred-page portfolio of materials, including copies of some of Hubbard's naval and college records, to a number of \"concerned individuals\". His work also found its way to the Church of Scientology's archivist, Gerry Armstrong, who was undertaking a project to research an official authorized biography of L. Ron Hubbard. According to Jon Atack, \"the archive largely confirmed Shannon's material. Armstrong and Shannon reached the same eventual destination from opposed starting points.\" In October 1980, Omar Garrison, a writer who had previously written two books favorable to Scientology, was hired by the Church to write Hubbard's biography based on the materials that Armstrong had collected.\n\nArmstrong became disillusioned and left Scientology at the start of 1982. He was declared a \"Suppressive Person\" (an enemy of Scientology) by the Church. With Garrison's permission, Armstrong made copies of around 100,000 pages from the Hubbard archive and deposited them with attorneys for safe keeping. The Church responded by suing Armstrong for breach of confidence, theft and invasion of privacy. The suit went to trial in a California court in 1984 as \"Church of Scientology of California vs. Gerald Armstrong\". Hubbard's military career was a major focus of the case. Armstrong stated that he had \"amassed approximately two thousand pages of documentation concerning Hubbard's wartime career: what he was doing what vessels he was on, fitness reports and medical and VA disability records. The truth is far different from the public representations.\" Garrison, who had by that time agreed to a settlement with the Church under which his manuscript would never be made public, told the court:\n\nDuring the trial's four weeks of testimony, the court heard evidence from Thomas S. Moulton, Hubbard's second-in-command aboard the USS \"PC-815\". Moulton testified that Hubbard had told him that he had been involved in the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941 and that he had been the only survivor of his destroyer, which had gone down with all hands save himself. The \"submarine battle\" of May 1943 was also described by Moulton and was hailed by a Church of Scientology attorney as \"a new untold chapter to the history of the Pacific conflict during World War II; and new perspectives on the magnitude – and proximity – of Japanese naval operations off the U.S. coast during the war.\" Moulton also testified that Hubbard had told him that he had received combat injuries to his eyes and back. In response, documents contradicting Moulton's (and Hubbard's) account were read into the record by Armstrong's attorney, Michael Flynn.\n\nThe decision, by Judge Paul Breckenridge, found that Armstrong's fears of persecution by the Church were reasonable, and thus his conduct in turning over the documents in his possession to his attorneys was also reasonable. The judge issued a wide-ranging verdict, commenting of Hubbard that \"the evidence portrays a man who has been virtually a pathological liar when it comes to his history, background and achievements.\" A few weeks later, a British judge ruled in a case heard at the Royal Courts of Justice that Hubbard had made a number of \"false claims\" about his military career: \"That he was a much decorated war hero. He was not. That he commanded a corvette squadron. He did not. That he was awarded the Purple Heart, a gallantry decoration for those wounded in action. He was not wounded and was not decorated. That he was crippled and blinded in the war and cured himself with Dianetics techniques. He was not crippled and was not blinded.\" The judge, Mr. Justice Latey, noted: \"There is no dispute about any of this. The evidence is unchallenged.\"\n\nHubbard's military service has subsequently been covered in detail by the British writers Russell Miller (\"Bare-faced Messiah\", 1987) and Jon Atack (\"A Piece of Blue Sky\", 1990), by the \"Los Angeles Times\" in a six-part special report on Scientology published in June 1990, and by Lawrence Wright in \"The New Yorker\" in February 2011 and his book \"Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief\" (2013). The accuracy of Miller's account has been questioned; , writing in 1999, commented that Miller's book had \"definitely exposed some inflated statements about Hubbard's early achievements\" but had also been partly disproved by the Church of Scientology, though he did not state which elements had been disproved.\n\nL. Ron Hubbard's father, Lieutenant Commander Harry Ross Hubbard (1886-1975), was a United States Navy Supply Corps officer who served for over 30 years. His career included service during both world wars.\n\nHe first enlisted in the Navy on September 1, 1904 and served until October 31, 1908. He then re-enlisted during World War I on October 10, 1917 and was commissioned an assistant paymaster (with the rank of ensign) in the Supply Corps on October 16, 1918. He was promoted to lieutenant (junior grade) on November 11, 1919. He was released from active duty on June 28, 1920 and was placed in an inactive status in the Naval Reserve.\n\nHe was commissioned in the Regular Navy and returned to active duty on September 17, 1921. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1922 and lieutenant commander in 1934. Although most Navy officers were promoted rapidly during World War II, Hubbard remained a lieutenant commander for the remainder of his career.\n\nHubbard's career included a number of routine assignments including: assistant paymaster for the submarine tender USS \"Rainbow\" in 1918; supply officer for the aircraft tender USS \"Aroostook\" (1919-1920) (during Hubbard's assignment to \"Aroostook\" she provided support to the historic NC-4 transatlantic flight); assistant supply officer for the battleship USS \"Oklahoma\" (1921-1923); under instruction at the School of Application of the Bureau of Supply and Accounts in Washington, D.C. (1923-1924); disbursing officer at the Puget Sound Navy Yard (1924-1927); officer in charge of the commissary at Naval Station Guam (1927-1929); disbursing officer Naval Hospital, Washington, D.C. (1927-1929); assistant supply officer, Puget Sound Navy Yard (1935-1938); and supply officer of the cruiser USS \"Astoria\" (1938-1941).\n\nDuring World War II, Hubbard served officer in charge of the commissary at Mare Island Navy Yard (1941-1943); supply officer for the destroyer tender USS \"Black Hawk\" (AD-9) (1943–45); and supply officer of Naval Station, Seattle, Washington (1945-1946), after which he retired.\n\nWhile Hubbard was assigned to the destroyer tender \"Black Hawk\" during the last two years of the war, the ship was stationed at Pearl Harbor and Adak, Alaska. This was Hubbard's only service outside the continental United States during the war.\n\nCommander Hubbard remained on active duty until he retired from the Navy in May 1946 at the age of 59, after a total of 32 years and 9 months of service.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4833512", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4833512", "title": "Mu wave", "text": "Mu wave\n\nMu waves, also known as mu rhythms, comb or wicket rhythms, arciform rhythms, or sensorimotor rhythms, are synchronized patterns of electrical activity involving large numbers of neurons, probably of the pyramidal type, in the part of the brain that controls voluntary movement. These patterns as measured by electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), or electrocorticography (ECoG), repeat at a frequency of 7.5–12.5 (and primarily 9–11) Hz, and are most prominent when the body is physically at rest. Unlike the alpha wave, which occurs at a similar frequency over the resting visual cortex at the back of the scalp, the mu wave is found over the motor cortex, in a band approximately from ear to ear. A person suppresses mu wave patterns when he or she performs a motor action or, with practice, when he or she visualizes performing a motor action. This suppression is called desynchronization of the wave because EEG wave forms are caused by large numbers of neurons firing in synchrony. The mu wave is even suppressed when one observes another person performing a motor action or an abstract motion with biological characteristics. Researchers such as V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues have suggested that this is a sign that the mirror neuron system is involved in mu wave suppression, although others disagree.\n\nThe mu wave is of interest to a variety of scholars. Scientists who study neural development are interested in the details of the development of the mu wave in infancy and childhood and its role in learning. Since a group of researchers believe that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is strongly influenced by an altered mirror neuron system and that mu wave suppression is a downstream indication of mirror neuron activity, many of these scientists have kindled a more popular interest in investigating the mu wave in people with ASD. Assorted investigators are also in the process of using mu waves to develop a new technology: the brain-computer interface (BCI). With the emergence of BCI systems, clinicians hope to give the severely physically disabled population new methods of communication and a means to manipulate and navigate their environments.\n\nThe mirror neuron system consists of a class of neurons that was first studied in the 1990s in macaque monkeys. Studies have found sets of neurons that fire when these monkeys perform simple tasks and also when the monkeys view others performing the same simple tasks. This suggests they play a role in mapping others' movements into the brain without actually physically performing the movements. These sets of neurons are called mirror neurons and together make up the mirror neuron system. Mu waves are suppressed when these neurons fire, a phenomenon which allows researchers to study mirror neuron activity in humans. There is evidence that mirror neurons exist in humans as well as in non-human animals. The right fusiform gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule, right anterior parietal cortex, and left inferior frontal gyrus are of particular interest. Some researchers believe that mu wave suppression can be a consequence of mirror neuron activity throughout the brain, and represents a higher-level integrative processing of mirror neuron activity. Tests in both monkeys (using invasive measuring techniques) and humans (using EEG and fMRI) have found that these mirror neurons not only fire during basic motor tasks, but also have components that deal with intention. There is evidence of an important role for mirror neurons in humans, and mu waves may represent a high level coordination of those mirror neurons.\n\nA fruitful conceptualization of mu waves in pediatric use is that mu wave \"suppression\" is a representation of activity going on in the world, and is detectable in the frontal and parietal networks. A resting oscillation becomes suppressed during the observation of sensory information such as sounds or sights, usually within the frontoparietal (motor) cortical region. The mu wave is detectable during infancy as early as four to six months, when the peak frequency the wave reaches can be as low as 5.4 Hz. There is a rapid increase in peak frequency in the first year of life, and by age two frequency typically reaches 7.5 Hz. The peak frequency of the mu wave increases with age until maturation into adulthood, when it reaches its final and stable frequency of 8–13 Hz. These varying frequencies are measured as activity around the central sulcus, within the Rolandic cortex.\n\nMu waves are thought to be indicative of an infant’s developing ability to imitate. This is important because the ability to imitate plays a vital role in the development of motor skills, tool use, and understanding causal information through social interaction. Mimicking is integral in the development of social skills and understanding nonverbal cues. Causal relationships can be made through social learning without requiring experience firsthand. In action execution, mu waves are present in both infants and adults before and after the execution of a motor task and its accompanying desynchronization. While executing a goal-oriented action, however, infants exhibit a higher degree of desynchronization than do adults. Just as with an action execution, during action observation infants’ mu waves not only show a desynchronization, but show a desynchronization greater in degree than the one evidenced in adults. This tendency for changes in degree of desynchronization, rather than actual changes in frequency, becomes the measure for mu wave development throughout adulthood, although the most changes take place during the first year of life. Understanding the mechanisms that are shared between action perception and execution in the earliest years of life has implications for language development. Learning and understanding through social interaction comes from imitating movements as well as vowel sounds. Sharing the experience of attending to an object or event with another person can be a powerful force in the development of language.\n\nAutism is a disorder that is associated with social and communicative deficits. A single cause of autism has yet to be identified, but the mu wave and mirror neuron system have been studied specifically for their role in the disorder. In a typically developing individual, the mirror neuron system responds when he or she either watches someone perform a task or performs the task him- or herself. In individuals with autism, mirror neurons become active (and consequently mu waves are suppressed) only when the individual performs the task him- or herself. This finding has led some scientists, notably V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues, to view autism as disordered understanding of other individuals' intentions and goals due to problems with the mirror neuron system. This deficiency would explain the difficulty people with autism have in communicating with and understanding others. While most studies of the mirror neuron system and mu waves in people with autism have focused on simple motor tasks, some scientists speculate that these tests can be expanded to show that problems with the mirror neuron system underlie overarching cognitive and social deficits.\n\nBased on findings correlating mirror neuron activity and mu wave suppression in individuals with autism as in typically developing individuals, studies have examined both the development of mirror neurons and therapeutic means for stimulating the system. A recent study has found that fMRI activation magnitudes in the inferior frontal gyrus increase with age in people with autism. This finding was not apparent in typically developing individuals. Furthermore, greater activation was associated with greater amounts of eye contact and better social functioning. Scientists believe the inferior frontal gyrus is one of the main neural correlates with the mirror neuron system in humans and is often related to deficits associated with autism. These findings suggest that the mirror neuron system may not be non-functional in individuals with autism, but simply abnormal in its development. This information is significant to the present discussion because mu waves may be integrating different areas of mirror neuron activity in the brain. Other studies have assessed attempts to consciously stimulate the mirror neuron system and suppress mu waves using neurofeedback (a type of biofeedback given through computers that analyze real time recordings of brain activity, in this case EEGs of mu waves). This type of therapy is still in its early phases of implementation for individuals with autism, and has conflicting forecasts for success.\n\nBrain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are a developing technology that clinicians hope will one day bring more independence and agency to the severely physically disabled. Those the technology has the potential to help include people with near-total or total paralysis, such as those with tetraplegia (quadriplegia) or advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); BCIs are intended to help them to communicate or even move objects such as motorized wheelchairs, neuroprostheses, or robotic grasping tools. Few of these technologies are currently in regular use by people with disabilities, but a diverse array are in development at an experimental level. One type of BCI uses event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the mu wave in order to control the computer. This method of monitoring brain activity takes advantage of the fact that when a group of neurons is at rest they tend to fire in synchrony with each other. When a participant is cued to imagine movement (an \"event\"), the resulting desynchronization (the group of neurons that was firing in synchronous waves now firing in complex and individualized patterns) can be reliably detected and analyzed by a computer. Users of such an interface are trained in visualizing movements, typically of the foot, hand, and/or tongue, which are each in different locations on the cortical homunculus and thus distinguishable by an electroencephalograph (EEG) or electrocorticograph (ECoG) recording of electrical activity over the motor cortex. In this method, computers monitor for a typical pattern of mu wave ERD contralateral to the visualized movement combined with event-related synchronization (ERS) in the surrounding tissue. This paired pattern intensifies with training, and the training increasingly takes the form of games, some of which utilize virtual reality. Some researchers have found that the feedback from virtual reality games is particularly effective in giving the user tools to improve control of his or her mu wave patterns. The ERD method can be combined with one or more other methods of monitoring the brain's electrical activity to create hybrid BCIs, which often offer more flexibility than a BCI that uses any single monitoring method.\n\nMu waves have been studied since the 1930s, and are referred to as the wicket rhythm because the rounded EEG waves resemble croquet wickets. In 1950, Henri Gastaut and his coworkers reported desynchronization of these waves not only during active movements of their subjects, but also while the subjects observed actions executed by someone else. These results were later confirmed by additional research groups, including a study using subdural electrode grids in epileptic patients. The latter study showed mu suppression while the patients observed moving body parts in somatic areas of the cortex that corresponded to the body part moved by the actor. Further studies have shown that the mu waves can also be desynchronized by imagining actions and by passively viewing point-light biological motion.\n\n"}

The Munay-Ki is a modern form of transmitting the initiation empowerments of the Q'ero, and are based on the traditional initiation ceremonies of Q'ero shamans. Four Q'ero shamans have come to the United States several times to personally transmit the rites in the past six years, and many initiates have gone to Peru to receive the rites there. These shamans are held in high esteem by the members and trainees of The Four Winds Society.\n\nVilloldo learned and studied the rites of the Inca Shamans with a number of mentors over a period of years living with them in the Andes Mountains of Peru. As he describes in his book Shaman Healer Sage, he traveled for more than ten years with his first mentor Don Antonio Morales throughout the Andes and the Amazon to accumulate and distill the shamanic knowledge of these peoples. From this distilled knowledge of traditional shamanism, Dr. Villoldo gathered and assembled the Munay-Ki as a series of rites to initiate and empower students in their study and practice of shamanic healing. Some of the Munay-Ki rites are direct inclusions of traditional Q'ero initiatory rites: for example the Munay-Ki Day Keeper and Wisdom Keeper rites respectively are anglicized names for the Pampa Mesayok and Alto Mesayok karpay of the Q'ero. \n\nVilloldo writes that the rites derive from the great initiations from the Indus Valley that were brought to the Americas by the first medicine men and women who crossed the Bering Strait from Siberia during the glacial period some 30,000 years ago, and who were known as the Laika, the Earthkeepers of old. \n\nThe Munay-Ki rites are initiations intended to help the person receiving them to become a person of wisdom and power. Like the Q'ero initiations they include, the Munay-Ki are given at the beginning of one's shamanic training in order to guide the student successfully through their studies and development into a healer. \n\nThe authenticity of these rites are disputed however, and some argue that they are totally fabricated and have no relationship with the Q'ero nation. Critics argue that Dr. Villoldo has exploited the Q'ero nation with his teachings in order to make money. His Four Winds Society has become very popular in the United States, but is not without controversy. Some indigenous groups see this as a prime example of cultural appropriation, while followers believe that Dr. Villoldo was given permission by his teachers to share the teachings. This is a prime example of neoshamanism. \n\n"}

The party championed secularism in the Muslim-dominated state, and its electoral and organisational strength was mainly based in East Bengal (also known as East Pakistan, now the independent state of Bangladesh).\n\nThe Pakistan National Congress traces its roots to the Indian National Congress, which was the largest national political party in India. The Indian National Congress, led by Mahatma Gandhi, Vallabhbhai Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru championed secularism, religious tolerance and opposed the Pakistan movement led by the Muslim League. However, ensuing communal conflict led to the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan from Muslim-majority provinces. The religious violence and mass migration as a result of partition significantly reduced the Hindu, Sikh and non-Muslim population of Pakistan. The leaders and activists of the Indian National Congress who continued to live in Pakistan joined with the representatives of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist and Christian communities to form a new political party, the Pakistan National Congress. Although most of them had opposed partition, the members of the new party accepted the state of Pakistan and did not maintain any organisational links with the Indian National Congress.\n\nThe Pakistan National Congress stood for secularism, equality of all religions and citizens and protection of religious and ethnic minorities. The party sought peaceful and friendly relations between Pakistan and India. The party was one of many that opposed the suppression of democracy and civil rights by successive military regimes. The Pakistan National Congress also stood against the growth of Islamic fundamentalism in Pakistani society, politics and government. The party also supported the Bengali language movement in East Bengal.\n\nNational Congress was the only party at the opposition side of the house during the movement. In both Legislative Assembly and in Constituent Assembly they exposed of the logical position of the language demand. In doing so some of the members were called Indian agents and were harassed by the government. Some leaders were also arrested and one of them was killed inside the jail.\n\nWhile partition riots and mass migration had significantly reduced the Hindu and Sikh population in West Pakistan, Hindus still constituted twenty percent of the population of East Bengal (also East Pakistan). Consequently, the PNC's base and organisation were concentrated in that province of Pakistan. In the 1954 elections held for the East Bengal Legislative Assembly, the Pakistan National Congress won 28 seats.\n\nAfter the Bangladeshi War of Independence, the party briefly survived as the Bangladesh National Congress ( \"Bangladesh Jatiya Congress\"). The party stood one candidate, Sree Peter Paul Gomez in the 1973 election for Dacca-25, but did not win the seat. The party was dissolved in 1975 after the formation of the Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League as the sole political party of Bangladesh. It is unknown how long the party survived in West Pakistan.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26530979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26530979", "title": "Nayak caste", "text": "Nayak caste\n\nThe Nayak is a Suryavanshi Rajput clan found in the state of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Orisa, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka in India. The word Nayak means a head of a regiment. This word is derived from the Sanskrit Sena Nayak, which means \"head of a regiment\". The Nayak traces their origin back to Suryavani Rajput.\nNayak is not same or similar to Naik or Nayaka castes. Nayak is separate from Naik or Nayaka castes.\nNayak word is derived from the Sanskrit word Sena Nayak, which means the leader or head of a regiment. The Nayak trace their origin back to Suryavanshi Rajputs or Rajanya Kayasthas. They claim that they used to hold the rank of Nayak in Royal Forces. They were highly regarded for their bravery, in due course they became a powerful group and occupied several forts and jagirs. In fear of their growing power the rulers tried to defame them in various ways. Then Nayak withdrew themselves from the association of the Suryavanshi Rajputs or Rajanya Kayasthas and came out as a separate community. It is said that when Parashuram the great mythical character was killing the Kshatriyas then the Nayak had to conceal their Kshatriya identity. Rajanya is the real word for kshatriyas according to Rig-Veda Purush Sukta. They have several other legends in which they trace their ancestry back to the mythical characters of lnchhbasu. One of the five sons of Surya to one of the wives of Brihaspati who was impregnated by Chandrama to Sangnya, One of the three wives of Surya. They recall their origin at Jatala village whence they migrated to Jaisalmer and hence to the various other parts. They are distributed in the districts of Sri Ganganagar, Churu, Sikar, Nagaur, Jhunjhunu etc. Their spoken language is Marwari. They are conversant with Hindi, Script used is Devnagari. The Nayak have the two divisions of nakh and dudh (clan). There are altogether sixteen nakhs namely Panwar, Solanki, Chauhan, Chalukya, Bhati, Tanwar, Rang-ghad, Bagla, Chandela, Dhol, Sodath, Khinchi, Ran, Gor, Galhot and Rathore.\nEach of the nakh has a number of dudh in it. Bhati have nine dudh. Panwar have seven. Tanwar includes eight. Rathore have nine dudhs. Dudh are namely Malkhot, Potwana, Dhulkia, Kayat, Bokra, Dagla, Sudia, Chanwaria, Chandalia, Boyat, Rojh, Ghoran, Barwasa, Banyal, Goglia, Chaaran, Saarsar, Gagrhia, Arhia etc. Concept of hierarchy is not associated with these divisions. In the traditional varna order they are ranked as Kshatriya.\nCommunity endogamy and nakh and dudh exogamy are the rule. Junior levirate is allowed. Child marriage has been replaced by post-puberty marriage. Selection of match is ﬁnalised with the performance sagai (betrothal). Marriage is solemnized at bride's place. The bride and the groom take phera (circulations of sacred ﬁre). Garuda Brahman performs the job of priest. A feast is arranged by the bride's parents. The consummation of marriage is held at groom's house. Monogamy is the prevalent practice. Polygamy is permissible in case of barrenness of the wife. Bora (toe ring), aonla and pajeb (silver anklet) are the marriage symbols for women. Bride price is paid in cash and in kind. Post-marital residence is patrilocal. Divorce is permitted. Either the spouses can initiate its proceedings. Remarriage is allowed for widow, widower and divorcee. Remarriage of a woman is called nata consisting of only a bief formality. However in case a widower is marrying an unmarried girl than the marriage is solemnised with phera and in detail.\nThe prevalent type of family is extended type followed by nuclear family. The male member holds the authority and decision-making power. In a family the relation between father-in-law and daughter-in-law and that between brother-in-law (husband's elder brother) and sister-in-law (younger brother's wife) is of avoidance. Joking relations exist between elder brother's wife and husband's younger brother and also among elder sister's husband and wife's younger sister. Property is inherited in the male line and male equigeniture is the norm. Authority succeeds from father to the eldest son. Inter-family linkages among the community people are maintained through mutual help and cooperation.\n\nThe women in normal circumstances do not go out for earning. Household work and looking after the children is their main responsibility. They participate in social and religious activities but have no role in socio-political organization of the community. They bring potable water, collect ﬁrewood, in family as well as in society women are subordinate to men.\nAfter delivery. sutak (pollution period) is observed for soa-mahina(five weeks) during which the mother and the baby are kept conﬁned in a room. The pollution period for the family members end with suraj pujan. Name of the child is selected on that day. After five weeks jarhula (tonsure) is done in case of male child. \nAmong the Nayak dead are cremated. The corpse is taken to the samsan (crematorium) on arthi (wooden bier). The widow of the deceased gives up her marriage symbols on the arthi. The corpse is placed on the pyre with its head to the east. Eldest son acts as chief mourner, who lights the pyre. On the third day unburnt bones and ashes are collected which are disposed of at Haridwar. Sutak (death pollution) is observed for twelve days which ends with kriya (death rites). The funeral feast arranged on this day is attended by kins and caste men. The succession rites are performed for the eldest son in the evening.\nThe Nayak by religion are Hindu. Pabuji is their main deity. He is believed to be the incarnation of God. They also worship Gogaji, Ramdevji, Shivji, Kalka (Kali) mata, Nagechi Mate, Bheruji, Karni mata etc. They have kula devi (lineage goddess). Besides, Nagechi is their community goddess. They go to pilgrimage to Runecha (Jaisalmer), Gangaji at Haridwar etc. Gauda Brahman acts as sacred specialist in their life cycle rituals. Holi, Deepavali, Rakshabandhan, Gangaur etc. are their major festivals. The community have the oral tradition of songs and tales. During festivals and in marriage women sing folk songs.\nThe Nayak have traditional linkages with Garuda Brahmans, Dholi, Nai, who offer them priestly and other specialized services. They accept water and cooked food from the all the clean castes and vice versa. But do not accept the same from Sansi, Meghwal, etc. Putative kinship is maintained with whom they have commensal relations. They share water source with other communities in the locality. They have access to schools, temples etc. They use both traditional and modern medicare system. They have favorable attitude towards family planning.

{"id": "413120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=413120", "title": "Oahspe: A New Bible", "text": "Oahspe: A New Bible\n\nOahspe: A New Bible is a book published in 1882, purporting to contain \"new revelations\" from \"...the Embassadors of the angel hosts of heaven prepared and revealed unto man in the name of Jehovih...\" It was produced by an American dentist, John Ballou Newbrough (1828–1891), who reported it to have been written by automatic writing, making it one of a number of 19th-century spiritualist works attributed to that practice. The text defines adherents of the disciplines expounded in \"Oahspe\" as \"Faithists\".\n\n\"Oahspe\" comprises a series of related interior books chronicling earth and its heavenly administrations, as well as setting forth teachings for modern times. Included are over 100 drawings. The title page of \"Oahspe\" describes its contents with these words:\nA New Bible in the Words of Jehovih and His Angel Ambassadors. A Sacred History of the Dominions of the Higher and Lower Heavens on the Earth for the Past Twenty-Four Thousand Years together with a Synopsis of the Cosmogony of the Universe; the Creation of Planets; the Creation of Man; the Unseen Worlds; the Labor and Glory of Gods and Goddesses in the Etherean Heavens; with the New Commandments of Jehovih to Man of the Present Day.\n\n\"Jehovih\", \"The Great Spirit\", \"Ormazd\", \"Egoquim\", \"Agoquim\", \"Eloih\", \"The I Am\", and \"Jehovah\" are some of the names used throughout Oahspe as the name of the Creator.\n\nAccording to Oahspe the Creator is both masculine and feminine. Om is one of the names used to refer to the feminine (mother) aspect. Other references include, \"The All Person\", \"The unseen\" and \"The Everpresent\", \"The All Light\", \"The Highest Light\". God and Lord are titles of office for a person in the spirit realm who began life as mortal/in corporeal form (spirit within a body). The Creator is all and was all and forever will be all; He/She was never born and is beyond all Gods. The Creator is our father and mother, and all that are and were born are our brothers and sisters.\n\n\"Oahspe\" (the word is defined as \"sky, earth (corpor) and spirit. The all; the sum of corporeal and spiritual knowledge as at present\") was published in 1882.\n\nDr. Newbrough had started writing the book in 1880 and stated that the writing was done automatically; he had been a spiritualist since the early 1870s. On at least two occasions Newbrough wrote publicly about how the \"Oahspe\" came about through automatic writing. A \"letter\" published in the \"Banner of Light\" (a 19th-century Spiritualist newspaper), and an \"Addendum\" in the 1882 Edition republished by Raymond A. Palmer in 1972. Both accounts, written in the first person, indicate that Newbrough sat at a (newly invented) typewriter for half an hour each morning at which time his hands would automatically type (without his knowledge of what was being written).) An article in \"The New York Times\" had him explain that, feeling the urge to write, he sat down with pen and paper until a bright light enveloped his fingers and they started writing. Moreover, many of the drawings contain symbols resembling hieroglyphs, presumably drawn. A copy of the \"Banner of Light\" letter accompanied Oahspes published by the Kosmon Press in England (such as it was received in New Zealand in 1895).\n\nThe first presentation of the book took place on 20 October 1882 in Newbrough's house, at 128 West 34th Street in New York City, where he presented the \"new bible,\" \"a large quarto volume of over 900 pages,\" to a group of people. According to the New York Times news article, Newbrough said that the book was not a sacred text \"per se\", but rather a history of religions going back 24,000 years, and that the first publication of the book came about with the financial assistance of a number of unnamed contributors.\n\nThe first (1882 edition) publication, as it was originally presented in 1882, contained various glyphs, whose resemblance to real Egyptian hieroglyphs was attested to by Prof. Thomas A.M. Ward, who claimed to have deciphered the hieroglyphics on the Cleopatra's Needle obelisk in Central Park. Ward was present at \"Oahspe\"s first presentation, as was Dr. Cetliniski, an Oriental scholar, who affirmed that mere mortals could not have produced such a book and that \"supernatural agents\" must have been responsible.\n\nThe first reporter on the book, writing for \"The New York Times\", compared the book's content to a revised fusion of Indian and Semitic religions, and said its style was \"in one place modern, and in another ancient, and the English of the King James version of the Christian Bible is mixed in with the English of today's.\"\n\n\"Oahspe\" emphasized service to others; each person is graded according to service to others. Each individual, group and nation is either in ascension or descension; sooner or later, all ascend, rising in grade. The higher one's grade, the better are the conditions within one's own soul, and the better the place awaiting one in heaven.\n\nAccording to \"Oahspe\", when mortals die their spirits continue to live, regardless of who they worshiped, or even whether they disbelieved in an afterlife. The spirit realm becomes their new home, which is called heaven, and the individual spirit is called an angel. There are unorganized heavens close to or on the earth. Also starting there - and linking to the highest heavens - are the organized heavens. Both types of heavens are accessible to mortals. If a portion of heaven lives in a state of chaos and delights in evil, that portion is called hell.\n\nAn angel must subsist for a season after death somewhere along a continuum of delightful to abysmally wretched conditions. The heavenly place where angels initially live is determined by what their habits were as mortals; as well as by their aspirations and diet. Selfish behavior, low thoughts, or eating animal derived food will place a newborn angel in the lowest level, being on the earth. Evil oriented persons enter heaven into hellish conditions. Nevertheless, all in descension eventually turn around and ascend upward to more delightful places within an organized heaven, whose chief is called God. God is an advanced angel ordained into office for a season.\n\nThe morphologically plural name Elohim, often translated as god-singular in the Old Testament, is not used to mean the Creator throughout the main body of \"Oahspe\"; the singular Hebrew terms \"Jehovih\" (SHD 3069) and \"Eloih\" are used instead.\n\nAccording to \"Oahspe\", the history of humankind is marked by a series of progressions. These lessons come in cycles: advancement followed by recession, being in turn succeeded by other cycles of improvement and regression. Cycles exist within cycles, but one important cycle, used in improving the grade of humanity, is a 3000-year cycle (average), and it is this cycle around which the books in Oahspe are organized.\n\nThe first few books of \"Oahspe\" lay the groundwork for understanding the nature of the work. This merges into a concise history taking the reader up to the present time, the new era. Separate from the history books are a series of books intended to illume for the reader the requirements of humanity for this day and age.\n\nAn interesting graphological characteristic of Oahspe is that a number of its sub-books are printed on pages divided in two. In these, the top half of the page contains a narrative of celestial events, while the bottom half describes the corresponding events on Earth.\n\n\"Oahspe\" includes doctrinal books, and precepts for behavior can be found throughout its many books. Freedom and responsibility are two themes reiterated throughout the text of \"Oahspe\". Some core doctrines include an herbivorous diet (vegan, vegetable food only), peaceful living (no warring or violence; pacifism), living a life of virtue, service to others, angelic assistance, spiritual communion, and communal living, (the smallest collective unit being ten families, the largest being a total of 3,000 persons then dividing to create a new community).\n\n\"Oahspe\" exhibits great interest in understanding and applying general ethical principles. The suffix ISM in Faith-ism is defined meaning adherence or following an ideology. The Book of Inspiration in the Oahspe states \"I will have no \"sect\". I will have no \"creed\"\".\n\n\"Oahspe\" speaks of the need for all religions to help the various nations and peoples to rise upward. It also speaks of what it calls \"the religion of Gods themselves,\" in which its adherents have no need for intermediaries such as are Saviors and Idols, but who commune directly with the Creator of all.\n\n\"Oahspe\" purports to describe events in the spirit realms and their corresponding influence on events in the physical world starting from approximately 72,000 years ago, although many of such events are not recorded in the existing human records. The Book of Eskra and the Book of Es, according to Oahspe, are the more recent historical records (as they were recorded in the spirit realms) from 1550 BCE to the time Oahspe was transcribed in 1880 CE. The Book of God's Word teaches the record of Zarathustra and dates his time on earth at 9000 years ago.\n\n\"Oahspe\" gives details, including maps, about lost lands and new lands, particularly a large sunken continent called Pan or Whaga that once filled much of the Pacific Ocean. It also puts forward explanations on the causes of rapid loss or gain of fertility, the cyclical variations in heat and light upon the earth.\n\n\"Oahspe\" presents many illustrations of symbols said to be of ancient languages and of rites and ceremonies. It states the concept that there was an original language called \"Pan\" or the \"Panic Language\", meaning \"Earth Language,\" which originated from the ability of humans to mimic sounds. Its \"Book of Saphah\" has details on the claimed meanings and roots of many of the ancient words, symbols and ceremonies.\n\n\"Oahspe\" contains chronologically-ordered accounts that are cosmological revelations concerning the development of humanity from approximately 78,000 years ago. This also includes a narrative of the genesis of life on earth, from its start as a planet being formed from its beginnings as a comet gathering material as its vortex (subtle envelope) matures till it is placed into its own stable orbit around its sun. After cooling - the transformation of gases and its first life-forms - and finally to the appearance of the human race and its progression from beast to physical and spiritual maturity. The process, according to Oahspe, has reached its last stage with the emergence of the \"herbivorous men and women of peace\" of this \"Kosmon\" era.\n\n\"Oahspe\" explains physical science as having its basis in subtler realms (which include spiritual forces), and then how to predict from them. \"Oahspe\" devotes an entire interior book to the subject, called the \"Book of Cosmogony and Prophecy\", but a general overview can be read in the \"Book of Jehovih\". Also, many examples and edifications are sprinkled throughout \"Oahspe\". Other related subjects include physics and an integrating treatment of gravity, light, electricity, magnetism, heat, weather phenomenon, subtle planetary envelopes (called vortices) that respond to conditions beyond its boundaries and more.\n\nVortex Motion of Planets was originally proposed by philosopher and mathematician, Rene Descartes (1596-1650), and was not a new scientific theory as Oahspe claims. Unfortunately for Rene Descartes and Oahspe, Vortex Motions of Planets, originally proposed by Rene Descartes, was superseded by the scientific work of Isaac Newton, 1642 – 1726.\n\nThe text describes cyclical events that occur within a range of greater and smaller cycles. For instance, according to \"Oahspe\", the earth is traveling with the sun and its planets through regions of space in a large circuit of 4,700,000 years, which is divided into sections of 3,000 years average, which also occur within larger cycles of 24,000 years and 72,000 years, and so on. Each of these regions has variations in density and other qualities, and so, engender varying conditions that the Earth encounters. Also, explanation is given as to the rise and fall of civilizations.\n\nThe various regions mentioned in the previous \"Cycles\" section are under the administration of spiritual or \"etherean\" beings with titles such as \"God\" and \"Chief\" and whose ranks and ages vary in ascending grade, from tens of thousands of years to hundreds of thousands of years old and older. Their dominions cover vast distances and include many spiritual and corporeal worlds of various grades and densities.\n\nThese chief officers are designated \"Sons and Daughters of Jehovih,\" and in accordance, the text of \"Oahspe\" contains separate sections or \"books\" such as the \"Book of Cpenta-Armij, Daughter of Jehovih\", and also includes familiar names from non-Abrahamic religions, as in the \"Book of Apollo\" and \"Book of Thor\", named as Sons of Jehovih.\n\nEach of these Chiefs, Chieftainesses, Gods and Goddesses are only advanced angels according to \"Oahspe\". And every angel, regardless of rank or office, was once a mortal, either from this planet earth or from some other planet in the universe.\n\nSoon after its publication, a number of groups/lodges formed in response to \"Oahspe\". In New York City, the Oahspe Faithists met as early as 1883 in the Utah Hall (25th Street and 8th Avenue) with members only attending services. A first colony based on the book's principles was founded in 1882 by Newbrough in Woodside Township, New Jersey, but was relocated 5 months later to a property in Pearl River New York State.\n\nIt was from the Pearl River location that Newbrough and a number of Faithists and orphaned children went to Las Cruces, New Mexico, where they founded the Shalam Colony in 1884. The Shalam Colony continued to exist for more than 10 years, although Newbrough died in 1891 during a severe influenza epidemic.\n\nA contemporary Faithist group is the Universal Faithists of Kosmon (Colorado and California), whose teachings include the virtue of unified group efforts to achieve good works. They have also published a 1991 edition of Oahspe.\n\nIn the United States of America other existing Faithist organizations include:\n\nOutside of the United States:\n\nPast Faithist organizations include:\n\nThe Shalam Colony, or Land of Shalam, was formed in Las Cruces, New Mexico, in 1884, as a commune in which members would live peaceful, vegetarian lifestyles, and where orphaned urban children were to be raised. The commune was decided upon after a convention at Pearl River, New York, in November 1883, and was founded with the financial help of Andrew Howland. Newbrough raised money as well. He charged James Ellis $10,000 to join Shalam, and the next day Ellis demanded his money back. Newbrough refused to return the money. Members spent the first winter in adobe huts, and in 1885 began building a 42-room central building, the Fraternum. Children were \"'gathered-up' from foundling homes; handed over by police sergeants; and left in Faithist depositories\". Newbrough and his wife traveled as far as Kansas City, San Francisco, New Orleans, and Chicago to gather children. The children, from a variety of races, were pampered and treated with love and kindness.\n\nBy the time Newbrough died (on 22 April 1891, of influenza), the colony consisted of the Fraternum, the Children's House (completed in 1890), and a church and other buildings. After the majority of the original volunteers left Shalam in 1886 when the financier, Howland resumed ownership of the property, a second type of colony was built a half a mile away from Shalam; called Levitica, it was founded for people who were not particularly followers of Oahspe teachings but needed a place to live. Levitica was designed in a less communal fashion, and inhabitants lived in more isolated homes. This arrangement also soon failed due to various factors including non-participation.\n\nApparently, the colony was not a viable financial enterprise, due to the repeated failure of crops, the lack of markets for the crops they did produce, and the frequent flooding of the Rio Grande; Newbrough's wife, Francis van de Water Sweet, had married Howland in 1893 \"to put an end to malicious gossip\" but the cost of maintaining the colony proved too high. In 1901, the colony folded, and the children were sent to orphanages in Dallas and Denver.\n\nNumerous publications have been inspired by \"Oahspe\", incorporating text and ideas from it, as well as reinterpretations, condensed and abridged versions. Many of these publications were from: The Essenes of Kosmon, Montrose, Colorado; Kosmon Press, London; Palmer Publications, Amherst, Wisconsin; Universal Faithists of Kosmon, Salt Lake City, Utah; Kosmon Publishing Inc., Kingman, Arizona; The Eloists, Massachusetts; Four Winds Village, Tiger, Georgia.\n\n\"Oahspe\" has been published in three editions in the US; all other complete publications are either reprints or minor modifications of these. The first edition was edited and in 1882 published by John Newbrough. The second was also edited by Newbrough but not published until after his death from influenza on April 22, 1891. The third edition was edited by Wing Anderson in 1912.\n\nThe 1882 \"Oahspe\" edition was available until the 1891 edition appeared, except for an apparently 1912 London edition, which combined 1882 body text with 1891 front matter and image captions. In the USA, the 1882 edition had not been republished until 1960, after Ray Palmer of Palmer Publications found an 1882 \"Oahspe\" edition, by that time rare. He photocopied it and inserted from the 1891 edition, the \"Book of Discipline\", which was not in the 1882 edition; also the 1891 index was adjusted for page numbers and inserted into the 1882 photocopy edition.\n\nThe 1891 \"Oahspe\" Edition was published in various printings from 1891 to the present. The 1891 edition has been published by Kosmon Press, United Kingdom, since 1910, but with some British spellings such as colour instead of color. In America, E. Wing Anderson and his group, the Essenes of Kosmon, published the 1891 \"Oahspe\" edition in several printings from the 1935 printing up to the 1955 printing. Other later reprint editions of the 1891 version include \"Oahspe - the angel cover edition\" by David Cardone, published 1998 and the white paperback edition published by the Universal Faithists of Kosmon in 2004.\n\nA reprint of the 1882 version dedicated to Raymond A. Palmer called the Raymond A Palmer Edition (two volumes of 1250 pages) published 2009, includes pencil drawings that Newbourgh and \"paintings of the Prophets rendered by the artist, Rein\".\n\nThe first complete comprehensive edition of \"Oahspe in Modern Language\" was published online in 2007 and in \"hardcopy\" in 2010. Known as the Oahspe Standard Edition it includes original pre-1882 Oahspe related material, including the \"Book of Knowledge\" and \"Book of Ouranothen\" which were a part of the original pre-1882 published Oahspe material (More of Oahspe by Jim Dennon, 1983), as well as additional footnotes, combined references to 1882 and 1891 editions and an expanded comprehensive index.\n\nJohn Ballou Newbrough was born on 5 June 1828 near Mohicanville, Ohio, in a log cabin. His father, William Newbrough, was an Englishman who had attended the College of William & Mary; his mother, Elizabeth Polsky, was Swiss and attracted to spiritualism. Their son was named for the universalist clergyman Hosea Ballou. Newbrough's father was a stern man, flogging his son when the latter \"began to receive spirit messages\"; his schooling (he went to high school in Cleveland) were paid for by his mother and him selling wool and eggs. He graduated from Cincinnati Medical College, but being highly sensitive to pain and suffering he chose dentistry, setting up practice first in Dayton, then Cincinnati, and then New York City. He ran into trouble with the Goodyear Rubber Company after he developed a much cheaper compound to set teeth in dental plates than the one produced by Goodyear, which dominated the market. He was sued for patent infringement, but when the verdict was handed down in his favor, after he had supposedly consulted with spirits who visited him at dawn, he saw that as confirmation of his spiritual future.\n\nScience writer Martin Gardner compared the fantasy claims in \"Oahspe\" with \"The Urantia Book\". Gardner commented that \"Oahspe\" is even \"crazier than the works of Swedenborg and Davis.\"\n\nGordon Stein in the book \"Encyclopedia of Hoaxes\" (1993) noted that \"Oahspe\" has not been taken seriously because it was revealed to contain \"many factual errors and unfulfilled prophecies.\"\n\nIn modern times it has been stated \"Newbrough was possibly the first to use the word 'star-ship'.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41797102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41797102", "title": "Pashupati seal", "text": "Pashupati seal\n\nThe Pashupati Seal is a steatite seal that was discovered at the Mohenjo-daro archaeological site of the Indus Valley Civilization. The seal depicts a seated figure that is possibly tricephalic (having three heads). It was once thought to be ithyphallic, an interpretation that is now mostly discarded. He has a horned headdress and is surrounded by animals. He may represent a horned deity.\n\nIt is purported to be one of the earliest depictions of the Hindu god Shiva (\"Pashupati\", meaning \"lord of animals\", is one of Shiva's epithets) or Rudra, who is associated with asceticism, yoga, and linga; regarded as a lord of animals; and often depicted as having three heads. The figure has often been connected with the widespread motif of the Master of Animals found in ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean art, and the many other traditions of horned deities.\n\nThe seal was uncovered in 1928-29, in Block 1, Southern Portion of the DK-G Area of Mohenjo-daro, at a depth of 3.9 meters below the surface. E.J.H. Mackay, who directed the excavations at Mohenjo-daro, and dated the seal to the Intermediate I Period (now considered to fall around 2350-2000 BCE) in his 1937-38 report in which the seal is numbered 420, giving it its alternate name.\nThe seal is formed of steatite and measures 3.56 cm by 3.53 cm, with a thickness of 0.76 cm. It has a human figure at the center seated on a platform and facing forward. The legs of the figure are bent at the knees with the heels touching and the toes pointing downwards. The arms extend outwards and rest lightly on the knees, with the thumbs facing away from the body. Eight small and three large bangles cover the arms. The chest is covered with what appear to be necklaces, and a double band wraps around the waist. The figure wears a tall and elaborate headdress with central fan-shaped structure flanked by two large striated horns. The human figure is surrounded by four wild animals: an elephant and a tiger to its one side, and a water buffalo and a rhinoceros on the other. Under the dais are two deer or ibexes looking backwards, so that their horns almost meet the center. At the top of the seal are seven pictographs, with the last apparently displaced downwards for lack of horizontal space.\n\nAn early description and analysis of the seal's iconography was provided by archaeologist John Marshall who had served as the Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India and led the excavations of the Indus Valley sites. In addition to the general features of the seal described above, he also saw the central figure as a male deity; as three-faced, with a possible fourth face towards the back; and, as ithyphallic, while conceding that what appeared to be the exposed phallus could instead be a tassel hanging from the waistband. Most significantly he identified the seal as an early prototype of the Hindu god Shiva (or, his Vedic predecessor, Rudra), who also was known by the title Pashupati ('lord or father of all the animals') in historic times. In a 1928–29 publication, Marshall summarized his reasons for the identification as follows:\n\nLater, in 1931, he expanded his reasons to include the fact that Shiva is associated with the phallus in the form of \"linga\", and that in medieval art he is shown with deer or ibexes, as are seen below the throne on the seal. Marshall's analysis of the Indus Valley religion, and the Pashupati seal in particular, was very influential and widely accepted for at least the next two generations. For instance, Herbert Sullivan, wrote in 1964 that Marshall's analysis \"has been accepted almost universally and has greatly influenced scholarly understanding of the historical development of Hinduism\". Writing in 1976, Doris Srinivasan introduced an article otherwise critical of Marshall's interpretation by observing that \"no matter what position is taken regarding the seal's iconography, it is always prefaced by Marshall's interpretation. On balance the proto- character of the seal has been accepted.\" And Alf Hiltebeitel noted that, following Marshall's analysis, \"nearly all efforts at interpreting the [Indus Valley] religion have centered discussion around [the Pashupati seal] figure\".\n\nA lot of discussion has taken place about this seal. While Marshall's work has earned some support, many critics and even supporters have raised several objections. Doris Srinivasan has argued that the figure does not have three faces, or yogic posture, and that in Vedic literature Rudra was not a protector of wild animals. Herbert Sullivan and Alf Hiltebeitel also rejected Marshall's conclusions, with the former claiming that the figure was female, while the latter associated the figure with \"Mahisha\", the Buffalo God and the surrounding animals with vahanas (vehicles, mounts) of deities for the four cardinal directions. However, Mahisha strikingly resembles Mahesha, an epithet of Shiva Pashupati, besides recalling his vehicle, or vahana Nandi, the bull. This seems to provide further evidence for the interpretation of the Pashupati seal as a proto-Shiva archetype. Various interpretations have been connected to the seal, some relating it to the Vedic deities: Rudra, Agni, Mahisha, Varuna, Yogi, Yogi with Trident as head dress, Ŗșyaśŗnga (sage with horns) who is a contemporary of Dasarataand; and some non-aryan deities, including the unlikely Dravidian origin, sitting in yoga posture.\n\nWriting in 2002, Gregory L. Possehl concluded that while it would be appropriate to recognize the figure as a deity, its association with the water buffalo, and its posture as one of ritual discipline, regarding it as a proto-Shiva would \"go too far.\"\n\n"}

In this book Underhill sets out her belief that spiritual life is part of human nature and as such is available to every human being. Underhill's practical mysticism is secular rather than religious, since \"it is a natural human activity.\"\n\nIn the following paragraph, Underhill defines the meaning of the phrase \"Practical Mysticism\":\nTherefore it is to a practical mysticism that the practical man is here invited: to a training of his latent faculties, a bracing and brightening of his languid consciousness, an emancipation from the fetters of appearance, a turning of his attention to new levels of the world. Thus he may become aware of the universe that the spiritual artist is always trying to disclose to the race. This amount of mystical perception---this 'ordinary contemplation', as the specialist call it,---is possible to all men: without it, they are not wholly alive. It is a natural human activity\n\nUnderhill's book was written at the outbreak of World War I, at a time of \"struggle and endurance, practical sacrifices, difficult and long continuous effort\" when, she believed, practical mysticism was the activity needed most.\n\n"}

West Indian Protestants arrived on the island late 19th and the early 20th centuries, and by the 1920s, several Protestant organizations were established all throughout the country, which added diversity to the religious representation in the Dominican Republic. Many of the Protestant groups in DR had connections with organizations in the United States including Evangelical groups like the Assemblies of God, the Evangelical Church of the Dominican Republic (a united Methodist-Presbyterian church), and the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

All major religious traditions are practiced in the region and new forms are constantly emerging. Asia is noted for its diversity of culture.\n\nDharmic religions are the predominant and oldest religions of Asia. Most of Asia's population follows Indian religions. All Indian religions originated in South Asia. These religions all have the concepts of dharma, karma, and reincarnation.\n\nHinduism is the second largest and the oldest religion in Asia with more than 1 billion followers. Demographically, it is the largest religion in India (80%), Nepal (81%), and the island of Bali (83.5%), with strong minorities in the Asian nations of Bhutan, Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Yemen, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Mayanmar, the Philippines, and Afghanistan. Hinduism is subdivided into a number of major currents, the primary ones being Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Smartism and Shaktism. The vast majority of present-day Hindus can be categorized under one of these four groups, although there are many other, partly overlapping, allegiances and denominations.\n\nHinduism predates recorded history and is thought to have had a beginning during the Indus Valley Civilization itself. It has no single founder; rather, it is a diverse melange of traditions, practices, and lineages. Jainism, and Sikhism emerged in ancient India from Hinduism.\n\nJainism is an Indian religion. Jains are mostly found in India but are increasingly found throughout the world. Jains have significantly influenced and contributed to ethical, political and economic spheres in India. Jains have an ancient tradition of scholarship and have the highest degree of literacy for a religious community in India. Jain libraries are the oldest in the country. It has traditionally been confined to the Indian Subcontinent. It is based on the teachings of Vardhaman Mahavir and also on 23 other Tirthankaras.\n\nBuddhism is the fourth largest world religion and the 3rd largest in Asia, which is 12% of Asia's population. It is dominant and the majority in Bhutan, Burma, Cambodia, Tibet, Laos, Mongolia, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Large Buddhist populations live in China (18.2%), Japan (36.2%), Taiwan (35%), Macau (17%), North Korea (13.8%), Nepal (10.7%), Vietnam (10%), Singapore (33%), Hong Kong (15%) and South Korea (22.9%). It also has strong minorities in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and Russia.\nBuddhism was founded by Siddartha Gautama, also known as Buddha.\n\nBefore the rise of Islam, Buddhism was one of the most widely practiced religions in Central Asia, Afghanistan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia.\n\nSikhism is the fifth largest organized religion in the world, with approximately 30 million adherents. And one of the most steadily growing. It is a monotheistic religion founded by Guru Nanak Dev in the 1500s. The religion professes its roots in the area of Punjab, whose territories form part of India and Pakistan.\n\nThis system of religious philosophy and expression has been traditionally known as the Gurmat (literally the counsel of the gurus) or the Sikh Dharm. Sikhism originated from the word Sikh, which in turn comes from the Sanskrit root śhiṣhya meaning \"disciple\" or \"learner\", or śhikṣha meaning \"instruction\".\n\nSikhism is the 4th largest religion in India with 2% of the total population being Sikh. There is also a large concentration of Sikhs in Malaysia, Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Hongkong, Singapore, Indonesia, Kuwait and U.A.E.\n\nEast Asian religions (also known as Far Eastern religions, Chinese religions, or Taoic religions) form a subset of the Eastern religions.\n\nConfucianism was founded in ancient China by Confucius (551 B.C.E. - 479). Confucianism is a complex of moral, social, political, philosophical, and religious concerns that permeated the culture and history of East Asia. Confucianism emphasizes family, social hierarchy, and personal integrity and is manifested in practices and attitudes rather than institutions and is centered on the family and local society. It was, however, considered the state religion of East Asian countries in some periods. Today the Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese diasporas have brought Confucianism to all parts of the world.\n\nTaoism (also romanized Daoism) is a diverse philosophical and religious tradition that emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao (also romanized \"Dao\"), a term that means \"way\", \"path\" or \"principle\". The concept is shared with other Chinese philosophies and religions. In Taoism, however, \"Tao\" denotes both the source and the driving force inherent in everything that exists. It is ultimately ineffable: \"The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.\"\n\nLaozi is traditionally regarded as the founder of Taoism and is closely associated with \"original\", or \"primordial\", Taoism. Whether he actually existed is commonly disputed; however, the work attributed to him – the Daodejing – is dated to the late 4th century BC.\n\nTaoist propriety and ethics vary according to the particular school, but in general tends to emphasize wu-wei (action through non-action), \"naturalness\", simplicity, spontaneity, and the Three Treasures: compassion, moderation, and humility.\n\nSignificant Taoist communities can be found in China, Korea, Japan and Vietnam and in the Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese diasporas.\n\nChinese folk religion is a label used to describe the ethnic religious traditions which have been a main belief system in China and among the Han Chinese ethnic group for most of the civilization's history. This group of diverse beliefs comprises Chinese mythology and includes the worship of various shen (神, shén; \"deities\", \"spirits\", \"awarenesses\", \"consciousnesses\", \"archetypes\") which can be nature deities, Taizu or clan deities, city deities, national deities, cultural heroes and demigods, dragons and ancestors. Chinese folk religion is sometimes categorized with Taoism, since over the world institutional Taoism has been attempting to assimilate or administer local religions. More accurately, Taoism can be defined as a component of Chinese religion, since it sprang out of folk religion and Chinese philosophy. Chinese folk religion is sometimes seen as a constituent part of Chinese traditional religion, but more often, the two are regarded as synonymous. With around 454 million adherents, or about 6.6% of the world population, Chinese folk religion is one of the major religious traditions in the world. In China more than 30% of the population adheres to folk religions or Taoism.\n\nKami-no-michi is almost unique to Japan and the Japanese diaspora. It is a set of practices carried out to establish a connection between present-day Japan and its ancient past. Shinto practices were first recorded and codified in the written records of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki in the 7th and 8th century. Still, these earliest Japanese writings do not refer to a unified \"Shinto religion\", but rather to disorganized folklore, history, and mythology. Shinto today applies to public shrines suited to various purposes such as war memorials, harvest festivals, romance, and historical monuments, as well as various sectarian organizations.\n\nShinto is the largest religion in Japan, practiced by nearly 80% of the population, yet only a small percentage of these identify themselves as \"Shintoists\" in surveys. According to surveys carried out in 2006 and 2008 show that 3% to 3.9% of the population of Japan are members of Shinto sects and derived religions.\n\nMuism (\"religion of the Mu\") or sometimes Sinism (\"Shingyo\", \"religion of the gods\", with \"shin\" being the Korean character derivative of the \"Hanja\"), encompasses a variety of indigenous religious beliefs and practices of the Korean people, the Korean sphere and the Korean diaspora. In contemporary South Korea, the most used term is \"Muism\" and a shaman is known as a \"mudang\" (, ). The role of the \"mudang\", usually a woman, is to act as intermediary between a spirit entity, spirits or gods and human beings.\n\nWomen are enlisted by those who want the help of the spirit world. Shamans hold \"gut\", or services, in order to gain good fortune for clients, cure illnesses by exorcising negative or 'bad' spirits that cling to people, or propitiate local or village gods. Such services are also held to guide the spirit of a deceased person to higher realms. Today this religion is a minority, but has in recent years seen a resurgence.\n\nZoroastrianism was once the state religion of the Persian Empire, but is now a minority mostly found in India and Iran. It worships a monotheistic god, Ahura Mazda, and was founded by Zoroaster. Zoroastrianism is a religion and philosophy based on the teachings of prophet Zoroaster (also known as Zarathustra, in Avestan), probably founded some time before the 6th century BC. The term Zoroastrianism is, in general usage, essentially synonymous with Mazdaism, i.e., the worship of Ahura Mazda, exalted by Zoroaster as the supreme divine authority.\n\nIn Zoroastrianism, the Creator Ahura Mazda is all good, and no evil originates from Him. Thus, in Zoroastrianism good and evil have distinct sources, with evil (druj) trying to destroy the creation of Mazda (asha), and good trying to sustain it. Mazda is not immanent in the world, and His creation is represented by the Amesha Spentas and the host of other Yazatas, through whom the works of God are evident to humanity, and through whom worship of Mazda is ultimately directed. The most important texts of the religion are those of the Avesta, of which a significant portion has been lost, and mostly only the liturgies of which have survived. The lost portions are known of only through references and brief quotations in the later works of (primarily) the 9th-11th centuries.\n\nThe total number of currently practicing adherents of Zoroastrianism is unknown. A 2004 estimate gives a range of 124,000 to 190,000, roughly half of them in India (the Parsi and Irani groups).\n\nThe largest number of Zoroastrians in Asia can be found in India; according to the 2001 census, they amounted 69,000. In Iran, there were some 25,000 according to the 2011 census. In 2012, the numbers for Zoroastrians were; India (61,000), Iran (15,000 / 22,271), United States (14,405), Canada (6,442), Great Britain (5,500), Australia (2,577), Persian Gulf Countries (1,900) Pakistan (1,675), Singapore (372).\n\nShamanism and Animism have historically been practised in Asia, and is still practiced in most of Asia.\n\nJudaism is the predominant religion in Israel (75.6%), which has a nominal Jewish population of about 6.1 million,\n\nOutside of Israel there are small diaspora communities of Jewish people living in Turkey (17,400), Azerbaijan (9,100), Iran (8,756), India (5,000) and Uzbekistan (4,000).\n\nChristianity is a widespread minority religion in Asia with more than 286 million adherents according to Pew Research Center in 2010, and nearly 364 million according to Britannica Book of the Year 2014. constituting around 12.6% of the total population of Asia.\n\nOnly six countries are predominantly Christian: Asian Russia which is predominantly the Russian Orthodox Church ;Cyprus, which is predominantly Orthodox; the Philippines, which is the third-largest Roman Catholic nation in the world; Timor Leste, which is the most overwhelming Christian (99.6%) and Roman Catholic nation in Asia (97.6%) ; Armenia, which was the first state to adopt a Christian denomination as its state religion; and Georgia. Christianity also accounts for 29.2% of South Korea's population (54.5% of its religious population) and is now the predominant religion in South Korea, Christianity is also a large minority religion in Lebanon accounting for 40% of its population. Christianity is also a large minority religion in Kazakhstan (26%), Singapore (18.3%), and Kyrgyzstan (17%).\n\nAsian countries with large Christian populations are Philippines (84 million), China (68 million), India (24 million), Indonesia (23 million), Kazakhstan (16.5 million), South Korea (15 million), Vietnam (7 million), Georgia (4.6 million), Armenia (3.2 million), Malaysia (2.6 million), Japan (2.5 million), Pakistan (2.5 million), Uzbekistan (2.5 million), Syria (1.8 million), Sri Lanka (1.5 million), East Timor (1.2 million) and Taiwan (one million).\n\nThere are still large ancient communities of Middle Eastern Christians and Arab Christians in Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Israel and Palestine numbering more than 3 million in West Asia. There are also a large populations of expatriate workers which include a sizeable Christian communities live in Arabian Peninsula numbering more than 3 million.\n\nA 2015 study estimates about 6,968,500 Muslims convert to Christianity in Asia, most of them belonging to some form of Protestantism.\n\nIslam is the largest religion in Asia with approx. 1.1 billion adherents. Islam is a monotheistic and Abrahamic religion articulated by the Qur'an, a book considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God (Arabic: الله Allāh) and by the teachings and normative example (called the Sunnah and composed of hadith) of Muhammad, considered by them to be the last prophet of God. South Asia and Southeast Asia are home of the most populous Muslim countries, with Indonesia, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh having more than 100 million adherents each. According to U.S. government figures, in 2006 there were 20 million Muslims in China. In the Western Asia, the non-Arab countries of Iran and Turkey are the largest Muslim-majority countries. In South Asia, Pakistan and Bangladesh are the countries with the largest Muslim-majority. In Central Asia, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan are the countries with the largest Muslim-majority.\n\nIndonesia is 87 percent Muslim and is the country with the largest Muslim population in the world, Pakistan is 97 percent Muslim, Bangladesh is 90 percent Muslim.\nIndia's Muslim population is 14.2% of the total, approximately 190 million people. Around 6-11 percent, some 6 - 12 million people in the Philippines are Muslim. \nThailand's Muslims make up 4.6 percent of the population, or approximately 3 million people. Also Sri Lanka's Muslims make up 10 percent of the population, or approximately 2.5 million people \n\nBangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Kazakhstan, Qatar, Kuwait, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Maldives, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Yemen, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Lebanon are the 23 Muslim majority states in Asia\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, a minority Muslim sect, originated on the Asian continent in 1889 in Qadian, India. The community had 10 million members as of the 1980s. As of 2008, the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has been established in all Asian countries except for Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia and North Korea. Ahmadis are most persecuted in Asia, particularly in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Indonesia.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith is an Abrahamic religion although it is quite different from Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. It was so founded by Bahá'u'lláh in what was then Persia (also known as Iran). Today the largest national population of Bahá'ís is in India with between 1.7 million to 3.2 million, where there is also the Lotus Temple. Significant populations are found in many countries including Vietnam and Malaysia where \"about 1%\", some 260,000, of the population are Bahá'ís. In other places, like Kazakhstan there are 25 Local Spiritual Assemblies.\n\nIn modern-day Iran, the religion is severely persecuted (see Persecution of Bahá'ís). In neighboring Turkmenistan, Bahá'í Faith is effectively banned, and individuals have had their homes raided for Bahá'í literature. For further information, see Bahá'í Statistics for Asia and .\n\nAccording to a Pew Research Center survey in 2012 religiously unaffiliated (including agnostics and atheists) make up about 21.2% of Asia population. According to the same survey, the religiously unaffiliated are the majority of the population in four Asian countries/territories: North Korea (71%), Japan (57%), Hong Kong (56%), and Mainland China (52%).\n\nOther sources say that in the People's Republic of China, 59% of the population claim to be non-religious. However, this percentage may be significantly greater (up to 80%) or smaller (down to 30%) in reality, because some Chinese define religion differently. Some Chinese define religion as practicing customs (which may be done for cultural or traditional reasons), while others define it as actually consciously believing their religion will lead to post-mortem salvation or reincarnation. A Dentsu statistic states that 46% of Vietnamese and 51% of Japanese are irreligious.\n"}

{"id": "23590382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23590382", "title": "The True Word", "text": "The True Word\n\nThe True Word (or \"Discourse, Account\", \"Doctrine\"; , \"Logos Alēthēs\") is a lost treatise in which the ancient Greek philosopher Celsus addressed many principal points of Early Christianity and refuted or argued against their validity. In \"The True Word\", Celsus attacked Christianity in three ways; by refuting its philosophical claims, by marking it as a phenomenon associated with the uneducated and lower class, and by cautioning his audience that it was a danger to the Roman Empire. All information concerning the work exists only in the extensive quotations from it in the \"Contra Celsum\" (\"Against Celsus\") written some seventy years later by the Christian Origen. These are believed to be accurate as far as they go, but may not give a fully comprehensive picture of the original work.\n\nCelsus was only one writer in a long tradition of Roman writers and philosophers who wrote and spoke out against Christianity, feeling that their doctrines were either inscrutable or downright foolish. The primary problem that most Roman citizens and the Imperial government had regarding the Christians was their adamant refusal to participate in the required sacrifices that were regularly made to the Emperor and the Roman state, sacrifices that were an integral part of Roman politics, religion, and culture. Most Romans could not understand the Christians' insistence on their own superiority and their insistence upon their apparently exclusive path to salvation. They could also not understand Christianity’s claims that they were a unique religion with a long history reaching back to antiquity, when the Roman philosophers knew that Christianity had broken off from Judaism relatively recently and still used ancient Jewish texts both to formulate their theology and to support their religious claims. These Roman writers, who often professed to be loyal members of the Empire and Roman society, were also “troubled by the seeming incoherence of the Christian position toward society and towards the recognized religion of the state”. All of these factors led to Christians being classified as enemies of society. Roman philosophers also attacked Christian moral and ethical principles because “the Christianity of the first century had yet to develop an assailable system of belief or a fixed canon of writings from which such beliefs could be educed”. Celsus was only one among many, including Lucian, who wrote against Christianity.\n\nCelsus was either a Greek or a Roman who wrote during the latter half of the 2nd century AD. Very little is known about his origins or life. The work in its original form has been lost and the \"True Word\" survives only as excerpts from a work by the Christian scholar Origen, who quoted Celsus to rebut him. Origen stated that Celsus was from the first half of the 2nd century A.D., although the majority of modern scholars have come to a general consensus that Celsus probably wrote around 170 to 180 A.D. Most modern scholars are in agreement that Celsus did not rely on the “rumors and hearsay evidence” that many other Christian detractors of the time period used, but rather drew upon his own observations and displayed knowledge of both the Hebrew Bible and New Testament of the Christian Bible, as well as other Jewish and Christian writings.\n\nCelsus’ first main point in his \"True Word\" was to refute the validity of Christianity. In his opinion Christian theology was based on an amalgamation of false eastern philosophical ideas hastily tied together. He stated that Christians would “weave together erroneous opinions drawn from ancient sources and trumpet them aloud”.\nCelsus gave a point by point critique of Christian doctrine, and why it should not have been believed by anyone. He denied the virgin birth of Jesus, and accused Mary of being an adulteress turned out by her husband. His theory was not new, as even Jews at that time were saying the same. The remainder of Christian stories – what now makes up the Christian Bible- Celsus found very insipid and unappealing compared to Greek and Roman legends of powerful and colorful gods. Celsus also found Christian philosophy lacking when compared to secular philosophy, and declared that “things are stated much better among the Greeks”. Celsus used Plato as the representative for Greek philosophers and, according to him, when comparing the two philosophical traditions Christianity appeared far worse, as \"Plato is not guilty of boasting and falsehood\", a crime which Celsus obviously feels is a trademark of Christian theologians. The only connection Celsus made between Greek philosophy and Christianity was when he asserted that “Jesus perverted the words of the philosopher” (i.e. Plato).\n\nWhen compared with the gods of Roman and Greek mythology, Celsus found the Christian God sadly lacking, and declared that he could not be a god as he was neither all-knowing nor all-powerful. Celsus could deduce no explanation for the actions of the Christian God, such as the floods, natural disasters, and the introduction of evil into the world, except that God wanted to draw attention to his greatness because he felt humanity was giving him “less than his due”. Celsus concluded that Christians used the explanation of God \"testing\" them to disguise the fact that their God was not powerful enough to successfully fight Satan, but was instead “helpless”. Celsus wrote that Satan was either a mortal invention used by Christians to frighten others into believing their philosophies and joining them, or if he did indeed exist then he was proof that God was not all-powerful, but rather a weak lesser god and a bad one, for only a vindictive and insecure being would punish mankind for being tricked by an evil that he has been too weak to stop.\nThe apparent “blind faith” of the Christians was bewildering to Celsus, and he used it to further support his claim that Christianity was a false religion. In his opinion, the main tenet of Christianity was “Do not ask questions, just believe” and “Thy faith will save thee\".\n\nCelsus complained that Christianity was a phenomenon limited primarily to the lower class. He claimed that Christians actively sought out and converted the ignorant, uneducated, and lower class, as they were the only people who would believe in such a ridiculous theology and blindly follow its doctrines. If an individual was from the upper class, and therefore well educated and naturally of good character, they would not be converted because they could not possibly believe in the absurd assumptions one had to in order to be considered “Christian”. Celsus revealed himself to be a member of the upper class when he makes his statements regarding Jesus; who obviously could not be the son of god as he was born a peasant. The \"True Word\" stated that Mary would have been unworthy to be noticed by God “because she was neither rich nor of royal rank”. Celsus also claimed that Christianity was against personal betterment, as that could cause their followers to discover the fallacies within their religion. Celsus declared that Christians convert by “lead[ing] on wicked men by empty hopes, and to persuade them to despise better things, saying that if they refrain from them it will be better…”.\n\nCelsus’ main argument against Christianity, and why he attacked it with such vigor, was that he considered it a divisive and destructive force that would harm both the Roman Empire and society. Adherence to the state supported Roman religion was compulsory and the Roman authorities felt it was necessary for the effective management of the political system. One of the most integral parts of the Roman state religion was reverence and occasional sacrifices for the Emperor, an act that Christians continually refused to participate in, as in their opinion it came too close to idolatry and worship of a God that was not their own. \n\nCelsus listed many reasons for how his Roman readers could easily deduce that Christianity was endangering their unity and the stability of the Empire. Christianity originated from Judaism, whose adherents, although living within the Empire, had already revolted against Roman rule several times. The Christian community then became further divided amongst themselves, and Celsus complained that “matters are determined in different ways by the various sects”. This dissension between different factions within Christianity proved to the Romans that Christians who could not even draw together under their own shared beliefs were naturally a divisive people and not only caused friction within their own philosophy but would disrupt the unity of the Empire. Finally Celsus and other Roman writers believed that “Christians are dangerous precisely because they put the advancement of their beliefs above the common good and the welfare of the state”.\n\nThe secrecy in which Christians met and practiced was another problem for Celsus. He commented that they “entered into secret associations with each other contrary to law”. Celsus stated that there was nothing wrong with swearing allegiance to a king or emperor, as he provided the stable environment in which all citizens could freely live, and in return it was the duty of each Roman citizen to assist the Emperor and “labor with him in the maintenance of justice”.\n\nCelsus provided only one solution to solve the problems that he believed Christianity would inevitably create within the Empire. He commanded that Christians must both respect the Emperor and perform rituals to the gods of the Roman state. If they could not or would not participate in the Imperial religion they must not “take any share in the affairs of life; but… depart hence with all speed and leave no posterity behind them”.\n\n"}
{"id": "45082585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45082585", "title": "Theosophical mysticism", "text": "Theosophical mysticism\n\nWithin the system of Theosophy, developed by occultist Helena Blavatsky and others since the second half of the 19th century, Theosophical mysticism draws upon various existing disciplines and mystical models, including Neo-platonism, Gnosticism, Western esotericism, Freemasonry, Hinduism and Buddhism.\n\nThe three fundamental propositions expounded in \"The Secret Doctrine\" are –\n\nHelena Blavatsky taught that Theosophy is neither revelation nor speculation. Blavatsky stated that Theosophy was an attempt at a gradual, faithful reintroduction of a hitherto hidden science called the occult science in Theosophical literature. According to Blavatsky occult science provides a description of reality not only at a physical level but also on a metaphysical one. Blavatsky said occult science had been preserved and practiced throughout history by carefully selected and trained individuals.\n\nThe Theosophical Society believes its precepts and doctrinal foundation will be verified when a Theosophist follows prescribed disciplines to develop metaphysical means of knowledge that transcend the limitations of the senses.\n\nTheosophy was considered by Blavatsky to be \"the substratum and basis of all the world-religions and philosophies\". In \"The Key to Theosophy\", she stated the following about the meaning and origin of the term:\nAccording to her, all real lovers of divine wisdom and truth had, and have, a right to the name of Theosophist. Blavatsky discussed the major themes of Theosophy in several major works, including \"The Secret Doctrine\", \"Isis Unveiled\", \"The Key to Theosophy\", and \"The Voice of the Silence\". She also wrote over 200 articles in various theosophical magazines and periodicals. Contemporaries of Blavatsky, as well as later theosophists, contributed to the development of this school of theosophical thought, producing works that at times sought to elucidate the ideas she presented (see Gottfried de Purucker), and at times to expand upon them. Since its inception, and through doctrinal assimilation or divergence, Theosophy has also given rise to or influenced the development of other mystical, philosophical, and religious movements.\n\nTheosophists attribute the origin of Theosophy to a universal striving for spiritual fulfilment, which they assert exists in all cultures and at all times. According to Theosophical texts, kindred practices and philosophies are found in an unbroken chain in India, but are also said to have existed in Ancient Greece and to be hinted in the writings of Plato (427–347 BCE), Plotinus (204–270), and other neo-Platonists.\n\nBroadly, Theosophy attempts to reconcile humanity's scientific, philosophical, and religious disciplines and practices into a unified worldview. As it largely employs a synthesizing approach, it makes extensive use of the vocabulary and concepts of many philosophical and religious traditions. However these, along with all other fields of knowledge, are investigated, amended, and explained within an esoteric or occult framework.\nIn often elaborate exposition, Theosophy's all-encompassing worldview proposes explanations for the origin, workings and ultimate fate of the universe and humanity; it has therefore also been called a system of \"absolutist metaphysics\".\n\nAccording to Blavatsky, Theosophy is neither revelation nor speculation. It is portrayed as an attempt at gradual, faithful reintroduction of a hitherto hidden science, which is called in Theosophical literature \"The Occult Science\". According to Blavatsky, this postulated science provides a description of Reality not only at a physical level, but also on a metaphysical one. The Occult Science is said to have been preserved (and practiced) throughout history by carefully selected and trained individuals. Theosophists further assert that Theosophy's precepts and their axiomatic foundation may be verified by following certain prescribed disciplines that develop in the practitioner metaphysical means of knowledge, which transcend the limitations of the senses.\nIt is commonly held by Theosophists that many of the basic Theosophical tenets may in the future be empirically and objectively verified by science, as it develops further.\n\nIn \"The Secret Doctrine\", Blavatsky spoke of a basic item of cosmogony reflected in the ancient saying: \"as above, so below\". This item is used by many theosophists as a method of study and has been called \"The Law of Correspondences\". Briefly, the law of correspondences states that the microcosm is the miniature copy of the macrocosm and therefore what is found \"below\" can be found, often through analogy, \"above\".\nExamples include the basic structures of microcosmic organisms mirroring the structure of macrocosmic organisms (see septenary systems, below). The lifespan of a human being can be seen to follow, by analogy, the same path as the seasons of the Earth, and in theosophy it is postulated that the same general process is equally applied to the lifespan of a planet, a solar system, a galaxy and to the universe itself. Through the Law of Correspondences, a theosophist seeks to discover the first principles underlying various phenomena by finding the shared essence or idea, and thus to move from particulars to principles.\n\nApplied Theosophy was one of the main reasons for the foundation of the Theosophical Society in 1875; the practice of Theosophy was considered an integral part of its contemporary incarnation. Theosophical discipline includes the practice of study, meditation, and service, which are traditionally seen as necessary for a holistic development. Also, the acceptance and practical application of the Society's \"motto\" and of its three objectives are part of the Theosophical life.\nEfforts at applying its tenets started early. Study and meditation are normally promoted in the activities of the Theosophical Society, and in 1908 an international charitable organization to promote service, the Theosophical Order of Service, was founded.\n\nDespite extensively using Sanskrit terminology in her works, many Theosophical concepts are expressed differently from in the original scriptures. To provide clarity on her intended meanings, Blavatsky's \"The Theosophical Glossary\" was published in 1892, one year after her death. According to its editor, George Robert Stowe Mead, Blavatsky wished to express her indebtedness to four works: the \"Sanskrit-Chinese Dictionary\", the \"Hindu Classical Dictionary\", \"Vishnu Purana\", and \"The Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia\".\n\nBlavatsky explained the essential component ideas of her cosmogony in her magnum opus, \"The Secret Doctrine\". She began with three fundamental propositions, of which she said:\nThe first proposition is that there is one underlying, unconditioned, indivisible Truth, variously called \"the Absolute\", \"the Unknown Root\", \"the One Reality\", etc. It is causeless and timeless, and therefore unknowable and non-describable: \"It is 'Be-ness' rather than Being\". However, transient states of matter and consciousness are manifested in IT, in an unfolding gradation from the subtlest to the densest, the final of which is physical plane. According to this view, manifest existence is a \"change of condition\" and therefore neither the result of creation nor a random event.\n\nEverything in the universe is informed by the potentialities present in the \"Unknown Root,\" and manifest with different degrees of Life (or energy), Consciousness, and Matter.\n\nThe second proposition is \"the absolute universality of that law of periodicity, of flux and reflux, ebb and flow\". Accordingly, manifest existence is an eternally re-occurring event on a \"boundless plane\": the playground of numberless Universes incessantly manifesting and disappearing, each one \"standing in the relation of an effect as regards its predecessor, and being a cause as regards its successor\", doing so over vast but finite periods of time.\n\nRelated to the above is the third proposition: \"The fundamental identity of all Souls with the Universal Over-Soul... and the obligatory pilgrimage for every Soul—a spark of the former—through the Cycle of Incarnation (or 'Necessity') in accordance with Cyclic and Karmic law, during the whole term.\"\nThe individual souls are seen as units of consciousness (Monads) that are intrinsic parts of a universal oversoul, just as different sparks are parts of a fire. These Monads undergo a process of evolution where consciousness unfolds and matter develops. This evolution is not random, but informed by intelligence and with a purpose. Evolution follows distinct paths in accord with certain immutable laws, aspects of which are perceivable on the physical level. One such law is the law of periodicity and cyclicity; another is the law of karma or cause and effect.\n\nIn \"The Secret Doctrine\", Blavatsky quoted Gerald Massey a \"suggestive analogy between the Aryan or Brahmanical and the Egyptian esotericism\" She said that the \"seven rays of the Chaldean Heptakis or Iao, on the Gnostic stones\" represent the seven large stars of the ancient Egyptian Great Bear constellation, the seven elemental powers, and the Hindu \"seven Rishis\". Blavatsky saw the seven rays of the Vedic sun deity Vishnu as representing the same concept as the \"astral fluid or 'Light' of the Kabalists,\" and said that the seven emanations of the lower seven sephiroth are the \"primeval seven rays\", and \"will be found and recognized in every religion.\"\n\nTheosophy holds that the manifested universe is ordered by the number seven, a common claim among esoteric and mystical doctrines and religions. Thus, the evolutionary \"pilgrimage\" proceeds cyclically through seven stages, with the three first steps involving an apparent involution, the fourth one being one of equilibrium, and the last three involving a progressive development.\n\nThere are seven symbols of particular importance to the Society's symbology:\nThe seal of the Society contains all of these symbols, except \"aum\", and thus contains, in symbolic form, the doctrines its members follow.\n\nIn the Theosophical view all major facets of existence manifest following a seven-fold model: \"Our philosophy teaches us that, as there are seven fundamental forces in nature, and seven planes of being, so there are seven states of consciousness in which man can live, think, remember and have his being.\"\n\nThe Cosmos does not consist only of the physical plane that can be perceived with the five senses, but there is a succession of\nseven Cosmic planes of existence, composed of increasingly subtler forms of matter-energy, and in which states of consciousness other than the commonly known can manifest. Blavatsky described the planes according to these states of consciousness. In her system, for example, the plane of the material and concrete mind (lower mental plane) is classified as different from the plane of the spiritual and holistic mind (higher mental plane). Later Theosophists like Charles Webster Leadbeater and Annie Besant classified the seven planes according to the kind of subtle matter that compose them. Since both the higher and lower mental planes share the same type of subtle matter, they regard them as one single plane with two subdivisions. In this later view the seven cosmic planes include (from spiritual to material):\n\n\nJust as the Cosmos is not limited to its physical dimension, human beings have also subtler dimensions and bodies. The \"Septenary Nature of Man\" was described by Blavatsky in, among other works, \"The Key to Theosophy\"; in descending order, it ranges from a postulated purely spiritual essence (called a \"Ray of the Absolute\") to the physical body.\n\nThe Theosophical teachings about the constitution of human beings talk about two different, but related, things: principles and bodies. Principles are the seven basic constituents of the universe, usually described by Mme. Blavatsky as follows:\n\n\nThese Principles in Man may or may not form one or more bodies. Blavatsky's teachings about subtle bodies were few and not very systematic. In an article she described three subtle bodies:\n\nThe \"Linga Sharira\" is the invisible double of the human body, elsewhere referred to as the etheric body or doppelgänger and serves as a model or matrix of the physical body, which conforms to the shape, appearance and condition of his \"double\". The linga sarira can be separated or projected a limited distance from the body. When separated from the body it can be wounded by sharp objects. When it returns to the physical frame, the wound will be reflected in the physical counterpart, a phenomenon called \"repercussion.\" At death, it is discarded together with the physical body and eventually disintegrates or decomposes. This can be seen over the graves like a luminous figure of the man that was, during certain atmospheric conditions.\n\nThe mayavi-rupa is dual in its functions, being:\n\"...the vehicle both of thought and of the animal passions and desires, drawing at one and the same time from the lowest terrestrial manas (mind) and Kama, the element of desire.\"\n\nThe higher part of this body, containing the spiritual elements gathered during life, merges after death entirely into the causal body; while the lower part, containing the animal elements, forms the Kama-rupa, the source of \"spooks\" or apparitions of the dead.\n\nTherefore, besides the dense physical body, the subtle bodies in a human being are:\n\nThese bodies go up to the higher mental plane. The two higher spiritual Principles of Buddhi and Atma do not form bodies proper but are something more like \"sheaths\".\n\nBlavatsky was influential on spiritualism and related subcultures: \"The western esoteric tradition has no more important figure in modern times.\" She wrote prolifically, publishing thousands of pages and debate continues about her work. She taught about very abstract and metaphysical principles, but also sought to denounce and correct superstitions that, in her view, had grown in different esoteric religions. Some of these statements are controversial. For example, she quotes Anna Kingsford and Edward Maitland's book \"The Perfect Way\". \"It is 'Satan who is the God of our planet and the only God', and this without any metaphorical allusion to its wickedness and depravity,\" wrote Blavatsky, in \"The Secret Doctrine\". \"For he is one with the Logos.\" He is whom \"every dogmatic religion, preeminently the Christian, points out as [...] the enemy of God, [... but is] in reality, the highest divine Spirit—Occult Wisdom on Earth. [...] Thus, the Latin Church [... and] the Protestant Church [... both] are fighting against divine Truth, when repudiating and slandering the Dragon of Esoteric Divine Wisdom. Whenever they anathematize the Gnostic Solar Chnouphis, the Agathodaemon Christos, or the Theosophical Serpent of Eternity, or even the Serpent of \"Genesis\".\" In this reference Blavatsky explains that he whom the Christian dogma calls Lucifer was never the representative of the evil in ancient myths but, on the contrary, the light-bringer (which is the literal meaning of the name Lucifer). According to Blavatsky the church turned him into Satan (which means \"the opponent\") to misrepresent pre-Christian beliefs and fit him into the newly framed Christian dogmas. A similar view is also shared by some Christian Gnostics, ancient and modern.\n\nThroughout much of Blavatsky's public life her work drew harsh criticism from some of the learned authorities of her day, as for example when she said that the atom was divisible.\n\nMax Müller, the renowned philologist and orientalist, was scathing in his criticism of Blavatsky's Esoteric Buddhism. Whilst he was willing to give her credit for good motives, at least at the beginning of her career, in his view she ceased to be truthful both to herself and to others with her later \"hysterical writings and performances\". Müller felt he had to speak out when he saw the Buddha being \"lowered to the level of religious charlatans, or his teaching misrepresented as esoteric twaddle\". There is a nothing esoteric or secretive in Buddhism, he wrote, in fact the very opposite. \"Whatever was esoteric was \"ipso facto\" not Buddha's teaching; whatever was Buddha's teaching was \"ipso facto\" not esoteric\". Blavatsky, it seemed to Müller, \"was either deceived by others or carried away by her own imaginations\" and that Buddha was \"against the very idea of keeping anything secret\".\n\nCritics pronounced her claim of the existence of masters of wisdom to be utterly false, and accused her of being a charlatan, a false medium, evil, a spy for the Russians, a smoker of cannabis, a plagiarist, a spy for the English, a racist, and a falsifier of letters. Most of the accusations remain undocumented.\n\nIn \"The New York Times\" Edward Hower wrote, \"Theosophical writers have defended her sources vehemently. Skeptics have painted her as a great fraud.\"\n\nIn the 1885 Hodgson Report to the Society for Psychical Research (SPR), Richard Hodgson concluded that Blavatsky was a fraud. However, in 1986, the SPR published a critique by handwriting expert Vernon Harrison, \"which discredited crucial elements\" of Hodgeson's case against Blavatsky, nevertheless, \"Theosophists have overinterpreted this as complete vindication,\" wrote Johnson, \"when in fact many questions raised by Hodgson remain unanswered.\"\n\nRené Guénon wrote a detailed critique of Theosophy entitled \"Theosophism: history of a pseudo-religion\" (1921), in which he claimed that Blavatsky had acquired all her knowledge from reading books, and not from any supernatural masters. Guenon pointed out that Blavatsky was a regular visitor to a library in New York, where she had easy access to the works of Jacob Boehme, Eliphas Levi, the Kabbala and other Hermetic treatises. Guenon also wrote that Blavatsky had borrowed passages from extracts of the \"Kanjur\" and \"Tanjur\", translated by the eccentric orientalist Sándor Kőrösi Csoma, published in 1836 in the twentieth volume of the \"Asiatic Researchers of Calcutta\" .\n\nK. Paul Johnson suggests in his book \"The Masters Revealed: Madam Blavatsky and Myth of the Great White Brotherhood\" that the Masters that Madam Blavatsky claimed she had personally met are idealizations of certain people she had met during her lifetime.\n\nThe article \"Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements\" by Paul Zweig \"New York Times\" October 5, 1980, maintains that Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.\n\nRobert Todd Carroll in his book \"The skeptic's dictionary\" (2003) wrote that Blavatsky used trickery into deceiving others into thinking she had paranormal powers. Carroll wrote that Blavatsky had faked a materialization of a teacup and saucer as well as writing the messages from her masters herself.\n\nJackson Spielvogel and David Redles of the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance analyze Blavatsky's racial ideas in her book \"Secret Doctrine\". According to Spielvogel and Redles, Blavatsky labeled some races superior and others inferior. They clarify that Blavatsky did not advocate \"domination of one race over another\" and that she was against violence. They comment that Blavatsky's work \"helped to foster antisemitism, which is perhaps one of the reasons her esoteric work was so rapidly accepted in German circles.\" They state Blavatsky \"sharply differentiated Aryan and Jewish religion\" and believed \"The Aryans were the most spiritual people on earth.\" They quote Blavatsky's writing in \"Secret Doctrine\" as stating Aryans used religion as an \"everlasting lodestar\" in contrast to Judaism which Blavatsky claimed was based on \"mere calculation\" while characterizing it as a \"religion of hate and malice toward everyone and everything outside itself.\"\n\nThe first aim of the Theosophical Society she founded is \"To form a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or colour\", and her writings also include references emphasizing the unity of humanity: \"all men have spiritually and physically the same origin\" and that \"mankind is essentially of one and the same essence\". Cranston quoted Blavatsky saying that in reality there is no inferior or low-grade races because all of it are one common humankind.\n\nBlavatsky had posited that humanity evolved through a series of stages called Root Races, the present, the Aryan, being the Fifth Root Race (of seven). The \"Root Races\" do not refer to ethnicities. They represent evolutionary stages the whole humanity is engaged in, each new Root Race being more advanced than the previous one. She taught that the earlier stage of evolution took place in Atlantis during the Fourth Root-Race. The Aryan Root Race was then only one more step in the evolutionary progression, to be eventually superseded by a more spiritual Root Race, the Sixth.\n\nRegarding the concept of race as defined – in a comparatively more limited manner – by anthropology, sociology, and other disciplines, Blavatsky did not encourage superiority by any person or group, promoting the idea of the common origin and destiny of all humanity, and establishing the principle of universal brotherhood as the First Object of the Theosophical Society. She also proclaimed religious tolerance and inclusiveness stating, \"Theosophists, collectively, respect the Bible as much as they do the sacred scriptures of other people, finding in it the same eternal truths as in the Vedas, the Zend-Avesta, the Tripitakas, etc.\" Conversely, Austrian/German ultra-nationalist Guido von List and his followers such as Lanz von Liebenfels, later selectively mixed parts of Blavatsky's occult philosophy with nationalistic and fascist ideas; this system of thought became known as Ariosophy. Some researchers, tracing the links between Ariosophy and Theosophy, stated that the latter relies mostly on \"intellectual expositions of racial evolution\".\nHowever in \"The Key to Theosophy\", Blavatsky had stated that \"The Society is a philanthropic and scientific body for the propagation of the idea of brotherhood on \"practical\" instead of \"theoretical\" lines.\"\n\n\n"}

They may be dyed in different colors, often with white or red for the main body of the torma. They are made in specific shapes based on their purpose, usually conical in form. A very large, central shrine torma may be constructed for festivals, though typically they are small and placed directly on a shrine, on a plate, mounted on leather or held on a special base like a skull.\n\nThe tradition of using offering cakes pre-dates Tibetan Buddhism, though traditional Indian offering cakes — called \"bali\" or \"balingha\" in Sanskrit — are flat instead of conical.\n\nThe Tibetan term comes from the root \"gtor-ba\" which means to \"cast away, break up, or scatter\". This implies both a sense of offering and of letting go or non-attachment.\n\nTormas have different uses. Some are created and placed on shrines for ceremonies or to represent deities. Others are used in feast practice and consumed by practitioners during the practice. Others are made to appease spirits, accumulate merit, or remove obstacles. They are mostly made of barley flour and butter, but traditionally other ingredients such as egg, milk, sugar, honey, and even meat may be included depending upon the purpose of the torma.\n\nDeity tormas (Wylie: rten gtor) are kept on the shrine, and represent a particular tantric deity. These tormas vary in complexity from a very simple cone painted white for peaceful deities like Tara and Avalokiteshvara, to very complex designs for semi-wrathful deities like Vajrayogini and Chakrasamvara.\n\nFood tormas (Wylie: skang gtor) are used in feast practices and are consumed partially by practitioners during the feast, with leftovers (Wylie: dme gtor) offered to lower beings after being blessed. In some traditions, food tormas are now made with more contemporary ingredients whereas others stay faithful to the barley flour tradition.\n\nOffering tormas may be made for and offered to deities (Wylie: sgrub gtor / mchod gtor), to Dharma Protectors, to obstructing spirits, or to other lower beings. Torma for obstructing spirits are called \"gektor\".\n\nA torma may be used in Tibetan medicine to extract an illness from a patient as a cure. The torma is then cast away.\n\nA \"captured\" torma (Wylie: gta' gtor) may be used to speed completion of activities, by planning to offer the torma at the completion of the activity thereby encouraging successful activity.\n\nPracticing meditation with deity visualization is considered a form of torma offering, though no physical cake is created and then offered. Similarly, offering one's internal emotional and mental experiences and experience of suchness are non-physical forms of torma offerings.\n\n"}
{"id": "200730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=200730", "title": "United Lodge of Theosophists", "text": "United Lodge of Theosophists\n\nThe United Lodge of Theosophists or ULT is an informal and wholly voluntary association of \"students\" of Theosophy. It was founded in 1909, mainly through the efforts of Robert Crosbie. The first \"parent lodge\" of the ULT was started in Los Angeles by Robert Crosbie and seven other associates through the adoption of its Declaration on February 18, 1909. Owing largely to the revival efforts of B.P. Wadia after Crosbie's death, there are currently about twenty active lodges spread all over the world. The ULT is considered to be part of the \"second generation\" or the \"third section\" of the Theosophical Movement started in 1875 by H.P. Blavatsky in New York. Presently, it is also one of the existing four main \"branches\" of the original Theosophical Movement. The following founding principles when taken as a whole, sets apart the ULT from the other Theosophical Organizations:\nULT Los Angeles publishes the \"Theosophy Magazine\" which was started by Robert Crosbie in 1912. It was the revival of an earlier periodical called \"The Path\" that was edited by W.Q. Judge. ULT India publishes the \"Theosophical Movement Magazine\", founded under B.P. Wadia in 1930 in Mumbai. ULT Santa Barbara publishes a quarterly periodical called Vidya, and uses Concord Grove Press to publish theosophical texts including a pamphlet series on themes from \"The Secret Doctrine\". The Theosophy Company was registered in 1925 on behalf of ULT as a fiduciary agent and an eleemosynary, non-profit corporation to publish photographic facsimile of the Original Editions of books by H.P. Blavatsky and W.Q. Judge.\n\nThe history of ULT began with Robert Crosbie coming in contact with H.P. Blavatsky in 1887 and his subsequent association with the Theosophical Society or TS in Boston. Based on H.P. Blavatsky's instructions, he placed himself under the direct guidance of W.Q. Judge. Following the death of the original founders of the movement, Robert Crosbie was witness to the ensuing rivalries around \"leadership\", \"authority\" and \"succession\" surrounding Katherine Tingley, who headed the American section and Annie Besant, who headed the international section from India. Initially, Robert Crosbie gave his support to Katherine Tingley and went to Point Loma in 1900 to be of assistance there. However, by 1904, he felt the original teachings of Theosophy were almost completely eclipsed by Katherine Tingley's sensational programs. Convinced that further effort was futile, he quietly left Point Loma and moved to Los Angeles. By February 1909, he had gathered around him seven individuals as part of a study group, four of whom were new to Theosophy. This nucleus, under Robert Crosbie's guidance, set to the task of restoring Theosophy along the original lines of its founders without organizational distractions. In the meantime, the original 1888 version of The Secret Doctrine was out of print and replaced by Annie Besant's \"Third and Revised Edition\". This edition was found to contain tens of thousands of alterations and major distortions. This and other material which diverged significantly from H.P. Blavatsky's original presentation was denominated Neo-Theosophy. Robert Crosbie denounced Neo-Theosophy and considered it along with other leadership claims and rivalries in the Theosophical Society to be the result of the accentuation of \"personality\", in the Theosophical sense of the lower or illusionary self. Hence the Declaration of the ULT was drawn to emphasize an \"impersonal\", self-reliant, non-hierarchical, non-organizational spirit and loyalty to the original founders and their \"unaltered\" message.\n\nIn November 1919, five months after Robert Crosbie's death, B.P Wadia, a predominant member of the Theosophical Society Adyar visited America and happened to come across ULT Los Angeles. There he discovered the works of W.Q. Judge who was considered a renegade by the Theosophical Society under Annie Besant and Col. Olcott. Furthermore, he found the reformation he was seeking of the Theosophical Society in ULT's Declaration of purpose and its mission of \"pure Theosophy\" without organizational distractions. He then went back to India with the hope of changing the attitude of the leaders of the Theosophical Society, to return to the original teachings, set right the wrong that was done to W.Q. Judge and mend the schism in the Theosophical Movement. Finding that his efforts were unsuccessful, he resigned from the Theosophical Society on 18 July 1922 and joined the ULT. Between 1922 and 1928 he stayed in America and founded ULT lodges in New York, Washington D.C and Philadelphia. And on his return trip to India via Europe, he established ULT lodges in Antwerp, Amsterdam, London and Paris. Back in India, he started ULT lodges in Mumbai and Bengaluru.\n\nThe first ULT lodge founded in 1909 by Robert Crosbie :\nFounded between 1923 and 1928 under the guidance of B.P Wadia during his stay in America :\nEstablished in 1928 during B.P Wadia's journey from America back to India via Europe:\nFirst ULT lodge in India, opened on November 17, 1929 under B.P Wadia's leadership:\nA sister lodge of the Mumbai center started in 1938 under B.P Wadia:\nNamed \"Maitri Bhavan\", this lodge was started on the 12th of August 1942 by B.P Wadia:\nStudy centers started organically by students:\n\n\n"}

He was one of the Five Northern Patriarchs of Quanzhen. He also appears as a character in works of \"wuxia\" fiction.\n\n\nWang was born with his birth name as \"Zhongfu\" in a wealthy family in 1113. He was educated in Chinese classics and martial arts.\n\nWang intended to start a rebellion against the Jurchen Jin dynasty, which conquered northern China in the Jin–Song Wars. According to tradition, in the summer of 1159 when he was 48, he met three Taoist immortals in a tavern, Zhongli Quan, Lü Dongbin, and Liu Haichan. They trained him in secret forms of Taoism. He changed his name to \"Zhe\" and adopted the Taoist name \"Chongyang\".\n\nIn 1160, Wang met one of the immortals again and was provided with a set of written instructions called \"Ganshui Xianyuan Lu\". Those written instructions included the names of two men who would later become his disciples (Ma Yu and Tan Chuduan). Wang built a tomb for himself near Mount Zhongnan and called it \"Tomb of the Living Dead\". He lived in it for three years.\n\nAt the end of the three years, Wang filled the tomb with earth and built a hut on top of it and called it \"Complete Perfection Hut\". He spent the next four years in the hut studying Taoism and imparting his knowledge to others. During that time, he met Tan Chuduan, who became his disciple after he cured Tan from illness. Qiu Chuji and Tan traveled around the local towns and villages with Wang and founded five Taoist congregations. Wang's teachings were referred to the \"Teachings of the Complete Perfection\" (after the hut) and his branch of Taoism became known as the Quanzhen School.\n\nIn 1167, Wang burnt down the hut and travelled east to Shandong, where he met Ma Yu and Ma's wife, Sun Bu'er. They became his disciples as well. He accepted a total of seven disciples who later became known as \"Seven Masters of Quanzhen\" or \"Seven Elders of Quanzhen\". They are also called the \"Seven Immortals\" or \"Seven Perfected Beings\".\n\nIn 1187, Emperor Shizong of Jin summoned Wang's disciple Wang Chuyi (and, according to some sources, also Qiu Chuji) to preach in his inner palace. Later, he requested the presence of Wang Chuyi at his deathbed. Shizong's successor, Emperor Zhangzong, banned the teaching of Quanzhen Taoism. He considered them as causing heretical and detrimental to society;He converted to Quanzhen's teachings later and let Wang Chuyi stay in Yanjing (present-day Beijing) for a year. Shizong's grandson Wanyan Shou later wrote a biography for Wang Chongyang.\n\nHe was immortalized in the Longmen Grottoes.\n\nWang was the author of many poems of Taoist instruction. According to legend, Liu Chuxuan became a follower of Wang after reading one of Wang's poems.\n\nWang's writings include:\n\nThe most notable ones among Wang's seven disciples were Sun Bu'er and Qiu Chuji. Sun's husband, Ma Yu, was one of the seven, while she became an important role model for female Taoists. Ma Yu later succeeded Wang as the leader of the Quanzhen School.\n\nQiu Chuji gained the favour of Genghis Khan and founded the White Cloud Monastery in Beijing. Genghis Khan granted tax-exempt status to all Quanzhen schools and placed Qiu in charge of all religions in China.\n\nEach of the seven disciples founded his or her own lineage of Quanzhen Taoism. They are as follows:\n\nWang is mentioned by name in the wuxia novel \"The Legend of the Condor Heroes\" and its sequel \"The Return of the Condor Heroes\", by Jin Yong. In the first novel, he was the \"Central Divine\" (中神通) of the Five Greats (五絕), the top five champions of the first martial arts contest on Mount Hua. He is depicted as a patriotic Taoist of the predominantly Han Chinese society of the Song Empire, and seeks to protect his people from the Jurchen-led Jin Empire's invasion of northern China. He founds the Quanzhen Sect, based in Chongyang Palace on Mount Zhongnan, with the aim of grooming and nurturing Taoists, who are trained in martial arts, to serve the country and uphold justice. After his death, his seven apprentices, known as the \"Seven Immortals of Quanzhen\", inherit his legacy and promote Quanzhen to become one of the leading orthodox sects in the \"jianghu\" (martial artists' community).\n\nThe sequel provides a glimpse into Wang's romance with Lin Chaoying, the founder of the Ancient Tomb Sect. In his early life, Wang had a tomb built at Mount Zhongnan and intended it to serve as a secret base of operations for the battles against the Jurchens. He lost to Lin in a martial arts contest and had to keep his promise to give the tomb to her and become a Taoist. Wang and Lin remain rivals for the rest of their lives, constantly innovating new martial arts techniques to defeat each other. However, Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü discover later that Lin apparently hates Wang but actually still loves him. This is evident from the fact that although Lin's martial arts seem to counter Wang's, they actually complement his skills.\n\nIn the manhua series \"Oriental Heroes\" by Hong Kong artist Wong Yuk-long, Wang Chongyang is noted as the creator of the 'Nine Solar Art'.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31099422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31099422", "title": "We Have a Pope (film)", "text": "We Have a Pope (film)\n\nWe Have a Pope (original title: Habemus Papam) is a 2011 Italian-French comedy-drama film directed by Nanni Moretti and starring Michel Piccoli and Moretti. Its original title is Latin for \"We have a pope\", the phrase used upon the announcement of a new pope. The story revolves around a cardinal who, against his wishes, is elected pope. A psychoanalyst is called in to help the pope overcome his panic. The film premiered in Italy in April 2011 and played in competition at the 64th Cannes Film Festival.\n\nOn the death of the pope, the conclave meets in Rome. Early ballots end with black smoke, since none of the main candidates reaches the quorum. After several rounds of voting, Cardinal Melville is elected, though he had not previously been considered a frontrunner.\n\nAt the moment of the public announcement, with the faithful are gathered in St. Peter's Square and the cardinal proto-deacon ready to announce the name of the new pope, the newly elected pope has a panic attack and fails to appear on the balcony.\n\nThe spokesman of the Holy See evades questions from the press and the curiosity of the outside world by reporting that the new pontiff felt the need to sequester himself in prayer and reflection before taking office, and by explaining that he will make his official appearance within a few hours. This does not happen.\n\nIn accordance with the laws of the Church, until the identity of the new pope is announced publicly, the ceremony of election is not over and no one in the conclave can leave the Vatican.\n\nThe College of Cardinals, deeply concerned by the crisis and the depression from which the new pope seems to be suffering, calls in the psychoanalyst Professor Brezzi (whose role is played by director Nanni Moretti). The cardinals react to the psychoanalyst with some suspicion, but still allow him to examine the new pope. Brezzi, in the presence of the cardinals, tries to initiate a psychotherapy session which, however, fails to reveal anything to explain the depression and helplessness that plague the pontiff.\n\nBrezzi reveals that his ex-wife is also a psychoanalyst and the newly elected pope is taken secretly to see her, but escapes his minders and runs away during a walk. Unaware of his absence, the cardinals kill time by playing games, ranging from cards to an international volleyball tournament organized by Brezzi.\n\nThe spokesman makes everyone believe that the Pope is in his quarters in prayer, and eventually the cardinals find Melville and give him another chance to announce his acceptance. Melville comes out onto the balcony claiming \"I am not the leader you need\", asks the crowd to pray \"for what he is about to do\", and than retreats back into St. Peter's.\n\n\n\"We Have a Pope\" was announced in May 2009 as a co-production between Sacher Film, Rai Cinema and the French company Le Pacte. Fandango joined as a co-producer later in the year. The production involved a budget of eight million euro. French actor Michel Piccoli was cast in the leading role after auditioning six scenes in Italian in August 2009. The character's name, Melville, was inspired by the French filmmaker Jean-Pierre Melville. Some of the minor characters were played by members of the production team, whom Moretti found suitable for the roles when working on the set.\n\nPrincipal photography started 1 February 2010 and was finished by the end of May. Studio constructions at the Cinecittà studios in Rome included replicas of the Sala Regia and the Sistine Chapel. Other scenes were shot in the Palazzo Farnese and Villa Medici, which otherwise house the French embassy and the French Academy in Rome, respectively.\n\nThe film reveals the overwhelming reluctance of a pope-elect to assent to his election as Supreme Pontiff. Director Nanni Moretti explained his aim with the film at the press conference following the press screening in Rome: \"I wanted to depict a fragile man, Cardinal Melville, who feels inadequate in the face of power and the role he's called to fill ... I think this feeling of inadequacy happens to all cardinals elected Pope, or at least that's what they say.\"\n\nThe procedure of papal conclave requires a two-thirds supermajority vote to elect a new pope. Then, when the Cardinal Dean asks the pope-elect if he accepts his election, the Pope-elect is free to decline, though typically Cardinals who intend to refuse their election explicitly state this to their colleagues before a two-thirds majority is reached. The Pope-elect immediately enters office and ends the conclave once he accepts his election. All ceremonies regarding his installation are purely ceremonial.\n\nThe film was released in Italy on 15 April 2011 through 01 Distribution in collaboration with Sacher Distribuzione. It was launched on 460 screens. With 1,298,524 euro in revenues during the first weekend, the film entered the Italian box-office chart as number two, behind the American film \"Rio\" which premiered simultaneously. \"We Have a Pope\" showed In Competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nIn France Les \"Cahiers du cinéma\" listed the film as the best picture of the year 2011.\n\nDeborah Young of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" called the film \"a well-written, surprisingly mainstream comedy\" and noted how it was less political than earlier works by Moretti, such as \"The Mass Is Ended\" and \"The Caiman\": \"Here the storyteller overpowers the moralist in every sense. Not a hint of clerical sex scandals clouds the surreal image of frolicking white-haired Cardinals; the most critical line in the film suggests the Church needs a leader who will bring great change, but even that plays as an offhand remark.\" Young went on to compliment the production design and cinematography, and called Moretti \"one of the most creative filmmakers working in Italy\". However, Young wrote, \"the finale is a let-down, leaving the feeling of an artist paralyzed by his own perfectionism and his desperate search for originality at all costs.\"\n\nReactions from the Roman Catholic community were mixed. Vatican correspondent Salvatore Izzo called for a boycott of the film in the newspaper \"Avvenire\", owned by the Italian Episcopal Conference. Izzo wrote: \"We shouldn't touch the pope – the rock on which Jesus founded his Church.\" He continued: \"Why should we support financially that which offends our religion?\" Vatican Radio commented on the film and found it to contain \"no irony, no caricature\" of the pope. Regarding the prospect of an official condemnation of the film from church authorities, Sandro Magister, an Italian journalist specialising in Vatican issues, said: \"If there were to be one, it would only help the producer. He would be very happy with a polemic that is completely without foundation.\"\n\n\n"}

Chen or simply as Yogi Chen, was a Chinese hermit who lived in Kalimpong, India, from 1947 until 1972, when he moved to the United States, where he lived for the remainder of his life.\n\nAccording to Ole Nydahl, Chen had, in his youth in China, been terrified of death and had at first practiced Taoist life-extending exercises. Later he turned to Buddhism and, in search of teachings, went to Tibet, where he spent several years living in a cave.\n\nSangharakshita regarded Chen as one of his teachers, and together with Khantipalo helped him compile \"Buddhist Meditation, Systematic and Practical\". Both Sangharakshita and Khantipalo describe Chen as \"eccentric.\"\n\n"}
