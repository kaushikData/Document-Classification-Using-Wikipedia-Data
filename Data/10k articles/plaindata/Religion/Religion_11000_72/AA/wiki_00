Her performances consist of unique use of human body and voice expression, close to modern dance and experimental sound techniques. Adina's work emphasizes strong connection of art and non-structural ethics of behavior, and introduces it by activating audience's high levels of attention and consciousness.\n\nBar-On began her first performances in the early 1973 as a third year student at the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design. Bar-On is now a performance art teacher at Bezalel Academy's Visual Arts Department. Bar-On studied to become a painter, although was deeply involved in conceptual art movement. Her early performances took place when the notion of \"performance\" as a medium of art expression was not yet known in Israel. Her first performances were still called \"shows\"and the invitations for these events were only saying her name, time and place of the event. Those days most art critics considered performance to be a junk-art, this genre of art was not understood nor acknowledged by art historians and critics.\n\nAfter the first performance at the courtyard of Bezalel Academy in Jerusalem, Bar-On was asked to stop doing this kind of things and academy professors called a school psychologist to examine the performer and to express professional opinion about the work. After the second performance, \"Birds\" (June–July 1973), Adina received a warning letter from the directors on te Academy, informing that if she wants to continue to study she has to go back to conventional mediums.\n\nBar-On's parents were Zionist American Jews who came to Israel at the beginning of this state, to set a country for a free nation to live in their own state (not in a ghetto in other nations' state). They did not come from Europe and did not escape from after-Holocaust Germany or Eastern Europe, but from free country of USA. Adina Bar-On was born in kibbutz, and after some years in Israel went to America to go to secondary school. She later conceptualized her identity status in a talk \"Is my Performance an Israeli Culture Manifestation?\" in 2011 at Dar al- Kalima College of Art, Bethlehem.\n\nAt the Bezalel Academy (then in the center of Jerusalem, now on the Mount Scopus) Adina was focused on painting and studied conceptual art, which was becoming the most important approach in contemporary practice. During the seventies she was interested mostly in new forms of communication art and her work was influenced by American happenings, Joseph Beuys, Tadeusz Kantor, Jerzy Grotowski, the new theater (as defined by Michael Kirby), Vito Acconci.\n\nBar-On found inspiration for her aesthetics in film, precisely in Giulietta Masina's actors work, as well as in the new manner introduced by Fellini, Antonioni and Godard of seeing film-life (art-life) relationship problem.\nShe studied dance for some time and experimented with mime (an episode in Swiss mime actor and clown Dimitri in 1976 at the Dimitri School of Theatre, Vercio, Switzerland).\n\nDuring these years Adina worked as therapeutist, social worker, gave courses for school art teachers, as well as performed in many different contexts: at the industry for workers, old people's houses, nurseries, private homes.\nHer work was described as \"strong\" and \"subtle\" at the same time (her name, \"Adina Bar-On\", in Hebrew means \"delicate with power\") and some people recognized her new aesthetics, exceptional way of creating art as a means of human communication.\n\nShe was 23 years old when she decided to complete her academic diploma at the Bezalel despite the professors' \"advice\" to quit making performances, and she prepared a special, highly conceptual photographic work (black and white photographs of her color, post-expressionist paintings hung on the walls of a middle class conservative Israeli living room of her mother's house). This work already signaled some of the subjects she will be exploring later: public and private, black-and-white and color, representation and performance.\n\nIn 1974 Adina Bar-On married Daniel Davis, a potter and author of Judaica art, with whom she later often worked on some of her performances (ex. A Woman of the Pots), and made her private life a subject of the art work. Their children, Shahar Davis and Yasmin Davis, were also engaged in the preparation of \"Woman of the Pots\". \nBar-On wrote in 2000 about a necessity and ethical motivation of her work: \"I felt that art was losing its connection with what characterizes the human being, the ability to connect intellect with emotions\".\n\nAdina's first performance took place in the plaza of old Bezalel Academy building, in early May 1973. Going beyond contemporary aesthetics, risking social position and artistic status, extending possibilities of communication - all these interpretations of Adina Bar-On's early performance places it on the border between avant-garde art and post-artistic performance art practice. An incident of being mistaken for a mentally ill by Academy professors (other artists, see: section \"Controversy\"), showed Bar-On that her performance was indeed touching a deep level of human psyche of the audience and caused an aesthetic shock of a certain kind. At the time, most of the interpretations of art history, even aware of anti-psychiatric movement in Europe, psychoanalytical writings about Antonin Artaud, experience with surrealism, counterculture movement, Beuys's idea of social sculpture etc., were only taken intellectually, and misunderstood. Adina's experiment was recognized by the audience: \"Very, very strong. (...) I am stired by the approach which I think should guide all of us - to touch the truth, and not in all kinds of formal, aesthetic, etc., pseudo-intellectiuallism. I don't know what art is, for I've heard from \"professional connoisseurs\" that this is not art. ( ... ) And I don't care if it is or it is not if art does touch upon these problems but in a different way that enables distance, form, material, causality, inner logic (formal as well).\" (Fragments of a letter Adina Bar-On received after the performance).\n\nIn this performance was prepared in collaboration with Ronit Land (Israeli dancer and choreographer, disciple of Merce Cunningham and Anna Halprin) as movement consultant. It was performed at The Israel Museum of Art, Jerusalem, as well as at the Tel-Hai '80, a contemporary art event.\n\nWorking in a collaboration with Ronit Land, this time Bar-On prepared a theatrical performance, moving on the edge of modern dance, theatre expression and performance art. Daniel Davis's environmental design was introduced. The premiere took place at Tel Hai, 83, Contemporary Art Event.\n\n\"Getting high\" as a goal of theater and ritual throughout the ages, the idea of inexpressible, were motifs of this six scenes of movement-play performance. Musical part of the performance involved early computer-based composition (using 3 connected synthesiser) composed by Yossi Marchaim and wordless vocalization of Adina and Robert Flantz.\n\nOne of Bar-On's masterpieces, combining image, movement/dance and voice interplay. Originally performed In 1990 performance was filmed by Naomi Perlov and screened at Israel Museum. Playing with an important Israeli iconographical motive, \"Woman of the Pots\" was a most important collaboration with Daniel Davis.\n\nAt this phase of Bar-On's development an important methodological change was: leaving art as conceptual art, and leading towards contextual art (everyday life questions raised to be subjects of the art). Saying that she left \"the Acconci Vito Acconci dilemma\" in performance art, Bar-On emphasised the need for new approach in performance art, where strong relations between art and life should be introduced when talking about live-art paradigm.\n\nPerformed in The Tel Aviv Museum of Art Tel Aviv Museum of Art. Video work for the performance was prepared by Alon Eilat.\nBased on an experimental voicework (recorded and mastered later in ToTamTo Studios, Warsaw), \"Sacrifice\" is a turning point in Bar-On's aesthetics and an example of highly sophisticated work using voice, body and image of the body. Voice is a leading creative element of not only expressing, but first of all transforming emotions (like pain) in the work of art.\n\nA documentary film was made from the performance in Quimper, France, witnessing Adina's visit at the Festival Mettre en Scene: Quimper.\n\nSubtle level of communication is crucial for Bar-On's performances, working with \"quantum level\" of emotions. Laszlo Beke (director of Research Institute of Art History, Hungarian Academy of Science) wrote on \"Sacrifice\": \"At the beginning after an intensive internal meditation she faced the audience (or one of its members) and waited, doing nothing, until this nothing (\"tense nothing\") became nearly unendurable. This is a kind of address that prepares the audience mentally and spiritually for the reception of forthcoming events\".\n\n\"I'm engaged in tikkun, not from above, but in a language that everybody understands. Empathy to yourself. If you don't love and it's difficult for you now, at least have empathy.\"- wrote Bar-On in her autobiographical essay \"A Soliloquy\". \"Sacrificed was performed for ten years in places including the Kuhsthalle, Budapest, Catalyst Arts Gallery: Belfast, Para/Site Art Space: Hong-Kong, Chasama Arts Space: New York.\n\nAs Bar-On described it later: \"Rest is a paraphrase of a popular and old Israeli lullaby that has become mythological – \"Rest For The Weary\". In the Shopping Mall, Opera House Tel Aviv Performing Arts Center and Central Bus Station suspended in a vertical elevated bed, way above the heads of passers by, I move as if in a state of sleep. As in a dream, out of the subconscious, I create images by my movement and my own vocal adaptation of the old Jewish Pioneer’s song.\n\nPlacing myself in these locations I had become a provocation but more than that an image of a plea or a cry for time-out, for rest, detached from ideological idioms\".\n\nIn \"About Love\" (close to previous \"Vision\") the performer was the creator of the image, and at the same time emanating certain \"aura\", direct communication with the audience, often felt as intervention in an intimate level of viewer's psyche, although he/she was a stranger or a passer-by. This performance was described by Bar-On's biographer, Idit Porat, as \"transforming suffering into beauty\".\n\nIn discussing this phase of her performance history, Adina has said: \"II want to put questions of emotion on the pyre. I think this is an acute issue. I think it is what is lacking, not alienated discussions.\"\nThe form of Bar-On's performances always explored delicacy, subtlety of meaning, allusions, conxeptualism, intellectual poetry, intellectual and spiritual signals going beyond symbolic levels of interpretation. In 2005, after a work \"Dreamy\", As Bar-On described it: \"Emotions can be a material, it is my material. What do people usually do with emotions?\"\n\nThis site-specific performance is structured to be a journey or a walk through urban space, where Bar-On, dressed in red, is a guide or a leader. Playing with this motif of a woman leadership and multiple meanings of space when observed through artist's eyes, mostly the borders, no-mans land's, areas of former conflicts or places of \"hidden history\" to be reveiled.\n\n\"Dispositions\" were performed in Nachshon, Israel; Hong-Kong; Quimper, France; Helsinki, Finland; Toronto, Canada; Belfast, Northern Ireland, Oswiecim (city of Auschwitz) and Lublin, Poland.\n\nAfter Daniel Davis's death in 2010, the artist sharpened her massage and became more direct in performance art communication process. Making performances for no more than 30 people, she focused on building strong mental contact with each spectator/witness through all channels of human expression, but now transgressing symbolism and conceptual methods. This almost \"mystical strategy\", apophatic method is now extending existentialist implications of Bar-On's art and use of pre-expressive level in performance.\n\nTo create new performances in the mid-2010s, Bar-On merged everyday life situation with social symbolism, religious iconography, dream visions and mass media images. From this time Israeli and Palestinian dialogue is often a subject of the artist's work, as well as is Bar-On's own private life themes which are transported into performance art; ex. widows of the war on both sides of the conflict - Adina Bar-On's husband, Daniel Davis, died of brain tumour caused by military service in the Israeli Army. For five years he was able to express himself only by saying \"Lo!\" (\"No!\" in Hebrew).\n\nStarting from early performances shown at the time of Yom Kippur War in 1973, through 1989 when Bar-On conducted a workshop at \"The Peace Frontier. International Symposium for Sculpture and Painting\", the performer is active in transporting her main subject of art - \"conflict of identity and conflicting identities\" - into constant existential practice.\n\nEngaged in politics of the body, social role and gender from the very beginnings of her career in the 1970s, give Adina Bar-On a significant (although unconventional) role in feminist art.\n\nBar-On is a close friend of major performance artists and thinkers: Jan Swidzinski, Zbigniew Warpechowski, Boris Nieslony, Marlyn Arsem, with whom she is often meeting on art festivals and developed an informal group of performance artists who create contextual art in uncompromising way, with no support of the \"art world\" establishment, yet recognized and respected by its representatives. Her intent on working on a most fundamental level of human communication changed Bar-On's relationships with other artists and non-artists into live-art itself.\n\nAs a performer Bar-On presented her work on the most important performance art festivals in the world, including Blurr, Biennale of Performance Art: Jaffa/Tel-Aviv (many times under curatorship of Sergio Edelstein), Israel, In the Context of Art/ Differences: Warsaw, Interaction Festival: Piotrków Trybunalski, Asiatopia International Performance Festival; Bangkok, Social Art Forum: Paris, Epipederme / Performance Art event, Lisbon, Portugal, Tupada Action and Media Art, 2009/The 6th Tupada International Visual Performance Festival; Manila, Philippines, Asiatopia, International Performance Art Festival; Bangkok, Chiangmai, Thailand, Navinki 2001, Performance-Art Festival: Minsk, Belarus, International Performance Art Festival, \"Castle of Imagination\": Ustka-Slupsk, Poland, Festival Mettre en Scene: Quimper, France, The 5th Asian Performance Art Series + Shinshu Summer Seminar 2000: Macau, Hong-Kong, and Negoya, Tokyo, Nagano in Japan, and many others.\n\nEarly in her career Adina Bar-On started to teach and worked on various art educational projects focused on the language of visual communication and live-art. She has been giving numerous workshops in Israel (including Tel Aviv University, Kalisher Art School, Camera Obscura School of Art, School of Visual Theater Jerusalem, el-Hai College, Omanut La'am Art Education Organization, Holon School For The Education of Technology, Dar al- Kalima College of Art, The Academy od Dance and Music Jerusalem, Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Yasmin Goder Dance Group) as well as around the world as visiting professor: at the Wroclaw Art Academy, Oswiecim Jewish Center (at the Oświęcim Synagogue, Mobius Artists Group, Performance Art Conference: Essen, Braunschweig University/ Department of Fine Arts, Germany, and workshop leader: Arsenal Gallery in Bialystok, Wei Wei Dance Company, Hong Kong).\n\nOne of recent major projects, such as \"Aesthetics and Bias\" involve institutions such as Bezalel Academy, Eugeniusz Geppert Academy of Fine Arts in Wrocław, University of Fine Arts in Poznań, Warsaw Academy, Kraków Academy of Fine Arts, to work together in a process of developing new aesthetics.\n\nStarting with the performance based film \"A Woman of the Pots\", Bar-On prepared a number of films and video installation which are important for understanding her approach to the art: \"Portrait\" (1999), \"View\" (2001) (as an aftermath of a performance under the same name), \"Room\" and \"Motherland\" (both in 2001). \nA relationship between live-art and film/video image was already explored in \"Breath\" (1994) and possibly this performance leaves a trace of what the artist thinks about film representation of live-art.\n\nBar-On played an important role in Amos Gitai 1990 film \"Birth of a Golem\" (Naissance d'un golem: Carnet de notes), giving an expressive improvised performance in the movie, and appearing on a screen in the moment when the story of a Golem is told. She also helped to direct Annie Lennox in her role as Golem's figure in the cave scene.\n\nAdina Bar-On's full documentation of work on film in now hosted by The Art of Action Archives, organization focused on anthropological research and preservation of performance art masterpieces.\n\nDuring the years of teaching about visual communication, Bar-On managed to contact young artists of different sensitivity and working on future aesthetics of a new era. Still not theoretically described nor defined aesthetics of Bar-On is an inspiration for new generation of artists.\n\n\nPublishers: Hakibbutz Hameuchad Publishing House Ltd, Herzliya Museum of Art 2001. .\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1914015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1914015", "title": "Ashtamangala", "text": "Ashtamangala\n\nThe Ashtamangala are a sacred suite of \"Eight Auspicious Signs\" endemic to a number of Indian religions such as Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism. The symbols or \"symbolic attributes\" () are yidam and teaching tools. Not only do these attributes (or energetic signatures) point to qualities of enlightened mindstream, but they are the investiture that ornaments these enlightened \"qualities\" (Sanskrit: \"guṇa\"; ). Many cultural enumerations and variations of the Ashtamangala are extant.\nTibetan Buddhists make use of a particular set of eight auspicious symbols, \"ashtamangala\", in household and public art. Some common interpretations are given along with each symbol although different teachers may give different interpretations:\n\nThe right-turning white conch shell (Sanskrit: ; ) represents the beautiful, deep, melodious, interpenetrating and pervasive sound of the dharma, which awakens disciples from the deep slumber of ignorance and urges them to accomplish their own welfare and the welfare of others.\n\nIn Hinduism, the conch is an attribute of Vishnu along with the Sudarshana Chakra. Vaishnavism holds that Gautama Buddha is an avatar of Vishnu.\n\nThe endless knot (Sanskrit: \"śrīvatsa\"; ) denotes \"the auspicious mark represented by a curled noose emblematic of love\". It is a symbol of the ultimate unity of everything. Moreover, it represents the intertwining of wisdom and compassion, the mutual dependence of religious doctrine and secular affairs, the union of wisdom and method, the inseparability of śūnyatā \"emptiness\" and pratītyasamutpāda \"interdependent origination\", and the union of wisdom and compassion in enlightenment (see namkha). This knot, net or web metaphor also conveys the Buddhist teaching of interpenetration.\n\nThe two golden fish (Sanskrit: gaurmatsya; ) symbolise the auspiciousness of all sentient beings in a state of fearlessness without danger of drowning in saṃsāra. The two golden fishes are linked with the Ganges and Yamuna nadi, prana and carp: In Islam the (alive) fish has a significant role in the meeting between Moses and Khidr.\n\nThe lotus flower (Sanskrit: \"padma\"; ), represent the primordial purity of body, speech, and mind, floating above the muddy waters of attachment and desire. The lotus symbolizes purity and renunciation. Although the lotus has its roots in the mud at the bottom of a pond, its flower lies immaculate above the water. The Buddhist lotus bloom has 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 64, 100, or 1,000 petals. The same figures can refer to the body's 'internal lotuses', that is to say, its energy centres (chakra).\n\nThe jewelled parasol (Sanskrit: \"chatraratna\"; ), which is similar in ritual function to the baldachin or canopy: represents the protection of beings from harmful forces and illness. It represents the canopy or firmament of the sky and therefore the expansiveness and unfolding of space and the element æther. It represents the expansiveness, unfolding and protective quality of the sahasrara: all take refuge in the dharma under the auspiciousness of the parasol.\n\nThe treasure vase () represents health, longevity, wealth, prosperity, wisdom and the phenomenon of space. The treasure vase, or pot, symbolizes the Buddha's infinite quality of teaching the dharma: no matter how many teachings he shared, the treasure never lessened.\n\nThe iconography representation of the treasure vase is often very similar to the kumbha, one of the few possessions permitted a bhikkhu or bhikkhuni in Theravada Buddhism. The wisdom urn or treasure vase is used in many empowerment (Vajrayana) and initiations.\n\nThe dharmachakra or \"Wheel of the Law\" (Sanskrit; ) represents Gautama Buddha and the Dharma teaching. This symbol is commonly used by Tibetan Buddhists, where it sometimes also includes an inner wheel of the Gankyil (Tibetan). Nepalese Buddhists don't use the Wheel of Law in the eight auspicious symbols.\n\nInstead of the dharmachakra, a fly-whisk may be used as one of the ashtamangala to symbolize Tantric manifestations. It is made of a yak's tail attached to a silver staff, and used in ritual recitation and during fanning the deities in pujas. Prayer wheels take the form of a dharmachakra guise. The Sudarshana Chakra is a Hindu wheel-symbol.\n\nThe dhvaja (Sanskrit; ) \"banner, flag\" was a military standard of ancient Indian warfare. The symbol represents the Buddha's victory over the four māras, or hindrances in the path of enlightenment. These hindrances are pride, desire, disturbing emotions, and the fear of death. Within the Tibetan tradition, a list of eleven different forms of the victory banner is given to represent eleven specific methods for overcoming defilement. Many variations of the dhvaja's design can be seen on the roofs of Tibetan monasteries to symbolise the Buddha's victory over four māras. Banners are placed at the four corners of monastery and temple roofs. The cylindrical banners placed on monastery roofs are often made of beaten copper.\n\nDifferent traditions order the eight symbols differently.\n\nHere is the sequential order of the Eight Auspicious Symbols of Nepali Buddhism:\n\nThe sequential order for Chinese Buddhism was defined in the Qing dynasty as:\n\nIn Indian and Hindu tradition, the Ashtamangala may be used during certain occasions including: pujas, weddings (of Hindus), and coronations. The ashtamangala finds wide mention in the texts associated with Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. They have been depicted in decorative motifs and cultural artifacts.\n\n\nIn Jainism too, the Ashtamangala are a set of eight auspicious symbols. There is some variation among different traditions concerning the eight symbols.\n\nIn the Digambara tradition, the eight symbols are:\n\nIn the Śvētāmbara tradition, the eight symbols are:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6811468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6811468", "title": "Asteya", "text": "Asteya\n\nAsteya is the Sanskrit term for \"non-stealing\". It is a virtue in Jainism . The practice of \"asteya\" demands that one must not steal, nor have the intent to steal another's property through action, speech and thoughts.\n\nAsteya is considered as one of five major vows of Jainism. It is also considered one of ten forms of temperance (virtuous self-restraint) in Indian philosophy.\n\nThe word \"asteya\" is a compound derived from Sanskrit language, where \"a\" refers to \"non-\" and \"steya\" refers to \"practice of stealing\" or \"something that can be stolen\". Thus, \"asteya\" means \"non-stealing\".\n\nIn Jainism, it is one of the five vows that all Śrāvakas and Śrāvikās (householders) as well as monastics must observe. The five transgressions of this vow as mentioned in the Jain text, \"Tattvārthsūtra\" are: \"Prompting another to steal, receiving stolen goods, underbuying in a disordered state, using false weights and measures, and deceiving others with artificial or imitation goods\".\nThis is explained in the Jain text, Sarvārthasiddhi as (translated by S.A. Jain): \n\nAsteya is defined in Hindu scripts as \"the abstinence, in one's deeds or words or thoughts, from unauthorized appropriation of things of value from another human being\". It is a widely discussed virtue in ethical theories of Hinduism. For example, in the Yoga Sūtras (II.30), \"Asteya\" (non-stealing) is listed as the third Yamas or virtue of self-restraint, along with Ahimsa (nonviolence), Satya (non-falsehoods, truthfulness), Brahmacharya (sexual chastity in one's feelings and actions) and Aparigraha (non-possessiveness, non-craving).\n\nAsteya is thus one of the five essential restraints (\"yamas\", \"the don'ts\") in Hinduism, that with five essential practices (\"niyamas\", \"the dos\") are suggested for right, virtuous, enlightened living.\n\nAsteya in practice, states Patricia Corner, implies to \"not steal\", \"not cheat\" nor unethically manipulate other's property or others for one's own gain. Asteya as virtue demands that not only one \"not steal\" through one's action, one shouldn't want to encourage cheating through speech or writing, or want to cheat even in one's thinking. Smith states that the virtue of \"asteya\" arises out of the understanding that all misappropriation is an expression of craving and a feeling of lack of compassion for other beings. To steal or want to steal expresses lack of faith in oneself, one's ability to learn and create property. To steal another's property is also stealing from one's own potential ability to develop. The Sutras reason that misappropriation, conspiring to misappropriate or wanting to misappropriate, at its root reflects the sin of \"lobha\" (bad greed), \"moha\" (material delusion) or \"krodha\" (bad anger).\n\nGandhi held \"ahimsa\" as essential to the human right to life and liberty without fear, \"asteya\" as human right to property without fear. Asteya follows from Ahimsa, in Gandhi's views, because stealing is a form of violence and injury to another person. Asteya is not merely \"theft by action\", but it includes \"theft by intent\" and \"theft by manipulation\". Persistent exploitation of the weak or poor is a form of \"asteya in one's thought\".\n\nDāna, that is charity to a deserving person without any expectation in return, is a recommended \"niyama\" in Hinduism. The motive behind Dāna is reverse to that of \"stealing from others\". Dāna is a complementary practice to the yamas (restraint) of \"asteya\".\n\nAsteya and Aparigraha are two of several important virtues in Hinduism and Jainism. They both involve interaction between a person and material world, either as property, fame or ideas; yet Asteya and Aparigraha are different concepts. Asteya is the virtue of non-stealing and not wanting to appropriate, or take by force or deceit or exploitation, by deeds or words or thoughts, what is owned by and belongs to someone else. Aparigraha, in contrast, is the virtue of non-possessiveness and non-clinging to one's own property, non-accepting any gifts or particularly improper gifts offered by others, and of non-avarice, non-craving in the motivation of one's deeds, words and thoughts.\n"}

According to the 2014 General Sociological Survey, the number of atheists and agnostics in the U.S. had remained relatively flat in the previous 23 years. In 1991, only 2% identified as atheist, and 4% identified as agnostic. In 2014, only 3.1% identified as atheists, and 5% identified as agnostics. \nIn 2009, Pew stated that only 5% of the US population did not have a belief in a god and out of that small group only 24% self-identified as \"atheist\", while 15% self-identified as \"agnostic\" and 35% self-identified as \"nothing in particular\". According to the 2008 ARIS, only 2% the US population was atheist, while 10% were agnostics. A survey using binary wording found that around 26% of Americans don't believe in god, but they were not comfortable with directly admitting it. However, methodological problems have been identified with this particular study since people do not have binary relationships to questions on God and instead have more complex responses to such questions.\n\nAccurate demographics of atheism are difficult to obtain since conceptions of atheism and self-identification are context dependent by culture.\n\nA June–September 2014 Pew Research Center survey found that 69% of atheist Americans identity as Democratic or lean Democratic, 17% have no lean, 15% identity as Republican, 56% liberal, 29% moderate, 10% conservative, and 5% don't know. Among Americans who don't believe in god/gods, 65% identity as Democratic or lean Democratic, 17% have no lean, 18% identity as Republican, 50% liberal, 31% moderate, 13% conservative, and 6% don't know. That makes atheist and nonbelievers in god/gods Americans as belief groups to be the most politically liberal belief group in America and the least politically aligned belief group with Republicans and conservatism in the United States.\n\nA October 2013 Public Religion Research Institute American Values Survey found 58% of American libertarians report they believe in a personal god, 25% believe god is an impersonal force in the universe, and 16% report that they do not believe in a god.

{"id": "145159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=145159", "title": "Atropine", "text": "Atropine\n\nAtropine is a medication to treat certain types of nerve agent and pesticide poisonings as well as some types of slow heart rate and to decrease saliva production during surgery. It is typically given intravenously or by injection into a muscle. Eye drops are also available which are used to treat uveitis and early amblyopia. The intravenous solution usually begins working within a minute and lasts half an hour to an hour. Large doses may be required to treat some poisonings.\nCommon side effects include a dry mouth, large pupils, urinary retention, constipation, and a fast heart rate. It should generally not be used in people with angle closure glaucoma. While there is no evidence that its use during pregnancy causes birth defects, it has not been well studied. It is likely safe during breastfeeding. It is an antimuscarinic (a type of anticholinergic) that works by inhibiting the parasympathetic nervous system.\nAtropine occurs naturally in a number of plants of the nightshade family including deadly nightshade, Jimson weed, and mandrake. It was first isolated in 1833. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication and is not very expensive. A one-milligram vial costs between US$0.06 and US$0.44, wholesale, in the developing world.\n\nTopical atropine is used as a cycloplegic, to temporarily paralyze the accommodation reflex, and as a mydriatic, to dilate the pupils. Atropine degrades slowly, typically wearing off in 7 to 14 days, so it is generally used as a therapeutic mydriatic, whereas tropicamide (a shorter-acting cholinergic antagonist) or phenylephrine (an α-adrenergic agonist) is preferred as an aid to ophthalmic examination.\n\nIn refractive and accommodative amblyopia, when occlusion is not appropriate sometimes atropine is given to induce blur in the good eye. Evidence suggests that atropine penalization is just as effective as occlusion in improving visual acuity.\n\nAtropine eye drops have been shown to be effective in slowing the progression of myopia in children in several studies, but it is not available for this use, and side effects would limit its use.\n\nInjections of atropine are used in the treatment of bradycardia (a heart rate < 60 beats per minute).\n\nAtropine was previously included in international resuscitation guidelines for use in cardiac arrest associated with asystole and PEA, but was removed from these guidelines in 2010 due to a lack of evidence for its effectiveness. For symptomatic bradycardia, the usual dosage is 0.5 to 1 mg IV push, may repeat every 3 to 5 minutes up to a total dose of 3 mg (maximum 0.04 mg/kg).\n\nAtropine is also useful in treating second-degree heart block Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach block), and also third-degree heart block with a high purkinje or AV-nodal escape rhythm. It is usually not effective in second-degree heart block Mobitz type 2, and in third-degree heart block with a low Purkinje or ventricular escape rhythm.\n\nAtropine has also been used in an effort to prevent a low heart rate during intubation of children; however, evidence does not support this use.\n\nAtropine's actions on the parasympathetic nervous system inhibit salivary and mucus glands. The drug may also inhibit sweating via the sympathetic nervous system. This can be useful in treating hyperhidrosis, and can prevent the death rattle of dying patients. Even though atropine has not been officially indicated for either of these purposes by the FDA, it has been used by physicians for these purposes.\n\nAtropine is not an actual antidote for organophosphate poisoning. However, by blocking the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, atropine also serves as a treatment for poisoning by organophosphate insecticides and nerve gases, such as tabun (GA), sarin (GB), soman (GD) and VX. Troops who are likely to be attacked with chemical weapons often carry autoinjectors with atropine and obidoxime, for rapid injection into the muscles of the thigh. In a developed case of nerve-gas poisoning, maximum atropinization is desirable. Atropine is often used in conjunction with pralidoxime chloride.\n\nSome of the nerve agents attack and destroy acetylcholinesterase by phosphorylation, so the action of acetylcholine becomes excessive and prolonged. Pralidoxime (2-PAM) can be effective against organophosphate poisoning because it can re-cleave this phosphorylation. Atropine can be used to reduce the effect of the poisoning by blocking muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which would otherwise be overstimulated, by excessive acetylcholine accumulation.\n\nAdverse reactions to atropine include ventricular fibrillation, supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia, dizziness, nausea, blurred vision, loss of balance, dilated pupils, photophobia, dry mouth and potentially extreme confusion, deliriant hallucinations, and excitation especially among the elderly. Most of available ampules are carried on sulphate which can cause histamine release and anaphylaxis to susceptible patients or patients with allergy to sulpha products. These latter effects are because atropine is able to cross the blood–brain barrier. Because of the hallucinogenic properties, some have used the drug recreationally, though this is potentially dangerous and often unpleasant.\n\nIn overdoses, atropine is poisonous. Atropine is sometimes added to potentially addictive drugs, particularly antidiarrhea opioid drugs such as diphenoxylate or difenoxin, wherein the secretion-reducing effects of the atropine can also aid the antidiarrhea effects.\n\nAlthough atropine treats bradycardia (slow heart rate) in emergency settings, it can cause paradoxical heart rate slowing when given at very low doses (i.e. <0.5 mg), presumably as a result of central action in the CNS. One proposed mechanism for atropine's paradoxical bradycardia effect at low doses involves blockade of inhibitory presynaptic muscarinic autoreceptors, thereby blocking a system that inhibits the parasympathetic response.\n\nAtropine is incapacitating at doses of 10 to 20 mg per person. Its LD is estimated to be 453 mg per person (by mouth) with a probit slope of 1.8.\nThe antidote to atropine is physostigmine or pilocarpine.\n\nA common mnemonic used to describe the physiologic manifestations of atropine overdose is: \"hot as a hare, blind as a bat, dry as a bone, red as a beet, and mad as a hatter\". These associations reflect the specific changes of warm, dry skin from decreased sweating, blurry vision, decreased sweating/lacrimation, vasodilation, and central nervous system effects on muscarinic receptors, type 4 and 5. This set of symptoms is known as anticholinergic toxidrome, and may also be caused by other drugs with anticholinergic effects, such as hyoscine hydrobromide (scopolamine), diphenhydramine, phenothiazine antipsychotics and benztropine.\n\nAtropine is contraindicated in patients pre-disposed to narrow angle glaucoma.\n\nIn general, atropine counters the \"rest and digest\" activity of glands regulated by the parasympathetic nervous system. This occurs because atropine is a competitive, reversible antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (acetylcholine being the main neurotransmitter used by the parasympathetic nervous system).\n\nAtropine is a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor types M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5. It is classified as an anticholinergic drug (parasympatholytic).\n\nIn cardiac uses, it works as a nonselective muscarinic acetylcholinergic antagonist, increasing firing of the sinoatrial node (SA) and conduction through the atrioventricular node (AV) of the heart, opposes the actions of the vagus nerve, blocks acetylcholine receptor sites, and decreases bronchial secretions.\n\nIn the eye, atropine induces mydriasis by blocking contraction of the circular pupillary sphincter muscle, which is normally stimulated by acetylcholine release, thereby allowing the radial iris dilator muscle to contract and dilate the pupil. Atropine induces cycloplegia by paralyzing the ciliary muscles, whose action inhibits accommodation to allow accurate refraction in children, helps to relieve pain associated with iridocyclitis, and treats ciliary block (malignant) glaucoma. \n\nAtropine is an enantiomeric mixture of \"d\"-hyoscyamine and \"l\"-hyoscyamine, with most of its physiological effects due to \"l\"-hyoscyamine. Its pharmacological effects are due to binding to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. It is an antimuscarinic agent. Significant levels are achieved in the CNS within 30 minutes to 1 hour and disappears rapidly from the blood with a half-life of 2 hours. About 60% is excreted unchanged in the urine, most of the rest appears in urine as hydrolysis and conjugation products. Noratropine (24%), atropine-N-oxide (15%), tropine (2%) and tropic acid (3%) appear to be the major metabolites, while 50% of the administered dose is excreted as apparently unchanged atropine. No conjugates were detectable. Evidence that atropine is present as (+)-hyoscyamine was found, suggesting that stereoselective metabolism of atropine probably occurs. Effects on the iris and ciliary muscle may persist for longer than 72 hours.\n\nThe most common atropine compound used in medicine is atropine sulfate (monohydrate) (CHNO)·HSO·HO, the full chemical name is 1α H, 5α H-Tropan-3-α ol (±)-tropate(ester), sulfate monohydrate.\n\nThe vagus (parasympathetic) nerves that innervate the heart release acetylcholine (ACh) as their primary neurotransmitter. ACh binds to muscarinic receptors (M2) that are found principally on cells comprising the sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes. Muscarinic receptors are coupled to the Gi-protein; therefore, vagal activation decreases cAMP. Gi-protein activation also leads to the activation of KACh channels that increase potassium efflux and hyperpolarizes the cells.\n\nIncreases in vagal activities to the SA node decreases the firing rate of the pacemaker cells by decreasing the slope of the pacemaker potential (phase 4 of the action potential); this decreases heart rate (negative chronotropy). The change in phase 4 slope results from alterations in potassium and calcium currents, as well as the slow-inward sodium current that is thought to be responsible for the pacemaker current (If). By hyperpolarizing the cells, vagal activation increases the cell's threshold for firing, which contributes to the reduction in the firing rate. Similar electrophysiological effects also occur at the AV node; however, in this tissue, these changes are manifested as a reduction in impulse conduction velocity through the AV node (negative dromotropy). In the resting state, there is a large degree of vagal tone on the heart, which is responsible for low resting heart rates.\n\nThere is also some vagal innervation of the atrial muscle, and to a much lesser extent, the ventricular muscle. Vagus activation, therefore, results in modest reductions in atrial contractility (inotropy) and even smaller decreases in ventricular contractility.\n\nMuscarinic receptor antagonists bind to muscarinic receptors thereby preventing ACh from binding to and activating the receptor. By blocking the actions of ACh, muscarinic receptor antagonists very effectively block the effects of vagal nerve activity on the heart. By doing so, they increase heart rate and conduction velocity.\n\n\"Mandragora\" (mandrake) was described by Theophrastus in the fourth century B.C. for treatment of wounds, gout, and sleeplessness, and as a love potion. By the first century A.D. Dioscorides recognized wine of mandrake as an anaesthetic for treatment of pain or sleeplessness, to be given prior to surgery or cautery. The use of Solanaceae containing tropane alkaloids for anesthesia, often in combination with opium, persisted throughout the Roman and Islamic Empires and continued in Europe until superseded by the use of ether, chloroform, and other modern anesthetics.\n\nAtropine extracts from the Egyptian henbane were used by Cleopatra in the last century B.C. to dilate her pupils, in the hope that she would appear more alluring. In the Renaissance, women used the juice of the berries of \"Atropa belladonna\" to enlarge the pupils of their eyes, for cosmetic reasons. This practice resumed briefly in the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century in Paris.\n\nThe mydriatic effects of atropine were studied among others by the German chemist Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge (1795–1867). In 1831, the German pharmacist Heinrich F. G. Mein (1799-1864) succeeded in preparing atropine in pure crystalline form.\n\nAtropine is found in many members of the Solanaceae family. The most commonly found sources are \"Atropa belladonna\", \"Datura innoxia\", \"D. metel\", and \"D. stramonium\". Other sources include members of the \"Brugmansia\" and \"Hyoscyamus\" genera.\n\nAtropine can be synthesized by the reaction of tropine with tropic acid in the presence of hydrochloric acid.\n\nThe biosynthesis of atropine starting from \"l\"-phenylalanine first undergoes a transamination forming phenylpyruvic acid which is then reduced to phenyl-lactic acid. Coenzyme A then couples phenyl-lactic acid with tropine forming littorine, which then undergoes a radical rearrangement initiated with a P450 enzyme forming hyoscyamine aldehyde. A dehydrogenase then reduces the aldehyde to a primary alcohol making (−)-hyoscyamine, which upon racemization forms atropine.\n\nThe species name \"belladonna\" (\"beautiful woman\" in Italian) comes from the original use of deadly nightshade to dilate the pupils of the eyes for cosmetic effect. Both atropine and the genus name for deadly nightshade derive from Atropos, one of the three Fates who, according to Greek mythology, chose how a person was to die.\n\n\n"}

The Booth family regularly moved from place to place as William Booth's ministry necessitated until the family finally settled in London in 1865. Bramwell Booth was involved in The Salvation Army right from its origins as the obscure Christian Mission, established in Whitechapel in 1865, into an international organisation with numerous and varied social activities. He was educated at home, briefly at a preparatory school and at the City of London School, where he was bullied.\n\nKnown to his family as 'Willie', as a youth he suffered poor health and had a slight hearing loss. In 1870, aged just 14, Bramwell Booth started to help in the management of his father's Christian Mission and in the cheap food kitchens set up in its early days. He had intended to study medicine and had a fear of public speaking, but despite these obstacles he became William Booth's amanuensis, adviser and administrator. He became an active full-time collaborator with his father in 1874, and an officer when the Christian Mission became The Salvation Army in 1878.\n\nThe name \"The Salvation Army\" developed from an incident in May 1878. William Booth was dictating a letter to his secretary George Scott Railton and said, \"We are a volunteer army.\" Bramwell Booth heard his father and said, \"Volunteer? I'm no volunteer, I'm a regular!\" Railton was instructed to cross out the word \"volunteer\" and substitute the word \"salvation\".\n\nIn 1881, General William Booth appointed Bramwell as his Chief of the Staff of The Salvation Army. Bramwell would hold this title until his father's death, when he himself was named General in his father's will. In 1885 Bramwell was involved with William Thomas Stead in an attempt to publicise the prostitution of young girls. The lurid revelations of how thirteen-year-old Eliza Armstrong was sold for £5 resulted in the 1885 Criminal Law Amendment Act, which raised the age of consent to sixteen years. After the revelations, Booth, Stead, and Rebecca Jarrett, a converted brothel-keeper who assisted them, were arrested on several charges. Booth was acquitted but the others served short prison terms.\n\nOn 12 October 1882 Bramwell married Captain Florence Eleanor Soper, the eldest daughter of Dr Soper, a medical practitioner of Blaina, Monmouthshire. The congregation at Clapton Congress Hall were charged one shilling each for admission to the ceremony. She had joined The Salvation Army in 1880 and worked in France with Bramwell's sister Catherine Booth. After her marriage she took charge of the women's social work. All of their seven children (five daughters and two sons) became active workers in the army. Their eldest child was Commissioner Catherine Bramwell-Booth.\n\nUpon his death in 1912, William Booth appointed Bramwell his successor as General, by way of a sealed envelope. This process was the legal way in which a successor to the General was chosen, as outlined by the Christian Mission's founding deed of 1878. Like his father, Bramwell Booth ruled autocratically, and expected complete obedience. However, what officers had tolerated from William Booth, by then known as 'The Founder', they would not tolerate from Bramwell.\n\nThe early years of Bramwell Booth's Generalship were complicated by World War I, which threatened the international nature of The Salvation Army, with Salvationists in both Germany and Great Britain. However, he was able to steer a course that offended neither the Germans nor outraged British public opinion, saying in his Christmas message of 1915, \"Every land is my fatherland, for all lands are my Father's.\".\n\nLike his father before him, Bramwell would not tolerate any perceived insubordination and he summarily retired Salvation Army officers with little reason or sent officers too young to be retired to distant appointments; such officers were said to be in 'the freezer'. Bramwell faced allegations of nepotism, in that he appointed his own children to posts for which others were better qualified. This system could be seen as being inherited from his father, who similarly appointed his own children to high ranking positions. This led to accusations that The Salvation Army was a Booth family-business; however, William Booth had once said to his children that \"The Salvation Army does not belong to you, or to me, it belongs to the world\" and was very wary of the leadership of the Army becoming a dynasty.\n\nDiscontent simmered among Salvation Army senior officers, including the chief-of-the-staff Edward Higgins and George Carpenter, who incidentally had been sent to 'the freezer' by his appointment to Sydney in a role he previously held 22 years earlier. These two officers later became Generals of The Salvation Army. Another notable Army leader that disagreed with Bramwell's leadership was Commissioner Charles Jeffries who would later be British Commissioner. In his final years as General he increasingly gave control of The Salvation Army to his wife, Florence Booth, who was given power of attorney when he was away travelling. She had been the Army's 'First Lady' since the death of his mother Catherine Booth in 1890, and had started several Army organisations including the Home League, Girl Guards, and League of Mercy.\n\nAs the years passed the Army's senior officers, including Bramwell's sister Evangeline Booth and his former brother-in-law Frederick Booth-Tucker, began to question his leadership. In May 1928 Bramwell's health began to deteriorate, and by September he was suffering from insomnia and depression. His poor health offered those in the Army who were dissatisfied with his leadership an opportunity to act, and on 8 January 1929 the first High Council of The Salvation Army convened, and firstly asked the General to resign due to his ill health, which, they said, was hampering him in the performance of his duties and decisions. He refused to resign, believing that his health would soon be fully recovered, so on 13 February 1929 the High Council voted by 52 votes to 5 that Bramwell's term of office as General should now end, based on Bramwell being 'unfit' to hold the position. Booth was succeeded in the election of Edward Higgins, his Chief of the Staff.\nGeneral Bramwell Booth then took the High Council to court, which lost him a lot of respect; he also lost the court case. His sister, Evangeline Booth later succeeded General Higgins to serve as the fourth General of The Salvation Army. Henceforth the General of The Salvation Army would be elected by the High Council.\n\nOn 29 April 1929 the now former General Bramwell Booth received a letter from Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin stating that King George V had appointed him a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour.\n\nOn 16 June 1929 his family was summoned to his bedside, and on that Sunday evening General Bramwell Booth died at his home, The Homestead, Hadley Wood, near Barnet, Hertfordshire. For the Friday and Saturday following his death Bramwell Booth's body lay in state at The Salvation Army's Congress Hall. On the Saturday evening 10,000 Salvationists and friends filled the Royal Albert Hall to bid farewell to their beloved former General.\n\nGeneral Bramwell Booth was buried opposite his parents at Abney Park Cemetery, Stoke Newington, London. The grave lies near the southern entrance. Huge crowds attended his funeral. He was commemorated by the Bramwell Booth Memorial Hall, Queen Victoria Street, London.\n"}

Its appearance was noted by the American National Center for Science Education in a news article on November 2, 2006.\n\nThe BCSE protested when the prominent intelligent design group Truth in Science sent information packs to every UK secondary school in September, 2006.

{"id": "7482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7482", "title": "Christian mythology", "text": "Christian mythology\n\nChristian mythology is the body of myths associated with Christianity. The term encompasses a broad variety of legends and stories, especially those considered sacred narratives. Mythological themes and elements occur throughout Christian literature, including recurring myths such as ascending to a mountain, the \"axis mundi\", myths of combat, descent into the Underworld, accounts of a dying-and-rising god, flood stories, stories about the founding of a tribe or city, and myths about great heroes (or saints) of the past, paradises, and self-sacrifice.\n\nVarious authors have also used it to refer to other mythological and allegorical elements found in the Bible, such as the story of the Leviathan. The term has been applied to myths and legends from the Middle Ages, such as the story of Saint George and the Dragon, the stories of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, and the legends of the \"Parsival\". Multiple commentators have classified John Milton's epic poem \"Paradise Lost\" as a work of Christian mythology. The term has also been applied to modern stories revolving around Christian themes and motifs, such as the writings of C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Madeleine L'Engle, and George MacDonald.\n\nOver the centuries, Christianity has divided into many denominations. Not all of these denominations hold the same set of sacred traditional narratives. For example, the books of the Bible accepted by the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox churches include a number of texts and stories (such as those narrated in the Book of Judith and Book of Tobit) that many Protestant denominations do not accept as canonical.\n\nChristian theologian and professor of New Testament, Rudolf Bultmann wrote that:\n\nThe cosmology of the New Testament is essentially mythical in character. The world is viewed as a three storied structure, with the earth in the center, the heaven above, and the underworld beneath. Heaven is the abode of God and of celestial beings -- the angels. The underworld is hell, the place of torment. Even the earth is more than the scene of natural, everyday events, of the trivial round and common task. It is the scene of the supernatural activity of God and his angels on the one hand, and of Satan and his demons on the other. These supernatural forces intervene in the course of nature and in all that men think and will and do. Miracles are by no means rare. Man is not in control of his own life. Evil spirits may take possession of him. Satan may inspire him with evil thoughts. Alternatively, God may inspire his thought and guide his purposes. He may grant him heavenly visions. He may allow him to hear his word of succor or demand. He may give him the supernatural power of his Spirit. History does not follow a smooth unbroken course; it is set in motion and controlled by these supernatural powers. This æon is held in bondage by Satan, sin, and death (for \"powers\" is precisely what they are), and hastens towards its end. That end will come very soon, and will take the form of a cosmic catastrophe. It will be inaugurated by the \"woes\" of the last time. Then the Judge will come from heaven, the dead will rise, the last judgment will take place, and men will enter into eternal salvation or damnation.\n\nIn its broadest academic sense, the word \"myth\" simply means a traditional story. However, many scholars restrict the term \"myth\" to sacred stories. Folklorists often go further, defining myths as \"tales believed as true, usually sacred, set in the distant past or other worlds or parts of the world, and with extra-human, inhuman, or heroic characters\".\n\nIn classical Greek, \"muthos\", from which the English word \"myth\" derives, meant \"story, narrative.\" By the time of Christ, \"muthos\" had started to take on the connotations of \"fable, fiction,\" and early Christian writers often avoided calling a story from canonical scripture a \"myth\". Paul warned Timothy to have nothing to do with \"godless and silly myths\" (\"bebēthous kai graōdeis muthous)\". This negative meaning of \"myth\" passed into popular usage. Some modern Christian scholars and writers have attempted to rehabilitate the term \"myth\" outside academia, describing stories in canonical scripture (especially the Christ story) as \"true myth\"; examples include C. S. Lewis and Andrew Greeley. Several modern Christian writers, such as C.S. Lewis, have described elements of Christianity, particularly the story of Christ, as \"myth\" which is also \"true\" (\"true myth\"). Others object to associating Christianity with \"myth\" for a variety of reasons: the association of the term \"myth\" with polytheism, the use of the term \"myth\" to indicate falsehood or non-historicity, and the lack of an agreed-upon definition of \"myth\". As examples of Biblical myths, Every cites the creation account in Genesis 1 and 2 and the story of Eve's temptation. Many Christians believe parts of the Bible to be symbolic or metaphorical (such as the Creation in Genesis).\n\nChristian tradition contains many stories that do not come from canonical Christian texts yet still illustrate Christian themes. These non-canonical Christian myths include legends, folktales, and elaborations on canonical Christian mythology. Christian tradition has produced a rich body of legends that were never incorporated into the official scriptures. Legends were a staple of medieval literature. Examples include hagiographies such as the stories of Saint George or Saint Valentine. A case in point is the historical and canonized Brendan of Clonfort, a 6th century Irish churchman and founder of abbeys. Round his authentic figure was woven a tissue that is arguably legendary rather than historical: the \"Navigatio\" or \"Journey of Brendan\". The legend discusses mythic events in the sense of supernatural encounters. In this narrative, Brendan and his shipmates encounter sea monsters, a paradisal island and a floating ice islands and a rock island inhabited by a holy hermit: literal-minded devotés still seek to identify \"Brendan's islands\" in actual geography. This voyage was recreated by Tim Severin, suggesting that whales, icebergs and Rockall were encountered.\n\nFolktales form a major part of non-canonical Christian tradition. Folklorists define folktales (in contrast to \"true\" myths) as stories that are considered purely fictitious by their tellers and that often lack a specific setting in space or time. Christian-themed folktales have circulated widely among peasant populations. One widespread folktale genre is that of the Penitent Sinner (classified as Type 756A, B, C, in the Aarne-Thompson index of tale types); another popular group of folktales describe a clever mortal who outwits the Devil. Not all scholars accept the folkloristic convention of applying the terms \"myth\" and \"folktale\" to different categories of traditional narrative.\n\nChristian tradition produced many popular stories elaborating on canonical scripture. According to an English folk belief, certain herbs gained their current healing power from having been used to heal Christ's wounds on Mount Calvary. In this case, a non-canonical story has a connection to a non-narrative form of folklore — namely, folk medicine. Arthurian legend contains many elaborations upon canonical mythology. For example, Sir Balin discovers the Lance of Longinus, which had pierced the side of Christ. According to a tradition widely attested in early Christian writings, Adam's skull lay buried at Calvary; when Christ was crucified, his blood fell over Adam's skull, symbolizing humanity's redemption from Adam's sin.\n\n\n\n\nExamples of (1) Christian myths not mentioned in canon and (2) literary and traditional elaborations on canonical Christian mythology:\n\nSome scholars believe that many elements of Christian mythology, particularly its linear portrayal of time, originated with the Persian religion of Zoroastrianism. Mary Boyce, an authority on Zoroastrianism, writes:\nMircea Eliade believes the Hebrews had a sense of linear time before Zoroastrianism influenced them. However, he argues,\n\"a number of other [Jewish] religious ideas were discovered, revalorized, of systematized in Iran\". These ideas include a dualism between good and evil, belief in a future savior and resurrection, and \"an optimistic eschatology, proclaiming the final triumph of Good\".\n\nIn Buddhist mythology, the demon Mara tries to distract the historical Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, before he can reach enlightenment. Huston Smith, a professor of philosophy and a writer on comparative religion, notes the similarity between Mara's temptation of the Buddha before his ministry and Satan's temptation of Christ before his ministry.\n\nIn the Book of Revelation, the author sees a vision of a pregnant woman in the sky being pursued by a huge red dragon. The dragon tries to devour her child when she gives birth, but the child is \"caught up to God and his throne\". This appears to be an allegory for the triumph of Christianity: the child presumably represents Christ; the woman may represent God's people of the Old and New Testaments (who produced Christ); and the Dragon symbolizes Satan, who opposes Christ. According to Catholic scholars, the images used in this allegory may have been inspired by pagan mythology:\n\"This corresponds to a widespread myth throughout the ancient world that a goddess pregnant with a savior was pursued by a horrible monster; by miraculous intervention, she bore a son who then killed the monster.\"\n\nAcademic studies of mythology often define mythology as deeply valued stories that explain a society's existence and world order: those narratives of a society's creation, the society's origins and foundations, their god(s), their original heroes, mankind's connection to the \"divine\", and their narratives of eschatology (what happens in the \"after-life\"). This is a very general outline of some of the basic sacred stories with those themes.\n\nThe Christian texts use the same creation myth as Jewish mythology as written in the Old Testament. According to the Book of Genesis, the world was created out of a darkness and water in seven days. (Unlike a Jew, a Christian might include the miracle of Jesus' birth as a sort of second cosmogonic event) Canonical Christian scripture incorporates the two Hebrew cosmogonic myths found in Genesis 1-2:2 and Genesis 2:\n\nIn the first text on the creation (Genesis 1-2:3), the Creator is called \"Elohim\" (translated \"God\"). He creates the universe over a six-day period, creating a new feature each day: first he creates day and night; then he creates the firmament to separate the \"waters above\" from the \"waters below\"; then he separates the dry land from the water; then he creates plants on the land; then he places the sun, moon, and stars in the sky; then he creates swimming and flying animals; then he creates land animals; and finally he creates man and woman together, \"in his own image\". On the seventh day, God rests, providing the rationale for the custom of resting on Sabbath.\n\nThe second creation myth in Genesis differs from the first in a number of important elements. Here the Creator is called \"Yahweh elohim\" (commonly translated \"Lord God\", although Yahweh is in fact the personal name of the God of Israel and does not mean Lord).\n\nThis myth begins with the words, \"When the L God made the earth and the heavens, and no shrub of the field was yet in the earth, and no plant of the field had yet sprouted, for the LORD God had not sent rain upon the earth ...\" (Genesis 2:4-5 NASB). It then proceeds to describe Yahweh creating a man called Adam out of dust. Yahweh creates the Garden of Eden as a home for Adam, and tells Adam not to eat the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in the center of the Garden (next to the Tree of Life).\n\nYahweh also creates animals, and shows them to man, who names them. Yahweh sees that there is no suitable companion for the man among the beasts, and he subsequently puts Adam to sleep and takes out one of Adam's ribs, creating from it a woman whom Adam names Eve.\n\nA serpent tempts Eve to eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and she succumbs, offering the fruit to Adam as well. As a punishment, Yahweh banishes the couple from the Garden and \"placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden the cherubim with a fiery revolving sword to guard the way to the Tree of Life\". The Lord says he must banish humans from the Garden because they have become like him, knowing good and evil (because of eating the forbidden fruit), and now only immortality (which they could get by eating from the Tree of Life) stands between them and godhood:\n\"The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever\" (Genesis 3:22).\n\nAlthough the text of Genesis does not identify the tempting serpent with Satan, Christian tradition equates the two. This tradition has made its way into non-canonical Christian \"myths\" such as John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\".\n\nAccording to Lorena Laura Stookey, many myths feature sacred mountains as \"the sites of revelations\": \"In myth, the ascent of the holy mountain is a spiritual journey, promising purification, insight, wisdom, or knowledge of the sacred\". As examples of this theme, Stookey includes the revelation of the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai, Christ's ascent of a mountain to deliver his Sermon on the Mount, and Christ's ascension into Heaven from the Mount of Olives.\n\nMany mythologies involve a \"world center\", which is often the sacred place of creation; this center often takes the form of a tree, mountain, or other upright object, which serves as an \"axis mundi\" or axle of the world. A number of scholars have connected the Christian story of the crucifixion at Golgotha with this theme of a cosmic center. In his \"Creation Myths of the World\", David Leeming argues that, in the Christian story of the crucifixion, the cross serves as \"the \"axis mundi\", the center of a new creation\".\n\nAccording to a tradition preserved in Eastern Christian folklore, Golgotha was the summit of the cosmic mountain at the center of the world and the location where Adam had been both created and buried. According to this tradition, when Christ is crucified, his blood falls on Adam's skull, buried at the foot of the cross, and redeems him. George Every discusses the connection between the cosmic center and Golgotha in his book \"Christian Mythology\", noting that the image of Adam's skull beneath the cross appears in many medieval representations of the crucifixion.\n\nIn \"Creation Myths of the World\", Leeming suggests that the Garden of Eden may also be considered a world center.\n\nMany Near Eastern religions include a story about a battle between a divine being and a dragon or other monster representing chaos—a theme found, for example, in the \"Enuma Elish\". A number of scholars call this story the \"combat myth\". A number of scholars have argued that the ancient Israelites incorporated the combat myth into their religious imagery, such as the figures of Leviathan and Rahab, the Song of the Sea, Isaiah 51:9-10's description of God's deliverance of his people from Babylon, and the portrayals of enemies such as Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar. The idea of Satan as God's opponent may have developed under the influence of the combat myth. Scholars have also suggested that the Book of Revelation uses combat myth imagery in its descriptions of cosmic conflict.\n\nAccording to David Leeming, writing in \"The Oxford Companion to World Mythology\", the harrowing of hell is an example of the motif of the hero's descent to the underworld, which is common in many mythologies. According to Christian tradition, Christ descended to hell after his death in order to free the souls there; this event is known as the Harrowing of Hell. This story is narrated in the Gospel of Nicodemus and may be the meaning behind 1 Peter 3:18-22.\n\nMany myths, particularly from the Near East, feature a god who dies and is resurrected; this figure is sometimes called the \"dying god\". An important study of this figure is James George Frazer's \"The Golden Bough\", which traces the dying god theme through a large number of myths. The dying god is often associated with fertility. A number of scholars, including Frazer, have suggested that the Christ story is an example of the \"dying god\" theme. In the article \"Dying god\" in \"The Oxford Companion to World Mythology\", David Leeming notes that Christ can be seen as bringing fertility, though of a spiritual as opposed to physical kind.\n\nIn his 2006 homily for Corpus Christi, Pope Benedict XVI noted the similarity between the Christian story of the resurrection and pagan myths of dead and resurrected gods: \"In these myths, the soul of the human person, in a certain way, reached out toward that God made man, who, humiliated unto death on a cross, in this way opened the door of life to all of us.\"\n\nMany cultures have myths about a flood that cleanses the world in preparation for rebirth. Such stories appear on every inhabited continent on earth. An example is the biblical story of Noah. In \"The Oxford Companion to World Mythology\", David Leeming notes that, in the Bible story, as in other flood myths, the flood marks a new beginning and a second chance for creation and humanity.\n\nAccording to Sandra Frankiel, the records of \"Jesus' life and death, his acts and words\" provide the \"founding myths\" of Christianity. Frankiel claims that these founding myths are \"structurally equivalent\" to the creation myths in other religions, because they are \"the pivot around which the religion turns to and which it returns\", establishing the \"meaning\" of the religion and the \"essential Christian practices and attitudes\". Tom Cain uses the expression \"founding myths\" more broadly, to encompass such stories as those of the War in Heaven and the fall of man; according to Cain, \"the disastrous consequences of disobedience\" is a pervasive theme in Christian founding myths.\n\nChristian mythology of their society's founding would start with Jesus and his many teachings, and include the stories of Christian disciples starting the Christian Church and congregations in the 1st century. This might be considered the stories in the four canonical gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. The heroes of the first Christian society would start with Jesus and those chosen by Jesus, the twelve apostles including Peter, John, James, as well as Paul and Mary (mother of Jesus).\n\nIn his influential 1909 work \"Der Mythus von der Geburt des Helden\" (\"The Myth of the Birth of the Hero\"), Otto Rank argued that the births of many mythical heroes follow a common pattern. Rank includes the story of Christ's birth as a representative example of this pattern.\n\nAccording to Mircea Eliade, one pervasive mythical theme associates heroes with the slaying of dragons, a theme which Eliade traces back to \"the very ancient cosmogonico-heroic myth\" of a battle between a divine hero and a dragon. He cites the Christian legend of Saint George as an example of this theme. An example from the Late Middle Ages comes from Dieudonné de Gozon, third Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes, famous for slaying the dragon of Malpasso. Eliade writes:\n\"Legend, as was natural, bestowed upon him the attributes of St. George, famed for his victorious fight with the monster. […] In other words, by the simple fact that he was regarded as a hero, de Gozon was identified with a category, an archetype, which […] equipped him with a mythical biography from which it was \"impossible\" to omit combat with a reptilian monster.\"\nIn the \"Oxford Companion to World Mythology\" David Leeming lists Moses, Jesus, and King Arthur as examples of the heroic monomyth, calling the Christ story \"a particularly complete example of the heroic monomyth\". Leeming regards resurrection as a common part of the heroic monomyth, in which the resurrected heroes often become sources of \"material or spiritual food for their people\"; in this connection, Leeming notes that Christians regard Jesus as the \"bread of life\".\n\nIn terms of values, Leeming contrasts \"the myth of Jesus\" with the myths of other \"Christian heroes such as St. George, Roland, el Cid, and even King Arthur\"; the later hero myths, Leeming argues, reflect the survival of pre-Christian heroic values—\"values of military dominance and cultural differentiation and hegemony\"—more than the values expressed in the Christ story.\n\nMany religious and mythological systems contain myths about a paradise. Many of these myths involve the loss of a paradise that existed at the beginning of the world. Some scholars have seen in the story of the Garden of Eden an instance of this general motif.\n\nSacrifice is an element in many religious traditions and often represented in myths. In \"The Oxford Companion to World Mythology\", David Leeming lists the story of Abraham and Isaac and the story of Christ's death as examples of this theme. Wendy Doniger describes the gospel accounts as a \"meta-myth\" in which Jesus realizes that he is part of a \"new myth [...] of a man who is sacrificed in hate\" but \"sees the inner myth, the old myth of origins and acceptance, the myth of a god who sacrifices himself in love\".\n\nRelated to the doctrine of transsubstantiation, the Christian practice of eating the flesh and blood of Jesus Christ during the Eucharist is an instance of theophagy.\n\nThe theological concept of Jesus being born to atone for original sin is central to the Christian narrative. According to Christian theology, by Adam disobeying God in the Garden of Eden, humanity acquired an ingrained flaw that keeps humans in a state of moral imperfection, generally called \"original sin\". According to Paul the Apostle, Adam's sin brought sin and death to all humanity: \"Through one man, sin entered the world, and through sin, death\" (Romans 5:12). \n\nAccording to the orthodox Christian view, Jesus saved humanity from final death and damnation by dying for them. Most Christians believe that Christ's sacrifice supernaturally reversed death's power over humanity, proved when he was resurrected, and abolished the power of sin on humanity. According to Paul, \"if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many\" (Romans 5:15). For many Christians, atonement doctrine leads naturally into the eschatological narratives of Christian people rising from the dead and living again, or immediately entering heaven to join Jesus.\n\nPaul's theological writings lay out the basic framework of the atonement doctrine in the New Testament. However, Paul's letters contain relatively little mythology (narrative). The majority of narratives in the New Testament are in the Gospels and the Book of Revelation.\n\nAlthough the Gospel stories do not lay out the atonement doctrine as fully as does Paul, they do have the story of the Last Supper, crucifixion, death and resurrection. Atonement is also suggested in the parables of Jesus in his final days. According to Matthew's gospel, at the Last Supper, Jesus calls his blood \"the blood of the new covenant, which will be poured out for the forgiveness of many\" (Matthew 26:28). John's gospel is especially rich in atonement parables and promises: Jesus speaks of himself as \"the living bread that came down from heaven\"; \"and the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world\" (John 6:51); \"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit\" (John 12:24).\n\nThe sacrifice and atonement narrative appears explicitly in many non-canonical writings as well. For instance, in Book 3 of Milton's \"Paradise Lost\", the Son of God offers to become a man and die, thereby paying mankind's debt to God the Father.\n\nThe Harrowing of Hell is a non-canonical myth extrapolated from the atonement doctrine. According to this story, Christ descended into the land of the dead after his crucifixion, rescuing the righteous souls that had been cut off from heaven due to the taint of original sin. The story of the harrowing was popular during the Middle Ages. An Old English poem called \"The Harrowing of Hell\" describes Christ breaking into Hell and rescuing the Old Testament patriarchs. (The Harrowing is not the only explanation that Christians have put forth for the fate of the righteous who died before Christ accomplished the atonement)\n\nIn modern literature, atonement continues to be theme. In the first of C. S. Lewis's \"Narnia\" novels, \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\", a boy named Edmund is condemned to death by a White Witch, and the magical lion-king Aslan offers to die in Edmund's place, thereby saving him. Aslan's life is sacrificed on an altar, but returns to life again. Aslan's self-sacrifice for Edmund is often interpreted as an allegory for the story of Christ's sacrifice for humanity; although Lewis denied that the novel is a mere allegory.\n\nIn the early modern period, distinguished Christian theologians developed elaborated witch mythologies which contributed to the intensification of witch hunts. Major works in Christian demonology, such as Malleus Maleficarum, were dedicated to the implementation of Exodus 22:18 of the Old Testament: “You shall not permit a sorceress to live.” The concept of witches' sabbath was well articulated by the 17th century. Theologian Martin Delrio was one of the first to provide a vivid description in his influential \"Disquisitiones magicae\":\n\nThere, on most occasions, once a foul, disgusting fire has been lit, an evil spirit sits on a throne as president of the assembly. His appearance is terrifying, almost always that of a male goat or a dog. The witches come forward to worship him in different ways. Sometimes they supplicate him on bended knee; sometimes they stand with their back turned to him. They offer candles made of pitch or a child's umbilical cord, and kiss him on the anal orifice as a sign of homage. Sometimes they imitate the sacrifice of the Mass (the greatest of all their crimes), as well as purifying with water and similar Catholic ceremonies. After the feast, each evil spirit takes by the hand the disciple of whom he has charge, and so that they may do everything with the most absurd kind of ritual, each person bends over backwards, joins hands in a circle, and tosses his head as frenzied fanatics do. Then they begin to dance. They sing very obscene songs in his [Satan's] honour. They behave ridiculously in every way, and in every way contrary to accepted custom. Then their demon-lovers copulate with them in the most repulsive fashion.\nChristian eschatological myths include stories of the afterlife: the narratives of Jesus Christ rising from the dead and now acting as a saviour of all generations of Christians, and stories of heaven and hell. Eschatological myths would also include the prophesies of end of the world and a new millennium in the Book of Revelation, and the story that Jesus will return to earth some day.\n\nThe major features of Christian eschatological mythology include afterlife beliefs, the Second Coming, the resurrection of the dead, and the final judgment.\n\nMost Christian denominations hold some belief in an immediate afterlife when people die. Christian scripture gives a few descriptions of an immediate afterlife and a heaven and hell; however, for the most part, both New and Old Testaments focus much more on the myth of a final bodily resurrection than any beliefs about a purely spiritual afterlife away from the body.\n\nMuch of the Old Testament does not express a belief in a personal afterlife of reward or punishment:\"All the dead go down to Sheol, and there they lie in sleep together–whether good or evil, rich or poor, slave or free (Job 3:11-19). It is described as a region \"dark and deep,\" \"the Pit,\" and \"the land of forgetfulness,\" cut off from both God and human life above (Pss. 6:5; 88:3-12). Though in some texts Yahweh's power can reach down to Sheol (Ps. 139:8), the dominant idea is that the dead are abandoned forever. This idea of Sheol is negative in contrast to the world of life and light above, but there is no idea of judgment or of reward and punishment.\"\n\nLater Old Testament writings, particularly the works of the Hebrew prophets, describe a final resurrection of the dead, often accompanied by spiritual rewards and punishments:\"Many who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake. Some shall live forever; others shall be in everlasting contempt. But the wise shall shine brightly like the splendor of the firmament, and those who lead the many to justice shall be like the stars forever\" (Daniel 12:2).\nHowever, even here, the emphasis is not on an immediate afterlife in heaven or hell, but rather on a future bodily resurrection.\n\nThe New Testament also devotes little attention to an immediate afterlife. Its primary focus is the resurrection of the dead. Some New Testament passages seem to mention the (non-resurrected) dead experiencing some sort of afterlife (for example, the parable of Lazarus and Dives); yet the New Testament includes only a few myths about heaven and hell. Specifically, heaven is a place of peaceful residence, where Jesus goes to \"prepare a home\" or room for his disciples (John 14:2). Drawing on scriptural imagery (John 10:7, John 10:11-14), many Christian narratives of heaven include a nice green pasture land and a meeting with a benevolent God. Some of the earliest Christian art depicts heaven as a green pasture where people are sheep led by Jesus as \"the good shepherd\" as in interpretation of heaven.\n\nAs the doctrines of heaven and hell and (Catholic) purgatory developed, non-canonical Christian literature began to develop an elaborate mythology about these locations. Dante's three-part \"Divine Comedy\" is a prime example of such afterlife mythology, describing Hell (in \"Inferno\"), Purgatory (in \"Purgatorio\"), and Heaven (in \"Paradiso\"). Myths of hell differ quite widely according to the denomination.\n\nThe Second Coming of Christ holds a central place in Christian mythology. The Second Coming is the return of Christ to earth during the period of transformation preceding the end of this world and the establishment of the Kingdom of Heaven on earth. According to Matthew's gospel, when Jesus is on trial before the Roman and Jewish authorities, he claims, \"In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.\"\nThe legend of the \"Wandering Jew\" concerns a Jew who taunted Jesus on the way to the Crucifixion and was then cursed to walk the earth until the Second Coming.\n\nChristian mythology incorporates the Old Testament's prophecies of a future resurrection of the dead. Like the Hebrew prophet Daniel (e.g., Daniel 12:2), the Christian Book of Revelation (among other New Testament scriptures) describes the resurrection: \"The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them; and they were judged, every one of them according to their deeds.\" The righteous and/or faithful enjoy bliss in the earthly Kingdom of Heaven, but the evil and/or non-Christian are \"cast into the lake of fire\".\n\nChristian eschatological myths feature a total world renovation after the final judgment. According to the Book of Revelation, God \"will wipe every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death or mourning, wailing or pain, for the old order has passed away\". According to Old and New Testament passages, a time of perfect peace and happiness is coming: \"They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. One nation will not raise the sword against another; nor will they train for war again.\" Certain scriptural passages even suggest that God will abolish the current natural laws in favor of immortality and total peace:\n\nWhen Christianity was a new and persecuted religion, many Christians believed the end times were imminent. Scholars debate whether Jesus was an apocalyptic preacher; however, his early followers, \"the group of Jews who accepted him as messiah in the years immediately after his death, understood him in primarily apocalyptic terms\". Prevalent in the early church and especially during periods of persecution, this Christian belief in an imminent end is called \"millennialism\". (It takes its name from the thousand-year (\"millennial\") reign of Christ that, according to the Book of Revelation, will precede the final world renovation; similar beliefs in a coming paradise are found in other religions, and these phenomena are often also called \"millennialism\")\n\nMillennialism comforted Christians during times of persecution, for it predicted an imminent deliverance from suffering. From the perspective of millennialism, human action has little significance: millennialism is comforting precisely because it predicts that happiness is coming no matter what humans do: \"The seeming triumph of Evil made up the apocalyptic syndrome which was to precede Christ's return and the millennium.\"\n\nHowever, as time went on, millennialism lost its appeal. Christ had not returned immediately, as earlier Christians had predicted. Moreover, many Christians no longer needed the comfort that millennialism provided, for they were no longer persecuted: \"With the triumph of the Church, the Kingdom of Heaven was already present on earth, and in a certain sense the old world had already been destroyed.\" (Millennialism has revived during periods of historical stress, and is currently popular among Evangelical Christians)\n\nIn the Roman Church's condemnation of millennialism, Eliade sees \"the first manifestation of the doctrine of [human] progress\" in Christianity. According to the amillennial view, Christ will indeed come again, ushering in a perfect Kingdom of Heaven on earth, but \"the Kingdom of God is [already] present in the world today through the presence of the heavenly reign of Christ, the Bible, the Holy Spirit and Christianity\". Amillennialists do not feel \"the eschatological tension\" that persecution inspires; therefore, they interpret their eschatological myths either figuratively or as descriptions of far-off events rather than imminent ones. Thus, after taking the amillennial position, the Church not only waited for God to renovate the world (as millennialists had) but also believed itself to be improving the world through human action.\n\nAccording to Mircea Eliade, many traditional societies have a cyclic sense of time, periodically reenacting mythical events. Through this reenactment, these societies achieve an \"eternal return\" to the mythical age. According to Eliade, Christianity retains a sense of cyclical time, through the ritual commemoration of Christ's life and the imitation of Christ's actions; Eliade calls this sense of cyclical time a \"mythical aspect\" of Christianity.\n\nHowever, Judeo-Christian thought also makes an \"innovation of the first importance\", Eliade says, because it embraces the notion of linear, historical time; in Christianity, \"time is no longer [only] the circular Time of the Eternal Return; it has become linear and irreversible Time\". Summarizing Eliade's statements on this subject, Eric Rust writes, \"A new religious structure became available. In the Judaeo-Christian religions—Judaism, Christianity, Islam—history is taken seriously, and linear time is accepted. [...] The Christian myth gives such time a beginning in creation, a center in the Christ-event, and an end in the final consummation.\"\n\nIn contrast, the myths of many traditional cultures present a cyclic or static view of time. In these cultures, all the \"[important] history is limited to a few events that took place in the mythical times\". In other words, these cultures place events into two categories, the mythical age and the present, between which there is no continuity. Everything in the present is seen as a direct result of the mythical age:\n\"Just as modern man considers himself to be constituted by [all of] History, the man of the archaic societies declares that he is the result of [only] a certain number of mythical events.\"\nBecause of this view, Eliade argues, members of many traditional societies see their lives as a constant repetition of mythical events, an \"eternal return\" to the mythical age: \"In \"imitating\" the exemplary acts of a god or of a mythical hero, or simply by recounting their adventures, the man of an archaic society detaches himself from profane time and magically re-enters the Great Time, the sacred time.\"\n\nAccording to Eliade, Christianity shares in this cyclic sense of time to an extent. \"By the very fact that it is a religion\", he argues, Christianity retains at least one \"mythical aspect\" — the repetition of mythical events through ritual. Eliade gives a typical church service as an example:\"Just as a church constitutes a break in plane in the profane space of a modern city, [so] the service celebrated inside [the church] marks a break in profane temporal duration. It is no longer today's historical time that is present—the time that is experienced, for example, in the adjacent streets—but the time in which the historical existence of Jesus Christ occurred, the time sanctified by his preaching, by his passion, death, and resurrection.\"\n\nHeinrich Zimmer also notes Christianity's emphasis on linear time; he attributes this emphasis specifically to the influence of Saint Augustine's theory of history. Zimmer does not explicitly describe the cyclical conception of time as itself \"mythical\" per se, although he notes that this conception \"underl[ies] Hindu mythology\".\n\nNeil Forsyth writes that \"what distinguishes both Jewish and Christian religious systems [...] is that they elevate to the sacred status of myth narratives that are situated in historical time\".\n\nAccording to Carl Mitcham, \"the Christian mythology of progress toward transcendent salvation\" created the conditions for modern ideas of scientific and technological progress. Hayden White describes \"the myth of Progress\" as the \"secular, Enlightenment counterpart\" of \"Christian myth\". Reinhold Niebuhr described the modern idea of ethical and scientific progress as \"really a rationalized version of the Christian myth of salvation\".\n\nAccording to Irwin, from the perspective of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), \"history is a tale of progress\". Christianity inherited the Hebrew sense of history through the Old Testament. Thus, although most Christians believe that human nature is inherently \"fallen\" (see original sin) and cannot become perfected without divine grace, they do believe that the world can and will change for the better, either through human and divine action or through divine action alone.\n\nAccording to Mircea Eliade, the medieval \"Gioacchinian myth [...] of universal renovation in a more or less imminent future\" has influenced a number of modern theories of history, such as those of Lessing (who explicitly compares his views to those of medieval \"enthusiasts\"), Fichte, Hegel, and Schelling; and has also influenced a number of Russian writers.\n\nCalling Marxism \"a truly messianic Judaeo-Christian ideology\", Eliade writes that Marxism \"takes up and carries on one of the great eschatological myths of the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean world, namely: the redemptive part to be played by the Just (the 'elect', the 'anointed', the 'innocent', the 'missioners', in our own days the proletariat), whose sufferings are invoked to change the ontological status of the world\".\n\nIn his article \"The Christian Mythology of Socialism\", Will Herberg argues that socialism inherits the structure of its ideology from the influence of Christian mythology upon western thought.\n\nIn \"The Oxford Companion to World Mythology\", David Leeming claims that Judeo-Christian messianic ideas have influenced 20th-century totalitarian systems, citing the state ideology of the Soviet Union as an example.\n\nAccording to Hugh S. Pyper, the biblical \"founding myths of the Exodus and the exile, read as stories in which a nation is forged by maintaining its ideological and racial purity in the face of an oppressive great power\", entered \"the rhetoric of nationalism throughout European history\", especially in Protestant countries and smaller nations.\n\nChristmas stories have become prevalent in Western literature and culture.\n\nMythic patterns such as the primordial struggle between good and evil appear in passages throughout the Hebrew Bible, including passages that describe historical events. A distinctive characteristic of the Hebrew Bible is the reinterpretation of myth on the basis of history, as in the Book of Daniel, a record of the experience of the Jews of the Second Temple period under foreign rule, presented as a prophecy of future events and expressed in terms of \"mythic structures\" with \"the Hellenistic kingdom figured as a terrifying monster that cannot but recall [the Near Eastern pagan myth of] the dragon of chaos\".\n\nMircea Eliade argues that the imagery used in some parts of the Hebrew Bible reflects a \"transfiguration of history into myth\". For example, Eliade says, the portrayal of Nebuchadnezzar as a dragon in Jeremiah 51:34 is a case in which the Hebrews \"interpreted contemporary events by means of the very ancient cosmogonico-heroic myth\" of a battle between a hero and a dragon.\n\nAccording to scholars including Neil Forsyth and John L. McKenzie, the Old Testament incorporates stories, or fragments of stories, from extra-biblical mythology. According to the \"New American Bible\", a Catholic Bible translation produced by the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, the story of the Nephilim in Genesis 6:1-4 \"is apparently a fragment of an old legend that had borrowed much from ancient mythology\", and the \"sons of God\" mentioned in that passage are \"celestial beings of mythology\". The \"New American Bible\" also says that Psalm 93 alludes to \"an ancient myth\" in which God battles a personified Sea. Some scholars have identified the biblical creature Leviathan as a monster from Canaanite mythology. According to Howard Schwartz, \"the myth of the fall of Lucifer\" existed in fragmentary form in Isaiah 14:12 and other ancient Jewish literature; Schwartz claims that the myth originated from \"the ancient Canaanite myth of Athtar, who attempted to rule the throne of Ba'al, but was forced to descend and rule the underworld instead\".\n\nSome scholars have argued that the calm, orderly, monotheistic creation story in Genesis 1 can be interpreted as a reaction against the creation myths of other Near Eastern cultures. In connection with this interpretation, David and Margaret Leeming describe Genesis 1 as a \"demythologized myth\", and John L. McKenzie asserts that the writer of Genesis 1 has \"excised the mythical elements\" from his creation story.\n\nPerhaps the most famous topic in the Bible that could possibly be connected with mythical origins is the topic of Heaven (or the sky) as the place where God (or angels, or the saints) resides, with stories such as the ascension of Elijah (who disappeared in the sky), war of man with an angel, flying angels. Even in the New Testament Saint Paul is said to \"have visited the third heaven\", and Jesus was portrayed in several books as going to return from Heaven on a cloud, in the same way he ascended thereto. The official text repeated by the attendees during Roman Catholic mass (the Apostles' Creed) contains the words \"He ascended into Heaven, and is Seated at the Right Hand of God, The Father. From thence He will come again to judge the living and the dead\". Medieval cosmology adapted its view of the Cosmos to conform with these scriptures, in the concept of celestial spheres.\n\nAccording to a number of scholars, the Christ story contains mythical themes such as descent to the underworld, the heroic monomyth, and the \"dying god\" (see section below on \"mythical themes and types\").\n\nSome scholars have argued that the Book of Revelation incorporates imagery from ancient mythology. According to the \"New American Bible\", the image in Revelation 12:1-6 of a pregnant woman in the sky, threatened by a dragon, \"corresponds to a widespread myth throughout the ancient world that a goddess pregnant with a savior was pursued by a horrible monster; by miraculous intervention, she bore a son who then killed the monster\". Bernard McGinn suggests that the image of the two Beasts in Revelation stems from a \"mythological background\" involving the figures of Leviathan and Behemoth.\n\nThe Pastoral Epistles contain denunciations of \"myths\" (\"muthoi\"). This may indicate that Rabbinic or Gnostic mythology was popular among the early Christians to whom the epistles were written and that the epistles' author was attempting to resist that mythology.\n\nThe Sibylline oracles contain predictions that the dead Roman Emperor Nero, infamous for his persecutions, would return one day as an Antichrist-like figure. According to Bernard McGinn, these parts of the oracles were probably written by a Christian and incorporated \"mythological language\" in describing Nero's return.\n\nAfter Christian theology was accepted by the Roman Empire, promoted by St. Augustine in the 5th century, Christian mythology began to predominate the Roman Empire. Later the theology was carried north by Charlemagne and the Frankish people, and Christian themes began to weave into the framework of European mythologies. The pre-Christian Germanic and Celtic mythology that were native to the tribes of Northern Europe were denounced and submerged, while saint myths, Mary stories, Crusade myths, and other Christian myths took their place. However, pre-Christian myths never went entirely away, they mingled with the (Roman Catholic) Christian framework to form new stories, like myths of the mythological kings and saints and miracles, for example (Eliade 1963:162-181). Stories such as that of Beowulf and Icelandic, Norse, and Germanic sagas were reinterpreted somewhat, and given Christian meanings. The legend of King Arthur and the quest for the Holy Grail is a striking example. The thrust of incorporation took on one of two directions. When Christianity was on the advance, pagan myths were Christianized; when it was in retreat, Bible stories and Christian saints lost their mythological importance to the culture.\nAccording to Mircea Eliade, the Middle Ages witnessed \"an upwelling of mythical thought\" in which each social group had its own \"mythological traditions\". Often a profession had its own \"origin myth\" which established models for members of the profession to imitate; for example, the knights tried to imitate Lancelot or Parsifal. The medieval trouveres developed a \"mythology of woman and Love\" which incorporated Christian elements but, in some cases, ran contrary to official church teaching.\n\nGeorge Every includes a discussion of medieval legends in his book \"Christian Mythology\". Some medieval legends elaborated upon the lives of Christian figures such as Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the saints. For example, a number of legends describe miraculous events surrounding Mary's birth and her marriage to Joseph.\n\nIn many cases, medieval mythology appears to have inherited elements from myths of pagan gods and heroes. According to Every, one example may be \"the myth of St. George\" and other stories about saints battling dragons, which were \"modelled no doubt in many cases on older representations of the creator and preserver of the world in combat with chaos\". Eliade notes that some \"mythological traditions\" of medieval knights, namely the Arthurian cycle and the Grail theme, combine a veneer of Christianity with traditions regarding the Celtic Otherworld. According to Lorena Laura Stookey, \"many scholars\" see a link between stories in \"Irish-Celtic mythology\" about journeys to the Otherworld in search of a cauldron of rejuvenation and medieval accounts of the quest for the Holy Grail.\n\nAccording to Eliade, \"eschatological myths\" became prominent during the Middle Ages during \"certain historical movements\". These eschatological myths appeared \"in the Crusades, in the movements of a Tanchelm and an Eudes de l'Etoile, in the elevation of Fredrick II to the rank of Messiah, and in many other collective messianic, utopian, and prerevolutionary phenomena\". One significant eschatological myth, introduced by Gioacchino da Fiore's theology of history, was the \"myth of an imminent third age that will renew and complete history\" in a \"reign of the Holy Spirit\"; this \"Gioacchinian myth\" influenced a number of messianic movements that arose in the late Middle Ages.\n\nDuring the Renaissance, there arose a critical attitude that sharply distinguished between apostolic tradition and what George Every calls \"subsidiary mythology\"—popular legends surrounding saints, relics, the cross, etc.—suppressing the latter.\n\nThe works of Renaissance writers often included and expanded upon Christian and non-Christian stories such as those of creation and the Fall. Rita Oleyar describes these writers as \"on the whole, reverent and faithful to the primal myths, but filled with their own insights into the nature of God, man, and the universe\". An example is John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\", an \"epic elaboration of the Judeo-Christian mythology\" and also a \"veritable encyclopedia of myths from the Greek and Roman tradition\".\n\nAccording to Cynthia Stewart, during the Reformation, the Protestant reformers used \"the founding myths of Christianity\" to critique the church of their time.\n\nEvery argues that \"the disparagement of myth in our own civilization\" stems partly from objections to perceived idolatry, objections which intensified in the Reformation, both among Protestants and among Catholics reacting against the classical mythology revived during the Renaissance.\n\nThe philosophes of the Enlightenment used criticism of myth as a vehicle for veiled criticisms of the Bible and the church. According to Bruce Lincoln, the philosophes \"made irrationality the hallmark of myth and constituted philosophy—rather than the Christian \"kerygma\"—as the antidote for mythic discourse. By implication, Christianity could appear as a more recent, powerful, and dangerous instance of irrational myth\".\n\nSince the end of the 18th century, the biblical stories have lost some of their mythological basis to western society, owing to the scepticism of the Enlightenment, 19th-century freethinking, and 20th century modernism. Most westerners no longer found Christianity to be their primary imaginative and mythological framework by which they understand the world. However other scholars believe mythology is in our psyche, and that mythical influences of Christianity are in many of our ideals, for example the Judeo-Christian idea of an after-life and heaven. The book \"\" by Tom Beaudoin explores the premise that Christian mythology is present in the mythologies of pop-culture, such as Madonna's \"Like a Prayer\" or Soundgarden's \"Black Hole Sun.\" Modern myths are strong in comic book stories (as stories of culture heroes) and detective novels as myths of good versus evil.\n\nSome commentators have categorized a number of modern fantasy works as \"Christian myth\" or \"Christian mythopoeia\". Examples include the fiction of C.S. Lewis, Madeleine L'Engle, J.R.R. Tolkien, and George MacDonald.\n\nIn \"The Eternal Adam and the New World Garden\", written in 1968, David W. Noble argued that the Adam figure had been \"the central myth in the American novel since 1830\". As examples, he cites the works of Cooper, Hawthorne, Melville, Twain, Hemingway, and Faulkner.\n"}

{"id": "311342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=311342", "title": "Ecclesia Gnostica", "text": "Ecclesia Gnostica\n\nThe Ecclesia Gnostica (Latin for \"The Church of Gnosis\" or \"The Gnostic Church\") is an openly Gnostic liturgical church that practices and offers its sacraments publicly. It is centred in Los Angeles, California with parishes in Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; Salt Lake City, Utah; Sedona, Arizona; and Oslo, Norway. The church and its affiliate, the Gnostic Society, attempt to \"make available the philosophy and practice of gnosticism to the contemporary world.\"\n\nThe organisation now called the Ecclesia Gnostica was originally organised in England under the name \"the Pre-Nicene Gnostic Catholic Church\" in 1953, by the Most Rev. Richard Jean Chretien Duc de Palatine with the object of \"restoring the Gnosis – Divine Wisdom to the Christian Church, and to teach the Path of Holiness which leads to God and the Inner Illumination and Interior Communion with the Soul through the mortal body of man.\" Born Ronald Powell, Richard Duc de Palatine had served in the Liberal Catholic Church in Australia, before moving to England. Bishop Duc de Palatine was consecrated by the Most Rev. Msg. Hugh George de Willmott Newman (Mar Georgius I), patriarch of the Catholic Apostolic Church (Catholicate of the West) who consolidated many lines of apostolic succession.\n\nBishop Duc de Palatine also received a charter in 1953 to head an organisation first called \"the Brotherhood of the Illuminati,\" renamed \"the Order of the Pleroma\" in 1960. He received other esoteric lines and charters such as: the Templar Order, Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross, Memphis and Mizraim Rites of Freemasonry, and the Martiniste Order, and termed the combination with the Ecumenical Apostolic Succession \"the Wisdom Religion-Gnostic Mystic Tradition.\"\n\nIn 1959 the organisation became active in the United States through the work of Stephan A. Hoeller, who served as a priest of the church in Los Angeles, and was subsequently consecrated as regionary bishop for the Americas in 1967. He became presiding bishop on the death of Bishop Duc de Palatine in 1977, although there was a falling out prior to that.\n\nMost Rev. Msg. Hugh George de Willmott Newman (Mar Georgius I) felt that all proper and valid consecrations and ordinations are equally efficacious regardless of the particular line of Apostolic succession, but also that some degree of irregularity would attach itself to acts lacking ecumenical sanction. And so, to rectify any irregularity, and to overcome any doubts about validity of any line of Apostolic Succession, he sought and received conditional consecration from every part of the One Holy Catholic (Universal) and Apostolic church, bringing into being the Ecumenical Apostolic Succession. This Ecumenical line incorporates Syrian-Antiochene, Syrian-Malabar, Syrian-Gallican, Syro-Chaldean, Chaldean-Uniate, Coptic-Orthodox, Armenian-Uniate, Greek-Melkite, Russian-Orthodox, Russo-Syriac, Roman Catholic, Old Catholic, Liberal Catholic, Order of Corporate Reunion, Mariavite; and additional (disputed) lines of Anglican, Nonjuring, Celtic, Welsh, and Restored Apostolic (Irvingite).\n\nAll of these lines were passed to bishop Duc de Palatine at his consecration in 1953 and in a subsequent conditional consecration in 1955. They were then passed on to bishop Hoeller at his consecration in 1967.\n\nThe presiding bishops of the church are: Most Rev. Stephan A. Hoeller, Regionary Bishop of the Americas; and Rt. Rev. Steven Marshall, auxiliary bishop. Bishop Hoeller is a leading exponent of Gnosticism as living religious practice, a professor of comparative religions, and scholar who has written and lectured extensively on Gnosticism, Jungian psychology, and esoteric subjects. In addition to the bishops there is an Archpriest who serves as vicar forane in Oslo, Norway (V. Rev. Jan Valentin Sæther). Each parish has a priest in charge, the pastor or rector.\n\nThe scope of the organisation is best described as a liturgical orthopraxy, the organisation being focused on correct practice of the liturgical services offered by the church.\n\nThere's an open communion and participation regardless of creed. Due to this open participation, there is not an emphasis on membership. On the other hand, the position of the church stated in its catechism is that the Gnostic worldview is a specific one (with Gnosis and the Gnostic religion going hand in hand), and that an experienced practitioner in the Gnostic church would be expected to be in general agreement with it.\n\nWhile the church has no association with secret initiatory orders, and does not feel that anyone would become a better Gnostic merely by belonging to any, its clergy and laity are left free to join and/or be initiated into any and all organisations, \"while they are earnestly requested to keep their activities in such organizations separate from their activities in the Ecclesia Gnostica.\"\n\nHoly orders are considered one of the seven sacraments practised by the church. Clergy are of both major and minor holy orders. The five minor orders are: cleric, doorkeeper, reader, Exorcist, and Acolyte. The major orders are: subdeacon, deacon, priest, and bishop. Clergy formation (training) is progressive, with individuals being ordained to and serving in each order in succession. Formation of priests is generally over seven or more years. All levels of holy orders are open to both male and female; married, divorced, and single; and both gay and straight candidates. Clergy are self-sustaining, not receiving a salary from the church.\n\nThe Gnostic Society, is a secular organisation for the study of gnosticism founded in 1928 and incorporated in 1939 by James Morgan Pryse. Currently functioning as an educational organisation associated with the Ecclesia Gnostica, the Gnostic Society provides resources on Gnosticism and Gnostic studies such as lectures, as well as, historic and source materials at The Gnosis Archive web site.\n\nWhile Christian based on Gnosis rather than creed or acceptance from mainstream Christian churches, the church considers itself part of the fellowship of Universal Christendom, that is part of the One Holy Catholic (Universal) and Apostolic Church.\n\nThe Ecclesia Gnostica is a liturgical orthopraxy rather than an orthodoxy. Christian liturgy is central to the existence of the church, and in ritual and ornament the church is similar to Catholicism.\n\nThe church does not proselytise. There is not an exclusive claim of salvation; salvation is not dependent on participation in the church. Salvation is also understood differently from salvation in mainstream Christianity: salvation is achieved through Gnosis, described as \"an inner 'knowingness,' a change of consciousness.\"\n\nGnosticism is grounded in the experience of Gnosis, which is the salvific and revelatory experience of transcendence. The experience of Gnosis receives expression in the Gnostic Mythology which allows the Gnostic to amplify and assimilate the experience of Gnosis and also makes further experience of Gnosis possible.\n\nThe aim of instruction is not just one variety of the Gnostic Mythos, but the entire heritage of the Gnostic tradition, which includes: primary sources such as the Nag Hammadi Library and much of the canonical Bible, with consideration of the less reliable accounts and recensions of teachings found in heresiological texts, the Hermetic writings, and the teachings of the Prophet Mani.\n\nWhile recognising the very pluralistic and creative elements of ancient Gnostic teachings they are seen as embracing a set of common assumptions which form the core of the Gnostic tradition. The \"brief and inadequate outline\" of this core given by bishop Hoeller is further summarised below:\n\nThe church does not require the acceptance of these teachings as a matter of belief. Although it states, \"it is obvious that these teachings represent the distinctive contribution of the Gnostic tradition to religious thought and persons functioning within the tradition would find themselves in general agreement with them.\"\n\nEcclesia Gnostica services consist of different liturgical celebrations usually based on traditional Western forms of Christian liturgy. Like ancient Gnostic groups, the Ecclesia Gnostica blends several disparate traditions. The church performs its sacraments \"in accordance with the tradition of the Ancient Mystery Schools\" and attempts to present them \"in their original meaning as archetypal acts of ceremonial communion with the timeless realities of the soul.\"\n\nThe celebration of the Gnostic Holy Eucharist is offered every Sunday in Los Angeles (and most other parishes). The Eucharist is central to the practice of the church, and is celebrated with high formality as congregants prepare to commune with \"the indwelling and cosmic Christ.\" The service resembles a Traditional Roman Catholic liturgy in style, complete with elaborate vestments, burning candles, incense, and bells.\n\nThe service contains the Post-Eucharistic Benediction, \"The peace of God which passeth all understanding, go with you. There is a power that makes all things new: It lives and moves in those who know the Self as one. May that peace brood over you, that Power uplift you into the Light, may It keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge and Love of God, and of His Son, our Lord the Christ.\"\n\nThe Ecclesia Gnostica recognises five initiatory sacraments as listed in the Gospel of Philip: Baptism, Chrism or Confirmation, Eucharist, Redemption (sacrament) and Bride-Chamber, with the additional two sustaining sacraments of Holy Orders and Anointing of the Sick. (The sacraments of Penance and Matrimony are considered to be secondary sacraments having been substituted for those of Redemption and Bride-Chamber.) The initiatory sacraments of Baptism and Chrism or Confirmation and the two sustaining sacraments are offered by the church.\n\nIn addition to the forms of liturgical service in the tradition of the Christian church, there is also the devotional service to the Holy Sophia that is unique to the rite of the Ecclesia Gnostica.\n\nThe church follows the traditional Western liturgical calendar with additions and emendations. These changes include the addition of observances of Gnostic church fathers and martyrs of the Gnostic tradition, and the re-dedication of the Marian feasts of Assumption and Nativity to the Assumption and Descent of the Holy Sophia (without decrying traditional Marian devotion).\n\nThe Lectionary, the book of collects, lessons (instead of epistles), and gospels, of the church was written, edited, and collected by bishop Stephan A. Hoeller and issued in 1974. Scriptures were collected from the Old and New Testament; the Pistis Sophia and other scriptures known before the Nag Hammadi find; the Nag Hammadi Library of the Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Truth, and Gospel of Phillip; Cathar, Hermetic, Manichean, and Mandaean sources; and the Chaldean Oracles.\n\nBoth the calendar and the lectionary have been adopted for use by a number of other Gnostic church bodies.\n\n\nServices at the Chapel of Ss. Serge and Bacchus focus on the special needs and concerns of the GLBT community. Beginning in the summer of 1999, Rev. Michael Lafferty held Chapel services on the first Sunday of every month and was the celebrant on most occasions. Starting at the Bodhi Tree Annex in West Hollywood, he later moved them to the diocesan centre in Los Angeles. Although, Rev. Lafferty died in 2008, other members of the clergy have continued this ministry. All are welcome to attend any service of the Ecclesia Gnostica or the Chapel of Ss. Serge and Bacchus.\n\n"}
{"id": "15245030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15245030", "title": "Edinoverie", "text": "Edinoverie\n\nEdinoverie (, literally \"coreligionism\") is an arrangement between certain Russian Old Believer communities and the official Russian Orthodox Church, whereby the communities are treated as a part of the normative Orthodox Church system, while maintaining their own traditional rites. Thus, they are often designated \"Old Ritualists\" (, \"Staroöbriadtsy\"), as opposed to \"Old Believers\".\n\nThe Russian word \"Edinoverie\" may be a back-formation of Edinovertsy (единоверцы; sometimes also transcribed Yedinovertsy), i.e. 'coreligionists' (literally, 'ones of the same faith'; the word is also used to refer to members of Edinoverie community). It may be interpreted as 'Unity in Faith', although perhaps a more precise meaning would be \"Accepting [the Old-Rite Christians] as people of the same faith [by the Established Church]\". More open-minded hierarchs of the State Church saw in the Edinoverie a mutual acceptance. In the words of Filaret, Metropolitan of Moscow, addressed to the Edinovertsy at the consecration of St Nicholas Church for them at Rogozhskoye Cemetery (1854), «Вы единоверцы нам, а мы единоверцы вам» (\"You are people of our faith, and we are people of your faith\").\n\nEdinoverie arrangements began to appear in the last quarter of the 18th century, after more than a century of struggle between Russia's established Orthodox Church and various Old Believer groups, who did not recognise the changes to the church rituals and the official translations of the Scripture made under the leadership of Patriarch Nikon in the 1660s.\n\nOn the side of the established church, the initiators of Edinoverie are said to be Metropolitan Platon of Moscow (the senior hierarch of the Russian Orthodox Church) and Archbishop Nikifor, who was Archbishop first of Sloviansk and Kherson, and later of Astrakhan and Stavropol in South Russia.\n\nNikifor, when he began reaching out to Old Believers in 1780, was based in Poltava, the headquarters of what was then the Diocese of Sloviansk and Kherson, covering much of eastern Ukraine, and later to become the Diocese of Ekaterinoslav). When he visited a chapel of Popovtsy (Old Believers who already had priests of their own, not recognised by the official church) Old Believers in Elisavetgrad in July of that year, he offered the local Old Believers the possibility of legalising their chapel as an official church, integrated into the established Church, with a priest selected by the Old Believers themselves, utilising the pre-Nikonian service books and rites. The offer was rejected by the Old Believers of Elisavetgrad, but later that month, many Old Believers of the village of Bolshaya Znamenka (in Melitopol uyezd) accepted a similar arrangement. In February 1781, an archbishop issued a letter, authorising them to set up a church legally and carry out their services in accordance with their traditional rites. That was done by consecrating as a church the wooden chapel that the Old Believers of Znamenka had built in 1776.\n\nNikifor's scheme of legalisation turned out to be so popular that soon enough not only did the Popovtsy begin to request legalisation, but also the Bespopovtsy (the priestless faction) began asking Nikifor to provide them with priests. One such Bezpopovtsy community was the village of Zlynka in 1782.\nOutside of Ukraine, in the same year, the Old Believer merchants of Moscow and the Volga arranged similar legalization of the Upper-Isaac Skete (compound) in the Irgiz Rivers area of Saratov Governorate.\n\nOn the side of the Old Believers, the driving force of the Edinoverie compromise were Hieromonk Michael Kalmykov and the Monk Nikodim. \n\nHaving learned of Nikifor's experiments in the South and the legalisation of the Irgiz community, Nikodim, with an agreement of many Popovtsy of the Starodub area, began to contact civil and ecclesiastical authorities with regards to the possibility of \"legalising\" the priests of the Popovtsy. After a number of rejections, he gained the support of Count Peter Rumyantsev-Zadunaisky in 1783. In the same year, his petition to Empress Catherine II of Russia was forwarded to the Holy Synod. In April 1784, by which time Kalmykov had died, the Empress issued a rescript, granting priests to Old Believers and allowing them to officiate according to the \"Old Rites\", but not providing for any bishops. Disappointed, Nikodim fell sick and died at the age of 39.\n\nIn August 1785, a government decree was promulgated, providing for the organization of \"Old Believer\" churches within the established Orthodox Church, although they still were not to have their own bishops or any sort of organizational centre. Nevertheless, this point is usually considered the start of the Edinoverie scheme.\n\nCatherine's successor, Paul I, was perhaps more interested than Catherine was, in the matter of integrating the Old Believers into the established church on acceptable terms. Legal priests were granted to the Old Believers of Kazan in 1796 and to those of Nizhny Novgorod in 1797. On March 12, 1798, the Emperor issued a decree, requiring all bishops to ordain priests for the Old Believers (using the \"old\" rite of ordination, acceptable to the flock), and permitting construction of Old Ritualist churches. \nThe chief bishop of the established church, Metropolitan Platon of Moscow, wrote the \"Eleven Articles of Edinoverie\" (), the document regulating the \"union\" between the official church and the Old Believers. Although the Metropolitan's rules satisfied some of the wishes of the Old Believers, the Edinoverie parishioners nevertheless remained second-class citizens within the Church: for example, the Old-Rite priests were still normally not permitted to administer sacraments to the mainstream Orthodox believers.\nThroughout the 19th century, the attitude of the established church toward the Edinoverie may be described as that of tolerating a \"necessary evil\": a tool to bring the \"dissenters\" into the fold of the Mother Church. On occasions, the church authorities were quite forceful in converting Old Believer communities into the Edinoverie scheme, and the government would usually treat those within the arrangement preferentially compared to those who did not join the compromise. For example, in 1818 the government prohibited the printing of Old Ritualist religious books, other than by the Edinoverie printing houses. At the same time, parishioners of \"regular\" Orthodox churches were discouraged by the authorities from joining Old-Rite parishes.\n\nBy the time of the Revolution of 1917, there were around 300 Edinoverie parishes in Russia.\n\nIn the capital of the Empire, Saint Petersburg, the first Edinoverie church was set up in 1799. In 1917, the Edinovertsy of Saint Petersburg received their first bishop (Bishop Simon of Okhta), but in 1932 their churches were closed by the Communist authorities, not to be revived until 1990. The Moscow community of Edinovertsy, based in Lefortovo District, were allowed to erect their churches after the Fire of 1812; , completed in 1819 and 1825, which were shut down in 1931, and are now operated by the State Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nSome Old Believers have been received into communion with the Catholic Church as Eastern Catholics while maintaining their distinctive rites, thus making them Eastern Catholic equivalents of the Edinoverie. The most famous convert is Potapy Emelianov, a former Edinoverie priest in Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine. In 1918, he was received into the Russian Catholic Church with his entire parish. He later survived a ten-year sentence at Solovki prison camp and died in 1936. As of 2003, his cause for canonisation is open.\n\nAccording to a 2005 interview, Russian Catholic priest Sergei Golovanov stated that there was then one Old-Ritualist Catholic priest active on Russian soil.\n\n"}

{"id": "90295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=90295", "title": "Huehueteotl", "text": "Huehueteotl\n\nHuehueteotl ; is an aged Mesoamerican deity figuring in the pantheons of pre-Columbian cultures, particularly in Aztec mythology and others of the Central Mexico region. The spellings Huehuetéotl and Ueueteotl are also used. Although known mostly in the cultures of that region, images and iconography depicting Huehueteotl have been found at other archaeological sites across Mesoamerica, such as in the Gulf region, western Mexico, Protoclassic-era sites in the Guatemalan highlands such as Kaminaljuyú and Late-Postclassic sites on the northern Yucatán Peninsula (Miller and Taube, 1993:189). The name Huehueteotl stems from Nahuatl \"huēhueh\" (\"old\") and \"teōtl\" (\"god\"). It seems to connect the Old God to certain Mayan deities called \"Mam\" (\"Grandfather\"). \n\nHuehueteotl is frequently considered to overlap with, or be another aspect of, a central Mexican/Aztec deity associated with fire, Xiuhtecuhtli. In particular the Florentine Codex identifies Huehueteotl as an alternative epithet for Xiutecuhtli, and consequently that deity is sometimes referred to as Xiutecuhtli-Huehueteotl. However, Huehueteotl is characteristically depicted as an aged or even decrepit being, often with a beard, whereas Xiutecuhtli's appearance is much more youthful and vigorous, in line with his marked association with rulership and (youthful) warriors.\n\nThe Florentine Codex describes an Aztec religious observance during the monthly feast of Izcalli (dedicated to Xiuhtecuhtli and Tlaloc), when boys had to hunt in the swamps for small water-related animals, such as snakes, lizards, frogs and even dragonfly larvae, and present these to elders serving as the guardians of the fire deity. As a reward for the offerings, the priest would give them steamed corn dough (tamales) stuffed with amaranth greens. At this occasion the god was represented as young with turquoise and quetzal feathers for ceremonial purposes. Later during the month he appeared as aging and tired, covered with the colours of gold, black and red. Perhaps this transformation of young into old can explain the fact that in the codices, Xiuhtecuhtli appears as a vigorous young man, whereas his representations in stone show him to be aged and decrepit.\n\nIn another, more dramatic, and better known celebration, the Aztecs cut out the hearts of human sacrifices and burned them on coal. As a result of this, the people would regain Huehueteotl's favour through the god's elements — fire and blood.\n"}
{"id": "11447140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11447140", "title": "Israeli cuisine", "text": "Israeli cuisine\n\nIsraeli cuisine ( \"ha-mitbaḥ ha-yisra’eli\") comprises both local dishes and dishes brought back to Israel by Jews from the Diaspora. Since before the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, and particularly since the late 1970s, an Israeli Jewish fusion cuisine has developed.\n\nIsraeli cuisine has adopted, and continues to adapt, elements of various styles of diaspora Jewish cuisine, particularly the Mizrahi, Sephardic and Ashkenazi styles of cooking. It incorporates many foods traditionally eaten in other Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines, and foods such as falafel, hummus, msabbha, shakshouka, couscous, and za'atar are now widely popular in Israel.\n\nOther influences on the cuisine are the availability of foods common to the Mediterranean region, especially certain kinds of fruits and vegetables, dairy products and fish; the distinctive traditional dishes prepared at holiday times; the tradition of keeping kosher; and food customs specific to Shabbat and different Jewish holidays, such as challah, jachnun, malawach, gefilte fish, hamin, me'orav yerushalmi and sufganiyot.\n\nNew dishes based on agricultural products such as oranges, avocados, dairy products and fish, and others based on world trends have been introduced over the years, and chefs trained abroad have brought in elements of other international cuisines.\n\nIsrael’s culinary traditions comprise foods and cooking methods that span three thousand years of history. Over that time, these traditions have been shaped by influences from Asia, Africa and Europe, and religious and ethnic influences have resulted in a culinary melting pot. Biblical and archaeological records provide insight into the culinary life of the region as far back as 968 BCE, in the days of the kings of ancient Israel.\n\nDuring the Second Temple period (516 BCE to 70 CE), Hellenistic and Roman culture heavily influenced cuisine, particularly of the priests and aristocracy of Jerusalem. Elaborate meals were served that included piquant entrées and alcoholic drinks, fish, beef, meat, pickled and fresh vegetables, olives, and tart or sweet fruits.\n\nThe food of the ancient Israelites was based on several products that still play important roles in modern Israeli cuisine. These were known as the seven species: olives, figs, dates, pomegranates, wheat, barley and grapes. The diet, based on locally grown produce, was enhanced by imported spices, readily available due to the country’s position at the crossroads of east-west trade routes.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Second Temple and the exile of the majority of Jews from the land of Israel, Jewish cuisine continued to develop in the many countries where Jewish communities have existed since Late Antiquity, influenced by the economics, agriculture, and culinary traditions of those countries.\n\nThe Jewish community that lived in Ottoman Syria prior to Zionist immigration that began in 1881 was known as the Old Yishuv. The cooking style of the community was Sephardi cuisine, which developed among the Jews of Spain before their expulsion in 1492, and in the areas to which they migrated thereafter, particularly the Balkans and Ottoman Empire. Sephardim also established communities in the Old Yishuv. Particularly in Jerusalem, they continued to develop their culinary style, influenced by Ottoman cuisine, creating a style that became known as Jerusalem Sephardi cuisine. This cuisine included pies like sambousak, pastels and burekas, vegetable gratins and stuffed vegetables, and rice and bulgur pilafs, which are now considered to be Jerusalem classics.\n\nGroups of Hasidic Jews from Eastern Europe began establishing communities in the late 18th century, and brought with them their traditional Ashkenazi cuisine, developing, however, distinct local variations, notably a peppery, caramelized noodle pudding known as \"kugel yerushalmi\".\n\nBeginning with the First Aliyah in 1881, Jews began immigrating to the area from Eastern Europe in larger numbers, particularly from Poland and Russia. These Zionist pioneers were motivated both ideologically and by the Mediterranean climate to reject the Ashkenazi cooking styles they had grown up with, and adapt by using local produce, especially vegetables such as zucchini, peppers, eggplant, artichoke and chickpeas. The first Hebrew cookbook, written by Erna Meyer, and published in the early 1930s by the Palestine Federation of the Women's International Zionist Organization (WIZO), exhorted cooks to use Mediterranean herbs and Middle Eastern spices and local vegetables in their cooking. The bread, olives, cheese and raw vegetables they adopted became the basis for the kibbutz breakfast, which in more abundant forms is served in Israeli hotels, and in various forms in most Israeli homes today.\n\nThe State of Israel faced enormous military and economic challenges in its early years, and the period from 1948 to 1958 was a time of food rationing and austerity, known as \"tzena\". In this decade, over one million Jewish immigrants, mainly from Arab countries, but also including European Holocaust survivors, inundated the new state. They arrived when only basic foods were available and ethnic dishes had to be modified with a range of mock or simulated foods, such as chopped “liver” from eggplant, and turkey as a substitute for veal schnitzel for Ashkenazim, kubbeh made from frozen fish instead of ground meat for Iraqi Jews, and turkey in place of the lamb kebabs of the Mizrahi Jews. These adaptations remain as a legacy of that time.\n\nSubstitutes, such as the wheat-based rice substitute, ptitim, were introduced, and versatile vegetables such as eggplant were used as alternatives to meat. Additional flavor and nutrition was provided from inexpensive canned tomato paste and puree, hummus, tahina, and mayonnaise in tubes. Meat was scarce, and it was not until the late 1950s that herds of beef cattle were introduced into the agricultural economy.\n\nKhubeza, a local variety of the mallow plant, became an important food source during the War of Independence. During the siege of Jerusalem, when convoys of food could not reach the city, Jerusalemites went out to the fields to pick khubeza leaves, which are high in iron and vitamins. The Jerusalem radio station, Kol Hamagen, broadcast instructions for cooking it that were picked up in Jordan convinced the Arabs that the Jews were dying of starvation and victory was at hand. In the past decade, food writers in Israel have encouraged the population to prepare khubeza on Israel Independence Day. Local chefs have begun to serve khubeza and other wild plants gathered from the fields in upscale restaurants.\nThe dish from the Independence war is called Ktzitzot Khubeza and still eaten by Israelis today.\n\nImmigrants to Israel have incorporated elements of the cuisines of the cultures and countries whence they came. During approximately fifty years before 1948, there were successive waves of Jewish immigration, which brought with them a whole range of foods and cooking styles. Immigrants arriving from central Europe brought foods such as schnitzel and strudels, while Russian Jews brought borsht and herring dishes, such as schmaltz herring and vorschmack (\"gehakte herring\").\n\nAshkenazi dishes include chicken soup, schnitzel, lox, chopped liver, gefilte fish, knishes, kishka and kugel. The first Israeli patisseries were opened by Ashkenazi Jews, who popularized cakes and pastries from central and Eastern Europe, such as yeast cakes (\"babka\"), nut spirals (\"schnecken\"), chocolate rolls and layered pastries.\n\nAfter 1948, the greatest impact came from the large migration of Jews from Turkey, Iraq, Kurdistan and Yemen, and Mizrahi Jews from North Africa, particularly Morocco. Typically, the staff of army kitchens, schools, hospitals, hotels and restaurant kitchens has consisted of Mizrahi, Kurdish and Yemenite Jews, and this has had an influence on the cooking fashions and ingredients of the country.\n\nMizrahi cuisine, the cuisine of Jews from North Africa, features grilled meats, sweet and savory puff pastries, rice dishes, stuffed vegetables, pita breads and salads, and shares many similarities with Arab cuisine. Other North African dishes popular in Israel include couscous, shakshouka, matbucha, carrot salad and \"chraime\" (slices of fish cooked in a spicy tomato sauce). Sephardic dishes, with Balkan and Turkish influences incorporated in Israeli cuisine include burekas, yogurt and taramosalata. Yemenite Jewish foods include jachnun, malawach, skhug and kubane. Iraqi dishes popular in Israel include amba, various types of kubba, stuffed vegetables (mhasha), kebab, sambusac, sabich and pickled vegetables (\"hamutzim\").\n\nAs Israeli agriculture developed and new kinds of fruits and vegetables appeared on the market, cooks and chefs began to experiment and devise new dishes with them.\n\nThey also began using \"biblical\" ingredients such as honey, figs, and pomegranates, and indigenous foods such as prickly pears (\"tzabar\") and chickpeas. Since the late 1970s, there has been an increased interest in international cuisine, cooking with wine and herbs, and vegetarianism. A more sophisticated food culture in Israel began to develop when cookbooks, such as \"“From the Kitchen with Love”\" by Ruth Sirkis, published in 1974, introduced international cooking trends, and together with the opening of restaurants serving cuisines such as Chinese, Italian and French, encouraged more dining out.\n\nThe 1980s were a formative decade: the increased optimism after the signing of the peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, the economic recovery of the mid-1980s and the increasing travel abroad by average citizens were factors contributing to a greater interest in food and wine. In addition, high quality, locally produced ingredients became increasingly available. For example, privately owned dairies began to produce handmade cheeses from goat, sheep and cow’s milk, which quickly became very popular both among chefs and the general public. In 1983, the Golan Heights Winery was the first of many new Israeli winemakers to help transform tastes with their production of world-class, semi-dry and dry wines. New attention was paid to the making of handmade breads and the production of high quality olive oil. The successful development of aquaculture ensured a steady supply of fresh fish, and the agricultural revolution in Israel led to an overwhelming choice and quality of fresh fruit, vegetables and herbs.\n\nEthnic heritage cooking, both Sephardic and Ashkenazi, has made a comeback with the growing acceptance of the heterogeneous society. Apart from home cooking, many ethnic foods are now available in street markets, supermarkets and restaurants, or are served at weddings and bar mitzvahs, and people increasingly eat foods from ethnic backgrounds other than their own. Overlap and combinations of foods from different ethnic groups is becoming standard as a multi-ethnic food culture develops.\n\nThe 1990s saw an increasing interest in international cuisines. Sushi, in particular, has taken hold as a popular style for eating out and as an entrée for events. In restaurants, fusion cuisine, with the melding of classic cuisines such as French and Japanese with local ingredients has become widespread. In the 2000s, the trend of “eating healthy” with an emphasis on organic and whole grain foods has become prominent, and medical research has led many Israelis to re-embrace the Mediterranean diet, with its touted health benefits.\n\nGeography has a large influence on Israel cuisine, and foods common in the Mediterranean region, such as olives, wheat, chickpeas, dairy products, fish, and vegetables such as tomatoes, eggplants, and zucchini are prominent in Israeli cuisine. Fresh fruits and vegetables are plentiful in Israel and are cooked and served in many ways.\n\nThere are various climatic areas in Israel and areas it has settled that allow a variety of products to be grown. Citrus trees such as orange, lemon and grapefruit thrive on the coastal plain. Figs, pomegranates and olives also grow in the cooler hill areas. The subtropical climate near the Sea of Galilee and in the Jordan River Valley is suitable for mangoes, kiwis and bananas, while the temperate climate of the mountains of the Galilee and the Golan is suitable for grapes, apples and cherries.\nIsraeli eating customs also conform to the wider Mediterranean region, with lunch, rather than dinner, being the focal meal of a regular workday. “Kibbutz foods” have been adopted by many Israelis for their light evening meals as well as breakfasts, and may consist of various types of cheeses, both soft and hard, yogurt, labne and sour cream, vegetables and salads, olives, hard-boiled eggs or omelets, pickled and smoked herring, a variety of breads, and fresh orange juice and coffee.\n\nIn addition, Jewish holidays influence the cuisine, with the preparation of traditional foods at holiday times, such as various types of challah (braided bread) for Shabbats and Festivals, jelly doughnuts (\"sufganiyot\") for Hanukah, the hamantaschen pastry (\"oznei haman\") for Purim, \"charoset\", a type of fruit paste, for Passover, and dairy foods for Shavuot. The Shabbat dinner, eaten on Friday, and to a lesser extent the Shabbat lunch, is a significant meal in Israeli homes, together with holiday meals.\n\nAlthough not all Jews in Israel keep kosher, the tradition of \"kashrut\" strongly influences the availability of certain foods and their preparation in homes, public institutions and many restaurants, including the separation of milk and meat and avoiding the use of non-kosher foods, especially pork and shellfish. During Passover, bread and other leavened foods are prohibited to observant Jews and matza and leaven-free foods are substituted.\n\nIsrael does not have a universally recognized national dish; however, many consider it to be falafel, deep fried balls of seasoned, ground chickpeas. Street vendors throughout Israel sell falafel and it is a favorite \"street food\". One book called the Israeli breakfast \"the Jewish state's contribution to world cuisine\".\n\nVegetable salads are eaten with most meals, including the traditional Israeli breakfast, which will usually include eggs, bread, and dairy products such as yogurt or cottage cheese. For lunch and dinner, salad may be served a side dish. A light meal of salad (\"Salat\"), hummus and French fries (\"Chips\") served in a pita is referred to as \"hummuschipsalat\".\n\nIsraeli salad is typically made with finely chopped tomatoes and cucumbers dressed in olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. Variations include the addition of diced red or green bell peppers, grated carrot, finely shredded cabbage or lettuce, sliced radish, fennel, spring onions and chives, chopped parsley, or other herbs and spices such as mint, za'atar and sumac. Although popularized by the kibbutzim, versions of this mixed salad were brought to Israel from various places. For example, Jews from India prepare it with finely chopped ginger and green chili peppers, North African Jews may add preserved lemon peel and cayenne pepper, and Bukharan Jews chop the vegetables extremely finely and use vinegar, without oil, in the dressing.\n\nTabbouleh is a Levantine vegan dish (sometimes considered a salad) traditionally made of tomatoes, finely chopped parsley, mint, bulgur and onion, and seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, and salt. Some Israeli variations of the salad use pomegranate seeds instead of tomatoes.\n\nSabich salad is a variation of the well known Israeli dish Sabich, the ingredients of the salad are eggplant, boiled eggs/hard boiled eggs, tahini, Israeli salad, potato, parsley and amba.\n\nKubba is a dish made of rice/semolina/burghul (cracked wheat), minced onions and finely ground lean beef, lamb or chicken. The best-known variety is a torpedo-shaped fried croquette stuffed with minced beef, chicken or lamb. It was brought to Israel by Jews of Iraqi, Kurdish and Syrian origin.\n\n\"Sambusak\" is a semi-circular pocket of dough filled with mashed chickpeas, fried onions and spices. There is another variety filled with meat, fried onions, parsley, spices and pine nuts, which is sometimes mixed with mashed chickpeas and breakfast version with feta or tzfat cheese and za'atar.\nIt can be fried and cooked.\n\n\"Sigarim\" are soft minced meat with onions and spices or mashed patato filling wrapped in phyllo-dough, and deep fried in oil or oven baked. They are commonly served at weddings and other celebrations..\n\nRoasted vegetables includes bell peppers, chili peppers, tomatoes, onions, eggplants and also sometimes potatoes and zucchini. Usually served with grilled meat\n\nHamusim are pickled vegetables made by soaking in water and salt (and sometimes olive oil) in a pot and withdrawing them from air. Ingredients can include: cucumber, cabbage, eggplant, carrot, turnip, radish, onion, caper, lemon, olives, cauliflower, tomatoes, chili pepper, bell pepper, garlic and beans.\n\nA large variety of eggplant salads and dips are made with roasted eggplants. Baba ghanoush, called \"salat ḥatzilim\" in Israel, is made with tahina and other seasonings such as garlic, lemon juice, onions, herbs and spices. The eggplant is sometimes grilled over an open flame so that the pulp has a smoky taste. A particularly Israeli variation of the salad is made with mayonnaise called \"salat ḥatzilim b'mayonnaise\". Eggplant salads are also made with yogurt, or with feta cheese, chopped onion and tomato, or in the style of Romanian Jews, with roasted red pepper.\n\nTahina is often used as a dressing for falafel, serves as a cooking sauce for meat and fish, and forms the basis of sweets such as halva.\n\nHummus is a cornerstone of Israeli cuisine, and consumption in Israel has been compared by food critic Elena Ferretti to \"peanut butter in America, Nutella in Europe or Vegemite in Australia\". Hummus in pita is a common lunch for schoolchildren, and is a popular addition to many meals. Supermarkets offer a variety of commercially prepared hummus, and some Israelis will go out of their way for fresh hummus prepared at a \"hummusia\", an establishment devoted exclusively to selling hummus.\n\nSalat avocado is an Israeli-style avocado salad, with lemon juice and chopped scallions (spring onions), was introduced by farmers who planted avocado trees on the coastal plain in the 1920s. Avocados have since become a winter delicacy and are cut into salads as well as being spread on bread.\n\nA meze of fresh and cooked vegetable salads, pickled cucumbers and other vegetables, hummus, ful, tahini and amba dips, labneh cheese with olive oil, and \"ikra\" is served at festive meals and in restaurants. Salads include Turkish salad (a piquant salad of finely chopped onions, tomatoes, herbs and spices), \"tabbouleh\", \"carrot salad\", marinated roasted red and green peppers, deep fried cauliflower florets, \"matbucha\", \"torshi\" (pickled vegetables) and various eggplant salads.\n\nModern Israeli interpretations of the meze blend traditional and modern, pairing ordinary appetizers with unique combinations such as fennel and pistachio salad, beetroot and pomegranate salad, and celery and kashkaval cheese salad.\n\nStuffed vegetables, called \"memula’im\", were originally designed to extend cheap ingredients into a meal. They are prepared by cooks in Israel from all ethnic backgrounds and are made with many varying flavors, such as spicy or sweet-and-sour, with ingredients such as bell peppers, chili peppers, figs, onion, artichoke bottoms, Swiss chard, beet, dried fruits, tomato, vine leaves, potatoes, mallow, eggplants and zucchini squash, and stuffing such as meat and rice in Balkan style, bulgur in Middle Eastern fashion, or with ptitim, a type of Israeli pasta. The Ottoman Turks introduced stuffed vine leaves in the 16th century and vine leaves are commonly stuffed with a combination of meat and rice, although other fillings, such as lentils, have evolved among the various communities. Artichoke bottoms stuffed with meat are famous as one the grand dishes of the Sephardi Jerusalem cuisine of the Old Yishuv. \nStuffed dates and dried fruits served with rice and bulgur dishes. Stuffed half zucchini has a Ladino name, \"medias\".\n\nA variety of soups are enjoyed, particularly in the winter. Chicken soup has been a mainstay of Jewish cuisine since medieval times and is popular in Israel. Classic chicken soup is prepared as a simple broth with a few vegetables, such as onion, carrot and celery, and herbs such as dill and parsley. More elaborate versions are prepared by Sephardim with orzo or rice, or the addition of lemon juice or herbs such as mint or coriander, while Ashkenazim may add noodles. An Israeli adaption of the traditional Ashkenazi soup pasta known as \"mandlen\", called \"shkedei marak\" (\"soup almonds\") in Israel, are commonly served with chicken soup.\n\nParticularly on holidays, dumplings are served with the soup, such as the \"kneidlach\" (matzah balls) of the Ashkenazim or the \"gondi\" (chickpea dumplings) of Iranian Jews, or \"kubba\", a family of dumplings brought to Israel by Middle Eastern Jews. Especially popular are kubba prepared from bulgur and stuffed with ground lamb and pine nuts, and the soft semolina or rice kubba cooked in soup, which Jews of Kurdish or Iraqi heritage habitually enjoy as a Friday lunchtime meal.\n\nLentil soup is prepared in many ways, with additions such as cilantro or meat. Other soups include the \"harira\" of the Moroccan Jews, which is a spicy soup of lamb (or chicken), chickpeas, lentils and rice, and Yemenite bone marrow soup known as \"ftut\", which is served on special occasions such as weddings, and is seasoned with the traditional \"hawaij\" spice mix.\n\nWhite Bean soup in tomato sauce is common in Jerusalem because Sephardic Jews settled in the city after being expelled from Andalusia.\n\nRice is prepared in numerous ways in Israel, from simple steamed white rice to festive casseroles. It is also cooked with spices and served with almonds and pine nuts. \"Green\" rice, prepared with a variety of fresh chopped herbs, is a favored by Persian Jews. Another rice dish is prepared with thin noodles that are first fried and then boiled with the rice. Mujadara is a popular rice and lentil dish, adopted from Arab cuisine. Orez Shu'it is a dish invented in Jerusalem by Sephardic Jews, made of white beans cooked in a tomato stew and served on plain boiled rice; it is eaten widely in the Jerusalem region.\n\nCouscous was brought to Israel by Jews from North Africa. It is still prepared in some restaurants or by traditional cooks by passing semolina through a sieve several times and then cooking it over an aromatic broth in a special steamer pot called a \"couscoussière\". Generally, \"instant\" couscous is widely used for home cooking. Couscous is used in salads, main courses and even some desserts. As a main course, chicken or lamb, or the vegetables cooked in a soup flavored with saffron or turmeric are served on the steamed couscous.\n\nPtitim is an Israeli pasta which now comes in many shapes, including pearls, loops, stars and hearts, but was originally shaped like grains of rice. It originated in the early days of the State of Israel as a wheat-based substitute for rice, when rice, a staple of the Mizrahi Jews, was scarce. Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, is reputed to have asked the Osem company to devise this substitute, and it was thus nicknamed \"Ben-Gurion rice\". Ptitim can be boiled like pasta, prepared pilaf-style by sautéing and then boiling in water or stock, or baked in a casserole. Like other pasta, it can be flavored in many ways with spices, herbs and sauces. Once considered primarily a food for children, ptitim is now prepared in restaurants both in Israel and internationally.\n\nBulgur is a kind of dried cracked wheat, served sometimes instead of rice.\n\nFresh fish is readily available, caught off Israel's coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, or in the Sea of Galilee, or raised in ponds in the wake of advances in fish farming in Israel. Fresh fish is served whole, in the Mediterranean style, grilled, or fried, dressed only with freshly squeezed lemon juice. Trout (called \"forel\"), gilthead seabream (called \"denisse\"), St. Peter's fish (known as 'musht') and other fresh fish are prepared this way. Fish are also eaten baked, with or without vegetables, or fried whole or in slices, or grilled over coals, and served with different sauces.\n\nFish are also braised, as in a dish called \"hraime\", in which fish such as grouper (better known in Israel by its Arabic name \"lokus\") or halibut is prepared in a sauce with hot pepper and other spices for Rosh Hashanah, Passover and the Sabbath by North African Jews. Everyday versions are prepared with cheaper kinds of fish and are served in market eateries, public kitchens and at home for weekday meals.\n\nFish, traditionally carp, but now other firm white fish too, are minced and shaped into loaves or balls and cooked in fish broth, such as the gefilte fish of the Ashkenazi Jews, who also brought pickled herring from Eastern Europe. Herring is often served at the kiddush that follows synagogue services on Shabbat, especially in Ashkenazi communities. In the Russian immigrant community it may be served as a light meal with boiled potatoes, sour cream, dark breads and schnapps or vodka.\n\nFish Kufta is usually fried with spices, herbs and onions (sometimes also pine nuts) and served with tahini or yogurt sauce. Boiled Fish Kufta is cooked in a tomato, tahini or yogurt sauce.\n\nTilapia baked with tahini sauce and topped with olive oil, coriander, mint, basil and pine nuts (and sometimes also with fried onions) is a specialty of Tiberias.\n\nChicken is the most widely eaten meat in Israel, followed by turkey. Chicken is prepared in a multitude of ways, from simple oven-roasted chicken to elaborate casseroles with rich sauces such as date syrup, tomato sauce, etc. Examples include chicken casserole with couscous, inspired by Moroccan Jewish cooking, chicken with olives, a Mediterranean classic, and chicken \"albondigas\" (meat balls) in tomato sauce, from Jerusalem Sephardi cuisine. \"Albondigas\" are also prepared from ground meat., similar to albogindas is the more popular Kufta which is made of minced meat, herbs and spices and cooked with tomato sauce, date syrup, pomegranate syrup or tamarind syrup with vegetables or beans.\n\nGrilled and barbecued meat are common in Israeli cuisine. The country has many small eateries specializing in beef and lamb kebab, shish taouk, merguez and shashlik. Outdoor barbecuing, known as \"mangal\" or \"al ha-esh\" (on the fire) is a beloved Israeli pastime. In modern times, Israel Independence Day is frequently celebrated with a picnic or barbecue in parks and forests around the country.\nSkewered Goose Liver is a dish from southern Tel Aviv. It is grilled with salt and black pepper and sometimes with spices like cumin or baharat spice mix.\n\nChicken or lamb baked in the oven is very common with potatoes, and sometimes fried onions as well.\n\nTurkey schnitzel is an Israeli adaptation of veal schnitzel, and is an example of the transformations common in Israeli cooking. The schnitzel was brought to Israel by Jews from Central Europe, but before and during the early years of the State of Israel veal was unobtainable and chicken or turkey was an inexpensive and tasty substitute. Furthermore, a Wiener schnitzel is cooked in both butter and oil, but in Israel only oil is used, because of kashrut. Today, most cooks buy schnitzel already breaded and serve it with hummus, tahina, and other salads for a quick main meal. Other immigrant groups have added variations from their own backgrounds; Yemenite Jews, for example, flavor it with hawaij. In addition, vegetarian versions have become popular and the Israeli food company, Tiv′ol, was the first to produce a vegetarian schnitzel from a soya meat-substitute.\n\nVarious types of sausage are part of Sephardi and Mizrahi cuisine in Israel. Jews from Tunisia make a sausage, called \"osban\", with a filling of ground meat or liver, rice, chopped spinach, and a blend of herbs and spices. Jews from Syria make smaller sausages, called \"gheh\", with a different spice blend while Jews from Iraq make the sausages, called \"mumbar\", with chopped meat and liver, rice, and their traditional mix of spices.\n\nMoussaka is an oven-baked layer dish ground meat and eggplant casserole that, unlike its Levantine rivals, is served hot.\n\nMeat stews (chicken, lamb and beef) are cooked with spices, pine nuts herbs like parsley, mint and oregano, onion, tomato sauce or tahini or juices such as pomegranate molasses, pomegranate juice, pomegranate wine, grape wine, arak, date molasses and tamarind. Peas, chickpeas, white beans, cowpeas or green beans are sometimes also added.\n\nStuffed chicken in Israel is usually stuffed with rice, meat (lamb or beef), parsley, dried fruits like dates, apricots or raisins, spices like cinnamon, nutmeg or allspice; sometimes herbs like thyme and oregano (not the dried ones) are added on the top of the chicken to give it a flavor and than it is baked in the oven.\n\nMany fresh, high quality dairy products are available, such as cottage cheese, white cheeses, yogurts including \"leben\" and \"eshel\", yellow cheeses, and salt-brined cheeses typical of the Mediterranean region.\n\nDairy farming has been a major sector of Israeli agriculture since the founding of the state, and the yield of local milk cows is amongst the highest in the world. Initially, the \"moshavim\" (farming cooperatives) and \"kibbutzim\" produced mainly soft white cheese as it was inexpensive and nutritious. It became an important staple in the years of austerity and gained a popularity that it enjoys until today.\n\nSoft white cheese, gvina levana, is often referred to by its fat content, such as 5% or 9%. It is eaten plain, or mixed with fruit or vegetables, spread on bread or crackers and used in a variety of pies and pastries.\n\nLabneh is a yogurt-based white cheese common throughout the Balkans and the Middle East. It is sold plain, with za'atar, or in olive oil. It is often eaten for breakfast with other cheeses and bread. In the north of the country, Labneh balls preserved in olive oil are more common than in the central and the southern parts. Adding spices like za'atar, dried oregano or sumac and herbs like thyme, mint or scallions is common when preserving the Labneh balls. It is especially common to eat them during breakfast because meat is usually not eaten in the morning.\n\nTzfat cheese, a white cheese in brine, similar to feta, was first produced by the Meiri dairy in Safed in 1837 and is still produced there by descendants of the original cheese makers. The Meiri dairy also became famous for its production of the Balkan-style brinza cheese, which became known as Bulgarian cheese due to its popularity in the early 1950s among Jewish immigrants from Bulgaria. Other dairies now also produce many varieties of these cheeses. Bulgarian yogurt, introduced to Israel by Bulgarian Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, is used to make a traditional yogurt and cucumber soup.\n\nIn the early 1980s, small privately owned dairies began to produce handmade cheeses from goat and sheep’s milk as well as cow’s milk, resembling traditional cheeses like those made in rural France, Spain and Italy. Many are made with organic milk. These are now also produced by kibbutzim and the national Tnuva dairy.\n\nShakshuka, a North-African (Tunisian) dish of eggs poached in a spicy tomato sauce, is a national favorite, especially in the winter. It is traditionally served up in a cast iron pan with bread to mop up the sauce. Some variations of the dish are cooked with liberal use of ingredients such as eggplant, chili peppers, hot paprika, spinach, feta cheese or safed cheese.\n\nOmelette is seasoned with onions, herbs such as dill seeds (Shamir), spinach, parsley, mint, coriander and mallow with spices such as turmeric, cumin, sumac, cinnamon and cloves and with cheese such as Safed cheese and Feta cheese\n\nHaminados is an egg that is baked after being boiled it is baked alongside stew or meals, when it is in hamin when it is mainly taken outside the stew at morning for breakfast, it is also sometimes replaces normal egg at sabich.\nIt is also eaten as a breakfast alongside jachnun, grated tomatoes and skhug.\n\nIsrael is one of the world's leading fresh citrus producers and exporters, and more than forty types of fruit are grown in Israel, including citrus fruits such as oranges, grapefruit, tangerines and the \"pomelit,\" a hybrid of a grapefruit and a pomelo, developed in Israel. Fruits grown in Israel include avocados, bananas, apples, cherries, plums, lychees, nectarines, grapes, dates, strawberries, prickly pear (\"tzabbar\"), persimmon, loquat (\"shesek\") and pomegranates, and are eaten on a regular basis: Israelis consume an average of nearly of fruit per person a year.\n\nMany unique varieties of mango are native to the country, most having been developed during the second half of the 20th century. New and improved mango varieties are still introduced to markets every few years. Arguably the most popular variety is the Maya type, which is small to medium in size, fragrant, colourful (featuring 3-4 colours) and usually fiberless. The Israeli mango season begins in May, and the last of the fruit ripen as October draws near. Different varieties are present on markets at different months, with the Maya type seen between July and September. Mangos are frequently used in fusion dishes and for making Sorbet.\n\nA lot of Israelis keep fruit trees in their yards, citrus (especially orange and lemon) being the most common. Mangos are also now popular as household trees. Mulberry trees are frequently seen in public gardens, and their fruit is popularly served alongside various desserts and as a juice.\nFruit is served as a snack or dessert alongside other items or by themselves. Fresh-squeezed fruit juices are prepared at street kiosks, and sold bottled in supermarkets. Various fruits are added to chicken or meat dishes and fresh fruit salad and compote are often served at the end of the meal.\n\nThere is a strong tradition of home baking in Israel arising from the years when there were very few bakeries to meet demand. Many professional bakers came to Israel from Central Europe and founded local pastry shops and bakeries, often called \"konditoria\", thus shaping local tastes and preferences. There is now a local style with a wide selection of cakes and pastries that includes influences from other cuisines and combines traditional European ingredients with Mediterranean and Middle Eastern ingredients, such as halva, phyllo dough, dates, and rose water.\n\nExamples include citrus-flavored semolina cakes, moistened with syrup and called \"basbousa\", \"tishpishti\" or \"revani\" in Sephardic bakeries. The Ashkenazi babka has been adapted to include halva or chocolate spread, in addition to the old-fashioned cinnamon. There are also many varieties of apple cake. Cookies made with crushed dates (\"ma'amoul\") are served with coffee or tea, as throughout the Middle East.\n\nJerusalem kugel (\"kugel yerushalmi\") is an Israeli version of the traditional noodle pudding, kugel, made with caramelized sugar and spiced with black pepper. It was originally a specialty of the Ashkenazi Jews of the Old Yishuv. It is typically baked in a very low oven overnight and eaten after synagogue services on Sabbath morning.\n\nBourekas are savory pastries brought to Israel by Jews from Turkey, the Balkans and Salonika. They are made of a flaky dough in a variety of shapes, frequently topped with sesame seeds, and are filled with meat, chickpeas, cheese, spinach, potatoes or mushrooms. Bourekas are sold at kiosks, supermarkets and cafes, and are served at functions and celebrations, as well as being prepared by home cooks. They are often served as a light meal with hardboiled eggs and chopped vegetable salad.\n\nAshkenazi Jews from Vienna and Budapest brought sophisticated pastry making traditions to Israel. Sacher torte and Linzer torte are sold at professional bakeries, but cheesecake and strudel are also baked at home.\n\nJelly donuts (\"sufganiyot\"), traditionally filled with red jelly (jam), but also custard or dulce de leche, are eaten as Hanukkah treats.\n\nTahini cookies are an Israeli origin cookies made of tahini, flour, butter and sugar and usually topped with pine nuts.\n\nRugelach is very popular in Israel, commonly found in most cafes and bakeries. It is also a popular treat among American Jews.\n\nIn the Jewish communities of the Old Yishuv, bread was baked at home. Small commercial bakeries were set up in the mid-19th century. One of the earliest, Berman's Bakery, was established in 1875, and evolved from a cottage industry making home-baked bread and cakes for Christian pilgrims.\n\nExpert bakers who arrived among the immigrants from Eastern and Central Europe in the 1920s and 30s introduced handmade sourdough breads. From the 1950s, mass-produced bread replaced these loaves and standard, government subsidized loaves known as \"leḥem aḥid\" became mostly available until the 1980s, when specialized bakeries again began producing rich sourdough breads in the European tradition, and breads in a Mediterranean style with accents such as olives, cheese, herbs or sun-dried tomatoes. A large variety of breads is now available from bakeries and cafes.\n\nChallah bread is widely purchased or prepared for the Shabbat. Challah is typically an egg-enriched bread, often braided in the Ashkenazi tradition, or round for Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year.\nThe Shabbat and festival breads of the Yemenite Jews have become popular in Israel and can be bought frozen in supermarkets. Jachnun is very thinly rolled dough, brushed with oil or fat and baked overnight at a very low heat. It is traditionally served with a crushed or grated tomato dip, hard boiled eggs and skhug. \"Malawach\" is a thin circle of dough toasted in a frying pan. \"Kubaneh\" is a yeast dough baked overnight and traditionally served on Shabbat morning. \"Lahoh\" is a spongy, pancake-like bread made of fermented flour and water, and fried in a pan. Jews from Ethiopia make a similar bread called \"injera\" from millet flour.\nPita bread is a double-layered flat or pocket bread traditional in many Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines. It is baked plain, or with a topping of sesame or nigella seeds or za'atar. Pita is used in multiple ways, such as stuffed with falafel, salads or various meats as a snack or fast food meal; packed with schnitzel, salad and French fries for lunch; filled with chocolate spread as a snack for schoolchildren; or broken into pieces for scooping up hummus, eggplant and other dips. A \"lafa\" is larger, soft flatbread that is rolled up with a falafel or shawarma filling. Various ethnic groups continue to bake traditional flat breads. Jews from the former Soviet republic of Georgia make the flatbread, \"lavash\".\n\nBaklava is a nut-filled phyllo pastry sweetened with syrup served at celebrations in Jewish communities who originated in the Middle East. It is also often served in restaurants as dessert, along with small cups of Turkish coffee.\n\nKadaif is a pastry made from long thin noodle threads filled with walnuts or pistachios and sweetened with syrup; it is served alongside baklava.\n\nHalva is a sweet, made from tehina and sugar, and is popular in Israel. It is used to make original desserts like halva parfait.\n\nMa'amoul are small shortbread pastries filled with dates, pistachios or walnuts (or occasionally almonds, figs, or other fillings).\n\nOzne Haman is a sweet yeast dough filled with crushed nuts, raisins, dried apricots, dates, halva or strawberry jam then oven baked.\nIt is a specialty of Purim.\nThe triangular shape may have been influenced by old illustrations of Haman, in which he wore a three-cornered hat\n\nSunflower seeds, called \"garinim\" (literally, seeds), are eaten everywhere, on outings, at stadiums and at home. They are usually purchased unshelled and are cracked open with the teeth. They can be bought freshly roasted from shops and market stalls that specialize in nuts and seeds as well as packaged in supermarkets, along with the also well-liked pumpkin and watermelon seeds, pistachios, and sugar-coated peanuts.\n\nBamba is a soft, peanut-flavored snack food that is a favorite of children, and Bissli is a crunchy snack made of deep-fried dry pasta, sold in various flavors, including BBQ, pizza, falafel and onion.\n\n\"Malabi\" is a creamy pudding originating from Turkey prepared with milk or almond milk (for a kosher version) and cornstarch. It is sold as a street food from carts or stalls, in disposable cups with thick sweet syrup and various crunchy toppings such as chopped pistachios or coconut. Its popularity has resulted in supermarkets selling it in plastic packages and restaurants serving richer and more sophisticated versions using various toppings and garnishes such as berries and fruit. Sahlab is a similar dessert made from the powdered tubers of orchids and milk.\n\nWatermelon with Feta cheese salad is a popular dessert, sometimes mint is added to the salad.\n\n\"Krembo\" is a chocolate-coated marshmallow treat sold only in the winter, and is a very popular alternative to ice cream. It comes wrapped in colorful aluminum foil, and consists of a round biscuit base covered with a dollop of marshmallow cream coated in chocolate.\n\n\"Milky\" is a popular dairy pudding that comes in chocolate, vanilla and mocha flavors with a layer of whipped cream on top.\n\nChili-based hot sauces are prominent in Israeli food, and are based on green or red chili peppers. They are served with appetizers, felafel, casseroles and grilled meats, and are blended with hummus and tahina. Although originating primarily from North African and Yemenite immigrants, these hot sauces are now widely consumed.\n\n\"Skhug\" is a spicy chili pepper sauce brought to Israel by Yemenite Jews, and has become one of Israel's most popular condiments. It is added to falafel and hummus and is also spread over fish, and to white cheese, eggs, salami or avocado sandwiches for extra heat and spice.\n\nOther hot sauces made from chili peppers and garlic are the Tunisian \"harissa\", and the \"filfel chuma\" of the Libyan Jewish community in Israel.\n\n\"Amba\" is a pickled mango sauce, introduced by Iraqi Jews, and commonly used a condiment with shawarma, kebabs, meorav yerushalmi and falafel and vegetable salads.\n\nConcentrated juices made of grape, carob pomegranate and date are common in different regions, they are used at stews, soups or as a topping for desserts such as malabi and rice pudding.\n\nAlmond syrup flavored with rose water or orange blossom water is a common flavor for desserts and sometimes added to cocktails such as arak.\n\nThere is a strong coffee-drinking culture in Israel. Coffee is prepared as instant (\"nes\"), iced, latte (\"hafuḥ\"), Italian-style espresso, or Turkish coffee, which is sometimes flavored with cardamom (\"hel\"). Jewish writers, artists, and musicians from Germany and Austria who immigrated to Israel before the Second World War introduced the model of the Viennese coffee house with its traditional décor, relaxed atmosphere, coffee and pastries.\n\nCafés are found everywhere in urban areas and function as meeting places for socializing and conducting business. Almost all serve baked goods and sandwiches and many also serve light meals. There are both chains and locally owned neighborhood cafés. Most have outdoor seating to take advantage of Israel's Mediterranean climate. Tel Aviv is particularly well known for its café culture.\n\nTea is also a widely consumed beverage and is served at cafés and drunk at home. Tea is prepared in many ways, from plain brewed Russian and Turkish-style black tea with sugar, to tea with lemon or milk, and, available as a common option in most establishments, Middle Eastern-style with mint (\"nana\").\nTea with Rose water is also common.\n\nLimonana, a type of lemonade made from freshly-squeezed lemons and mint, was invented in Israel in the early 1990s and has become a summer staple throughout the Middle East.\n\nRimonana is similar to Limonana, made of Pomegranate juice and mint.\n\n\"Sahlab\" is a drinkable pudding once made of the powdered bulb of the orchid plant but today usually made with cornstarch. It is usually sold in markets or by street vendors, especially in the winter. It is topped with cinnamon and chopped pistachios.\n\nMalt beer, known as black beer (בִירָה שְחוֹרָה, \"bira shḥora\"), is a non-alcoholic beverage produced in Israel since pre-state times. Goldstar and Maccabi are Israeli beers. Recently, some small boutique breweries began brewing new brands of beer, such as Dancing Camel, Negev, and Can'an.\n\nArak is a Levantine alcoholic spirit (~40–63% Alc. Vol./~80–126 proof) from the anis drinks family, common in Israel and throughout the Middle East. It is a clear, colorless, unsweetened anise-flavored distilled alcoholic drink (also labeled as an Apéritif). It is often served neat or mixed with ice and water, which creates a reaction turning the liquor a milky-white colour. It is sometimes also mixed with grapefruit juice to create a cocktail known as 'Arak eshkoliyyot', literally 'Arak grapefruit'.\n\nOther spirits, brandies, liquors can be found across the country in many villages and towns.\n\nThe vast majority of Israelis drink wine in moderation, and almost always at meals or social occasions. Israelis drink about 6.5 liters of wine per person per year, which is low compared to other wine-drinking Mediterranean countries, but the per capita amount has been increasing since the 1980s as Israeli production of high-quality wine grows to meet demand, especially of semi-dry and dry wines. In addition to Israeli wines, an increasing number of wines are imported from France, Italy, Australia, the United States, Chile and Argentina.\n\nMost of the wine produced and consumed from the 1880s was sweet, kosher wine when the Carmel Winery was established, until the 1980s, when more dry or semi-dry wines began to be produced and consumed after the introduction of the Golan Heights Winery’s first vintage. The winery was the first to focus on planting and making wines from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, white Riesling and Gewürztraminer. These wines are kosher and have won silver and gold medals in international competitions. Israeli wine is now produced by hundreds of wineries, ranging in size from small boutique wineries in the villages to large companies producing over ten million bottles per year, which are also exported worldwide.\n\nWine made of fruits other than grapes such as fig, cherry, pomegranate, carob and date are also common in the country.\n\nFoods variously prohibited in Jewish dietary laws (Kashrut) and in Muslim dietary laws (Halal) may also be included in pluralistic Israel's diverse cuisine. Although partly legally restricted, pork and shell-fish are available at many non-kosher restaurants (only around a third of Israeli restaurants have a kosher license) and some stores all over the country which are widely spread, including by the Maadaney Mizra, Tiv Ta'am and Maadanei Mania supermarket chains. A modern Hebrew euphemism for pork is \"white meat\". Despite Jewish and Muslim religious restrictions on the consumption of pork, pigmeat consumption per capita was 2.7 kg in 2009. A 2008 survey reported that about half of Israeli Jews do not always observe kashrut. Israel's anomalous equanimity toward its religious dietary restrictions may be reflected by the fact that some of the Hebrew cookbooks of Yisrael Aharoni are published in two versions: kosher and non-kosher editions.\n\nIn Israel, as in many other Middle Eastern countries, \"street food\" is a kind of fast food that is sometimes literally eaten while standing in the street, while in some cases there are places to sit down. The following are some foods that are usually eaten in this way:\n\n\"Falafel\" are fried balls or patties of spiced, mashed chickpeas or fava beans and are a common Middle Eastern street food that have become identified with Israeli cuisine. Falafel is most often served in a pita, with pickles, tahina, hummus, cut vegetable salad and often, \"harif\", a hot sauce, the type used depending on the origin of the falafel maker. Variations include green falafel, which include parsley and coriander, red falafel made with \"filfel chuma\", yellow falafel made with turmeric, and falafel coated with sesame seeds.\n\n\"Shawarma\", (from \"çevirme\", meaning \"rotating\" in Turkish) is usually made in Israel with turkey, with lamb fat added. The shawarma meat is sliced and marinated and then roasted on a huge rotating skewer. The cooked meat is shaved off and stuffed into a pita, plainly with hummus and tahina, or with additional trimmings such as fresh or fried onion rings, French fries, salads and pickles. More upscale restaurant versions are served on an open flat bread, a \"lafa\", with steak strips, flame roasted eggplant and salads.\n\n\"Shakshouka\", originally a workman’s breakfast popularized by North African Jews in Israel, is made simply of fried eggs in spicy tomato sauce, with other vegetable ingredients or sausage optional. Shakshouka is typically served in the same frying pan in which it is cooked, with thick slices of white bread to mop up the sauce, and a side of salad. Modern variations include a milder version made with spinach and feta without tomato sauce, and hot chili shakshouka, a version that includes both sweet and hot peppers and coriander. Shakshouka in pita is called \"shakshouka be-pita\". \n\"Jerusalem mixed grill\", or \"me'urav Yerushalmi\", consists of mixed grill of chicken giblets and lamb with onion, garlic and spices. It is one of Jerusalem’s most popular and profitable street foods.\nAlthough the origin of the dish is in Jerusalem, it is today common in all of the cities and towns in Israel.\n\n\"Jerusalem bagels\", unlike the round, boiled and baked bagels popularized by Ashkenazi Jews, are long and oblong-shaped, made from bread dough, covered in za’atar or sesame seeds, and are soft, chewy and sweet. They have become a favorite snack for football match crowds, and are also served in hotels as well as at home.\n\n\"Malabi\" is a creamy pudding originating from Turkey prepared with milk or cream and cornstarch. It is sold as a street food from carts or stalls, in disposable cups with thick sweet syrup and various crunchy toppings such as chopped pistachios or coconut. Its popularity has resulted in supermarkets selling it in plastic packages and restaurants serving richer and more sophisticated versions using various toppings and garnishes such as berries and fruit. Sahlab is a similar dessert made from the powdered tubers of orchids and milk.\n\n\"Sabikh\" is a traditional sandwich that Mizrahi Jews introduced to Israel and is sold at kiosks throughout the country, but especially in Ramat-Gan, where it was first introduced. Sabiḥ is a pita filled with fried eggplant, hardboiled egg, salad, tehina and pickles.\n\n\"Tunisian sandwich\" is usually made from a baguette with various fillings that may include tuna, egg, pickled lemon, salad, and fried hot green pepper.\n\nThere are thousands of restaurants, casual eateries, cafés and bars in Israel, offering a wide array of choices in food and culinary styles. Places to eat out that are distinctly Israeli include the following:\n\n\"Falafel stands\" or kiosks are common in every neighborhood. Falafel vendors compete to stand apart from their competitors and this leads to the offering of additional special extras like chips, deep fried eggplant, salads and pickles for the price of a single portion of falafel.\n\n\"Hummusia\" is an establishment that offers mainly hummus with a limited selection of extras such as tahina, hardboiled egg, falafel, onion, pickles, lemon and garlic sauce and pita or taboon bread.\n\n\"Misada Mizrahit\" (literally \"Eastern restaurant\") refers to Mizrahi Jewish, middle eastern or Arabic restaurants. These popular and relatively inexpensive establishments often offer a selection of meze salads followed by grilled meat with a side of french fries and a simple dessert such as chocolate mousse for dessert.\n\n\"Steakiyot\" are meat grills selling sit down and take away chicken, turkey or lamb as steak, shishlik, kebab and even Jerusalem mixed grill, all in pita or in taboon bread.\n\nFriday night (eve of Sabbath) dinners are usually family and socially oriented meals. Along with family favorites, and varying to some extent according to ethnic background, traditional dishes are served, such as challah bread, chicken soup, salads, chicken or meat dishes, and cakes or fruits for dessert.\n\nShabbat lunch is also an important social meal. Since antiquity, Jewish communities all over the world devised meat casseroles that begin cooking before the lighting of candles that marks the commencement of the Sabbath on Friday night, so as to comply with the religious regulations for observing the Sabbath. In modern Israel, this filling dish, in many variations, is still eaten on the Sabbath day, not only in religiously observant households, and is also served in some restaurants during the week.\n\nThe basic ingredients are meat and beans or rice simmered overnight on a hotplate or \"blech\", or placed in a slow oven. Ashkenazi \"cholent\" usually contains meat, potatoes, barley and beans, and sometimes kishke, and seasonings such as pepper and paprika. Sephardi \"hamin\" contains chicken or meat, rice, beans, garlic, sweet or regular potatoes, seasonings such as turmeric and cinnamon, and whole eggs in the shell known as \"haminados\". Moroccan Jews prepare variations known as \"dafina\" or \"skhina\" (or \"s′hina\") with meat, onion, marrow bones, potatoes, chickpeas, wheat berries, eggs and spices such as turmeric, cumin, paprika and pepper. Iraqi Jews prepare \"tebit\", using chicken and rice.\n\nFor desserts or informal gatherings on Shabbat, home bakers still bake a wide variety of cakes on Fridays to be enjoyed on the Sabbath, or purchased from bakeries or stores, cakes such as sponge cake, citrus semolina cake, cinnamon or chocolate babkas, and fruit and nut cakes.\n\nRosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, is widely celebrated with festive family meals and symbolic foods. Sweetness is the main theme and the Rosh Hashana dinners typically begin with apples dipped in honey, and end with honey cake. The challah is usually round, often studded with raisins and drizzled with honey, and other symbolic fruits and vegetables are eaten as an entree, such as pomegranates, carrots, leeks and beets. Fish dishes, symbolizing abundance, are served; for example, gefilte fish is traditional for Ashkenazim, while Moroccan Jews prepare the spicy fish dish, \"chraime\". Honey cake (\"lekach\") is often served as dessert, accompanied by tea or coffee.\nDishes cooked with pomegranate juice are common during this period.\n\nThe holiday of Hanukkah is marked by the consumption of traditional Hanukkah foods fried in oil in commemoration of the miracle in which a small quantity of oil sufficient for one day lasted eight days.\n\nThe two most popular Hannukah foods are potato pancakes, \"levivot\", also known by the Yiddish \"latkes\"; and jelly doughnuts, known as \"sufganiyot\" in Hebrew, \"pontshkes\" (in Yiddish) or \"bimuelos\" (in Ladino), as these are deep-fried in oil. Hannukah pancakes are made from a variety of ingredients, from the traditional potato or cheese, to more modern innovations, among them corn, spinach, zucchini and sweet potato.\n\nBakeries in Israel have popularized many new types of fillings for \"sufganiyot\" besides the standard strawberry jelly filling, and these include chocolate, vanilla or cappuccino cream, and others. In recent years downsized, \"mini\" \"sufganiyot\" have also appeared due to concerns about calories.\n\nTu Bishvat is a minor Jewish holiday, usually sometime in late January or early February, that marks the \"New Year of the Trees\". Customs include planting trees and eating dried fruits and nuts, especially figs, dates, raisins, carob, and almonds.\n\nMany Israelis, both religious and secular, celebrate with a kabbalistic-inspired Tu Bishvat seder that includes a feast of fruits and four cups of wine according to the ceremony presented in special \"haggadot\" modeled on the Haggadah of Passover for this purpose.\n\nThe festival of Purim celebrates the deliverance of the Jewish people from the plot of Haman to annihilate them in the ancient Persian Achaemenid Empire, as described in the Book of Esther. It is a day of rejoicing and merriment, on which children, and many adults, wear costumes. It is customary to eat a festive meal, \"seudat Purim\", in the late afternoon, often with wine as the prominent beverage, in keeping with the atmosphere of merry-making.\n\nMany people prepare packages of food that they give to neighbors, friends, family, and colleagues on Purim. These are called \"mishloach manot\" (\"sending of portions\"), and often include wine and baked goods, fruit and nuts, and sweets.\n\nThe food most associated with Purim is called \"ozne haman\" (\"Haman's ears\"). These are three-cornered pastries filled most often with poppy seed, but also other fruit fillings. The triangular shape may have been influenced by old illustrations of Haman, in which he wore a three-cornered hat.\n\nThe week-long holiday of Passover in the spring commemorates the Exodus from Egypt, and in Israel is usually a time for visiting friends and relatives, travelling, and on the first night of Passover, the traditional ritual dinner, known as the Seder. Foods containing \"ḥametz\" – leaven or yeast – may not be eaten during Passover. This means bread, pastries and certain fermented beverages, such as beer, cannot be consumed. Ashkenazim also do not eat legumes, known as \"kitniyot\". Over the centuries, Jewish cooks have developed dishes using alternative ingredients and this characterizes Passover food in Israel today.\n\nChicken soup with matza dumplings \"(kneidlach)\" is often a starter for the Seder meal among Israelis of all the ethnic backgrounds. Spring vegetables, such as asparagus and artichokes often accompany the meal.\n\nRestaurants in Israel have come up with creative alternatives to \"ḥametz\" ingredients to create pasta, hamburger buns, pizza, and other fast foods in kosher-for-Passover versions by using potato starch and other non-standard ingredients.\n\nAfter Passover, the celebration of Mimouna takes place, a tradition brought to Israel by the Jewish communities of North Africa. In the evening, a feast of fruit, confectionery and pastries is set out for neighbors and visitors to enjoy. Most notably, the first leaven after Passover, a thin crepe called a mofletta, eaten with honey, syrup or jam, is served. The occasion is celebrated the following day by outdoor picnics at which salads and barbecued meat feature prominently.\n\nIn the early summer, the Jewish harvest festival of Shavuot is celebrated. Shavuot marks the peak of the new grain harvest and the ripening of the first fruits, and is a time when milk was historically most abundant. To celebrate this holiday, many types of dairy foods are eaten. These include cheeses and yogurts, cheese-based pies and quiches called \"pashtidot\", cheese blintzes, and cheesecake prepared with soft white cheese (\"gvina levana\") or cream cheese.\n\n\n\n"}

The concept of \"Ajiva\" in Jainism means \"not soul\", and represents matter (including body), time, space, non-motion and motion. In Jainism, a \"Jiva\" is either \"samsari\" (mundane, caught in cycle of rebirths) or \"mukta\" (liberated).\n\nThe concept of \"jiva\" in Jainism is similar to \"atman\" in Hinduism. However, some Hindu traditions differentiate between the two concepts, with \"jiva\" considered as individual self, while atman as that which is universal unchanging self that is present in all living beings and everything else as the metaphysical Brahman. The latter is sometimes referred to as \"jiva-atman\" (a soul in a living body).\n\nThe word itself originates from the Sanskrit \"jivás\", with the root \"jīv-\" \"to breathe\". It has the same Indo-European root as the Latin word \"vivus\", meaning \"alive\".\n\n\n"}

It is suggested that the acolytes are representations of the two major Mahāyāna texts, the \"Lotus Sūtra\" and the \"Avataṃsaka Sūtra\", in which Longnü and Sudhana appear, respectively.\n\nThe depiction of Longnü and Sudhana with Avalokiteśvara may have been influenced by the \"Jade Maiden\" () and \"Golden Youth\" () who both appear in the iconography of the Jade Emperor. She is described as being the eight-year-old daughter of the Dragon King (; Sanskrit: \"nāgarāja\") of the East Sea.\n\nLongnü is depicted in the 12th Chapter of the \"Lotus Sūtra\" (Skt. \"Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra\") as being full of wisdom and achieving instant enlightenment. In the \"Lotus Sūtra\", Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva speaks of her, saying:\n\nThere is the daughter of the nāga king Sāgara who is only eight years old. She is wise; her faculties are sharp; and she also well knows all the faculties and deeds of sentient beings. She has attained the power of recollection. She preserves all the profound secret treasures of the Buddhas, enters deep in meditation, and is well capable of discerning all dharmas. She instantly produced the thought of enlightenment (Skt. \"bodhicitta\") and has attained the stage of nonretrogression. She has unhindered eloquence and thinks of sentient beings with as much compassion as if they were her own children. Her virtues are perfect. Her thoughts and explanations are subtle and extensive, merciful, and compassionate. She has a harmonious mind and has attained enlightenment.\n\nHowever, the Buddha's disciple Śāriputra, a Sravaka, does not believe that a woman can attain buddhahood. In response, the nāga maiden offers a pearl to the Buddha, symbolizing her life and ego, and he accepts it. She then instantly transforms into a perfected male bodhisattva, and then attains complete enlightenment. \nAccording to Schuster, the Lotus Sutra´s argument \"is directed against the notion that some bodies (male) are fit for the highest destinies, and other bodies (female) are not.\"\n\nIn Chan Buddhism, the story was taken as an example to emphasize the potential of sudden awakening.\n\nA single chapter in the \"Complete Tale of Avalokiteśvara and the Southern Seas\" (), a sixteenth century Ming Dynasty novel is the first text that connects Longnü and Sudhana together as being acolytes of Avalokiteśvara. When the Dragon King's third son was out for swim in the sea in the form of a carp, he was captured by a fisherman. Unable to transform into his dragon form due to being trapped on land, he was going to be sold and butchered at the local market. Once Avalokiteśvara learned of his predicament, she gave Shancai all her money and sent him to buy him from the market and set him free. Because the carp was still alive hours after it was caught, this drew a large crowd and soon a bidding war started due to people believing that eating this fish would grant them immortality. Shancai was easily outbid and begged the fish seller to spare the life of the fish, but to no avail and earning the scorn of the people at the market. It was then that Avalokiteśvara projected her voice from far away saying, \"A life should definitely belong to one who tries to save it, not one who tries to take it\". The crowd realizing their mistake soon dispersed and Shancai was able to bring the carp back to Avalokiteśvara and return it to the sea.\n\nAs a token of gratitude, the Dragon King asked Ao Guang to bring the \"Pearl of Light\", but his granddaughter volunteers to go in his father's place instead. After offering the pearl to Avalokiteśvara, she decides to stay with her and become her disciple to learn the Buddhist Dharma.\n\nUnlike the \"Complete Tale of Avalokiteśvara and the Southern Seas\" which only briefly mentions Longnü, the \"Precious Scroll of Sudhana and Longnü\" (), an eighteenth-nineteenth century scroll consisting of 29 folios, is completely devoted to the legend of Longnü and Sudhana and seems to have a Taoist origin. The text is set during the Qianfu period of the Tang Dynasty. One day when Sudhana is walking down a mountain path to visit his father he hears a voice crying out for help. Upon investigation, it turns out to be the voice of a snake trapped in a bottle for the last eighteen years. The snake begs Sudhana to release her, upon which she turn into her true form, that of a monster, and threatens to eat him. When Sudhana protests at the snake's behavior, she makes the argument that than \"ēn\" (恩, a kind act) is repaid by a feud, and that is the way of the world. However, the snake agrees to submit the argument to three judges.\n\nThe first judge the argument is presented to is the human incarnation of the Golden Water Buffalo Star, who agrees with the snake, given its past experience with humans. The Buffalo Star relates how it never wanted to descend to earth but was pushed out of the gates of heaven by Kṣitigarbha who took pity on the toiling masses. Kṣitigarbha vowed that if the humans did not repay a favor with a favor, his eyes would fall out and drop to the ground. Because of the Buffalo Star's fall to earth, which was face first, it lost all of its upper front teeth. It suffered greatly at the hands of humans; after years of toiling for its master, it was butchered and eaten. Because of this, Kṣitigarbha's eyes did indeed fall out, and transformed into the snails that the buffaloes now trample on when it plows the fields.\n\nThe second judge they encounter is the Taoist priest Zhuangzi, who also agrees with the snake, citing an experience he had when he resurrected a skeleton who then immediately took Zhuangzi to court and accused him of stealing his money.\n\nThe last judge they meet is a young girl. The girl tells the snake that it can eat her as well, if the snake could show her how it was able to fit into the bottle which Sudhana had released it from. As soon as the snake worms itself back into the bottle, it is trapped. The girl then reveals herself to be Avalokiteśvara. When the snake begs for mercy, Avalokiteśvara tells it that in order to be saved, it must engage itself in religious exercises in the Grotto of the Sounds of the Flood (present day Fayu Temple) on Mount Putuo.\n\nThree years later, Sudhana formally becomes an acolyte of Avalokiteśvara along with the Filial Parrot. After the snake has submitted itself to seven years of austerity, it cleanses itself of its poison and produces a pearl. It then transforms into Longnü and becomes an acolyte of Avalokiteśvara.\n\n\n\n"}

The strict regimes in the institutions were often more severe than those found in the prisons; this contradicted the perceived outlook that they were meant to treat the women as opposed to punishing them. \"The heat was unbelievable. You couldn’t leave your station unless a bell went” (Reilly, 2013). Laundries such as this operated throughout Europe and North America for much of the nineteenth and well into the twentieth century, the last one closing in 1996. The institutions were named after the Biblical figure Mary Magdalene, in earlier centuries characterised as a reformed prostitute.\n\nThe first Magdalene institution was founded in late 1758 in Whitechapel, England, which led to the establishment of a similar institution in Ireland by 1767. \nThe first Magdalene asylum in the United States was the Magdalen Society of Philadelphia, founded in 1800; other North American cities, including New York, Boston, Chicago, and Toronto, quickly followed suit. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Magdalene asylums were common in several countries. By 1900, there were more than 300 asylums in England and more than 20 in Scotland.\n\nFrom the early 1890s to the 1960s, most Australian state capitals had a large convent which contained a commercial laundry where the work was done by mostly teenage girls who were placed in the convent, voluntarily or involuntarily, for reasons such as being destitute, uncontrollable, or picked up by the police. According to James Franklin, the girls came from a variety of very disturbed and deprived backgrounds and were individually hard to deal with in many cases.\n\nLaundry work was regarded as suitable as it did not require much training nor substantial capital expense. Memories of conditions in the convent laundries by former inmates are consistently negative, detailing verbal abuse and very hard work. In accordance with the traditions of the nuns, much of the day proceeded in silence. Like orphanages, they received almost no government funds. As in any underfunded institution, the food was described as bland. The nuns shared the conditions of the inmates, such as the bad food, hard work, the confinement and the long periods of silence. Education for residents was either of poor quality or lacking altogether. There was no physical contact on the part of the sisters, and no emotional contact in the sense of listening to the girls' own concerns.\n\nDangers included diseases and workplace accidents. In 1889 one of the sisters of Abbotsford lost her hand in an accident involving laundry machinery. Conditions of manual work were harsh everywhere. The state-run Parramatta Girls Home, which also had a laundry, had similar harsh conditions but a worse record for assaults.\n\nThe asylums were initially established as refuges, with the residents free to leave. In the early 1900s, they reluctantly began to accept court referrals. \"They took in girls whom no-one else wanted and who were forcibly confined, contrary to the wishes of both the girls and the nuns.\" A 1954 report of the \"Sun Herald\" of a visit to the Ashfield laundry found 55 girls there involuntarily, 124 voluntary inmates including 65 mentally challenged adult women and about 30 who were originally there involuntarily but had stayed on, with dormitories described as seriously overcrowded.\n\nThe Congregation of the Sisters of Misericorde was founded in 1848 by Marie-Rosalie Cadron-Jetté, a widow skilled as a midwife. Their network of asylums developed from their care of unmarried expectant mothers. The Misericordia Sisters endeavored to carry out their ministry discreetly, for the public was neither supportive of their cause nor charitable. The sisters were accused of \"encouraging vice\". The order was particularly sensitive to the social stigma attached to a woman who had borne an illegitimate child. The sisters perceived that, by precluding other employment, this often tended to force a woman into prostitution, and in some cases infanticide. According to Sulpician Father Éric Sylvestre, \"\"When food was scarce, Rosalie would fast so that the moms could eat. She was fond of saying that 'Single mothers are the treasure of the house.'\"\n\n\"In receiving patients no discrimination is made in regard to religion, colour, or nationality. After their convalescence, those who desire to remain in the home are placed under a special sister and are known as 'Daughters of St. Margaret'. They follow a certain rule of life but contract no religious obligations. Should they desire to remain in the convent, after a period of probation, they are allowed to become Magdalens and eventually make the vows of the Magdalen institute.\"\n\nIn 1858 Elizabeth Dunlop and others founded the Toronto Magdalene Laundries with the stated goal of \"eliminating prostitution by rehabilitating prostitutes\".\n\nThe first Magdalen institution, Magdalen Hospital for the Reception of Penitent Prostitutes, was founded in late 1758 in London by Robert Dingley, a silk merchant, Jonas Hanway and John Fielding. The services and crafts that the women worked at helped provide support for the house. As it was agreed that the Magdalenes should receive some practical reward for their service, the women were given a small sum of money. Additional income was generated by promoting the house as a tourist attraction for the upper-classes. Horace Walpole, Fourth Earl of Orford, described staging one of these entertainments. (This was in keeping with visits to Bethlem Royal Hospital and the Foundling Hospital.) Historians estimate that by the late 1800s there were more than 300 Magdalen Institutions in England alone.\n\nThe writer Charles Dickens and the philanthropist Angela Burdett-Coutts set up an alternative in 1846, thinking the Magdalen Hospitals too harsh. At Urania Cottage the young women were prepared for re-entry into mainstream society, or for emigration to the colonies.\n\nBy the late 1800s many of the institutions had departed from the original model and resembled penitentiary work-houses. However, as these were viewed as commercial workshops and factories they were subject to labor regulations and inspections. The Factory Act (1901) limited working hours for girls of thirteen to eighteen years of age to twelve hours a day. Magdalene laundries, in one format or another, were found in many of the major industrial centres of England and Wales, examples including the Convent of the Good Shepherd at Penylan, Cardiff. This was a common name for such instiutions.\n\nThe first laundry or asylum, a Church of Ireland run institution, \"Magdalen Asylum for Penitent Females\", opened in Ireland on Leeson Street in Dublin in 1765, founded by Lady Arabella Denny. The last Magdalene Laundry closed in 1996 in Waterford City in Ireland. This Building is now Waterford Institute of Technology. In Belfast, in Northern Ireland, the Church of Ireland-run Ulster Magdalene Asylum was founded in 1839, while parallel institutions were run by Catholics and Presbyterians. “a mechanism that society, religious orders and the state came up with to try and get rid of people deemed not to conforming to the so-called… Irish identity” (Ferriter, 2013).The Irish government claimed that the State was not legally responsible for the abuse suffered by women and girls in the Magdalene Laundries.(Hibernian Law Journal)\n\nThe discovery in 1993 of a mass grave on the grounds of a former convent in Dublin led to media articles about the operations of the institutions, and ultimately to a call on the part of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child for a government inquiry. A formal state apology was issued in 2013, and a €60 million compensation scheme was set up. The four religious institutes that ran the Irish asylums have not as yet contributed to compensate the survivors of abuse, despite demands from the Irish government, and the UN Committee Against Torture. The sisters continue to care for more than 100 elderly Magdalene women who remain in their care.\n\nSenator Martin McAleese chaired an Inter-Departmental Committee to establish the facts of State involvement with the Magdalen Laundries. An Interim Report was released in October 2011. In 2013 the BBC did a special investigation, Sue Lloyd-Roberts' \"Demanding justice for women and children abused by Irish nuns.\" The Sisters of Mercy, Sisters of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd, and Sisters of Charity, have ignored requests by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the UN Committee Against Torture to contribute to the compensation fund for victims including 600 still alive in March 2014.\n\n\"The Magdalene Sisters\", a 2002 film by Peter Mullan, is based on historical facts about four young women incarcerated in a Magdalene Laundry in Ireland from 1964 to 1968\n\nSince 2011 a monument has been erected in Ennis, County Clare 'in appreciation' of the Sisters of Mercy who had an industrial school and a Magdalene laundry in the town. In 2015 Ennis municipal council decided to honour the same order by renaming a road in honour of the Sisters of Mercy for their compassionate service to vulnerable women and children . The road runs through the site of the former industrial school and laundry. There are conflicting viewpoints on the appropriateness of these symbolic representations in Ennis.\n\nIn Sweden, the first Magdalene asylum (\"Magdalenahem\") was founded in Stockholm by the philanthropist Emilie Elmblad in 1852, and around the year 1900, there were eight asylums in Sweden, of which half were managed by the Salvation Army. \n\nThe purpose of the Magdalene asylum in Sweden was to educate former female prostitutes in a different profession, to make it possible for them to support themselves by some other means than prostitution when they left the asylum. In practice, they were trained in domestic occupations in the asylums, and the goal of the asylums were to acquire employment as domestic servants for them in private homes, preferably with religious employers. As the asylums was normally managed by religious women philanthropists such as Elsa Borg, the goal was not only to provide them with employment but also to make them religious, as this was considered to prevent them from returning to prostitution. The asylums provided the clients with factory work only if the first choice of being a domestic in a private religious home failed, and employment in a public establishment, such as a hotel or a restaurant, was the last choice, as such work was considered to be a great risk from reentering prostitution.\n\nThis was in line with several other common private charitable establishments especially in Stockholm, which provided poor women in the cities with shelter and employment (normally as domestics), to prevent them from becoming prostitutes.\n\nThe asylums were charity institutions and founded in great part by the work of the women in domestic training there. Initially, women were paid for their work, but this was abandoned when it was thought that it made women less inclined to follow rules. In Sweden, the majority of the inmates of the Magdalena asylums had themselves voluntarily committed, but there were cases known when a woman was committed by her family or by the authorities.\n\nThe Magdalena Asylum in Stockholm was closed in 1895.\n\nAsylum records show that in the early history of the Magdalene movement many women entered and left the institutions of their own accord, sometimes repeatedly. Lu Ann De Cunzo wrote in her book, \"Reform, Respite, Ritual: An Archaeology of Institutions; The Magdalene Society of Philadelphia, 1800–1850\", that the women in Philadelphia's asylum \"sought a refuge and a respite from disease, the prison or almshouse, unhappy family situations, abusive men, and dire economic circumstances.\" In its early years, the Magdalen Society Asylum functioned as a refuge for prostitutes. Most of these stayed only a few days or a few weeks, just long enough to get reclothed and recuperated. Attempts at rehabilitation met with little success. In 1877, the asylum was changed into a home for wayward girls, with a rule requiring a stay for twelve months. As the Magdalen Society Asylum became more selective, relaxed its emphasis on personal guilt and salvation, and standardized in some respects the treatment of the inmates, its rate of failure diminished.\n\nThe Penitent Females' Refuge Society of Boston was incorporated in 1823.\n\nNew York's Magdalen Society was established in 1830 with the purpose of rescuing women from lives of prostitution and vice, sometimes kidnapping them from brothels. In 1907 a new home was established in the Inwood section of Manhattan. This was the second time the Society found it necessary to move to a larger facility. Many of the young women who passed through the doors of the Inwood institution had worked the taverns, brothels, and alleyways of lower Manhattan before being \"rescued\" by the Society. Girls were generally committed for a period of three years. Through the years, several girls died or were injured climbing out of windows in failed escape attempts. In 1917, the Magdalen Benevolent Society changed its name to Inwood House. In the early 1920s, bichloride of mercury was commonly used to treat new arrivals for venereal disease, resulting in a number of cases of mercury poisoning. The property was later sold and the agency relocated. Inwood House continues to operate, with its main focus on teen pregnancy.\n\nThe president of the Catholic League, a U.S. advocacy group, published a statement titled \"Myths of the Magdalene Laundries\" in July 2013, which defends the laundries and attacks inmates and whistleblowers.\n\n\nSources\n\n\n"}

{"id": "28173346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28173346", "title": "Musar literature", "text": "Musar literature\n\nMusar literature is didactic Jewish ethical literature which describes virtues and vices and the path towards perfection in a methodical way.\n\nMusar literature is often described as \"ethical literature.\" Professors Isaiah Tishby and Joseph Dan have described it more precisely as \"prose literature that presents to a wide public views, ideas, and ways of life in order to shape the everyday behavior, thought, and beliefs of this public.\" Musar literature traditionally depicts the nature of moral and spiritual perfection in a methodical way. It is \"divided according to the component parts of the ideal righteous way of life; the material is treated methodically – analyzing, explaining, and demonstrating how to achieve each moral virtue (usually treated in a separate chapter or section) in the author's ethical system.\"\n\nMusar literature can be distinguished from other forms of Jewish ethical literature such as aggadic narrative and halakhic literature.\n\nIn Judaism, ethical monotheism originated, and along with it came the highly didactic ethics in the Torah and Tanach.\n\nAn example from the Tanakh is the earliest known text of the positive form of the famous \"Golden Rule\":\nPirkei Avot () (\"Chapters of the Fathers\") is a compilation of the ethical teachings and maxims of the Rabbis of the Mishnaic period. It is part of didactic Jewish ethical Musar literature. Because of its contents, it is also called Ethics of the Fathers. The teachings of Pirkei Avot appear in the Mishnaic tractate of \"Avot\", the second-to-last tractate in the order of Nezikin in the Mishnah. Pirkei Avot is unique in that it is the only tractate of the Mishnah dealing \"solely\" with ethical and moral principles; there is little or no halacha found in Pirkei Avot.\n\nMedieval works of Musar literature were composed by a range of rabbis and others, including rationalist philosophers and adherents of Kabbalistic mysticism. Joseph Dan has argued that medieval Musar literature reflects four different approaches: the philosophical approach; the standard rabbinic approaches; the approach of Chassidei Ashkenaz; and the Kabbalistic approach.\n\nPhilosophical works of Musar include \"Chovot ha-Levavot\" by Bahya ibn Paquda and \"Hilchot Deot\" and \"The Eight Chapters\" by Maimonides.\n\nRabbinic Musar literature came as a reaction to philosophical literature, and tried to show that the Torah and standard rabbinic literature taught about the nature of virtue and vice without recourse to Aristotelian or other philosophical concepts. Classic works of this sort include\n\nSimilar works were produced by rabbis who were Kabbalists but whose Musar writings did not bear a kabbalistic character: Nahmanides' \"Sha'ar ha-Gemul,\" which focuses on various categories of just and wicked people and their punishments in the world to come; and Rabbi Bahya ben Asher's \"Kad ha-Kemah.\"\n\nExplicitly Kabbalistic mystical works of Musar literature include \"Tomer Devorah\" (\"The Palm Tree of Deborah\") by Moses ben Jacob Cordovero, \"Reshit Chochmah\" by Eliyahu de Vidas, and \"Kav ha-Yashar\" by Zevi Hirsch Koidonover.\n\nChassidei Ashkenaz (literally \"the Pious of Germany\") was a Jewish movement in the 12th century and 13th century founded by Rabbi Judah the Pious (Rabbi Yehuda HeChassid) of Regensburg, Germany, which was concerned with promoting Jewish piety and morality. The most famous work of Musar literature produced by this school was \"The Book of the Pious\" (Sefer Chassidim).\n\nLiterature in the genre of Musar literature continued to be written by modern Jews from a variety of backgrounds.\n\nMesillat Yesharim is a Musar text published in Amsterdam by Moshe Chaim Luzzatto in the 18th century. Mesillat Yesharim is perhaps the most important work of Musar literature of the post-medieval period. The Vilna Gaon commented that he couldn't find a superfluous word in the first seven chapters of the work, and stated that he would have traveled to meet the author and learn from his ways if he'd still been alive.\n\nAccording to Julia Phillips Cohen, summarizing the work of Matthias B. Lehmann on Musar literature in Ottoman Sephardic society:\n\nBeginning in the eighteenth century, a number of Ottoman rabbis had undertaken the task of fighting the ignorance they believed was plaguing their communities by producing works of Jewish ethics (\"musar\") in Judeo-Spanish (also known as Ladino). This development was inspired in part by a particular strain within Jewish mysticism (Lurianic Kabbalah) which suggested that every Jew would necessarily play a role in the mending of the world required for redemption. The spread of ignorance among their coreligionists thus threatened to undo the proper order of things. It was with this in mind that these Ottoman rabbis--all capable of publishing in the more highly esteemed Hebrew language of their religious tradition--chose to write in their vernacular instead. While they democratized rabbinic knowledge by translating it for the masses, these \"vernacular rabbis\" (to use Matthias Lehmann's term) also attempted to instill in their audiences the sense that their texts required the mediation of individuals with religious training. Thus, they explained that common people should gather together to read their books in \"meldados\", or study sessions, always with the guidance of someone trained in the study of Jewish law.\n\nAmong the most popular works of Musar literature produced in Ottoman society was Elijah ha-Kohen's \"Shevet Musar,\" first published in Ladino in 1748. \"Pele Yoetz\" by Rabbi Eliezer Papo (1785–1826) was another exemplary work of this genre.\n\nIn Europe, significant contributions to Musar literature were made by leaders of the Haskalah. Naphtali Hirz Wessely wrote a Musar text titled \"Sefer Ha-Middot\" (Book of Virtues) in approximately 1786. Menachem Mendel Lefin of Satanov wrote a text titled \"Cheshbon Ha-Nefesh\" (Moral Accounting) in 1809, based in part on the ethical program described in the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin.\n\nOne form of literature in the Hasidic movement were tracts collecting and instructing mystical-ethical practices. These include Tzavaat HaRivash (\"Testament of Rabbi Yisroel Baal Shem\") and Tzetl Koton by Elimelech of Lizhensk, a seventeen-point program on how to be a good Jew. Rabbi Nachman of Breslov's Sefer ha-Middot is a Hasidic classic of Musar literature.\n\nThe \"Musar letter\" of the Vilna Gaon, an ethical will by an opponent of the Hasidic movement, is regarded by some as a classic of Musar literature.\n\nThe modern Musar movement, beginning in the 19th century, encouraged the organised study of medieval Musar literature to an unprecedented degree, while also producing its own Musar literature. Significant Musar writings were produced by leaders of the movement such as Israel Salanter, Simcha Zissel Ziv, Yosef Yozel Horwitz, and Eliyahu Dessler. The movement established Mussar learning as a regular part of the curriculum in the Lithuanian Yeshiva world, acting as a bulwark against contemporary forces of secularism.\n\n"}

Situated on the banks of the Ghaggar-Hakra River in the Sivalik Hills, it is the location where Guru Gobind Singh halted while travelling from Paonta Sahib to Anandpur Sahib after the Battle of Bhangani in 1688.\n\nNadu Shah Lubana family member of Baba Makhan Shah Lubana of the adjoining village served Guru Gobind Singh and his followers with food and milk.Guruji blessed Nadu Shah and said that due to his service the place would be known as Nada Sahib and his name will be remembered forever. The place remained obscure until Bhai Motha Singh, who belonged to a village nearby, discovered the sacred spot and raised a platform to perpetuate the memory of the Guru's visit. Nothing more is known of the devout Motha Singh nor of the date of the establishment of the Manji Sahib, except that the shrine was under the Dharmarth Board of Patiala and East Punjab States Union in 1948 and was taken over by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) after the merger of the state with the Punjab in 1956. Since then several new buildings have been constructed. The original Manji Sahib has been replaced by a doublestoreyed domed structure, with a large rectangular meeting hall adjacent to it. A spacious brickpaved courtyard separates these buildings from the complex comprising the Guru ka Larigar and rooms for pilgrims. The holy flag flies atop a high staff on one side of the courtyard, near the site of the old shrine. Religious gatherings and community meals take place every day. The full moon day every month is celebrated as a festive occasion attended by a large number of people.\n\nA new museum covering Sikh history is being established at Nada Sahib.\n\nAt the Battle of Bhangani, Guru Gobind Singh did not do well in the beginning but ultimately came out victorious, and won the battle. The Bichitra Natak also mentions that the battle resulted in the victory of the Guru's forces, and the enemy forces fled from the battlefield.\n\nThe Guru, though victorious, did not occupy the territory of defeated hill chiefs. Some historians such as H. Raturi, Anil Chandra Banerjee and A. S. Rawat speculate that the battle must have ended without any conclusive result, since the Guru's victory is not substantiated by any territorial annexations, and the Guru entered into an understanding with Bhim Chand soon after the battle. However, this was most likely because the Guru was not after any territorial gains, just as his great grandfather, Guru Hargobind had done when winning his battles against the Mughals.\n"}
{"id": "1753869", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1753869", "title": "Nick Joaquin", "text": "Nick Joaquin\n\nNicomedes \"Nick\" Márquez Joaquín (May 4, 1917 – April 29, 2004) was a Filipino writer, historian, and journalist best known for his short stories and novels in the English language. He also wrote using the pen name Quijano de Manila. Joaquín was conferred the rank and title of National Artist of the Philippines for Literature. He has been considered one of the most important Filipino writers, along with José Rizal and Claro M. Recto. Unlike Rizal and Recto, whose works were written in Spanish, Joaquin's major works were written in English despite being a native Spanish speaker. \n\nBefore becoming one of the leading practitioners of Philippine literature in English, he was a seminarian in Hong Kong – who later realized that he could better serve God and humanity by being a writer. This is reflected in the content and style of his works, as he emphasizes the need to restore national consciousness through important elements in Catholic Spanish Heritage. In his self-confessed mission as a writer, he is a sort of \"cultural apostle\", whose purpose is to revive interest in Philippine national life through literature – and provide the necessary drive and inspiration for a fuller comprehension of their cultural background. His awareness of the significance of the past to the present is part of a concerted effort to preserve the spiritual tradition and the orthodox faith of the Catholic past – which he perceives as the only solution to our modern ills. \n\nNicomedes “Nick” Joaquín y Márquez, fondly called “Onching” by close family and friends was born on May 4, 1917 in Pacó, Manila. There are varying accounts on the date of his birth, some cite it as September 15, 1917. This could stem from how Joaquín himself refrained from revealing his date of birth because he disliked the fuss of people coming over and celebrating his birthday.\n\nJoaquín was the fifth out of the ten children of Don Leocadio Joaquín and Salomé Márquez. Don Leocadio fought in the Philippine Revolution by the side of his friend General Emilio Aguinaldo, and reached the position of Colonel. He retired after he was wounded in action and moved on to a prolific career as a lawyer in Manila and the southern province of Laguna. Salomé Márquez was a well-educated woman who taught in a Manila public school. She was trained by Americans in English to teach at the public schools when the United States colonized the Philippines.\n\nThe Joaquín family lived in a two-story residential and commercial building, greatly uncommon at that time, on Herran Street (now Pedro Gil Street) in Pacó, Manila. Joaquín was said to have had an extremely happy childhood. The Joaquín children were tutored in Spanish & piano, and the children were encouraged to have an interest in the arts. The Joaquín home communicated in Spanish and heard mass regularly. Joaquín is a notably devout Christian and continued being so his whole life.\n\nThe Joaquíns had lived a handsome life until Don Leocadio lost the family fortune in a failed investment on an oil exploration project in the late 1920s. The family moved out of their Herran home and into a rented house in Pasay. Don Leocadio passed not long after. The young Joaquín was only twelve years old and this signalled a big change in their family.\n\nNick Joaquín attended Pacó Elementary School and went to Mapa High School for secondary education. However, in his third year informed his mother that he wanted to drop out because he felt that the classroom was too confined for him and that he learned more outside of it. His mother Salomé, a former teacher, was devastated by the news, but still allowed him to do so. \n\nAfter leaving school, Joaquín worked as an apprentice in a bakery in Pasay and later on in the publishing company TVT (Tribune-Vanguardia-Taliba.) This allowed him a small taste of an industry he would spend most of his life in.\n\nAn avid reader, Joaquín, used this time to pursue his passion for it. He was described as a having a “rabid and insane love for books” by his sister-in-law Sarah K. Joaquín. His parents had encouraged his interest in books early on. He already had a borrower’s card at the National Library when he was ten. He purveyed his father’s personal library and loved the bookstores in downtown Manila. He read voraciously and intently, he read everything that had caught his eye. He enjoyed the “poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay and Vachel Lindsay to the stories of Anton Chekhov, to the novels of Dostoyevsky, D. H. Lawrence, and Willa Cather. He read American magazines (Saturday Evening Post, Cosmopolitan, Harper’s Magazine) and discovered the fiction of Booth Tarkington, Somerset Maugham, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Ernest Hemingway.”\n\nVery early on, Joaquín was already exploring his literary voice. At age 17, he published his first poem in English about Don Quixote, in the literary section of the pre-World War II \"Tribune\", where he worked as a proofreader. It was accepted by the writer and editor Serafín Lanot. Joaquín had felt a strong connection with the story of Don Quixote, he felt like he could identify with the character. Later in life, he uses a similar iteration of Quixote in his various pen names, Quijano de Pacó and Quijano de Manila. \n\nA little later, in 1937 he published his first short story in the Sunday Tribune Magazine, “The Sorrows of Vaudeville” telling the story of the vaudevilles in Manila—a city he was endlessly enamored by. It was accepted by the writer and editor Serafín Lanot. \n\nAfter Joaquín won a nationwide essay competition to honor \"La Naval de Manila\", sponsored by the Dominican Order, the University of Santo Tomas awarded him an honorary Associate in Arts (A.A.) and a scholarship to St. Albert's Convent, the Dominican monastery in Hong Kong. There he was once again close to his family's original goal for him to enter the seminary. Joaquín and his family were devoutly Christian. He notably heard mass daily and was fond of praying the Holy Rosary. He only stayed in Hong Kong for two years before returning to Manila.\n\nJoaquín continued publishing stories and poems between 1934 and 1941 in the Herald Mid-Week Magazine and the Sunday Tribune Magazine. The Commonwealth years was a particularly vibrant era in Philippine literature. Later, the Japanese occupation closed down the Tribune and other publications. The young Joaquín had to look for ways to support his family. \n\nThroughout the occupation, Joaquín had continued writing. “The Woman Who Felt Like Lazarus” and the essay “La Naval de Manila” were borne out of this war period Joaquín had detested. His work had appeared in the Philippine Review, an English-language journal, in 1943. His story, \"It Was Later Than We Thought\" and his translation of Rizal's Mi Ultimo Adios were also published. He was beginning to spark an interest from readers. However, the reticent Joaquín shied away from recognition. He had created this mysterious and distant author. \n\nAfter returning to the Philippines, Joaquín joined the \"Philippines Free Press\", starting as a proofreader. He soon attracted notice for his poems, stories and plays, as well as his journalism under the pen name \"Quijano de Manila\". His journalism was both intellectual and provocative, an unknown genre in the Philippines at that time, and raised the country's level of reportage.\nJoaquín deeply admired José Rizal, the national hero of the Philippines, paying him tribute in such books as \"The Storyteller's New Medium – Rizal in Saga\", \"The Complete Poems and Plays of Jose Rizal\", and \"A Question of Heroes: Essays in Criticism on Ten Key Figures of Philippine History\". He translated the hero's valedictory poem, in the original Spanish \"Mi Ultimo Adios\", as \"Land That I Love, Farewell!\". \n\nJoaquín represented the Philippines at the International PEN Congress in Tokyo in 1957, and was appointed as a member of the Motion Pictures commission under presidents Diosdado Macapagal and Ferdinand E. Marcos. \n\nAfter being honored as National Artist, Joaquín used his position to work for intellectual freedom in society. He secured the release of imprisoned writer José F. Lacaba. At a ceremony on Mount Makiling attended by First Lady Imelda Marcos, Joaquín delivered an invocation to Maria Makiling a diwata and the mountain's mythical maiden. Joaquín touched on the importance of freedom and the artist. After that, Joaquín was excluded by the Marcos regime as a speaker at important cultural events. \n\nJoaquín died of cardiac arrest in the early morning of April 29, 2004, at his home in San Juan, Metro Manila. He was then editor of \"Philippine Graphic\" magazine, where he worked with Juan P. Dayang, the magazine's first publisher. Joaquín was also publisher of its sister publication, \"Mirror Weekly\", a women’s magazine, and wrote the column “Small Beer” for the \"Philippine Daily Inquirer\" and \"Isyu,\" an opinion tabloid. \n\nLiterary prominence, as measured by different English critics, is said to rest upon one of Nick Joaquín’s published books entitled “Prose and Poems” which was published in 1952. Published in this book are the poems “Three Generations”, “May Day Eve”, “After the Picnic”, “The Legend of the Dying Wanton”, “The Legend of the Virgin Jewel;”, “It Was Later than we Thought”. Among these, the first of the mentioned written works were deliberated by editors Seymour Laurence and Jose Garcia Villa as a “short story masterpiece” (1953). The poem was also chosen as the best short story published in the Philippine Press between March 1943 and November 1944.\n\nNick Joaquín, as a member of the Philippine Free Press staff, submits weekly articles which are published under his pen name Quijano de Manila. Additionally, he was chosen journalist of the year in the 11th National Press Club-Esso Journalism awards in 1996. He was nominated by Free Press Editor Teodoro Locsin who mentions that the journalistic work of Nick Joaquín has raised the journalism to the level of literature.\n\nThe literary ability of Nick Joaquín allowed him to earn multiple distinction and honors in the field of Philippine literature. On June 1, 1973, he won in the Seato Literary Award Contest for his submitted collection of short stories and poem. While on May 27, 1976, he was a recipient of one the nation’s most prestigious awards which carried material emoluments besides honors and privileges. He was conferred the title of “National Artist for Literature” by the former president and Mrs. Marcos during the special rites at the Cultural Center of the Philippines in 1976, on the condition that the Regime release Pete Lacaba, the author of the poem \"Prometheus Unbound\" from detention.\n\nIn a critical study of his prose and poems, the subjects depicted his nostalgia for the past, church rituals, legends, the mysterious, the different shades of evil, the power of the basic emotions over culture, the freedom of the will against fate, the mutability of the human body compared to the spirit, and the like. They are often set in old Manila, the walled city of Intramuros, and sometimes Paco – as a symbol of congruence, the glory and culture of the past, rather than a geographical concept. His characters are mostly cultured intellectuals of past generations, while the opposing characters are usually from the materialistic modern age. Unless they are portrayed to adjust better than old men, women seldom have significant roles in this cultured world of the past. \n\nCritics of Nick Joaquín’s works mention the presence of theological dimensions in his writings. These critics, such as Lumbera, referred to Nick Joaquín as the most stimulating lay theologian, 1968. Such examples of works containing theological dimensions include “\"Doña Jeronima”, “The Legend of the Dying Wanton” and “The Mass of St. Sylvestre” whose themes are said to be drawn from Spanish traditions. Stories from Tropical Goth, although not as obvious according to critics, possessed a Christian background but there were arguments made that what is Christian is not necessarily theological. Different analysis of Nick Joaquín’s works on these stories found in Tropical Goth reveal the use of primordial and pagan symbols. There is a fixation towards brute and the cult. Critics mention that while there are theological levels present in these stories, these were more at the folk level than dogmatic and were more reflective rather than perspective. These were then referred to as reflections of the theology of culture.\n\nDifferent Analysis of Nick Joaquín’s work, mainly “The Woman Who Had Two Navels” and stories from “Tropical Gothic”, have led critics to mention the theme of individual free will as seen in the emphasis of choice and free will in the mentioned stories. This is found, in what critics refer to, as Joaquín’s level of morality which they mention as what makes his stories expressively theological.\n\nA theological theme revealed in the Early Joaquín works is the emphasis on history and time. These are evident, according to critics, in works such as “May Day Eve”. “Guardia de Honor”, and “The Order of Melchizedek” and while not as obvious, were present as thematic backgrounds in “Doña Jeronima”, “The Legend of the Dying Wanton”, “The Summer Solstice”, and “The Mass of St. Sylvestre”. This theme comes in the form of fixation with time and patterns of recurrence as described by critics as nostalgia, which is said to show emphasis on the past. Critics make a connection of this theological reality used by Nick Joaquín to reflect Philippine culture and the intermingling of Christian and pagan values.\n\nAccording to critics, Nick Joaquín is said to be a writer who sees the essence of being Filipino in the return to the Filipino's Hispanic past. National identity is a very important topic for Nick Joaquín as evident in his works such as La Naval de Manila, After the Picnic and Summer Solstice. Noticeably in his works namely After the Picnic and Summer Solstice, the recurring theme of the rejection of the colonial self can be seen in the conflicts of the protagonist such as Chedeng, from After the Picnic, to reject Father Chavez's white-ego-ideals. In Chedeng's attempt to assert one's identity through rejection of the colonial self-imposed by society, she is confronted into choosing whether she would obliged with the white-ego ideal which asserts her security or rejection of the white-ego-ideal. Nick Joaquín also, every now and then, motleys this theme with other themes such as gender conflict, which can be evident in After the Picnic and Summer Solstice. A good example of Nick Joaquín's blending of themes is Summer Solstice, wherein he conflates gender conflict with colonial conflict, noticeable in the assertion of Doña Lupeng in the reclamation of the power of patriarchy by womanhood.\n\nTropical Gothic was reviewed in Philippine studies by H.B. Furay, Lourdes Busuego Pabo, and Emmanuel Lacaba. Critics describe this as the end of what they refer to as the Early Joaquín. \n\nAttempting to characterize stories of Tropic Goth as what critics referred to as a product of the Early Nick Joaquín would be deceptive for it was written, along with majority of his works, during the thirties. Critics referred to the publication years of 1946 -1966 as most significant in terms of the works produced. They also referred to these years as the time wherein Nick Joaquín was recognized as a first rank writer in the Philippines. Works included in these years include “Prose and Poems” (1952), three stories in the “Free Press” (1965 - 1966) and The portrait of the Artist as a Filipino. Included in the first edition of Nick Joaquín’s “Prose and Poems” were the titles “The Woman Who had Two Navels” (1961) and “La Naval de Manila” (1964).\n\nEmmanuel Lacaba, member of Philippine Studies, argues that the three Free Press Stories known as “Candido’s Apocalypse”, “\"Doña Jeronima”, and “The Order of Melchizedek”, were considered works under the older Nick Joaquín given the gap between these works and the earlier stories of “Prose and Poems”. Despite the gap, Lacaba argues that there is a recurring theme present in the later works of Nick Joaquín. In Emmanuel Lacaba’s criticism, he mentions the radical change in language, mainly through the dialogue used. Early Nick Joaquín, as Lacaba described through the example of Tropical Goth, made use of “lush” language as well as “baroque” once the readers get past the words used. Similar cases for “Candido’s Apocalypse” and “The Order of Melchizedek” which show more similarities than differences in the way of sentence patterns used.\n\nCritics, such as Furay, define Early Nick Joaquín through his nine stories of Tropic Gothic which emphasizes his talents in Philippine writing in English. Additionally, through the mention of works such as “Prose and Poems” (1952) and the three additional “Free Press stories” (1972), critics argue that the greatness of his writing lies in his themes used as well as deep intellectual analysis of Philippine culture embedded in his writing style.\n\nThe Late Nick Joaquín is defined by critics as the time 10 years after his absence from the field of fiction. These years, as defined by Lacaba, were about Joaquín devoting himself entirely to Free Press and journalistic writing. This was defined by Joaquín the essayist. He wrote under the pseudonym of Quijano de Manila. The beginning of Late Joaquín was seen after he had published two significant essays and three plays after 1975. Publications of Late Joaquín still deal with similar themes of history, paganism and Christianity and morality. His published article, The Manila Review on “Culture of History” represent his philosophy of the past which underlies many of his early works. Critics emphasizes that in the later works, there is a sharper emphasis on freedom and choice as seen in his publication on December 1975 titled “Fathers and Sons: A Melodrama in Three Reels” which was a dramatization of his earlier story “Three Generations”.\n\n\nNick Joaquín’s name as a literary artist is considered, by different university professors, as a key figure in Philippine literature in English due to the imparted truths of his writing. In his different works, Nick Joaquín has presented objective realities about different events and people capturing both their good and bad qualities. In his essays, Nick Joaquín is said to employ real life situations through symbolic qualities reflecting certain social and cultural values. This is done through the subject selection and form of writing chosen which are considered by many different fellow artists as unique. In terms of the development of the English language, Nick Joaquín was able to contribute to this by adding Filipino feelings, values, and nuances. Literary writers have mentioned how he was able to preserve the culture of the Filipinos through the use of a different tongue. The English language used by Nick Joaquín became a medium to express his literary artistry and Filipino Patriotism. Nick Joaquín was able to publish a large body of literary works during his time and through this, he has had great contribution to the Philippine literature in English.\n\nNick Joaquín’s foray into literary journalism involved bringing together his two careers. Joaquín argued that Philippine letters during the 1950s and 1960s were polarized into extremes: literature and journalism. Joaquín, under the name of Quijano de Manila during that time, belonged to both worlds as found in his works. According to different studies on literary journalism, works of Nick Joaquín serve as examples of social sciences applied to the arts. This was further seen in his work “Philippine letters’ Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde which, according to scholars, showed de Manila’s career which oscillates between fiction and non-fiction. It was during 1960 wherein Nick Joaquín entered journalism from being a fiction writer. It was under the name of de Manila wherein he began to publish reportage in a literary journalistic style. This was then referred to as, he claimed, as “New Journalism” in the United States according to the Philippine Daily Inquirer. Different literary scholars claim that the works of Nick Joaquín as de Manila exemplifies what he quotes as “good reportage with grace of style”. One of de Manila’s publication, “The House on Zapote Street”, was termed journalism by the author but is read much like his fictional works under the name Nick Joaquín.\n\n\n"}

It indicates a demonic figure thought to be active at the noon hour which inclines its victims (usually monastics) to restlessness, excitability and inattention to one's duties. <br>\nIt comes from biblical sources: the Hebrew Bible reads \"mi-ketev yashud tsohorayim\": \"from destruction that despoils at midday.\" This phrase was translated into Alexandrian Greek in the Septuagint into. \"apo pragmatos diaporeuomenou en skotei apo symptwmatos kai daimoniou mesembrinou\" (\"[you need not fear] the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor the destruction that wastes at noonday.\"). In the Vulgate, Jerome's translation of the Septuagint into Latin, we can find a personification in the daemonium meridianum (\"Non timebis . . . ab incursu et daemonio meridiano\"). This demonic personification is kept in the Catholic Douay-Rheims translation of the Old Testament of 1609 (Psalms 90:6). An exception is King James Version of 1611, where the translation follows the original Hebrew: “the destruction that wasteth at noonday”. <br>\nIn the writings of Evagrius Ponticus, a Christian monk and ascetic, the Noonday Demon is specifically responsible for acedia which he describes as \"daemon qui etiam meridianus vocatur\", attacking the cenobites most frequently between the hours of ten and two. It caused a sentiment characterized by exhaustion, listlessness, sadness, or dejection, restlessness, aversion to the cell and ascetic life, and yearning for family and former life. <br>\n\n\n1.

This tree is identified with the Mandāra tree.\n\nFrom the Bhagavata Purana, the Vishnu Purana and the Mahabharata it is learnt that the elaborate process of \"Samudra manthan\" of primal waters of the cosmic ocean yielded the \"Pārijāta tree\" as one of the three valuables, this tree, said to have blossomed atop Mount Meru in the garden of paradise and identified with the Indian coral tree, was claimed by Indra no sooner it rose to the surface and emitted its fragrance.\n\nKrishna is believed to have stolen the \"Pārijāta flower\" from Indra’s paradise to which act \"pārijāta-harana\" (removal of the \"Pārijāta tree\" from heaven), which has two forms in the Harivamsa, relates; according to the \"puranas\", at the behest of his wife, Satyabhama, Krishna had uprooted the \"pārijāta tree\" from the \"Nandana-vana\" of Indra and brought it to Dwarka though it has no role in rituals and is not associated with the world of humans, being merely a possession of sorts.\n\nIn Hindu astrology, the word, \"Pārijāta\", refers to a Rāja yoga based on the Planetary Dispositor Principle. This planetary combination called Pārijāta yoga arises if the lord of the sign occupied by the lord of the Lagna (Ascendant) and the lord of the sign occupied by the dispositor of the lord of the lagna both, or if the lords of the navāmsas occupied by these two lords are situated in a \"kendra\" or a \"trikona\" from the \"lagna-kendra\" in their own or exaltation signs. Parasara states that the person blessed with Parijata yoga will be fond of battles, strong-willed, full of determination, fearless, adept and successful, kind-hearted, forgiving and generous, have faith in Dharma and Karmas, a proud possessor and enjoyer of wealth and comforts and the one who leads a royal life during his or her middle and last part of life. Pārijāta yoga is a combination of the Parvata yoga and the Kahala yoga. Gautama Buddha was blessed with this yoga.\n"}

{"id": "2703843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2703843", "title": "Sera Monastery", "text": "Sera Monastery\n\nSera Monastery ( \"Wild Roses Monastery\"; ) is one of the \"great three\" Gelug university monasteries of Tibet, located north of Lhasa and about north of the Jokhang. The other two are Ganden Monastery and Drepung Monastery. The origin of its name is attributed to a fact that during construction, the hill behind the monastery was covered with blooming wild roses (or \"sera\" in Tibetan).\n\nThe original Sera Monastery is responsible for some 19 hermitages, including four nunneries, which are all located in the foot hills north of Lhasa.\n\nThe Sera Monastery, as a complex of structures with the Great Assembly Hall and three colleges, was founded in 1419 by Jamchen Chojey of Sakya Yeshe of Zel Gungtang (1355–1435), a disciple of Je Tsongkhapa.\nDuring the 1959 revolt in Lhasa, Sera monastery suffered severe damage, with its colleges destroyed and hundreds of monks killed. After the Dalai Lama took asylum in India, many of the monks of Sera who survived the attack moved to Bylakuppe in Mysore, India. After initial tribulations, they established a parallel Sera Monastery with Sera Me and Sera Je colleges and a Great Assembly Hall on similar lines to the original monastery, with help from the Government of India. There are now 3000 or more monks living in Sera, India and this community has also spread its missionary activities to several countries by establishing Dharma centres, propagating knowledge of Buddhism.\n\nSera Monastery in Tibet and its counterpart in Mysore, India are noted for their debate sessions.\n\nThe original Sera Monastery is a complex of structures founded in 1419 by Jamchen Chojey Sakya Yeshe of Zel Gungtang (1355–1435), a disciple of Je Tsongkhapa. Prior to establishing this monastery, Tsongkhapa, assisted by his disciples, had set up hermitages at higher elevations above Sera Utsé Hermitage.\n\nThe Sera complex is divided into two sectors by pathways; the eastern part contains the Great Assembly Hall and the dwellings and the western part has the well-known three colleges: the Sera Je Dratsang, the Sera Me Dratsang; and the Ngakpa Dratsang, all instituted by Tsongkhapa as monastic universities that catered to monks in the age range 8-70. All the structures within this complex formed a clockwise pilgrimage circuit, starting with the colleges (in the order stated), followed by the hall, the dwelling units and finally ending at the hermitage of Tsongkhapa above the Great Assembly Hall.\n\nThe Jé and Mé colleges were established to train monks, over a 20-year programme of \"tsennyi mtshan nyid grwa tshang\" (philosophical knowledge), which concludes with a geshe degree. The Ngakpa college, which predated the other two colleges, was exclusively devoted to the practice of tantric ritual. Before 1959, the administration of each college comprised an abbot with council of ten lamas for each college.\n\nOver the years, the monastery developed into a hermitage where about 6000 monks resided. The monastery was one of the finest locations in Tibet to witness the debate sessions, which were held according to a fixed schedule.\nThe monastery belongs to the Gelug Order and was one of the largest in Lhasa. In 2008, Sera had 550 monks in residence.\n\nThe history of the monastery is strongly connected to Master Lama Tsongkhapa (1357–1419), the founder of the Gelukpa Order, the much venerated and highly learned guru in Buddhist scriptures. It was under his divine tutelage that his disciple Jetsun Kunkhen Lodroe Rinchen Senge established the Sera Jey Monastery complex in the early 15th century AD. Kunkhyen Lodroe Rinchen Senge initially served as a teacher in the Drepung Monastery before he formed the Sera Jey. The religious legend narrated for how the site was chosen was a clairvoyant vision that Tsongkhapa had in which he saw the full text of Prajnaparamita's 20 slokas on \"Shunyata\" captioned in the sky. This psychic spell gave him a full insight into the \"Tsawasehrab\" (Fundamentals of Madhyamika or Shunyata) text. Further, he also perceived the \"vision of a rain like \"AA\" characters descending from the sky\". It was only 12 years later that one of his pupils, Jamchen Choje, fulfilled the prophecy of his guru by establishing the Sera Je as a seat of learning knowledge of the complete teachings and practices of the Mahayana tradition.\n\nProvidentially, the then King Nedong Dagpa Gyaltsen supported the noble venture with required finances and also, in 1419, performed the foundation laying ceremony for construction of the monastery. Further detailing with regard to the building development including installing sacred images/idols and other objects of worship were completed according to the supreme wishes of great Lama Tsongkhapa. The monastery soon came to be known as \"the Seat of Theckchen ling (Mahayana Tradition)\". Another version for the name 'Sera' that came to be prefixed with 'Monastery' was its location that was surrounded by raspberry shrubs called 'Sewa' in Tibetan, that formed like a 'Rawa' in Tibetan, meaning \"Fence\".\n\nThe 14th Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 and sought asylum there. During the month of March of the same year the Sera Jey Monastery had been destroyed by bombardment, which resulted in death of hundreds of monks (in 1959, the count of monks living in Sera Jey was 5629), apart from destruction of ancient texts and loss of innumerable, invaluable, ancient and antique works of art. Many of those who survived (monks and common people) this onslaught by the Chinese fled to India, under severe winter weather conditions, across the Himalayas. Following this mass exodus of people from Tibet (including, a few hundred Sera Jey lamas, geshes and monks), when they arrived in India, they were resettled at Bylakuppe near Mysore, Karnataka state among many other locations spread across the country, as one of the exclusive Tibetan establishments with ready assistance forthcoming from the Government of India. It was in 1970 that the group of 197 Sera Jey monks with 103 of Sera Mey monks established a special monastery within the resettlement of Bylakuppe as a counterpart of the Tibetan Sera Jey Monastery. As none of the monks of the Ngagpa Dratsang (Tantric College) had survived the invasion, only the Sera Mey College and Sera Jey College were re-formed in India. The Bylakuppe Monastery now houses 5,000 Buddhist monks comprising some migrants and many other Tibetans who were not born in their ancestral homeland.\n\nWith forest land allotted by the Government of India, two arms of the Sera Monastery, representing the migrant monks of the Tibetan Sera Je and Sera Me colleges were established; 193 Sera je monks got and 107 monks of Sera Me got an allotment of the balance area. Further, 38 tenements were built with grants by the Government of India for the Monks to reside and pursue their vocation of monkshood coupled with tilling the surrounding allotted land for raising food crops for survival. Well established as an organised Monastery with dedicated efforts of the monks, an Assembly Prayer Hall that could accommodate 1500 monks was also completed in 1978. This Monastery is now the nodal monastery, with its affiliation to several smaller monasteries spread across various regions in Tibet; its popularity could be gauged by the 3000 or more monks living here now. Encouraged by this success and noting the pressure on existing infrastructure, an additional, much larger and an impressive Assembly hall (measuring , high with 110 pillars) has been built that can accommodate 3500 monks to assemble for prayers. With this development, Sera has now two facets, the original “Tibetan Sera” and the Bylakuppe “New Sera” of the “Tibetan Diaspora” with the counterpart Jé, Mé monasteries, with the Ngakpa college counterpart also added recently. The Sera-India monk community of the Bylakuppe Monastery, has gone global with their missionary activity by establishing “dharma centres” in many parts the world, thus removing the cultural isolation of pre-1959 years in Tibet.\n\nSera, Tibet that housed more than 5,000 monks in 1959, though badly damaged following the invasion of Tibet and the 1959 Revolution, is still functional after restoration. In 2011, according to local sources, there are about 300 monks. The reason for this decline is attributed to the 2008 Tibetan unrest.\n\nThe monastery is located on the northern outskirts of Lhasa, the capital of Tibet Autonomous Region. As built in 1419, it encompassed an area of . Its geographical location is at the base of Pubuchok mountain, also known as Tatipu Hill, located in the northern suburb of Lhasa City, which forms the watershed of the basins formed by Kyi Chi and Penpo Chu rivers.\n\nThe monastery complex, encompassing of land, housed several institutions in its precincts. The structures of notability were the Coqen Hall Tsokchen (Great Assembly Hall), the three Zhacangs (colleges) and Kamcun (dormitory) also called Homdong Kangtsang. In the main hall, scriptures (scripted with gold powder), statues, scent cloth and murals were seen in profusion. The descriptions given here relate to the scenario that existed at the monastery prior to the 1959 invasion by China but most of the monasteries are stated to be since restored, though the strength of the monks are said to be small.\n\nThe Great Assembly Hall, the ‘Tsokchen' or 'Coqen Hall', dated to 1710, a four-story structure to the north east of the monastery, facing east, is where several religious rituals and rites are conducted. The hall measured an area of built with 125 pillars (86 tall and 39 short columns) and was constructed by Lhazang Qan. The entry portico had ten columns. The five chapels in this building have statues or images of Maitreya, Shakyamuni, Arhats, Tsongkhapa, and Kwan-yin with one thousand hands and eleven faces. The ancient and delicately written scriptures ‘the Gangyur of Tripitaka’ also spelt 'Kangyur' (dated 1410) in 105 volumes (original 108 volumes) written in Tibetan is the treasured possession of the monastery. It is said that Chengzhu, Emperor of the Ming Dynasty presented these scriptures (printed on wood blocks with gold cover engraved in red lacquer and made in China), to Jamchen Chojey, the builder of the monastery.\nThe entrance to the hall was through a portico built on 10 columns. Large appliqué Thangkas were suspended from the ceiling on the side walls. A skylight at the centre provided the light in the hall during the day. Image of the founder of the monastery Jamchen Choje Shakya Yeshe was deified as the central image. Other deities installed were of Maitreya ( height and gilded) flanked by statues of two lions, Dalai Lamas V, VII and XII, Tsongkhapa (with his favourite disciples), Chokyi Gyeltsen, Desi Sangye Gyatso and many more.\n\nThe three inner chapels, sequentially, are the Jampa Lhakhang, the Neten Lhakhang and Jigje Lhakhang. A high image of Maitreya was deified in Jampa Lhakhang ensconced by Eight Bodhisattvas, the treasured Kagyur and guarded by Hayagriva and Acala at the entrance. Jigje Lhakhang houses the image of Bhairava with his consort Bhairavi, Shri Devi and other protector deities.\n\nOn the second floor, there were three chapels: the Zhelre Lhakhang from where Maitreya could be seen embossed with a small Tsongkhapa on its heart; the Tu-je Chenpo Lhakhang that had an Avalokiteshvara with eleven faces (found at Pawangka), Tara and six–armed Mahakala. The idol of Shakyamuni Buddha flanked by images of Gelukpa Lamas were placed in the Shakyamuni Lhakhang.\n\nThe third and the fourth floors were used as private apartments for the Dalai Lamas and the preceptors of the Main Assembly Hall.\n\nSera Me Tratsang or Sera Me Zhakan was the oldest college built here. It was established in 1419 during the Ming Dynasty reign, initially for elementary or basic education in Buddhist religion. The college adopted a step-by-step approach to the studies of Buddhist doctrines; a practice particular to the Gelukpa or Yellow Hat sect of Tibetan Buddhism. The college was built over an area of with 30 dewelling units. However, in 1761 lightning struck the main hall which was rebuilt in 1761. The hall, as finally refurbished, had 70 pillars (8 tall and 62 short pillars) which housed a galaxy of statues of Buddhist gurus with the main deity of Shakyamuni Buddha made in copper. The other Bodhisattvas enshrined along with the main deity were of Maitreya, Manjushri, Amatyas, Bhavishyaguru, Tsongkhapa (with his students), Dalai Lama VII, Pawanga Rinpoche and several other past teachers of the college.\n\nThe college had five chapels with plethora of statues and frescoes, which from west to east were: Tawok Lhkhang with images of Tawok, protection deity of the east, the Je Rinpoche Lhakhang with images of Tsongkhapa and Shakyamuni, the Neten Lhakhang\nwith images of Buddha of Three Times in the company of 'Sixteen Elders' depicted in their mountain caves, volumes of the sacred Prajnaparamita text; the Jowokhang with large Buddha image (replaced an earlier image of Miwang Jowo Shakyamuni) along with Eight Bodhisattvas, and gatekeepers Hayagriva and Acala; and the Tsongkhapa Lhakhang, the last chapel on the right, with several images – Je Rinpoche, Atisha, Dromtonpa, Dalai Lamas I-III, Dalai Lama V, Jamchen Shakya Yeshe, Gyeltsen Zangpo (first teacher of Sera), Kunkhen Jangchub Penpa (founder of Sera Me) and many more.\n\nThe second floor of the college had the Nyima Lhakhang where image of Shakhyamuni Buddha was deified along with Tuwang Tsultrim, and the Khangyur Lhakhang with 1000 images of Tara which replaced the sacred texts that were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. The third floor was reserved for the Dalai Lamas.\n\nSera Je Tretsang (College) or Zhekong, the largest college in Sera complex, measured an area of . It was initially a three storied building; a fourth floor was added in the 18th century by strengthening the building with a total of 100 columns. It had a statue of the Hayagriva (said to have been sculpted by Lodro Rinchen himself in gilded copper), also known popularly as Avalokiteśvara, which was considered the protective deity of the monastery. This wrathful deity was worshipped as dispeller of obstacles with healing powers. Tokden Yonten Gonpo, worshipped this deity first and on divine injunction initiated his son Kunkhepa, to follow this tradition. Kunkhepa, with the blessings of Lama Tsongkhapa, institutionalised the name of Hayagriva or Tamdin Yangsang as the supreme protector deity of the monastery. The assembly hall of the college depicted frescoes of Buddha's life achievements, the thrones of the Dalai Lamas and Panchen Lamas; seen on its north wall were stupas (reliquaries) and images of Dalai Lama VIII and Dalai Lama XIII, Reting Telkus II and IX, and Lodro Rinchen (founder of Sera). \n\nThe Chapels which were circumambulated sequentially are: the Dusum Sangye Lhakhang which housed statues of “Buddhas of Three Times” and Eight Bodhistavas; the Tamdrin Lhakhang housed the main image of Hayagriva; the Jhampa Lhakhang contained images of Maitreya, Eleven-faced Mahakarunika, and Tsongkhapa with his disciples amidst a coveted library; the Tsongkhapa Lhakhang with images of Tsongkhapa with his best students, main Lamas of Sera Je, Nagarjuna and other Buddhist commentators of India, gate keepers Havagriva and Acala; the Jampeyang Lhakhang to the north-east had two images of Manjushri, one in a Dharmacakramudra (teaching pose) looking towards the Debating Courtyard.\n\nThe second floor of the monastery on the west called the Zelre Lhakhang provided an overview of the main Hayagriva image in the floor below, and also a small image of Nine-headed Hayagriva along with images of Padmasambhava, the 5th Dalai Lama and the protector deities. One floor above this was the Namgyel Lhakhang and the last floor above this was the living quarters of the Dalai Lamas and teachers of Sera Je.\n\nThe Ngakpa Tratsang, also spelled Ngaba Zhacang, was the smallest of the three colleges that was set up in the complex. It was a three storied building originally built in 1419 by Jetsun Kunkhen Lodroe Rinchen Senge. It was refurbished in the 18th century by Lhazang Khan. Devoted to tantric studies, the college had an assembly hall and two chapels in the ground floor. The Assembly hall was built with four tall and 42 short columns with elegantly carved capitals. The main image in the centre of the hall was of Jamchen Chojey (wearing a black hat), founder of the monastery. It was believed that the Yongle Emperor (1360–1424) presented this image to Sera. Other images enshrined in the hall were of Maitreya, Gyeltsen Zangpo (first religious teacher of Sera), Pawangka Rinpoche, Tsongkhapa (with his principle disciples), Dalai Lama XIII, Chokyi Gyeltsen and Lodro Rinchen (founder of Sera Je). The two chapels housed many statues; in the Neten Lhakhang chapel of Shakyamuni Buddha along with images of 16 elders in double series (Upper series made in Tibetan style and the lower series in Chinese lacquer given by the Chinese Emperor); and the Jigje Lakhang chapel housed the 15th century image of Bhairava along with those of Mahakala, Dharmaraja, Shridevi and many others. While the third story was the residence of the Dalai Lama, the second floor had the images Amitayus and also eight 'Medicine Buddhas', as also reliquaries (stupas) of Gyeltsen Zangpo and Jetsun Chokyi Gyeltsen. However, as per reports, this college was destroyed and all resident monks also died in the bombardment done by the Chinese in 1959.\n\nHomdong Khangtsang, also spelt ‘Kamcuns’ in Tibetan language, are the main dwelling units or dormitories which house the monks of the monastery; there are thirty-three Kamcuns surrounding the central courtyard. The size of the Kamcuns varied, depending on the strength of monks housed. Monks of the same village are housed together; however each monk is given a separate cell. Each Kamcun also has a prayer hall for exclusive study of Buddhist doctrine and also has annexed tea house. However, the main assembly hall here had minor images of Tsongkhapa, Choyi Gyeltsen, Shakhyamuni Buddha, Three Deities of Longevity, and two inner chapels – the Jampakhang with ‘speaking’ image of Tara (protector of the springs in Sera) and Lama Tubten Kunga (who renovated Sera Me) and Gonkhang chapel with the image of the protector deity Gyelchen Karma Trinle.\n\nChoding Khang is the hermitage located just behind the Great Assembly Hall (on the hill slope of Sera Utse). This is where Je Tsongkhapa meditated. The hermitage is accessed through a track where painted rock carvings of Tsongkhapa, Jamchen and Dharma Raja (the protector) are seen flanking the stepped approaches, along the route. A new building has been constructed in place of the old hermitage, which was destroyed during the Revolution. Below the hermitage are the Upper Tantric College (Gyuto) and Lower Tantric College (Gyu-me) of Lhasa). A further climb up the hill leads to caves where Tsongkhapa meditated.\nSera Monastery that developed over the centuries into a renowned place of learning, which trained hundreds of scholars who attained name and fame in the Buddhist nations, has under its affiliation 19 hermitages, including four nunneries, which are all located in the foot hills above Lhasa. The nunneries established are the Chupzang Nunnery, the Garu Nunnery, the Negodong Nunnery and the Nenang Nunnery and a few nuns of some of these nunneries held protest marches against the Chinese rule, and as a result suffered incarnation and indignities. Brief details of the hermitages and nunneries are:\n\nPabonka Hermitage (\"pha bong kha ri khrod\"), the largest and most important of the Sera hermitages is located about northwest of Lhasa in the Nyang bran Valley on the slopes of Mount Parasol.\n\nThe site, which is over 1,300 years old, dates back to Songtsän Gampo, the founder of the Tibetan Empire, and was amongst the first buildings built in the Lhasa area by him during the 7th century after settlement. Although originally the site of his castle or fort, the \"Tibetan Annals\" have revealed that Pabonka was converted into a monastery, possibly under the reign of the second great Buddhist king of Tibet Trisong Detsen. Detsen, along with Guru Rinpoche and the first seven monks of the new Tibetan Empire used to meditate at the hermitage and it became one of Tibet's very earliest Buddhist monasteries, possibly even pre-dating Jokhang.\nThe original nine-storied monastery was partially destroyed by King Langdharma in 841 AD during his campaign to destroy monastic Buddhism; it was rebuilt in the 11th century as a two-storied structure that housed 200 monks.\n\nJe Tsongkhapa (1357–1419) lived at the site as a hermit, and it eventually became a scholarly institution. The Fifth Dalai Lama was known to be fond of the monastery and funded the building of an upper floor for Pabonka.\n\nBefore 1959, Pabonka was independent of Sera Monastery, and from 1960 to the mid-1980s it was controlled by the Chinese. It then came under the control of Sera, whose monks renovated it and are continuing its traditions.\n\nThis temple is noted for its many shrines, and its blue and carved gold mantra in the hallway, inscribed with words meaning, \"Hail to the jewel in the lotus\". A number of stone relics were buried during the Cultural Revolution but when Sera monks restored the hermitage they excavated the relics and restored most of them. A central shrine, dating back 1300 years to Gampo, is located in the temple and depicts Chenresig, Jampelyang and Chana Dorje, the so-called \"Rigsum Gompo Trinity\" from which the temple takes its name. Up the hill from the hermitage, past a group of chortens, is Palden Lhamo Cave, a cave known to have been a meditation chamber of Songstan Gampo himself and contains statues of himself, his two wives and a rock carving of Palden Lhamo, the protectress.\n\nThe hermitage notably has its own tradition of monthly and yearly ritual cycles. The most important of these yearly ritual events (at least for the laity) are the six-day (three sets of two-day) Avalokiteśvara fasting rituals that take place during the Tibetan New Year (Losar) celebrations, the sixteen-day (eight sets of two-day) Avalokiteśvara fasting rituals that take place during the fourth Tibetan month (they attract many people from Lhasa and the surrounding districts), and a ritual and other events that take place during the “Sixth-Month Fourth-Day” pilgrimage.\nDrakri Hermitage (\"brag ri ri khrod\"), also known as Bari Hermitage (\"sba ri ri khrod\") lies about three kilometres north and slightly east of central Lhasa. Drakri, believed to have been founded by the abbot of Pha bong kh in the 18th century, was used as a meditational retreat by Klong rdol bla ma ngag dbang blo bzang (1719–1794), one of the most renowned scholars of the Lhopa Regional House (Lho pa khang tshan) of the Jé College (Grwa tshang byes). Drakri Hermitage had control over Garu Nunnery since its early history and supervised the training of the Garu nuns until 1959. In 1959, the monks of the hermitage were evicted and the hermitage was turned into the notorious Drapchi Prison, which gained a reputation for being one of the most severe penal institutions run by the Chinese in Tibet.\n\nIn the 1980s a citizen of Lhasa re-established the monastery under the Nyingma sect to remember his late mother. After receiving permission from the Lhasa municipal government, he began renovating the site, although a former official of the Bari Lama's estate who had previously controlled the monastery initially objected to it being converted into Nyingma practice centre. Today the hermitage, still partly ruined, consists of five major sections; a main temple compound around a central courtyard with a temple, kitchen, and some of the monks’ living quarters, an extensive ruined terraced complex just south of the main temple which before 1959 served as the meeting rooms and the living quarters of the workers and business managers of the Drakri Lama's estate, a building that had served as the living quarters for the eight fully ordained monks who formed the ritual core of the monastic community, a stable for mdzo, a yak-cow hybrid and several huts. The main temple contains statues of Guru Rinpoche and several tantric deities and a three-dimensional model of Guru Rinpoche's celestial palace, the Glorious Copper-Coloured Mountain (\"Zangs mdog dpal ri\"). Today there are four tantric priests residing in the main temple compound and two nuns living in huts to the southeast.\n\nThe ruins of Jokpo Hermitage (\"’jog po ri khrod\") is located in the far western end of the Nyang bran Valley. The former property of the Jokpo Lama’s estate before the Chinese invasion in 1959, it originally served as the meditation retreat of a monk named ’Jog po rin po che of the Sera Mé College. The monk was a great meditator and according to tradition, after he died, his body remained in a state of perpetual meditative equipoise and was kept inside the Zhungpa Regional House temple where the monks reported that his hair and nails continued to grow even after his death. Before the Chinese invasion his body was buried and decayed and when the regional house (khang tshan) was rebuilt in the 1980s, his bones were exhumed. These are today placed inside the altar's clay statue in the regional house temple.\n\nKeutsang Hermitage (\"Ke’u tshang ri khrod\") was a precariously perched cave hermitage inhabited by the great Tibetan guru Tsongkhapa. However, the original cave collapsed in a landslide. What is present now was rebuilt, adjoining the ruined Keutsang West Hermitage, at a safer location. As it exists now, Keutsang is located to the east of Sera on a hill side above Lhasa’s principal cemetery. Rakhadrak Hermitage is located below this hermitage, within a close distance. This hermitage is also part of the Sera Mountain Circumambulation Circuit (se ra’i ri ’khor) that pilgrims undertake during the ‘Sixth-Month Fourth-Day (drug pa tshe bzhi)’ celebrations. The hermitage had smooth relationship with Sera all through its history so much so that every official monk of the hermitage enjoyed de facto status of a monk of the Hamdong Regional House (\"Har gdong khang tshan\") of the Jé College also. The monastery also observes all ritualistic practices.\n\nSome special aspects of the temple complex are: the belief that Maitreya (Byams pa) assures rebirth to those whose remains are brought to the cemetery below Keu tshang and it is also believed that light rays are exchanged between the Maitreya image here and the Maitreya Chapel at the northern end of the Barskor in Lhasa.\n\nDuring the 1959 Cultural Revolution, the present and the fifth Keutsang incarnation (\"Keutshang sku phreng lnga pa\") was incarcerated for a time and later he sought asylum in India in the 1980s.\n\nThe hermitage was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution. Rebuilding it was started by a former monk of the hermitage in 1991 and was completed by 1992. The rebuilt hermitage now houses 25 monks.\n\nKeutsang East Hermitage (\"ke’u tshang shar ri khrod\"), a small hermitage exists now only in ruins between Keutsang West (\"Ke’u tshang nub\"), (now part of Kuetsang Hermitage) and the Purchok Hermitage. Its location is to the north of Lhasa. Prior to 1959, the hermitage belonged to Purchok Hermitage. It consisted of an assembly hall and monks’ quarters and was famous for the divine image of Avalokiteśvara who blessed the dead at the funeral ground here. There were ten resident monks. However, at present there no plans to rebuild the hermitage due to lack of funds.\n\nKeutsang West Hermitage is also in ruins and at present the Keutsang Hermitage has been built next to these ruins.\n\nKhardo Hermitage (\"Mkhar rdo ri khrod\") is a historical hermitage in the Dodé Valley, to the northeast of Lhasa and Sera monastery, which is named after the local deity (\"gnas bdag\"), known as \"Mkhar rdo srong btsan\". Its setting is in a charnel ground ideal to perform tantric rites. The hermitage known as the \"abode of saints\" is surrounded by mountains on three sides which are all assigned divine names such as the ‘Soul Mountain of the Buddhas of the Five Families (\"Rgyal ba’i rigs lnga bla ri\")' for a group of hills behind the monastery, 'Soul Mountain of Cakrasamvara (\"Bde mchog bla ri)\" where hand implements and bone ornaments of the deity were found, and the ‘Birth Deity Peak (\"Khrungs ba’i lha ri or ’Khrungs’ fro\")' for the hill to the left of the hermitage. A cave here is known by the name the 'Offering Place Cave (\"Brag mchod sa\")', (a copy of the holy Scriptures (\"Bka’gyur\") is said to have been found here). Several local legends are narrated in respect of the history of founding the hermitage by Bzod pa rgya mtsho who lived in a cave here under the direction of the local deity. It was established in 1706.\nThe hermitage, now in ruins, was originally built in three tiers (one above the other): the lowest tier was the hermitage or the main compound, the middle tier was known as the Upper Residence (\"Gzims khang gong ma\") and top tier was the Temple of the Sixteen Arhats (\"Gnas bcu lha khang\"). The Seventh Dalai Lama, who was a student, fully supported Bzod pa rgya mtsho to build the first temple (Temple of the Sixteen Arhats) and also a residence for himself to stay during his visits to the hermitage, which came to be known as the 'Upper Residence'. The Dalai Lama's reverence for his guru was so deep that when the Bzod pa rgya mtsho died, he even performed the last rites for him, got installed his funerary stūpa and statue. He also located the Incarnate Lama of his guru at 'Phan po' near Lhasa. The second Bzod pa rgya mtsho also had excellent equation with the Eighth Dalai Lama, Jampel Gyatso (\"Da lai bla ma sku phreng brgyad pa ’jam dpal rgya mt\"sho). This power equation resulted in two more monasteries being built as satellite monasteries.\n\nPanglung Hermitage (\"spangs lung ri khrod\") is located in the valley, northeast and downhill from Phur lcog. Panglung lies completely in ruins although it once had a large temple and a Rdo rje shugs ldan oracle; an individual who would go into trance to make prognostications while possessed by the god. Panglung was attempted to be renovated in the 1990s, but met opposition from the local people because the site had always been associated with this controversial protector deity, so redevelopment was prevented.\n\nPurbuchok Hermitage (\"Phur bu lcog ri khrod\") is situated in the Lhasa suburb of \"Dog bde\" in the northern mountains at the north-east corner of the Lhasa Valley. It is the last hermitage to be visited on the “Sixth-Month Fourth-Day” (\"drug pa tshe bzhi\") pilgrimage circuit. Fairly fully rehabilitated, it is considered an attractive hermitage. The hills surrounding the monastery have been given name tags of the three protectors of the divine paradise namely the Avalokiteśvara, Mañjuśrī and Vajrapāni. It is also identified with the six syllables divine mantra (\"sngags\")- \"OM Mani Padme Hum\".\n\nHistory of the hermitage is traced to the 9th century when Padmasambhava (\"Padma ’byung gnas\") meditated here. The main cave where he did penance is known as the ‘Cavern of Dochung Chongzhi (\"Rdo cung cong zhi’i phug pa\")’. Over the centuries, the monastery has seen many leading lights of the Tibetan monastic order playing a role in its building, such as the Zhang ’gro ba’i mgon po g.yu brag pa (1123–1193), female saint Ma cig lab sgron, Sgrub khang dge legs rgya mtsho's (1641–1713), Ngawang Jampa (Phur lcog sku phreng dang po ngag dbang byams pa, 1682–1762) and Pan chen blo bzang ye shes (1663–1737). Royal family members like the Queen Tsering Trashi (\"Rgyal mo tshe ring bkra shis\") and the Tibetan King Pho lha nas (1689–1747) also supported the activities of the hermitage. However, the most significant face of development occurred during the third Purchok incarnation Lozang Tsültrim Jampa Gyatso (Phur lcog sku phreng gsum pa blo bzang tshul khrims byams pa rgya mtsho) who was teacher of the 13th and 14th Dalai Lamas.\n\nHowever, the Cultural Revolution of 1959 saw almost total destruction of the hermitage. Since 1984, with approval of the local government, a reconstruction face was begun and the hermitage has been substantially restored now to its past glory.\n\nRakhadrak Hermitage (\"Ra kha brag ri khrod\") is a historical hermitage, belonging to the Sera Monastery. It is located to the northeast of Sera and to the north of Lhasa. Mother of the Fifth Dalai Lama (Da lai bla ma sku phreng lnga pa) was the hermitage's benefactor. Under her patronage, the upper temple complex was built as a formal monastery. The hermitage was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution of 1959. In the 1980s, Sera took control of the hermitage complex. However, rebuilding activity has been sporadic and monastic rituals are not held.\n\nSera Chöding Hermitage (\"Se ra chos sdings ri khrod\") was a tantric college (\"rgyud smad grwa tshang\") before the 1959 Cultural Revolution. Located close to Sera and facing south, it has a yellow retreat house which was built first for the Tsongkhapa. The interesting story of this house is that a local 'site-spirit' (\"gzhi bdag\") used to visit Tsongkhapa through a narrow window in the house. Tsong kha pa's mural image is seen here on the wall, which is credited with special powers as an “image that speaks” or known as speaking-statue (\"gsung byon ma\"). It was Tsongkhapa's favourite hermitage where he spent substantial time and composed his magnamopus, the “Great Commentary on the Prajñāmūla (\"Rtsa shes Dīk chen\"). He also taught here. It is also known as the hermitage where Tsongkhapa assigned his Tantric teachings to Rje shes rab seng ge (1383–1445), the founder of the Tantric Colleges.\n\nSera Gönpasar Hermitage (\"se ra dgon pa gsar ri khrod\") is derived from the Tibetan name dgon pa gsar, meaning “new monastery.” Today it lies completely in ruins but the hermitage belonged to the bla mas of the Dgon pa gsar\nincarnation lineage and was established as a Dge lugs hermitage by the first Gönpasar incarnation, Ngawang Döndrup. The hermitage was run by thirteen fully ordained monks before its destruction in 1959. Some foundations and fragments of walls remain, including some notable rock carvings and a large stupa.\n\nSera Utsé Hermitage (\"se ra dbu rtse ri khrod\"), meaning “Sera Peak” is located on the mountain directly behind Sera Monastery itself, which is about north of the Jokhang, about a 1½-hour walk up the hill from the main complex of Sera. It is reputedly older than Sera Gompa. According to tradition, the site contained one of Tsongkhapa’s (1357–1419) meditation huts and Sgrub khang dge legs rgya mtsho (1641–1713) was reputed to have meditated here at end of the seventeenth or early eighteenth century. He was a distinguished meditator, who brought his knowledge of the philosophical tradition to Sera Utsé and attracted many students, amongst them included Phur lcog ngag dbang byams pa (1682–1762), and Mkhar rdo bzod pa rgya mtsho (1672–1749).\n\nHistorically the monastery was of substantial size but following its destruction by the Chinese in 1959 it was drastically reduced and only a section rebuilt. Sera Utsé has a two-storied chapel and monks' quarters with magnificent views over the city of Lhasa. There is a protector shrine to Pehar and Shridevi. A small assembly hall remains, which was once believed to contain a large metal statue of Vajrabhairava (\"Rdo rje ’jigs byed\"), a great statue of Yamāntaka Ekavīra, statues of the Buddha and the Sixteen Arhats, a speaking Tārā (Sgrol ma) statue, large images of Tsongkhapa and his two disciples, and statues of the \"bla mas\" of the Drupkhang incarnation (\"Sgrub khang sprul sku\") lineage. Today the hall is inhabited by three monks but is not in use for central worship.\n\nThe bla ma’s residence which was inhabited by Sgrub khang bla also still exists and consists of two rooms with a central waiting room between them. There is also Sgrub khang pa's meditation hut, a small protector deity chapel, a Dharma enclosure (chos rwa), a ruined kitchen and various smaller huts, which are used mostly for storage today.\n\nTakten Hermitage (\"Rtags bstan ri khrod\") is situated to the east of Trashi Chöling Hermitage and to the north-east of Sera. According to a legend, \"Dge lugs pa bla ma\", \"Pha bong kha bde chen snying po\" (1878–1941) on a visit to this area to find a site for locating his hermitage saw a crow which spoke to him. He interpreted it as a “revealed sign” to build his hermitage here. The hermitage mostly consists of caves with fascia at the entrance to the caves. It belongs to the Pabongkha Lama's estate (\"Pha bong kha bla brang\"). Yes i agree However, Dge lugs pa nuns, who have carried out restoration works at the hermitage now live here.\n\nTrashi Chöling Hermitage (\"Bkra shis chos gling ri khrod\"), which means “The Place of Auspicious Dharma” is located from Sera on the hills to the north-west of Sera. The hermitage, which is south facing, is part of the pilgrimage of the \"Sera Mountain Circumambulation Circuit (se ra ri ’khor)\". The hermitage that was substantially destroyed during the Cultural Revolution was rebuilt during the 1990s. The hermitage is now a part of the Pabongkha Lama's estate, the present incarnation, (after his recent return to Tibet) and is stated to be functioning as an autonomous institution with minimum allegiance to Sera.\n\nThe hermitage is believed to have been founded by Phrin las rgya mtsho (d. 1667), who was the regent of Tibet from 1665 to his death. He was a student of the Fifth Dalai Lama and requested his permission to build a hermitage for eight to sixteen monks in the foothills above his native Nyangbran and invited the Fifth Dalai Lama to perform a “site investigation” (\"sa brtag\") to determine the most auspicious location on which to build the monastery. The Dalai Lama made the treasure (\"gter\") discovery of the self-arisen stone image of the Buddha that is still located in Chupzang's lower temple. However, the initial hermitage fell into ruin and the official founding of the monastery is credited to Phrin las rgya mtsho's nephew, Sde srid sangs rgyas rgya mtsho, in around 1696.\n\nThe hermitage belonged to Chubzang ye shes rgya mtsho for sometime who built a four-pillar temple with rear chapel and porticos at the site. It was later under the possession of Byang chub chos ’phel (1756–1838) and Khri byang sku phreng gsum pa blo bzang yeshes, who was a junior tutor to the living 14th Dalai Lama.\n\nIn 1921, Pha bong kha bde chen snying po (1878–1941) stayed at Chubzang and published his teachings through his most famous work, \"Liberation in Our Hands\" (Rnam grol lagbcangs).\n\nIn the 1950s, the site began to be used as a religious retirement community by elderly Lhasans, who constructed small huts in which they could live out the final years of their lives in intensive Buddhist practice. Nuns began to renovate the site in the 1980s and founded the modern nunnery, as it is seen today, in 1984, and has since grown into one of the largest nunneries in the Lhasa Valley. However, somewhat unusually, the houses are owned individually by the nuns, but the nunnery has an administrative body and a site for communal gathering.\n\nGari Nunnery is located north of Lhasa. The nunnery has an ancient history traced to the 11th century when \"Pha dam pa sangs rgyas\"), the Buddhist preceptor, visited this location. He not only named the place as \"Garu\" but also ordained that it shall be a \"Nunnery\" not a monastery of monks, on the basis of prophetic events that occurred during his visit to the place. The Nunnery's fame in recent years is the leading and bold role that some of the nuns have played in organizing silent demonstrations against the Chinese rule, and seeking freedom of Tibet. Many of the protesting nuns were arrested, incarcerated, brutally handled and released only after protracted detention.\n\nNegodong Nunnery, a historical hermitage, is located in the Lhasa suburb of \"Dog bde\", northeast of Sera (and also of Lhasa). It is believed that it was originally a retreat of the Buddhist scholar of the Sera Jé College's (Grwa tshang byes) Gomdé Regional House (\"Sgom sde khang tshan\"), \"Nam mkha’ rgyal mtshan\". It was initially founded as a monastery with seventeen monks but later allotted in 1930 for exclusive use as a nunnery to provide personal security to the nuns who were then residing in a remote nunnery at \"Gnas nang\" (in a remote higher valley to the east) away from the present location at Nedong Nunnery \"Gnas sgo gdong\" (about a one-hour walk). The monks were shifted to \"Gnas nang\"(the original home of the nuns).\n\nNenang Nunnery (\"Gnas nang dgon pa\") is located to the east of Negodong Nunnery (\"Gnas sgo gdong dgon pa\") in Lhasa prefecture. It is associated with Padmasambhava who is stated to have meditated in two nearby caves in the 9th century. Founding the hermitage as a nunnery is credited to a nun (interpreted as a Dakini) by name Jetsün (or Khachö) Dröldor Wangmo (\"Rje btsun nam mkha’ spyod sgrol rdor dbang mo\"). It functioned well as nunnery during her time and also during the next generation but went into decline thereafter. It was then brought under the jurisdiction of the Khardo Hermitage.\n\nDebates among monks on the Buddhist doctrines are integral to the learning process in the colleges in the Sera Monastery complex. This facilitates better comprehension of the Buddhist philosophy to attain higher levels of study. This exemplary debating tradition supplemented with gestures is said to be exclusive to this monastery, among the several other monasteries of Lhasa. Visitors also attend to witness these debates that are held as per a set schedule, every day in the 'Debating Courtyard' of the monastery.\n\nThe debate among monks unfolds in the presence of their teachers, with a very well set rules of procedure for the defender and the questioners. The tradition of such debates is traced to the ancient ‘Hindu Orthodoxy’ in India and this practice permeated into Buddhist orthodoxy in Tibet in the eighth century. Such debates usually take place within the monastery's precincts. The defender has the onus to prove his point of view on the subject proposed for debate. The debate opens with an invocation to Manjushri recited in a loud and high pitched tone. The roles of the debater and the questioner are well defined; the questioner has to succinctly present his case (all on Buddhism related topics) and the defender has to answer within a fixed time frame. The finality of the debate is with specific answers like: “I accept (do), the reason is not established (ta madrup) or there is no pervasion (Kyappa majung)”. Many a time, the questions mooted are meant to mislead the defender. If the defender does not reply within a time frame, an expression of derision is witnessed. In the Tibetan debating sessions, there is no role for a witness and there is normally no adjudicator. This leads to “conflicting opinions of participants and listeners.” When there is direct contradiction on the defenders part, the outcome is, however, formally decided.\n\nDebates are punctuated with vigorous gestures which enliven the ambience of the occasion. Each gesture has a meaning. The debater presents his case with subtlety, robed in a formal monk's attire. Some of the gestures (said to have symbolic value), made during the debates, generally subtle dramatic gestures are: clapping after each question; holding right hand and stretching left hand forward and striking the left palm with the right palm; clapping hands loudly to stress the power and decisiveness of the defender's arguments denoting his self-assurance; in case of wrong answer presented by the defender, the opponent gestures three circles with his hand around the defenders head followed by loud screaming to unnerve the defender; opponent's mistake is demonstrated by wrapping his upper robe around his waist; loud clapping and intense verbal exchange is common; and the approach is to trap the defender into a wrong line of argument. Each time a new question is asked, the teacher strikes his outstretched left palm with his right palm. When a question is answered correctly, it is acknowledged by the teacher bringing the back of his right hand to his left palm. When the defender wins the debate he makes an allegorical dig at the questioner by questioning his basic wisdom as a Buddhist.\n\nThe tradition of conducting debates in the Gelukpa tradition was set in many monasteries of the Gelukpa sect, namely the Ganden Monastery, the Sera Monastery, the Drepung Monastery and the JIC, not only in pre-modern Tibet but also in other similar monasteries established in exile, such as in Sera, India. At each location in Tibet, the debates are held under eight debating schedules in a year, depending on the rituals and festivals observed during the whole year. Each daily session is held between eight breaks when students debate on issues of Buddhist scriptures and related subjects. In the Sera monastery, the debate alternated by rituals has a daily schedule (with alterations to suit the climatic season) of the Morning debate (07:00 to 10:00), Noon debate (11:00 to 13:00), Afternoon debate (14:00 to 16:00) and Night debate (08:30 to 09:30).\n\nThe monastery hosts an impressive festival, popularly known as the ‘Sera Bengqin Festival’, which is largely attended by monks and devotees. The festival is held some time in February as per the Gregorian calendar corresponding to specific date fixed by the monastery according to the Tibetan calendar. On the festival day, a Dorje Pestle is ceremoniously taken to the Potala Palace. The Dalai Lama offers prayers to the Buddha to bestow strength and blesses the Pestle. Thereafter, the pestle is briefly placed on the heads of the monks and disciples by the Khenpo (president) of the Ngaba Zhacang.\n\nAnother popular festival witnessed by visitors and locals is the Sho Dun Festival held in the month of August in the Gregorian calendar. The festival represents the symbolic Buddha-Unfolding, where worship of the Buddha is the essential part.\n\nGraduates of Sera Jey College who are known in the West include:\n\n\n\n"}

They describe themselves as a Unitarian Universalist (UU) summer camp. People attending SUUSI predominantly abide by the teachings of Unitarian Universalism, but many participants belong to other denominations or faiths. Attendees range in age from newborn to elderly.\n\nThe mission of SUUSI is to provide a one-week experience evoking the best within us, in concert with Unitarian Universalist principles. SUUSI offers the opportunity to share an intergenerational environment of love, personal freedom, ethics, and joy in an intentional, nonjudgmental community.\n\nIn early 1950, some thirty-five individuals gathered \"to share in joyful community\" at Lake Waccamaw, North Carolina.\n\nIn recent years the camp has been held on the campus of Virginia Tech, in Blacksburg, but in 2008 it returned to the college campus of Radford University in Radford, Virginia, where it had been held previously.\n\nIn 2016 SUUSI returned to North Carolina moving to the campus of Western Carolina University in Cullowhee.\n\nMany people attend SUUSI for its spiritual impact. Daily programming includes minister-led morning talks as well as evening worship services.\n\nTaught entirely by volunteers, SUUSI workshops cover a range of topics, including art, history, science, technology, politics, religion and culture.\n\nMany participants take nature trips to experience the local environment in all its biodiversity. These trips may focus on local trails, caves, rivers or terrain; likewise, they may focus on specific wildflowers, trees, animals, insects, etc. SUUSI nature trips practice a Leave No Trace (LNT) outdoor ethics.\n\nSUUSI's evening programming includes nightly performances and events. Typical offerings include cabarets, talent shows, dance venues (restricted by age), a coffeehouse lounge and movie nights. SUUSI frequently attracts professional-level entertainers for nightly performance.\n\nSUUSI is an independent, incorporated, not-for-profit organization governed by its bylaws and policy manual. SUUSI has a 14-member Board of Trustees, of which 11 are voting members. The Board chooses the Director of the Institute and approves the operating budget. Board positions are both elected and appointed. Unitarian Universalist churches are organized into regional districts. Several SUUSI Board positions are appointed by the three southeastern UU district boards. At large and youth representatives are elected at SUUSI. SUUSI is a member of the Council of Unitarian Universalist Camps and Conferences.\n\nThe Core Staff is composed of the Director and staff leaders who coordinate the numerous departments and activities associated with this one-week Institute and camp. Departments include Communications, Denominational Affairs, Equipment, Locations, Nature, Nightlife, Registration/Housing, Teens, Treasurer, Workshops, Youth and Young Adults. In addition, approximately 150 SUUSI attendees complete the totally volunteer staff needed to manage all the camp activities. All SUUSI staff members report to a Core Staff member, ultimately reporting to the Director, who in turn reports to the above mentioned board.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1334163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1334163", "title": "Thangka", "text": "Thangka\n\nA thangka, variously spelt as thangka, tangka, thanka, or tanka (; ; Nepal Bhasa: पौभा), is a Tibetan Buddhist painting on cotton, silk appliqué, usually depicting a Buddhist deity, scene, or mandala. Thangkas are traditionally kept unframed and rolled up when not on display, mounted on a textile backing somewhat in the style of Chinese scroll paintings, with a further silk cover on the front. So treated, thangkas can last a long time, but because of their delicate nature, they have to be kept in dry places where moisture will not affect the quality of the silk. Most thangkas are relatively small, comparable in size to a Western half-length portrait, but some are extremely large, several metres in each dimension; these were designed to be displayed, typically for very brief periods on a monastery wall, as part of religious festivals. Most thangkas were intended for personal meditation or instruction of monastic students. They often have elaborate compositions including many very small figures. A central deity is often surrounded by other identified figures in a symmetrical composition. Narrative scenes are less common, but do appear.\n\nThangka serve as important teaching tools depicting the life of the Buddha, various influential lamas and other deities and bodhisattvas. One subject is The Wheel of Life (\"Bhavachakra\"), which is a visual representation of the Abhidharma teachings (Art of Enlightenment). The term may sometimes be used of works in other media than painting, including reliefs in metal and woodblock prints. Today printed reproductions at poster size of painted thangka are commonly used for devotional as well as decorative purposes. Many tangkas were produced in sets, though they have often subsequently become separated.\n\nThangka perform several different functions. Images of deities can be used as teaching tools when depicting the life (or lives) of the Buddha, describing historical events concerning important Lamas, or retelling myths associated with other deities. Devotional images act as the centerpiece during a ritual or ceremony and are often used as mediums through which one can offer prayers or make requests. Overall, and perhaps most importantly, religious art is used as a meditation tool to help bring one further down the path to enlightenment. The Buddhist Vajrayana practitioner uses a thanga image of their yidam, or meditation deity, as a guide, by visualizing \"themselves as being that deity, thereby internalizing the Buddha qualities\" tangkas hang on or beside altars, and may be hung in the bedrooms or offices of monks and other devotees.\n\nTibetan Buddhist painting developed from widespread traditions of early Buddhist paintings which now only survive in a few sites such as the Ajanta Caves in India and the Mogao Caves on the Silk Road, which has very extensive wall-paintings and was the repository for what are now the earliest surviving Tibetan paintings on cloth. The thanka form developed alongside the tradition of Tibetan Buddhist wall paintings, which are or were mostly in monasteries.\n\nThe early history of the form is more easily traced through these murals, which survive in greater numbers than the portable paintings which certainly once existed. Most thanka were commissioned by individuals, who were believed to acquire merit by doing so. They might then be given to a monastery or another individual, or retained for use by the commissioner. Some thangka have inscriptions on their back recording that they were the personal meditation image (\"thugs dam\") of a notable monk. Most artists were probably monks, although lay artists seem to have existed, as they did for metalwork sculpture. The commissioner would provide the materials, which were often valuable, and by tradition the compensation to the artist was regarded as a \"gift\" rather than a fee. The word \"thangka\" means \"thing that one unrolls\" in Classical Tibetan. Thangka are very rarely signed, but some artists are known, more because they were important monastic leaders than famous as artists. Painting was a valued accomplishment in a monk.\n\nThe earliest survivals of Tibetan paintings on cloth are in some pieces from the Mogao Caves at Dunhuang on the Silk Road, in Gansu province, China. The \"Library Cave\" there was a repository of old or worn out manuscripts, paintings, prints, textiles and other items which was sealed off in the 11th century, after several centuries of deposits. Many of the paintings have Tibetan inscriptions or are in a style that can be recognized as Tibetan, as opposed to the dominant Chinese style and some pieces reflecting Indian styles. Though they are hard to date, it is thought that these pieces mainly come from a period c. 781–848 when the area was ruled by Tibet.\n\nSurviving tangkas on cloth certainly from Tibet itself start in the 11th century, after the revival of Buddhism; there are some 20 surviving from this and the 12th century. Such early examples typically have compositions that are already complex, but less so than in later examples. As later the typical compositions shows a central figure flanked by smaller other figures, often in framed compartments, or surrounded by flaming halos or seated on small clouds. Behind these figures a landscape background including much sky is often indicated, though little of it may be visible. The central figure may be a deity, and arhat, or an important monk, and the same groups make up the background figures. Several of the figures may be different \"aspects\" or reincarnations of each other according to Buddhist theology. In the example at left the flanking bodhisattvas are in a style, one of several found in such figures in this period, that appears derived from central Indian art.\n\nOver the following centuries Tibetan painting, both on walls and thangka, continued to develop in its distinctive style, balancing between the two major influences of Indo-Nepalese and Chinese painting, despite Buddhism being in general decline in both those regions. Styles could vary considerably between the different regions of Tibet as well as the wider region where tangkas were painted. Within Tibet the regions nearer Nepal and China were often more influenced by those styles. Bhutanese tangkas were mainly influenced by Central Tibet. The different monastic orders also developed somewhat different stylistic characters.\n\nTibetan painting incorporated many elements from Chinese painting, especially from the 14th century onwards, reaching a peak in the 18th century. One aspect of this was allowing more space and emphasis to the landscape background. In general the style of figures in thangka remains derived from the Indo-Nepalese tradition. According to Giuseppe Tucci, by the time of the Qing Dynasty, \"a new Tibetan art was then developed, which in a certain sense was a provincial echo of the Chinese 18th century's smooth ornate preciosity.\" Throughout the period the Chinese Imperial court retained diplomatic and other contacts with Tibet for political reasons, but when the Manchu Qing dynasty came to power court interest in Tibetan Buddhism increased, and many Chinese works in a very refined and elegant style, though eventually becoming rather stiff, were produced by Imperial artists and often sent to Tibet as gifts, influencing local styles. As well as the court style, there was influence from the regions of China near to Tibet.\n\nTangkas were painted in all the areas where Tibetan Buddhism flourished, which apart from those mentioned already included Mongolia, Ladakh, Sikkim, and parts of Himalayan India in Arunachal Pradesh, Dharamshala, and Lahaul and Spiti district in Himachal Pradesh. It is also practiced in parts of Russia (Kalmykia, Buryatia, and Tuva) and Northeast China.\n\nOther traditions of Buddhist scroll paintings are not usually covered by the term thangka, although they may have many similarities, and descend from the same origins. An example is Japanese painting, where a number of very early examples survive from the Nara (710-794) and Heian periods (794 to 1185). Most of these are National Treasures of Japan. \"Raigō-zu\" developed as one popular genre, showing the Amida Buddha accompanied by bodhisattvas welcoming the souls of the faithful to his Western Paradise. These were, and still are, carried into the house of a person who was near death.\n\nBased on technique and material, tangkas can be grouped by types. Generally, they are divided into two broad categories: those that are painted (Tib.) bris-tan—and those made of silk, either by appliqué or embroidery.\n\nTangkas are further divided into these more specific categories:\n\n\nWhereas typical tangkas are fairly small, with painted area between about 20 to 50 centimetres high, there are also giant festival tangkas, usually appliqué, and designed to be unrolled against a wall in a monastery for particular religious occasions. These are likely to be wider than they are tall, and may be sixty or more feet across and perhaps twenty or more high. In Bhutan at least these are called thongdrels. There are also larger than average thankas that were designed for altars or display in temples.\n\nSomewhat related are Tibetan tsakli, cards which look like miniature tangkas perhaps up to 15 centimetres high, and often square, usually containing a single figure. These were mostly produced in sets and were usually used in earlier stages of training monks, or as initiation cards or offerings, or to use when constructing temporary mandalas. Another related form is the painted wooden top cover for a manuscript book, giving a long narrow strip, typically some 6 cm by 55 cm, often painted with a row of seated figures in compartments. The techniques for both these forms are essentially the same as for thangka, and presumably the same artists worked on them. Because tangkas can be quite expensive, people nowadays use posters of tangkas as an alternative to the real tangkas for religious purposes.\n\nSources on Asian art often describe all-textile tangkas as \"tapestry\", but tangkas that meet the normal definition of tapestry with the image created only by weaving a single piece of fabric with different colours of thread are extremely rare, though a few tapestry examples in the Chinese \"kesi\" technique are known, mostly from the medieval period. There is a large example in the Hermitage Museum, although in this and other pieces the different colours are woven separately and then sewn together in a type of patchwork. Most thangka described as tapestry are some combination of embroidery, appliqué and other techniques.\n\nTangkas are painted on cotton or silk. The most common is a loosely woven cotton produced in widths from 40 to 58 cm (16 - 23 inches). While some variations do exist, tangkas wider than 45 cm (17 or 18 inches) frequently have seams in the support. The paint consists of pigments in a water-soluble medium of animal glue. Both mineral and organic pigments are used. In Western terminology, this is a distemper technique; although it is often described as a form of gouache, this is incorrect, and the paint was applied as a warm liquid, mixed shortly before application.\n\nMost old thangka have inscriptions on the back, usually the mantra of the deity depicted, but sometimes also information as to later owners, though rarely information about the original commissioner or artist. Sometimes x-rays allow pious inscriptions placed under the paint on the front of the image to be seen. Inscriptions may be made in the shape of a stupa, or sometimes other shapes.\n\nThe composition of a thangka, as with the majority of Buddhist art, is highly geometric. Arms, legs, eyes, nostrils, ears, and various ritual implements are all laid out on a systematic grid of angles and intersecting lines. A skilled thangka artist will generally select from a variety of predesigned items to include in the composition, ranging from alms bowls and animals, to the shape, size, and angle of a figure's eyes, nose, and lips. The process seems very methodical, but often requires deep understanding of the symbolism involved to capture the spirit of it.\n\nThangka often overflow with symbolism and allusion. Because the art is explicitly religious, all symbols and allusions must be in accordance with strict guidelines laid out in Buddhist scripture. The artist must be properly trained and have sufficient religious understanding, knowledge, and background to create an accurate and appropriate thangka:\n\n\"Tibetan art exemplifies the nirmanakaya, the physical body of Buddha, and also the qualities of the Buddha, perhaps in the form of a deity. Art objects, therefore, must follow rules specified in the Buddhist scriptures regarding proportions, shape, color, stance, hand positions, and attributes in order to personify correctly the Buddha or Deities.\"\n\nThe earliest surviving thangka paintings from Nepal date to about the 14th century AD, but this is probably well after Buddhists and Hindus began to make illustrations of the deities and natural scenes. Historically, Tibetan and Chinese influence in Nepalese paintings is quite evident in Paubhas (Tangkas), and Nepalese styles have been a significant influence on Tibetan art. Paubhas are of two types, the Palas which are illustrative paintings of the deities and the Mandala, which are mystic diagrams paintings of complex test prescribed patterns of circles and square each having specific significance. It was through Nepal that Mahayana Buddhism was introduced into Tibet during reign of Angshuvarma in the seventh century AD. There was therefore a great demand for religious icons and Buddhist manuscripts for newly built monasteries throughout Tibet. A number of Buddhist manuscripts, including Prajnaparamita, were copied in Kathmandu Valley for these monasteries. Astasahas rika Prajnaparamita for example, was copied in Patan in the year 999 AD., during the reign of Narendra Dev and Udaya Deva, for the Sa-Shakya monastery in Tibet. For the Nor monastery in Tibet, two copies were made in Nepal, one of Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita in 1069 AD and the other of Kavyadarsha in 1111 AD. The influence of Nepalese art extended to China in regular order in the thirteenth century. Nepalese artisans were dispatched to the courts of Chinese emperors at their request to perform their workmanship and impart expert knowledge, with the Nepalese innovator and architect Balbahu, known by his popular name Araniko becoming the chief Imperial artist of Kubilai Khan.\n\nAfter the introduction of paper, palm leaf became less popular, however, it continued to be used until the eighteenth century. Paper manuscripts imitated the oblong shape but were wider than the palm leaves. From the fifteenth century onwards, brighter colours gradually began to appear in Nepalese thangka. Because of the growing importance of the tantric cult, various aspects of Shiva and Shakti were painted in conventional poses. Mahakala, Manjushri, Lokeshwara and other deities were equally popular and so were also frequently represented in thangka paintings of later dates. As Tantrism embodies the ideas of esoteric power, magic forces, and a great variety of symbols, strong emphasis is laid on the female element and sexuality in the paintings of that period.\n\nReligious paintings worshipped as icons are known as Paubha in Newari and thangka in Tibetan. The origin of Paubha or thangka paintings may be attributed to the Nepalese artists responsible for creating a number of special metal works and wall- paintings as well as illuminated manuscripts in Tibet. Realizing the great demand for religious icons in Tibet, these artists, along with monks and traders, took with them from Nepal not only metal sculptures but also a number of Buddhist manuscripts. One of the earliest specimens of Nepalese Thangka painting dates from the thirteenth /fourteenth century and shows Amitabha surrounded by bodhisattva. Another Nepalese thangka with three dates in the inscription (the last one corresponding to 1369 A.D.), is one of the earliest known thangka with inscriptions. The \"Mandala of Vishnu \" dated 1420 A.D., is another fine example of the painting of this period. Early Nepalese Tangkas are simple in design and composition. The main deity, a large figure, occupies the central position while surrounded by smaller figures of lesser divinities.\n\nDuring the reign of Tibetan Dharma King Trisong Duetsen the Tibetan masters refined their already well-developed arts through research and studies of different country's tradition. Thanka painting's lining and measurement, costumes, implementations and ornaments are mostly based on Indian styles. The drawing of figures is based on Nepalese style and the background sceneries are based on Chinese style. Thus, the thangka paintings became a unique and distinctive art. Although the practice of thanka painting was originally done as a way of gaining merit it has nowadays evolved into a commercial business and the noble intentions it once carried has been diluted. Tibetans do not sell Tangkas on a large scale as the selling of religious artifacts such as tangkas and idols is frowned upon in the Tibetan community and thus non Tibetan groups have been able to monopolize on its (thangka's) popularity among Buddhist and art enthusiasts from the west.\n\nThangka have developed in the northern Himalayan regions among the Lamas. Besides Lamas, Gurung and Tamang communities are also producing Tankas, which provide substantial employment opportunities for many people in the hills. Newari Thankas or paubha have been produced in Kathmandu valley from the 13th century.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "311160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=311160", "title": "World Jewish Congress", "text": "World Jewish Congress\n\nThe World Jewish Congress (WJC) was founded in Geneva, Switzerland, in August 1936 as an international federation of Jewish communities and organizations. According to its mission statement, the World Jewish Congress' main purpose is to act as \"the diplomatic arm of the Jewish people.\" Membership in the WJC is open to all representative Jewish groups or communities, irrespective of the social, political or economic ideology of the community's host country. The World Jewish Congress headquarters are in New York City, US, and the organization maintains international offices in Brussels, Belgium; Jerusalem, Israel; Paris, France; Moscow, Russia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; and Geneva, Switzerland. The WJC has special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council.\n\nThe WJC is made up of five regional branches: WJC North America, the Latin American Jewish Congress, the European Jewish Congress, the Euro-Asian Jewish Congress, and the WJC Israel. Besides that, Jewish umbrella organizations in 100 countries are directly affiliated to the World Jewish Congress. Its highest decision-making body is the Plenary Assembly, which meets every four years and elects the lay leadership (Executive Committee) of the WJC. In between plenary assemblies, meetings of the WJC Governing Board are normally held once a year. Affiliated Jewish organizations send delegates to these two WJC bodies; their number depends on the size of the Jewish communities they represent.\n\nA special meeting of the Plenary Assembly, attended by over 400 delegates and observers from over 70 countries, was held in Buenos Aires in March 2015. The last regular plenary assembly was held In New York in April 2017, and prior to that in Budapest in May 2013, with 600 delegates and observers in attention.\n\nThe WJC also maintains a Research Institute based in Jerusalem, Israel. It is involved in research and analysis of a variety of issues of importance to contemporary Jewry, and its findings are published in the form of policy dispatches.\n\nOperating under the auspices of the World Jewish Congress in Israel, the Israel Council on Foreign Relations has since its inception in 1989 hosted heads of state, prime ministers, foreign ministers and other distinguished visitors to Israel and has issued several publications on Israeli foreign policy and international affairs, including its tri-annual foreign policy journal, the Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe WJC's current policy priorities include combating anti-Semitism, especially the rise of neo-Nazi parties in Europe, providing political support for Israel, opposing the \"Iranian threat\", and dealing with the legacy of the Holocaust, notably with respect to property restitution, reparation and compensation for Holocaust survivors, as well as with Holocaust remembrance. One of the WJC's major programs is concerned with the plight of Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries. The WJC is also involved in inter-faith dialogue with Christian and Muslim groups.\n\nAt the 13th Plenary Assembly in Jerusalem in January 2009, Ronald S. Lauder was formally and unanimously elected as WJC president, having previously served as acting president. Lauder was confirmed in his post by the 14th Plenary Assembly, which took place in Budapest in May 2013, and for a third term by the 15th Plenary Assembly in New York, in April 2017.\n\nFrench banker Baron David René de Rothschild serves as chairman of the WJC Governing Board, and Lebanese-born Chella Safra from Brazil is the treasurer of the organization. Viatcheslav Moshe Kantor, the president of the European Jewish Congress was named as chairman of the WJC Policy Council. Since 2013, Robert Singer has been CEO and executive vice-president of the organization.\n\nWhile the WJC Executive Committee comprises almost 50 members, including the heads of the 12 largest Jewish communities in the world outside Israel, a smaller Steering Committee is running the day-to-day activities of the organization. It is composed of the president, the chairman of the WJC Governing Board, the treasurer, the chairmen of the five regional affiliates, the chairmen of the Policy Council, and other members.\n\nThe World Jewish Congress was established in Geneva, Switzerland in August, 1936, in reaction to the rise of Nazism and the growing wave of European anti-Semitism. Since its foundation, it has been a permanent body with offices around the world. The main aims of the organization were \"to mobilize the Jewish people and the democratic forces against the Nazi onslaught\", to \"fight for equal political and economic rights everywhere, and particularly for the Jewish minorities in Central and Eastern Europe\", to support the establishment of a \"Jewish National Home in Palestine\" and to create \"a worldwide Jewish representative body based on the concept of the unity of the Jewish people, democratically organized and able to act on matters of common concern\".\n\nThe WJC's precursor organizations were the American Jewish Congress and the \"Comité des Délégations Juives\" (Committee of Jewish Delegations). The latter was established in March 1919 to represent Jewish communities at the Paris Peace Conference, and advocated for Jewish minority rights in various countries, including the negotiation of rights for Jews in Turkey in the Treaty of Sèvres (1920) and special agreements with smaller eastern European states. Headed by Russian Zionist Leo Motzkin, the \"Comité des Délégations Juives\" was composed of delegations from Palestine, the United States, Canada, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, East Galicia, Romania, Transylvania, Bukovina, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Yugoslavia, and Greece, and funded mainly by the World Zionist Organization.\n\nHowever, the first impetus for the creation of the WJC came from the American Jewish Congress. In December 1917, the AJC adopted a resolution calling for the \"convening of a World Jewish Congress\", \"as soon as peace is declared among the warring nations\" in Europe. In 1923, Motzkin visited the United States and addressed the AJC Executive Committee, \"pleading for a World Conference of Jews to discuss the conditions of Jews in various lands and to devise ways and means for effective protection of Jewish rights.\" Conferences co-organized by Motzkin and the AJC leaders Julian Mack and Stephen Wise took place in 1926 in London and in 1927 in Zurich, Switzerland. The latter was attended by 65 Jews from 13 countries, representing 43 Jewish organizations, though the main Jewish groups in Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, as well as the American Jewish Committee, declined the invitation to attend.\n\nThe First Preparatory World Jewish Conference was held in Geneva in August 1932. A preparatory committee was headed by Zionist Nahum Goldmann, who was one of the leading advocates of the establishment of an international Jewish representative body. Goldmann defined the purpose of the World Jewish Congress as follows:\n\nIt is to establish the permanent address of the Jewish people; amidst the fragmentation and atomization of Jewish life and of the Jewish community; it is to establish a real, legitimate, collective representation of Jewry which will be entitled to speak in the name of the 16 million Jews to the nations and governments of the world, as well as to the Jews themselves.\n\nThe conference approved plans to set up the new organization in 1934, with headquarters in New York and European offices in Berlin, Germany. In a manifesto, delegates called upon the Jewish people to unite as the only effective means of averting danger. The Jews, the declaration said, had to rely on their own power with the assistance of such enlightened sections of the world which had not yet been saturated with poisonous anti-Semitism. It added: \"The World Jewish Congress does not aim at weakening any existing organizations, but rather to support and stimulate them.\" The new organization would be based on the \"concept of the Jewish people as a national entity, and authorized and obligated to deal with all problems affecting Jewish life.\"\n\nIn the summer of 1933, following the rise to power of Adolf Hitler and his NSDAP in Germany, American Jewish Congress President Bernard Deutsch called on US Jewish organizations to support the establishment of a World Jewish Congress \"to prove the sincerity of their stand\" in favor of the embattled Jews of Germany.\n\nAfter two more preparatory conferences in 1933 and 1934, the First Plenary Assembly, held in Geneva in August 1936, established the World Jewish Congress as a permanent and democratic organization. Elections for delegates to that assembly had to be according to democratic principles, namely secret, direct, and based on proportional representation. The 52 American delegates, for instance, were chosen at an Electoral Convention which met in Washington, DC, on 13/14 June 1936 and which was attended by 1,000 representatives from 99 communities in 32 US states.\n\nThe World Jewish Congress's expressed goal was Jewish unity and the strengthening of Jewish political influence in order to assure the survival of the Jewish people, which involved the creation of a Jewish state. 230 delegates representing 32 countries gathered for the first WJC assembly. Addressing a press conference in Geneva, Stephen S. Wise assailed German Jews for opposing the WJC. He said: \"I must make clear that the congress is not a parliament nor an attempt at a parliament. It is nothing more than an assembly of representatives of those Jewries which choose to associate themselves in defense of Jewish rights. The congress will not be wholly representative until all Jews choose to be represented by it.\"\nAlthough the delegates elected the US federal judge and erstwhile president of the American Jewish Congress Julian Mack as honorary president of the WJC, Wise was appointed as chairman of the WJC Executive and thus \"de facto\" leader of the congress. Nahum Goldmann was named as chair of the Administrative Committee. The new WJC Executive immediately drew up a declaration asking the British government not to halt immigration into Palestine and presented it to British diplomats in Bern, Switzerland.\n\nThe WJC chose Paris as its headquarters and also opened a liaison office to the League of Nations in Geneva, first headed by the Swiss international lawyer and WJC Legal Advisor Paul Guggenheim and later by Gerhart Riegner, who initially served as Guggenheim's secretary.\n\nIn its fight against growing anti-Semitism in Europe, the WJC pursued a two-pronged approach: the political and legal sphere (mainly the lobbying of the League of Nations and public statements) on the one hand, and an attempt to organize a boycott of products from countries such as Nazi Germany on the other. Given the weakness of the League of Nations vis-à-vis Germany and the successful efforts by the Nazi regime to stave off an economic boycott of German products, both approaches proved not very effective.\n\nFollowing the November 1938 pogroms against Jews in Germany called Kristallnacht in which at least 91 Jews were killed and many synagogues and Jewish shops destroyed, the WJC issued a statement: \"Though the Congress deplores the fatal shooting of an official of the German Embassy in Paris by a young Polish Jew of seventeen, it is obliged to protest energetically against the violent attacks in the German press against the whole of Judaism because of this act and, especially, to protest against the reprisals taken against the German Jews after the crime.\"\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the WJC headquarters moved from Paris to Geneva to facilitate communications with Jewish communities in Europe. In the summer of 1940, by which time most of Europe had fallen under Nazi occupation, the World Jewish Congress's headquarters were moved to New York to share office space with the American Jewish Congress, and a special WJC office was set up in London. The British Section of the WJC was tasked with acting as the European representative of the organization.\n\nSome of the personnel who worked in the WJC's European offices immigrated to the United States when the WJC moved its headquarters there. At the New York office in the 1940s, the major departments were: Political Department, Institute of Jewish Affairs (research and legal work), Relief and Rescue, Department for Culture and Education (or Culture Department), and Organization Department. In 1940, the WJC opened a representative office in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nThe WJC's initial priorities included safeguarding Jewish minority rights, combating anti-Semitism in Europe, and providing emergency relief to Jews fleeing Nazi persecution. The WJC also concentrated on security for Jewish refugees and victims of the war. In 1939, the World Jewish Congress set up a relief committee for Jewish war refugees (RELICO) and cooperated with the International Committee of the Red Cross to protect Jews in Nazi-occupied countries.\n\nThe WJC also lobbied Allied governments on behalf of Jewish refugees, and urged US Jewish organizations to work towards waiving immigration quotas for Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution. In 1940, General Charles de Gaulle, the leader of the French government in exile, pledged to the WJC that all measures taken by the Vichy regime against the Jews would be repudiated upon France's liberation.\n\nIn late 1941 and early 1942, Western diplomats and journalists received scattered information about Nazi massacres of many thousands of Jews in German-occupied Poland and Russia. However, the news was difficult to confirm. In June 1942, Ignacy Schwarzbart, one of two Jewish representatives on the Polish National Council of the Polish government-in-exile, held a press conference with WJC officials in London, where it was stated that an estimated one million Jews had already been murdered by the Germans.\n\nOn 8 August 1942, the WJC's Geneva representative Gerhart Riegner sent a telegram to the US vice-consul in Geneva in which he informed the Allies for the first time about the Nazis planned Final Solution to exterminate all Jews in the German-occupied territories. Riegner had received his information from the German industrialist Eduard Schulte.\n\nHis telegram read as follows:\n\nReceived alarming report about plan being discussed and considered in \"Führer\" headquarters to exterminate at one fell swoop all Jews in German-controlled countries comprising three and a half to four million after deportation and concentration in the east thus solving Jewish question once and for all stop campaign planned for autumn methods being discussed including hydrocyanic acid stop\nIt was only several weeks later, on 28 August 1942, that WJC President Stephen S. Wise received Riegner's alarming message. The telegram was met with disbelief despite preexisting evidence for mass executions. The US State Department considered it \"a wild rumor, fueled by Jewish anxieties\", while the British Foreign Office refused to forward the telegram for the time being and called for the allegations to be investigated first. It was only on 25 November 1942 that the WJC was allowed to release the news to the world.\n\nOn 28 July 1942, 20,000 people participated in a WJC-organized \"Stop Hitler Now\" demonstration at New York's Madison Square Garden. Nine months later, on 1 March 1943, an estimated 22,000 people crowded into the same hall and a further 15,000 stood outside at a WJC rally addressed by Wise, Chaim Weizmann, New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia and others. However, the US government did not heed calls to rescue European Jews. Early in 1944, US Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau stated in front of President Roosevelt that \"certain officials in our State Department\" had failed while it would have been commanded by duty to \"prevent the extermination of the Jews in German-controlled Europe\".\n\nThroughout the war, the WJC lobbied the Allied governments to grant visas to Jewish refugees from Europe and to ensure the restoration of Jewish minority rights in areas liberated by the Allied forces. Despite the US State Department's opposition, the WJC obtained permission from the US Treasury Department, headed by Henry Morgenthau, to transmit funds to Europe for the rescue and assistance of persecuted Jews. According to a report by Riegner, these funds helped to bring 1,350 Jewish children from the occupied countries to Switzerland and 70 to Spain.\n\nHowever, at the Bermuda Refugee Conference in 1943, both the United States and Britain refused to relax their immigration policies, not even for British Mandatory Palestine. In reaction, the WJC published a comment which said: \"The truth is that what stands in the way of aid to the Jews in Europe by the United Nations is not that such a program is dangerous, but simple lack of will to go to any trouble on their behalf.\" Only in January 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the setting up of the War Refugee Board, whose purpose was to \"rescue victims of enemy oppression who are in imminent danger of death\".\n\nThe World Jewish Congress also tried - mostly in vain - to convince the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to assert its authority more forcefully vis-à-vis the Germans, and urged it to secure the status of civilian prisoners of war under the Third Geneva Convention on prisoners of war for those Jews that were confined to ghettos and Nazi concentration camps, which would have entitled the ICRC to provide care to them. However, the ICRC stuck to the view that it was \"in no position to bring pressure to bear upon governments\", and that the success of its work \"depended on discreet and friendly successions.\"\n\nThe Holocaust era president of WJC, Stephen Wise, opposed the Bergson Group's rescue activism. Later president Nachum Goldman told the State Department (per department protocol) that Hillel Kook (aka Peter Bergson) is an adventurer and does not represent \"organized Jewry\". He pleaded to either deport or draft Hillel Kook in order to stop his activism\n\nOn 9 August 1944, Leon Kubowitzki (later Aryeh Leon Kubovy), the head of the WJC's Rescue Department, relayed a message from Ernest Frischer of the Czechoslovak State Council to the US State Department urging the destruction of the gas chambers and the bombing of railways lines leading to the Auschwitz death camp. US Undersecretary of War John J. McCloy rejected the suggestion five days later, writing to Kubowitzki:\n\nAfter a study it became apparent that such an operation could be executed only by the diversion of considerable air support essential to the success of our forces now engaged in decisive operations elsewhere and would in any case be of such doubtful efficacy that it would not warrant the use of our resources.\n\nIn November 1944, at the War Emergency Conference held in Atlantic City, USA, the WJC elaborated a program for the post-war period, which included calls for reparations from Germany to Jews and the use of heirless Jewish property for Jewish rehabilitation. Also at that conference, Stephen S. Wise was elected president of the World Jewish Congress. Delegates decided to embark on a $10,000,000 fund-raising effort for relief and increased political activity throughout the world. The news agency JTA also reported the following:\n\nThe closing session of the conference also adopted a resolution recommending that the Congress establish a Department of Community Service which would be charged with aiding in the reconstruction of the spiritual and cultural life of Jews in liberated countries. Another resolution extended the gratitude of the gathering to the Vatican and to the Governments of Spain, Sweden and Switzerland for the protection they offered under difficult conditions to the persecuted Jews in German-dominated Europe. At the same time, it expressed regret at the fact that 'deplorably little has been done to have Axis civilians under the power of the United Nations exchanged for Jews in ghettos, internment, concentration and labor camps.'\n\n\"Related video: Stephen Wise addresses the World Jewish Congress War Emergency Conference in Atlantic City, November 1944\"\n\nIn February 1945, the head of the Swedish office of the WJC, Hilel Storch, established contact through an intermediary with SS chief Heinrich Himmler. In April, Norbert Masur of the Swedish Section of the WJC secretly met with Himmler at Harzfeld, around 70 kilometers north of Berlin. Masur had been promised safe conduct by Himmler. Through negotiations with the Nazi leader and the subsequent talks with the head of the Swedish Red Cross, Folke Bernadotte, the WJC was allowed to save 4,500 inmates from the women's concentration camp at Ravensbrück. Approximately half of these women, who had been deported to Germany from over forty countries, were Jewish.\n\n\"See also\": Hilel Storch\n\nAt the end of the war, the WJC undertook efforts to rebuild Jewish communities in Europe, pushed for indemnification and reparation claims against Germany, provided assistance to displaced persons and survivors of the Holocaust, and advocated for the punishment of Nazi leaders for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The World Jewish Congress notably took part in the formulation of the principles governing the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal and furnished evidence against Nazi leaders to the US prosecutors.\nOn 19 August 1945, a conference of representatives of European Jews was organized in Paris, France by the WJC, whose leadership (Wise, Goldmann, Kubowitzki) traveled there from the US. Delegates from Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland attended the gathering.\n\nOn 21 September 1945, Pope Pius XII received WJC Secretary General Leon Kubowitzki in audience, who recounted to the pope the \"great losses\" suffered by the Jews during the war and expressed gratitude for what the church had done to help \"our persecuted people.\" Kubowitzki suggested a papal encyclical on the Catholic Church's attitude toward the Jews and a condemnation of anti-Semitism. \"We will consider it,\" Pius XII reportedly replied, adding: \"certainly, most favorably, with all our love.\" The WJC also urged the Vatican to assist in the recovery of Jewish children saved by Catholics during the Holocaust.\n\nThe WJC also supported the foundation of the United Nations Organization in 1945. In 1947, the organization became one of the first NGOs to be granted consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).\n\nIn 1947, an estimated 30,000 people attended the opening of the Latin American Conference of the World Jewish Congress at Luna Park, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nAlthough its principal purpose was to defend the rights of Jews in the Diaspora, the WJC always actively supported the aims of Zionism, i.e. creation of a Jewish National Home in Palestine. The Yishuv, the Jewish community in British Mandatory Palestine, was represented at the First Plenary Assembly of the WJC in 1936, which affirmed in a resolution \"the determination of the Jewish people to live in peaceful cooperation with their Arab neighbors on the basis of mutual respect for the rights of each.\"\n\nIn 1946, in a memorandum to the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry on Palestine drafted by WJC Political Secretary Alexander L. Easterman, the WJC declared that \"the only hope of reviving the life and culture of the Jewish people lies in the establishment of a fully self-governing Jewish Homeland, recognised as such throughout the world; that is, a Jewish Commonwealth in Palestine.\"\n\nWJC officials lobbied UN member states in favor of the adoption of UN General Assembly Resolution 181 of 1947, which called for the creation of a Jewish and an Arab state in Palestine. On 15 May 1948, the day of Israel's proclamation of independence, the WJC Executive pledged \"world Jewry's solidarity\" with the fledgling Jewish state. In Montreux, Switzerland, delegates from 34 countries attended the Second Plenary Assembly of the World Jewish Congress, held from 27 June to 6 July 1948.\n\nIn 1949, the World Jewish Congress called on the newly established Federal Republic of Germany to acknowledge responsibility and liability of the German people for the wrongs inflicted on the Jewish people by the Nazi regime. In 1950, the WJC opened an office in Frankfurt to function as a \"listening post\" on developments in Germany. In representations to the United States, Britain and France, the WJC detailed Jewish moral and material claims on Germany. In 1951, Nahum Goldmann, at the request of the Israeli government, established the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany (Claims Conference).\n\nThe same year, in a declaration approved by the parliament, West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer recognized Germany's duty to make moral and material restitution to the Jewish people and signaled its readiness to engage in negotiations with Jewish representatives and the State of Israel. \"Unspeakable crimes have been committed in the name of the German people, calling for moral and material indemnity [ ... ] The Federal Government are prepared, jointly with representatives of Jewry and the State of Israel [ ... ] to bring about a solution of the material indemnity problem, thus easing the way to the spiritual settlement of infinite suffering,\" Adenauer said.\n\nOn 10 September 1952, WJC and Claims Conference head Nahum Goldmann and the West German federal government signed an agreement embodied in two protocols. Protocol No. 1 called for the enactment of laws that would compensate Nazi victims directly for indemnification and restitution claims arising from Nazi persecution. Under Protocol No. 2, the West German government provided the Claims Conference with 450 million deutschmarks for the relief, rehabilitation and resettlement of Jewish victims of Nazi persecution. Similar agreements were also signed with the State of Israel.\n\nSubsequent to these agreements, the Claims Conference continued to negotiate with the German government for amendments to the various legislative commitments and monitored the implementation of the various compensation and restitution laws. According to the Claims Conference, more than 278,000 Jewish Holocaust survivors received lifetime pensions under the German Federal Indemnification Laws. Germany expended a total of US$60 billion in satisfaction of Jewish claims.\n\nIn 1952, the World Jewish Congress called on the Austrian government to intensify efforts for the restitution of heirless Jewish property. Austrian Chancellor Leopold Figl subsequently pledged to remedy Jewish grievances.\n\nAt the Third Plenary Assembly in Geneva (4 to 11 August 1953), Nahum Goldmann was elected president of the World Jewish Congress, having previously served as acting president.\n\nAlthough the Soviet Union initially supported the creation of the State of Israel, during the 1950s the Jewish state emerged as part of the Western camp, and Zionism raised fears of internal dissent and opposition among the Communist leadership.\n\nDuring the later part of the Cold War, Soviet Jews were suspected of being traitors, Western sympathizers, or security liabilities. The Communist leadership closed down various Jewish organizations and declared Zionism an ideological enemy. Synagogues were often placed under police surveillance, both openly and through the use of informers. As a result of the persecution, both state-sponsored and unofficial, anti-Semitism became deeply ingrained in the society and remained a fact for years. The Soviet media, when depicting political events, sometimes used the term 'fascism' to characterize Israeli nationalism. Jews often suffered hardships, epitomized by often not being allowed to enlist in universities, work in certain professions, or participate in government. Many Jews felt compelled to hide their identities by changing their names.\n\n\"See also\": History of the Jews in Russia\nIn 1953, the World Jewish Congress condemned the indictment in Moscow of Jewish doctors as alleged conspirators against the Soviet Union leadership, the so-called Doctors' plot, and called a leadership meeting in Zurich, Switzerland, which was canceled at the last minute due to the death of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. The new Soviet leadership declared that the case against the doctors had been fabricated.\n\nIn 1956, WJC leaders delivered a memorandum to Soviet leaders Nikolai Bulganin and Nikita Khrushchev during their visit to London, and a year later the World Jewish Congress Executive launched a worldwide call to attention regarding the plight of Jews in the Soviet Union and other Communist countries. This resulted in a growing international campaign for their cultural and religious rights and for the reunion of families separated by the Cold War. After a lapse of seven years, the organization also re-established contact with several Jewish communities in Communist Eastern Europe. In 1957, the Jewish community of Hungary re-affiliated with the WJC.\n\nIn 1960, the WJC convoked the International Conference on Soviet Jewry in Paris, which was chaired by Goldmann. In 1971, the WJC co-sponsored the First World Conference of Jewish Communities on Soviet Jewry in Brussels, Belgium. Successor events were held in Brussels and Zurich in 1976.\n\nAt the second Brussels conference, Jewish leaders called on the Soviet Union to implement the Declaration of Helsinki on human rights, respect its own constitution and laws and \"recognize and respect the right of Jews in the USSR to be united with their brethren in the Land of Israel, the Jewish historic homeland.\" Under the motto, 'Let my people go!, the Soviet Jewry movement caught the attention of statesmen and public figures throughout the West, who considered the Soviet Union's policy toward Jews to be in violation of basic human and civil rights such as freedom of immigration, freedom of religion, and the freedom to study one's own language, culture and heritage. \"You have no choice but to release Soviet Jewry,\" US President Ronald Reagan told Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev during the latter's first state visit to the US in 1987.\n\nIn 1983, Edgar Bronfman suggested that \"American Jews should abandon their strongest weapon, the Jackson–Vanik amendment, as a sign of goodwill that challenges the Soviets to respond in kind.\"\n\nAfter [Mikhail Gorbachev]'s ascension in 1985, Bronfman's New York Times message began to resonate with the public. In early 1985, Bronfman secured an invitation to the Kremlin and on September 8–11, visited Moscow, becoming the first World Jewish Congress President to be formally received in Moscow by Soviet Officials. Carrying a note from Shimon Peres, Bronfman met with Gorbachev, and initiated talks of a Soviet Jewish airlift. It is said that Peres' note called on the Soviet Union to resume diplomatic relations with Israel.\n\nIn a Washington Post profile a few months after the September trip, Bronfman laid out what he thought had been accomplished during his September meetings. He said, \"There's going to be a buildup of pressure through the business community. The Russians know the Soviet Jewry issue is tied to trade ... My guess is that over a period of time, five to ten years, some of our goals will be achieved.\" Author Gal Beckerman says in his When They Come For Us We'll Be Gone, \"Bronfman had a business man's understanding of the Soviet Jewish issue. It was all a matter of negotiation, of calculating what the Russians really wanted and leveraging that against emigration.\"\n\nOn 25 March 1987, WJC leaders Edgar M. Bronfman, Israel Singer, Sol Kanee and Elan Steinberg, as well as the head of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, Morris B. Abram, arrived in Moscow to discuss the matter with Soviet government ministers, though officials swiftly denied that the USSR had agreed to an increase in Jewish emigration and had invited an Israeli delegation to visit Moscow. Nonetheless, the visits by WJC officials to Moscow were widely seen as helpful in securing the exit permits for prominent Jews in the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1989, Soviet Jewish organizations were granted permission by the authorities to join the World Jewish Congress, and two years later in Jerusalem, several directly elected delegates from the Soviet Union were officially represented for the first time at a World Jewish Congress Plenary Assembly.\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II and the establishment of the State of Israel, the World Jewish Congress was actively involved in assisting Jews in Arab and other Muslim countries, who had come under increasing pressure. In January 1948, WJC President Stephen Wise, appealed to US Secretary of State George Marshall: \"Between 800,000 and a million Jews in the Middle East and North Africa, exclusive of Palestine, are in 'the greatest danger of destruction' at the hands of Muslims being incited to holy war over the Partition of Palestine ... Acts of violence already perpetrated, together with those contemplated, being clearly aimed at the total destruction of the Jews, constitute genocide, which under the resolutions of the General Assembly is a crime against humanity.\" The United States, however, did not take any follow-up action to investigate these pleadings.\n\nThe WJC also submitted a memorandum on the problem to the UN Economic and Social Council, asking for urgent action. The memorandum in particular mentioned an Arab League document which planned to strip Jewish citizens of their rights and belongings as part of a calculated plan. However, when the WJC brought the Arab League document before the ECOSOC, its president Charles H. Malik, a representative of Lebanon to the UN, refused to bring it to the floor.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the WJC conducted negotiations with a number of Arab governments, notably in North Africa, and pleaded with them to allow their Jewish populations to leave their native countries. With the advance of Arab nationalism, especially during the 1950s, these efforts were increasingly complicated. In 1954, a WJC delegation visited Morocco, then still under French colonial rule.\n\nThe WJC leadership also kept in close touch with the leaders of the Moroccan independence movement, including the exiled sultan of Morocco, Mohammed V, who insisted that an autonomous Morocco would guarantee the freedom and equality of all its citizens, including access of non-Muslims to public administration. When Morocco became independent from France in 1956, WJC Political Director Alex Easterman immediately began negotiations with Prime Minister Mbarek Bekkay and other government officials, pressing them to grant Jews the right to leave.\n\nWhilst in 1957 an agreement was reached to allow for the emigration of all 8,000 Jews from Mazagan that were held in a refugee camp near Casablanca, a 1959 WJC report concluded that in spite of repeated assurances by the new government that Jewish rights would be safeguarded, \"internal political conflicts have obstructed a solution\" to the problem that Moroccan Jews willing to leave the country were denied passports by the authorities. In 1959, Morocco became a member of the Arab League, and all communications with Israel were stopped. However, both King Mohammed V and his successor, Hassan II of Morocco continued to emphasize that Jews enjoyed equal rights in their country.\n\nDelegates from 43 countries attended the Fourth WJC Plenary Assembly held in Stockholm in 1959.\n\nIn 1960, the WJC convoked a special conference in Brussels following a series of anti-Semitic incidents in Europe.\nIn 1966, the speaker of the West German parliament, Eugen Gerstenmaier, delivered an address titled, 'Germans and Jews – A Problem Unresolved' to the Fifth Plenary Assembly in Brussels, Belgium, becoming the first senior German politician to address a WJC conference, which caused some controversy within the WJC. Some delegates from Israel boycotted the session with Gerstenmaier in protest.\n\nIn 1963, the American Section of the WJC was set up to broaden the organization's constituency in the country with the biggest Jewish community worldwide. In 1974, the Board of Deputies of British Jews affiliated with the World Jewish Congress. The British Section of the WJC, which had previously represented UK Jewry, was dissolved.\n\nTo emphasize its solidarity with the State of Israel, the WJC held its Sixth Plenary Assembly in 1975 for the first time in Jerusalem, and with one exception, all plenary assemblies have since been held there. The delegates also adopted new statutes and a new structure for the organization, and the WJC entered into a cooperation agreement with the World Zionist Organization.\n\nThe World Jewish Congress was vocal in efforts to repeal United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379, which was adopted on November 10, 1975 and held \"that Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination\".\n\nThe WJC Executive characterized the resolution as an \"attempt to defame Zionism by equating it with imperialism, colonialism, racism, and apartheid, […] amounting to incitement to racism and racial hatred.\" All communities and organizations affiliated to the Congress were urged to take immediate action to mobilize public opinion against the resolution. Israel made revocation of Resolution 3379 a condition of its participation in the Madrid Peace Conference of 1991. Resolution 3379 was revoked in 1991 by UN General Assembly Resolution 4686.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the WJC also campaigned for an end to the Arab boycott of Israel.\n\nAt the WJC Plenary in 1975, longtime WJC leader Nahum Goldmann (then 80) stood again for WJC president. Several Israeli delegates, notably from the Herut movement, but also former Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, opposed Goldmann's re-election for his criticism of Israel's policies, notably with respect to the peace process.\n\nTwo years later, in 1977, the American real estate developer and erstwhile president of B'nai B'rith International Philip Klutznick succeeded Goldmann as WJC president. In 1979, when Klutznick was named US secretary of commerce by President Jimmy Carter, the Canadian-American businessman Edgar Bronfman Sr. took over as acting head of the organization. Bronfman was formally elected WJC president by the Seventh Plenary Assembly, held in Jerusalem in January 1981.\n\nUnder the leadership of Bronfman, the new Secretary General Israel Singer (who took over from Gerhart Riegner in 1983), and Executive Director Elan Steinberg, the WJC adopted a more aggressive style. Steinberg characterized the change as follows: \"For a long time, the World Jewish Congress was meant to be the greatest secret of Jewish life, because the nature of diplomacy after the war was quiet diplomacy. This is a newer, American-style leadership — less timid, more forceful, unashamedly Jewish.\" \nBronfman led the World Jewish Congress in becoming the preeminent Jewish organization, as they broadened the organization's base by bringing in new member communities in Europe. Through campaigns to free Soviet Jewry, the exposure of the Nazi past of Austrian President Kurt Waldheim, and the campaign to compensate victims of the Holocaust, Bronfman became well known internationally in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nOn 25 June 1982, WJC President Edgar Bronfman became the first leader ever of a Jewish organization to address the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nIn 1985, Carmelite nuns opened a convent near the site of the former Nazi death camp Auschwitz I. WJC President Edgar Bronfman called for the removal of the convent. In public statements, other Jewish leaders, including former WJC Secretary General Gerhart Riegner, also called for the removal. A year later, the Catholic Church agreed to those requests and said the convent would be removed within two years.\n\nHowever, the Carmelites stayed put, and a year later erected a large cross from a 1979 mass with the Pope near their site. The World Jewish Congress Executive strongly urged the Vatican to take action against the convent's presence and said Pope John Paul II should \"exercise his authority\" to order the prompt removal of convent and cross. The WJC Executive said the pontiff's action was necessary to implement the agreement major European Catholic cardinals, including the cardinal of Kraków, Franciszek Macharski, had signed with Jewish leaders on 22 February 1987 in Geneva. Edgar Bronfman declared: \"It is not only a matter of the Auschwitz convent, but the broader implications of historical revisionism in which the uniqueness of the Holocaust and the murder of the Jewish people is being suppressed.\"\n\nA few months later, the Carmelites were ordered by Rome to move. The WJC praised the Vatican for taking action, although the nuns remained on the site until 1993, leaving the large cross behind.\n\n\"See also:\" Auschwitz cross\n\nDuring the mid-1980s, the World Jewish Congress also entered into diplomatic talks with several Central and Eastern European countries, notably Communist East Germany, whose leadership the WJC urged to recognize its obligations to Jewish victims of Nazi Germany. In February 1990, GDR Prime Minister Hans Modrow sent a letter to WJC President Edgar Bronfman in which he recognized on behalf of the East German government the GDR's responsibility for German crimes committed against the Jewish people under the Nazi regime. In a statement, Modrow said:\n\nThe German Democratic Republic stands unalterably by its duty to do everything against racism, Nazism, anti-Semitism, and hatred among peoples, so that, in the future, war and fascism will never again start from German soil, but only peace and understanding among people.\n\nA few weeks later, the first freely elected parliament of the GDR, the \"Volkskammer\", passed a resolution which recognized the GDR's responsibility for the Holocaust and asked \"Jews around the world for forgiveness\". The GDR pledged to compensate for material damages to Jews and to safeguard Jewish traditions. The resolution became part of the German reunification treaty and continues to be part of German law.\n\nIn 1987, the World Jewish Congress held a meeting of its Executive Committee in Budapest, Hungary, the first WJC gathering in Communist Eastern Europe since the end of World War II. The Hungarian government had accepted that there would to be no restrictions to the attendance of Israeli delegates or the subjects of discussion.\n\nIn 1986, the World Jewish Congress alleged that Austrian presidential candidate Kurt Waldheim, a former secretary general of the United Nations, had lied about his service as an officer in the mounted corps of the Nazi Party \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA), and his time as German ordnance officer in Thessaloniki, Greece, from 1942 to 1943.\n\nWaldheim called the allegations \"pure lies and malicious acts\". In a telex to Bronfman, he said that his past had been \"deliberately misinterpreted.\" Nevertheless, he admitted that he had known about German reprisals against partisans: \"Yes, I knew. I was horrified. But what could I do? I had either to continue to serve or be executed.\" He said that he had never fired a shot or even seen a partisan. His former immediate superior at the time stated that Waldheim had \"remained confined to a desk\".\n\nFormer Austrian Jewish chancellor Bruno Kreisky called the World Jewish Congress's actions an \"extraordinary infamy\" adding that in election, Austrians \"won't allow the Jews abroad to order us about and tell us who should be our President.\"\n\nIn view of the ongoing international controversy, the Austrian government decided to appoint an international committee of historians to examine Waldheim's life between 1938 and 1945. Their report found no evidence of any personal involvement of Waldheim in those crimes. At the same time, although he had stated that he was unaware of any crimes taking place, the historians cited evidence that Waldheim must have known about war crimes.\n\nThroughout his term as president (1986–1992), Waldheim and his wife Elisabeth were officially deemed \"personae non gratae\" by the United States. They could visit only Arab countries and the Vatican City. In 1987, they were put on a watch list of persons banned from entering the United States and remained on the list even after the publication of the International Committee of Historians' report on his military past in the Wehrmacht.\n\nOn May 5, 1987, Bronfman spoke to the World Jewish Congress saying Waldheim was \"part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine\". Waldheim subsequently filed a lawsuit against Bronfman, but dropped the suit shortly after due to a lack of evidence in his favor.\n\nIn 1992, the World Jewish Congress established the World Jewish Restitution Organization (WJRO), an umbrella body of Jewish organizations and including the Jewish Agency for Israel. Its purpose is to pursue the restitution of Jewish property in Europe, outside Germany (which is dealt with by the Claims Conference). According to its website, the WRJO's mission is to consult and negotiate \"with national and local governments to conclude agreements and ensure legislation concerning the restitution of property to the Jewish people\", to conduct \"research on Jewish property in national and local archives and to establish a central data bank in which information on Jewish communal property will be recorded and assembled, and to allocate \"funds for the preservation of Jewish cultural and educational projects in that country. To date, such funds have been establishes in Poland, Romania and Hungary.\" Current World Jewish Congress President Ronald S. Lauder is chairman of the WRJO.\n\nIn the late 1990s, as President of the WJC, Edgar Bronfman championed the cause of restitution from Switzerland for Holocaust survivors. Bronfman began an initiative that led to the $1.25 billion settlement from Swiss banks, aiming to resolve claims \"that the Swiss hoarded bank accounts opened by Jews who were murdered by the Nazis\".\n\nIn total, the WJC, the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, the World Jewish Restitution Organization, and the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims, founded in 1998, have secured millions of dollars for the victims and survivors of the Holocaust in payments from Germany, Swiss banks, Insurances and other parties totaling $20 billion.\nIn 1995, the WJC initiated negotiations on behalf of various Jewish organizations with Swiss banks and the government of Switzerland over so-called dormant World War II-era bank accounts of Holocaust victims. The WJC entered a class-action lawsuit in Brooklyn, NY alleging that Holocaust victims and their families faced improper barriers to accessing WWII-era Swiss bank accounts because of requirements such as death certificates (typically non-existent for Holocaust victims), and that some Swiss banks made deliberate efforts to retain the account balances indefinitely. The claims also included the value of art works purported to have been stolen, \"damages\" to persons denied admission to Switzerland on the strength of refugee applications, and the value or cost of labor purported to have been performed by persons being maintained at Swiss government expense in displaced-person camps during the Holocaust, along with interest on such claims from the time of loss. The WJC marshaled the support of US government officials including New York Senator Alfonse D'Amato, who held hearings of the Senate Banking Committee on the topic and claimed that \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" of WWII-era Jewish assets remained in Swiss banks. At the behest of US President Bill Clinton, Undersecretary of Commerce Stuart Eizenstat testified at these hearings that Swiss banks knowingly purchased looted gold from the Nazis during WWII. Eizenstat was later named special envoy of the US government for Holocaust issues. The report relied exclusively on US government archives. It contained no new historical information on Nazi victims' deposits into Swiss banks, and criticized the decisions of US officials who negotiated settlements with Switzerland after the war as being too lenient.\n\nAudits ordered by the Swiss government of dormant accounts between 1962 and 1995 showed a total of US $32 million (in 1995 terms) in unclaimed war-era accounts. However, during the negotiations, the Swiss banks agreed to commission another audit of wartime accounts, headed by former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. The Volcker Commission report concluded that the 1999 book value of all dormant accounts possibly belonging to victims of Nazi persecution that were unclaimed, closed by the Nazis or closed by unknown persons was CHF 95 million. Of this total, CHF 24 million were \"probably\" related to victims of Nazi persecution.\n\nThe commission recommended that for settlement purposes, the book values should be modified back to 1945 values (by adding back fees paid and subtracting interest) and then be multiplied by 10 to reflect average long-term investment rates in Switzerland.\nOn 12 August 1998, several major Swiss banks agreed to pay Holocaust survivors and their relatives more than US$1.25 billion over the following three years. As part of the settlement, the plaintiffs agreed to drop a lawsuit against the Government-owned Swiss National Bank in US courts.\n\nIn 1997, a study commissioned by the World Jewish Congress concluded that Nazi Germany had looted at least US $8.5 billion in gold between 1933 and 1945 from Jews and other victims. The study estimated that a third of the gold had come from individuals and private businesses rather than central banks and that over US $2 billion of privately owned gold eventually ended up in Swiss banks. Switzerland rejected the WJC accusations. In response to inquiries from the World Jewish Congress, the US Federal Reserve Bank admitted in 1997 that personal gold seized by the Nazis was melted into gold bars after the war and then shipped as gold bullion to the central banks of four European countries. In 1996, Sweden also opened an investigation into assertions by the World Jewish Congress that looted Nazi gold from World War II had been deposited in Swedish government bank vaults.\n\nDuring the 1990s and 2000s, at the behest of the World Jewish Congress a total of 17 European countries established special committees to look into their role during World War II. Many set up funds to compensate Jewish and other victims of the war.\n\nIn 1997, French Prime Minister Alain Juppé created a commission to investigate the seizures of Jewish property by the occupying Nazi forces and the French collaborators during the war.\n\nIn 2000/2001, the World Jewish Congress helped to negotiate a compensation agreement with the German government and industry under which a €5 billion fund was set up to compensate World War II slave and forced laborers, mainly living Central and Eastern Europe, who had hitherto not received any compensation payments for the suffering under Nazi rule.\n\nIn 1998, the WJC released a list of 2,000 people who allegedly took part in the Nazis' massive looting of art. It named people from 11 countries, including museum curators, gallery owners, art experts and other intermediaries. A few weeks later, in Washington DC, delegates from 44 countries agreed to set up a central registry on art looted by the Nazis which could be established on the internet.\n\nRonald S. Lauder, then chairman of the WJC Art Recovery Commission, estimated that 110,000 pieces of art worth between US $10 and 30 billion were still missing. In 2000, the World Jewish Congress criticized museums for waiting for artworks to be claimed by Holocaust victims instead of publicly announcing that they have suspect items. In the wake of the WJC accusations, a number of countries commissioned investigations into Nazi-looted art.\n\nThe WJC has evinced a great interest in Poland, both before the war, when the country was home to some 3.25 million Jews (10 percent of that country's total population, forming the largest Jewish community in Europe); and in the post-war period, when the Jewish community was reconstituted. In second half of the 1930s, in the face of a marked rise in antisemitism, the WJC attempted to intervene on behalf of Polish Jewry. In December 1936, for example, Nahum Goldmann visited Poland and conferred with the Minister of Foreign Affairs Jozef Beck, but this \"demarche\" did little to abate the situation. In order to counter the drastic affects of the ban on kosher slaughter (Shechita), the WJC Economic Department prepared a study on the legislation and proposed various relief measures that could be instituted. The WJC also intervened to ensure that Polish Jews deported from Germany at the end of October 1938 and stranded in Zbaszyn would be allowed to resettle elsewhere in Poland.\n\nAfter the war, when a wave of anti-Jewish violence swept the country, the WJC prevailed upon the Polish government to remove all obstacles faced by Jews who sought to leave the country and for the most part Jews were able to emigrate unhindered until about 1950. Most left without visas or exit permits thanks to a decree of Gen. Spychalski.\n\nAs the Jewish community dwindled, over successive waves of emigration (the last in 1968), the WJC saw Poland as an important repository of Jewish history as well as the custodians of the killing grounds in which much of European Jewry fell victim to the German Final Solution. In 1979, the Polish government and the WJC worked to have Auschwitz placed on the UNESCO World Heritage list as site of genocide. The organization repeatedly pressed Poland to ensure that in Auschwitz and other Nazi German death camp sites, the memory of the Jews who had been the main victims, would not be subsumed in collective memory. As such, at the end of the 1980s, the organization was deeply involved in the struggle to have the Carmelite convent that had been established on its ground removed. Rabbi David Rosen of the Anti-Defamation League noted at the time: \"To some extent the WJC did determine the tune. Their style created the atmosphere in which no public Jewish organization could not get involved. Had the WJC not got involved, those issues might not have developed in the way they did.\"\n\nThe WJC has consistently lobbied the Polish government to enact legislation that would ensure the restitution of private property seized during the Nazi occupation and later during the Communist regime. In April 1996, during a discussion about the restitution of Jewish communal property that had been seized during the Holocaust, WJC Secretary General Israel Singer, allegedly stated that \"More than three million Jews died in Poland, and the Polish people are not going to be the heirs of the Polish Jews. We are never going to allow this. ( ... ) They're gonna hear from us until Poland freezes over again.\" If Poland did not satisfy Jewish claims it would be \"publicly attacked and humiliated\" in the international forum, Singer said according to a Reuters report.\n\nIn April 2012, President Lauder declared that by prevaricating on the restitution issue Poland was \"telling many elderly prewar landowners, including Holocaust survivors, that they have no foreseeable hope of even a small measure of justice for the assets that were seized from them\".\n\nIn pursuit of a more nuanced approach to the history of Polish-Jewish relations that includes Jewish recognition of Polish losses suffered during World War II, the WJC's Research Institute published two monographs which explored the attempts to revive Polish Jewry and the ways in which Poles and Jews have confronted their common history. Moreover, the Israel Council on Foreign Relations, which operates under the auspices of the World Jewish Congress, together with the Polish Institute for International Affairs, held two successive conferences (one in Warsaw in 2009 and the other in Jerusalem in 2010) to discuss bilateral relations and international issues of mutual concern. At the second gathering the 20th anniversary of the re-establishment of relations between the two countries was marked.\n\nThe mission statement of the World Jewish Congress says that the organization seeks \"to enhance solidarity among Jewish communities throughout the world and, recognizing the centrality of the State of Israel to contemporary Jewish identity, to strengthen the bonds of Jewish communities and Jews in the Diaspora with Israel.\"\n\nThe WJC recently started to focus its main activity on countering the delegitimization of Israel.\n\nThe WJC lobbies international organizations, notably the United Nations, to ensure that governments \"apply the same standards to Israel when judging its actions compared with those of other countries.\" The WJC states on its website that \"Israel should not be singled out for criticism by countries which do not themselves adhere to the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law\" and that \"Israel needs to be treated fairly in international organizations, especially in United Nations bodies such as the UN Human Rights Council.\"\n\nIn early 2009, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder wrote to UN High Commissioner on Human Rights, Navi Pillay, ahead of the Durban Review Conference, asking that the clauses stigmatizing Israel in the 2001 Durban Declaration and Program of Action be repealed.\n\nLauder also denounced the United Nations Human Rights Council for issuing what he called a \"profoundly unbalanced and biased report\" into Israel's raid of the Gaza flotilla in May 2010. \"We note that [the council] has lost its moral compass, where terrorism is deemed activism, and self-defense is called disproportionate violence. If the UNHRC wants to regain the integrity of its original purpose, it cannot submit to being manipulated into justifying and covering up terrorism,\" the WJC president declared.\n\nIn December 2010, the World Jewish Congress, together with several Israeli government ministries, convened a consultation entitled 'Building Partnerships and Synergies in Countering the Assault on Israel's Legitimacy' in Jerusalem. It was attended by over 100 professional Jewish leaders from 60 different organizations. The conference identified the need for a collaborative effort on behalf of world Jewry and the State of Israel to advance the protection of Israel's rights and \"halt the political and economic assault\" against it. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Minister for Strategic Affairs, Moshe Yaalon, Jewish Agency for Israel Chairman Natan Sharansky, former Canadian Justice Minister and current member of Parliament Irwin Cotler, Italian lawmaker Fiamma Nirenstein and international Jewish leaders participated in the consultation, which led to the establishment of the 'Global Coalition for Israel' and the formation of task forces to implement the conclusions reached.\n\nTogether with the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, the WJC in September 2011 published a policy book entitled 'The Rights of Israel as a Nation-State in International Diplomacy'. The book features academic articles by international legal and political experts across the political spectrum, including Alan Dershowitz, Ruth Lapidoth, Stanley Urman, Shlomo Avineri, Martin Gilbert, Dan Diker and others. The authors outline Israel's historical and legal rights, the plight of the Jewish refugees from Arab countries, and refute all the major claims made against Israel by local and international actors.\n\nIn April 2017, United Nations Secretary General António Guterres became the first UN chief ever to address a World Jewish Congress gathering and also addressed the issue of bias against Israel. Speaking in New York to the delegates of the WJC Plenary Assembly, Guterres promised to stand up against anti-Israel bias at the world organization and said the Jewish state \"must be treated like any other member state.\" He also stressed that Israel had an \"undeniable right to exist and to live in peace and security with its neighbors,\" and that \"the modern form of anti-Semitism is the denial of the existence of the State of Israel.\" \n\nThe World Jewish Congress has endorsed a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and is opposed to unilateral actions by either side. It states on its website that \"a negotiated settlement between Israel and the Palestinians based on a two-state solution is the only legitimate and just way to provide for a lasting peace. The nascent Palestinian state should respect the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. A Palestinian state can only be founded if it respects Israel's right to exist in security. Initiatives that help to enable the Palestinians to advance economically and socially should also be supported as a means of stabilizing the peace process.\"\n\nIn the run-up to the 2011 UN Security Council vote that would have resulted in the success of the Palestinian unilateral bid for statehood, the WJC worked to underscore what it perceived as a dangerous move for Israel, for the sustainability of a future Palestinian state and for peace in the Middle East.\n\nIn September 2011, the World Jewish Congress, together with the International Council of Jewish Parliamentarians, assembled in New York to lobby the international community against allowing the Palestinian Authority's unilateral move to become a full member of the United Nations and bypass negotiations with Israel. At a dinner hosted by WJC President Lauder, the delegation of Jewish parliamentarians engaged in an open discussion with UN ambassadors from key countries including Germany, France, Poland and Russia.\n\nRonald Lauder, writing in the German newspaper Die Welt, called for Israel to be admitted into the Western alliance NATO: \"Israel needs real guarantees for its security. European NATO member states – including Turkey – must admit the state of Israel into the Western alliance,\" the WJC president wrote. He referred to the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia and said they were reminders of how \"unpredictable\" developments in the Middle East were. Israeli NATO membership \"would send a strong signal to other countries not to take on Israel\", Lauder argued.\n\nIn May 2012, Lauder reacted \"with dismay\" at a suggestion by Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Eamon Gilmore to impose a European Union-wide import ban on products made in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which Gilmore said were \"illegal\" and made peace between Israel and the Palestinians \"impossible\". Lauder said: \"Such boycott calls are cynical and hypocritical. Minister Gilmore is taking aim at the only liberal democracy in the Middle East while keeping quiet about those who really wreak havoc in the region: the Assads, Ahmadinejads and their allies Hezbollah and Hamas.\" He added that \"the West Bank territories are legally disputed and not illegally occupied.\"\n\nIn June 2012, on the third anniversary of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech at Bar-Ilan University, Lauder published a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal and other newspapers in which he called on Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to return to the negotiating table. \"Accept the offer to talk, President Abbas. It takes two sides to make peace,\" Lauder wrote.\n\nThe World Jewish Congress continues to focus on Holocaust legacy issues, including the restitution of Jewish assets seized during and after World War II.\n\nPreserving the memory of the Shoah is a key issue in the WJC's public efforts. In January 2011, WJC President Lauder accompanied German President Christian Wulff and a number of Holocaust survivors to Auschwitz. Lauder declared:\n\nAuschwitz is the largest Jewish cemetery in the world. Auschwitz is where the systematic annihilation of European Jewry was refined and perfected. It is where four gas chambers and four crematoria annihilated more than a million Jews. It is the place where the notorious SS \"Doctor\" Josef Mengele conducted cruel medical experiments on people. It is also the place where thousands upon thousands of Poles, Roma and Sinti and Soviet prisoners of war were brutally murdered alongside the Jewish victims. We owe it to all of them, and to the survivors, to make sure that today's anti-Semites and hatemongers – those who want to destroy the Jewish people and its only refugee, the Jewish nation state Israel – will not get another go at it.\n\nOn January 28, 2017, WJC President Lauder defended a statement made by President Donald Trump on the occasion of International Holocaust Remembrance Day that had generated controversy for failing to mention that the victims of the Holocaust were Jewish. In response to Anti-Defamation League director Jonathan Greenblatt's criticism of the statement, Lauder dismissed concern for remembering the Jewish identities of the victims of the Holocaust as \"manufactured controversies.\"\n\nSince the end of World War II, the WJC has pressed governments and private enterprises to return seized or looted Jewish assets to their rightful owners. It was instrumental in concluding agreements with a number of European countries.\n\n\"See above:\" Restitution of Holocaust-era assets and compensation payments\n\nIn its policy guidelines the WJC states that negotiations on Holocaust-era assets are \"conducted in the framework of the World Jewish Restitution Organization in coordination with the Israeli government and with the support of the US government and the European Union.\"\nThe organization emphasizes that \"the distribution of any compensation monies should not be handled by the WJC. The WJC does not seek any form of commission or gratification payments from Holocaust-era compensation or restitution agreements.\" WJC leaders have in particular urged the Polish government to come up with a restitution law for looted private properties, but Warsaw in March 2011 announced that this was impossible due to the current economic situation.\n\nOn repeated occasions, the WJC has urged countries to ensure that Holocaust denial is publicly condemned and fought. WJC officials have been critical of a rise of marches in a number of European countries including Hungary and Serbia by WWII Nazi veterans, far-right extremists and neo-Nazis who publicly glorify the Hitler regime and espouse anti-Semitic ideology.\nIn July 2009, Bernie Ecclestone faced calls from WJC President Ronald S. Lauder to resign as Formula One chief after he had praised Adolf Hitler in a newspaper interview and said that Hitler \"got things done.\" Lauder said someone with Ecclestone's views should not be allowed to run such an important and popular racing series. He urged Formula One teams, drivers and host countries to suspend their cooperation with him. In reaction, Ecclestone told the news agency Associated Press that \"I think the people who are saying that haven't got the power to say these things.\" Asked if the WJC was influential, Ecclestone said: \"It's a pity they didn't sort the banks out\" and \"They have a lot of influence everywhere.\" After a public outcry, Ecclestone apologized for his remarks and said he had \"been an idiot.\"\n\nThe WJC also criticized the US internet retailer Amazon.com for selling 'I love Hitler' T-shirts and similar merchandise praising senior Nazi officials. The items were later removed from the website.\n\nIn February 2012, the WJC attacked the German Federal Constitutional Court for a ruling which acquitted a Holocaust denier. WJC Vice-President Charlotte Knobloch called the verdict \"quirky\" and said that it cast a damning light on the legal proceedings. She accused the highest German court of disposing of Germany's law that makes the denial of the Shoah a crime \"through the backdoor\".\n\nFollowing an interview with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on German public television in which he repeatedly called Israel \"an artificial state\" that had been built on the \"lie of the Holocaust\", Knobloch called on the German government to publicly condemn the Iranian leader's statements and to isolate Iran diplomatically.\n\nStanding alone amongst all major Jewish organizations, World Jewish Congress President Ronald Lauder backed Donald Trump's decision to omit any mention of Jews in his 2017 Holocaust commemoration statement. Lauder contended that other Jewish groups were \"play[ing] politics\" and engaging in \"manufactured outrages\" that distracted from \"real\" instances of anti-Semitic threats. The WJC also publicly backed David M. Friedman as President Trump's nominee for ambassador to Israel, in spite of critics who accused Friedman of trivializing the gravity of the Holocaust by comparing Jewish members of the liberal pro-Israel group J Street to \"kapos\", or Nazi collaborators.\n\nThe World Jewish Congress has repeatedly called for the prosecution of presumed Nazi war criminals. WJC President Ronald S. Lauder said in 2011: \"There must never be impunity or closure for those who were involved in mass murder and genocide, irrespective of their age\". The WJC would persist in its efforts to bring the \"few old men out there who have the blood of innocent Shoah victims on their hands\" before courts of law, to be tried and held accountable for their actions.\n\nIn 2009, WJC officials called for the extradition Ukrainian-born John Demjanjuk from the United States to Germany, where he was wanted on charges of aiding to kill at least 27,900 Jews at the Sobibor death camp during World War II. Demjanjuk's trial and conviction by a Munich court in May 2011 was hailed by the organization. It declared: \"Belatedly, justice has now been done, and the family members of those who were brutally murdered in Sobibor will certainly welcome this verdict.\"\n\nIn December 2010, Lauder publicly urged Serbia to extradite Peter Egner to the United States where he was wanted to stand trial for serving in a Nazi unit during World War II that murdered 17,000 Jews. Egner died in January 2011.\n\nOne of the principal activities of the World Jewish Congress has been to fight anti-Semitism in all its forms. Its stated policy on this issue is: \"Governments and international organizations need to provide adequate resources for the fight against hatred, notably by providing security to Jewish communities and by improving education. Laws against anti-Semitism and other forms of racism need to be adopted and enforced properly in every country. All forms and expressions of neo-Nazism, xenophobia and intolerance are unacceptable and have to be condemned, and the full force of the law needs to be applied to those who are a danger to democracy liberty and Jewish communities. Marches by extremist, anti-Semitic groups should be banned where national laws provide for such a possibility. Governments and political leaders should condemn such events and work together with local Jewish communities.\"\n\nIn an opinion article entitled \"Sweden's Shame\", WJC President Ronald S. Lauder attacked the Swedish government, church officials and media for \"fanning the flames\" of hatred against Jews.\n\nIn May 2012, Lauder condemned as \"despicable\" remarks made by the Norwegian sociologist Johan Galtung who had \"revived anti-Semitic canards such as Jewish control of the media\" and suggested that Israel's Mossad could have been behind the 2011 \"massacres in Norway committed by Anders Breivik\" in which 77 people died. Lauder declared: \"There is a growing tendency to blame the Jews for all evil that happens under the sun. It is a scandal that a leading academics such as Galtung does not shy away from citing notorious forgeries such as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion to support his bigoted arguments.\"\n\nIn August 2012, the WJC president criticized Austrian politicians for failing to publicly denounce the leader of the third-largest political party in the country, the FPÖ, Heinz-Christian Strache, who had posted an anti-Semitic cartoon on his Facebook page. \"Clearly, and not for the first time, the FPÖ leader is trying to whip up anti-Semitic sentiment. His repeated denials are not credible because his words and actions speak for themselves,\" Ronald Lauder said in a statement, adding: \"This scandal shows that anti-Jewish resentment is still widespread, and unscrupulous politicians are allowed to exploit it for electioneering purposes. That is mind-boggling, and it could have negative repercussions for Austrian Jews.\"\n\nIn 2013, Budapest, Hungary was chosen as a location for the 14th Plenary Assembly because of concerns over the rise of anti-Semitism in that country. Péter Feldmájer, president of the Federation of Jewish Communities in Hungary, stated this was \"a symbol of solidarity with our Jewish community, which has been faced with growing anti-Semitism in recent years\". In his speech at the opening dinner, in the presence of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder lambasted a series of recent anti-Semitic and racist incidents in Hungary. He particularly mentioned Zsolt Bayer, who had penned a newspaper column referring to Roma as \"cowardly, repulsive, noxious animals\" that are \"unfit to live among people\" and \"shouldn't be allowed to exist.\" Lauder said \"such words are reminiscent of the darkest era in European history\" and concluded that \"Hungary's international reputation has suffered in recent years\" not because it was being \"smeared by the foreign press\" but rather due to extremists in the Jobbik party. \"Jobbik is dragging the good name of Hungary through the mud,\" Lauder said. On the eve of the WJC assembly in Budapest, about 700 Jobbik supporters held a demonstration in downtown Budapest where they railed against \"Zionists\" who had \"subjugated\" the \"indigenous people\" of Hungary.\n\nIn his speech to WJC delegates, Orbán condemned the rise in anti-Semitism in Hungary and in Europe more widely. He called it a danger that \"threatens even us Christians\" and voiced determination to stamp it out. The WJC said in reaction that Orbán had not confronted the true nature of the problem. \"We regret that Mr. Orbán did not address any recent anti-Semitic or racist incidents in the country, nor did he provide sufficient reassurance that a clear line has been drawn between his government and the far-right fringe,\" a WJC spokesman said afterwards.\n\nThe World Jewish Congress has also urged internet companies, including social media giants such as Google, to act against Holocaust denial, hate speech and anti-Jewish incitement on their platforms. A survey published by the WJC in 2017 revealed that \"More than 382,000 anti-Semitic posts were uploaded to social media in 2016, an average of one post every 83 seconds\", which WJC CEO R. Robert Singer said revealed \"how alarming the situation really is.\"\n\nPreviously, the organization had urged the German branch of YouTube of tolerating clips of neo-Nazi rock bands on its platform that were illegal in Germany. In an opinion piece for the Los Angeles Times, Singer also accused the internet retailer Amazon.com of offering books that glorify the Holocaust. The WJC CEO wrote that Amazon customers \"can buy a plethora of Holocaust-denying literature, swastika pendants and other Nazi memorabilia. While books are clearly different from doormats or flags, they still violate Amazon's guidelines, not to mention common decency.\"\n\nThe WJC believes that the three Abrahamic faiths (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) can cooperate \"to respond to the challenges posed by developments in modern society, especially to discuss and promote shared values.\"\n\nInter-religious dialogue between Jews and Christians started in the 1940s, notably with the establishment of the International Council of Christians and Jews in Switzerland in 1947. The WJC has managed to establish good relations with the Catholic Church, especially since the Second Vatican Council and the Declaration \"Nostra aetate\" in 1965. Progress, however, is slow with regard to the Orthodox and Protestant Churches, which according to the WJC is mainly due to the decentralized nature of these churches and certain political issues related to the Middle East conflict.\nSince 1945, WJC leaders have been received by Catholic pontiffs a number of times. Pope Pius XII received WJC Secretary General A. Leon Kubowitzki in private audience in 1945. Pope Paul VI met WJC President Nahum Goldmann in 1969 and WJC Secretary General Gerhart Riegner in 1975. In 1979, Philip Klutznick met with Pope John Paul II, and Klutznick's successor Edgar Bronfman, Sr. was received by John Paul II in 1992 and 2003. Bronfman led a delegation of Jewish leaders for a meeting with Pope Benedict XVI in June 2005, and his successor Ronald S. Lauder was received by Benedict XVI in October 2007, December 2010 and May 2012. Pope Francis received a delegation of the International Jewish Committee on Interreligious Consultations, including several members of the WJC, in June 2013.\n\nOn his election as new Catholic pontiff, Ronald Lauder called Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio \"an experienced man, someone who is known for his open-mindedness ... a man of dialogue, a man who is able to build bridges with other faiths\".\n\nThe organization was instrumental in the creation inter-faith bodies such as the International Jewish Committee of Inter-religious Consultations (IJCIC), and it has actively participated in the International Catholic-Jewish Liaison Committee (ILC). The WJC also contributed to the establishment of diplomatic relations between the State of Israel and the Holy See in the 1990s.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the WJC persuaded Pope John II to come out in favor of the removal of a convent of Carmelite nuns which had opened near the site of the former Nazi death camp Auschwitz.\n\nThe role of the Vatican during the Holocaust remains a controversial issue and has repeatedly flared up. The beatification and possible canonization of Pope Pius XII was criticized by WJC President Ronald S. Lauder, who said that all Vatican archives on the period should be made accessible to scholars. \"There are strong concerns about Pope Pius XII's political role during World War II which should not be ignored,\" Lauder declared in a statement.\n\nIn February 2009, Lauder and the WJC were highly critical of the Vatican's decision to revoke the excommunication of Bishop Richard Williamson, a senior member of the dissident Catholic group Society of St. Pius X. Williamson, in an interview with Swedish television, had denied the existence of gas chambers in Nazi concentration camps. Lauder said: \"The Vatican was badly advised to revoke the excommunication of the four bishops ... Therefore, we call on Pope Benedict XVI to urgently address these concerns and to ensure that the achievements of four decades of Catholic-Jewish dialogue are not being damaged by a small minority of people who want to divide rather than unite.\" Lauder later praised Benedict XVI for writing a personal letter to Catholic bishops in which the Pope explained himself. \"The Pope has found clear and unequivocal words regarding Bishop Williamson's Holocaust denial, and he deserves praise for admitting that mistakes were made within the Vatican in the handling of this affair,\" the WJC president was quoted as saying.\n\nIn 2010, Ronald S. Lauder was also critical of the continued use of the Good Friday Prayer for the Jews in church liturgy. In an op-ed for the Italian newspaper \"Corriere della Sera\", the WJC president wrote: \"When the Pope allows the use of the Good Friday Prayer of the old Tridentine liturgy, which calls for Jews to acknowledge Jesus Christ as the Savior of all men, some of us are deeply hurt.\"\n\nThe World Jewish Congress considers dialogue with representatives of moderate Islam as \"one of the most important and challenging issues at this time. The increasing gap of understanding between so-called Western liberal democracies and the Islamic world is extremely dangerous,\" according to the WJC website.\n\nIn 2008, WJC leaders met with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia at an inter-faith conference in the Spanish capital Madrid. Later that year, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder also called on the Saudi monarch in New York. In December 2011, WJC Vice-President Marc Schneier was received by King Hamad of Bahrain at the royal palace in Manama.\n\nThe World Jewish Congress also co-hosted a gathering of European Muslim and Jewish leaders in Brussels in December 2010, which included meetings with senior European Union officials. On that occasion, WJC Vice-President Marc Schneier declared: \"We have hopefully kick-started a movement that will spread across Europe. The recipe really is quite simple: our two communities must focus more on what unites us than what separates us. We also must restrain the radicals within our own ranks and make sure they don't gain the upper hand.\"\n\nIn a speech in London in 2010, Schneier praised leaders of the Al-Azhar University in Cairo, considered the oldest center of Islamic scholarship in the world, for opening up inter-religious dialogue to the Jews. He declared: \"This is a landmark decision, and Al-Azhar deserves praise for it. Coming from the leading center of Islamic thinking in the world, it will be enormously helpful for all moderate forces within Islam. [ ... ] Leaders from both sides should now seize the opportunity and take Jewish-Muslim relations to the next level. Both communities have a lot more in common, and to give to the other side, than many people think.\"\n\nIn August 2018, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder called on \"Israel's government to listen to the voices of protest and outrage\" and uphold the country's democratic and egalitarian principles against the threat of dominance by restrictive Orthodox influence, from what he called 'a radical minority'.\n\nSince the Islamic revolution in 1979, and in particular following the terrorist attacks against the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires in February 1992 and the AMIA Jewish center in Buenos Aires in July 1994, in which over 100 people were killed and which Iran's leadership was accused of having masterminded, the World Jewish Congress has been vocal in denouncing what it calls the \"Iranian threat\".\n\nIn 1995, then WJC President Edgar Bronfman, Sr. was reportedly instrumental in blocking a planned deal by the DuPont-owned US oil firm Conoco with Iran. Bronfman was a member of the DuPont board of directors. The deal would have been the first major investment by an oil company in Iran since 1979, when the United States broke off trade with the country after the seizure of the US Embassy in Teheran by Islamic militants. Two months later, the WJC publicly welcomed a decision by US President Bill Clinton to impose a trade embargo on Iran. \"We applaud President Clinton's decisive blow against terrorism,\" declared WJC Executive Director Elan Steinberg. In 2006, after prosecutors in Argentina asked a judge to order the arrest of a former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and other members of his government in connection with the AMIA bombing, Bronfman said that \"Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism\", adding that \"the entire international community has a moral responsibility to ensure that Iran is held accountable for its terrorist actions.\"\n\nThe WJC lobbied for the issuing of Red Notices by Interpol against the Iranian suspects in the bombing case, which were approved by the Interpol General Assembly in November 2007. On the 18th anniversary of the AMIA bombing in July 2012, WJC President Lauder declared: \"The Iranian regime has blood on its hands, not only by suppressing dissent at home but also by sponsoring terrorism world-wide. What the world saw 18 years ago in Buenos Aires it can still see today, be it in Syria, in Lebanon or in other places.\"\n\nIn a 2010 resolution on Iran, the WJC expressed support for international condemnation of current Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's repeated calls for the abolition of the State of Israel and his statements questioning the Holocaust. The organization resolved \"to make the four-fold threat (the nuclear threat; the threat of genocidal incitement; international state sponsored terrorism; and the systematic and widespread violations of the human and civil rights of the Iranian people) that the current Iranian regime poses to international peace and stability, a high strategic priority of the WJC.\"\n\nIn 2006, the WJC launched the \"Iran Update\", \"a comprehensive weekly publication disseminated via the internet to most members of the US Congress and government, United Nations missions, foreign diplomats, European Union officials, and Israeli policymakers, in addition to Jewish communities worldwide.\" The publication focused on exposing Iran's ongoing pursuit of a nuclear capability, domestic Iranian politics, Iranian foreign policy in the Middle East and internationally, Israeli policy vis-à-vis Iran and the efforts of worldwide Jewish communities in combating Iranian Holocaust-denial and nuclear proliferation.\n\nFurther to the WJC's and other international organizations' calls, representatives of many Western countries either did not show up or walked out of the conference chamber when Iranian President Ahmadinejad attacked Israel in his speech to the Durban Review Conference in Geneva in April 2009 and to the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York in September 2009.\nThe WJC has repeatedly run campaigns accusing Iran of deceiving the international community and calling Ahmadinejad \"the world's foremost hatemonger\".\n\nIn 2008, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder criticized a visit by Swiss Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey to Tehran, where she met with Ahmadinejad mainly to help a Swiss company secure a multibillion-dollar contract to buy natural gas from Iran. Lauder told a press conference in Bern: \"Maybe that money that Switzerland is paying to Iran will some day be used to either buy weapons to kill Israelis, or buy weapons to kill Americans, or buy missiles to be able to deliver nuclear weapons.\"\n\nLauder also led diplomatic efforts to persuade European businesses to withdraw from Iran. In January 2010, he warmly welcomed the announcement by Siemens CEO Peter Löscher that his company would not seek new business in Iran.\n\nThe WJC has repeatedly urged the international community to do more to bring to justice the masterminds of the terrorist attacks against Israel's embassy and AMIA Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in the 1990s, which Argentinean prosecutors have said were carried out at the instigation of senior Iranian officials.\nIn July 2011, Olympic news outlet \"Around the Rings\" reported that World Jewish Congress president Ronald S. Lauder had issued a statement urging IOC officials to ban Iran from participating in the Olympic Games, citing Iranian athletes' refusal to compete against Israeli athletes. \"It is high time that a strong signal is sent to Iran that unless this long-standing boycott is lifted, Iranian athletes will not be allowed to enter major international events such as next year's Olympic Games in London\", Lauder said. The WJC reiterated its position when in May 2012 Iranian President Ahmadinejad announced plans to attend the London Olympics. Ahmadinejad has \"no business\" attending the London Olympic Games this summer, the \"Jewish Chronicle\" quoted a World Jewish Congress spokesman as saying.\n\nThe issue of Jewish refugees from Arab lands continues to be on the World Jewish Congress agenda today. The WJC website states that \"The plight of Jews who fled from, or still live in, Arab lands and their specific concerns are not well-known and need to be raised with governments and international organizations. Where illegal seizure of assets took place, these should be returned to their former owners, or adequate compensation should be paid. Jews remaining in Arab lands, as well as other religious minorities, should be granted religious freedom and allowed to practice their faith according to their traditions. Jewish communal sites in Arab countries must be preserved and respected.\" The WJC believes that the plight of the Jewish refugees from Arab lands has been neglected for decades by the international community, including governments and international organizations.\n\nIn September 2012, the WJC co-hosted two conferences on the issue, together with the Israeli government. They were held in Jerusalem and at the United Nations headquarters in New York, respectively. The aim was to raise the profile of the issue and enlist international support. In a speech to the New York symposium, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder urged the world to recognize the suffering of Jewish refugees. \"Now is the time to set the historical, diplomatic and legal record straight. Lasting peace can only be built on historical facts - both the issues of the Jewish refugees and the Palestinian refugees must be addressed.\" Lauder said that \"only addressing the historical facts\" could help to bring about peace. At the Jerusalem conference, a joint declaration was adopted calling on the United Nations to place the issue of Jewish refugees on its agenda and that of its affiliated forums.\n\nPalestinian critics derided the move to raise this issue now as a \"manipulative strategy\". It was \"part of a public relations campaign that is both cynical and hypocritical\", PLO Executive member Hanan Ashrawi told the newspaper USA Today.\n\nFollowing the conferences, Israel's Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman instructed Israeli diplomats around the world to raise the matter in all official government meetings and with parliamentarians. According to figures provided by the Israeli Foreign Ministry, approximately 850,000 Jews from Arab states across the Middle East left their native countries following the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 due to state-sponsored persecution. Most of them were forced to abandon their property and possessions, the ministry said.\n\nIn August 2008, World Jewish Congress and Venezuelan Jewish community leaders met in Caracas with Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez Frias. The meeting stirred some controversy in the Jewish world because of Chávez' public support for Iranian leader Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his strong criticism of Israel. However, then WJC Secretary-General Michael Schneider defended the meeting with Chávez and said the WJC acted only on behalf of, and with the backing of, the Venezuelan Jewish community.\n\nFollowing the exclusion of Israeli tennis player Shahar Peer from an ATP tournament in Dubai in February 2009, the WJC called for the \"suspension of all sporting events in the [United Arab Emirates] until Israeli participants are admitted.\" The response of the women's and men's tours to the exclusion of Peer had been \"faint-hearted,\" and they should have canceled the event immediately, WJC President Lauder was quoted by the news agency Bloomberg as saying.\n\nAhead of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the World Jewish Congress criticized the president of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, for not agreeing to hold one minute's silence at the opening ceremony in remembrance of the eleven Israeli sportsmen killed by Palestinian terrorists during the Olympic Games in Munich in 1972. Ronald Lauder said Rogge's stance was \"unfeeling\" and \"completely out of touch.\" He added: \"Forty years after the saddest moment in Olympic history - when eleven Israeli athletes and sports officials and a German police officer were killed by Palestinian terrorists - it would have been an excellent opportunity to show to everyone that the sports world stands united against terrorism ... Nobody wants to 'politicize' the Olympic Games, as the IOC seems to suggest, but Baron Rogge and his colleagues on the IOC Executive have utterly failed - or refused - to grasp the importance of such a symbolic act.\"\n\nThe WJC raises its funds mainly through the World Jewish Congress American Section, which is a non-profit body registered in the United States.\n\nA series of allegations about the organization's accounting practices and \"unusual\" money transfers, was raised in 2004 by Isi Leibler, then a vice-president of the WJC. It led to an investigation of the finances of the World Jewish Congress. A comprehensive audit of the WJC's accounts in Switzerland from 1995–2004, conducted by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, reportedly found that \"over the years $3.8 million 'disappeared' from the bank accounts\" and that there were \"significant un-reconciled cash withdrawals where there is no documentation of the usage of the funds.\" In January 2006, an investigation by the Office of the NY State Attorney General into the matter found no evidence of criminal conduct on the part of the WJC. Furthermore, the report of Attorney General Eliot Spitzer noted that the WJC had implemented all of his recommendations to improve financial oversight and management.\n\nSpitzer's office identified financial mismanagement and breaches of fiduciary duty, but found no criminal wrongdoing and concluded that any misconduct \"did not compromise the core mission\" of the organization or result in \"identifiable losses of charitable assets.\"\n\nThe report also highlighted several initiatives the WJC had taken since 2004 to improve financial management, including \"the creation of an audit committee and the position of chief financial officer, the computerization of all financial records, the creation of an employee handbook outlining official procedures and policies, the implementation of travel and reimbursement procedures, and the creation of a new fund-raising entity (the WJC Foundation).\"\n\nDespite vigorously defending Israel Singer during the Attorney General's inquiry, in March 2007 Bronfman abruptly announced his firing. He accused Singer of \"'help[ing] himself to cash from the WJC office, my cash.\" However, internal WJC documents seemed to suggest that a friction had developed between Singer and Bronfman over Singer's position on various internal WJC political matters, including the perception that he was insufficiently advocating the candidacy of Edgar Bronfman's son Matthew to the presidency of the WJC.\n\nIn May 2007, Edgar Bronfman stood down as WJC president, having served in this post for 28 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Though a sexual relation is not excluded in this form of marriage, it is consummated only in exceptional circumstances. It is simplest of Hindu marriage done before Shiva, by taking an oath in the name of Shiva and chanting \"Omkara Bindu Samyuktam, Nityam Dhyayati Yoginah; Kamadam Mokshadam Chaiva Omkaraya Namo Namaha\".\n"}
