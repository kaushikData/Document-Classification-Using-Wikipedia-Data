In her early youth she lived on the family estate near Schwarzau, Lower Austria. Her father died in 1846; when her mother married again in 1851 she left Austria and moved with her to Prussia for 10 years.\n\nOn March 12, 1860, she married baron √ñd√∂n (Edmond, Eugen or Otto) Vay de Vaya, a Hungarian magnate. They enjoyed 60 years of marriage, but without having children. The couple lived at first at Tiszal√∂k for some years, near the Hungarian-Ukrainian border, and later moved to Slovenske Konjice (Gonobitz), where they bought a mansion at Prevrat, still known as \"Baronvaj\" (\"Baron Vay's\").\n\n√ñd√∂n was a retired senior officer of the Austro-Hungarian army. On August 9, 1877, the \"Militar-Veteranen-Verein in Gonobitz\" (Association of Army Veterans in Gonobitz) was founded, primarily for ex-soldiers regardless of nationality. The association's first president was prince Hugo Veriand von Windisch-Graetz, and his deputy was baron Vay de Vaya.\n\nThe couple were both members of the local Red Cross Society committee, which in 1897 built a hospital named the \"Christiane-Lazarett\" after Christiane Habsburg, president of the Austro-Hungarian Red Cross Society. Baron Vay de Vaya decided in 1908 to have another building constructed (at his own cost) specifically for infectious disease patients. The hospital continued in operation until the beginning of World War II.\n\nAdelma was well known as a great humanitarian, and never charged for her medical advice and assistance, being always prepared to help both poor and rich people.\nOn March 1, 1921, √ñd√∂n died at Mali Lo≈°inj, where the couple had a summer villa. After his death, the widowed Adelma continued to live in the mansion, surrounded by servants. She died on May 24, 1925, at her home. Although she was a Lutheran, the Roman Catholic parish priest Franc Hrastelj approved her burial in the churchyard of St. Anna's in Slovenske Konjice.\n\nAdelma had the reputation of possessing mystical powers, probably inherited from her mother. She was reputed to have prophetic gifts and to be clairvoyant. She wrote, spoke and drew in an apparent trance-like state. She was a famous homeopath and attempted to cure people using magnetism.\n\nIn 1873 she and her husband founded at Budapest the \"Verein spiriter Forscher\" (Hungarian Spiritualist Association), of which they became the first presidents.\n\nAs knowledge and practice of spiritualism grew, Vay did great pioneer work. In \"An Encyclopaedia of Occultism\" (1920) by Lewis Spence (1874‚Äì1955), she was noted as the initiator of spiritualism in Austria-Hungary, with a decisive role also ascribed to the \"Verein spiriter Forscher\".\n\nAdelma von Vay once described her book \"Spirit, Power And Matter\" as an example of pure Christian Spiritualism. The newly formed association was not thought of as a dogmatic Spiritualistic sect but was instead anchored solidly in a framework of Christian religion, as testified by its statute of association.\n\nVay was author of many books, written in German and translated into English:\n\n\n\n\nGerman:\n\nSlovene:\n\n"}
{"id": "5245543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5245543", "title": "Ahuna Vairya", "text": "Ahuna Vairya\n\nAhuna Vairya (Avestan: \"ê¨Äê¨µê¨éê¨•ê¨Ä ê¨¨ê¨Äê¨åê¨≠ê¨åê¨åê¨Ä‚Äé)\" is the Avestan language name of Zoroastrianism's first of four Gathic Avestan formulas. The text, which appears in \"Yasna\" 27.13, is also known after its opening words yatha ahu vairyo. In Zoroastrian tradition, the formula is also known as the \"ahun(a)war\".\n\nNumerous translations and interpretations exist, but the overall meaning of the text remains obscure. The Ahuna Vairya and \"Ashem Vohu\" (the second most sacred formula at \"Yasna\" 27.14) are together \"very cryptic formulas, of a pronounced magical character.\" The Ahunavaiti Gatha (chapters 28-34 of the \"Yasna\"), is named after the Ahuna Vairya formula. \n\nLike the other three formulas (\"Ashem vohu\", \"Yenghe hatam\", \"Airyaman ishya\"), the \"Ahuna Vairya\" is part of the Gathic canon, that is, part of the group of texts composed in the more archaic dialect of the Avestan language. Together with the other three formulas, the \"Ahuna Vairya\" is part of the 'envelope' that liturgically encloses the Gathas, i.e. the hymns attributed to Zoroaster himself. One of the formulas, the \"Airyaman ishya\" (\"Yasna\" 54.1) follows the Gathas, while the other three formulas -- \"Ahuna Vairya\", \"Ashem vohu\" and \"Yenghe hatam\" (together at \"Yasna\" 27.13-27.15) -- precede them.\n\nUnlike the third and fourth formula, the first two formulas -- the \"Ahuna Vairya\" and the \"Ashem vohu\" -- are part of the Kusti prayers. Unlike the third and fourth formula, the first two do not express wishes and are technically purificatory and meditational declarations (\"asti\", \"it is\").\n\nThe \"Ahuna Vairya\" is already a subject of theological exegesis in scripture itself, in particular in \"Yasna\" 19, where \"this utterance is a thing of such a nature, that if all the corporeal and living world should learn it, and learning hold fast by it, they would be redeemed from their mortality.\" (19.10) In \"Yasna\" 19.3 and 4.8, the formula is described as having been a primordial utterance of Ahura Mazda, articulated immediately after the creation of the spiritual world (and before the material world), and that its efficacy in aiding the righteous is due to its primordial nature.\n\nAs a primordial utterance, the \"Ahura Vairya\" is described to have talismanic virtues: the power to aid mortals in distress, and inversely as a potent weapon against the demonic \"daeva\"s. Elsewhere in the Avesta, the \"Ahuna Vairya\" is described as the \"most victorious\" (\"Yasht\" 11.13), as the \"veracious word\" (\"Yasna\" 8.1), as the \"sacred gift\" (\"Yasna\" 27.7). In \"Vendidad\" 11.3, in addition to being \"most healing\", frequent recitation of the \"Ahura Vairya\" is prescribed as an act of hygiene to \"protect the body\". In \"Yasna\" 9.14, Zoroaster is given credit as the first mortal to recite it.\n\nThe hymn's supremacy among sacred Zoroastrian formulae is well developed in the 9th-11th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition. \n\nIn the \"Denkard\" ('Acts of Religion', 9th century), four of the twenty-one \"nask\"s are described to have expounded on the efficacy of the hymn (8.44.1), and each volume of the \"nask\"s is said to have been initially assigned its title from a word in the \"Ahuna Vairya\" prayer (\"Denkard\" intro, 6, 8, 17, 18, 9.1.4). The formula's potency to smite demons and protect life and property are described at length (4.38-45, 8.43.81, 9.1.4), and the formula's primordial nature is seen as the root and summation of the belief in Ahura Mazda, \"the seed of seeds of the reckoning of the religion.\" (8.45.1)\n\nThe \"Bundahishn\", an 11th/12th century narrative of Zoroastrian cosmogonical myths, continues and embellishes the Avesta's description of the \"Ahuna Vairya\" as a primordial utterance. In that tradition, \"Ahuna Vairya\" is not only an utterance of Mazda following the creation of the spiritual world. Additionally, in \"Bundahishn\" 12.13-14, the spirit of the \"yatha ahu vairyo\" is the first manifestation of the luminaries that Ahura Mazda created, i.e. the spirit of the formula is the first of the material creations, and is at the same time the \"fire form\" force from which the material world is created. Moreover, in articulating the formula, Ahura Mazda made his ultimate triumph evident to \"the evil spirit\" (Angra Mainyu), who then fell back \"confounded and impotent as to the harm he caused the creatures of Ahuramazd\" (1.29-30).\n\nThe \"Vendidad\"'s prescription of recitation of the formula as an act of hygiene is reiterated in the \"Sayast ne Sayast\", which prescribes recitation when sneezing or coughing (12.32), and recommends invocation when pouring potable liquids (10.7). The \"Sayast ne Sayast\" additionally notes that a mumbling of the prayer is particularly offensive. (10.25) The \"Denkard\" additionally suggests the formula be uttered when entering a house (9.18.5).\n\nWhile the Avesta's \"Yasna\" 19 sees the subject of the Ahuna Vairya formula as referring to Zoroaster, and possibly to his successors, later tradition (\"Denkard\" 9.24.1, also \"Zatspram\" 1.13.19) infers no such connection, and applies it evenly to all followers of Zoroaster's teaching.\n\nLike all Gathic Avestan verses, the prayer is altogether ambiguous and translations vary significantly.\nEven though several translations and interpretations exist, the overall meaning of the prayer remains obscure. The terseness of the prose, elaborate arrangement and poetical techniques make a translation from the Old Avestan difficult (See also: difficulties in translating the Gathas). Given its syntactic density, scholarly agreement on a definitive translation, or even close approximation of its meaning, remains unlikely. Translations based on Middle Persian translations (and commentaries) of the hymn also exist and can differ greatly from those based on the Avestan original.\n\nThe version found in the Avesta edition of Geldner reads:\n\nThere are transliterations available with differences concerning certain words. \nTransliteration of Helmut Humbach:\n\nDastur Dhalla also notes that a corrupt form of the prayer is commonly used:\n\nAll translation attempts done by scholars do not give an authentic translation of the original with all its possible more deeper significance(s), because they all differ significantly.\n\nTranslation by Boyce essentially derived from that of S. Insler:\n\nA simple translation from the Zoroastrian Middle Persian by Darmesteter:\n\nA translation from the Avestan by Windfuhr:\n\nHumbach, Elefenbein and Skj√¶rv√∏ translate it as:\n\nThe essence of truth arises from the primordial nature of existence\nWield this as your tool as a king of lands\nHe is a true king who loves those whom he serves \nOther interpretations are listed in the further reading section below. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "1887751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1887751", "title": "Aristo of Chios", "text": "Aristo of Chios\n\nAristo of Chios ( \"Ariston ho Chios\"; fl. c. 260 BC) was a Stoic philosopher and colleague of Zeno of Citium. He outlined a system of Stoic philosophy that was, in many ways, closer to earlier Cynic philosophy. He rejected the logical and physical sides of philosophy endorsed by Zeno and emphasized ethics. Although agreeing with Zeno that Virtue was the supreme good, he rejected the idea that morally indifferent things such as health and wealth could be ranked according to whether they are naturally preferred. An important philosopher in his day, his views were eventually marginalized by Zeno's successors.\n\nAristo, son of Miltiades, was born on the island of Chios sometime around 300 BC. He came to Athens where he attended the lectures of Zeno of Citium, and also, for a time, the lectures of Polemo, (the head of the Academy from 314 to 269). Although he was a member of Zeno's circle he soon departed from Zeno's teachings, largely rejecting the two non-ethical parts of Stoic philosophy¬†‚Äì physics and logic¬†‚Äì endorsed by Zeno.\n\nA man of persuasive eloquence, Aristo was such a good speaker that he was called \"the Siren\". He was also called \"Phalanthus\", from his baldness. He set up his own school in the Cynosarges gymnasium (a place associated with Cynic philosophy) and attracted many pupils, so much so that when he was accused of exposing the dignity of philosophy by his freedom to all-comers, he answered, that \"he wished that Nature had given understanding to wild beasts, that they too might be capable of being his hearers.\" His followers called themselves Aristonians and included the scientist Eratosthenes and the Stoics: Apollophanes, Diphilus, and Miltiades.\n\nAristo engaged in much debate with Arcesilaus, the leader of the Academy, defending Stoic epistemology against Arcesilaus's skeptical views. On one occasion he accused Arcesilaus of being: \"Plato the head of him, Pyrrho the tail, midway Diodorus\". meaning that Arcesilaus presented himself as a Platonist, the substance of what he taught was the dialectics of Diodorus, but his actual philosophy was that of Pyrrhonism.\n\nIn his old age, he apparently lapsed from the Stoic ideal, and would at times indulge in pleasure. It is not known when he died, but he is supposed to have died from sunstroke on account of his baldness.\n\nZeno divided philosophy into three parts: Logic (which was a very wide subject including rhetoric, grammar, and the theories of perception and thought); Physics (including not just science, but the divine nature of the universe as well); and Ethics, the end goal of which was to achieve happiness through the right way of living according to Nature. It is impossible to describe in full Aristo's philosophical system because none of his writings survived intact, but from the fragments preserved by later writers, it is clear that Aristo was heavily influenced by earlier Cynic philosophy:\n\nAristo regarded Logic as unimportant, saying that it had nothing to do with us. \"Dialectic reasonings,\" he said, \"were like cobwebs, artificially constructed, but otherwise useless.\" It is unlikely that he rejected all Logic, and it is notable that Zeno, too, compared the skills of dialecticians \"to right measures that do not measure wheat or anything else worthwhile but chaff and dung.\" According to Stephen Menn, Aristo recognized the need to add somehow disposed in relation to something to the Stoic Categories.\n\nAristo also rejected Physics, saying that it was beyond us. This is reflected in his views concerning God:\nAristo holds that no form of God is conceivable, and denies him sensation, and is in a state of complete uncertainty as to whether he is, or is not, animate.\nThis was in marked opposition to Zeno to whom \"the universe was animate and possessed of reason.\" He did, however, agree with Zeno that Nature was comprehensible, arguing against the Academics. He once asked an Academic \"Do you not even see the man who is sitting next to you?\", and when the Academic replied, \"I do not,\" Aristo said: \"Who then has blinded you; who has robbed you of your eyes?\"\n\nFor Aristo, Ethics was the only true branch of philosophy, but he also limited this category, removing its practical side: advice concerning individual actions was largely useless:\nHe holds that it does not sink into the mind, having in it nothing but old wives' precepts, and that the greatest benefit is derived from the actual dogmas of philosophy and from the definition of the Supreme Good. When a man has gained a complete understanding of this definition and has thoroughly learned it, he can frame for himself a precept directing what is to be done in a given case.\nFor Aristo, only the sage makes flawless decisions and does not need advice, for everybody else with clouded minds, advice is ineffective:\nFor precepts will be of no avail while the mind is clouded with error; only when the cloud is dispersed will it be clear what one's duty is in each case. Otherwise, you will merely be showing the sick man what he ought to do if he were well, instead of making him well.\nThe purpose of life was to seek the Supreme Good, and here Aristo set up a challenge to Zeno. While agreeing with Zeno that Virtue was the supreme good, he totally rejected the idea that external advantages (health, wealth, etc.), although morally \"indifferent\", could be ranked in terms of whether they are naturally preferred or not:\nAristo of Chios denied that health, and everything similar to it, is a preferred indifferent. To call it a preferred indifferent is equivalent to judging it a good, and different practically in name alone; For without exception things indifferent as between virtue and vice have no difference at all, nor are some of them preferred by nature while others are dispreferred, but in the face of the different circumstances of the occasions, neither those said to be preferred prove to be unconditionally preferred, nor are those said to be dispreferred of necessity dispreferred; For if healthy men had to serve a tyrant and be destroyed for this reason, while the sick had to be released from the service and, therewith also, from destruction, the wise man would rather choose sickness in this circumstance than health.\nZeno would have agreed that there could be circumstances when one might choose illness for the good of the world, but for Zeno, health is a naturally preferred state; Aristo rejected this. For Aristo, not only are there times when illness might be preferred over health, (health cannot always be unconditionally preferred), but health is not even a natural advantage, and one can \"never\" assume that it is better than illness. Although the sage can (and often must) choose between various indifferent things, he should never make the error of assuming that they could be naturally preferred.\n\nFor Zeno, the chief good was to live according to Nature; for Aristo, the chief good was:\nto live in perfect indifference to all those things that are of an intermediate character between virtue and vice; making not the slightest difference between them, but regarding them all on a footing of equality. For that the wise man resembles a good actor; who, whether he is filling the part of Agamemnon or Thersites, will perform them both equally well.\nThe highest good is thus to follow virtue as the supreme good, avoid vice as the supreme evil, and to live in a state of perfect indifference towards everything else. Aristo did, however, agree with Zeno on the unity of virtue, even if it is often labelled as different things:\nAristo made virtue one thing in its essence, and called it health; but in what it is somehow related to, he made the virtues differentiated and plural, just as if one wanted to call our vision in grasping light-colored things light-sight, but dark-sight in grasping dark-colored ones. For virtue in considering things to be done and not to be done is called wisdom, but it is called temperance in bringing order to our appetites and defining what is measured and timely in pleasures, and justice in busying itself with joint enterprises and contracts with other people.\nThe problem remains of how one can achieve a virtuous state if one can not make rational choices between which things in life are preferred and dispreferred and has only an abstract goal of perfect virtue. Aristo left the question unanswered, and Cicero writing in the first century BC gave what has been the standard view of Aristo's philosophy ever since:\nFor if we maintained that all things were absolutely indifferent, the whole of life would be thrown in confusion, as it is by Aristo, and no function or task could be found for wisdom, since there would be absolutely no distinction between the things that pertain to the conduct of life, and no choice need be exercised among them.\nWhether or not this view is correct, Aristo clearly thought he was doing something more positive than playing the Cynic and trying to undermine the roots of the Stoic system:\nHe who has equipped himself for the whole of life does not need to be advised concerning each separate item, because he is now trained to meet his problem as a whole; for he knows not merely how he should live with his wife or his son, but how he should live aright.\n\nAristo came to be regarded as a marginal figure in the history of Stoicism, but in his day, he was an important philosopher whose lectures drew large crowds. Eratosthenes, who lived in Athens as a young man, claimed that Aristo and Arcesilaus were the two most important philosophers of his age. But it was the more moderate Zeno, not the radical Aristo, whose views would win out. Chrysippus, (head of the Stoic school from c. 232-c. 206 BC), systemized Stoicism along the lines set down by Zeno, and in doing so, was forced to repeatedly attack Aristo:\n\nTo maintain that the only Good is Moral Worth is to do away with the care of one's health, the management of one's estate, participation in politics, the conduct of affairs, the duties of life; nay, to abandon that Moral Worth itself, which according to you is the be-all and the end-all of existence; objections that were urged most earnestly against Aristo by Chrysippus.\nAnd yet, Aristo never quite went away, as can be seen by the repeated references to his views by later writers. By outlining a version of Stoicism rooted in Cynic philosophy, he provided fruitful food for thought for both the supporters and the opponents of Stoicism ever since.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4983309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4983309", "title": "Boleskine House", "text": "Boleskine House\n\nBoleskine House () is a manor on the south-east side of Loch Ness in the Scottish Highlands. It is notable for having been the home of author and occultist Aleister Crowley, and Led Zeppelin guitarist and producer Jimmy Page. It suffered significant fire damage in December 2015.\n\nBoleskine House is south of Inverness, on the opposite side of Loch Ness from the Meall Fuar-mhonaidh, and halfway between the villages of Foyers and Inverfarigaig.\n\nThe area has a history of strange happenings long before Aleister Crowley moved in. The parish of Boleskine was formed in the 13th Century. A Kirk and graveyard were built in the parish around this time. A succession of Ministers ran Boleskine Parish and would travel the area on horseback or on foot in all weather conditions. Minister Thomas Houston (1648-1705) was said to have had the task of hastily laying animated corpses back in their graves after a devious local wizard had raised the dead in Boleskine graveyard.\n\nBoleskine House was built on the site of the kirk, which, according to legend, caught fire during congregation and killed everyone inside. The house was constructed in the 1760s by Colonel Archibald Fraser as a hunting lodge. Colonel Archibald Fraser apparently chose the site specifically to irritate Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat in retribution for his support of the English during the Jacobite rising of 1745 as Lord Lovat's land surrounded the site of Boleskine.\n\nThe original hunting lodge was expanded continuously by the Fraser family until c. 1830. All the rooms were situated on one floor, with 4 bedrooms, a kitchen, lounge, drawing room, and a library. There is even a tunnel linking the house to the graveyard.\n\nCrowley purchased Boleskine House from the Fraser family in 1899. The House at that time was known as the Manor of Boleskine and Abertarff after the name of the local parish. Crowley believed the location was ideal to sequester himself to perform a series of operations known as the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, taken from a grimoire called \"The Book of Abramelin\".\n\nAccording to Crowley, in his book \"The Confessions of Aleister Crowley\", in order to perform the operations \"the first essential is a house in a more or less secluded situation. There should be a door opening to the north from the room of which you make your oratory. Outside this door, you construct a terrace covered with fine river sand. This ends in a 'lodge' where the spirits may congregate.\"\n\nThe purpose of this ritual is to invoke one's Guardian Angel.\n\nIt requires at least 6 months of preparation, celibacy and abstinence from alcohol. However, it also includes the summoning of the 12 Kings and Dukes of Hell, to bind them and remove their negative influences from the magician's life. Whilst Crowley was in the process of performing the lengthy ritual, he was called to Paris by the leader of the Golden Dawn. According to legend, he never banished the demons he had summoned, leading to strange happenings occurring in and around Boleskine House.\n\nCrowley became infamous for stories of conducting black magic and various other rituals while residing at the house; one of his pseudonyms was \"Lord Boleskine\". His lodge keeper, Hugh Gillies, suffered a number of personal tragedies, including the loss of two children. Crowley later claimed that his experiments with black magic had simply got out of hand.\n\nCrowley described the house as a \"long low building. I set apart the south-western half for my work. The largest room has a bow window and here I made my door and constructed the terrace and lodge. Inside the room I set up my oratory proper. This was a wooden structure, lined in part with the big mirrors which I brought from London.\"\n\nHe left the property in 1913, moving to a modest cottage for sometime in Dennyloanhead near Falkirk.\n\nAfter the First World War, Hollywood actor George Raft was involved in a scandal selling shares for a pig farm supposedly built on the grounds of Boleskine - except the farm didn't exist. After the Second World War the house was owned by a Major Edward Grant. In 1965, Grant committed suicide in Crowley's bedroom with a shotgun.\n\nAfter this a newly married couple moved into the house. The wife was blind, and after a month the man walked out, leaving the woman wandering around unable to see. In 1969 Kenneth Anger, an experimental filmmaker with an interest in the occult, learned that the house was on the market and rented it for a few months. When Jimmy Page heard about this, he bought the house in 1970.\n\nJimmy Page was a collector of Crowley memorabilia who \"had read a lot of Crowley and¬†... was fascinated by his ideas\". At the time Page bought the house it was in a state of decay, but he felt it would be a good atmosphere in which to write songs. However, after arranging for the house to be restored he spent little time at Boleskine, leaving things in the care of his friend Malcolm Dent (1944-2011).\n\nWhen asked why he was chosen, Dent explained \"Jimmy Page caught me at a time in my life when I wasn't doing a great deal and asked me to come up and run the place. I never did establish why he fixed on me.\" When Dent moved into the house \"it was a wreck ... It had been more or less abandoned. There'd been at least one fire there, parts of the building were missing and it had been badly patched up. The grounds, which at one time had been very nicely laid out were gone to hell\".\n\nAlthough Dent was a sceptic of the paranormal he soon started to experience strange occurrences. After a few weeks, he heard strange rumblings from the hallway which stopped when he investigated, but resumed after he closed the bedroom door. After researching the house he discovered the rumbling in the hall was supposedly the head of Lord Lovat, even though he was executed in London. Dent explains \"above Boleskine there's a place called Errogie which is supposed to be the geographical centre of the Highlands. Boleskine was then the nearest consecrated ground to Errogie and it's thought his soul, or part of it, ended here.\"\n\nDent also experienced the \"most terrifying night of my life\" at Boleskine. He awoke one night to hear what sounded like a wild animal snorting and banging outside his bedroom door. It went on for some time and it wasn't until morning that Dent dared open the door, and there was nothing there. Dent added \"whatever was there was pure evil.\" Another friend who stayed at Boleskine awoke one night claiming she had been attacked by \"some kind of devil\". Other occurrences, such as chairs switching places, doors slamming open and closed for no reason and carpets and rugs rolling up inexplicably, failed to deter Dent from staying. Dent met his wife at Boleskine and raised his family there.\n\nAlthough Jimmy Page never spent a great length of time there, he did everything he could to return the house to how it would have looked during Crowley's ownership. For example, he commissioned an artist, Charles Pace, to paint some Crowley-esque murals on the walls. These were based on the murals in Crowley's Abbey of Thelema in Sicily discovered by Kenneth Anger in 1955.\n\nThe house was put on the market for ¬£250,000 in 1991. It was purchased by Ronald and Annette MacGillivray in 1992. According to Mrs. MacGillivray, when they bought the house it was in a very bad state. The MacGillivrays \"spent a lot of money stripping it back to the bare walls and re-roofing it. It had four bedrooms, four bathrooms, a huge drawing room, dining room, library and various smaller rooms\". The house was then converted into a hotel.\n\nRonald MacGillivray died in 2002. He was said to hate any reference to the house's dark past when it was home to Crowley.\n\nWhen asked whether she had experienced any mysterious occurrences at Boleskine House, his wife states that she experienced‚Äî \"absolutely none. I am a non-believer and didn't listen to all that rubbish. We had a great time there.\"\n\nFollowing Ronald MacGillivray's death, Boleskine House was put up for sale again. The new Dutch owners, who have remained anonymous, converted the house back into a private residence and used it as a holiday home.\n\nIn 2009, a plot on the former estate was put on the market for ¬£176,000 with plans to build a three-bedroom log house. The sale also included of foreshore on Loch Ness.\n\nAt approximately 1:40¬†pm on 23 December 2015, a motorist on the A82 road reported flames and smoke coming from Boleskine House. When fire crews attended, it is estimated up to 60 per cent of the building had already been incinerated, with flames rising up to high. The fire reportedly started in the kitchen of the building. The firefighters concentrated on the west wing of the house, as the rest of the building had been severely damaged.\n\nThe owner's partner and daughter had gone shopping and returned to find the house ablaze. The fire was thought to have started in the kitchen, however nobody was believed to be in the house at the time of the fire and there were no casualties.\n\nThe interior of the house was almost totally destroyed by the fire. Part of the roof and the outer walls survive, but the former owner, Mrs. MacGillivray, has said that since the extent of the damage is so bad it \"is unlikely it will ever be rebuilt unless there is someone out there with an interest in the occult wanting to spend a lot of money.\" It is believed that the house was due to go on the market.\n\nBoleskine House is a Category B listed building, as is the adjacent stables and gate lodge.\n\nBoleskine House is described and recognisable in W. Somerset Maugham's \"The Magician\" where it is called \"Skene\". Crowley considered Maugham's book to be plagiarism and wrote an article under the name of Oliver Haddo (the name of a character taken from Maugham's book) for \"Vanity Fair\" as a witty riposte. (For details, see Crowley's autobiography, \"Confessions\", listed above.)\n\n\n"}

The report is meant to assess the views of Sikhs living in the UK and to provide this information to the government, non-governmental organisations, companies and other groups. It is one of the largest projects to study the needs and wants of Sikhs in the UK.\n\nThe BSR was founded by Jasvir Singh in 2012 and is created annually by a team of research analysts, lawyers, academics, social workers, senior consultants and managers who work on the BSR on a voluntary basis. The Editor of the report is Jagdev Singh Virdee MBE who is a British statistician. The report takes approximately 500 man hours and costs ¬£30,000 to create every year. The purpose of BSR is to \"identify the needs and wants of the 432,000 strong Sikh population in the UK.\" The BSR is \"one of the few large-scale surveys undertaken of Britain's Sikhs\" and it is one of the largest projects to study this group of people in the country.\n\nBSR is launched annually in Parliament. The report has been quoted in the British Parliament, referred to in pieces of research and white papers relating to Sikhs or faith in general, and used by public bodies, the corporate sector and third sector groups. The report is also meant to help other non-Sikh organisations better work with Sikhs in the UK. The BSR fills a gap in information relating to modern Sikhs in Britain.\n\nThe report, which focuses on the views of Sikhs living in Britain, is organized into several sections including an introduction, review of relevant literature, research methodology and then goes into the selected feedback areas. The report also addresses recommendations for areas in people's lives that need improvement. BSR has focused on different subjects over the last few years. In 2018, the focus of the report was mental health which has subsequently led to a new generation of Sikhs more open to discussions and leading the dialogue regarding mental health within the British Sikh Community. \n\nIn the first year, the respondents were selected through an online study, which the BSR acknowledged as being skewed towards those who have internet access. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "3267529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3267529", "title": "Buddhism", "text": "Buddhism\n\nBuddhism (, ) is the world's fourth-largest religion with over 520 million followers, or over 7% of the global population, known as \"Buddhists\".\nAn Indian religion, Buddhism encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on original teachings attributed to the Buddha and resulting interpreted philosophies. Buddhism originated in ancient India as a Sramana tradition sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, spreading through much of Asia. Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars: Theravada (Pali: \"The School of the Elders\") and Mahayana (Sanskrit: \"The Great Vehicle\").\n\nAll Buddhist traditions share the goal of overcoming suffering and the cycle of death and rebirth, either by the attainment of Nirvana or through the path of Buddhahood. Buddhist schools vary in their interpretation of the path to liberation, the relative importance and canonicity assigned to the various Buddhist texts, and their specific teachings and practices. Widely observed practices include taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha, observance of moral precepts, monasticism, meditation, and the cultivation of the Paramitas (virtues).\n\nTheravada Buddhism has a widespread following in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. Mahayana, which includes the traditions of Pure Land, Zen, Nichiren Buddhism, Shingon and Tiantai (Tendai), is found throughout East Asia.\n\nVajrayana, a body of teachings attributed to Indian adepts, may be viewed as a separate branch or as an aspect of Mahayana Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhism, which preserves the Vajrayana teachings of eighth-century India, is practiced in the countries of the Himalayan region, Mongolia, and Kalmykia.\n\nBuddhism is an Indian religion attributed to the teachings of the Buddha, supposedly born SiddhƒÅrtha Gautama, and also known as the \"TathƒÅgata\" (\"thus-gone\") and \"Sakyamuni\" (\"sage of the Sakyas\"). Early texts have his personal name as \"Gautama\" or \"Gotama\" (Pali) without any mention of \"SiddhƒÅrtha,\" (\"Achieved the Goal\") which appears to have been a kind of honorific title when it does appear. The details of Buddha's life are mentioned in many Early Buddhist Texts but are inconsistent, and his social background and life details are difficult to prove, the precise dates uncertain.\n\nThe evidence of the early texts suggests that he was born as SiddhƒÅrtha Gautama in Lumbini and grew up in Kapilavasthu, a town in the plains region of the modern Nepal-India border, and that he spent his life in what is now modern Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Some hagiographic legends state that his father was a king named Suddhodana, his mother was queen Maya, and he was born in Lumbini gardens. However, scholars such as Richard Gombrich consider this a dubious claim because a combination of evidence suggests he was born in the \"Shakyas\" community ‚Äì one that later gave him the title \"Shakyamuni\", and the \"Shakya\" community was governed by a small oligarchy or republic-like council where there were no ranks but where seniority mattered instead. Some of the stories about Buddha, his life, his teachings, and claims about the society he grew up in may have been invented and interpolated at a later time into the Buddhist texts.\n\nAccording to the Buddhist sutras, Gautama was moved by the innate suffering of humanity and its endless repetition due to rebirth. He set out on a quest to end this repeated suffering. Early Buddhist canonical texts and early biographies of Gautama state that Gautama first studied under Vedic teachers, namely Alara Kalama (Sanskrit: Arada Kalama) and Uddaka Ramaputta (Sanskrit: Udraka Ramaputra), learning meditation and ancient philosophies, particularly the concept of \"nothingness, emptiness\" from the former, and \"what is neither seen nor unseen\" from the latter.\n\nFinding these teachings to be insufficient to attain his goal, he turned to the practice of asceticism. This too fell short of attaining his goal, and then he turned to the practice of \"dhyana\", meditation, which he had already discovered in his youth. He famously sat in meditation under a \"Ficus religiosa\" tree now called the Bodhi Tree in the town of Bodh Gaya in the Gangetic plains region of South Asia. He gained insight into the workings of karma and his former lives, and attained enlightenment, certainty about the Middle Way (Skt. \"madhyamƒÅ-pratipad\") as the right path of spiritual practice to end suffering (\"dukkha\") from rebirths in Sa·πÉsƒÅra.\nAs a fully enlightened Buddha (Skt. \"\"), he attracted followers and founded a \"Sangha\" (monastic order). Now, as the Buddha, he spent the rest of his life teaching the Dharma he had discovered, and died at the age of 80 in Kushinagar, India.\nBuddha's teachings were propagated by his followers, which in the last centuries of the 1st millennium BCE became over 18 Buddhist sub-schools of thought, each with its own basket of texts containing different interpretations and authentic teachings of the Buddha; these over time evolved into many traditions of which the more well known and widespread in the modern era are Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism.\n\nThe Four Truths express the basic orientation of Buddhism: we crave and cling to impermanent states and things, which is dukkha, \"incapable of satisfying\" and painful. This keeps us caught in sa·πÉsƒÅra, the endless cycle of repeated rebirth, dukkha and dying again.\nBut there is a way to liberation from this endless cycle to the state of nirvana, namely following the Noble Eightfold Path.\n\nThe truth of \"dukkha\" is the basic insight that life in this mundane world, with its clinging and craving to impermanent states and things is \"dukkha\", and unsatisfactory. \"Dukkha\" can be translated as \"incapable of satisfying,\" \"the unsatisfactory nature and the general insecurity of all conditioned phenomena\"; or \"painful.\" \"Dukkha\" is most commonly translated as \"suffering,\" but this is inaccurate, since it refers not to episodic suffering, but to the intrinsically unsatisfactory nature of temporary states and things, including pleasant but temporary experiences. We expect happiness from states and things which are impermanent, and therefore cannot attain real happiness.\n\nIn Buddhism, dukkha is one of the three marks of existence, along with impermanence and anattƒÅ (non-self). Buddhism, like other major Indian religions, asserts that everything is impermanent (anicca), but, unlike them, also asserts that there is no permanent self or soul in living beings (\"anattƒÅ\"). The ignorance or misperception (\"avijjƒÅ\") that anything is permanent or that there is self in any being is considered a wrong understanding, and the primary source of clinging and dukkha.\n\n\"Dukkha\" arises when we crave (Pali: \"tanha\") and cling to these changing phenomena. The clinging and craving produces karma, which ties us to samsara, the round of death and rebirth. Craving includes \"kama-tanha\", craving for sense-pleasures; \"bhava-tanha\", craving to continue the cycle of life and death, including rebirth; and \"vibhava-tanha\", craving to not experience the world and painful feelings.\n\n\"Dukkha\" ceases, or can be confined, when craving and clinging cease or are confined. This also means that no more karma is being produced, and rebirth ends. Cessation is \"nirvana\", \"blowing out,\" and peace of mind.\n\nBy following the Buddhist path to \"moksha\", liberation, one starts to disengage from craving and clinging to impermanent states and things. The term \"path\" is usually taken to mean the Noble Eightfold Path, but other versions of \"the path\" can also be found in the Nikayas. The Theravada tradition regards insight into the four truths as liberating in itself.\n\n\"Sa·πÉsƒÅra\" means \"wandering\" or \"world\", with the connotation of cyclic, circuitous change. It refers to the theory of rebirth and \"cyclicality of all life, matter, existence\", a fundamental assumption of Buddhism, as with all major Indian religions. Samsara in Buddhism is considered to be \"dukkha\", unsatisfactory and painful, perpetuated by desire and \"avidya\" (ignorance), and the resulting karma.\n\nThe theory of rebirths, and realms in which these rebirths can occur, is extensively developed in Buddhism, in particular Tibetan Buddhism with its wheel of existence (\"Bhavacakra\") doctrine. Liberation from this cycle of existence, \"nirvana\", has been the foundation and the most important historical justification of Buddhism.\n\nThe later Buddhist texts assert that rebirth can occur in six realms of existence, namely three good realms (heavenly, demi-god, human) and three evil realms (animal, hungry ghosts, hellish). Samsara ends if a person attains nirvana, the \"blowing out\" of the desires and the gaining of true insight into impermanence and non-self reality.\n\nRebirth refers to a process whereby beings go through a succession of lifetimes as one of many possible forms of sentient life, each running from conception to death. In Buddhist thought, this rebirth does not involve any soul, because of its doctrine of anattƒÅ (Sanskrit: \"anƒÅtman\", no-self doctrine) which rejects the concepts of a permanent self or an unchanging, eternal soul, as it is called in Hinduism and Christianity. According to Buddhism there ultimately is no such thing as a self in any being or any essence in any thing.\n\nThe Buddhist traditions have traditionally disagreed on what it is in a person that is reborn, as well as how quickly the rebirth occurs after each death. Some Buddhist traditions assert that \"no self\" doctrine means that there is no perduring self, but there is \"avacya\" (inexpressible) self which migrates from one life to another. The majority of Buddhist traditions, in contrast, assert that vij√±ƒÅna (a person's consciousness) though evolving, exists as a continuum and is the mechanistic basis of what undergoes rebirth, rebecoming and redeath. The rebirth depends on the merit or demerit gained by one's karma, as well as that accrued on one's behalf by a family member.\n\nEach rebirth takes place within one of five realms according to Theravadins, or six according to other schools ‚Äì heavenly, demi-gods, humans, animals, hungry ghosts and hellish.\n\nIn East Asian and Tibetan Buddhism, rebirth is not instantaneous, and there is an intermediate state (Tibetan \"bardo\") between one life and the next. The orthodox Theravada position rejects the wait, and asserts that rebirth of a being is immediate. However there are passages in the \"Samyutta Nikaya\" of the Pali Canon that seem to lend support to the idea that the Buddha taught about an intermediate stage between one life and the next.\n\nIn Buddhism, karma (from Sanskrit: \"action, work\") drives sa·πÉsƒÅra ‚Äì the endless cycle of suffering and rebirth for each being. Good, skilful deeds (Pali: \"kusala\") and bad, unskilful deeds (PƒÅli: \"akusala\") produce \"seeds\" in the unconscious receptacle (\"ƒÅlaya\") that mature later either in this life or in a subsequent rebirth. The existence of karma is a core belief in Buddhism, as with all major Indian religions, it implies neither fatalism nor that everything that happens to a person is caused by karma.\n\nA central aspect of Buddhist theory of karma is that intent (cetanƒÅ) matters and is essential to bring about a consequence or \"phala\" \"fruit\" or vipƒÅka \"result\". However, good or bad karma accumulates even if there is no physical action, and just having ill or good thoughts create karmic seeds; thus, actions of body, speech or mind all lead to karmic seeds. In the Buddhist traditions, life aspects affected by the law of karma in past and current births of a being include the form of rebirth, realm of rebirth, social class, character and major circumstances of a lifetime. It operates like the laws of physics, without external intervention, on every being in all six realms of existence including human beings and gods.\n\nA notable aspect of the karma theory in Buddhism is merit transfer. A person accumulates merit not only through intentions and ethical living, but also is able to gain merit from others by exchanging goods and services, such as through \"dƒÅna\" (charity to monks or nuns). Further, a person can transfer one's own good karma to living family members and ancestors.\n\nThe cessation of the \"kleshas\" and the attainment of nirvana (\"nibbƒÅna\"), with which the cycle of rebirth ends, has been the primary and the soteriological goal of the Buddhist path for monastic life since the time of the Buddha. The term \"path\" is usually taken to mean the Noble Eightfold Path, but other versions of \"the path\" can also be found in the Nikayas. In some passages in the Pali Canon, a distinction is being made between right knowledge or insight (\"sammƒÅ-√±ƒÅ·πáa\"), and right liberation or release (\"sammƒÅ-vimutti\"), as the means to attain cessation and liberation.\n\nNirvana literally means \"blowing out, quenching, becoming extinguished\". In early Buddhist texts, it is the state of restraint and self-control that leads to the \"blowing out\" and the ending of the cycles of sufferings associated with rebirths and redeaths. Many later Buddhist texts describe nirvana as identical with \"anatta\" with complete \"emptiness, nothingness\". In some texts, the state is described with greater detail, such as passing through the gate of emptiness (\"sunyata\") ‚Äì realizing that there is no soul or self in any living being, then passing through the gate of signlessness (\"animitta\") ‚Äì realizing that nirvana cannot be perceived, and finally passing through the gate of wishlessness (\"apranihita\") ‚Äì realizing that nirvana is the state of not even wishing for nirvana.\n\nThe nirvana state has been described in Buddhist texts partly in a manner similar to other Indian religions, as the state of complete liberation, enlightenment, highest happiness, bliss, fearlessness, freedom, permanence, non-dependent origination, unfathomable, and indescribable. It has also been described in part differently, as a state of spiritual release marked by \"emptiness\" and realization of \"non-self\".\n\nWhile Buddhism considers the liberation from sa·πÉsƒÅra as the ultimate spiritual goal, in traditional practice, the primary focus of a vast majority of lay Buddhists has been to seek and accumulate merit through good deeds, donations to monks and various Buddhist rituals in order to gain better rebirths rather than nirvana.\n\nWhile the Noble Eightfold Path is best-known in the west, a wide variety of practices and stages have been used and described in the Buddhist traditions. Basic practices include \"sila\" (ethics), \"samadhi\" (meditation, \"dhyana\") and \"prajna\" (wisdom), as described in the Noble Eightfold Path. An important additional practice is a kind and compassionate attitude toward every living being and the world. Devotion is also important in some Buddhist traditions, and in the Tibetan traditions visualizations of deities and mandalas are important. The value of textual study is regarded differently in the various Buddhist traditions. It is central to Theravada and highly important to Tibetan Buddhism, while the Zen tradition takes an ambiguous stance.\n\nTraditionally, the first step in most Buddhist schools requires taking Three Refuges, also called the Three Jewels (Sanskrit: \"triratna\", Pali: \"tiratana\") as the foundation of one's religious practice. Pali texts employ the Brahmanical motif of the triple refuge, found in the \"Rigveda\" 9.97.47, \"Rigveda\" 6.46.9 and \"Chandogya Upanishad\" 2.22.3‚Äì4. Tibetan Buddhism sometimes adds a fourth refuge, in the \"lama\". The three refuges are believed by Buddhists to be protective and a form of reverence.\n\nThe Three Jewels are:\n\nReciting the three refuges is considered in Buddhism not as a place to hide, rather a thought that purifies, uplifts and strengthens.\n\nAn important guiding principle of Buddhist practice is the Middle Way (\"madhyamapratipad\"). It was a part of Buddha's first sermon, where he presented the Noble Eightfold Path that was a 'middle way' between the extremes of asceticism and hedonistic sense pleasures. In Buddhism, states Harvey, the doctrine of \"dependent arising\" (conditioned arising, \"pratƒ´tyasamutpƒÅda\") to explain rebirth is viewed as the 'middle way' between the doctrines that a being has a \"permanent soul\" involved in rebirth (eternalism) and \"death is final and there is no rebirth\" (annihilationism).\n\nIn the Theravada canon, the Pali-suttas, various often irreconcilable sequences can be found. According to Carol Anderson, the Theravada canon lacks \"an overriding and comprehensive structure of the path to \"nibbana\".\" Nevertheless, the Noble Eightfold Path, or \"Eightfold Path of the Noble Ones\", has become an important description of the Buddhist path. It consists of a set of eight interconnected factors or conditions, that when developed together, lead to the cessation of dukkha. These eight factors are: Right View (or Right Understanding), Right Intention (or Right Thought), Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration.\n\nThis Eightfold Path is the fourth of the Four Noble Truths, and asserts the path to the cessation of \"dukkha\" (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness). The path teaches that the way of the enlightened ones stopped their craving, clinging and karmic accumulations, and thus ended their endless cycles of rebirth and suffering.\n\nThe Noble Eightfold Path is grouped into three basic divisions, as follows:\n\nMahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism is based principally upon the path of a Bodhisattva. A \"Bodhisattva\" refers to one who is on the path to buddhahood. The term \"MahƒÅyƒÅna\" was originally a synonym for \"BodhisattvayƒÅna\" or \"Bodhisattva Vehicle.\"\n\nIn the earliest texts of Mahayana Buddhism, the path of a bodhisattva was to awaken the \"bodhicitta\". Between the 1st and 3rd century CE, this tradition introduced the \"Ten Bhumi\" doctrine, which means ten levels or stages of awakening. This development was followed by the acceptance that it is impossible to achieve Buddhahood in one (current) lifetime, and the best goal is not nirvana for oneself, but Buddhahood after climbing through the ten levels during multiple rebirths. Mahayana scholars then outlined an elaborate path, for monks and laypeople, and the path includes the vow to help teach Buddhist knowledge to other beings, so as to help them cross samsara and liberate themselves, once one reaches the Buddhahood in a future rebirth. One part of this path are the \"PƒÅramitƒÅ\" (perfections, to cross over), derived from the \"Jatakas\" tales of Buddha's numerous rebirths.\n\nThe Mahayana texts are inconsistent in their discussion of the \"Paramitas\", and some texts include lists of two, others four, six, ten and fifty-two. The six paramitas have been most studied, and these are:\n\nIn Mahayana Sutras that include ten \"Paramitas\", the additional four perfections are \"skillful means, vow, power and knowledge\". The most discussed \"Paramita\" and the highest rated perfection in Mahayana texts is the \"Prajna-paramita\", or the \"perfection of insight\". This insight in the Mahayana tradition, states Sh≈çhei Ichimura, has been the \"insight of non-duality or the absence of reality in all things\".\n\n\"≈öƒ´la\" (Sanskrit) or \"sƒ´la\" (PƒÅli) is the concept of \"moral virtues\", that is the second group and an integral part of the Noble Eightfold Path. It consists of right speech, right action and right livelihood.\n\n\"≈öƒ´la\" appear as ethical precepts for both lay and ordained Buddhist devotees. It includes the Five Precepts for laypeople, Eight or Ten Precepts for monastic life, as well as rules of Dhamma (\"Vinaya\" or \"Patimokkha\") adopted by a monastery.\n\nBuddhist scriptures explain the five precepts (; ) as the minimal standard of Buddhist morality. It is the most important system of morality in Buddhism, together with the monastic rules. The five precepts apply to both male and female devotees, and these are:\n\n\nUndertaking and upholding the five precepts is based on the principle of non-harming (PƒÅli and ). The Pali Canon recommends one to compare oneself with others, and on the basis of that, not to hurt others. Compassion and a belief in karmic retribution form the foundation of the precepts. Undertaking the five precepts is part of regular lay devotional practice, both at home and at the local temple. However, the extent to which people keep them differs per region and time. They are sometimes referred to as the \"≈õrƒÅvakayƒÅna precepts\" in the MahƒÅyƒÅna tradition, contrasting them with the \"bodhisattva\" precepts.\n\nThe five precepts are not commandments and transgressions do not invite religious sanctions, but their power has been based on the Buddhist belief in karmic consequences and their impact in the afterlife. Killing in Buddhist belief leads to rebirth in the hell realms, and for a longer time in more severe conditions if the murder victim was a monk. Adultery, similarly, invites a rebirth as prostitute or in hell, depending on whether the partner was unmarried or married. These moral precepts have been voluntarily self-enforced in lay Buddhist culture through the associated belief in karma and rebirth. Within the Buddhist doctrine, the precepts are meant to develop mind and character to make progress on the path to enlightenment.\nThe monastic life in Buddhism has additional precepts as part of \"patimokkha\", and unlike lay people, transgressions by monks do invite sanctions. Full expulsion from \"sangha\" follows any instance of killing, engaging in sexual intercourse, theft or false claims about one's knowledge. Temporary expulsion follows a lesser offence. The sanctions vary per monastic fraternity (\"nikaya\").\n\nLay people and novices in many Buddhist fraternities also uphold eight (\"asta shila\") or ten (\"das shila\") from time to time. Four of these are same as for the lay devotee: no killing, no stealing, no lying, and no intoxicants. The other four precepts are:\n\nAll eight precepts are sometimes observed by lay people on \"uposatha\" days: full moon, new moon , the first and last quarter following the lunar calendar. The ten precepts also include to abstain from accepting money.\n\nIn addition to these precepts, Buddhist monasteries have hundreds of rules of conduct, which are a part of its \"patimokkha\".\n\nVinaya is the specific code of conduct for a \"sangha\" of monks or nuns. It includes the Patimokkha, a set of 227 offences including 75 rules of decorum for monks, along with penalties for transgression, in the Theravadin tradition. The precise content of the \"Vinaya Pitaka\" (scriptures on the Vinaya) differs in different schools and tradition, and different monasteries set their own standards on its implementation. The list of \"pattimokkha\" is recited every fortnight in a ritual gathering of all monks. Buddhist text with vinaya rules for monasteries have been traced in all Buddhist traditions, with the oldest surviving being the ancient Chinese translations.\n\nMonastic communities in the Buddhist tradition cut normal social ties to family and community, and live as \"islands unto themselves\". Within a monastic fraternity, a \"sangha\" has its own rules. A monk abides by these institutionalized rules, and living life as the vinaya prescribes it is not merely a means, but very nearly the end in itself. Transgressions by a monk on \"Sangha\" vinaya rules invites enforcement, which can include temporary or permanent expulsion.\n\nA wide range of meditation practices has developed in the Buddhist traditions, but \"meditation\" primarily refers to the practice of \"dhyana\" c.q. \"jhana\". It is a practice in which the attention of the mind is first narrowed to the focus on one specific object, such as the breath, a concrete object, or a specific thought, mental image or mantra. After this initial focussing of the mind, the focus is coupled to mindfulness, maintaining a calm mind while being aware of one's surroundings. The practice of \"dhyana\" aids in maintaining a calm mind, and avoiding disturbance of this calm mind by mindfulness of disturbing thoughts and feelings.\n\nThe earliest evidence of yogis and their meditative tradition, states Karel Werner, is found in the Ke≈õin hymn 10.136 of the Rigveda. While evidence suggests meditation was practised in the centuries preceding the Buddha, the meditative methodologies described in the Buddhist texts are some of the earliest among texts that have survived into the modern era. These methodologies likely incorporate what existed before the Buddha as well as those first developed within Buddhism.\n\nAccording to Bronkhorst, the \"Four Dhyanas\" was a Buddhist invention. Bronkhorst notes that the Buddhist canon has a mass of contradictory statements, little is known about their relative chronology, and \"there can be no doubt that the canon ‚Äì including the older parts, the Sutra and Vinaya Pitaka ‚Äì was composed over a long period of time\". Meditative practices were incorporated from other sramanic movements; the Buddhist texts describe how Buddha learnt the practice of the formless dhyana from Brahmanical practices, in the Nikayas ascribed to Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta. The Buddhist canon also describes and criticizes alternative dhyana practices, which likely mean the pre-existing mainstream meditation practices of Jainism and Hinduism.\n\nBuddha added a new focus and interpretation, particularly through the Four Dhyanas methodology, in which mindfulness is maintained. Further, the focus of meditation and the underlying theory of liberation guiding the meditation has been different in Buddhism. For example, states Bronkhorst, the verse 4.4.23 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad with its \"become calm, subdued, quiet, patiently enduring, concentrated, one sees soul in oneself\" is most probably a meditative state. The Buddhist discussion of meditation is without the concept of soul and the discussion criticizes both the ascetic meditation of Jainism and the \"real self, soul\" meditation of Hinduism.\n\nFor Nirvana, Buddhist texts teach various meditation methodologies, of which \"rupa-jhana\" (four meditations in the realm of form) and \"arupa-jhana\" (four meditations in the formless realm) have been the most studied. These are described in the Pali Canon as trance-like states in the world of desirelessness. The four dhyanas under \"rupa-jhanas\" are:\n\nThe \"arupa-jhanas\" (formless realm meditation) are also four, which are entered by those who have mastered the \"rupa-jhanas\" (Arhats). The first formless dhyana gets to infinite space without form or colour or shape, the second to infinity of perception base of the infinite space, the third formless dhyana transcends object-subject perception base, while the fourth is where he dwells in nothing-at-all where there are no feelings, no ideas, nor are there non-ideas, unto total cessation. The four \"rupa-dhyanas\" in Buddhist practice lead to rebirth in successfully better \"rupa\" Brahma heavenly realms, while \"arupa-dhyanas\" lead into arupa heavens.\n\nRichard Gombrich notes that the sequence of the four \"rupa-jhanas\" describes two different cognitive states. The first two describe a narrowing of attention, while in the third and fourth jhana attention is expanded again. Alexander Wynne further explains that the \"dhyana\"-scheme is poorly understood. According to Wynne, words expressing the inculcation of awareness, such as \"sati\", \"sampajƒÅno\", and \"upekkhƒÅ\", are mistranslated or understood as particular factors of meditative states, whereas they refer to a particular way of perceiving the sense objects.\n\nThe Buddhist tradition has incorporated two traditions regarding the use of dhyƒÅna (meditation, Pali \"jhƒÅna\"). There is a tradition that stresses attaining praj√±ƒÅ (insight, bodhi, kensh≈ç, vipassana) as the means to awakening and liberation. But it has also incorporated the yogic tradition, as reflected in the use of jhana, which is rejected in other sutras as not resulting in the final result of liberation. Lambert Schmithausen, a professor of Buddhist Studies, discerns three possible roads to liberation as described in the suttas, to which Vetter adds the sole practice of \"dhyana\" itself. According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, the earliest Buddhist path consisted of a set of practices which culminate in the practice of \"dhyana\", leading to a calm of mind which according to Vetter \"is\" the liberation which is being sought. Frauwallner notes that the Buddha regarded \"tanha\", \"thirst,\" craving, to be the cause of suffering, not ignorance. But this was in contradiction to the Indian traditions of the time, and posed a problem, which was then also incorporated into the Buddhis teachings. Later on, \"liberating insight\" came to be regarded as equally liberating. This \"liberating insight\" came to be exemplified by \"prajna\", or the insight in the \"four truths,\" but also by other elements of the Buddhist teachings.\n\nThe four immeasurables or four abodes, also called \"Brahma-viharas\", are virtues or directions for meditation in Buddhist traditions, which helps a person be reborn in the heavenly (Brahma) realm. These are traditionally believed to be a characteristic of the deity Brahma and the heavenly abode he resides in.\n\nThe four \"Brahma-vihara\" are:\n\nAccording to Peter Harvey, the Buddhist scriptures acknowledge that the four \"Brahmavihara\" meditation practices \"did not originate within the Buddhist tradition\". The Brahmavihara (sometimes as Brahmaloka), along with the tradition of meditation and the above four immeasurables are found in pre-Buddha and post-Buddha Vedic and Sramanic literature. Aspects of the Brahmavihara practice for rebirths into the heavenly realm have been an important part of Buddhist meditation tradition.\n\nAccording to Gombrich, the Buddhist usage of the \"brahma-vihƒÅra\" originally referred to an awakened state of mind, and a concrete attitude toward other beings which was equal to \"living with Brahman\" here and now. The later tradition took those descriptions too literally, linking them to cosmology and understanding them as \"living with Brahman\" by rebirth in the Brahma-world. According to Gombrich, \"the Buddha taught that kindness ‚Äì what Christians tend to call love ‚Äì was a way to salvation.\"\n\nIdols of deity and icons have been a part of the historic practice, and in Buddhist texts such as the 11th-century \"Sadanamala\", a devotee visualizes and identifies himself or herself with the imagined deity as part of meditation. This has been particularly popular in Vajrayana meditative traditions, but also found in Mahayana and Theravada traditions, particularly in temples and with Buddha images.\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhism tradition, mandala are mystical maps for the visualization process with cosmic symbolism. There are numerous deities, each with a mandala, and they are used during initiation ceremonies and meditation. The mandalas are concentric geometric shapes symbolizing layers of the external world, gates and sacred space. The meditation deity is in the centre, sometimes surrounded by protective gods and goddesses. Visualizations with deities and mandalas in Buddhism is a tradition traceable to ancient times, and likely well established by the time the 5th-century text \"Visuddhimagga\" was composed.\n\nAccording to Peter Harvey, whenever Buddhism has been healthy, not only ordained but also more committed lay people have practised formal meditation. Loud devotional chanting however, adds Harvey, has been the most prevalent Buddhist practice and considered a form of meditation that produces \"energy, joy, lovingkindness and calm\", purifies mind and benefits the chanter.\n\nThroughout most of Buddhist history, meditation has been primarily practised in Buddhist monastic tradition, and historical evidence suggests that serious meditation by lay people has been an exception. In recent history, sustained meditation has been pursued by a minority of monks in Buddhist monasteries. Western interest in meditation has led to a revival where ancient Buddhist ideas and precepts are adapted to Western mores and interpreted liberally, presenting Buddhism as a meditation-based form of spirituality.\n\n\"Praj√±ƒÅ\" (Sanskrit) or \"pa√±√±ƒÅ\" (PƒÅli) is insight or knowledge of the true nature of existence. The Buddhist tradition regards ignorance (avidyƒÅ), a fundamental ignorance, misunderstanding or mis-perception of the nature of reality, as one of the basic causes of \"dukkha\" and \"samsara\". By overcoming ignorance or misunderstanding one is enlightened and liberated. This overcoming includes awakening to impermanence and the non-self nature of reality, and this develops dispassion for the objects of clinging, and liberates a being from \"dukkha\" and \"sa·πÉsƒÅra\". \"Praj√±ƒÅ\" is important in all Buddhist traditions, and is the wisdom about the dharmas, functioning of karma and rebirths, realms of samsara, impermanence of everything, no-self in anyone or anything, and dependent origination.\n\nThe origins of \"liberating insight\" are unclear. Buddhist texts, states Bronkhorst, do not describe it explicitly, and the content of \"liberating insight\" is likely not original to Buddhism. According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, this growing importance of \"liberating insight\" was a response to other religious groups in India, which held that a liberating insight was indispensable for \"moksha\", liberation from rebirth.\n\nBronkhorst suggests that the conception of what exactly constituted \"liberating insight\" for Buddhists developed over time. Whereas originally it may not have been specified as an insight, later on the Four Noble Truths served as such, to be superseded by \"pratityasamutpada\", and still later, in the Hinayana schools, by the doctrine of the non-existence of a substantial self or person.\nIn the Pali Canon liberating insight is attained in the fourth dhyana. However, states Vetter, modern scholarship on the Pali Canon has uncovered a \"whole series of inconsistencies in the transmission of the Buddha's word\", and there are many conflicting versions of what constitutes higher knowledge and samadhi that leads to the liberation from rebirth and suffering. Even within the Four Dhyana methodology of meditation, Vetter notes that \"penetrating abstract truths and penetrating them successively does not seem possible in a state of mind which is without contemplation and reflection.\" According to Vetter, \"dhyƒÅna\" itself constituted the original \"liberating practice\".\n\nCarol Anderson notes that insight is often depicted in the Vinaya as the opening of the Dhamma eye, which sets one on the Buddhist path to liberation.\n\nIn Theravada Buddhism, but also in Tibetan Buddhism, two types of meditation Buddhist practices are being followed, namely samatha (PƒÅli; Sanskrit: \"≈õamatha\"; \"calm\") and vipassana (insight). Samatha is also called \"calming meditation\", and was adopted into Buddhism from pre-Buddha Indian traditions. \"VipassanƒÅ\" meditation was added by Buddha, and refers to \"insight meditation\". Vipassana does not aim at peace and tranquillity, states Damien Keown, but \"the generation of penetrating and critical insight (panna)\".\n\nThe focus of Vipassana meditation is to continuously and thoroughly know impermanence of everything (\"annica\"), no-Self in anything (\"anatta\") and the \"dukkha\" teachings of Buddhism.\n\nContemporary Theravada orthodoxy regards samatha as a preparation for vipassanƒÅ, pacifying the mind and strengthening the concentration in order to allow the work of insight, which leads to liberation. In contrast, the Vipassana Movement argues that insight levels can be discerned without the need for developing samatha further due to the risks of going out of the course when strong samatha is developed.\n\n\"Pratityasamutpada\", also called \"dependent arising, or dependent origination\", is the Buddhist theory to explain the nature and relations of being, becoming, existence and ultimate reality. Buddhism asserts that there is nothing independent, except the state of nirvana. All physical and mental states depend on and arise from other pre-existing states, and in turn from them arise other dependent states while they cease.\n\nThe 'dependent arisings' have a causal conditioning, and thus \"Pratityasamutpada\" is the Buddhist belief that causality is the basis of ontology, not a creator God nor the ontological Vedic concept called universal Self (Brahman) nor any other 'transcendent creative principle'. However, the Buddhist thought does not understand causality in terms of Newtonian mechanics, rather it understands it as conditioned arising. In Buddhism, dependent arising is referring to conditions created by a plurality of causes that necessarily co-originate a phenomenon within and across lifetimes, such as karma in one life creating conditions that lead to rebirth in one of the realms of existence for another lifetime.\n\nBuddhism applies the dependent arising theory to explain origination of endless cycles of \"dukkha\" and rebirth, through its Twelve NidƒÅnas or \"twelve links\" doctrine. It states that because AvidyƒÅ (ignorance) exists Sa·πÉskƒÅras (karmic formations) exists, because Sa·πÉskƒÅras exists therefore Vij√±ƒÅna (consciousness) exists, and in a similar manner it links NƒÅmar≈´pa (sentient body), ·π¢a·∏çƒÅyatana (six senses), Spar≈õa (sensory stimulation), VedanƒÅ (feeling), Ta·πáhƒÅ (craving), UpƒÅdƒÅna (grasping), Bhava (becoming), JƒÅti (birth), and JarƒÅmara·πáa (old age, death, sorrow, pain).\n\nBy breaking the circuitous links of the Twelve Nidanas, Buddhism asserts that liberation from these endless cycles of rebirth and dukkha can be attained.\n\n≈ö≈´nyatƒÅ, or \"emptiness\", is a central concept in Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka school, and widely attested in the Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ sutras. It brings together key Buddhist doctrines, particularly anatta and dependent origination, to refute the metaphysics of Sarvastivada and SautrƒÅntika (extinct non-Mahayana schools). Not only sentient beings are empty of ƒÅtman; all phenomena (dharmas) are without any svabhava (literally \"own-nature\" or \"self-nature\"), and thus without any underlying essence, and \"empty\" of being independent; thus the heterodox theories of svabhava circulating at the time were refuted on the basis of the doctrines of early Buddhism.\n\nSarvastivada teachings, which were criticized by NƒÅgƒÅrjuna, were reformulated by scholars such as Vasubandhu and Asanga and were adapted into the Yogachara school. One of the main features of YogƒÅcƒÅra philosophy is the concept of \"vij√±apti-mƒÅtra\". It is often used interchangeably with the term \"citta-mƒÅtra\", but they have different meanings. The standard translation of both terms is \"consciousness-only\" or \"mind-only.\" Several modern researchers object to this translation, and the accompanying label of \"absolute idealism\" or \"idealistic monism\". A better translation for \"vij√±apti-mƒÅtra\" is \"representation-only\", while an alternative translation for \"citta\" (mind, thought) \"mƒÅtra\" (only, exclusively) has not been proposed.\n\nWhile the MƒÅdhyamaka school held that asserting the existence or non-existence of any ultimately real thing was inappropriate, some later exponents of Yogachara asserted that the mind and only the mind is ultimately real (a doctrine known as \"cittamatra\"). Vasubandhu and Asanga however did not assert that mind was truly existent, or the basis of all reality.\n\nThese two schools of thought, in opposition or synthesis, form the basis of subsequent Mahayana metaphysics in the Indo-Tibetan tradition.\n\nBuddha-nature is a concept found in some 1st-millennium CE Buddhist texts, such as the \"TathƒÅgatagarbha s≈´tras\". This concept has been controversial in Buddhism, but has a following in East Asian Buddhism. These Sutras suggest, states Paul Williams, that 'all sentient beings contain a Tathagata' as their 'essence, core inner nature, Self'. The \"Tathagatagarbha\" doctrine, at its earliest probably appeared about the later part of the 3rd century CE, and it contradicts the Anatta doctrine (non-Self) in a vast majority of Buddhist texts, leading scholars to posit that the \"Tathagatagarbha Sutras\" were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists. However, the Buddhist text \"RatnagotravibhƒÅga\" states that the \"Self\" implied in \"Tathagatagarbha\" doctrine is actually \"not-Self\".\n\nDevotion is an important part of the practice of most Buddhists. Devotional practices include ritual prayer, prostration, offerings, pilgrimage, and chanting. In Pure Land Buddhism, devotion to the Buddha Amitabha is the main practice. In Nichiren Buddhism, devotion to the Lotus Sutra is the main practice. Bhakti (called \"Bhatti\" in Pali) has been a common practice in Theravada Buddhism, where offerings and group prayers are made to deities and particularly images of Buddha. According to Karel Werner and other scholars, devotional worship has been a significant practice in Theravada Buddhism, and deep devotion is part of Buddhist traditions starting from the earliest days.\n\nGuru devotion is a central practice of Tibetan Buddhism. The guru is considered essential and to the Buddhist devotee, the guru is the \"enlightened teacher and ritual master\" in Vajrayana spiritual pursuits.\n\nFor someone seeking Buddhahood, the guru is the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, wrote the 12th-century Buddhist scholar Sadhanamala. The veneration of and obedience to teachers is also important in Theravada and Zen Buddhism.\n\nBuddhism, like all Indian religions, was an oral tradition in ancient times. The Buddha's words, the early doctrines and concepts, and the interpretations were transmitted from one generation to the next by the word of mouth in monasteries, and not through written texts. The first Buddhist canonical texts were likely written down in Sri Lanka, about 400 years after the Buddha died. The texts were part of the \"Tripitakas\", and many versions appeared thereafter claiming to be the words of the Buddha. Scholarly Buddhist commentary texts, with named authors, appeared in India, around the 2nd century CE. These texts were written in Pali or Sanskrit, sometimes regional languages, as palm-leaf manuscripts, birch bark, painted scrolls, carved into temple walls, and later on paper.\n\nUnlike what the Bible is to Christianity and the Quran is to Islam, but like all major ancient Indian religions, there is no consensus among the different Buddhist traditions as to what constitutes the scriptures or a common canon in Buddhism. The general belief among Buddhists is that the canonical corpus is vast. This corpus includes the ancient \"Sutras\" organized into \"Nikayas\", itself the part of three basket of texts called the \"Tripitakas\". Each Buddhist tradition has its own collection of texts, much of which is translation of ancient Pali and Sanskrit Buddhist texts of India. The Chinese Buddhist canon, for example, includes 2184 texts in 55 volumes, while the Tibetan canon comprises 1108 texts ‚Äî all claimed to have been spoken by the Buddha ‚Äî and another 3461 texts composed by Indian scholars revered in the Tibetan tradition. The Buddhist textual history is vast; over 40,000 manuscripts ‚Äî mostly Buddhist, some non-Buddhist ‚Äî were discovered in 1900 in the Dunhuang Chinese cave alone.\n\nThe PƒÅli Tipitaka (Sanskrit: \"Tripi·π≠aka\", three pitakas), which means \"three baskets\", refers to the \"Vinaya Pitaka\", the \"Sutta Pitaka\", and the \"Abhidhamma Pitaka\". These constitute the oldest known canonical works of Buddhism. The \"Vinaya Pitaka\" contains disciplinary rules for the Buddhist monasteries. The \"Sutta Pitaka\" contains words attributed to the Buddha. The \"Abhidhamma Pitaka\" contain expositions and commentaries on the Sutta, and these vary significantly between Buddhist schools.\n\nThe PƒÅli Tipitaka is the only surviving early Tipitaka. According to some sources, some early schools of Buddhism had five or seven pitakas. Much of the material in the Canon is not specifically \"Theravadin\", but is instead the collection of teachings that this school preserved from the early, non-sectarian body of teachings. According to Peter Harvey, it contains material at odds with later Theravadin orthodoxy. He states: \"The Theravadins, then, may have \"added\" texts to the Canon for some time, but they do not appear to have tampered with what they already had from an earlier period.\"\n\nIn addition to the Pali Canon, the important commentary texts of the Theravada tradition include the 5th-century \"Visuddhimagga\" by Buddhaghosa of the Mahavihara school. It includes sections on shila (virtues), samadhi (concentration), panna (wisdom) as well as Theravada tradition's meditation methodology.\n\nThe Mahayana sutras are a very broad genre of Buddhist scriptures that the Mahayana Buddhist tradition holds are original teachings of the Buddha. Some adherents of Mahayana accept both the early teachings (including in this the Sarvastivada Abhidharma, which was criticized by Nagarjuna and is in fact opposed to early Buddhist thought) and the Mahayana sutras as authentic teachings of Gautama Buddha, and claim they were designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual understanding.\n\nThe Mahayana sutras often claim to articulate the Buddha's deeper, more advanced doctrines, reserved for those who follow the bodhisattva path. That path is explained as being built upon the motivation to liberate all living beings from unhappiness. Hence the name \"MahƒÅyƒÅna\" (lit., \"the Great Vehicle\"). The Theravada school does not treat the Mahayana Sutras as authoritative or authentic teachings of the Buddha.\n\nGenerally, scholars conclude that the Mahayana scriptures were composed from the 1st century CE onwards: \"Large numbers of Mahayana sutras were being composed in the period between the beginning of the common era and the fifth century\".\n\nMany ancient Indian texts have not survived into the modern era, creating a challenge in establishing the historic commonalities between Theravada and Mahayana. The texts preserved in the Tibetan Buddhist monasteries, with parallel Chinese translations, have provided a breakthrough. Among these is the Mahayana text \"≈öƒÅlistamba Sutra\" which no longer exists in a Sanskrit version, but does in Tibetan and Chinese versions. This Mahayana text contains numerous sections which are remarkably the same as the Theravada Pali Canon and Nikaya Buddhism. The \"≈öƒÅlistamba Sutra\" was cited by Mahayana scholars such as the 8th-century Yasomitra to be authoritative. This suggests that Buddhist literature of different traditions shared a common core of Buddhist texts in the early centuries of its history, until Mahayana literature diverged about and after the 1st century CE.\n\nHistorically, the roots of Buddhism lie in the religious thought of Iron Age India around the middle of the first millennium BCE. This was a period of great intellectual ferment and socio-cultural change known as the \"Second urbanisation\", marked by the composition of the Upanishads and the historical emergence of the Sramanic traditions. \nNew ideas developed both in the Vedic tradition in the form of the Upanishads, and outside of the Vedic tradition through the ≈örama·πáa movements. The term ≈örama·πáa refers to several Indian religious movements parallel to but separate from the historical Vedic religion, including Buddhism, Jainism and others such as ƒÄjƒ´vika.\n\nSeveral ≈örama·πáa movements are known to have existed in India before the 6th century BCE (pre-Buddha, pre-Mahavira), and these influenced both the ƒÅstika and nƒÅstika traditions of Indian philosophy. According to Martin Wilshire, the ≈örama·πáa tradition evolved in India over two phases, namely Paccekabuddha and Savaka phases, the former being the tradition of individual ascetic and the latter of disciples, and that Buddhism and Jainism ultimately emerged from these. Brahmanical and non-Brahmanical ascetic groups shared and used several similar ideas, but the ≈örama·πáa traditions also drew upon already established Brahmanical concepts and philosophical roots, states Wiltshire, to formulate their own doctrines. Brahmanical motifs can be found in the oldest Buddhist texts, using them to introduce and explain Buddhist ideas. For example, prior to Buddhist developments, the Brahmanical tradition internalized and variously reinterpreted the three Vedic sacrificial fires as concepts such as Truth, Rite, Tranquility or Restraint. Buddhist texts also refer to the three Vedic sacrificial fires, reinterpreting and explaining them as ethical conduct.\n\nThe ≈örama·πáa religions challenged and broke with the Brahmanic tradition on core assumptions such as Atman (soul, self), Brahman, the nature of afterlife, and they rejected the authority of the Vedas and Upanishads. Buddhism was one among several Indian religions that did so.\n\nThe history of Indian Buddhism may be divided into five periods: Early Buddhism (occasionally called pre-sectarian Buddhism), Nikaya Buddhism or Sectarian Buddhism: The period of the early Buddhist schools, Early Mahayana Buddhism, later Mahayana Buddhism, and Vajrayana Buddhism.\nAccording to Lambert Schmithausen Pre-sectarian Buddhism is \"the canonical period prior to the development of different schools with their different positions.\" Its main scriptures are known as the Early Buddhist Texts and include the four principal NikƒÅyas (and their parallel Agamas) together with the main body of monastic rules, which survive in the various versions of the patimokkha. \n\nInformation of the oldest teachings may be obtained by analysis of the oldest texts. One method to obtain information on the oldest core of Buddhism is to compare the oldest extant versions of the Theravadin PƒÅli Canon and other texts. The reliability of these sources, and the possibility to draw out a core of oldest teachings, is a matter of dispute. According to Vetter, inconsistencies remain, and other methods must be applied to resolve those inconsistencies.\n\nAccording to Schmithausen, three positions held by scholars of Buddhism can be distinguished:\n\nAccording to Mitchell, certain basic teachings appear in many places throughout the early texts, which has led most scholars to conclude that Gautama Buddha must have taught something similar to the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, Nirvana, the three marks of existence, the five aggregates, dependent origination, karma and rebirth. Yet critical analysis reveals discrepancies, which point to alternative possibilities.\n\nBruce Matthews notes that there is no cohesive presentation of karma in the Sutta Pitaka, which may mean that the doctrine was incidental to the main perspective of early Buddhist soteriology. Schmithausen has questioned whether karma already played a role in the theory of rebirth of earliest Buddhism. According to Vetter, \"the Buddha at first sought \"the deathless\" (\"amata/amrta\"), which is concerned with the here and now. Only later did he become acquainted with the doctrine of rebirth.\" Bronkhorst disagrees, and concludes that the Buddha \"introduced a concept of karma that differed considerably from the commonly held views of his time.\" According to Bronkhorst, not physical and mental activities as such were seen as responsible for rebirth, but intentions and desire.\n\nAnother core problem in the study of early Buddhism is the relation between \"dhyana\" and insight. Schmithausen states that the four noble truths as \"liberating insight\", may be a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya 36.\n\nAccording to both Bronkhorst and Anderson, the Four Noble Truths became a substitution for prajna, or \"liberating insight\", in the suttas in those texts where \"liberating insight\" was preceded by the four jhƒÅnas. The four truths may not have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, and did not serve in earliest Buddhism as a description of \"liberating insight\". Gotama's teachings may have been personal, \"adjusted to the need of each person.\"\n\nThe three marks of existence ‚Äì Dukkha, Annica, Anatta ‚Äì may reflect Upanishadic or other influences. K.R. Norman supposes that these terms were already in use at the Buddha's time, and were familiar to his hearers. According to Vetter, the description of the Buddhist path may initially have been as simple as the term \"the middle way\". In time, this short description was elaborated, resulting in the description of the eightfold path. Similarly nibbƒÅna is the common term for the desired goal of this practice, yet many other terms can be found throughout the NikƒÅyas, which are not specified.\n\nAccording to the scriptures, soon after the (from Sanskrit: \"highest extinguishment\") of Gautama Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held. As with any ancient Indian tradition, transmission of teaching was done orally. The primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teachings to ensure that no errors occurred in oral transmission. Richard Gombrich states that the monastic assembly recitations of the Buddha's teaching likely began during Buddha's lifetime, similar to the First Council, that helped compose Buddhist scriptures.\n\nThe Second Buddhist council resulted in the first schism in the Sangha, probably caused by a group of reformists called Sthaviras who split from the conservative majority MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas. After unsuccessfully trying to modify the Vinaya, a small group of \"elderly members\", i.e. \"sthaviras\", broke away from the majority MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika during the Second Buddhist council, giving rise to the Sthavira Nikaya.\n\nThe Sthaviras gave rise to several schools, one of which was the Theravada school. Originally, these schisms were caused by disputes over monastic disciplinary codes of various fraternities, but eventually, by about 100 CE if not earlier, schisms were being caused by doctrinal disagreements too. Buddhist monks of different fraternities became distinct schools and stopped doing official Sangha business together, but continued to study each other's doctrines.\n\nFollowing (or leading up to) the schisms, each Sa·πÖgha started to accumulate their own version of Tripi·π≠aka (Pali Canons, triple basket of texts). In their Tripi·π≠aka, each school included the Suttas of the Buddha, a Vinaya basket (disciplinary code) and added an Abhidharma basket which were texts on detailed scholastic classification, summary and interpretation of the Suttas. The doctrine details in the Abhidharmas of various Buddhist schools differ significantly, and these were composed starting about the third century BCE and through the 1st millennium CE. Eighteen early Buddhist schools are known, each with its own Tripitaka, but only one collection from Sri Lanka has survived, in a nearly complete state, into the modern era.\n\nSeveral scholars have suggested that the Mahayana Buddhist tradition started in south India (modern Andhra Pradesh), and it is there that Prajnaparamita sutras, among the earliest Mahayana sutras, developed among the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika along the K·πõ·π£·πáa River region about the 1st century BCE.\n\nThere is no evidence that Mahayana ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas. Initially it was known as \"BodhisattvayƒÅna\" (the \"Vehicle of the Bodhisattvas\"). Paul Williams states that the MahƒÅyƒÅna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate Vinaya or ordination codes from the early schools of Buddhism. Records written by Chinese monks visiting India indicate that both MahƒÅyƒÅna and non-MahƒÅyƒÅna monks could be found in the same monasteries, with the difference that Mahayana monks worshipped figures of Bodhisattvas, while non-Mahayana monks did not.\n\nMuch of the early extant evidence for the origins of MahƒÅyƒÅna comes from early Chinese translations of MahƒÅyƒÅna texts. These Mahayana teachings were first propagated into China by Lokak·π£ema, the first translator of Mahayana sutras into Chinese during the 2nd century CE. Some scholars have traditionally considered the earliest MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras to include the very first versions of the Prajnaparamita series, along with texts concerning Ak·π£obhya, which were probably composed in the 1st century BCE in the south of India.\n\nDuring the period of Late MahƒÅyƒÅna, four major types of thought developed: Madhyamaka, Yogachara, Tathagatagarbha, and Buddhist logic as the last and most recent. In India, the two main philosophical schools of the Mahayana were the Madhyamaka and the later Yogachara. According to Dan Lusthaus, Madhyamaka and Yogachara have a great deal in common, and the commonality stems from early Buddhism. There were no great Indian teachers associated with tathagatagarbha thought.\n\nScholarly research concerning Esoteric Buddhism is still in its early stages and has a number of problems that make research difficult:\n\n\nBuddhism may have spread only slowly in India until the time of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka, who was a public supporter of the religion. The support of A≈õoka and his descendants led to the construction of more st≈´pas (Buddhist religious memorials) and to its spread throughout the Maurya empire and into neighbouring lands such as Central Asia and to the island of Sri Lanka. These two missions, in opposite directions, would ultimately lead, in the first case to the spread of Buddhism into China, Korea and Japan, and in the second case, to the emergence of Sinhalese TheravƒÅda Buddhism and its spread from Sri Lanka to much of Southeast Asia.\n\nThis period marks the first known spread of Buddhism beyond India. According to the edicts of A≈õoka, emissaries were sent to various countries west of India to spread Buddhism (Dharma), particularly in eastern provinces of the neighbouring Seleucid Empire, and even farther to Hellenistic kingdoms of the Mediterranean. It is a matter of disagreement among scholars whether or not these emissaries were accompanied by Buddhist missionaries. \n\nIn central and west Asia, Buddhist influence grew, through Greek-speaking Buddhist monarchs and ancient Asian trade routes. An example of this is evidenced in Chinese and Pali Buddhist records, such as \"Milindapanha\" and the Greco-Buddhist art of GandhƒÅra. The \"Milindapanha\" describes a conversation between a Buddhist monk and the 2nd-century BCE Greek king Menander, after which Menander abdicates and himself goes into monastic life in the pursuit of nirvana. Some scholars have questioned the \"Milindapanha\" version, expressing doubts whether Menander was Buddhist or just favourably disposed to Buddhist monks.\n\nThe Kushans (mid 1st‚Äì3rd century CE) came to control the Silk Road trade through Central and South Asia, which brought them to interact with ancient Buddhist monasteries and societies involved in trade in these regions. They patronized Buddhist institutions, and Buddhist monastery influence, in turn, expanded into a world religion, according to Xinru Liu. Buddhism spread to Khotan and China, eventually to other parts of the far east. \n\nSome of the earliest written documents of the Buddhist faith are the Gandharan Buddhist texts, dating from about the 1st century CE, and connected to the Dharmaguptaka school. These texts are written in the Kharosthi script, a script that was predominantly used in the Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek kingdoms of northern India and that played a prominent role in the coinage and inscriptions of their kings.\n\nThe 7th century Islamic conquest of the Iranian Plateau followed by the Muslim conquests of Afghanistan and the later establishment of the Ghaznavid kingdom in Central Asia (ca. 977‚Äì1186) led to the decline and eventual disappearance of Buddhism from most of these regions.\n\nThe Silk Road transmission of Buddhism to China is most commonly thought to have started in the late 2nd or the 1st century CE, though the literary sources are all open to question. The first documented translation efforts by foreign Buddhist monks in China were in the 2nd century CE, probably as a consequence of the expansion of the Kushan Empire into the Chinese territory of the Tarim Basin. \n\nThe first documented Buddhist texts translated into Chinese are those of the Parthian An Shigao (148-180 CE). The first known MahƒÅyƒÅna scriptural texts are translations into Chinese by the Kushan monk Lokak·π£ema in Luoyang, between 178 and 189 CE. From China, Buddhism was introduced into its neighbors Korea (4th century), Japan (6th-7th centuries), and Vietnam (c. 1st-2nd centuries). \n\nDuring the Chinese Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907), Chinese Esoteric Buddhism was introduced from India and Chan Buddhism (Zen) became a major religion. Chan continued to grow in the Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279) and it was during this era that it strongly influenced Korean Buddhism and Japanese Buddhism. Pure Land Buddhism also became popular during this period and was often practiced together with Chan. It was also during the Song that the entire Chinese canon was printed using over 130,000 wooden printing blocks.\n\nDuring the Indian period of Esoteric Buddhism (from the 8th century onwards), Buddhism spread from India to Tibet and Mongolia. Johannes Bronkhorst states that the esoteric form was attractive because it allowed both a secluded monastic community as well as the social rites and rituals important to laypersons and to kings for the maintenance of a political state during succession and wars to resist invasion. During the Middle Ages, Buddhism slowly declined in India, while it vanished from Persia and Central Asia as Islam became the state religion.\n\nThe Theravada school arrived in Sri Lanka sometime in the 3rd century BCE. Sri Lanka became a base for its later spread to southeast Asia after the 5th century CE (Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia and coastal Vietnam). Theravada Buddhism was the dominant religion in Burma during the Mon Hanthawaddy Kingdom (1287‚Äì1552). It also became dominant in the Khmer Empire during the 13th and 14th centuries and in the Thai Sukhothai Kingdom during the reign of Ram Khamhaeng (1237/1247 - 1298).\n\nIn the modern era, Buddhism faced various changes and challenges. These include the colonization of Buddhist states by Christian countries, persecution under modern states, the growth of modern consumer culture and the findings of modern science. One response to some of these challenges has come to be called Buddhist modernism, which was one of the responses to the threat of colonialism and christian proselytism in Sri Lanka. Buddhist modernist figures such as the American convert Henry Olcott (1832‚Äì 1907) and Anagarika Dharmapala (1864‚Äì1933) promoted Buddhism as a scientific and rational religion which they saw as compatible with modern science. Other important figures of Buddhist modernist revival include B. R. Ambedkar (1891‚Äì1956), leader of the Dalit Buddhist movement, who urged low caste Indian Dalits to convert to Buddhism as well as the Thai King Mongkut (r. 1851‚Äì68), and his son King Chulalongkorn (r. 1868‚Äì1910), who were responsible for modern reforms of Thai Buddhism. Another modern development was the development of the Vipassana movement which promoted Buddhist meditation practices among laypersons and became very popular in the West. \n\nEast Asian Buddhism meanwhile suffered under various wars which ravaged China during the modern era, such as the Taiping rebellion and the Second World War (which also affected Korean Buddhism). During the Republican period (1912-49), a new movement called Humanistic Buddhism was developed by figures such as Taixu (1899‚Äì1947), and though Buddhist institutions were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì76), there has been a revival of the religion in China after 1977. Japanese Buddhism also went through a period of modernization during the Meiji Era. In Central Asia meanwhile, the arrival of Communist repression to Tibet (1966-1980) and Mongolia (between 1924-1990) had a strong negative impact on Buddhist institutions, though the situation has improved somewhat since the 80s and 90s.\n\nOne of the most significant events of the modern era was the spread of all major forms of Buddhism to the Western world (Americas, Europe and Oceania). While there were some encounters between Western travelers or missionaries such as St. Francis Xavier and Ippolito Desideri and Buddhist cultures, it was not until the 19th century that Buddhism began to be properly understood by Western scholars. It was the work of pioneering scholars such as Eug√®ne Burnouf, Max M√ºller, Hermann Oldenberg and Thomas William Rhys Davids that paved the way for modern Buddhist studies in the West. It was also during the 19th century that large numbers of Asian Buddhist immigrants (mainly from China and Japan) first began to arrive in Western countries such as the United States and Canada, bringing with them their Buddhist religion. This period also saw the first Westerners to formally convert to Buddhism, Helena Blavatsky and Henry Steel Olcott. An important event in the introduction of Buddhism to the West was the 1893 World Parliament of Religions, which for the first time saw well publicized speeches by major Buddhist leaders alongside other religious leaders. The 20th century saw a prolific growth of new Buddhist institutions in Western countries, including the Buddhist Society, London (1924), Das Buddhistische Haus (1924) and Datsan Gunzechoinei in St Petersburg. The publication and translations of Buddhist literature in Western languages also increased exponentially. After the second world war, further immigration from Asia, globalization, the breakdown of the hegemony of Christianity on Western Culture as well a renewed interest in Buddhism among the 60s counterculture led to further growth in Buddhist institutions. Influential figures on post-war Western Buddhism include Shunryu Suzuki, Jack Kerouac, Alan Watts, Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh, and the 14th Dalai Lama.\n\nBuddhists generally classify themselves as either Theravada or Mahayana. This classification is also used by some scholars and is the one ordinarily used in the English language. An alternative scheme used by some scholars divides Buddhism into the following three traditions or geographical or cultural areas: Theravada, East Asian Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism.\nSome scholars use other schemes. Buddhists themselves have a variety of other schemes. Hinayana (literally \"lesser or inferior vehicle\") is used by Mahayana followers to name the family of early philosophical schools and traditions from which contemporary Theravada emerged, but as the Hinayana term is considered derogatory, a variety of other terms are used instead, including ≈örƒÅvakayƒÅna, Nikaya Buddhism, early Buddhist schools, sectarian Buddhism and conservative Buddhism.\nNot all traditions of Buddhism share the same philosophical outlook, or treat the same concepts as central. Each tradition, however, does have its own core concepts, and some comparisons can be drawn between them:\n\nThis is a rough timeline of the development of the different schools/traditions:\nThe Theravada tradition traces its roots to the words of the Buddha preserved in the Pali Canon, and considers itself to be the more orthodox form of Buddhism.\n\nTheravada flourished in south India and Sri Lanka in ancient times; from there it spread for the first time into mainland southeast Asia about the 11th century into its elite urban centres. By the 13th century, Theravada had spread widely into the rural areas of mainland southeast Asia, displacing Mahayana Buddhism and some traditions of Hinduism which had arrived in places such as Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia around the mid-1st millennium CE. The later traditions were well established in south Thailand and Java by the 7th century, under the sponsorship of the Srivijaya dynasty. The political separation between Khmer and Sukhothai led the Sukhothai king to welcome Sri Lankan emissaries, helping them establish the first Theravada Buddhist \"sangha\" in the 13th century, in contrast to the Mahayana tradition of Khmer earlier.\n\nSinhalese Buddhist reformers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries portrayed the Pali Canon as the original version of scripture. They also emphasized Theravada being rational and scientific.\n\nTheravƒÅda is primarily practised today in Sri Lanka, Burma, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia as well as small portions of China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Bangladesh. It has a growing presence in the west.\n\nMahayana schools consider the Mahayana Sutras as authoritative scriptures and accurate rendering of Buddha's words. These traditions have been the more liberal form of Buddhism allowing different and new interpretations that emerged over time.\n\nMahayana flourished in India from the time of Ashoka, through to the dynasty of the Guptas (4th to 6th-century). MahƒÅyƒÅna monastic foundations and centres of learning were established by the Buddhist kings, and the Hindu kings of the Gupta dynasty as evidenced by records left by three Chinese visitors to India. The Gupta dynasty, for example, helped establish the famed NƒÅlandƒÅ University in Bihar. These monasteries and foundations helped Buddhist scholarship, as well as studies into non-Buddhist traditions and secular subjects such as medicine, host visitors and spread Buddhism into East and Central Asia.\n\nNative Mahayana Buddhism is practised today in China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, parts of Russia and most of Vietnam (also commonly referred to as \"Eastern Buddhism\"). The Buddhism practised in Tibet, the Himalayan regions, and Mongolia is also Mahayana in origin, but is discussed below under the heading of Vajrayana (also commonly referred to as \"Northern Buddhism\"). There are a variety of strands in Eastern Buddhism, of which \"the Pure Land school of Mahayana is the most widely practised today.\". In most of this area however, they are fused into a single unified form of Buddhism. In Japan in particular, they form separate denominations with the five major ones being: Nichiren, peculiar to Japan; Pure Land; Shingon, a form of Vajrayana; Tendai, and Zen. In Korea, nearly all Buddhists belong to the Chogye school, which is officially Son (Zen), but with substantial elements from other traditions.\n\nThe goal and philosophy of the VajrayƒÅna remains MahƒÅyƒÅnist, but its methods are seen by its followers as far more powerful, so as to lead to Buddhahood in just one lifetime. The practice of using mantras was adopted from Hinduism, where they were first used in the Vedas.\n\nVarious classes of Vajrayana literature developed as a result of royal courts sponsoring both Buddhism and Saivism. The Ma√±jusrimulakalpa, which later came to classified under Kriyatantra, states that mantras taught in the Saiva, Garuda and Vaisnava tantras will be effective if applied by Buddhists since they were all taught originally by Manjushri. The Guhyasiddhi of Padmavajra, a work associated with the Guhyasamaja tradition, prescribes acting as a Saiva guru and initiating members into Saiva Siddhanta scriptures and mandalas. The Samvara tantra texts adopted the pitha list from the Saiva text \"Tantrasadbhava\", introducing a copying error where a deity was mistaken for a place.\n\nTibetan Buddhism preserves the Vajrayana teachings of eighth-century India. Tantric Buddhism is largely concerned with ritual and meditative practices. A central feature of Buddhist Tantra is deity yoga which includes visualization and identification with an enlightened yidam or meditation deity and its associated mandala. Another element of Tantra is the need for ritual initiation or empowerment (abhi·π£eka) by a Guru or Lama. Some Tantras like the GuhyasamƒÅja Tantra features new forms of antinomian ritual practice such as the use taboo substances like alcohol, sexual yoga, and charnel ground practices which evoke wrathful deities.\n\nZen Buddhism (Á¶Ö), pronounced \"Ch√°n\" in Chinese, \"seon\" in Korean or \"zen\" in Japanese (derived from the Sanskrit term \"dhyƒÅna\", meaning \"meditation\") is a form of Mahayana Buddhism found in China, Korea and Japan. It lays special emphasis on meditation, and direct discovery of the Buddha-nature.\n\nZen Buddhism is divided into two main schools: Rinzai (Ëá®Ê∏àÂÆó) and S≈çt≈ç (ÊõπÊ¥ûÂÆó), the former greatly favouring the use in meditation on the koan (ÂÖ¨Ê°à, a meditative riddle or puzzle) as a device for spiritual break-through, and the latter (while certainly employing koans) focusing more on \"shikantaza\" or \"just sitting\".\n\nZen Buddhism is primarily found in Japan, with some presence in South Korea and Vietnam. The scholars of Japanese Soto Zen tradition in recent times have critiqued the mainstream Japanese Buddhism for \"dhatu-vada\", that is assuming things have substantiality, a view they assert to be non-Buddhist and \"out of tune with the teachings of non-Self and conditioned arising\", states Peter Harvey.\n\nThere is growing worldwide interest in Buddhism.\n\nBuddhism has spread across the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East it is regarded as familiar and traditional. In countries such as Cambodia and Bhutan, it is recognized as the state religion and receives government support. In certain regions such as Afghanistan, Buddhist monuments have been targets of violence and destruction.\nModern influences increasingly lead to new forms of Buddhism that are diverse and that significantly depart from traditional beliefs and practices. A number of modern movements or tendencies in Buddhism emerged during the second half of the 20th century, including the Navayana school and Dalit Buddhist movement launched by B.R. Ambedkar. The Navayana (literally, \"new vehicle\") rejects the foundational doctrines and practices accepted by traditional Theravada and Mahayana traditions, by discarding ideas such as monk lifestyle after renunciation, karma, rebirth, samsara, meditation, nirvana, Four Noble Truths and others. Ambedkar's Navayana Buddhism considers these as superstitions and re-interprets the original Buddha as someone who taught about class struggle and social equality.\n\nModern Buddhist movements include Secular Buddhism in many countries, Won Buddhism in Korea, the Dhammakaya movement in Thailand and several Japanese organizations, such as Shinnyo-en, Rissh≈ç K≈çsei-kai or Soka Gakkai.\n\nBuddhism is practised by an estimated 488 million, 495 million, or 535 million people as of the 2010s, representing 7% to 8% of the world's total population.\nChina is the country with the largest population of Buddhists, approximately 244 million or 18.2% of its total population. They are mostly followers of Chinese schools of \"Mahayana\", making this the largest body of Buddhist traditions. Mahayana, also practised in broader East Asia, is followed by over half of world Buddhists.\n\nAccording to a demographic analysis reported by Peter Harvey (2013): \"Mahayana\" has 360 million adherents; \"Theravada\" has 150 million adherents; and \"Vajrayana\" has 18.2 million adherents.\n\nAccording to Johnson and Grim (2013), Buddhism has grown from a total of 138 million adherents in 1910, of which 137 million were in Asia, to 495 million in 2010, of which 487 million are in Asia. Over 98% of all Buddhists live in the Asia-Pacific and South Asia region. North America had about 3.9 million Buddhists, Europe 1.3 million, while South America, Africa and the Middle East had an estimated combined total of about 1 million Buddhists in 2010.\n\nBuddhism is the dominant religion in Bhutan, Burma, Cambodia, Tibet, Laos, Mongolia, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Large Buddhist populations live in China (18%), Japan (36%), Taiwan (35%), Macau (17%), North Korea (14%), Nepal (11%), Vietnam (10%), Singapore (33%), Hong Kong (15%) and South Korea (23%).\n\nBuddhism is also growing by conversion.In United states,only about a third (32%) of Buddhists in the United States are Asian; a majority (53%) are white. Buddhism in the America is primarily made up of native-born adherents, whites and converts.\nAfter China, where nearly half of the worldwide Buddhists live, the 10 countries with the largest Buddhist population densities are:\n\n\"Subnotes\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is often taken to be the equivalent of king or lord, and was used by the Maratha. The word ‚ÄòChhatrapati‚Äô is a tatpurusha Sanskrit compound of \"chhatra\" (\"parasol\" or \"umbrella\") and \"pati\" (\"master/lord/ruler\"). The parasol was considered a symbol of absolute, or even universal, sovereignty and consecrated kingship, and has been used by monarchies outside of India, as well. The title indicates a person who is a sovereign ruler over other princes, and not a vassal.\nIn contrast, the Indian titles of \"Maharaja\" or \"Raja\", \"Yuvraj\", \"Rajkumar\" or \"Kumar\", and \"Senapati\", reflect a range of European equivalent meanings, from King, Crown Prince, and Prince, to Duke, Count, or Lord. Shivaji adopted 'Chhatrapati' it since other titles were bestowed by other lieges and paramount rulers, like the Adilshahi or Mughals.\n\nThe following list details the Chhatrapatis of the House of Bhosle. The title was held by his successors, although the increasing power of the Peshwas and later Maratha generals reduced it to a nominal position. The Grand Princes of Satara were generally considered the inheritors of the title, although the Rajas of Kohlapur did have a claim by descent, as their position began as a subsidiary title of Shivaji II due to location of his court. His mother, the Regent Tarabai, established a rival regime in Kohlapur, challenging both the power of the Peshwas and the Mughal-backed claims of Shahu.\n\nThe following is the list of the Chhatrapatis of Satara.

In the same year the lecture was published as a book by The Vedanta Centre, Boston. In his lecture Vivekananda attempted to analyze the life and messages of Jesus through Vedanta.\n\nIn his lecture Vivekananda has compared the entire human existence to an ocean, where an individual's life is like waves. He has compared human lives with the waves rising on the ocean, and then falling down. Jesus is like a big wave that comes very rarely. Vivekananda called Jesus \"The great soul, the Messenger.\"\n\nVivekananda in his lecture, while presenting a balanced view on Christianity, also mentioned its drawbacks. He based his arguments on his Hindu philosophy of Vedanta which was that there was only one reality in the world which was the Brahman which subsumes the core aspects of the human being, the Atman. He said that in Christ the most profound knowledge is made available to us which is the identity of human beings and God.\n\nVivekananda said that the land where he was born, in a race which was the land of the Jews, was in strife with stagnation and suffering and due to differences between Pharisees and Sadducees. This caused \"about the very impetus which came out at the other end as the gigantic brain of Jesus of Nazareth.\" The land was in the Asian region, which has lofty mountains touching the sky and large swathes of desert land.\n\nVivekananda looked at Jesus Christ from the prescriptive of an Orientalist as He was born in the region of Asia and thus called Jesus as an \"Oriental of Orientals,\" though his physical features of blue eyes and yellow hair was a picture presented by Europeans. He made a comparison of the two religious beliefs of the west and the east - the former as a Greek culture of politics dominated by God of human passions. While the culture of the east was for what is beyond that which exists. All divine prophets were oriental like Jesus. Jesus was practical in the oriental sense.\n\nVivekananda, in his lecture, as an analogy, drew attention to the wise sayings of Krishna, the Hindu god, from the Bhagavad Gita that: \"Wherever thou findeth a great soul of immense power and purity struggling to raise humanity, know that he is born of My Splendour, that I am working there through him,\" and said that in addition to finding God in Jesus of Nazareth, let us find Him through all those prophets, the man-Gods, he preceded, succeeded or yet to follow Jesus, as they are all reincarnations of the same God whom we all hold in great reverence.\n\nVivekananda emphasized that it was essential to worship God as man, and such a god man was Christ and hence not to give up his worship as \"all our ideas of God are concentrated there\". However, he mentioned the drawback of Christianity as their refusal to consider other reincarnations of God in other religions. Buddha before Christ was a reincarnation of God and like him there were many more.\n\nVivekananda spoke that Jesus's message to all was to pursue the ideal and achieve it in one's own way, irrespective of whether one gives credit for His teachings or not. Religion is not traded like a shop owner. What is taught by Jesus is only truth, which is nobody's proprietorial right. \"Truth is God Himself.\"\n\nIn his \"oeuvre\" Vivekananda said that Christ was \"intensely practical\" and offered a practical religion. A significant reference made by Vivekananda was to the saying from the Bible (Mathew 8:20, Luke 9:58) to stress the message that renouncing worldly matters is the way to salvation: \"Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the son of Man has no place to lay his head.\"\n\nThe lecture was first published as a book by The Vedanta Centre, Boston in 1900. It was also included in \"The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda\" \"Volume IV\". The publication is based on the stenographic records of his lectures delivered in Los Angeles in January 1900 to a large audience of Christians.\n\n"}

CoSWUS is integrated within the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Church of Scientology. The corporation is composed of several individual Scientology organizations and entities, among them churches, such as the \"Church of Scientology of Los Angeles\", which delivers services to public members of Scientology.\n\nIn its application for tax exemption, CoSWUS described the structure of the corporation as follows:\n\n\"The CSWUS corporation houses six distinct ecclesiastical organizations that includes three churches, each of which\nministers religious services at a different level of the religious hierarchy described above; two supervisory organizations and an ecclesiastical support organization. [...] Except for the Church of Scientology of San Diego, all of these church organizations are located in Los Angeles where they share a large complex of buildings and facilities. [...]\"\n\nThe core of CoSWUS' organizations are located around L. Ron Hubbard Way in Hollywood, where three so-called \"service organizations\" are located: the already mentioned \"Church of Scientology of Los Angeles\", the \"American Saint Hill Organization\" (ASHO) and the \"Advanced Organization Los Angeles\" (AOLA). In this area is also the former \"Cedars of Lebanon\" Hospital located, which was purchased by the Church of Scientology during the 1970s and which serves today as a dormitory for the Scientology staff members, who work in the adjacent buildings or elsewhere in Los Angeles.\n\nOn April 8, 1971 a new Scientology organization was incorporated in San Diego - the \"Church of Scientology of Jolla\". Its name was later changed to \"Church of Scientology of San Diego\". Finally, on May 20, 1985, the organization was transferred and re-incorporated in Los Angeles under the new name \"Church of Scientology Western United States\". The Board of Directors of the newly named corporation had adopted the organization's new Bylaws on May 19, 1985.\n\nAt present the official address of CoSWUS is 1308 L. Ron Hubbard Way, Los Angeles CA 90027.\n\nIn 1993, the Church of Scientology International submitted to the Internal Revenue Service a list with all the corporate officers of the Scientology network. At this time, CoSWUS was officially managed by a Board of Trustees. Its members were Mariette Cynstein, Ivan Obolensky and Mary Pinat. The organization's Board of Directors was composed of Linda Sereda, Lawrence Lynn and Eugene Skonetski. The President of CoSWUS was Lawrence Lynn, with Linda Sereda as Secretary and Eugene Skonetski as Treasurer.\n\nOn August 18, 1993, CoSWUS filed an application for tax exemption under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. In the same year, the Internal Revenue Service granted CoSWUS' request for exemption.\n\nAs of March 11, 2000 CoSWUS had the following corporate officers: Vicki Shantz (Chief Executive Officer/President), Wayne Carnahan (Secretary) and Vincenzo Contrafatto (Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer).\n\nAs of May 2, 2008, CoSWUS' official agent has been the attorney Jeanne Gavigan. Her official address is 6400 Canoga Park Avenue, Canoga Park, CA 91367.\n\nThe Religious Technology Center (RTC) is the holder of Scientology's trademarks and service marks. As such, RTC entered with the CoSWUS on May 23, 1985 an organizational covenant, granting CoSWUS the right to sell and deliver the \"Advanced Technology\" to its public members while guaranteeing weekly payments of 6% of the monetary value of the \"Advanced Technology\"-services that are being delivered to the public from CoSWUS towards RTC.\n\nThe Church of Scientology International (CSI) presents itself as the mother church of the Church of Scientology worldwide. As such, it has the right to use and sub-license various Scientology trademarks and service marks. Consequently, CSI has entered a number of agreements with other subordinate organizations in the Scientology hierarchy, such as the CoSWUS:\n\n\nAccording to its 1993 application for tax exemption, the corporation CoSWUS consisted at that time of six different sub-organizations or sub-entities:\n\n\"[...] 1. Church of Scientology Advanced Organization of Los Angeles ('AOLA') - AOLA is one of four advanced organizations in the world and the only one located in the United States.

Her character was conceived by show runner Joe Weisberg and is portrayed by Keri Russell.\n\nElizabeth is a KGB agent who, with her husband Philip (Matthew Rhys), is an illegal, posing as a travel agent in Washington D.C.\n\nElizabeth was born Nadezhda in Smolensk, the daughter of a coal miner and a bookkeeper for the local Communist Party committee. Her family suffered great privation both during and after the Great Patriotic War, in which her father was killed. Elizabeth grew up believing her father to be one of the honored war dead, until her mother revealed that he had actually been shot as a deserter. When she was 14 her mother was bedridden with diphtheria, forcing Elizabeth to nurse her while still attending school.\n\nAs a teenager, the KGB approached Elizabeth as a candidate for the Illegals Program. Although prohibited from telling anyone, Elizabeth surreptitiously managed to consult with her mother about her decision, who unhesitatingly told her that she must do her duty for her motherland. She trained to become an undercover agent until the age of 22. During this time, she was raped by one of her captains in the KGB, Timoshev. In 1962, Elizabeth and fellow KGB agent \"Phillip Jennings\" (Mischa) were assigned to each other to pose as husband and wife in America. In 1965 they move to America under false identities and take up work in a travel agency. Elizabeth meets and recruits civil rights activist Gregory to the KGB and has an ongoing affair with him. She gives birth to her and Phillip's first child, Paige, in 1967, and their second child, Henry, in 1970.\n\nIn 1981, Elizabeth Jennings lives with her husband Philip in suburban Falls Church, Virginia. They are revealed to be a pair of sleeper agents working for the KGB. They have two U.S.-born children, Paige and Henry, both of whom are completely unaware of their parents' true identities. The Jenningses run a small travel agency in Dupont Circle as a cover for their illegal activities.\n\nAfter a failed deportation, Elizabeth and Philip kidnap Timoshev, a defected KGB agent, who raped Elizabeth when she was in training. At the time of Timoshev's kidnapping, counter-intelligence FBI agent Stan Beeman moves next door, causing Philip to suggest defecting themselves. Elizabeth declines and Philip murders Timoshev when he finds out he raped her. Despite a marriage arranged by the KGB, Elizabeth tells Philip that she is beginning to feel love for him for the first time in their 16-year relationship and they try to become a real married couple. However, Philip is hurt upon discovering Elizabeth had an ongoing affair with Gregory Thomas (Derek Luke), a black militant.\n\nAfter planting a bug in Caspar Weinberger's study, the Jenningses listen for vital intelligence. When the KGB begin to suspect a mole in their midst, they send operatives posing as FBI agents to kidnap and torture Elizabeth and Philip in order to test their loyalty. Elizabeth is hurt and angry that the people to whom she has devoted her life could treat her with such distrust, while Philip accuses Elizabeth of incurring the KGB's suspicions by reporting to them he had considered defecting. She denies this, admitting only that she had told their handlers that he liked living in the U.S. more than he should. Elizabeth and Philip later reconcile, but subsequently separate when Elizabeth discovers Philip had an affair with his former girlfriend, Irina. Philip moves out and into a motel.\n\nPhilip accidentally murders Stan's partner, Amador, during a botched operation, which causes Gregory to fall under the suspicion of the FBI regarding his involvement in the killing. Unwilling to go along with the KGB's plan to send him out of the country, Gregory spends a final night with Elizabeth and then commits suicide by cop to deflect attention from her. Later, Elizabeth's mentor, General Victor Zhukov, is assassinated under orders from a CIA officer, whom Elizabeth and Philip track down. Elizabeth brings him into a bathroom for sex, and she and Philip kidnap him and bring him to a warehouse, but Elizabeth, still upset about Zhukov's death, decides to let him go, whereupon the CIA officer gives the FBI a vague description of her and Philip.\n\nElizabeth learns from her informant, Sanford Prince, that he has secured a meeting with a United States Air Force colonel who has information on the SDI project. The FBI learn of the bug in Weinberger's study and provide the KGB with disinformation through it. Philip is unsure of the meeting with the Colonel and attends in her place (against her wishes), while Elizabeth goes to pick up the Weinberger tape. Philip finds out Elizabeth's mission is compromised and picks her up just as the FBI are closing in on her, but she is shot by Stan when the FBI begin firing on them. After Elizabeth's surgery, she tells Philip in Russian to \"come home\".\n\nElizabeth recovers at a remote safe-house and returns home in time for Henry's 11th birthday. However, the celebration is cut short, as she and Philip must go meet the Connors, another spy couple, but promise a \"birthday weekend\" at an amusement park. The Connors surprise Philip by involving him (and, unwittingly, Henry) in a supposedly safe mission during their visit, handing him a key to their hotel room to rendezvous when the operation is complete. When Elizabeth and Philip find all but one of the Connors family shot to death in their room, they become paranoid. Elizabeth locks down the house and suggests Philip tries to glean information from Martha, his FBI informant.\n\nMeanwhile, Elizabeth learns that her daughter, Paige, has become deeply involved in a church that is active in liberal political causes. Elizabeth's reactions are mixed; on the one hand, she is pleased with Paige's growing awareness, but remains uncomfortable with its religious overtones. Upon discovering that her daughter has given all her savings to the church, Elizabeth punishes her by waking her up at 2 AM on a school night and forcing her to clean the house.\n\nIn the season finale, Elizabeth is shocked to learn of the Center's plans to create a second generation of illegals composed of the U.S.-born children of KGB operatives indoctrinated and trained to infiltrate the American security agencies. The Connors' son, Jared, was the first to be contacted, with disastrous results‚Äîwhen his parents strenuously objected to his involvement in their espionage work, he killed them and his sister to protect his mission. Despite this tragedy, the Center tells the Jennings that it intends to continue with the program and that it expects them to begin grooming Paige. Both of the Jennings are horrified at first, but Elizabeth begins to warm to the idea, reasoning that Paige needs a cause to devote her life to and that she should know her parents' true identities and, by extension, her own.\n\nElizabeth grew up in poverty, and she developed a hard and icy exterior like her mother. The first 15 years of her marriage with Philip were relatively loveless. Elizabeth finally opens up to him after he kills her rapist. Initially, her newfound love for Philip is a conflict of interest to her because she has trouble constructively expressing and making sense of her own emotions. When Philip feels betrayed by her, they become dishonest with one another and briefly separate. It's only when Elizabeth is shot that she realizes how important Philip is in her life, and she realizes she can trust him with anything. She is intelligent, physically fit, and attractive. She is willing to use these qualities to manipulate people into giving her the information she needs.\n\nEven though Elizabeth struggles to find a balance between making decisions with her newfound emotion versus the logic that has gotten her so far in her career, Philip is able to help her reach a collaborative decision; as they have become close friends and confidants as the show has progressed. Paige's adolescence is challenging for Elizabeth, particularly due to Paige becoming curious about her parents' activities. Elizabeth is a protective mother, and is around for her kids when they need her most despite being absent from the house most of the day working for the KGB. Elizabeth doesn't seem to have many hobbies, but she does enjoy bowling.\n\nFormer \"Felicity\" star Russell spoke about the decision to work on another television series: \"I thought the pilot script was just so interesting. It was so far from a procedural. And [originally,] I didn't know that I wanted to do it. I always say no to everything. I never want to do anything. [Laughs.] But I just couldn't stop thinking about it. I read it...and I kept trying to figure it out, because it's so not clear. It's still not clear to me. But there's so many different levels to it.\"\n\nFor her portrayal, Russell has been nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Television Series Drama, the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series twice, three Critics' Choice Television Awards for Best Actress in a Drama Series, one Satellite Award for Best Actress in a Television Series ‚Äì Drama, one Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television, and the Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Drama.\n"}
{"id": "1180251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1180251", "title": "Ernst Troeltsch", "text": "Ernst Troeltsch\n\nErnst Peter Wilhelm Troeltsch (; 17 February 1865 ‚Äì 1 February 1923) was a German liberal Protestant theologian, writer on the philosophy of religion and the philosophy of history, and a classical liberal politician. He was a member of the history of religions school. His work was a synthesis of a number of strands, drawing on Albrecht Ritschl, Max Weber's conception of sociology, and the Baden school of Neo-Kantianism.\n\nHis \"The Social Teachings of the Christian Church\" (\"Die Soziallehren der christlichen Kirchen und Gruppen\", 1912) is a seminal work in theology.\n\nTroeltsch was born into a Lutheran family to a doctor but went to a Catholic school in a predominantly Catholic area before attending university at the University of Erlangen and then at the University of G√∂ttingen. His ordination in 1889 was followed in 1891 by a post teaching theology at G√∂ttingen. In 1892, he moved on to teach at the University of Bonn; in 1894, he moved on again to Heidelberg University. Finally, in 1915, he transferred to teach at what is now the University of Berlin where he took the title of professor of philosophy and civilization.\n\nThroughout Troeltsch's life, he wrote frequently of his belief that changes in society posed a threat to Christian religion, that \"the disenchantment of the world\" as described by sociologist Max Weber was under way. At an academic conference that took place in 1896, following a paper on the doctrine of \"logos\", Troeltsch responded by saying \"Gentlemen, everything is tottering!\"\n\nTroeltsch sought to explain the decline of religion in the modern era through a description of the historical evolution of the role of religion in society. He described European civilisation as having three periods: ancient, medieval and modern. Troeltsch's understanding of the border between the medieval and modern periods is revisionary: instead of claiming that modernity starts with the rise of Protestantism, Troeltsch argues that early Protestantism should be understood as a continuation of the medieval period. The modern period starts much later on his account, beginning only in the seventeenth century. The Renaissance in Italy and the scientific revolution planted the seeds for the arrival of the modern period, and Protestantism delayed rather than heralded its onset. Protestantism, Troeltsch argued, was \"in the first place, simply a modification of Catholicism, in which the Catholic formulation of the problems was retained, while a different answer was given to them\".\n\nTroeltsch saw this distinction between early and late (or \"neo-\") Protestantism as \"the presupposition for any historical understanding of Protestantism\".\n\nTroeltsch developed three principles pertaining to critical historiography. Each of the principles served as a philosophical retort for the issue of the preconceived notions sustained by the historian. Troeltsch's three principles - the principle of criticism, the principle of analogy, and the principle of correlation - were determined to account for the issue surrounding the biases of the historian. \n\nTroeltsch's claim in this principle concludes that absolutes within history cannot exist. Troeltsch surmised that judgments about the past must be varied. In such, the absolute truth of historical reality could not exist, rather, he claimed historical situation could only be examined as more likely or less likely to have happened. In this, Troeltsch understood to never create a finite and non-revisable claim. \n\nThis principle pertains to averting the historian from applying anachronism to the past. Troeltsch understands that the probability in the former principle can only be validated if a historians present situation, when assessing the probability, is not radically different from the past. In this, Troeltsch expects that human nature has been fairly constant throughout time, however this clause is still included as a form of accountability for the historian's narrative. \n\nIn regards to a historical events, Troeltsch determined, through this principle, humanity's historical life is interdependent upon each individual. This understanding applies a casual nature to all events, equaling thus, an effect. Any radical event, the historian should assume, effected the historical nexus immediately surrounding that event. Troeltsch determines that in historical explanation it is important to include antecedents and consequences of events. This is in an effort to maintain historical events in their conditioned time and space.\n\nTroeltsch was politically a classical liberal and served as a member of the Parliament of the Grand Duchy of Baden. In 1918, he joined the German Democratic Party (DDP). He strongly supported Germany's role in World War I: \"Yesterday we took up arms. Listen to the ethos that resounds in the splendour of heroism: To your weapons, To your weapons!\"\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Troeltsch's death, his work was considered pass√© and irrelevant. This was part of a wider rejection of liberal thought with the rise of Neo-Orthodoxy in Protestant theology, especially with the prominence of Karl Barth in the German speaking world. From 1960 onwards though, Troeltsch's thought has seen a revival of interest in academic circles with a variety of books being published on Troeltsch's theological and sociological work.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2653519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2653519", "title": "Eusapia Palladino", "text": "Eusapia Palladino\n\nEusapia Palladino (alternate spelling: \"Paladino\"; 21 January 1854 ‚Äì 16 May 1918) was an Italian Spiritualist physical medium. She claimed to possess extraordinary powers such as levitating tables and communicating with the dead through her spirit guide John King, and other related supernatural phenomena. She convinced many of her powers, but was caught in deceptive trickery throughout her career.\n\nMagicians and skeptics who evaluated her claims concluded that none of her phenomena was genuine and she was a clever trickster.\n\nHer Warsaw s√©ances at the turn of 1893‚Äì94 inspired several colorful scenes in the historical novel \"Pharaoh\", which Boles≈Çaw Prus began writing in 1894.\n\nPalladino was born into a peasant family in Minervino Murge, Bari Province, Italy. She received little, if any, formal education. Orphaned as a child, she was taken in as a nursemaid by a family in Naples. In her early life, she was married to a travelling conjuror and theatrical artist Raphael Delgaiz whose store she helped to manage. Palladino later married a wine merchant, Francesco Niola.\n\nPalladino visited Warsaw, Poland, on two occasions. Her first and longer visit was when she came at the importunities of the psychologist, Dr. Julian Ochorowicz, who hosted her from November 1893 to January 1894.\n\nRegarding the phenomena demonstrated at Palladino's s√©ances, Ochorowicz concluded against the spirit hypothesis and for a hypothesis that the phenomena were caused by a \"fluidic action\" and were performed at the expense of the medium's own powers and those of the other participants in the s√©ances.\n\nOchorowicz introduced Palladino to the journalist and novelist Boles≈Çaw Prus, who attended a number of her s√©ances, wrote about them in the press, and incorporated several Spiritualist-inspired scenes into his historical novel \"Pharaoh\".\n\nOn 1 January 1894 Palladino called on Prus at his apartment. As described by Ochorowicz,\n\nPalladino subsequently visited Warsaw in the second half of May 1898, on her way from St. Petersburg to Vienna and Munich. At that time, Prus attended at least two of the three s√©ances that she conducted (the two s√©ances were held in the apartment of Ludwik Krzywicki).\n\nIn July 1895, Palladino was invited to England to Frederic William Henry Myers's house in Cambridge for a series of investigations into her mediumship. According to reports by the investigators Myers and Oliver Lodge, all the phenomena observed in the Cambridge sittings were the result of trickery. Her fraud was so clever, according to Myers, that it \"must have needed long practice to bring it to its present level of skill.\"\n\nIn the Cambridge sittings the results proved disastrous for her mediumship. During the s√©ances Palladino was caught cheating in order to free herself from the physical controls of the experiments. Palladino was found liberating her hands by placing the hand of the controller on her left on top of the hand of the controller on her right. Instead of maintaining any contact with her, the observers on either side were found to be holding each other's hands and this made it possible for her to perform tricks. Richard Hodgson had observed Palladino free a hand to move objects and use her feet to kick pieces of furniture in the room. Because of the discovery of fraud, the British SPR investigators such as Henry Sidgwick and Frank Podmore considered Palladino's mediumship to be permanently discredited, and because of her fraud she was banned from any further experiments with the SPR in Britain. The magician John Nevil Maskelyne, who was involved in the investigation, supported Hodgson's conclusion. However, despite the evidence of fraud, Oliver Lodge considered some of her phenomena genuine.\n\nIn the \"Daily Chronicle\" on 29 October 1895, Maskelyne published a long exposure of Palladino's fraudulent methods. According to historian Ruth Brandon \"Maskelyne concluded that everything rested on the question whether Eusapia could get a hand or foot free occasionally. She wriggled so much that it was impossible to control her properly throughout. If she could get one hand, and sometimes a foot, free, everything could be explained.\"\n\nIn the \"British Medical Journal\" on 9 November 1895 an article was published titled \"Exit Eusapia!\". The article questioned the scientific legitimacy of the SPR for investigating Palladino a medium who had a reputation of being a fraud and imposture. Part of the article read \"It would be comic if it were not deplorable to picture this sorry Egeria surrounded by men like Professor Sidgwick, Professor Lodge, Mr. F. H. Myers, Dr. Schiaparelli, and Professor Richet, solemnly receiving her pinches and kicks, her finger skiddings, her sleight of hand with various articles of furniture as phenomena calling for serious study.\" This caused Henry Sidgwick to respond in a published letter to the \"British Medical Journal\" of 16 November 1895. According to Sidgwick SPR members had exposed the fraud of Palladino at the Cambridge sittings. Sidgwick wrote \"Throughout this period we have continually combated and exposed the frauds of professional mediums, and have never yet published in our Proceedings, any report in favour of the performances of any of them.\" The response from the \"BMJ\" questioned why the SPR wasted time investigating phenomena that were the \"result of jugglery and imposture\" and did not urgently concern the welfare of mankind.\n\nIn 1898, Myers was invited to a series of s√©ances in Paris with Charles Richet. In contrast to the previous s√©ances in which he had observed fraud, he now claimed to have observed convincing phenomena. Sidgwick reminded Myers of Palladino's trickery in the previous investigations as \"overwhelming\" but Myers did not change his position. This enraged Richard Hodgson, then editor of SPR publications, who banned Myers from publishing anything on his recent sittings with Palladino in the SPR journal. Hodgson was convinced Palladino was a fraud and supported Sidgwick in the \"attempt to put that vulgar cheat Eusapia beyond the pale.\" It wasn't until the 1908 sittings in Naples that the SPR reopened the Palladino file.\n\nThe British psychical researcher Harry Price, who studied Palladino's mediumship, wrote \"Her tricks were usually childish: long hairs attached to small objects in order to produce 'telekinetic movements'; the gradual substitution of one hand for two when being controlled by sitters; the production of 'phenomena' with a foot which had been surreptitiously removed from its shoe and so on.\"\n\nThe French psychical researcher Charles Richet with Oliver Lodge, Frederic William Henry Myers and Julian Ochorowicz investigated the medium Palladino in the summer of 1894 at his house in the Ile Roubaud in the Mediterranean. Richet claimed furniture moved during the s√©ance and that some of the phenomena was the result of a supernatural agency. However, Richard Hodgson claimed there was inadequate control during the s√©ances and the precautions described did not rule out trickery. Hodgson wrote all the phenomena \"described could be account for on the assumption that Eusapia could get a hand or foot free.\" Lodge, Myers and Richet disagreed, but Hodgson was later proven correct in the Cambridge sittings as Palladino was observed to have used tricks exactly the way he had described them.\n\nIn 1898, the French astronomer Eugene Antoniadi investigated the mediumship of Palladino at the house of Camille Flammarion. According to Antoniadi her performance was \"fraud from beginning to end\". Palladino tried constantly to free her hands from control and was caught lowering a letter-scale by means of a hair.\n\nFlammarion who attended s√©ances with Palladino believed that some of her phenomena was genuine. He produced in his book alleged levitation photographs of a table and an impression of a face in putty. Joseph McCabe did not find the evidence convincing. He noted that the impressions of faces in putty were always of Palladino's face and could have easily been made, and she was not entirely clear from the table in the levitation photographs.\n\nIn 1905, Eusapia Palladino came to Paris, where Nobel-laureate physicists Pierre Curie and Marie Curie and Nobel-laureate physiologist Charles Richet investigated her amongst other philosophers and scientists such as Henri Bergson and Jacques-Ars√®ne d'Arsonval. Signs of trickery were detected but they could not explain all of the phenomena.\n\nOther members of the Curies' circle of scientist friends‚Äîincluding William Crookes; future Nobel laureate Jean Perrin and his wife Henriette; Louis Georges Gouy; and Paul Langevin‚Äîwere also exploring spiritualism, as was Pierre Curie's brother Jacques, a fervent believer.\n\nThe Curies regarded mediumistic s√©ances as \"scientific experiments\" and took detailed notes. According to historian Anna Hurwic, they thought it possible to discover in spiritualism the source of an unknown energy that would reveal the secret of radioactivity. On July 24, 1905, Pierre Curie reported to his friend Gouy: \"We have had a series of s√©ances with Eusapia Palladino at the [Society for Psychical Research].\"\n\nPierre was eager to enlist Gouy. Palladino, he informed him, would return in November, and \"I hope that we will be able to convince you of the reality of the phenomena or at least some of them.\" Pierre was planning to undertake experiments \"in a methodical fashion.\" Marie Curie also attended Palladino's s√©ances, but does not seem to have been as intrigued by them as Pierre.\n\nOn 14 April 1906, just five days before his accidental death, Pierre Curie wrote Gouy about his last s√©ance with Palladino: \"There is here, in my opinion, a whole domain of entirely new facts and physical states in space of which we have no conception.\"\n\nProfessors Gustave Le Bon and Albert Dastre of Paris University examined Palladino in 1906 and concluded that she was a cheat. They installed a secret lamp behind Palladino and, at a s√©ance, saw her release and use her foot. In 1907, Palladino was found using a strand of her hair to move an object toward herself and it was noted by investigators that the objects were not outside of her easy reach.\n\nIn the late 19th century Cesare Lombroso attended s√©ances with Palladino and was convinced that she had supernatural powers. Lombroso was persuaded by Palladino's manager, Ercole Chiaia, to attend her s√©ances. Chiaia challenged the reputed scientist in an open letter in the magazine \"La Fanfulla\", pointing out that if Lombroso was unbiased and free to prejudice, he should be willing to investigate her phenomena. Lombroso's subsequent conversion was reported by the press in Italy and the world, becoming instrumental for Palladino's reaching the status of a veritable celebrity at the turn of the century.\n\nThe most extraordinary was a phenomenon that Lombroso titled \"The Levitation of the Medium to the Top of the Table.\" However, the levitations of the table were found by other investigators to be the result of fraud. According to authors William Kalush and Larry Sloman, Lombroso was having a sexual relationship with Palladino. Lombroso's daughter Gina Ferrero wrote that during the later years of his life Lombroso suffered from arteriosclerosis and his mental and physical health was wrecked. Joseph McCabe wrote that because of this it is not surprising that Palladino managed to fool him with her tricks.\n\nEnrico Morselli was also interested in mediumship and psychical research. He studied Palladino and concluded that some of her phenomena was genuine, being evidence for an unknown bio-psychic force present in all humans.\nIn 1908, the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) appointed a committee of three to examine Palladino in Naples. The committee comprised Mr. Hereward Carrington, investigator for the American Society for Psychical Research and an amateur conjurer; Mr. W. W. Baggally, also an investigator and amateur conjurer of much experience; and the Hon. Everard Feilding, who had had an extensive training as investigator and \"a fairly complete education at the hands of fraudulent mediums.\" Three adjoining rooms on the fifth floor of the Hotel Victoria were rented. The middle room where Feilding slept was used in the evening for the s√©ances. In the corner of the room was a s√©ance cabinet created by a pair of black curtains to form an enclosed area that contained a small round table with several musical instruments. In front of the curtains was placed a wooden table. During the s√©ances, Palladino would sit at this table with her back to the curtains. The investigators sat on either side of her, holding her hand and placing a foot on her foot. Guest visitors also attended some of the s√©ances; the Feilding report mentions that Professor Bottazzi and Professor Galeotti were present at the fourth s√©ance, and a Mr. Ryan was present at the eighth s√©ance.\n\nAlthough the investigators caught Palladino cheating, they were convinced Palladino produced genuine supernatural phenomena such as levitations of the table, movement of the curtains, movement of objects from behind the curtain and touches from hands. Regarding the first report by Carrington and Feilding, the American scientist and philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce wrote:\n\nFrank Podmore in his book \"The Newer Spiritualism\" (1910) wrote a comprehensive critique of the Feilding report. Podmore said that the report provided insufficient information for crucial moments and the investigators representation of the witness accounts contained contradictions and inconsistencies as to who was holding Palladino's feet and hands. Podmore found accounts among the investigators conflicted as to who they claimed to have observed the incident. Podmore wrote that the report \"at almost every point leaves obvious loopholes for trickery.\" During the s√©ances the long black curtains were often intermixed with Palladino's long black dress. Palladino told Professor Bottazzi the black curtains were \"indispensable.\" Researchers have suspected Palladino used the curtain to conceal her feet.\n\nThe psychologist C. E. M. Hansel criticized the Feilding report based on the conditions of the s√©ances being susceptible to trickery. Hansel noted that they were performed in semi-dark conditions, held in the late night or early morning introducing the possibility of fatigue and the \"investigators had a strong belief in the supernatural, hence they would be emotionally involved.\"\n\nIn 1910, Everard Feilding returned to Naples, without Hereward Carrington and W. W. Baggally. Instead, he was accompanied by his friend, William S. Marriott, a magician of some distinction who had exposed psychic fraud in \"Pearson's Magazine\". His plan was to repeat the famous earlier 1908 Naples sittings with Palladino. Unlike the 1908 sittings which had baffled the investigators, this time Feilding and Marriott detected her cheating, just as she had done in the US. Her deceptions were obvious. Palladino evaded control and was caught moving objects with her foot, shaking the curtain with her hands, moving the cabinet table with her elbow and touching the s√©ance sitters. Milbourne Christopher wrote regarding the exposure \"when one knows how a feat can be done and what to look for, only the most skillful performer can maintain the illusion in the face of such informed scrutiny.\"\n\nIn 1992, Richard Wiseman analyzed the Feilding report of Palladino and argued that she employed a secret accomplice that could enter the room by a fake door panel positioned near the s√©ance cabinet. Wiseman discovered this trick was already mentioned in a book from 1851, he also visited a carpenter and skilled magician who constructed a door within an hour with a false panel. The accomplice was suspected to be her second husband, who insisted on bringing Palladino to the hotel where the s√©ances took place. Paul Kurtz suggested that Carrington could have been Palladino's secret accomplice. Kurtz found it suspicious that he was raised as her manager after the s√©ances in Naples. Carrington was also absent on the night of the last s√©ance. However, Massimo Polidoro and Gian Marco Rinaldi who analyzed the Feilding report came to the conclusion that no secret accomplice was needed as Palladino during the 1908 Naples s√©ances could have produced the phenomena by using her foot.\n\nPalladino visited America in 1909 with Hereward Carrington as her manager. Her arrival was accompanied by a veritable campaign in the American popular press, with newspapers such as the New York Times and magazines such as the Cosmopolitan publishing numerous articles on the Italian medium.\n\nThe magician Howard Thurston attended a s√©ance and endorsed Palladino's levitation of a table as genuine. However, at a s√©ance on 18 December in New York, the Harvard psychologist Hugo M√ºnsterberg with the help of a hidden man lying under a table, caught her levitating the table with her foot. He had also observed Palladino free her foot from her shoe and use her toes to move a guitar in the s√©ance cabinet. M√ºnsterberg also claimed that Palladino moved the curtains from a distance in the room by releasing a jet of air from a rubber bulb that she had in her hand. Daniel Cohen noted that \"[Palladino] was undaunted by Munsterberg's exposure. Her tricks had been exposed many times before, yet she had prospered.\" The exposure was not taken seriously by Palladino's defenders.\n\nIn January, 1910 a series of s√©ance sittings were held at the physics laboratory at Columbia University. Scientists such as Robert W. Wood and Edmund Beecher Wilson attended. The magicians W. S. Davis, J. L. Kellogg, J. W. Sargent and Joseph Rinn were present in the last s√©ance sittings in April. They discovered that Palladino had freed her left foot to perform the phenomena. Rinn gave a full account of fraudulent behavior observed in a s√©ance of Palladino. Milbourne Christopher summarized the exposure:\n\nPalladino was offered $1000 by Rinn if she could perform a feat in controlled conditions that could not be duplicated by magicians. Palladino eventually agreed to the contest but did not turn up for it, and instead returned to Italy.\n\nIn England, America, France and Germany, Palladino had been caught utilizing tricks. Psychical researchers such as Hereward Carrington who believed some of her phenomena to be genuine, accepted that she would resort to trickery on occasion.\n\nHistorian Peter Lamont has written that although Palladino's defenders accepted that she would cheat, they \"pointed to the best evidence (where, they argued, fraud had been impossible), [but] critics argued that the investigators had simply missed it.\" On the subject of fraud and Palladino, the philosopher and skeptic Paul Kurtz wrote:\n\nIn 1910, Stanley LeFevre Krebs wrote an entire book debunking Palladino and exposing the tricks she had used throughout her career, \"Trick Methods of Eusapia Paladino\". The psychologist Joseph Jastrow, in his book \"The Psychology of Conviction\" (1918), included a chapter exposing Palladino's tricks.\n\nMagicians such as Harry Houdini and Joseph Rinn have claimed all her feats were conjuring tricks. According to Houdini \"Palladino cheated at Cambridge, she cheated in l'Agu√©las, and she cheated in New York and yet each time that she was caught cheating the Spiritualists upheld her, excused her, and forgave her. Truly their logic sometimes borders on the humorous.\"\n\nJohn Mulholland noted that \"Palladino was caught cheating times without number even by those who believed in her, and she made no bones about admitting it.\" Researchers have suspected that Palladino's first husband a travelling conjuror taught her s√©ance tricks. The magician Milbourne Christopher demonstrated Palladino's fraudulent techniques in his stage performances and on Johnny Carson's \"Tonight Show\".\n\nPalladino dictated the lighting and \"controls\" that were to be used in her mediumistic s√©ances. The fingertips of her right hand rested upon the back of the hand of one \"controller.\" Her left hand was grasped at the wrist by a second controller seated on her other side. Her feet rested on top of the feet of her controllers, sometimes beneath them. A controller's foot was in contact with only the toe of her shoe. Occasionally her ankles were tied to the legs of her chair, but they were given a play of four inches. During the sitting in semi-darkness, her ankles would become free. Generally she was unbound. In one instance, a controller cut her free so that phenomena might occur.\n\nTheodor Lipps who attended a s√©ance sitting in 1898 in Munich noticed that, instead of Palladino's hand, he held the hand of the sitter controlling the left side of the medium. In this way Palladino had freed both hands. She was also discovered using trickery by others in Germany. Max Dessoir and Albert Moll of Berlin detected the precise substitution tricks that were used by Palladino. Dessoir and Moll wrote: \"The main point is cleverly to distract attention and to release one or both hands or one or both feet. This is Paladino's chief trick\".\n\nPalladino normally refused to allow someone beneath the table to hold her feet with his hands. She refused to levitate the table from a standing position. The table being rectangular, she had to sit only at a short side. No wall of any kind could stand between Palladino and the table. The weight of the table was seventeen pounds. The table levitated to a height of 3 to 10 inches for a maximum of 2‚Äì3 seconds. She was an expert at freeing a hand or foot to produce phenomena. She chose to sit at the short side of the table so that her controllers on each side had to sit closer together, making it easier to deceive them. \n\nHer levitation of a table began by freeing one foot, rocking the table, and then slipping her toe under one leg. Since she sat at the narrow end of the table, this was made possible. She lifted the table by rocking back on the heel of this foot. She made the \"spirit\" raps by striking a leg of the table with a free foot.\n\nA photograph, taken in the dark, of a small stool that was alleged to have levitated was revealed to be sitting on Palladino's head. After she saw this photo, the stool remained immobile on the floor. A plaster impression taken of a spirit hand matched Palladino's hand. She was caught using a hair to move a scale. In the dim light, her fist, wrapped in a handkerchief, became a materialized spirit.\n\nScience historian Sherrie Lynne Lyons wrote that the glowing or light-emitting hands in s√©ances could easily be explained by the rubbing of oil of phosphorus on the hands. In 1909 an article was published in \"The New York Times\" titled \"Paladino Used Phosphorus\". Hereward Carrington confessed to having painted Palladino's arm with phosphorescent paint, however he claimed to have used the paint to track the movement of her arm, to detect fraud. There was publicity over the incident and Carrington claimed his comments had been misquoted by newspapers.\n\nThe conjuror W. S. Davis published an article (with diagrams) exposing the tricks of Palladino. Davis also speculated that she used a piece of wire that she hid in her dress to tilt the s√©ance table. Davis noted that when an attempt had been made to place a screen between her and the table she protested. Davis wrote she could not lift the table unless her dress was in contact with it and there is no obstruction between herself and the table. Physician Leonard Keene Hirshberg who attended a s√©ance, observed Palladino to have \"hook[ed] her skirt and foot into a tiny reed table behind her\" he also noted that he heard a noise that sounded like \"a piece of wire, pin, or toe-nail groping its way under the table.\"\n\nThe psychologist Millais Culpin wrote that Palladino was a conscious cheat but also had symptoms of hysterical dissociation so may have deceived herself. Laura Finch editor of the \"Annals of Psychical Science\" wrote in 1909 that Palladino had \"erotic tendencies\" and some of her male s√©ance sitters were deluded or \"glamoured\" by her presence. According to Deborah Blum, Palladino had a habit of \"climbing into the laps of the male\" investigators.\n\nM. Lamar Keene noted that \"observers said that Eusapia Palladino used to experience obvious orgasmic reactions during her s√©ances and had a marked propensity for handsome male sitters.\" In 1910, Palladino admitted to an American reporter that she cheated in her s√©ances, claiming her sitters had 'willed' her to do so. Eric Dingwall who investigated the mediumship of Palladino came to the conclusion that she was \"vital, vulgar, amorous and a cheat.\"\n\n\n"}

The case involved an employee's right to wear a religious necklace outside her clothes while working. The European Court of Human Rights awarded her damages for the UK government's failure to protect her rights.\n\nThe case has been widely reported in the UK media because various groups have argued that it shows either anti-Christian prejudice in the UK, or alternatively, favouritism towards people of faith.\n\nIn October 2006, Nadia Eweida, a Christian employee of British Airways, was asked to cover up a cross necklace which depicted a Christian cross, and was placed on unpaid leave when she refused either to do so or to accept a position where she did not have to cover it up. She was wearing the necklace on the outside of her uniform, contravening BA's uniform policy for jewellery. Eweida planned to sue the airline for religious discrimination. Some Christian groups accused British Airways of double standards, as Sikh and Muslim employees are not prevented from wearing religious garments at work, since these are impractical to cover up. Although the wearing of garments is a requirement in some faiths, in this case, British Airways believes that wearing a cross is not necessary in Christianity, in general.\n\nEweida lost an initial appeal to her employers on 20 November, but publicly stated she would continue to dispute BA's policy, and that she wished to wear the cross to manifest her religion: the BBC quoted her as saying, \"It is important to wear it to express my faith so that other people will know that Jesus loves them.\"\n\nThe National Secular Society argued it was sensible for staff handling baggage to be prohibited from wearing jewellery over their uniforms, said that Eweida was trying to evangelise in the workplace and that BA should have the right to insist that its uniform is neutral.\n\nBA, having had the same policy with regard to jewellery being worn with the uniform for a long time, with which other staff were comfortable, responded to pressure and announced on 25 November a review of its uniform policy which could allow the wearing of a lapel badge. The Archbishop of Canterbury disclosed that the issue had been raised with the Church Commissioners, who look after Anglicans' financial interests. The following day Eweida declared that this compromise was unacceptable to her.\n\nOn 28 November, the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, publicly stated that in his view the issue was not worth BA fighting and that it would be best for the airline \"just to do the sensible thing\": i.e. allow the cross to be worn.\n\nOn 19 January 2007 BA announced that they would in future allow employees to wear a symbol of faith \"openly\" on a lapel pin, \"with some flexibility ... to wear a symbol of faith on a chain\".\n\nAlthough BA changed its policy, it refused to pay Eweida for the period of her suspension. Eweida opted to pursue her case against BA at an employment tribunal, citing the original BA ruling as a form of discrimination against Christians. On 8 January 2008, after rejecting an out of court settlement offer reported at ¬£8,500, Eweida lost her case. It was rejected on the grounds that she had breached the firm's regulations without good cause. The tribunal commented that it was \"not a tribunal of faith\". The tribunal's report highlighted several other issues regarding Eweida's conduct at BA, including refusing to work on Christmas Day and telling a gay colleague that he could still be \"redeemed\". Eweida indicated that she would continue to fight her employers while retaining her position at the company.\n\nIn the Employment Appeal Tribunal, Elias J refused Ms Eweida's appeal.\n\nEweida first appealed to the Court of Appeal for a costs capping order, which was shortly refused. She then appealed on substantive grounds, which also failed in February, 2010. Sedley LJ upheld the judgment of the EAT.\n\nIn October 2010, after the Supreme Court refused to hear her case, Ms. Eweida announced her intention to seek redress in the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, the ultimate appeal court applicable to UK law.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights heard Ms. Eweida's case in September 2012, in combination with three other cases. This was against the UK government for failing to provide domestic law to protect the claimed rights, rather than against BA. In January 2013, the court found that her rights had been violated under Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights and awarded her damages of ‚Ç¨2,000 plus costs of ‚Ç¨30,000. They ruled this as they said British Airways had not reached a fair balance between Eweida's religious beliefs and the company's desire to have a particular corporate image.\n\nThe court said the following, in weighing up the merits of the case.\n\nThis case highlighted some issues around the inadequacy of UK employment equality law in dealing with religion cases. There has been a suggestion from lawyers at Lewis Silkin LLP that perhaps a better approach might be for employers to have a duty to make adjustments to accommodate religion (as currently exists in the US and Canada).\n\n\n"}

It was intended to be both a symbol of Communist power and of Berlin. It remains the latter today, as it is easily visible throughout the central and some suburban districts of Berlin. With its height of 368 metres (including antenna) it is the tallest structure in Germany, and the third-tallest structure in the European Union. Of four tallest structures in Europe, it is 2 m shorter than the Torreta de Guardamar, 0.5 m shorter than the Riga Radio and TV Tower, and 8 m taller than the Trbovlje Power Station in 2017. The structure is also more than 220 metres higher than the old Berlin Radio Tower in the western part of the city, which was built in the 1920s. \n\nIn addition to its main function as the location of several radio and television broadcasting stations, the building ‚Äì internally known as \"Fernmeldeturm 32\" ‚Äì serves as a viewing tower with observation deck including a bar at a height of 203 metres, as well as a rotating restaurant. Also, the Berlin TV Tower can be booked as a venue for events. The distinctive city landmark has undergone a radical, symbolic transformation: After German reunification, it changed from a politically charged, national symbol of the GDR into a citywide symbol of a reunited Berlin. Due to its universal and timeless design, it has increasingly been used as a trademark and is identified worldwide with Berlin and Germany. In 1979, the Berlin TV Tower received monument status by the GDR, a status which was perpetuated after the German reunification.\n\nThe tower has become one of the most prominent symbols of the country and is often in the establishing shot of films set in Berlin, alongside monuments such as the Brandenburg Gate, the Berlin Victory Column and the Reichstag building. It is also one of the ten most popular attractions in Germany with more than 1,000,000 visitors every year. Due to its location near Alexanderplatz, it is occasionally called \"Alex Tower\".\n\nThe original total height of the tower was , but it rose to after the installation of a new antenna in 1997. The Fernsehturm is the fourth tallest freestanding structure in Europe, after Moscow's Ostankino Tower, the Kiev TV Tower and the Riga Radio and TV Tower. The sphere is a visitor platform and a revolving restaurant in the middle of the sphere. The visitor platform, also called panoramic floor, is at a height of about above the ground and visibility can reach on a clear day. The restaurant Telecaf√©, which rotates once every 30 minutes, is a few metres above the visitors platform at . When first constructed, it turned once per hour; the speed was later doubled following the tower's 1997 renovation.\n\nTwo lifts transports visitors to the sphere of the tower within 40 seconds. A stairway with 986 steps also provides access, however it is not accessible by wheelchair.\n\nTo mark the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, for which the final match was played in the Berlin Olympic Stadium, the sphere was decorated as a football with magenta-coloured pentagons, reflecting the corporate colour of World Cup sponsor and owner of the Fernsehturm, Deutsche Telekom.\n\nThe Berlin TV Tower is located southwest of the Alexanderplatz station and northeast of the Marx-Engels Forum. The structure is often erroneously described as being part of the Alexanderplatz that lies to the northeast. Because of its proximity to the famous square, the TV Tower is sometimes referred to as the Alex Tower.\n\nIn addition to the Berlin U-Bahn and S-Bahn lines, several tram and bus lines stop at Alexanderplatz station, from which the middle exit leads to the entrance building of the TV Tower.\n\nThe Interhotel Stadt Berlin on Alexanderplatz, planned at the same time as the TV Tower and completed in 1970, is 125 metres high and is now operated as a Park Inn by Radisson Berlin Alexanderplatz. Between 1967 and 1972, the Rathauspassagen shopping arcade was built next to the Red Town Hall, directly south of the TV Tower.\n\nAt the European Broadcasting Conference in Stockholm in 1952, which was responsible for the coordination of frequency waves in Europe, the GDR ‚Äì not recognised politically by most countries at the time ‚Äì was only allocated two frequency channels. Under these circumstances, it was impossible to cover Berlin's urban area by multiple small broadcasting stations without interferences and thus disturbances or gaps in the broadcasting signals. For comprehensive and continuous coverage, a powerful large broadcasting facility at the highest possible location was required. In the 1950s, this task was fulfilled in Berlin by the very weak makeshift stations of Deutscher Fernsehfunk (East German broadcasting organisation).\n\nAs early as 1952, GDR's Deutsche Post began planning a TV tower for Berlin. The plans initially involved a location in the southeast of Berlin. However, the project was interrupted after construction had started, when it transpired that the site was only eight kilometres away from the Berlin Sch√∂nefeld Airport and the tower threatened to jeopardise flight operations due to its height and location at the edge of an airport corridor. After various compromise solutions failed, the construction project was discontinued in 1956. In the following years, alternatives were sought and several sites were discussed, including in Berlin Friedrichshain, but these plans also fell victim to austerity measures triggered by the high costs of building the Berlin Wall. \n\nIn the next few years, the search for a new location was continued. Alongside its actual purpose of providing the best possible broadcasting services, the role of the tower as a new landmark of Berlin was increasingly gaining significance. For this reason, in 1964 the government demanded that the tower be built at a central location, an appeal that was supported by the SED leadership. Ultimately, the choice of location was a political decision. Walter Ulbricht, leader of the Socialist Unity Party which governed East Germany, decided to allow the construction of a television tower modelled on the Fernsehturm Stuttgart and the first artificial Earth satellite, Sputnik.\n\nVarious architects were involved in the planning and implementation of the tower between 1965-69 , including Hermann Henselmann and J√∂rg Streitparth, Fritz Dieter, G√ºnter Franke and Werner Ahrendt, as well as Walter Herzog, Gerhard Kosel and Herbert Aust. The construction of the Tower resulted in the destruction of a huge portion of the historic centre of the capital of Germany. A medieval church stands next to the tower as a testament to the destruction of the old city. \n\nWork on the foundation began on 4 August 1965 and was finished by the end of 1965. The concreting of the tower foot began on 15 March 1966. The concreting progressed rapidly, so that the 100 metre mark was exceeded on 4 October 1966. The shaft reached its final height on June 16, 1967. A total of 8,000 cubic metres of concrete was used to build the shaft, which was 248.78 metres high and weighed 26,000 tons. \n\nWhile the shaft was being erected, the preliminary work for the tower ball progressed. The working group VEB Ipro had worked out the procedure for assembling the ball on the reinforced concrete shaft, according to which the ball could be pieced together from 120 separate segments on the ground. In April 1967 a 35-metre-high replica of the shaft was erected on the construction site between Marienkirche and the Red Town Hall on which the ball segments were pre-assembled. This work lasted until November 1967. The construction costs had meanwhile skyrocketed from an estimated 33 million to 95 million marks, caused mainly by components and materials that had to be paid in foreign currencies, some of which were imported from West Germany. In February 1968, the assembly of the ball on the shaft was started. The last segment of the ball was finally installed on October 7. A spike was mounted on the tower structure and the antenna structure above the ball, so that work on the interior could be started the following year. \n\nAt the beginning of 1969, water trickled into the interior of the tower, causing considerable damage; the ball had to be sealed again. Until 3 October 1969, the interior was expanded, and the entrance pavilion was completed. After 53 months of actual construction work, the tower was completed in \"record-breaking\" time in spite of all the adversities. The costs amounted to over 132 million marks.\n\nThe building, officially called the Fernseh- und UKW-Turm Berlin (Television and VHF Tower Berlin), was the world's second highest television tower in October 1969. The only TV tower that was taller was the Ostankino in Moscow. It was also the third-highest freestanding building of its time, after the tower in Moscow and the Empire State Building in New York.\n\nOn October 3, 1969, Walter Ulbricht, together with his wife Lotte and a delegation of high-ranking companions, including G√ºnter Mittag, Herbert Warnke, Paul Verner, Rudolph Schulze, Erich Honecker, Werner Lamberz and Erich Mielke, inaugurated the television tower and gave the starting signal for GDR's second state channel, DFF 2, thus launching colour TV on two channels in the GDR. The tower has been accessible to the public since October 7, 1969, Republic Day. \n\nFrom 16 February 1970, five FM programmes were broadcast from the tower; a first television programme followed on 4 April 1970. At the beginning of 1972, the two planned pavilions for exhibitions, the Berlin Information Centre, a cinema and gastronomic facilities were completed. Overall, the restaurants offered space for around 1000 guests. After the establishment of a legal basis for the preservation of monuments in 1975, the Berlin TV Tower was awarded this status in 1979. After the fall of the GDR, the Federal Republic of Germany enshrined the building's monument status. \n\nAfter German reunification in 1990, voices were raised in favour of the demolition of the tower. The Federal Republic of Germany decided to keep the building. As the new operator, Deutsche Telekom finally invested more than 50 million marks to overhaul the broadcasting facilities, and a number of renovations were also undertaken on the building. Among other things, the antenna received a new, more powerful tip from the height of 327 metres, increasing the tower's height from originally 365 metres to 368 metres in summer 1997. \n\nThe TV Tower is one of the buildings in Berlin that is illuminated by a special light installation for several days during the Festival of Lights held every year in October since 2004. On the occasion of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the tower ball was covered to make it look like a magenta football as part of an advertising campaign by the operator Telekom.\n\nWhen the sun shines on the Fernsehturm's tiled stainless steel dome, the reflection usually appears in the form of a cross. Berliners nicknamed the luminous cross \"Rache des Papstes\", or the \"Pope's Revenge\". For the same reasons, the structure was also called \"St. Walter\" (from Walter Ulbricht). U.S. President Ronald Reagan mentioned this in his \"Tear down this wall\" speech on 12 June 1987. It is also affectionately known as the \"Toothpick\" and \"Telespargel\" (TV-asparagus) due to its shape.\nThe Berlin TV Tower is not only a broadcasting tower, but also a landmark, tourist attraction and venue. The Berlin TV Tower is the highest publicly accessible building in Europe and the highest publicly accessible observation platform in Germany. The building is expected to lose its rank in 2017 when the Rottweiler Test Tower is completed and open to public. In the first three years after its inauguration, as many as four million people visited the structure. After the German reunification, the visitor average has levelled off to approximately 1.2 million from some 90 countries a year. Of these, around 60 per cent come from abroad, with Spaniards being the biggest group, accounting for 8.1 per cent, followed by Italians (7.6 per cent) and Danes (6.7 per cent). The maximum admissible number of persons inside the ball is 320 persons. Of the up to 5,000 visitors daily, about 1,500 visit the tower restaurant. In GDR times, the duration of a stay in the Tele-Caf√© was limited to 60 minutes and in the observation deck to 30 minutes.\n\nThe two visitor elevators carry 12 people each in about 40 seconds to the observation platform at 203 metres, where Berlin's highest bar is also located. From 60 windows there is a panoramic view over the whole of Berlin and the surrounding areas. The restaurant, which is located 21 steps above the observation platform at 207 metres altitude, rotates 360 degrees in an hour. For fire protection reasons, the main kitchen is located at the foot of the tower. The meals are transported by lift to the restaurant floor, where they are prepared in a small satellite kitchen. Apart from the two evacuation platforms below the tower basket, the fire protection concept includes a strict smoking ban throughout the entire structure. Wheelchair users and persons with current walking disabilities cannot visit the Berlin TV Tower, as they could not use the escape route in case of emergency. Animals, prams and large luggage can also not be admitted for safety reasons.\n\nOn 14 June 2011 ‚Äì almost 42 years after the inauguration ‚Äì the then Governing Mayor Klaus Wowereit welcomed the 50 millionth visitor. The entire city can be viewed from the observation deck of the TV Tower. If there is good visibility, the view reaches to the recreational park Tropical Islands Resort, at a distance of almost 60 kilometres.\n\nThe TV Tower, which is open all year to the public, has seasonal opening times. The last ascent to the observation platform is daily at 11.30 pm, the last admission to the restaurant is at 11 pm. The public area can be rented for special events, parties, receptions and other events with a maximum of 200 guests. Civil weddings can also be celebrated on the TV Tower. In this case, the bar area on the observation deck is reserved for an hour for the bridal couple and a wedding party of up to 30 guests.\n\n\n\nThe analogue TV service was shut down on August 4, 2003.\n\n\nhttps://tv-turm.de/en/tower-history/\n\n"}

He owned the bank Rothschild Fr√®res from 1967 to 1979, when it was nationalized by the French government, and maintained possessions in other French and foreign companies including Imerys. He was named to the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1985.\n\nBaron Guy de Rothschild was born in Paris, the son of Baron √âdouard de Rothschild (1868‚Äì1949) and his wife, the former Germaine Alice Halphen (1884‚Äì1975). He has three siblings. Guy's elder brother, √âdouard Alphonse √âmile Lionel (1906‚Äì1911), died at the age of four of appendicitis; he also had two younger sisters, Jacqueline and Bethsab√©e. Half of his great-grandparents were Rothschilds. He was a great-great grandson of the German patriarch of the Rothschild family Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1743‚Äì1812), who founded the family's banking in the 18th century in Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nHe grew up at his parents' townhouse on the corner of the rue de Rivoli and the Place de la Concorde in Paris (a property once occupied by Talleyrand and now the United States Embassy) and their country estate at Ch√¢teau de Ferri√®res, 25 miles north-east of Paris. Ch√¢teau de Ferri√®res is a massive house built to a design by Joseph Paxton in the 1850s, based on Paxton's earlier design of Mentmore Towers for Baron Mayer de Rothschild of the English branch of the Rothschild family.\n\nHe was educated at the Lyc√©e Condorcet and Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand in Paris, and by private tutors. He undertook military service with the cavalry at Saumur, and played golf for France. He won the Grand Prix de Sud-Ouest in 1948.\n\nGuy de Rothschild married twice:\n\nAfter his second marriage, Guy de Rothschild renovated the Ch√¢teau de Ferri√®res, using it to put on lavish balls in the early 1970s, before donating it to the University of Paris in 1975. The same year, he bought the H√¥tel Lambert on the √éle Saint-Louis in Paris, the top floors of which became his Paris residence.\n\nIn 1940, as a result of the German occupation of France in World War II, Guy de Rothschild's parents and sister Bethsab√©e fled France and made their way to safety in New York City. Guy de Rothschild had enlisted in the French Army and was a company commander in the 3rd Light Mechanised Division during the Battle of France in early 1940. After fighting the Nazis at Carvin, he was part of the French Army that was forced to retreat to Dunkirk. He was awarded the Croix de Guerre for his actions on the beaches at Dunkirk, from where he was evacuated to England. He immediately returned to France, landing at Brest, and taking charge of the family's office at La Bourboule, near Clermont-Ferrand.\n\nUnder the Vichy government, his father and uncles were stripped of their French nationality, removed from the register of the L√©gion d'honneur, and the family was forced to sell its possessions. Rothschild managed to persuade the buyers to grant options under which he would later be able to buy the family's interests back. He left France again, via Spain and Portugal, to join his parents in New York City. He joined the Free French Forces and boarded the cargo ship, \"Pacific Grove\", to travel back to Europe. His ship was torpedoed and sunk in March 1943, and he was rescued after spending 12 hours in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean. In England, he joined the staff of General Koenig at Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force near Portsmouth.\n\nGuy de Rothschild studied law at university then joined de Rothschild Fr√®res in 1931 when it was being run by his father and a cousin, Robert de Rothschild, who died in 1946. As part of his learning to manage the family's businesses, in 1933 he joined the executive board of their Northern Railway Company.\n\nAt the end of World War II, Guy de Rothschild returned to the bank's offices at rue Laffitte in Paris in 1944. On his father's death in 1949, Guy de Rothschild took formal control of the business. Years later, Rothschild was on the cover of the 20 December 1963 issue of TIME magazine in a story that said he took \"over the family's French bank during the disorder of war and defeat, changed its character from stewardship of the family fortune to expansive modern banking.\"\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, Guy de Rothschild served as a director of the Banque de France. On his father's death, he also inherited part of Ch√¢teau Lafite-Rothschild but did not run it.\n\nGeorges Pompidou, who would later become President and Prime Minister of France, was recruited by Guy de Rothschild from a job as a teacher, and worked for him from 1953 to 1962, during which time he became the general manager of the Rothschild bank. The bank diversified, from investment management under De Rothschild Fr√®res to the deposit-taking Banque de Rothschild, with branches throughout France. Guy was its president from 1968 to 1978. In 1968 Guy de Rothschild became a partner at N M Rothschild & Sons, London, while cousin Sir Evelyn de Rothschild was appointed a director of Banque Rothschild, Paris.\n\nIn France, Rothschild developed the country's largest private uranium mining company, the Compagnie Fran√ßaise des Minerais d'Uranium.\nIn 1961, Guy de Rothschild took over as Chairman of Imetal S.A. in which the family had a substantial stake. His involvement marked the first time any Rothschild had personally participated in the management of the business. Among its holdings, the international mining conglomerate owned Soci√©t√© Le Nickel (SLN) in New Caledonia. In 1969, SLN acquired Pe√±arroya, a Chilean based company which mined and processed lead, zinc and copper. Two years later SLN took over La Compagnie de Mokta, which specialized in iron, manganese, sand, gravel and uranium. Rothschild restructured the family's various mining interests, including Pe√±arroya which became part of SLN.\n\nIn the early 1970s the government of France began nationalizing a number of industries and after declaring nickel to be a vital market commodity, SLN's assets were nationalized in 1974 and placed under a new company, Soci√©t√© Metallurgique. The result left the Rothschild's SLN as a holding company with a fifty percent interest in Soci√©t√© Metallurgique.\n\nWhen the Rothschild's bank was nationalized in 1981 by the socialist government of Fran√ßois Mitterrand, a discouraged Guy de Rothschild left France and moved temporarily to New York City. \"A Jew under P√©tain, a pariah under Mitterrand, that's enough!\" () he wrote in a frontpage op-ed in \"Le Monde\" in 1981. Following another change in government policy, in 1987 a new banking business was established by his son David and nephew √âric, who founded Rothschild & Cie Banque.\n\nGuy de Rothschild was a renowned breeder of Thoroughbreds as the family owns Haras de Meautry in Normandy. He inherited Ch√¢teau de Reux in the horse breeding area in Lower Normandy about 125 miles north of Paris. He produced prominent race horses, the most famous perhaps was Exbury.\n\nGuy de Rothschild chaired the association of racehorse breeders in France from 1975 to 1982.\n\nAmong the major races Guy de Rothschild's horses won were:\n\nThe French Rothschild family had long been collectors of art beginning with James Mayer de Rothschild made the first significant acquisitions. Notable in his collection, Guy de Rothschild inherited Jan Vermeer's \"The Astronomer\". In 1940 the Nazis confiscated it from his father and sent it to Germany. In 1945 the painting was returned to the Rothschild family and acquired by the Louvre in 1983.\n\nIn 1950, Guy de Rothschild became the first president of the Fonds Social Juif Unifi√© (FSJU) (United Jewish Welfare Fund), the major French philanthropic agency for the Jewish community.\n\nIn 1975, Rothschild and his wife donated the Ch√¢teau de Ferri√®res to the University of Paris.\n\nWidowed in 1996, Guy de Rothschild died in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9868605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9868605", "title": "History of Shia Islam", "text": "History of Shia Islam\n\nShi‚Äòa Islam, also known as Shi‚Äòite Islam or Shi‚Äòism, is the second largest branch of Islam after Sunni Islam. Shias adhere to the teachings of Muhammad and the religious guidance of his family (who are referred to as the Ahl al-Bayt) or his descendants known as Shia Imams. Muhammad's bloodline continues only through his daughter Fatima Zahra and cousin Ali who alongside Muhammad's grandsons comprise the Ahl al-Bayt. Thus, Shias consider Muhammad's descendants as the true source of guidance. Shia Islam, like Sunni Islam, has at times been divided into many branches; however, only three of these currently have a significant number of followers, and each of them has a separate trajectory.\n\nFrom a political viewpoint the history of the Shia was in several stages. The first part was the emergence of the Shia, which starts after Muhammad's death in 632 and lasts until Battle of Karbala in 680. This part coincides with the Imamah of Ali, Hasan ibn Ali and Hussain. The second part is the differentiation and distinction of the Shia as a separate sect within the Muslim community, and the opposition of the Sunni caliphs. This part starts after the Battle of Karbala and lasts until the formation of the Shia states about 900. During this section Shi'ism divided into several branches. The third section is the period of Shia states. The first Shia state was the Idrisid dynasty (780‚Äì974) in Maghreb. Next was the Alavid dynasty (864‚Äì928) established in Mazandaran (Tabaristan), north of Iran. These dynasties were local, but they were followed by two great and powerful dynasties. The Fatimid Caliphate formed in Ifriqiya in 909, and ruled over varying areas of the Maghreb, Egypt and the Levant until 1171. The Buyid dynasty emerged in Daylaman, north of Iran, about 930 and then ruled over central and western parts of Iran and Iraq until 1048. In Yemen, Imams of various dynasties usually of the Zaidi sect established a theocratic political structure that survived from 897 until 1962.\n\nMuhammad began preaching Islam at Mecca before migrating to Medina, from where he united the tribes of Arabia into a singular Arab Muslim religious polity. With Muhammad's death in 632, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. While Ali ibn Abi Talib, his cousin and son-in-law, and the rest of Muhammad's close family were washing his body for burial, the tribal leaders of Mecca and Medina held a secret gathering at Saqifah to decide who would succeed Muhammad as head of the Muslim state, disregarding what the earliest Muslims, the [Muhajirun], regarded as Muhammad's appointment of Ali as his successor at Ghadir Khumm. Umar ibn al-Khattab, a companion of Muhammad and was first person to congratulate Ali on event of Ghadeer , nominated Abu Bakr. Others, after initial refusal and bickering, settled on Abu Bakr who was made the first caliph. This choice was disputed by Muhammad's earliest companions, who held that Ali had been designated his successor. According to Sunni accounts, Muhammad died without having appointed a successor, and with a need for leadership, they gathered and voted for the position of caliph. Shi'a accounts differ by asserting that Muhammad had designated Ali as his successor on a number of occasions, including on his death bed. Ali was supported by Muhammad's family and the majority of the Muhajirun, the initial Muslims, and was opposed by the tribal leaders of Arabia who included Muhammad's initial enemies, including, naturally, the Banu Umayya. Abu Bakr's election was followed by a raid on Ali's house led by Umar and Khalid ibn al-Walid (see Umar at Fatimah's house).\nThe succession to Muhammad is an extremely contentious issue. Muslims ultimately divided into two branches based on their political attitude towards this issue, which forms the primary theological barrier between the two major divisions of Muslims: Sunni and Shi'a, with the latter following Ali as the successor to Muhammad. The two groups also disagree on Ali's attitude towards Abu Bakr, and the two caliphs who succeeded him: Umar (or `Umar ibn al-KhattƒÅb) and Uthman or (‚ÄòUthmƒÅn ibn ‚ÄòAffƒÅn). Sunnis tend to stress Ali's acceptance and support of their rule, while the Shi'a claims that he distanced himself from them, and that he was being kept from fulfilling the religious duty that Muhammad had appointed to him. The Sunni Muslims say that if Ali was the rightful successor as ordained by God Himself, then it would have been his duty as the leader of the Muslim nation to make war with these people (Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman) until Ali established the decree. Shia claim, however, that Ali did not fight Abu Bakr, Umar or Uthman, because firstly he did not have the military strength and if he decided to, it would have caused a civil war amongst the Muslims, which was still a nascent community throughout the Arab world.\n\nShia Islam and Sunnism split in the aftermath of the death of Muhammad based on the politics of the early caliphs. Due to the Shi'a belief that Ali should have been the first caliph, the three caliphs that preceded him, Abu Bakr, Umar, and Usman, were considered illegitimate usurpers. Because of this, any hadith that were narrated by these three caliphs (or any of their supporters) were not accepted by Shi'a hadith collectors. \n\nDue to this, the number of hadith accepted by Shi'a is far less than the hadith accepted by Sunnis, with many of the non-accepted hadith being ones that had to deal with integral aspects of Islam, such as prayer and marriage. In the absence of a clear hadith for a situation, the Shi'a prefer the sayings and actions of the Imams (Prophet's family members) on the similar level as the hadith of the Prophet himself over other ways, which in turn led to the theological elevation of the Imams as being infallible.\n\nImam Ibn Hashim\n\nThe following pictures are examples of some of the Shia Islamic empires through history:\n\n\n"}

The Oromo People celebrate Irreecha to thank Waaqa (God) for the blessings and mercies they have received throughout the previous year. The thanksgiving is celebrated at the sacred grounds of Hora Harsadi (Lake Harsadi), Bishoftu, Oromia. The Irreecha festival is celebrated every year at the beginning of Birraa (Spring), new season after the dark and rainy winter season. Irrecha is celebrated in East Shewa Zone and around the world where diaspora Oromos live especially North America and Europe.\n\nThe Oromo People consider the winter rainy season of June to September as the time of difficulty. The heavy rain brings with it lots of things like swelling rivers and floods that may drown people, cattle, crop, and flood homes. Also, family relationship will severe during winter rain as they can't visit each other because of swelling rivers. In addition, winter time could be a time of hunger for some because of the fact that previous harvest collected in January is running short and new harvest is not ripe yet. Because of this, some families may endure food shortages during the winter. In Birraa (Spring in Oromoland), this shortage ends as many food crops especially maize is ripe and families can eat their fill. Other crops like potato, barley, etc. will also be ripe in Birraa. Some disease types like malaria also break out during rainy winter time. Because of this, the Oromos see winter as a difficult season. It does not mean the Oromo People hate rain or winter season at all. Even when there is shortage of rain, they pray to Waaqa (God) for rain.\n\nThe Oromo People celebrate Irreecha not only to thank Waaqa (God) but also to welcome the new season of plentiful harvests after the dark and rainy winter season associated with nature and creature. On Irreecha festivals, friends, family, and relatives gather together and celebrate with joy and happiness. Irreecha festivals bring people closer to each other and make social bonds.\n\nMoreover, the Oromo People celebrate this auspicious event to mark the end of rainy season, known as Ganna, was established by Oromo forefathers, in the time of Gadaa Melbaa in Mormor, Oromia. The auspicious day on which this last Mormor Day of Gadaa Melbaa - the Dark Time of starvation and hunger- was established on the Sunday of last week of September or the Sunday of the 1st week of October according to the Gadaa lunar calendar has been designated as National Thanksgiving Day by modern-day Oromo People.\n\nIn Waqeffannaa religion thanksgiving-Irreecha, the Qaalluus (spiritual leaders) and the Abbaa Malkaas (lineal chiefs of the areas) are at the top hierarchies. In the Qaallu religio-ethics, the Qaalluus give religious instructions and directives of the where-about and the time of the implementation of the rituals.\n\nFurthermore, in the Irreecha ritual ceremony, the Abbaa Malkaas and Abbaa Gadaas have vital roles. They lead the participating communities who follow them carrying bunch of straw and daisies in their hands praising, blessing and praying Waaqa in their songs. They order the participants what to say in the praise and prayer.\n\nAlthough this thanksgiving rituals and prayers would be accomplished at different places and time governed by its own system and portrayed by its own ritual practices, it is done at two major areas: Irreecha Malkaa and Irreecha Tulluu.\n\nAs water is the source of life, admiring creator and its creation, thanking God for the offers is what to be performed by being gathered around the rivers and environs. So the Oromo Culture and religion (Waaqeffanna) whose part is Irreecha has a concept that revolves around rain, peace and fertility.\n\nThe Oromos who live on the highland and semi highland areas start taking their cattle to Hora at this geographical and climatic juncture which is the first and a new start in their work and life routines.\n\nIn different words, the Irreecha Malkaa‚Äôs festival is celebrated every year at the beginning of Birraa (Spring), new season after the dark and rainy winter season at the bank of big rivers where the Oromos live locally. The Oromos carry straw, spices and traditional food called Bexille, circular bread like that of the Israelites‚Äô bread for the Passover to the river and eat there.\n\nSuch ritual ceremony is performed not only along the bank of a river but also around lakes and its vicinity. This Malkaa Irreecha Holiday is sometimes known as Ayyaana Birraa, the Spring Festival. It is the time when relatives, families, and clans cut apart by rivers and floods are able to meet. As a result, some still call it Xaddacha Saaquu, traditional court opening season since the judges could not sit in the court to see the cases during rainy season.\n\nAt this time particularly, mountains and meadows are covered with flowers and crops whose colors are so attractive and lavish to the farmers and pastoralists. And the season would be considered as the herald of the month of hope and prosperity. As well, it is a month of thanksgiving to Waaqa and is taken as the annually recurred culture.\n\nAfter celebrating this locally, the Oromos from every corner of Oromia and other Ethiopians come together to the sacred grounds of Hora Arsadi (Lake Arsadi), Bishoftu, Oromia which is 45 kilometres South East of Finfinne (Addis Ababa). Irrecha Malkaa is celebrated nationally in Bishoftu, East Shewa Zone and around the world where diaspora Oromos and Ethiopians live especially in North America and Europe.\n\nOrnamented with snow white interesting costumes, turbans, and hides of wild animals as well as holding spears and a special stick that bespeaks the Gada system, hundreds of thousands of celebrants from Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, the Oromo, gather at Bishoftu, Hora Arsadi, to celebrate Irreecha festival.\n\nAlmost all celebrants from both genders carry in their hands newly cut green straw that bespeak of fertility and soak it in the lake water. The Oromo's from different parts of the country for long meet flocking to celebrate and praise their creator for his blessings.\n\nEspecially, the women sing ‚ÄòMaariyoo‚Ä¶ Maareyoo‚Ä¶ meaning your mercy on us and are decorated with Caaccuu (beads of different colors), traditional costumes and Siiqqee (stick traditionally handled by oromo women). The men also hold a traditional stick called haroresa as they chant the Ireecha song with women.\n\nChildren with peer groups sing a seasonal and love song as it is a season in which the youth select their mates and exchange gifts with their friends. Lovers also express their best wishes through cultural songs on the occasion.\n\nAfter soaking the fresh lavish grass and the flower into the lake water and throwing the water to the participants, the Abbaa Malkaa, Abbaa Gaddaas and Qaallus bless the participants and make speeches on rules and regulations newly declared at the Gada handing over ceremony or assist to recall the preexisting laws.\n\nAt the end of the Irreecha Malkaa celebration, all participants sing together ‚ÄúIrreechoo yaa Irreecha Malkaa Roobaa fi Nagaa‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù to mean Thanksgiving at the river for rain and peace. All singing this go to their villages.\n\nIrreecha Malkaa marks the end of the rainy season and the beginning of spring, along with hopes for an abundant harvest. Irreecha Malkaa has been observed on the shore of Lake Hora annually for not less than a millennial.\n\nSimilarly, the Oromo People consider the winter rainy season of June to September as the time of difficulty. The heavy rain brings with it lots of things like swelling rivers and floods that may drown people, cattle, crop, and flood homes. Also, family relationship will severe during winter rain as they can't visit each other because of swelling rivers.\n\nIn addition, winter time could be a time of hunger for some because of the fact that previous harvest collected in January is running short and new harvest is not yet ripe. Because of this, some families may endure food shortages during the winter. As Birraa season approaches, this shortage ends as many food crops especially maize is ripe and families can eat their fill. Other crops like potato, barley, etc. Would also be readily available for harvest during Birraa. Some disease types like malaria also break out during rainy winter time. Because of this, the Oromos see winter as a difficult season. It does not mean the Oromo People hate rain or winter season at all. Even when there is shortage of rain, they pray to Waaqa (God) for rain.\n\nThe Oromo People celebrate Irreecha Malkaa not only to thank Waaqa (God) but also to welcome the new season of plentiful harvests after the dark and rainy winter season associated with nature and creature. On Irreecha Malkaa festivals, friends, family, and relatives gather together and celebrate with joy and happiness. Irreecha Malkaa festivals bring people closer to each other and make social bonds.\n\nMoreover, the Oromo People celebrate this auspicious event to mark the end of rainy season, known as Ganna, which was established by Oromo forefathers, in the time of Gadaa Melbaa in Mormor, Oromia. The auspicious day on which this last Mormor Day of Gadaa Melbaa - the Dark Time of starvation and hunger- was established on the Sunday of last week of September or the Sunday of the 1st week of October according to the Gadaa lunar calendar has been designated as National Thanksgiving Day by modern-day Oromo People.\n\nIrreecha Tullu is the thanksgiving ceremony that is performed at the top of mountains or hills during dry season, bona in Afaan Oromo. It is performed at the beginning of the spring season usually in March.\n\nThe last three months were sunny, when both men and cattle suffered from drought, especially shortage of water and grasses. So it is the time when the Oromo living in the vicinity are gathered to pray to their Waaqa, God the creator and giver, to give them rain. Especially, if there is a delay in rain and it seems that the sky seems rain cloudless, the Qalluus and Elders know it, the leaders call for Iyya Boka, Rain Screaming. All the villagers scream ‚Äòrain‚Äô to Waaqa, God the creator and giver, to get rain for planting crops and grasses to grow.\n\nThis particular solitary place is characterized by moisture conducive for praying. This ritual and ceremonial practice is said to have closely related to the worship practiced by the ancient settlers of peoples of the Nile Valley.\n"}

Processions called Azadari () are held to commemorate and remember the events that took place, these are often organised by congregation halls known as \"Hussainia\". Mourning climaxes on the tenth day of Muharram, Ashura. The mourning is sometimes referred to as the \"Remembrance of Muharram\" ().\n\nThe mourning that takes place during Muharram in Bahrain has a long history in the country, having been practiced for centuries, and the month sees a massive influx of visitors from neighbouring Persian Gulf countries, who spectate or participate in the mourning processions.\nWhat makes Bahrain special in the Persian Gulf area is that Hussaini processions are allowed on the streets; a reason why Shia‚Äôs in region to travel to Bahrain during Muharram.\n\nThe event marks the anniversary of the Battle of Karbala when Imam Hussein ibn Ali, the grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and a Shia Imam, was killed by the forces of the second Umayyad caliph Yazid I. The month-long occasion is marked by arranging a series of daily gatherings, where a cleric would to deliver sermons on Islamic teachings and Imam Hussain's life. The mourning itself reaches its climax on the tenth day of Muharram, known as Ashura, on which the Umayyad army killed the 72 combatants who fought, including Imam Hussain, his family and close supporters. The women and children left living were made prisoners and transported to Yazid's court in Damascus.\n\nThe first outdoor Muharram procession in Bahrain is reported to have taken place in Manama in 1891, led by Mirza Muhammad Ismail, the local agent for the British-India Steam Navigation Company. Historian Nelida Fuccaro describes the event as:\nThis was a momentuous even for Manama's Shi'is. People flocked behind a heavily armed Mirza Isma'il who proudly made his way through Manama's streets in defiance of the veto imposed by the rulers on public manifestations of Shi'i devotion.\n\nIn the 1950s, when Bahrain saw the rise of a nationalist movement, the procession of the ma'tam (Hussainia) of Ras Rumman marched chanting nationalist slogans preceded by the banner of Gamal Abdel Nasser's Egypt.\n\nThe oldest and most distinguished of the mawatim (sing. ma'tam) in Bahrain are located in the Fareej el-Makharqa quarter of central Manama and were constructed at the turn of the 19th Century. This includes Matam al-Ajam al-Kabeer, Matam Bin Rajab, Bin Zabar, Madan, Sallum, Al Mudaifa, Al Arrayed, Al Qassab, and al Hajj Khalaf.\n\nMuharram in Bahrain is unique, as it is the only Arab country in the Persian Gulf region that has a Shia Muslim majority. It has been estimated that thousands of Gulf nationals visit Bahrain during Ashura to participate in the religious processions. Although official statistics in 2009 show that only 1,100 matams (ŸÖÿ£ÿ™ŸÖ) are officially registered in the country, it is believed that there are up to 5,000 matams, including both registered and unregistered.\n\nProcessions (Azadari) occur on an almost-daily basis during the month. Different varieties of the processions exist: Some processions consist of participants beating the chests, others with self-flagellations with chains and hitting oneself with swords or knives (called \"Haidar\"). Passion plays and reenactments of the Day of Ashura are also performed.\n\nAshura is a two-day public holiday in Bahrain, occurring on the ninth and tenth days of Muharram, respectively (though dates vary on the Gregorian calendar). According to the government sources, the Bahraini government ‚Äûactively donates food and funds‚Äù to matams during the month-long event.\n\nA matam is a Shia congregation hall, also called as a Hussainia.

The image, a Black Madonna that represents the Immaculate Conception, is enshrined in Antipolo Cathedral in the Sierra Madre mountains east of Metro Manila.\n\nThe image was brought to the country by Governor-General Juan Ni√±o de Tabora from Mexico via the galleon \"El Almirante\" in 1626. His safe voyage across the Pacific Ocean was attributed to the image, which was given the title of \"Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage\". It was substantiated later by six other successful voyages of the Manila-Acapulco Galleons with the image aboard as its patroness.\n\nThe statue is one of the most celebrated images of the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Philippines, gaining devotees since the mid-19th century, having been mentioned by Jos√© Rizal in his writings. From May to July each year, the image attracts millions of pilgrims from all over the country and abroad. Pope Pius XI authorized her canonical coronation on 13 June 1925, which occurred on 28 November 1926.\n\nOn 25 March 1626, the galleon trading ship \"El Almirante\" left Acapulco, Mexico, carrying the newly appointed Governor-General of the Spanish East Indies, \"Don\" Juan Ni√±o de Tabora, who brought with him the statue. He arrived in Manila on 18 July 1626, and the statue was brought to San Ignacio Church of the Jesuits in Intramuros. When Governor Tabora died in 1632, the statue was given to the Jesuits for enshrinement in the church of Antipolo, which was then being built in the present-day barangay Santa Cruz. \n\nDuring construction of the Antipolo church in the 1630s, the image would mysteriously vanish several times from its shrine, only to reappear atop a \"tipolo\" (breadfruit tree; \"Artocarpus incisa\"). This was taken as a celestial sign, and the church was relocated to where the \"tipolo\" tree stood. The image's pedestal is supposedly made from the trunk of that same \"tipolo\" tree, which also gave its name to Antipolo itself.\n\nIn 1639 the Chinese rose in revolt, burning the town and the church. Fearing for the statue's safety, Governor Sebasti√°n Hurtado de Corcuera ordered its transfer to Cavite, where it was temporarily enshrined. Governor Hurtado later ordered the statue removed from its Cavite shrine in 1648, and it was shipped back to Mexico aboard the galleon \"San Luis\". At the time, the statue of a saint onboard served as a ship's patron saint or protector of the Acapulco trade.\nThe statue crossed the Pacific six times aboard the following Manila-Acapulco galleons:\n\nA royal decree by Queen Isabella II on 19 May 1864 ordered that the curias of San Nicolas de Tolentino be turned over to the Jesuits in exchange for the curias of Antipolo, Taytay and Morong, which were given to the Augustinian Recollects. The latter order thus came into possession of the image.\n\nIn 1944, the Japanese Imperial Army invaded the town and turned it into a garrison, with the shrine being used as an arsenal. To save the image, the church's head sacristan, Procopio √Ångeles, wrapped it in a thick woollen blanket and placed it in an empty petrol drum, which he then buried in a nearby kitchen.\n\nFighting between Imperial Japanese troops and the combined American and Filipino forces drove √Ångeles and other devotees to exhume the image and move it to Kulaiki Hill on the border with Angono. From there, it was spirited away to the lowland Barangay Santolan in Pasig, and then to the town center of Pasig itself. The statue was then kept by Rosario Alejandro (\"n√©e\" Ocampo), daughter of Pablo Ocampo, at the Ocampo-Santiago family residence on Hidalgo Street, Quiapo, Manila, before it was enshrined inside Quiapo Church for the remainder of the Second World War.\n\nOn 15 October 1945, the statue was translated back to its church in Antipolo, where it remains today. \n\nThe statue was canonically crowned by the Archbishop of Manila, Rev. Michael J. O'Doherty, on 28 November 1926 in Luneta (present-day Rizal Park), Manila.\n\nThe first missionaries in Antipolo were the Franciscans, who arrived in the vicinity in 1578. The Jesuits then followed and administered the church from 1591 until May 1768, when the decree expelling the Jesuits from Spanish lands reached Manila. \n\nThe church was greatly damaged during the Chinese uprising of 1639, the 1645 Luzon earthquake, and the earthquakes of 1824 and 1883. Notable Filipino historians such as Pedro Chirino and Pedro Murillo Velarde (also a prominent cartographer) ministered at the church.\n\nThe Diocese of Antipolo was created on 24 January 1983 and was canonically erected on 25 June 1983 at the diocese‚Äôs new see, which bears the formal title of ‚ÄúCathedral-National Shrine of Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage‚Äù.\n\nPilgrimages to the image's shrine begin and peak in May, which in Catholicism is dedicated to the Virgin Mary. On 30 April‚Äîthe eve of May Day‚Äî thousands of devotees from Metro Manila customarily perform the \"Alay Lakad\" (literally, ‚ÄúWalk Offering‚Äù), where pilgrims spend the night travelling on foot to the shrine, where they hear Mass at dawn.\n\nThe farthest official starting point of the modern pilgrimage is Quiapo Church; the custom of visiting the shrine in May, however, was already recorded by the 19th century. On 6 June 1868, a young Jos√© Rizal and his father \"Don\" Francisco Mercado, visited the shrine in thanksgiving after the boy and his mother, Teodora Alonso, survived his delivery in 1861.\n\nIn December 2011, the Eternal Word Television Network programme \"Mary: Mother of the Philippines\" ran an episode showcasing the statue as the ‚ÄúMost traveled Marian Icon in the Philippines‚Äù.\n\n\n"}

Although Buddha Maitreya is commonly depicted as an Indian figure, all of the characters in The Paradise of Maitreya are found to be wearing Chinese robes and clothing.\n\nThe piece foretells the coming of the coming of the Buddha Maitreya, who is said to appear on Earth in its darkest hour to save humanity from samsara. The royal family depicted in the painting is gathering the first assembly; leading 84,000 newly converted followers into salvation. Both the king and the queen have bald, shaven heads, which, in Buddhist culture, represents turning towards enlightenment and nirvana.\n\nThe famed painter and Buddhist monk, Zhu Haogu (Êú±Â•ΩÂè§), along with his pupil Zhang Boyuan (Âºµ‰ºØÊ∑µ), created the dry fresco painting on the southwestern portion of the Xinghua Si (ËààÂåñÂØ∫) monastery during China‚Äôs Yuan dynasty.

From there, a light carbon ink and colour pigments were used to create the image, which would have been copied from a smaller-scale version.\n\nDuring the 1920s, the various armies of the Chinese warlords would often plunder small villages in search of valuable goods. Fearing The Paradise of Maitreya was in danger of theft, the monks of Xinghua Si removed the work from the wall and partitioned it into 63 pieces so that it could be securely stored and hidden in Taiyuan. While the painting survived the plundering, it faced environmental threats from fire and draught in its new location. Instead of allowing the work to undergo further degradation, the monks began approaching art dealers, hoping to sell it.\n\nIn 1928, Anglican Bishop William White (Bishop of Honan) heard of the sale and proceeded to purchase the painting. Over the following 5¬†year period, the piece was shipped from Taiyuan to Tianjin, then taken via American Express to Boston, and from there was taken to Toronto and the Royal Ontario Museum by train.\n\nWhile the painting suffered notable damage following its removal from the Xinghua si monastery, restoration efforts made by the ROM have led The Paradise of Maitreya to become one of the best preserved pieces from the Yuan dynasty.\n\nRestoration on the piece commenced in 1933 with structural treatment to reassemble the 63 panels the painting was partitioned into. During the work‚Äôs movement, a significant amount of degradation had occurred, causing loss and disfigurement. After the initial restoration was completed, George Stout mounted the painting on the north wall of the ROM‚Äôs Bishop White Gallery. It was placed on Masonite panels developed at the Fogg Art Museum using a polyvinyl acetate resin.\n\nAs part of a museum-wide restoration effort put on by the ROM in 2005, \"The Paradise of Maitreya\" received further attention addressing surface and structural issues. Plastazote LD45 was used to undertake general breakdowns in the joint material of the Masonite panels for its flexibility and imperviousness to humidity.\n\nWhile \"The Paradise of Maitreya\" arrived in the ROM in 1933, it wasn‚Äôt until 1940 when Bishop William C. White became the first to propose a date for the painting. A team of students commissioned by White discovered the painting appeared to bear an inscription dictating it was completed on the 14th day of the mid-autumn moon of \"qingshen\". White believed this gave an age that was too young for the painting and that his students had therefore interpreted the inscription incorrectly. Instead, he believed the inscription read the painting was completed in \"wuzu\", not \"qingshen\", which he claimed would date it to be from 1238.\n\nLudwig Bachhofer later researched the painting and found an additional inscription quoting ‚Äúda Yuan guo‚Äù (the great Yuan state). As this title was not used in Yuan until 1271, it made the painting‚Äôs date of 1238 inaccurate. He agreed that the painting bore the inscription \"wuzu\", not \"qingshen\", however, as these characters were reused on a 60-year cycle, he instead believed the term \"wuzu\" was referring to the year 1298.\n\nAs most of the painting‚Äôs inscriptions were not transported to the ROM from China and the Xinghua si monastery fell to ruins in 1938, it is impossible to get a full record of the painting‚Äôs background information. Both White and Bachlofer made assumptions in their findings and as such, neither has been able to make a full claim on the painting‚Äôs date. As such, \"The Paradise of Maitreya\" remains the most controversial painting from the Yuan dynasty.\n\n"}

{"id": "419467", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=419467", "title": "Religion in the Philippines", "text": "Religion in the Philippines\n\nReligion in the Philippines is marked by a majority of people being adherents of the Christian faith. At least 92% of the population is Christian; about 81% belong to the Roman Catholic Church while about 11% belong to Protestant, Orthodox, Restorationist and Independent Catholic denominations, such as Iglesia Filipina Independiente, Iglesia ni Cristo, Seventh-day Adventist Church, United Church of Christ in the Philippines and Evangelicals. Officially, the Philippines is a secular nation, with the Constitution guaranteeing separation of church and state, and requiring the government to respect all religious beliefs equally.\n\nAccording to national religious surveys, about 5.6% of the population of the Philippines is Muslim, making Islam the second largest religion in the country. However, A 2012 estimate by the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) stated that there were 10.7 million Muslims, or approximately 11 percent of the total population. Most Muslims live in parts of Mindanao, Palawan, and the Sulu Archipelago ‚Äì an area known as Bangsamoro or the Moro region. Some have migrated into urban and rural areas in different parts of the country. Most Muslim Filipinos practice Sunni Islam according to the Shafi'i school. There are some Ahmadiyya Muslims in the country.\n\nPhilippine traditional religions are still practiced by an estimated 2% of the population, made up of many indigenous peoples, tribal groups, and people who have reverted into traditional religions from Catholic/Christian or Islamic religions. These religions are often syncretized with Christianity and Islam. Animism, folk religion, and shamanism remain present as undercurrents of mainstream religion, through the \"albularyo\", the \"babaylan\", and the \"manghihilot\". Buddhism is practiced by 2% of the populations by the Japanese-Filipino community, and together with Taoism and Chinese folk religion is also dominant in Chinese communities. There are smaller number of followers of Sikhs, Hinduism, and Judaism, and Baha'i. More than 10% of the population is non-religious, with the percentage of non-religious people overlapping with various faiths, as the vast majority of the non-religious select a religion in the Census for nominal purposes.\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, Evangelicals comprised 2% of the population, however 2010 surveys and data such Joshua Project and Operation World estimated the evangelical population to be around 11‚Äì13% of the population. It is particularly strong among American and Korean communities, Northern Luzon especially in Cordillera Administrative Region, Southern Mindanao and many other tribal groups in the Philippines. Protestants both mainline and evangelical have gained significant annual growth rate up to 10% since 1910 to 2015.\n\nThe Philippine Statistics Authority in October 2015 reported that % of the total Filipino population were Roman Catholics, 10.8% were Protestant and % were Muslims.\n\nDuring pre-colonial times, a form of animism was widely practiced in the Philippines. Each of the ethno-linguistic tribe in the archipelago practices a distinct indigenous religion. Today, the Philippines is mostly Catholic and other forms of Christianity, and only a handful of the indigenous tribes continue to practice the old traditions. These are a collection of beliefs and cultural mores anchored more or less in the idea that the world is inhabited by spirits and supernatural entities, both good and bad, and that respect be accorded to them through nature worship. These spirits all around nature are known as \"diwatas\", showing cultural relationship with Hinduism (Devatas). Currently, there are 135 ethno-linguistic tribes in the Philippines according to the Komisyon ng Wikang Filipino. Less than half of which still practice indigenous religions which have been used prior to Spanish colonialism.\n\nSome worship specific deities, such as the Tagalog supreme deity, Bathala, and his children Adlaw, Mayari, and Tala, or the Visayan deity Kan-Laon. Others practice Ancestor worship (\"anitos\"). Variations of animistic practices occur in different ethnic groups. Magic, chants and prayers are often key features. Its practitioners were highly respected (and some feared) in the community, as they were healers, midwives (\"hilot\"), shamans, witches and warlocks (\"mangkukulam\"), priests/priestesses (\"babaylan/katalonan\"), tribal historians and wizened elders that provided the spiritual and traditional life of the community. In the Visayan regions, shamanistic and animistic beliefs in witchcraft (\"barang\") and mythical creatures like \"aswang\" (vampires), \"duwende\" (dwarves), and \"bakonawa\" (a gigantic sea serpent), may exist in some indigenous peoples alongside more mainstream Christian and Islamic faiths.\n\nSpanish missionaries during the 16th century arrived in the Philippines noted warrior priestesses leading tribal spiritual affairs. Many were condemned as pagan heretics. Although suppressed, these matriarchal tendencies run deep in Filipino society and can still be seen in the strong leadership roles modern Filipino women are assuming in business, politics, academia, the arts and in religious institutions.\n\nNominally animists constitute about one percent of the population. But animism's influence pervade daily life and practice of the colonial religions that took root in the Philippines. Elements of folk belief melded with Christian and Islamic practices to give a unique perspective on these religions.\n\nJust like the way Hinduism and Shintoism started, where they began as a collection of different indigenous belief systems from different ethnic groups, the indigenous belief systems of the Philippines are sometimes referred to as \"Dayawism\". The term itself came from the word, 'dayaw', which is an indigenous word found in all indigenous languages in the country. The term means to give praise, to be proud of oneself and the nation the self represents, enhancements or improvements, or festivity and pride, depending on the language. Other terms used for the collection of Philippine indigenous religions are \"Anitism\" and \"Bathalism\", although the two terms are Tagalog-centrist in terminology.\n\nDue to the influx of Christianity, Islam, and other world religions in traditional communities, the indigenous practices, rituals, and spiritual performances and knowledge of indigenous Filipinos are fast disappearing. Cultural workers in the country suggest the Paiwan Model, which was made by the Taiwanese government to preserve indigenous religions, to save the Philippines' own indigenous religions. The indigenous practices and shamanism of the Paiwan people of Taiwan was the fastest declining religion in the country. This prompted the Taiwanense government to preserve the religion and to push for the establishment of the Paiwan School of Shamanism where religious leaders teach their apprentices the native religion so that it will never be lost. It became an effective medium in preserving, and even uplifting the Paiwan people's indigenous religion.\n\nIn the Philippines, shamanism is referred as \"dayawism\", meaning 'gallant religions that give thanks to all living and non-living things'. As of 2018, there is no established \"school of dayawism\" in the Philippines, making the hundreds of indigenous religions in the country in great peril from extinction due to the influx of colonial-era religions. Each indigenous religion in the Philippines is distinct from each other, possessing unique epics, pantheons, belief systems, and other intangible heritage pertaining to religious beliefs. Due to this immense diversity in indigenous religions, a singular school of dayawism is not feasible. Rather, hundreds of schools of dayawism pertaining to an ethno-linguistic tribe is a better supplement to the current religious landscape in the Philippines.\n\nThe Bah√°'√≠ Faith in the Philippines started in 1921 with the first Bah√°'√≠ first visiting the Philippines that year, and by 1944 a Bah√°'√≠ Local Spiritual Assembly was established. In the early 1960s, during a period of accelerated growth, the community grew from 200 in 1960 to 1000 by 1962 and 2000 by 1963. In 1964 the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√°'√≠s of the Philippines was elected and by 1980 there were 64,000 Bah√°'√≠s and 45 local assemblies. The Bah√°'√≠s have been active in multi/inter-faith developments. The 2005 World Christian Encyclopedia estimates the Bah√°'√≠ population of the Philippines at about 247,500.\n\nNo written record exists about the early Buddhism in the Philippines. However, archaeological discoveries and the few scant references in the other nations' historical records can tell about the existence of Buddhism from the 9th century onward in the islands. These records mention the independent states that comprise the Philippines and which show that they were not united as one country in the early days. Archaeological finds include Buddhist artifacts. The style are of Vajrayana influence.\n\nLoanwords with Buddhist context appear in languages of the Philippines. Archaeological finds include Buddhist artifacts. The style are of Vajrayana influence.\nThe Philippines's early states must have become the tributary states of the powerful Buddhist Srivijaya empire that controlled the trade and its sea routes from the 6th century to the 13th century in Southeast Asia. The states's trade contacts with the empire long before or in the 9th century must have served as the conduit for introducing Vajrayana Buddhism to the islands.\n\nBoth Srivijaya empire in Sumatra and Majapahit empire in Java were unknown in history until 1918 when the Ecole Francaise d'Extreme Orient's George Coedes postulated their existence because they had been mentioned in the records of the Chinese Tang and Sung imperial dynasties. Ji Ying, a Chinese monk and scholar, stayed in Sumatra from 687 to 689 on his way to India. He wrote on the Srivijaya's splendour, \"Buddhism was flourishing throughout the islands of Southeast Asia. Many of the kings and the chieftains in the islands in the southern seas admire and believe in Buddhism, and their hearts are set on accumulating good action.\"\n\nBoth empires replaced their early Theravada Buddhist religion with Vajrayana Buddhism in the 7th century.\n\nThe Philippines's archaeological finds include a few of Buddhist artifacts, most of them dated to the 9th century. The artifacts reflect the iconography of the Srivijaya empire's Vajrayana Buddhism and its influences on the Philippines's early states. The artifacts's distinct features point to their production in the islands and they hint at the artisans's or goldsmiths's knowledge of the Buddhist culture and the Buddhist literature because the artisans have made these unique works of Buddhist art. The artifacts imply also the presence of the Buddhist believers in the places where these artifacts turned up. These places extended from the Agusan-Surigao area in Mindanao island to Cebu, Palawan, and Luzon islands. Hence, Vajrayana Buddhism must have spread far and wide throughout the archipelago. And Vajrayana Buddhism must have become the religion of the majority of the inhabitants in the islands.\n\nIn 1225, China's Zhao Rugua, a superintendent of maritime trade in Fukien province wrote the book entitled \"Zhu Fan Zhi\" () in which he described trade with a country called Ma-i in the island of Mindoro in Luzon,(pronounced \"Ma-yi\") which was a prehispanic Philippine state. In it he said:\n\nThe gold statue of the deity Tara is the most significant Buddhist artifact. In the Vajrayana Buddhist tradition, Tara symbolizes the Absolute in its emptiness as the wisdom heart's essence that finds its expression through love and through compassion. The Vajrayana tradition also tells about the outpouring of the human heart's compassion that manifests Tara and about the fascinating story of the Bodhisattva of Compassion shedding a tear out of pity for the suffering of all sentient beings when he hears their cries. The tear created a lake where a lotus flower emerges. It bears Tara who relieves their sorrow and their pain.\n\nThe Golden Tara was discovered in 1918 in Esperanza, Agusan and it has been kept in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois since the 1920s. Henry Otley Beyer, the Philippines's pioneer anthropologist-archaeologist, and some experts have agreed on its identity and have dated it to belong within 900-950 CE, which covers the Sailendra period of the Srivijaya empire. They can not place, however, the Golden Tara's provenance because it has distinct features.\n\nIn the archipelago that was to become the Philippines, the statues of the Hindu gods were hidden to prevent their destruction by a religion which destroyed all cult images. One statue, a \"Golden Tara\", a 4-pound gold statue of a Hindu-Malayan goddess, was found in Mindanao in 1917. The statue, denoted the \"Agusan Image\", is now in the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago. The image is that of a Hindu-Malayan female deity, seated cross-legged. It is made of \"twenty-one carat gold and weighs nearly four pounds.\" It has a richly ornamented headdress and many ornaments in the arms and other parts of the body. Scholars date it to the late 13th or early 14th century. It was made by local artists, perhaps copying from an imported Javanese model. The gold that was used was from this area, since Javanese miners were known to have been engaged in gold mining in Butuan at this time.\n\nThe existence of these gold mines, this artefact and the presence of \"foreigners\" proves the existence of some foreign trade, gold as element in the barter economy, and of cultural and social contact between the natives and \"foreigners.\" As previously stated, this statue is not in The Philippines. Louise Adriana Wood (whose husband, Leonard Wood, was military-governor of the Moro Province in 1903-1906 and governor general in 1921-1927) raised funds for its purchase by the Chicago Museum of Natural History. It is now on display in that museum's Gold Room.\n\nAccording to Prof. Beyer, considered the \"Father of Philippine Anthropology and Archaeology\", a woman in 1917 found it on the left bank of the Wawa River near Esperanza, Agusan, projecting from the silt in a ravine after a storm and flood. From her hands it passed into those of Bias Baklagon, a local government official. Shortly after, ownership passed to the Agusan Coconut Company, to whom Baklagon owed a considerable debt. Mrs. Wood bought it from the coconut company.\n\nA golden statuette of the Hindu-Buddhist goddess Kinnara found in an archeological dig in Esperanza, Agusan del Sur.\nThe Philippines's archaeological finds include many ancient gold artifacts. Most of them have been dated to belong to the 9th century iconography of the Srivijaya empire. The artifacts's distinct features point to their production in the islands. It is probable that they were made locally because archaeologist Peter Bellwood discovered the existence of an ancient goldsmith's shop that made the 20-centuries-old lingling-o, or omega-shaped gold ornaments in Batanes. Archaeological finds include Buddhist artifacts. The style are of Vajrayana influence.\n\nThe other finds are the garuda, the mythical bird that has been common to Buddhism and Hinduism, and several Padmapani images. Padmapani has been also known as Avalokitesvara, the enlightened being or Bodhisattva of Compassion.\n\nSurviving Buddhist images and sculptures are primarily found in and at Tabon Cave.\nRecent research conducted by Philip Maise has included the discovery of giant sculptures, has also discovered what he believes to be cave paintings within the burial chambers in the caves depicting the Journey to the West.\n\nMany Filipino customs have strong Buddhist influences. Estimates of the Buddhist population of the Philippines is around 2%. There are temples in Manila, Davao, and Cebu, and other places. Several schools of Buddhism are present in the Philippines ‚Äì Mahayana, Vajrayana, Theravada, as well as groups such as Soka Gakkai International.\n\nChristianity arrived in the Philippines with the landing of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. In the late 16th century, the archipelago was claimed for Spain and named it after its king. Missionary activity during the country's colonial rule by Spain and the United States led the transformation of the Philippines into the first and then, along with East Timor, one of two predominantly Catholic nations in East Asia, with approximately 92.5% of the population belonging to the Christian faith.\n\nRoman Catholicism is the predominant religion and the largest Christian denomination, with estimates of approximately 80.6% of the population belonging to this faith in the Philippines. The country has a significant Spanish Catholic tradition, and Spanish style Catholicism is embedded in the culture, which was acquired from priests or friars.\n\nThe Catholic Church has great influence on Philippine society and politics. One typical event is the role of the Catholic hierarchy during the bloodless People Power Revolution of 1986. Then-Archbishop of Manila and \"de facto\" Primate of the Philippines, Jaime Cardinal Sin appealed to the public via radio to congregate along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue in support of rebel forces. Some seven million people responded to the call between 22‚Äì25 February, and the non-violent protests successfully forced President Ferdinand E. Marcos out of power and into exile in Hawaii.\n\nSeveral Catholic holidays are culturally important as family occasions, and are observed in the civil calendar. Chief among these are Christmas, which includes celebrations of the civil New Year, and the more solemn Holy Week, which may occur in March or April. Every November, Filipino families celebrate All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day as a single holiday in honour of the saints and the dead, visiting and cleaning ancestral graves, offering prayers, and feasting. As of 2018, Feast of the Immaculate Conception on December 8 was added as a special non-working holiday.\n\n\nIglesia ni Cristo (; ) is the largest entirely indigenous-initiated religious organisation in the Philippines comprising roughly 2% of religious affiliation in the Philippines. Felix Y. Manalo officially registered the church with the Philippine Government on July 27, 1914 and because of this, most publications refer to him as the founder of the church. Felix Manalo claimed that he was restoring the church of Christ that was lost for 2,000 years. He died on April 12, 1963, aged 76.\n\nThe Iglesia ni Cristo is known for its large evangelical missions. The largest of which was the Grand Evangelical Mission (GEM) which also occurred simultaneously on 19 sites across the country. In Manila site alone, more than 600,000 people attended the event. Other programs includes the \"Lingap sa Mamamayan\" (Aid to Humanity), The \"Kabayan Ko Kapatid Ko\" (My Countrymen, My Brethren) and various resettlement projects for affected individuals.\n\nThe Jesus Miracle Crusade International Ministry (JMCIM) is an apostolic Pentecostal religious group from the Philippines which believes in the gospel of Jesus Christ with signs, wonders, miracles and faith in God for healing. JMCIM was founded by evangelist Wilde E. Almeda on February 14, 1975.\n\nMembers Church of God International (Filipino: \"Mga Kasapi Iglesia ng Dios Internasyonal\") is a religious organization popularly known through its television program, \"Ang Dating Daan\" (Tagalog for \"The Old Path\").\n\nThe church is known for their \"Bible Expositions\", where guests and members are given a chance to ask any biblical question to the Overall Servant of the church, Eliseo Soriano directly from the Bible. He and his co-servants expose teachings of asked religions which are not biblical and expands more knowledge about some misunderstood verses by using old manuscripts and reliable bible translations. \nBesides general preaching, they also established charity works. Among these humanitarian services are the charity homes for the senior citizens and orphaned children and teenagers; transient homes; medical missions; full college scholarship; start-up capital for livelihood projects; vocational trainings for the differently-abled; free legal assistance; free bus, jeepney, and train rides for commuters and senior citizens, and; free Bible for everyone. In its effort to save lives, MCGI is now one of the major blood donor in the Philippines, as acknowledged by the Philippine National Red Cross.\n\nThe Most Holy Church of God in Christ Jesus (Filipino: \"Kabanalbanalang Iglesia ng Dios kay Kristo Hesus\"), is an independent Christian denomination officially registered in the Philippines by Teofilo D. Ora in May 1922. The Church claims to restore the visible Church founded in Jerusalem by Christ Jesus. It has spread to areas including California, USA; Calgary, Canada, Dubai, UAE and other Asian countries. The Church will be celebrating its centennial anniversary in May 2022.\n\nThe church was founded by Bishop Teofilo D. Ora in 1922. He, along with Avelino Santiago and Nicolas Perez, split off from the Iglesia ni Cristo (Church of Christ) in 1922. They initially called their church \"Iglesia Verdadera de Cristo Hesus\" (True Church of Christ Jesus). However, following a religious doctrine controversy, Nicolas Perez split off from the group and registered an offshoot called \"Iglesia ng Dios kay Kristo Hesus, Haligi at Suhay ng Katotohanan\" (Church of God in Christ Jesus, the Pillar and Support of the Truth). Teofilo D. Ora was bishop until his death in 1969. He was officially succeeded by Bishop Salvador C. Payawal who led the church until 1989. Subsequent bishops were Bishop Gamaliel T. Payawal (1989 to 2003) and Bishop Isagani N. Capistrano (2003‚Äìpresent). It was during Gamaliel Payawal's tenure when the church was renamed as \"Most Holy Church of God in Christ Jesus\".\n\nThe Philippine Independent Church (officially Spanish: Iglesia Filipina Independiente, IFI; colloquially known as the Aglipayan Church) is an independent Christian denomination in the form of a national church in the Philippines. Its schism from the Catholic Church was proclaimed in 1902 by the members of the Uni√≥n Obrera Democr√°tica Filipina due to the alleged mistreatment of Filipinos by Spanish priests and the execution of nationalist Jos√© Rizal under Spanish colonial rule.\n\nIsabelo de los Reyes was one of the initiators of the separation, and suggested that former Catholic priest Gregorio Aglipay be the head of the church. It is also known as the Aglipayan Church after its first Obispo Maximo, Gregorio Aglipay.\n\nCommonly shared beliefs in the Aglipayan Church are the rejection of the Apostolic Succession solely to the Petrine Papacy, the acceptance of priestly ordination of women, the free option of clerical celibacy, the tolerance to join Freemasonry groups, non-committal in belief regarding transubstantiation and Real Presence of the Eucharist, and the advocacy of contraception and same-sex civil rights among its members. Many saints canonised by Rome after the schism are also not officially recognised by the Aglipayan church and its members.\n\n, Aglipayans in the Philippines numbered about a million members, with most from the northern part of Luzon, especially in the Ilocos Region. Congregations are also found throughout the Philippine diaspora in North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. The church is the second-largest single Christian denomination in the country after the Roman Catholic Church (some 80.2% of the population), comprising about 2.6% of the total population of the Philippines.\n\nThe Apostolic Catholic Church (ACC) is a catholic denomination founded in the 1980s in Hermosa, Bataan. It formally separated in the Roman Catholic Church in 1992 when Patriarch Dr. John Florentine Teruel registered it as a Protestant and Independent Catholic denomination. Today, it has more than 5 million members worldwide. The largest international congregations are in Japan, United States and Canada.\n\nOrthodoxy has been continuously present in the Philippines for more than 200 years. It is represented by two groups, by the Exarchate of the Philippines (a jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople governed by the Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia), and by the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Mission in the Philippines (a jurisdiction of the Antiochian Orthodox Church governed by the Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia, New Zealand, and All Oceania). In 1999, it was asserted that there were about 560 Orthodox church members in the Philippines.\n\nProtestantism arrived in the Philippines with the take-over of the islands by Americans at the turn of the 20th century. Nowadays, they comprise about 10%‚Äì15% of the population with an annual growth rate of 10% since 1910 and constitute the largest Christian grouping after Roman Catholicism. In 1898, Spain lost the Philippines to the United States. After a bitter fight for independence against its new occupiers, Filipinos surrendered and were again colonized. The arrival of Protestant American missionaries soon followed. Protestant church organizations established in the Philippines during the 20th century include the following:\n\n\nMembers Church of God in Jesus Christ Worldwide (also known as \"Miembro de la Iglesia de Dios en Todo el Mundo Inc.\") is an independent Christian organization with headquarters in the Philippines led by Wilfredo \"Bro. Willy\" Santiago, a former Bible reader for Members Church of God International (MCGI). Willy Santiago was excommunicated from MCGI due to various violations. Santiago is currently building a new church headquarters in Malolos, Bulacan.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in the Philippines was founded during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898. Two men from Utah who were members of the United States artillery battery, and who were also set apart as missionaries by the Church before they left the United States, preached while stationed in the Philippines. Missionary work picked up after World War II, and in 1961 the Church was officially registered in the Philippines. In 1969, the Church had spread to eight major islands and had the highest number of baptisms of any area in the Church. A temple was built in 1984 which located in Quezon City and another in Cebu City, completed in 2010. Membership was 710,764 in 2015.\n\n\nIslam reached the Philippines in the 14th century with the arrival of Muslim traders from the Persian Gulf, Southern India, and their followers from several sultanate governments in Maritime Southeast Asia. Islam's predominance reached all the way to the shores of Manila Bay, home to several Muslim kingdoms. During the Spanish conquest, Islam had a rapid decline as the predominant monotheistic faith in the Philippines as a result of the introduction of Roman Catholicism by Spanish missionaries and via the Spanish Inquisition. The southern Filipino tribes were among the few indigenous Filipino communities that resisted Spanish rule and conversions to Roman Catholicism. The vast majority of Muslims in Philippines follow Sunni Islam of Shafi school of jurisprudence, with small Shiite and Ahmadiyya minorities. Islam is the oldest recorded monotheistic religion in the Philippines.\n\n. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the Muslim population of Philippines in 2015 was 5.57%. However, a 2012 estimate by the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) stated that there were 10.7 million Muslims, or approximately 11 percent of the total population.\n\nIn 1380 Karim ul' Makhdum the first Arabian trader reached the Sulu Archipelago and Jolo in the Philippines and through trade throughout the island established Islam in the country. In 1390 the Minangkabau's Prince Rajah Baguinda and his followers preached Islam on the islands. The Sheik Karimal Makdum Mosque was the first mosque established in the Philippines on Simunul in Mindanao in the 14th century. Subsequent settlements by Arab missionaries traveling to Malaysia and Indonesia helped strengthen Islam in the Philippines and each settlement was governed by a Datu, Rajah and a Sultan.\n\nBy the next century conquests had reached the Sulu islands in the southern tip of the Philippines where the population was animistic and they took up the task of converting the animistic population to Islam with renewed zeal. By the 15th century, half of Luzon (Northern Philippines) and the islands of Mindanao in the south had become subject to the various Muslim sultanates of Borneo and much of the population in the South were converted to Islam. However, the Visayas was largely dominated by Hindu-Buddhist societies led by rajahs and datus who strongly resisted Islam. One reason could be due to the economic and political disasters prehispanic Muslim pirates from the Mindanao region bring during raids. These frequent attacks gave way to naming present-day Cebu as then-\"Sugbo\" or scorched earth which was a defensive technique implemented by the Visayans so the pirates have nothing much to loot.\n\nMoro (derived from the Spanish word meaning \"Moors\") is the appellation inherited from the Spaniards, for Filipino Muslims and tribal groups of Mindanao. The Moros seek to establish an independent Islamic province in Mindanao to be named Bangsamoro. The term \"Bangsamoro\" is a combination of an Old Malay word meaning \"nation\" or \"state\" with the Spanish word \"Moro\". A significant Moro rebellion occurred during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. Conflicts and rebellion have continued in the Philippines from the pre-colonial period up to the present.\n\nThe Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) comprises the Philippines' predominantly Muslim provinces, namely: Basilan (except Isabela City), Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi, and the Islamic City of Marawi. It is the only region with its own government. The regional capital is at Cotabato City, although this city is outside of its jurisdiction.\n\nEven since the 1590s some Jews fleeing from The Inquisition were recorded to have come to the Philippines. As of 2005, Filipino Jews number at the very most 18,500 people. , Metro Manila boasted the largest Jewish community in the Philippines which, as of 2008, consisted of roughly 100 families.\n\nThe country's only synagogue, Beth Yaacov, is located in Makati. There are other Jews elsewhere in the country, but these are much fewer and almost all transients, either diplomats or business envoys, and their existence is almost totally unknown in mainstream society. There are a few Israelis in Manila recruiting caregivers for Israel, some work in call centers, businessmen and a few other executives. A number are converts to Judaism.\n\nThe Srivijaya Empire and Majapahit Empire on what is now Malaysia and Indonesia, introduced Hinduism and Buddhism to the islands. Ancient statues of Hindu-Buddhist gods have been found in the Philippines dating as far back as 600 to 1600 years from present.\n\nThe archipelagoes of Southeast Asia were under the influence of Hindu Tamil people, Gujarati people and Indonesian traders through the ports of Malay-Indonesian islands. Indian religions, possibly an amalgamated version of Hindu-Buddhist arrived in Philippines archipelago in the 1st millennium, through the Indonesian kingdom of Srivijaya followed by Majapahit. Archeological evidence suggesting exchange of ancient spiritual ideas from India to the Philippines includes the 1.79 kilogram, 21 carat gold Hindu goddess Agusan (sometimes referred to as Golden Tara), found in Mindanao in 1917 after a storm and flood exposed its location.\n\nAnother gold artifact, from the Tabon caves in the island of Palawan, is an image of Garuda, the bird who is the mount of Vishnu. The discovery of sophisticated Hindu imagery and gold artifacts in Tabon caves has been linked to those found from Oc Eo, in the Mekong Delta in Southern Vietnam. These archaeological evidence suggests an active trade of many specialized goods and gold between India and Philippines and coastal regions of Vietnam and China. Golden jewelry found so far include rings, some surmounted by images of Nandi ‚Äì the sacred bull, linked chains, inscribed gold sheets, gold plaques decorated with repouss√© images of Hindu deities.\n\nToday Hinduism is largely confined to the Indian Filipinos and the expatriate Indian community. Theravada and Vajrayana Buddhism, are practiced by Tibetans, Sri Lankan, Burmese and Thai nationals. There are Hindu temples in Manila, as well as in the provinces. There are temples also for Sikhism, sometimes located near Hindu temples. The two Paco temples are well known, comprising a Hindu temple and a Sikh temple.\n\nDentsu Communication Institute Inc., Research Centre for Japan said in 2006 that about 11% of the population are irreligious. Other sources put the number at less than 0.1%.\n\nIn February 2009, Filipino Freethinkers was formed. Since 2011, the Philippine Atheists and Agnostics Society has held its OUT Campaigns in Rizal Park and Quezon Memorial Circle. Also it held two feeding programs \"Good without Religion\" in Bacoor, Cavite. The society also is a member affiliate and associate of various international atheist organizations such as the Atheist Alliance International, Institute for Science and Human Values, and the International Humanist and Ethical Union, as one among secular organizations that promotes free thought and scientific development in the Philippines.\n\nThe 1987 Constitution of the Philippines declares: The separation of Church and State shall be inviolable. (Article II, Section 6), and, No law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed. No religious test shall be required for the exercise of civil or political rights. (Article III, Section 5). Joaquin Bernas, a Filipino Jesuit specializing in constitutional law, acknowledges that there were complex issues that were brought to court and numerous attempts to use the separation of Church and State against the Roman Catholic Church, but he defends the statement, saying that \"the fact that he [Marcos] tried to do it does not deny the validity of the separation of church and state\".\n\nOn April 28, 2004, the Philippines Supreme Court reversed the ruling of a lower court ordering five religious leaders to refrain from endorsing a candidate for elective office. Manila Judge Conception Alarcon-Vergara had ruled that the \n\"head of a religious organization who influences or threatens to punish members could be held liable for coercion and violation of citizen's right to vote freely\". The lawsuit filed by Social Justice Society party stated that \"the Church's active participation in partisan politics, using the awesome voting strength of its faithful flock, will enable it to elect men to public office who will in turn be forever beholden to its leaders, enabling them to control the government\".\n\nThey claimed that this violates the Philippine constitution's separation of Church and State clause. The named respondents were Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle, El Shaddai Movement Leader Mike Velarde, Iglesia ni Cristo Executive Minister Eduardo V. Manalo and Jesus Is Lord Church leader Eddie Villanueva. Manalo's Iglesia ni Cristo practices bloc voting. Former Catholic Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin had been instrumental in rallying support for the assumption to power of Corazon Aquino and Gloria Arroyo. Velarde supported Fidel V. Ramos, Joseph Estrada, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Benigno Aquino III while Villanueva endorsed Fidel Ramos and Jose De Venecia. The papal nuncio agreed with the decision of the lower court while the other respondents challenged the decision.\n\n"}

From 1969 to 2014 it was named the Chaplain Branch. It was renamed on October 16, 2014.\n\nThe mission of this branch is to \"support and enhance the effectiveness of the CF as a whole ‚Äì its leadership, the individual men and women who serve and their families ‚Äì through the provision of comprehensive religious and spiritual support, advice, and care.\"\n\nThe vision of the Chaplaincy is to \"be an operationally relevant Chaplaincy that supports and cares for all CF personnel and their families, wherever they live and serve, empowering them spiritually and morally to meet the demands of military service.\"\n\n\nIn accordance with their role, chaplains offer prayer services at home and abroad. Some services are inherently religious, such as Sunday worship, baptisms or religious funerals and burial at sea ceremonies. Other times, chaplains may offer a prayer for secular occasions such as base divisions, changes of command, mess dinners or ship commissioning ceremonies. Before offering prayers during parades and ceremonies, it is customary that the order to remove headdress be given to those on parade. In November 2004, Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada ruled that this order was \"not lawful\" since it unjustifiably required all attendees to show participation in a prayer that they may not believe. Following this ruling, non-believers are now permitted to retain their headdress, just like Jews and Sikhs do in accordance with their faith.\n\nThe Canadian Forces Chaplain School and Centre (CFChSC) in Borden, Ontario, is responsible for the training of all chaplains (Regular and Reserve, Protestant, Roman Catholic, Muslim and Jewish). CFChSC provides training in operational and static ministry. \nThe training is provided with an operational focus and an interfaith approach. Courses are available in both official languages English and French. Courses include Chaplain Basic Officer Training, Ethics, Pastoral Counselling, Chaplains in Deployed Operations, Intermediate, Advanced, Chapel Life Coordinator (Protestant and Roman Catholic), and Ministry in a Pluralistic Environment. CFChSC prepares military chaplains for service in times of peace and times of conflict. The Resource Centre contains a library relating to ministry, religion and related areas. The Chaplains provide ministry to Canadian Forces personnel and their families.\n\nSince the amalgamation of the former Protestant and Roman Catholic Chaplaincies in the mid-1990s into a single multi-faith Canadian Forces Chaplaincy, a joint exercise. Consisting of seminars, business meetings and worship services, the annual exercise provides opportunities for the professional and spiritual development of chaplains and for fellowship as a Branch. The Annual Protestant Chaplain Branch Retreat and Seminar was held annually at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario in the late 1980s and 1990s.\n\nOn 24 September 2006, the Department of National Defence issued a press release indicating that, \"[i]n order to better represent the diversity of Canadian society, and reflect the multi-faith nature of today‚Äôs chaplaincy\", the current branch cap badge would be replaced with three new badges. The new badges would retain the crowned wreath of red maple leaves and central blue circle; the Maltese Cross behind the circle would be removed. On the circle would be \"a different symbol for each faith tradition: for Christian chaplains, the Maltese cross, which has long been associated with Christian chaplaincy. Jewish chaplains will wear the symbol of the tablets of the Law and the Magen David (the star of David) and Muslim chaplains will wear the crescent.\" A scroll with the motto would be placed below the circle. These badges were approved by the Canadian Heraldic Authority on 15 March 2006.\n\nThe current Chaplain General is Major-General Guy Chapdelaine.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52929202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52929202", "title": "Seth Andrews", "text": "Seth Andrews\n\nSeth Andrews (born April 12, 1968) is an author and speaker on the subject of atheism. He is the creator and host of \"The Thinking Atheist\" online community, podcast, and YouTube channel, and the author of the self-published books \"Deconverted\" and \"Sacred Cows\". Prior to his atheist activism, he was a fundamentalist Christian and had a ten-year career as a Christian radio host.\n\nAndrews was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, into a Christian family with parents who studied theology, and he was baptized at the Eastwood Baptist Church. When his public-school education conflicted with the religious teachings he had received at home, his parents transferred him to the small, church-owned Temple Christian School, and later to the Eastwood Baptist School. As a student leader, he eagerly participated in school functions and religious activities, including weekly church services, the student council, and the local branch of Youth for Christ, for which he was a spokesman.\n\nAndrews was a fan of contemporary Christian music. He hosted the Morning Show on Christian radio station KXOJ-FM from 1990 to 2000. \n\nThe 1997 death of Rich Mullins planted the first seed of doubt in his mind. The premature death of the Christian songwriter was hard to reconcile with Andrews' understanding of the principles of Christianity. He later commented, \"As I spoke words of comfort to our listeners and callers, I struggled to reconcile the notion that the God of Matthew 10, the one who considered us worth 'more than many sparrows,' would design or abide the taking of Mullins‚Äô earthly life in such a pointless, gruesome manner.\" This event was a turning point for him, and he began the long, slow journey to apostasy. The events of September 11, 2001 also played a crucial role in strengthening his doubts about religion.\n\nIn 2004 Andrews saw the video of new atheist Christopher Hitchens debating Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, which gave him the courage to leave his faith. In 2008, he finally came out as atheist to his family and friends. Finding no community of like-minded people in his area, he decided to build an atheist community online.\n\nHe created a website and Facebook page, both called \"The Thinking Atheist\", to connect with other non-believers online and \"share some of the information that I had found helpful in the hope of making the journey out of superstition easier for others\". He considers the website to be a venue which allows people to engage their doubts and question their faith, and thus live a healthier life. \n\nAndrews is also the host of \"The Thinking Atheist\" weekly podcast, which aims to challenge stereotypes that depict atheists as angry, or religious people as stupid. In addition, he has a YouTube channel called \"The Thinking Atheist\" which hosts numerous self-produced atheist-related videos. He also does public speaking about atheism.\n\nAndrews has written two self-published books, \"Deconverted\" (2012) and \"Sacred Cows\" (2015). \n\nIn December 2012 he self-published his autobiographical book \"Deconverted: A Journey From Religion To Reason\", detailing his journey out of religion and how he became an atheist activist. In addition to discussing his apostasy, he recounts his life growing up in the Bible Belt and his past as a DJ for a Christian radio station, and discusses how and why he created the \"Thinking Atheist\" community. \n\nPaleontologist Donald Prothero commented on the book as follows: \"Andrews writes in a friendly, relaxed folksy style, just as you hear him on the air, and it suits his humble narrative well. He is a good storyteller and conversationalist not only in his radio work, but on the printed page as well... Andrews‚Äô book is a short but very enjoyable read. It is especially of interest to anyone who has made a similar journey from faith to non-belief, or wishes to understand how this process works.\"\n\nIn June 2015 he self-published his second book, \"Sacred Cows: A Lighthearted Look at Belief and Tradition Around the World\". In it he identifies ideas, beliefs and traditions that various cultures regard as holy, stressing that ideas should be examined critically rather than being followed with blind faith. \n\nIn a review for \"Skeptic Magazine\", Donald Prothero wrote: \"Taking a gently incredulous tone, Andrews reviews a long litany of the strange things people believe and do. In most cases, he tries to be sympathetic and understanding. He always tries to keep things in perspective and remind his readers that he once accepted beliefs that seem odd to him now. But in other cases, it‚Äôs impossible not to adopt a note of sarcasm and mockery at beliefs that are clearly bonkers.\"\n\n\nIn 2014, Andrews told the \"Arizona Daily Sun\", \"I was a true believer, and when I hit the age of 37, my doubts about my faith came to critical mass and for the first time in my life, I began to examine what I had held as true.\" About his recent activism he declared: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not an enemy of religious people, but I‚Äôll be honest and say I am an enemy of religion.‚Äù \n\nWhen asked by \"AlterNet\" what his favorite Bible verse was, he replied that it was probably Romans 12:9, which reads 'Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good.' He explained, \"The message here isn't groundbreaking (and certainly doesn't require godlike powers to formulate), but I find it admirable: Don't be a fake. Pursue that which brings about a positive result, for yourself and for others. Hold evil in contempt. Of course, I don't bind a supernatural connotation to the word 'evil' but rather see evil as an action.\"\n\nAn Oklahoma news website asked Andrews about his opinion on Madalyn Murray O'Hair, America's first modern atheist and the founder of American Atheists, who ended compulsory Bible reading in public schools in the 1960s. He replied, \"I personally don‚Äôt relate to her tactics, but while I myself may have a different style, I must give her credit. Madalyn was a such a champion for non-belief that she paid for it with her life. I have a tremendous amount of admiration (for her). She did a lot of good work.\"\n"}

This place is also revered as the mystical land of Shambhala by Tibetans. According to another tradition, the Siddhashrama is located in the Tibetan region, nearby Kailash parvat. Though any Sadhu, Sanyasi, Yeti, Monk and Yogi might have known 'Siddhashram' by any name or various cults might have used different worship or Sadhana methods according to their beliefs. \n\nThe context of this supernatural land has been mentioned in many ancient scriptures along with four Vedas. The Siddhashram is described as a divine place in spiritual journey. Thus it is also believed that while discharging their divine works in this universe the spiritually empowered Yogis remain in constant touch with Siddhashram and they visit it regularly. Further more, it is also believed that the divine personalities like Ram, Krishna, Buddha, Shankaracharya, and Ma Anandamai etc. are present along with their bodies at Siddhashram.\n\nSiddhashram is considered as the base of spiritual consciousness, heart of divinity and the mortification land of great Rishies. Siddhashram is equally scarce to human beings and all the visible and invisible creatures. Thus, the Siddhashram is assumed as a very scarce divine place. But it will be possible to get the divine power to enter this scarce and sacred place by doing hard works through Sadhana procedure and following Sadhana path.\nSiddhashram is a secret and mystical land deep in the Himalayas, where great siddha yogis, sadhus, and sages live. Siddhashram is the ashram by our ancestors, saints, sages & Yogis of high order. It is referred to in many Indian epics, the Veda, Upanishads and Puranas including the Rigveda, the oldest scripture of human civilization.\n\nSiddhashram is the society for the enlightened people or siddhas. The person, who reaches high level in sadhana can reach the mystical siddhashram with the blessings of the guru, who is the regular of this place. \nThis aashram lies near the Mansarovar lake and the Kailash. Siddha yogis and sanyasis are meditating in this place for thousands of years. Like many mystical places mentioned in different religions this place can't be seen with naked eyes, it's an experience and only through the path of meditation and spiritual awareness we can experience this place.\n\nMany in Hinduism believe that Maharsih Vashishtha, Vishwamitra, Kanad, Pulastya, Atri, Mahayogi Gorakhnath, Srimad Shankaracharya, Bheesma, Kripacharya, can be seen wandering there in physical form and also one can have the privilege of listening to their sermons. Many Siddha yogi, yoginis, Apsara (Angel), saints are found to be meditating in this place. The beautiful flowers in the garden, trees, birds, siddha-yoga lake, meditating saints and many other things of the place cannot be described in words.\n\nSiddhashrama (literally, the hermitage of the Siddhas) is referred to in the Ramayana, Mahabharata and the Puranas. In Valmiki's Ramayana it is said that Viswamitra has his hermitage in Siddhashrama and it was the erstwhile hermitage of Vishnu, when he appeared as the Vamana Avatar. He takes Rama and Lakshmana to Siddhashrama to exterminate the demons who are disturbing his religious sacrifices. In the Narada Purana (Purva,1.25), Siddhashrama is mentioned as the hermitage of sage Suta.\n\nIn the modern era, the knowledge of Siddhashram is first referred by the Pandit Gopinath Kaviraj and later extensively by Dr.Narayan Dutt Shrimali. \n\n\n \n"}

Although superficially professing an orientation towards theocracy and a conservative social program in its earliest years, the UCP advocated progressive political reform, promoting direct democracy through implementation of initiative and referendum. By 1904 the organization advocated government ownership of key natural resources and public utilities and an opposition to monopolistic forms of economic ownership in accord with the golden rule.\n\nThe UCP was the brainchild of Rev. William Rudolph Benkert of Davenport, Iowa, who dominated the organization as its National Chairman throughout its entire existence. After running tickets for President and Vice President of the United States under its own name in the elections of 1900, 1904, and 1908, the UCP was briefly absorbed into a new organization called the American Party in 1909 before resuming its former name.\n\nIn 1912 another very short-lived name change was made, this time to Christian Patriots. This change was again quickly reversed and the party's ticket appeared on the November 1912 ballot under its old moniker. The party continued in existence but went on hiatus, failing to run a Presidential ticket in the elections of 1916, 1920, or 1924. While intimations were made that a Presidential ticket would be fielded in 1928, it seems that this plan came to naught and the party expired.\n\nThe United Christian Party was the brainchild of Rev. William Rudolph Benkert, a minister at the Church of God in Davenport, Iowa moved to action by what he perceived to be the nation's declining moral values and called for a return to the Christian moral tradition.\n\nIn August 1897 an organizational conference was held in Davenport to establish a political organization through which Benkert might advance his political agenda. A subsequent conference helping to solidify the organization was held in the neighboring town of Washington, Iowa, and planning began almost immediately for a national convention to be held in a major Midwestern city.\n\nIn the spring of 1898 Benkert came out with a draft national platform which acknowledged \"Almighty God and the rightful sovereign of all men and women, and the Lord Jesus Christ as the ruler among the nations of the earth.\" Having made this tip of the hat to theocracy, Benkert's program declared the United Christian Party to be a \"party of reform\" in favor of \"whatever tends to make men and women intelligent and virtuous.\" Such reforms were envisioned to be enabled by the establishment of direct legislation through implementation of the system of initiative and referendum and proportional representation. Benkert's draft platform declared:\n\"We believe that it will be impossible to secure direct legislation without a union of all Christians and all reformers and reform parties, and knowing that there is no higher standard of reform than Christ and no more worthy name to be honored in uniting us than his name, and knowing he is a true friend of those who labor and a friend of the poor and oppressed and that God hears us when we ask for reform in His name, therefore we ask all his followers, regardness of nationality, creed or color, sex or previous politics to join hands with us in His name at the ballot box in making this a government by and for the people through direct legislation of the people...\"\n\nOn July 4, 1899, delegates gathered in Des Moines, Iowa for what was touted as the first annual Iowa State Convention of the United Christian Party. The gathering received an official communication from the National Reform Party which requested that the convention name a 10-member delegation to attend a joint convention held at some future time to be determined in the following year to name a ticket for a national campaign in the November 1900 election.\n\nIndividuals were selected to comprise a State Central Committee to govern the affairs of the United Christian Party in Iowa, one from each of five congressional districts, with no committee members immediately named for the three other congressional districts in the state. Nominees were selected to represent the party in the 1899 Iowa elections, topped by C. C. Heacock of Brighton for Governor and Rev. John Fitz Randolph Leonard of Ainsworth for Lieutenant-Governor, in addition to nominees for other state offices. A short platform, borrowing heavily from William R. Benkert's previous draft document, was approved.\n\nThe choice of Heacock for Governor was regarded by peculiar by at least one Des Moines political analyst. Heacock, the publisher of the \"Brighton Enterprise,\" was at the time serving a six-month jail sentence following conviction for criminal libel. Moreover, \"it is not claimed that he is a Christian or even a church member,\" the editor of the Des Moines \"Iowa Daily Capital\" scolded.\n\nThe UCP subsequent regarded the July 4, 1899 date of the convocation of this convention as its moment of foundation, despite the group's previous organizational history. The slate of the United Christian Party of Iowa appeared on the November 1899 state ballot by virtue of a nominating petition campaign which garnered 961 signatures ‚Äî enough to meet statutory requirements.\n\nThe UCP held a national convention from May 1 to 2, 1900 in Rock Island, Illinois. About 25 delegates were in attendance.\n\nAfter unanimously approving a resolution to organize a national \"Christian political union or party for the application of the Christ principle in state and nation.\" A second motion to name the organization United Christian Party so as \"to conform to the development of the movement in Iowa\" was approved by a vote of 20 to 5, with the names Christian Political Union and Christian Union Party drawing minority support.\n\nThe convention approved a platform of a socially conservative bent, declaring:\n\"We deprecate certain immoral laws which have grown out of the failure of our nation to recognize [the principle that no law should contravene the Divine law], notably such as require the desecration of the Christian Sabbath, authorize unscriptural marriage and divorce, and license the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors as a beverage.\"\n\nThe party further called for a ban on the sale of \"cigarettes or tobacco in any form\" to minors and for daily reading of the Bible in public schools.\n\nBeyond this conservative agenda, the party declared in its 1900 platform in favor of certain items commonly associated with progressivism, including proportional representation and the system of initiative and referendum, an end to mob violence, and termination of war in favor of mediation of all international disputes. The UCP also expressed support for public ownership of utilities as well as for direct election of the President and Vice President of the United States.\n\nRev. Silas C. Swallow of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania was unanimously nominated by the conventionfor President of the United States. Swallow later declined the nomination, however, and party stalwart J.F.R. Leonard was ultimately tapped as the party's Presidential nominee in his stead. John G. Woolley of Illinois was unanimously chosen as the new party's nominee for Vice President, but he, too, later declined the nomination, to be replaced by Rev. C. M. Sheldon, who also later declined. David H. Martin of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania finally assented, becoming the second name listed on the party's November ticket.\n\nThe Leonard-Martin ticket collected a grand total of 1,059 votes out of approximately 14 million cast in the November 1900 general election.\n\nThe United Christian Party began touting the notion that \"Christ's golden rule should be applied to all government by and for the people\" in its convention call for its May 1904 National Convention, and made use of similar slogans in subsequent campaigns.\n\nWilliam Benkert remained as the organization's National Chairman and D.H. Martin of Pittsburgh as Secretary. The UCP's 1904 platform included planks in favor of direct legislation; opposing war and mob violence; favoring government ownership of oil wells, coal mines, and public utilities; opposing government profiting from the liquor trade via taxation of alcoholic beverages; and opposing \"all trusts and combines contrary to the welfare of the common people.\"\n\nIn 1908 the United Christian Party nominated Rev. Daniel Braxton Turney of Illinois for President and L. S. Coffin of Iowa for Vice President. William R. Benkert remained in place as National Chairman of the organization.\n\nThe ticket polled about 12,000 in the November 1908 election.\n\nNational Chairman William Rudolph Benkert issued a call for a \"national convention\" to be held May 1, 1909 at the Watch Tower in Rock Island, Illinois. This gathering was to be held \"to confer with one another concerning the will and kingdom of God in earth, in behalf of humanity, as the assembly led by His Spirit, and governed by His command of love, may we see and act upon.\"\n\nThe convention seems to have increased the organization's association with the personality of its founder, granting to William R. Benkert the right to personally appoint the members of the party's governing 7-member National Executive Committee. The party reconfirmed its dedication to move forward, naming four national organizers to establish state organizations in preparation for the 1912 Presidential campaign, still three years away.\n\nFor a time it seemed that the plan for organizational advance was not to take place under the United Christian Party moniker, however, as shortly after the 1909 convention was closed it was announced that the UCP had been absorbed by a new organization called the American Party. This name change proved short-lived, however, and the old organizational name was resumed.\n\nThe United Christian Party returned on May 1, 1911, to the perennial location for its conventions, the inn at Black hawk's Watch Tower in Rock Island, Illinois. The convention predictably reconfirmed party founder William Benkert as National Chairman. In a less predictable move, the convention anticipated modern American electoral politics by nominating young minister Daniel Braxton Turney to head the UCP ticket for a second time in the campaign for President at the November 1912 election ‚Äî still more than 18 months away. Samuel C. Carter of Howard Lake, Minnesota was selected as Turney's 1912 Vice Presidential running mate.\n\nIn addition to its perennial calls for obedience to God and the golden rule, the platform adopted at the 1911 National Convention included calls for \"a rightful ground and income tax\" and an end to \"unsettling of business by unjust tariff legislation.\" \"We disapprove of a standing army and the expense of further preparation for war,\" the platform noted. The convention again yielded plenipotentiary authority to its longtime National Chairman, granting to Benkert the power to unilaterally select State Chairmen in each state.\n\nWilliam Benkert's call for a May 1, 1912 National Convention of the UCP was issued in February of that year and indicated that the group sought to \"end war and capital punishment, and to settle tariff, liquor, trust, and high cost of living questions by direct vote of the people and by the Golden Rule.\"\n\nThe Presidential ticket of Daniel B. Turney and Samuel G Carter named by the 1911 convention was unanimously reaffirmed by the gathering. The United Christian Party name was to be once again terminated, however, with a new name of \"Christian Patriots\" selected for the UCP. This change appears once again to have been rapidly abandoned in favor of the established party name.\n\nIn a post-convention statement to the press, Presidential nominee Daniel Braxton Turney indicated that some 250 delegates, representing 7 states, had been in attendance at the 1912 Rock Island gathering. He declared, with evident hyperbole, that the party was \"at least 5,000 percent stronger\" than it had been during the 1908 campaign.\n\nThe UCP ticket appeared on the ballot in about 20 states in 1912.\n\nThe United Christian Party remained in existence at least through 1916, holding its annual May Day gatherings in Davenport, Iowa. By decision of the small gatherings, the last of which was held in the home of National Chairman William R. Benkert, no ticket was put in the field for the 1916 campaign. The hiatus proved to be an extended one, with no ticket being put forward in the campaigns of 1920 or 1924.\n\nIn 1927 the tenacious National Chairman William R. Benkert announced plans for a conference to name a candidate for the 1928 campaign, with Judge W.S. Kenyon of Iowa Benkert's personal choice for the nomination.\n\n"}

Their poems and tempera illuminations mix fantasy, the occult, and chronicle in a chronology of the popes. Each prophecy consists of four elements, an enigmatic allegorical text, an emblematic picture, a motto, and an attribution to a pope.\n\nThe series was augmented in the fourteenth century with further prophecies, with the \"incipit\" Ascende calve (\"arise, bald one\"), written in imitative continuation of the earlier set, but with more overtly propagandist aims. By the time of the Council of Constance (1414‚Äì18), both series were united as the Vaticinia de summis pontificibus and misattributed to the Calabrian mystic Joachim of Flora, thus credited to a \"pseudo-Joachim.\" There are some fifty manuscripts of this fuller collection.\n\nThe prophecies received numerous printed editions.\n\n\n\n"}

He conferred with every U.S. president during his term as chief.\n\nGriffin also served as an interpreter and also was an important figure among the practitioners of the Big Moon variant of the Native American Church, and played a significant role in the spreading and continuing this religion among multiple tribes. Griffin was also a 32 degree Scottish Right Mason and a member of the Akdar Shrine.\n\nVictor Griffin was born around 1873 in Indian Territory in what is now Osage County, Oklahoma. Griffin was orphaned at a young age, and was adopted and raised by Mary \"Widow\" Stafford.\n\nDetails about the early life of Griffin are scant and conflicting. Mary Stafford was born prior to the first Quapaw removal, and died at over 100 years of age and was buried on her home allotment. Due to his upbringing with Stafford, Griffin was fluent in the Quapaw language and well versed in tribal oral history. Griffin was given the Quapaw name Geh-Hu-He Jinka.\n\nBeing well educated and well spoken in both English and Quapaw, Griffin frequently served as a translator during meetings or when an elderly Quapaw tribal member needed his services, for example when drafting a will.\n\nHe was interviewed by many individuals such as news reporters and researchers. In 1940, linguist Frank T. Siebert interviewed Griffin regarding the Quapaw language; Griffin provided several Quapaw words to Siebert and stated to him \"that Quapaw was closely related to Ponca and Omaha, especially to the latter... (you) should study these languages instead\".\n\nAfter the death of John Quapaw, elected chief of the Quapaw Tribe, Griffin was elected chief and served from 1920 to 1957.\n\nDuring his tenure as chief, he frequently went to Washington D.C. for meetings in the interest of the Quapaw Tribe. It is noted that he met with every President of the United States that served during his time as chief. Griffin was also noted for being the first \"Short-Haired Chief of the Quapaws,\" because he cut off his braids. He was quoted as saying \"formerly our chiefs were chosen by inheritance but now we are elected\".\n\nWhile serving as chief, Griffin was known for colorful displays and often was pictured in tribal regalia, which often included a full Plains eagle-feather headdress. Griffin also featured prominently in the commemorative festivities when paving was completed for Route 66 in Quapaw, Oklahoma on March 24, 1933. The two halves of Route 66 met in the town of Quapaw, leading to the town being referred to in some instances as \"where east meets west.\" Griffin laid a zinc tablet on Main Street to memorialize the event.\n\nIn 1956, the Quapaw Tribe, influenced by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, ended their system of governance by chief. They passed a series of governing resolutions that created new form of government by an elected tribal business committee headed by a chairperson. When this took place, Griffin no longer held his position as chief and the political authority of the Quapaw Tribe was vested in the new committee.\n\nJohn Wilson (Caddo-Delaware), also known as Moonhead, introduced the Peyote religion to the Quapaw people living near present-day Quapaw, Oklahoma, in 1880 or the mid-1890s at the request of Tall Chief. Because Roman Catholic missionaries had influenced Quapaw religion, their practice of peyotism incorporates aspects of Catholicism.\n\nWhen he visited Quapaw, Moonhead introduced Griffin to peyotism. Griffin was in his teenage years or early twenties. Moonhead instructed Griffin in this religion and authorized him to conduct Native American Church ceremonies. Following John Wilson's death, Griffin became the Native American Church priest to the Quapaw.\n\nGriffin became an ardent believer in the Peyote religion and helped to spread its practice, especially among members of the Osage and Quapaw tribes, but also among other tribal groups such as the Seneca-Cayuga Tribe of Oklahoma.\n\nHe also was instrumental in the incorporation of the Native American Church under Oklahoma law in 1911, the incorporation of the religion specified the use of peyote as a sacrament.\n\nGriffin died at his home residence near the Spring River outside of the town of Quapaw, in Ottawa County, OK, in 1958 at the approximate age of 85.\n\nGriffin's image was featured on a brick sculpture between Twelfth and Military Avenue in Baxter Springs, Kansas. The sculpture depicts local history and includes a depiction of Griffin.\n\nVictor and Minnie Track Griffin's granddaughter, Ardina Moore teaches the Quapaw language today.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13298224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13298224", "title": "Whitechapel Road", "text": "Whitechapel Road\n\nWhitechapel Road is a major arterial road in Whitechapel, Tower Hamlets, in the East End of London. It is named after a small chapel of ease dedicated to St Mary and connects Aldgate to the west (as Whitechapel High Street) with Mile End Road to the east. The road is part of the historic Roman road from London to Colchester, now the A11.\n\nThe road had become built up by the 19th century and is now a main shopping district in the Whitechapel area. Along the road, there is an established market, Whitechapel station and the Royal London Hospital. It remains an important road and is marked with bus lanes, with limited parking.\n\nSeveral ethnic minority communities have centred on Whitechapel Road. The road was a focal point of the Jewish Community from the 1850s to the 1930s, with many Jewish shops and market stalls. Towards the latter part of the 20th century, the street became an established settlement of the British Bangladeshi community, who now sell a range of authentic Asian food and clothes in the market and on shop fronts. Altab Ali Park sits on the site of the original church at the western end of Whitechapel Road, and is a memorial to an Asian worker who suffered a fatal racial attack in 1978.\n\nThe road's name, along with the area, is derived from the original 14th century White Chapel. It follows the section of the Roman road between Londinium (London) and Camulodunum (Colchester), which connected to the Pye Road to Venta Icenorum (Caistor St Edmund near Norwich). The section of the Roman road that is now Whitechapel Road is a Primary A-road, the A11, and has bus lanes running along its length. Owing to the popularity of the market, parking is heavily restricted, limited to occasional parking metered spaces along the road.\n\nCycle Superhighway CS2 runs along Whitechapel Road. The nearest London Underground stations are Whitechapel station and Aldgate East station and the nearest National Rail station is Bethnal Green railway station. A number of local London Buses routes run along Whitechapel Road, including 25, 205 and 254.\n\nThe road has been an important thoroughfare and coaching route for centuries. Whitechapel High Street and Whitechapel Road are named as such on John Rocque's Map of London, 1746, both marked as \"White Chapel\". On John Cary's \"Environs of London\" of 1795 (published in his \"New Itinerary\" of 1798) there are properties on both sides of the road. By the ninth edition in 1821, the road is shown as extensively built up. In the mid-19th century, drovers steered livestock from local farms along the road towards Smithfield Market, causing considerable traffic congestion. By the 1870s, the road had become extensively developed with properties along the entire stretch of the road.\n\nThe Freedom Press Bookshop is on Angel Alley, No.¬†84b Whitechapel High Street, and was established in the 1880s by Peter Kropotkin and Charlotte Wilson as the first publishing house to deal with anarchism and radical publications. The press has been controversial, and was fire-bombed in 2013, but quickly reopened. The Whitechapel Art Gallery on Whitechapel High Street opened in 1899. It was designed by Charles Harrison Townsend in 1895 and was the first major art gallery in East London. It has shown works of Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg and David Hockney. It continues to be the centre of the arts scene in the area.\nThe Whitechapel Bell Foundry, a principal supplier of church bells in Britain, was, until its closure in 2017, based at 32‚Äì34 Whitechapel Road. The buildings date from 1670 and are Grade II listed. Originally a coaching inn known as the Artichoke, it was occupied by the foundry from 1738, replacing smaller premises on the north side of the road. Davenant Foundation School moved to No.¬†173 Whitechapel Road in 1818. The school expanded with a new hall and classrooms in 1896, with further improvements in 1909. However, a decreasing child population meant that in 1965, the school moved to Loughton, Essex. The building remains on the north side and is Grade II listed.\n\nContinuing eastwards, Whitechapel station is on the north side of the road, alongside the street market. Behind the tube station is the former site of Blackwall Buildings a set of philanthropic houses built in 1890. Just to the east of the market are almshouses at Trinity House, that were originally built in 1695 for retired seamen.\n\nNearby is the former site of St. Mary's (Whitechapel Road) tube station. It opened in March 1884 but its close proximity to both Whitechapel and Aldgate East tube stations made it superfluous, leading to its closure in April 1938. It was used as an air raid shelter in the Second World War, but was destroyed by bombing in 1940. Opposite to the south is the former Royal London Hospital building, built in 1740. The hospital suffered significant structural damage during the Second World War, but much of the 18th and 19th centuries architecture still remains. A new building now sits adjacent to the original.\nThe Pavilion Theatre opened on Nos.191‚Äì193¬†Whitechapel Road, the site of a former clothes factory, in 1828. It was the first major theatre to open in the East End of London. The original building was destroyed in a fire in 1856, and was replaced by a larger theatre that could accommodate over 1,000 people, becoming the centre of Yiddish theatre in Britain. It closed in 1934.\n\nDuring the 1940s, the Metropolitan Police attempted to crack down on illegal gambling held in social clubs along Whitechapel Road. The Brancroft Social Club was based at No.¬†69, and in March 1944, a police raid uncovered unlicensed horse and dog race betting which led to the arrest of the club's owner and 21 patrons.\n\nThe Albion Brewery was first established at the eastern end of Whitechapel Road in 1808 by Richard Ivory, landlord of the Blind Beggar. In 1860, the brewery was rebuilt, producing an average of 133,000 barrels of beer a year. It closed in 1979.\n\nThe Eastern District Post Office is based at the eastern end of Whitechapel Road, on the south side. This was the eastern terminus for the former London Post Office Railway (colloquially known as the \"Mail Rail\"), built to allow fast mail transfers across London. It closed in 2003. Beyond this is Mile End Gate ‚Äì where the road becomes Mile End Road; and was the site of the former toll gate.\n\nThe road has the been the centre of several ethnic minority groups in London. In the 1840s, many Irish emigrated to avoid the potato famine and began street selling at Whitechapel Market and along Whitechapel Road.\n\nThe Jewish community settled on and around Whitechapel Road from the 1850s onwards. In the 1880s, the community expanded rapidly as Ashkenazi Jews fled to Britain and took over many of the shops and market stalls on the street. For the remainder of the century and much of the 20th, the road was the focal point of the community. The nearby Jewish Free School was, at one point, the largest educational establishment in the world, with over 4,300 pupils. A fountain opposite the Royal London Hospital in memory of King Edward VII has the inscription \"erected from subscriptions raised by Jewish inhabitants of East London\". On 4 October 1936, British Union of Fascists leader Oswald Mosley organised an anti-Jewish parade through the East End that included passing through Whitechapel Road, but was stopped by a crowd of protesters. The sentiment against Jews in Whitechapel Road caused the community to dissolve from the 1930s onwards; the Pavilion Theatre closed and the Jewish Free School was destroyed in the Blitz during the Second World War. The Yiddish newspaper \"The Jewish Times\" (\"Die Zeit\") was produced at No.¬†135 Whitechapel Road from 1913 to 1936.\n\nTowards the end of the 20th century, the street, along with nearby Brick Lane became the centre of the British Bangladeshi community. The East London Mosque on Whitechapel Road was opened by Shaykh Abdullah bin Subayl in 1985 and can accommodate over 3,000 worshippers, with dedicated facilities for women. The nearby London Muslim Centre opened in 2003. Whitechapel Market caters well for the community, with stalls stocking Asian fruit and vegetables including okra and mangoes, clothing such as tunics and pashminas, and mobile phone cards for cheap long-distance calls. A racially motivated attack on local worker Altab Ali near Whitechapel Road in May 1978 was a significant event for the local Asian community, and his life is now commemorated in Altab Ali Park at the western end of the road, which was built on the former St Mary's Church grounds.\n\nThe area around Whitechapel Road is notorious for the 19th century Whitechapel murders, which are believed to be linked to Jack the Ripper. One of the first victims was Martha Tabram, who was found with multiple stab wounds on George Yard Buildings, Whitechapel Road on 7 August 1888.\n\nJoseph Merrick, the Elephant Man, moved to Whitechapel Road in 1884. Visitors paid to see him in the back room of a shop owned by showman Tom Norman. The shop was directly opposite the Royal London Hospital, and Merrick was frequently visited by doctors. Merrick later moved to the hospital permanently, where he spent the last years of his life.\n\nThe Blind Beggar is at No.¬†337 and was the founding point of the Salvation Army following a meeting outside the pub by William Booth in 1865. On 9 March 1966, the venue became notorious after Ronnie Kray fatally shot George Cornell at the pub. The premises remains open for business, though it has been refurbished several times. The Kray Twins also used the Blackwall Buildings, by then dilapidated, as a form of punishment by locking a victim in a flat alone with Ronnie's German Shepherd dog.\n\nWhitechapel Road is the equal cheapest property location on the British version of the Monopoly game board. Both it and the Old Kent Road are priced at ¬£60. In reality, increasing property prices across London meant that the average house price on Whitechapel Road in 2013 was ¬£295,082.\n\n\nCitations\n\nSources\n"}

The project began in 2003 and was completed in Seattle in 2010. Wendy Graff was the leader of WTP. The WTP was commissioned by the Seattle-based Kadima Reconstructionist community.\n\nThe Kadima Reconstructionist community of Seattle decided to purchase a Torah scroll written by women for their congregation in the early 2000s. Previously, they had been borrowing scrolls. They started looking for women scribes, but had trouble finding any at first. The reason there were no women scribes was because of the prohibition in Jewish law against women writing a Torah scroll for ritual use. Kadima eventually found a \"\"halachically\" acceptable\" way to create the Torah and began to look at multiple scribes for the project.\n\nThe scroll was commissioned in 2003. Kadima supported the training of two women scribes and the other four trained on their own. The scribes included Rachel Reichhardt, who was also the only officially certified scribe, Linda Coppleson, Irma Penn, Rabbi Hanna Klebansky, Julie Seltzer, and Aviel Barclay. The lead scribe (or \"soferet\") on the project was Shoshana Gugenheim. Gugenheim said that \"it was important to me that there would be other women scribes\". The work of the scribes was checked by Jen Taylor Friedman, who created a Scroll of Esther and was the first woman to scribe any part of the Torah in modern times. When the pages were finished, the parchment panels were further checked and minor \"tikkunim\" (corrections) made by experts in New York and Jerusalem. The individual sections were sewn together by a group of women.\n\nSpecial parchment to write the Torah, made at a factory in Israel, could be purchased only by men. In order to purchase the parchment, Rabbi Hanna Klebansky had to pretend to be purchasing the parchment for her husband. The mantle for the Torah was created by Sooze Bloom deLeon Grossman, and was created out of more than 70 pieces of fabric. Many of the pieces of fabric were formerly pieces of clothing belonging to Jewish women that were sent to Grossman for the mantle. The portions of women's belongings makes up the shape of a pomegranate on the mantle. The Torah crown was created by Aimee Golant.\n\nThe total cost of the project was nearly $100,000. The Women's Torah was dedicated on October 15, 2010. On October 16, women read from the Women's Torah for the first time during the Shabbat service.\n\nAccording to the Talmud (\"Gittin\" 45b), a Torah scroll written by a woman for ritual use is invalid. The Arba'ah Turim, however, does not prohibit women from becoming scribes. Several modern-day rabbis have presented arguments supporting the view that a woman can write a scroll for ritual use. A Conservative Israeli Rabbi, Simcha Roth, wrote that since women may learn the Torah, \"they should certainly be eligible to write a scroll\". Linda Coppleson, who is a Conservative Jew, expresses that while the Talmud forbids women from writing Torah scrolls, it also states that \"whoever is qualified should write a Torah;\" and when women have \"the same opportunities as men, it is fitting to remove them from forbidden categories\". Wendy Graff, the project's leader, said that \"if my daughter could read and study the Torah and yet not be allowed to create the scroll that is the basis of our faith, then we still have a long way to go\".\n\nMembers of the Women's Torah Project recognize that some Jewish communities do not see the Women's Torah as valid. Taylor Friedman says that it is important to keep women's Torah scrolls out of Orthodox Jewish communities. Torah scrolls written by women are not considered kosher by all Jewish communities.\n\n"}

Other instruments include the \"mangour\", a leather belt sewn with many goat hooves, and various percussion instruments.\n\nScholarship in the early 20th century attributed Abyssinian (Ethiopian) origin to the custom, although there\nwere also proposals suggesting Persian or other origins.\nThus, Frobenius suggested that \" zƒÅr\" and \"bori\", a comparable cult in Hausa culture, were ultimately derived from a Persian source. Modarressi (1986) suggests a Persian etymology for the term.\n\nThe origin of the word is unclear; Walker (1935) suggested the name of the city of Zara in northern Iran, or alternatively the Arabic root \"z-w-r\" \"to visit\" (for the possessing spirit \"visiting\" the victim). The \"Encyclopedia of Islam\" of 1934 favoured an Ethiopian origin of the word.\n\nThe spread beyond the Horn of Africa likely dates to the 18th or early 19th century, presumably introduced by Ethiopian slaves brought to the harems of the Ottoman Egypt Eyalet.\nMessing (1958) states that the cult was particularly well-developed in Northern Ethiopia (Amhara), with its center in the town of Gondar.\nOne late 19th-century traveler describes the Abyssinian \"S√°r\" cultists sacrificing a hen or goat and mixing the blood with grease and butter, in the hopes of eliminating someone's sickness. The concoction was then hidden in an alley, in the belief that all who pass through the alley would take away the patient's ailment.\n\nMirzai Asl (2002) suggests that the introduction to Iran likewise took place in the 19th century (Qajar period) by Africans brought to Iran via the Arab slave trade. \nNatvig (1988) reports that the \"zƒÅr\" cult \"served as a refuge for women and effeminate men\" in the Sahel (Sudan) region under Islamic rule.\n\nAmong extant varieties of ZƒÅr cults are \"\"zƒÅr SawƒÅknƒ´\" (the \"zƒÅr\" from the area of Suakin [\"\"Dal≈´ka\", that is, \"zƒÅr SawƒÅknƒ´\"\"]) and \"zƒÅr NyamƒÅnyam\" {cf. /NYAMe/ ('Friend'), god of the Akan} (the \"zƒÅr\" of the Azande)\": \"the Nyam-Nyam have \"zƒÅr nugƒÅra\", with Babƒ´nga and Nak≈´rma\". \"Babƒ´nga and Nak≈´rma are recognized as Azande ancestral spirits\". NugƒÅra (big drum) = \"\"nuqara\" ... of the Dega tribe ... was originally from Wau\". (Wau is in Equatoria province of Sudan.) \"Besides the nugƒÅra of the Azande, other zƒÅr cults mentioned were those of the Fartƒ´t [Fartƒ´t peoples include \"the Karra, Gula, Feroge, and Surro\"], the Shilluk people, and the Dinka people and the \"dinia\" Nuba cult\".\n\nIn Ethiopia, \"zƒÅr\" is used as a term for malevolent spirits or demons. At the same time, many Ethiopians believe in benevolent, protective spirits, or \"abdar\".\n\nBelief in such spirits is widespread among both Christians and Muslims. \nAs is usual in African animism, and in pre-modern folk belief in general, what would be termed mental illness in modern psychiatry is attributed to spirit possession.\n\"ƒ§ƒì·π≠\" (\"thread\") is a term of for the possessing spirits. \"Tumbura\" is another term. Named individual \"tumbura\" include: \"Nuba, Banda, Gumuz, SawƒÅkiniyya, Lamb≈´nƒÅt, BƒÅb≈´rƒÅt, BƒÅshawƒÅt, KhawƒÅjƒÅt\". Depending on which spirit an individual is possessed by, they will don different costumes, such a traditional loincloth for \"Nuba\", a straw loincloth for \"Bada\", \na red fez for \"BƒÅ≈õawƒÅt\", and a pith-helmet and khaki shorts for \"ƒ§awƒÅjƒÅt\".\n\nAccording to legend, there are eighty-eight \"S√°roch\", emissaries of evil all under the service of a spirit named \"Warobal Mama\", who dwells in lake Alobar in the Menz region.\n\nZƒÅr beliefs are common today even among Ethiopian immigrants to North America, Europe, or Israel. For example, Beta Israel are often raised with both Jewish and ZƒÅr beliefs, and individuals who believe they house a spirit are bound to attend to it despite other demands. However, ceremonies can be performed by shamans to persuade a spirit to leave, thus releasing the person from their duties to that spirit.\n\nIn southern Iran, \"zƒÅr\" is interpreted as a \"harmful wind\" assumed to cause discomfort or illness. Types of such winds include \"Maturi, ≈†ay·∏µ ≈†angar, DingemƒÅru, OmagƒÅre, Bumaryom, Pepe, BƒÅbur, Bibi, Namrud\". The film \"The African-Baluchi Trance Dance\" is a 2012 film that depicts a variety of \"zar\"-related activities in southeastern Iran.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
