{"id": "15847948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15847948", "title": "Affirmative prayer", "text": "Affirmative prayer\n\nAffirmative prayer is a form of prayer or a metaphysical technique that is focused on a positive outcome rather than a negative situation. For instance, a person who is experiencing some form of illness would focus the prayer on the desired state of perfect health and affirm this desired intention \"as if already happened\" rather than identifying the illness and then asking God for help to eliminate it.\n\nNew Thought spirituality originated during the 1880s and has emphasized affirmative prayer as an essential part of its philosophy. Practitioners among the various New Thought denominations Religious Science, Divine Science and Unity may also refer to this form of prayer by such names as \"scientific prayer,\" \"spiritual mind treatment\" or, simply, \"treatment.\"\n\nWithin New Thought organizations, centers and churches, the foundational logic of this form of prayer is based on the belief that God is unlimited and plays no favorites, that God has created spiritual laws that are both as mysterious and as constant as scientific principles like gravity, and thus, if one's prayer is correctly and diligently focused, it will be answered consistently.\n\nAffirmative prayer is called \"Spiritual Mind Treatment\" by practitioners of Religious Science.\n\nAffirmative prayer with a Christian theme is a central practice of the Unity School of Christianity.\n\nIn the early 1900s, some in the American Jewish community were attracted to the teachings of Christian Science and the New Thought Movement, by the 1920s they were referring to their study by the term \"Jewish Science\". A major figure in this movement was Morris Lichtenstein who together with his wife Tehilla Lichtenstein, published the \"Jewish Science Interpreter\", a periodical featuring much of his own writing. Lichtenstein found affirmative prayer to be particularly useful because, he believed that it provided the personal benefits of prayer without requiring the belief in a supernatural God who could suspend the laws of nature. Lichtenstein considered that affirmative prayer is a method that can access inner power that could be considered divine, but not supernatural. He taught that the origins of affirmative prayer can be found in the Old Testament book of Psalms, and that affirmations, or affirmative prayer is best offered in silence.\n\nThe well-known Theosophist, Spiritualist, and New Thought poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox popularized the power of affirmative prayer. After the death of her husband Robert Wilcox, she wrote that she had tried in vain to communicate with his spirit, but only after she composed and recited the affirmative prayer, \"I am the living witness: The dead live: And they speak through us and to us: And I am the voice that gives this glorious truth to the suffering world: I am ready, God: I am ready, Christ: I am ready, Robert\" was she able to contact him by means of a Ouija board, an event she described in her 1918 autobiography, \"The Worlds and I.\"\n\nAffirmative prayer is used by practitioners of African American hoodoo, usually in conjunction with its opposite, which is called a \"prayer of removal\". In this folk magic application of the technique, the prayer of removal may be said during a waning moon or at sunset or at ebb tide (\"As the sun goes down, this disease is removed from my body\") and the affirmative prayer may be said during a waxing moon, at dawn, or at high tide (\"As the sun rises, this day brings me perfect health\").\n\nThe explanation for this application of affirmative prayer is that God has ordained laws of natural inflow and outflow, and that by linking one's prayer to a natural condition that prevails at the time, the prayer is given the added power of God's planned natural event.\n\nWilliam James described affirmative prayer as an element of the American metaphysical healing movement that he called the \"mind-cure\"; he described it as America's \"only decidedly original contribution to the systemic philosophy of life.\"\n\nWhat sets affirmative prayer apart from secular affirmations of the autosuggestion type taught by the 19th century self-help author Émile Coué (whose most famous affirmation was \"Every day in every way, I am getting better and better\") is that affirmative prayer addresses the practitioner to God, the Divine, the Creative Mind, emphasizing the seemingly practical aspects of religious belief.\n\nSome members of the self-help and self-improvement movements advocate affirmative prayer in addition to or instead of secular affirmations. The choice is largely an individual one, based on the beliefs of the practitioner.\n\n"}

{"id": "24848516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24848516", "title": "Cantor in Reform Judaism", "text": "Cantor in Reform Judaism\n\nThe cantor ( \"hazzan\") in the Reform movement is a clergy member who fills a diverse role within the Jewish community. Cantors lead worship, officiate at lifecycle events, teach adults and children, run synagogue music programs, and offer pastoral care. Cantors typically serve along with other clergy members, usually rabbis and occasionally additional cantors, in partnership to lead synagogue communities. The Reform cantor is a professional office with a prescribed educational path and professional organization. Cantors are \"invested\", a term borrowed from the idea of priestly vestments, at the conclusion of study. \"Investiture\" confers the status of clergy to cantors, just as \"ordination\" does for rabbis.\n\nAs of 2011, a decision has been made to \"ordain\" rather than \"invest\" cantors.\n\nCantors in the North American Reform Movement are trained by the Hebrew Union College – Jewish Institute of Religion, School of Sacred Music. Located near New York University, the school offers the degree of Master of Sacred Music. Upon graduation, students receive formal ordination as cantor and then become eligible for membership in the American Conference of Cantors, the professional organization for cantors.\n\nThe School of Sacred Music was established in 1948 as a response to the \"growing number of Reform congregations... prepared to employ a cantor if qualified individuals could be found,\" under the leadership of Eric Werner. American synagogues in the mid-twentieth century were increasingly populated by second generation American Jews and Jews who viewed themselves as fully American. These communities could no longer relate to the European-trained cantors of their communal past. Judah Cohen observes that \"the American cantorial school rose on the crest of both a revival and reevaluation of the cantor in the postwar era. Placing standards of cantorial knowledge and ability within a curricular framework,\" the School of Sacred Music \"attempted to improve the cantor's religious standing.\"\n\nAt its inception, the SSM was the first and only American cantorial school and sought to educate cantors to serve all American Jewish communities. While the school's founders, including the influential members of The Society for the Advancement of Jewish Liturgical Music, articulated their desire to create a cantorial school for all of American Jewry, particular attention was given to serving the Reform Movement's specific needs since the SSM's inception. HUC Dean Franzlblau conducted an exploratory survey of North American Reform congregations to gauge their \"receptivity to cantor-educators in 1948.\" The results of the study revealed that congregations would be most receptive to hiring well-trained cantors who were prepared to take on significant education roles in synagogues. The school's earliest curriculum responded to this need, training what were called \"cantor-educators,\" or cantors with additional training in education. Cantorial certification was awarded after three years of study. The SSM has since undergone a significant evolution, first offering a bachelor's degree in four years, beginning in the fall of 1953), and ultimately conferring a Master of Sacred Music over the course of five years and culminating with investiture as cantor.\n\nToday, the curriculum of the SSM includes liturgical music classes covering traditional Shabbat, High Holiday and Festival nusach, Chorus, Musicology, Reform Liturgy and Composition; Judaica and text classes such as Bible, Midrash and History; and professional development. Each student is assigned practica (mini-recitals) during the second, third and fourth years of school culminating with a Senior Recital (based on a thesis) during the fifth year. As of 2011, the institution was renamed the Debbie Friedman School of Sacred Music.\n\nSuccessful completion of the five-year School of Sacred Music program allows the newly ordained cantor membership in the American Conference of Cantors. This professional organization was established in 1953 by the early graduates of the SSM. The ACC currently serves over 450 cantors, offering conventions, newsletters, a listserve, and placement support.\nThe ACC is the professional organization of over 450 invested and/or certified cantors. Responsible for raising the professional standards of synagogue musicians, the ACC offers continuing education programs in conjunction with HUC-JIR School of Sacred Music and professional development opportunities for its members.\nMembers of the ACC have special expertise in the music of the Jewish people and serve synagogues and communities in pastoral, worship, programming, and educational roles. The ACC sponsors an annual convention and publishes Koleinu, a regular newsletter. It also offers placement services to its members and URJ congregations through the Joint Cantorial Placement Commission. The American Conference of Cantors is an affiliate of the Union for Reform Judaism.\n\nIn 1968, Sally Priesand became the first woman accepted for rabbinic training at Hebrew Union College. When Sally Priesand was ordained in 1972, she became the first female rabbi in America. Following the ordination, the Reform Movement of Judaism also began accrediting female music students for formal cantorial studies. In 1975, Barbara Ostfeld-Horowitz became the first woman to be ordained as a female cantor. Following graduation, she received pulpit placement and was inducted into the American Conference of Cantors, the professional organization for cantors. Ostfeld's investiture \"marked an era of rapid demographic change\" at the SSM, investing more than 179 female cantors. Reflecting on her profession, Ostfeld-Horowitz writes, “Women cantors have altered the way in which prayer is offered, heard, and received.” \n\nProminent historian of the cantorate Mark Slobin explores the evolution of the office of the cantor in his work \"Chosen Voices:The Story of the American Cantorate\". Slobin outlines the journey of cantor as a sacred singer who would find employment by responding to positions posted in the newspaper in the 1930s to the formalized process of cantor/congregation matchmaking now in place. The creation of the School of Sacred Music in 1948 marks the beginning of the cantor as a modern professional. At the inception of the SSM, the role of the cantor in the American synagogue was so narrow that the concept of the \"cantor-educator\" was created so that the newly minted cantors would have the additional skill set of \"educator\" so that they could serve congregations in a full-time capacity. The school abandoned the notion of the \"cantor-educator\" as the perception of the modern cantorate expanded to include the duties now associated with the role of the full-time cantor. The role of today's Reform cantor includes inspiring others in the act of worship, serving as an authority on Religious Jewish music, teaching all members of their community, helping to build strong Jewish identities, offering pastoral care, and officiating at life cycle events. Even though the cantor fills a diverse role in the modern Reform synagogue, the \"heart of the cantorate\" remains in \"the sanctuary,\" leading the Jewish people in prayer.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26261391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26261391", "title": "Cetiya", "text": "Cetiya\n\nCetiya, \"reminders\" or \"memorials\" (Sanskrit \"caitya\"), are objects and places used by Theravada Buddhists to remember Gautama Buddha. According to Damrong Rajanubhab, four kinds are distinguished in the Pāli Canon: \"Relic [Dhatu], Memorial [Paribhoga], Teaching [Dhamma], and votive [Udesaka].\" Griswold, in contrast, states that three are traditional and the fourth, the dhamma, was added later to remind monks that the true memory of Gautama Buddha can be found in his teachings. While these can be broadly called Buddhist symbolism, the emphasis tends to be on a historical connection to the Buddha and not a metaphysical one.\n\nThe sārīraka (Sanskrit śarīra) or dhātu cetiya, the remains of Gautama Buddha's body, are the category commonly considered \"relics\" today by Western observers, and were responsible for major forms of Buddhist art and symbolism, although they only constitute one of the three categories of reminders. Most frequently preserved parts of Buddha's body are tooth and bone, because these parts would remain after the rest of the body decayed. The relic of the tooth of the Buddha in Sri Lanka is the most notable site where a relic is visibly preserved, but hundreds of such sites were created, in the architectural form now called a stupa. In Thai, these stupas are called \"chedī\", retaining the second half of the phrase \"dhātu cetiya\"; in Lao, they are called \"that\" after the first half. Beyond the stupa itself, sārīraka are used across the Buddhist world, in such quantity that not all could be legitimate; in this sense the sārīraka functions mainly as a symbol, with the importance of authenticity varying between cultures.\n\nMore relics of bone were discovered during archaeological excavations of a stupa built in what is now Peshawar by Kanishka of the Kushan Empire in the second century. In 1909, three pieces of bone (approx 1½ in. or 3.8 cm long) were found in a crystal reliquary in a bronze casket bearing an effigy of Kanishka and an inscription recording his gift. They were removed to Mandalay in 1910 by Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto, the Governor-General of India, for safekeeping. They were originally kept in a stupa in Mandalay but it has become dilapidated and is used as housing. The relics are being kept in a nearby monastery until funds can be found to build a new stupa to house the relics next to Mandalay Hill. The crystal reliquary holding the bones is now enclosed in a gold and ruby casket provided by Burmese devotees. The miniature gold stupa in which they were transported to Mandalay may be seen in the photo to the right of the modern ruby and gold reliquary.\n\nThe body parts of especially powerful monks are also called sārīraka, but these usually take on the form of bright jewels formed during the cremation of the body.\n\nThe paribhoga cetiya, things used by the Buddha, would seem at first to be a nonexistent category today. However, temples such as Tongdosa in South Korea claim to keep his robe and begging bowl. The category also includes all places the Buddha visited, so Bodh Gaya itself functions as a paribhogaka. The most common paribhogaka is the Bodhi Tree, which was transplanted across Southeast Asia; cuttings of the original bodhi tree still survive today in Sri Lanka.\nAnother extremely common paribhoga cetiya is the Buddha footprint, which are found across the Buddhist world symbolizing the ground that Buddha walked on and the powerful size of his dhammakāya. Sometimes these footprints are also classed as udesaka, a representation of the Buddha's foot, or sārīraka, implying that the footprint was the foot itself.\n\nThe final category, udesaka or uddesika cetiya, literally translates as \"indicative reminders\" or \"votive objects\", for example images of the Buddha. Udesaka do not have any physical connection to the Buddha but still serve as relics because they were created in his memory. Originally udesaka were secondary to paribhogaka and sārīraka, but with the influence of Greco-Buddhism, statues of the Buddha were produced in great numbers, followed later by paintings and other images. The dharmachakra \"wheel of the dharma\", falls under this category as a reminder of Buddhist insight.\n\nThe conventional view has long been this meant that early Buddhist art was aniconic. However, this view has recently been the subject of debate among specialists. There does not seem to have been any prohibition of creating images of the Buddha. Rather, creating images of the paribhogaka was regarded as a more fulfilling and meaningful symbol by the early Buddhists, evoking the discovery of Buddhist understanding (pañña). Whether these scenes contained \"substitutes\" for the image of Buddha himself is currently under debate.\n\n\n"}

He asked his mother, \"...what made the woman float in the air?\"\n\n\"Magic,\" his mother said. \n\nDoug went on to say that he still remembered that feeling. The shy Doug wanted to re-create that same emotion he felt.\n\nHe performed his first show at the age of 14 at the birthday party of a friend and was inspired by his audience's spellbound reaction. Within a few months of placing an ad in a local newspaper, Henning launched a series of performances on local television in Toronto, and as an entertainer at parties.\n\nAfter Henning graduated high school, he stopped doing magic not wanting to do it for a living. He felt that there was only two kinds of magicians, \"...magicians for kids, and magicians for nightclub acts. I didn't want to be either kind.\"\n\nSo, instead, he enrolled and became a student at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and studied psychology. and prepared for a medical degree. It was there that Henning met Ivan Reitman when he appeared in the 1968 Reitman-directed production of \"Li'l Abner\" in the role of Lonesome Polecat.\n\nTo support himself during this time, he worked at the Toronto International Airport loading and unloading crates. He found the work to be too heavy and tiring. So with the help of a female assistant, he formed the partnership of Henning and Mars and performed at local bars and nightclubs.\n\nIt was because of the shows he was giving at those nightclubs Henning decided to take a couple of years off from school. After graduating with honors with a degree in Science and psychology, Doug decided to take a couple of years off before entering medical school to continue with his magic. Henning and Mars successful performed with the top entertainers in Canada and traveled from one end of the country to the other.\nHe soon realized that he needed more theatrical training as well as the principles of magic. He applied for a grant with the Canada Council Arts Bursary in the theater division with a proposal that used the equation that magic plus theater equals art. Henning was awarded a Canada Council for the Arts grant for $ 4,000.\n\nAfter being awarded the grant for a one year study of the art of magic, he studied mime under Adrian Pecknold as well as dance with a Canadian choreographer. He sifted through magic literature in the hopes of developing an all-around magic education in manipulation and being an illusionist.\n\nHe made a trip to the Magic Castle in Hollywood, California. The Magic Castle is a private club for magicians. He did an impromptu performance in the Wine Cellar and met resident magician and guru Dai Vernon known as \"The Professor\". The terms of the grant required Henning to study magic. Later on in the year, he got up the nerve to write the Professor and asked him if he could take lessons with him. Soon after, Vernon said yes. He did so, traveling to Hollywood to study with Vernon, then with another magic great Slydini and considered him his primary teacher of magic.\n\nWith the intention of returning magic to its \"glory days\", Henning worked to perfect his craft. Garnering financial support, he developed a live theatrical show, \"Spellbound\". It was there that he contacted his college friend Ivan Reitman, who directed Spellbound. Along with music by Howard Shore and co-starring actress Jennifer Dale, a musical that combined a dramatic story and Henning's magic tricks.\n\nDoug borrowed money for the project and spent $5,000 to build and design illusions. They set up a backers audition in Toronto. One man did find potential in the project and invested $70,000 into the show. It took a long time to work out a plot around Doug's illusion. So much so they only had time for two dress rehearsals neither of which was in the theater.\n\nThe show opened at the Royal Alexandra Theatre in Toronto, where it broke box-office records. Henning reworked the show after catching the attention of New York producers, and took it to Broadway as \"The Magic Show\", with songs composed by Stephen Schwartz. Debuting in 1974, the show ran for four and a half years, and earned Henning a Tony Award nomination.\n\nFollowing his Broadway success, Henning approached NBC with the idea of producing a television special. It was not until Henning suggested that he would reproduce live Harry Houdini's famous and dangerous water-torture escape—for the first time since Houdini performed it himself—that the NBC executives signed him.\n\nHenning spent the next eight months reworking his stage act for TV and practicing the water-torture escape act. More than 50 million viewers tuned in for the December 1975 broadcast of \"Doug Henning's World of Magic,\" hosted by Bill Cosby.\n\nIn 1977, Henning co-wrote a biography of Houdini, \"Houdini: His Legend and His Magic\". He created illusions for an Earth, Wind and Fire tour in 1979, and for two of singer Michael Jackson's concerts, including his 1984 Victory Tour.\n\nAfter a brief marriage, Henning divorced Barbara De Angelis in 1981 and married Debby Douillard in the Ladies' Dome in Fairfield, Iowa, in December of that year.\n\nIn 1983, Henning was the producer and star of the Broadway musical \"Merlin\". In 1984, he began a solo show on Broadway called \"Doug Henning and His World of Magic.\"\n\nIn 1985, a set of plush toys called \"Doug & Debby Henning's: WONDER WHIMS\" were made by Panosh Place and copyrighted by Marvin Glass and Associates. There were a total of six Wonder Whim characters. Each came with an animal friend, a personalized story, and a magic kaleidoscope wand of colors and patterns.\n\nIn 1986 Henning sold his illusions to David Copperfield and other magicians to devote his time to Transcendental Meditation.\n\nDoug Henning's first \"World of Magic\" special aired on NBC on December 26, 1975. Henning successfully performed the water torture illusion, although he did not break Houdini's time record. Produced by famed talk show host David Susskind and sponsored by Mobil, the show ran live in the eastern United States without commercials. The event was the first of seven annual broadcasts, which would eventually bring Henning seven Emmy Award nominations, including two back-to-back in 1976 and 1977 for \"World of Magic\".\n\nIn December 1976, \"Doug Henning's World of Magic II\" aired, again live and with only two commercial breaks, on NBC. The theme for this show was \"Fire, Water and Air\" and it was hosted by actor Michael Landon, with guest star Joey Heatherton. The show included Henning vanishing an elephant and also included a segment with special guest magician Ricky Jay.\n\nOn December 15, 1977, \"Doug Henning's World of Magic III\" aired live with guests Glen Campbell and Sandy Duncan; the hyped illusion was \"Walking Through a Brick Wall\".\n\nOn December 14, 1978, \"Doug Henning's World of Magic IV\" aired with the theme \"A Magical Journey Through Time\"; however, due to numerous problems that occurred during the telecast, this was the last special broadcast live.\n\nOn February 15, 1979, there was a broadcast of the fifth World of Magic special, which was taped at the Las Vegas Hilton.\n\n\"Doug Henning's World of Magic VI\", taped at Osmond Studios in Orem, Utah, is broadcast February 22, 1980 on NBC. Bill Cosby made his second appearance as special guest. Marie Osmond also appeared on the program. Several revamped versions of illusions from earlier specials appeared. The finale was an escape and reappearance featuring a huge Rube Goldberg machine.\n\nHenning's last TV special was \"World of Magic VII\" in 1982, which featured guest Bruce Jenner and several revamped versions of illusions from earlier specials. The theme was Henning's magical house with rooms featuring magic from the past, present and future. In the show's finale, Henning creates the illusion of turning a black horse and a white horse into a zebra.\n\nAt the end of each \"World of Magic\" performance, Henning addressed the audience with the same monologue: \"Anything the mind can conceive is possible. Nothing is impossible. All you have to do is look within, and you can realize your fondest dreams. I would like to wish each one of you all of life's wonders and a joyful age of enlightenment.\"\n\nOn December 13, 1977, Henning appeared as a guest on \"The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson\". While Henning performed illusions and chatted with host Johnny Carson and his other guests, he also plugged his new book on Houdini and announced that he was to marry Barbara De Angelis in a week.\n\nIn 1979 Henning appeared on \"The Crystal Gayle Special\", a variety program starring singer Crystal Gayle and featuring, along with Henning, B.B. King and the Statler Brothers.\n\nIn 1980, Henning appeared on \"The Muppet Show\" where he performed several acts. He demonstrated chink-a-chink for Kermit the Frog's nephew Robin, segmented a Muppet monster into four pieces (and put him together wrong), and performed The Metamorphosis: a bit where he swapped places with an assistant who was locked inside a trunk.\n\nIn December, Henning appeared in \"The Osmond Family Christmas Special\". Starring the popular brother/sister act Donny and Marie Osmond and guesting with such entertainers as Peggy Flemming and Greg Evigan, at the time star of NBC's \"B.J. and the Bear\".\n\nOn February 13, 1981, Henning made his seventh appearance on \"The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson\". This show marked the first time Henning is Carson's first guest.\n\nA version of \"The Magic Show\" was mounted in Toronto at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre. The purpose of this show was to film in front of a live audience of several thousand people for broadcast on CBC Television. Henning came back to the show that had made him a star, and many changes were made for this new production. Notably, most of the cast was changed, specifically the role of Cal, now performed by Didi Conn. Some script changes were made (the night club was now known as \"Chez Manny\" and the older, drunk magician was now named \"Van Zyskin\"). Some of the songs in the Broadway version were also changed (notably the risqué lyrics of Charmin's lament), or replaced totally, such as the song \"Solid Silver Platform Shoes\" (the once popular shoe style, by then out of fashion) which was replaced with \"It's Gonna Take a Magician.\" The film version of the production was only aired once on Canadian television, but released on DVD decades later.\n\nHenning was featured in television commercials during 1984 to promote the Plymouth Voyager minivan.\n\nIn 1993 he released a video for the Canada Natural Law Party made up of excerpts from his World of Magic specials along with newly recorded linking dialogue detailing Doug's philosophy of how the world's problems could be solved by meditation and yogic flying.\n\nIn the mid 1980s, Henning retired from the stage and had an increasing interest in Transcendental Meditation. He received a Ph.D in the Science of Creative Intelligence from the Maharishi University in Switzerland.\n\nIn 1992, Henning and Transcendental Meditation founder, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi drafted plans for a $1.5 billion-dollar project called \"Maharishi Veda Land\" near Niagara Falls, Ontario that would \"combine astonishing, unique visual and sensory effects, state-of-the-art 3D imagery, and ultra high-tech entertainment technology with his best and most original magic illusion secrets\". Attractions were to include a building suspended above water and a journey into the heart of a rose but as of 2000 the project's status was uncertain.\n\nIn 1992, Henning was a Natural Law Party candidate in the United Kingdom's general election, contesting the Parliamentary constituency of Blackpool South in Lancashire. As a Canadian citizen, Henning qualified as a candidate under British electoral law, which allows candidates from Commonwealth nations. He finished fourth of four candidates, polling 173 votes. He was senior vice president of the Natural Law Party of Canada (\"NLPC\"), and ran as the party's candidate for the former Toronto riding of Rosedale in the 1993 federal election, finishing sixth out of ten candidates.\n\nHenning died aged 52 in February 2000 at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles five months after being diagnosed with liver cancer. His ashes were scattered in the Pacific Ocean off Redondo Beach, California.\n\nJames Randi, a fellow Canadian magician and prominent skeptic, was critical of Henning's involvement with Transcendental Meditation (TM). In 2008, Randi asserted in his blog, \"SWIFT\", that TM founder Maharishi Mahesh Yogi had \"caused the death of my friend Doug Henning\". He claimed that Henning had immersed himself so thoroughly in TM that he \"abandoned regular medical treatment for liver cancer, continued to pursue his diet of nuts and berries, and died of the disease.\"\n\nIn 2005, a handwritten letter from Doug Henning to James Randi was placed for auction on eBay, unbeknownst to Randi. When Randi learned of it, he announced on his blog that the letter had been \"stolen\" from his files. A week later, Randi wrote that he \"managed to have the sale stopped\" and that the letter was back in his possession but did not elaborate on further details of the controversy.\n\nOn June 8, 2010, it was announced that Henning would receive a star on Canada's Walk of Fame. His \"Zig Zag Girl\" illusion is housed at the American Museum of Magic.\n\nA book entitled \"Spellbound: The Wonder-filled Life of Doug Henning\" by John Harrison was released in 2009 to good reviews.\n\n"}

Gann published in 1950 dealing with the redemption of a petty criminal escaping the authorities by working as a seaman for his passage after stowing away.\n\nThe author Richard McKenna wrote a story, first published in 1967, entitled \"Fiddler's Green\", in which he considers the power of the mind to create a reality of its own choosing, especially when a number of people consent to it.

{"id": "20198238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20198238", "title": "First Persian invasion of Greece", "text": "First Persian invasion of Greece\n\nThe first Persian invasion of Greece, during the Persian Wars, began in 492 BC, and ended with the decisive Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC. The invasion, consisting of two distinct campaigns, was ordered by the Persian king Darius I primarily in order to punish the city-states of Athens and Eretria. These cities had supported the cities of Ionia during their revolt against Persian rule, thus incurring the wrath of Darius. Darius also saw the opportunity to extend his empire into Europe, and to secure its western frontier.\n\nThe first campaign in 492 BC, led by Mardonius, re-subjugated Thrace and forced Macedon to become a fully subordinate client kingdom part of Persia, after being a vassal to Persia as early as the late 6th century BC. However, further progress was prevented when Mardonius's fleet was wrecked in a storm off the coast of Mount Athos. The following year, having demonstrated his intentions, Darius sent ambassadors to all parts of Greece, demanding their submission. He received it from almost all of them, except Athens and Sparta, both of whom executed the ambassadors. With Athens still defiant, and Sparta now effectively at war with him, Darius ordered a further military campaign for the following year.\n\nThe second Persian campaign, in 490 BC, was under the command of Datis and Artaphernes. The expedition headed first to the island Naxos, which it captured and burned. It then island-hopped between the rest of the Cycladic Islands, annexing each into the Persian empire. Reaching Greece, the expedition landed at Eretria, which it besieged, and after a brief time, captured. Eretria was razed and its citizens enslaved. Finally, the task force headed to Attica, landing at Marathon, en route for Athens. There, it was met by a smaller Athenian army, which nevertheless proceeded to win a remarkable victory at the Battle of Marathon.\n\nThis defeat prevented the successful conclusion of the campaign, and the task force returned to Asia. Nevertheless, the expedition had fulfilled most of its aims, punishing Naxos and Eretria, and bringing much of the Aegean under Persian rule, as well as the full inclusion of Macedon. The unfinished business from this campaign led Darius to prepare for a much larger invasion of Greece, to firmly subjugate it, and to punish Athens and Sparta. However, internal strife within the empire delayed this expedition, and Darius then died of old age. It was thus left to his son Xerxes I to lead the second Persian invasion of Greece, beginning in 480 BC.\n\nThe main source for the Greco-Persian Wars is the Greek historian Herodotus. Herodotus, who has been called the 'Father of History', was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (Greek—\"Historia\"; English—\"(The) Histories\") around 440–430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC). Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as we know it. As the British author Tom Holland has it: \"For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally.\"\n\nSome subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised Herodotus, starting with Thucydides. Nevertheless, Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the Siege of Sestos), and therefore evidently felt that Herodotus's history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting. Plutarch criticised Herodotus in his essay \"On The Malignity of Herodotus\", describing Herodotus as \"Philobarbaros\" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that Herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed. A negative view of Herodotus was passed on to Renaissance Europe, though he remained well read. However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events. The prevailing modern view is that Herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his \"Historia\", but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism. Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe Herodotus made up much of his story.\n\nThe Sicilian historian Diodorus Siculus, writing in the 1st century BC in his \"Bibliotheca Historica\", also provides an account of the Greco-Persian wars, partially derived from the earlier Greek historian Ephorus. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus's. The Greco-Persian wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, Ctesias of Cnidus, and are alluded by other authors, such as the playwright Aeschylus. Archaeological evidence, such as the Serpent Column, also supports some of Herodotus's specific claims.\n\nThe first Persian invasion of Greece had its immediate roots in the Ionian Revolt, the earliest phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. However, it was also the result of the longer-term interaction between the Greeks and Persians. In 500 BC the Persian Empire was still relatively young and highly expansionist, but prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples. Moreover, the Persian king Darius was a usurper, and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule. Even before the Ionian Revolt, Darius had begun to expand the Empire into Europe, subjugating Thrace, expanding past the Danube river, conquering Paeonia, and forcing Macedon to become a client kingdom to Persia; though the latter retaining an amount of autonomy up to 492 BC. Attempts at further expansion into the politically fractious world of Ancient Greece may have been inevitable. However, the Ionian Revolt had directly threatened the integrity of the Persian empire, and the states of mainland Greece remained a potential menace to its future stability. Darius thus resolved to subjugate and pacify Greece and the Aegean, and to punish those involved in the Ionian Revolt.\n\nThe Ionian revolt had begun with an unsuccessful expedition against Naxos, a joint venture between the Persian satrap Artaphernes and the Miletus tyrant Aristagoras. In the aftermath, Artaphernes decided to remove Aristagoras from power, but before he could do so, Aristagoras abdicated, and declared Miletus a democracy. The other Ionian cities, ripe for rebellion, followed suit, ejecting their Persian-appointed tyrants, and declaring themselves democracies. Aristagoras then appealed to the states of Mainland Greece for support, but only Athens and Eretria offered to send troops.\nThe involvement of Athens in the Ionian Revolt arose from a complex set of circumstances, beginning with the establishment of the Athenian Democracy in the late 6th century BC.\nIn 510 BC, with the aid of Cleomenes I, King of Sparta, the Athenian people had expelled Hippias, the tyrant ruler of Athens. With Hippias's father Peisistratus, the family had ruled for 36 out of the previous 50 years and fully intended to continue Hippias's rule. Hippias fled to Sardis to the court of the Persian satrap, Artaphernes, and promised control of Athens to the Persians if they were to help restore him. In the meantime, Cleomenes helped install a pro-Spartan tyranny under Isagoras in Athens, in opposition to Cleisthenes, the leader of the traditionally powerful Alcmaeonidae family, who considered themselves the natural heirs to the rule of Athens. In a daring response, Cleisthenes proposed to the Athenian people that he would establish a 'democracy' in Athens, much to the horror of the rest of the aristocracy. Cleisthenes's reasons for suggesting such a radical course of action, which would remove much of his own family's power, are unclear; perhaps he perceived that days of aristocratic rule were coming to an end anyway; certainly he wished to prevent Athens becoming a puppet of Sparta by whatever means necessary. However, as a result of this proposal, Cleisthenes and his family were exiled from Athens, in addition to other dissenting elements, by Isagoras. Having been promised democracy however, the Athenian people seized the moment and revolted, expelling Cleomenes and Isagoras. Cleisthenes was thus restored to Athens (507 BC), and at breakneck speed began to establish democratic government. The establishment of democracy revolutionised Athens, which henceforth became one of the leading cities in Greece. The new-found freedom and self-governance of the Athenians meant that they were thereafter exceptionally hostile to the return of the tyranny of Hippias, or any form of outside subjugation; by Sparta, Persia or anyone else. \n\nCleomenes, unsurprisingly, was not pleased with events, and marched on Athens with the Spartan army. Cleomenes's attempts to restore Isagoras to Athens ended in a debacle, but fearing the worst, the Athenians had by this point already sent an embassy to Artaphernes in Sardis, to request aid from the Persian Empire. Artaphernes requested that the Athenians give him a 'earth and water', a traditional token of submission, which the Athenian ambassadors acquiesced to. However, they were severely censured for this when they returned to Athens. At some point later Cleomenes instigated a plot to restore Hippias to the rule of Athens. This failed and Hippias again fled to Sardis and tried to persuade the Persians to subjugate Athens. The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to Artaphernes to dissuade him from taking action, but Artaphernes merely instructed the Athenians to take Hippias back as tyrant. Needless to say, the Athenians balked at this, and resolved instead to be openly at war with Persia. Having thus become the enemy of Persia, Athens was already in a position to support the Ionian cities when they began their revolt. The fact that the Ionian democracies were inspired by the example of Athens no doubt further persuaded the Athenians to support the Ionian Revolt; especially since the cities of Ionia were (supposedly) originally Athenian colonies.\n\nThe city of Eretria also sent assistance to the Ionians for reasons that are not completely clear. Possibly commercial reasons were a factor; Eretria was a mercantile city, whose trade was threatened by Persian dominance of the Aegean. Herodotus suggests that the Eretrians supported the revolt in order to repay the support the Milesians had given Eretria in a past war against Chalcis.\n\nThe Athenians and Eretrians sent a task force of 25 triremes to Asia Minor. Whilst there, the Greek army surprised and outmaneuvered Artaphernes, marching to Sardis and there burning the lower city. However, this was as much as the Greeks achieved, and they were then pursued back to the coast by Persian horsemen, losing many men in the process. Despite the fact their actions were ultimately fruitless, the Eretrians and in particular the Athenians had earned Darius's lasting enmity, and he vowed to punish both cities. The Persian naval victory at the Battle of Lade (494 BC) all but ended the Ionian Revolt, and by 493 BC, the last hold-outs were vanquished by the Persian fleet. The revolt was used as an opportunity by Darius to extend the empire's border to the islands of the East Aegean and the Propontis, which had not been part of the Persian dominions before. The completion of the pacification of Ionia allowed the Persians to begin planning their next moves; to extinguish the threat to the empire from Greece, and to punish Athens and Eretria.\n\nIn the spring of 492 BC an expeditionary force, to be commanded by Darius's son-in-law Mardonius, was assembled, consisting of a fleet and a land army. Whilst the ultimate aim was to punish Athens and Eretria, the expedition also aimed to subdue as many of the Greek cities as possible. Departing from Cilicia, Mardonius sent the army to march to the Hellespont, whilst he travelled with the fleet. He sailed round the coast of Asia Minor to Ionia, where he spent a short time abolishing the tyrannies that ruled the cities of Ionia. Ironically, since the establishment of democracies had been a key factor in the Ionian Revolt, he replaced the tyrannies with democracies.\n\nThence the fleet continued on to the Hellespont, and when all was ready, shipped the land forces across to Europe. The army then marched through Thrace, re-subjugating it, since these lands had already been added to the Persian Empire in 512 BC, during Darius's campaign against the Scythians. Upon reaching Macedon, the Persians forced it to become a fully subordinate part of the Persian Empire; they had been vassals of the Persians since the late 6th century BC, but retained their general autonomy.\n\nMeanwhile, the fleet crossed to Thasos, resulting in the Thasians submitting to the Persians. The fleet then rounded the coastline as far as Acanthus in Chalcidice, before attempting to round the headland of Mount Athos. However, they were caught in a violent storm, which drove them against the coastline of Athos, wrecking (according to Herodotus) 300 ships, with the loss of 20,000 men.\n\nThen, whilst the army was camped in Macedon, the Brygians, a local Thracian tribe, launched a night raid against the Persian camp, killing many of the Persians, and wounding Mardonius. Despite his injury, Mardonius made sure that the Brygians were defeated and subjugated, before leading his army back to the Hellespont; the remnants of the navy also retreated to Asia. Although this campaign ended ingloriously, the land approaches to Greece had been secured, and the Greeks had no doubt been made aware of Darius's intentions for them.\n\nPerhaps reasoning that the expedition of the previous year may have made his plans for Greece obvious, and weakened the resolve of the Greek cities, Darius turned to diplomacy in 491 BC. He sent ambassadors to all the Greek city states, asking for \"earth and water\", a traditional token of submission. The vast majority of cities did as asked, fearing the wrath of Darius. In Athens, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed; in Sparta, they were simply thrown down a well. This firmly and finally drew the battle-lines for the coming conflict; Sparta and Athens, despite their recent enmity, would together fight the Persians.\n\nHowever, Sparta was then thrown into disarray by internal machinations. The citizens of Aegina had submitted to the Persian ambassadors, and the Athenians, troubled by the possibility of Persia using Aegina as a naval base, asked Sparta to intervene. Cleomenes travelled to Aegina to confront the Aeginetans personally, but they appealed to Cleomenes's fellow king Demaratus, who supported their stance. Cleomenes responded by having Demaratus declared illegitimate, with the help of the priests at Delphi (whom he bribed); Demaratus was replaced by his cousin Leotychides. Now faced with two Spartan kings, the Aeginetans capitulated, and handed over hostages to the Athenians as a guarantee of their good behaviour. However, in Sparta news emerged of the bribes Cleomenes had given at Delphi, and he was expelled from the city. He then sought to rally the northern Peloponnesus to his cause, at which the Spartans relented, and invited him back to the city. By 491 BC though, Cleomenes was widely considered insane and was sentenced to prison where he was found dead the following day. Cleomenes was succeeded by his half-brother Leonidas I.\n\nTaking advantage of the chaos in Sparta, which effectively left Athens isolated, Darius decided to launch an amphibious expedition to finally punish Athens and Eretria. An army was assembled in Susa, and marched into Cilicia, where a fleet had been gathered. Command of the expedition was given to Datis the Mede and Artaphernes, son of the satrap Artaphernes.\n\nAccording to Herodotus, the fleet sent by Darius consisted of 600 triremes. There is no indication in the historical sources of how many transport ships accompanied them, if any. Herodotus claimed that 3,000 transport ships accompanied 1,207 triremes during Xerxes's invasion in 480 BC. Among modern historians, some have accepted this number of ships as reasonable; it has been suggested either that the number 600 represents the combined number of triremes and transport ships, or that there were horse transports in addition to 600 triremes.\n\nHerodotus does not estimate the size of the Persian army, only saying that they formed a \"large infantry that was well packed\". Among other ancient sources, the poet Simonides, a near-contemporary, says the campaign force numbered 200,000, while a later writer, the Roman Cornelius Nepos estimates 200,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry. Plutarch and Pausanias both independently give 300,000, as does the Suda dictionary; Plato and Lysias assert 500,000; and Justin 600,000.\n\nModern historians generally dismiss these numbers as exaggerations. One approach to estimate the number of troops is to calculate the number of marines carried by 600 triremes. Herodotus tells us that each trireme in the second invasion of Greece carried 30 extra marines, in addition to a probable 14 standard marines. Thus, 600 triremes could easily have carried 18,000–26,000 infantry. Numbers proposed for the Persian infantry are in the range 18,000–100,000. However, the consensus is around 25,000.\n\nThe Persian infantry used in the invasion was probably a heterogeneous group drawn from across the empire. However, according to Herodotus, there was at least a general conformity in the type of armour and style of fighting. The troops were, generally speaking, armed with a bow, 'short spear' and sword, carried a wicker shield, and wore at most a leather jerkin. The one exception to this may have been the ethnic Persian troops, who may have worn a corslet of scale armour. Some contingents would have been armed somewhat differently; for instance, the Saka were renowned axemen. The 'elite' contingents of the Persian infantry seem to have been the ethnic Persians, Medians, Cissians and the Saka; Herodotus specifically mentions the presence of Persians and Saka at Marathon. The style of fighting used by the Persians was probably to stand off from an enemy, using their bows (or equivalent) to wear down the enemy before closing in to deliver the \"coup de grace\" with spear and sword.\n\nEstimates for the cavalry are usually in the 1,000–3,000 range. The Persian cavalry was usually provided by the ethnic Persians, Bactrians, Medes, Cissians, and Saka; most of these probably fought as lightly armed missile cavalry. The fleet must have had at least some proportion of transport ships, since the cavalry was carried by ship; whilst Herodotus claims the cavalry was carried in the triremes, this is improbable. Lazenby estimates 30–40 transport ships would be required to carry 1,000 cavalry.\n\nOnce assembled, the Persian force sailed from Cilicia firstly to the island of Rhodes. A Lindian Temple Chronicle records that Datis besieged the city of Lindos, but was unsuccessful.\n\nThe fleet then moved north along the Ionian coast towards Samos, before abruptly turning west into the Aegean Sea. The fleet sailed next to Naxos, in order to punish the Naxians for their resistance to the failed expedition that the Persians had mounted there a decade earlier. Many of the inhabitants fled to the mountains; according to Herodotus, those that the Persians caught were enslaved. The Persians then burnt the city and temples of the Naxians.\n\nMoving on, the Persian fleet approached Delos, whereupon the Delians also fled from their homes. Having demonstrated Persian power at Naxos, Datis now intended to show clemency to the other islands, if they submitted to him. He sent a herald to the Delians, proclaiming: \"Holy men, why have you fled away, and so misjudged my intent? It is my own desire, and the king's command to me, to do no harm to the land where the two gods were born, neither to the land itself nor to its inhabitants. So return now to your homes and dwell on your island.\" Datis then burned 300 talents of frankincense on the altar of Apollo on Delos, to show his respect for one of the gods of the island. The fleet then proceeded to island-hop across the rest of Aegean on its way to Eretria, taking hostages and troops from each island.\n\nThe Persians finally arrived off the southern tip of Euboea, at Karystos. The citizens of Karystos refused to give hostages to the Persians, so they were besieged, and their land ravaged, until they submitted to the Persians.\n\nThe task force then sailed around Euboea to the first major target, Eretria. According to Herodotus, the Eretrians were divided amongst themselves as to the best course of action; whether to flee to the highlands, or undergo a siege, or to submit to the Persians. In the event, the majority decision was to remain in the city. The Eretrians made no attempt to stop the Persians landing, or advancing, and thus allowed themselves to be besieged. For six days the Persians attacked the walls, with losses on both sides; however, on the seventh day two reputable Eretrians opened the gates and betrayed the city to the Persians. The city was razed, and temples and shrines were looted and burned. Furthermore, according to Darius's commands, the Persians enslaved all the remaining townspeople.\n\nThe Persian fleet next headed south down the coast of Attica, landing at the bay of Marathon, roughly from Athens, on the advice of Hippias, son of the former tyrant of Athens, Peisistratus. The Athenians, joined by a small force from Plataea, marched to Marathon, and succeeded in blocking the two exits from the plain of Marathon. At the same time, Athens' greatest runner, Pheidippides (or Philippides) was sent to Sparta to request that the Spartan army march to Athens' aid. Pheidippides arrived during the festival of \"Carneia\", a sacrosanct period of peace, and was informed that the Spartan army could not march to war until the full moon rose; Athens could not expect reinforcement for at least ten days. They decided to hold out at Marathon for the time being, and they were reinforced by a contingent of hoplites from Plataea.\n\nStalemate ensued for five days, before the Athenians (for reasons that are not completely clear) decided to attack the Persians. Despite the numerical advantage of the Persians, the hoplites proved devastatingly effective, routing the Persians wings before turning in on the centre of the Persian line; the remnants of the Persian army left the battle and fled to their ships. Herodotus records that 6,400 Persian bodies were counted on the battlefield; the Athenians lost just 192 men and the Plataeans 11.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the battle, Herodotus says that the Persian fleet sailed around Cape Sunium to attack Athens directly, although some modern historians place this attempt just before the battle. Either way, the Athenians evidently realised that their city was still under threat, and marched as quickly as possible back to Athens. The Athenians arrived in time to prevent the Persians from securing a landing, and seeing that the opportunity was lost, the Persians turned about and returned to Asia. On the next day, the Spartan army arrived, having covered the in only three days. The Spartans toured the battlefield at Marathon, and agreed that the Athenians had won a great victory.\n\nThe defeat at Marathon ended for the time being the Persian invasion of Greece. However, Thrace and the Cycladic islands had been resubjugated into the Persian empire, and Macedon reduced to a subordinate kingdom part of the empire; since the late 6th century BC they had been vassals of the Persians, but remained having a broad scope of autonomy. Darius was still fully intent on conquering Greece, to secure the western part of his empire. Moreover, Athens remained unpunished for its role in the Ionian Revolt, and both Athens and Sparta were unpunished for their treatment of the Persian ambassadors.\n\nDarius therefore began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition. Darius then died whilst preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I. Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece. This expedition was finally ready by 480 BC, and the second Persian invasion of Greece thereby began, under the command of Xerxes himself.\n\nFor the Persians, the two expeditions to Greece had been largely successful; new territories had been added to their empire and Eretria had been punished. It was only a minor setback that the invasion had met defeat at Marathon; that defeat barely dented the enormous resources of the Persian empire. Yet, for the Greeks, it was an enormously significant victory. It was the first time that Greeks had beaten the Persians, and showed them that the Persians were not invincible, and that resistance, rather than subjugation, was possible.\n\nThe victory at Marathon was a defining moment for the young Athenian democracy, showing what might be achieved through unity and self-belief; indeed, the battle effectively marks the start of a 'golden age' for Athens. This was also applicable to Greece as a whole; \"their victory endowed the Greeks with a faith in their destiny that was to endure for three centuries, during which western culture was born\". John Stuart Mill's famous opinion was that \"the Battle of Marathon, even as an event in British history, is more important than the Battle of Hastings\".\n\nMilitarily, a major lesson for the Greeks was the potential of the hoplite phalanx. This style had developed during internecine warfare amongst the Greeks; since each city-state fought in the same way, the advantages and disadvantages of the hoplite phalanx had not been obvious. Marathon was the first time a phalanx faced more lightly armed troops, and revealed how devastating the hoplites could be in battle. The phalanx formation was still vulnerable to cavalry (the cause of much caution by the Greek forces at the Battle of Plataea), but used in the right circumstances, it was now shown to be a potentially devastating weapon. The Persians seem to have more-or-less disregarded the military lessons of Marathon. The composition of infantry for the second invasion seems to have been the same as during the first, despite the availability of hoplites and other heavy infantry in Persian-ruled lands. Having won battles against hoplites previously, the Persians may simply have regarded Marathon as an aberration.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16827297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16827297", "title": "Khamtrul Rinpoche", "text": "Khamtrul Rinpoche\n\nThe Khamtrul tulku lineage is part of the Dongyud Palden section of the Drukpa Lineage of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nThe Fourth Gyalwang Drukpa Kunkhyen Pema Karpo, head of the Drukpa Lineage, was one of the most celebrated masters in the 16th century. One of his most accomplished disciples, Lhatsewa Ngawang Zangpo (the First Yongdzin Rinpoche), had numerous disciples. Among those disciples, nine attained the level of realization where there is no distinction between the states of meditation and non-meditation (Gom-Med). One of these disciples was Ngawang Tenphel who became the 1st Khamtrul Rinpoche. Khamtrul means the reincarnation (tulku) from Kham.\n\nIt is said that the appearance of the Khamtrul lineage was foretold by Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpoche), among other renowned Rinpoches. The Khamtrul Rinpoche is also said to be an authentic emanation of Padmasambhava and an emanation of King Gesar, the hero of the epic tale \"King Gesar\".\n\nThe 1st Khamtrul Rinpoche was born to Yab Khandro Bum and Yum Ri Nyima in Khotsa Rinchengang in Kham. From an early age, he took a liking to wearing the white cotton clothing worn by wandering yogis and would declare that he was a tokden of the Drukpa lineage. This earned him the nickname 'drukpa'. He was sent to Samten Lingpey Densa monastery, where – under the guidance of the master Sonam Gyaltshen – he was taught the preliminary studies and named Sonam Wangchuk.\n\nWhile studying, he learned of a set of teachings taking place in central Tibet. At the teachings he heard of the teacher Lhatsewa Ngawang Zangpo (the 1st Drukpa Yongdzin Rinpoche), and travelled further to receive teachings from him. Upon meeting Lhatsewa Ngawang Zangpo, the young monk recognised him as his guru. He soon received the vows of monkhood from him and was given the name Ngawang Tenphel. It is said that he reached enlightenment very quickly under the instruction of Lhatsewa Ngawang Zangpo.\n\nHe returned to Kham soon afterwards, supposedly in the garb of a yogi (the same sort of plain white clothing he took to wearing years earlier). The people of Kham were reluctant in accepting the Rinpoche, however, and are said to have abused and beat him almost to death. As part of his work he was to have gone into China to further spread his message, but upon seeing a vision of the mountains of China, chose instead to remain in Kham. The various kings of Kham revered him as a spiritual leader, allowing him to mediate between them and help settle their disputes.\n\nHe continued his practice and his teaching until his death, including spending periods of up to three years on meditation retreat. He died at a retreat centre named Mishig Dorji Dzong gyi Drubney.\n\nDuring his lifetime, the 1st Khamtrul Rinpoche spread his teachings widely in Kham, setting up retreat centers, educational institutes, monasteries and nunneries. There were almost two hundred branches of Khampagar Monastery in Kham region alone due to his work.\n\nAs a result of this, the rinpoche gained a great number of followers. The three main disciples of his were Zigar Sonam Gyamtso, the 1st Zigar Rinpoche, Trulshik Trinley Gyatso, the 1st Adeu Rinpoche, and Drugu Choegyal Gyatso, the 1st Choegyal Rinpoche. These three Dharma brothers were known as the three oceans. All three lineages still exist and the current lineage holders, especially Choegyal Rinpoche, continue to have a close relationship with the Khamtrul Rinpoche; the 9th Zigar Rinpoche resides at Rewalsar, India, the 8th Adeu Rinpoche died in July 2007 (his next incarnation is yet to be discovered) and the 8th Drugu Choegyal Rinpoche helps Dorzong Rinpoche with the latter's monastery, known as Jangchub Jong, in Himachal Pradesh, India, and is rebuilding his monastery in Tibet.\n\nNgawang Kunga Tenzin was responsible for the founding of Pal Phuntsok Choekor Ling monastery in Kham, more popularly known as Khampagar monastery, under the patronage of the King of Lhathog. The residence of the 9th Khamtrul Rinpoche Shedrub Nyima in Tashi Jong, Himachal Pradesh, India is likewise known as Khampagar monastery, though its full name is Pal Phuntsok Choekor Ling. Ngawang Kunga Tenzin was well known for his scholarship, having written seventeen volumes of commentaries including explanations regarding the preliminary and actual practice of Mahamudra.\n\nTenzin Chokyi Nyima wrote a commentary on Tibetan poetry, \"Khampai Nyen Ngag Drelchen\", which is said to be highly respected throughout Tibet. Inspired by his teacher, the Third Khamtrul Rinpoche, he founded the Monastery in Chamdo County, Kham, which became the seat of the Khamtrul lineage.\n\nBorn in 1931, the 8th Khamtrul Rinpoche was still quite young when the Battle of Chamdo began in October 1950. He remained in Tibet through the resistance movement in Kham and Amdo in June 1956, but when this was crushed, with serious ramifications for the citizens – including the monks and nuns – he realised he had to leave. In 1958 he left for India with a group of 16 monks and tulkus. The 14th Dalai Lama would leave Tibet soon after following the failure of the 1959 Tibetan uprising.\n\nInitially the 8th Khamtrul Rinpoche and his followers settled in Kalimpong, West Bengal. There, a number of exiles from the area surrounding the original Khampagar monastery became affiliated with them. In 1969 this community moved west to Himachal Pradesh and settled in a village called Jekhli Beth. The village lies about east of Palampur and about west of Baijnath in the Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh. The move brought them just two hours from the Dalai Lama's residence in McLeod Ganj. They were granted of land and named it Tashi Jong, which is Tibetan for \"Auspicious (or Happy) Valley\".\n\nThe area is an historically holy part of Northeast India known as Ngalen gyi Yul.\n\nIt is said that when he visited Tashi Jong, the 8th Khamtrul Rinpoche had a vision of the peaceful and wrathful Manjusri. In the vision, Tashi Jong and its surroundings were formed by a body, speech, mind quality and activity mandala of Manjusri. The rinpoche took this as a sign to settle there and to re-establish the Khampagar monastery.\n\nThe rinpoche rebuilt the Khampagar monastery, with the work being done by the lay community, monks and reincarnated lamas together. The rinpoche himself was a skilled artist and created many of the statues and paintings which can be seen in the monastery today. Tashi Jong has since flourished into a community of 150 monks, both in the monastery and the Khampagar Institute, a school teaching Buddhist philosophy which is connected to the monastery. There is also a lay community of around 400 people and a retreat centre for tokdens that houses about 15 yogis. The recreation of the monastery saw the resurgence of cham, or 'lama-dances', ritual dances by the monks, for which Tashi Jong has gained a high reputation (attracting a number of tourists, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist, each year). Throughout their years in exile, the rinpoche and his followers kept up the observance of their pujas.\n\nThe Khamtrul Rinpoche is also well known as the root guru of Tenzin Palmo, an English nun and only the second Western woman to be ordained as a Tibetan Buddhist śrāmaṇerī and, subsequently, one of the first Tibetan Buddhist women ever to be ordained as a full bhikṣu in 1973. The 8th Khamtrul Rinpoche gave her the Tibetan name Tenzin Palmo (she was originally called Diane Perry) and instructed her to build a nunnery near Tashi Jong. This request resulted in Dongyu Gatsal Ling (DGL) Nunnery, just a couple of kilometres from Tashi Jong. As of April 2008, work continues on the nunnery, but it is still a fully functional centre for the training of Buddhist nuns with 45 nuns there at the moment.\n\nIn later life, the 8th Khamtrul Rinpoche visited Bhutan on a few occasions, giving teachings and initiations. In 1980, at the age of 49, he died due to ill health. According to Tibetan Buddhist tradition, bodhisattvas can have multiple incarnations; the 8th Khamtrul Rinpoche has two recognised reincarnations (with no disputes about the veracity of either).\n\nThe 9th Khamtrul Rinpoche was born in 1980 at Bomdila, Arunachal Pradesh . He was recognised as a reincarnation of the 8th by Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa and by Dilgo Khyentse, who both predicted the same names of the parents. It was said that, in his youth, Shedrub Nyima was often seen in a position of meditation and that he inspired awe in those who saw him. He received training and instruction from various sources, including from Tokden Amtrin, a highly respected yogi at Tashi Jong (who died on 1 July 2005) and from the late Adeu Rinpoche (the first incarnation of whom was a student of the 1st Khamtrul Rinpoche). Shedrub Nyima currently maintains his seat as the head of Khampagar monastery in Tashi Jong, the monastery founded by his predecessor. He is also the spiritual head of Tenzin Palmo's monastery, Dongyu Gatsal Ling..\n\nThe Ninth Khamtrul Rinpoche Jigme Pema Nyinjadh was born in 1981, into the family of the Twelfth Gyalwang Drukpa, supreme head of the Drukpa Lineage. His root teacher is Gyalwang Drukpa with father Karma Dorjee and mother Chimey Yudon. He was recognized by the Dalai Lama, the Gyalwang Drukpa and the First Thuksey Rinpoche.\nHis basic studies were done at Druk Thupten Sangag Choeling Monastery in Darjeeling. There he spent his childhood and teenage years under the guidance of his root teacher, Gyalwang Drukpa. His other main teacher was Omze Sherab, a disciple of Trulshik Pema Chogyel, the enlightened Drukpa yogi who was also the teacher of the Eleventh Gyalwang Drukpa.\nKhamtrul Rinpoche has completed the nine-year course in Buddhist philosophy at Tango University in Bhutan, as advised by the Gyalwang Drukpa. Studying with him were his Dharma friends and heart friends, such as Gyelsey Trulku Rinpoche Mipham Tenzin Wangpo (who was the spiritual representative of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal after he died), the Second Thuksey Rinpoche, other tulkus and over 200 monks. Now Khamtrul Rinpoche is the representative of the Gyalwang Drukpa in all Asian countries and resides mainly in Nepal at Druk Amitabha mountain the seat of Gyalwang Drukpa the Head of Drukpa Lineage\n\n"}

The Catholic Church agrees with Protestants in that public revelation ended with the death of the Apostle John. Private revelation is not binding on Catholics and does not inform any new doctrine. Some Protestant Reformers held different views, and taught that the miraculous gifts (including prophecy) ended with the death of the Apostles or soon thereafter. This doctrine, called cessationism, is still held by conservative Evangelicals (especially some Baptists and Calvinists), who believe that the Bible is the final and complete revelation of God. By contrast, the Charismatic Movement emphasizes the claim that prophecy is available to contemporary believers.\nVisions of Jesus and Mary have been common throughout the history of Christianity. The technical term of receiving revelations verbally, as opposed to in visions, is interior locution. For example, Mother Teresa stated that she had been experiencing interior locutions, but that she preferred to remain private as to their contents. \n\nThere are numerous examples of such instances in Christian mysticism, during the medieval period and in the modern era e.g. Jacob Boehme and Emanuel Swedenborg, and later Jakob Lorber (1800–1864), Gottfried Mayerhofer (1807–1877), Bertha Dudde (1891–1965) and others. Proponents of neo-revelationism point to John 16:12–14, taking \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\" as an announcement of continued revelation outside of the biblical canon. 12th-century mystic Joachim of Fiore also pointed to Revelations 14:6 which presages an \"everlasting gospel\" yet to be taught in the future. Opponents, on the other hand, tend to point to the warning against false prophets in Matthew 24.\n\nOutside mainstream Christianity, there have also been numerous new religious movements led by people either claiming to be directly inspired by Jesus, or indeed to be Jesus returned.\n\nOther examples of notable neo-revelationist movements are the Unification Church, Universal Life, Church of the Last Testament and Fiat Lux. A number of movements of Spiritual Christianity in tsarist Russia also fall under this category.\n\n\n\n"}

She is the Curtis and Kathleen Marble Professor of Astrophysics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where she is also the Associate Head of the Department of Physics. She was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 2010. Mavalvala is best known for her work on the detection of gravitational waves in the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) project, but she has also obtained prominent results on other physics problems that evolved out of LIGO: for example, she has performed pioneering experiments on laser cooling of macroscopic objects and in the generation of squeezed quantum states of light.\n\nMavalvala was born in Lahore but primarily raised in Karachi, Pakistan. She attended the Convent of Jesus and Mary, Karachi, where she received her O-Level and A-Level qualifications. She moved to the United States in 1986 and enrolled at Wellesley College, where she received a bachelor's degree in physics and astronomy in 1990. Before she graduated in 1990, Mavalvala and her physics professor, Robert Berg, co-authored a paper in \"Physical Review B: Condensed Matter\". She also helped set up his lab. She went on to do her PhD in physics from MIT in 1997.\n\nBorn to a Parsi family, Mavalvala was the younger of the two children. Mavalvala's parents highly valued their daughters' educational experiences, and encouraged Mavalvala to pursue higher education overseas. Mavalvala was always interested in math and science as a child, and believed that she was intrinsically good at it, in contrast to the humanities. Mavalvala was raised in the Zoroastrian faith. A lesbian, Mavalvala and her partner have two children and reside in Cambridge, Massachusetts in the United States. Mavalvala has extended family in Karachi and visited the city in 2010.\n\nBeing openly queer and Pakistani, Mavalvala gets a lot of questions based on her identity and roots. Mavalvala was not aware of her sexual preference until after college. She stands out as an immigrant of Pakistan who describes herself as \"out, queer person of color.\" Mavalvala is frequently questioned about gender roles and how she was able to break through the barrier and was able to pursue the career of her choice. In an interview with the Pakistani newspaper \"Dawn\" Mavalvala states, \"I grew up in a family where the stereotypical gender roles were not really observed.\" She also speaks about the ability of individuals in Pakistan to break these gender roles and stigmas: \"Anybody should be able to do those things. And I am proof of that because I am all of those things. With the right combination of opportunity, it was possible for me to do.\" \n\nMavalvala is often viewed as a role model for aspiring female scientists of South Asian descent. As a young child Mavalvala was always involved in handy work, and was not bound to stereotypical gender roles in South Asian culture, due to the way her sister and she were raised. Mavalvala states that a lot of her success is accredited to good mentors in both the USA and Pakistan that encouraged her academic ability. In a television interview in 2016, Mavalvala stated that, \"When everyone has access to education that's when all the other things come into place... [You've] got to do what gives you pleasure, gotta find a way to do it. People should just do what they enjoy most and i think for all of society whether it's in Pakistan or elsewhere we have to create opportunities for young girls to do what they're good at and do what they love to do must cultivate the sense of wonder in a child\" \n\nAs a graduate student at MIT, she conducted her doctoral work under Dr. Rainer Weiss, where Mavalvala developed a prototype laser interferometer for detecting gravitational waves. After graduate school, she was a postdoctoral researcher and then a research scientist at the California Institute of Technology, starting her work with cosmic microwave background, and then eventually working on the LIGO. Mavalvala mainly focuses on two fields of physics: Gravitational Waves Astrophysics and quantum measurement science. Dr. Mavalvala joined the MIT physics faculty in 2002. In 2017 she was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nMavalvala was among the team of scientists who, for the first time, observed ripples in the fabric of spacetime called gravitational waves. Mavalvala has been working on gravitational waves since 1991. It was announced to the public on 11 February 2016. The detection confirmed a major prediction of Albert Einstein's 1915 general theory of relativity.\n\nAfter the announcement of the observation, she became an instant celebrity scientist in her birthplace of Pakistan. Talking to the press she claimed that \"we are really witnessing the opening of a new tool for doing astronomy.\"\n\nDuring an interview with Pakistani newspaper Dawn, after the detection of gravitational waves, she claimed that she was baffled by public interest in her research in Pakistan. She said \"I really thought of what I want people to know in Pakistan as I have garnered some attention there. Anybody should be able to succeed — whether you're a woman, a religious minority or whether you're gay. It just doesn't matter.\" In a statement by the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, the Prime Minister praised Mavalvala, calling her a source of inspiration for Pakistani scientists and students aspiring to become future scientists. He also stated that \"the entire nation is proud of her valuable contribution.\"\n\nOn 20 February 2016, Ambassador of Pakistan to the United States, Jalil Abbas Jilani, conveyed the Government of Pakistan's message of felicitation to Mavalvala for her outstanding achievement in the field of astrophysics. He also invited her to re-visit Pakistan, which she accepted.\n\nOptical cooling of mirrors to nearly absolute zero can help eliminate measurement noise arising from thermal vibrations. Part of Mavalvala's work focused on the extension of laser-cooling techniques to optically cool and trap more and more massive objects, both for the LIGO project and for other applications, such as to enable observation of quantum phenomena in macroscopic objects. Prominent results from her group in this area included cooling of a centimeter-scale object to a temperature of 0.8 kelvins and observation of a 2.7-kilogram pendulum near its quantum ground state. These experiments lay the foundations for observing quantum behavior in human-scale objects.\n\nMavalvala has also worked on the development of exotic quantum states of light, and in particular the generation of light in squeezed coherent states. By injecting such states into the kilometer-scale Michelson interferometer of the LIGO detectors, her group greatly improved the sensitivity of the detector by reducing quantum noise; such squeezed states also have many other applications in experimental physics.\n\nMavalvala won the first Lahore Technology Award launched by Information Technology University on December 17, 2017.\n\nIn 2017, the Carnegie Corporation of New York honored Mavalvala as one of its Great Immigrants awards recipients. The awards go to \"naturalized citizens who have made notable contributions to the progress of American society.\"\n\n"}

Allogan Slagle, an historian of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians, argues that the \"Original Keetoowah Society\" is the surviving core of the Cherokee religious movement originally led by Redbird Smith in the nineteenth century, whose aim was to preserve the culture and teachings of the Keetoowah in Oklahoma after the Indian removal of the tribes from the American Southeast. Slagle's argument that the group now known as \"The Original Keetoowah Society\" evolved from the early 20th century group known as the Keetoowah Nighthawk Society (or the Nighthawk Keetoowahs) appears in a lengthy treatise, \"Burning Phoenix\" (1993).\n\nIn the introduction to his 1993 work, \"Burning Phoenix: A Study of the Federal Acknowledgment, Reorganization and Survival of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians in Oklahoma\", Allogan Slagle writes that, \"In November 1899, the [original] Keetoowah Society convened in Tahlequah to pass resolutions critical of the Cherokee Council and the Dawes Commission particularly with regard to plans to dispose of Cherokee land and to create a roll without the consent of the Cherokee Nation.\" Slagle further writes,\nSlagle references two court cases, \"Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas R. R.\" (1890) and \"Cherokee Nation v. Journeycake\" (1890).\n\nSlagle argued that \"John Smith, the most influential Nighthawk leader among Redbird Smith's sons, had lost virtually all credibility among Keetoowahs by the 1930s\" for having supported Chester Polk Cornelius, an Oneida who had \"engaged them in speculative schemes\", leading to splintering of the religious group into multiple factions. This resulted in two different and opposing ceremonial grounds (both run by members of Redbird Smith's own family - at Redbird's and Stokes Smith's grounds), as wall as the Goingsnake \"Seven Clans\"fire, the Medicine Springs Fire or Medicine Society, and the Four Mothers Nation.\n\nOther political factions arose among the Keetoowah. During the 1930s, the majority of Keetoowah factions supported the idea of reorganizing all the Keetoowah Cherokees in all the old clan districts as a united Band under the proposed 1934 Indian Reorganization Act. The Cherokees by Blood, representing all Cherokee descendants rather than Keetoowah alone, failed in 1932 to obtain standing as a party to the Cherokee claims litigation.\n\nJames Mooney, in an extract of a report for the Bureau of American Ethnology, notes some background on the names by which the Cherokee peoples knew themselves, and were known by others, which included \n\"Ani'-Kitu'hwagi\", meaning \"people of Kitu'hwa [Keetoowa]\":\n\nCourt clerk and reporter John Springston, a Keetoowah Society member from the Saline District before Oklahoma statehood, writing in 1928, also alludes to the use of the Keetooway name prior the Indian removal from the southeast, saying \"Back in Georgia from whence the Cherokees originally migrated to the Indian Territory in 1838 and 1839, the old Keetoowah group... was dying out as early as 1835.\" \n\n\n"}

The movement was severely crippled during the Philippine Revolution after the Philippine Constabulary took over patrols in Samar, when the U.S. military declared the island as \"pacified\".\n\nPulahanes practiced a syncretic religious revival centered mostly on Philippine mythology and Folk Catholicism.

Although RTC controls their use, those works are owned by another corporation, the Church of Spiritual Technology which is doing business as L. Ron Hubbard Library, registered in Los Angeles County, California.\n\nWhile exercising authority over the use of all Dianetics and Scientology materials, RTC claims that it is not involved in the day-to-day management of the Church of Scientology; that role is assigned to a separate corporation, the Church of Scientology International (CSI).\nAccording to the RTC website, \"RTC stands apart as an external body which protects the Scientology religion and acts as the final arbiter of orthodoxy\" and its stated purpose is \"to protect the public from misapplication of the technology and to see that the religious technologies of Dianetics and Scientology remain in proper hands and are properly ministered.\"\n\nSince 1986, David Miscavige has served as the organization's Chairman of the Board.\n\nIn a 1993 memorandum by the Church of Scientology International, the following information was provided to the Internal Revenue Service with regards to RTC's role and functions, its personnel and its income:\n\n\"[...] RTC [...] owns the Scientology religious marks and advanced technology. It licenses the marks to CSI for sublicense to subordinate churches and directly licenses the advanced technology to appropriate churches. Through this structure RTC assures that practice of the Scientology religion within the ecclesiastical hierarchy under CSI's authority as Mother Church remains strictly orthodox, in accordance with the Scientology Scriptures. This church has a staff of approximately 50 individuals and an annual budget of approximately $ 6.6 million, based on its annual disbursements for the most recent year for which financial statements are available. [...]\"\n\nThe RTC guarantees the “purity and workability of Scientology so far into the future,” thus engaging in programs to “restore, preserve, maintain and keep uncorrupted” the church’s \"religious technology,\" according to Scientology spokesman Eric Roux.\n\nRTC was incorporated on January 1, 1982 in Los Angeles, California by Terri Gamboa, David Mayo, Norman Starkey, Phoebe Mauerer, Lyman Spurlock, Julia Watson, and David Miscavige. Six months later, on June 15, 1982, the Articles of Incorporation were restated. On April 8, 1986 they were amended in order to clarify the disposition of RTC's assets upon the dissolution of the corporation.\n\nAt present the official address of RTC is 1710 Ivar Avenue, Suite 1100, Los Angeles 90028, in the Hollywood Guaranty Building, while its main offices are on a big estate complex at 19625 Highway 79, Gilman Hot Springs 92383, California, as it was stated in a supporting document of Scientology's tax-exempt application to the IRS during the years 1992/1993.\n\nOn September 21, 1993 the following individuals held corporate positions at RTC: The Board of Trustees was composed of David Miscavige, Gregory Wilhere, and Norman F. Starkey. The members of RTC's Board of Directors were at that time Mark Rathbun, Warren McShane, and David Miscavige. RTC's President was Mark Rathbun, its Secretary Warren McShane, and its Treasurer Barbara Griffin.\n\nAs of February 5, 2001 RTC's corporate officers were Warren McShane (Chief Executive Officer/President), Laurisse Stuckenbrock (Secretary), and Barbara Griffin (Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer).\n\nAs of March 14, 2008, RTC's official agent has been the attorney Sherman D. Lenske from the law firm Lenske, Lenske & Abramson ALC, Warner Atrium, 6400 Canoga Avenue, Suite 315, Woodland Hills 91367-2491.\n\nOn August 19, 1993, RTC filed an application for tax exemption under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. In the same year the Internal Revenue Service granted RTC's request for exemption.\n\nThe granting of tax exemption to RTC and other Scientology corporations was preceded by years of continuous litigation between the IRS and the various entities of Scientology. According to former high-ranking executives, the Scientology organization had launched about 200 lawsuits against the IRS until 1991. During the same time, individual parishioners of Scientology had initiated 2,300 claims against the agency, challenging the denial of tax deduction for their services at Scientology organizations. Late 1991, the dispute over Scientology's tax-exempt status began to resolve through high-level meetings between David Miscavige and the then Commissioner of the IRS, Fred Goldberg, who encouraged a final resolution of the legal battle.\n\nMain Corporate Activities\n\nThe Religious Technology Center (RTC) is the owner of certain trademarks and service marks. These marks and its related intellectual property form the \"Dianetics spiritual healing technology\" and the \"Scientology applied religious technology\".\n\nScientology organizations, like \"Churches,\" \"Celebrity Centres\" or \"Missions,\" derive their income from the worldwide sales of this \"technology\" in form of courses, books, etc. to their members or to the general public. The organizations receive the right to sell the \"technology\" through license agreements with RTC as license holder and/or the Church of Scientology International (CSI) as a sub-licensor. RTC and CSI in return derive their corporative income through the license fees, which in turn are obtained through those agreements. The licensing and its related actions are major corporate activities of the various Scientology-organizations.\n\nLicensing of Trademarks & Service Marks\n\n\nShortly after its inception on January 1, 1982, RTC received on May 16, 1982 \"the ownership, supervision and control\" of the trademarks and service marks identifying \"Scientology applied religious philosophy\" and \"Dianetics spiritual healing technology\" by the originator and founder of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard through an \"Assignment Agreement\".\n\nThis agreement was subject to an additional \"Option Agreement\" between Hubbard, RTC and another Scientology corporation, the \"Church of Spiritual Technology\" (CST). In two \"Option Agreements\" from May 1982, Hubbard granted CST the right to purchase at any time from RTC the \"Marks\", the \"Advanced Technology\" and all the rights to them for the sum of $100.\n\nParallel and similar-sounding agreements between Hubbard, RTC and CST were created during that period concerning the \"Advanced Technology,\" which consists of unpublished derivates of Scientology's confidential \"Advanced technology\".\n\nUnder these agreements RTC is to turn over 90% of its net income to CST. A document from 1991, reflecting the \"financial money flows\" of RTC during the year 1989, showed a turnover of 59% of RTC's net income towards CST.\n\n\nRTC and CSI entered a license agreement on May 18, 1982, granting CSI, the new \"Mother Church of Scientology,\" the right to use and sub-license certain of the trademarks and service marks. In return for the grant of the marks, the agreement gave RTC practically an unlimited corporate control not only over the activities of CSI but also over every organization that is a sub-licensee of CSI.\n\nIn particular the agreement stated:\n\n\"[...] d) RTC shall have the right to monitor all operations of CSI and its related organizations, inspect all books, records and facilities, pertaining to use of the Marks and receive sample specimens and summaries of literature, publications and products using the marks, [...] e) RTC may, if it ever deems it necessary or advisable, send a corrective mission to any organization authorized the Marks to correct any deviation from the standards, specifications or guidelines of this Agreement, [... ]\"\n\nAdditionally RTC and CSI signed on January 1, 1982 an \"Organizational Covenant\" granting CSI the right to deliver the \"Advanced Technology\" to its staff members.\n\n\nRTC and CoSWUS entered on May 23, 1985 an organizational covenant granting CoSWUS the right to sell and deliver the \"Advanced Technology\" to its public members while guaranteeing weekly payments of 6% of the monetary value of the \"Advanced Technology\"-services that are being delivered to the public from CoSWUS towards RTC.\n\n\nOn January 1, 1982 RTC and FSO signed an organizational covenant with similar content to the covenant between RTC and CoSWUS.\n\n\nRTC has entered over the years similar organizational covenants/license agreements with all the other \"Advanced Organizations\" (AOs) within the Scientology network. As all the AO's are integrated within a corporation, these agreements are formulated between RTC and these corporations, such as \"Church of Scientology Flag Ship Service Organization, Inc.\" from Netherlands Antilles, the \"Church of Scientology Religious Education College, Inc.\" from East Grinstead, England, the \"Church of Scientology, Inc.\" from Sydney, Australia and with \"Church of Scientology Advanced Organization Saint Hill Europe & Africa\" (AOSH EU).\n\nRTC has registered its service marks and trademarks in various countries all over the world. Due to certain legal restrictions for religious corporations in certain countries, RTC founded the corporation \"Inspector General Network, Inc.\" (IGN) on June 7, 1985, which functions as a \"secular\" representative for RTC in those countries. In 1985 RTC entered with IGN a so-called \"Reversion and Reservation Agreement\", which regulated the rights and obligations with regards to the Scientology and Dianetics trademarks of the \"secular\" organizations IGN and \"World Institute of Scientology Enterprises, Inc.\" (WISE Inc.), a dormant Delaware corporation.\n\nControl of Other Corporations\n\nAt the time of RTC's filing for tax exemption, RTC controlled four other corporations:\n\n\nIGN has served as legal representative for RTC and secular registered owner of RTC's trade and service marks \"in countries where contracts by religious corporations are not enforced\". All corporate positions of IGN were held by members of RTC.\n\n\nAt the time of Scientology's application for tax exemption, WISE, Inc. has been a dormant corporation from Delaware. It had the same functions as IGN, prior to IGN's incorporation in 1985.\n\n\nRTC Australia was incorporated in 1986 as a regional office for RTC in Australia. It is a dormant corporation and has obtained tax exempt status.\n\n\nIGN was incorporated in 1992 in Sweden. The organization was founded to register Scientology's trade and service marks as a nominee for RTC in countries, such as Libya or Iran \"that do not recognize and will not do business with any United States entity\".\n\nRTC stands hierarchically at the top of the Church of Scientology network. It has regulatory, corporate and ecclesiastical power over the policy and activities of all other Scientology management units, corporations, churches, missions and other organizations - with the only exception being the Church of Spiritual Technology. The position of RTC is notably visible in a drawing titled \"The Command Channels of Scientology\", which the Church of Scientology International (CSI) and RTC provided to the IRS in their application for tax-exempt status. It should be noted that the Church of Spiritual Technology has not been included in this application.\n\nIn its application for tax exemption, RTC described the internal structure of the organization as follows:\n\n\"[...] RTC's daily activities are carried out by a staff of 54 highly-trained individuals who function in their positions within the overall ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Scientology religion. Through receipt of reports and direct inspections, RTC ensures that those utilizing the marks are ministering orthodox Scientology religious services. [...]\"\n\n\"[...] The senior ecclesiastical position in RTC is held by David Miscavige, who continues to serve as Chairman of the Board RTC and also as Inspector General. There are also several Deputy Inspector Generals who assist in the performance of RTC's\nreligious functions. There is a Deputy Inspector General who functions as Chairman of the Board RTC's second in command and\nsees to the day to day functioning of the organization. There is a Deputy Inspector General who oversees internal matters in RTC\nand another who is in charge of RTC's religious programs.\"\n\n\"The religious mission of RTC, protecting the orthodoxy of the technologies of Dianetics and Scientology, is carried out by two ecclesiastical divisions within RTC as described below. There is now one Inspectorate division which consists of four departments. The Department of Data receives reports and collects information from other organizations and Scientologists and collates, analyzes and distributes the information to all other departments that require it.\n\n\"The Department of Trademark Registration, Maintenance and Enforcement gets the religious marks of Dianetics and Scientology legally registered and sees to it that all users of the marks are properly licensed. It also investigates and, where necessary, prosecutes legal infringements of the marks.\"\n\n\"The Department of Technical Policing inspects application of the Scientology Scriptures pertaining to the ministry of religious services by licensees and corrects misapplication where it is found.\"\n\n\"The Department of Organization Policing inspects the application of Scientology Scriptures as it pertains to governance of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and corrects misapplication where it is found.\"\n\n\"Authorization, Verification and Correction International ('AVC INT') is a division within RTC which is responsible for authorizing and verifying that the ecclesiastical programs, evaluations, strategies, promotional materials and issues as authored by CSI are in accordance with Scripture. [...]\"\n\nAs previously mentioned, RTC is currently led by the \"Chairman of the Board (of Directors)\" David Miscavige, who has held this position since 1987. Miscavige has been in leading positions within the Scientology management since the early 1980s. Prior to being in his current position, Miscavige had been a member of the Commodore's Messenger Organization and had been instrumental in the internal purge of the Guardian's Office, the former intelligence service and legal defense unit of the Scientology network. In 1982 he became the Chief Executive Officer and later the Chairman of the Board of the for-profit corporation Author Services Inc. (ASI). Miscavige stayed on this position until 1987.\n\nAbout the role and the position of the RTC within the structure of the Scientology network, David Miscavige declared in 1994:\n\n\"[...] Since March of 1987, I have been Chairman of the Board of Religious Technology Center [...]. RTC is not part of Church management, nor is it involved in the daily affairs of various Church of Scientology organizations or missions. RTC ensures that the trademarks of Dianetics and Scientology, and the technology they represent, are properly used around the world.\n\n[...] 8 . RTC was formed with the specific purpose of seeing that the religion of Scientology was kept pure and true to the source materials of the religion. In fact, a major reason for its formation was to have such a Church organization that performed these functions in a capacity entirely separate from the actual management of the various Churches and Missions of Scientology. Not only is RTC not involved in the management of the international hierarchy of Scientology churches, but its very existence and performance of its true functions depends on the fact that it is not part of Church management. The authority of the Religious Technology Center stems from the ownership of the trademarks of Dianetics and Scientology.\n\n[...] 11. Neither RTC nor I has any corporate authority over any Scientology church, including CSI. CSI is the Mother Church of the Scientology religion and has been since its inception in 1981. As such, CSI is responsible for the activities commensurate with such a role, including the ecclesiastical management of Churches, dissemination and propagation of the faith and defense of its activities, including external and legal affairs. [...]\"\n\nSuch representations stand in stark contrast to declarations of high-level ex-scientologists, who have worked in the Scientology management. Former CSI security officer Andre Tabayoyon and former RTC second-in-command Jesse Prince have stated in affidavits and declarations that RTC and its chairman David Miscavige maintain de facto control of the entire Scientology network, including the Church of Scientology International.\n\nWithin that context, André Tabayoyon stated in a 1994 declaration the following about Miscavige's exertion of power as Chairman of the Board and ultimate head of the global Scientology network:\n\n\"[...] 59. I have personal knowledge that Miscavige issues oral and written orders and instructions to Scientologists irrespective of either ecclesiastical lines of authority or corporate lines of is authority or demarcation. Miscavige uses this omnipotent authority to exercise personal control over any and all Scientology organizations whenever he elects to do so. I observed that in running the various Scientology organizations, Miscavige constantly crosses all corporate and ecclesiastical command lines without regard to the fact that there are numerous Scientology related corporations of which he is neither an employee, officer nor director. He does not have to be to control any Scientology organization. He is above all Scientology organizations as the ecclesiastical head of Scientology, COB RTC and Commander of the Sea Org. In this capacity, Miscavige acts as the managing agent of each Scientology organization.\"\n\n\"[...] 61. I personally observed Miscavige take over this position of ultimate power over all of Scientology after Hubbard died. I observed Miscavige when he was COB RTC ordering into Golden Era Studios (\"Gold\"), a CSI division, and ordering into the Commodore's Messenger Organization International (\"CMO Int\"), another CSI division planetary dissemination organization, etc. Both of these Sea Org units are corporately part of CSI. RTC, CMO Int and Gold are all located at a large compound outside of Hemet, California. It is called Gold. As I learned, the Scientology corporate structure was only for the benefit of the outside \"wog\" world. It didn't have any bearing on how Scientology operated.\"\n\n\"62. When Hubbard was alive it was common knowledge and I also observed it personally that he was in direct control, via Miscavige and Pat Broeker, of CMO Int and Gold, and the rest of Scientology. After Hubbard died[,] Miscavige ousted Pat Broeker and Vicki Aznaran, who were then in control of Scientology. After that, it was my experience that Miscavige had complete control over Scientology just as Hubbard had when he was alive. Miscavige took over Hubbard's place as managing agent of all Scientology organizations. [...]\"\n\nMark (\"Marty\") Rathbun, David Miscavige and Warren McShane, Deputy Inspector General for Legal Affairs formed for several years the above-mentioned \"Board of Directors RTC\". As of March 2008, all references to both Rathbun and McShane have disappeared from the RTC website, and their names or pictures have also been removed from other official Scientology websites. Though Miscavige is still listed as Chairman of the Board, no other board members are acknowledged.\n\nWithin the executive branch of RTC existed at least until 2001 the position of \"Inspector General RTC,\" which had been held by Mark Rathbun. This network spanned from RTC headquarters in Gilman Hot Springs to all of the \"Advanced Organizations\" in Los Angeles, Clearwater, East Grinstead, Copenhagen and Sidney, where RTC has maintained offices.\n\nIn an internal newsletter, \"Keeping Scientology Working,\" RTC stated the following about the purpose and duties of the \"Inspector General Network\":\n\n\"These Deputy Inspector Generals head the entire IG Network, which locates and handles internal and external infiltration and suppression, legally protects and safeguards the trademarks and technology of the religion of Scientology, and sees that management, orgs and missions and their application of tech and policy remain standard and true to LRH's writings.\"\n\nWhile RTC has a dominant role over the \"mother church,\" CSI and its subordinate organizations, the relationship to the Church of Spiritual Technology (CST) is unclear. While the above-mentioned \"assignment agreement\" with L. Ron Hubbard on May 10, 1982 granted CST corporative authority over RTC with respect to Scientology's trademarks and service marks, there is no sign that CST ever executed any internal, \"ecclesiastical\" authority over RTC. In fact, the U.S. Claims Court noted in its opinion in a tax case, which involved CST in 1992:\n\n\"CST claims that it does not and will not monitor RTC's use of the religious marks and technology. CST explains that there is no need to do so because any unorthodox use would be immediately obvious. Regardless of how it arrived at the conclusion, however, the point is that one of its obligations is to prevent misuse of the marks and technology. CST's present confidence in RTC has no significance. If CST ignored that element of its charter, one of the assumptions built into LRH's gift would be missing. Monitoring for a misuse by RTC is a form of ongoing oversight. The decision to exercise the option is an ecclesiastical one which would not be readily susceptible to judicial review.\"\n\nSince its inception in 1982, RTC has been involved in various lawsuits in both state and federal courts. The majority of the cases initiated by RTC contend unauthorized use of Scientology's copyrights, service marks, or trademarks. Critics of Scientology contend that a great number of these lawsuits have been launched in order \"to silence critics.\" The courts have agreed in some cases; in \"RTC v. Lerma\" Judge Leonie Brinkema found that the RTC's lawsuit was intended to pursue the \"broader motivation\" of \"the stifling of criticism and dissent of the religious practices of Scientology and the destruction of its opponents.\"\n\nThe RTC filed a lawsuit on January 1, 1985 in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against Robin Scott and the Church of New Civilization (not to be confused with the New Civilization Church), a Scientology splinter group, alleging theft and unauthorized use of confidential material owned by RTC. The case took over a decade to resolve, and was dismissed on April 11, 1996 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In its final opinion the court summarized the history of the case and commented on the conduct of RTC while the case was litigated:\n\n\"[...] In January 1985 RTC sued Mayo and other persons connected with the Church of the New Civilization, a splinter group of the official Church of Scientology, contending that they were making unauthorized use of stolen documents relating to the religion of Scientology. RTC stated that it was \"the protector\" of the religion of Scientology, its philosophy and its technology \"including the Advanced Technology\" consisting of \"confidential and proprietary information regarding counseling and training,\" and was the owner of various trademarks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office protecting the Advanced Technology. [...]\"\n\n\"[...] After 1,825 docket entries and nine years of pretrial litigation involving three discovery magistrates, a special master, the recusal of two district court judges, the denial of five petitions for writ of mandamus, three appeals [...] and three denials of certiorari by the Supreme Court, the third district judge [...] entered Final Judgment.\"\n\n\"[...] [T]here is little doubt that RTC is playing \"fast and loose\" with the judicial system as required in the minority view of estoppel. To first assert that its unfair competition and false designation of origin claims are justiciable and at the same time assert that Mayo's identical claims are not is at best questionable; in light of RTC's documented history of vexatious behavior, RTC's actions are indefensible. [...]\"\n\nThe RTC maintains a task force called the Inspector General Network, an investigatory body which operates from seven offices on four different continents. The IGN's stated function is to \"keep Scientology working by ensuring the pure and ethical use of Dianetics and Scientology technology.\"\n\nRTC, like the Church of Scientology, encourages the use of \"Knowledge Reports\" (KR) from anyone inside or outside of the Church, to report on potential misuse of the Standard Tech and copyrighted/trademarked materials. They maintain an online form in which anyone is encouraged to report any such matters that may be of concern. The use of reports is one system used by RTC to police the use of Scientology materials and the application.\n\n\nScientology sources\n\nCritical sources\n\nMagazine Articles\n\nDiverse Sources\n"}

{"id": "1699957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1699957", "title": "Salman the Persian", "text": "Salman the Persian\n\nSalman the Persian or Salman al-Farsi ( Salmān al-Fārisī), born Rouzbeh (), was a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the first Persian who converted to Islam. During some of his later meetings with the other Sahabah, he was referred to as Abu Abdullah (\"Father of Abdullah\"). He is credited with the suggestion of digging a trench around Medina when it was attacked by Mecca in the Battle of the Trench. He was raised as a Zoroastrian, then attracted to Christianity, and then converted to Islam after meeting Muhammad in the city of Yathrib, which later became Medina. According to some traditions, he was appointed as the governor of Al-Mada'in in Iraq. According to popular tradition, Muhammad considered Salman as part of his household (\"Ahl al-Bayt\"). He was a renowned follower of Ali ibn Abi Talib after the death of Muhammad.\n\nSalman was a Persian born either in the city of Kazerun in Fars Province, or Isfahan in Isfahan Province, Persia. In a hadith, Salman also traced his ancestry to Ramhormoz. the first sixteen years of his life were all about studying to become a Zoroastrian \"magus\" or priest after which he became the guardian of a fire temple, which was a well-respected job. Three years later in 587 he met a Nestorian Christian group and was so impressed by them. Against the wishes of his father, he left his family to join them. His family imprisoned him afterwards to prevent him but he escaped.\n\nHe traveled around the Middle East to discuss his ideas with priests, theologians and scholars in his quest for the truth. During his stay in Syria, he heard of Muhammad, whose coming has been predicted by Salman's last Christian teacher on his deathbed. Afterwards and during his journey to the Arabian Peninsula, he was betrayed and sold to a Jew in Medina. After meeting Muhammad, he recognized the signs that the monk had described to him. He converted to Islam and secured his freedom with the help of Muhammad.\nAbu Hurairah said to have referred to Salman as \"Abu Al Kitabayn\" (The father of the two books, i.e., the Bible and the Quran) and Ali is said to have referred to him as Luqman al-Hakeem (Luqman the wise - reference to a wise man in the Quran known for his wise statements)\n\nIt was Salman who came up with the idea of digging a great trench around the city of Medina to defend the city against the army of 10,000 Arabian non-Muslims. Muhammad and his companions accepted Salman's plan because it was safer and there would be a better chance that the non-Muslim army would have a larger number of casualties.\n\nSalman participated in the conquest of the Sasanian Empire and became the first governor of Sasanid capital after its fall at the time of the second Rashidun Caliph. According to some other sources, however, he disappeared from public life after Muhammad's death; until 656 when Ali became Caliph, and appointed Salman as the governor of Al-Mada'in at the age of 88.\n\nWhile some sources gather Salman with the \"Muhajirun\", other sources narrate that during the Battle of the Trench, one of Muhajirun stated \"Salman is one of us, Muhajirun\", but this was challenged by the Muslims of Medina (also known as the \"Ansar\"). A lively argument began between the two groups with each of them claiming Salman belonged to their group and not to the other one. Muhammad arrived on the scene and heard the argument. He was amused by the claims but soon put an end to the argument by saying: \"Salaman is neither Muhajir nor Ansar. He is one of us. He is one of the People of the House.\"\n\nHe translated the Quran into Persian, thus becoming the first person to interpret and translate the Quran into a foreign language.\n\nWhen exactly Salman died is unknown, however it was probably during Uthman ibn Affan's reign or the second year of Ali's reign. One source states that he died in 32 AH/652 or 653 AD in the Julian calendar, while another source says he died during Uthman's era in 35 AH/655 or 656 AD. Other sources state that he died during Ali's reign.\nHis tomb is located in Al-Mada'in, or according to some others in Isfahan, Jerusalem and elsewhere.\n\nShias, Twelvers in particular, hold Salman in high esteem for a hadith attributed to him, in which all twelve Imāms were mentioned to him by name, from Muhammad.\n\nAli Asgher Razwy, a 20th-century Shia Twelver Islamic scholar states:\nSalman is also well known as prominent figure in Sufi traditions. Sufi orders such as Qadriyya and Baktashiyya and Naqshbandi have Salman in their Isnad of their brotherhood. In the Oveyssi-Shahmaghsoudi order and Naqshbandi order, Salman is the third person in the chain connecting devotees with Muhammad.\nHe also founded Futuwwa along with Ali ibn abi Talib.\n\nIn the Kitáb-i-Íqán, Bahá'u'lláh honours Salman for having been told about the coming of the prophet Muhammad:\n\nAs to the signs of the invisible heaven, there appeared four men who successively announced unto the people the joyful tidings of the rise of that divine Luminary. Rúz-bih, later named Salmán, was honoured by being in their service. As the end of one of these approached, he would send Rúz-bih unto the other, until the fourth who, feeling his death to be nigh, addressed Rúz-bih saying: 'O Rúz-bih! when thou hast taken up my body and buried it, go to Hijáz for there the Day-star of Muhammad will arise. Happy art thou, for thou shalt behold His face!'\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2394891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2394891", "title": "San Bartolo (Maya site)", "text": "San Bartolo (Maya site)\n\nSan Bartolo is a small pre-Columbian Maya archaeological site located in the Department of Petén in northern Guatemala, northeast of Tikal and roughly fifty miles from the nearest settlement. San Bartolo's fame derives from its splendid Late-Preclassic mural paintings still heavily influenced by Olmec tradition and from examples of early and as yet undecipherable Maya script.\n\nThe Maya site includes an 85-foot pyramid named \"Las Ventanas\" (The Windows); the Temple of \"Las Pinturas\" (The Paintings); an early royal tomb in the \"Tigrillo Complex\" (Ocelot Complex); and (in the \"Jabalí\" [Wild Boar] group some 500 mt. to the east from the central Plaza) a triadic complex similar to the H group in Uaxactún and Tikal's North Acropolis. The pyramid was constructed from ca 300 BC (base rooms) and was completed ca 50 AD.\n\nIn 2001, in the base of a pyramid, a team led by William Saturno (a researcher for the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology) discovered a room with murals that were carbon-dated as from 100 BC, making them the oldest ones to date. Excavation started in March 2003. The murals were stabilized and a special technique was used for photographically recording the paintings. Fallen fragments were pieced together and also photographed. Detailed reconstruction drawings were made by Heather Hurst. The iconography of the mural scenes was subsequently analyzed and interpreted by project iconographer Karl Taube. Besides the murals, the oldest known Maya royal tomb was discovered in San Bartolo, by archaeologist Monica Pellecer Alecio.\n\nAs Saturno, Stuart and Taube have argued, the murals on the northern and western walls of the chamber in the base of the temple pyramid ('Pinturas Sub-1') depict elements of Maya creation mythology reminiscent of the Popol Vuh as well as of Yucatec cosmological traditions.\n\nThe north wall mural consists of two scenes. One scene is situated in front of a mountain cave (belonging to the Flower Mountain); several persons are walking and kneeling on a large serpent. The Maya maize god is shown in the midst of a group of men and women, while receiving (or perhaps bequeathing) a vine calabash. The other scene shows four babies, with their umbilical cords still attached, surrounding a calabash, which has now split up and from which a fifth, and fully clothed male emerges. A large deity figure watches the scene.\n\nThe west wall mural has a far greater number of scenes. One part of the mural has four successive images of trees with birds, kings with the markings of the Maya Hero Twin Hunahpu, and sacrifices (consisting of fish, deer, turkey, and fragrant blossoms), to which a fifth tree has been added. The five trees are comparable to the directional trees of the Codex Borgia and to those mentioned in the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel; the associated birds represent the Principal Bird Deity. The sacrifices are comparable to those in the Year Bearer section of the Dresden Codex. The first four kings are shown piercing their penises (see fig.), spilling sacrificial blood, then offering a sacrifice. The fifth figure, associated with a fifth tree belonging to the centre - the tree of life itself - is the Maya maize god. The directional representation as a whole might refer to the initial arrangement of the world.\n\nAnother part of the western mural depicts three scenes from the life of the maize god and the coronation of a king, showing divine right to rule coming from the gods, and providing evidence that the Maya had full-fledged monarchies centuries earlier than previously thought. The three maize god scenes show (i) a maize baby held by a man kneeling in the waters; (ii) the maize god inside a turtle cave, dancing before two enthroned, aquatic deities; and (iii) the maize god flying in the sky, or perhaps falling from the sky down into the water. Scene (iii) has been suggested to represent the death of the maize deity. Alternatively, it may refer to the maize god's role as a rain bringer. \n\nFor an explanation of many of the mural scenes, the Popol Vuh hardly offers clues, and scholars have started to look in other directions. The three maize god scenes of the western mural, for example, have been suggested to refer to present-day Gulf Coast myths about a maize god subduing the gods of thunder and lightning and creating the conditions for agriculture. The calabash scene of the northern mural, on the other hand, may constitute (as Van Akkeren has suggested) an illustration of a Pipil myth concerning a group of young boys (rain deities) born, together with their 'youngest brother' (Nanahuatzin), from a gourd tree. In this myth, Nanahuatzin is the one who opens the Maize Mountain and introduces agriculture. At the same time, the author interprets the calabash - now taken as a vine gourd (Maya \"tsu[y]\") - together with its four surrounding babies as a symbol for a place of origins often mentioned in Highland Maya sources, \"Suywa\" or \"Tsuywa\", to be situated somewhere in the Gulf Coast region.\n\nThe earliest inscriptions which are identifiably Maya have been found at San Bartolo; they date to the 3rd century BC. In particular, an important stone block text has been found dating to around 300 BC. It has been argued that this text celebrates an upcoming time period ending celebration. This time period may have been projected to end sometime between 7.3.0.0.0 and 7.5.0.0.0 — 295 and 256 BCE, respectively. Besides this being the earliest Maya hieroglyphic text so far uncovered, it would arguably be the earliest existing glyphic evidence of a Mesoamerican Long Count calendar notation in Mesoamerica.\n"}
{"id": "20105034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20105034", "title": "Seventh-day Adventist worship", "text": "Seventh-day Adventist worship\n\nThe Seventh-day Sabbath is seen as an important aspect of worship. Seventh-day Adventist believe it is day which God set aside from the beginning, specifically for holy purposes, on which all Mankind should rest from their labor during the week and come together to worship the Creator. One Adventist author wrote, \"Worship involves an attitude of mind and heart which enables man to love God with all his being.\"\nThe major weekly church worship service occurs on Saturday, typically commencing with Sabbath School which is a structured time of small-group study at church. Most Adventists make use of an officially produced \"Sabbath School Lesson\", which deals with a particular biblical text or doctrine every quarter. Special meetings are provided for children and youth in different age groups during this time (analogous to Sunday school in other churches).\n\nAfter a brief break, the community joins together again for a church service that follows a typical evangelical format, with a sermon as a central feature. Corporate singing, Scripture readings, prayers and an offering, including tithing (or money collection), are other standard features. They would normally have bible class and AY (Adventist Youths) and vespers to close the Sabbath.\n\nThe weekly church service can also include a baptism which is done in the form of immersion, in which the candidate is submerged completely under the water. Adventist teach that baptism symbolizes and declares our new faith in Christ and our trust in His forgiveness, and buried in the water, we arise to a new life in Jesus, empowered by the Holy Spirit. The 15th Fundamental Belief states \"By baptism we confess our faith in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and testify of our death to sin and of our purpose to walk in newness of life. Thus we acknowledge Christ as Lord and Saviour, become His people, and are received as members by His church. Baptism is a symbol of our union with Christ, the forgiveness of our sins, and our reception of the Holy Spirit. It is by immersion in water and is contingent on an affirmation of faith in Jesus and evidence of repentance of sin. It follows instruction in the Holy Scriptures and acceptance of their teachings. (Matt. 28:19, 20; Acts 2:38; 16:30-33; 22:16; Rom. 6:1-6; Gal. 3:27; Col. 2:12, 13.).\"\n\nAdventist worship is generally restrained and carefully organized. Ellen White, on the topic of appropriate music, referred Adventists to the Bible and her writings. She encouraged believers to use judgement and hindsight when considering music that is uplifting. She said, \"Those things which have been in the past will be in the future. Satan will make music a snare by the way in which it is conducted. God calls upon His people, who have the light before them in the Word and in the Testimonies, to read and consider, and to take heed. Clear and definite instruction has been given in order that all may understand. But the itching desire to originate something new results in strange doctrines, and largely destroys the influence of those who would be a power for good if they held firm the beginning of their confidence in the truth the Lord had given them. \" In her book \"Education,\" White writes about the use of music for the uplift of souls. She writes that music \"is one of the most effective means of impressing the heart with spiritual truth. . . . As a part of religious service, singing is as much an act of worship as is prayer. Indeed, many a song is prayer. . . . Heaven's communion begins on earth. We learn here the keynote of its praise.\" According to White, \"Music, when not abused, is a great blessing; but when it is put to a wrong use, it is a terrible curse.\"\n\nThe Adventist leaders used her advice and have based a theory of Adventist worship music on verses such as Job 38:7, 2 Samuel 6:15, Psalm 150:3, 1 Corinthians 10:31, Phillipians 4:8, Revelation 4:9-11, 14:1-3, and 19:1-8. These verses advocate the use of music to uplift and praise God. The General Conference voted to propose a list of general music guidelines based on the principles that \"music is not morally and spiritually neutral\" and that \"we cannot be indifferent to it.\" This led to the following nine principles, summarized here:\nAdventists usually practice communion four times a year. The communion is an open service that is available to members and Christian non-members. It commences with a foot washing ceremony, known as the \"Ordinance of Humility\", based on the Gospel account of . The Ordinance of Humility is meant to symbolize Christ's washing of his disciples' feet at the Last Supper and remind participants of the need to humbly serve one another. Participants segregate by gender to separate rooms to conduct this ritual, although some congregations allow married couples to perform the ordinance on each other and families are often encouraged to participate together. After its completion, participants return to the main sanctuary for consumption of the Lord's Supper, which consists of the pastor and elders consecrating and sharing unleavened bread and unfermented grape juice with the members.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He lived about 1390-1440 (Gedaliah ibn Yaḥya, \"Shalshelet ha-Ḳabbalah,\" ed. Venice, p. 62b). He was the father of Joseph ibn Shem-Tov and Isaac ibn Shem-Tov.\n\nHe wrote: \"Sefer ha-Emunot,\" on religious dogmas (Ferrara, 1556); \"Sefer Yesodot\" (perhaps only another title for the preceding); a commentary on the \"Pesach Haggadah\" (Steinschneider, \"Cat. Munich,\" 264, 3; idem, \"Cat. Bodl.\" col. 99). The \"Sefer ha-Emunot\" is an attack on the Aristotelian philosophy and on the rationalistic conception of Judaism. It is also a eulogy of the Kabbala, \"the true teaching, which has lived on through tradition and which alone can help Israel.\" Shem Tov endeavors to prove that, from the standpoint of positive Judaism, there is not the agreement between religion and philosophy that is claimed by many Jewish philosophers. In the introduction he makes the philosophical investigators and the \"enlightenment\" brought about by them responsible for the defection from Judaism and for the political persecutions of the times. He renders especially severe judgments upon Maimonides (whom he understood to be withholding belief in resurrection), upon Abraham ibn Ezra, upon Levi ben Gershon, and upon other men of liberal views.\n\nIn his survey of the historical development of the Kabbala, Shem Tov cites a number of older kabbalistic writers, whose existence, however, is not thereby proved. This reference to them is appended to a short passage from the Zohar. Moses Alashkar vehemently opposed Shem Tov's dogmatic system in his \"Hassagot Al Mah She-Katab R. Shem-Tov Neged ha-RaMbaM\" (Ferrara, 1556). The \"Sefer ha-Emunot\" has been much cited by both old and modern authors, and is valuable for the history of the Kabbala. To judge from a remark on page 31b it would seem that Ibn Shem-Tov wrote other works, but nothing is known concerning them.\n\n"}

She symbolically represents the unfathomable power of Mother Goddess Shakti. As per Devi Mahatmyam, in the battle against the forces of Shumbh and Nishumbh, Mother Goddess took the manifestation of the Saptamatrikas. They were Shaktis of the male gods. After this appeared Shivaduti, the Shakti of Mother Goddess. This form is not associated with any male form. Devi Mahatmyam states that she appeared from the body of Mother Goddess in the most gruesome form – yelping like a hundred jackals. She then asked Lord Shiva to carry the message to Shumbha and Nishumbha that if they desire to battle against her out of arrogance and false belief in their strength, then they and their forces be ready to be devoured by her jackals. It must be noted here that Goddess Shivaduti is a symbolic representation of what form Goddess Shakti can take to put down Adharma.\n\nAccording to Kalika Purana,Shivadooti is described as having red complexion,matted hair with three eyes and four arms.

It is considered to be the most significant work after Charyapada in the history of Bengali literature. These verses are believed to be written in the pre-Chaitanya era of the later half of 14th century CE.\n\nIn 1909, Basanta Ranjan Roy Bidvatballava retrieved the \"punthi\" (manuscript) of Sri Krishna Kirtana from a shelf in the cowshed of Debendranath Mukhopadhyay, a resident of Kankilya Village, Bankura. Since the \"punthi\" was found shorn of its pages including the opening and ending ones, its original name could not be ascertained. A slip inside the \"punthi\" reveals that it was initially preserved in the royal library of Bishnupur under the name of Sri Krishna Sandarva. However, the \"punthi\", edited and rechristened as Shreekrishna Kirtana by Bidvatballava, was published by Vangiya Sahitya Parishad in 1916.\n\nThe Sri Krishna Kirtana of Boru Chandidas was deeply influenced by the Vishnu Purana, the popular folk-literature of the period and the Gitagovindam by Jaydeva. The influence of other Puranas like the Padma Purana and the Brahma Vaivarta Purana and the Vaishnava scriptures is also substantial. There is a strong affinity of popular folk literature of the time in the style of the verse.\n\nSri Krishna Kirtana consists of 417 Bengali \"pada\"s (verses) and 133 (total 161, 28 shlokas are repeated twice) Sanskrit \"shloka\"s, which were also probably composed by the poet. The extant work is divided into 13 \"khanda\"s (sections), namely, \"Janma\" (birth), \"Tamvula\" (piper betel which was considered as a token of love in that time), \"Dana\" (tax-collection), \"Nauka\" (boat), \"Bhara\" (burden), \"Vrindavana\", \"Yamuna\", \"Bana\" (arrow), \"Vamshi\" (flute) and \"Radha Viraha\" (estrangement of Radha) (the last khanda is not named by the poet). \"Yamuna khanda\" is further divided into three sub-sections. The first sub-section is \"Kaliya Damana khanda\" (coercion of Kaliya, the snake-demon section), and the third sub-section is \"Hara khanda\" (necklace section). The name of the second sub-section has not been found in the manuscript, but its subject matter is Radha's \"vastraharana\" (stealing Radha's robes). \"Bhara Khanda\" consists of a sub-section, named \"Chatra khanda\" (umbrella section). Three characters, Krishna, Radha and Badayi, the messenger interrelate the plot of the play. Dialogues and counter-dialogues in \"payar\" and \"tripadi\" meters have added to the dramatic quality of Sri Krishna Kirtana.\n\nShrikrsnakirtan is a lyrical composition involving Radha and Krishna; its storyline is not based on the Bhagavata Purana, but the popular erotic folk-songs, known as the \"dhamali\"s. However, Baru Chandidas managed to add substantial originality, making it a masterpiece of medieval Bengali literature. He gives the yearning of Radha a distinctly Bengali rendition, and in the process captures much of the social conditions of the day.\n"}
{"id": "189740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=189740", "title": "Spiritism", "text": "Spiritism\n\nSpiritism is a spiritualistic philosophy and religion codified in the 19th century by the French educator Hippolyte Léon Denizard Rivail, under the pen name Allan Kardec; it proposed the study of \"the nature, origin, and destiny of spirits, and their relation with the corporeal world\".\n\nSpiritism soon spread to other countries, having today 35 countries represented in the International Spiritist Council.\n\nSpiritism postulates that humans are essentially immortal spirits that temporarily inhabit physical bodies for several necessary incarnations to attain moral and intellectual improvement. It also asserts that spirits, through passive or active mediumship, may have beneficent or malevolent influence on the physical world.\n\nThe term first appeared in Kardec's book, \"The Spirits Book\", which sought to distinguish Spiritism from spiritualism.\n\nSpiritism has influenced a social movement of healing centers, charity institutions and hospitals involving millions of people in dozens of countries, with the greatest number of adherents in Brazil.\nSpiritism was also very influential in the new Vietnamese religion called Cao Đài or Caodaism, born in 1926 after three spirit mediums received messages that identified Allan Kardec as a prophet of a new universal religion.\n\nSpiritism is based on the five books of the Spiritist Codification written by French educator Hypolite Léon Denizard Rivail under the pseudonym Allan Kardec, in which he reported observations of phenomena at séances that he attributed to incorporeal intelligence (spirits). His work was later extended by writers such as Léon Denis, Gabriel Delanne, Arthur Conan Doyle, Ernesto Bozzano, Gustav Geley, Chico Xavier, Divaldo Pereira Franco, Emídio Brasileiro, Alexandr Aksakov, William Crookes, Oliver Lodge, Albert de Rochas, and Amalia Domingo Soler. Kardec's research was influenced by the Fox sisters and the use of talking boards. Interest in Mesmerism also contributed to early Spiritism.\n\nEmanuel Swedenborg (January 29, 1688 – March 29, 1772) was a Christian Lutheran Swedish scientist, philosopher, seer, and theologian. Swedenborg had a prolific career as an inventor and scientist. At 56, he claimed to have experienced visions of the spiritual world and talked with angels, devils, and spirits by visiting heaven and hell. He claimed he was directed by the Lord Jesus Christ to reveal the doctrines of his second coming.\n\nSwedenborg, however, warned against seeking contact with spirits. In his work \"Apocalypse Explained,\" #1182.4, he wrote, \"Many persons believe that man can be taught by the Lord by means of spirits speaking with him. But those who believe this, and desire to do so, are not aware that it is associated with danger to their souls.\" See also \"Heaven and Hell\" #249\n\nNevertheless, Swedenborg is often cited by Spiritists as a major precursor for their beliefs.\n\nSisters Catherine (1838–92), Leah (1814–90) and Margaretta (1836–93) Fox played an important role in the development of Modern Spiritualism. The daughters of John and Margaret Fox, they were residents of Hydesville, New York. In 1848, the family began to hear unexplained rapping sounds. Kate and Maggie conducted channeling sessions in an attempt to contact the presumed spiritual entity creating the sounds, and claimed contact with the spirit of a peddler who was allegedly murdered and buried beneath the house. A skeleton later found in the basement seemed to confirm this. The Fox girls became instant celebrities. They demonstrated their communication with the spirit by using taps and knocks, automatic writing or psychography, and later even voice communication, as the spirit took control of one of the girls.\n\nSkeptics suspected this was deception and fraud, and sister Margaretta eventually confessed to using her toe-joints to produce the sound. Although she later recanted this confession, she and her sister Catherine were widely considered discredited, and died in poverty. Nonetheless, belief in the ability to communicate with the dead grew rapidly, becoming a religious movement called Spiritualism, which contributed significantly to Kardec's ideas.\n\nAfter the news of the Fox sisters came to France, people became more interested in what was sometimes termed the \"Spiritual Telegraph\". Planchette, the precursor of the pencil-less Ouija boards, simplified the writing process which achieved widespread popularity in America and Europe.\n\nFranz Anton Mesmer (May 23, 1734 – March 5, 1815) discovered what he called \"magnétisme animal\" (animal magnetism), which became known as \"mesmerism\". The evolution of Mesmer's ideas and practices led Scottish surgeon James Braid (1795–1860) to develop hypnotism in 1841.\n\nSpiritism incorporated various concepts from Mesmerism, among them faith healing and the energization of water to be used as a medicine.\n\nAlthough there are many similarities, Spiritism differs from spiritualism in a number of ways.\n\nIn \"What Is Spiritism?\", Kardec calls spiritism a science dedicated to the relationship between incorporeal beings (spirits) and human beings. Thus, some Spiritists see themselves as not adhering to a religion, but to a philosophical doctrine with a scientific fulcrum and moral grounds.\n\nAnother author in the Spiritualist movement, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle included a chapter about Spiritism in his book \"History of Spiritualism\", in which he states that Spiritism is Spiritualist, but not vice versa. As a consequence, many Spiritualist works are widely accepted in Spiritism, particularly the works of 19th-century physicists William Crookes and Oliver Lodge.\n\nThe basic doctrine of Spiritism (\"the Codification\") is defined in five of Allan Kardec's books:\n\n\nKardec also wrote a brief introductory pamphlet (\"What Is Spiritism?\") and was the most frequent contributor to the \"Spiritist Review\". His essays and articles were posthumously collected into the \"Posthumous Works\".\n\nAs defined in \"The Spirits' Book\", the main principles of spiritism are:\n\nAccording to Kardec, the Spiritist moral principles are in agreement with those taught by Jesus. Other individuals such as Francis of Assisi, Paul the Apostle, Buddha and Gandhi are also sometimes considered by the Spiritists. Spiritist philosophical inquiry is concerned with the study of moral aspects in the context of an eternal life in spiritual evolution through reincarnation, a process believers hold as revealed by Spirits. Sympathetic research on Spiritism by scientists can be found in the works of Oliver Lodge, William Crookes, William Fletcher Barrett, Albert de Rochas, Emma Bragdon, Alexander Moreira-Almeida and others.\n\nThe five chief points of the Spiritism are:\n\n\nThe central tenet of Spiritism is the belief in \"spiritual life\". From this perspective, the spirit is eternal, and evolves through a series of incarnations in the material world.\n\nSpiritists consider Jesus to be the greatest moral example for humankind. They believe he incarnated on earth to demonstrate the path to achieve spiritual perfection. In this way, Spiritism identifies as a form of Christianity, claiming it is based on Jesus Christ's teachings, despite having an interpretation that differs from those held by mainstream Christian denominations. The Gospels are studied and interpreted in Spiritism; it asserts that some of Jesus' words and actions are clarified in the light of the spiritual phenomena (presented as law of nature, and not as something miraculous).\n\nSpiritists assert that communication between the spiritual world and the material world happens all the time, to varying degrees. They believe that some people barely sense what the spirits tell them in an entirely instinctive way, and are not aware about their influence. In contrast, they believe that mediums have these natural abilities highly developed, and are able to communicate with spirits and interact with them visually or audibly, or through writing (known by Kardecists as psychography or automatic writing).(See The Book of Mediums by Allan Kardec Chapters X to XIII)\n\nKardec's works do not establish any rituals or formal practices. Instead, the doctrine suggests that followers adhere to some principles common to all religions. The religious experience within spiritism is, therefore, largely informal.\n\nThe most important types of practices within Spiritism are:\n\nSpiritist associations have various degrees of formality, with some groups having local, regional, national or international scope. Local organizations are usually called \"Spiritist centres\" or \"Spiritist societies\". Regional and national organizations are called \"federations\", such as the Federação Espírita Brasileira and the Federación Espírita Española; international organizations are called \"unions\", such as the Union Spirite Française et Francophone. Spiritist centres (especially in Brazil) are often active book publishers and promoters of Esperanto.\n\nFor many of its followers, the description of Spiritism is three-fold: science, for its studies on the mechanisms of mediumship; philosophy, for its theories on the origin, meaning and importance of life; and religion, for its guidance on Christian behavior which will bring spiritual and moral evolution to mankind. Spiritism is not considered a religion by some of its followers because it does not endorse formal adoration, require regular frequency or formal membership. However, the mainstream scientific community does not accept Spiritism as scientific, and its belief system fits within the definition of religion.\n\nSpiritism has adherents in many countries, including Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Jamaica, Japan, Portugal, Spain, United States, and particularly in Latin American countries such as Argentina, Uruguay, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Brazil, which has the largest proportion and greatest number of followers. The largest Spiritist group in Asia are the Vietnamese followers of Cao Đài or Caodaists, who formed a new religion building on the legacy of Allan Kardec in 1926 in Saigon and Tây Ninh in what was then French Indochina \n\nIn Brazil, the movement has become widely accepted, largely due to Chico Xavier's works. The official Spiritist community there has about 20 million adepts, although some elements of spiritism are more broadly accepted and practiced in various ways by three times as many people across the country. Some statistics suggest an adherence to Spiritist practices by 40 million people in Brazil.\n\nIn the Philippines, there is the Union Espiritista Cristiana de Filipinas, Incorporada (Union of Christian Spiritists in the Philippines, Inc.), which was founded at the turn of the 1900s and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1905. The religious organization, which uses human mediums to communicate with spirits that have already attained purity or divinity for moral and spiritual guidance, has tens of thousands of members and worship centers in many parts of the country, mostly in Northern Luzon, Central Luzon and the National Capital Region. Its motto: \"Towards God through wisdom and love.\" Its doctrine: \"Without charity (good deed), there is no possible salvation.\" It uses the Holy Bible as the basis of its teachings, supplemented by messages from divine spirits.\n\nSince its early development, Spiritism has attracted criticism. Kardec's own introductory book on Spiritism, \"What is Spiritism?\", published only two years after \"The Spirits' Book\", includes a hypothetical discussion between him and three idealized critics, \"The Critic\", \"The Skeptic\", and \"The Priest\", summing up much of the criticism Spiritism has received. The broad areas of criticism relate to charlatanism, pseudoscience, heresy, witchcraft, and Satanism. Until his death, Kardec continued to address these issues in various books and in his periodical, the \"Revue Spirite\".\n\nLater, a new source of criticism came from Occultist movements such as the Theosophical Society, a competing new religion, which saw the Spiritist explanations as too simple or even naïve.\n\nDuring the interwar period a new form of criticism of Spiritism developed. René Guénon's influential book \"The Spiritist Fallacy\" criticized both the more general concepts of Spiritualism, which he considered to be a superficial mix of moralism and spiritual materialism, as well as Spiritism's specific contributions, such as its belief in what he saw as a post-Cartesian, modernist concept of reincarnation distinct from and opposed to its two western predecessors, metempsychosis and transmigration.\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church (paragraph 2117) states that \"\"Spiritism\" often implies divination or magical practices; the Church for her part warns the faithful against it\".\n\nIn Brazil, Catholic priests Carlos Kloppenburg and Oscar González Quevedo, among others, have written extensively against Spiritism from both a doctrinal and parapsychological perspective. Quevedo, in particular, has sought to show that Spiritism's claims of being a science are invalid. In addition to writing books on the subject, he has also hosted television programs debunking supposed paranormal phenomena, most recently in a series that ran in 2000 on Globo's news program, Fantástico. Brazilian Spiritist, Hernani Guimarães Andrade, has in turn written rebuttals to these criticisms.\n\nScientific skeptics also frequently target Spiritism in books, media appearances, and online forums, identifying it as a pseudoscience. \n\nChico Xavier (April 2, 1910 – June 30, 2002) was a popular Spiritist medium and philanthropist in Brazil's spiritism movement who wrote more than 490 books and over 10,000 letters to family members of deceased people, ostensibly using psychography. His books sold millions of copies, all of which had their proceeds donated to charity. They purportedly included poetry, novels, and even scientific treatises, some of which are considered by Brazilian Spiritist followers to be fundamental for the comprehension of the practical and theoretical aspects of Allan Kardec's doctrine. One of his most famous books, \"\", details one experience after dying. The book became a movie in 2010 available in multiple languages in addition to over 15 other movies.\n\nThe following works contain concepts related to Spiritist beliefs:\n\n\nIn Brazil, a number of soap operas have plots incorporating Spiritism.\n\n\nFor a list of writings by Allan Kardec see his biographic article.\n"}

Between 2011 and 2013, Davis did not make any public appearances in the media. In June 2013, it was revealed that Davis and his wife had relocated from Gold Base in Riverside County, California to Austin, Texas. He currently resides in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2016, he became the General Manager of Consolidated Press Holdings North America LLC, a private investment vehicle owned by Australian billionaire James Packer, but his employment there was terminated in July 2017 .\n\nDavis previously worked for the Sea Org as a non-uniformed member. According to a Church of Scientology press release, in 2001 Davis was the Celebrity Centre's Vice President. He was the chief spokesperson of the Church of Scientology from 2005 to 2011, a position previously held by Mike Rinder.\n\nOn June 13, 2003, Davis went with actor and Scientologist Tom Cruise and Kurt Weiland, director of external affairs for Scientology's Office of Special Affairs and Scientology vice president of communications, to meet with then-United States Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage. In the half-hour-long private meeting, they raised concerns with Armitage about the treatment of Scientologists in Germany and other countries.\n\nDavis was a senior-level Scientologist, spokesman for the Church of Scientology, and a member of the Church of Scientology's Sea Organization or \"Sea Org\". He is a member of the International Association of Scientologists, and as of 2006 was listed as a Patron in their publication \"Impact Magazine\".\n\nDavis accompanied \"Rolling Stone\" writer Janet Reitman along with former head of Scientology's Office of Special Affairs Mike Rinder on a tour of the Gold Base in Hemet, California in 2005. In 2007, Davis gained international attention from events surrounding the making of a documentary about Scientology entitled \"Scientology and Me\", screened as an installment of the BBC public affairs series \"Panorama\". The \"Panorama\" reporter, John Sweeney, reported that he met with Davis early on and could not reach agreement with him on whether individuals attacking Scientology should be interviewed for the film, and whether the program should refer to Scientology as a \"cult\". As the BBC documentary was filmed, Scientologists made a parallel documentary, a camera crew shadowing Sweeney and chronicling his work. Davis made allegations against \"Panorama\" and the BBC that they were \"spying\" on the church of Scientology and harassed the reporter, John Sweeney by stalking him to various meetings with critics but he never filed a report against Sweeney.\n\nWhile Sweeney was visiting the Scientology exhibition \"\", Davis accused him of being biased and of having been too easy on one of his interviewees. Sweeney lost his temper. The Church of Scientology released the resulting footage, showing Sweeney becoming angry, on YouTube, and the counter-documentary attacking Sweeney's methods was posted to UK politicians and media organizations. \"Panorama\" responded by posting its own YouTube clip, showing Davis losing his temper and abruptly ending an interview when Sweeney used the words \"sinister cult\". The BBC subsequently stated it was happy that on the whole, Sweeney had performed his work in a fair and proper manner.\n\nIn the same BBC documentary, Davis interrupted when celebrity members are asked about Xenu, saying: \"None of us know what you're talking about. It's loony. It's weird.\" In a May 8, 2008 appearance on CNN, Davis was asked by CNN's John Roberts if \"... the basic tenet of the Church of Scientology is to rid the body of space-alien parasites, to clear oneself\"; Davis responded: \"Well, John, does that sound silly to you? I mean it’s unrecognizable to me.\" In response, Tony Ortega of \"The Village Voice\" stated \"It’s also a grand tradition, among Scientology spokespeople, to act bewildered when they’re facing a camera and they’re asked about Xenu and space-alien thetans. Tommy Davis is just doing what other mouthpieces have said in the past.\" In March 2009 Davis was interviewed by investigative journalist Nathan Baca for KESQ-TV and was again asked about the OT III materials containing the Xenu myth. When read an excerpt from Hubbard's writing, Davis told Baca \"I'm familiar with the material,\" and said that the issue at hand was \"the confidential scriptures of the Church,\" and thus refused to elaborate on the issue.\n\nAfter the death of Jett Travolta, son of celebrity Scientologist John Travolta, the Church of Scientology came under fire from critical groups accusing it of being irresponsible; Jett had died of a seizure soon after being taken off his medication. Davis responded by denying that Scientology keeps people from taking medications, and also denying that it claims to cure disease. He stated in one interview, \"The bottom line is that Scientologists seek conventional medical treatment for medical conditions.\"\n\nDavis was interviewed by journalist Martin Bashir for the ABC News program \"Nightline\", in a piece called \"Inside Scientology\", which aired in October 2009. Davis ripped off his microphone and stormed off the set of the interview after he was questioned about whether he believed that 75 million years ago a galactic ruler called Xenu brought individuals to Earth and killed them in volcanoes. An hour before the segment aired he appeared at ABC headquarters and demanded that a security guard let him in. Security called \"Nightline\" representatives, and they met with Davis who demanded the segment not be aired and he be allowed to speak with Bashir. Davis was told that Bashir could not meet with him and that the interview was already edited and would air. The following week director Paul Haggis accused Davis of lying on CNN, when Davis said disconnection did not happen, but Haggis and his wife were \"ordered\" by Scientology to disconnect from family. Haggis, in the same letter, announced he was leaving the organization. Davis responded that Haggis's claims were based on misunderstandings. In 2009, Larry Anderson, an actor, spoke with Davis about getting his money and leaving Scientology, which was reported in the \"St. Petersburg Times\".\n\nIn July 2010 the Church of Scientology International publicized a \"Scientology Newsroom\" website tailored for members of the media; Davis was one of four international representatives for Scientology listed as spokespersons. John Sweeney and Mike Rinder, a former Scientology relations officer stated in a BBC documentary, \"The Secrets of Scientology\", that Davis authorized the following of Sweeney in order to provoke a reaction by mental engagement. Davis was quoted as saying \"I can drive him 'psychotic'.\"\n\nDavis is the son of real estate investor William Davis and film actress and Scientologist Anne Archer. He has a half-brother, Jeffrey Tucker Jastrow. His stepfather is an Emmy-award winning actor and producer, Terry Jastrow.\n\nDavis was raised as a Christian Scientist, but his mother joined Scientology when he was 3 years old. Davis claims that after taking two courses at the Celebrity Centre, he became a Scientologist at the age of 17. He attended Harvard School For Boys in Los Angeles, a private Episcopal church-affiliated college preparatory school (now called Harvard-Westlake School). In 1990, he was accepted at Columbia University. He attended college for a semester, but dropped out to join the Sea Org.\n\nDavis is a friend of actor and Scientologist Tom Cruise, and a former friend of actor Jason Beghe, who left the church in 2007. He is independently wealthy as his family obtained success in the real estate business, and told \"Rolling Stone\": \"I have enough money to never work a day in my life.\"\n\nDavis was married to Jessica Feshbach, who was a fellow spokesperson for the Church of Scientology but left that position in mid-2011. The pair divorced in 2018. They have two children, Chloe and Delilah. \n\n"}

Signed to Reach Records, he has recorded both as a solo artist and as a founding member of the 116 Clique. Originally from Dallas, Texas, he now resides in Atlanta, Georgia, and is a teaching pastor at Cornerstone Church. He first gained recognition after appearing on the Reach Records website at the age of 16. His third album, \"Between Two Worlds\", was nominated for two Dove Awards and won the Stellar Award for Best Hip Hop Album in 2011.\n\nWilliam Lee Barefield III was born and raised in Dallas, TX. As a young boy, Lee had dreams of being a professional athlete or a famous rapper, and he began to hone his lyrical skills at the age of 12. \"I rapped about random stuff… how hot I was, how many girls I could pull,\" Lee says. But upon giving his life to Christ, at age 14, his focus changed from fortune, fame, and women to serving and ministering the Gospel.\n\nLee slowly recognized that all of his life should be centered around Christ. \"One day, I just decided, I'm only doing Christian hip hop. Rappers like Ambassador and Da' T.R.U.T.H. helped provide a model for how I would begin to do that,\" he says. He also had an immense desire to learn and teach the Word of God, so he became a leader in his youth group where he preached his first sermon at age 17.\n\nIn 2004, Lee met Lecrae at a concert; months later, after talking and building with each other, Lecrae began to disciple him. While still in high school, Lee was given the opportunity to pen a few devotionals for the Reach Records website that dealt with theological matters and showcased his spiritual maturity.\n\nLee signed with Reach Records, and his debut album, \"If They Only Knew\", was released a few days after his high school graduation. His first full-length album introduced hip-hop fans to his distinct southern sound, unique delivery, and gospel-saturated lyrics. That same year, he was also featured on the Dove Award-nominated, \"Jesus Muzik\" with label mate Lecrae.\n\nHis second album, \"20/20\", was released in 2008 and garnered much success, breaking into the Billboard Top 200 and reaching No. 11 on the Billboard Christian albums chart and No. 4 on the Gospel chart. Back with his third studio album, \"Between Two Worlds\", Lee offers a collection of reflections on life in a fallen world. His hope is that his reflections not only resonate with listeners, but also point to Jesus as the hero.\n\nSince his first album release, Lee has traveled the world doing concerts for thousands of listeners, and his last three summers have been spent on national and international tours with his Reach label mates. His Christ-centered hip-hop message has also built a platform for him among churches and other Christian organizations, which has led to numerous opportunities to preach and teach at conferences and other events.\n\nLee released two new singles \"Brag On My Lord\" and \"King Like Mine\", the latter featuring Alex Medina, on March 29, 2011.\n\nTrip Lee released his fourth full-length studio album, entitled \"The Good Life\" on April 9, 2012. The album featured various notable Christian artists, such as Sho Baraka (formerly signed with Reach Records), J.R., Lecrae, J.Paul, KB, Andy \"C-Lite\" Mineo, Jimmy Needham, V. Rose, Suzy Rock, Jai, and Leah Smith. As a continuation to the album, Lee has worked with Moody Publishers and has authored a book titled \"The Good Life\", to be released October 1, 2012.\n\nOn October 9, 2012 Lee announced he would be \"stepping away\" from music altogether. The Unashamed 2012 tour with the Reach Records roster was his final tour before pursuing a career as an author and pastor. He later clarified that while he would continue to make music, he wouldn't be touring as much. He is currently training to be a pastor at his local church, while still engaging in public ministry.\n\nOn October 27, 2014, Trip Lee released his fifth studio album, \"Rise\". On January 27, 2015 he released his second book called \"Rise: Get Up and Live in God's Great Story\" to accompany the album. He was part of the Winter Jam Tour 2016 along with KB and Tedashii in the central and eastern parts of the United States.\n\nOn December 9, 2016 Trip Lee released the album titled, \"The Waiting Room.\" The title was inspired by a line in the song, \"Take Me There\" from his, \"The Good Life\" album. He says the album highlights the fact that, as a Christian, his life is much like sitting in a waiting room, looking for what God has ahead.\n\nTrip Lee married Jessica Barefield in 2009. The couple have two children.\n\nLee is an Evangelical Christian.\n\nLee attended Cairn University and Boyce College, the undergraduate school of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky. Lee's unending desire is to proclaim the grace and beauty of Jesus Christ to anyone that will listen.\n\n\n"}

They can be found in the Chinese provinces of Henan, Shanxi and Hebei. Some countries beyond China also have women-only mosques, but they are rare.\n\nIn China, separate women-only mosques were built by the Muslim communities there. This is in contrast to Muslim communities outside China, where usually men and women will use the same mosque, with gender-segregated washing and prayer rooms. At the end of the Ming dynasty and early Qing dynasty, Hui women had begun to form their own mosques. The oldest surviving \"nǚsì\" in China, is Wangjia Hutong Women's Mosque of Kaifeng, which dates to 1820.\n\nFor religious reasons, Hui communities had started to cultivate more theological learning among the women. As a result, a portion of the female Muslims who had experienced a religious education, gradually incorporated Islamic observances into their daily religious activities, and this produced the establishment of women's mosques.\n\nBy the 20th century, there were separate places of worship as women-only mosques. They are a special form of the sacred building, either as a separate institution or mosque attached to an existing larger mosque. Their managers are women, wives of the imam of a larger mosque. The commonly used title for it is \"Shiniang\" (师娘).\n\nFemale Islamic clerics are referred to as \"nü ahong\" (女阿訇) in Chinese.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

There have been different interpretations how many and which women were present. It may be different from different gospels\n\nMatthew and Mark, who speak of \"many women\" present at the crucifixion, mention three individually at the death of Jesus and two at his burial. Matthew describes the third individual present at the death as the mother of the sons of Zebedee, without naming her. Mark's third individual is called Salome. Luke mentions none individually. John mentions four individually, including Jesus' mother Mary, who is not mentioned by the other evangelists.\n\nThe indication in could be interpreted as referring to two, three or four women. There are difficulties against taking it as presenting a double apposition, with \"his mother\" being Mary of Clopas, and \"his mother's sister\" being Mary Magdalene. If the women are three, then there is a single apposition, with Mary of Clopas presented as the sister of Jesus' mother (despite the awkwardness of having two sisters bearing the same name) or else, since Hebrew and Aramaic had no specific word for \"cousin\", presented as her cousin or her sister-in-law, with Clopas considered the brother of Joseph. If there is no apposition, the women are four, as understood by Tatian and the Peshitta. If the last interpretation is chosen, the accounts that the four evangelists give of individual women present at the crucifixion are:\n\nMary Magdalene is mentioned by all the evangelists apart from Luke, who mentions no individual. Mary, mother of James and Joseph/Joses is mentioned by Matthew and Mark. The others are mentioned by one evangelist only: Mary, the mother of Jesus; Mary, the mother of the sons of Zebedee; Salome; a sister of Mary, mother of Jesus; Mary of Clopas. Attempts have been made to consider all these, except Mary, the mother of Jesus, as different designations of the same woman.\n\nThus Salome has been supposed to be the same as Mary of Clopas and to have been the mother of Zebedee's sons James and John, and a half-sister or sister-in-law of Mary the mother of Jesus.

{"id": "66304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66304", "title": "Yoni", "text": "Yoni\n\nYoni (; sometimes also ), sometimes referred to as \"pindika\", is an aniconic representation of goddess Shakti in Hinduism. It is usually shown with \"linga\" – its masculine counterpart. Together, they symbolize the merging of microcosmos and macrocosmos, the divine eternal process of creation and regeneration, and the union of the feminine and the masculine that recreates all of existence. The \"yoni\" is conceptualized as nature's gateway of all births, particularly in the esoteric Kaula and Tantra practices, as well as the Shaktism and Shaivism traditions of Hinduism.\n\n\"Yoni\" is a Sanskrit word that has been interpreted to literally mean the womb, and the female organs of generation. It also connotes the female sexual organs such as \"vagina\", \"vulva\", and \"uterus\", or alternatively to \"origin, abode, or source\" of anything in other contexts. For example, the Vedanta text \"Brahma Sutras\" metaphorically refers to the metaphysical concept \"Brahman\" as the \"yoni of the universe\". The \"yoni\" with \"linga\" iconography is found in Shiva temples and archaeological sites of the Indian subcontinent and southeast Asia, as well in sculptures such as the \"Lajja Gauri\".\n\nYoni (Sanskrit: योनि), states Monier Monier-Williams, appears in the \"Rigveda\" and other Vedic literature in the sense of feminine life-creating regenerative and reproductive organs, as well as in the sense of \"source, origin, fountain, place of birth, womb, nest, abode, fire pit of incubation\". Other contextual meanings of the term include \"race, caste, family, fertility symbol, grain or seed\". It is a spiritual metaphor and icon in Hinduism for the origin and the feminine regenerative powers in the nature of existence. The \"Brahma Sutras\" metaphorically calls the metaphysical concept \"Brahman\" as the \"yoni of the universe\", which Adi Shankara states in his commentaries means the material cause and \"source of the universe\".\n\nAccording to Indologists Constance Jones and James D. Ryan, the yoni symbolizes the female principle in all life forms as well as the \"earth's seasonal and vegetative cycles\", thus is an emblem of cosmological significance. The yoni is a metaphor for nature's gateway of all births, particularly in the Shaktism and Shaivism traditions of Hinduism, as well as the esoteric Kaula and Tantra sects. \"Yoni\" together with the \"lingam\" is a symbol for \"prakriti\", its cyclic creation and dissolution. According to Corinne Dempsey – a professor of Religious Studies, yoni is an \"aniconic form of the goddess\" in Hinduism, the feminine principle \"Shakti\".\n\nThe \"yoni\" is sometimes referred to as \"pindika\". The base on which the linga-yoni sit is called the \"pitha\", but in some texts such as the \"Nisvasa tattva samhita\" and \"Mohacudottara\", the term \"pitha\" generically refers to the base and the yoni.\n\nThe reverence for yoni, state Jones and Ryan, is probably pre-Vedic. Figurines recovered from Zhob valley and dated to the 4th millennium BCE show pronounced breasts and yoni, and these may have been fertility symbols used in prehistoric times that ultimately evolved into later spiritual symbols. According to David Lemming, the yoni worship tradition dates to the pre-Vedic period, over the 4000 BCE to 1000 BCE period.\n\nThe yoni has served as a divine symbol from ancient times, and it may well be the oldest spiritual icon not only in India but across many ancient cultures. Some in the orthodox Western cultures, states the Indologist Laura Amazzone, have treated the feminine sexual organs and sexuality in general as a taboo subject, but in Indic religions and other ancient cultures the yoni has long been accepted as profound cosmological and philosophical truth, of the feminine potential and power, one mysteriously interconnected with the natural periodic cycles of moon, earth and existence.\nThe yoni is considered to be an abstract representation of Shakti and Devi, the creative force that moves through the entire universe. In tantra, yoni is the origin of life. \n\nThe colonial era archaeologists John Marshall and Ernest Mackay proposed that certain polished stones with holes found at Harappan sites may be evidence of yoni-linga worship in Indus Valley Civilization. Scholars such as Arthur Llewellyn Basham dispute whether such artifacts discovered at the archaeological sites of Indus Valley sites are yoni. For example, Jones and Ryan state that lingam/yoni shapes have been recovered from the archaeological sites at Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, part of the Indus Valley Civilisation. In contrast, Jane McIntosh states that truncated ring stones with holes were once considered as possibly yonis. Later discoveries at the Dholavira site, and further studies, have proven that these were pillar components because the \"truncated ring stones with holes\" are integral architectural components of the pillars. However, states McIntosh, the use of these structures in architecture does not rule out their simultaneous religious significance as yoni.\n\nAccording to the Indologist Asko Parpola, \"it is true that Marshall's and Mackay's hypotheses of linga and yoni worship by the Harappans has rested on rather slender grounds, and that for instance the interpretation of the so-called ring-stones as yonis seems untenable\". He quotes Dales 1984 paper, which states \"with the single exception of the unidentified photography of a realistic phallic object in Marshall's report, there is no archaeological evidence to support claims of special sexually-oriented aspects of Harappan religion\". However, adds Parpola, a re-examination at Indus Valley sites suggest that the Mackay's hypothesis cannot be ruled out because erotic and sexual scenes such as ithyphallic males, naked females, a human couple having intercourse and trefoil imprints have now been identified at the Harappan sites. The \"finely polished circular stand\" found by Mackay may be yoni although it was found without the linga. The absence of linga, states Parpola, maybe because it was made from wood which did not survive.\n\nThe term \"yoni\" and its derivatives appear in ancient medicine and surgery-related Sanskrit texts such as the \"Sushruta Samhita\" and \"Charaka Samhita\". In this context, \"yoni\" broadly refers to \"female sexual and procreative organs\". According to Indologists Rahul Das and Gerrit Meulenbeld known for their translations and reviews of ancient Sanskrit medical and other literature, \"yoni\" \"usually denotes the vagina or the vulva, in a technical sense it also includes the uterus along with these; moreover, yoni- can at times mean simply 'womb, uterus' too, though it [Cakrapanidata's commentary on \"Sushruta Samhita\"] does so relatively seldom\". According to Amit Rupapara et al, \"yoni-roga\" means \"gynecological disorders\" and \"yoni-varti\" means \"vaginal suppository\". The \"Charaka Samhita\" dedicates its 30th chapter in Chikitsa Sthana to \"yoni-vyapath\" or \"gynecological disorders\".\n\nIn sexuality-related Sanskrit literature, as well as Tantric literature, yoni connotes many layers of meanings. Its literal meaning is \"female genitalia\", but it also encompasses other meanings such as \"womb, origin and source\". In some Indic literature, yoni means vagina, and other organs regarded as \"divine symbol of sexual pleasure, the matrix of generation and the visible form of Shakti\".\n\nThe colonial era Orientalists and Christian missionaries, raised in the Victorian mold where sex and sexual imagery were a taboo subject, were shocked by and were hostile to the yoni iconography and reverence they witnessed. The 19th and early 20th-century colonial and missionary literature described yoni, lingam-yoni, and related theology as obscene, corrupt, licentious, hyper-sexualized, puerile, impure, demonic and a culture that had become too feminine and dissolute. To the Hindus, particularly the Shaivites, these icons and ideas were the abstract, a symbol of the entirety of creation and spirituality. The colonial disparagement in part triggered the opposite reaction from Bengali nationalists, who more explicitly valorised the feminine. Vivekananda called for the revival of the Mother Goddess as a feminine force, inviting his countrymen to \"proclaim her to all the world with the voice of peace and benediction\".\n\nAccording to Wendy Doniger, the terms lingam and yoni became explicitly associated with human sexual organs in the western imagination after the widely popular first \"Kamasutra\" translation by Sir Richard Burton in 1883. In his translation, even though the original Sanskrit text does not use the words lingam or yoni for sexual organs, and almost always uses other terms, Burton adroitly avoided been viewed as obscene to the Victorian mindset by avoiding the use of words such as penis, vulva, vagina and other direct or indirect sexual terms in the Sanskrit text to discuss sex, sexual relationships and human sexual positions. Burton used the terms lingam and yoni instead throughout the translation. This conscious and incorrect word substitution, states Doniger, thus served as an Orientalist means to \"anthropologize sex, distance it, make it safe for English readers by assuring them, or pretending to assure them, that the text was not about real sexual organs, their sexual organs, but merely about the appendages of weird, dark people far away.\" Similar Orientalist literature of the Christian missionaries and the British era, states Doniger, stripped all spiritual meanings and insisted on the Victorian vulgar interpretation only, which had \"a negative effect on the self-perception that Hindus had of their own bodies\" and they became \"ashamed of the more sensual aspects of their own religious literature\". Some contemporary Hindus, states Doniger, in their passion to spiritualize Hinduism and for their Hindutva campaign have sought to sanitize the historic earthly sexual meanings, and insist on the abstract spiritual meaning only.\n\nWithin Shaivism, the sect dedicated to the god Shiva, the Shakti is his consort and both have aniconic representations: lingam for Shiva, yoni for Shakti. The yoni iconography is typically represented in the form of a horizontally placed round or square base with a lipped edge and an opening in the center usually with a cylindrical lingam. Often, one side of this base extends laterally, and this projection is called the \"yoni-mukha\". An alternate symbol for yoni that is commonly found in Indic arts is the lotus, an icon found in temples.\n\nThe yoni is one of the sacred icons of the Hindu Shaktism tradition, with historic arts and temples dedicated to it. Some significant artworks related to yoni include the Lajja Gauri found in many parts of India and the Kamakhya Temple in Assam. Both of these have been dated to the late 1st millennium CE, with the major expansion of the Kamakhya temple that added a new sanctum above the natural rock yoni attached to an older temple being dated to the 16th-century Koch dynasty period.\n\nThe Lajja Gauri is an ancient icon that is found in many Devi-related temples across India and one that has been unearthed at several archaeological sites in South Asia. The icon represents yoni but with more context and complexity. According to the Art Historian Carol Bolon, the Lajja Gauri icon evolved over time with increasing complexity and richness. It is a fertility icon and symbolizes the procreative and regenerative powers of mother earth, \"the elemental source of all life, animal and plant\", the vivifier and \"the support of all life\". The earliest representations were variants of aniconic pot, the second stage represented it as the three-dimensional artwork with no face or hands but a lotus-head that included yoni, chronologically followed by the third stage that added breasts and arms to the lotus-headed figure. The last stage was an anthropomorphic figure of a squatting naked goddess holding lotus and motifs of agricultural abundance spread out showing her yoni as if she is giving birth or sexually ready to procreate. According to Bolon, the different aniconic and anthropomorphic representations of Lajja Gauri are symbols for the \"yoni of Prithvi (Earth)\", she as womb.\n\nThe Lajja Gauri iconography – sometimes referred to by other names such as Yellamma or Ellamma – has been discovered in many South Indian sites such as the Aihole (4th to 12th-century), Nagarjunakonda (4th century Lajja Gauri inscription and artwork), Balligavi, Elephanta Caves, Ellora Caves, many sites in Gujarat (6th century), central India such as Nagpur, northern parts of the subcontinent such as Bhaktapur (Nepal), Kausambi and many other sites.\n\nThe Kamakhya temple is one of the oldest \"shakta pithas\" in South Asia or sacred pilgrimage sites of the Shaktism tradition. Textual, inscriptional and archaeological evidence suggests that the temple has been revered in the Shaktism tradition continuously since at least the 8th-century CE, as well as the related esoteric tantric worship traditions. The Shakta tradition believes, states Hugh Urban – a professor of Religious Studies primarily focusing on South Asia, that this temple site is the \"locus of goddess' own yoni\". \nThe regional tantric tradition considers this yoni site as the \"birthplace\" or \"principal center\" of tantra. While the temple premises, walls and mandapas have numerous depictions of goddess Kamakhya in her various roles, include those relating to her procreative powers, as a martial warrior, and as a nurturing motherly figure (one image near the western gate shows her nursing a baby with her breast, dated to 10th-12th century). The temple sanctum, however, has no idols. The sanctum features a yoni-shaped natural rock with a fissure and a natural water spring flowing over it. The Kamakhya yoni is linked to the Shiva-Sati legend, both mentioned in the early puranic literature related to Shaktism such as the \"Kalika Purana\".\n\nEvery year, about the start of monsoons, the natural spring turns red because of iron oxide and \"sindoor\" (red pigment) anointed by the devotees and temple priests. This is celebrated as a symbol of the menstruating goddess, and as the Ambubachi Mela (also known as \"Ambuvaci\" or \"ameti\"), an annual fertility festival held in June. During Ambubachi, a symbolic annual menstruation course of the goddess Kamakhya is worshipped in the Kamakhya Temple. The temple stays closed for three days and then reopens to receive pilgrims and worshippers. The sanctum with the yoni of the goddess is one of the most important pilgrimage sites for the Shakti tradition, attracting between 70000 to 200000 pilgrims during the \"Ambubachi Mela\" alone from the northeastern and eastern states of India such as West Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. It also attracts yogis, tantrikas, sadhus, aghoris as well as other monks and nuns from all over India.\n\nDarshan at this temple is performed not by sight as in most temples, but by touch. There is a large cleft, a yoni in the bedrock moistened by water flowing upward from an underground spring, generally covered by cloths and ornate chunris, flowers, and red sindoor powder. Devotees and pilgrims offer items for worship directly to the goddess, then touch her and drink water from the spring. They then receive a tilak and prasad by the attending priest. After completing darshan, devotees light lamps and incense outside the temple. Like other temples, worship is not considered complete until the temple is circumambulated clockwise.\n\nIn esoteric traditions such as tantra, particularly the Sri Chakra tradition, the main icon (yantra) has nine interlocking triangles. Five of these point downwards and these are consider symbols of yoni, while four point upwards and these are symbols of linga. The interlocking represents the interdependent union of the feminine and masculine energies for the creation and destruction of existence.\n\nYoni typically with linga is found in historic stone temples and panel reliefs of Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand. In Vietnam literature, yoni is sometimes referred to as \"Awar\", while the linga is referred to as \"Ahier\".\n\n\n"}
