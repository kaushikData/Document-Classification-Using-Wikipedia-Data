He was active in the region of Castile and León, primarily in the city of Valladolid.\n\nNothing is known about Amaya's origins and background, and little about his life and career. One modern Spanish source describes his life and activity as \"cubierta por una enorme bruma\" (\"covered by an enormous mist\"). The best that can be said is, that the surname \"Amaya\" is associated with the small village of Amaya in Burgos, Castile and León. Few of his paintings are dated, which makes it difficult to establish a chronology. Most of his works are on religious subjects, but he is said to have also painted portraits. His surviving works are scattered in and around Valladolid.\n\nAccording to Spanish art historian Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez (1749-1829), Amaya was a disciple of Vicente Carducho (1576/78–1638). Amaya cannot have been Carducho's pupil, because their dates do not overlap. It is possible that Amaya knew or was influenced by later Spanish painters of the Madrid high Baroque school, such as (after 1630 - 1677) and ( - 1684), and the court painters of the time. He has also been said to have been influenced by Alonzo Cano (1601-1667).\n\nIn 1687, Valladolid painter Amaro Alonso de Llanos (Amaro Alonso Méndez, 1640-1699) married Damiana Jalón y Gallo, widow of the painter Juan Sanz. Amaya was one of the witnesses. That is one of the very few contemporary records of Amaya's existence.\n\nHis wife was Isabel (). They lived \"outside the Puerta del Campo\"; that is, roughly in the area of the modern in Valladolid. Amaya died on 29 October 1704. The Valladolid painter Ignacio de Prado was his pupil; Amaya's widow called Ignacio \"una persona de mi cariño y de que tengo entera satisfacción\" (\"a person in my affection and in whom I have complete satisfaction\").\n\nCeán Bermúdez said of Amaya, \"tienen mejor gusto de color que correccion en el dibuxo\" (\"he had better taste in colour than in correctness of drawing\"). The one authority cited by Ceán Bermúdez was Antonio Ponz (1725–1792), who may only have known Amaya's altarpiece at . Spanish art historian (1935-2010) had a more generous opinion. So had the anonymous author who wrote for the Museo Nacional de Escultura, Valladolid in 2001, \"Fue artista bien preparada para la composición, mostrando gran habilidad en la angrupación y relación de las figuras\" (\"He was a masterful artist in composition, showing great skill in the grouping and relationship of people\").\n\nThese works have been attributed to Amaya:\n"}

Both his parents were natives of Lubao, Pampanga, and had migrated to Davao following the end of the Second World War to find better jobs.\n\nQuiboloy was a member of the United Pentecostal Church until he established the Kingdom of Jesus Christ church.\n\nQuiboloy is the founding leader and Executive Pastor of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, The Name Above Every Name founded on September 1, 1985. He began preaching in the slums of Villamor, Agdao, Davao City with only 15 members. He has received critical responses to his claims of being the \"Appointed Son of God\".\n\nThe sect's main Cathedral is located along Buhangin National Highway in Davao City.\n\nHis followers refer to their community as a \"Kingdom Nation.\" They claim about 2 million \"Kingdom citizens\" abroad and 4 million in the Philippines. On weekdays, members hold bible sessions and prayer services. On Sundays, a \"Global Worship\" is held at the Cathedral in Buhangin District.

{"id": "48055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48055", "title": "Argument from nonbelief", "text": "Argument from nonbelief\n\nAn argument from nonbelief is a philosophical argument that asserts an inconsistency between the existence of God and a world in which people fail to recognize him. It is similar to the classic argument from evil in affirming an inconsistency between the world that exists and the world that would exist if God had certain desires combined with the power to see them through.\n\nThere are two key varieties of the argument. The argument from reasonable nonbelief (or the argument from divine hiddenness) was first elaborated in J. L. Schellenberg's 1993 book \"Divine Hiddenness and Human Reason\". This argument says that if God existed (and was perfectly good and loving) every reasonable person would have been brought to believe in God; however, there are reasonable nonbelievers; therefore, this God does not exist.\n\nTheodore Drange subsequently developed the argument from nonbelief, based on the mere existence of nonbelief in God. Drange considers the distinction between reasonable (by which Schellenberg means inculpable) and unreasonable (culpable) nonbelief to be irrelevant and confusing. Nevertheless, the overwhelming majority of academic discussion is concerned with Schellenberg's formulation.\n\nThe theme of divine hiddenness, silence or darkness has a long history in Judeo-Christian theology. The roots of the Judeo-Christian description of God as hidden are in the Bible, for example in the Psalms, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?...I cry by day, but you do not answer...\", and in Isaiah: \"Truly you are a God who hides himself, O God of Israel, the Savior.\"\n\nOne of the first philosophers to write on the theme of divine hiddenness was Anselm of Canterbury, who in his Proslogion links it to an existential or spiritual concern:\nDaniel Howard-Snyder and Paul Moser, in the introduction to a volume of papers on the idea of divine hiddenness as evidence against theism, cite Nietzsche's question as anticipating this contemporary theme: \"a god who is all-knowing and all-powerful and who does not even make sure his creatures understand his intentions — could that be a god of goodness?\"\n\nDiscussion of Schellenberg's argument has made explicit a non-theological use of the term 'hiddenness', which is now commonly used simply as a way of talking about the subjective condition of nonbelief in God. In his first presentation of the argument Schellenberg emphasized inculpable or reasonable nonbelief, but he has since shifted to speaking more specifically about nonresistant nonbelief. The first presentation is often given by commentators as follows, based on Schellenberg's own summing up:\nSchellenberg has stated that this formulation is misleading, when taken on its own, because it does not make explicit the reason why a perfectly loving God would want to prevent nonbelief. His deepest claim, he says, is \"about the connection between love and openness to relationship -- a personal and positively meaningful and explicit sort of relationship of the sort that logically presupposes each party's belief in the other's existence.\" A later presentation of the argument by Schellenberg, which aims at accessibility for students, includes this element:\nIn an article revisiting the argument ten years after it was originally proposed, Schellenberg observes that criticism has mainly centered around the idea that God would prevent inculpable nonbelief. He asserts that there are relatively few criticisms questioning the existence of inculpable nonbelief, and almost no theistic philosopher objects to the idea that God is perfectly loving.\n\nSchellenberg says he hasn't seen any serious objections to this premise by theistic philosophers, but there certainly are other conceptions of God. Daniel Howard-Snyder writes about the possibility of believing in an unsurpassably great personal god that is nevertheless dispassionate towards its creatures. Drawing on the Stoic concept of Eudaimonia, he says one can think of a god more akin to a wise sage than the loving parent that Schellenberg envisions.\n\nTheodore Drange, in his attempt to improve the argument (see below), states that there are many theists who do not view God as perfectly loving, and \"some Christians think of him as an angry deity bent on punishing people for their sins.\" Drange concludes that the argument should be put forward only in relation to theists who already accept the first premise and believe in a god who is perfectly loving.\n\nMost theists, in fact, do admit that love is a central concept in almost all of the world's religions. God is often directly associated with love, especially with agape. Theologians such as N.T. Wright suggest that our experience of love is itself a proof of God's existence. However, there are a few others (e.g. Brian Davies in the Thomist tradition) who suggest that the modern interpretation of what it means to say God loves human beings is incorrect, and so that God is able to be loving in a sense while actually willing disbelief.\n\nWhen asked what he would say when facing God on judgment day, Bertrand Russell famously replied that he would say \"Not enough evidence, God! Not enough evidence!\" Some nonbelievers may have hidden from themselves what seems to them to be possible evidence of the divine, but the view of the hiddenness argument is that others have tried hard to believe in God. Schellenberg addresses this difference with his distinction between culpable and \"inculpable\" nonbelief, with the latter defined as \"non-belief that exists through no fault of the non-believer.\"\n\nHistorically, the Calvinist tradition has placed the blame on nonbelievers. Calvin's religious epistemology is based on the sensus divinitatis (Sense of Divinity), the view that the presence of God is universally perceived by all humans. Paul Helm explains, \"Calvin’s use of the term 'sense' signals that the knowledge of God is a common human endowment; mankind is created not only as capable of knowing God, but as actually knowing him.\" According to this tradition, there is no inculpable or nonresistant nonbelief. Jonathan Edwards, the 18th century American theologian, claimed that while every human being has been granted the capacity to know God, successful use of these capacities requires an attitude of \"true benevolence,\" a willingness to be open to the truth about God. Thus, the failure of non-believers to see \"divine things\" is in his view due to \"a dreadful stupidity of mind, occasioning a sottish insensibility of their truth and importance.\"\n\nIn modern times, there are fewer proponents of these views. One reason is that, as Stephen Maitzen argues, anthropology has long established that while religious belief in general is essentially universal, belief in what Calvin would recognize as God is very unevenly distributed among cultures (consider for example God in Buddhism, Jain cosmology, or non-theistic animism). If God exists, then why, Maitzen asks, does the prevalence of belief in God vary so dramatically with cultural and national boundaries? Jason Marsh has extended this kind of demographic challenge by focusing on human evolution and cognitive science of religion. Why is theistic belief apparently non-existent among early humans but common at later times, at least in some regions? According to Marsh, the hiddenness problem is harder to answer once we appreciate that much nonbelief is 'natural', owing to the kinds of minds people naturally possess and to their place in evolutionary and cultural history.\n\nAnother reason why many philosophers no longer attribute nonbelief to human sinfulness has to do with respect. In fact, modern critics, such as Howard-Snyder, who praised Schellenberg's book for being \"religiously sensitive,\" are similarly sensitive towards the nonbeliever. Howard-Snyder wrote:\n\nThe most serious criticisms of the hiddenness argument have been leveled against the idea that a perfectly loving God would prevent nonresistant nonbelief. Schellenberg argues in two steps, by first claiming that a loving God would enable humans to partake in a relationship with it, and then, assuming that belief in that god is a necessary condition for such relationships to occur, inferring that a loving God would not permit nonbelief. He states:\n\nHe justifies this claim by arguing that a conception of divine love can best be formed by extrapolating the best aspects of love in human relations, and draws an analogy with perfect parental love:\n\nBut, says Schellenberg, belief in God's existence is necessary for engaging in such a meaningful relationship with God. He therefore concludes that if there is a perfectly loving God, such creatures will always believe in it. He further argues that since belief is involuntary, these creatures should always have evidence \"causally sufficient\" for such belief:\n\nSkeptical theism is the view that we should remain skeptical of claims that our perceptions about God's purposes can reasonably be considered good evidence of what they are . The central thesis of skeptical theism is that it would not be surprising for an infinitely intelligent and knowledgeable being's reasons for permitting a perception of evil or alleged hiddenness to be beyond human comprehension. That is, what is perceived as hiddeness may be necessary for a greater good or to prevent equal or even greater evils.\n\nThe philosophers Michael Bergmann and Michael Rea described the philosopher William Rowe's justification for the second premise of the argument from evil, which is equally applicable to a perception of hiddenness:Some evidential arguments ... rely on a “noseeum” inference of the following sort: NI: If, after thinking hard, we can’t think of any God-justifying reason for permitting some horrific evil then it is likely that there is no such reason. (The reason NI is called a ‘noseeum’ inference is that it says, more or less, that because we don’t see ‘um, they probably ain’t there.)Various analogies are offered to show that the noseeum inference is logically unsound. For example, a novice chess player's inability to discern a chess master's choice of moves cannot be used to infer that there is no good reason for the move. The skeptical theist and noseum defense place the burden of proof on the atheist to prove that their intuitions about God are trustworthy.\n\nThis argument is sometimes seen as demanding God to prove his existence, for example by performing miracles. Critics have argued that even in Schellenberg's more refined version, the nonbeliever is imposing her own epistemological expectations on the will of God. A detailed discussion of these kinds of demands, and their moral and spiritual implications, is provided by Paul Moser, who says that such demands amount to cognitive idolatry. He defines idolatry as \"our not letting the true God be Lord in our lives\" and instead committing to something other than God by pursuing a quest for self-realization in our own terms. If this is idolatry in our actions, then idolatry in our knowing, he says, is as follows:\nSchellenberg considers this criticism irrelevant to the argument, which in his opinion, does not impose any demands for demonstrations of God's power, but rather looks for evidence that \"need only be such as will be causally sufficient for belief in the absence of resistance... This result might be effected through the much more spiritually appropriate means of religious experience, interpreted in the sensitive manner of a Pascal or a Kierkegaard.\" Schellenberg then expresses a certain frustration that theistic writers who otherwise extol the value of religious experiences deny non-theists the right to do so.\n\nJohn Hick used the term \"soul-making\" in his theodicy \"Evil and the God of Love\" to describe the kind of spiritual development that he believes justifies the existence of evil. This defense is employed by Michael Murray, who explains how, in his view, divine hiddenness is essential to soul-making. It may seem that it is not hard to imagine a world where God is known and yet believers act freely with ample opportunities for spiritual development. But Murray gives a deep and careful analysis of the argument, concluding that if God's existence were revealed in such a way as to remove reasonable non-belief, then \"any desire that we might have to believe or act in ways contrary to that which has been revealed would be overwhelmed.\"\n\nCritics note here that, for example, in Christianity (and even more in Judaism, where God is represented as talking to Job and explaining why he is just), God is already believed to have exposed himself very distinctly: for example to the Apostles who saw his resurrection. One theistic explanation of this might be that God knows some people wouldn't believe anyway but if God knows this before creating, there is a problem about God's liability for what is created. More fundamentally in relation to Murray's argument, there is the problem for orthodox believers of explaining the existence of Satan, a fallen angel who is obviously aware of God and yet, according to theistic scriptures, freely chose to rebel against God.\n\nAlvin Plantinga writes that the statement \"We can see no good reason for God to do X\" only implies \"There is no good reason for God to do X\" on the assumption that \"If there were a good reason for God to do X, we would be able to see it,\" which he suggests is absurd. This point might be applied to versions of the argument from nonbelief that suggest without support that there is no good reason for God to permit nonbelief.\n\nThis is the argument that all true atheists are at heart lying so that they may live in a way that is contrary to God's commands (as seen in particular interpretations of Romans 1:18-25). Critics note that there are atheists who are not lying and are not using their atheism as an escape to sin. Proponents note, however, that they could just as easily still be lying, perhaps not to others anymore but themselves (i.e. loving the wrong woman argument). Some have claimed this argument, however, fails to account for Stephen Maitzen's point on the demographics of theism. If all atheists are liars, why are people in some societies so much more likely to lie than in others? \nFinally, some have also claimed this argument fails to account for Jason Marsh's point on natural nonbelief in early humans. Since there was quite plausibly such a thing as natural nonbelief in early humans, then it doesn't make much sense to say that said nonbelief is self-deceptive. That's because natural nonbelief entails nonresistant nonbelief.\n\nTheodore Drange proposed a version of the nonbelief argument in 1996. He considers the distinction between culpable and inculpable nonbelief to be unhelpful in the argument, arguing instead that the mere existence of nonbelief is evidence against the existence of God. A semi-formal presentation of the argument is as follows:\n\n\nDrange's argument is directed primarily to Christians, and the philosopher Laura Garcia has replied from that perspective. She says that Drange's argument hinges on the idea that belief in God's existence is, according to Christians, necessary for salvation. According to Garcia this idea is mistaken: \"many Christians deny this claim and the Catholic Church explicitly rejects it.\" But as Garcia notes, Drange has answered that for many Christians—in particular, evangelical Christians—his point should remain convincing, and that there are in any case other good things that belief in God can bring for humans, which a good God would desire, such as peace of mind and a sense of meaning in life.\n\n"}

{"id": "82499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=82499", "title": "Asclepeion", "text": "Asclepeion\n\nAn asclepeion ( \"Asklepieion\"; Ἀσκλαπιεῖον in Doric dialect; Latin \"aesculapīum\") was a healing temple in ancient Greece (and Rome), sacred to the god Asclepius, the Greek god of medicine. These healing temples were a place where patients would visit to receive either treatment or some sort of healing, whether it was spiritual or physical.\n\nAsclepius may first have been worshipped as a hero in Trikka (modern Trikala), Thessaly, Greece. Ancient mythographers generally regarded Trikka as the place of Asclepius' birth, but to date archaeological excavations have yet to uncover his sanctuary there. Epidaurus, on the other hand, was the first place to worship Asclepius as a god, beginning sometime in the 5th century BC. The asclepieion at Epidaurus is both extensive and well preserved. There is also an asclepieion located on the south slopes of the Acropolis of Athens which dates to around 420 BC.\n\nStarting around 350 BC, the cult of Asclepius became increasingly popular. Pilgrims flocked to asclepieia to be healed. They slept overnight (\"incubation\") and reported their dreams to a priest the following day. He prescribed a cure, often a visit to the baths or a gymnasium. Since snakes were sacred to Asclepius, they were often used in healing rituals. Non-venomous snakes were left to crawl on the floor in dormitories where the sick and injured slept.\n\nAsclepeia included carefully controlled spaces conducive to healing and fulfilled several of the requirements of institutions created for healing. In the Asclepieion of Epidaurus, three large marble boards dated to 350 BC preserve the names, case histories, complaints, and cures of about 70 patients who came to the temple with a problem and shed it there. Some of the surgical cures listed, such as the opening of an abdominal abscess or the removal of traumatic foreign material, are realistic enough to have taken place, with the patient in a dream-like state of induced sleep known as \"enkoimesis\" (), not unlike anesthesia, induced with the help of soporific substances such as opium.\n\nPausanias remarked that, at the asclepieion of Titane in Sicyon (founded by Alexanor, Asclepius' grandson), statues of Hygieia were covered by women's hair and pieces of Babylonian clothes. According to inscriptions, the same sacrifices were offered at Paros.\n\nHippocrates is said to have received his medical training at an asclepieion on the isle of Kos. Prior to becoming the personal physician to the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, Galen treated and studied at the famed asclepieion at Pergamon.\n\nIn Greek mythology and religion, Asclepius was the Grecian God of Medicine, descended from Apollo and the Coronis. He received his name as a result of his birth in which his mother had to have her womb cut open in order for him to be birthed (now known as a cesarean section). Asclepius means \"to cut open\". According to Greek mythology, in his upbringing, he was taught the art of medicine by the centaur Chiron. Through his studies, he had become so deft at the art of medicine that he was able to return the living from the dead.\n\nThe symbol of a snake wrapped around a staff, which is seen throughout all medical infrastructures as well as the American Medical Association in modern times, is reminiscent of the staff that Asclepius carried.\n\nLocated on the Argolid plain of the east Peloponnese in Greece, Epidaurus was the main asclepion. The healing temple was named after Asclepius, the son of Apollo. At the Epidaurus, there were various people such as physicians and priests who would assist those who sought a session of healing from these professionals. Patients would come pay homage to the gods by making pilgrimages to the site, performing a prayer or a sacrifice, giving monetary gifts or even sleep at the temple. The Epidaurus also served as a sanctuary for those who were extremely ill. It was eventually expanded to a one hundred eighty-room institution to house the dying and women in labour during the Roman Empire.\n\nThere were two steps in order for a patient to be considered to be treated in the Asclepeion. The first of which is the Katharsis or purification stage. This is when a patient undergoes a series of baths and other methods of purging, such as a clean diet over a series of several days or purging their emotions through art. The patient would then make an offering such as money or a prayer to the temple, therefore to Asclepius. The priest of the temple then gives the patient a prayer in which it would ease the patient's mind and create a more positive outlook for them.\n\nAfterwards, comes incubation or dream therapy. This is the process in which patients would spend the night at the temple of Asclepius and during the night, they would be visited by a god.

The patient would then receive the proper treatment whilst in the dream or receive directions from Asclepius on what the necessary steps were to treat their ailment. If Asclepius did not visit the patient, when the patient wakes up, they will then tell their dream to a priest or a dream-interpreter and depending on the type of dream is the type of treatment that the patient will receive.\n\n\n"}

According to Arakanese chronology, the Barua Buddhists are the ancient peoples of Bangladesh who have lived there for five thousand years. They are commonly identified by their last name, \"Barua\".\n\nChittagong was formerly known as \"Chaityagrama\" \"town with Buddhist shrines\". It was a center of Mahayana Buddhism in the 10th century. Magh was the general term used for Buddhists; Barua's are also termed \"Rajbansi\" \"of royal descent\".\n\nThey insist that they came from the Aryavarta or the country of the Aryans which is practically identical to the country later known as Majjhimadesa or Madhyadesa in the Pali texts. Bengali speaking Barua people of Chittagong are all Buddhist by religion, unlike Assamese Barua of Assam. Barua came from \"Baru\" \"great\" and \"arya\", meaning \"noble ones\". \n\nA Magh king, Jaychand, ruled the Chittagong region in the 16th century.\n\nBauddha Dharmankur Sabha Buddhist religious organisation founded by Kripasharan Mahasthavir in Calcutta on 5 October 1892. Kripasharan Mahasthavir was its first president and Surendralal Mutsuddi its secretary. The journal of the Dharmankur Sabha, Jagajjyoti, edited by Gunalangkar Sthavir and Shraman Punnananda Swami, was first published in 1908. It was subsequently also edited by Benimadhab Barua.\n\nNoted scholar Dr. Benimadhab Barua(1888-1948), was born in 1888 in the village of Mahamuni under Raozan Thana, Chittagong. He was the son of Kaviraj Rajchandra Talukder. Benimadhab assumed the title of ‘Barua’. In 1913 he obtained MA degree in Pali from University of Calcutta. He also studied law at Calcutta City College and Calcutta Law College. He became one of the pioneers of revitalization of Buddhism in the Barua Community. Benimadhab joined Mahāmuni Anglo-Pāli Institution as headmaster in 1912. From 1913-14 he worked as a lecturer in the Pāli department of the University of Calcutta. He went to England on a government scholarship in 1914. He earned an MA in Greek and Modern European Philosophy from the University of London. In 1917 he was awarded a D.Litt. by the University of London. He was the first Asian to do so.[citation needed] After returning to India in 1918, Benimadhab rejoined Calcutta University and was promoted to professorship. He improvised the syllabus of the MA course in Pali, apart from his work in the departments of Ancient Indian History and Culture (1919–48) and Sanskrit (1927–48) in the same university.[1] \n\nAnagarika Dharmapala visited Chittagong in 1917 where he influenced a 9-year-old boy, who later became the well known Pali scholar Prof. Dwijendra Lal Barua.\n\n\n"}

But there is registry that some of them kept their Buddhist believes practicing discreetly, for example, the testimony of writer Jorge Cardona of Buddhist altars among Chinese merchants in the early 20 century Puntarenas. Another source of Buddhism in the country was the Theosophical Society, popular among important members of the economic and intellectual elite. Among the poets and theosophists that wrote Buddhist-influenced poetry are Roberto Brenes Mesén and José Basileo Acuña Zeledón. However one of the first Buddhist temples made in the country was the Casa Zen (Zen House) of Costa Rica created in 1974 with support of the Japanese government, followed by the first Dharma Center of Tibetan Buddhism of the Gelug tradition founded in 1989 after the Dalai Lama's first visit to the country. \n\nNowadays, it is also driven by the very minor presence of Buddhist missionary groups, such as Soka Gakkai International., which has establish a community center at San Jose. \n\nIn recent years there has been a tendency for growing dissatisfaction with Catholicism, the dominant religion. Some convert to other branches of Christianity, most notably Protestantism (with a growing number of Protestant churches throughout Costa Rica). But others stay as agnostics, atheists or \"free thinkers\". It is these latter groups, especially if already interested or practicing some form of meditation, that can become influenced or inspired by \"exotic religions\" (in Costa Rica) such as Buddhism and therefore convert to it, or adopt it as a philosophy.\n\nThe four traditional schools of Tibetan Buddhism are present in Costa Rica.\n\nThe best known and first group is the \"Asociación Cultural Tibetano-Costarricense\" (Tibetan-Costarrican Cultural Association), which was established in 1989 CE after the first visit of the XIV Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso in Latin America. Years later, in 2004 CE, the XIV Dalai Lama revisited Costa Rica. He gave some discourses, including one in the University of Costa Rica and took part in ecumenical activities that included Costa Rica's archbishop. The Dalai Lama's third visit planned for 2008 was cancelled after the Costa Rican government under Oscar Arias Sánchez renewed relations with the People's Republic of China over Taiwan, resulting in soured relationships with the Buddhist community and criticism from the opposition. Opposition leader Ottón Solís publicly supported the Dalai Lama and promise to name the National Stadium in his honor in case he won the presidency.\n\nThe ACTC runs the \"Thousand Eyes Compassive Buddha\" Dharma Center located in Barrio Amón, San José City. This center is of the Gelug tradition. There is also a Diamond Way Buddhist Center in Curridabat, San José (Karma Kagyu lineage) and a Lingmincha Center of the Nyingma-Bon tradition.\n\nThe Casa Zen of Costa Rica center is located in Santo Domingo, Heredia.\n\nThere are also temples of Theravada, Shaolin and a Chinese Buddhism Pagoda.\n"}

However, Caesarius of Arles and other churchmen deplored certain customs that from time to time seem to develop around the saints, such as the prolonged drinking of toasts, ostensibly in honor of the saint.\n\nThe historicity of some Christian saints has been treated skeptically by a number of academics, either because there is a paucity of historical evidence for their origins, or due to resemblances to pre-Christian deities and festivals.\n\nThe legend of Barlaam and Josaphat was derived, via Arabic and Georgian versions, from the life story of Siddartha Gautama, known as the Buddha. The king-turned-monk Joasaphat (Arabic \"Yūdhasaf\" or \"Būdhasaf\"; Georgian \"Iodasaph\") also gets his name from the Sanskrit Bodhisattva, the term traditionally used to refer to Gautama before his awakening.\nBarlaam and Ioasaph were placed in the Orthodox calendar of saints on 26 August, and in the Roman martyrology they were canonized (as \"Barlaam and Josaphat\") and assigned 27 November. The story was translated into Hebrew in the Middle Ages as \"Ben-HaMelekh ve HaNazir\" (\"The King's Son and the Nazirite\"). Thus the Buddhist story was turned into a Christian and Jewish legend.\n\nSaint Valentine's Day on 14 February, commemorates three separate martyrs named Valentinus. One is described as a priest at Rome, another as bishop of Interamna (modern Terni). Both apparently died sometime in the second half of the third century and were buried at different locations on the Flaminian Way. The connection of the saints' feast day with popular romantic customs arose in the Middle Ages, when it was commonly believed that half way through the second month of the year, the birds began to pair.\n\nAlfred Kellogg and Robert Cox, have claimed that the modern customs of Saint Valentine's Day originate from the Roman Lupercalia customs. But J. Hillis Miller and others find the hypothesis unconvincing: they say there is no proof that the modern customs of Saint Valentine's Day can be traced to the Lupercalia, and the claim seems to originate from misconceptions about the festivities. Jack Oruch says there is no written record of Gelasius ever intending a replacement of Lupercalia.\n\nChristians generally regard Easter as the most important festival of the ecclesiastical calendar. It is also the oldest feast of the Christian Church, and connected to the Jewish Passover. Many terms relating to Easter, such as \"paschal\" are derived from the Hebrew term for \"passover\". In many non-English speaking countries the feast is called by some derivation of \"pasch\". The English term, according to the Venerable Bede, is an Anglo-Saxon form relating to Ēostre, a Teutonic goddess of the rising light of day and spring.\n\nAccording to Hippolyte Delehaye, the Greater Litanies of the Feast of St. Mark (April 25) are a continuation and adaptation of the Roman agricultural festival, Robigalia.\n\n\"Hallowtide\", refers to the three days of Halloween, All Saints' Day, and All Souls' Day that are traditionally observed in Western Christianity from October 31 through November 2 as a commemoration of the dead.\n\nIn many early cultures, the day was considered to start at dusk. Similarly, in Celtic countries the year was considered to begin in winter at Samhain, and it was thought that the start of the year was a time when the world of the dead met that of the living; rather than a sinister event, this was considered a time when a feast should be laid on for the supposed temporary visit from the souls of the dead. The Orthodox tradition, deals rather with the zealous prayer for the dead, whom they believe are allowed to visit the living during 40 days after the moment of death, and always are greatly comforted and even saved from hell, through these prayers. In some Catholic traditions, the night is one when the graves of dead relatives are visited, with candles being lit, under a familiarly atmosphere, often including picnic; many historians argue that this is clearly derived from the pre-Christian events. The Christian festival was originally held annually on the week after Pentecost, and is still held at about this date by the Orthodox churches, but in western Europe, churches began to hold it at the same time as the pre-Christian festivals commemorating the dead, and it was eventually moved officially, by Pope Gregory III.\n\nChristmas on 25 December is, according to Christian tradition, a celebration of the birth of Jesus. Although there have been various folk suggestions regarding the origin of Christmas, the earliest historical source stating December 25 as the date of birth of Jesus was Hippolytus of Rome (170–236), written very early in the 3rd century, based on the assumption that the conception of Jesus took place at the Spring equinox which he placed on March 25, and then added nine months. There is historical evidence that by the middle of the 4th century the Christian churches of the East celebrated the birth and Baptism of Jesus on the same day, on January 6 while those in the West celebrated a Nativity feast on December 25 (perhaps influenced by the Winter solstice); and that by the last quarter of the 4th century, the calendars of both churches included both feasts.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2748607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2748607", "title": "Freedom of religion in France", "text": "Freedom of religion in France\n\nFreedom of religion in France is guaranteed by the constitutional rights set forth in the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.\n\nSince 1905 the French government has followed the principle of \"laïcité\", in which the State does not recognize any official \"religion\" (except for legacy statutes like that of military chaplains and the local law in Alsace-Moselle). Instead, it merely recognizes certain religious organizations, according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine. In return, religious organizations are to refrain from involvement in the State's policy-making.\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center in 2017, France has a high level of government restrictions on religion. Among the world's 25 most populous nations, France is among the 12 countries with a high level of religious restrictions, according to 2015 data. In Europe, France has the second highest level of religious restrictions, behind only Russia.\n\nFrench language terminology related to religion and freedom of religion differs somewhat from English. In particular, there are several misleading faux amis between French and English regarding religion:\n\nThe relationship between government and religious organizations in France is defined by the 1905 \"Law concerning the separation of the churches and the state\" (\"Loi concernant la séparation des Églises et de l'Etat\"). Its first sentence is, though:\n\nThe Republic assures freedom of conscience. It guarantees the free exercise of religious worship under the sole restrictions hereafter in the interest of public order. The Republic does not grant recognition nor pay nor subsidises any church. (\"La République assure la liberté de conscience. Elle garantit le libre exercice des cultes sous les seules restrictions édictées ci-après dans l'intérêt de l'ordre public. La République ne reconnaît, ne salarie ni ne subventionne aucun culte.\")\n\nThe 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which is considered by legal authorities to have equal legal standing with the Constitution of France, states:\n\nNo one may be questioned about his opinions, [and the] same [for] religious [opinions], provided that their manifestation does not trouble the public order established by the law.\n\nand:\n\nThe law has the right to ward [i.e., forbid] only actions [which are] harmful to the society. Any thing which is not warded [i.e., forbidden] by the law cannot be impeded, and no one can be constrained to do what it [i.e., the law] does not order.\n\nThus follows that the French government cannot arbitrarily regulate and prohibit religious activity; it is strictly constrained to regulate it only to the extent that there is a need to safeguard public order and prohibit actions harmful to society (such as, for instance, human sacrifices).\n\nThe French concept of religious freedom did not grow out of an existing pluralism of religions but has its roots in a history with Roman Catholicism as the single official religion and including centuries of persecution of people not endorsing it, or straying from the most official line, from the Cathars to the Hugenots and the Jansenists – this lasted until the French Revolution.\n\nFrench insistence on the lack of religion in all things public (\"laïcité\" or secularism) is a notable feature in the French ideal of citizenship. This concept of secularism, also plays a role in ongoing discussions about the wearing of scarves by Muslim women in public schools. In 2004, the French Parliament passed a law prohibiting the wearing of ostentatious religious garb in public primary and secondary schools; motivations included the tradition of keeping religious and political debates and proselytism out of such schools, as well as the preservation of the freedom of Muslim female students forced to wear certain costumes out of peer pressure. \"See French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools.\"\n\nThe French Republic has always recognised individuals rather than groups and holds that its citizens' first allegiance is to society in general and not to a particular group, religious or otherwise; the opposing attitude, known as \"communautarisme\", is generally considered undesirable in political discourse in France. On the other hand, the state sees that it is also responsible to protect individuals from groups rather than to protect groups, religious or others.\n\nApart from special cases due to historical circumstances (the local law in Alsace-Moselle and the military chaplaincy regimes), the French government is prohibited by law from granting official recognition to religion, and is also prohibited from subsidizing them or paying their personnel. However the government grants recognition to legal entities (associations) supporting religious activities. The difference is important, since the French government refuses to legally define what is a religion and what is not, and refuses to legally delimit the boundaries of religions. The state has a role in the appointment of bishops, directly in the case of Strasbourg and Metz, and indirectly (but with a rarely used power of veto) in that of other diocesan bishops. In consequence only suitable nationals are appointed and the episcopate does not reflect the ethnic diversity of practising Catholics in France.\nIndividuals organizing as groups with the exclusive purpose of worship (\"associations cultuelles\") may register as such and get significant tax exemptions set by law. Religious groups with non-worship (e.g. humanitarian) activities are free to get organized as associations with the usual tax exemptions granted to secular associations. These definitions are covered by an extensive body of jurisprudence (roughly, case law) which focuses on the activities of the groups from a financial point of view, and does, according to law, not take religious doctrine into account.\n\nThe population of France is roughly 50% Roman Catholic, 4–5% Muslim, around 3% Protestant, 1% Jewish, 1% Buddhist, 1% other denominations, and 40% not religious (with 30% of atheists). Church attendance is low among Catholics, and polls indicate that a significant proportion of the population is atheist or agnostic. Since the French government does not collect data on religious preferences, all quoted numbers should be considered with caution.\n\nSince the 1970s and 1980s, an increasing number of new religious movements have become active in France. Certain body of beliefs such as Scientology, the Children of God, the Unification Church, the Raëlism or the Order of the Solar Temple were listed by parliamentary reports as dangerous or criminal cults.\n\nOfficials and associations fighting excesses of such groups, justified these measures by the need to have appropriate legal tools and the need to fight criminal organizations masquerading as legitimate religious groups. Critics contended that those actions unfairly targeted minority religions, jeopardized freedom of religion, and were motivated by prejudice. The matters were made even more complex by the fact that some of the groups involved are based in the United States, where they actively lobbied the intervention of the government of that country.\n\nFrance, as well as other countries, was aware of various tragedies caused by groups labeled as \"destructive cults\" such as the People's Temple, the Branch Davidians and Aum Shinrikyo and the suicide murders of the Order of the Solar Temple which occurred in Quebec, Switzerland and France. Furthermore, some groups such as the Church of Scientology were accused of defrauding their members.\n\nThe population in general is not in favor of groups described as cults. In 2000, a representative 1000 person poll indicated that the majority of the polled people considered cults a significant threat to democracy (73%), their family and friends (66%), and themselves (64%) and 86% (76% of adherents of other religions than Catholicism) favored legislation restricting cults.\n\nLeaders of the French Protestant minority claim that freedom of religion was actually well protected in France and that cultural sensitivity and careful relationships with local authorities and other Christians could prevent most difficulties. \n\nSome groups have complained that, following from the publications of those reports and the enactment of the About-Picard law, they have suffered from discrimination by public authorities, private corporations and individuals.\n\nThe group \"Coordination des Associations et Particuliers pour la Liberté de Conscience\", founded in January 2002, requested:\nThis group, however, has been qualified by a 2005 OSCE report as a partisan organization whose \"allegations are essentially anonymous and thus of uncertain provenance and reliability.\"\n\nSome limited controversy occurred in France concerning alleged religious discrimination regarding the security measures that the French government has deployed for official visits of Chinese officials and for festivities organised in collaboration with China, including the exclusion of pro-Tibet and pro-Falun Gong protesters from the path of the Chinese officials. The International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights denounced the warm welcome of president Jiang Zemin in France, which it denounced as being motivated by economic prospects of trade with China.\nMany French politicians have denounced what they considered to be an over-zealous security apparatus in those visits. Similar controversial security measures have been implemented for the visit of former US president George W. Bush, another foreign head of state controversial in France.\n\nIn its 2000 annual report by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor of the U.S. Department of State, it was reported that \"The ensuing publicity [by the release of a parliamentary report against \"sectes\"] contributed to an atmosphere of intolerance and bias against minority religions. Some religious groups reported that their members suffered increased intolerance after having been identified on the list.\"\n\nIn its 2004 annual report by the same commission it reports that \"[...] official government initiatives and activities that targets \"sects\" or \"cults\" have fueled an atmosphere of intolerance toward members of minority religions in France. [...] These initiatives [the publication of reports characterizing specific groups as dangerous and the creating of agencies to monitor and fight these groups] and are particularly troubling because they are serving as models for countries in Eastern Europe where the rule of law and other human rights are much weaker than in France\".\n\nThey conclude with an assessment that since the restructuring of the main agency concerned with this issue (referring to the new MIVILUDES replacing its predecessor, MILS), have reportedly improved religious freedoms in France.\n\nIn its February 2004 statement, the commission recommended that the U.S. government urge the government of France to ensure that any state regulations on public expression of religious belief or affiliation adhere strictly to international human rights norms and that the French government and legislature should be urged to reassess their initiatives in light of its international obligations to ensure that every person in France is guaranteed the freedom to manifest his or her religion or belief in public, or not to do so.\n\nThe Commission went on by giving advice to the French government that it should start to tackle immigration issues, which have been a topic of hot political debate for the past 25 years:\nThe commission did not include France in their 2005 report.\n\nIn 2004, France passed a law banning the use of \"conspicuous\" religious symbols in public schools, including the hijab.\n\nMany Muslims complained that the law infringed on their freedom of religion. Similarly the Muslim Public Affairs Council called the ban \"a major affront to freedom of religion\", noting that many Muslims believe it is mandated by religious texts.\n\nHuman Rights Watch stated that the law is \"an unwarranted infringement on the right to religious practice\".\n\nThe United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, appointed by the US government, expressed concern for the law in its 2004 report. It stated that \"The French government's promotion of its understanding of the principle of secularism should not result in violations of the internationally recognized individual right to freedom of religion or belief.\"\n\nOn 14 September 2010, an act of parliament was passed resulting in the ban on the wearing of face-covering headgear, including masks, helmets, balaclava, niqābs and other veils covering the face in public places, except under specified circumstances. The ban also applies to the burqa, a full-body covering, if it covers the face.\n\nIt was reported that a set of rules including a ban on religious signs or symbols at civil marriages was introduced in the 9th and 10th arrondissements of Marseille. The mayor-council of Marseille did not support the ban.\n\nIn 1982 premier minister Pierre Mauroy requested a report on \"sectes\" which was delivered by Alain Vivien in 1983. The \"Rapport Vivien\" outlines problems of families, possible reasons for this sudden increase in such groups, sects as described by themselves and by others, the legal situation in France and abroad, and recommends some actions like education of children in the sense of laïcité, better information of the general public, mediation between families and adherents by a family court, help to French adherents abroad, attention on the rights of children. It concludes with the Voltaire quotation: \"Que chacun dans sa loi cherche en paix la lumière.\" (\"So that everyone within its law can search in peace for the light\")\n\nThe National Assembly instituted the first Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France in 1995, headed by parliament members Alain Gest and Jacques Guyard, following the mass suicide of adepts of the Order of the Solar Temple.\n\nOn March 21, 2000, the Justice Court of Paris found Jacques Guyard guilty of defamation for having called Anthroposophy a \"secte\" (\"cult\") practicing \"mental manipulation\". He was fined FF 20,000 and ordered to pay FF 90,000 to the anthroposophical Federation of Steiner schools. The Court stated that \"the investigation [of that parliamentary report] was not serious. It is proved that it only considered affidavits by alleged 'victims' of Anthroposophy but that neither the authors of these affidavits nor the alleged perpetrators were heard by the [parliamentary] commission\". The Paris judges also decided to strip Guyard of his parliamentary immunity in connection with this case.\" (Le Monde March 23, 2000)\n\nThe most controversial part of the report was the appendix, where a list of purported cults compiled by the general information division of the French National Police (\"Renseignements généraux\") was reprinted. It contained 173 groups, including Jehovah's Witnesses, the Theological Institute of Nîmes (a fundamentalist Christian Bible college), and the Church of Scientology. Although this list has no statutory or regulatory importance, it is at the background of the criticism directed at France with respect to freedom of religion.\n\nMajor concerns listed in these official reports and other discussions include:\n\nThe government of Alain Juppé created in 1996 the \"Observatoire interministériel des sectes\" (\"interministerial board of observation of cults\") which delivered yearly reports and out of which grew in 1998 the \"Interministerial Mission in the Fight Against Sects/Cults\" (MILS) headed by Alain Vivien. MILS was formed to coordinate government monitoring of \"sectes\" (name given to cults in France). In February 1998 MILS released its annual report. The activities of the MILS and Alain Vivien's background as the head of an anti-cult organization raised serious concerns and critiques from several human rights organizations and government bodies (See also About-Picard law#Reactions). In 1999, Vivien was put under police protection following threats and the burglary of his home (L'Humanité, January 14, 1999; ).\n\nVivien resigned in June 2002 under criticism from groups targeted by the Report on Cult activities. An interministerial working group was formed to determine the future parameters of the Government's monitoring of sects, called the \"Interministerial Mission for Monitoring and Combatting Cultic Deviances\" (MIVILUDES; official site).\n\nHeaded by Jean-Louis Langlais, senior civil servant at the Ministry of the Interior, MIVILUDES was charged with observing and analyzing movements that constitute a threat to public order or that violate French law, coordinating the appropriate response, informing the public about potential risks, and helping victims to receive aid. In its announcement of the formation of MIVILUDES, the Government acknowledged that its predecessor, MILS, had been criticized for certain actions abroad that could have been perceived as contrary to religious freedom. In an interview given in March 2003, Langlais emphasized that the issue at stake is not to fight \"sects\" as such but merely \"deviances\" these might have. However, he also admitted that it is difficult to define the concept of \"deviances\".\n\nIn May 2005 the former prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin issued a circular indicating that the list of cults published on the parliamentary report should no longer be used to identify cults.\n\nIn a number of cases, minority religious groups have litigated against the national or local governments, or against private organizations, which they deemed to have infringed on their rights because of religious prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Although its origins can be traced back to Hildegard of Bingen, it is mostly represented by Meister Eckhart, Johannes Tauler, and Henry Suso. Other notable figures include Rulman Merswin and Margaretha Ebner, and the Friends of God.\n\nThis movement often seems to stand in stark contrast with scholasticism and German Theology, but the relationship between scholasticism and German mysticism is debated. Viewed as a predecessor of the reformation, the contrast becomes very apparent. For example, the use of an approachable vernacular stands in stark contrast to the constrained Latin of the Scholastics, the increased focus on the laity stands in contrast to the more deeply sacramental understanding of the Church, and these elements are both taken up and transformed in the writings of Martin Luther. German mysticism can also be viewed as a practical application of Scholasticism. Though Meister Eckhart is most well known for his popular German sermons, he also wrote a lengthy philosophical exposition of the same teachings in Latin. Some scholars have read him as a rather orthodox Thomist, seeing his mysticism as flowing naturally from established teachings through Eckhart's own idiosyncrasies and exaggerations.\n\nSome of the movement's characteristics:\n\nSome in the movement came under criticism by the Church for heterodox or heretical opinions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2614335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2614335", "title": "Hadit", "text": "Hadit\n\nHadit (sometimes Had) refers to a Thelemic deity. Hadit is the principal speaker of the second chapter of \"The Book of the Law\" (written or received by Aleister Crowley in 1904). He may refer to the serpent Apophis, the Kundalini, and the atman. \n\nHadit identifies himself as the point in the center of the circle, the axle of the wheel, the cube in the circle, \"the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star,\" and the worshipper's own inner self. Hadit has been interpreted as the inner spirit of man, the Holy Ghost, the sperm and egg in which the DNA of man is carried, the Elixir Vitae. When juxtaposed with Nuit in \"The Book of the Law\", Hadit represents each unique point-experience. These point-experiences in aggregate comprise the sum of all possible experience, Nuith.\n\nHadit, \"the Great God, the lord of the sky,\" is depicted on the Stele of Revealing in the form of the winged disk of the Sun, Horus of Behdet (also known as the Behdeti). However, while the ancient Egyptians treated the Sun and the other stars as separate, Thelema connects the sun-god Hadit with every individual star. Furthermore, \"The Book of the Law\" says: \"Every man and every woman is a star.\" \n\nHadit is the Secret Seed. In \"The Book of the Law\" he says; \"I am alone: there is no God where I am.\". He is \"the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of every star.\". He is identified with kundalini; in \"The Book of the Law\" he says, \"I am the secret Serpent coiled about to spring: in my coiling there is joy. If I lift up my head, I and my Nuit are one. If I droop down mine head, and shoot forth venom, then is rapture of the earth, and I and the earth are one. There is great danger in me...\".\n\nHadit is the Fire of Desire at the Heart of Matter (Nuit). The combination of the upward-pointing triangle of Hadit and the downward-pointing triangle of Nuit forms the Star of Spirit (the Hexagram). The union of the infinitely small Hadit and the infinitely great Nuit causes an explosive rapture which leads to samādhi.\n\nThe earlier, Egyptian version, went by the name of Heru-Behdeti or Horus of Behdet (Edfu), Haidith in Greek. Thoth let him take the form of the solar disk to help a younger version of Horus—Re-Horakhty, or Ra-Hoor-Khuit—in a battle with Set and his army. Both versions of Horus appear in the Egyptian image that Thelemites call Stele 666, a Dynasty 25 or 26 offering stele formerly in the Boulaq Museum, but now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, also known as the Stele of Revealing. Around the time of its creation, Egyptian funerary teachings apparently included \"the new idea that the deceased could become one with the sun god, previously only a royal prerogative.\"\n\n\n\n"}

His son and Ignacio's father, Joaquín Baleztena Muñagorri, formed part of new Navarrese economic and political elites. Holding a number of rural properties in the comarca of Valles Meridionales, he was co-founder of Conducción de Aguas de Arteta and shareholder of a number of other local companies. Elected consejal of Pamplona in the 1880s and 1890s, he served as vicepresident of the local Circulo Carlista. Ignacio's mother, María Dolores Ascárate Echeverría, was descendant to a Carlist family; her father served as officer under Carlos V during the First Carlist War.\n\nIgnacio was born after the family had moved from Leitza to Pamplona. He received secondary education in the Piarist Colegio de los Escolapios and was raised, like his 8 siblings, in the fervently Catholic ambience. His older sister, María Isabel, was initially supposed to marry Juan Vázquez de Mella. His older brother, Joaquín, became the Carlist political leader in Navarre. His paternal cousins Arraiza Baleztena sympathised with Carlism and held different posts in the Pamplona ayuntamiento early 20th century. His younger sister Dolores was a Carlist activist and author. His younger brother, Pedro María Baleztena Ascarate, became a famous pelota player.\n\nMarried (1927) to Carmen Abarrategui Gorosábel, Ignacio fathered 10 children. Joaquín (Joaquíncho) was active in \"\"; Javier was director of Archivo General de Navarra and is author of historical and historiographical works related to the province, while Cruz Maria directed B-class movies. Most of the family remained Carlist, some of them engaged in politics. A few of his grandchildren became public figures; Ignacio Baleztena Navarrete represents Navarre at the EU headquarters in Brussels, Joaquin Baleztena Gurrea is a well known Pamplona physician while is a TV starlet and gossip media celebrity.\n\nAllegedly already as a child Ignacio took part in street protests against in the 1890s. He commenced his lifetime career as a youngster, co-organising and shaping various village feasts – especially the local santiburcios – in Leitza; in the family house he set up an amateur theatre, where he directed and performed along friends and relatives, staging also his own juvenile plays. He commenced studying law in the Jesuit Deusto college in Bilbao, but left to study architecture in Madrid and to continue with law in Salamanca; during his academic years Baleztena continued with cultural activities writing short stories and couplets, first for friends and than for public. Contributing with short pieces to various periodicals, during the Salamanca years he set up his own, \"El Bólido\". He completed his first academic curriculum in 1910, returning to Pamplona somewhat earlier. Became engaged in a number of Catholic initiatives aimed against , the most momentous having been the huge 1908 Gipuzkoan gathering known as acto de Zumárraga. The event was heavily influenced by the Carlists; as part of their preparations Baleztena wrote Spanish lyrics of a traditional Carlist anthem \"\", originally sung only in Basque. Also in 1908 he set up \"El Requeté de Pamplona\", a periodical intended for Carlist youth. In 1911 he was elected president of Juventud Jaimista in Pamplona, though his leadership style was peculiar, with special focus on zarzuelas, balls, juegos florales, historical re-enactments, spectacles and other carnivalesque performance genres. In 1914, having graduated in law from Salamanca, he was offered the job of personal secretary by his brother-in-law, the Spanish consul in Pau. Ignacio remained in the Spanish consular service in France until 1918.\n\nIn 1918 Baleztena joined the Carlist-foralist list of candidates in the local elections; successful, he became concejal of the Pamplona Ayuntamiento. One of his first initiatives was to create Caja de Ahorros de Navarra, an institution run by the and providing popular affordable credit. He made his name as a staunch advocate of traditional local legal establishments. During initial works on he co-founded Comité pro Autonomía and co-signed a proclamation, issued by Junta Gestora de la Juventud pro Navarra, demanding restoration of traditional Navarrese foral regulations. In 1921 he represented the Jaimistas in Alianza Foral coalition and was successfully elected to the Navarrese Diputación Foral. Re-elected in 1923 and 1926, he retained the post until 1928. Since 1925 he took part in talks between Diputación Foral and , though he demonstrated some flexibility when negotiating changes to the foral regime; in 1930 he formed part of the appointed Comisión Gestora. Baleztena kept endorsing a Navarrese identity also by other means, be it religious (San Francisco Javier commemorations), historical (unveiling of the in ) or scientific (opening a Navarrese section in Museum of Bayonne).\n\nBaleztena was vital to development and re-organisation of Archivo General de Navarra, the place where he spent more and more time as researcher starting late 1920s and which turned into his primary employment in the 1930s, when he was discharged from most other duties. In 1928 nominated the municipal Delegado de Turismo, resuming the function in the 1940s as Secretario del Comité Provincial de Turismo. In 1940 he founded Museo de Recuerdos Históricos in Pamplona, intended as Carlist cultural outpost; he was managing it as a director until the museum, due to run-down conditions of the building and amidst controversial circumstances, shut down in the mid-1960s. Since 1949 he was director of Museos de Navarra. Active in a number of mostly culture-related municipal and provincial bodies, like Comisión de Monumentos or Instituto Principe de Viana. By the end of his life he became an iconic and proverbial Pamplona figure, dubbed \"aitacho\".\n\nSince early youth Baleztena demonstrated particular interest in everything related to Giants and Bigheads; he was engaged in design, construction and carrying the figures. He later became an expert on gigantes, investigating their history and related rituals down to minuscule details. His interests gradually broadened to all Pamplonese feasts; in the 1920s he emerged as their key organizer and expert, publishing a number of related works and incalculable newspaper pieces. His contribution soon went far beyond cultivating local customs, as Baleztena was also reconstructing old-forgotten rituals and inventing new ones, incorporating them into celebrations of Epiphany, Holy Week or Corpus Christi; he launched also stand-alone customs like Procesión de San Saturnino. His activities went beyond Pamplona, as he revitalised local romerias, like the one to Ujué. All feasts contained a strong if not vital religious component, like the massive 1922 celebrations commemorating San Francisco Javier, styled as \"arquetipo navarro. Some were strongly flavoured by Carlism, like the annual pilgrimage to Javier, launched in 1939.\n\nBaleztena remained particularly fascinated by the sanfermines, investigating their history and forming part of Corte de San Fermín. He is credited for launching an unofficial feast anthem \"Uno de enero, dos de febrero\" and a popular \"Iruña-ko mezetak\" song, apart from a number of other unrelated chants. It was Baleztena and his friends who in 1911 first performed ; it remains debated whather the ritual was intended as a Carlist demonstration dogging the Liberal-dominated city council or simply as a juvenile joke. When it comes to running of the bulls he was in favor of as few regulations as possible, though none of the sources consulted mentions Baleztena running with the bulls himself. He remained one of key figures shaping sanfermines until the early 1960s, when he lost his grip on the event. The 1963-4 feasts were snatched by young Carlist progressists, who formatted them as their own political manifestations.\n\nBaleztena's interest in feasts and customs is peculiar as it combined three different approaches: this of a scientist (anthropologist, historian, ethnographer, who pursues impartial scholarly studies), this of a politician (who shapes popular customs as vehicles of propagating own set of values), and this of a participant (who genuinely enjoys the feasts, contributes to them and takes part in them). Some scholars classify his approach as \"costumbrismo nostálgico\", which exalted religiosity and viewed modernising changes with anxiety. Some consider it a strategy of disseminating authoritarian discourse, which by means of cultural identification mobilised the society along conservative lines, a process similar to those employed by the Nazis in the Weimar Republic. Some present it as means of maintaining traditional Navarrese identity.\n\nBaleztena's mothertongue was Spanish; he spoke Basque with some difficulty, though he understood Basque very well. Due to his childhood spent in Leitza, he was well accustomed and indeed fascinated by the Basque culture. Faced with the new phenomenon of Basque national drive, he opposed it with traditional vision of Basque identity; to this end, in 1913 he founded a \"Joshe Miguel\" weekly, intended as a Basque \"antieuzkadiano\" periodical. Baleztena early joined and formed part of its Junta Permanente; he participated in attempts to open Universidad Vasco-Navarra and remained active in Congresos de Estudios Vascos throughout the 1920s, promoting traditionalist Euskalerria against the nationalist Euzkadi. Baleztena opposed the usage of ikurriña as contrived and championed traditional provincial flags instead; he criticised newly invented feasts like Aberri Eguna, especially the 4th one staged in Pamplona.\n\nIn 1925 Baleztena co-founded Euskeraren Adiskideak, a society promoting Basque culture in Navarre. In 1931 he set up Záldiko Máldiko, a semi-private group focusing on folk dances and performing on festivals across Spanish and French Navarre. The grouping was re-formatted in 1934 as a Basque cultural folk association named Muthiko Alaiak, specialising in dance and theatric performances. Dominated by Carlists, Muthiko functioned as a vehicle for promoting Traditionalist vision of Navarrese society, though Baleztena did not refrain from mocking authorities (first Republican and later Francoist), especially by means of kurriños, performed often during local Carlist political events. After the Civil War Muthiko was considered the centre of antifrancoist Carlism. The group occasionally took part in official events, but it was registered as late as in 1949 and following continuous harassment, was re-opened in 1954. Though the last floor of the Baleztena house served as a stage for rehearsals, over time Baleztena lost control over Muthiko. As early as 1956 the communist intelligence considered the group a potentially promising area and indeed, in the 1960s it became a nucleus of socialism, which it remains until today, actively promoting also the Basque nationalism.\nSince early youth Baleztena was active in juvenile Jaimist organisations. In 1919 he took part in Magna Junta Carlista de Biarritz and set up a new Carlist weekly \"Radica\", representing the movement first in the Pamplona ayuntamiento and in the 1920s in the Deputación Foral. He considered taking part in \"controlled\" elections, planned by Berenguer in 1930. During first months of the Republic he forged a prior to the 1931 elections and engaged in works on . Initially in favour, he withdrew his support when governmental draft moved religious issues from autonomous to central portfolio. Member of the regional Carlist authorities, he got the family Pamplona house set ablaze by the leftist hit-squad in 1932. In 1933 he briefly headed the Navarrese Requeté.\nIn the spring of 1936 Baleztena negotiated Carlist support with Mola, within Carlism forming the faction pressing unconditional Carlist adherence to the coup. Upon the outbreak of hostilities the Baleztena houses turned into important insurgent centres. Ignacio helped to organise Tercio de San Miguel; in the mayhem that followed he is noted for saving Leftist supporters and POWs. Late July he volunteered to Tercio María de las Nieves battalion and served in Aragón, later on transferred to Tercio de Cristo Rey, deployed on the Madrid front and serving until the end of the war on the on-and-off basis. His stance towards is highly unclear, though it soon evolved into opposition; contesting Carlist amalgamation into Movimiento, he brusquely rejected Franco's blandishments. During the Second World War the Baleztenas helped the French refugees and demonstrated anti-Axis sympathies. They are usually considered members of the intransigent \"bando falcondista\", though Ignacio made also some conciliatory gestures towards Francoism. In the late 1940s the Baleztena brothers strived to rebuild clandestine or semi-official Carlist structures, both counted among Navarrese Carlist leaders. In 1952 Ignacio engineered one of the most humiliating snubs that Franco had to take. As late as 1954 he occasionally went into hiding, having been easy target of Falangist vengeance.\nThe Baleztenas voiced against a union with Juanistas, which did not necessarily amount to endorsing Don Javier's claim to the throne. In the mid-1950s they criticised Fal Conde as too conciliatory towards Francoism. Some scholars claim that they engineered a plot to remove Fal, though his actual dismissal and new course adopted by Carlism suited the competing \"unionistas\" faction more. When the hugocarlistas appeared on the scene in the late 1950s, the Baleztenas seemed rather skeptical. Though they lent some support to Carlos Hugo and maintained cordial relations with the Carlist claimant Don Javier until the late 1960s, they confronted the progressives when power struggle erupted within Carlism in the mid-1960s. The last success of the Baleztenas was regaining control over \"El Pensamiento Navarro\" in 1970, a short-lived victory as early 1970s Ignacio was expulsed from the socialist-dominated Partido Carlista.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15240", "title": "Imam", "text": "Imam\n\nImam (; '; plural: ') is an Islamic leadership position. \n\nIt is most commonly used as the title of a worship leader of a mosque and Muslim community among Sunni Muslims. In this context, imams may lead Islamic worship services, serve as community leaders, and provide religious guidance. \n\nFor Shi'a Muslims, the imam has a more central meaning and role in Islam through the concept of imamah; the term is only applicable to those members of \"Ahl al-Bayt\", the house of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, designated as infallibles.\n\nThe Sunni branch of Islam does not have imams in the same sense as the Shi'a, an important distinction often overlooked by those outside of the Islamic faith. In everyday terms, the imam for Sunni Muslims is the one who leads Islamic formal (Fard) prayers, even in locations besides the mosque, whenever prayers are done in a group of two or more with one person leading (imam) and the others following by copying his ritual actions of worship. Friday sermon is most often given by an appointed imam. All mosques have an imam to lead the (congregational) prayers, even though it may sometimes just be a member from the gathered congregation rather than an officially appointed salaried person. The position of women as imams is controversial. The person that should be chosen, according to Hadith, is one who has most knowledge of the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic tradition) and is of good character.\n\nThe term is also used for a recognized religious scholar or authority in Islam, often for the founding scholars of the four Sunni madhhabs, or schools of jurisprudence (\"fiqh\"). It may also refer to the Muslim scholars who created the analytical sciences related to Hadith or it may refer to the heads of Muhammad's family in their generational times.\n\nThe following table shows the considered imams in the context of scholarly authority by Sunni Muslims:\n\nThe Position of Imams In Turkey\n\nImams are appointed by the state to work at mosques and they are required to be graduates of an İmam Hatip high school or have a university degree in Theology. This is an official position regulated by the Presidency of Religious Affairs in Turkey and only males are appointed to this position while female officials under the same state organisation work as preachers and Qur'an course tutors, religious services experts. These officials are supposed to belong to the Hanafi school of the Sunni sect.\n\nA central figure in an Islamic movement is also called as an Imam like the Imam Nabhawi in Syria and Ahmad Raza Khan in India and Pakistan is also called as the Imam of Sunni Muslims.\n\nIn the Shi'a context, an imam is not only presented as the man of God \"par excellence\", but as participating fully in the names, attributes, and acts that theology usually reserves for God alone. Imams have a meaning more central to belief, referring to leaders of the community. Twelver and Ismaili Shi'a believe that these imams are chosen by God to be perfect examples for the faithful and to lead all humanity in all aspects of life. They also believe that all the imams chosen are free from committing any sin, impeccability which is called \"ismah\". These leaders must be followed since they are appointed by God.\n\nHere follows a list of the Twelvers imams:\n\nFatimah, also Fatimah al-Zahraa, daughter of Muhammed (615–632), is also considered infallible but not an Imam. The Shi'a believe that the last Imam, the 12th Imam Mahdi will one day emerge on Qiyamah.\n\nSee Imamah (Ismaili doctrine) and List of Ismaili imams for Ismaili imams.\n\nSee details under Zaidiyyah, Islamic history of Yemen and Imams of Yemen.\n\nAt times, imams have held both secular and religious authority. This was the case in Oman among the Kharijite or Ibadi sects. At times, the imams were elected. At other times the position was inherited, as with the Yaruba dynasty from 1624 and 1742. See List of rulers of Oman, the Rustamid dynasty: 776–909, Nabhani dynasty: 1154–1624, the Yaruba dynasty: 1624–1742, the Al Said: 1744–present for further information. The Imamate of Futa Jallon (1727-1896) was a Fulani state in West Africa where secular power alternated between two lines of hereditary Imams, or \"almami\".\nIn the Zaidi Shiite sect, imams were secular as well as spiritual leaders who held power in Yemen for more than a thousand years. In 897, a Zaidi ruler, al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya, founded a line of such imams, a theocratic form of government which survived until the second half of the 20th century. (See details under Zaidiyyah, History of Yemen, Imams of Yemen.)\n\nRuhollah Khomeini is officially referred to as Imam in Iran. Several Iranian places and institutions are named \"Imam Khomeini\", including a city, an international airport, a hospital, and a university.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3465357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3465357", "title": "Islamic adoptional jurisprudence", "text": "Islamic adoptional jurisprudence\n\nIslamic views on adoption are generally distinct from practices and customs of adoption in other non-Muslim parts of the world like Western or East Asian societies.\n\nRaising a child who is not one's genetic child is allowed and, in the case of an orphan, even encouraged. But, according to the Islamic view, the child does not become a true child of the \"adoptive\" parents. For example, the child is named after the biological, not adoptive, father. This does not mean adoption is not allowed. It means that the adopted child doesn't carry the same name as its adoptive parents. In Islam it is considered a blessing to take care of an orphan, in fact it is considered a duty to some. Thus many Muslims say that it is forbidden by Islamic law to adopt a child (in the common sense of the word), but permissible to take care of another child, which is translated into Arabic as (\"kafala\"). The adoptive child can become a mahram to his adopted family, if he or she is breast-fed by the adoptive mother before the age of two (see milk kinship). There can also be confusion between a child that has been orphaned and one who has been abandoned but is presumed to have living parents.\n\nA hadith involving Aisha and Abu-Hudhayfah ibn Utbah's adoptive son Salim mawla Abu Hudaifa states:\n\nThere is now some discussion about reconsidering some of the rules about Islamic adoptions. A groundbreaking study was done by the Muslim Women's Shura Council in August 2011 titled, \"Adoption and the Care of Orphan Children: Islam and the Best Interests of the Child\". This report examined Islamic sources and concluded \"adoption can be acceptable under Islamic law and its principle objectives, as long as important ethical guidelines are followed.\" The study represents a form of independent reasoning (ijtihad) and may raise some awareness and contribute toward shaping a future consensus (ijma) on the issue.\n\nIslamic law scholar Faisal Kutty argues that this report and a number of other developments in the area provide for some optimism that we may be at the cusp of a sea change in this area. Kutty argues that the belief that closed adoption, as practiced in the West, is the only acceptable form of permanent childcare is a significant obstacle to its acceptance among many Muslims. The situation is significantly different when we move to open adoptions, where there is not negation of the biological parentage. Kutty believes that there is sufficient basis in Islamic jurisprudence to argue for qualified support of adoptions and even international adoptions. He writes that it is undeniable that taking care of orphans and foundlings is a religious obligation and that the best interest of children has been a recurrent theme among the various juristic schools. Arguably one of the best ways to take care of these children is to place them in loving homes, provided that a child’s lineage is not intentionally negated or concealed. He argues that a reformed model of Islamic adoptions will enable Muslims to fulfill this religious obligation while ensuring that the most vulnerable do not fall through technical cracks and will not be negatively impacted by formal rules that no longer serve their intended purposes.\n\n\n"}

As such, religious pluralism goes beyond religious tolerance, which is the condition of peaceful existence between adherents of different religions or religious denominations.\n\nWithin the Jewish community there lies a common history, a shared language of prayer, a shared Bible and a shared set of rabbinic literature, thus allowing for Jews of significantly different world views to share some common values and goals.\n\nTraditionally, Jews believe that God chose the Jewish people to be in a unique covenant with God, described by the Torah itself, with particular obligations and responsibilities elucidated in the Oral Torah. Sometimes this choice is seen as charging the Jewish people with a specific mission — to be a light unto the nations, practice Tikkun olam and to exemplify the covenant with God as described in the Torah. This view, however, did not preclude a belief that God has a relationship with other peoples — rather, Judaism held that God had entered into a covenant with all humankind, and that Jews and non-Jews alike have a relationship with God. Each nation with its own unique relationship with God.\n\nBiblical references as well as rabbinic literature support this view: Moses refers to the \"God of the spirits of all flesh\" (), and the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) also identifies prophets outside the community of Israel. Based on these statements, some rabbis theorized that, in the words of Nathanel ben Fayyumi, a Yemenite Jewish theologian of the 12th century, \"God permitted to every people something he forbade to others...<nowiki>[and]</nowiki> God sends a prophet to every people according to their own language.\"(Levine, 1907/1966) The Mishnah states that \"Humanity was produced from one man, Adam, to show God's greatness. When a man mints a coin in a press, each coin is identical. But when the King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, creates people in the form of Adam not one is similar to any other.\" (Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5) The Mishnah continues, and states that anyone who kills or saves a single human life, Jewish or not-Jewish, has killed or saved an entire world. The Tosefta, a supplement to the Mishnah, states: \"Righteous people of all nations have a share in the world to come\" (Tosefta Sanhedrin 13:1; Sanhedrin 105a; also Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Teshuvah 3:4). The Midrash adds: \"-Why does the Holy One, blessed be He, love the righteous? Because righteousness is not due to inheritance or family connections... If a man wants to become a Kohen or a Levite, he cannot. Why? Because his father was neither a Kohen nor a Levite. However, if someone wants to become righteous, even if he is a gentile, he can, because righteousness is not inherited. [Numbers Rabbah 8:2]\n\nAccording to the Talmud, the seven Noahide Laws are;\n\nAny person who lives according to these laws is known as \"The righteous among the gentiles\". Maimonides states that this refers to those who have acquired knowledge of God and act in accordance with the Noahide laws. In the 2nd century a sage in the Tosefta declared \"the righteous of all nations have a share in the world to come.\" (Tosefta, Sanhedrin 13)\n\nProphets of the Bible, while they repeatedly denounced the evils of the idolatrous nations (in addition to their denouncing the Jews' sins), they never call the nations to account for their idolatrous \"beliefs\" (i.e. worshiping multiple deities), but only for their evil \"actions\" (such as human sacrifice, murder, and miscarriages of justice). .\n\nThe Jerusalem Talmud, Tractate Peah, states:\n\n\"כתיב ומשפט ורב צדקה לא יענה אין הקב\"ה משהא מתן שכרן של עושה מצות בגוי\"\n\n\"It is written, \"Justice and abundant righteousness he does not withhold\". [from here we see] God does not hold back from a non-Jew who does mitzvot.\n\nSome rabbis in the Talmud view Christianity as a form of idolatry, and therefore prohibited not only to Jews, but to gentiles as well. Rabbis with these views did not claim that it was idolatry in the same sense as pagan idolatry in Biblical times, but that it relied on idolatrous forms of worship (i.e. to a Trinity of gods and to statues and saints) (see Babylonian Talmud Hullin, 13b). Other rabbis disagreed, and do not hold it to be idolatry for gentiles (see Tosafot on Babylonian Talmud Avodah Zarah 2a). The dispute continues to this day. (Jacob Katz, \"Exclusiveness and Tolerance\", Oxford Univ. Press, 1961, Ch.10)\n\nMaimonides, one of Judaism's most important theologians and legal experts, explained in detail why Jesus was wrong to create Christianity and why Muhammad was wrong to create Islam; he laments the pains Jews have suffered in persecution from followers of these new faiths as they attempted to supplant Judaism (in the case of Christianity, called Supersessionism). However, Maimonides then goes on to say that both faiths can be considered a positive part of God's plan to redeem the world.\n\nThe above paragraph was often censored from many printed versions where Christian censorship was felt.\n\nConservative, Reform, Reconstructionist, and a few Modern Orthodox rabbis engage in interfaith religious dialogue, while most Orthodox rabbis do not.\n\nRabbi Lord Immanuel Jakobovits, former Chief Rabbi of the United Synagogue of Great Britain, describes a commonly held Jewish view on this issue: \"Yes, I do believe in the Chosen people concept as affirmed by Judaism in its holy writ, its prayers, and its millennial tradition. In fact, I believe that every people - and indeed, in a more limited way, every individual - is \"chosen\" or destined for some distinct purpose in advancing the designs of Providence. Only, some fulfill their mission and others do not. Maybe the Greeks were chosen for their unique contributions to art and philosophy, the Romans for their pioneering services in law and government, the British for bringing parliamentary rule into the world, and the Americans for piloting democracy in a pluralistic society. The Jews were chosen by God to be 'peculiar unto Me' as the pioneers of religion and morality; that was and is their national purpose.\"\n\nThe German-Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn (1729–1786) taught that \"According to the basic principles of my religion I am not to seek to convert anyone not born into our laws...We believe that the other nations of the Earth are directed by God to observe only the law of nature and the religion of the Patriarchs...I fancy that whosoever leads men to virtue in this life cannot be damned in the next.\"\n\nAccording to the Jewish Encyclopedia article on Gentile: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah, Rabbi Jacob Emden (1697–1776) claimed: \n\nIn practice, the predominant position of Modern Orthodoxy on this issue is based on the position of Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik in an essay entitled \"Confrontation\". He held that Judaism and Christianity are \"two faith communities (which are) intrinsically antithetic\". In his view \"the language of faith of a particular community is totally incomprehensible to the man of a different faith community. Hence the confrontation should occur not at a theological, but at a mundane human level... the great encounter between man and God is a holy, personal and private affair, incomprehensible to the outsider...\" As such, he ruled that theological dialogue between Judaism and Christianity was not possible.\n\nHowever, Soloveitchik advocated closer ties between the Jewish and Christian communities. He held that communication between Jews and Christians was not merely permissible, but \"desirable and even essential\" on non-theological issues such as war and peace, the war on poverty, the struggle for people to gain freedom, issues of morality and civil rights, and to work together against the perceived threat of secularism.\n\nAs a result of his ruling, Orthodox Jewish groups did not operate in interfaith discussions between the Roman Catholic Church and Jews about Vatican II, a strictly theological endeavour. However, the Rabbinical Council of America (RCA), with Soloveitchik's approval, then engaged in a number of interfaith dialogues with both Catholic and Protestant Christian groups.\n\nSoloveitchik understood his ruling as advising against purely theological interfaith dialogue, but as allowing theological dialogue as part of a greater context. Bernard Rosensweig (former President of the RCA) writes \"The RCA remained loyal to the guidelines which the Rav had set down [concerning interfaith dialogue] and distinguished between theological discussions and ethical-secular concerns, which have universal validity. Every program involving either Catholic or Protestant churches in which we participated was carefully scrutinized... Every topic which had possible theological nuances or implications was vetoed, and only when the Rav pronounced it to be satisfactory did we proceed to the dialogue.\"\n\nThe basis for Soloveitchik's ruling was not narrowly legal, but sociological and historical. He described the traditional Jewish–Christian relationship as one of \"the few and weak vis-à-vis the many and the strong\", one in which the Christian community historically denied the right of the Jewish community to believe and live in their own way. His response was written in the light of past Jewish-Christian religious disputations, which traditionally had been forced upon the Jewish community. Those had as their express goal the conversion of Jews to Christianity. As recently as the 1960s many traditional Jews still looked upon all interfaith dialogue with suspicion, fearing that conversion may be an ulterior motive. This was a reasonable belief, given that many Catholics and most Protestants at the time in fact held this position. Reflecting this stance, Rabbi Soloveitchik asked the Christian community to respect \"the right of the community of the few to live, create and worship in its own way, in freedom and with dignity.\"\n\nMany traditional rabbis agree; they hold that while cooperation with the Christian community is of importance, theological dialogue is unnecessary, or even misguided. Rabbi Eliezer Berkovits writes that \"Judaism is Judaism because it rejects Christianity, and Christianity is Christianity because it rejects Judaism.\" (Disputation and Dialogue: Readings in the Jewish Christian Encounter, Ed. F.E. Talmage, Ktav, 1975, p. 291.)\n\nIn later years Solovetichik's qualified permission was interpreted more and more restrictively. (Tradition:A Journal of Orthodox Thought, Vol. 6, 1964) Today many Orthodox rabbis use Soloveitchik's letter to justify having no discussion or joint efforts with Christians.\n\nIn contrast, some Modern Orthodox rabbis such as Eugene Korn and David Hartman hold that in some cases, the primary issue in \"Confrontation\" is no longer valid; some Christian groups no longer attempt to use interfaith dialogue to convert Jews to Christianity. They believe that the relationship between Judaism and Christianity has reached a point where Jews can trust Christian groups to respect them as equals. Further, in most nations it is not possible for Jews to be forced or pressured to convert, and many major Christian groups no longer teach that the Jews who refuse to convert are damned to hell.\n\nIn non-Orthodox denominations of Judaism most rabbis hold that Jews have nothing to fear from engaging in theological dialogue, and may have much to gain. Some hold that in practice Soloveitchik's distinctions are not viable, for any group that has sustained discussion and participation on moral issues will implicitly involve theological discourse. Thus, since informal implicit theological dialogue will occur, one might as well admit it and publicly work on formal theological dialogue.\nOn December 3rd 2015, the Center for Jewish-Christian Understanding and Cooperation (CJCUC) spearheaded a petition of orthodox rabbis from around the world calling for increased partnership between Jews and Christians.\nThe unprecedented Orthodox Rabbinic Statement on Christianity, entitled \"To Do the Will of Our Father in Heaven: Toward a Partnership between Jews and Christians\", was initially signed by over 25 prominent Orthodox rabbis in Israel, United States and Europe and now has over 60 signatories.\n\nOn August 31st 2017, representatives of the Conference of European Rabbis, the Rabbinical Council of America, and the Commission of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel issued and presented the Holy See with a statement entitled \"Between Jerusalem and Rome\". The document pays particular tribute to the Second Vatican Council’s Declaration \"Nostra Aetate\", whose fourth chapter represents the Magna Charta of the Holy See's dialogue with the Jewish world. The Statement \"Between Jerusalem and Rome\" does not hide the theological differences that exist between the two faith traditions while all the same it expresses a firm resolve to collaborate more closely, now and in the future.\n\nConservative Rabbi Robert Gordis wrote an essay on \"Ground Rules for a Christian Jewish Dialogue\"; in all Jewish denominations, one form or another of these rules eventually became more or less accepted by parties engaging in Jewish-Christian theological dialogue.\n\nRobert Gordis held that \"a rational dialogue conducted on the basis of knowledge and mutual respect between the two components of the religio-ethical tradition of the Western world can prove a blessing to our age.\" His proposed ground rules for fair discussion are:\n\nGordis calls on Jews to \"see in Christian doctrine an effort to apprehend the nature of the divine that is worthy of respect and understanding\" and that \"the dogmas of the Christian church have expressed this vision of God in terms that have proved meaningful to Christian believers through the centuries.\" He calls on Jews to understand with tolerance and respect the historical and religious context which led Christians to develop the concepts of the Virgin Birth, the Incarnation, the Passion, and the Resurrection, even if Jews themselves do not accept these ideas as correct. Similarly, Gordis calls on Christians to understand with tolerance and respect that Jews do not accept these beliefs, since they are in contradiction to the Jewish understanding of the unity of God. (Source: \"The Root and the Branch\", Chapter 4, Robert Gordis, Univ. of Chicago Press, 1962)\n\nRecently, over 120 rabbis have signed the Dabru Emet (\"Speak the Truth\"), a document concerning the relationship between Judaism and Christianity. While affirming that there are substantial theological differences between the two religions, the purpose of Dabru Emet is to point out common ground. It is not an official document of any of the Jewish denominations per se, but it is representative of what many Jews feel. Dabru Emet sparked a controversy in segments of the Jewish community. Many Jews disagree with parts of it for a variety of reasons.\n\nMany Muslim and Jewish groups and individuals have together created projects working for peace among Israelis and Arabs, most of which have as one of their goals overcoming religious prejudice.\n\nThe viewpoint of Conservative Judaism is summarized in \"Emet Ve-Emunah: Statement of Principles of Conservative Judaism\". This official statement holds that\n\nA small number of modern Jewish theologians, such as Yehezkel Kaufman and Rabbi Joseph H. Hertz, have suggested that perhaps only the Israelites were forbidden to worship idols, but perhaps such worship was permissible for members of other religions. (Yehezkel Kaufman, \"The Religion of Israel\", Univ. of Chicago Press, 1960; J. H. Hertz, \"Pentateuch and Haftorahs\" Soncino Press, 1960, p. 759). Most Jewish theologians disagree, saying that the original meaning of the text was to condemn idolatry in total. However, a growing number of Jewish theologians question whether Hindus and Buddhists today should be considered idolaters in the Biblical sense of the term. Their reasons are that modern day Buddhists, Hindus and others (a) do not literally worship \"sticks and stones\", as the idolaters in the Tanakh were described doing. Their beliefs have far more theological depth than ancient pagans, and they are well aware that icons they worship are only symbols of a deeper level of reality (though the same can be said of modern-day pagans), (b) they do not practice child sacrifice, (c) they are of high moral character, and (d) they are not anti-Jewish. Some Jews argue that God has a relationship with all gentile monotheists (or perceived monotheists), including Hindus, who in the past may have been (mis)interpreted as having a polytheist faith (see also Hindu views on monotheism), as well as with members of other religions such as Buddhism.\n\nThe article on Relationships between Jewish religious movements describes how the different Jewish denominations view each other and interact with each other.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "32711277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32711277", "title": "Kadambas of Halasi", "text": "Kadambas of Halasi\n\nThe Kadambas of Halasi was a South Indian dynasty during the Late Classical period on the Indian subcontinent, which originated in the region of Halasi, Karnataka; who were known for their own style of temple building. The Kadamba dynasty was founded by Mayurasharma in about 4th century AD. It was believed that Mayura was the first king of the dynasty and was the ruler during the time of Pallava King Vishnugopa of Kanchipuram. After losing to North Indian Emperor Samudragupta, Vishnugopa’s army had weakened. Mayura seized the opportunity, formed his own army and drove away the Pallavas from Kannada territory. On reaching \"Chandravalli\" (near Chitradurga), Mayura took shelter in a cave and founded his own dynasty. Banavasi, near Sirsi, was their first capital and their rule extended to Gomantak or present day Goa.\n\nHalasi (Halsi or Halshi) is one of the ancient towns in Belgaum district. It was Second capital of early Kadambas and a minor capital (during 980 AD - 1250 AD) under later Kadambas. where there are \"Bhoo Varaha Narasimha temple, Suvarneshwara temple, Kapileshwar temple, Hatakeshwara temple, Kalmeshwara temple, Gokarneshwara temple and a Jain basadi\" built by the Kadamba rulers.\n\nHalasi was a centre of confluence of Jainism, Vaishnavism and Shaivism during early Kadambas. It was headquarters of \"Halasige-12,000\" province including parts of Belgaum District, Dharwad District and Haveri District.\n\nKadambas ruled Goa, Halasi as Capital.\n\nFull scale excavations at Halasi and \"Gudnapur\" are bound to yield the brick temples of this early period. That would, show the contribution of the Kadambas of Banavasi to the Jaina architecture of Karnataka. The existence of Jaina temples during the period of the Banavasi Kadambas is amply evidenced by their epigraphs.\n\nAll the inscriptions mention gifts for worship and repair to Jaina temples. However, many of them refer to a Jaina temple at Halasi. The Jaina temple now standing at Halasi can be dated from no earlier than the 11th century A.D. As to the basadis referred to in the inscriptions, perhaps they might have been built of perishable wood.\n\nThe earliest references to a grant by a Kadamba king to a Jaina saint is found in the Halasi copper plate of Kakusthavarma. It mentions that the granted village Khatagrama belonged to arhanta. However, a reference to a Jain temple (Chaityalaya) is found in the Devagiri copper plate of \"Mrigesavarma\". The inscription states that Mrigesavarma gave a grant for the sammarjana, upalepana, archana and bhagnasamskara of the Chaityalaya located at \"Brihatparalur\". Further he also donated for the enclosure of the Chaityalaya one nivartana of land. This clearly shows that the above Chaityalaya was big enough to have an enclosure also. In the Devagiri inscription of \"Vijaya Siva Mrigesavarma\" a reference is made to arhat sale where an image of Jinendra was kept. Mrigesavarma's Halasi inscription of 8th regnal year states that the king built a Jinalaya in memory of his father in \"Palasika\" and granted lands to saints of \"Yapaniya, nirgrantha and kurchaka sangha\". Ravivarma's eleventh regnal year inscription found at Halasi refers to a grant for the abhisheka of Jinendra. Obviously this refers to a Jaina temple. Another inscription of the same king refers to the worship of Jinendra for which four nivartanas of land was granted .\n\nThe Halasi inscription of Ravivarma refers to interesting information. It states that the income from the gifted village should be used for eight-day festival in Kartikamasa in the Jinalaya at \"Palasikanagara\". It states at the end wherever Jinendra worship takes place properly, that place will prosper without any fear from enemies and the prowess of the king will improve. The Devagiri plates of prince Devavarma refers to gifts for the worship in the Chaityalaya and for the repairs of the Chaityalaya.\n\nThe famous \"Gudnapur inscription of Ravivarman\" is more explicit on this point. According to this inscription King Ravivarma built a temple, Kamajinalaya for Manmatha, very near the palace (rajavesma) and arranged for its worship by granting lands. At the same time he also gave grants to Kamajinalaya at Hakinipalli and Padmavati temple at \"Kalliligrama\".\n\nAccording to \"Dr. B.R. Gopal\" who has edited this inscription has suggested that this Kamajinalaya is a temple for Bahubali, as Bahubali is described as Manmatha. If this is so, the tradition of erecting gommata sculptures dates from the period of Kadambas and to sixth century A.D.\n\n\"Dr. A. Sundara\" has discovered a sculpture of Rati and Manmatha at the same place. Whether this was the sculpture worshipped in the Kamajinalya is uncertain. What is more important is the tradition of building Jaina temples for Manmatha and Padmavati.\n\nAccording to A. Sundara's field work at Halasi throws very important light on this point. Very close to the \"Kallesvara temple at Halasi\", he discovered an ancient site dates from the megalithic and early historic periods. A large number of brick walls of the ancient period have been noticed by him in and around and he thinks that this represents the Jaina temple built during the Kadamba period.\n\nIn the Mrigesavarman of Kadambas of Palasika (AD 475-490) inscription mention about Yapaniya.\n\n"}

The principle goal of such works \"is to offer to the reader a moral portrait and information on the noble actions of the individuals who constitute their subject or on the superior merits of a certain group\". Such texts are valuable sources for the socio-political and religious history of early and medieval Islam.\n\nThe usage of the word \"manāqib\" has varied over time and from one author to another, which is reflected in medieval Arabic scholarship by diverse opinons about the word's etymological meaning. The main possible explanations are:\n\n\nBecause the term \"manāqib\" came to be closely associated with sufi saints, it later also came to mean \"miracles\".\n\nLike many genre terms, the term \"manāqib\" is not neatly defined, and the usage of the term overlaps with a wide range of other Arabic genre terms. Some are fairly neutral in tone: \"tarjama\" (\"biography\"), \"taʿrīf\" (\"history\"), \"akhbār\" (collections of historical traditions), \"sīra\" (\"biographies of prophets\"). Others are more expressive: \"faḍāʾil\"  (“virtues”), \"maʾāt̲h̲ir\" and \"mafākhir\" (“exploits”), and \"akhlāq\" (apparently synonymous with \"manāqib\").\n\nThe earliest texts labelled as \"manāqib\" have generally not survived, and their existence is known only from bibliographic lists made by medieval scholars.\n\nFrom the 4th/10th century onwards, \"manāqib\" were produced focusing on biographies of the imams (\"madhāhib\") who founded different schools of Islamic thought (\"madhhab\") about \"shariʿa\", primarily: Abū Ḥanīfa (d. ca. 150/767), al-Awzāʿī (d. 157/774), Mālik b. Anas (d. 178/795), al-S̲h̲āfiʿī (d. 204/820), and Aḥmad b. Ḥanbal (d. 241/355). These were intended to edify the communities associated with these schools of thought, encouraging people to emulate their founders' (supposed) virtues. The fashion extended to biographical dictionaries of the disciples of each school, and sometimes biographies of particular disciples, primarily: Ibn Taymiyya (d. 728/1328), Saḥnūn (d. 240/854), al-Ḳābisī (d. 403/1012), and Abū Bakr Aḥmad ibn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān (d. 432 or 435/1040-3).\n\nFrom this time too, however, \"manāqib\" were increasingly produced in praise of people who achieved the status of saints in some varieties of Islam, distinguished particularly by their (supposed) miracles. This trend pertained particularly to the Maghrib, with key subjects of \"manāqib\" including: Abū Yazīd (d. 336/947), al-Rabīʿ ibn al-Qaṭṭān (d. 334/946), al-Mammasī (d. 333/944), al-Sabāʾī (d. 356/966), al-Jabanyānī (d. 369/979), and the patron saint of Tunis, Sīdī Maḥrez (d. 413/1022). The genre then spread to Arab Africa more generally and onto the Turkic- and Persian-speaking worlds. Production of such texts declined around the seventeenth century CE.\n\n"}

It is situated along the \"Kallar Syedan\" Road.\n\nThe town is said to be named after \"Raja Man\" or \"Manik\", who is said to have built the village's stupa during the Buddhist era. \n\nThe village is said to have been previously known as \"Manikpur\" or \"Maniknagar\", and was capital of the ancient Hindu \"Rakshasas\". However, archaeological evidence does not support the conclusion that Manikpur was the capital of the \"Rakshasas\", and that the village's ruins were built during the Buddhist-era.\n\nMankiala Stupa is a Gandhara era stupa built in the nearby village of Tope Mankiala to memorialize the place where, according to legend, Buddha sacrificed some of his body parts to feed seven hungry tiger cubs.\n\nMankiala dates from the Gandharan era, around 2000 years ago. The village had been previously described as the former grand capital of the mythological \"Rakshasas\", though no archaeological evidence supports the theory of Mankiala serving as an ancient Hindu capital, and instead suggests that the area's ruins date from the Buddhist period. The settlement during the Buddhist era may have consisted of approximately 2,000 homes, interspersed with monasteries and 15 stupas. The archaeological site is believed to be on the same hillock where the modern village now stands. \n\nMankiala's stupa was built in the reign of Kanishka (128-151 CE). The ancient settlement is believed to have been destroyed by fire, though there is no indication that it was purposely destroyed. \n\nMountstuart Elphinstone, the first British emissary to Afghanistan chanced upon this stupa in 1808 AD and penned a detailed account in his memoir 'Kingdom of Caubul' (1815). According to an inscription on a stone the stupa was restored in 1891 by a regiment of the British Indian Army.

{"id": "21233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21233", "title": "Nirvana", "text": "Nirvana\n\nIn Indian religions, \"nirvana\" is synonymous with \"moksha\" and \"mukti\". All Indian religions assert it to be a state of perfect quietude, freedom, highest happiness as well as the liberation from or ending of \"samsara\", the repeating cycle of birth, life and death.\n\nHowever, Buddhist and non-Buddhist traditions describe these terms for liberation differently. In the Buddhist context, \"nirvana\" refers to realization of non-self and emptiness, marking the end of rebirth by stilling the \"fires\" that keep the process of rebirth going. In Hindu philosophy, it is the union of or the realization of the identity of Atman with Brahman, depending on the Hindu tradition. In Jainism, it is also the soteriological goal, it represents the release of a soul from karmic bondage and samsara.\n\nThe word \"nirvāṇa\", states Steven Collins, is from the verbal root \"vā\" \"blow\" in the form of past participle \"vāna\" \"blown\", prefixed with the preverb \"nis\" meaning \"out\". Hence the original meaning of the word is \"blown out, extinguished\". Sandhi changes the sounds: the \"v\" of \"vāna\" causes \"nis\" to become \"nir\", and then the \"r\" of \"nir\" causes retroflexion of the following \"n\": \"nis+vāna\" > \"nirvāṇa\".\n\nThe term \"nirvana\" in the soteriological sense of \"blown out, extinguished\" state of liberation does not appear in the Vedas nor in the Upanishads. According to Collins, \"the Buddhists seem to have been the first to call it \"nirvana\".\" However, the ideas of spiritual liberation using different terminology, with the concept of soul and Brahman, appears in Vedic texts and Upanishads, such as in verse 4.4.6 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. This may have been deliberate use of words in early Buddhism, suggests Collins, since Atman and Brahman were described in Vedic texts and Upanishads with the imagery of fire, as something good, desirable and liberating.\n\n\"Nirvāṇa\" is a term found in the texts of all major Indian religions – Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism and Sikhism. It refers to the profound peace of mind that is acquired with \"moksha\", liberation from samsara, or release from a state of suffering, after respective spiritual practice or sādhanā.\n\nThe idea of \"moksha\" is connected to the Vedic culture, where it conveyed a notion of \"amrtam\", \"immortality\", and also a notion of a \"timeless\", \"unborn\", or \"the still point of the turning world of time\". It was also its timeless structure, the whole underlying \"the spokes of the invariable but incessant wheel of time\". The hope for life after death started with notions of going to the worlds of the Fathers or Ancestors and/or the world of the Gods or Heaven.\n\nThe earliest Vedic texts incorporate the concept of life, followed by an afterlife in heaven and hell based on cumulative virtues (merit) or vices (demerit). However, the ancient Vedic Rishis challenged this idea of afterlife as simplistic, because people do not live an equally moral or immoral life. Between generally virtuous lives, some are more virtuous; while evil too has degrees, and either permanent heaven or permanent hell is disproportionate. The Vedic thinkers introduced the idea of an afterlife in heaven or hell in proportion to one's merit, and when this runs out, one returns and is reborn. The idea of rebirth following \"running out of merit\" appears in Buddhist texts as well. This idea appears in many ancient and medieval texts, as \"Saṃsāra\", or the endless cycle of life, death, rebirth and redeath, such as section 6:31 of the \"Mahabharata\" and verse 9.21 of the \"Bhagavad Gita\". The Saṃsara, the life after death, and what impacts rebirth came to be seen as dependent on karma.\n\nThe liberation from Saṃsāra \"d\"eveloped as an ultimate goal and soteriological value in the Indian culture, and called by different terms such as nirvana, moksha, mukti and kaivalya. This basic scheme underlies Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism, where \"the ultimate aim is the timeless state of \"moksa\", or, as the Buddhists first seem to have called it, nirvana.\"\n\nAlthough the term occurs in the literatures of a number of ancient Indian traditions, the concept is most commonly associated with Buddhism. It was later adopted by other Indian religions, but with different meanings and description (\"Moksha\"), such as in the Hindu text \"Bhagavad Gita\" of the \"Mahabharata\".\n\nNirvana (\"nibbana\") literally means \"blowing out\" or \"quenching\". It is the most used as well as the earliest term to describe the soteriological goal in Buddhism: release from the cycle of rebirth (\"saṃsāra\"). Nirvana is part of the Third Truth on \"cessation of dukkha\" in the Four Noble Truths doctrine of Buddhism. It is the goal of the Noble Eightfold Path.\n\nThe Buddha is believed in the Buddhist scholastic tradition to have realized two types of nirvana, one at enlightenment, and another at his death. The first is called \"sopadhishesa-nirvana\" (nirvana with a remainder), the second \"parinirvana\" or \"anupadhishesa-nirvana\" (nirvana without remainder, or final nirvana).\n\nIn the Buddhist tradition, nirvana is described as the extinguishing of the \"fires\" that cause rebirths and associated suffering. The Buddhist texts identify these three \"three fires\" or \"three poisons\" as \"raga\" (greed, sensuality), \"dvesha\" (aversion, hate) and \"avidyā\" or \"moha\" (ignorance, delusion).\n\nThe state of nirvana is also described in Buddhism as cessation of all afflictions, cessation of all actions, cessation of rebirths and suffering that are a consequence of afflictions and actions. Liberation is described as identical to \"anatta\" (\"anatman\", non-self, lack of any self). In Buddhism, liberation is achieved when all things and beings are understood to be with no Self. Nirvana is also described as identical to achieving \"sunyata\" (emptiness), where there is no essence or fundamental nature in anything, and everything is empty.\n\nIn time, with the development of Buddhist doctrine, other interpretations were given, such as being an unconditioned state, a fire going out for lack of fuel, abandoning weaving (\"vana\") together of life after life, and the elimination of desire. However, Buddhist texts have asserted since ancient times that nirvana is more than \"destruction of desire\", it is \"the object of the knowledge\" of the Buddhist path.\n\nThe most ancient texts of Hinduism such as the Vedas and early Upanishads don't mention the soteriological term \"Nirvana\". This term is found in texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and the Nirvana Upanishad, likely composed in the post-Buddha era. The concept of Nirvana is described differently in Buddhist and Hindu literature. Hinduism has the concept of Atman – the soul, self – asserted to exist in every living being, while Buddhism asserts through its \"anatman\" doctrine that there is no Atman in any being. Nirvana in Buddhism is \"stilling mind, cessation of desires, and action\" unto emptiness, states Jeaneane Fowler, while nirvana in post-Buddhist Hindu texts is also \"stilling mind but not inaction\" and \"not emptiness\", rather it is the knowledge of true Self (Atman) and the acceptance of its universality and unity with metaphysical Brahman.\n\nThe ancient soteriological concept in Hinduism is moksha, described as the liberation from the cycle of birth and death through self-knowledge and the eternal connection of Atman (soul, self) and metaphysical Brahman. Moksha is derived from the root \"muc*\" () which means free, let go, release, liberate; Moksha means \"liberation, freedom, emancipation of the soul\". In the Vedas and early Upanishads, the word mucyate () appears, which means to be set free or release - such as of a horse from its harness.\n\nThe traditions within Hinduism state that there are multiple paths (\"marga\") to moksha: \"jnana-marga\", the path of knowledge; \"bhakti-marga\", the path of devotion; and \"karma-marga\", the path of action.\n\nThe term Brahma-nirvana appears in verses 2.72 and 5.24-26 of the Bhagavad Gita. It is the state of release or liberation; the union with the Brahman. According to Easwaran, it is an experience of blissful egolessness.\n\nAccording to Zaehner, Johnson and other scholars, \"nirvana\" in the Gita is a Buddhist term adopted by the Hindus. Zaehner states it was used in Hindu texts for the first time in the Bhagavad Gita, and that the idea therein in verse 2.71-72 to \"suppress one's desires and ego\" is also Buddhist. According to Johnson the term \"nirvana\" is borrowed from the Buddhists to confuse the Buddhists, by linking the Buddhist nirvana state to the pre-Buddhist Vedic tradition of metaphysical absolute called Brahman.\n\nAccording to Mahatma Gandhi, the Hindu and Buddhist understanding of \"nirvana\" are different because the nirvana of the Buddhists is shunyata, emptiness, but the nirvana of the Gita means peace and that is why it is described as brahma-nirvana (oneness with Brahman).\n\nThe terms \"moksa\" and \"nirvana\" are often used interchangeably in the Jain texts.\n\nUttaradhyana Sutra provides an account of Sudharman – also called Gautama, and one of the disciples of Mahavira – explaining the meaning of nirvana to Kesi, a disciple of Parshva.\n\nThe term \"Nirvana\" (also mentioned is \"parinirvana\") in the thirteenth or fourtheenth century Manichaean work \"The great song to Mani\" and \"The story of the Death of Mani\", referring to the \"realm of light\".\n\nThe concept of liberation as \"extinction of suffering\", along with the idea of \"sansara\" as the \"cycle of rebirth\" is also part of Sikhism. Nirvana appears in Sikh texts as the term \"Nirban\". However, the more common term is \"Mukti\" or \"Moksh\", a salvation concept wherein loving devotion to God is emphasized for liberation from endless cycle of rebirths.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8023119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8023119", "title": "Oscar Martinez (The Office)", "text": "Oscar Martinez (The Office)\n\nOscar Martinez is a fictional character from the US mockumentary-style television series \"The Office\" played by Cuban-American actor Oscar Nunez. Martinez was one of the few openly gay characters in broadcast television at the time that the series aired. Nunez, who is straight, did not know his character might be gay when he first signed on. For the 2006–2007 season, Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) reported he was the only LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) person of color character on a regular series. For the 2007–2008 season he was the \"only remaining gay character on a half-hour comedy program\" and the only LGBT lead or supporting character who is a person of color. For the 2009–2010 season, Martinez was one of four people of color LGBT regular series characters; in 2010–2011 there were six and in 2011–2012 there were five.\n\nMartinez is an accountant at the Scranton, Pennsylvania, office of the paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin and gets his first name from Núñez; series producer Greg Daniels felt that \"Oscar\" sounded like a good accountant's name. He is a first-generation Mexican American. He is also openly gay after being outed by his then boss Michael Scott in \"Gay Witch Hunt\", the third-season premiere episode devoted to the outing. However, the character was implied to be gay in the second-season episode \"The Secret\", when Dwight catches him faking sickness to spend the day with his boyfriend (Dwight remains oblivious to this detail as he was obsessed with proving that Oscar was not ill). As a result, in earlier episodes, many co-workers erroneously attribute to him various Mexican stereotypes (e.g. being involved in drug cartels) but after his outing, his stereotypes are more focused on his being gay, particularly by Michael, which may explain their conflicted relationship. Núñez explained in a 2008 interview that the character variously feels amusement, pity and hatred towards his fictional boss. He has no specific counterpart in the original British series.\n\nOscar is known for being a rational, quietly efficient, and intellectual worker in the office, often the one who will ask pointed financial questions that his colleagues will not or that Michael avoids answering. In some episodes he is described as the smartest in the office. Martinez refers to himself as being in the \"Coalition for Reason\" with Jim and Pam Halpert. According to Núñez, the three \"are there to set up the comic situations\" for boss Michael and Dwight Schrute, Michael's toady. He explained, \"We can still be funny but we are definitely the 'straight guys'.\" He is often the one who is able to clearly see the reality and logic in situations, including financial ones such as when Michael started up his own paper company or Ryan Howard's online startup business. Because of this, Oscar is considered to be a know-it-all by many of his co-workers. Oscar is frequently exasperated by the antics of his coworkers and tends to find their humor offensive. He is reserved, not really exhibiting a desire for close contact with any of his co-workers, although he is friendly when not outwardly pedantic. In an \"AfterElton.com\" interview, Núñez explained he plays the character like an accountant, who happens to be gay, and just trying to do his work and not really interested in what the documentarians are filming. Actor Núñez references the character as a Log Cabin Republican, though no mention of this has occurred in the show. In the episode \"Dwight Christmas\", he is in fact openly acknowledged as a Democrat. His more balanced and normal personality makes him an everyman type character, contrasting with the generally extroverted people with whom he works. He's also a charter member of the company's three-person (and exclusive) \"Finer Things Club\" with Pam and Toby Flenderson. He and co-worker Kevin Malone seem to have a strong friendship with each other, often a dynamic where Oscar is often the calm, rational one while Kevin is the fun-loving one.\n\nOscar has worked at Dunder Mifflin for over nine years in 2008. He is openly gay (after being publicly outed by Michael) and previously lived with his partner, Gil. Originally, Oscar was in the closet, and Gil was believed to be his roommate. In earlier seasons, he is seen driving a Saturn Ion. This is the same Saturn that Angela can later be seen driving, such as in the episode \"Niagara\". However, he is seen in the third season driving a Lexus RX 400h, a company car he was lent as a result of his unwanted outing by Michael.\n\nThough Oscar is openly gay in later episodes, in the episode \"The Fire\", when asked by Jim \"Who would you do?\", Oscar offers the answer, \"Pam\"; also, in \"The Client\", he makes an intentionally vague reference to a woman he previously dated.\n\nIn a deleted scene from \"Gay Witch Hunt\", Oscar explains that he in fact notified Michael of his being gay during his job interview. This caused Michael to laugh repeatedly, and he hired Oscar on the spot because he was \"the funniest person that [Michael] had ever met\". Oscar then hid his sexuality from his co-workers (until he was outed) for fear of losing his job.\n\nIn the episode \"Diversity Day\", Michael makes an example of Oscar in a diversity training seminar for his being Mexican. Michael annoys Oscar by stating the word \"Mexican\" might be offensive because it has \"certain connotations\". In \"The Alliance\", Oscar goes around the office asking for donations for his nephew's walkathon for cerebral palsy. In \"Basketball\", Oscar asks to be on Michael's team; however, Michael assumes he is good at baseball and boxing, but not basketball.\n\nOne of Oscar's favorite pastimes at work is playing a paper football game dubbed \"Hateball\" (because Angela hates it) with Kevin Malone whenever Michael isn't around. He keeps a two-year running total of their scores. Oscar enjoys ice skating, likes the office thermostat to be set to a chilly 66 degrees, and dressed up in drag on \"Halloween\". He has a conflict with Angela Martin over her poster of babies dressed as jazz musicians and claims it offends him more than \"hardcore pornography.\" In \"The Secret,\" Oscar calls in sick, but Dwight discovers that Oscar spent the day shopping and ice skating with his \"roommate\" Gil, but Dwight's naivete stops him realizing the truth about Oscar's sexuality, which is here revealed to the viewers, and again indicated in the episode \"Valentine's Day\", when Oscar receives a gift and unconvincingly tells Kevin it is from his mother.\n\nIn the first episode of the third season, \"Gay Witch Hunt\", Michael obliviously calls Oscar \"faggy\" for preferring the film \"Shakespeare in Love\" to \"Die Hard\". Oscar is understandably upset and reports it to corporate. When Michael realizes Oscar is actually gay, he tries to make it up to him and embraces some gay culture. Michael calls a meeting and announces that Oscar is gay in front of the entire staff, much to Oscar's shock and dismay. In the conference room, to show no hard feelings, Michael hugs Oscar then proceeds to try to kiss him. Oscar is both disgusted and horrified by Michael's actions and proclaims it has been \"the worst, most backwards day of my life.\"\n\nTo prevent Oscar from suing the company for anti-gay discrimination, the corporate manager, Jan Levinson, gives him a three-month paid vacation to Europe and use of a company car, a silver Lexus RX 400h, replacing his gold Saturn Ion. After going on his vacation with Gil, Oscar returns briefly in \"A Benihana Christmas,\" but decides that it is too soon and leaves before anyone notices him. Oscar finally returns to the office in \"The Return\" and Michael decides to throw a Mexican themed party for him. Angela, who had acted cold towards him when he came out, apologizes and invites him to be a part of the party planning committee. He is also shown in \"Business School\" with his partner Gil at Pam's art show, agreeing with Gil that, although it's her first try, Pam's art lacks courage and honesty, which she overhears.\n\nIn \"Beach Games\", Michael announces that the winner of his \"Survivor\"-style game will get his job. In an interview, Oscar states that if Dwight gets the position, he will transfer to Albany. He also mentions that he is trying to get out of his relationship with Gil and that he \"might try women for a while; Angela thinks I can cross over.\"\n\nIn \"Fun Run\", Kevin tries to use Oscar to see if Jim and Pam are dating. In a deleted scene, he says that he was raised Catholic, but now identifies as an agnostic Secular Humanist. In \"Money\", Oscar helps Michael deal with his financial problems by going over his current finances. Oscar does this after Michael follows through with some bad advice from Creed, who advises Michael to declare bankruptcy will give him a clean financial state. With Pam and Toby, Oscar is a founding member of the Finer Things Club, which he refers to as the \"gayest thing\" about him \"besides having sex with men\".\n\nBesides ice skating, Oscar is revealed to have an interest in yoga. In \"Weight Loss\", he refers Holly to his yoga teacher whom she later dates. For Halloween, he dresses as Uncle Sam. And in Business Ethics, he comes the closest to congratulating Pam and Jim for their engagement, by commenting that he had assumed they were already engaged.\n\nIn \"Business Trip\", he travels to Winnipeg, Manitoba with Michael and Andy, with whom he bonds when they drink Long Island iced teas. Drunk, he questions Andy's desire to marry Angela and they drunk dial her. In the morning, Oscar has rebuilt his reserve, but does thank Andy for trying to hook him up with two men in the hotel bar the previous night; however, by \"Lecture Circuit\", Oscar has returned to being dismissive of Andy and refuses to listen when Andy wants advice on asking out an attractive female customer. Oscar also shows a liking for egg salad sandwiches.\n\nIn \"Stress Relief\", during Dwight's over-the-top attempt to teach the office employees about fire safety, Oscar and everyone else are locked in the building, while under the impression that there is a fire. Oscar then attempts to escape by climbing into the ceiling, and is at first successful. However, his legs eventually fall through. Later, during a roast held by Michael, Oscar severely roasts Michael, yelling at him in Spanish with the intent to make him cry (his comments, in English, amount to Oscar screaming that he can't believe has to drive for hours every day to work for someone like Michael) which succeeds after Oscar and the branch humiliate Michael. Oscar later regrets it and apologizes to Michael. Michael accepts the apology, but not without roasting Oscar by pointing out \"You're gay\", which Oscar seems to accept.\n\nOscar also finds himself at odds with Pam during \"The Surplus\" when he reveals a $4,300 budget surplus to Michael that he suggests could be used to purchase a new copier. Jim sides with him over the issue and they take Michael out to lunch to further their agenda. But Oscar finally concedes to Pam and agrees to buying new chairs like she wanted, ruining Michael's plans to keep 15% of the surplus for himself when the sides remained deadlocked past a deadline for using the entire amount.\n\nIn \"Blood Drive,\" Oscar opens up during Michael's \"Lonely Hearts Party\" at the office about being rejected by a man who claimed not to be gay, but was later spotted on a date at a gay nightclub in Kansas City. Along with the staff, a sympathetic Oscar walks out with Michael after the holiday party is over, showing he can empathize with anyone.\n\nOscar wears sandals without socks in the office on \"Casual Friday\", which disgusts Angela and she objects to it. Oscar however, refuses to back down on Toby's request that he wear socks.\n\nDuring the company picnic when Meredith suggests forfeiting their volleyball game against corporate, an insightful Oscar points out that they need to go through with it, saying \"Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.\" after upper management decides to shut down the Buffalo branch after corporate hid the news.\n\nIn the episode \"Gossip\", Michael spreads rumors about various people throughout the Office, he tells everyone that Oscar is the voice of the Taco Bell dog. Oscar also helps Andy cope when a rumor is spread that he is gay. In \"The Meeting\", Michael calls Oscar to his office to seek advice about his upcoming colonoscopy due to Michael thinking that it's going to be a lot like anal intercourse and feels Oscar would be well versed in that field, this makes Oscar visibly uncomfortable.\n\nIn \"Niagara\", Pam's sister mistakes Kevin as Gil, Oscar's boyfriend, which greatly offends Oscar; Kevin is in turn insulted, telling Oscar that \"he would be honored to be his boyfriend\". In \"Mafia\", Oscar's psyche begins to crumble when Jim and Pam go on their honeymoon (they help maintain the \"Coalition for Reason\" in the office) and Michael, Dwight, Andy and Ryan began to believe that an Italian-American insurance salesman is in the Mafia. So much so that, much to their anger, he calls them on their honeymoon in desperate need to talk to someone normal. He is further annoyed when Kevin, fearing that he [Kevin] will go to jail for committing identity theft against Jim, suggests that Oscar, being a homosexual, would \"love\" prison (because of the occurrence of male on male prison rape ).\n\nIn \"Murder\", Oscar does not take part in Michael's murder mystery game, preferring to keep working and keeping tabs on what's going on with Dunder-Mifflin in the wake of bankruptcy rumors. He hears that Corporate has ordered Accounting to stop payments to vendors and tries to interrupt the game to tell Michael, only to have Michael stay in character rather than allow the game to be disrupted. He tries to deliver the news in as someone who would inhabit the game's world but can't figure out a way to do so and just says it plainly. In Shareholder Meeting, he visits the company conference with Michael due to his annoyance at how poorly and inefficiently the company is being run, but refuses the chance to tell the board what he really thinks.\n\nIn \"Secret Santa\", Pam tries to play matchmaker, introducing the newly-single Oscar to the new gay warehouse worker Matt (played by Sam Daly). Oscar dismisses a nosy Pam and doesn't correct Matt when he calls him by the wrong name, Victor. Later, he acts aloof and calls Matt by the wrong name.\n\nIn a deleted scene from \"Happy Hour\", Michael acts surprised when he is told it was Oscar who came up with the idea to go out, not aware Oscar set up the happy hour plan so he could get to spend more time with Matt in a social setting. When Oscar asks why Michael is so surprised, Kevin responds by telling Oscar that he's anti-social and a snob; a claim which Oscar then justifies by stating he hates the Philadelphia Opera. In the aired episode, Daryl initially picks up Oscar's interest in Matt, telling Oscar \"You can be gay with him--just be straight with me\", and later Daryl bluntly says that Matt is a dummy and not worth Oscar's time, before he watches with bemusement as Oscar quickly runs off when Matt invites him to play an arcade basketball game.\n\nIn \"Costume Contest\", Oscar points out that the contest's coveted prize, a coupon catalog, only provides the thousands of dollars of savings promised if the person buys a lot of things they do not really need. He then puts on a bland \"rational consumer\" outfit to mock the contest, but is stunned to learn that he won (mainly because Kelly and others voted for him out of surety he would lose), Ryan wanted to shake things up a la his support for Ralph Nader, and Creed says it was \"the best Edward James Olmos costume I've ever seen\".\n\nIn \"China\", Oscar's know-it-all tendencies come to the fore when he is wrong about a fact related to urban population centers in China—and Michael was right about it. Oscar then wants to have Michael meet him for coffee, which Jim recognizes is a way for \"Mr. Actually\" (Oscar) to get to have the last word and show Michael up on the facts about China. However, while Oscar does make some points Michael can't rebut, Michael still wins over a number of watching co-workers when he makes an emotional argument about the U.S. and China that Oscar isn't able to counter.\n\nIn \"Classy Christmas\", Oscar, who was already annoyed at Angela for constantly talking about her State Senator boyfriend, meets him and immediately says in an interview that \"he's gay\". Later on at the party, Ryan walks away from their group to make a drink, and the Senator clearly watches Ryan's backside as he leaves. Oscar notices this and turns the camera with a shocked expression.\n\nIn \"The Seminar\", Oscar and Pam help Erin when she plays a scrabble game against Gabe on her phone so that she can pick the movie she wants to watch with him (\"Wall-E\"). Before Oscar can type in the final word, Pam suggests that Erin should be the one to do it. Oscar reluctantly gives her the phone and hints that she should type the word \"apoplexy\". Erin ends up typing \"ape\", and Oscar is left frustrated.\n\nIn \"PDA\", Oscar strongly disapproves of Michael and Holly's public displays of affection. Later on, after the two announce that they are moving in together, Oscar comes around and tells them to kiss. The kiss causes Kevin to say, \"Suck on that, Oscar\", and Oscar frustratedly points out that he was the one who told them to kiss. In \"Garage Sale\", Oscar tries to sell a vast collection of \"Will and Grace\" memorabilia he has gathered over the years due to people mistakingly thinking he's a fan of the show. He is also part of the group that helps Michael think of a good way to propose to Holly.\n\nIn \"Michael's Last Dundies\", Oscar laughs at Michael's portrayal of Angela in the opening video of the award show. He tells the camera (when referring to the movie) \"the analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content\". Later, he has a brief solo in the employees' a cappella version of \"Seasons of Love\" (with altered lyrics) that they sing to Michael (who is soon departing). In it, he sings that he forgives Michael for kissing him (which previously happened in the third season premiere episode \"Gay Witch Hunt\").\n\nIn \"Goodbye, Michael\", Michael gives Oscar a miniature scarecrow figurine that he clearly made on his own, to symbolize the \"brain\" that Oscar gave to Michael, just like in \"The Wizard of Oz\". In an interview, it was clearly intended as a joke on Michael's part, but Oscar accepts it as a serious gift. Oscar listens in as Angela shows off pictures of her and her boyfriend together, shaking his head at the fact the pictures hint heavily at the boyfriend being gay but Angela continues not to see it. In the extended version of the episode, Oscar says in a talking-head interview that Michael once asked him if \"gay guys squeeze each other's boobs\", and gives a little laugh while citing that he will never forget that.\n\nIn \"Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager\", Dwight makes everybody recite the Pledge of Allegiance. The camera focuses on Oscar during the phrase \"under God\" which he does not say.\n\nOscar finds himself on the \"winners\" side of new boss Robert California's (James Spader) \"List\". Along with Jim, Oscar appears visibly uncomfortable when he finds this out.\n\nDuring \"The Incentive\", Andy manages to rouse the staff into doubling sales by promising to get a tattoo of their choice, on Andy's buttocks. With the rest of the staff, Oscar joins in on the bet and is witness to Andy's tattoo at the shop.\n\nIn \"Garden Party\", Oscar, along with other staff, listens to Andy's father verbally browbeat his son on Jim and Pam's baby monitor. With Darryl, they cheer Andy up with a barbecue. The two later confide in a talking head interview that they understand why Andy has a need to prove himself to everyone.\n\nIn \"New Guys\", Angela pleads with Oscar to adopt her cat, Comstock, to which Oscar refuses and insists he's a dog person. But when he learns that the cat is a favorite of her husband's, Oscar changes his mind and adopts Comstock. It's later implied that Oscar is having an affair with Robert, judging by a secretive phone call he makes to let him know of adopting Comstock. In \"The Boat\", the affair is confirmed after the cameras catch Oscar kissing Robert. When Oscar sees that Kevin saw them, he goes to great lengths to ensure that Kevin keeps the secret, which he does.\n\nIn \"The Whale\", Angela confides to Oscar that she suspects Robert is cheating on her and they follow Robert to his gym. When Angela sees Robert making a call, after asking \"who is he calling,\" and Oscar's phone begins to ring, she finally suspects that Oscar may be the one having an affair with Robert. In \"The Target\", Angela seeks revenge on Oscar and hires a hitman to attack him but is talked out of it by Dwight. Oscar allows her to kick him in the shin instead. In \"Vandalism\", Oscar and Angela compete uncomfortably for the affections of Robert at Angela's son's birthday party, but Oscar later suspects that Robert may have invited him only to boost Latino representation for his political campaign. Later, Oscar and Angela reconcile after he invites her to move in with him when she and Robert break up and she is evicted from her apartment.\n\nIn \"Finale\", one year after the airing of the documentary, Oscar is revealed to be running for Pennsylvania State Senate (it is possible, but not explicitly stated, that Robert's re-election bid failed after he was outed by the documentary, meaning Oscar may be running for Robert's old seat) and he is the godfather of Angela and Dwight's son. Oscar also brings some of his old condescension to events around Dwight's wedding; at the dinner for Dwight and his old friends, when he learns that Andy has gotten a job at Cornell's Office of Admissions he assumes that it is volunteer work or an internship, leading Andy to somewhat annoyedly say that the job is a full-time paid position.\n"}
{"id": "205856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=205856", "title": "Oscar Micheaux", "text": "Oscar Micheaux\n\nOscar Devereaux Micheaux (; January 2, 1884 – March 25, 1951) was an African-American author, film director and independent producer of more than 44 films. Although the short-lived Lincoln Motion Picture Company was the first movie company owned and controlled by black filmmakers, Micheaux is regarded as the first major African-American feature filmmaker, a prominent producer of race film, and has been described as \"the most successful African-American filmmaker of the first half of the 20th century\". He produced both silent films and sound films when the industry changed to incorporate speaking actors.\n\nMicheaux was born on a farm in Metropolis, Illinois, on January 2, 1884. He was the fifth child born to Calvin S. and Belle Michaux, who had a total of 13 children. In his later years, Micheaux added an \"e\" to his last name. His father was born a slave in Kentucky. Because of its surname, his father's family appears to have been associated with French-descended settlers. French Huguenot refugees had settled in Virginia in 1700; their descendants took slaves west when they migrated into Kentucky after the American Revolutionary War.\n\nIn his later years, Micheaux wrote about the social oppression he experienced as a young boy. His parents moved to the city so that the children could receive a better education. Micheaux attended a well-established school for several years before the family eventually ran into money troubles and were forced to return to the farm. The discontented Micheaux became rebellious and his struggles caused problems within his family. His father was not happy with him and sent him away to do marketing in the city. Micheaux found pleasure in this job because he was able to speak to many new people and learned social skills that he would later reflect in his films.\n\nWhen Micheaux was 17 years old, he moved to Chicago to live with his older brother, then working as a waiter. Micheaux became dissatisfied with what he viewed as his brother’s way of living \"the good life\". He rented his own place and found work in the stockyards, which he found difficult. He moved from the stockyards to the steel mills, holding down many different jobs.\n\nAfter being \"swindled out of two dollars\" by an employment agency, Micheaux decided to become his own boss. His first business was a shoeshine stand, which he set up at a wealthy African American barbershop, away from Chicago competition. He learned the basic strategies of business and started to save money. He became a Pullman porter on the major railroads, at that time considered prestigious employment for African Americans because it was relatively stable, well paid, and secure, and it enabled travel and interaction with new people. This job was an informal education for Micheaux. He profited financially, and also gained contacts and knowledge about the world through traveling as well as a greater understanding for business. When he left the position, he had seen much of the United States, had a couple of thousand dollars saved in his bank account, and had made a number of connections with wealthy white people who helped his future endeavors.\n\nMicheaux moved to Gregory County, South Dakota, where he bought land and worked as a homesteader. This experience inspired his first novels and films. His neighbors on the frontier were predominately blue collar whites. \"Some recall that [Micheaux] rarely sat at a table with his blue collar white neighbors.\" Micheaux’s years as a homesteader allowed him to learn more about human relations and farming. While farming, Micheaux wrote articles and submitted them to the press. \"The Chicago Defender\" published one of his earliest articles.\n\nIn South Dakota, Micheaux married Orlean McCracken. Her family proved to be complex and burdensome for Micheaux. Unhappy with their living arrangements, Orlean felt that Micheaux did not pay enough attention to her. She gave birth while he was away on business, and was reported to have emptied their bank accounts and fled. Orlean’s father sold Micheaux's property and took the money from the sale. After his return, Micheaux tried unsuccessfully to get Orlean and his property back.\n\nMicheaux decided to concentrate on writing and, eventually, filmmaking, a new industry. He wrote seven novels. In 1913, 1,000 copies of his first book, \"The Conquest: The Story of a Negro Homesteader\", were printed. He published the book anonymously, for unknown reasons. Based on his experiences as a homesteader and the failure of his first marriage, it was largely autobiographical. Although character names have been changed, the protagonist is named Oscar Devereaux. His theme was about African Americans realizing their potential and succeeding in areas where they had not felt they could. The book outlines the difference between city lifestyles of Negroes and the life he decided to lead as a lone Negro out on the far West as a pioneer. He discusses the culture of doers who want to accomplish and those who see themselves as victims of injustice and hopelessness and who do not want to try to succeed, but instead like to pretend to be successful while living the city lifestyle in poverty. He had become frustrated with getting some members of his race to populate the frontier and make something of themselves, with real work and property investment. He wrote over 100 letters to fellow Negroes in the East beckoning them to come West, but only his older brother eventually took his advice. One of Micheaux's fundamental beliefs was that hard work and enterprise would make any person rise to respect and prominence no matter his or her race.\n\nIn 1918, his novel \"The Homesteader\", dedicated to Booker T. Washington, attracted the attention of George Johnson, the manager of the Lincoln Motion Picture Company in Los Angeles. After Johnson offered to make \"The Homesteader\" into a new feature film, negotiations and paperwork became inharmonious. Micheaux wanted to be directly involved in the adaptation of his book as a movie, but Johnson resisted and never produced the film.\n\nInstead, Micheaux founded the Micheaux Film & Book Company of Sioux City in Chicago; its first project was the production of \"The Homesteader\" as a feature film. Micheaux had a major career as a film producer and director: He produced over 40 films, which drew audiences throughout the U.S. as well as internationally. Micheaux contacted wealthy academic connections from his earlier career as a porter, and sold stock for his company at $75 to $100 a share. Micheaux hired actors and actresses and decided to have the premiere in Chicago. The film and Micheaux received high praise from film critics. One article credited Micheaux with “a historic breakthrough, a creditable, dignified achievement”. Some members of the Chicago clergy criticized the film as libelous. \"The Homesteader\" became known as Micheaux’s breakout film; it helped him become widely known as a writer and a filmmaker.\n\nIn addition to writing and directing his own films, Micheaux also adapted the works of different writers for his silent pictures. Many of his films were open, blunt and thought-provoking regarding certain racial issues of that time. He once commented: \"It is only by presenting those portions of the race portrayed in my pictures, in the light and background of their true state, that we can raise our people to greater heights.\" Financial hardships during the Great Depression eventually made it impossible for Micheaux to keep producing films, and he returned to writing.\n\nMicheaux’s first novel \"The Conquest\" was adapted to film and re-titled \"The Homesteader\". This film, which met with critical and commercial success, was released in 1919. It revolves around a man named Jean Baptiste, called the Homesteader, who falls in love with many white women but resists marrying one out of his loyalty to his race. Baptiste sacrifices love to be a key symbol for his fellow African Americans. He looks for love among his own people and marries an African-American woman. Relations between them deteriorate. Eventually, Baptiste is not allowed to see his wife. She kills her father for keeping them apart and commits suicide. Baptiste is accused of the crime, but is ultimately cleared. An old love helps him through his troubles. After he learns that she is a mulatto and thus part African, they marry. This film deals extensively with race relationships.\n\nMicheaux’s second silent film was \"Within Our Gates\", produced in 1920. Although sometimes considered his response to the film \"Birth of a Nation\", Micheaux said that he created it independently as a response to the widespread social instability following World War I. \"Within Our Gates\" revolved around the main character, Sylvia Landry, a mixed-race school teacher. In a flashback, Sylvia is shown growing up as the adopted daughter of a sharecropper. When her father confronts their white landlord over money, a fight ensues. The landlord is shot by another white man, but Sylvia's adoptive father is accused and lynched with her adoptive mother.\n\nSylvia is almost raped by the landowner’s brother but discovers that he is her biological father. Micheaux always depicts African Americans as being serious and reaching for higher education. Before the flashback scene, we see that Sylvia travels to Boston, seeking funding for her school, which serves black children. They are underserved by the segregated society. On her journey, she is hit by the car of a rich white woman. Learning about Landry's cause, the woman decides to give her school $50,000.\n\nIn the film, Micheaux depicts educated and professional people in black society as light-skinned, representing the elite status of some of the mixed-race people who comprised the majority of African Americans free before the Civil War. Poor people are represented as dark-skinned and with more undiluted African ancestry. Mixed-race people also feature as some of the villains. The film is set within the Jim Crow era. It contrasted the experiences for African Americans who stayed in rural areas and others who had migrated to cities and become urbanized. Micheaux explored the suffering of African Americans in the present day, without explaining how the situation arose in history. Some feared that this film would cause even more unrest within society, and others believed it would open the public’s eyes to the unjust treatment by whites of blacks. Protests against the film continued until the day it was released. Because of its controversial status, the film was banned from some theaters.\n\nMicheaux adapted two works by Charles W. Chesnutt, which he released under their original titles: \"The Conjure Woman\" (1926) and \"The House Behind the Cedars\" (1927). The latter, which dealt with issues of mixed race and passing, created so much controversy when reviewed by the Film Board of Virginia that he was forced to make cuts to have it shown. He remade this story as a sound film in 1932, releasing it with the title \"Veiled Aristocrats\". The silent version of the film is believed to have been lost.\n\nMicheaux's films were made during a time of great change in the African-American community. His films featured contemporary black life. He dealt with racial relationships between blacks and whites, and the challenges for blacks when trying to achieve success in the larger society. His films were used to oppose and discuss the racial injustice that African Americans received. Topics such as lynching, job discrimination, rape, mob violence, and economic exploitation were depicted in his films. These films also reflect his ideologies and autobiographical experiences. The journalist Richard Gehr said, \"Micheaux appears to have only one story to tell, his own, and he tells it repeatedly.\"\n\nMicheaux sought to create films that would counter white portrayals of African Americans, which tended to emphasize inferior stereotypes. He created complex characters of different classes. His films questioned the value system of both African-American and white communities as well as caused problems with the press and state censors.\n\nThe critic Lupack described Micheaux as pursuing moderation with his films and creating a \"middle-class cinema\". His works were designed to appeal to both middle- and lower-class audiences.\n\nMicheaux said, \"My results…might have been narrow at times, due perhaps to certain limited situations, which I endeavored to portray, but in those limited situations, the truth was the predominate characteristic. It is only by presenting those portions of the race portrayed in my pictures, in the light and background of their true state, that we can raise our people to greater heights. I am too imbued with the spirit of Booker T. Washington to engraft false virtues upon ourselves, to make ourselves that which we are not.\"</blockquote getto\n\nMicheaux died on March 25, 1951, in Charlotte, North Carolina, of heart failure. He is buried in Great Bend Cemetery in Great Bend, Kansas, the home of his youth. His gravestone reads: \"A man ahead of his time\".\n\n\nIn 2014, Block Starz Music Television released \"The Czar of Black Hollywood\", a documentary film chronicling the early life and career of Oscar Micheaux using Library of Congress archived footage, photos, illustrations and vintage music. The film was announced by American radio host Tom Joyner on his nationally syndicated program, \"The Tom Joyner Morning Show\", as part of a \"Little Known Black History Fact\" on Micheaux. In an interview with \"The Washington Times\", filmmaker Bayer Mack said he read the 2007 biography \"Oscar Micheaux: The Great and Only\" by Patrick McGilligan and was inspired to produce \"The Czar of Black Hollywood\" because Micheaux's life mirrored his own. Mack told \"The Huffington Post\" he was shocked that, in spite of Micheaux's historical significance, there was \"virtually nothing out there about [his] life\". The film's executive producer, Frances Presley Rice, told the \"Sun Sentinel\" that Micheaux was the first \"indie movie producer.\" In 2018, Mack was interviewed by the news site \"Mic\" for its \"Black Monuments Project\", which named Oscar Micheaux as one of its 50 African-Americans deserving of a statue. He said Micheaux embodied \"the best of what we all are as Americans\" and that the filmmaker was \"an inspiration.”\n\n\n\n"}

Its first chairman was the Tongan Methodist Sione 'Amanaki Havea, serving from 1966 to 1971.\n\nFrom very modest beginnings in the early 1960s, its membership is now numbered at about 27 Pacific member Churches and 11 National Council of Churches (NCCs).

{"id": "9382007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9382007", "title": "Religion in New Zealand", "text": "Religion in New Zealand\n\nReligion in New Zealand encompasses a wide range of groups and beliefs. Christianity is the most common religion with almost half (48 percent) of the population at the 2013 New Zealand census declaring an affiliation. Around six percent of the population affiliated with non-Christian religions, with Hinduism being the largest at over two percent, while 42 percent of New Zealanders stated they had no religion in the most recent census and 4 percent made no declaration.\n\nNew Zealand has no state religion or established church, although Anglicanism is required to be the religion of the Monarch of New Zealand (who is described as \"Defender of \"The\" Faith\"). Freedom of religion has been protected since the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.\n\nBefore European colonisation the religion of the indigenous Māori population was animistic, but the subsequent efforts of missionaries such as Samuel Marsden resulted in most Māori converting to Christianity. The majority of 19th-century European migrants came from the British Isles, establishing the three dominant denominations in New Zealand – Anglicanism, Catholicism and Presbyterianism. The tendency for Scottish migrants to settle in Otago and Southland saw Presbyterianism predominate in these regions while Anglicanism predominated elsewhere; the effect of this is still seen in religious affiliation statistics today. While 47.5 percent of New Zealanders affiliate with Christianity, regular church attendance is probably closer to 15%.\n\nThe number of people affiliated with Christianity has declined since the 1990s, and those stating that they have no religion have increased. With increased immigration to New Zealand, especially from Asia, the number of people affiliating with non-Christian religions has also increased.\n\nThe first Christian services conducted in New Zealand were carried out by Father Paul-Antoine Léonard de Villefeix, the Dominican chaplain on the ship \"Saint Jean Baptiste\" commanded by the French navigator and explorer Jean-François-Marie de Surville. Villefeix was the first Christian minister to set foot in New Zealand, and he celebrated Mass near Whatuwhiwhi in Doubtless Bay on Christmas Day in 1769. He is reported to have also led prayers for the sick the previous day and to have conducted Christian burials.\n\nNew Zealand's religious history after the arrival of Europeans saw substantial missionary activity, with Māori generally converting to Christianity voluntarily (compare forced conversions elsewhere in the world). The Church Missionary Society (CMS) sent missionaries to settle in New Zealand. Samuel Marsden of the Church Missionary Society (chaplain in New South Wales) officiated at its first service on Christmas Day in 1814, at Oihi Bay in the Bay of Islands. The CMS founded its first mission at Rangihoua in the Bay of Islands in 1814 and over the next decade established farms and schools in the area. In June 1823 Wesleydale, the first Wesleyan Methodist mission in New Zealand, was established near Whangaroa Harbour. Jean Baptiste Pompallier arrived in 1838 and became the first Catholic bishop in New Zealand. With a number of Marist Brothers, Pompallier organised the Catholic Church throughout the country. In 1892 the New Zealand Church Missionary Society (NZCMS) formed in a Nelson church hall and the first New Zealand missionaries were sent overseas soon after.\nThough in Britain the Anglican Church was an established state church, by the middle of the 19th century even the Anglicans themselves sometimes doubted this arrangement, while the other major denominations of the new colony (Presbyterians, Methodist and Catholics, for example) obviously preferred that the local set up allowed for all their groups. \n\nThe first recorded communal Jewish service in New Zealand was held on 7 January 1843 in Wellington, although individual Jews were amongst earlier explorers and settlers.\n\nWaves of new immigrants brought their particular (usually Christian) faiths with them. Initial denominational distribution very much reflected the fact that local immigrant communities started small and often came from comparatively small regions in the origin countries in Great Britain. As a result, by the time of the 1921 census, no uniform distribution existed amongst non-Māori Christians, with Presbyterians as the dominant group in Otago and Southland, Anglicans in the Far North, the East Cape and various other areas including Banks Peninsula, while Methodists flourished mainly in Taranaki and the Manawatu. Catholicism meanwhile was the dominant religion on the West Coast with its many mining concerns, and in Central Otago. The Catholic Church, while not particularly dominant in terms of pure numbers, became especially known throughout the country in the early and middle 20th century for its strong stance on education, establishing large numbers of schools.\n\nBeginning in the mid-1960s church membership and attendance declined, and in 2013 42% of the population said they had no religion. However, immigration since 1991 has seen the growth of new religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism growing rapidly. However, a large portion of the growth of these religions has occurred in Auckland.\n\nNew Zealand censuses have collected data on religious affiliation since 1851.\nStatistics New Zealand state that:\nOne complication in interpreting religious affiliation data in New Zealand is the large proportion who object to answering the question, roughly 173,000 respondents in 2013. Most reporting of percentages is based on the total number of responses, rather than the total population.\n\nIn the early 20th century New Zealand census data indicates that the vast majority of New Zealanders affiliated with Christianity. The total percentages in the 1921 non-Māori census were: 45% Anglicans, 19.9% Presbyterians, 13.6% Catholics, 9.5% Methodists and 11.2% Others. Statistics for Māori became available only from 1936, with 35.8% Anglicans, 19.9% Ratana, 13.9% Catholics, 7.2% Ringatu, 7.1% Methodists, 6.5% Latter Day Saints, 1.3% Methodists and 8.3% Others recorded at this census.\n\nThe population increased 7.8% between the 2006 and 2001 census. The most notable trend in religion over that time is the 26.2% increase in the number of people indicating no religion.\n\nThe table below is based on religious affiliation data recorded at the last three censuses for usually resident people. Note that figures and percentages may not add to 100 percent as it is possible for people to state more than one religion. Note also that the trend indicators are based on the change in percentage of the population, not the number of adherents.\n\nMirroring contemporary trends in immigration to New Zealand, immigrant religions increased fastest between the 2006 and 2013 censuses; Sikh by 102% to 19,191, Hindu by 39% to 89,319, Islam by 28% to 46,149, and Buddhist by 11% to 58,404. Hinduism emerged as the second-largest religious group in New Zealand after Christianity in the 2006 census. \n\nMainstream Christian denominations, while still representing the largest categories of census-categorised religious affiliation, have not kept pace with population increases. While New Zealand's total population increased from 4,027,947 in 2006 to 4,242,048 in 2013, Anglican numbers fell by 95,154 to 459,771 (11.79% of the overall population) over the same period, and Presbyterian adherents decreased by 69,936 to 330,903 (8.47%). Catholic numbers decreased by 16,053 to 492,384 (12.61%). The only other religious groups above 100,000 members are \"Christian (not further defined)\" and Methodist. Compare this with numbers in 1901, when 42% of people identified with the Anglican denomination, 23% with Presbyterianism, and 14% with Catholicism. At that time 1 in 30 people did not identify with any religion - compared with 1 in 3 .\n\nOf the major ethnic groups in New Zealand, people belonging to European and Māori ethnicities were the most likely to be irreligious, with 46.9 percent and 46.3 percent stating so in the 2013 census. Those belonging to Pacific and Middle Eastern/Latin American/African were least likely to be irreligious at 17.5 percent and 17.0 percent respectively.\n\nIn 2008 Massey University conducted an International Social Survey Programme survey in New Zealand. Around one thousand New Zealanders above the age of 18 sent mail responses to questions on religious belief and practice. Results indicated that 27% of the population strongly believed in God, 45% believed in God or a higher power at least some of the time or to some extent, 15% were agnostic, and 13% were atheist (with a 3% margin of error).\n\nImmigration and settlement trends have created religious differences between the regions of New Zealand. The 19th-century settlement of Scottish immigrants in Otago and Southland is still reflected today in the dominance of Presbyterianism in the lower South Island. The English mainly settled in the North Island and Upper South Island, reflecting the dominance of Anglicanism in these areas.\n\nIn the 2013 census, two of New Zealand's sixteen regions had a Christian majority: Southland (51.9 percent) and Hawke's Bay (50.5 percent) and two regions had a non-religious majority: Tasman (51.4 percent) and Nelson (51.0 percent).\n\nEncouraged by an informal email campaign, over 53,000 people listed themselves as Jedi in New Zealand's 2001 census (over 1.5% of responses). If the Jedi response had been accepted as valid it would have been the largest non-Christian religion in New Zealand, and second-largest religion overall. However, Statistics New Zealand treated Jedi responses as \"Answer understood, but will not be counted\". The city of Dunedin (a university town) had the highest population of reported Jedi per capita. In the 2006 census only 20,000 people gave Jedi as their religion.\n\nAfter the arrival of large numbers of European immigrants (most of whom were British), Māori enthusiastically adopted Christianity in the early 19th century, and to this day, Christian prayer (karakia) is the expected way to begin and end Māori public gatherings of many kinds. Christianity became the major religion of the country, with the Anglican, Catholic and Presbyterian churches all establishing themselves strongly. The arrival of other groups of immigrants did little to change this, as Pacific Islanders and other primarily Christian ethnic groups dominated immigration until the 1970s.\n\nIn the following decades, Christianity declined somewhat in percentage terms, mostly due to people declaring themselves as having no religion as well as by the growth of non-Christian religions. The five largest Christian denominations in 2001 remained the largest in 2006. The Catholic and Methodist denominations increased, but the Anglican denomination, the Presbyterian, Congregation and Reformed denomination, and undefined Christian denominations decreased. While smaller groups, there were larger percentage increases in affiliations with other Christian denominations between 2001 and 2006: Orthodox Christian religions increased by 37.8 percent, affiliation with Evangelical, Born Again and Fundamentalist religions increased by 25.6 percent, and affiliation with Pentecostal religions increased by 17.8 percent.\n\nDespite strong affiliation to Christianity by New Zealanders throughout the country's history, church attendance in New Zealand has never been high compared to other Western nations. Estimates of church attendance today range from 10–20%, while research by the Bible Society of New Zealand in 2008 indicated that 15% of New Zealanders attend church at least once a week, and 20% attend at least once a month. \n\nIslam in New Zealand began with the arrival of Muslim Chinese gold prospectors in the 1870s. The first Islamic organisation in New Zealand, the New Zealand Muslim Association, was established in Auckland in 1950. 1960 saw the arrival of the first imam, Maulana Said Musa Patel, from Gujarat, India. Large-scale Muslim immigration began in the 1970s with the arrival of Fiji Indians, followed in the 1990s by refugees from various war-torn countries. In April 1979 the three regional Muslim organisations of Canterbury, Wellington and Auckland, joined together to create the only national Islamic body – the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand. Early in the 1990s many migrants were admitted under New Zealand's refugee quota, from war zones in Somalia, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Kosovo and Iraq. Since the 11 September attacks there was a spike in conversions to Islam among Maori prisoners in jail.\n\nAt the 2013 census, 1.2 percent of the population, or 46,150 people, identified themselves as Muslim. Over two-thirds (67.5 percent) live in the Auckland region. Just over one-quarter (25.7 percent) are New Zealand born.\n\nThe history of the Jews here begins in the 1830s including noted early settler Joel Samuel Polack and continued to grow from immigration. Prominent New Zealand Jews in history include 19th-century Premier Julius Vogel and at least five Auckland mayors, including Dove-Myer Robinson. Former Prime Minister John Key of the National Party is of part Ashkenazi Jewish descent, although he does not practice Judaism.\n\nThe 2013 census found there was a Jewish population of 6,867, an increase from the 2001 census figure of 6,636.\n\nThe majority of New Zealand Jews reside in Auckland and Wellington, though there is also a significant Jewish community in Dunedin which is believed to have the world's southernmost permanent synagogue. In 2006, 0.2% of the population identified as Jewish/Judaism.\n\nThe first Bahá'í in the Antipodes was Englishwoman Dorothea Spinney who arrived in Auckland from New York in 1912. About 1913 there were two converts – Robert Felkin who had met `Abdu'l-Bahá in London in 1911 and moved to New Zealand in 1912 and is considered a Bahá'í by 1914 and Margaret Stevenson who first heard of the religion in 1911 and by her own testimony was a Bahá'í in 1913. The first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1926 and their first independent National Spiritual Assembly in 1957. By 1963 there were four Assemblies. At the 2006 census 0.07% of the population, or 2,772 people, identified themselves as Bahá'í. There are some 45 local assemblies and smaller registered groups.\n\nAt the 2006 census around 5% of the New Zealand population affiliated to a non-Christian religion. Statistics New Zealand report that about 80% of the largest non-Christian religious groups are composed of immigrants, almost half of whom have arrived in New Zealand since 2000. The exceptions to this are traditional Maori religion, Judaism (24% immigrant) and Bahá'í (20% immigrant).\n\nTraditional Māori religion, that is, the pre-European belief system of the Māori, was little modified in its essentials from that of their tropical Eastern Polynesian homeland, conceiving of everything, including natural elements and all living things, as connected by common descent through whakapapa or genealogy. Accordingly, all things were thought of as possessing a life force or \"mauri\". Very few Māori still identify themselves as adhering to traditional Māori beliefs (2,412 people at the 2006 census).\n\nTwo specific Māori branches of Christianity, Rātana and Ringatū are widely followed by many in the Māori community.\n\nHinduism is the second largest religion in New Zealand after Christianity, with over 89,000 adherents according to the 2013 census. The number of Hindus in New Zealand grew modestly until the 1990s when the Immigration Act 1987, the Immigration Amendment Act 1991 and India's Economic Liberalisation in 1991 changed immigration laws and India's standard of living. The eased immigration laws resulted in the number of Hindus growing from 18,000 in 1991 to 40,000 in 2001. Hinduism currently makes up 2.1% of the New Zealand population, and is the fast growing religion in the country(for religions with more than 20,000 adherents). The growth of Hinduism has been in almost in line with Indian immigration, which has resulted in various Ethnic Enclaves (known as Little India) appearing.\n\nBuddhism is the third largest religion in New Zealand, at 1.3% of the population. In 2007 the NZ$20 million Fo Guang Shan Temple was opened in Auckland for the promotion of Humanistic Buddhism. It is the largest Buddhist temple in New Zealand.\n\nSikhs have been in New Zealand for more than a century, with the first arriving in Hamilton in the 1880s. The Sikhs grew almost four-fold between 2001 and 2013 and comprised 0.43% of the population as of 2013. Today they have a strong presence in Auckland, and especially in South Auckland and Manukau with the current National Party's Member of Parliament for Manukau Kanwal Singh Bakshi being a Sikh.\nThere were thirteen gurdwaras (the Sikh place of worship) in New Zealand in 2010. The largest Sikh Gurdwara, the NZ$10million Kalgidhar Sahib, is situated in Auckland at Takanini.\n\nThis collection of religious beliefs is represented by around 0.5% of the New Zealand population.\n\nAlthough New Zealand is a largely secular country, religion finds a place in many cultural traditions. Major Christian events like Christmas and Easter are official public holidays and are celebrated by religious and non-religious alike, as in many countries around the world. The country's national anthem, God Defend New Zealand, mentions God in both its name and its lyrics. There has been occasional controversy over the degree of separation of church and state, for example the practice of prayer and religious instruction at school assemblies.\n\nThe architectural landscape of New Zealand attests to the historical importance of Christianity in New Zealand with church buildings prominent in cities, towns and the countryside. Notable Cathedrals include the Anglican Holy Trinity Cathedral, Auckland, ChristChurch Cathedral, Christchurch and Saint Paul's Cathedral, Wellington and the Catholic St Patrick's Cathedral, Auckland, Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Hamilton, Cathedral of the Holy Spirit, Palmerston North, Sacred Heart Cathedral, Wellington, Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, Christchurch, St. Joseph's Cathedral, Dunedin. The iconic Futuna Chapel was built as a Wellington retreat center for the Catholic Marist order in 1961. The design by Maori architect John Scott, fuses Modernist and indigenous design principles.\n\nChristian and Maori choral traditions have been blended in New Zealand to produce a distinct contribution to Christian music, including the popular hymns Whakaria Mai and Tama Ngakau Marie. New Zealand hosts one of the largest Christian music festivals in the Southern Hemisphere, the Parachute Music Festival.\n\nReligion has played and continues to play a 'significant and sometimes controversial role' in the politics of New Zealand. Although most New Zealanders today consider politicians' religious beliefs to be a private matter, a large number of New Zealand Prime Ministers have been professing Christians, including Jenny Shipley, Jim Bolger, Geoffrey Palmer, David Lange, Robert Muldoon, Walter Nash, Keith Holyoake, and Michael Joseph Savage. Former Prime Ministers John Key and Helen Clark were agnostic. The newly-former Prime Minister Bill English is Catholic and has acknowledged that religious groups should contribute to political discourse. Sir Paul Reeves, Anglican Archbishop and Primate of New Zealand from 1980 to 1985, was appointed Governor-General from 1985 to 1990.\n\nMurray Smith was a member of the New Zealand Parliament from 1972 to 1975. His interest in governance continued when he later enrolled in the Bahá’í Faith and contributed in national and international roles within the Bahá'í Community.\n\nChristian political parties have usually not gained significant support, a notable exception being the Christian Coalition (New Zealand) polling 4.4% in the 1996 general election. Christian parties have often been characterised by controversy and public disgrace. Many of these are now defunct, such as the Christian Democrat Party, the Christian Heritage Party which discontinued in 2006 after former leader Graham Capill was convicted as a child sex offender, Destiny New Zealand, The Family Party and the New Zealand Pacific Party whose leader, former New Zealand Labour Party MP Taito Phillip Field was convicted on bribery and corruption charges. United Future has been more successful, which although not a Christian party has had significant Christian backing. The two main political parties, Labour and National, are not religious, although religious groups have at times played a significant role (e.g. the Ratana Movement). Politicians are often involved in public dialogue with religious groups. The Exclusive Brethren gained public notoriety during the 2005 election for distributing anti-Labour pamphlets, which former National Party leader Don Brash later admitted to knowledge of.\n\nNew Zealand has no established church. However the following anomalies exist:\n\nAt the discussions leading to the Treaty of Waitangi Governor Hobson made a statement (which had no particular legal or constitutional significance) concerning freedom of religion (sometimes called the 'fourth' article). In 2007, the government issued a National Statement on Religious Diversity containing in its first clause \"New Zealand has no official or established religion.\" The statement caused controversy in some quarters, opponents arguing that New Zealand's head of state Queen Elizabeth II is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. However, the Queen does not act in that capacity as the Queen of New Zealand; although she retains the styling of Defender of the Faith within her official title in that role. A poll of 501 New Zealanders in June 2007 found that 58% of respondents did not think Christianity should be New Zealand's official religion.\n\nNew Zealand's parliament opens its proceedings with a specifically Christian prayer. In 2007 parliament voted to retain the Christian prayer.\n\nHowever, there has been increasing recognition of Māori spirituality in political discourse and even in certain government legislation. In July 2001 MP Rodney Hide alerted parliament to a state funded \"hikitapu\" (\"tapu\"-lifting) ceremony at the opening of the foreign embassy in Bangkok. It was revealed that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade had a standard policy of employing Māori ritual experts for the opening of official offices around the world. The Resource Management Act 1991 recognises the role of Māori spiritual beliefs in planning and environmental management. In 2002 local Māori expressed concerns that the development of the Auckland-Waikato expressway would disturb the \"taniwha\", or guardian spirit, of the Waikato River, leading to delays and alterations to the project.\n\nBlasphemous libel is a crime in New Zealand, but cases can only be prosecuted with the approval of the Attorney-General and the defence of opinion is allowed: \"It is not an offence against this section to express in good faith and in decent language, or to attempt to establish by arguments used in good faith and conveyed in decent language, any opinion whatever on any religious subject.\" The only prosecution, in 1922, was unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "622794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=622794", "title": "Rumer Godden", "text": "Rumer Godden\n\nMargaret Rumer Godden (10 December 1907 – 8 November 1998) was an English author of more than 60 fiction and nonfiction books written under the name of Rumer Godden. Nine of her works have been made into films, most notably \"Black Narcissus\" in 1947.\n\nA few of her works were co-written with her older sister, novelist Jon Godden, including \"Two Under the Indian Sun\", a memoir of the Goddens' childhood in a region of India now part of Bangladesh.\n\nGodden was born in Eastbourne, Sussex, England. She grew up with her three sisters in Narayanganj, colonial India (now in Bangladesh), where her father, a shipping company executive, worked for the Brahmaputra Steam Navigation Company. Her parents sent the girls to England for schooling, as was the custom of the time, but brought them back to Narayanganj when the First World War began. Godden returned to the United Kingdom with her sisters to continue her interrupted schooling in 1920, spending time at Moira House Girls School in Eastbourne and eventually training as a dance teacher. She went back to Calcutta in 1925 and opened a dance school for English and Indian children. Godden ran the school for 20 years with the help of her sister Nancy. During this time she published her first best-seller, the 1939 novel \"Black Narcissus\".\n\nIn 1942, after eight years in an unhappy marriage (one she entered into in 1934 because she was pregnant), she moved with her two daughters, Jane and Paula, (her husband Laurence Foster having joined the army) to Kashmir, living first on a houseboat and then in a rented house where she started a farm. After a mysterious incident in which it appeared that an attempt had been made to poison both her and her daughters, she returned to Calcutta in 1944; the novel \"Kingfishers Catch Fire\" was based on her time in Kashmir. She returned to the United Kingdom in 1945 to concentrate on her writing, frequently moving house but living mostly in Sussex and London, and was divorced in 1948. After returning from America to oversee the script for the movie of her book \"The River\", Godden married civil servant James Haynes Dixon on 26November 1949.\n\nIn the early 1950s Godden became interested in the Catholic Church, though she did not officially convert until 1968, and several of her later novels contain sympathetic portrayals of Catholic priests and nuns. In addition to \"Black Narcissus\", two of her books deal with the subject of women in religious communities. In \"Five for Sorrow, Ten for Joy\" and \"In This House of Brede\" she acutely examined the balance between the mystical, spiritual aspects of religion and the practical, human realities of religious life.\n\nA number of Godden's novels are set in India, the atmosphere of which she evokes through all the senses; her writing is vivid with detail of smells, textures, light, flowers, noises and tactile experiences. Her books for children, especially her several doll stories, strongly convey the secret thoughts, confusions, disappointments and aspirations of childhood. Her plots often involve unusual young people not recognized for their talents by ordinary lower- or middle-class people but supported by the educated, rich, and upper-class, to the anger, resentment, and puzzlement of their relatives. She won a 1972 Whitbread award for \"The Diddakoi\", a young adult novel about Gypsies, televised by the BBC as \"Kizzy\".\n\nIn 1968 she took the tenancy of Lamb House in Rye, East Sussex, where she lived until the death of her husband in 1973. She moved to Moniaive in Dumfriesshire in 1978, when she was 70, to be near her daughter Jane. She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1993. She visited India once more, in 1994, returning to Kashmir for the filming of a BBC \"Bookmark\" documentary about her life and books.\n\nRumer Godden died on 8 November 1998 at the age of 90 after a series of strokes; her ashes were buried with those of her second husband in Rye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "265799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=265799", "title": "Scientology beliefs and practices", "text": "Scientology beliefs and practices\n\nThe Church of Scientology says that a human is an immortal, spiritual being (thetan) that is resident in a physical body. The thetan has had innumerable past lives and it is observed in advanced Scientology texts that lives preceding the thetan's arrival on Earth were lived in extraterrestrial cultures. Based on case studies at advanced levels, it is predicted that any Scientologist undergoing auditing will eventually come across and recount a common series of events.\n\nAccording to the Church, founder L. Ron Hubbard's discovery of the thetan places Scientology at the heart of the human quest for meaning, and proves that \"its origins are as ancient as religious thought itself.\" However, Scientology considers that its understanding of the thetan distinguishes it from other religious traditions, especially Judaism and Christianity, in three important ways. First, while many religions fuse the concept of the body and the soul, the thetan (spirit) is separate and independent. Second, unlike the three great world monotheisms, Scientologists believe in past lives and that the thetan has lived through many, perhaps thousands of lifetimes. Third, contrary to Christian concepts of original sin, Scientology holds to the intrinsic goodness of a being and believes that the spiritual essence has lost touch with its nature. \"The spirit, then, is not a thing,\" Hubbard writes. \"It is the creator of things.\"\n\nScientology describes itself as the study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself, others, and all of life. Scientologists also believe that people have innate, yet suppressed, power and ability which can be regained if cleared of enforced and unwanted behaviour patterns and discomforts. Scientology is described as \"a religion to help people use scientific approaches to self-actualize their full potential.\" Believers reach their full potential \"when they understand themselves in their true relationship to the physical universe and the Supreme Being. \" There have been many scholarly studies of Scientology and the books are freely available in bookshops, churches and most libraries.\n\nThe Church of Scientology believes that \"Man is basically good, that he is seeking to survive, (and) that his survival depends on himself and his attainment of brotherhood with the universe,\" as stated in the Creed of the Church of Scientology.\n\nRoy Wallis of Columbia University describes Scientology as \"a movement that straddles the boundaries between psychology and religion, [offering] a graded hierarchy of 'auditing' and training\" with the intention of releasing the individual's full potential.\n\nScientology does not require that their members must exclusively believe in Scientology, distinguishing it from biblical religions. Scientologists may profess belief in other religions, such as Protestantism and Catholicism, and may participate in their activities and sacred rites. Jacob Neusner emphasizes this in the section on Scientology in his book \"World Religions in America.\" According to J. Gordon Melton, \"Scientologists aim to utterly make the world instead of taking refuge from it,\" as they participate in culture instead of being isolated. Scientology is inherently nondenominational and open to individuals, regardless of religious background; according to Mary A. Mann, it contains the elements necessary for a global religion and caters to people of all different ethnicities and educational upbringing.\n\nWilson writes that Scientology \"constitutes a religious system set forth in the terms of scientific discourse.\" Hubbard similarly states that \"along with science, Scientology can achieve positive invariable results. Given the same conditions, one always get the same results ... What has happened is the superstition has been subtracted from spiritual studies.\"\n\nAmong the basic tenets of Scientology are the beliefs that human beings are immortal, that a person's life experience transcends a single lifetime, and that human beings possess infinite capabilities. Scientology presents two major divisions of the mind. The \"reactive mind\" is thought to absorb all pain and emotional trauma, while the \"analytical mind\" is a rational mechanism which is responsible for consciousness. The reactive mind stores mental images which are not readily available to the analytical (conscious) mind; these are referred to as \"engrams\". Engrams are painful and debilitating; as they accumulate, people move further away from their true identity. Avoiding this fate is Scientology's basic goal. Dianetic auditing is one way by which the Scientologist may progress toward the \"Clear\" state, winning gradual freedom from the reactive mind's engrams, and acquiring certainty of his or her reality as a thetan. Hubbard's differentiation of the reactive mind and the analytical mind forms one of the basic tenets of Dianetics. The analytical mind is similar to the conscious mind, which processes daily information and events. The reactive mind produces the mind's \"aberrations\" such as \"fear, inhibition, intense love and hate and various psychosomatic ills\" which are recorded as \"engrams.\"\n\nScientology believes that people have hidden abilities which have not yet been fully realized. It is believed that increased spiritual awareness and physical benefits are accomplished through counseling sessions referred to as \"auditing\". Through auditing, it is said that people can solve their problems and free themselves of engrams. This restores them to their natural condition as thetans and enables them to be \"at cause\" in their daily lives, responding rationally and creatively to life events rather than reacting to them under the direction of stored engrams. Accordingly, those who study Scientology materials and receive auditing sessions advance from a status of \"Preclear\" to \"Clear\" and \"Operating Thetan\". Scientology's utopian aim is to \"clear the planet\", a world in which everyone has cleared themselves of their engrams.\n\nAuditing is a one-on-one session with a Scientology counselor or \"auditor.\" It bears a superficial similarity to confession or pastoral counseling, but the auditor records and stores all information received and does not dispense forgiveness or advice the way a pastor or priest might do. Instead, the auditor's task is to help a person discover and understand engrams, and their limiting effects, for him- or herself. Most auditing requires an E-meter, a device that measures minute changes in electrical resistance through the body when a person holds electrodes (metal \"cans\"), and a small current is passed through them.\n\nScientology believes that watching for changes in the E-meter's display helps locate engrams. Once an area of concern has been identified, the auditor asks the individual specific questions about it, in order to help him or her eliminate the engram, and uses the E-meter to confirm that the engram's \"charge\" has been dissipated and the engram has in fact been cleared. As the individual progresses, the focus of auditing moves from simple engrams to engrams of increasing complexity. At the more advanced OT auditing levels, Scientologists perform solo auditing sessions, acting as their own auditors.\n\nOne central practice of Scientology is an activity known as \"auditing\" (listening) which seeks to elevate an adherent to a state of \"clear\", one of freedom from the influences of the reactive mind. The practice is one wherein a counselor called an \"auditor\" addresses a series of questions to a preclear, observes and records the preclear's responses, and acknowledges them. An important element in all forms of auditing is to not suggest answers to the preclear or invalidate or degrade what the preclear says in response. It is of utmost importance the auditor create a truly safe and distraction-free environment for the session.\n\nThe term \"Clear\" is derived from a button on a calculator that deletes previous calculations. According to Scientology beliefs, Clears are \"optimal individuals\" and \"they have been cleared of false information and memories of traumatic experiences that prevent them from adapting to the world around them in a natural and appropriate fashion.\" Scientologists believe that clears become more successful in their daily lives, \"be healthier, experience less stress, and possess better communication skills.\"\n\n\"Auditing\" is sometimes seen as controversial, because auditing sessions are permanently recorded and stored within what are called \"preclear folders\". Scientologists believe that the practice of auditing helps them overcome the debilitating effects of traumatic experiences, most of which have accumulated over a multitude of lifetimes. The folders are kept in accordance with the Priest/Penitent legal parameters which do not allow these folders to be seen or used for any other purpose or seen by any others who are not directly involved in supervising that person's auditing progress.\n\nAuditors are required to become proficient with the use of their E-meters. The device measures the subject's galvanic skin response in a manner similar to a polygraph (lie detector), but with only one electrode per hand rather than multiple sensors. The E-meter is primarily used in auditing, which \"aims to remove (engrams) to produce a state of 'clear.'\" Auditors do not receive final certification until they have successfully completed an internship, and have demonstrated a proven ability in the skills they have been trained in. Auditors often practice their auditing with each other, as well as friends or family. Church members pair up often to get their training, doing the same course at the same time, so that they can audit each other up through the various Scientology levels.\n\nAccording to scholar Harriet Whitehead, the Church of Scientology \"has developed a fine-tooled hierarchically organized system of audit (training) sessions where the technology of these sessions, in fact, is the treatment leading to processes of renunciation and eventually reformulation in the individual,\" which is similar to psychoanalysis.\n\nScientology uses an emotional classification system called the \"tone scale\". The tone scale is a tool used in auditing; Scientologists maintain that knowing a person's place on the scale makes it easier to predict his or her actions and assists in bettering his or her condition.\n\nScientology emphasizes the importance of \"survival\", which it subdivides into eight classifications that are referred to as \"dynamics\". An individual's desire to survive is considered to be the first dynamic, while the second dynamic relates to procreation and family. The remaining dynamics encompass wider fields of action, involving groups, mankind, all life, the physical universe, the spirit, and the Infinity, often associated with the Supreme Being. The optimum solution to any problem is held to be the one that brings the greatest benefit to the greatest number of dynamics.\n\nThe ARC and KRC triangles are concept maps which show a relationship among three concepts to form another concept. These two triangles are present in the Scientology logo.\n\nThe KRC triangle is the uppermost triangle. It combines the components of \"Knowledge\" \"Responsibility\" and \"Control\". A Scientologist must gain \"Knowledge\" of, take \"Responsibility\" for, and effectively exert \"Control\" over elements of his or her environment.\n\nThe ARC triangle is the lower triangle. It is a summary representation of the knowledge the Scientologist strives for. It combines three components: \"Affinity\" is the degree of affection, love or liking, i.e. an emotional state. \"Reality\" reflects consensual reality, that is agreements on what is real. \"Communication\", believed to be the most important element of the triangle, is the exchange of ideas. Scientologists believe that improving one of the three aspects of the ARC triangle \"increases the level\" of the other two but the most important aspect of this triangle is \"communication\" mainly because communication drives the other two aspects: \"affinity\" and \"reality\". Scientologists believe that ineffective communication is a chief cause of human survival problems, and this is reflected by efforts at all levels within the movement to ensure clear communication, the presence of unabridged standard dictionaries for example being an established feature of Scientology centers. Scientologists believe that the three elements are fundamental between individuals “in that to communicate with a person one must have some affinity for him or her,” as Dorthe Refslund Christensen describes it. According to Scientology doctrine, the break in the flow of ARC that hinders survival must be handled in auditing.\n\nThe two triangles are connected by a letter \"S\", standing for SCIO (Latin > \"I Know\"). Church of Scientology doctrine defines \"scio\" as 'knowing in the fullest sense of the word'. It links the two triangles together.\n\nHubbard introduced the Scientology cross in the 1950s as the central symbol for the church. He described the eight points of the cross as symbolizing the \"eight dynamics\" or eight measures for survival that all human beings have, which includes the urge to service as a spiritual being and the urge to survive as a godlike entity. Hubbard writes that survival is moving away from death and towards immortality, and that human beings are constantly on the search for feelings of pleasure and motivated by the avoidance of pain.\n\n\nAccording to L. Ron Hubbard's book \"The History of Man\", published in 1952, there are two entities housed by the human body, a genetic entity (whose purpose is to carry on the evolutionary line) and a \"Thetan\" or consciousness \"that has the capacity to separate from body and mind.\" According to Hubbard, \"In man's long evolutionary development the Thetan has been trapped by the engrams formed at various stages of embodiment.\" Scientology training is aimed at clearing the person of all engrams, thus creating an \"Operating Thetan.\" \"Among the abilities of the Operating Thetan is the soul's capacity to leave and operate apart from the body.\"\n\nPeople are viewed as spiritual beings that have minds and bodies and a person's \"spiritual essence\" is called the \"Thetan\". Scientology teaches that \"a thetan is the person himself, not his body or his name or the physical universe, his mind or anything else.\" According to the doctrine, \"one does not have a thetan, he is a thetan.\"\n\nExteriorization is a practice in which a thetan functions independently of the physical body, sometimes as a result of auditing process R2-45. According to Lawrence Wright, author of “Going Clear,” exteriorization “is the sense that one has actually left his physical being behind,” and a commonly reported occurrence among Scientologists.\n\nIn Scientology, the human body is regarded as similar to that of other religions in that, at death, the spirit will leave the body. \"Life and personality go on. The physical part of the organism ceases to function.\" \n\nScientology believes in the \"immortality of each individual's spirit,\" therefore making death not a significant worry. The spirit acquires another body necessary for growth and survival. To achieve an individual's true identity is the primary goal.\n\nAccording to Scientology beliefs, Scientology itself is a blend of science and spirituality, with belief in an immortal spirit and in improving that spirit here on Earth using Scientology's methods. Scientologists do not typically dwell on Heaven or Hell or the afterlife, instead focusing on the spirit. Many Scientologists also belong to other churches.\n\nAccording to Scientology doctrine, salvation is achieved through “clearing” engrams and implant, the source of human misery, through the auditing process. Salvation is limited to the current life and there is no “final salvation or damnation,” author Richard Holloway writes. “Life is a not a one-shot deal. There is only the eternal return of life after life.” According to Scientology beliefs, \"the individual comes back. He has a responsibility for what goes on today since he will experience it tomorrow.\"\n\nIn the Scientology book, \"A History of Man\", Hubbard discusses that a human's past experiences make up that person's present identity. These include experiences as atoms, seaweed, plankton and clams, pointing to the belief in recurring lives.\n\nThe Church of Scientology states that it has no set dogma on God and allows individuals to come to their own understanding of God. In Scientology, \"vastly more emphasis is given to the godlike nature of the person and to the workings of the human mind than to the nature of God.\" Hubbard did not clearly define God in Scientology. When pressed about their belief, Scientologists mention the \"eight dynamic\" which they say is the \"God dynamic\".\n\nScientologists believe in an \"Infinity\" (\"the All-ness of All\"). They recite a formal prayer for total freedom at meetings, which include the verses \"May the author of the universe enable all men to reach an understanding of their spiritual nature. May awareness and understanding of life expand, so that all may come to know the author of the universe. And may others also reach this understanding which brings Total Freedom ... Freedom from war, and poverty, and want; freedom to be; freedom to do and freedom to have. Freedom to use and understand Man's potential – a potential that is God-given and Godlike.\" The prayer commences with \"May God let it be so.\"\nScientologists affirm the existence of a deity without defining or describing its nature. L. Ron Hubbard explains in his book \"Science of Survival\", \"No culture in the history of the world, save the thoroughly depraved and expiring ones, has failed to affirm the existence of a Supreme Being. It is an empirical observation that men without a strong and lasting faith in a Supreme Being are less capable, less ethical and less valuable.\" Instead of defining God, members assert that reaching higher states of enlightenment will enable individuals to make their own conclusions about the Supreme Being.\n\nThe church considers itself scientific, although this belief has no basis in institutional science. According to religious scholar Mikael Rothstein Scientologists believe that \"all religious claims can be verified through experimentation\". Scientologists believe that their religion was derived through scientific methods, that Hubbard found knowledge through studying and thinking, not through revelation. The \"science\" of Dianetics, however, was never accepted by the scientific community. Rothstein also writes that there is a possibility that Scientology partly owes its existence to the conflict with the conventional scientific community, which hindered Hubbard’s original intention. Religious scholar Dorthe Refslund Christensen notes that Scientology differs from the scientific method in that Scientology has become increasingly self-referential, while true science normally compares competing theories and observed facts.\n\nHubbard originally claimed and insisted that Dianetics was based on the scientific method. He taught that \"the scientific sensibilities [carry] over into the spiritual realities one encounters via auditing on the e-meter.\" Scientologists commonly prefer to describe Hubbard's teachings with words such as knowledge, technology and workability rather than belief or faith. Hubbard described Dianetics and Scientology as \"technologies\" based on his claim of their \"scientific precision and workability.\" Hubbard attempted to \"break down the barrier between scientific (objective, external) and religious (subjective, internal) forms of knowledge.\" Hubbard describes Scientology's epistemology as \"radically subjective: Nothing in Scientology is true for you unless you have observed it and it is true according to our observation.\" This is a type of self-legitimation through science which is also found in other religions such as Christian Science, Religious Science, and Moorish Science Temple of America.\n\nSociologist William Sims Bainbridge cites Scientology's origins in the subcultures of science fiction and \"harmony\" with scientific cosmology. Science fiction, viewed to work for and against the purposes of science, has contributed to the birth of new religions, including Scientology. While it promotes science, it distorts it as well. Science fiction writer A.E. van Vogt based the early development of Dianetics and Scientology on a novel based on General Semantics, a pseudoscience created by Alfred Korzybski for the purpose of curing personal and social issues.\n\nMembers of the Church believe that Hubbard \"discovered the existential truths that form their doctrine through research,\" thus leading to the idea that Scientology is science. Hubbard created what the church would call a \"spiritual technology\" to advance the goals of Scientology. According to the church, \"Scientology works 100 percent of the time when it is properly applied to a person who sincerely desires to improve his life.\" The underlying claims are that Scientology is \"exact\" and \"certain.\" Michael Shermer, writing for \"Scientific American\" in 2011, said that Scientology's methods lacked enough study to qualify as a science, but that the story of Xenu and Scientology's other creation myths were no less tenable than other religions.\n\nB. Hubbard, J. Hatfield and J. Santucci compare Scientology's view of humanity to the Yogachara school of Buddhism, saying that both have been described as \"the most scientific\" among new and traditional religions respectively. B. Hubbard et al. cite the use of technical language and the claim that teachings were developed through observation and experimentation. They also emphasize that many investigators and researchers consider Scientology to be a pseudoscience because of its absolute and meta-empirical goals.\n\nScholar Kocku von Stuckrad stated that Scientology is an example of the phenomenon of both the “scientification of religion” and the “sacralization” of science. Donald A. Westbrook elaborates that there is apparently an “ongoing and dialectical relationship” between religion and science in Hubbard’s teachings.\n\nAccording to \"Among the Scientologists: History, Theology and Praxis\", the e-meter is the most prominent signifying tool of Scientology’s scientific leanings and claim to being technology. It is essentially a tool in mental and spiritual counseling or Auditing.\n\nThe Bridge to Total Freedom is the means by which Scientologists undertake personal development. Processing is the actual practice of auditing which directs questions towards areas of travail in a person's life to get rid of barriers that inhibit his or her natural abilities. This process is supposed to bring greater happiness, intelligence and success. Training is also given in the process of auditing others. The Bridge to Total Freedom is considered a metaphor for the spiritual life of the believer, and is also a detailed outline of the process a Scientologist undergoes in order to develop spirituality. It follows a strict hierarchy with ascending levels.\n\nThe main goal of the first stage is to be freed from limitations of the MEST universe (MEST standing for matter, energy, space and time), while the second stage is about regaining creative powers as a spiritual being which have been lost according to the teachings of Scientology.\n\nScientology is publicly, and often vehemently, opposed to both psychiatry and psychology. Scientologists view psychiatry as a barbaric and corrupt profession and encourage alternative care based on spiritual healing.\nThe psychiatric establishment rejected Hubbard's theories in the early 1950s. Ever since, Scientology has argued that psychiatry suffers from the fundamental flaw of ignoring humanity's spiritual dimension, and that it fails to take into account Hubbard's insights about the nature of the mind. Scientology holds psychiatry responsible for a great many wrongs in the world, saying it has at various times offered itself as a tool of political suppression and \"that psychiatry spawned the ideology which fired Hitler's mania, turned the Nazis into mass murderers, and created the Holocaust.\"\n\nThe anti-psychiatry organization Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) was founded by Hubbard in 1969. It operates , an anti-psychiatry museum.\n\nThrough CCHR, Scientology has made claims of psychiatric abuse. The anti-psychiatry organization has had political accomplishments: In 1986, it published a manifesto against psychiatry and psychotropic medication, which was included in a document by the United Nations which saw wide circulation; In 2006, a bill drafted by the group was passed by the Arizona senate \"mandating an additional consent form be presented to subjects considering participation in psychiatric research.\" The form in question \"differentiates real disease from mental illness.\" A similar CCHR bill was rejected by the Florida house, \"mandating that a long, ominous-sounding statement about the dangers of psychoactive drugs be presented to parents prior to school referral for mental health evaluation.\" The movement has gained momentum across the US.\n\nScientology teaches that progress on The Bridge to Total Freedom requires and enables the attainment of high moral and ethical standards. According to Hubbard, the goal of ethics is to remove impediments to survival, and ethics is essentially a tool to \"get technology in\", meaning Scientology's use of the term technology. Stephen A. Kent describes Scientology ethics as \"a peculiar brand of morality that uniquely benefitted [the Church of Scientology] ... In plain English, the purpose of Scientology ethics is to eliminate opponents, then eliminate people's interests in things other than Scientology. In this 'ethical' environment, Scientology would be able to impose its courses, philosophy, and 'justice system' — its so-called technology — onto society.\"\n\nScientology's system of ethics is designed to motivate members to expand the church, as members' ethical level is tied to their performance in recruiting new members.\n\nThe church makes it clear that Hubbard is considered the sole source of Dianetics and Scientology: \"The Scientology religion is based exclusively upon L. Ron Hubbard's research, writings and recorded lectures – all of which constitute the Scriptures of the religion.\" His work, recorded in 500,000 pages of writings, 6,500 reels of tape and 42 films, is archived for posterity. The Religious Technology Center holds \"the ultimate ecclesiastical authority and the pure application of L. Ron Hubbard's religious technologies.\"\n\nIndividuals applying Hubbard's techniques who are not officially connected to the Church of Scientology are considered part of the \"Free Zone\". Some of these individuals were litigated against for using and modifying the practices for their own use and that of others, thereby infringing the law on patent, trademarks, or trade secrets.\n\nScientologists avoid the terms as “belief” or “faith” in describing the body of Scientology knowledge and its purpose in their lives. They use “knowing” and “reality” and the “efficacy of the technology” to describe their religion.\n\nThe Purification Rundown is a controversial detoxification program developed by Scientology's founder L. Ron Hubbard and used by the Church of Scientology as an introductory service. Scientologists consider it the only effective way to deal with the long-term effects of drug abuse or toxic exposure. The program combines exercise, dietary supplements and long stays in a sauna (up to five hours a day for five weeks). It is promoted variously as religious or secular, medical or purely spiritual, depending on context.\n\nNarconon is a drug education and rehabilitation program founded on Hubbard's beliefs about toxins and purification. Narconon is offered in the United States, Canada and a number of European countries; its \"Purification Program\" uses a regimen composed of sauna, physical exercise, vitamins and diet management, combined with auditing and study.\n\nThe Introspection Rundown is a controversial Church of Scientology auditing process that is intended to handle a psychotic episode or complete mental breakdown. Introspection is defined for the purpose of this rundown as a condition where the person is \"looking into one's own mind, feelings, reactions, etc.\" The Introspection Rundown came under public scrutiny after the death of Lisa McPherson in 1995.\n\nOn November 12, 1952, Hubbard delivered a lecture entitled \"Precision Knowledge: Necessity to know terminology and law\" emphasizing the importance to precise terminology. Scientology defined methods of correcting \"misunderstoods\" (\"misunderstood word or symbol\"). Scientologists have their own \"Technical Dictionary\" featuring modified definitions of existing English words. Scientology dictionaries also include specialized terminology such as \"enturbulate\" and \"havingness.\"\n\nCritics of Scientology have accused Hubbard of \"loading the language\" and using Scientology jargon to keep Scientologists from interacting with information sources outside of Scientology.\n\nScientology teaches that that material must be learned \"on a gradient\", that is, in order without skipping or skimming material.\n\nIn Scientology doctrine, the idea of communication has a high status. In the book \"Sects, Cults, and Spiritual Communities,\" Petrowsky and Zellner state that in the Scientology belief system, “misinformation or miscommunication is analogous to original sin, inhibiting individual growth and relationships with others.” The “misunderstood word” is a central teaching in Scientology. Failure in reading comprehension is attributed to it.\n\nScientology discourages secondary interpretation of its writings.\nStudents of Scientology are taught to direct others to those original sources, rather than to convey any interpretation of the concepts in their own words. Emphasis is placed on keeping the writings in context.\n\nAdvocated by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, silent birth describes \"the process of childbirth where labor and delivery is done in a calm and loving environment.\" To provide quiet surroundings for the delivery of the baby, individuals in his/her immediate vicinity are prompted not to speak. According to Scientology practices, silent birth is \"mandatory to provide the best possible environment for the pregnant mother and her new baby.\" Shouting, laughing or making loud remarks must be avoided while the baby is being pushed out. According to \"The Multimedia Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World,\" \"its origins are fundamentally rooted in the principle that women, particularly expectant mothers, be given the utmost care and respect.\"\n\nThere are several holidays celebrated by Scientologists, notably L. Ron Hubbard's birthday in March, the Anniversary of the first publication of Dianetics in May, Sea Org Day in August, Auditor's Day in September and the International Association of Scientologists (IAS) Anniversary in October. Most official celebrations are scheduled on weekends as a convenience to members. Scientologists also celebrate holidays such as Christmas, Easter and New Year's Eve, as well as other local celebrations. Scientologists also celebrate religious holidays depending on other religious beliefs, as Scientologists very often retain their original affiliations with faiths in which they were raised.\n\nA Scientology Sunday service has a sermon, similar to other religions in the United States. It typically begins at 11am and Hubbard’s writings are read aloud during the service. Much like other religions’ services, music is played or sometimes musical performances are enjoyed. The minister speaks on Scientology doctrine, announces that weekly activities of the community and recent updates from churches around the world. Scientologists also say “A Prayer for Total Freedom,” asking the “author of the universe” to help them as they seek enlightenment.\n\nThey way Scientology’s service has been executed has not changed. The minister chooses from a limited selection of possible sermons and group processing exercises. He creates the sermon within the parameters of a literal interpretation of Hubbard’s canonical teachings, functioning similar to other indigenous theologians who work with canonical texts.\n\nAccording to religion scholar James R. Lewis, Sunday services are more for interested non-members and the holidays and events are more for existing members of the church.\n\nThe church’s rituals can be categorized four ways: first, rituals performed for spiritual transformation; second, collective ceremonies usually called events, including Hubbard’s birthday; third, rites of passage including weddings and funerals; and fourth, those that mimic Christian rituals, such as Sunday services. Events include the anniversary of Dianetics, the anniversary of Freewinds and Auditor’s Day.\n\nScientologists also undergo training aside from auditing, which consists of several levels of courses about daily life improvement using various tools, and auditing techniques, so that members are able to perform the same procedure to other Scientologists.\n\nScientology has an internal justice system (the \"Ethics\" system) designed to deal with unethical or antisocial behavior. Ethics officers are present in every org; they are tasked with ensuring correct application of Scientology technology and deal with violations such as non-compliance with standard procedures or any other behavior adversely affecting an org's performance, ranging from errors and misdemeanors to crimes and suppressive acts, as defined by internal documents. Scientology teaches that spiritual progress requires and enables the attainment of high \"ethical\" standards. In Scientology, rationality is stressed over morality. Actions are considered \"ethical\" if they promote \"survival\" across all eight \"dynamics\", thus benefiting the greatest number of people or things possible while harming the fewest.\n\nWhile Scientology states that many social problems are the unintentional results of people's imperfections, it asserts that there are also truly malevolent individuals. Hubbard believed that approximately 80 percent of all people are what he called \"social personalities\"people who welcome and contribute to the welfare of others. The remaining 20 percent of the population, Hubbard thought, were \"Suppressive Persons\". According to Hubbard, only about 2.5 percent of this 20 percent are hopelessly antisocial personalities; these make up the small proportion of truly dangerous individuals in humanity: \"the Adolf Hitlers and the Genghis Khans, the unrepentant murderers and the drug lords.\" Scientologists believe that any contact with suppressive or antisocial individuals has an adverse effect on one's spiritual condition, necessitating disconnection.\n\nIn Scientology, defectors who turn into critics of the movement are declared suppressive persons, and the Church of Scientology has a reputation for moving aggressively against such detractors. A Scientologist who is actively in communication with a suppressive person and as a result shows signs of antisocial behaviour is referred to as a \"Potential Trouble Source\".\n\nThe term \"Fair Game\" is used to describe policies and practices carried out by the Church against people the Church perceives as its enemies. Hubbard established the policy in the 1950s, in response to criticism both from within and outside his organization. Individuals or groups who are \"Fair Game\" are judged to be a threat to the Church and, according to the policy, can be punished and harassed using any and all means possible.\n\nHubbard and his followers targeted many individuals as well as government officials and agencies, including a program of covert and illegal infiltration of the IRS and other U.S. government agencies during the 1970s. They also conducted private investigations, character assassination and legal action against the Church's critics in the media. The policy remains in effect and has been defended by the Church of Scientology as a core religious practice.\n\nWhile \"Scientology\" generally refers to Miscavige-led Church of Scientology, many other groups practice Scientology. These groups, collectively known as the Free Zone or as Independent Scientologists, consist of both former members of the official Church of Scientology, as well as entirely new members. In 1965, a longtime Church member and \"Doctor of Scientology\" Jack Horner (b. 1927), dissatisfied with the Church's \"ethics\" program, developed Dianology. Capt. Bill Robertson, a former Sea Org member, was a primary instigator of the movement in the early 1980s. The church labels these groups as \"squirrels\" in Scientology jargon and often subjects them to considerable legal and social pressure.\n\nOn January 1, 1982, Miscavige established the Religious Technology Center (RTC). On November 11, 1982, the Free Zone was established by former top Scientologists in disagreement with RTC. The Free Zone Association was founded and registered under the laws of Germany, and believes that the Church of Scientology has departed from its original philosophy.\n\nThe Advanced Ability Center was a breakaway organization from the Church of Scientology established by former Scientologist David Mayo after he left the Church in February 1983 – a time when most of Scientology's upper and middle management split with David Miscavige's organization. David Mayo had been Hubbard's own auditor.\n\nMore recently, high-profile defectors Mark Rathbun and Mike Rinder have championed the cause of Independent Scientologists wishing to practice Scientology outside of the Church.\nThe Church of Scientology requires that all members sign a legal waiver which covers their relationship with the Church of Scientology before engaging in Scientology services.\n\n\n\nChurch sites\n\nArticles\n\nOther sites\n"}

This term has been officially used for female monarchs in some Islamic states, and historically it was also used for sultan's consorts. Nevertheless, westerners have also used the title to refer to Muslim women monarchs and sultan's women relatives who do not hold this title officially.\n\nThe term sultana is a feminine form of the word sultan (), an Arabic abstract noun meaning \"strength\", \"authority\", \"rulership\", derived from the verbal noun \"\", meaning \"authority\" or \"power\". Later, sultan came to be used as the title of certain rulers who claimed almost full sovereignty in practical terms (i.e., the lack of dependence on any higher ruler), albeit without claiming the overall caliphate, or to refer to a powerful governor of a province within the caliphate.\n\nSome Muslim female monarchs chose to adopt the title of Sultana/Sultanah when they ascended to the throne. \n\nIn the former Kingdom of Touggourt, now part of Algeria, there was one ruling sultana: Aïsha.\n\nIn Samudera Pasai Sultanate (now part of Indonesia), Sultana Seri Ratu Nihrasyiah Rawangsa Khadiyu (r. 1406-1427) became the sole ruler.\nIn Aceh Darussalam (now part of Indonesia and Malaysia), there have been four ruling sultanas:\n\nIn Maldives, there have been five ruling sultanas:\n\nOn 5 May 2015, Hamengkubuwono X, Sultan and Governor of Yogyakarta, Indonesia, appointed his eldest daughter, Lady Nurmalita Sari (henceforth titled Princess Mangkubumi), as his heiress presumptive. If she does succeed her father, she will become the first Javanese woman to become a Sultan in her own right.\n\nSultana is also used for sultan's wives. Between 1914 and 1922, monarchs of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty used the title of Sultan of Egypt, and their wives were legally styled as sultanas. Two women held the title of sultana during the short-lived Sultanate of Egypt: Melek Tourhan, the wife of Sultan Hussein Kamel, and Nazli Sabri, the wife of Sultan Fuad I. Nazli Sabri became queen (\"malika\") following the establishment of the Kingdom of Egypt in 1922, and it is with the latter title that she is almost always associated. Melek Tourhan, on the other hand, legally retained the title of sultana even after Egypt became a kingdom, and is often referred to simply as Sultana Melek.\n\nSultana is also title for consort of ruler in some Malaysian states. Some consorts who hold this title are\n\nIn the west, the title of sultana is also used to refer to many female Muslim monarchs who don't hold this title officially.\n\nIn medieval Egypt, Shajar al-Durr, a former slave of Turkic origin, ascended the throne in 1250. Although several sources assert that she took the title of sultana, \"The Cambridge History of Islam\" disputes the claim, stating that \"a feminine form, sultana, does not exist in Arabic: the title \"sulṭān\" appears on Shajar al-Durr's only extant coin.\"\n\nRaziya al-Din, usually referred to in history as Razia Sultana, was the Sultan of Delhi in India from 1236 to May 1240. Like some other princesses of the time, she was trained to lead armies and administer kingdoms if necessary. She was the first female ruler of the Delhi Sultanate. She refused to be addressed as Sultana because it meant \"wife or consort of a Sultan\" and would answer only to the title \"Sultan.\" Like Shajar al-Durr, Raziya was also often referred as sultana by westerners, very possible to distinguish her from male sultans.\n\nSultana was also often used to refer to women relatives of a sultan and other Muslim monarch or female members of Muslim dynasties, especially mothers and chief wives. In fact, many sultanates used other title for sultan's chief consort, some of which derived from non-Arabic language.\n\n\"Permaisuri\", a title for a chief wife of a sultan in many sultanates and Muslim kingdoms in southeast Asia, is derived from Tamil பரமேஸ்வரி (paramēsvari), from Sanskrit परमेश्वरी (parameśvarī), 'supreme lady'. This title is still used for the consort of Yang di-Pertuan Agong, monarch and head of state of Malaysia. The formal way of addressing her is Raja Permaisuri Agong.\n\nIn Brunei, official title for a chief wife of the sultan is \"Seri Baginda Raja Isteri\", derived from Sanskrit \"raja\" (राजा, equivalent with \"king\") and \"isteri\" (equivalent with \"women\" or \"lady\"). The official title for sultan's mother is \"Seri Suri Begawan Raja Isteri\".\n\n\"Shahbanu\", title for the wife of Iran's monarch, is derived from Persian \"shah\" (شاه, equivalent with \"king\") and \"banu\" (بانو, translated as \"lady\"). Upon assuming the title in 1967, Farah Pahlavi, the third wife of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was the first \"shahbanu\" to be crowned in Iran since the Arab conquest of Iran in the 7th century. \"Shahbanu\" often translated in English as \"empress\".\n\nSome Muslim monarchs also used the title \"malika\" (Arabic: ملكة), a feminine form of the word \"malik\", for their wives. This title is still used in many Muslim kingdoms, like Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan\n\nSince 16th century, Ottoman used the title \"sultan\" for imperial princesses after their given names (e.g. Mihrimah Sultan and Hatice Sultan). They were all non-ruling royalty; in the western sense, princesses, not queens or empresses. The monarch's mother, who had more power, had the title Valide Sultan (e.g. Hafsa Sultan). She was referred to by this title alone, without her given name. Principal consort had the title Haseki Sultan (e.g. Hürrem Sultan). Non-principal consorts had the title \"hatun\", equivalent to \"lady\". This usage underlines the Ottoman conception of sovereign power as family prerogative. Nevertheless, westerners often translated their official title, \"sultan\", to \"sultana\", possibly to distinguish them from the Ottoman ruler.\n\n"}
{"id": "3530370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3530370", "title": "Tandava", "text": "Tandava\n\n' (Kannada: ತಾಂಡವ, Tamil: தாண்டவம்) (also known as ') is a divine dance performed by the Hindu god Shiva. Shiva's Tandava is described as a vigorous dance that is the source of the cycle of creation, preservation and dissolution. While the Rudra Tandava depicts his violent nature, first as the creator and later as the destroyer of the universe, even of death itself; the Ananda Tandava depicts him as joyful. In Shaiva Siddhanta tradition, Shiva as Nataraja (lit. \"Lord of dance\") is considered the supreme lord of dance.\n\nThe Tandavam takes its name from Tandu (), the attendant of Shiva, who instructed Bharata (author of the Natya Shastra) in the use of \"Angaharas\" and \"Karanas\", modes of the Tandava at Shiva's order. Some scholars consider that Tandu himself must have been the author of an earlier work on the dramatic arts, which was incorporated into the Natya Shastra. Indeed, the classical arts of dance, music and song may derive from the mudras and rituals of Shaiva tradition.\nThe 32 Angaharas and 108 Karanas are discussed by Bharata in the 4th chapter of the Natya Shastra, \"Tandava Lakshanam\". Karana is the combination of hand gestures with feet to form a dance posture. Angahara is composed of seven or more Karanas. 108 karanas included in Tandava could be employed in the course of dance, fight, and personal combats and in other special movements like strolling.\n\nThe dance is a pictorial allegory of the five principle manifestations of eternal energy:\n\nThus Tandava symbolizes the cosmic cycles of creation and destruction, as well as the daily rhythm of birth and death.\nTandava, as performed in the sacred dance-drama of southern India, has vigorous, brisk movements. Performed with joy, the dance is called \"Ananda Tandava\". Performed in a violent mood, the dance is called \"Rudra Tandava\". In the Hindu texts, at least seven types of Tandava are found: Ananda Tandava, Tripura Tandava, Sandhya Tandava, Samhara Tandava, Kali (Kalika) Tandava, Uma Tandava and Gauri Tandava. However, some people believe that there are 16 types of Tandava.\n\"How many various dances of Shiva are known to His worshipers I cannot say. No doubt the root idea behind all of these dances is more or less one and the same, the manifestation of primal rhythmic energy. Whatever the origins of Shiva's dance, it became in time the clearest image of the activity of God which any art or religion can boast of.\" - Ananda Coomaraswamy\nThe dance performed by Shiva's wife Parvati in response to Shiva's Tandava is known as Lasya, in which the movements are gentle, graceful and sometimes erotic. Some scholars consider Lasya to be the feminine version of Tandava. Lasya has 2 kinds, Jarita Lasya and Yauvaka Lasya.\n\nThe Hindu scriptures narrate various occasions when Shiva or other gods have performed the Tandava. When Sati (first wife of Shiva, who was reborn as Parvati) jumped into the Agni Kunda (sacrificial fire) in Daksha's Yajna and gave up her life, Shiva is said to have performed the Rudra Tandava to express his grief and anger. The \"Shivapradosha stotra\" says when Shiva performs the \"Sandhya Tandava\", the other gods like Brahma, Vishnu, Sarasvati, Lakshmi and Indra play musical instruments and sing Shiva's praises. Ganesha, the son of Shiva, is depicted as \"Ashtabhuja tandavsa nritya murtis\" (Eight armed form of Ganesha dancing the Tandava) in temple sculptures. Shiva Tandava Stotram is a stotra (Hindu hymn) that describes Shiva's power and beauty. The Bhagavata Purana talks of Krishna dancing his Tandava on the head of the serpent Kaliya. According to Jain traditions, Indra is said to have performed the Tandava in honour of Rishabha (Jain tirthankar) on the latter's birth.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1942574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1942574", "title": "Tarō Asō", "text": "Tarō Asō\n\nAsō has served in the House of Representatives since 1979. He was Minister for Foreign Affairs from 2005 to 2007, and was Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) briefly in 2007 and in 2008. He was President of the LDP from 2008 to 2009. His successor, Sadakazu Tanigaki, was chosen on 28 September 2009.\n\nAfter the LDP's victory in the 2012 general election under Shinzō Abe he was appointed to the cabinet as Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, and State Minister for Financial Services. He has held the positions since 26 December 2012.\n\nAsō, a Roman Catholic, was born in Iizuka in Fukuoka Prefecture on 20 September 1940. His father, Takakichi Asō, was the chairman of the Aso Cement Company and a close associate of Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka; his mother Kazuko Asō was Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida's daughter. Tarō is also a great-great-grandson of Ōkubo Toshimichi, and his wife, Chikako is the third daughter of Prime Minister Zenkō Suzuki. His younger sister, Nobuko, Princess Tomohito of Mikasa, is a cousin-in-law of Emperor Akihito.\n\nAsō graduated from the Faculty of Politics and Economics at Gakushuin University, and the London School of Economics.\n\nAsō spent two years working for a diamond mining operation in Sierra Leone before civil war forced him to return to Japan. Then he joined his father's company in 1966, and served as president of the Aso Mining Company from 1973 to 1979. Working for the company, he lived in Brazil during the 1960s and became fluent in Portuguese. He was also a member of the Japanese shooting team at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and President of the Japan Junior Chamber in 1978.\n\nHe joined the Cabinet of Jun'ichirō Koizumi in 2003 as Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications. On 31 October 2005, he became Minister for Foreign Affairs. There has been some speculation that his position in the Cabinet was due to his membership in the Kōno Group, an LDP caucus led by pro-Chinese lawmaker Yōhei Kōno: by appointing Asō as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Koizumi may have been attempting to \"rein in\" Kōno's statements critical of Japanese foreign policy.\n\nAsō was one of the final candidates to replace Koizumi as prime minister in 2006, but lost the internal party election to Shinzō Abe by a wide margin. Both Abe and Asō are conservative on foreign policy issues and have taken confrontational stances towards some East Asian nations, particularly North Korea and, to a lesser extent, the People's Republic of China. Abe was considered a more \"moderate\" politician than the more \"hard-line\" Asō, and led Asō in opinion polling within Japan. Asō's views on multilateralism are suggested in a 2006 speech, \"Arc of Freedom and Prosperity: Japan's Expanding Diplomatic Horizons\".\n\nAsō acknowledged that he would most likely lose to Fukuda, but said that he wanted to run so that there would be an open election, saying that otherwise LDP would face criticism for making its choice \"through back-room deals\". In the President election, held on 23 September, Fukuda defeated Asō, receiving 330 votes against 197 votes for Asō.\n\nOn 1 August 2008, Fukuda appointed Asō as Secretary-General of LDP, a move that solidified Asō's position as the number two man in the party.\n\nUnexpectedly on 1 September 2008, Fukuda announced his resignation as Prime Minister. Five LDP members including Asō ran for new party President to succeed Fukuda. On 21 September, one day before votes of Diet party members, Asō reportedly told a crowd of supporters outside Tokyo: \"The greatest concern right now is the economy.\" \"America is facing a financial crisis ... we must not allow that to bring us down as well.\" Finally on 22 September, Asō did win. He was elected as President of LDP with 351 of 525 votes (217 from 384 Diet party members, 134 from 47 prefecture branches); Kaoru Yosano, Yuriko Koike, Nobuteru Ishihara, Shigeru Ishiba got 66, 46, 37, 25 votes respectively.\n\nTwo days later on 24 September, Asō was designated by the Diet as Prime Minister, and was formally appointed to the office by the Emperor on that night. In the House of Representatives (lower house), he garnered 337 out of 478 votes cast; in the House of Councillors (upper house), Ichirō Ozawa, President of the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan, was named through two times of ballots. Because no agreement was reached at a joint committee of both Houses, the resolution of the House of Representatives became the resolution of the Diet, as is stipulated in the Constitution. Asō reportedly said, \"If you look at the current period, it's not a stable one.\" and \"These are turbulent times with the financial situation and everything else.\"\n\nLater on the same day as his election as Prime Minister, Asō personally announced his new Cabinet (this is normally done by the Chief Cabinet Secretary). His Cabinet was markedly different from the preceding Cabinet under Fukuda. Five of its members had never previously served in the Cabinet, and one of them, 34-year-old Yūko Obuchi, was the youngest member of the Cabinet in the post-war era.\n\nPrime Minister Asō flew to Washington to meet with United States President Barack Obama in February 2009. He was the first foreign leader to visit the Obama White House; however, reports suggested that the new administration was interested less in giving Asō a political boost than in sending a message that Japan continues to be an important ally and partner – a low-risk, high-payoff gesture for both Asō and Obama.\n\nAfter his election as prime minister Asō was expected to dissolve the lower house to clear the way for a general election. But he repeatedly stressed the need for a functioning government to face the economic crisis and ruled out an early election. Only after passage of the extra budget for fiscal 2009 in May and facing internal pressure from the LDP after a series of defeats in regional elections – most notably the Tokyo prefectural election on 12 July – he decided to announce a general election for 30 August 2009. He dissolved the House of Representatives on 21 July 2009. The LDP lost by a landslide to Democratic Party of Japan, in the face of record levels of post-war unemployment. Accepting responsibility for the worst (and second-only) defeat of a sitting government in modern Japanese history, Asō immediately resigned as LDP president.\n\nWhen Shinzo Abe returned to the Prime Minister's office in 2012, Aso is appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. He is the first former Japanese Prime Minister to subsequently serve as Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nIn 2001, as economics minister, he was quoted as saying he wanted to make Japan a country where \"rich Jews\" would like to live.\n\nOn 15 October 2005, during the opening ceremony of the Kyushu National Museum which also displays how other Asian cultures have influenced Japanese cultural heritage, he praised Japan for having \"one culture, one civilization, one language, and one ethnic group\", and stated that it was the only such country in the world.\n\nAt a lecture in Nagasaki Prefecture, Asō referred to a Japanese peace initiative on the Middle East, stating, \"The Japanese were trusted because they had never been involved in exploitation there, or been involved in fights or fired machine guns. Japan is doing what the Americans can't do. It would probably be no good to have blue eyes and blond hair. Luckily, we Japanese have yellow faces.\"\n\"Kyodo News\" reported that he had said on 4 February 2006, \"our predecessors did a good thing\" regarding compulsory education implemented during Japan's colonization of Taiwan.\n\nOn 21 December 2005, he said China was \"a neighbour with one billion people equipped with nuclear bombs and has expanded its military outlays by double digits for 17 years in a row, and it is unclear as to what this is being used for. It is beginning to be a considerable threat\". On 28 January 2006, he called for the emperor to visit the controversial Yasukuni shrine. He later backtracked on the comment, but stated that he hoped such a visit would be possible in the future.\n\n\"Mainichi Daily News\" reported that on 9 March 2006 he referred to Taiwan as a \"law-abiding country\", which drew strong protest from Beijing, which considers the island a part of China.\n\nOn 23 September 2008, \"Akahata\", the daily newspaper published by Japanese Communist Party released a compiled list of these and other statements as the front-page article criticizing Asō. This compilation as well as similar lists of blunders have been frequently cited in the Japanese media.\n\n\"Yahoo! News\" reported that he had said on 9 January 2009, \"To work is good. It's completely different thinking from the Old Testament.\"\n\nWhile speaking at a meeting of the National Council on Social Security Reform, in 2013, Asō referred to patients suffering from serious illness as \"tube persons\" and remarked that they should be \"allowed to die quickly\" if they desired it. \"Heaven forbid I should be kept alive if I want to die\", he is quoted as saying. \"You cannot sleep well when you think it's all paid by the government. This won't be solved unless you let them hurry up and die.\"\n\nIn 2014, while campaigning in Sapporo for the general election, Asō said that rising social welfare costs were not solely due to an aging population. He said, \"There are many people who are creating the image that (the increasing number of) elderly people is bad, but more problematic is people who don't give birth\". The comment was labeled as insensitive to those who are not able to have children for biological or economic reasons.\n\n\"The Guardian\" reported on 30 August 2017, that he said, \"Hitler, who killed millions of people, was no good even if his motive was right.\" He later retracted the remarks.\n\nAso caused a stir in June 2018 when he boasted that the large support towards the LDP among voters under 35 in the 2017 general election was due to the demographics being illiterate about the news and current affairs.\n\nIn May 2018, Aso downplayed alleged sexual harassment charges against his ministry’s top bureaucrat by saying that “there is no such thing as a sexual harassment charge”. When asked to comment on a formal complaint submitted to his ministry on the alleged sexual harassment, Aso-san’s remarked that his “only thought was that it would have been easier to read if they used a bigger font” \n\nAffiliated to the openly revisionist organization Nippon Kaigi, Asō believes that Japan committed no war crimes during the Pacific War.\n\nIn mid-2008 Asō conceded that his family's coal mine, Aso Mining Company, was alleged to have forced Allied prisoners of war to work in the mines in 1945 without pay. Western media reported that 300 prisoners, including 197 Australians, 101 British, and two Dutch, worked in the mine. Two of the Australians, John Watson and Leslie Edgar George Wilkie, died while working in the Aso mine. In addition, 10,000 Korean conscripts worked in the mine between 1939 and 1945 under severe, brutal conditions in which many of them died or were injured while receiving little pay. The company, now known as the Aso Group, is run by Asō's younger brother. Asō's wife serves on its board of directors. Asō headed the company in the 1970s before going into politics.\n\nActing on a request from Yukihisa Fujita, the Foreign Ministry investigated and announced on 18 December 2008 that Aso Mining had, in fact, used 300 Allied POWs at its mine during World War II. The ministry confirmed that two Australians had died while working at the mine, but declined to release their names or causes of deaths for \"privacy reasons\". Said Fujita, \"Prisoner policy is important in many ways for diplomacy, and it is a major problem that the issue has been neglected for so long.\" Asō has not responded to requests from former laborers to apologize for the way they were treated by his family's company.\n\nThe Japanese media noted in November 2008 that Asō often mispronounced or incorrectly read kanji words written in his speeches, even though many of the words are commonly used in Japanese. Asō spoke of the speaking errors to reporters on 12 November 2008 saying, \"Those were just reading errors, just mistakes.\" Asō's tendency for malapropisms has led comparisons to George W. Bush, and the use of his name, \"Tarō\" as a schoolyard taunt for unintelligent children.\n\nAn anatomy professor from the University of Tokyo, Takeshi Yoro, speculated that Asō could possibly suffer from dyslexia.\n\nIn 2001, Asō, along with Hiromu Nonaka, was among the LDP's chief candidates to succeed Yoshirō Mori as prime minister of Japan. During a meeting of LDP leaders at which Nonaka was not present, Asō reportedly told the assembled group, \"We are not going to let someone from the buraku become the prime minister, are we?\" Asō's remark was apparently a reference to Nonaka's burakumin, a social minority group in Japan, heritage.\n\nNonaka subsequently withdrew as a candidate. Asō eventually lost the appointment to Jun'ichirō Koizumi. Asō's comment about Nonaka's heritage was revealed in 2005. Asō denied that he had made the statement, but Hisaoki Kamei, who was present at the 2001 meeting, stated in January 2009 that he had heard Asō say something, \"to that effect\". Nonaka said that he would \"never forgive\" Asō for the comment and went on to state that Asō was a \"misery\" to Japan.\n\nIn October 2008, the Japanese media reported that Asō dined-out or drank in restaurants and bars in luxury hotels almost nightly. When asked about it, Asō stated, \"I won't change my style. Luckily I have my money and can afford it.\" Asō added that if he went anywhere else, he would have to be accompanied by security guards which would cause trouble.\n\nAccording to the \"Asahi Shimbun\", Asō dined-out or drank at bars 32 times in September 2008, mainly at exclusive hotels. Asō's predecessor, Yasuo Fukuda, dined-out only seven times in his first month in office. Both of the LDP's opposition parties have called Asō's frequent outings inappropriate. Asō's Chief Cabinet Secretary, Jun Matsumoto, commented on the issue by saying that Asō's frequent trips to restaurants, \"is his lifestyle and philosophy, and I am not in a position to express my opinion. If only there were more appropriate places when considering security issues and not causing trouble for other customers.\"\n\nAsō argues that embracing Japanese pop culture can be an important step to cultivating ties with other countries, hoping that manga will act as a bridge to the world. He is referred to as an otaku.\n\nAsō has been a fan of manga since childhood. He had his family send manga magazines from Japan while he was studying at Stanford University. In 2003, he described reading about 10 or 20 manga magazines every week (making up only part of Asō's voracious reading) and talked about his impression of various manga extemporaneously. In 2007, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, he established the International Manga Award for non-Japanese manga artists.\n\nIt was reported that he was seen reading the manga \"Rozen Maiden\" in Tokyo International Airport, which earned him the sobriquet \"His Excellency Rozen\". He admitted in an interview that he had read the manga; however, he said he did not remember whether he had read it in an airport. He is a fan of \"Golgo 13\", a long-running manga about an assassin for hire.\n\nAsō's candidacy for the position of Japanese Prime Minister actually caused share-value to rise among some manga publishers and companies related to the manga industry.\n\nAs a Roman Catholic, Asō belongs to the small minority of Japanese Christians, but he has not emphasized his religiosity. Asō is the seventh Christian prime minister of Japan, after Takashi Hara, Korekiyo Takahashi, Tetsu Katayama, Ichirō Hatoyama, Masayoshi Ōhira, and his own grandfather Shigeru Yoshida. His Christian name is Francisco (フランシスコ).\n\nOn occasion of his 2009 new year visit to the Shinto Ise Shrine, Asō publicly performed the hand-clapping in front of the shrine, stating later that he had \"prayed for the good of the Japanese people\".\n\n\"Incorporates information from the Japanese Wikipedia article\"\n\nAsō is a patrilineal descendant of the Asō clan and is maternally descended from Ōkubo Toshimichi through his son Count Makino Nobuaki. Through his paternal grandmother the Hon. Kanō Natsuko, he descends from the Tachibana clan of the Miike Domain and from a cadet branch of the Ōkubo clan, who ruled the Odawara Domain. \n\n\n"}

It describes the man's trials as the product of religious intermarriage and how \"mixed up\" he became as a result of such an upbringing.\n\nThis song was written by Anthony Murphy of Liverpool, and has been recorded by bands such as The Irish Rovers, The Wolfe Tones, Paddy Reilly, and the Brobdingnagian Bards, among others. It is sung to the same tune as \"The Wearing of the Green\", which is also used in \"The Rising of the Moon\", another Irish ballad.\n\nLiverpool, home to a great many Irish immigrants, has a large number of Catholics. On the other hand, the Protestant Orange Order is also very strong. The Orange Lodge marches every year in July, with bands of fifes, drums and bagpipes, to celebrate the victory of Protestant King William of Orange over Catholic King James II, on 12 July 1690. \n\n"}

These visions took place at two times: in 1900 during his stay in Mexico, and later in 1909 in Algeria in the company of poet Victor Benjamin Neuburg. Of all his works, Crowley considered this book to be second in importance behind \"The Book of the Law\", the text that established his religious and philosophical system of Thelema in 1904. \n\n\"The Vision and the Voice\" is the source of many of the central spiritual doctrines of Thelema, especially in the visions of Babalon and her consort Chaos (the \"All-Father\"), as well as an account of how an individual might cross the Abyss, thereby assuming the title of \"Master of the Temple\" and taking a place in the City of the Pyramids under the Night of Pan.\n\n\n\n"}
