{"id": "47140240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47140240", "title": "Amir al-hajj", "text": "Amir al-hajj\n\nAmir al-hajj (; transliteration: \"amīr al-ḥajj\", \"commander of the pilgrimage\", or \"amīr al-ḥājj\", \"commander of the pilgrim\"; plural: \"umarāʾ al-ḥajj\") was the position and title given to the commander of the annual Hajj pilgrim caravan by successive Muslim empires, from the 7th century until the 20th century. Since the Abbasid period, there were two main caravans, departing from Damascus and Cairo. Each of the two caravans was annually assigned an \"amir al-hajj\". The main duties entrusted to an \"amir al-hajj\" were securing funds and provisions for the caravan, and protecting it along the desert route to the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina in the Hejaz (modern-day Saudi Arabia). \n\nAccording to historian Thomas Philipp, \"the office of \"amir al-hajj\" was an extremely important one\", which brought with it great political influence and religious prestige. Given the significance of the Hajj pilgrimage in Islam, the protection of the caravan and its pilgrims was a priority for the Muslim rulers responsible. Any mishandling of the caravan or harm done to the pilgrims by Bedouin raiders would often be made known throughout the Muslim world by returning pilgrims. The leader of the Muslim world, or the ruler aspiring to this position, was required to ensure the pilgrimage's safety, and its success or failure significantly reflected on the ruler's prestige. Thus, \"talented and successful Hajj commanders were crucial\". In Ottoman times, the importance of successful \"umara' al-hajj\" generally rendered them immune from punitive measures by the Ottoman authorities for abuses they committed elsewhere.\n\nThe main threat to a Hajj caravan was Bedouin raiding. An \"amir al-hajj\" would command a large military force to protect the caravan in the event of an attack by local Bedouin or would pay off the various Bedouin tribes whose territories the caravan inevitably traversed on the way to the Muslim holy cities in the Hejaz. The procurement of supplies, namely water and foodstuffs, and transportation, namely camels, were also the responsibility of the \"amir al-hajj\", as was securing the funds to finance the pilgrimage. The funds mostly came from province revenues specifically designated for the Hajj. Some funds came from large endowments established by various Mamluk and Ottoman sultans that were mainly meant to ensure the availability of water and supplies in the cities of Mecca and Medina to accommodate incoming pilgrims. The Cairene commander was responsible for the \"kiswah\", which was the black cloth that is annually draped over the Kaaba in Mecca.\n\nAccording to Singer and Philipp, an \"amir al-hajj\" needed to possess logistical capabilities in addition to military skills. To procure supplies and ensure safe transportation for the caravan, the \"amir al-hajj\" often maintained a network of connections to various Ottoman officials and local community leaders. An \"amir al-hajj\" brought with him an array of officials, including additional \"mamluk\" commanders to maintain order and religious functionaries, such as imams, \"muezzins\", \"qadis\", all of whom were typically educated Arabs. Other officials included Arab desert guides, doctors, an official in charge of intestate affairs for pilgrims who died during the pilgrimage, and a \"muhtasib\" who was in charge of overseeing financial transactions.\n\nMuslim tradition ascribes the first Hajj caravan to the lifetime of Muhammad, who in 630 (AH 9) instructed Abu Bakr to lead 300 pilgrims from Medina to Mecca. With the Muslim conquests, large numbers of pilgrims converged from all the corners of the expanding Muslim world. Under the Abbasids, the tradition began of annual, state-sponsored caravans setting out from Damascus and Cairo, with the pilgrim caravans from remoter regions usually joining them. A third major point of departure was Kufa, where pilgrims from Iraq, Iran, and Central Asia gathered; Damascus gathered pilgrims from the Levant and in later times Anatolia; and Cairo gathered the pilgrims from Egypt, Africa, the Maghreb, and al-Andalus (Spain). \n\nThe early Abbasids placed much value on the symbolic importance of the pilgrimage, and in the first century of Abbasid rule, it was members of the ruling dynasty who were usually chosen to lead the caravans. Furthermore, Caliph Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809) led the caravan in person several times. The specific year when the \"amir al-hajj\" office was established is not definitely known, but was likely in 978 CE when al-Aziz, the caliph of the Fatimids of Egypt, appointed Badis ibn Ziri to the position. The first \"amir al-hajj\" for the Kufa caravan was likely the Seljuk emir Qaymaz, appointed by Seljuk sultan Muhammad II in 1157, and the first likely \"amir al-hajj\" for the Damascus caravan was Tughtakin ibn Ayyub, appointed by the Ayyubid sultan Saladin after the reconquest of Jerusalem from the Crusaders in 1187. \n\nWith the virtual destruction of the Abbasid Caliphate and its capital Baghdad by the Mongol Empire in 1258, the role of Damascus and Cairo as gathering and departure points for the Hajj caravan was elevated. The Mamluk Sultanate was established two years later. From then on, Damascus served as the main gathering point for pilgrims from the Levant, Anatolia, Mesopotamia and Persia, while Cairo was the marshalling point for pilgrims coming from the Nile Valley, North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. According to historian Jane Hathaway, it was under the Mamluks that the \"amir al-hajj\" assumed its \"classical\" form. Despite its importance, however, the Mamluks chose middle-ranking officials to lead the caravans—typically an \"amir mia muqaddam alf\" (commander of a thousand soldiers)—occasionally including freeborn Mamluks (\"awlād al-nās\"), who were considered of lower status than manumitted Mamluks. \n\nDuring the Mamluk era, the main pilgrimage caravan left from Cairo. Its \"amir al-hajj\" was always appointed by the sultan. The \"amir al-hajj\" of Damascus was either appointed by the sultan or his viceroy in Syria. The Damascene commander was generally subordinate to the Cairene commander, normally playing a neutral or supportive role to the latter in meetings or quarrels with the Meccan \"sharifs\" or the caravan commanders from Iraq or Yemen. Because the \"kiswa\", the ceremonial covering for the Ka'aba, was usually woven in Egypt, it was carried by the Cairo caravan, while the Damascene caravan carried the corresponding covering for Muhammad's tomb in Medina. A few Mamluk sultans made the pilgrimage themselves, but usually their symbolic presence was represented by a palanquin (\"maḥmal\"), escorted by musicians.\n\nThe role of \"amir al-hajj\" was continued by the Ottoman Empire when they gained control over the Mamluks' territories in 1517. Besides the latter year, during which the Ottoman sultan appointed a bureaucrat to the post, the \"umara' al-hajj\" from Cairo for much of the 16th century continued to come from the ranks of Circassian Mamluks with occasional appointments of important Arab sheikhs or high-ranking Bosnian or Turkish officials. This was followed by a period where commanders for the Cairene caravan came from Constantinople until the early 18th century when the Mamluks of Egypt once again became the favored appointees for the office. \n\nIn the 16th century, the \"amir al-hajj\" assigned to the caravan from Damascus commanded 100 \"sipahi\", professional troops who owned fiefs in Damascus Eyalet (Province of Damascus), and janissaries, soldiers from the Damascus garrison. The first \"amir al-hajj\" for Damascus was the province's former Mamluk viceroy-turned Ottoman governor, Janbirdi al-Ghazali. Until 1571, the \"umara' al-hajj\" for Damascus were nominated from the high-ranking \"mamluks\" of Damascus, but afterward, \"mamluks\" and local leaders from lesser cities and towns such as Gaza, Ajlun, Nablus and al-Karak led the caravan with general success. \n\nIn 1708, the Ottoman imperial government adopted a new policy whereby the wali (governor) of Damascus would serve as the \"amir al-hajj\". With this change in policy also came an elevation of the Damascene commander's rank. From then on, his rank was superior to that of the Cairene commander, any imperial Ottoman official traveling with the caravan, the Ottoman governor of the Hejaz in Jeddah, and the Meccan \"sharifs\". The Arab al-Azm family of Damascus were able to hold on as governors of Damascus for lengthy periods partly due to their success commanding the caravan. \n\nWhen the Wahhabis first took control of the Hejaz in the early 19th century, they prohibited the carrying of the \"maḥmal\" and the musicians, but when Muhammad Ali recovered the area in 1811, they were reinstated. When the Saudis recaptured the Hejaz in 1925, the ban was re-applied. The exclusivity of the \"amir al-hajj\" office enjoyed by the governors of Damascus ended sometime in the mid-19th century when the Ottomans regained control of Syria from Muhammad Ali's Egyptian forces. The security threat from Bedouin raiders also decreased during that time. From then on, \"amir al-hajj\" became an honorary office typically occupied by a Damascene notable. When the Ottomans lost their nominal authority over Egypt in 1911, the Sultan of Egypt assigned an \"amir al-hajj\" by decree on a yearly basis, although by then the importance of the office had receded significantly amid radical political changes occurring in the country.\n\nThe defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in World War I signalled an end to the Damascene \"amir al-hajj\". The dynasty of Muhammad Ali in Egypt continued to appoint an \"amir al-hajj\" for the Cairo caravan until its fall in 1952. The office was continued by the new republican government for two years, before it was finally abolished.\n\n"}

It appears to the spectator that anyone lying on this \"bed\" would be injured by the nails, but this is not so. Assuming the nails are numerous enough, the weight is distributed among them so that the pressure exerted by each nail is not enough to puncture the person's skin.\n\nOne use of such a device is for magic tricks or physics demonstrations. A famous example requires a volunteer to lie on a bed of several thousand nails, with a board on top of him. Cinder blocks are placed on the board and then smashed with a sledgehammer. Despite the seemingly unavoidable force, the volunteer is not harmed: the force from the blow is spread among the thousands of nails, resulting in reduced pressure; the breaking of the blocks also dissipates much of the energy from the hammer. This demonstration of the principles of weight distribution requires that the weight of the volunteer be spread over as many nails as possible. The most dangerous part is the moment of lying down or getting up, when one's weight may briefly be supported on only a few nails. Some \"beds\" have rails mounted at the sides to help users lie down and get up safely.\n\nThe bed of nails is used by some for meditation, particularly in Asia, and for certain alleged health benefits, such as back pain relief, see acupressure mat.\n\nLess traditional settings, such as science centers, may use an electronic retractable bed of nails, where the user lies on a flat plastic bed with holes in it, and can then activate the machine to have nails rise up all at once. The nails should retract before getting off the bed. This retraction eliminates the most dangerous part of a traditional bed of nails, getting on and off the bed.\n\n'Most motorcycles driven over the body while lying on a bed of nails' - was achieved by Simone Calati (Italy) on 12 May 2013 when he had 31 motorbikes driven over him in two minutes while lying on a bed of nails.\n\n'Heaviest concrete block break on a bed of nails' - was achieved by Neal Hardy (Australia) on 12 February 2012 when he had 15 blocks weighing 774.99 kg (1708 lb 8 oz) placed on his chest and broken.\n\n'The most melons chopped in half on somebody’s stomach (with a samurai sword while they lay on a bed of nails)' - was achieved by Johnny Strange (UK) on 13 October 2013 when he chopped 10 watermelons in half on the stomach of his assistant in 30 seconds.\n\n'Most-layered bed of nails sandwich' - was achieved by Vispi and his Team (all India) on 23 February 2011 when they performed a five-layer bed of nails sandwich.\n\n"}

He was briefly active as a priest in the Church of England. He was Laudian Professor of Arabic at the University of Oxford from 1889 to 1937.\n\nHis father, Ezekiel, had converted from Judaism to Anglicanism, and thereafter worked in Bethnal Green as a missionary to the Jews; he was also close to his uncle, the Anglican convert Moses Margoliouth. Margoliouth was educated at Winchester, where he was a scholar, and at New College, Oxford where he graduated with a double first in Greats and won an unprecedented number of prizes in Classics and Oriental languages, of which he had mastered Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Armenian and Syriac, in addition to Hebrew. His academic dissertation, published in 1888, was entitled \"Analecta Orientalia ad Poeticam Aristoteleam.\" In 1889 he succeeded to the Laudian Chair in Arabic, a position he held until he retired, from ill health, in 1937. He received the degree Doctor of Letters (D. Litt.) from the New College, Oxford, in July 1902.\n\nMany of his works on the history of Islam became the standard treatises in English, including \"Mohammed and the Rise of Islam\" (1905), \"The Early Development of Mohammedanism\" (1914), and \"The Relations Between Arabs and Israelites Prior to the Rise of Islam\" (1924).\n\nHe was described as a brilliant editor and translator of Arabic works, as seen in \"The Letters of Abu'l-'Ala of Ma'arrat al-Nu'man\" (1898), \"Yaqut's Dictionary of Learned Men\", 6 vol. (1907–27), and the chronicle of Miskawayh, prepared in collaboration with H. F. Amedroz under the title \"The Eclipse of the 'Abbasid Caliphate\", 7 vol. (1920–21).\nSome of David Samuel Margoliouth's studies are included in \"\" edited by Ibn Warraq.\n\nHe identified a business letter written in the Judeo-Persian language, found in Dandan Uiliq, northwest China, in 1901, as dating from 718 C.E. (the earliest evidence showing the presence of Jews in China).\n\nHe was a member of the council of the Royal Asiatic Society from 1905 onwards, its director in 1927, was awarded its triennial gold medal in 1928, and was its president 1934-37.\n\nEgyptian Poet Laureate Ahmed Shawqi dedicated his famous poem, The Nile, to Margoliouth.\n\nAn article written in a polemical tone speaks of D.S. Margoliouth's \"fabulous conspiracy theor[y]\"; an \"(in)famous theory\" that \"the poems we know of as pre-Islamic were actual forgeries of a later Islamic period.\"\n\nSimilarly, the Pakistani Islamic scholar Javed Ghamidi spoke of \"the recent campaign to cast aspersions on the relevance and reliability of the whole corpus of classical Arabic literature of the Jahiliyyah period which began with ‘Usul al-Shu‘ara al-‘Arabi’ by the famous orientalist D.S. Margoliouth ... \"\n\nHowever, a look at D.S. Margoliouth's own writings on Pre-Islamic Arabic poetry reveals that his views were not so black and white as has been claimed in, for instance, the above-mentioned examples, but in fact had shades of gray which indicate scholarly caution and reserve in the face of paucity of data.\n\nIn his \"Mohammed and the Rise of Islam\" (1st Edition, G. P. Putnam's Sons: New York etc., 1905), Margoliouth wrote: \"The language of the Koran was thought by experts to bear a striking likeness to that of the early poetry: and though for us it is difficult to pass an opinion on this point, seeing that the early poetry is largely fabrication modelled on the Koran, we may accept the opinion of the Arabs.\" (p. 60)\n\nIn an article in the \"Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics\" (Edinburgh: T. & T. Clark, 1915), Margoliouth writes: \"The relation of this Qur'anic style to the verse and rhymed prose of classical Arabic is an enigma which cannot at present be solved.\" (Vol. VIII, p. 874)\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20412121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20412121", "title": "Depictions of Muhammad", "text": "Depictions of Muhammad\n\nThe permissibility of depictions of Muhammad in Islam has been a contentious issue. Oral and written descriptions of Muhammad are readily accepted by all traditions of Islam, but there is disagreement about visual depictions. The Quran does not explicitly forbid images of Muhammad, but there are a few hadith (supplemental teachings) which have explicitly prohibited Muslims from creating visual depictions of figures. It is agreed on all sides that there is no authentic visual tradition as to the appearance of Muhammad, although there are early legends of portraits of him, and written physical descriptions whose authenticity is often accepted.\n\nThe question of whether images in Islamic art, including those depicting Muhammad, can be considered as religious art remains a matter of contention among scholars. They appear in illustrated books that are normally works of history or poetry, including those with religious subjects; the Quran is never illustrated: \"context and intent are essential to understanding Islamic pictorial art. The Muslim artists creating images of Muhammad, and the public who beheld them, understood that the images were not objects of worship. Nor were the objects so decorated used as part of religious worship\".\n\nHowever, scholars concede that such images have \"a spiritual element\", and were also sometimes used in informal religious devotions celebrating the day of the Mi'raj. Many visual depictions only show Muhammad with his face veiled, or symbolically represent him as a flame; other images, notably from before about 1500, show his face. With the notable exception of modern-day Iran, depictions of Muhammad were rare, never numerous in any community or era throughout Islamic history, and appeared almost exclusively in the private medium of Persian and other miniature book illustration. The key medium of public religious art in Islam was and is calligraphy. In Ottoman Turkey the hilya developed as a decorated visual arrangement of texts about Muhammad that was displayed as a portrait might be.\n\nVisual images of Muhammad in the non-Islamic West have always been infrequent. In the Middle Ages they were mostly hostile, and most often appear in illustrations of Dante's poetry. In the Renaissance and Early Modern period, Muhammad was sometimes depicted, typically in a more neutral or heroic light. These depictions began to encounter protests from Muslims, and in the age of the internet, a handful of caricature depictions printed in the European press have caused global protests and controversy, and been associated with violence.\n\nIn Islam, although nothing in the Quran explicitly bans images, some supplemental hadith explicitly ban the drawing of images of any living creature; other hadith tolerate images, but never encourage them. Hence, most Muslims avoid visual depictions of Muhammad or any other prophet such as Moses or Abraham.\n\nMost Sunni Muslims believe that visual depictions of all the prophets of Islam should be prohibited and are particularly averse to visual representations of Muhammad. The key concern is that the use of images can encourage idolatry. In Shia Islam, however, images of Muhammad are quite common nowadays, even though Shia scholars historically were against such depictions. Still, many Muslims who take a stricter view of the supplemental traditions will sometimes challenge any depiction of Muhammad, including those created and published by non-Muslims.\n\nSome major religions have experienced times during their history when images of their religious figures were forbidden. In Judaism, one of the Ten Commandments forbids \"graven images\". In Byzantine Christianity during the periods of Iconoclasm in the 8th century, and again during the 9th century, visual representations of sacred figures were forbidden, and only the Cross could be depicted in churches. The visual representation of Jesus and other religious figures remains a concern in parts of Protestant Christianity.\n\nA number of \"hadith\" and other writings of the early Islamic period include stories in which portraits of Muhammad appear. Abu Hanifa Dinawari, Ibn al-Faqih, Ibn Wahshiyya and Abu Nu`aym tell versions of a story in which the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius is visited by two Meccans. He shows them a cabinet, handed down to him from Alexander the Great and originally created by God for Adam, each of whose drawers contains a portrait of a prophet. They are astonished to see a portrait of Muhammad in the final drawer. Sadid al-Din al-Kazaruni tells a similar story in which the Meccans are visiting the king of China. Kisa'i tells that God did indeed give portraits of the prophets to Adam.\n\nIbn Wahshiyya and Abu Nu'ayn tell a second story in which a Meccan merchant visiting Syria is invited to a Christian monastery where a number of sculptures and paintings depict prophets and saints. There he sees the images of Muhammad and Abu Bakr, as yet unidentified by the Christians. In an 11th-century story, Muhammad is said so have sat for a portrait by an artist retained by Sassanid king Kavadh II. The king liked the portrait so much that he placed it on his pillow.\n\nLater, Al-Maqrizi tells a story in which Muqawqis, ruler of Egypt, meets with Muhammad's envoy. He asks the envoy to describe Muhammad and checks the description against a portrait of an unknown prophet which he has on a piece of cloth. The description matches the portrait.\n\nIn a 17th-century Chinese story, the king of China asks to see Muhammad, but Muhammad instead sends his portrait. The king is so enamoured of the portrait that he is converted to Islam, at which point the portrait, having done its job, disappears.\n\nIn one of the earliest sources, Ibn Sa'd's \"Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir\", there are numerous verbal descriptions of Muhammad. One description sourced to Ali ibn Abi Talib is as follows:\n\nFrom the Ottoman period onwards such texts have been presented on calligraphic \"hilya\" panels (Turkish: \"hilye\", pl. \"hilyeler\"), commonly surrounded by an elaborate frame of illuminated decoration and either included in books or, more often, muraqqas or albums, or sometimes placed in wooden frames so that they can hang on a wall. The elaborated form of the calligraphic tradition was founded in the 17th century by the Ottoman calligrapher Hâfiz Osman. While containing a concrete and artistically appealing description of Muhammad's appearance, they complied with the strictures against figurative depictions of Muhammad, leaving his appearance to the viewer's imagination. Several parts of the complex design were named after parts of the body, from the head downwards, indicating the explicit intention of the hilya as a substitute for a figurative depiction.\n\nThe Ottoman \"hilye\" format customarily starts with a basmala, shown on top, and is separated in the middle by : \"And We have not sent you but as a mercy to the worlds\". Four compartments set around the central one often contain the names of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali, each followed by \"radhi Allahu anhu\" (\"may God be pleased with him\").\n\nThe most common visual representation of the Muhammad in Islamic art, especially in Arabic-speaking areas, is by a calligraphic representation of his name, a sort of monogram in roughly circular form, often given a decorated frame. Such inscriptions are normally in Arabic, and may rearrange or repeat forms, or add a blessing or honorific, or for example the word \"messenger\" or a contraction of it. The range of ways of representing Muhammad's name is considerable, including ambigrams; he is also frequently symbolised by a rose.\n\nThe more elaborate versions relate to other Islamic traditions of special forms of calligraphy such as those writing the names of God, and the secular tughra or elaborate monogram of Ottoman rulers.\n\nThroughout Islamic history, depictions of Muhammad in Islamic art were rare. Even so, there exists a \"notable corpus of images of Muhammad produced, mostly in the form of manuscript illustrations, in various regions of the Islamic world from the thirteenth century through modern times\". Depictions of Muhammad date back to the start of the tradition of Persian miniatures as illustrations in books. The illustrated book from the Persianate world (\"Warka and Gulshah\", Topkapi Palace Library H. 841, attributed to Konya 1200–1250) contains the two earliest known Islamic depictions of Muhammad.\n\nThis book dates to before or just around the time of the Mongol invasion of Anatolia in the 1240s, and before the campaigns against Persia and Iraq of the 1250s, which destroyed great numbers of books in libraries. Recent scholarship has noted that, although surviving early examples are now uncommon, generally human figurative art was a continuous tradition in Islamic lands (such as in literature, science, and history); as early as the 8th century, such art flourished during the Abbasid Caliphate (c. 749 - 1258, across Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Mesopotamia, and Persia).\n\nChristiane Gruber traces a development from \"veristic\" images showing the whole body and face, in the 13th to 15th centuries, to more \"abstract\" representations in the 16th to 19th centuries, the latter including the representation of Muhammad by a special type of calligraphic representation, with the older types also remaining in use. An intermediate type, first found from about 1400, is the \"inscribed portrait\" where the face of Muhammad is blank, with \"Ya Muhammad\" (\"O Muhammad\") or a similar phrase written in the space instead; these may be related to Sufi thought. In some cases the inscription appears to have been an underpainting that would later be covered by a face or veil, so a pious act by the painter, for his eyes alone, but in others it was intended to be seen. According to Gruber, a good number of these paintings later underwent iconoclastic mutilations, in which the facial features of Muhammad were scratched or smeared, as Muslim views on the acceptability of veristic images changed.\n\nA number of extant Persian manuscripts representing Muhammad date from the Ilkhanid period under the new Mongol rulers, including a \"Marzubannama\" dating to 1299. The Ilkhanid MS Arab 161 of 1307/8 contains 25 illustrations found in an illustrated version of Al-Biruni's \"The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries\", of which five include depictions Muhammad, including the two concluding images, the largest and most accomplished in the manuscript, which emphasize the relation of Muhammad and `Ali according to Shi`ite doctrine. According to Christiane Gruber, other works use images to promote Sunni Islam, such as a set of Mi'raj illustrations (MS H 2154) in the early 14th century, although other historians have dated the same illustrations to the Jalayrid period of Shia rulers.\nDepictions of Muhammad are also found in Persian manuscripts in the following Timurid and Safavid dynasties, and Turkish Ottoman art in the 14th to 17th centuries, and beyond. Perhaps the most elaborate cycle of illustrations of Muhammad's life is the copy, completed in 1595, of the 14th-century biography \"Siyer-i Nebi\" commissioned by the Ottoman sultan Murat III for his son, the future Mehmed III, containing over 800 illustrations.\n\nProbably the commonest narrative scene represented is the Mi'raj; according to Gruber, \"There exist countless single-page paintings of the meʿrāj included in the beginnings of Persian and Turkish romances and epic stories produced from the beginning of the 15th century to the 20th century\". These images were also used in celebrations of the anniversary of the Mi'raj on 27 Rajab, when the accounts were recited aloud to male groups: \"Didactic and engaging, oral stories of the ascension seem to have had the religious goal of inducing attitudes of praise among their audiences\". Such practices are most easily documented in the 18th and 19th centuries, but manuscripts from much earlier appear to have fulfilled the same function. Otherwise a large number of different scenes may be represented at times, from Muhammad's birth to the end of his life, and his existence in Paradise.\n\nIn the earliest depictions Muhammad may be shown with or without a halo, the earliest halos being round in the style of Christian art, but before long a flaming halo or aureole in the Buddhist or Chinese tradition becomes more common than the circular form found in the West, when a halo is used. A halo or flame may surround only his head, but often his whole body, and in some images the body itself cannot be seen for the halo. This \"luminous\" form of representation avoided the issues caused by \"veristic\" images, and could be taken to convey qualities of Muhammad's person described in texts. If the body is visible, the face may be covered with a veil (see gallery for examples of both types). This form of representation, which began at the start of the Safavid period in Persia, was done out of reverence and respect. Other prophets of Islam, and Muhammad's wives and relations, may be treated in similar ways if they also appear.\n\nT. W. Arnold (1864–1930), an early historian of Islamic art, stated that \"Islam has never welcomed painting as a handmaid of religion as both Buddhism and Christianity have done. Mosques have never been decorated with religious pictures, nor has a pictorial art been employed for the instruction of the heathen or for the edification of the faithful.\" Comparing Islam to Christianity, he also writes: \"Accordingly, there has never been any historical tradition in the religious painting of Islam – no artistic development in the representation of accepted types – no schools of painters of religious subjects; least of all has there been any guidance on the part of leaders of religious thought corresponding to that of ecclesiastical authorities in the Christian Church.\"\n\nImages of Muhammad remain controversial to the present day, and are not considered acceptable in many countries in the Middle East. For example, in 1963 an account by a Turkish author of a Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca was banned in Pakistan because it contained reproductions of miniatures showing Muhammad unveiled.\n\nDespite the ban on the representation of Muhammad, images of Muhammed are not uncommon in Iran. The Iranian Shi'ism seems more tolerant on this point than Sunnite orthodoxy. In Iran, depictions have considerable acceptance to the present day, and may be found in the modern forms of the poster and postcard.\n\nSince the late 1990s, experts in Islamic iconography discovered images, printed on paper in Iran, portraying Mohammed as a teenager wearing a turban. There are several variants, all show the same juvenile face, identified by an inscription such as \"Muhammad, the Messenger of God\", or a more detailed legend referring to an episode in the life of Muhammad and the supposed origin of the image. Some Iranian versions of these posters attributed the original depiction to a Bahira, a Christian monk who met the young Muhammad in Syria. By crediting the image to a Christian and predating it to the time before Muhammad became a prophet, the manufacturers of the image exonerate themselves from any wrongdoing.\n\nThe motif was taken from a photograph of a young Tunisian taken by the Germans Rudolf Franz Lehnert and Ernst Heinrich Landrock in 1905 or 1906, which had been printed in high editions on picture post cards till 1921. This depiction has been popular in Iran as a form of curiosity.\n\nIn Tehran, a mural depicting the prophet – his face veiled – riding Buraq was installed at a public road intersection in 2008, the only mural of its kind in a Muslim-majority country.\n\nVery few films have been made about Muhammad. The 1976 film \"The Message\", also known as \"Mohammad, Messenger of God\", focused on other persons and never directly showed Muhammad or most members of his family. A devotional cartoon called \"\" was released in 2004. An Iranian film directed by Majid Majidi was released in 2015 named \"Muhammad\". It is the first part of the trilogy film series on Muhammad by Majid Majidi.\n\nWhile Sunni Muslims have always explicitly prohibited the depiction of Muhammad on film, contemporary Shi'a scholars have taken a more relaxed attitude, stating that it is permissible to depict Muhammad, even in television or movies, if done with respect.\n\nWestern representations of Muhammad were very rare until the explosion of images following the invention of the printing press; he is shown in a few medieval images, normally in an unflattering manner, often influenced by his brief mention in Dante's \"Divine Comedy\". Muhammad sometimes figures in Western depictions of groups of influential people in world history. Such depictions tend to be favourable or neutral in intent; one example can be found at the United States Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.. Created in 1935, the frieze includes major historical lawgivers, and places Muhammad alongside Hammurabi, Moses, Confucius, and others. In 1997, a controversy erupted surrounding the frieze, and tourist materials have since been edited to describe the depiction as \"a well-intentioned attempt by the sculptor to honor Muhammad\" that \"bears no resemblance to Muhammad.\"\n\nIn 1955, a statue of Muhammad was removed from a courthouse in New York City after the ambassadors of Indonesia, Pakistan, and Egypt requested its removal. The extremely rare representations of Muhammad in monumental sculpture are especially likely to be offensive to Muslims, as the statue is the classic form for idols, and a fear of any hint of idolatry is the basis of Islamic prohibitions. Islamic art has almost always avoided large sculptures of any subject, especially free-standing ones; only a few animals are known, mostly fountain-heads, like those in the Lion Court of the Alhambra; the Pisa Griffin is perhaps the largest.\n\nIn 1997, the Council on American–Islamic Relations, a Muslim advocacy group in the United States, wrote to United States Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist requesting that the sculpted representation of Muhammad on the north frieze inside the Supreme Court building be removed or sanded down. The court rejected CAIR's request.\n\nThere have also been numerous book illustrations showing Muhammad.\n\nDante, in \"The Divine Comedy: Inferno\", placed Muhammad in Hell, with his entrails hanging out (Canto 28):\n\nThis scene was sometimes shown in illustrations of the \"Divina Commedia\" before modern times. Muhammad is represented in a 15th-century fresco \"Last Judgement\" by Giovanni da Modena and drawing on Dante, in the Church of San Petronio, Bologna, Italy. and artwork by Salvador Dalí, Auguste Rodin, William Blake, and Gustave Doré.\n\nThe start of the 21st century has been marked by controversies over depictions of Muhammad, not only for recent caricatures or cartoons, but also regarding the display of historical artwork.\nIn a story on morals at the end of the millennium in December 1999, the German news magazine \"Der Spiegel\" printed on the same page pictures of “moral apostles” Muhammad, Jesus, Confucius, and Immanuel Kant. In the subsequent weeks, the magazine received protests, petitions and threats against publishing the picture of Muhammad. The Turkish TV-station Show TV broadcast the telephone number of an editor who then received daily calls.\n\nNadeem Elyas, leader of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany said that the picture should not be printed again in order to avoid hurting the feelings of Muslims intentionally. Elyas recommended to whiten the face of Muhammad instead.\n\nIn June 2001, the \"Spiegel\" with consideration of Islamic laws published a picture of Muhammed with a whitened face on its title page. The same picture of Muhammad by Hosemann had been published by the magazine once before in 1998 in a special edition on Islam, but then without evoking similar protests.\n\nIn 2002, Italian police reported that they had disrupted a terrorist plot to destroy a church in Bologna, which contains a 15th-century fresco depicting an image of Muhammad (see above).\n\nExamples of depictions of Muhammad being altered include a 1940 mural at the University of Utah having the name of Muhammad removed from beneath the painting in 2000 at the request of Muslim students.\n\nIn 2005, Danish newspaper \"Jyllands-Posten\" published a set of editorial cartoons, many of which depicted Muhammad. In late 2005 and early 2006, Danish Muslim organizations ignited a controversy through public protests and by spreading knowledge of the publication of the cartoons. According to John Woods, Islamic history professor at the University of Chicago, it was not simply the depiction of Muhammad that was offensive, but the implication that Muhammad was somehow a supporter of terrorism. In Sweden, an online caricature competition was announced in support of \"Jyllands-Posten\", but Foreign Affairs Minister Laila Freivalds and the Swedish Security Service pressured the internet service provider to shut the page down. In 2006, when her involvement was revealed to the public, she had to resign. On 12 February 2008 the Danish police arrested three men alleged to be involved in a plot to assassinate Kurt Westergaard, one of the cartoonists.\nIn 2006, the controversial American animated television comedy program \"South Park\", which had previously depicted Muhammad as a superhero character in the July 4, 2001 episode \"Super Best Friends\" and has depicted Muhammad in the opening sequence since that episode, attempted to satirize the Danish newspaper incident. In the episode, \"Cartoon Wars Part II\", they intended to show Muhammad handing a salmon helmet to Peter Griffin, a character from the Fox animated series \"Family Guy\". However, Comedy Central, who airs \"South Park\", rejected the scene, citing concerns of violent protests in the Islamic world. The creators of \"South Park\" reacted by instead satirizing Comedy Central's double standard for broadcast acceptability by including a segment of \"Cartoon Wars Part II\" in which American president George W. Bush and Jesus defecate on the flag of the United States.\n\nThe Lars Vilks Muhammad drawings controversy began in July 2007 with a series of drawings by Swedish artist Lars Vilks which depicted Muhammad as a roundabout dog. Several art galleries in Sweden declined to show the drawings, citing security concerns and fear of violence. The controversy gained international attention after the Örebro-based regional newspaper \"Nerikes Allehanda\" published one of the drawings on August 18 to illustrate an editorial on self-censorship and freedom of religion.\n\nWhile several other leading Swedish newspapers had published the drawings already, this particular publication led to protests from Muslims in Sweden as well as official condemnations from several foreign governments including Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Egypt and Jordan, as well as by the inter-governmental Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC). The controversy occurred about one and a half years after the \"Jyllands-Posten\" Muhammad cartoons controversy in Denmark in early 2006.\n\nAnother controversy emerged in September 2007 when Bangladeshi cartoonist Arifur Rahman was detained on suspicion of showing disrespect to Muhammad. The interim government confiscated copies of the Bengali-language \"Prothom Alo\" in which the drawings appeared. The cartoon consisted of a boy holding a cat conversing with an elderly man. The man asks the boy his name, and he replies \"Babu\". The older man chides him for not mentioning the name of Muhammad before his name.\n\nHe then points to the cat and asks the boy what it is called, and the boy replies \"Muhammad the cat\". The cartoon caused a firestorm in Bangladesh, with militant Islamists demanding that Rahman be executed for blasphemy. A group of people torched copies of the paper and several Islamic groups protested, saying the drawings ridiculed Mohammad and his companions. They demanded \"exemplary punishment\" for the paper's editor and the cartoonist. Bangladesh does not have a blasphemy law, although one had been demanded by the same extremist Islamic groups.\n\nOn November 2, 2010, the office of the French satirical weekly newspaper \"Charlie Hebdo\" at Paris was attacked with a firebomb and its website hacked, after it had announced plans to publish a special edition with Muhammad as its “chief editor”, and the title page with a cartoon of Muhammad had been pre-issued on social media.\n\nIn September 2012, the newspaper published a series of satirical cartoons of Muhammad, some of which feature nude caricatures of him. In January 2013, \"Charlie Hebdo\" announced that they would make a comic book on the life of Muhammad. In March 2013, Al-Qaeda's branch in Yemen, commonly known as Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), released a hit list in an edition of their English-language magazine \"Inspire\". The list included Stéphane Charbonnier, Lars Vilks, three \"Jyllands-Posten\" employees involved in the Muhammad cartoon controversy, Molly Norris from the Everybody Draw Mohammed Day and others whom AQAP accused of insulting Islam.\n\nOn January 7, 2015, the office was attacked again with 12 shot dead including Stéphane Charbonnier.\n\nIn 2008, several Muslims protested against the inclusion of Muhammad's depictions in the English Wikipedia's \"Muhammad\" article.\nThe petition opposed a reproduction of a 17th-century Ottoman copy of a 14th-century Ilkhanate manuscript image (MS Arabe 1489) depicting Muhammad as he prohibited Nasīʾ. Jeremy Henzell-Thomas of \"The American Muslim\" deplored the petition as one of \"these mechanical knee-jerk reactions [which] are gifts to those who seek every opportunity to decry Islam and ridicule Muslims and can only exacerbate a situation in which Muslims and the Western media seem to be locked in an ever-descending spiral of ignorance and mutual loathing.\"\n\nWikipedia considered but rejected a compromise that would allow visitors to choose whether to view the page with images. The Wikipedia community has not acted upon the petition. The site's answers to frequently asked questions about these images state that Wikipedia does not censor itself for the benefit of any one group.\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art in January 2010 confirmed to the \"New York Post\" that it had quietly removed all historic paintings which contained depictions of Muhammad from public exhibition. The Museum quoted objections on the part of conservative Muslims which were \"under review.\" The museum's action was criticized as excessive political correctness, as were other decisions taken close to the same time, including the renaming of the \"Primitive Art Galleries\" to the \"Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas\" and the projected \"Islamic Galleries\" to \"Arab Lands, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia and Later South Asia\".\n\nEverybody Draw Mohammed Day was a protest against those who threatened violence against artists who drew representations of Muhammad. It began as a protest against the action of Comedy Central in forbidding the broadcast of the \"South Park\" episode \"201\" in response to death threats against some of those responsible for the segment. Observance of the day began with a drawing posted on the Internet on April 20, 2010, accompanied by text suggesting that \"everybody\" create a drawing representing Muhammad, on May 20, 2010, as a protest against efforts to limit freedom of speech.\n\nA May 3, 2015, event held in Garland, Texas, held by American activists Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer, was the scene of a shooting by two individuals who were later themselves shot and killed outside the event. Police officers assisting in security at the event returned fire and killed the two gunmen. The event offered a $10,000 prize and was said to be in response to the January 2015 attacks on the French magazine \"Charlie Hebdo\". One of the gunmen was identified as a former terror suspect, known to the FBI.\n\n\nGeneral:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "57405426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57405426", "title": "Festival of Santa Esterica", "text": "Festival of Santa Esterica\n\nThe Festival of Santa Esterica is a holiday that was created as a substitute for Purim by the Anusim (also known as \"conversos\", Sephardi Jews forced to convert to Catholicism) after their expulsion from Spain in the late 15th century. It is still celebrated today in the Latin America and Southwestern United States.\n\nThe conversos who wanted to maintain their identity as Jews fled to Portugal, yet they had to face another religiously based persecution of Jews and Muslims by Manuel I of Portugal and expulsion in 1497, this was what brought them and the festival to the New World.\n\nThe festival was themed about a fictional saint called \"Esterica\" who was heavily based upon Queen Esther. During the festival the New Christian women fasted for 3 days as Esther herself, her uncle Mordechai and the Jews of Persia did in the Book of Esther prior to her meeting with King Achashverosh.\n\nAlthough it was dangerous for the conversos to celebrate this festival due to its Jewish elements, as the Inquisition demanded no traits of their former religion be preserved, there are documents from Mexico that confirm the Festival of Esterica was held in Mexico as well. According to historian Janet Liebman Jacobs, converso women used to light candles and cook a kosher banquet with their daughters - which helped passing out knowledge of the traditional Jewish cuisine to the next generations. The public festival celebrations had became private events that was celebrated with the family indoors. The conversos had also started to honor Esther with iconographic art pieces they made in her image and held in their households.\n\nIn 1643 a conversos' descendant named Gabriel de Grande from Mexico confessed that the women of his family had divided the three days of fasting between them so each will only fast for one day. The Mexican Inquisition had been alerted of that and him and his family were burnt alive on the stake for Judaizing.\n\nMoshe Orfali claims in his book \"The Fast of Esther in the Lore of the Marranos\" that the conversos lived with the non-stopping feeling of sin since they had to act like Christians towards the outside world while deep inside were Jewish, and that the fast helped them to feel as they were making up for their sin to God.\n\nThe popularity of the Festival of Santa Esterica had begun to decrease between the years 1964 to 1974 following the statements of Santa Fe Archbishop, Peter Davis, who studied the festival and had begun preaching to Hispanics who did celebrate it that they're actually practicing a Jewish holiday based on Purim and that there was no such saint called Esterica. As a result of that it is less common to find iconographic Esterica art pieces at Southwestern United States houses today in comparison to the 20th century and prior to that.\n\nAccording to \"The Book of Esther in Modern Research\" by Leonard Greenspoon and Sidnie White Crawford, in the iconographic Esterica pieces that were common in the Americas the saint was depicted wearing a Crown on her head and holding a hanging rope. They interpret these motifs as signs of Judaism being grasped as something royal that comes with the risk of getting caught by the Christians and end the conversos' lives in hanging.\n\nIn New Mexico, the art that decorated the conversos' houses with Santa Esterica were portrayed with red curtains that frame the icona.\n"}

An emerging \"free market\" of religious choices led Americans to become increasingly pluralistic and tolerant of other forms of Christianity. The voluntary nature of religious association led Americans to take ownership of their own institutions and churches, helping create a democratic sense of responsibility for creating associations and community. These features of American culture, along with the First Amendment's separation of church and state, ensured that American religions could only survive by appealing to the common people. This democratized American Christianity, leading average Americans to shape religious movements themselves. In the post-Revolutionary period, all this led America in an increasingly pluralist and democratic direction.\n\nMicklethwait and Wooldridge argue that the religions growing around the world tend to exhibit these same features. World religions—and Christianity, in particular—are growing fastest where they are: competing with other religious alternatives, unsupported by state governments, and entirely dependent upon popular interest. Writing against the fear that the growth of religion will increase warfare and strife, Micklethwait and Wooldridge argue that a democratic and pluralistic culture would help minimize these dangers while maximizing the benefits of religion. Finally, while the authors suggest that Islam too could be modernized and introduced to a pluralistic culture, they suspect that Islam is less amenable for this transition than Christianity.\n\n\"Kirkus Reviews\" called it \"A meaningful contribution to the ongoing conversation about the place of faith in modern life.\"\n"}

There are about 270,000 Hindus in Guyana, 150,000 in Suriname, and some others in French Guiana. In Guyana, Hindus form 35% of the population.\nArgentina has 2,030 persons of Indian origin (PIOs) and 1,300 non-resident Indians (NRIs). Some of them still refer to ayurveda, practice yoga, enjoy Indian classical music and speak the Hindi language.\n\nThey have established an Indian Association in the northern provinces and organise social and cultural events to celebrate Indian festivals. Unfortunately, there is little interaction between them and those who have settled down in other parts of the extensive country.\n\nA large number of the Indian diaspora living in Buenos Aires are businessmen, doctors, financial\nor business executives, and employees of multinational corporations. Most of them have retained\ntheir Indian citizenship. \n\nMany Hindus are Indo-Caribbeans from Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Suriname.\n\nMost of the Brazilian Hindus are ethnic East Indians. There are 1,500 PIOs and about 400 NRIs in Brazil.\n\nA small number of Sindhis that arrived from Suriname and Central America in 1960 to set up shop as traders in the city of Manaus is considered to be the first wave of immigration. The second wave consisted of university professors who arrived in the 1960s and also in the 1970s.\n\nOther PIOs migrated to this country from various African countries, mainly from former Portuguese colonies (especially Mozambique), soon after their independence in the 1970s. The number of PIOs in Brazil has been augmented in recent years by the arrival of nuclear scientists and computer professionals.\n\nThere are as many as 1,500 PIOs among the Indian community in Brazil, and only 400 NRIs, since foreign nationals can acquire local citizenship without any discrimination after 15 years of domicile in this country. Brazil has also no bar against dual citizenship. But in recent years, it has been granting immigration visas only in high technology fields. The only exceptions are the Sindhis in Manaus (who have formed an Indian Association with about a hundred members) and the Goans in São Paulo.\n\nA few Indians had gone to Chile in the 1920s. The others migrated there about 30 years ago — not\nonly from India, but also from Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Nigeria, Panama, the Philippines and\nSingapore.\n\nThe total number of PIOs today does not exceed 650 persons in a country of almost\n16 million people.\n\nBelonging mostly to the Sindhi community, they are usually engaged in trade\nand are reasonably prosperous.\n\nMany of them have married Chilean women and acquired Chilean\nnationality, and yet they have largely remained out of the Chilean mainstream. Some members of\nthe younger generation, being Chilean citizens by birth, have however ventured into professions.\n\nA Hindu Temple exists in Punta Arenas.\n\nBesides Punta Arenas, the Indian business community is also present in Santiago, the capital of Chile, and Iquique. The activities of businessmen in Santiago are mainly confined to imports and retail stores.\n\nSource\n\nHinduism in Colombia was mainly introduced with the arrival of Indians, especially Indian migrant workers from Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. There are ISKCON (\"The Hare-Krishnas\") centers in the capital, Bogota.\n\nMost of the Hindus in French Guiana are of Surinamese origin. According to the 2000 census 1.6% of the total population (3,200 out of 202,000) were Hindu. \n\nAbout 84% of the East Indian immigrants were Hindu. During the indenture period, the East Indian caste system broke down. Hinduism was redefined, and caste-distinguishing practices were eliminated. Christian missionaries attempted to convert East Indians during the indenture period, beginning in 1852, but met with little success. The missionaries blamed the Brahmins for their failure: the Brahmins began administering spiritual rites to all Hindus regardless of caste once the Christian missionaries started proselytizing in the villages, hastening the breakdown of the caste system. After the 1930s, Hindu conversions to Christianity slowed because the status of Hinduism improved and the discrimination against Hindus diminished.\n\nIn areas where there are large percentage of Indo Guyanese residing together — Mandirs of various sizes can be found, according to the population. All main Hindu occasions are observed — Basant Panchami in January to Gita Jayanti in December.\n\nSince the late 1940s, reform movements caught the attention of many Guyanese Hindus. The most important, the Arya Samaj movement, arrived in Guyana in 1910. Arya Samaj doctrine rejects the idea of caste and the exclusive role of Brahmins as religious leaders. The movement preaches monotheism and opposition to the use of images in worship as well as many traditional Hindu rituals. The Arya Samajis often did not get along with the Sanātanīs (orthodox Hindus), but today many have put those differences aside. Approximately between 216,000 and 230,000 identified themselves as Hindus in the 2002 census.\n\nIn the 2002 census, it was estimated that about 551 Hindus live in Paraguay. They make up 0.01% of Paraguay's population. Paraguay's ambassador to India, Mr Pappalardo, gave Punjab farmers a high opportunity to invest the country. Most of the Hindus live in Asunción.\n\nThe first ‘Indian Indians’ to have arrived in Peru were businessmen who had gone there in the early 1960s. Later on, the community grew in number marginally until the early 80s, after which many of its members left due to the severe local economic crises and the prevailing terrorism. Those with relatives in other Latin countries joined them.\n\nIn the recent past, the size of the community has remained stable. There is a small remnant of the original ‘native Indians’ in this country who still maintain their traditional culture and religious beliefs.\n\nMost members of the local Indian community are Sindhis. They are reasonably well-off, but very few can be regarded as prosperous. Their general level of education is low. Most of them speak only their mother tongue and Spanish, with a smattering of English.\n\nThere is also here a small number of professionals from other parts of India. Residence permits are not difficult to obtain in Peru. But citizenship is more complicated and only a small number of Indians have obtained it – not more than 10 out of a total number of almost forty persons. While a few cultural activities are organized by the more enterprising PIOs, in general they maintain a low profile. Considering the vast distance that separates the community from India, its interest in its country of origin is limited to major events, mainly derived from occasional browsing on the internet. But being invariably first generation migrants, many of them do occasionally visit India.\n\nThe story of Hinduism in Suriname is broadly parallel to that in Guyana. Indian indentured labourers were sent to colonial Dutch Guiana by special arrangement between the Dutch and British. \nThe difference is that the Netherlands' more liberal policy toward Hinduism allowed the culture to develop stronger. Examples are the lack of a rigid caste system and the almost universal reading of Gita and Ramayan. \n\nAccording to the 2012 census of Suriname, Hindus constitute 22.3% of the population. Hindus are mostly concentrated in Northern coastal regions of Suriname: Nickerie, Wanica and Saramacca, where they constitute the largest religious group. There are several hindu temples in Suriname.\n\nThere are a few Yoga organizations in Uruguay, which spread Indian thought\nand philosophy-prominent among them are, Sivapremananda Ashram of the Divine\nSociety. A portion of the beach in Montevideo has been named after Mahatma\nGandhi and a bust of Gandhiji installed in one of the parks along the beach. There\nis a school named after him in Montevideo, a street and another school named after\nRepublic of India. There is a small Indian community in Uruguay consisting of 300 members approx.\n\nDuring the oil-related high-income years of the 1970s, there were around 400 NRIs in this country. There are also several thousand of Indo-Caribbeans from Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, and Guyana in the cities of Ciudad Guayana and Caracas.\n\nThe Indian community consisted of personnel from the petroleum and petrochemical sectors, as\nwell as a large number of traders. Many of them had taken their families with them to Venezuela,\nwhether from India or elsewhere. Most of the traders belonged to the Sindhi community but\nthere were also some persons from Gujarat, Punjab and the southern Indian States.\n\nWhen the oil boom ended in 1982, followed by devaluation of the local currency, many of the NRIs decided to seek their fortunes elsewhere. Currently, the Diaspora has been whittled down to half its former size. There are now only about 45 Indian families in Venezuela who are mainly engaged in retail trade. There are also a small number of experts in high tech. industries such as telecommunications.\n\nAll of them have adapted themselves very well to their country of residence and are generally\nheld in high regard by the local people on account of their hard work, expertise and non-political\nnature.\n\nThe Venezuelan Constitution guarantees equal rights without discrimination to all expatriate\npersonnel. This has facilitated the Indian community’s life.\n\nAnother interesting feature is that many local persons are interested in Indian religions and spirituality.\n\nSome members of the Indian community also attend their functions. Most of the NRIs are well educated. However, given their small numbers, they have not formed themselves into an active representative body. But they remain in touch with one another and with the Indian Embassy in Caracas. Even though they have little time to engage in numerous cultural activities, they do\nget together to celebrate Indian festivals like Diwali.\n\nOn the whole, the Indian community in Venezuela is quite prosperous and has a per capita income\nthat is above the national average that is itself as high as US$8,300 in terms of PPP. They take an active part in mobilising donations to help in alleviating distress at times of national calamities in India.\n\nSource\n\n\n\n"}

Other scholars suggested the Shramana traditions were separate and contemporaneous with Indo-Aryan religious practices of the historical Vedic religion. In August 2005, Supreme Court of India gave verdict that Jainism, Sikhism (and Buddhism) are distinct religions, but are inter-connected and inter-related to Hinduism, so these three are part of wider broader Hindu religion, based on the historic background on how the Constitution had come into existence after.

Though Jains already had minority status in 11 states of India including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, in 2005 a petition was filed with Supreme Court of India, by community representatives, which was also backed by the National Minorities Commission. In its judgement the court left the decision to the Central government.\n\nJainism as a religion exists throughout India.

In Iran, the Persian names of the zodiac are used while in Afghanistan the original Arabic names are used, also known as the Solar Hijri Calendar. It gains approximately 1 day on the Julian calendar every 128 years. The tropical Jalali calendar (), which inherited some aspects from the Yazdgerdi calendar, was adopted on 15 March 1079 by the Seljuk Sultan Jalal al-Din Malik Shah I (for whom it was named), based on the recommendations of a committee of astronomers, including Omar Khayyam, at the imperial observatory in his capital city of Isfahan. Month computations were based on solar transits through the zodiac. It remained in use for eight centuries. It arose out of dissatisfaction with the seasonal drift in the Islamic calendar which is due to that calendar being lunar instead of solar; a lunar year of 354 days, while acceptable to a desert nomad people, proved to be unworkable for settled, agricultural peoples, and the Iranian calendar is one of several non-lunar calendars adopted by settled Muslims for agricultural purposes (others include the Coptic calendar, the Julian calendar, and the Semitic calendars of the Near East). Sultan Jalal commissioned the task in 1073. Its work was completed well before the Sultan's death in 1092, after which the observatory would be abandoned.\n\nThe year was computed from the vernal equinox (Nowruz), and each month was determined by the transit\nof the sun into the corresponding zodiac region, a system that incorporated improvements on the ancient Indian system of the Surya Siddhanta (\"Surya\"=solar, \"Siddhanta\"=analysis, 4th century), also the basis of most Hindu calendars. Since the solar transit times can have 24-hour variations, the length of the months vary slightly in different years (each month can be between 29 and 32 days). For example, the months in the two last years of the Jalali calendar had:\n\nBecause months were computed based on precise times of solar transit between zodiacal regions, seasonal drift never exceeded one day, and also there was no need for a leap year in the Jalali calendar. However, this calendar was very difficult to compute; it required full ephemeris computations and actual observations to determine the apparent movement of the Sun. Some claim that simplifications introduced in the intervening years may have introduced a system with eight leap days in every cycle of 33 years. (Different rules, such as the 2820-year cycle, have also been accredited to Khayyam). However, the original Jalali calendar based on observations (or predictions) of solar transit would not have needed either leap years or seasonal adjustments.\n\nOwing to the variations in month lengths, and also the difficulty in computing the calendar itself, the Iranian calendar was modified to simplify these aspects in 1925 (1304 AP), resulting in the Solar Hijri calendar.\n\n"}

Thus, the most stringent of all three, the zavah gedolah state, was accepted as the new norm of minimal tammei period.\n\nThe Torah-based niddah laws were initiated with the reported giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai in the year HC 2448 (-1313 BCE). The stringency was established approximately 1,500 years later, during the amoraic period in approximately HC 3961 (200 CE). The extended lapse in timeline giving way to the stringency is viewed as being an outcome of the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem and the ensuing scattering and turmoil.\n\nTorah commentaries explain that the priests (kohanim) are instructed to differentiate between the blood of niddah, and non-menstrual blood flow zavah (Ibn Ezra to Leviticus 15:1), thus sparing any unneeded stringency. While the absence of their ability to instruct was included in the prophecy of Azaryah (son of Oded) (Divrei HaYamim 2, 15:1) that the kohen will be at a loss to deliver accurate Torah instruction, other texts related a return of the Torah instruction to the kohen and the retraction of the said stringency to the Torah-based 7 day period alone.\n\nThe Talmud Bavli disagrees on how to view the said stringency in terms of it being categorized as a custom or a law, Ravah -in dialogue with his Mentor Rav Pappa, abstained from viewing it as an halakha, saying that it is location-based, with communities fully entitled not to comply. Rashi views Ravah comments to his mentor as hinting that the said stringency evolved into a takanah.\n\nThe Rambam (Hilkhot Issurei Biah 11, 3-4) viewed the stringency as is, a \"stringency\" alone and not a rabbinic enactment, but he nonetheless advocated adherence to it since (by his era) all known communities abided by it, making it as a neder (vow) that is implicitly applicable.\n\nAmong other poskim, Rabbi Avraham HaKohen Kook was of the opinion the stringency is on par with any other rabbinic prohibition, and perhaps lesser than a full-blown rabbinic prohibition. Thus, if need arise to seek leniency from it, leniency may be sought, and applied.\n\n"}

There is also a dichotomy between religious communities and advocates of multiculturalism\n\nThe vocabulary used in such debates may sometimes be either confused or confusing, and the misuse of religiously technical terms as understood in secular societies can, in itself cause religious offence.\n\nThings that are sacred are articles of faith that are beyond question true sources of rapture for believers and followers. Contradiction or misuse is likely to cause religious offense.\n\nThings that are worldly such as technology or professional advice are sometimes separated from things that are holy or sacred for religious people. Some secular activities may be considered profane and so cause religious offense, even though they may be legally permitted. Crime is the secular homologue to religious sin.\n\nActions that are not religiously permitted 'inside the faith' are often prohibited within religiously dominated jurisdictions. Profanity is not necessarily proscribed within secular jurisdictions and so legally permitted actions under common law may sometimes be considered religiously offensive to people used to religious legal structures.\n\nDifferent religions are sensitive to different things in different measure, particularly such topics, as sexuality, infancy, society, and warfare. It would be impossible to itemize all specific offences defined in all jurisdictions.\n\nHowever every religion is essentially a set of beliefs conveyed from generation to generation which are, by religious definition, held to be immutable truths by that religion's believers or followers. Anything that tends to weaken or break that chain of authoritative continuity is likely to be offensive and in some jurisdictions severely punishable.\n\nReligious offense can be caused deliberately or by Religious intolerance, especially between specific religious beliefs regarding 'sacred truth'. The secular belief that freedom of speech and the absence of censorship should allow religious practices or beliefs to be criticized is also a cause of conflict.\n\nThe use or misuse of religious Paraphernalia, particularly scripture may also cause offense. The publication of a prizewinning novel by a Muslim author resulted in several deaths from rioting as well as murders and attempted murders resulting from a decree issued by a religious leader who was religiously offended by the work.\n\nTraditionally there are three uniquely religious offenses (acts which cause religious offense):\n\n\nDogma is the belief that a religion necessarily only ever expresses divine truth. Any challenge to divine authority may be homologous to treason and attract similar serious punishment, typically the death penalty.\n\nMore recently the term is used in modern laws which aim promote religious tolerance by forbidding 'hate crime' such as the British Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006. To allow 'outsiders' to criticize a religion or its practice might appear to serve to weaken or break the chain of intergenerational \"truth-telling\".\n\nThere is a fine line between secular ideas of fair comment and religious offence caused by questioning the veracity of divine revelation.\n\nBlasphemy laws were once almost universal, and are still common in states with strong religious traditions, but such restrictions have been extinguished in most secular jurisdictions that incorporate the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).\n\nArticle 18 of the UDHR allows: \"the right to \"freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance\"; and Article 19 allows: \"the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers\". With these two articles, Article 18 of the UDHR allows people to hold and express religious ideas and other beliefs or a lack of religious belief that may be offensive to others or to the majority of citizens and Article 19 explicitly mandates freedom of speech which permits citizens to criticize leaders in a way that some religious people may find seriously offensive.\n\nSome Islamic traditions found this unacceptable and produced Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam Article 24 of which enshrines Sharia law as supreme, and that judicial code includes severe penalties including death for the three offences of Heresy, Blasphemy, and Apostacy, and also includes capital punishment for Moslems (persons who are born into Islam or swear allegiance to it) who refuse to kill when required to do so according to law.\n\nSome extreme religious leaders in such secular societies campaign for the offence of blasphemy to be reinstated to enforce respect for their various religious beliefs above any scientific or moral challenge.\n\nScience depends on testability, but, as relatively few advanced scientific facts are testable by non-scientists, scientific material is sometimes disseminated by reference to learned material which is assumed to be reliable (as presented in Wikipedia references) in much the same way as religionists quote 'reliable' holy scripture. This may lead to science being taught to young people as a belief in scientific truth in much the same way as religious truths are taught, For example, when instruction or belief is based on faith in received wisdom from scholars or from textbook evidence which may be difficult or impossible for non-specialists to verify.\n\nReligious pseudoscience includes witchcraft that is beyond traditional midwifery practices and sorcery other than traditional medicine, which insists on supernatural or magical or miraculous intervention which is contrary to scientific evidence. For example, the Medieval Catholic faith in Europe was offended by, and persecuted, sometimes killed people whose practices were related to sexuality, particularly now known as midwives.\n\nJustifiable criticism, particularly satirizing of ideas which in secular cultures may seem absurd beliefs, but which are considered incontrovertible religious facts may be interpreted or misinterpreted as either religious persecution or racism if made by outsiders or one of the three traditional offences mentioned above if published by co-religionists.\n\nAn example of this is the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy\n\nReligious law refers to ethical and moral codes taught by religious traditions. Examples include Canon law which is Christian church law, customary \"halakha' the ' Jewish law, Hindu law, and the above mentioned \"Sharia\" or Islamic law.\n\nThe origin of religion is uncertain, but it has been suggested that it evolved for the nurture of children. Certainly much religious law is concerned with sexuality and with childcare.\n\nThe oldest known comprehensive written law dates from almost four thousand years ago. It survives because the sixth Babylonian king, Hammurabi had it inscribed on a human-sized stone \"stele\" erected in cities throughout his kingdom. Fragments of much earlier law codes have also survived via records dating from dawn of writing.\n\nThe subjects that the Code of Hammurabi covers are similar to modern legal codes, for it includes religious observance, social conduct and occupational duties which covers military and contractual obligations as well as the control of slavery throughout all of Babylon at that time.\n\nGender equality is a relatively recent philosophy, mainly evolved in the Western world during the 20th century. Previously, sexual discrimination was socially commonplace and legally institutionalized, perhaps because distinct gender roles may have had some early human survival or historical economic value or else may have promoted social cohesion.\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights dates only from the mid-20th century (it was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1948, and then incorporated into various legal systems some time after that). However UNHDR Articles 1 and 2 had, by the early 21st century, frequently been interpreted by agnostic jurists such that any form of (non-biological) sexual discrimination has become illegal in many secular countries, while in legal jurisdictions strongly influenced by religious considerations sex discrimination may still be legally required and sometimes rigorously enforced.\n\nBecause writing is not susceptible to the sort of corruption common in verbal communication scripture can be revered and held sacred, so any criticism or inclusion in secondary works is likely to be offensive to some religionists. A game which included two short scriptural phrases was considered offensive.\n\n"}
{"id": "26974568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26974568", "title": "Shahada", "text": "Shahada\n\nThe Shahada ( \"\" ,\"the testimony\") is an Islamic creed, one of the Five Pillars of Islam, declaring belief in the oneness of God (\"tawhid\") and the acceptance of Muhammad as God's prophet. The declaration, in its shortest form, reads (right to left in Arabic):\n\nThe noun \"šahāda\" (), from the verbal root \"šahida\" ( ) meaning \"to observe, witness, testify\", translates as \"testimony\" in both the everyday and the legal senses. The Islamic creed is also called, in the dual form, \"šahādatān\" (, literally \"two testimonials\"). The expression \"al-šahāda\" (the Witnessed) is used in Quran as one of the \"titles of God\".\n\nIn Sunni Islam, the \"Shahada\" has two parts: \"la ilaha illa'llah\" (None has the right to be worshipped except God), and \"Muhammadun rasul Allah\" (Muhammad is the messenger of God), which are sometimes referred to as the first \"Shahada\" and the second \"Shahada\". The first statement of the \"Shahada\" is also known as the \"tahlīl\".\n\nIn Shia Islam, the \"Shahada\" also has a third part, a phrase concerning Ali, the first Shia Imam and the fourth Rashid caliph of Sunni Islam: ( ), which translates to \"Ali is the \"wali\" of God\".\n\nIn the Quran, the first statement of the \"Shahadah\" takes the form \"la ilaha illa'llah\" twice (37:35, 47:19), and \"allahu la ilaha illa hu\" (God, None has the right to be worshipped but He) much more often. It appears in the shorter form \"la ilaha illa Hu\" (None has the right to be worshipped except He) in many places. It appears in these forms about 30 times in the Quran, and never attached with the other parts of the \"Shahadah\" in Sunni or Shia Islam or \"in conjunction with another name\".\n\nIslam's monotheistic nature is reflected in the first sentence of the \"Shahada\", which declares belief in the oneness of God and that he is the only entity truly worthy of worship. The second sentence of the \"Shahada\" indicates the means by which God has offered guidance to human beings. The verse reminds Muslims that they accept not only the prophecy of Muhammad but also the long line of prophets who preceded him. While the first part is seen as a cosmic truth, the second is specific to Islam, as it is understood that members of the older Abrahamic religions do not view Muhammad as one of their prophets.\n\nThe \"Shahada\" is a statement of both ritual and worship. In a well-known hadith, Muhammad defines Islam as witnessing that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is God's messenger, giving of alms (\"zakat\"), performing the ritual prayer, fasting during the month of Ramadan and making a pilgrimage to the Kaaba: the \"five pillars\" of Islam are inherent in this declaration of faith.\n\nRecitation of the \"Shahādah\" is the most common statement of faith for Muslims. In Sunni Islam, it is counted as the first of the Five Pillars of Islam, while the Shi'i Twelvers and Isma'ilis also have the \"Shahada\" as among their pillars of faith. It is whispered by the father into the ear of a newborn child, and it is whispered into the ear of a dying person. The five canonical daily prayers each include a recitation of the \"Shahada\". Recitation of the \"Shahada\" in front of witnesses is also the first and only formal step in conversion to Islam. This occasion often attracts more than the two required witnesses and sometimes includes a party-like celebration to welcome the convert into their new faith. In accordance with the central importance played by the notion of intention (, \"niyyah\") in Islamic doctrine, the recitation of the \"Shahada\" must reflect understanding of its import and heartfelt sincerity. Intention is what differentiates acts of devotion from mundane acts and a simple reading of the \"Shahada\" from invoking it as a ritual activity.\n\nThough the two statements of the \"Shahada\" are both present in the Quran (for example, 37:35 and 48:29), they are not found there side by side as in the \"Shahada\" formula. Versions of both phrases began to appear in coins and monumental architecture in the late seventh century, which suggests that it had not been officially established as a ritual statement of faith until then. An inscription in the Dome of the Rock (est. 692) in Jerusalem reads \"There is no god but God alone; He has no partner with him; Muhammad is the messenger of God\". Another variant appears in coins minted after the reign of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, the fifth Umayyad caliph, in the form \"Muhammad is the servant of God and His messenger\". Although it is not clear when the \"Shahada\" first came into common use among Muslims, it is clear that the sentiments it expresses were part of the Quran and Islamic doctrine from the earliest period.\n\nThe \"Shahada\" has been traditionally recited in the Sufi ceremony of \"dhikr\" (, \"remembrance\"), a ritual that resembles mantras found in many other religious traditions. During the ceremony, the \"Shahada\" may be repeated thousands of times, sometimes in the shortened form of the first phrase where the word \"Allah\" is replaced by \"huwa\" (He). The chanting of the \"Shahada\" sometimes provides a rhythmic background for singing.\n\nThe \"Shahada\" appears as an architectural element in Islamic buildings around the world, such as those in Jerusalem, Cairo, and Istanbul.\n\nLate-medieval and renaissance European art displays a fascination with Middle Eastern motifs in general and the Arabic script in particular, as indicated by its use, without concern for its content, in painting, architecture and book illustrations. In his San Giovenale Triptych, the Italian Renaissance artist Masaccio has copied the full \"Shahada\" on the halo of the Madonna, written backwards.\n\nThe \"Shahada\" is found on some Islamic flags.\nWahhabism used the \"Shahada\" on their flags since the 18th century. In 1902, ibn Saud, leader of the House of Saud and the future founder of Saudi Arabia, added a sword to this flag. The modern Flag of Saudi Arabia was introduced in 1973.\nThe Flag of Somaliland has a horizontal strip of green, white and red with the \"Shahada\" inscribed in white on the green strip.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2001, the Taliban used a white flag with the \"Shahada\" inscribed in black as the flag of their Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. The various jihadist black flag used by Islamic insurgents since the 2000s have often followed this example. The \"Shahada\" written on a green background has been used by supporters of Hamas since about 2000. The 2004 draft constitution of Afghanistan proposed a flag featuring the \"Shahada\" in white script centered on a red background. In 2006, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant designed its flag using the \"Shahada\" phrase written in white on black background. The font used is supposedly similar to the font used as seal on the original letters written on Muhammad's behalf.\n\n\n\n"}

The first villages organized in Upstate New York and the New England states, and, through Shaker missionary efforts, Shaker communities appeared in the Midwestern states. Communities of Shakers were governed by area bishoprics and within the communities individuals were grouped into \"family\" units and worked together to manage daily activities. By 1836 eighteen major, long-term societies were founded, comprising some sixty families, and many smaller, short-lived communities were established over the course of the 19th century, including two failed ventures into the Southeastern United States and an urban community in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Shakers peaked in population by the early 1850s. With the turmoil of the American Civil War and subsequent Industrial Revolution, Shakerism went into severe decline, and as the number of living Shakers diminished, Shaker villages ceased to exist. Some of their buildings and sites have become museums, and many are historic districts under the National Register of Historic Places. The only active community is Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village in Maine.\n\nThe first Shaker community was established north of Albany, and was first called \"Niskayuna\", a rendering of the Indian name for the land. Later the town they were in was officially named Watervliet. That part of the town of Watervliet is now in the town of Colonie (since 1895), and the name Watervliet is now limited to the city of Watervliet (1896). In addition, Niskayuna is now the name of a town to the northwest. This has led to some confusion, because many historical accounts refer to them as the Niskayuna Shakers, while others refer to them as Watervliet Shakers. The Watervliet Shaker Historic District is where Mother Ann Lee was buried.\n\nBy 1780, the missionary work of the Shakers had attracted many new converts. An extensive series of trips throughout New England from 1781 through 1783 brought in followers across the entire region. Converts began appearing in New Lebanon and Canaan, New York; Hancock, Pittsfield, Richmond, Ashfield, Harvard, and Shirley, Massachusetts; and the states of Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Maine (then part of Massachusetts), among other locations.\n\nIn 1784, Ann Lee and her brother both died, leaving James Whittaker to lead the faith. By 1787, he too had died, and Joseph Meacham assumed the role as leader. Meacham appointed Lucy Wright of Pittsfield to co-lead, and under their auspices they organized a central Village in New Lebanon, as well as organizing the original settlement of Watervliet. By 1790, the Hancock Village was also organized.\n\nAfter the formation of the New Lebanon, Watervliet, and Hancock communities, within three years all remaining Northeastern communities would organize in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Maine.\n\nThe Shakers built more than 20 settlements that attracted at least 20,000 converts over the next century. Strict believers in celibacy, Shakers acquired their members through conversion, indenturing children, and adoption of orphans. Some children, such as Isaac N. Youngs, came to the Shakers when their parents joined, then grew up to become faithful members as adults.\n\nAs their communities grew, women and men shared leadership of the Shaker communities. Women preached and received revelations as the Spirit fell upon them. Thriving on the religious enthusiasm of the first and second Great Awakenings, the Shakers declared their messianic, communitarian message with significant response. One early convert observed: \"The wisdom of their instructions, the purity of their doctrine, their Christ-like deportment, and the simplicity of their manners, all appeared truly apostolical.\" The Shakers represent a small but important Utopian response to the gospel. Preaching in their communities knew no boundaries of gender, social class, or education.\n\nShaker communities were grouped into bishoprics, which were governing units. A ministry resided in the bishopric's primary community. The New Lebanon Bishopric, the primary bishopric unit, was located in New York and included the Mount Lebanon Shaker Society and the Watervliet Shaker Villages.\n\nA Shaker village was divided into groups or \"families.\" The leading group in each village was the Church Family, and it was surrounded by satellite families that were often named for points on the compass rose. Each village was governed by a leadership team consisting of two men (Elders) and two women (Eldresses). Shakers lived together as brothers and sisters. Each house was divided so that men and women did most things separately. They used different staircases and doors. They sat on opposite sides of the room in worship, at meals, and in \"union meetings\" held to provide supervised socialization between the sexes. However, the daily business of a Shaker village required the brethren and sisters to interact. Though there was a division of labor between men and women, they also cooperated in carrying out many tasks, such as harvesting apples, food production, laundry, and gathering firewood.\n\nEvery family was designed to be self-supporting with its own farm and businesses, but in times of hardship, other Shaker villages pitched in to help the afflicted.\n\nIn addition to the organized communities, other, small \"out-families\" and very short-lived communities emerged during the history of the Shakers. These included:\n\nIn the 19th century, hundreds of tourists visited Shaker villages, and many of them later wrote about their experiences there. Outsiders were invariably impressed by Shaker cleanliness, prosperity, and agriculture. Shaker food was delicious, and they were hospitable to outsiders. Shakers had a reputation for honesty and their products were the best of their kind.\n\n\n\n"}

The buildings had gabled roofs, raised floors, plank walls, and were thatched with reed or covered with hinoki cypress bark. Such early shrines did not include a space for worship. Three important forms of ancient shrine architectural styles exist: \"taisha-zukuri\", \"shinmei-zukuri\" and \"sumiyoshi-zukuri\" They are exemplified by Izumo Taisha, Nishina Shinmei Shrine and Sumiyoshi Taisha respectively and date to before 552. According to the tradition of \", the buildings or shrines were faithfully rebuilt at regular intervals adhering to the original design. In this manner, ancient styles have been replicated through the centuries to the present day.\n\nThis style is characterized by an extreme simplicity. Its basic features can be seen in Japanese architecture from the Kofun period (250–538 C.E.) onwards and it is considered the pinnacle of Japanese traditional architecture. Built in plane-unfinished wood, the \"honden\" is either 3x2 \"ken\" or 1x1\"ken\" in size, has a raised floor, a gabled roof with an entry on one the non-gabled sides (), no upward curve at the eaves, and purely decorative logs called \"chigi\" (vertical) and \"katsuogi\" (horizontal) protruding from the roof's ridge. \n\nBecause shrines used to be rebuilt every 20 years, as Ise Shrine still is, shrines of this type are mostly of recent construction. The oldest extant example is Nishina Shinmei Shrine, which gives the name to the style.\n\n"}

Its doctrines are marked by the influence of two great philosophical areas, the Peripateticism and Sufism, which makes it a very interesting writing for researchers and scholars. This work contains the answer given by him to some philosophical questions raised by the famous Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen (1215 -1250) and has been defined as \"symbol on the intellectual relations between medieval Christian Europe and the Islamic world\". \nOn the \"Sicilian Questions\" exist, so far, the complete editions of Serefettin Yaltkaya, according to the 534th Arabic manuscript from the Bodleian Library at Oxford; and several complete translations: to Turkish, to Italian, and to Spanish; as well as diverse partial translations: to French, to Italian, to Spanish, and to German.\n\nRegarding the author's style, the book has obvious signs of eloquence and elegance, as well as extensive scientific knowledge. But at the same time, it warns, sometimes, a certain monotony, excessive rhetoric, with consequent abrupt interruptions retakes, disjunctions, etc. Through its pages the text shows a peculiar mix of Aristotelian influence and Neoplatonic Sufi mysticism, and an overview of the most important doctrines of the science of antiquity, including for instace, the logic of Aristotle.\n\nThe treatise is divided into a prologue, wrote perhaps one of his disciples, which explains the origin of the correspondence, the answer to the four philosophical questions raised by Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, a Appendix referred to several issues, and finally, an epilogue. These parts are of variable length and are subdivided, in turn, into several sections. Given, then, that its structure is as follows:\n\n\nAs usual in medieval Arabic treatises, and how could it be otherwise, if we take into account the rich and highly educated of Ibn Sab'in, in the \"Sicilian Questions\" the author quotes from other writers, especially those in the classical antiquity; among them are, for example, Plato's \"Phaedrus\" and especially those belonging to the logic of Aristotle, as the most relevant. Similarly, and for the same reason, it makes frequent references to ancient philosophers and thinkers to a greater extent, but also to his fellow followers of other faiths and representatives of the most varied theories and doctrines, explained or simply commented on the work, which make it a rich melting pot of scientific knowledge to justify the time and interest in it. Among all these philosophers, he notes, the volume of citations is made on his thought and his writings, Aristotle, which is really central to the treaty and the Andalusian mystic most often named as the Wise (\"al-Hakim\") and the Man (\"al-Rayul\").\n\nOther important philosophers and thinkers in the \"Sicilian Questions\" referred to are, in alphabetical order, Alexander of Aphrodisias, Anaxagoras, Berossus, Crates, Diogenes, Euclid, al-Farabi, Galen, al-Ghazali, al-Hallaj, Ibn Bajja (Avempace), Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Iamblichus, Parmenides, Pythagoras, Plato, Socrates, Themistius, Theophrastus and Zeno of Elea.\n\nThe masterful character of the work lies at the confluence of all these philosophical currents which combine great diversity of theories and beliefs.\n\n"}

It was painted during the late Tang dynasty and the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, and is probably associated with the Zoroastrian cult of the Sogdian people. The historian , who is a member of the Academia Sinica of Taiwan, recognised this \"paper image\" as one of the \"pieces of paper depicting Mazdean deities for the celebration\". The drawing is preserved in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris.\n\nThis sketch, painted on paper in black ink with light colouring, depicts two ladies sitting opposite each another, their heads being encircled by nimbi. Both are represented holding various attributes: the lady on the left, who sits on a rectangular throne supported by a row of lotus petals, holds a foliated cup and a tray with a dog seated on it. The one on the right is seated on a dog or wolf, and has four arms, the upper two supporting the sun and moon discs, the lower two arms holding a scorpion and a snake. They wear a characteristic hairstyle, surmounted by a water-drop-shaped or peach-shaped headdresses that are probably made of metal.\n\nThe drawing had been published in Jao Tsung-I's \"The Line Drawing of Dunhuang\" in 1978, but has only attracted the interest of researchers since it was displayed in the Sérinde exhibition in 1995.\n\nThe peach-shaped headdress resembles the hairstyle of the Uyghur princess.

The method involved the drawing of lots (\"sortes\") to obtain knowledge of future events: in many of the ancient Italian temples the will of the gods was consulted in this way, as at Praeneste and Caere.\n\nThese \"sortes\" or lots were usually little tablets or counters, made of wood or other materials, and were commonly thrown into a sitella or urn, filled with water. The lots were sometimes thrown like dice. The name of \"sortes\" was in fact given to anything used to determine chances, and was also applied to any verbal response of an oracle.\n\nVarious things were written upon the lots according to circumstances, as for instance the names of the persons using them. It seems to have been a favorite practice in later times to write the verses of illustrious poets upon little tablets, and to draw them out of the urn like other lots, the verses which a person thus obtained being supposed to be applicable to him (see \"Sortes Homerica\" and \"Sortes Virgilianae\", lots created from verses of Homer and Virgil).\n\nIn the Biblical account of the prophet Jonah, he is thrown into the sea and swallowed by the fish after the sailors on the ship cast lots to determine the guilty one who had brought about the storm. It was also the practice to consult the poets in the same way as Muslims do the Koran and Hafiz, and many Christians the Bible, namely, by opening the book at random and applying the first passage that struck the eye to a person's own immediate circumstances. This practice was very common among the early Christians, who substituted the Bible and the Psalter for Homer and Virgil. Many church councils repeatedly condemned these \"Sortes Sanctorum\" (sacred lots), as they were called.\n\nThe Sibylline books were probably also consulted in this way. Those who foretold future events by lots were called \"Sortilegi\".\n\nThe \"sortes convivales\" were sealed tablets, which were sold at entertainments, and upon being opened or unsealed entitled the purchaser to things of very unequal value. They were therefore a kind of lottery.\n\n"}

According to Jennifer Taylor, a historian at Sydney University, it is among Sydney's four most significant religious buildings constructed in the twentieth century. It was the world's fourth Bahá'í House of Worship to be constructed, completed in 1961. Shoghi Effendi, head of the Bahá'í Faith when the House of Worship was designed, called it the \"Mother Temple of the whole Pacific area\" and the \"Mother Temple of the Antipodes.\" Every year, over 20,000 domestic and foreign visitors frequent the House of Worship.\n\nIn the early 1950s, the Bahá'ís of Australia began work to purchase a property for a House of Worship. When the persecution of Bahá'ís intensified in Iran in 1955, Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, suspended plans for a House of Worship in Tehran and commissioned two others in its place, one in Kampala, Uganda, and the other in Sydney. The property for the temple was acquired in 1956. An initial design by Charles Mason Remey was given to Sydney architect John Brogan to develop and complete, and construction began in April 1957. On 22 March 1958, a foundation ceremony was held which was attended by Clara Dunn, a Hand of the Cause appointed by Shoghi Effendi who first brought the Bahá'í Faith to Australia in 1920 along with her husband John Hyde Dunn.\n\nThe temple was dedicated on 16 and 17 September 1961 by Shoghi Effendi's widow Rúhíyyih Khánum (Mary Maxwell), and international dignitaries then attended a reception hosted by the mayor of Sydney. At this time, the structure's technical features received treatment in engineering and construction journals including \"Plywood and Products\" and \"Construction\", while general coverage appeared in \"The Daily Telegraph\", \"The Daily Mirror\", \"The Sydney Morning Herald\", and \"The Australian Post\", among other Australian news outlets. Internationally, the temple was mentioned briefly in sources including \"The Economist\" and \"Time\". The total cost of the four-year construction was £175,000.\n\nIn the summer of 1993–1994 and again in 2005–2006, the temple was threatened by nearby bush fires which approached but never reached the temple grounds. In 2011, a week of events was held to mark the temple's fiftieth anniversary, including an interfaith prayer service, a reception attended by dignitaries such as the Premier of New South Wales, and an exhibition featuring children's art on creating a more peaceful world.\n\nOn the ground floor of the temple is a main auditorium with seating for six hundred people, encircled by a gallery. From there, nine doors open onto the grounds at equal angles, as in all Bahá'í Houses of Worship, signifying the unity of the world's religions. The second level features windows of Palladian style that illuminate the building's interior. A ribbed dome rises above them, spanning 20 metres horizontally and reaching 38 metres above ground level at its highest point. There is a lantern perched on top of the dome, which was placed there by a helicopter during the construction. Construction materials include crushed quartz, local hardwoods in the interior, and concrete and marble in the dome.\n\nThe temple is a highly visible landmark as it occupies the highest point above Sydney's Northern Beaches region, overlooking the Pacific coast at Mona Vale. It is on Mona Vale Road, set in an area of natural bushland included in an Indigenous Protected Area. The surrounding gardens contain a variety of native Australian flora including waratahs, three species of eucalypts, caleyi and other grevillea, acacia, and woody pear. Other amenities located on the site include a visitors' centre, a bookshop, a picnic area, and the administrative offices of the Australian Bahá'í community. When the number of Australian Bahá'ís becomes sufficient to sustain them, humanitarian centres for education, welfare, and other purposes will be established around the temple.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith teaches that a Bahá'í House of Worship should be a space for people of all religions to gather, reflect, and worship. As is the case with all Bahá'í Houses of Worship, anyone may enter the Sydney temple irrespective of religious background, sex, or other distinctions. The sacred writings of not only the Bahá'í Faith but also other religions can be read and/or chanted, regardless of language; on the other hand, reading non-scriptural texts is forbidden, as are delivering sermons or lectures and fundraising. Musical renditions of readings and prayers can be sung by choirs but no musical instruments can be played inside. There is no set pattern for worship services, and ritualistic ceremonies are not permitted.\n\nOn Sundays and on Bahá'í Holy Days, public prayer services are held with readings from the sacred texts of various religions and a cappella music sung by the temple choir.\n\n\n"}

The tabloid 12 page format launched in 2003 failed due to the massive overheads of printing and distributing community based paper, it was decided to take advantage of the latest developments in e-publishing and re-launch the paper as an electronic web based publication.\n\nThe Crescent newspaper is an independent community based publication and encourages and promotes independent editorial comment and news content. It draws on communal journalistic resources in a broader sense if the definition from across the British Isles and Eire, but is not confined by the perceived definition of Community Journalism.\n\nIt is a young English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh Muslim publication, regardless of ethnic origin to provide a different media narrative for a global English speaking readership.\n\n1893 to 1908\n\"The Crescent - a weekly record of Islam in England\" was originally published weekly in Liverpool from 1893. As such, it can claim to be oldest and first regular publication reflecting and serving the early convert and Muslim community within the British Isles, although its readership quickly grew via subscription to a global community. The first edition was published on 14 January 1893 from 32 Elizabeth Street, Liverpool, shortly before moving to Brougham Terrace. It was edited by W.H. Abdullah Quilliam and represented Muslims in England and growing convert community between 1893 and 1908.\n\nA statement in \"The Crescent\" to its advertisers declared that “\"in addition to the thousands of copies in circulation within the British Isles, in addition to which thousands of copies of the Paper are sent regularly abroad to subscribers in France, Spain, Switzerland, Constantinople, Smyrna, Syria, Turkey in Asia, Russia, Morocco, Tunis, Algeria, Malta, Egypt, Persia, Beluchistan, Ceylon, Arabia, the Cape Colony, the Transvaal, Zanzibar, Lagos, Gambia, Sierra Leone, the west Coast of Africa, Afghanistan, Penang, Singapore, China, British Guiana, Trinidad, Canada, the United States of America, and many parts of India, this forming a capital advertising medium\"”. The advertising rate was stated as being 2s. 6d. per inch per insertion.\n\nAfter outgrowing the Muslim prayer hall established by Quilliam in Mount Vernon, Liverpool, in 1888 he rented 8 Brougham Terrace and also acquired the neighbouring properties, numbers 10 and 12 in 1889, and in the basement a printing press was established to produce the monthly editions of \"The Islamic World\", which was subscribed to globally. In 1893, it evolved into the weekly publication \"The Crescent - a weekly record of Islam in England\".\n\nPlans were announced for a purpose-built mosque to be built to the design of J. H. McGovern on the site of 10 and 12 Brougham Terrace, but did not materialise, any more than did those of 1902, for a mosque in the communities new centre at Geneva Road, Elm Park, Liverpool where \"The Crescent\" continued to be published until May 1908.\n\n\"The Crescent\" newspaper is a social history of a growing Muslim convert community. Such names as Yahya McQuinn, T. Omar Byrne, Fatima Cates, Yahya Nasser Parkinson, Nasrullah Warren, J. Bokhari Jeffery, and Omar Roberts appear regularly in the editorial, but the wider community would include Henry, Lord Stanley of Alderly, Hasan El-Arculli a Muslim G.P. and many others.\n\nThe Crescent Newspaper was relaunched in 1440 A.H. (September 2018) by British Muslim converts residing in UK and Eire as an on-line newspaper with the title '\"The Crescent\" newspaper'. It appears as both printed and on-line editions. It is planned to publish the paper monthly on the first Friday of each month from the first Friday of the Muslim New Year in Muharrem 1440, and move to a fortnightly publication thereafter.\n\n\n\n\"The Crescent\" newspaper's target audience at the point of conception to launching the on-line edition, was aimed at the indigenous English speaking and Convert Muslim community resident within the British Isles and Eire, but access via the Internet has opened the readership to the global English speaking world.\n\nLaunched 2018\n\n\"The Crescent\" newspaper\n\nIndependent community based\n\n\"The Crescent\" newspaper is not aligned to any political party.\n\n\n\"The Crescent\" newspaper is archived at the British Library and is complete except for 1894\n\nThe Catalogue reference is given as:\n"}

Jazz musician Chick Corea, a longtime member of the Church of Scientology, was inspired by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard's science fiction 1954 novel \"To the Stars\". Hubbard's book tells the story of an interstellar crew which experiences the effects of time dilation due to traveling at near light speed. A few days experienced by the ship's crew could amount to hundreds of years for their friends and family back on Earth.\n\nCorea was influenced in particular by a scene from Hubbard's work where one of the main characters plays the piano, and he created the album as a tone poem piece. It was the first time members of his group Chick Corea Elektric Band had gotten together since 1991. Scientology-owned Galaxy Press reissued the book at the same time as the album's release as a form of cross-marketing. Corea later produced another album, \"The Ultimate Adventure\", also inspired by and named after a work by Hubbard.\n\nThe album received mostly positive reviews. Christopher Blagg of the \"Boston Herald\" commented: \"Somewhere L. Ron Hubbard was smiling,\" and Mike Hobart of the \"Financial Times\" described the album as \"a fine programme of jazz-fusion\". It reached number eight on the U.S. Top Contemporary Jazz charts in September 2004, and garnered Corea a 2004 Grammy Award nomination for instrumental arrangement for the track \"The Long Passage\".\n\nHubbard's \"To the Stars\" depicts a future where an interstellar ship travelling at near light speed slows down time experienced for its occupants. The ship's members are affected by Albert Einstein's time dilation theory, and the Earth experiences hundreds of years while only a few days have passed for members of the ship. The crew have no family or friends on Earth due to the time that separates them. Of the album's 17 tracks, 10 are directly based on characters or concepts from the book. The protagonist of the book (scientist Alan Corday), the ship's captain (Captain Jocelyn), and the ship's name (\"Hound of Heaven\") are all titles of tracks on the album. The other seven tracks are \"Port Views\", short musical interludes between the larger pieces.\n\nCorea explains at his website how he was motivated to work on music inspired by \"To the Stars\", commenting that he was inspired by a scene from the book in which Hubbard describes the Captain of the spaceship in the story playing a melody on a piano. He had read the book eight or nine times, and after writing down musical composition based on Hubbard's work the album was created as a tone poem piece. Previous tone poem albums by Corea include \"The Leprechaun\" (1975), \"My Spanish Heart\" (1976), and \"The Mad Hatter\" (1978). The piece is Corea's first attempt at musical interpretation from one of Hubbard's works.\n\n\"The attraction to me was not only the challenge of writing music portraying characters in a fiction book but the fact that I've had such an intimate connection with L. Ron Hubbard and his work in Scientology for 40 years now. I've been a fan of his fiction for 25 years, and once I started into the act of working with his creations, it had an extra special excitement to me,\" he said in an interview with \"The Washington Post\". \"Aside from the content in his message, and the fact that he's the founder of the Church of Scientology and Dianetics, the thing I loved about Hubbard was the aesthetics of his writing. There is a musical wavelength to what he does,\" said Corea to \"The San Diego Union-Tribune\".\n\nCorea brought together the original members of Chick Corea Elektric Band for the first time since 1991, including bassist John Patitucci, drummer Dave Weckl, saxophonist Eric Marienthal and guitarist Frank Gambale. Gambale's electric guitar playing figures prominently in some of the tracks. In a statement in \"The Harvard Crimson\", Corea commented that \"To the Stars\" represented a synergy of his three greatest passions: \"My passion as a composer/performer, my passion for the Elektric Band as a perfect orchestra, and my passion for L. Ron Hubbard as the ideal artist.\" The album is his \"favorite recording\" out of his almost one hundred album discography.\n\nMike Manoogian designed the cover and book design for the 2004 hardcover edition of the novel \"To the Stars\", and the artwork is copyrighted by the L. Ron Hubbard Library. The album cover uses the same design as the novel.\n\nThe novel \"To the Stars\" was reissued by Scientology-owned Galaxy Press at the same time as the album as a form of cross-marketing. According to \"Publishers Weekly\", Corea's soundtrack to the novel was issued by Galaxy Press to give the company's \"enormous marketing muscle\" the ability to \"tap into the vast Hubbard fan base\".\n\nCorea's 2004 piece \"The Adventures of Hippocrates\" was inspired by a robotlike character named \"Hippocrates\" from Hubbard's science fiction series \"Ole Doc Methuselah\". Corea would go on to compose another album in 2006, \"The Ultimate Adventure\", also inspired by and named after a book by Hubbard, which earned him two Grammy Awards.\n\nThe album reached number eight on \"Billboard\" magazine's Top Contemporary Jazz charts in September 2004, and Corea earned a 2004 Grammy Award nomination for instrumental arrangement for the track \"The Long Passage\". The album received a rating of three stars from Allmusic, three stars from \"The Observer\", three and a half stars from \"The Star-Ledger\", and four stars from \"The Times\". In a review of the work in \"The Washington Post\", Geoffrey Himes writes that \"Corea occasionally falls into his old bad habits of jazz-rock fusion excess, substituting frenetic virtuosity for melodic content and emotional connection on tunes such as the album-opening 'Check Blast' and 'Hound of Heaven.'\" Himes highlights Corea's compositions of the seven \"Port View\" interludes, and calls \"Alan Corday\" the best piece on the album. Mike Joyce of \"The Washington Post\" also appreciated the \"flamenco-tinged ballad\" of the \"Alan Corday\" track. Christopher Blagg of the \"Boston Herald\" liked \"the dense electrified samba of the joyous 'Mistress Luck - The Party'\", and commented: \"Somewhere L. Ron Hubbard was smiling.\" Bob Young of the \"Boston Herald\" described the album as \"music that shifts continually from bright, aggressive jazz fusion to melodic tranquility and back again\". James F. Collins gave the album a positive review in \"The Harvard Crimson\", writing: \"To The Stars is a testament to his [Corea's] unflagging creativity and is a proud addition to his already expansive discography.\" Mike Hobart reviewed the album for \"Financial Times\", commenting that \"once the band had delivered its first unison riff, the music's inspirational source was irrelevant as a fine programme of jazz-fusion poured out\".\n\nIn his review of the album, Ben Ratliff of \"The New York Times\" writes: \"I did like the driving, collective muscle of the band, though, very much,\" but he also describes its aesthetics as \"cluttered and gaudy\". For PopMatters, Associate Music Editor Justin Cober-Lake writes: \"In many ways, it's a supreme accomplishment with difficult technique passages and broad soundscapes; on the other hand, it's a journey that's too long to take.\" In his review of Corea's later work \"The Ultimate Adventure\", Will Friedwald of \"The New York Sun\" writes: \"'To the Stars' was trite, electronic bubblegum music that sounded like a cheesy video-game soundtrack.\" Writing in \"The Times\", John Bungey comments that \"many of the pieces are straitjacketed into the cosmic concept\", concluding his review with: \"If you prefer hi-fi to sci-fi, then you will be hoping that Corea leaves the space helmet at home next time.\" John L. Walters gave the album a negative review in \"The Guardian\", writing that the album \"cries out for warning stickers - 'this album contains dangerously high levels of Scientology'\", and that it \"drags some perfectly fine jazz musicians ... through conceptual purgatory\".\n\nBand members\n\nAdditional personnel\n\n\n"}
