{"id": "2301634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2301634", "title": "Bible prophecy", "text": "Bible prophecy\n\nBible prophecy or biblical prophecy comprises the passages of the Bible that supposedly reflect communications from God to humans through prophets. Jews, Christians and Muslims usually consider the biblical prophets to have received revelations from God.\n\nProphetic passagesinspirations, interpretations, admonitions or predictionsappear widely distributed throughout Biblical narratives. Some future-looking prophecies in the Bible are conditional, with the conditions either implicitly assumed or explicitly stated.\n\nIn general, believers in biblical prophecy engage in exegesis and hermeneutics of scriptures which they believe contain descriptions of global politics, natural disasters, the future of the nation of Israel, the coming of a Messiah and of a Messianic Kingdom—as well as the ultimate destiny of humankind.\n\nProphets in the Hebrew Bible often warn the Israelites to repent of their sins and idolatries, with the threat of punishment or reward. Blessings and catastrophes are attributed to the deity. According to believers in Bible prophecy, many of these prophecies are viewed as having been fulfilled within later passages.\n\nIn Judaism and Christianity, a number of biblical passages have been taken as prophecies of a coming Messiah. Christians believe that these Messianic prophecies are fulfilled by Christ Jesus, while followers of Rabbinic Judaism still await the arrival of the Jewish Messiah and other signs of Jewish eschatology. Most Christians believe many messianic prophecies will be fulfilled with the Second Coming of Christ, though some Christians (Full Preterists) believe that all Messianic prophecies have already been fulfilled. Rabbinic Judaism does not separate the original coming of the Messiah and the advent of the Messianic Age. For details of the differences, see Christianity and Judaism.\n\nAnother much-discussed issue concerns the \"end times\", or \"last days\", particularly according to the Revelation of John.\n\n promises Abraham and his descendants the land of Canaan from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates, and Genesis 17:8 states:\nF. F. Bruce argues that the fulfilment of this prophecy occurred during David's reign. He writes:\nChristian apologists point to corporate personality here to connect Abraham with the Jewish nation. H. Wheeler Robinson writes:\nGod is represented as guaranteeing that the Israelites would drive out the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites from their lands, which the Israelites wanted to appropriate (). The same applies to the Girgashites (). In , this is referred to as a covenant, commandments being given. In Judges, the Israelites are described as disobeying the commandment to worship no other gods () and, as a result, not being able to drive out the Jebusites (). The Israelites did not drive all of the Canaanite tribes out in the lifetime of Joshua. The books of Joshua and Judges (Chapters 1) mention towns that could not be defeated. According to 2 Samuel, the Israelites occupied Canaan but the complete seizure took place only when David defeated the Jebusites in Jerusalem and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Israel. ()\n\nGod states that the house, throne and kingdom of David and his offspring (called \"the one who will build a house for my Name\" in the verse) will last forever (2 Samuel 7:12–16; 2 Chronicles 13:5; Psalm 89:20–37). 1 Kings 9:4–7 as well as 1 Chronicles 28:5 and 2 Chronicle 7:17 state that Solomon's establishment is conditional on Solomon obeying God's commandments.\n\nSolomon built the temple in Jerusalem (2 Chronicles 2:1; 6:7–10) and did not obey God's commandments (1 Kings 11:1–14).\n\nThe destruction of the Kingdom of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar II in 586 BC brought an end to the rule of the royal house of David.\n\nSome scholars including Saul of Cyrene state that God has promised an eternal dynasty to David unconditionally (1 Kings 11:36; 15:4; 2 Kings 8:19). They feel the conditional promise of 1 Kings 9:4–7 seems to undercut this unconditional covenant. Most interpreters have taken the expression \"throne of Israel\" as a reference to the throne of the United Monarchy. They see this as a conditionalization of the unconditional dynastic promise to David's house expressed in 1 Kings 11:36, 15:4 and 2 Kings 8:19. They argue the presence of both unconditional and conditional promises to the house of David would create intense theological dissonance in the Book of Kings.\n\nChristians believe that the promise is of surviving descendants that could fulfill the role of king rather than a permanent earthly kingship.\n\n\nI am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down. You will not escape from his grasp but will surely be captured and handed over to him. You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes, and he will speak with you face to face. And you will go to Babylon... You will not die by the sword; you will die peacefully. (Jeremiah 34:2–5)\n\nThe Books of Kings and Jeremiah relate that Zedekiah's eyes were put out after he was taken to the King of Babylon and that he remained a prisoner in Babylon until his death (2 Kings 25:6–7 and Jeremiah 52:10–11). There is no other historical record of what happened with Zedekiah in Babylon.\n\nJosiah fought against the Egyptians although the pharaoh, Necho II, prophesied that God would destroy him if he did (2 Chronicles 35:21–22)—possibly Josiah was \"opposing the faithful prophetic party\". Josiah was killed in battle against the Egyptians (2 Kings 23:29–30). However, Judah was in a time of peace when Josiah died, thus fulfilling the prophecy.\n\n\nIt will not take place, it will not happen... Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people. ()\n\nAccording to \"God delivered the King of the Jews, Ahaz, into the hands of the King of Syria, who carried away a great multitude of them captives to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the King of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter\".In the prophet says clearly that a prerequisite for the fulfillment of the prophecy is that Ahaz stands firm in his faith. This means that he should trust God and not seek military help in the Assyrians which Ahaz nevertheless did.\n\nThe Book of Isaiah also foretold;\nChristian apologists state that the prophecy in Isaiah chapters 13 and 21 could possibly have been directed originally against Assyria whose capital Nineveh was defeated in 612 BC by a combined onslaught of the Medes and Babylonians. According to this explanation the prophecy was later updated and referred to Babylon not recognizing the rising power of Persia. On the other hand, it can be mentioned that the Persian King Cyrus after overthrowing Media in 550 BC did not treat the Medes as a subject nation.\n\nInstead of treating the Medes as a beaten foe and a subject nation, he had himself installed as king of Media and governed Media and Persia as a dual monarchy, each part of which enjoyed equal rights.\nThe prophecy may date from 735 BC when Damascus and Israel were allied against Judah. Tiglath-Pileser took Damascus in 732 BC, which some apologists point to as a fulfillment of this prophecy, but this campaign never reduced the city to rubble. The depiction of Damascus as a \"heap of ruins\" has been understood as figurative language to describe the despoiling of the city, the leading of its people as captives to Kir (an unidentified city), and the way that the city lost much of its wealth and political influence in the years following Tiglath-Pileser's attack. The prophecy is also believed by some to have a future fulfilment relating to end-time developments concerning Israel.\n\nThe passage is consistent with , which states that Assyria defeated the city and exiled the civilians to Kir.\n\nSome theologians argue the statement that the \"land of Judah\" will terrify the Egyptians is not a reference to a large army from Judah attacking Egypt but a circumlocution for the place where God lives. They argue it is God and his plans that will cause Egypt to be terrified. They go on to argue the second \"in that day\" message from verse 18 announces the beginning of a deeper relationship between God and Egypt which leads to Egypt's conversion and worshiping God (verses 19–21). They say the last \"in that day\" prophecy (verses 23–25) speaks about Israel, Assyria and Egypt as God's special people, thus, describing eschatological events.\n\nThere are many scholars, however, who point out that the prophet himself spoke of Cyrus arguing that Deutero-Isaiah interpreted Cyrus' victorious entry into Babylon in 539 BC as evidence of divine commission to benefit Israel. The main argument against the idols in these chapters is that they cannot declare the future, whereas God does tell future events like the Cyrus predictions.\n\nJeremiah prophesied that;\nIt lasted 68 years (605 BC–537 BC) from the capture of the land of Israel by Babylon and the exile of a small number of hostages including Daniel, Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael (). It lasted 60 years (597–537 BC) from the deportation of the 10,000 elite () including Jehoiachin and Ezekiel though there is a discrepancy with Jeremiah's numbers of exiles (). It lasted 49 years (586–537 BC) from the exile of the majority of Judah () including Jeremiah who was taken to Egypt and leaving behind a poor remnant ().\nHowever, some Christian scholars try to explain the figure in a different way stating that Jeremiah gave a round number.\nChristian commentaries have considered the conquering Persian force an alliance between the Persians and the Medes. One suggests the use of the term \"Medes\" is due to earlier recognition among the Jews and because the generals of Cyrus were apparently Medes. \nThe destruction of temple by the Romans in 70 brought an end to the Jewish sacrificial system.(33:18) (See Korban) Christians have stated this refers to the millennium in which Christ reigns for a thousand years, since Jeremiah 33:18 goes along with the eternal reign of the line of David in verses 21–22.\n\n\n\nTyre was an island fortress-city with mainland villages along the shore. These mainland settlements were destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar II, but after a 13-year siege from 585–573 BC, the King of Tyre made peace with Nebuchadnezzar, going into exile and leaving the island city itself intact. Alexander the Great used debris from the mainland to build a causeway to the island, entered the city, and plundered the city, sacking it without mercy. Most of the residents were either killed in the battle or sold into slavery. It was quickly repopulated by colonists and escaped citizens, and later regained its independence. Tyre did eventually enter a period of decline, being reduced to a small remnant. Echoing Ezekiel's words, historian Philip Myers writes in 1889: The city never recovered from this blow. The site of the once brilliant maritime capital is now \"bare as the top of a rock,\" a place where the few fishermen that still frequent the spot spread their nets to dry. Older sources often refer to the locations as a \"fishing village\". However, the nearby area grew rapidly in the 20th century. The ruins of a part of ancient Tyre (a protected site) can still be seen on the southern half of the island whereas modern Tyre occupies the northern half and also sprawls across Alexander's causeway and onto the mainland. It is now the fourth largest city in Lebanon with a population of 14,000 people\n\n\nThis includes the claim that God will make Egypt so weak that it will never again rule over other nations. Pharaoh Amasis II (who drove off Nebuchadnezzar) also conquered Cyprus, ruling it until 545 BC. Despite being a powerful nation in ancient times, Egypt has since been ruled by the Persians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantine Empire, Ottomans, British and the French, and has also enjoyed periods of independence from external rule. During the Hellenistic period, the break-up of the empire of Alexander the Great left the Ptolemaic Dynasty (of Macedonian/Greek origin) as rulers of Egypt: the Ptolemies then conquered and ruled Cyrenaica (now northeastern Libya), Palestine, and Cyprus at various times. (see also History of Ptolemaic Egypt and Ptolemaic kingdom).\n\nThere is some uncertainty among modern scholars regarding when (and by whom) various portions of the Book of Ezekiel were written, making the timing of prophecies difficult to unravel (see Book of Ezekiel).\n\nNebuchadnezzar invaded Egypt around 568 BC. However, the armies of Pharaoh Amasis II defeated the Babylonians (though the author did not elaborate and there are no known detailed accounts of this invasion). Herodotus reports that this Pharaoh had a long and prosperous reign. The Egyptians were conquered by the Persians in 525 BC.\n\n\n\n\"When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. I tell you the truth, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.\" (Matthew 10:23)\n\nThe Christian response is varied:\n\nMoffatt puts it \"before the Son of man arrives\" as if Jesus referred to this special tour of Galilee. Jesus could overtake them. Possibly so, but it is by no means clear. Some refer it to the Transfiguration, others to the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, others to the Second Coming. Some hold that Matthew has put the saying in the wrong context. Others bluntly say that Jesus was mistaken, a very serious charge to make in his instructions to these preachers. The use of ἑως [heōs] with aorist subjunctive for a future event is a good Greek idiom.\n\nPreterist scholars explain this verse as referring to the destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 AD with the phrase \"before the Son of Man comes\" meaning before judgment comes upon the nation of Israel and the city of Jerusalem for rejecting Jesus Christ as The Messiah. They reject to refer Matthew 10:23 to the second coming of Jesus because Jesus speaks to his disciples about the towns of Israel:\n\nSuch a view completely divorces the passage from its immediate and localized context, such as the fact that this was an admonition to the apostles – and not directed to a generation several millennia removed from the first century.\n\nThe Wycliffe Bible Commentary disagrees with this view:\n\nIn the similar context of Mt 24:8–31 the great tribulation and the second advent are in view. Hence, the \"coming of the Son of man\" is probably eschatological here also. This would have been more readily understood by the disciples, who would hardly have thought to equate this \"coming\" with the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70.\n\"as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\" (See also Matthew 16:21, 20:19, Mark 8:31, 9:31, 10:34, Luke 11:29–30 and John 2:19) According to Mark 15:42–46, Jesus was buried in Friday night and according to Matthew 28:1–6 and John 20:1, Jesus' tomb was found empty on Sunday dawn.\nIt is customary for eastern nations to count part of a day as a whole 24-hour day.\n\n\nFor the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what he has done. I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\n\nChristian responses have been varied:\n\nSome of them that stand here (τινες των ὁδε ἑστωτων [tines tōn hode hestōtōn]). A \"crux interpretum\" in reality. Does Jesus refer to the transfiguration, the resurrection of Jesus, the great day of Pentecost, the destruction of Jerusalem, the second coming and judgment? We do not know, only that Jesus was certain of his final victory which would be typified and symbolized in various ways.\n\nPreterists respond that Jesus did not mean His second coming but a demonstration of His might when He says \"coming in his kingdom\". In this view, this was accomplished by the destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 AD when some of the Apostles were still living and thus fulfilling the word of Jesus that only some will not have died.\nOthers argue it refers to the Transfiguration. The Wycliffe Bible Commentary states:\n\nThis coming of the Son of Man in his kingdom is explained by some as the destruction of Jerusalem and by others as the beginning of the Church. But referring it to the Transfiguration meets the requirements of the context (all Synoptists follow this statement with the Transfiguration, Mk 9:1; Lk 9:27). Furthermore, Peter, who was one of those standing here, referred to the Transfiguration in the same words (II Pet 1:16–18). Chafer calls the Transfiguration a \"preview of the coming kingdom on earth\" (L. S. Chafer, Systematic Theology, V, 85).\n\nHereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.\n\nThe word \"you will see\" is in Greek \"ὄψεσθε\" [opheste, from the infinitive optomai] which is plural. Jesus meant that the Jews, and not just the high priest, will see his coming.\n\n\nChristians argue that the first cock-crow is simply missing from Matthew, Luke, and John. In Matthew (), Luke (), and John (), Jesus foretells three denials of Peter before cock-crow. , , report the fulfillment of this prophecy. In , Jesus speaks of two cock-crows, which is mentioned in as having taken place. Christians argue that Matthew, Luke, and John removed the first cock-crow and diminished (Luke even eliminated) the partial exit by Peter after the first denial (which Mark reports). If Mark was the \"interpreter of Peter\", he would have gotten his information directly and thus would be considered the more reliable source.\n\n\nJesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings. \"Do you see all these things?\" he asked. \"I tell you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.\"\n\nPreterists claim these verses are metaphorical. Others claim that the destruction of the temple in A.D. 70 fulfilled this despite the existence of the wailing wall. The IVP Bible Background Commentary states:\n\nSome stones were left on others (e.g., part of one wall still stands), but this fact does not weaken the force of the hyperbole: the temple was almost entirely demolished in A.D. 70.\n\nThe parts of the wall Jesus refers to in the verse may not have included the wailing wall. Recent archaeological evidence suggest that the wailing wall part of the temple complex was not completed until an uncertain date in or after 16 A.D.\n\nNation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains.\n\nThe famines part of this verse has often been associated with the third seal of Revelation (Rev. 6:5–6), and the pestilences and earthquakes aspect has often been associated with the fourth seal of Revelation (Rev. 6:7–8). The presence of the term birthpains could be representative of better times ahead. Scholars point out that these events have always been on earth, so the verse must refer to a significant increase in the intensity of them.\n\nThere are also instances of erroneous, or untraceable, quotations from the prophets cited by the early Christians:\n\nChristian writers have given several responses. First is that the use of Jeremiah is meant to refer to all the books of prophecy. Second is that although Jeremiah said this, any record has not survived. Third is this was the result of a scribal error because of the single letter difference in the abridged versions of the names.\n\n\nChristians have given several responses. First is that this prophecy has not survived to the present day. Second is the Greek word \"nazaret\" does not mean Nazarene but is related to the Hebrew word \"netzer\" which can be translated as 'branch'. Third is that the verse is not a prophetic saying but simply reflects an Old Testament requirement for the Messiah to be held in contempt, (Psalm 22:6–8; 69:9–11, 19–21; Isaiah 53:2–4, 7–9) which they argue Nazarenes were (John 1:46; John 7:52).\n\nSome scholars respond that this is because the Malachi reference was just an introduction, which made it significantly less important than Isaiah 40:3, leading to the whole being attributed to the prophet Isaiah. Other reasons given are Isaiah's authority was considered higher than Malachi and the Isaiah text was better known.\n\n\n...we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left till the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. (1 Thessalonians 4:15–17)\n\nChristians argue that Paul speaks about his own presence at the last day only hypothetically. They point out Paul later states the Day of the Lord comes like a thief () which is a word Jesus uses himself () expressing the impossibility of predicting His second coming ().\nThere are different attempts to explain the term \"to take his seat in the temple of God\". Some understand it as a divine attribute which the man of lawlessness arrogates to himself and hence no conclusion can be drawn for time and place. Many in the early Church, such as Irenaeus, Hippolytus of Rome, Origen and Cyril of Jerusalem, believed a literal Temple would be rebuilt by the Antichrist before the Lord's Second Coming whereas Jerome and John Chrysostom referred the Temple to the Church. Also some today's scholars refer the phrase \"God's temple\" to the Church pointing out that Paul used this term five other times outside 2 Thessalonians and does not refer it to a literal temple.\nThe Church fathers such as John Chrysostom who lived at the time of Gnostics, the Marcionites, the Encratites, the Manicheans—who rejected Christian marriage and the eating of because they believed that all flesh was from an evil principle—asserted this text referred to such sects and that they were therefore \"in the latter times\". The Protestant theologian John Gill believed that this refers to the Canon Law of the Catholic Church, particularly priestly celibacy and Lent as promulgated by the medieval church. (see Great Apostasy)\nSome Christian scholars believe the verses 11–14 refer to the era of salvation beginning with Christ's resurrection and its coming fulfillment on the last day. Thus, they think that the claim Paul makes here about salvation is a claim every Christian and not only Paul in his time can affirm. Some see this verse as indicating that there are no prophesied or salvation events before the Lord comes. Those holding the belief that Paul has a longer time span in view point to its context after Romans 11, which describes the repentance of all of Israel in future. They also point to Paul's plan to visit Rome and more western places in Romans 15 as indicating that he did not believe Christ's return would be soon enough to simply wait for it.\n\n\nThe word \"soon\" (other translations use \"shortly\" or \"quickly\") does not have to be understood in the sense of close future. The Norwegian scholar Thorleif Boman explained that the Israelites, unlike Europeans or people in the West, did not understand time as something measurable or calculable according to Hebrew thinking but as something qualitative:\n\nWe have examined the ideas underlying the expression of calculable time and more than once have found that the Israelites understood time as something qualitative, because for them time is determined by its content.\" \n...the Semitic concept of time is closely coincident with that of its content without which time would be quite impossible. The quantity of duration completely recedes behind the characteristic feature that enters with time or advances in it. Johannes Pedersen comes to the same conclusion when he distinguishes sharply between the Semitic understanding of time and ours. According to him, time is for us an abstraction since we distinguish time from the events that occur in time. The ancient Semites did not do this; for them time is determined by its content.\n\nThe following are the scriptural requirements in Judaism concerning the Messiah, his actions, and his reign. Jewish sources insist that the Messiah will fulfill the prophecies outright. Some Christians maintain that some of these prophecies are associated with a putative second coming while Jewish scholars state there is no concept of a second coming in the Hebrew Bible.\n\n\nWhile Christian biblical scholars have cited the following as prophecies referencing the life, status, and legacy of Jesus, Jewish scholars maintain that these passages are not messianic prophecies and are based on mistranslations/misunderstanding of the Hebrew texts.\nThe gospels of Mark, Luke, and John state Jesus sent his disciples after only one animal. (Mark 11:1–7, Luke 19:30–35, John 12: 14,15) Critics claim this is a contradiction with some mocking the idea of Jesus riding two animals at the same time. A response is that the text allows for Jesus to have ridden on a colt that was accompanied by a donkey, perhaps its mother.\n\nRashi, a 10th century French rabbi, gave the following commentaries regarding Bible prophecies:\n\nThese passages have been interpreted by some Muslim scholars as prophetic references to Muhammad. This claim has always been unacceptable to most Bible scholars. All the following are Muslim scholars' interpretations of various Biblical passages.\n\nBahá'ís believe that Bahá'u'lláh is the return of Christ \"in the glory of the Father\" and that the passages below were fulfilled by the coming of the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh, the two most recent Manifestations of God, in 1844 AD and 1863 AD, respectively.\n\n\nMormons believe that the following biblical passages prophesy or otherwise support the provenance of the Book of Mormon:\n\n\nBiblical prophecy is believed to be literally true by a number of conservative Christians, such as Norman Geisler and Young Earth Creationists. Interpreters uphold this principle by providing details of prophecies that have been fulfilled. Interpreters also dispute the legitimacy of non-biblical prophets and psychics. Professor Peter Stoner and Dr. Hawley O. Taylor, for example, believed the Bible prophecies were too remarkable and detailed to occur by chance. Arthur C. Custance maintained that the Ezekiel Tyre prophecy (Ezek. 26: 1–11; 29:17–20) was remarkable.\n\nThese interpretive issues are related to the more general idea of how passages should be read or interpreted—a concept known as Biblical hermeneutics. Bible prophecy is an area which is often discussed in regard to Christian apologetics. Traditional Jewish readings of the Bible do not generally reflect the same attention to the details of prophecies. Maimonides stated that Moses was the greatest of the prophets and only he experienced direct revelation. Concern with Moses' revelation involves law and ethical teaching more than predictive prophecy. According to Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed the prophets used metaphors and analogies and, except for Moses, their words are not to be taken literally.\n\nAccording to the Talmud, prophecy ceased in Israel following the rebuilding of the second temple. Nonetheless Maimonides held that a prophet can be identified if his or her predictions come true.\n\nMany scholarly and popular interpreters have argued that a prophecy may have a dual fulfillment; others have argued for the possibility of multiple fulfillments. In some senses this has been occasionally referred to as an apotelesmatic interpretation of specific prophecies.\n\nIn Christian eschatology, the idea of at least a dual fulfillment is usually applied to passages in the apocalyptic books of Daniel or Revelation, and to the apocalyptic discourse of Jesus in the synoptic gospels (Matthew 24, Mark 13, Luke 21), especially in interpretations that predict a future tribulation and a future Antichrist figure. Futurists and Historicists usually hold to variations of this view, while Preterists see the same passages as applying only to events and persecutions from the time of Daniel through the first century CE. Some who believe in multiple fulfillment tend to restrict the idea to a view of history where ancient events reflecting Israel and first-century Judaism and Christianity are predictors of larger future events to happen on a global scale at a point in time, while others tend to include symbolic applications of prophecies to multiple entities and events throughout history.\n\nHenry Kett suggested multiple fulfillments in his 1799 book \"History the Interpreter of Prophecy\", in which he outlined numerous fulfillments for Antichrist prophecies, with chapters on the \"Papal power\", \"Mahometanism\" and \"Infidelity\" as parts of a long series of fulfillments of the prophecies.\n\nSamuel Horsley (1733-1806) stated \"The application of the prophecy to any one of these events bears all the characteristics of a true interpretation\".\n\nMoses Stuart (1780–1852) differentiated the idea that a prophetic passage has an inherent dual sense or double meaning from the idea of a later application of the prophecy in subsequent events, separate from the original prophecy: \"In these principles there is no double sense; no ὑπόνοια \"[huponoia or \"suspicion\"]\", in the sense in which that word is usually employed and understood. But there may be an apotelesmatic view or sense of a passage in the ancient Scriptures; and this is the case whenever a proceeding or a principle is reillustrated or reconfirmed. This makes out no double sense, but a fuller and more complete exhibition of the one and simple meaning of the original. Well may it be named a πλήρωσις \"[plerosis or \"fulfillment / fulfilling\"]\".\" Stuart noted prior usage of the term \"apotelesmatic\" by European interpreters.\n\nOther interpreters have referred to an apotelesmatic meaning of prophecy as a collapsing of perspective of \"near\" and \"far\" or \"inaugurated\" and \"consummated\" fulfillments, where from the viewpoint of the ancient Israelite prophet local events affecting Israel are merged with end-time cosmic events relating to the kingdom of God.\n\nC. F. Keil (1807–1888) suggested in an influential commentary \"this uniting together of the two events is not to be explained only from the perspective and apotelesmatic character of the prophecy, but has its foundation in the very nature of the thing itself. The prophetic perspective, by virtue of which the inward eye of the seer beholds only the elevated summits of historical events as they unfold themselves, and not the valleys of the common incidents of history which lie between these heights, is indeed peculiar to prophecy in general, and accounts for the circumstance that the prophecies as a rule give no fixed dates, and apotelesmatically bind together the points of history which open the way to the end, with the end itself.\"\n\nSeventh-day Adventist theologian Desmond Ford (Historicist) termed this belief the apotelesmatic principle and stated \"The ultimate fulfillment is the most comprehensive in scope, though details of the original forecast may be limited to the first fulfillment.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Dispensational Futurist theologian Randall Price applies the term \"apotelesmatic\" primarily to the sense of \"prophetic postponement\" or \"an interruption in fulfillment\" that dispensationalists hold occurs between the sixty-ninth and seventieth weeks of the seventy weeks prophecy of Daniel 9:24–27: \"The technical expression for this delay in the fulfillment of the messianic program for Israel is derived from the Greek verb \"apotelo\" meaning, 'to bring to completion, finish.' The usual sense of \"telos\" as 'end' or 'goal' may here have the more technical idea of 'the consummation that comes to prophecies when they are fulfilled' (Luke 22:37). With the prefix \"apo\", which basically has the connotation of 'separation from something,' the idea is of a delay or interruption in the completion of the prophetic program. Therefore, \"apotelesmatic\" interpretation recognizes that in Old Testament texts that present the messianic program as a single event, a near and far historical fulfillment is intended, separated by an indeterminate period of time. Dispensational writers have referred to this as an 'intercalation' or a 'gap.' However, prophetic postponement better expresses this concept.\"\n\n\"Halley's Bible Handbook\", the \"Scofield Reference Bible\" and many other Bible commentaries hold that the \"little horn\" of Daniel 8 is fulfilled both with Antiochus Epiphanes (reigned 175-164 BC) and with a future Antichrist. Henry Kett, taking the writings of Sir Isaac Newton, advanced to identifying three fulfillments: Antiochus Epiphanes, the Romans, and a future Antichrist. Several Historicist interpreters (Faber, Bickersteth, Keith, Elliott, etc.) proposed the same, but noted that the Roman Empire is classified in two forms, the Pagan and the Papal, and that the Roman Empire was also split (East and West), and that in the East Mohammed or his religion were also meant, and more particularly the Turks, and that the final form (particularly according to authors writing after the Crimean War of 1853-1856) was Russia.\n\nMethodist theologian Adam Clarke (ca 1761-1832) concurred with Anglican bishop Thomas Newton (1704-1782) that the abomination of desolation as a proverbial phrase could include multiple events “substituted in the place of, or set up in opposition to, the ordinances of God, his worship, his truth, etc.” This allows for viewing some, or all of the following events as partial fulfillments of this prophecy simultaneously:\n\n\nThe British Israelist Howard Rand (1963) wrote, “because men have been able to see one—and only one—fulfillment, they have missed the greater scope of this prophecy and their understanding of the full message has been thwarted. ... Too, because of the double, triple and quadruple applications of this prophecy to world events, an enormous amount of history is involved in the cryptogrammic language of the vision.”\n\nAmong most Christian denominations, the prophecy that Jesus will return to Earth is a major doctrine, which can be seen by its inclusion in the Nicene Creed. Many specific timeframes for this prediction have been declared by individuals and groups, although many of these dates have expired without the occurrences predicted. An official statement of the Vatican, issued in 1993, asserted, \"we are already in the last hour\".\n\nBiblical references claimed to prophesy the end times include:\n\n\n"}

Dr B R Ambedkar, who later chaired the drafting Committee of Indian Constitution, in a speech in February, 1938 explained the word to mean \"negation of the spirit of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity\". He also clarified that the word does not mean the power, privileges and interests of Brahmins as a community. The term \"Brahmanism\" refers to the \"historical Vedic religion\", and formed one of the constituents of the complex of Indian religions called Hinduism. It is derived basically from the quest for Brahma,or Brahman or the Supreme Creator, as per ancient Indian thought. The spirit of this line of thought can be seen from the book titled \"Man's eternal quest for God\" by Paramahansa Yogananda, Publisher: Yogoda Satsanga Society of India; Third edition (19 August 2003). The Srauta tradition still preserves elements of Brahminism. Thus, there are two distinct contexts by which the term 'Brahminism' or 'Brahmanism' is used. One is in the context of ancient Indian thought and the quest for God. The other is in the context of an ongoing work for bringing in a social order based on liberty,equality and fraternity. In neither of these contexts does the word mean anything particularly significant about the Brahmin caste.\n\n"}
{"id": "2331004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331004", "title": "Cannabis and religion", "text": "Cannabis and religion\n\nDifferent religions have varying stances on the use of cannabis, historically and presently. In ancient history some religions used cannabis as an entheogenic, particularly in the Indian subcontinent where the tradition continues on a more limited basis.\n\nIn the modern era, religions with prohibitions against intoxicants, such as Islam, Buddhism, Bahai, Latter-day Saints (Mormons), and others have opposed the use of cannabis by members, or in some cases opposed the liberalization of cannabis laws. Other groups, such as some Protestant and Jewish factions, have supported the use of medicinal cannabis.\n\nIn the Bahá'í Faith, use of alcohol and other drugs for intoxication, as opposed to medical prescription, is prohibited, see Bahá'í laws. But Bahá'í practice is such laws should be applied with \"tact and wisdom\". The use of tobacco is an individual decision, it is yet strongly frowned on and not explicitly forbidden. Bahá'í authorities have spoken against intoxicant drugs since the earliest stages of the religion, with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writing:\n\nIn Buddhism, the Fifth Precept is frequently interpreted to mean \"refrain from intoxicating drinks and drugs which lead to heedlessness\", although in some direct translations, the Fifth Precept refers specifically to alcohol. Cannabis and some other psychoactive plants are specifically prescribed in the Mahākāla Tantra for medicinal purposes.\n\nPrior to assuming his position as leader of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis had spoken against recreational cannabis. He stated in 2013 in Buenos Aires: \"A reduction in the spread and influence of drug addiction will not be achieved by a liberalization of drug use.\" The catechism of the Catholic Church states that \"The use of drugs inflicts very grave damage on health and life. Their use, except on strictly therapeutic grounds, is a grave offense.\"\n\nIn The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, there is general prohibition against intoxicating substances. In August 1915, the LDS Church banned the use of cannabis by its members. In 2016, the church's First Presidency urged members to oppose legalization of recreational cannabis use. The LDS Church says it has \"raised no objection to SB 89\" (non-psychoactive medical marijuana in Utah).\n\nThe Georgian Orthodox Church has resisted legalization of cannabis in that country.\n\nThe Arkansas Baptist State Convention voted to discourage medical marijuana in 2016. In 2016, the executive director of the Florida Baptist Convention, Tommy Green, also said that congregations should be encouraged to vote against expanded legalization of medical marijuana in Florida. The \nNational Evangelical Association of Belize opposed the 2017 decriminalization of cannabis in Belize.\n\nThe Assemblies of God USA, as well as other Pentecostal and holiness churches, have historically advocated abstinence from all alcohol, tobacco, and narcotics. Supporters of this view generally cite biblical passages enjoining respect for one's body as well as forbidding intoxication.\n\nOther Protestant churches have endorsed the legality of medical marijuana, including the Presbyterian Church (USA), United Methodist Church, United Church of Christ, and the Episcopal Church.\n\nDuring the Hindu festival of Holi, people consume \"bhang\" which contains cannabis flowers. According to one description, when the \"amrita\" (elixir of life) was produced from the churning of the ocean by the devas and the asuras, Shiva created cannabis from his own body to purify the elixir (whence, for cannabis, the epithet \"angaja\" or \"body-born\"). Another account suggests that the cannabis plant sprang up when a drop of the elixir dropped on the ground. Thus, cannabis is used by sages due to association with elixir and Shiva. \nIn Hinduism, wise drinking of \"bhang\" (which contains cannabis), according to religious rites, is believed to cleanse sins, unite one with Shiva and avoid the miseries of hell in the future life. It is also believed to have medicinal benefits. In contrast, foolish drinking of \"bhang\" without rites is considered a sin.\n\nThe Quran does not directly forbid cannabis; however, cannabis is deemed to be \"khamr\" (an intoxicant) by many religious scholars and therefore generally believed to be \"haraam\" (forbidden). A hadith by the prophet Mohammed states: \"If much intoxicates, then even a little is haraam.\" Despite these prohibitions, cannabis is consumed in many parts of the Islamic world, even sometimes in a religious context particularly within the Sufi mystic movement. In 1378 Soudoun Sheikouni, the Emir of the Joneima in Arabia, prohibited cannabis, considered one of the world's first-attested cannabis bans.\n\nThe Sufi tradition attributes the discovery of cannabis to Jafar Sharazi (Sheikh Haydar), a Sufi leader in the 12th century. Other Sufis attribute its origin to the apocryphal Khidr (\"Green Man\").\n\nSome modern Islamic leaders state that medical cannabis, but not recreational, is permissible in Islam. Imam Mohammad Elahi in Dearborn Heights, Michigan (United States), declared: \"Obviously, smoking marijuana for fun is wrong... It should be permissible only if that is the only option in a medical condition prescribed by medical experts.\"\n\nThough the argument has not been accepted by mainstream scholars, some writers have theorized that cannabis may have been used ritually in early Judaism, though these claims \"have been widely dismissed as erroneous\". Sula Benet (1967) claimed that the plant \"kaneh bosm קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם\" mentioned five times in the Hebrew Bible, and used in the holy anointing oil of the Book of Exodus, was in fact cannabis, although lexicons of Hebrew and dictionaries of plants of the Bible such as by Michael Zohary (1985), Hans Arne Jensen (2004) and James A. Duke (2010) and others identify the plant in question as either \"Acorus calamus\" or \"Cymbopogon citratus\".\n\nIn the modern era, Orthodox rabbi Moshe Feinstein stated in 1973 that cannabis was not permitted under Jewish law, due to its harmful effects. However Orthodox rabbis Efraim Zalmanovich (2013) and Chaim Kanievsky (2016) stated that medical, but not recreational, cannabis is kosher.\n\nIt is not known when Rastafari first claimed cannabis to be sacred, but it is clear that by the late 1940s Rastafari was associated with cannabis smoking at the Pinnacle community of Leonard Howell. Rastafari see cannabis as a sacramental and deeply beneficial plant that is the Tree of Life mentioned in the Bible. Peter Tosh, among many others, has quoted , \"... the herb is the healing of the nations.\" The use of cannabis, and particularly of long-stemmed water-pipes called chalices, is an integral part of what Rastafari call \"reasoning sessions\" where members join together to discuss life according to the Rasta perspective. They see the use of cannabis as bringing them closer to God (Jah), allowing the user to penetrate the truth of things more clearly.\n\nWhile it is not necessary to use cannabis to be a Rastafari, many use it regularly as a part of their faith, and pipes of cannabis are dedicated to His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I before being smoked. According to the anti-cult group the Watchman Fellowship \"The herb is the key to new understanding of the self, the universe, and God. It is the vehicle to cosmic consciousness\" and is believed to burn the corruption out of the human heart. Rubbing the ashes into the skin from smoked cannabis is also considered a healthy practice.\n\nPart of the Rastafari movement, elders of the 20th-century religious movement known as the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, consider cannabis to be the \"eucharist\", claiming it as an oral tradition from Ethiopia dating back to the time of Christ.\n\nScientology opposes the use of cannabis, and made \"Truth About Marijuana\" the focus of their 2016 World Health Day presentation.\n\nIn Sikhism, the First Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak, stated that using any mind altering substance (without medical purposes) is a distraction to keeping the mind clean of the name of God. According to the \"Sikh Rehat Maryada\", \"A Sikh must not take hemp (cannabis), opium, liquor, tobacco, in short any intoxicant. His only routine intake should be food and water\".\n\nHowever, there exists a tradition of Sikhs using edible cannabis, often in the form of the beverage bhang, particularly among the Sikh community known as Nihang.\n\nBeginning around the 4th century, Taoist texts mentioned using cannabis in censers. Needham cited the (ca. 570 AD) Taoist encyclopedia \"Wushang Biyao\" 無上秘要 (\"Supreme Secret Essentials\") that cannabis was added into ritual incense-burners, and suggested the ancient Taoists experimented systematically with \"hallucinogenic smokes\". The \"Yuanshi shangzhen zhongxian ji\" 元始上真眾仙記 (\"Records of the Assemblies of the Perfected Immortals\"), which is attributed to Ge Hong (283-343), says:\n\nLady Wei Huacun 魏華存 (252-334) and Xu Mi 許謐 (303-376) founded the Taoist Shangqing School. The Shangqing scriptures were supposedly dictated to Yang Xi 楊羲 (330-c. 386) in nightly revelations from immortals, and Needham proposed Yang was \"aided almost certainly by cannabis\". The \"Mingyi bielu\" 名醫別錄 (\"Supplementary Records of Famous Physicians\"), written by the Taoist pharmacologist Tao Hongjing (456-536), who also wrote the first commentaries to the Shangqing canon, says, \"Hemp-seeds (麻勃) are very little used in medicine, but the magician-technicians (\"shujia\" 術家) say that if one consumes them with ginseng it will give one preternatural knowledge of events in the future.\" A 6th-century AD Taoist medical work, the \"Wuzangjing\" 五臟經 (\"Five Viscera Classic\") says, \"If you wish to command demonic apparitions to present themselves you should constantly eat the inflorescences of the hemp plant.\"\n\nJoseph Needham connected myths about Magu, \"the Hemp Damsel\", with early Daoist religious usages of cannabis, pointing out that Magu was goddess of Shandong's sacred Mount Tai, where cannabis \"was supposed to be gathered on the seventh day of the seventh month, a day of seance banquets in the Taoist communities.\"\n\nOther religions have been founded in the past century that treat cannabis as a sacrament. They include the Santo Daime church, the THC Ministry, Cantheism, the Cannabis Assembly, the Church of Cognitive Therapy (COCT Ministry), Temple 420, Green Faith Ministries, the Church of Cognizance, the Church of the Universe, the Free Marijuana Church of Honolulu, the First Cannabis Church of Florida World Wide, the Free Life Ministry Church of Canthe, the Church of Higher Consciousness, and the federally tax-exempt inFormer Ministry Collective of Palms Springs, CA. The Temple of the True Inner Light believes that cannabis is one of the parts of God's body, along with the classical psychedelics: mescaline, psilocybin, LSD, and DMT. The First Church of Cannabis Inc. officially gained legal recognition in Indiana in 2015 following the passage of that state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Nonprofit religious organization Elevation Ministries opened its Denver headquarters, known as the International Church of Cannabis, on April 20, 2017.\n\nModern spiritual figures like Ram Dass openly acknowledge that the use of cannabis has allowed them to gain a more spiritual perspective and use the herb frequently for both its medicinal and mind-altering properties.\n\nIn Mexico, followers of the growing cult of Santa Muerte regularly use marijuana smoke in purification ceremonies, with marijuana often taking the place of incense used in mainstream Catholic rituals.\n\n\n\n"}

She was 20 when convicted of the torture murder of a classmate she committed at age 18.\n\nPike lived a troubled life and dropped out of high school. She joined the Job Corps, a government program aimed at helping low-income youth by offering vocational training and career skills, and attended the now-closed Job Corps center in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pike fell for a young man named Tadaryl Shipp, one year her junior. Together they \"dabbled\" in the occult and devil worship.\n\nPike became jealous of 19-year-old fellow student Colleen Slemmer, who she thought was trying to \"steal\" her boyfriend from her; friends of Slemmer deny the accusations. Along with friend Shadolla Peterson, 18, Pike planned to lure Slemmer to an isolated, abandoned steam plant close by on the University of Tennessee campus.\nOn January 12, 1995, Pike, Shipp, Peterson, and Slemmer signed out of the dormitory and proceeded to the woods, where Slemmer was told they wanted to make peace by offering her some marijuana. Upon arrival at the secluded location, Slemmer was attacked by Pike and Shipp while Peterson acted as lookout. Per later court testimony, for the next thirty minutes Slemmer was taunted, beaten, and slashed, and a pentagram was carved in her chest. Finally, Pike smashed Slemmer's skull with a large chunk of asphalt, killing her. Pike kept a piece of her victim's skull.\n\nPike began to show off the piece of skull around the school, and within thirty-six hours the three were arrested. The log book showed that the four of them left together and only three returned. They also found the piece of skull in Pike's jacket pocket. The girls' rooms were searched and a copy of the \"Satanic Bible\" was found in Shipp's. Pike insisted they were merely trying to scare her and it got out of control.\n\nThere was evidence and a confession. Pike was charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder. On March 22, 1996 after only a few hours of deliberation, Pike was found guilty on both counts. On March 30, 1996, Pike was sentenced to death by electrocution for the murder charge and 25 years in prison for the conspiracy charge. Shipp received a life sentence with the possibility of parole in 2028. Peterson, who had turned informant, received probation for pleading guilty to being an accessory.\n\nFollowing the guilty verdict, Pike \"launched, cancelled and then re-launched\" an appeal of her conviction in the Tennessee state courts. In June 2001, then again in June 2002, against the advice of her lawyers, Pike asked the courts to drop her appeal and sought to be executed via electrocution. Criminal Court Judge Mary Beth Leibowitz granted the request and an execution date of August 19, 2002, was set. Pike soon thereafter changed her mind and on July 8, 2002, defense lawyers filed a motion to allow the appeal process to continue. This motion was denied. However, on August 2, 2002 a three judge state appeals court panel ruled that the proceedings should be continued and the execution was not carried out. In December 2008, Pike's latest request for a new trial was turned down and she was returned to death row. This denied request is believed to be the final allowed under the appeals procedures in the State of Tennessee. As of May 2014, no execution date has been set and her case has now entered the federal court system. A federal court has denied a request to release and overturn the death penalty conviction.\n\nOn August 24, 2001, Pike (with alleged assistance from inmate Natasha Cornett) attacked and attempted to strangle fellow inmate Patricia Jones with a shoe string, and nearly succeeded in choking her to death. She was convicted of attempted first degree murder on August 12, 2004. Although it is the position of the Tennessee Department of Corrections that Natasha assisted in this crime, their investigators concluded there was insufficient evidence to charge her with helping Pike attack Jones.\n\nIn March 2012, it was revealed that Pike had made escape plans involving corrections officer Justin Heflin and a New Jersey man named Donald Kohut. Kohut had visited Pike in prison, but complete details of his relationship to Pike were not immediately known. The attempted prison break was thwarted by a joint investigation involving the Tennessee Department of Corrections, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and the New Jersey State Police.\n\nThe murder of Colleen Slemmer was featured on \"Deadly Women\", \"Killer Kids\", \"Killed by Gossip\", ‘’For My Man’’ and \"\".\n\n"}

There is also a small Protestant Christian community most of them came from Muslim backgrounds.\n\nChristianity spread to territory of Azerbaijan in the first years of the new era. The first stage of this period is called the period of Apostles Bartholomew and Thaddeus (same ones who Christianized Armenia), who spread the new religion by the benediction of the first patriarch of Jerusalem Yegub.

This church was constructed before the first Armenian Christian church.\n\nAdherents of Eastern Orthodox Christianity in Azerbaijan are mainly ethnic Russians and Georgians.

The Armenian Apostolic Church currently has no community outside the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Before the outbreak of the war, Armenians formed the largest Christian population in the country. Today, Armenian churches in Azerbaijan remain closed, because of the large outmigration of Armenians and fear of Azerbaijani attacks.

Two years later, Carey began to practice on a drum set. In his senior year of high school in Paola, Kansas, Carey joined the high school jazz band. Jazz would later play a huge role in his signature approach to the drum set in a rock setting. As Carey progressed through high school and later college at the University of Missouri–Kansas City, he began expanding his studies in percussion with theory into the principles of geometry, science, and metaphysics as well as delving into Sacred Geometry and certain hidden aspects of life and the occult. Carey also played jazz while attending college and got to experience the jazz scene in Kansas City.\n\nAfter college, a friend and bandmate convinced Carey to leave Kansas for Portland, Oregon, where he played briefly in various bands before moving to Los Angeles, where he was able to perform as a studio drummer with Carole King and perform live sets with Pigmy Love Circus. He also played in Green Jellö as Danny Longlegs and recorded the album \"Cereal Killer\". He would later find his way to Tool after coming to know singer Maynard James Keenan and guitarist Adam Jones and practicing with them in place of drummers the two had requested but had never shown up. Besides Tool, Carey also finds time for other projects new and old such as Legend of the Seagullmen, Pigmy Love Circus, Volto!, and Zaum.\n\nAlthough Carey has not officially aligned himself with any particular school of philosophy or religion, he has projected a deep interest in and understanding for the magickal arts – among them various occult teachings. Enochian symbols, geometric designs, and special symbolic percussive devices are featured on and in his drum kit. He is also a collector of First Edition Aleister Crowley books as well as books by one of Crowley's more innovative students, Kenneth Grant.\n\nCarey has laid claim to various drumming techniques that use sacred geometric figures such as the unicursal hexagram. The final product is very recognizable, fluent drumming, although to him it is much more: the official Tool website claims that Danny uses drumming as a ritual similar to occult rituals, with purposes varying from spiritual exploration to \"a gateway [which] summoned a daemon he has contained...that has been delivering short parables similar to passages within \"The Book of Lies\"\". Another geometric reference from the website was the inclusion of \"Nothing in This Book Is True...\" by Bob Frissell on the band's recommended reading list, a book that deals with sacred geometry and the evolution of human consciousness.\n\nIn his time away from Tool, Carey has contributed (and still regularly does) to a vast number of projects:\n\nCarey uses the wood tip version of his own signature model of drumstick made by Vic Firth. He previously had endorsed a signature model with Trueline Drumsticks (now Trueline's Tribal Assault model.)\n\nAt Winter NAMM 2009 Sonor released a Danny Carey signature snare drum, which is a 1 mm thick bronze 14x8\" snare with laser etched talisman symbols and his signature engraved around the vent hole.\n\nCarey also uses Paiste cymbals, Evans Drumheads, Hammerax Percussion, and Korg and Roland electronics.\n\nCarey's popularity among drummers and non-drummers alike stems from the diversity of his sound and dynamics through his years of learning jazz music, his technical ability, frequent use of odd time signatures, polyrhythms and polymeters. He has stated in interviews that he effectively treats his feet as he does his hands: he practices rudiments (used for sticking techniques) and even snare drum solos with his feet to improve his double bass drumming, hi-hat control and foot independence.\n\nIn search of new techniques, Carey has studied tabla with Aloke Dutta, who can be heard playing on the live version of the song \"Pushit\" (from \"Salival\"). This is especially apparent on tracks such as \"Disposition\" (\"Lateralus\") or \"Right in Two\" (\"10,000 Days\"), for which Carey has recorded the tabla parts himself in the studio. The tabla (and other percussive instruments) used in Tool's music are replicated live using the Mandala pads (in fact the pads are also used when recording in the studio, a notable example being the tabla solo of \"Right in Two\" from \"10,000 Days\").\n\nHe has also stated that when he is playing to an odd time signature, he tries to drum to the \"feel\" of the song and establish general \"inner pulse\" for the given time signature instead of fully counting it out.\n\nCarey has been featured in many drum and music magazines.\n\n"}

In Gaudīya Vaishnavism the Sātvata-tantra describes three different forms of Vishnu as: Mahā Vishnu, Garbhodakaśāyī Vishnu and Ksirodakaśāyī Vishnu (Paramātmā). Each form has a different role in the maintenance of the Universe and its inhabitants.\n\n\"For material creation, Lord Krishna's plenary expansion assumes three Vishnus. The first, Mahā Viṣhṇu, creates the total material energy, known as the mahat-tattva. The second, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, enters into all the universes to create diversities and the third, Kṣīrodakaśāyī Vishnu, is diffused as the all-pervading super soul in all the universes; in the heart of every living being, is known as Paramātmā.

{"id": "19680490", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19680490", "title": "Govardhan Puja", "text": "Govardhan Puja\n\nGoverdhan Puja as it is also known, is a Hindu festival in which devotees prepare and offer a large variety of vegetarian food to Bhagwan (God) Shri Krishna as a mark of gratitude. For Vaishnavas, this day commemorates the incident in the Bhagavata Puran when Bhagwan Shri Krishna lifted the Govardhan Hill to provide the villagers of Vrindavan shelter from torrential rains. The incident is seen to represent how God will protect all devotees who take singular refuge in him. Devotees offer a mountain of food, metaphorically representing the Govardhan Hill, to God as a ritual remembrance and to renew their faith in taking refuge in God. The festival is observed by most of Hindu denominations all over India and abroad. For Vaishnavas this is one of the important festivals. For the Vallabh Sampradaya (Pushtimarg), the Gaudiya Sampradaya of Chaitanya, and the Swaminarayan Sampradaya etc among others. The Annakut festival occurs on the first lunar day of Shukla Paksha (bright fortnight) in the Hindu calendar month of Kartik, which is the fourth day of Deepawali (Diwali), the Hindu festival of lights, and also the first day of the Vikram Samvat calendar.\n\nThe 2017 date for this observance is October 20.\n\nKrishna spent most of his childhood in Braj, a place devotees associate with many of Krishna’s divine and heroic exploits with his childhood friends. One of the most significant incidents, described in the Bhagavata Purana, involves Krishna lifting Mount Govardhan (Govardhan Hill), a low hill situated in the middle of Braj. According to the Bhagavata Purana, forest-dwelling cowherds living close to Govardhan used to celebrate the autumn season by paying respect to Indra, the God of rain and storm. Krishna did not approve of this since he desired that the villagers worship Mount Govardhan with the reason that Mount Govardhan is the one that provides natural resources to the villagers for their livelihood. Trees provided oxygen, the grass provided food for the cattle and provided natural beauty. The mountain was responsible for the natural phenomena that occur in the city of Gokul. Indra got angry with this advice. Shri Krishna, though being younger than almost everyone in the city, was respected by everyone due to his knowledge and immense power. So, the people of Gokul agreed with Shri Krishna's advice. Indra was angered upon seeing the villagers' devotion diverted away from him and toward Krishna. Indra decided to initiate thunderstorms and heavy rains in the city in reflex of his egoistic anger. To protect the people from the storms, Shri Krishna lifted the Govardhan mount on his little finger and provided shelter to all the people and cattle of the city. After 7–8 days of continuous storms, seeing the people of Gokul being unaffected, Indra accepted defeat and stopped the storms. This day is therefore celebrated as a festival that paid respect to Mount Govardhan by preparing a 'giriyajna' - a \"great offering of foods and delicacies to the mountain\" Krishna then assumed the form of a mountain himself and accepted the villagers' offerings. . Indra, after causing torrential rains for seven days, ultimately gave up and bowed to Krishna’s superiority. This story is one of the most recognizable in the Bhagavata Purana.\n\nGovardhan has since become a major pilgrimage site in Braj for devotees of Krishna. On the day of Annakut, devotees circumambulate the hill and offer food to the mountain—one of the oldest rituals in Braj. The circumambulation consists of an eleven-mile trek dotted along the way with several shrines, before which devotees place flowers and other offerings.\n\nFamilies create an image of Giriraj Govardhan (the mountain) from cow dung, adorning it with miniature cow figures as well as grass as twigs, representing trees and greenery. In the days leading up to Annakut, fifty-six food items (chappan bhog) are typically prepared and offered in the evening. Someone from a cow-herding caste officiates the ritual, circling the hill with a cow and a bull, followed by families in the village. They partake in the sanctified food after offering the food to the hill. The festival often draws a large crowd, including the Chaube brahmins of Mathura.\n\nAnnakut is celebrated on the fourth day of Diwali. The fourth day of Diwali is also the first day of the new year in the Vikram Samvat calendar. Therefore, the rituals surrounding Annakut are closely linked with the rituals of the five days of Diwali. While the first three days of Diwali are days of prayer to sanctify wealth and invite greater wealth into the devotee’s life, the annakut day is a day of offering gratitude for Krishna beneficence\n\nGovardhan Puja is a principal ritual performed during Annakut. Although some texts treat Govardhan Puja and Annakut as synonymous, the Govardhan Puja is one segment of the day-long Annakut festival.\n\nThere are many variants of how Govardhan Puja is performed. One ritual is performed in which a god is (Lord Krishna)makes from cow dung in horizontal position.After, completing the structure it is decorated by earthernlamps(deepak or diya),the seenkh(a material which is same as the broom's chaff),candles and after worshiping,the structure of lord is feed by the bhaktas or worshipersand the ladies do fasts Prayers are also made to Lord Govardhan.\n\nAs described in the Bhagavata Purana , Govardhan Puja is chiefly identified with Krishna lifting the Govardhan Hill on his finger to protect those who sought his refuge from Indra’s torrential rage.\n\nVast array of vegetarian foods is traditionally arranged in tiers or steps in front of the deities. Usually, the sweets are placed nearest to the Deities. As the tiers descend, other foods such as 'dal', vegetables, pulses and fried savory foods are arranged. A mound of cooked grains, symbolic of Mount Govardhan, is placed in the center. In Swaminarayan shikharbaddh mandirs, sadhus begin to arrange the Annakut in the morning and finish before noon.\n\nIn all Swaminarayan mandirs, sadhus and devotees then sing 'Thaal' - kirtans or devotional hymns composed by the poet paramhansas of Swaminarayan. These kirtans describe the food items, and are about praying to the Deities to accept the food. The singing lasts for about an hour, and is followed by a grand arti. Afterwards, devotees do puja and circumambulate the Deities and offered food. In some mandirs, Arti is performed several times in the day as long as the Annakut offerings remain before the Deities. In the evening, devotees take portions of the Annakut as prasad, sanctified food, that has been offered to God and is received as his mercy.\n\nIn certain mandirs, especially in Mathura and Nathadwara, the murtis are also given a milk bath before being and dressed in elegant clothes and ornaments.\n\nSome craftsmen pay reverence to their tools and machinery on the day of Annakut.\n\nHindus throughout the world actively celebrate Annakut as a part of Diwali and, most frequently, pair the Annakut celebration with the Govardhan Puja performed on fourth day of Diwali celebrations. Hindus also view Annakut as a time to transmit religious and cultural values to children, ask for forgiveness from God and express devotion towards God. Annakut is celebrated with diyas (small oil lamps) and rangoli, decorative art on the ground made from colored rice, colored sand, and/or flower petals. Many distinct food items, sometimes numbering in the hundreds or thousands, are offered to deities during Annakut. For example, 250 kilograms of food were offered to Lord Krishna at the ISKCON temple in Mysore, India in 2009. Although Annakut is most often associated with Lord Krishna, other deities are also focal points. At the Shree Mahalakshmi Mandir in Mumbai, India, 56 sweets and food items are offered to Mataji and then distributed as Prasad to more than 500 devotees.\n\nThe Annakut festival is also celebrated annually at approximately 3,850 BAPS Mandirs and centers throughout the world in a day-long event. During the festival, Swaminarayan devotees prepare and offer a large variety of vegetarian food to Hindu deities including Swaminarayan and Krishna, among others. The Annakut festival at BAPS mandirs is often the largest festival of the year. Visitors learn about Hindu spirituality, offer prayers for the new year, partake in the prasad, or sanctified food, and engage in other devotional activities. A devotee at the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Leicester, England, which organizes the Annakut festival every year, describes Annakut as being a forum where spiritual aspirants can reaffirm their appreciation for the role God plays in their lives. These gatherings also represent an opportunity to reaffirm a sense of community. At the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Neasden, England in 2004, 1247 vegetarian dishes were assembled and offered to the deities during the Annakut celebrations in 2000 at the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Neasden, England.\n"}

In 1975, he was awarded the , the Philippines' highest literary honor bestowed on the best works in Spanish. Due to his expertise in the Spanish language as well as his knowledge of various Philippine languages, including Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Tagalog/Filipino, and Chavacano, he was appointed secretary of the Commission on the Filipino Language Committee of the Philippine Constitutional Convention (1971–73).\n\nAs a Spanish professor at Adamson University he authored textbooks on Spanish grammar, speech and composition while working for San Miguel Corporation, a food conglomerate. He used his academic position to try to influence national debates on the question of whether or not Spanish should be retained as a compulsory subject in Philippine high schools and universities, a battle that many pro-Spanish advocates believe they had lost with the passage of the 1987 Constitution but which some Hispanists say started with the 1973 Constitution.\n\nHaving done extensive research on Spanish dances, including flamenco and Sevillanas, he formed a dance school to teach students of all ages an appreciation of Spanish culture through the dance art. He traveled to Spain to improve his skills, learning from Spanish masters of these dance forms. He is considered a maestro de flamenco in the Philippines.\n\nIn an hour-long broadcast devoted to Asia on September 24, 2013, Spanish Radio and Television Corp. (RTVE) described Gómez Rivera as a \"writer, journalist, historian...[who] has tracked incessantly Hispanic legacy in the Philippines and has recovered part of an endangered folklore. During the same broadcast, RTVE played songs from an LP of rare Filipino compositions in Spanish that Gómez Rivera recorded in 1960 and reissued in 2006 after it had been digitally remastered.\n\nIn addition to his contributions to Philippine literature and history, Gómez Rivera is also an accomplished linguist and polyglot. He speaks and writes fluently in his native Hiligaynon as well as in English and Tagalog. Aside from being an acclaimed master of the Spanish language in the Philippines, he is also conversant in Italian, Portuguese, Kinaray-a and Cebuano, and has made an extensive study of the Visayan and Chavacano languages.\n\nGuillermo Gómez Rivera was born in Dingle, Iloilo on the southeast portion of Panay Island and graduated from the University of San Agustin in Iloilo City with degrees in commerce and in education. In 1967, he earned a BA from the Colegio de San Juan de Letrán. Shortly afterwards, he obtained a doctorate in Philippine Literature under the tutelage of a Jesuit academic.\n\nHe has been a lifelong advocate of the Spanish language in the Philippines. Most of his written works argue in favor of the preservation of the Philippine-Hispanic identity of the country, particularly the Spanish language, which was used by the founding fathers of Philippine independence in their struggle against Spain. These revolutionaries and writers included Jose Rizal.\n\nAs secretary of the National Language Committee of the Philippine Constitutional Convention (1971–1973) during the presidency of Ferdinand E. Marcos, he favored Tagalog to become the basis of the country's national language. In the same convention, he joined forces with other nationalists to preserve Spanish as one of the country's official languages. Spanish, however, was later made an optional language (together with Arabic) under the Constitution of 1987 which was promulgated under the presidency of Corazón Aquino who abolished the 1973 constitution under Marcos.\n\nHe is a grandnephew of Guillermo Gómez Windham, a famous Filipino writer during the American colonial period. Of British descent who served as Philippine bureau of customs commissioner during the American Occupation, Gómez Windham was the first Premio Zóbel medal recipient when the award was launched in 1922. Gómez has two children: the late Marién, also an accomplished flamenco dancer, and Guillermo Gómez Ordóñez. He currently resides in Makati City. He has practically transformed his home into a Spanish dance studio and library of Filipiniana materials.\n\nAlthough literary critics regard Gómez Rivera's writing style as combative, it hews to the works in English of his friend Nick Joaquin,arguably the most accomplished Filipino writer in English. Joaquín's body of written works were subtly about the \"Hispanic soul\" of the Philippines brought about by three centuries of Spanish rule. Joaquín's stories in particular were sentimental, reminiscing about the Philippines' Spanish past as well as lamenting its decline. Gómez has been writing on the same theme, more thoroughly about the decadence of the country's \"Hispanic soul,\" but his style is often combative and tends to lay blame for the near demise of the Spanish language in his country on what he calls White Anglo-Saxon Protestant \"domination\" of the country's educational and economic life. He identifies this strangle hold as \"the cause of the moral and economic impoverishment of the Philippines, and the loss of the Spanish language.\" Gómez Rivera has articulated this theme in fiery essays, short stories and poems written in various Filipino languages as well as in English and Spanish.\n\nOrganizers of the Premio Zóbel, in awarding him the prize in 1975, cited \"his efforts to preserve the Spanish language and culture in our country,\" although some literary historians mistakenly believe he won the award solely for his play \"El caseron.\" Prior to winning the Premio Zóbel, Gómez won second place in the Premio Manuel Bernabé for an essay on the historical and nationalistic value and importance of the Spanish language.\n\nGómez Rivera, as editor of \"Nueva era\", a weekly and only remaining Spanish language newspaper in the Philippines, has used his editorials to attack government officials whom he accuses as \"vile puppets of U.S. WASP neocolonialism,\" claiming proofs to bolster his accusations. Through his body of literary works, he has urged Filipino readers to \"rediscover\" their Spanish past in order for them to gain knowledge of their true national identity.\n\nHe views cultural dissemination as a tool to accomplish his advocacy, particularly through dance. His research on Philippine songs and dances, especially those of Hispanic influence, was used by the internationally acclaimed Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company to choreograph some of its performances with him acting as adviser for the group.\n\nGómez Rivera is also a recording artist who has cut an album of Filipino songs that were originally in Spanish as well as in Chavacano. He is credited for reintroducing to the modern local film industry the now forgotten film \"Secreto de confesión,\" the first locally produced film spoken and sung in Spanish (\"la primera película hablada y cantada en español producida en Filipinas\").\n\nHis efforts to bring back the Filipino national identity based on Spanish have led some critics, such as poet-academician Edmundo Farolán and poet-novelist Gilbert Luis R. Centina III, to call him \"El Don Quixote Filipino.\"\n\nIn May 2015, Gómez Rivera published his first novel, \"Quis ut Deus\" (Who Is Like God), the first Spanish-language novel published in the Philippines in the last 55 years.\n\nGómez Rivera honed his dancing skills in short courses conducted by Spanish international dancers such as \"Los Chavales de España,\" Antonio Ruiz and José Greco who visited Manila in the 1970s and the 1980s. But his introduction to flamenco came much earlier at the age of four when he learned it, along with many other Spanish dances, from Rosa Jiménez. She was a flamenco dancer from Sevilla, Spain and the second wife of his maternal grandfather, José Rivera Franco.\n\nOver the years he compiled a repertoire of more than a hundred choreographed dances, mostly for the Gypsy and Andalusian schools. Flamenco has six schools, namely: \"Escuela Andaluza\" (Andalusian), \"Escuela Bolera\", \"Escuela Creativa\" (or \"de Fusión\"), \"Escuela Folklórica\", \"Escuela Gitana\" (Gypsy) and \"Escuela Popular.\"He has developed a five-level flamenco course called \"choreographic immersion\" with preliminary drills in footwork and hand and body movements, including the \"compás\" of fours and twelves. His students learn many of these dances with or without castanettes. Gómez Rivera's dance students include some of Manila's most well-known socialites such as Marissa Aboitiz, Marités Cancio-Suplico, María Emma Estrada, Cecile de Joya, actress Maggie de la Riva, former Philippine Basketball Association coach Dante Silverio, Perla Primicias (daughter of former Philippine Senator Cipriano Primicias), and his own now deceased daughter Marién Gómez de Lizares.\n\nGómez Rivera spent several years teaching Spanish grammar, Philippine history and philosophy at Adamson University. For a time, he served as the head of Adamson's Spanish department. He retired from the university in 2001, but he continues to teach flamenco in his home and in Steps Dance Studio in Makati. He occasionally offers Spanish language tutorial and has served as the official interpreter of President Benigno S. Aquino III such as when he hosted the first lady of Mexico during the early years of his presidency.\n\nDuring his teaching stint, he was president of \"Corporación Nacional de Profesores en Español\" (CONAPE), an organization of Filipino educators who teach the Spanish language.\n\nGómez Rivera's journalism career started with the magazine \"El maestro\" during the 1960s. Its goal was to aid Filipino teachers in Spanish in the practice of their profession. Aside from being the current editor of \"Nueva era\", he also edits two other weeklies: \"The Listening Post\" and \"The Tagalog Chronicle.\" In 1997, he worked on television as a segment host of ABS-CBN's now defunct early morning program Alas Singko y Medya, presenting a five-minute Spanish lesson. Gómez Rivera released an LP back in 1960 when he was producing \"La voz hispanofilipina\", a radio program on DZRH. It was a product of his research on a number of \"lost\" Filipino songs sung in Spanish during the Spanish colonial era. He reintroduced the songs through the LP entitled \"Nostalgia filipina\", where his vocal interpretation is accompanied by a rondalla.\nDigitally remastered with funding from the Spanish Program for Cultural Cooperation, the LP was reissued and launched at Instituto Cervantes de Manila on August 14, 2006.\n\n\n"}

In the rescript, which follows the Five Charter Oath of 1868, the Emperor denied the concept of his being a living god, which would eventually lead to the promulgation of the new Constitution, under which the Emperor is \"the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people\".\n\nThe rescript is not officially titled, but apart from its popular name, \"Humanity Declaration\" or \"Ningen-sengen\", it is also known as and .\n\nDelivery of this rescript was to be one of Hirohito's last acts as the imperial Sovereign. The Supreme Commander Allied Powers and the Western world in general gave great attention to the following passage towards the end of the rescript:\n\nAccording to the popular Western view, promoted by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, this challenged the centuries-old claim that the Japanese emperor and his predecessors were descendants of the sun goddess Amaterasu, and thus the Emperor had now publicly admitted that he was not a living god. Thus, the same day as the rescript was issued, General Douglas MacArthur announced that he was very much pleased with Hirohito's statement, which he saw as his commitment to lead his people in the democratisation of Japan.\n\nHirohito was persistent in the idea that the emperor of Japan should be considered a descendant of the gods. In December 1945, he told his vice-grand chamberlain Michio Kinoshita: \"It is permissible to say that the idea that the Japanese are descendants of the gods is a false conception; but it is absolutely impermissible to call chimerical the idea that the emperor is a descendant of the gods.\"\n\nCritics of the Western interpretation, including the Emperor himself, argue that the repudiation of divinity was not the point of the rescript. Since this rescript starts with a full quote from the Five Charter Oath of 1868 by the Meiji Emperor, the Emperor's true intention was that Japan had already been democratic since the Meiji Era and was not democratised by the occupiers. As was clarified at a press interview of 23 August 1977, the Emperor wanted the Japanese people not to forget pride in Japan. This interpretation is confirmed by the fact that the imperial rescript was published with a commentary by Prime Minister Kijūrō Shidehara that dwelt exclusively on the prior existence of democracy in the Meiji Era and did not make even passing reference to the emperor's \"renunciation of divinity\".\n\nThis rescript is said to have been drafted by Reginald Horace Blyth and Harold Gould Henderson, who also contributed to the popularisation of Zen and the poetic form of haiku outside Japan.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "693120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=693120", "title": "Maneki-neko", "text": "Maneki-neko\n\nThe is a common Japanese figurine (lucky charm, talisman) which is often believed to bring good luck to the owner. In modern times, they are usually made of ceramic or plastic. The figurine depicts a cat (traditionally a calico Japanese Bobtail) beckoning with an upright paw, and is usually displayed in—often at the entrance of—shops, restaurants, pachinko parlors, and other businesses. Some of the sculptures are electric or battery-powered and have a slow-moving paw beckoning. \n\n\"Maneki-neko\" comes in different colors, styles and degrees of ornateness. Common colors are white, black, gold and sometimes red. In addition to ceramic figurines, \"maneki-neko\" can be found as keychains, piggy banks, air fresheners, house-plant pots, and miscellaneous ornaments, as well as large statues. It is also sometimes incorrectly called the \"Chinese lucky cat\" because of its popularity among Chinese merchants.\n\nTo some Westerners (Italians and Spaniards are notable exceptions) it may seem as if the \"maneki-neko\" is waving rather than beckoning. This is due to the difference in gestures and body language recognized by some Westerners and the Japanese. The Japanese beckoning gesture is made by holding up the hand, palm down, and repeatedly folding the fingers down and back, thus the cat's appearance. Some \"maneki-neko\" made specifically for some Western markets will have the cat's paw facing upwards, in a beckoning gesture that is more familiar to most Westerners.\n\n\"Maneki-neko\" can be found with either the right or left paw raised (and sometimes both). The significance of the right and left raised paw differs with time and place. According to a general rule of thumb, statue with the left paw raised is meant to be displayed in drinking establishments, while the one with the right paw for all other places of business; another interpretation is that right is for home and left for business.\n\nSome \"maneki-neko\" feature battery- or solar-powered moving arms endlessly engaged in the beckoning gesture.\n\nAntique examples of \"maneki-neko\" may be made of carved wood, stone and metal, handmade porcelain or cast iron.\n\nIt is commonly believed that \"Maneki-neko\" originated in Tokyo (then named Edo), while some insist it was Kyoto. \"Maneki-neko\" first appeared during the later part of the Edo period in Japan. The earliest records of \"Maneki-neko\" appear in the Bukō nenpyō's (a chronology of Edo) entry dated 1852. Utagawa Hiroshige's ukiyo-e \"Joruri-machi Hanka no zu,\" painted also in 1852, depicts the Marushime-neko, a variation of \"Maneki-neko\", being sold at Senso temple, Tokyo. In 1876, during the Meiji era, it was mentioned in a newspaper article, and there is evidence that kimono-clad \"maneki-neko\" were distributed at a shrine in Osaka during this time. A 1902 advertisement for \"maneki-neko\" indicates that by the turn of the century they were popular.\n\nBeyond this the exact origins of \"maneki-neko\" are uncertain, though several folktales offer explanations.\n\nOthers have noted the similarities between the \"maneki-neko\"'s gesture and that of a cat washing its face. There is a Japanese belief that a cat washing its face means a visitor will soon arrive. This belief may in turn be related to an even older Chinese proverb that states that if a cat washes its face, it will rain. Thus, it is possible a belief arose that a figure of a cat washing its face would bring in customers. In his \"Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang\", China's Tang Dynasty author Duan Chengshi (803?–863) wrote: \"If a cat raises its paw over the ears and washes its face, then patrons will come\".\n\n\"Maneki-neko\" is the subject of a number of folktales. Here are some of the most popular, explaining the cat's origins:\n\nThe stray cat and the shop: The operator of an impoverished shop (or inn, tavern, temple, etc.) takes in a starving, stray cat despite barely having enough to feed himself. In gratitude, the cat sits in the front of the store beckoning customers, thus bringing prosperity as a reward to the charitable proprietor. Ever after, the \"beckoning cat\" has been a symbol of good luck for small business owners.\n\nModern Japanese folklore suggests that keeping a talisman of good fortune, such as the \"maneki-neko\", in bedrooms and places of study will bring about favorable results and life successes.\n\nBecause of its popularity in Chinese communities (including Chinatowns in the United States) the \"maneki-neko\" is frequently mistaken for being Chinese in origin rather than Japanese, and is incorrectly referred to as a \"Chinese lucky cat\" or \"jīnmāo\" (\"golden cat\"). This cat is also prevalent in China domestically, and is usually referred to as the followings: .\n\nThe Pokémon named Meowth is based upon the \"maneki-neko\". Unlike traditional Maneki-neko who hold the Koban coin, Meowth has the coin projected from its forehead. Meowth can fire this coin as a projectile weapon with its signature move Payday.\n\nNetta performed her song \"Toy\" in front of two walls full of maneki-neko at the Eurovision Song Contest 2018. She won the competition after collecting 529 points at the final.\n\n\n"}

Scholars regard the document as an anti-Jesuit forgery.\n\nAccording to the Monita, Jesuits are to use every means at their disposal to acquire wealth for the order. For instance, Jesuits are encouraged to entice promising young men to enter the order and endow it with their estates; rich widows are to be cajoled and dissuaded from remarriage. Every means is to be used for the advancement of Jesuits to bishoprics or other ecclesiastical dignities and to discredit the members of other orders, while the world is to be persuaded that the Society is animated by the purest and least interested motives: the reputation of those who quit it is to be assailed and maligned in every way.\n\nScholars consider the Monita to be the work of one Jerome Zahorowski, a Pole, who, having been a member of the Society, had been expelled for disciplinary matters in 1613. They were first published in Krakow in 1615, purporting to be a translation from the Spanish, and were printed in the same city in 1614. Various stories were told regarding their discovery; they were most often associated with Duke Christian of Brunswick, despite the fact that he would have been only 15 years old at the time of their initial publication. The place where they were found was variously set down as Paderborn, Prague, Liège, Antwerp, Glatz, and on board a captured East Indiaman.\n\nAttempts were likewise made at various times, as late even as 1783, to excite interest in the work as the result of a new discovery; there was also an undated edition, in the early nineteenth century, which professes to issue from the Propaganda Press, and to be authenticated by the testimonies of various Jesuit authorities. However, they are attributed to a general, \"Felix Aconiti\", who is completely unknown in the Annals of the Society of Jesus. The censor who purportedly approves the publication bears the name \"Pasquinelli\", while the titles which, it is alleged, should ensure the esteem of men in general for the Society, include all the crimes and abominations of every kind—immoralities, conspiracies, murders, and regicides—which the Jesuits' bitterest enemies have attributed to it.\n\nAmongst those who have argued that the \"Monita\" are a hoax are Bishop Lipski of Cracow (1616), Father Bernard Duhr in his \"Jesuiten Fablen\", Fra Paolo Sarpi, the historian of the Council of Trent and Antoine Arnauld and the \"Nouvelles Ecclesiastiques\"; plus anti-Jesuits such as the Jansenists Henri de Saint-Ignace and Blaise Pascal, von Lang, Johann Joseph Ignaz von Döllinger, Friedrich (the author of Janus), Huber, and Reusch, as well as the Protestant historian Johann Karl Ludwig Gieseler. In the British House of Commons, during the debates on Catholic Emancipation, the fraudulent character of the \"Monita\" was acknowledged by more than one speaker, while the authorities of the British Museum and likewise the French bibliographer M. Barbier, agree in describing the work as \"apocryphal\".\n\nAnglican Bishop of London Henry Compton was strongly opposed to Roman Catholicism, and in 1669 published an English translation of \"The Secret Instructions\".\n\nA defense was offered by Richard Frederick Littledale, opponent to Roman Catholicism, in his article \"Jesuits\", in the Encyclopædia Britannica of 1881. He claimed that the work is \"both caricature and libel\", but pleaded nevertheless that it was substantially true, since its author, \"a shrewd and keen observer\", having noticed how Jesuits actually worked, deduced from his observations the rules by which they were guided.\n\nAs against this case, John Gerard, writing in the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" denies the authorship arguing that the official rules and constitutions of the Jesuits contradict these supposed instructions, for they expressly prohibit the acceptance of ecclesiastical dignities by its subjects, unless compelled by papal authority, and from the days of the founder, St. Ignatius Loyola, the Society has impeded such promotion. Gerard also argues that in many cases, genuine private instructions from the Jesuit general to subordinate superiors have fallen into hostile hands, which in many cases are found to give instructions directly contrary to those in the \"Monita\".\n\nJames Bernauer draws comparisons between the \"Monita Secreta\" to the later no less libelous, discredited anti-Semitic Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4766446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4766446", "title": "New Church Education", "text": "New Church Education\n\nNew Church Education is a philosophy of education developed and practiced by the General Church of the New Jerusalem, one of the New Church or Swedenborgian sects. This philosophy is based on some of works of Emanuel Swedenborg, whose theological writings are considered by members of this church to be the revealed Word of God, equal in authority to the Old Testament and the New Testament.\n\nEarly in its history, the General Church of the New Jerusalem adopted distinctiveness as one of its central principles. Its members worked to clearly identify those things found in Swedenborg's theological writings that differentiated the New Church, as described there, from other churches and then to incorporate those distinctions into their institutions and actions.\n\nDeveloping a distinctive theory and practice of education became important as compulsory education spread across the United States. Looking into their revelation, members of the General Church of the New Jerusalem pieced together a new idea of how a child's mind develops from birth into adulthood. This developmental process formed the basis of a distinctive educational philosophy designed to give children in formal educational settings the experiences and knowledge believed to provide a solid foundation for the lifelong process of spiritual regeneration and growth.\n\nThe main purpose of New Church education is to help students learn, love, and live the teachings of the Lord God Jesus Christ as revealed in the Old and New Testaments and the Heavenly Doctrines of the New Jerusalem. Base on the ideas revealed through Emanuel Swedenborg about the growth and development of a child's mind, New Church Education provides for the spiritual development of each student, focusing on the essential areas described in the Ten Religious Goals of New Church Education.\n\nAccording to the New Church, everyone is born with inherited tendencies to do evil. Unlike the doctrine of original sin, however, a child inherits only the tendencies to committing the same sins committed by their parents and grandparents, etc. and not the sins themselves. This means that while the newborn's will (or motivation| motivational faculty) is totally corrupt and their interests are completely self-centered, they are not condemned by that corruption because they remain innocent of any sin.\n\nThe implication is that without proper education in childhood, children will naturally tend towards destructive decisions and attitudes, behaviors that will become sins once the child becomes an adult and is responsible for his or her own actions. A proper education, then, includes learning to think clearly, to look at the world from a spiritual point of view, to understand the difference between right and wrong, and to practice good spiritual habits.\n\nOne of the primary goals of New Church education is to maintain the innocence belonging to childhood for as long as possible (See \"State of mind at birth\" above). Different than naiveté, the New Church idea of \"innocence\" refers to a state of mind free from sin because of a willingness to be led by the Lord. One can be quite knowledgeable about the world and still be willing to be led. Specifically, childhood is a time of \"innocence of ignorance,\" that is, children are free from sin because they do not yet fully understand the difference between good and evil and cannot accurately see the future consequence of their choices. Even though children do things that would be considered evil and sinful if done by an adult, they are not yet held accountable because they cannot yet knowingly commit sin—not fully understanding what sin is.\n\nBecause children are innocent and thus willing to be led, they are most open to learning the difference between right and wrong and practicing that understanding into lifelong habits. New Church education, then, intends to provide formal instruction in academic subjects in a way that also explains, demonstrates, and provides and opportunity to practice those differences between right and wrong.\n\nProponents of New Church Education believe that consistent messages from home, church, and school—three of the most influentional institutions in a child's life—as to what constitutes good and evil is the most effective way to reduce the impact of conflicting messages from other sources. This consistency of message is to support the establishment of good habits that provide a solid foundation for the work of regeneration in adulthood, when the innocence of ignorance necessarily fades into spiritual struggles to do what is good and shun what is evil.\n\nThe school is said to \"extend\" the home because the values taught at school and upon which the school is founded should duplicate the values held and taught by the families who send their children to become students. Schools should not impose values on the home, but should reinforce the values taught at home.\n\nNew Church Educational philosophy is organized around the following 10 topics. Each topic is associated with a religious goal for the educational environment based on a passage from the Writings for the New Church:\n\nNew Church people in Great Britain started the first schools to offer education which looked to the Lord in the Old Testament, the New Testament, and the Heavenly Doctrine. Some of these were day schools and others were a variation of Sunday School but they all gave children instruction in reading, writing and arithmetic as well as religion. During the 1800s over thirty day schools were operating in England, offering a basic education but most of these closed in the early 1900s. Yet even as these schools were closing, there was a rededication to New Church education among those sympathetic with the goals of the Academy of the New Church. Schools opened in London and Colchester which continued to offer education in the light of New Church teachings for many years. Why did they carry on with New Church education? The answer lies in what was happening in the United States and Canada.\n\nAs New Church ideas spread to North America, many congregations in the United States and in Canada started day schools as well as Sunday Schools. But as the quality of public education improved and it became more accessible, most congregations decided to focus on their Sunday School programs as a way to teach children about the Lord and His Word. There were others who felt strongly about the importance of New Church education in the home, in school, and on Sundays. They felt that one of the most effective ways to help the church was to give children their academic education in the light of New Church teachings. They wanted children to hear or read stories from the Lord’s Word each day and have a supportive environment to help them apply these teachings in their lives. Those believing that New Church education plays an essential role in the life of the church rallied around the Academy of the New Church when it was established in 1876. Many congregations opened elementary schools in support of Academy ideals. These schools are affiliated with the General Church of the New Jerusalem, which works closely with the Academy.\n\nThe Academy has been a center for New Church education since its founding in 1876, looking to the Lord in the light of the Old Testament, the New Testament, and the Heavenly Doctrine. It is composed of four private, accredited schools located in Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia. The Academy offers education for high school and college students as well as those wanting a post-graduate degree in New Church theology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "38859627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38859627", "title": "Onarigami", "text": "Onarigami\n\nRyukyuan religion is the indigenous belief system of the Ryūkyū Islands. It is largely based on ancestor veneration and concerned with relationships with the supernatural world. It is similar to Shinto but is also influenced by Polynesian religious beliefs and practices.\n\nOver time, Ryūkyūan religious practice has been influenced by Chinese religions, Buddhism, and Shinto.\n\nIn the late fifteenth century, King Shō Shin established a formal hierarchy of religious officials that corresponded closely to the hierarchy of male government officials. He appointed his sister as the high priestess, known as the \"kikoe-ōgimi\". By the sixteenth century, the traditional Ryūkyūan beliefs were part of a well-structured state religion in the Ryūkyūan Kingdom. The hierarchy of priestesses were an important factor in keeping the Ryūkyūan Kingdom unified. The royal authority of kings was closely interwoven with the power of female religious officials to confer spiritual power (\"seji\" or \"shiji\") (Smits, 55). However, the king was not originally a large part in most important rites of the state. His role was passive compared to the Buddhist monks, high priestess and other leading female religious officials (Smits, 101).\n\nNear the end of the sixteenth century, the Shimazu clan of Satsuma invaded the Ryūkyūan Kingdom with the approval of the Japanese rulers in Edo. As many of Satsuma’s elite viewed the Ryūkyūans as culturally inferior, a number of contemporary politicians attempted to reform the kingdom in order to be more acceptable to both the Japanese rulers and to China. During this time, it is thought that the brother-sister relationship became more important than ties to wives and mothers largely as a result of the influence of state formation and the introduction of a patrilineal form of kinship.\n\nSatsuma slowly attempted to strip power from women. In 1611, the Fifteen Articles Decree included an article that stated women were no longer eligible for state offices. Links between the court and the outlying islands that had been affected by state priestesses were transferred into the male sphere. In 1667, regional priestess had to be represented by a male official instead of being able to travel to Shuri themselves for important occasions. By 1768, they could no longer receive gifts from the king in local offices, but had to instead deliver them to their homes. The king became the major actor in rites of state, and supplanted the \"nūru\" as the central link with “Heaven.” New Ryūkyūan rites prevented women from participating in key roles.\n\nMany of these changes were met with the resistance of the Ryūkyūan people. Shō Shōken initially gained little support from other officials in taking steps against \"yuta\". Confucianism never became popular with the common people, and traditional religious practices continued in the countryside. It is likely that the royal government had more control over the lives of peasants near major urban areas of Okinawa. Critical voices of the government in this time included the female poet Onna Nabe, whose writings indicated a strong personal connection to \"onarigami\".\nThe failure of the formal prohibition against \"yuta\" was acknowledged by government, but the government’s stated ideals would not permit repealing it. Gregory Smits writes that this exemplified the “widening gap between an increasingly Confucianized central government and a peasantry that continued steadfast in its traditional religious beliefs and practices - with local officials caught in the middle,” (116).\n\nIn 1879, the Ryūkyū Domain was renamed Okinawa Prefecture by the Meiji government and the monarchy was abolished. The land reforms of 1903 made land property of patrilineally organized families, which deprived village priestesses of their income, and, incidentally, some of their influence. However, they still retained some power, especially in out-of-the way places.\n\nThe huge loss of life in World War II affected Ryūkyūan religion. There were no longer as many women available for spiritual positions, and the number of priestesses diminished dramatically. Other women were drawn away from the traditional religion by Christian and Buddhist missionaries. In terms of the government, the trends that began under Satsuma rule were continued through American occupation and Japanese rule.\n\nOne of the key features of the Okinawan society is an ambilineal kin group called \"weka\". This kin group consists of the couple and their produced offspring as well as the first and second cousins. For women, the status of these kinship group remains with her from when she was born to her death, which is different than kinship in the rest of Japan. Marriage does not replace a woman’s original family but instead adds a new lineage. Women have a double membership with her biological family and her husband’s family. The wife is accepted in the husband’s kin group when she becomes a mother. If the mother marries someone of different clan outside of the group, she is able to return to her ancestral land for all rituals.\n\nWhile some of the earliest accounts of the Ryukyuan people by Westerners suggested that it was a matriarchal society, there has not been sufficient evidence to support this. However, supporters of the goddess hypothesis and matriarchal studies scholars such as Heide Göttner-Abendroth still view ancient Okinawa as matriarchal. Göttner-Abendroth cites \"onarigami\" as evidence that the “ancient Japanese matriarchal culture” came from the south (147).\n\nAccording to the Omoro Sōshi, Shiji is sought from the other world in the skies or over the sea (Monica, 346). This enables women to protect the kind men, and men at war. In addition to the high status of being a wife, there is also the sister-brother alliances. All of the women of the Ryukyu islands were worshipped by their brothers as Onarigami. When the brother is away at sea they always take pieces of hair from his sister’s head, it holds a fundamental value of priestesses and goddesses in which the sister possessed to ensure protection of the voyage. The women in the Okinanawan society are thought to have the power to bless or curse a male’s kin. Although they practice a patrilineal descent, the women in the household still have the spiritual power as practiced by the Onarigami. The roles of these women in the household are to maintain the family structure as well as continuing on the ritual, such as praying on ancestral shrine. It is usually the eldest women in the household which oftentimes are the wife or mother that performed the ritual. Whereas the monthly rituals performed within the agrarian cycle are from the sisters of the household. These duties are to be fulfilled until death and then the roles are transferred to the next available female of the household (Monica, 353).\n\nIn Ryūkyūan religion, a \"kaminchu\" is a person with spiritual power (\"seji\"), the ability to sense, communicate with, and direct the power of \"kami\". They also have obligations to \"kami\". According to W.P. Lebra, a person is appointed \"kaminchu\" once it is clear that the person has spirit of high value. Additionally, these people typically come from families of already established \"kaminchu\" and are usually the first son or first daughter of that family. Although both men and women can have spiritual power, most \"kaminchu\" are women, in accordance with the \"onarigami\" emphasis on women’s spiritual superiority. \"Kaminchu\" can be further broken down into other religious specialist subgroups, specifically \"nūru\" and \"yuta\".\n\nNoro (or Nūru in the Okinawan language) refers to a chief priestess of a community. They are widely thought of as the embodiment of a particular kami and therefore hold a semi-divine status. Noro are thought, in old Ryukyu, to communicate directly with “Heaven” and that heaven communicated through her (Smits, 101). The noro are government officials and possibly could have helped in tax collection in some localities and were in charge of officiating all ceremonial affairs in the community (Smits, 115). Additionally, the noro may also be in charge of officiating ceremonial affairs in neighboring villages. Noro are, however, mainly in charge of garnering the favor of kami. These priestesses exclusively wear white kimono as a sign of their close relationship with kami, and no other villagers are allowed to wear this color kimono. The role was largely confined to women from certain families, and was passed on from generation to generation with the paraphernalia of sacred objects (Newman and Eng, 396).\nAccording to Newman and Eng, at one time noro were required to be celibate. However, these days, it is not a stringent requirement as some noro priestesses are married. Still, these married priestesses choose to abstain from sexual relationships with their husbands during the time of important events and rituals.\n\n\"Yuta\", female shamans or mediums, are \"kaminchu\" with the ability to see, hear, and be possessed by \"kami\" or spirits. Because of this, they are called upon when any mysterious or unfortunate events arise and are asked to provide the cause for such events. \"Yuta\" are not thought of as being the embodiment of a particular \"kami\" or spirit as they are ones who can see and communicate with all \"kami\" and spirits. With regards to \"kami\" and spirits, \"yuta\" are able to do spirit mediumship, curing, exorcism, prayer, retrocognition or discerning past events, prayer, and other rituals. As with \"nuru\", \"yuta\" are chosen by \"kami\". However, they will have no prior knowledge of their position as \"yuta\" before the \"kami\" sends them signs of their position. Also like the \"nuru\", \"yuta\" are more often than not women. There are some male \"yuta\" but they are not particularly trusted. This further places emphasis on the role of women in the community.\nOutside of the Ryukyuan islands, there has been a negative perception of all \"yuta\". Some American scholars have interpreted them as being malevolent magical practitioners or compared them to fortune tellers, and Japanese administrators even outlawed their operations at one point. The cause of this, in part, stemmed from the \"yuta\" undermining the authority of the \"nuru\". However, this prohibition proved to be unsuccessful as most common people that had supported \"yuta\" before prior to the prohibition continued to support them after.\n\nThe Tanetori Festival, is a celebration of \"onarigami\" in which the sister’s prayers and the brother’s gifts is an important part. The four days festival takes place in the tenth month of the Lunar calendar.\n\nThe religion is kept alive in varying degrees depending on the village and its inhabitants. Monica Wacker suggests in her article on \"onarigami\" that the \"nuru\", \"niigan\", and \"chikasa\" will continue to fulfill their religious duties, and that particularly colorful festivals like the Tanetori Festival will survive even if more serious aspects of the religion die out.\nTowards the end of the last century, there has been a revival of sorts of the idea of \"onarigami\" and its relation to the identity of women in Okinawa. Many modern women are deeply immersed in traditional religious activities. They know about their important historical roles as important religious figures and that through this, early Ryukyuan women were involved in the politics of men. Of note is the Unai Festival that has developed recently. The power of \"Unai\" has been used for political gains today, including electing a female representative into the city council of Naha in 1987.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52266305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52266305", "title": "Ptolemaic cult of Alexander the Great", "text": "Ptolemaic cult of Alexander the Great\n\nThe Ptolemaic cult of Alexander the Great was an imperial cult in ancient Egypt in the Hellenistic period (323–31 BC), promoted by the Ptolemaic dynasty. The core of the cult was the worship of the deified conqueror-king Alexander the Great, which eventually formed the basis for the ruler cult of the Ptolemies themselves. The head priest of the cult was the chief priest in the Ptolemaic Kingdom, and years were dated after the incumbents (eponymous priests).\n\nFollowing the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, his empire fell apart in the wars of the Diadochi (his generals, the Diadochi or \"Successors\"). One of them, Ptolemy, son of Lagos, secured rule of Egypt and made it the base for his own imperial ambitions. To legitimize his rule as Ptolemy I Soter ( BC), he relied, like the other Diadochi, not only on the right of conquest, but also on the supposed legitimate succession of Alexander. Not only did Ptolemy I portray himself as Alexander's closest friend in his historical work, but in 321 BC, he seized his body while Alexander's funeral procession was on its way to Macedon from Babylon, and brought it to the Egyptian capital at Memphis. This claim was particularly useful in Egypt, where Alexander had been greeted as liberator from the Achaemenid Empire (the so-called \"Twenty-seventh Dynasty\") and had been enthroned as Pharaoh and son of the deity Ammon-Ra, receiving divine honours. During his stay in Egypt, Alexander had also laid the foundations for the city of Alexandria, which became the main Greek colony and capital of the country.\n\nIn the new Ptolemaic Kingdom, the Hellenic element (Macedonians and people from Greek city-states), to which the Ptolemaic dynasty itself belonged, formed the ruling class which succeeded the native Egyptian Pharaohs. While sacred kingship had long been practised in Egypt and other eastern nations, it was almost unheard-of in the Greek world. Driven by his unprecedented conquests, in the last year of his life Alexander had demanded even from his Greek subjects to be treated as a living god (\"apotheōsis\"). This was accepted only reluctantly, and often rejected outright, by the Greek cities, but Alexander's prolific founding of cities alone secured for him a divine status there, since Greek cities traditionally rendered their founder () divine honours. When Ptolemy took over Egypt, he incorporated the heritage of Alexander into his own propaganda to support the claims of his own dynasty. As part of this effort, Alexander was elevated from a simple patron god of Alexandria to the status of a state god for the Greek populations of the entire Ptolemaic empire, even beyond the confines of Egypt.\n\nDuring the early Ptolemaic dynasty (), Ptolemy I began the construction of the Tomb of Alexander the Great in Alexandria (the , \"sēma\", ), and appointed a priest (, \"hiereus\") to conduct religious rites there. This office quickly advanced to become the highest priesthood in the Ptolemaic Kingdom, its prominence underscored by its eponymous character, i.e., each regnal year was named after the incumbent priest, and documents, whether in Koine Greek or Demotic Egyptian, where dated after him. The first priest of Alexander was no less a figure than Ptolemy I's brother Menelaos. The tenure lasted one year, but under Ptolemy I, the priests apparently held the post for longer tenures, while under his successors, with few exceptions, the tenures were reduced to a single year.\n\nUnder Ptolemy II Philadelphus ( BC), Alexander's body was brought to the \"sēma\", and, in contrast to the usual Greek custom of cremation, was entombed in a magnificent golden sarcophagus, which was eventually replaced by a transparent glass coffin to display his preserved body. Not only did the presence of Alexander's body in the Ptolemaic capital enhance the dynasty's prestige, but it also became one of the main attractions and pilgrimage sites in the ancient Mediterranean. Even Roman emperors made the journey to Alexandria to visit the great conqueror's tomb. \n\nThe Ptolemies assigned the deified Alexander a prominent place in the Greek pantheon, associating him with the Twelve Olympians like Zeus and Apollo. Accordingly, in documents Alexander was referred to simply by his name, as the epithet \"theos\" (\"god\") was regarded as superfluous.\n\nWhile Ptolemy I Soter founded the imperial cult of Alexander, his son and successor Ptolemy II completed its connection to the ruler cult around the reigning dynasty itself. The cult of the Ptolemies began in 283/2 BC, when the deceased parents of Ptolemy II were deified as the \"Saviour Gods\" (θεοὶ σωτῆρες, \"theoi sōtēres\"). Statues of the deified couple were installed in the Temple of Alexander, and the priest of the Alexander cult took over the rites for the deified Ptolemies as well. With this gesture, the Ptolemies underlined the superior position of Alexander, and their own subordination to him as \"temple-sharing gods\" (, \"synnanoi theoi\"). Alexander remained the main recipient of rituals and sacrifices, with the Ptolemies only partaking in them.\n\nThe elevation of Alexander over the Ptolemies, and their connection to him, was further deepened through the expansion of the cult. Thus in 269 BC, the female priestly office of \"basket bearer\" (\"kanēphóros\") for the \"Sibling Goddess\" (\"thea adelphos\") Arsinoe II was established, followed in 211 BC by the \"prize-bearer\" priestess (\"athlophoros\") in honour of the \"Benefactor Goddess\" (\"thea euergetis\"), Berenice II, and in 199 BC by a priestess for the \"Father-Loving Goddess\" (\"thea philopatōr\"), Arsinoe III. All these priesthoods were subordinate to the priest of Alexander.\n\nCleopatra III added three further female priesthoods for her own personal cult as \"Benefactor and Mother-Loving Goddess\" (\"thea euergetis philometōr\"): the \"sacred foal\" (\"hieros pōlos\"), the \"crown bearer\" (\"stephanēphoros\"), and the \"light bearer\" (\"phōsphoros\").\n\nThe concept of \"temple-sharing gods\" was underlined under Ptolemy IV Philopator ( BC), who translated the remains of the Ptolemies and their consorts—unlike Alexander, they had been cremated and kept in urns—to the \"sēma\".\n\nPtolemy, son of Castor, is the last priest of Alexander known by name, before the position was merged into the royal office. Since the priesthood of Alexander is first attested in the royal titulature in the second year of the joint reign of Ptolemy IX and Cleopatra III (116/115 BC), it is unclear whether the merge of the offices took place in the last two years of Ptolemy VII's rule, or with the accession of his successors. It is possible that the merger was done at the initiative of Ptolemy IX, as part of an effort to emphasize his precedence over his co-ruling mother, Cleopatra III. As such, the office changed its role and character, from an eponymous priesthood to a propaganda tool: unlike the royal office, which was increasingly shared among siblings or other family members from the early 2nd century BC on, the priesthood of Alexander was indivisible. This must have appealed to Ptolemy IX, eager to set himself apart from his mother, who he hated and who had begun her own priestly cult around her own person.\n\nThis new role of the priesthood of Alexander can be traced in later reigns as well. In the first months of 112/111 BC, an ordinary citizen, Artemidorus, occupied the office. He was probably a partisan of Cleopatra III, who had succeeded to temporarily evict her son from Alexandria. As women could not occupy a supreme priesthood in the Greek world, she had to content herself with placing one of her supporters in the post, as a public sign of her new dominance. After Artemidorus, however, the name of Ptolemy IX was subsequently added in the papyrus, which means that he managed to return to Alexandria in the same year.\n\nIn 107 BC, Cleopatra III managed to expel Ptolemy IX for good from Alexandria, and raised her second son, Ptolemy X, to the throne as her co-ruler and priest of Alexander. As the inter-dynastic rivalry continued, however, in 105 BC she finally decided to assume the priesthood herself, to underline her precedence. Cleopatra probably intended this arrangement to be permanent, but her blatant violation of Greek norms in assuming the priesthood must have damaged her image among the Greeks. The last years of her reign were taken up with her persistent conflict with Ptolemy IX, until she died in 101 BC, probably following an assassination attempt by Ptolemy IX, whereupon Ptolemy X became sole ruler. The priestly and royal offices remained united under Ptolemy X and his successors, although the priestly title was rarely mentioned in the papyri, as the loss of its eponymous character rendered it irrelevant for dating purposes.\n\n\n\n"}

Vankiya is located which is located 28 km far, north-easterly to Una town, about 38km south-easterly to Tulsishyam and 35km west of Rajula.\n\nThere is another set of Sana Buddhist Caves in Veraval - Somnath region, which is also located in the newly former Gir Somnath district. These caves are simply called as ancient Buddhist caves of Prabhas Patan, and not so much as Sana caves. Nonetheless, information about these caves has gotten mixed up in the media. Sana Caves of Prabhas Patanare located about 7 km south-east of Vearval and 2km north-east of Somnath Mahadev mandir. Do not confuse the caves in Prabhas Patan with the majestic Shana Dungar Buddhist Caves at Vankiya, which are located about 105 km far, easterly from this place. \n\nThe rock cut carving includes 62 caves spread over the hill consisting stupas, chaityas, pillows and benches. The halls of few caves are dome-shaped and pillared. According to historians, the construction of caves had started by the 2nd century BC in Western India. Other historians have claimed that the architecture was constructed around the 1st century CE. A few historians have claimed that it is hard to trace the date of the caves' architecture.\n\nSana Caves of Junagadh is a group of about 62 rock shelters which were carved out of soft rock. These caves were created in the period ranging between 1st century BC and 1st century AD and provided shelter to monks looking for refuge during the monsoons. Sana Caves are undoubtedly the oldest Buddhist caves in western India and boasts of rock cut pillars, stupas, benches, chaityas, viharas, a pillared hall and various domes. The shelters have been carved at various levels on and around a hillock. Some of the best archaeological symbols representing the preaching Buddhism can be seen at Sana Caves.\n\nThe largest cave, Cave 2, is named Bhima-ni-Cori and is considered to be similar to Ebhala- Mandapa, which is located at Talaja. This cave is approximately 21 meters in depth and has a width of 18.3 meters. The ceiling is 5.3 meters high and provides ample space to tourists wishing to walk through them. It also has six pillars which are located between the pilasters in front. One of the pillars depicts unique features of a concave neck between the drum and the dome.\n\nCave 26 and Cave 13 are different from the others. They have long verandahs with simple pillars resting on raised basements. These function as a support system for the beams above. The monasteries are also exquisitely designed with pillared verandahs which usually contain up to 4 cells at the back. The presence of benches around the hall is also an important feature of these caves.\n\nThe layout of Cave 48 is very different from the rest. It contains two halls of different dimensions. These halls contain benches around their perimeter. Most of the caves were carved at different heights and levels in the spur and could be approached by simple stairs cut into the rock. The presence of multiple tanks in this group of caves bears evidence to the importance given to water harvesting. With rock cut walls present on three sides and an oblong mouth on the other, these tanks were perfect for retaining water during the bleaker seasons. This architectural design has also been noticed in the Kanheri caves near Mumbai in Maharashtra.\n\nThese caves are distinctive in nature and are marked by their austere and simplistic designs. Most tourists notice a complete absence of engravings and ornate carvings—which are present in most of the other Buddhist caves in Gujarat. The caves also contain three chaitya grihas, which possess apsidal walls and flat ceilings. These caves are oft visited by tourists looking for deeper insights into the art forms and architectural designs of the Buddhist period. The caves are a focal point of interest for scholars, researchers and students too. A walk through Sana Caves takes you to exciting viharas, which refers to pillared verandahs containing one or two cells. These cells have rock cut benches inside them that were probably used for resting, sitting or taking shelter during the rains. Sana Caves is also known for its scenic beauty and provides a retreat to tourists wishing to enjoy the beauty and charm of the topographical landscapes beyond.\n\nFootprints of Buddhism in Gujarat can be traced back to 270 BC. This was the period when Ashoka the Great ruled Saurashtra and was striving to spread the teachings and philosophy of Gautam Buddha across his empire. The ideology of Buddhism started gaining roots in various places in Gujarat, including Junagadh, Somnath, Velavar and the mouth of the River Indus—along with a host of other far flung areas in the state. The accounts written by Chinese scholars and travelers of the likes of Hiuen Tsiang and I-Tsing bear testimony to the spread of Buddhism in these parts of the world.\n\nBuddhism started spreading across the nation and Gujarat in particular between the periods 27 B.C. to 470 A.D. Various archaeological remains and historical facts point to the development of embellishments and shelters in and around the areas of Somnath and Vadnagar. Sana Caves was the most prominent amongst them. These caves were located in the precincts of the Sana Hill, which is located 25 km north-east of Una and witnessed the rise and fall of a once flourishing monastery. With several water tanks and shelters to their credit, Sana Caves were constructed on the three slopes of an elevated plateau sloping down to the waters of River Rupen on the western face of the elevation.\n\nBuddhist caves of Prabhas Patan are simple in design and only two in number. These two caves are believed to a part of Buddhist vihara from the 3rd and 4th century AD. Each is about 8.7 m x 9.45 m, and 2.5 m high with four square pillars. An opening connects them at the rear. The eastern cave has an antechamber. Except for a row of niches on the outside there is no ornamentation. Buddhism, under Kshatrapa patronage was prevalent in the region during the early centuries of the Christian era. \n"}

He was given an audience before Pope Clement VII, having gained his favor, as well as that of some Judeophile cardinals at Rome. He was said to have predicted a certain flood which inundated Rome and various other places. After his many cabalistic and other strange experiments, Molcho felt justified in proclaiming himself the Messiah, or his precursor.\n\nIn company with David Reubeni, his mentor, he went in 1532 to Ratisbon, where the emperor Charles V was holding a \"diet\". On this occasion, Molcho carried a flag with the Hebrew word \"Maccabi\", the four letters מכבי which also signify an abbreviation for Exodus 15:11 \"Who among the mighty is like unto God?\". The emperor had both Molcho and Reubeni arrested and took them back to Italy. In Mantua an ecclesiastical court sentenced Molcho to death by fire. At the stake, it is claimed the emperor offered to pardon him on condition that he return to the Catholic Church, but Molcho refused, asking for a martyr's death (5th of Tevet 5290 anno mundi, or what was \"anno\" 1530 CE). His mentor, David Reubeni, was exiled to Spain, where later he died.\n\n\n\n"}

His grandfather, Joseph Hirsch Weiss, was Chief Rabbi of a small town near Budapest. His father, Aaron Wise, earned a PhD and ordination in Europe, and emigrated to the United States to serve as rabbi of Congregation Baith Israel Anshei Emes in Brooklyn, New York. Wise's maternal grandfather, Móric Fischer de Farkasházy, created the Herend Porcelain Company. When Wise's father sought to unionize the company, Moric gave the family one-way tickets to New York.\n\nWise immigrated to New York as an infant with his family. His father became rabbi of Rodeph Sholom, a Manhattan Conservative congregation of wealthy German Jews.\n\nWise studied at the College of the City of New York, Columbia College (B.A. 1892), and Columbia University (PhD 1901), and later pursued rabbinical studies under rabbis Richard J. H. Gottheil, Kohut, Gersoni, Joffe, and Margolis. In 1933, Wise received an L.H.D. from Bates College.\n\nIn 1893, Wise was appointed assistant rabbi of Congregation B'nai Jeshurun, New York City, whose senior rabbi was Henry S. Jacobs. Later in the same year, Wise became the senior rabbi of the same congregation. In 1900, he launched his career as the rabbi of Congregation Beth Israel in Portland, Oregon. Typical of the activists of the Progressive Era, he attacked \"many of the social and political ills of contemporary America.\" In 1906, concerning another rabbinical appointment, Wise made a major break with the established Reform movement over the \"question whether the pulpit shall be free or whether the pulpit shall not be free, and, by reason of its loss of freedom, reft of its power for good\"; in 1907 he established his Free Synagogue, starting the \"free Synagogue\" movement.\n\nWise was an early supporter of Zionism, and his support for, and commitment to Political Zionism was very atypical of Reform Judaism, which was historically and decidedly non-Zionist since the Pittsburgh Platform in 1885. He was a founder of the New York Federation of Zionist Societies in 1897, which led in the formation of the national Federation of American Zionists (FAZ), a forerunner of the Zionist Organization of America. At the Second Zionist Congress (Basel, 1898), he was a delegate and secretary for the English language. Wise served as honorary secretary of FAZ, in close cooperation with Theodor Herzl until the latter's death in 1904.\n\nWise, joining U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, Felix Frankfurter, and others laid the groundwork for a democratically elected nationwide organization of 'ardently Zionist' Jews, 'to represent Jews as a group and not as individuals'. In 1918, following national elections, this Jewish community convened the first American Jewish Congress in Philadelphia's historic Independence Hall.\n\nIn 1938, as president of the American Jewish Congress, Wise stated that adoption of the Alaska proposal in the Slattery Report would deliver \"a wrong and hurtful impression ... that Jews are taking over some part of the country for settlement.\"\n\nEinstein found Wise's mixture of enlightened views and committed Zionism most agreeable, and this sealed their friendship when Einstein moved to the US. In a tribute to Wise on his 60th birthday, Einstein said \"Above all, what I admire in him is his bold activity toward building the self-respect of the Jewish people, combined with profound tolerance and penetrating understanding of everything human.\"\n\nDuring the trial of sociologist Dr. Jerome Davis, Wise stated, based on more than 30 years of acquaintance, that Davis had \"never, never\" been sympathetic to communism.\n\nIn 1902 Wise officiated as first vice-president of the Oregon State Conference of Charities and Correction. In 1903 he was appointed Commissioner of Child Labor for the State of Oregon, and founded the Peoples' Forum of Oregon. These activities initiated a lifelong commitment to social justice, stemming from his embrace of a Jewish equivalent of the Social Gospel movement in Christianity.\n\nIn 1914 Wise co-founded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In \"A History of Jews in America\" historian Howard Sachar wrote, \"In 1914, Professor Emeritus Joel Spingarn of Columbia University became chairman of the NAACP and recruited for its board such Jewish leaders as Jacob Schiff, Jacob Billikopf, and Rabbi Stephen Wise.\" Other Jewish co-founders included Julius Rosenwald, Lillian Wald, and Rabbi Emil G. Hirsch.\n\nIn 1922 Wise founded the Jewish Institute of Religion, an educational center in New York City to train rabbis in Reform Judaism. It was merged into the Hebrew Union College a year after his death. In 1922 Wise was one of the founding trustees of the Palestine Endowment Funds, Inc., along with Julian Mack.\n\nWhen the Federation of American Zionists (FAZ) was originally established, Wise was appointed the position secretary. After the organization transformed into the Zionist Organization of America, Rabbi Wise fulfilled positions as both president and vice president during his lifetime.\n\nWise was a close friend of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who turned to Wise for advice on issues concerning the Jewish community in the United States. In addition, Wise had also acted a liaison to previous President Wilson.\n\nAt the 1924 Democratic National Convention, he was a delegate from New York; at the opening of the sixth session on June 28, 1924, he offered the invocation.\n\nIn 1925 Wise became chairman of Keren Hayesod, while continuing efforts to bring the Reform movement around to a pro-Zionist stance. With the rise to power of Adolf Hitler's regime, Wise took the position that public opinion in the United States and elsewhere should be rallied against the Nazis. He used his influence with President Roosevelt both in this area as well as on the Zionist question.\n\nIn 1933 while acting as honorary president of the American Jewish Congress, Wise led efforts for a Jewish Boycott of Germany. He stated \"The time for prudence and caution is past. We must speak up like men. How can we ask our Christian friends to lift their voices in protest against the wrongs suffered by Jews if we keep silent? What is happening in Germany today may happen tomorrow in any other land on earth unless it is challenged and rebuked. It is not the German Jews who are being attacked. It is the Jews\". Urged by Wise to protest to the German government, U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull issued a mild statement to the American ambassador to Berlin complaining that \"unfortunate incidents have indeed occurred and the whole world joins in regretting them.\"\n\nWise, along with Leo Motzkin and Nahum Goldmann, encouraged the creation in August 1936 of the World Jewish Congress in order to create a broader representative body to fight Nazism. Wise served as founding president of the World Jewish Congress president until his death in 1949. He was succeeded by his friend Nahum Goldmann.\n\nOn November 24, 1942, after being informed by U.S. Under-secretary of State Sumner Welles, Wise held a press conference in Washington, D.C. and announced that the Nazis had a plan for the extermination of all European Jews, and had already killed 2 million; it didn't make front-page news. The information was based on the Riegner Telegram, a message sent to Wise in August 1942 by Gerhart M Riegner, then representative of the World Jewish Congress in Geneva, informing the Allies about the so-called \"Final Solution of the Jewish question\", the German plan to exterminate the European Jews, for the first time. Together with Nahum Goldmann, Wise spread the information about the ongoing genocide to Sweden and other countries by telegram.\n\nWise was an ardent opponent of plans to create a Jewish community in Suriname. In a letter to Keren Hayesod emissary Ida Silverman he wrote, \"I personally believe, that Steinberg needs to be lynched or hanged and quartered, if that would make his lamented demise more certain.\" Isaac Nachman Steinberg being the co-founder of the Freeland League, a territorialist organization that was leading negotiations with the Surinamese government.\n\nDuring the war years, Wise was elected co-chair of the American Zionist Emergency Council, a forerunner of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.\n\nWise translated \"The Improvement of the Moral Qualities\", an ethical treatise of the eleventh century by Solomon ibn Gabirol (New York, 1902) from the original Arabic, and wrote \"The Beth Israel Pulpit\", among other works. He was invited to deliver the annual Charles P. Steinmetz Memorial Lecture at Union College in 1944.\n\nWise has been criticized by Dr. David Kranzler for his alleged failure to recognize the Holocaust prior to American entry into World War II, the allegation that he dismissed early reports of the Final Solution as propaganda and obstruction of rescue.\n\nIn his book \"Holocaust Victims Accuse\", Moshe Shonfeld asserts that Wise prevented the shipment of food packages from American Jews to German-occupied Poland due to fear that it would be interpreted by the Allies as giving aid to the enemy. This allegation is also made by historian Saul Friedländer, who writes: \"In the spring of 1941 Rabbi Wise had decided to impose a complete embargo on all aid sent to Jews in occupied countries, in compliance with the U.S. government's economic boycott of the Axis powers (whereby every food package was seen as direct or indirect assistance to the enemy)... Strict orders were given to World Jewish Congress representatives in Europe to halt forthwith any shipment of packages to the ghettos, despite the fact that these packages did usually reach their destination, the Jewish Self-Help Association in Warsaw. 'All these operations with and through Poland must cease at once,' Wise cabled to Congress delegates in London and Geneva, 'and at once in English means AT ONCE, not in the future.'\"\n\nIn their book \"A Race Against Death: Peter Bergson, America, and the Holocaust\", authors David Wyman and Rafael Medoff make a further allegation that Wise displayed a lack of leadership that hindered the Holocaust rescue attempts of others (mainly the Bergson Group's). He also attempted to squelch showing and broadcast of the pageant \"We Will Never Die\", which sought to bring attention to the plight of Jews in Europe.\n\nWise married Louise Waterman. The couple had two children: writer James Wise (born 1901); and judge Justine Wise Polier (1903-1987).\n\nWise died on April 19, 1949, in New York City, aged 75. He is interred in an unmarked mausoleum in Westchester Hills Cemetery located in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.\n\nThe Stephen Wise Free Synagogue, which he founded in 1907 and served as Rabbi until his death, is named after him, as is Stephen S. Wise Temple in Los Angeles, which was founded by Rabbi Isaiah Zeldin in 1964. A street is named after him in Jerusalem next to the Israel Museum.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56521052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56521052", "title": "Sun of Unclouded Righteousness", "text": "Sun of Unclouded Righteousness\n\n\"Sun of Unclouded Righteousness\" is a little-known 1758 Christian hymn written by Charles Wesley, the brother of John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. It was written as an intercessory hymn praying for the salvation of Muslims and calls for their conversion to Christianity. It had fallen out of use by around 1880.\n\nCharles Wesley had a history of encouraging people to pray for the salvation of a variety of people. He wrote \"Sun of Unclouded Righteousness\" with the subtitle of \"For the Turks\" or \"For the Mahometans\". It was first published in 1758 in his \"Hymns of Intercession for All Mankind\" hymnal. It was intended as a prayer for salvation of Muslims and reflected the prevalent negative view of Islam promoted by Humphrey Prideaux in Great Britain at the time. It was written to also accompany the Collect for Good Friday in the Church of England's \"Book of Common Prayer\". The hymn's title was based upon Malachi 4:2 where the Messiah, believed to be referring to Jesus by Christians, was called the \"Sun of Righteousness\".\n\nCharles and his brother John Wesley had read Prideaux's work on early Islam while in Paris, and John noted that no opponents of Christianity had hurt it as much as Muhammad during the Early Muslim conquests. The hymn refers to that conquest in the line, \"The smoke of the infernal cave,/Which half the Christian world o’erspread\"; the \"cave\" mentioned there is Hira, where Islam teaches that Mohammed received revelation. Muhammad is referred to in the hymn as \"that Imposter\" and \"that Arab Thief\". Later versions of the third verse were changed to \"E'en now the Moslem fiend expel, And chase his doctrine back to hell\". \n\nThe hymn also engaged in polemics with regard to theological controversies of its day, namely the conflict between John Taylor's Unitarianism and Christians who held a trinitarian universalism perspective. The fourth stanza had always expressed the trinitarian universalism perspective; earlier versions of the third stanza ended with \"The Unitarian fiend expel/And chase his doctrine back to hell\" referring to Islam and its teaching, but also more explicitly to this controversy. The hymn was, in the words of a commenter on it, \"an implicit challenge\" to send missions to those regions.\n\n\"Sun of Unclouded Righteousness\" largely stopped being published in hymnals around 1875. However it was still published in the 1879 \"Methodist Hymnal\". Despite Wesley's intent for it as a prayer for unbelievers, the hymn characterizes Islam negatively and expresses the stereotype of Arabs as, in the words of one commenter on the hymn, \"militaristic marauders\"; these elements make the hymn an embarrassment to contemporary Christians interested in inter-religious dialogue.\n\nThe original lyrics as written by Wesley:\n"}

According to Plutarch's \"Life of Romulus\", the keeper of the Temple of Hercules challenged the hero to a game of dice with Hercules to receive a night with a beautiful woman and a fine spread and the god to provide the temple keeper with a valuable gift if the keeper was successful.\n\nAs Hercules won the contest, the keeper procured the services of Acca Larentia for the night and provided a fine supper. In the morning, Hercules suggested that she approach the first man she met on leaving the temple. Tarutius was the man whom she met and the couple ended up marrying. Tarutius was a wealthy, older man with a large estate and is often believed to be an Etruscan.\n\nTarutius died shortly after their marriage, leaving no children. Acca Larentia inherited the estate and, when she disappeared, her will was found devoting the estate to Rome. This version is considered to be the basis for the full legal entitlement of areas claimed by Rome.\n\nAugustine of Hippo referred to the legend in his book \"The City of God\" as an example of how the pagan gods are supposed to have delighted in human sensual pleasures. In St. Augustine's version, Tarutius is held to be a younger man who Acca Larentia meets after spending the night with Hercules in a dream. Tarutius is held to have had kept Acca Larentia as his mistress for many years, leaving his estate to her on his death. She in turn leaves the estate to Rome in her will which is found when she mysteriously disappears.\n\n"}

The song was never released as a single, but was the first song of the album to be heard by the public. It was one of Metallica's first original releases to be tuned half a step down.\n\nComposer and lyricist James Hetfield described the song as \"very nice... Slow, heavy and ugly.\" Lead guitarist Kirk Hammett recalls the inception of his solo in the song: \"I had this whole thing worked out, but it didn't fit because the lead was too bluesy for the song, which is characterized by real heavy riffing and chording.\" According to Hammett, he and producer Bob Rock worked out his guitar solo on the song. Together they composed a melody to which Hammett wanted to add harmony. The producer suggested that this would make the song sound too \"pretty\", and instead recommended playing the melody an octave higher. The final guitar solo was put together from over a dozen performances by the guitarist during the recording of the album. Hammett calls the resulting work one of his favorite solos on the album.\n\nThe central theme of the song is faith and human reliance on it, and of unrewarded belief in a God that fails to heal. The lyrics and song material were inspired by Hetfield's anguish on the circumstances surrounding his mother's death. She died of cancer after refusing medical attention, solely relying on her belief in God to heal her. Hetfield felt that had she not followed her Christian Science beliefs, she could have survived.\n\nBaylor University Assistant Professor of Religion, Paul Martens points out that the song has been admired by some anti-religious groups, such as the websites \"Alabama Atheist\" and \"The Secular Web\". Martens notes, however, that Hetfield does not celebrate God's failure in the song, but instead blames God, through his mother's faith and death, for contributing to the meaninglessness of life.\n\nFinntroll covered this song and its included on the limited edition of Nifelvind. In 2012, Black Spiders covered this song for the Kerrang! album Black Album Covered.\n\nThe song was first played on the first date of the \"Shit Hits the Sheds\" tour (May 30, 1994). It was played in E flat tuning from 1994 to 2006 - since 2010, the song has been played in D standard tuning. It received frequent live performance during the 2012 European Black Album Tour when it was played as a part of the \"Black Album\".\n"}

After his mandatory military service in the Israel Defense Forces he worked in finance in New York City. In 1994, Mizrachi began dedicating himself to Orthodox Judaism outreach, and in 1997, Mizrachi left his professional career and began learning and teaching Torah at Yeshivat Ohr Yisrael in Monsey.\n\nMizrachi discussed his Semikhah (rabbinical ordination) credentials in a January 9, 2016 radio interview with Zev Brenner. When asked if he has Semikhah, Mizrachi stated that he lacks such Semikhah which involves testing and is common among Synagogue rabbis. However, Mizrachi went on to explain that he has received certification in recognition of his Torah background by Rabbi Eliyahu Ben Haim qualifying him to be a rabbi.\n\nMizrachi founded a Kiruv organization in 1995. The organization provides free DVDs, Audio CDs, and MP3 CDs, sponsored by donors. As of 2013, the organization has handed out thousands of these audio and video disks. Mizrachi offers an extended ethical audio and video lecture series, called \"The Path of the Just\", based on the musar text Mesillat Yesharim composed by Moshe Chaim Luzzatto.\n\nIn 2001 Mizrachi opened a Kolel and a Yeshiva in Alfandari Street, Jerusalem.\n\nIn 2002 a movie called \"Divine Information\" was produced by Mizrahi and Yuval Ovadia. Two years later, in 2004, Mizrachi launched the \"DivineInformation.com\" website posting many of his video and audio lectures.\n\nIn early 2014, before a lecture tour in London, concern was expressed about statements by Mizrachi in his previous lectures relating to the behaviour of secular and religious Jews during the Holocaust suggesting that Down's Syndrome and autism are \"punishments for sins committed in a previous life\" and among others. Mizrachi was criticized for his views while he explicitly maintains are \"Torah sourced.\" His views also include lectures using Bible Codes to \"explain\" the Holocaust. As a result, at least one of his planned lectures in London was initially cancelled.\n\nIn December 2015, in one of his lectures, Mizrahi claimed that it is possible that only one million Jews died in The Holocaust as opposed to the well accepted figure of 6 million, since many of them were not Jewish according to Jewish law which requires a person's mother to be Jewish. Mizrahi was criticized by academics and Jewish leaders including Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, who said that he \"made up history to suit an agenda.\" He was also criticized by Berel Wein who stated that \"It is too damaging a matter to be left unanswered and unrefuted.\" Later Mizrahi issued an apology. According to The Times, Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis has spoken out against the travel plans of this \"Jewish hate preacher\"; and the UK Home Office has suggested that the Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, was considering banning Mizrahi should he apply to visit Britain.\n\nA meeting with Dr. Katz and Rabbi Mizrachi concluded the controversy about the holocaust, when Rabbi Mizrachi met with the holocaust survivor. Rav Mizrachi publicly apologized to Dr. Katz, the other Jewish Nation survivors, and victims of the holocaust. Dr. katz told Rav Mizrachi that his apology was accepted chiefly because of the Rabbi's quick response to his invitation.\n\nIn December 2016, 16 prominent US rabbis issued an open letter about Mizrachi. They said that Mizrachi \"reduce[s] complex issues to simplistic and misleading sound bites,\" and his assertions are \"objectionable, and even dangerous.\" The letter continued that institutions should be more \"discerning\" with the guests they invite.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in Sarajevo on the 16 February 1919 and was led by Mehmed Spaho. The party was a successor of Muslimanska Narodna Organizacija (Muslim National Organization), a conservative Bosniak party founded in 1906 during the Austro-Hungarian era. The Muslim National Organization was itself a successor of the conservative Bosniak \"Movement for waqf and educational autonomy\" (Pokret za vakufsko-mearifsku autonomiju) that goes back to 1887. In election campaigns the JMO did mobilize on religious slogans rather than Bosniak nationality, calling failure of Muslims to vote for the party as a sin. The party had considerable influence in Islamic religious institutions, and JMO came to dominate the political life in Bosnia. The party appealed to Muslims throughout Yugoslavia, urging them not to migrate to Turkey.\n\nIn 1921 JMO aligned itself with the governing Serbian parties. JMO wanted to achieve territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina and demanded religious autonomy as well as right for the Sharia law. Their demands were given to the Constitutional Assembly and as a compromise those demands were accepted and incorporated in the Vidovdan Constitution under the so-called \"Turkish Paragraph\". The support of JMO was important to pass the new constitution. This alliance became short-lived though. In 1922 a new Muslim party, Yugoslav Muslim People's Organization (JMNO), was formed and overtook the role as the Muslim ally of the Serbian parties. JMNO did however fail to attract any major section of the JMO vote-bank. In 1923 the party founded the cultural organization \"Narodna Uzdanica\".\n\nJMO entered into a short-lived alliance with the Slovenian People's Party and the Croatian Republican Peasant Party. After the alliance broke down in 1925, JMO found itself politically isolated and came under attack from Serbian paramilitaries. At one time the paramilitaries attempted to kill Spaho.\n\nIn 1927 the party suffered some setback in the election. After the election JMO joined a Serbian-led government. At this time the profile of JMO shifted, as it began to stress that it was a Bosnian party, rather than Muslim or Yugoslav.\n\nJMO was banned by Alexander I, along with other parties. Mehmed Spaho later rebuilt the JMO and joined Milan Stojadinović’s Serbian-dominated government in 1937. He resigned in 1939 to protest the creation of the banovina of Croatia: he died a few months later and was succeeded as party chairman by Džafer Kulenović. The JMO dominated Bosnian politics until 1941. After the invasion of Yugoslavia by Axis powers, Ante Pavelić's quisling Croatian regime received support from several JMO leaders, among whom Džafer Kulenović who served as vice-president. Other JMO members supported the Partisans instead ; one JMO senator participated to the first AVNOJ session in 1942.\n\nElections results in Yugoslavia, 1920-1927\n"}
