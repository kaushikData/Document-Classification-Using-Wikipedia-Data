{"id": "6207142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6207142", "title": "Atheism and religion", "text": "Atheism and religion\n\nSome movements or sects within traditionally monotheistic or polytheistic religions recognize that it is possible to practice religious faith, spirituality and adherence to tenets without a belief in deities. People with what would be considered religious or spiritual belief in a supernatural controlling power are defined by some as adherents to a religion; the argument that atheism is a religion has been described as a contradiction in terms.\n\nIn general, formulations of Jewish principles of faith require a belief in God (represented by Judaism's paramount prayer, the Shema). In many modern Jewish religious movements, rabbis have generally considered the behavior of a Jew to be the determining factor in whether or not one is considered an adherent of Judaism. Within these movements it is often recognized that it is possible for a Jew to strictly practice Judaism as a faith, while at the same time being an agnostic or atheist. Reconstructionist Judaism does not require any belief in a deity, and certain popular Reform prayer books, such as \"Gates of Prayer\", offer some services without mention of God. Jewish atheists who practice Humanistic Judaism embrace Jewish culture and history, rather than belief in a supernatural god, as the sources of their Jewish identity. One study found that only 48% of self-identified Jews believe in God.\n\nRabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, first Chief Rabbi of the Jewish community in Palestine, held that atheists were not actually denying God: rather, they were denying one of man's many images of God. Since any man-made image of God can be considered an idol, Kook held that, in practice, one could consider atheists as helping true religion burn away false images of God, thus in the end serving the purpose of true monotheism.\n\nHigh rates of atheism have been found among self-identified Christians in the United States. For example, 10% of self-identified Protestants and 21% of self-identified Roman Catholics were found to be atheists in a Harris Interactive survey from 2003.\n\nThere is no single Christian approach toward atheism. The approach taken varies between Christian denominations, and Christian ministers may intelligently distinguish an individual's claims of atheism from other nominal states of personal perspective, such as plain disbelief, an adherence to science, a misunderstanding of the nature of religious belief, or a disdain for organized religion in general.\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church makes this explicit. While it identifies atheism as a violation of the First Commandment, calling it \"a sin against the virtue of religion\", it is careful to acknowledge that atheism may be motivated by virtuous or moral considerations, and admonishes the followers of Roman Catholicism to focus on their own role in encouraging atheism by their religious or moral shortcomings:\n\nA famous idiosyncratic atheist belief is that of Thomas J. J. Altizer. His book \"The Gospel of Christian Atheism\" (1967) proclaims the highly unusual view that God has literally died, or self-annihilated. According to Altizer, this is nevertheless \"a Christian confession of faith\". Making clear the difference between his position and that of both Nietzsche's notion of the death of God and the stance of theological non-realists, Altizer says, \"To confess the death of God is to speak of an actual and real event, not perhaps an event occurring in a single moment of time or history, but notwithstanding this reservation an event that has actually happened both in a cosmic and in a historical sense.\"\n\nA 2001 survey by \"Faith Communities Today\" found that 18% of Unitarian Universalists (UU) consider themselves to be atheists, with 54% considering themselves humanist. According to this study 16% of UUs consider themselves Buddhist, 13% Christian, and 13% Pagan.\n\nIn Islam, atheists are categorized as \"kafir\" (), a term that is also used to describe polytheists (\"shirk\"), and that translates roughly as \"denier\" or \"concealer\". \"Kafir\" carries connotations of blasphemy and disconnection from the Islamic community. In Arabic, \"atheism\" is generally translated \"ilhad\" (), although this also means \"heresy\".\n\nThe Quran is silent on the punishment for apostasy, though not the subject itself. The Quran speaks repeatedly of people going back to unbelief after believing, and gives advice on dealing with \"hypocrites\":\nSura 9:73,74 \n\nThe Hadith expound upon dealing with apostates:\n\nThe Qur'an refers to atheism in this verse:\nThe term commonly used for atheists is \"Dahriyyah\" from the Arabic word for \"time\" in a verse which speaks of people \"who says that our death and Decimation are caused only by the passing of time\". (in aljathiah,) 24)\n\n[045:024] And they say: \"There is nothing but our life of this world, we die and we live and nothing destroys us except Ad-Dahr (time).\" And they have no knowledge of it, they only conjecture.\n\nOther relevant Hadithic verses include Bukhari, volume 9, #58, 64, 271.\n\nMuslims are not at liberty to change their religion or become atheists. Atheists in Islamic countries and communities frequently conceal their non-belief (as do people with other condemned qualities, such as homosexuality).\n\nIn recent times, capital punishment for atheism is almost never applied, and convicted atheists may be jailed with an opportunity to recant or be stripped of certain civil rights. Religiosity in the Arab world is seen to be essential for morality and atheism is widely associated with immorality. Religious attitudes grew more conservative since the 1980s, compared to the preceding decades when secular socialism was politically dominant. Nonetheless, atheism is tolerated if it is not conspicuous and a worldwide support network for ex-Muslims has existed since 2007. Some commentators believe that the number of undeclared atheists in the Arab world is substantial. According to 2012 WIN/Gallup poll of Saudi citizens, 5 percent of Saudis identify as \"convinced atheists\", the same percentage as in the U.S.\n\nThe increasingly large ex-Muslim communities in the Western world that adhere to no religion have been well documented. A 2007 Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) report argued that some Muslim population projections are overestimated, as they assume that all descendants of Muslims will become Muslims even in cases of mixed parenthood. Equally, Darren E. Sherkat questioned in \"Foreign Affairs\" whether some of the Muslim growth projections are accurate as they do not take into account the increasing number of non-religious Muslims. Quantitative research is lacking, but he believes the European trend mirrors the American: data from the General Social Survey in the United States show that 32 percent of those raised Muslim no longer embrace Islam in adulthood, and 18 percent hold no religious identification. Studies show that about half of the 4.2 million persons from Muslim background in Germany no longer embrace Islam in adulthood.\n\nAtheism is often considered acceptable within Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism.\n\nAtheism is a valid form of belief in Hinduism. Certain Hindu schools however view the path of the atheist as a very difficult to follow in matters of spirituality.\n\nAmong the six fundamental \"Astika\" schools of Hindu philosophy, the Samkhya do not accept God and the early Mimamsa also rejected the notion of God. Samkhya lacks the notion of a 'higher being' that is the ground of all existence. It proposes a thoroughly dualistic understanding of the cosmos, in which two parallel realities (Purusha, the spiritual, and Prakriti, the physical) coexist and the aim of life is the gaining of liberating self-knowledge of the Purusha. Here, no God (better stated \"theos\") is present, yet Ultimate Reality in the form of the Purusha exists.\n\nCārvāka (also \"Charvaka\") was a materialist and atheist school of thought in India, which is now known principally from fragments cited by its Astika and Buddhist opponents. The proper aim of a Cārvākan, according to these sources, was to live a prosperous, happy, productive life in this world (cf Epicureanism). There is some evidence that the school persisted until at least 1578.\n\nJainism believes that the emancipated soul is itself God. Jains do not believe in a creator God, but there is belief in numerous gods within the cosmos.\n\nBuddhism is often described as non-theistic, since Buddhist authorities and canonical texts do not affirm, and sometimes deny, the following:\n\n\nAll canonical Buddhist texts that mention the subject accept the \"existence\" (as distinct from the \"authority\") of a great number of spiritual beings, including the Vedic deities. From the point of view of Western theism, certain concepts of the Buddha found in the Mahayana school of Buddhism, e.g. of Amitabha or the Adibuddha may seem to share characteristics with Western concepts of God, but Gautama Buddha himself denied that he was a god or divine.\n\nSome forms of Confucianism and Taoism do not explicitly affirm, nor are they founded upon a faith in, a higher being or beings. However, Confucian writings do have numerous references to \"Tian\" (Heaven), which denotes a transcendent power, with a personal connotation. Neo-Confucian writings, such as that of Chu Hsi, are vague on whether their conception of the Great Ultimate is like a personal deity or not. Although the Western translation of the Tao as \"god\" in some editions of the Tao te Ching is highly misleading, it is still a matter of debate whether the actual descriptions of the Tao by Laozi has theistic or nontheistic undertones. Religious forms of Taoism do believe in a variety of cosmological beings, which are analogies to the cosmic forces within the universe.\n\nReligions that can be described as grey areas, and do not belong in the aforementioned categories, such as Unitarian Universalism.\n\nUnitarian Universalism (UU) is a liberal religion, first founded when Unitarians and Universalists came together in 1961. According to the Unitarian Universalist Association, atheists and agnostics are accepted and welcomed into the UU religion. 'People with atheist and agnostic beliefs find a supportive community in our congregations. We are pro-science, pro-reason, and pro-Evolution...Unitarian Universalism honors the differing paths we each travel. Our congregations are places where we celebrate, support, and challenge one another as we continue on these journeys.' The UU also accepts Christians, and many other religions who believe in a higher being, but it is not restricted - the UUA says that 'Unitarian Universalists are agnostic, theist, atheist, and everything in between.'\n\nLaVeyan Satanism is atheistic, rejecting belief in God and all other deities, including, to the surprise of many, Satan. \"Satanism begins with atheism,\" said Church of Satan High Priest Peter H. Gilmore in an interview. \"We begin with the universe and say, 'It’s indifferent. There’s no God, there’s no Devil. No one cares!'\" The function of God is performed and satisfied by the satanist him/herself. The needs of worship, ritual, and religious/spiritual focus are directed inwards towards the satanist, as opposed to outwards, towards a deity. It rejects concepts such as prayer, the afterlife, and divine forces.\n\nLegal treatment of atheism has in the past and continues to vary tremendously across different jurisdictions. Three major types of national regime exist: state atheism, where atheism is supported by the government; state religion, where a specific religion or sect is supported by the state, and a secular state which supports neither. Most ancient civilizations (from city-states to empires) had state religions; most modern countries are secular. State atheism is currently practiced in China and Vietnam, but unlike the strongly enforced bans on religious worship in the early Soviet Union and after the Communist Revolution in China, freedom of religion is currently established by law in both China and Vietnam, and respected in practice to some degree (see Freedom of religion in China and Freedom of religion in Vietnam). The minority of modern countries with state religions have established interpretations of either Christianity, Islam, or Buddhism.\n\nCountries with state religions range from those with extremely tolerant laws, like the United Kingdom, to those where the police enforce daily prayer, like Saudi Arabia. Under the millet system of the Ottoman Empire, separate systems of family law are enforced by religious authorities for their separate communities. This system was inherited by and is still in use to various degrees in various Middle Eastern countries, including Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and Greece (for religious minorities). Similar separate systems are used in India, Iran, Pakistan and Bangladesh. These systems sometimes create legal problems for atheists and couples of different religions. Atheists may be forced to declare an approved religion, or may be assigned one based on their ethnicity.\n\nEven in counties where freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitution or other fundamental law, practices or beliefs of a specific religion might be reflected in ostensibly secular codes. For example, blue laws in some Christian countries have enforced certain observances of the Sabbath on Sunday, for example by banning alcohol sales or forcing businesses to close. Laws surrounding nudity, pornography, abortion, contraception, homosexuality, gambling, alcohol, tobacco often track religious sensibilities, though some argue that these are cultural rather than religious prohibitions, though there may be an influence of religious thinking on culture. Major early transitions from state religions to secular states in Western Christiandom were noted in Colonial North America, the American Revolution, and the French Revolution. Prohibitions against state support for any particular religion or against required participation are not always enforced, particularly early in this transition process, and local laws in strongly religious communities may conflict with higher-level law. For example, official school prayer was allowed in the United States until 1962. Freedom of religion was affirmed in nearly all countries in 1966 by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Despite having no state religion, the German government collects religious taxes for the constituents of several religions; the fee for leaving a religious body has been challenged by atheists.\n\nSome states, regardless of state endorsement of a religion, protect major religions against insult (which may include profession of atheism or criticism of religion by atheists), including Indonesia. Other religious crimes which may cause legal problems for atheists include \nheresy, blasphemy, apostasy.\n\nThe chief law officer is called Lord Chancellor and holds the title of 'the conscience of the monarch. British subjects have a long history of religious upheaval from the time when Henry VIII of England ordered the English Reformation. There followed a long period of alternate suppressions and liberalizations until, following the Restoration when common law became progressively more descriptive than prescriptive, judges were allowed some latitude in determining guilt (which is why English law is so ambiguous). British \"religious atheists\" are numerous and might include George Fox, John Wesley and, notably Jeremy Bentham, whose body is displayed in the South Cloister of University College London.\n\nAtheism in the United States is protected under the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause. There are also online churches that have been created by atheists to secure legal rights, to ordain atheist clergy to hold ceremonies, as well as for parody, education, and advocacy.\n\nIn 1797, the United States Senate ratified a treaty with Tripoli that stated in Article 11: \n\n"}

{"id": "9826077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9826077", "title": "Bora (Australian)", "text": "Bora (Australian)\n\nBora is an initiation ceremony of the Aboriginal people of Eastern Australia, descended from groups that existed in Australia and surrounding islands before European colonisation. The word \"bora\" also refers to the site on which the initiation is performed. At such a site, boys, having reached puberty, achieve the status of men. The initiation ceremony differs from Aboriginal culture to culture, but often, at a physical level, involved scarification, circumcision, subincision and, in some regions, also the removal of a tooth. During the rites, the youths who were to be initiated were taught traditional sacred songs, the secrets of the tribe's religious visions, dances, and traditional lore. Many different clans would assemble to participate in an initiation ceremony. Women and children were not permitted to be present at the sacred bora ground where these rituals were undertaken.\n\nThe word \"Bora\" was originally taken from the Gamilaraay language spoken by the Kamilaroi people who lived in the region north of the Hunter Valley in New South Wales to southern Queensland. It was then adopted broadly to describe similar ritual sites and the ceremonies associated with them performed throughout Eastern Australia. Many other terms exist across Australia to denote similar initiatory rites on a ceremonial ground, such as \"burbung\" (Wiradjuri), and \"kuringal\" (Yuin). The specific word is said to come from the belt worn by initiated men.\n\nThe appearance of the site varies among cultures, but it is often associated with stone arrangements, rock engravings, or other art works. In the bora rites of southeastern Australia, two circles were drawn, connected by a pathway, a schema which appears to replicate a sky Bora, or the configuration of a series of positions in the Milky Way. Typically, bora ground comprised a larger circle with a diameter of between 20–30 metres, and a smaller ring around 10–15 metres in diameter. The former was a more public space while the latter was sacred, and restricted to male participants who were either the instructing male elders or the initiands.\n\nIn south-east Australia, the Bora is often associated with the creator-spirit Baiame. In the Sydney region, large earth mounds were made, shaped as long bands or simple circles. Sometimes the boys would have to pass along a path marked on the ground representing the transition from childhood to manhood, and this path might be marked by a stone arrangement or by spirit footprints (\"mundowa\"), cut into the rock. In other areas of south-east Australia, a Bora site might consist of two circles of stones, and the boys would start the ceremony in the larger, public, one, and end it in the other, smaller, one, to which only initiated men are admitted. Matthews (1897) gives an excellent eye-witness account of a Bora ceremony, and explains the common use of the two circles. One very fine example of a two ring bora ceremonial site used to exist in Alberton till it was destroyed, and made way for a pineapple plantation in the late 1950s. The smaller southern ring contained a dolmen-like structure.\n\nThe rings are joined by a sacred walkway. While most are confined to south-east Queensland and eastern New South Wales, five earth rings have been recorded near the Victorian town of Sunbury, although Aboriginal use has not been documented.\n\nBora rings in the form of circles of individually placed stones are evident in Werrikimbe National Park in northern New South Wales.\n\n"}

{"id": "2469204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2469204", "title": "Curse and mark of Cain", "text": "Curse and mark of Cain\n\nThe curse of Cain and the mark of Cain are phrases that originated in the story of Adam and Eve in the Hebrew Bible. In the stories, if someone did something to harm Cain, the damage would come back sevenfold. Some interpretations view this as a physical mark, whereas other interpretations see the \"mark\" as a sign, and not as a physical marking on Cain himself. The King James Version of the Bible reads \"set a mark upon Cain.\"\n\nThere is no clear consensus as to what Cain's mark was. The word translated as \"mark\" in Genesis 4:15 is \" 'owth\", which could mean a sign, omen, warning, remembrance, motion, gesture, agreement, miracle, wonder, or, most commonly, a letter. In the Torah, the same word is used to describe the stars as signs or omens (Genesis 1:14), the rainbow as the sign of God's promise to never again destroy his creation with a flood (Genesis 9:12), circumcision as a token of God's covenant with Abraham (Genesis 17:11), and the miracles performed by Moses before the Pharaoh (Exodus 4:8,9,17,28; 7:3; 8:23; 10:1,2).\n\nThe narrative of the curse of Cain is found in the text of . The curse was the result of Cain murdering his brother, Abel, and lying about the murder to God. When Cain spilled his brother's blood, the earth became cursed as soon as the blood hit the ground. In a sense, the earth was left \"drinking Abel's blood\". gives a two-part sentencing for Cain's curse. The first concerns the earth that was cursed by Abel's blood. Should Cain attempt to farm the land, the earth would not yield produce for him. This may imply why he went on to build cities, namely the City of Enoch. The second part of the curse marks Cain as a fugitive ( ) and a wanderer ( ). The combination making up this Hebrew phrase , \"fugitive and wanderer\", is unique in the Hebrew Bible. Modern interpretations of the Hebrew verse 12 suggest that Cain went on to live a nomadic lifestyle and that he was also excluded from the family unit. In the Septuagint, the emphasis on Cain's curse is dramatically increased by the combination of the Greek participles στένων καὶ τρέμων (\"groaning and shaking upon the earth\"). Syriac Christianity interprets the Greek version to mean that Cain experienced a real physical affliction that would enable others to know who he was when they saw him. Philo interprets the \"Greek\" verse 12 as an allegory for Cain's fear of being soulless. The Samaritan Pentateuch and the Targums translate the same verse to mean that Cain feared being \"an exile and an unstable man\".\n\nThe Hebrew word for \"mark\" (\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>Oth\", ) could mean a sign, an omen, a warning, or a remembrance. The \"mark of Cain\" is God's promise to offer Cain divine protection from premature death with the stated purpose of preventing anyone from killing him. It is not known what the mark was, but it is assumed that the mark was visible. Some have speculated that the mark was a Hebrew letter placed on either the face or the arm. The Septuagint translates the \"mark\" as a \"sign\". Thus, it is speculated that the mark served as a \"sign\" to others not to commit the same offense.\n\nThere is also uncertainty as to why Cain should have feared being killed, since the Book of Genesis does not at that point indicate that there were any human beings then alive other than his parents, Adam and Eve. It is possible that Cain was referring to his future siblings and their descendants, or his own descendants and family, since Cain did in fact take a wife (Genesis 4:17).\n\nAbba Arika (\"Rab\") said that God gave Cain a dog, making him an example to murderers. Abba Jose ben Hanan said that God made a horn grow out of Cain. R. Hanin said that God made Cain an example to penitents (\"Gen. Rab.\" 22:12).\n\nRashi comments on Genesis 4:15 by saying that the mark was one of the Hebrew letters of the Tetragrammaton:\n\"He engraved a letter of His [God's] Name onto his [Cain's] forehead.\"\n\nIn Kabbalah, the Zohar states that the mark of Cain was one of the twenty-two Hebrew letters of the Torah, although the Zohar's native Aramaic does not actually tell us which of the letters it was. Some commentators, such as Rabbi Michael Berg in his English commentary on the Zohar, suggest that the mark of Cain was the letter vav.\n\nAccording to author Ruth Mellikoff, commentators' interpretations of the nature of the \"mark\" depended on their views regarding the status of Cain, as either being given additional time to repent or as being further shamed.\n\nAt some point after the start of the slave trade in the United States, many Protestant denominations began teaching the belief that the mark of Cain was a dark skin tone, although early descriptions of Romani as \"descendants of Cain\" written by Franciscan monk Symon Semeonis suggest that this belief had existed for some time. Protestant preachers wrote exegetical analyses of the curse, with the assumption that it was dark skin.\n\nIn Syriac Christianity, early exegesis on the \"curse\" and the \"mark\", associated the curse of Cain with black skin, although not in a racial sense.\n\nIn an Eastern Christian (Armenian) Adam-book (5th or 6th century), it is written: \"And the Lord was wroth with Cain. . . He beat Cain's face with hail, which blackened like coal, and thus he remained with a black face\". Again, this indicated that his face, not his body, had been changed, and that this change had no bearing on any racial or ethnic group.\n\nThe split between the Northern and Southern Baptist organizations arose over doctrinal issues pertaining to slavery and the education of slaves. At the time of the split, the Southern Baptist group used the curse of Cain as a justification for slavery. Some 19th- and 20th-century Baptist ministers in the Southern United States taught the belief that there were two separate heavens; one for blacks, and one for whites. Southern Baptists have either taught or practiced various forms of racial segregation well into the mid-to-late-20th century, though members of all races were accepted at worship services. In 1995, the Southern Baptist Convention officially denounced racism and apologized for its past defense of slavery.\n\nThe curse of Cain was used to support a ban on ordaining blacks to most Protestant clergies until the 1960s in both the United States and Europe. The majority of Christian churches in the world, including the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox churches, Anglican churches, and Oriental Orthodox churches, did not recognize these interpretations and did not participate in the religious movement to support them. Certain Catholic dioceses in the Southern United States adopted a policy of not ordaining blacks to oversee, administer the sacraments to, or accept confessions from white parishioners. This policy was not based on a \"curse of Cain\" teaching, but was justified by the widely held perception that slaves should not rule over their masters. However, this was not approved of by the Pope or by any papal teaching.\n\nThe Curse of Cain was often conflated with the Curse of Ham. According to the Bible, Ham discovered his father Noah drunk and naked in his tent, but instead of honoring his father by covering his nakedness, he ran and told his brothers about it. Because of this, Noah cursed Ham's son, Canaan by saying that he was to be \"a servant of servants\". () One interpretation of this passage states that Ham married a descendant of Cain, who was black, so that the descendants of Canaan were both marked with black skin and cursed to be servants of servants. While there is no indication in the Bible of Ham's wife descending from Cain, this interpretation was used to justify slavery and it was particularly popular in America during the Atlantic slave trade.\n\nModern scholars now believe that the Canaanites are of Semitic origin, and therefore unrelated to black Africans.\n\nMormonism began during the height of Protestant acceptance of the curse of Cain doctrine in America, as well as the even more popular curse of Ham doctrine. Like many Americans, Mormons of the 19th century commonly assumed that black Africans had Cain's \"mark\" of black skin, and Ham's curse to be servants of servants. While Joseph Smith indicated his belief in the curse of Ham theory in a parenthetical reference as early as 1831, however, the reference is not to the \"curse or mark of Cain\" as in the Pearl of Great Price, it is attributed to an act of genocide upon \"the people of Shum\" and includes the statement that after this act the descendent of Cain were shunned: \"And Enoch also beheld the residue of the people which were the sons of Adam; and they were a mixture of all the seed of Adam save it was the seed of Cain, for the seed of Cain were black, and had not place among them.\" ()\n\nAs related by Abraham O. Smoot after his death, Apostle David W. Patten said he encountered a black man in Paris, Tennessee, who said that he was Cain. The account states that Cain had earnestly sought death but was denied it, and that his mission was to destroy the souls of men. The recollection of Patten's story is quoted in Apostle Spencer W. Kimball's \"The Miracle of Forgiveness\". \n\nThe Old Testament student manual, which is published by the Church and is the manual currently used to teach the Old Testament in LDS Institutes, teaches that Ham's wife was a descendant of Cain:\n\nThere is evidence that Joseph Smith did not consider the ban on black men to the priesthood to be relevant in modern times, since he himself (and other church leaders close to him) ordained black men into it, notably Elijah Abel and Walker Lewis.\n\nAfter the death of Joseph Smith, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) was the largest of several organizations claiming succession from Smith's church. Brigham Young (the second President of the Church) accepted the idea that people of African ancestry were generally under the curse of Cain, and in 1852, he stated that people of black African descent were not eligible to hold the church's priesthood. Young taught that in the war in heaven, both Cain and Abel were leaders. The spirits of black people fought under Cain and were assigned to be Cain's descendant. Those that fought under Abel were assigned to be Abel's descendants. Cain hoped that by killing his brother, the spirits that were under him would have an advantage over the spirits under Abel. However, God cursed Cain and his descendants to not have the priesthood until all of Abel's descendants had the priesthood. The spirits of black people understood this and stood with Cain and accepted the punishment. The ban on the priesthood affected black members differently than it did in other churches because the LDS Church has a lay priesthood in which virtually all worthy male members become priesthood holders.\n\nSeveral of his successors defended it as being a result of the curse of Cain, though some disagreed. Sterling M. McMurrin reported that, in 1954, church president David O. McKay said: \"There is not now, and there never has been a doctrine in this church that the negroes are under a divine curse. There is no doctrine in the church of any kind pertaining to the negro. We believe that we have a scriptural precedent for withholding the priesthood from the negro. It is a practice, not a doctrine, and the practice someday will be changed. And that's all there is to it.\"\n\nIn 1978, LDS Church president Spencer W. Kimball reported receiving a revelation from God allowing all worthy male members of the church to receive the priesthood without regard to race or color. The news was greeted with joy and relief by Mormons. Although the church had previously been criticized for its policy during the civil rights movement, the change seems to have been prompted by problems facing mixed-race converts in Brazil.\n\nThere has neither been an official or an explicit church repudiation of its policy, nor has there been an admission that it was a mistake. Many black church members think that giving an apology would be a \"detriment\" to church work and a catalyst for further racial misunderstanding. African-American church member Bryan E. Powell says: \"There is no pleasure in old news, and this news is old.\" Gladys Newkirk agrees, stating: \"I've never experienced any problems in this church. I don't need an apology ... We're the result of an apology.\" Many Black Mormons say that they are willing to look beyond the former teachings and cleave to the doctrines of the church, in part because of its powerful, detailed teachings on life after death.\n\nThe LDS Church has issued an official statement about past practices and theories regarding skin color, stating: \"[t]oday, the Church disavows the theories advanced in the past that black skin is a sign of divine disfavor or curse, ... Church leaders today unequivocally condemn all racism, past and present, in any form.\"\n\nWhen Utah was considering slavery, Brigham Young told the Utah Territorial Legislature that the curse of Cain required slavery. He argued that until all of the descendants of Abel have access to the priesthood, all of the descendants of Cain should remain in servitude. He argued that because they did not have the right to govern the affairs of the Church due to the priesthood ban, they also shouldn't have the right to govern the affairs of the state, including the right to vote. He warned that if they made the children of Cain equal to them, they would be cursed. He also argued that if someone married a descendant of Cain, that they would also have the same curse.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is perhaps best known as a major representative of the first generation of Korean minjung theologians.\n\nSuh traces the origins of minjung theology to the March First Movement of 1919, an independence movement triggered by the end of World War I and the death of King Kojong, the last king of the Yi Dynasty. It was during the 1919 independence movement when Korean minjung and Korean Christians partnered together to rise against foreign domination and liberate themselves from Japanese rule, thereby giving birth to minjung theology. \n\nWhile Suh sees minjung theology as being borne from a political movement, he also clarifies that it has risen from the indigenous Korean shamanism as a religion of the poor, oppressed, and marginalized. Combined with the spiritual mindset of Korean shamanism, Suh writes that \"For the powerless minjung, the power of the spirit, more particularly the power of the Holy Ghost, is most respected and awed. To become a Christian is to believe in the power of the Holy Ghost which is much more powerful than their shaman spirits.\" The spirituality of the minjung, then, is a spirituality that has emerged from the feelings of \"han\"—the deep feeling of suffering and helplessness experienced by the oppressed.\n\n"}

The most common is \"ta'līm\", from the root \"'alima\", which means knowing, being aware, perceiving and learning. Another term is \"Tarbiyah\" from the root of \"raba\", which means spiritual and moral growth based on the will of God. The third term is \"Ta'dīb\" from the root \"aduba\" which means to be cultured or refined in social behavior.\n\nSyed Muhammad Naquib al-Attas described the Islamic purpose of education as a balanced growth of the total personality through training the spirit, intellect, rational self, feelings and bodily senses such that faith is infused into the whole personality.\n\nSeyyed Hossein Nasr stated that, while education does prepare humankind for happiness in this life, \"its ultimate goal is the abode of permanence and all education points to the permanent world of eternity\".\n\nAccording to the Nahj al-Balagha, there are two kinds of knowledge: knowledge merely heard and that which is absorbed. The former has no benefit unless it is absorbed. The heard knowledge is gained from the outside and the other is absorbed knowledge means the knowledge that raised from nature and human disposition, referred to the power of innovation of a person.\n\nThe Quran is the optimal source of knowledge. For teaching Quranic traditions, the Maktab as elementary school emerged in mosques, private homes, shops, tents, and even outside. \n\nThe Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) has organized five conferences on Islamic education: in Mecca (1977), Islamabad (1980), Dhaka (1981), Jakarta (1982), and Cairo (1987).\n\n"}

Their origin is traced to Guhila dynasty of Mewar and they had migrated to Saurashtra in 12th century. The earliest known inscription of Gohils is found from Mangrol so they must be ruling in southwest of peninsula under Chaulukya dynasty. They later moved to the east coast where they established themselves and the region came to be known as Gohilwad and ruled till the independence of India in 1947. The erstwhile princely states of Bhavnagar, Palitana, Lathi, Vala and Rajpipla belonged to Gohil rulers.\n\nTraditionally, Gohils trace their origin to the king named Shalivahana. D. R. Bhandarkar, C. V. Vaidya and Gaurishankar Oza have established origin of Gohils with Guhila dynasty of Medapata (Guhilots of Mewar). This Shalivahana is identified with Shalivahana, the Guhila king of Medapata. He mentioned in Atpur (Ahar) inscription of his son Shaktikumara dated 977 CE (VS 1034). He is sometimes misidentified with Shalivahana of south who is sometimes associated with Saka Era. Guhilas considered themselves as Suryavanshi (of solar race).\n\n<mapframe text=\"Find spots of inscriptions mentioning Gohil dynasty\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" zoom=\"7\" longitude=\"71.31\" latitude=\"21.84\">\n</mapframe>\n\nThe Mangrol stone-inscription of the Guhila Thakkura Muluka was found incised on a slab of black stone attached to the wall of a stepwell in the town of Mangrol near Junagadh. It is the earliest epigraph of Gohil dynasty. It is dated Ashwin Vadi 13 of VS 1202/Simha Samvat 32 (15 October 1145 Monday). It has 25 lines opening with \"Om Namah Sivay\" and an invocation to Hara (Shiva). It then praises Chaulukya king Kumarapala, successor of Jayasimha Siddharaja. Then it mentions the family of Guhila, Sahara, his son Sahajiga, who was an \"anga-niguhaka\" (commander of army) of the Chaulukyas; his eldest son Muluka, protector of Surashtra (\"Saurashtraraksh-kshama\" and \"Saurashtra-nayaka\"); his younger brother Somaraja who built a Maheshwara (Shiva) temple at Somnath and named it Sahajigeshwara after his father. Muluka made granted one Ka (Karshapana?) from custom house (\"shulka-mundapika\") of Mangalapura (modern Mangrol) and other gift for service of it. The inscription is composed by Pashupata teacher Prasarvajna.\n\n\nThis inscription was found in the Kamanatha Mahadeva temple in Ghelana village near Mangrol. It is dated Vallabhi year 911 (1229 CE). It mentions Ranaka Rana(???), son of Thakur Mulu, who granted \"Asanapatta\" for worship of the god in Bhrigu Matha. Its copy is now stored in Rajkot Museum.\n\nThakur Mulu is probably the same Thakkura Muluka mentioned in the Mangrol stone-inscription. Based on this and Magrol inscriptions, it is known that they were ruling in the southwest region of Saurashtra, probably as the neighbour of Jethwas. It is not known why they moved to the eastern coast of Saurashtra later.\n\nThis inscription was found on pedestral of Chaturbhuj Jain image in Jain temple of Parnala village. It is dated VS 1453 (1397 CE). It says abou the consecration of that image by Bhavaladevi, wife of Gohil king Pratapmalla. Nothing else is known about this king Pratapmalla.\n\nThe sub-joined inscription in the black stone slab of the pedestral of idol of Laxmi Narayan temple near the Darbargadh of Mahuva near Bhavnagar. This Sanskrit inscription records digging of well and seem brought here from somewhere else as it does not mention the temple. It is dated VS 1500 (1444 CE). This inscription mentions Gohil king Sarangji who must have been Sarangji, son of Kanoji and ancestor of the rulers of Bhavnagar State. It also mentions a king named Rama which is not conclusively identified as Ramji, uncle of Sarangji or Vala king Ramadeva.\n\nRaval Sarangji is also mentioned as ruler of Ghogha port in VS 1469 as a feudatory of the Delhi Sultanate in the manuscript of \"Vishnu Bhakti Chandrodaya\".\n\nThis inscription is found on the Sati \"paliya\" (memorial stone) dated VS 1674 (1617 CE) in Vartej near Bhavnagar. It records donation by Gohil king Raval Dhunaji. Dhunaji was a son of Visoji, a Gohil chief of Sihor and ancestor of the Bhavnagar rulers. He had died fighting Kathis in 1619.\n\nThe inscription on \"paliya\" (memorial stone) dated VS 1722 (1666 CE) standing near 36 pillared shrine (\"deri\") in Halvad records death of Gohil Lakhaji, son of Asaji and his wife Potbai and grandson of Gohil Chachaji, while fighting for Raja Gajasimhaji who must have been Zala ruler who ruled from 1661 to 1673 CE. Another inscription on \"paliya\" near it mentions Gohil Vasaji, son of Karanji and his wife Jivibai and grandson of Govindji, who died in battle in fighting for Maharaja Jaswantsinhji in VS 1749 (1693 CE). Jaswantsinhji was a Zala ruler who ruled from 1683 to 1723 CE.\n\nA \"paliya\" in Gundi village near Ghogha has inscription dated VS 1755 (1699 CE) mentioning death of Gohil Kanoji, son Lakha, in battle a year earlier. Kanoji was successor of Vijoji, the chief of Umrala, and an ancestor of Bhavnagar rulers.\n\nThe inscription dated VS 1808 (1752 CE) in the Bhidbhanjan Mahadeva temple in Lathi mentions construction of the temple during reign of Gohil Shrisimhaji. Another inscription on the pedestal of the image of Ganesha mentions its consecration during reign of Gohil Lakhaji in VS 1820 (1763 CE). These who rulers must be ancestors of rulers of Lathi State.\n\nIt is said that a descendant of Salivahana settled in Khera-gadh on the banks of Luni river in the Jodhpur State. The last prince of Khera, Mohadasa, was killed by Siaji, grandson of the Rathod ruler 'Jayacandra' of Kanauj, according to the tradition.\n\nTraditions say that Mohadasa's grandson, Sejakji (1194–1254 CE or 1240–1290 CE), migrated to Saurashtra about VS 1250 and entered in service of Chudasama king Mahipala ruling from Junagadh. He obtained 12 villages around Sapur and from his progeny descended the Gohils of Saurashtra and other regions. According to Bardic accounts, he entered in service of another Chudasama king Kavat and had his daughter Valamkunvarba married to Khengar, son of Kavat. Kavat gave him a grant of Shahpur and surrounding twelve villages in Panchal (central Sairashtra). Sejakji's sons Shahji and Saranji obtained Mandvi Chovisi and Arthila Chovisi due to interests of their sister Valamkunvarba. The rulers of Palitana State and Lathi State traces their ancestry to these two brothers. James W. Watson, in \"Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Kathiawar\" Volume VIII (1884) had given VS 1290 and reason as their rivalry with Rathods. Sejakji is reported to have established new village named Sejakpur and won several villages surrounding it.\n\nBased on Mangrol stone-inscription, Muluka was a feudatory chief under Chaulukya king Kumarapala. Gaurishankar Oza identifies his father Sahajiga with Sejakji. He suggests that Sahajiga had first migrated from Luni valley and took service under Chaulukya king Siddharaja Jayasimha. He had participated as a commander of Chaulukya forces in his war against Saurashtra and thus he was later appointed as a chief of Saurashtra. H. C. Ray agrees with suggestion citing Muluka mentioned in the inscription as the protector of Saurashtra.\n\nRanaji/Ranoji (1254–1309 CE or 1290–1309 CE), descendant of Sejakji, established Ranpur and moved their capital to it. With help of Koli forces of Dhanmer, he captured Vala (Vallabhipur). It is told that he died in battle with forces of Ahmedabad, the capital of Gujarat Sultanate. Virbhadra Singhji has identified him as the grandson of Sejakji while other sources identify him as a son of Sejakji.\n\nSejakji's fifth brother Visoji married a daughter of Dhandh of Mer or Koli tribe of village Khas who was ruler of Dhandhuka. Their descendants are known as Khasiyas after name of the village. Watson identifies Visoji as the son of Ranoji. They lived in Khas for fifteen generations and Aranji II moved to neighbouring Matiyala in the early eighteenth century.\n\nRanaji's son, Mokhadaji (1309–1347 CE) captured Bhimdad from Vala Rajput and Umrala from Kolis. Then he captured Khokhra and later Ghogha expelling Muslim Kasbati (chief). From Baria Kolis, he conquered the Piram Island in the Gulf of Cambay. He established himself there and took up piracy. This irked Delhi Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq who was in Gujarat to quell rebellion. After hard-fought battle, he killed Mokhadaji and captured Ghogha and Piram island in 1347 CE.\n\nAccording to one story, Mokhadaji had no children until he was fifty. Balansha, a Muslim saint of Karakadi, was pleased by him with sacrifice. By his grace, he had sons so he built a mosque in his honour and vowed that his descendant will offer a leather (called Budi) when they are virgin.\n\nThe rulers of Palitana and Lathi States trace their ancestry to Shahji and Saranji, two sons of Sejakji.\n\nMokhadaji's elder son Dungarji (1347–1370) fled to Und-Saravaiyawad but he was captured by the Delhi forces. He was later reinstated as a chief of Ghogha and regained his father's possession of Umrala. His successor Visoji (1370-1395) was involved in a dispute of Jani and Rana clans of Audichya Brahman landlords of Sihor. Jani clan summoned Visoji while Rana clan summoned Kandhoji Gohil of Gariadhar. Visoji defeated Kandhoji and captured Sihor. He fortified it and made it his capital. His successors were Kanoji (1395–1420 CE) and Sarangji (1420–1445 CE), Sivdasji (1445–1470 CE), Jethiji (1470–1500 CE), Ramdasji (1500–1535 CE), Sartanji (1535–1570 CE), Visoji (1570–1600 CE), Dhunaji (1600–1619 CE), Ratanji (1619–1629 CE ), Harbhamji (1620–1622 CE), Govindji (1622–1636 CE), Satrasalji (1636 CE), Akherajji II (1636–1660 CE), Ratanji II (1660–1703). His son Bhavsinhji (1703–1764) established Bhavnagar in 1722–23 and made it capital of his state moving from Sihor. Vala State was founded in 1740 by Akherajji (1764–1772 CE), son of Bhavsinhji, for his twin brother Visaji.\n\nMokhadaji's younger son Samarsinhji was taken to his maternal uncle Chokrana, the prince of Junaraj (old Rajpipla), of Parmar dynasty of Ujjain. As Chokrana had no heir, Samarsinhji took up a new name, Arjunsinhji and succeeded him. The rulers of Rajpipla State are his descendants.\n\nMany small estates in Gohilwad region of Saurashtra were offshoots from the parent stem. These States and estates were continued to rule for centuries and even under the British Raj. They were merged with the Union of India when India became independent in 1947.\n"}
{"id": "767281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=767281", "title": "Imprimatur", "text": "Imprimatur\n\nAn imprimatur (from Latin, \"let it be printed\") is, in the proper sense, a declaration authorizing publication of a book. The term is also applied loosely to any mark of approval or endorsement.\n\nIn the Catholic Church an imprimatur is an official declaration by a Church authority that a book or other printed work may be published; it is usually only applied for and granted to books on religious topics from a Catholic perspective. Approval is given in accordance with canons 822 to 832 of the Code of Canon Law, which do not require the use of the word \"imprimatur\".\n\nThe grant of imprimatur is normally preceded by a favourable declaration (known as a \"nihil obstat\") by a person who has the knowledge, orthodoxy, and prudence necessary for passing a judgement about the absence from the publication of anything that would \"harm correct faith or good morals.\" In canon law such a person is known as a \"censor\" or sometimes as a \"censor librorum\" (Latin for \"censor of books\"). In this context, the word \"censor\" does not have the negative sense of prohibiting, but instead refers to the person's function of evaluating—whether positively or negatively—the doctrinal content of the publication. The episcopal conference may draw up a list of persons who can suitably act as censors or can set up a commission that can be consulted, but each ordinary may make his own choice of person to act as censor.\n\nAn imprimatur is not an endorsement by the bishop of the contents of a book, not even of the religious opinions expressed in it, being merely a declaration about what is \"not\" in the book. In the published work, the imprimatur is sometimes accompanied by a declaration of the following tenor:\n\nThe nihil obstat and imprimatur are declarations that a book or pamphlet is free of doctrinal or moral error. No implication is contained therein that those who have granted the nihil obstat or imprimatur agree with the contents, opinions or statements expressed.\nThe person empowered to issue the imprimatur is the local ordinary of the author or of the place of publication. If he refuses to grant an imprimatur for a work that has received a favourable nihil obstat from the censor, he must inform the author of his reasons for doing so. This enables the author, if he wishes, to make changes so as to overcome the ordinary's difficulty in granting approval.\n\nIf further examination shows that a work is not free of doctrinal or moral error, the imprimatur granted for its publication can be withdrawn. This happened three times in the 1980s, when the Holy See judged that complaints made to it about religion textbooks for schools were well founded and ordered the bishop to revoke his approval.\n\nThe imprimatur granted for a publication is not valid for later editions of the same work or for translations into another language. For these, new imprimaturs are required.\n\nThe permission of the local ordinary is required for the publication of prayer books, catechisms, and other catechetical texts and for school textbooks on Scripture, theology, canon law, church history, or religious or moral subjects. It is recommended, but without obligation, that books on the last-mentioned subjects not intended to be used as school textbooks and all books dealing especially with religious or moral subjects be submitted to the local ordinary for judgement.\n\nThe imprimatur effectively dates from the dawn of printing, and is first seen in the printing and publishing centres of Germany and Venice; many secular states or cities began to require registration or approval of published works around the same time, and in some countries such restrictions still continue, though the collapse of the Soviet bloc has reduced their number. In 2011, Bishop Kevin C. Rhoades was the first bishop to grant an imprimatur to an iPhone application.\n\nEnglish laws of 1586, 1637, and 1662 required an official licence for printing books. The 1662 act required books, according to their subject, to receive the authorization, known as the imprimatur, of the Lord Chancellor, the Earl Marshall, a principal Secretary of State, the Archbishop of Canterbury, or the Bishop of London. This law finally expired in 1695.\n\nIn commercial printing the term is used, in line with the meaning of the Latin word, for final approval by a customer or his agent, perhaps after review of a test printing, for carrying out the printing job.\n\nAs a metaphor, the word \"imprimatur\" is used loosely of any form of approval or endorsement, especially by an official body or a person of importance, as in the newspaper headline, \"Protection of sources now has courts' imprimatur,\" but also much more vaguely, and probably incorrectly, as in \"Children, the final imprimatur to family life, are being borrowed, adopted, created by artificial insemination.\"\n\nHaskama, approval, הַסְכָּמָה is a rabbinic approval of a religious book concerning Judaism. It is written by a prominent rabbi in his own name, not in the name of a religious organization or hierarchy.\n\nIt is often in the form of a letter, possibly on stationery, and generally includes not only \"approbation, recommendation, or endorsement\" of the work, but also a blessing for the success of the author in this and other accomplishments. As a result, at times a Haskama given to the author is printed, verbatim, in later works from the same author\n\nAn additional value for haskama letters, long ago, was to serve as a form of copyright, to protect the author or the printer from any unauthorized reproduction.\n\n\n"}

In the 17th century parts of central and southern Slovakia was occupied by Ottoman Turks and was bonded to the Uyvar Eyalet (along with Eğri Eyalet) for some decades after Turkish settlements were established for example in Novohrad region. Turks also had a suzerainty over the Principality of Upper Hungary, which controlled eastern Slovakia.\n\nDecades after the Hungarian defeat of Mohacs (1526) Turkish troops occupied Štúrovo (Párkány) and other parts of today's southern central Slovakia and encouraged the Protestant Christian groups while Habsburg Austrian troops occupied and recatholized the northern and western parts. Later on the Turks seized some further territories in southern central Slovakia and pillaged in territories up to Nitra. Finally, however, when the Turks lost the Battle of Vienna and the Ottoman vassal Imre Thököly was defeated in Slovakia, between 1687 and 1699 Turkish Ottoman rule in Hungary was finally broken.\n\nMost of the Muslims in Slovakia are refugees from former Yugoslavia (Bosnians and Albanians) or workers from modern Turkey (Turks) , beside them a few Arab students and migrant workers from South and Southeast Asia.

It is noted that in the Torah, there are over 100 \"Mitzvot\" concerning the \"kashrut\" (fitness) of one's money, many more, in fact, than concerning the \"kashrut\" of food. The subject thus receives an extensive treatment in Rabbinic literature, both from an ethical (\"Mussar\") and a legal (\"Halakha\") point of view.\n\nThe general gravity with which business ethics are treated in Jewish thought is illustrated by the widely quoted Talmudic tradition (Shabbat 31a ) that in one's judgement in the next world the \"first\" question asked is: \"were you honest in business?\" In addition to this, and numerous other Talmudic passages, the Mussar and Chassidic literature also discuss business ethics at great length. Examples follow.\n\n\"Aggadic\" and Midrashic discussions relating to honesty in business include the following. Yoma 86:B is an often cited example, where this obligation is examined in the context of profanation of God’s Name () and of the Love of God (). To position the question, a \"Talmudic\" dictum (\"Bava Kamma\" 30a) states: \"He who wishes to achieve saintliness should study the [mishnaic] order of Nezikin.\" Avot de-Rabbi Natan teaches that \"character is tested through business.\" The major Mishnaic principle of \"Torah im Derech Eretz\" - which underpins much \"Hashkafah\" and Jewish thought - requires that one earns one's living through productive labor, while also warning against materialism; see section #Earning a livelihood there. \"Kiddushin\" 4:14 discusses a general approach to work, and the ideal that one's profession be \"clean\", i.e. without prospect for dishonesty.\n\nThe \"Mesillat Yesharim\", considered a foundational Mussar text, devotes much discussion to honesty in business, and the role this plays as regards character development in general; see for example Ch 11. Rabbi Yisrael Lipkin Salanter (19th century), founder of the Musar movement in Eastern Europe, put a great deal of emphasis on business ethics, and taught that just as one checks carefully to make sure their food is kosher, so too should one check to see if his money is earned in a kosher fashion. The Chofetz Chaim’s first published work concerned honesty in weights and measures.\n\nSome examples in Chassidic thought follow; for further resources here see and. Based on a \"Maamar\" of the Lubavitch Rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson, it is learned that meditation and prayer, while spiritually transformative, do not match the power of doing business ethically (\"Padah B’Shalom\", 5739). The Admor of Belz, Rabbi Aharon Rokeach, in discussing the angels descending and ascending on the ladder seen in the dream of Ya'akov, notes that the \"gematria\" value of \"sulam\", ladder, is equivalent to that of \"kesef\", money. The teaching here is that while a few are able to ascend spiritually in the way they earn and spend their money others, instead, descend here. Indeed, therefore, \"nowhere in the whole field of human activity are the lusts and needs that need separation and religious guidance greater than in this field of human activity\". The \"Shelah\", Isaiah Horowitz, states (in \"Sha'ar Haotiyot\") that\n\nAs mentioned, there are over 100 \"Mitzvot\" (commandments) concerning commercial and business conduct – a few examples are discussed in the following sub-sections. The principles relating to these commandments are developed and expanded upon in the Mishnah and the Talmud (particularly in Order \"Nezikin\"). The detailed laws are then delineated in the major codes of Jewish law (e.g. \"Mishneh Torah\", particularly books 11. \"Nezikin\", 12. \"Kinyan\" and 13. \"Mishpatim\"; and \"Shulhan Arukh\", particularly \"Choshen Mishpat\").\nFurther, specific questions here, numbering in the thousands, have been discussed in various responsa over the centuries. For a general survey, see \"The Challenge of Wealth,\" by Dr. Meir Tamari. Also see Michael S. Perry's \"Labor Rights in the Jewish Tradition.\" And for an overview of \"\"The Challenge of Wealth as well as the resources listed at; for discussion relating to specific contemporary issues see and below; for a more holistic Halachic discussion, with detailed references, see the works by Marburger and Wagschal in references.\n\nAccording to the Book of Leviticus (19:35-36): \"You shall not falsify measures of length, weight, or capacity. You shall have an honest balance, an honest weight, an honest ephah, and an honest hin.\"\n\nLeviticus 25:14 teaches: \"When you sell anything to your neighbor or buy anything from your neighbor, you shall not deceive one another.\" The Talmud (Bava Metzia 49b and 50b) and later codes (Rambam, Mekhira, Chapter 12) expand on this verse to create a series of specific laws prohibiting \"ona'ah\", monetary deception. The prohibition is on the sale of an article at so much more, or to the purchase of an article at so much less, than its market value that fraud or the taking of an undue advantage is presumed. A discrepancy of one-sixth enables the wronged party to secure the cancelation of the sale or purchase; that is, an article worth six money-units in the market may not be sold for seven or bought for five (B. M. 49b). It seems that overcharge by the merchant selling to the consumer was the most frequent instance in which the application of the rule was called for; the claim had to be made as soon as the buyer had had an opportunity to show his purchase to a merchant or to one of his friends. It is said that R. Ṭarfon taught at Lydda that the discrepancy must amount to one-third to justify an action, whereupon the merchants rejoiced; but when he extended the time for rescission to the whole day they demanded the restoration of the old rule.\n\nEither seller or purchaser, whether merchant or one in private life, may make the complaint, notwithstanding the opinion to the contrary of R. Judah ben Ilai. The purchaser imposed upon may ask either for rescission of the transaction or for the return of the excess paid by him.\n\nIn the case of changing money it was suggested that a lack in weight of even one in twelve should be sufficient ground for complaint, but the prevailing opinion fixed here also the ratio of one in six. Within a great city the time for complaint extends until the money in question can be shown to a money-changer; in villages, where no money-changer is to be found, until the eve of the Sabbath, when the party deceived is apt to tender the coin in payment for his purchases.\n\nLeviticus 25:17 teaches: \"Do not deceive one another, but fear your God, for I the Lord am your God.\" Since Leviticus 25:14 was understood as referring to monetary deception, the Talmud concludes that Leviticus 25:17 refers to verbal deception, \"ona'at devarim.\"\n\nIn Baba Metziah (iv. 10), the Mishnah proceeds: \"As there is 'wronging' in buying and selling, so there is 'wronging' in words; a man may not ask, 'What is this article worth?' when he has no intention of buying; to one who is a repentant sinner it may not be said, 'Remember thy former conduct'; to him who is the son of proselytes one may not exclaim, 'Remember the conduct of thy forefathers'; for it is said, 'Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him'\" (Ex. xxii. 21). In a baraita (B. M. 58b) which follows this section the subject is further developed. \"When a proselyte comes to study the Law one should not say, 'He that ate the meat of fallen or torn beasts, of unclean and creeping things, now comes to study the Law that was spoken by the mouth of Omnipotence!' When trouble or sickness comes upon a man, or when he has to bury his children, none should say to him, as Job's friends said to Job, 'Where is thy fear of God, thy trust, thy hope, and the innocence of thy ways?'\" The baraita forbids also practical jokes. \"If ass-drivers come to one for fodder, one may not send them to N. N. to buy it, knowing that N. N. never sold hay or grain in his life.\"\n\nOn the authority of R. Simeon ben Yoḥai, it was said that wronging by words is worse than wronging in trade, for the Scripture as to the former, but not as to the latter, commands, \"Thou shalt fear thy God\": R. Eleazar says, because one injures the man himself, the other affects only his property; R. Samuel b. Naḥman says, because in one case there is opportunity for restoration, in the other there is not. The Talmud then dwells upon the unpardonable sin of \"blanching the face of one's neighbor in public,\" and closes with the admonition that under all circumstances a man should beware of \"wronging\" his wife, because her tears are ever ready to accuse him before the throne of God.\n\nGeneivat da'at, literally \"stealing of the mind/knowledge\", refers to a kind of dishonest misrepresentation or deception. The prohibition on geneivat da'at is attributed to the Talmudic sage Samuel of Nehardea in Talmud \"Chullin\" (94a): \"It is forbidden to mislead people, even a non-Jew.\" One Midrash states that \"geneivat da'at\" is the worst type of theft because it directly harms the person, not merely their money. In rabbinic exegesis, the law is associated with and .\n\nRabbi David Golinkin has explained the principle's application to business ethics as follows:\n\nWe would call it false packaging or false labeling. The Talmud gives a number of specific examples: One should not sift the beans at the top of the bushel because he is \"deceiving the eye\" by making the customer think that the entire bushel has been sifted. It is forbidden to paint animals or utensils in order to improve their appearance or cover up their defects (Bava Metzia 60a-b).\n\nWe are all familiar with this kind of ruse. A wholesaler takes an inferior brand of shirt and puts on Pierre Cardin labels. You buy a box of perfect-looking tomatoes or strawberries, only to discover upon opening the box at home that they were packaged with the bad spots facing down. And we all know how used cars are touched up and polished for the sole purpose of overcharging the customer. Such behavior is clearly forbidden by Jewish law.\n\nA statement in the Torah (Leviticus 19:14) prohibits \"placing a stumbling block before the blind.\" Jewish tradition sees this as a figuratively expressed prohibition against misleading people. When it comes to business ethics, Rabbi David Golinkin has pointed to the following examples of what this principle prohibits:\n\n\"A real estate agent should not dupe a young couple into buying a home with structural faults simply in order to make a fast buck. A stockbroker should not sell his client a bad investment just to collect the commission. A salesman should not convince his customer to buy an expensive item he really has no use for.\"\n\nThere are numerous published responsa dealing with specific contemporary issues; a few of many examples are discussed below.\n\nThe Jewish Labor Committee prepared a list of articles, books and other items, by over 60 authors, entitled \"Readings on Traditional Jewish texts on Labor and Worker Rights\".\n\nRabbi Michael Feinberg's article \"Wage Theft Study Guide: A Jewish Perspective\" is also online.\n\nRabbi Jill Jacobs authored a responsum in 2008, approved by Conservative Judaism's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, which argued that Jews are obligated to pay their workers on time, strive to pay their workers a living wage, and \"to treat their workers with dignity and respect.\" The responsum prohibited \"publicly yelling at, mocking, or otherwise embarrassing workers; forbidding employees from speaking their native languages at work; banning all bathroom breaks; changing work hours or adding shifts without advance notice; or making improper sexual comments or advances toward workers.\" Enforcing laws regarding the proper treatment of workers in the food industry has been central to the efforts of Conservative Judaism's Hekhsher Tzedek commission.\n\nIt is important not to steal company time. Rabbis had often noted the importance of working hard, such as the Biblical Jacob, who worked very hard for many years, despite being deceived by Jacob's father-in-law. Therefore, employees should avoid spending too much time on-line (e.g., Facebook) or other diversions when at their job.\n\nRabbi Barry Leff authored a responsum in 2007, approved by Conservative Judaism's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, regarding an employee's obligation to report wrongdoing on the part of his or her employer. He concluded that \"In any case of wrongdoing, there is an obligation to rebuke the person doing wrong if it can be assumed there is a reasonable chance the rebuke will be listened to, and the rebuke can be administered without substantial personal cost to the reporter.\"\n\nInstitutions including Harvard University, Brooklyn College, and The Rohr Jewish Learning Institute teach courses on Jewish Business Ethics for students and professionals.\n\n\n"}

The prohibition forbids a male from intentional wasteful spilling of his semen.\n\nThe Talmud forbids male masturbation, as it leads to unnecessary spilling of semen, or the impure thoughts of women other than the man's lawful wife. This prohibition is derived from the Biblical narrative of Onan (Talmud Niddah 13a). The Talmud (\"ibid\") likens the act to murder and idolatry. The wrath displayed by God toward Onan was invoked not through the act of spilling semen, but through disobedience to God's command for Onan to impregnate his brother's widow (see the story in Genesis 38:8-10). Others consider the death sentence excessive for failure to properly follow the laws of Levirate marriage — the Biblical option offered to those refusing a Levirate marriage was that the woman who was refused, would spit over the males shoe, after removing it from his foot. Because Onan's punishment was so much more severe, they argue that the spilling of semen was the relevant offense. Onan was not masturbating, but practising birth control by withdrawal.\n\nAccording to the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch, \"It is forbidden to discharge semen in vain. This is a graver sin than any other in the Torah\". However, \"Beis Shmuel\" expounds that this is not literal, but rather serves to frighten man into avoiding the sin.\n\nThere is disagreement among the \"poskim\", decisors of Jewish law, whether masturbation is an acceptable way of procuring semen for artificial insemination or in vitro fertilisation.\n\nJudaism in general neither prohibits nor discourages female masturbation, although some authorities consider female masturbation as necessarily involving \"impure thoughts\".\n\nReform and Reconstructionist rabbis have decided on more liberal conclusions. Reconstructionist Rabbi Alexis Roberts maintains that masturbation is \"harmless, natural and healthy. It may provide release and pleasure, as well as self-knowledge that is useful for pleasurable sex with a partner. It may make it easier for young people to have sexual release in the years when they are too young for a mature, committed, loving relationship.\" Reform Rabbi Jonathan Stein, in a proposed schema for normative Reform evaluation of different sexual activities, proposed that masturbation be considered \"mutar\", a term generally translated as \"permissible\", but which he renders as \"tolerable\". Rabbi Walter Jacob, writing on behalf of the Reform responsa committee, asserts, \"Although the statements of tradition are very clear, we would take a different view of masturbation, in the light of current psychological thought. Masturbation should be discouraged, but we would not consider it harmful or sinful.\"\n\nSperm in vain (or Semen in vain or Seed in vain; Hebrew: זרע לבטלה, pronounced: \"Zera Levatala\") is a Talmudic term for any sexual act in which a male's sperm is consciously \"wasted\", whether because she is pregnant, infertile, or elderly. This is proper for the purpose of fulfilling the \"Onah\" Mitzvah-commandment, the husband's marital obligations.\n\nPrior to the 20th century, it was a Jewish term usually (but not only) referring to masturbation. In Shulchan Aruch, on \"Yoreh Deah\", it is stated that wasting sperm is considered to be a sin greater than any sin in the Torah.\n\nHomosexual intercourse is also considered an act of spilling semen in vain; as for masturbation, despite not having been explicitly prohibited in the Torah, the Halkha and the Oral Torah views masturbation as an Halakhaic prohibition and a great sin. Even marital sexual acts in which the semen is not deposited in the vagina, is considered an act of seed in vain.\n\nThe Halakhic attitude towards a female masturbation is found in the opinions of the Ben Ish Chai, who says that it is wrong because it creates evil forces (\"Kelipos\"), and Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, who forbids it because it involves indulging in sexual fantasy about men, which falls under the prohibition of forbidden thoughts, which are forbidden for women as well. However, it does not carry the severity of male masturbation, because it does not involve the release of seed.\n\nIn modern days, the Halakhic question on whether taking a male sperm for the purpose of medical examinations or insemination is debated among the authorities.\n\nThe Tanakh does not explicitly prohibit masturbation. \n\"Leviticus\" chapter 15 in the Law of Moses states that any male having a \"flow\" is ceremonially defiled, he must cleanse himself with water, This \"flow\" refers to ejaculation of semen (verse 32), whether through masturbation or nocturnal emission. This temporary ceremonial defilement isn't masturbation-specific, it also applies to intercourse among married heterosexual partners\n\nOther than this ceremonial defilement, there are no consequences or punishments specified for masturbation or mere ejaculation to be found in Mosaic Law. However, the \"Temple Scroll\", used by the sect responsible for the Dead Sea Scrolls, states that a man may not enter the holy grounds of the Future Temple in the New Jerusalem for a period of seven days after ejaculating.\n\nMaimonides stated that the Tanakh does not prohibit masturbation.\n\nIn the Mishnah, masturbation is treated under a broader view about frequent examination of the male and female organs. It teaches that while for women it is praiseworthy to frequently examine themselves, for men their hands \"ought to be cut off\". This prohibition is derived from the Biblical narrative of Onan, who practiced birth control by withdrawal. The Talmud likens the act to murder and idolatry.\n\nAccording to the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch, \"It is forbidden to discharge semen in vain. This is a graver sin than any other in the Torah\". However, \"Beis Shmuel\" expounds that this is not literal, but rather serves to frighten man into avoiding the sin.\n\nLeviticus discusses a ritual defilement relating to emission of sperm. The traditional rabbinical interpretation of Leviticus 15 was that it applies to \"all\" sperm flows, including sperm flows due to masturbation. \n\nRabbinic authorities have in certain instances permitted intentional extra-vaginal ejaculation in tandem with one's wife. The tannaim Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Meir (Tosefta, Niddah 2:), for safety reasons (prior to the advent of female birth control) permits exterior ejaculation for a duration of 24 months post childbirth (Talmud Yebamoth 34). Tosefot cites the opinion of Rabbi Yitzchak (Isaac ben Samuel) who permitted an occasional exterior ejaculation with one's wife on the condition that one does not accustom himself to always doing so (Tosfoth, Yebamoth 34b, Tosfoth Sanhedrin 58b)). The \"Bayit Chadash\" (Yoel Sirkis) commentary to the Rabbeinu Asher (ibid.) explicitly permits this foreign ejaculation with Rabbeinu Asher siding with the tosafist opinion. This opinion is likewise quoted in Tur Shulchan Aruch, Even Ha'ezer ch. 25.\n\nRabbenu Asher, followed by Rabbi Elijah Spira, commented that an occasional exterior ejaculation in tandem with one's wife is not considered \"extracting semen in vain\" (and not banned by the Talmud) as long as the intention is not to avoid impregnating one's wife and it is done on rare occasion - as this is not likened to the desire of Onan, who wished to avoid impregnating Tamar entirely. The Aguddah work also sides with the lenient opinion, permitting an occasional extra-vaginal ejaculation with one's wife, whilst Rabbi Samuel Eidels (the Maharsha) likewise takes a lenient view.\n\nA more explicit permissive stance is that of the tosafist rabbi Isaiah di Trani the Elder:\n\nRabbi Isaiah the Elder's view is likewise echoed by his descendant, rabbi Isaiah di Trani the Younger.\n\nRabbi Eleazar of Worms, in his commentary to the verse \"Adam and his wife, and were not embarrassed\" (Genesis) permits any activity with one's wife necessary to \"quiet (lit. seat)\" his desire.\n\nFrom amongst rabbis of the achronim era, the Tzemach Tzedek differentiated between extracting one's seed alone (masturbation) and extra-vaginal extracting of one's seed with one's wife, with the latter a form (albeit strange) of a tandem relationship.\n\nSome \"poskim\" (decisors of Jewish law) rule that it is possible to masturbate to avoid \"arayot\" (forbidden relationships).\n\nThere is disagreement among the \"poskim\" whether masturbation is an acceptable way of procuring semen for artificial insemination or in vitro fertilisation.\n\n"}
{"id": "2542078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2542078", "title": "Kalpavriksha", "text": "Kalpavriksha\n\nKalpavriksha (Devanagari: कल्पवृक्ष), also known as kalpataru, \"karpaga viruksham\",\"kalpadruma or kalpapādapa, is a wish-fulfilling divine tree in Hindu mythology. It is mentioned in Sanskrit literature from the earliest sources. It is also a popular theme in Jain cosmology and Buddhism. Sage Durvasa and Adi Shankaracharya, meditated under the Kalpavriksha. The birth of Ashokasundari, the daughter of Shiva and Parvati, is attributed to the Kalpavriksha tree. Another daughter Aranyani was also gifted to Kalpavriksha for safekeeping.\n\nThe Kalpavriksha originated during the Samudra manthan or \"churning of the ocean of milk\" along with the Kamadhenu, the divine cow providing for all needs. The king of the gods, Indra, returned with this tree to his paradise.\n\nKalpavriksha is also identified with many trees such as Parijata (\"Erythrina variegata\"), \"Ficus benghalensis\", coconut tree (\"Cocos nucifera\"), \"Acacia\", \"Madhuca longifolia\", \"Prosopis cineraria\", \"Bassia butyracea\", and mulberry tree (\"Morus nigra\" tree). The tree is also extolled in iconography and literature.\n\nKalpavriksha is an artistic and literary theme common to the Hindu Bhagavatas, the Jains and the Buddhists.\n\nKalpavriksha, the tree of life, also meaning \"World Tree\" finds mention in the Vedic scriptures. In the earliest account of the Samudra manthan or \"churning of the ocean of milk\" Kalpavriksha emerged from the primal waters during the ocean churning process along with Kamadhenu, the divine cow that bestows all needs. The tree is also said to be the Milky way or the birthplace of the stars Sirius. The king of the gods, Indra returned with this Kalpavriksha to his abode, the paradise and planted it there. Tree also finds mention in the Sanskrit text Mānāsara, part of \"Shilpa Shastras\".Another myth says that Kalpavriksha was located on earth and was transported to Indra's abode after people started misusing it by wishing evil and wrong things. In Indra's \"Devaloka\" it is said that there are five Kalpavrikshas, which are called Mandana, Parijata, Santana, Kalpavriksha and Harichandana, all of which fulfill various wishes. Kalpavriksha, in particular, is said to be planted at Mt. Meru peak in the middle of Indra's five paradise gardens. It is on account of these wish-granting trees that the asuras waged a perpetual war with the devas as the heavenly gods who exclusively benefited freely from the \"divine flowers and fruits\" from the Kalpavriksha, whereas the demigods lived comparatively in penury at the lower part of its \"trunk and roots\". The Parijata is often identified with its terrestrial counterpart, the Indian coral tree (\"Eyrthrina indica\"), but is most often depicted like a magnolia or frangipani (Sanskrit: champaka) tree. It is described as having roots made of gold, a silver midriff, lapislazuli boughs, coral leaves, pearl flower, gemstone buds, and diamond fruit. It is also said that Ashokasundari was created from a Kalpavriksha tree to provide relief to Parvati from her loneliness.\n\nIn Hindu mythology Shiva and Parvati after much painful discussions while parting with their daughter Aranyani gave her away to the divine Kalpavriksha for safe keeping when the demon Andhakasura waged war. Parvati requested Kalpavriksha to bring up her daughter with \"safety, wisdom, health and happiness,\" and to make her Vana Devi, the protector of forests.\n\nKalpavrikshas are wish-granting trees which fulfill the desires of people in initial stages of worldly cycle as per Jain Cosmology. In initial times children are born in pairs (boy and girl) and don't do any karma. There are 10 Kalpavrikshas which grant 10 distinct wishes such as an abode to reside, garments, utensils, nourishment including fruits and sweets, pleasant music, ornaments, fragrant flowers, shining lamps and a radiant light at night.\n\nAccording to Jain cosmology, in the three \"Aras\" (unequal periods) of the descending arc (Avasarpini), Kalpavrikshas provided all that was needed, but towards the end of the third \"ara\", the yield from them diminished. Eight types of these trees are described in some texts, each of which provided different objects. Thus from the \"Madyanga tree\" delicious and nutritious drinks could be obtained; from the \"Bhojananga\", delicious food; from \"yotiranga\", light more radiant than the sun and the moon; while from \"Dopanga\" came indoor light. Other trees provided homes, musical devices, table ware, fine garments, wreaths and scents.\n\nThe \"Tiloya Panatti\" give the following list: \"Pananga\", \"Turiyanga\", \"Bhusananga\", \"Vatthanga\", \"Bhoyanga\", \"Alayanga\", \"Diviyanga\", \"Bhayananga\", \"Malanga\", \"Tejanga\" with excellent drinks, music, ornaments, garments, edibles and ready-made dishes, mansions to live in, lamps, utensils and garlands of flowers respectively while the last type, namely \"Tejanga\", seems to be self-luminous, serving the purpose of heavenly luminaries.\n\nIn Buddhism a small wish granting tree is depicted decorating the upper part of the \"long-life vase\" held by \"longevity deities\" like Amitayus and Ushnishavijaya. The goddess Shramana devi holds jeweled branch of Kalpavriksha in her left hand.\n\nWorship of the \"Nyagrodha tree\" as a form of non-human worship is depicted in a Buddhist sculpture at Besnagar. This sculpture in Besnagar, also known as Vidisa (Bhilsa), is dated to third century BC and is exhibited in the Calcutta Museum.\n\nIn Myanmar, where Theravada Buddhism is practiced, the significance of the Kalpavriksha is in the form of an annual ritual known as Kathina (presenting a robe) in which the laity present gifts to the monks in the form of money trees.\n\nIn different states of India some trees are specifically referred to as the Kalpavriksha. These are stated below.\n\nThe banyan tree (\"Ficus benghalensis\"), also called \"Nyagrodha\" tree, which grows throughout the country is referred to as Kalpavriksha or Kaplaptaru because of its ability to amply provide for human needs.\n\nThe coconut tree (\"Cocos nucifera\") found in most regions of the country is called \"Kalpavriksha\", as every part of it is useful in one way or the other. The coconut water inside the nut is a delicious drink. In dried form it is called copra and is used to manufacture oil. The coconut husk, called coir, is used to make rope. Leaves are used to make huts, fans, mats. Palm sugar is made from budding flower. The dried midrib is used to make boats.\n\nAshwatha tree (sacred fig tree) is also known as Kalapvriksha where the deities and Brahma are stated to reside, and it is where sage Narada taught the rishis on the procedure for worshipping the tree and its usefulness.\n\nMahua tree (\"Madhuca longifolia\") holds an important place in the day-to-day life of the tribal people. It is like the Kalpavriksha wish tree called madhu (\"Madhuca indica\").\n\nShami tree (\"Prosopis cineraria\"), found in desert areas of the country, called in local dialect as \"khejari\" or \"jaant\" is called Kalpavriksha. In Rajasthan desert area its roots go deep to a depth of . This checks the erosion of the sandy soil of the desert. For this reason the tree stays green even drought conditions of weather. People of Rajasthan hence regard this tree as Kalpavriksha, because at the time of drought when no grass or fodder is found anywhere the animals are able to sustain by eating its green leaves.\n\n\"Chyur tree\" in the high altitudes of the Himalayas growing at an altitude between 500 and 1000 m, known as the Indian butter tree (\"Diploknema butyracea\"), is called a Kalpavriskha, or tree of paradise by the people of the mountainous region as it yields honey, jaggery and ghee. It is in the shape of an umbrella.\n\nIn Joshimath in Uttarakhand a mulberry tree, which is said to be 2400 years old, is renowned and revered as the Kalpavriksha as it was the location where, in the 8th century, Adi Sankaracharya did \"penance\" under the tree as he considered it an incarnation of Lord Shiva. It is also believed that sage Durvasa meditated under this tree, in Urgam. The mountain slopes of Kailasa are stated to have a profusion of Kalpavrikshas.\n\nAt Mangaliyawas near Ajmer, Rajasthan, there are two revered trees (Male and Female) which are more than 800 years old, known as Kalpavrikshas. They are worshipped on an Amavasya day in the Hindu month of Shraavana.\nIn Ranchi (Jharkhand, Ranchi, India) there are three Kalpavrikshas. They are at a locality called Hinoo. \nIn Tamil Nadu's culture, \"tala\" (\"Borassus flabellifer\") a variety of Palmyra palm (\"Borassus\"), also known as toddy, is referred to as Kalpataru as all its parts have a use. This tree is also native to Asia and South East Asia, has normally a life span of 100 years, grows up to height; its leaves in the shape of a fan are rough texture. The leaves were used for writing in the ancient times.\n\nIn the Harivansh Puraan, the Parijata, baobab tree, is called a Kalpavriksha, or wish bearing tree, which apart from the village of Kintoor, near Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh, is only found in heaven. The tree has mythological link with prince Arjuna of the Pandava clan who is said to have brought it from heaven. His mother Kunti after whom the village Kintoor is named used to offer flowers from this tree to worship Lord Shiva. It is also said that Lord Krishna brought this tree from heaven to please his wife Satyabhama.\n\nKalpalatha is another wish fulfilling tree, a creeper, which was extolled during the later part of the Aryan period. It is said that a person standing below this tree would be blessed with beautiful ornaments, dresses and even unmarried girls.\n\nIn iconography, Kalpavriksha, the wish-fulfilling tree, is painted within a picture of a landscape, decorated with flowers, silks, and suspended with jewelry. It is a pattern which has a prominent symbolic meaning. Ornamental Kalpavriksha design was a feature that was adopted on the reverse of the coins and sculptures in the Gupta period.\n\nKalpavriksha is also dated to the Dharmachakra period of Buddhism. The paintings of this period depicting the tree with various branches and leaves have a female figure painted on its top part. The female figure is painted from mast upwards holding a bowl in her hand. Similar depiction of female figure with tree representing it as presiding deity was a notable feature during the Sunga period as seen in the image of \"Salabhanvka\" in the railing pillars.\n\nIn most paintings of Kalpavriksha Shiva and Parvati are a common feature. It forms a canopy over Shiva. In one painting Paravati is paying obeisance to Lord Shiva with her hands held up in adoration when she is blessed with a stream of water from the Kalpavriksha.\n\nA Kalpavriksha is mentioned in the Sanskrit work Mānāsara as a royal insignia. In Hemādri's work \"Caturvargacīntama\", the Kalpavriksha is said to be a tree of gold and gem stones.\n\nIn poetry Kalpavriksha is compared to Lakshmi as its sister emerging from the sea.

He is involved in several nationalist and fascist political groups in New Zealand.\n\nIn 1980, Bolton co-founded the New Zealand branch of the Church of Odin, a pro-Nazi organisation for \"whites of non-Jewish descent\". He has published and edited several newsletters such as \"The Nexus\" and \"Western Destiny\". He founded the national-socialist Order of the Left Hand Path (OLHP) in 1992, following a quarrel with other members of the Temple of Set. Two years later it was renamed the \"Ordo Sinistra Vivendi\" (\"Order of the Left Way\"),and in the same year created the fascist Black Order. It claimed to have a network of national lodges in six European countries plus Australia and the U.S. It was intended to be an activist front promoting an \"occult-fascist axis\" by mobilising political groups and youth culture elements such as industrial music. Bolton created and edited the Black Order newsletter, \"The Flaming Sword\", and its successor, \"The Nexus\", a satanic-Nazi journal with special attention given to figures such as Savitri Devi, Julius Evola, and Ezra Pound, and which especially catered to the 'Black heavy-metal' movement. It later changed its name to \"Western Destiny\".\n\nBolton was a co-founder of the Nationalist Workers' Party, and was briefly secretary for the New Zealand Fascist Union in 1997, in which he promoted the 'patriotic socialism' of 1930s Labour hero John A. Lee. In 2004 he was the secretary of the New Zealand National Front and spokesman for the New Right group. He was also involved with the New Zealand National Front but resigned because of disputes with neo-Nazi and white supremacist factions.\n\nHe has been published on the websites of the politician Alfred Vierling and the holocaust denier Gerald Fredrick Töben. Bolton's 2003 self-published book \"Thinkers of the Right\" was described by Paul Gottfried as one of the most enlightened he has read on the inter-war Right.\n\nIn 2008, a masters thesis written about Bolton published by the Waikato University was temporarily pulled from the library pending investigation after Bolton complained to the vice-chancellor. The thesis, titled \"Dreamers of the Dark: Kerry Bolton and the Order of the Left Hand Path; a Case-study of a Satanic/Neo Nazi Synthesis\", dealt with the link between neo-Nazi and satanic beliefs in New Zealand. It had been passed by the university, had been reviewed by senior academics from two other universities, and had received full class honors. Professor Dov Bing, who supervised the thesis, called it a first-class piece of work. Bolton claimed the thesis was \"poorly researched\" and was \"a poorly contrived smear-document against a private individual, namely myself\". After criticism from the Tertiary Education Union, Vice Chancellor Crawford issued a one-page letter stating that the thesis was sound because it had been externally examined by \"two well qualified academics\".\n\nIn December 2009 Bolton filed a complaint with the Broadcasting Standards Authority concerning the \"Ideas\" program on Radio New Zealand National, which featured Marxist poet and sociologist Scott Hamilton. Hamilton had stated that Bolton was an avid \"holocaust denier\", had a \"close relationship\" with the revisionist Adelaide Institute, insinuated himself into the anti-war movement where he made anti-Semitic and \"holocaust denial\" statements, and exercised a bad political influence over \"unwary youth\". Bolton claimed that all of Hamilton's allegations were incorrect. The Broadcasting Standards Authority initially upheld Bolton's complaint on all grounds, and criticised Radio New Zealand for not having verified the accuracy of Hamilton's statements before airing the program, but reversed this decision in December 2010 and declined to uphold any of Bolton's complaints.\n\nIn December 2009 Bolton complained to the Press Council against a lengthy feature article run by \"The Press\", Christchurch, \"A Right Muddle\" by John McCrone. Bolton stated that the article wrongly stated that Bolton was a \"neo-Nazi Satanist\", that he was associated with \"white power\" and \"pseudo-fascist views\", that he was the founder of New Right New Zealand, among other matters. The Press Council in a ruling dated for release as 26 March 2010, upheld parts of the complaint, determining that the article is \"inaccurate and biased\".\n\nIn 2014 he was involved in a campaign that sought unsuccessfully to save a young dog from euthanasia for allegedly nipping another dog on the hind leg in the course of play. The dog was euthanised two days early after threats on Facebook of violence against council staff members.\n\nIn 2018 he appeared in court for breaching the name suppression of a sexual assault victim.\n\n\n\n"}

It contains the holiest temple in the Yezidi faith. The temple belongs to ancient times wherein many archaeologists and historians agree that the temple was a part of Sumerian and other ancient Mesopotamian civilizations, and from as early as the 25th century BC through to the 7th century AD the entire region of northern Iraq was an integral part of Assyria. Later it became the location of the tomb of Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir, who is a central figure of the Yazidi faith. \n\nThe village is above the town of Shekhan, which had the second largest population of Yazidi prior to the persecution of Yazidis by ISIL. The village is about thirty-six miles northeast of Mosul.\n\nAt least once in their lifetime, Yazidis are expected to make a six-day pilgrimage to Lalish to visit the tomb of Şêx Adî and other sacred places. These other sacred places are shrines dedicated to other holy beings. There are two sacred springs called Zamzam, which is in a cave below Sheikh Adi's sanctuary, and Kāniyā. Lalish is also the location of pirrā selāt (Ṣerāṭ Bridge) and a mountain called Mt. ʿArafāt which has sites significant in other faiths. Yazidis living in the region are also expected to make a yearly pilgrimage to attend the autumn seven-day \"Feast of the Assembly\", which is celebrated from 23 Aylūl to 1 Tašrīn I.\n\nLalish village dates back about 4000 years.\n\nIn the early 12th century, Adi ibn Mosāfer moved to Lalish. Adi died in 1162 and was buried. During a major battle against the Yazidi in 1414, the tomb of Adi was razed.\n\nBeginning on 10 August 2014, Yazidi refugees have been fleeing to the village from Sinjar after the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant placed that city under siege. Many fleeing Sinjar travelled through Syria to reach Lalish and Shekhan.\n\n"}

{"id": "125301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=125301", "title": "Mary Baker Eddy", "text": "Mary Baker Eddy\n\nMary Baker Eddy (July 16, 1821 – December 3, 1910) established the Church of Christ, Scientist, as a Christian denomination and worldwide movement of spiritual healers. She wrote and published the movement's textbook, \"Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures\" and 15 other books. She started several weekly and monthly magazines—the \"Christian Science Sentinel\", \"The Christian Science Journal\", and \"The Herald of Christian Science\"—that feature articles on Christian Science practice and verified testimonies of healing. In 1908, at the age of 87, she founded \"The Christian Science Monitor\", a global newspaper that has won seven Pulitzer Prizes. Eddy's book \"Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures\" has been a best seller for decades, and was selected as one of the \"75 Books By Women Whose Words Have Changed The World,\" by the Women's National Book Association. In 1995 Eddy was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. In 2002, The Mary Baker Eddy Library opened its doors, giving the public access to one of the largest collections about an American woman.\n\nEddy was born Mary Morse Baker in a farmhouse in Bow, New Hampshire to farmer Mark Baker (d. 1865) and his wife Abigail Barnard Baker, née Ambrose (d. 1849). Eddy was the youngest of the Bakers' six children: boys Samuel Dow (1808), Albert (1810), and George Sullivan (1812), followed by girls Abigail Barnard (1816), Martha Smith (1819), and Mary Morse (1821).\n\nMark Baker was a strongly religious man from a Protestant Congregationalist background, a firm believer in the final judgment and eternal damnation, according to Eddy. \"McClure's\" magazine published a series of articles in 1907 that were highly critical of Eddy, stating that Baker's home library consisted of the Bible—though Eddy responded that this was untrue and that her father had been an avid reader.\n\nEddy wrote that her father had been a justice of the peace at one point and a chaplain of the New Hampshire State Militia. He developed a reputation locally for being disputatious; one neighbor described him as \"[a] tiger for a temper and always in a row.\" \"McClure's\" reported several similar stories from neighbors, including that he once killed a crow with his walking stick for violating the Sabbath. The magazine described him as a supporter of slavery and alleged that he had been pleased to hear about Abraham Lincoln's death. Eddy responded that Baker had been a \"strong believer in States' rights, but slavery he regarded as a great sin.\"\n\nThe Baker children inherited their father's temper, according to \"McClure's\"; they also inherited his good looks, and Eddy became known as the village beauty. Life was nevertheless spartan and repetitive. Every day began with lengthy prayer and continued with hard work. The only rest day was the Sabbath.\n\nEddy and her father reportedly had a volatile relationship. Ernest Sutherland Bates and John V. Dittemore wrote in 1932 that Baker sought to break Eddy's will with harsh punishment, although her mother often intervened; in contrast to Mark Baker, Eddy's mother was described as devout, quiet, light-hearted, and kind. Eddy experienced periods of sudden illness, perhaps in an effort to control her father's attitude toward her. Those who knew the family described her as suddenly falling to the floor, writhing and screaming, or silent and apparently unconscious, sometimes for hours. Robert Peel, one of Eddy's biographers, worked for the Christian Science church and wrote in 1966:\n\nGillian Gill wrote in 1998 that Eddy was often sick as a child and appears to have suffered from an eating disorder, but reports may have been exaggerated concerning hysterical fits. Eddy described her problems with food in the first edition of \"Science and Health\" (1875). She wrote that she had suffered from chronic indigestion as a child and, hoping to cure it, had embarked on a diet of nothing but water, bread, and vegetables, at one point consumed just once a day: \"Thus we passed most of our early years, as many can attest, in hunger, pain, weakness, and starvation.\"\n\nEddy experienced near invalidism as a child and most of her life until her discovery of Christian Science. Like most life experiences, it formed her lifelong, diligent research for a remedy from almost constant suffering. Eddy writes in her autobiography,\"From my very childhood I was impelled by a hunger and thirst after divine things, - a desire for something higher and better than matter, and apart from it, - to seek diligently for the knowledge of God as the one great and ever-present relief from human woe.\" She also writes on page 33 of the chapter, \"Medical Experiments,\" in her autobiography, \"I wandered through the dim mazes of 'materia medica,' till I was weary of 'scientific guessing,' as it has been well called. I sought knowledge from the different schools, - allopathy, homeopathy, hydropathy, electricity, and from various humbugs, - but without receiving satisfaction.\"\n\nIn 1836 when Eddy was fifteen, the Bakers moved twenty miles to Sanbornton Bridge, New Hampshire, known after 1869 as Tilton.\n\nAs a youngster, she was often tutored by Albert, a brilliant young man in his own right who clerked for Franklin Pierce as a lawyer and later became a state politician himself before his untimely death. Another tutor was the Reverend Enoch Corser, who was Mary's spiritual guide, as well. He told his son Bartlett concerning Mary, \"I never before had a pupil with such depth and independence of thought. She has some great future, mark that She is an intellectual and spiritual genius.\" \"Bright, good, and pure, aye brilliant!\"\n\nEddy completed her education at the Holmes Academy in Plymouth and Sanbornton Academy at the Bridge, between the years 1838 and 1842, when the present Tilton School served as a female college. She had an instructor of more than average talents in Professor Dyer Hook Sanborn. He was the author of a treatise on normal school teaching, and his \"Analytical Grammar\" went through eight editions. He was also the town's \"superintending school committee\" and he became Representative in 1845. Lucy Cross, historian of Northfield, states that it was a \"celebrated school,\" for he was a \"model educator,\" turning out \"many finely educated lady teachers.\" Mary Baker Eddy served as a substitute instructor at the same institution after its name had changed to the New Hampshire Conference Seminary and Female College.\n\nBates and Dittemore write that Eddy was not able to attend Sanbornton Academy when the family first moved there, but was required instead to start at the district school (in the same building) with the youngest girls. She withdrew after a month because of poor health, then received private tuition from the Reverend Enoch Corser. She entered Sanbornton Academy in 1842.\n\nShe was received into the Congregational church in Tilton on 26 July 1838 when she was 17, according to church records published by \"McClure's\" in 1907. Eddy had written in her autobiography in 1891 that she was 12 when this happened, and that she had discussed the idea of predestination with the pastor during the examination for her membership; this may have been an attempt to reflect the story of a 12-year-old Jesus in the Temple. She wrote in response to the \"McClure's\" article that the date of her church membership may have been mistaken by her. Eddy objected so strongly to the idea of predestination and eternal damnation that it made her ill:\n\nEddy was badly affected by four deaths in the 1840s. She regarded her brother Albert as a teacher and mentor, but he died in 1841. In 1844, her first husband George Washington Glover (a friend of her brother Samuel's) died after six months of marriage. They had married in December 1843 and set up home in Charleston, South Carolina, where Glover had business, but he died of yellow fever in June 1844 while living in Wilmington, North Carolina. Eddy was with him in Wilmington, six months pregnant. She had to make her way back to New Hampshire, 1,400 miles by train and steamboat, where her only child George Washington II was born on 12 September in her father's home.\n\nHer husband's death, the journey back, and the birth left her physically and mentally exhausted, and she ended up bedridden for months. She tried to earn a living by writing articles for the New Hampshire \"Patriot\" and various Odd Fellows and Masonic publications. She also worked as a substitute teacher in the New Hampshire Conference Seminary, and ran her own kindergarten for a few months in 1846, apparently refusing to use corporal punishment.\n\nThen her mother died in November 1849. Eddy wrote to one of her brothers: \"What is left of earth to \"me\"!\" Her mother's death was followed three weeks later by the death of her fiancé, lawyer John Bartlett. In 1850, Eddy wrote, her son was sent away to be looked after by the family's nurse; he was four years old by then. Sources differ as to whether Eddy could have prevented this. It was difficult for a woman in her circumstances to earn money and, according to the legal doctrine of coverture, women in the United States during this period could not be their own children's guardians. When their husbands died, they were left in a legally vulnerable position.\nMark Baker remarried in 1850; his second wife Elizabeth Patterson Duncan (d. 6 June 1875) had been widowed twice, and had some property and income from her second marriage. Baker apparently made clear to Eddy that her son would not be welcome in the new marital home. She wrote:\n\nGeorge was sent to stay with various relatives, and Eddy decided to live with her sister Abigail. Abigail apparently also declined to take George, then six years old. Eddy married again in 1853. Her second husband, Daniel Patterson, was a dentist and apparently said that he would become George's legal guardian; but he appears not to have gone ahead with this, and Eddy lost contact with her son when the family that looked after him, the Cheneys, moved to Minnesota, and then her son several years later enlisted in the Union army during the Civil War. She did not see him again until he was in his thirties:\n\nIn October 1862, Eddy became a patient of Phineas Quimby, a magnetic healer from Maine. From 1862 to 1865, Quimby and Eddy engaged in lengthy discussions about healing methods practiced by Quimby and others. The extent to which he influenced her is much debated. Originally, Eddy gave Quimby much credit for his hypnotic treatments of her nervous and physical conditions and initially thought his brand of mesmerism entirely benign.\n\nQuimby was steeped both in the Protestant Christianity of his time and the science of the industrial revolution. He wrote in 1864, \"The wise man, in like measure ... knows that the light of the body or natural man is but the reflection of the scientific man. Our misery lies in this darkness. This is the prison that holds the natural man, till the light of Wisdom bursts his bonds, and lets the captive free. Here is where Christ went to preach to the prisoners bound by error before the reformation of science.\" In a letter to the \"Portland Evening Courier\" in November 1862, Eddy wrote:\n\nShe wrote in a letter in 1864, \"I am up and about today, i.e., by the help of the Lord.\" Eddy denied mesmerism in another letter to the \"Portland Evening Courier\", claiming that Christ was the cure:\n\nQuimby had his own notions concerning the nature of these unseen forces which Eddy accepted early on, but she later drew decidedly different opinions on the nature of thought on the body and rejected any form of hypnotism. It is evident that Eddy and Quimby worked together, appreciated one another, and learned from one another. Quimby reportedly later said that he learned more from Eddy than she did from him. Eddy clearly respected him and, at one point, referred to him as an \"advanced thinker\" with a \"high and noble character.\" However, she later disavowed the hypnotic aspect of Quimby's methods. She refutes hypnotism in \"Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,\" calling it mere deception practiced by those who aim to control the patient. She states, \"The Christian Scientist demonstrates that divine Mind heals, while the hypnotist dispossesses the patient of his individuality in order to control him.\"\n\nEddy experienced a healing on February 4, 1866, after she slipped and fell on some ice while walking in Swampscott, Massachusetts on February 1 causing a spinal injury:\n\nShe later filed a claim for money from the city of Lynn for her injury on the grounds that she was \"still suffering from the effects of that fall\" (though she afterwards withdrew the lawsuit). Gill writes that Eddy's claim was probably made under financial pressure from her husband at the time. Her neighbors believed her sudden recovery to be a near-miracle. Eddy's attending physician Alvin M. Cushing, a homeopath, testified under oath that he \"did not at any time declare, or believe, that there was no hope for Mrs. Patterson's recovery, or that she was in critical condition.\"\n\nEddy wrote in her autobiography, \"Retrospection and Introspection\", that she devoted the next three years of her life to biblical study and what she considered the discovery of Christian Science: \"I then withdrew from society about three years,--to ponder my mission, to search the Scriptures, to find the Science of Mind that should take the things of God and show them to the creature, and reveal the great curative Principle, --Deity.\"\n\nEddy became convinced that illness could be healed through an awakened thought brought about by a clearer perception of God and the explicit rejection of drugs, hygiene, and medicine, based on the observation that Jesus did not use these methods for healing:\n\nEddy separated from her second husband Daniel Patterson, after which she boarded for four years with several families in Lynn, Amesbury, and elsewhere. Frank Podmore wrote:\n\nEddy clearly distinguished Christian Science from Spiritualism in a chapter in Science and Health entitled Christian Science versus Spiritualism. According to Robert Peel, Eddy gave a public talk opposing Spiritualism in Warren, Maine in the spring of 1864. Hiram Crafts, a student of hers, stated in an affidavit: \"At that date I was a Spiritualist, but her teachings changed my views on that subject and I gave up spiritualism.\"\n\nAfter she became well known, reports surfaced that Eddy was a medium in Boston at one time. At the time when she was said to be a medium there, she lived some distance away. She was also bedridden during that time. Peel has been challenged by other researchers who write that Eddy acted as a trance channeler and worked in and around Boston as a Spiritualist medium giving public séances for money.\n\nAccording to Gill, Eddy knew spiritualists and took part in some of their activities, but was never a convinced believer. For example, she visited her friend Sarah Crosby in 1864, who believed in Spiritualism. Eddy attempted to show Crosby the folly of it by pretending to channel Eddy's brother Albert and writing letters which she attributed to him.\n\nBetween 1866 and 1870, Eddy boarded at the home of Brene Paine Clark who was interested in Spiritualism. Seances were often conducted there, but Eddy and Clark engaged in vigorous, good-natured arguments about them. Eddy's arguments against Spiritualism convinced at least one other who was there at the time—Hiram Crafts—that \"her science was far superior to spirit teachings.\" Clark's son George tried to convince Eddy to take up Spiritualism, but he said that she abhorred the idea. According to Cather and Milmine, Mrs. Richard Hazeltine attended seances at Clark's home, and she said that Eddy had acted as a trance medium, claiming to channel the spirits of the Apostles. Eddy was also known for channeling messages from the dead brother of her friend Sarah Crosby. According to Martin Gardner, Eddy's mediumship converted Crosby to Spiritualism.\n\nMary Gould, a Spiritualist from Lynn, claimed that one of the spirits that Eddy channeled was Abraham Lincoln. According to eyewitness reports cited by Cather and Milmine, Eddy was still attending séances as late as 1872. In these later séances, Eddy would attempt to convert her audience into accepting Christian Science. Eddy showed extensive familiarity with Spiritualist practice but denounced it in her Christian Science writings. Historian Ann Braude wrote that there were similarities between Spiritualism and Christian Science, but the main difference was that Eddy came to believe, after she founded Christian Science, that spirit manifestations had never really had bodies to begin with, because matter is unreal and that all that really exists is spirit, before and after death.\n\nEddy divorced Daniel Patterson for adultery in 1873. She published her work in 1875 in a book entitled \"Science and Health\" (years later retitled \"Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures\") which she called the textbook of Christian Science, after several years of offering her healing method. The first publication run was 1,000 copies, which she self-published. During these years, she taught what she considered the science of \"primitive Christianity\" to at least 800 people. Many of her students became healers themselves. The last 100 pages of \"Science and Health\" (chapter entitled \"Fruitage\") contains testimonies of people who claimed to have been healed by reading her book. She made numerous revisions to her book from the time of its first publication until shortly before her death.\n\nIn 1877, she married Asa Gilbert Eddy; in 1882, they moved to Boston, and he died that year.\n\nPhineas Quimby by 1859 had connected his healing practices with the Christ of the New Testament. He also called his method of healing the \"science of health\" and the \"science of Christ,\" and had used the term \"Christian Science\" to describe his work. According to the historian of science James C. Whorton, \"In Quimby's mind, Christ and science were synonymous; his method of healing he thus called the Science of Christ and even, toward the close of his life, \"Christian Science.\"\n\nSeveral writers, including Willa Cather and Georgine Milmine in \"McClure's\", and Martin Gardner, have written that Eddy took many of her ideas from Quimby without giving him any kind of credit. Todd Jay Leonard summarized the controversy:\n\nEddy found that while at first hypnotism seemed to benefit the patient, it later created more problems than the original sickness. Ultimately she rejected any form of hypnotism or mesmerism, stating: \"The hypnotizer employs one error to destroy another. If he heals sickness through a belief, and a belief originally caused the sickness, it is a case of the greater error overcoming the lesser. This greater error thereafter occupies the ground, leaving the case worse than before it was grasped by the stronger error.\"\n\nIn the 24th edition of \"Science and Health\", up to the 33rd edition, Eddy admitted the harmony between Vedanta philosophy and Christian Science. She also quoted certain passages from an English translation of the Bhagavad Gita, but they were later removed. According to Gill, in the 1891 revision Eddy removed from her book all the references to Eastern religions which her editor, Reverend James Henry Wiggin, had introduced. On this issue Swami Abhedananda wrote:\n\nOther writers, such as Jyotirmayananda Saraswati, have said that Eddy may have been influenced by ancient Hindu philosophy. The historian Damodar Singhal wrote:\n\nWendell Thomas in \"Hinduism Invades America\" (1930) suggested that Eddy may have discovered Hinduism through the teachings of the New England Transcendentalists such as Bronson Alcott. Stephen Gottschalk, in his \"The Emergence of Christian Science in American Religious Life\" (1973), wrote:\n\nIn regards to the influence of Eastern religions on her discovery of Christian Science, Eddy states in \"The First Church of Christ, Scientist and Miscellany\": \"Think not that Christian Science tends towards Buddhism or any other 'ism'. Per contra, Christian Science destroys such tendency.\"\n\nEddy devoted the rest of her life to the establishment of the church, writing its bylaws, \"The Manual of The Mother Church\", and revising \"Science and Health\". By the 1870s she was telling her students, \"Some day I will have a church of my own.\" In 1879 she and her students established the Church of Christ, Scientist, \"to commemorate the word and works of our Master [Jesus], which should reinstate primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing.\" In 1892 at Eddy's direction, the church reorganized as The First Church of Christ, Scientist, \"designed to be built on the Rock, Christ...\" In 1881, she founded the Massachusetts Metaphysical College, where she taught approximately 800 students between the years 1882 and 1889, when she closed it. Eddy charged her students $300 each for tuition. This was a large sum for the period and generated considerable controversy.\n\nHer students spread across the country practicing healing, and instructing others. Eddy authorized these students to list themselves as Christian Science Practitioners in the church's periodical, \"The Christian Science Journal\". She also founded the \"Christian Science Sentinel\", a weekly magazine with articles about how to heal and testimonies of healing.\n\nIn 1888, a reading room selling Bibles, her writings and other publications opened in Boston. This model would soon be replicated, and branch churches worldwide maintain more than 1,200 Christian Science Reading Rooms today.\n\nIn 1894 an edifice for The First Church of Christ, Scientist was completed in Boston (The Mother Church). In the early years Eddy served as pastor. In 1895 she ordained the Bible and \"Science and Health\" as the pastor.\n\nEddy founded The Christian Science Publishing Society in 1898, which became the publishing home for numerous publications launched by her and her followers. In 1908, at the age of 87, she founded \"The Christian Science Monitor\", a daily newspaper. She also founded the \"Christian Science Journal\" in 1883, a monthly magazine aimed at the church's members and, in 1898, the \"Christian Science Sentinel\", a weekly religious periodical written for a more general audience, and the \"Herald of Christian Science\", a religious magazine with editions in many languages.\n\nThe converse of mental healing was the use of mental powers to destroy people's health – what Eddy termed \"malicious animal magnetism.\" She was concerned that a new practitioner could inadvertently harm a patient through unenlightened use of their mental powers, and that less scrupulous individuals could use such powers as a weapon.\n\nIn 1872 Eddy had an argument with her student Richard Kennedy and he was expelled from Christian Science. Later she came to believe that he was using mental powers to destroy her so she ordered her students to \"mobilize all their mental energy to combat him\". Eddy also ordered her students to stand outside her bedroom door to protect her from any mental attacks directed at her. In 1882 Eddy publicly claimed that her last husband, Asa Gilbert Eddy, had died of \"mental assassination\". Daniel Spofford was another Christian Scientist expelled by Eddy after she accused him of practicing malicious animal magnetism. According to Eugene V. Gallagher:\n\nThe belief in malicious animal magnetism \"remains a part of the doctrine of Christian Science.\" In an article entitled \"Malicious Animal Magnetism\" published in the \"Christian Science Journal\", February 1889, Eddy wrote that mental assassination was one of the greatest crimes and that anyone practicing it should be put to death by a human executioner. Several persons committed suicide because of the fear of malicious animal magnetism. Mary Tomlinson, a student of Mary Baker Eddy, committed suicide by throwing herself out of a window. Another Christian Scientist Marion Stephens committed suicide by gassing herself in a bathroom.\n\nIn her later years Eddy apparently became paranoid, believing that 50,000 people were trying to kill her by projecting their evil thoughts. Eddy wrote that if she died it would be due to malicious animal magnetism rather than from natural causes.\n\nA diary kept by Calvin Frye, Eddy's personal secretary, suggested that Eddy had a lifelong dependence on morphine. Miranda Rice, a friend and close student of Eddy, told a newspaper in 1906: \"I know that Mrs. Eddy was addicted to morphine in the seventies. She begged me to get some for her. She sent her husband Mr. Eddy for some, and when he failed to get it went herself and got it. She locked herself into her room and for two days excluded every one. She was a slave to morphine.\" Gillian Gill writes that the prescription of morphine was normal medical practice at the time.\n\nBiographers who have described Eddy as a morphine addict include Ernest Sutherland Bates and Edwin Franden Dakin.\n\nEddy recommended to her son that, rather than go against the law of the state, he should have her grandchildren vaccinated. She also paid for a mastectomy for her sister-in-law. Eddy was quoted in the \"New York Herald\" on 1 May 1901: \"Where vaccination is compulsory, let your children be vaccinated, and see that your mind is in such a state that by your prayers vaccination will do the children no harm. So long as Christian Scientists obey the laws, I do not suppose their mental reservations will be thought to matter much.\"\n\nEddy used glasses for several years for very fine print, but later dispensed with them almost entirely. She found she could read fine print with ease. In 1907 Arthur Brisbane interviewed Eddy. At one point he picked up a periodical, selected at random a paragraph, and asked Eddy to read it. According to Brisbane, at the age of eighty six, she read the ordinary magazine type without glasses. Towards the end of her life she was frequently attended by physicians.\n\nIn 1907, in the course of a legal case, four psychiatrists interviewed Eddy, then 86 years old, to determine whether she could manage her own affairs, and concluded that she was able to. Physician Allan McLane Hamilton told \"The New York Times\" that the attacks on Eddy were the result of \"a spirit of religious persecution that has at last quite overreached itself,\" and that \"there seems to be a manifest injustice in taxing so excellent and capable an old lady as Mrs. Eddy with any form of insanity.\"\n\nA 1907 article in the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\" noted that Eddy exhibited hysterical and psychotic behaviour. Psychiatrist Karl Menninger in his book \"The Human Mind\" (1927) cited Eddy's paranoid delusions about malicious animal magnetism as an example of a \"schizoid personality\".\n\nPsychologists Leon Joseph Saul and Silas L. Warner, in their book \"The Psychotic Personality\" (1982), came to the conclusion that Eddy had diagnostic characteristics of Psychotic Personality Disorder (PPD). In 1983, psychologists Theodore Barber and Sheryl C. Wilson suggested that Eddy displayed traits of a fantasy prone personality.\n\nPsychiatrist George Eman Vaillant wrote that Eddy was hypochrondriacal. Psychopharmacologist Ronald K. Siegel has written that Eddy's lifelong secret morphine habit contributed to her development of \"progressive paranoia\".\n\nEddy died on the evening of December 3, 1910 at her home at 400 Beacon Street, in the Chestnut Hill section of Newton, Massachusetts. Her death was announced the next morning, when a city medical examiner was called in. She was buried on December 8, 1910 at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her memorial was designed by New York architect Egerton Swartwout (1870–1943). Hundreds of tributes appeared in newspapers around the world, including \"The Boston Globe\", which wrote, \"She did a wonderful—an extraordinary work in the world and there is no doubt that she was a powerful influence for good.\"\n\nCurrently, there are almost 1,700 Christian Science churches in 76 countries.\n\nFor more than a century, \"The Christian Science Journal\" and the \"Christian Science Sentinel\" have been publishing accounts of restored health based on the system of care that Eddy taught.\n\nIn 1921, on the 100th anniversary of Eddy's birth, a 100-ton (in rough) and 60–70 tons (hewn), pyramid with a 121 square foot footprint was dedicated on the site of her birthplace in Bow, New Hampshire. A gift from James F. Lord, it was dynamited in 1962 by order of the church's board of directors. Also demolished was Eddy's former home in Pleasant View, as the board feared that it was becoming a place of pilgrimage.\n\nSeveral of Eddy's homes are owned and maintained as historic sites by the Longyear Museum and may be visited (the list below is arranged by date of her occupancy):\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3099417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3099417", "title": "Rashtrakuta dynasty", "text": "Rashtrakuta dynasty\n\nRashtrakuta (IAST: \"\") was a royal dynasty ruling large parts of the Indian subcontinent between the sixth and 10th centuries. The earliest known Rashtrakuta inscription is a 7th-century copper plate grant detailing their rule from Manapura, a city in Central or West India. Other ruling Rashtrakuta clans from the same period mentioned in inscriptions were the kings of Achalapur (modern Elichpur in Maharashtra) and the rulers of Kannauj. Several controversies exist regarding the origin of these early Rashtrakutas, their native home and their language.\n\nThe Elichpur clan was a feudatory of the Badami Chalukyas, and during the rule of Dantidurga, it overthrew Chalukya Kirtivarman II and went on to build an empire with the Gulbarga region in modern Karnataka as its base. This clan came to be known as the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta, rising to power in South India in 753. At the same time the Pala dynasty of Bengal and the Prathihara dynasty of Malwa were gaining force in eastern and northwestern India respectively. An Arabic text, \"Silsilat al-Tawarikh\" (851), called the Rashtrakutas one of the four principal empires of the world.\n\nThis period, between the eighth and the 10th centuries, saw a tripartite struggle for the resources of the rich Gangetic plains, each of these three empires annexing the seat of power at Kannauj for short periods of time. At their peak the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta ruled a vast empire stretching from the Ganges River and Yamuna River doab in the north to Cape Comorin in the south, a fruitful time of political expansion, architectural achievements and famous literary contributions. The early kings of this dynasty were influenced by Hinduism and the later kings by Jainism.\n\nDuring their rule, Jain mathematicians and scholars contributed important works in Kannada and Sanskrit. Amoghavarsha I, the most famous king of this dynasty wrote \"Kavirajamarga\", a landmark literary work in the Kannada language. Architecture reached a milestone in the Dravidian style, the finest example of which is seen in the Kailasanath Temple at Ellora in modern Maharashtra. Other important contributions are the Kashivishvanatha temple and the Jain Narayana temple at Pattadakal in modern Karnataka, both of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\nThe origin of the Rashtrakuta dynasty has been a controversial topic of Indian history. These issues pertain to the origin of the earliest ancestors of the Rashtrakutas during the time of Emperor Ashoka in the 2nd century BCE, and the connection between the several Rashtrakuta dynasties that ruled small kingdoms in northern and central India and the Deccan between the 6th and 7th centuries. The relationship of these medieval Rashtrakutas to the most famous later dynasty, the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta (present day Malkhed in the Gulbarga district, Karnataka state), who ruled between the 8th and 10th centuries has also been debated.\n\nThe sources for Rashtrakuta history include medieval inscriptions, ancient literature in the Pali language, contemporaneous literature in Sanskrit and Kannada and the notes of the Arab travellers. Theories about the dynastic lineage (\"Surya Vamsa\"—Solar line and \"Chandra Vamsa\"—Lunar line), the native region and the ancestral home have been proposed, based on information gleaned from inscriptions, royal emblems, the ancient clan names such as \"Rashtrika\", epithets (\"Ratta\", \"Rashtrakuta\", \"Lattalura Puravaradhiswara\"), the names of princes and princesses of the dynasty, and clues from relics such as coins. Scholars debate over which ethnic/linguistic groups can claim the early Rashtrakutas. Possibilities include the north western ethnic groups of India, the Kannadiga, Reddi, the Maratha, or the tribes from the Punjab region.\n\nScholars however concur that the rulers of the imperial dynasty in the 8th to 10th century made the Kannada language as important as Sanskrit. Rashtrakuta inscriptions use both Kannada and Sanskrit (historians Sheldon Pollock and Jan Houben claim they are mostly in Kannada), and the rulers encouraged literature in both languages. The earliest existing Kannada literary writings are credited to their court poets and royalty. Though these Rashtrakutas were Kannadigas, they were conversant in a northern Deccan language as well.\n\nThe heart of the Rashtrakuta empire included nearly all of Karnataka, Maharashtra and parts of Andhra Pradesh, an area which the Rashtrakutas ruled for over two centuries. The Samangadh copper plate grant (753) confirms that the feudatory King Dantidurga, who probably ruled from Achalapura in Berar (modern Elichpur in Maharashtra), defeated the great Karnatic army (referring to the army of the Badami Chalukyas) of Kirtivarman II of Badami in 753 and took control of the northern regions of the Chalukya empire. He then helped his father-in-law, Pallava King Nandivarman regain Kanchi from the Chalukyas and defeated the Gurjaras of Malwa, and the rulers of Kalinga, Kosala and Srisailam.\n\nDantidurga's successor Krishna I brought major portions of present-day Karnataka and Konkan under his control. During the rule of Dhruva Dharavarsha who took control in 780, the kingdom expanded into an empire that encompassed all of the territory between the Kaveri River and Central India. He led successful expeditions to Kannauj, the seat of northern Indian power where he defeated the Gurjara Pratiharas and the Palas of Bengal, gaining him fame and vast booty but not more territory. He also brought the Eastern Chalukyas and Gangas of Talakad under his control. According to Altekar and Sen, the Rashtrakutas became a pan-India power during his rule.\n\nThe ascent of Dhruva Dharavarsha's third son, Govinda III, to the throne heralded an era of success like never before. There is uncertainty about the location of the early capital of the Rashtrakutas at this time. During his rule there was a three way conflict between the Rashtrakutas, the Palas and the Pratiharas for control over the Gangetic plains. Describing his victories over the Pratihara Emperor Nagabhatta II and the Pala Emperor Dharmapala, the Sanjan inscription states the horses of Govinda III drank from the icy waters of the Himalayan streams and his war elephants tasted the sacred waters of the Ganges. His military exploits have been compared to those of Alexander the Great and Arjuna of Mahabharata. Having conquered Kannauj, he travelled south, took firm hold over Gujarat, Kosala (Kaushal), Gangavadi, humbled the Pallavas of Kanchi, installed a ruler of his choice in Vengi and received two statues as an act of submission from the king of Ceylon (one statue of the king and another of his minister). The Cholas, the Pandyas and the Cheras all paid him tribute. As one historian puts it, the drums of the Deccan were heard from the Himalayan caves to the shores of the Malabar. The Rashtrakutas empire now spread over the areas from Cape Comorin to Kannauj and from Banaras to Bharuch.\n\nThe successor of Govinda III, Amoghavarsha I made Manyakheta his capital and ruled a large empire. Manyakheta remained the Rashtrakutas' regal capital until the end of the empire. He came to the throne in 814 but it was not until 821 that he had suppressed revolts from feudatories and ministers. Amoghavarsha I made peace with the Western Ganga dynasty by giving them his two daughters in marriage, and then defeated the invading Eastern Chalukyas at Vingavalli and assumed the title \"Viranarayana\". His rule was not as militant as that of Govinda III as he preferred to maintain friendly relations with his neighbours, the Gangas, the Eastern Chalukyas and the Pallavas with whom he also cultivated marital ties. His era was an enriching one for the arts, literature and religion. Widely seen as the most famous of the Rashtrakuta Emperors, Amoghavarsha I was an accomplished scholar in Kannada and Sanskrit. His \"Kavirajamarga\" is considered an important landmark in Kannada poetics and \"Prashnottara Ratnamalika\" in Sanskrit is a writing of high merit and was later translated into the Tibetan language. Because of his religious temperament, his interest in the arts and literature and his peace-loving nature, he has been compared to the emperor Ashoka and called \"Ashoka of the South\".\n\nDuring the rule of Krishna II, the empire faced a revolt from the Eastern Chalukyas and its size decreased to the area including most of the Western Deccan and Gujarat. Krishna II ended the independent status of the Gujarat branch and brought it under direct control from Manyakheta. Indra III recovered the dynasty's fortunes in central India by defeating the Paramara and then invaded the doab region of the Ganges and Jamuna rivers. He also defeated the dynasty's traditional enemies, the Pratiharas and the Palas, while maintaining his influence over Vengi. The effect of his victories in Kannauj lasted several years according to the 930 copper plate inscription of Emperor Govinda IV. After a succession of weak kings during whose reigns the empire lost control of territories in the north and east, Krishna III the last great ruler consolidated the empire so that it stretched from the Narmada River to Kaveri River and included the northern Tamil country (Tondaimandalam) while levying tribute on the king of Ceylon.\n\nIn 972 A.D., during the rule of Khottiga Amoghavarsha, the Paramara King Siyaka Harsha attacked the empire and plundered Manyakheta, the capital of the Rashtrakutas. This seriously undermined the reputation of the Rastrakuta Empire and consequently led to its downfall. The final decline was sudden as Tailapa II, a feudatory of the Rashtrakuta ruling from Tardavadi province in modern Bijapur district, declared himself independent by taking advantage of this defeat. Indra IV, the last emperor, committed Sallekhana (fasting unto death practised by Jain monks) at Shravanabelagola. With the fall of the Rashtrakutas, their feudatories and related clans in the Deccan and northern India declared independence. The Western Chalukyas annexed Manyakheta and made it their capital until 1015 and built an impressive empire in the Rashtrakuta heartland during the 11th century. The focus of dominance shifted to the Krishna River – Godavari River doab called Vengi. The former feudatories of the Rashtrakutas in western Deccan were brought under control of the Chalukyas, and the hitherto-suppressed Cholas of Tanjore became their arch enemies in the south.\n\nIn conclusion, the rise of Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta had a great impact on India, even on India's north. Sulaiman (851), Al Masudi (944) and Ibn Khurdadba (912) wrote that their empire was the largest in contemporary India and Sulaiman further called it one among the four great contemporary empires of the world. According to the travelogues of the Arabs Al Masudi and Ibn Khordidbih of the 10th century, \"most of the kings of Hindustan turned their faces towards the Rashtrakuta king while they were praying, and they prostrated themselves before his ambassadors. The Rashtrakuta king was known as the \"King of kings\" (\"Rajadhiraja\") who possessed the mightiest of armies and whose domains extended from Konkan to Sind.\" Some historians have called these times an \"Age of Imperial Kannauj\". Since the Rashtrakutas successfully captured Kannauj, levied tribute on its rulers and presented themselves as masters of North India, the era could also be called the \"Age of Imperial Karnataka\". During their political expansion into central and northern India in the 8th to the 10th centuries, the Rashtrakutas or their relatives created several kingdoms that either ruled during the reign of the parent empire or continued to rule for centuries after its fall or came to power much later. Well-known among these were the Rashtrakutas of Gujarat (757–888), the Rattas of Saundatti (875–1230) in modern Karnataka, the Gahadavalas of Kannauj (1068–1223), the Rashtrakutas of Rajasthan (known as Rajputana) and ruling from Hastikundi or Hathundi (893–996), Dahal (near Jabalpur), Mandore (near Jodhpur), the Rathores of Dhanop, Rashtraudha dynasty of Mayuragiri in modern Maharashtra and Rashtrakutas of Kannauj. Rajadhiraja Chola's conquest of the island of Ceylon in the early 11th century CE led to the fall of four kings there. According to historian K. Pillay, one of them, King Madavarajah of the Jaffna kingdom, was an usurper from the Rashtrakuta Dynasty.\n\nInscriptions and other literary records indicate the Rashtrakutas selected the crown prince based on heredity. The crown did not always pass on to the eldest son. Abilities were considered more important than age and chronology of birth, as exemplified by the crowning of Govinda III who was the third son of king Dhruva Dharavarsha. The most important position under the king was the Chief Minister (\"Mahasandhivigrahi\") whose position came with five insignia commensurate with his position namely, a flag, a conch, a fan, a white umbrella, a large drum and five musical instruments called \"Panchamahashabdas\". Under him was the commander (\"Dandanayaka\"), the foreign minister (\"Mahakshapataladhikrita\") and a prime minister (\"Mahamatya\" or \"Purnamathya\"), all of whom were usually associated with one of the feudatory kings and must have held a position in government equivalent to a premier. A \"Mahasamantha\" was a feudatory or higher ranking regal officer. All cabinet ministers were well versed in political science (\"Rajneeti\") and possessed military training. There were cases where women supervised significant areas as when Revakanimaddi, daughter of Amoghavarsha I, administered Edathore \"Vishaya\".\n\nThe kingdom was divided into \"Mandala\" or \"Rashtras\" (provinces). A \"Rashtra\" was ruled by a Rashtrapathi who on occasion was the emperor himself. Amoghavarsha I's empire had sixteen \"Rashtras\". Under a \"Rashtra\" was a \"Vishaya\" (district) overseen by a Vishayapathi. Trusted ministers sometimes ruled more than a \"Rashtra\". For example, Bankesha, a commander of Amoghavarsha I headed Banavasi-12000, Belvola-300, Puligere-300, Kunduru-500 and Kundarge-70, the suffix designating the number of villages in that territory. Below the \"Vishaya\" was the \"Nadu\" looked after by the Nadugowda or Nadugavunda; sometimes there were two such officials, one assuming the position through heredity and another appointed centrally. The lowest division was a \"Grama\" or village administered by a \"Gramapathi\" or \"Prabhu Gavunda\".\n\nThe Rashtrakuta army consisted of large contingents of infantry, horsemen, and elephants. A standing army was always ready for war in a cantonment (\"Sthirabhuta Kataka\") in the regal capital of Manyakheta. Large armies were also maintained by the feudatory kings who were expected to contribute to the defense of the empire in case of war. Chieftains and all the officials also served as commanders whose postings were transferable if the need arose.\n\nThe Rashtrakutas issued coins (minted in an \"Akkashale\") such as \"Suvarna\", \"Drammas\" in silver and gold weighing 65 grains, \"Kalanju\" weighing 48 grains, \"Gadyanaka\" weighing 96 grains, \"Kasu\" weighing 15 grains, \"Manjati\" with 2.5 grains and \"Akkam\" of 1.25 grain.\n\nThe Rashtrakuta economy was sustained by its natural and agricultural produce, its manufacturing revenues and moneys gained from its conquests. Cotton was the chief crop of the regions of southern Gujarat, Khandesh and Berar. Minnagar, Gujarat, Ujjain, Paithan and Tagara were important centres of textile industry. Muslin cloth were manufactured in Paithan and Warangal. The cotton yarn and cloth was exported from Bharoch. White calicos were manufactured in Burhanpur and Berar and exported to Persia, Turkey, Poland, Arabia and Egypt. The Konkan region, ruled by the feudatory Silharas, produced large quantities of betel leaves, coconut and rice while the lush forests of Mysore, ruled by the feudatory Gangas, produced such woods as sandal, timber, teak and ebony. Incense and perfumes were exported from the ports of Thana and Saimur.\n\nThe Deccan was rich in minerals, though its soil was not as fertile as that of the Gangetic plains. The copper mines of Cudappah, Bellary, Chanda, Buldhana, Narsingpur, Ahmadnagar, Bijapur and Dharwar were an important source of income and played an important role in the economy. Diamonds were mined in Cudappah, Bellary, Kurnool and Golconda; the capital Manyakheta and Devagiri were important diamond and jewellery trading centres. The leather industry and tanning flourished in Gujarat and some regions of northern Maharashtra. Mysore with its vast elephant herds was important for the ivory industry.\n\nThe Rashtrakuta empire controlled most of the western sea board of the subcontinent which facilitated its maritime trade. The Gujarat branch of the empire earned a significant income from the port of Bharoch, one of the most prominent ports in the world at that time. The empire's chief exports were cotton yarn, cotton cloth, muslins, hides, mats, indigo, incense, perfumes, betel nuts, coconuts, sandal, teak, timber, sesame oil and ivory. Its major imports were pearls, gold, dates from Arabia, slaves, Italian wines, tin, lead, topaz, storax, sweet clover, flint glass, antimony, gold and silver coins, singing boys and girls (for the entertainment of the royalty) from other lands. Trading in horses was an important and profitable business, monopolised by the Arabs and some local merchants. The Rashtrakuta government levied a shipping tax of one golden \"Gadyanaka\" on all foreign vessels embarking to any other ports and a fee of one silver \"Ctharna\" ( a coin) on vessels travelling locally.\n\nArtists and craftsman operated as corporations (guilds) rather than as individual business. Inscriptions mention guilds of weavers, oilmen, artisans, basket and mat makers and fruit sellers. A Saundatti inscription refers to an assemblage of all the people of a district headed by the guilds of the region. Some guilds were considered superior to others, just as some corporations were, and received royal charters determining their powers and privileges. Inscriptions suggest these guilds had their own militia to protect goods in transit and, like village assemblies, they operated banks that lent money to traders and businesses.\n\nThe government's income came from five principal sources: regular taxes, occasional taxes, fines, income taxes, miscellaneous taxes and tributes from feudatories. An emergency tax was imposed occasionally and were applicable when the kingdom was under duress, such as when it faced natural calamities, or was preparing for war or overcoming war's ravages. Income tax included taxes on crown land, wasteland, specific types of trees considered valuable to the economy, mines, salt, treasures unearthed by prospectors. Additionally, customary presents were given to the king or royal officers on such festive occasions as marriage or the birth of a son.\n\nThe king determined the tax levels based on need and circumstances in the kingdom while ensuring that an undue burden was not placed on the peasants. The land owner or tenant paid a variety of taxes, including land taxes, produce taxes and payment of the overhead for maintenance of the Gavunda (village head). Land taxes were varied, based on type of land, its produce and situation and ranged from 8% to 16%. A Banavasi inscription of 941 mentions reassessment of land tax due to the drying up of an old irrigation canal in the region. The land tax may have been as high as 20% to pay for expenses of a military frequently at war. In most of the kingdom, land taxes were paid in goods and services and rarely was cash accepted. A portion of all taxes earned by the government (usually 15%) was returned to the villages for maintenance.\n\nTaxes were levied on artisans such as potters, sheep herders, weavers, oilmen, shopkeepers, stall owners, brewers and gardeners. Taxes on perishable items such as fish, meat, honey, medicine, fruits and essentials like fuel was as high as 16%. Taxes on salt and minerals were mandatory although the empire did not claim sole ownership of mines, implying that private mineral prospecting and the quarrying business may have been active. The state claimed all such properties whose deceased legal owner had no immediate family to make an inheritance claim. Other miscellaneous taxes included ferry and house taxes. Only Brahmins and their temple institutions were taxed at a lower rate.\n\nThe Rashtrakuta kings supported the popular religions of the day in the traditional spirit of religious tolerance. Scholars have offered various arguments regarding which specific religion the Rashtrakutas favoured, basing their evidence on inscriptions, coins and contemporary literature. Some claim the Rashtrakutas were inclined towards Jainism since many of the scholars who flourished in their courts and wrote in Sanskrit, Kannada and a few in Apabhramsha and Prakrit were Jains. The Rashtrakutas built well-known Jain temples at locations such as Lokapura in Bagalkot district and their loyal feudatory, the Western Ganga Dynasty, built Jain monuments at Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli. Scholars have suggested that Jainism was a principal religion at the very heart of the empire, modern Karnataka, accounting for more than 30% of the population and dominating the culture of the region. King Amoghavarsha I was a disciple of the Jain acharya Jinasena and wrote in his religious writing, \"Prashnottara Ratnamalika\", \"having bowed to Varaddhamana (Mahavira), I write Prashnottara Ratnamalika\". The mathematician Mahaviracharya wrote in his \"Ganita Sarasangraha\", \"The subjects under Amoghavarsha are happy and the land yields plenty of grain. May the kingdom of King Nripatunga Amoghavarsha, follower of Jainism ever increase far and wide.\" Amoghavarsha may have taken up Jainism in his old age.\n\nHowever, the Rashtrakuta kings also patronized Hinduism's followers of the Shaiva, Vaishnava and Shakta faiths. Almost all of their inscriptions begin with an invocation to god Vishnu or god Shiva. The Sanjan inscriptions tell of King Amoghavarsha I sacrificing a finger from his left hand at the Lakshmi temple at Kolhapur to avert a calamity in his kingdom. King Dantidurga performed the \"Hiranyagarbha\" (horse sacrifice) and the Sanjan and Cambay plates of King Govinda IV mention Brahmins performing such rituals as \"Rajasuya\", \"Vajapeya\" and \"Agnishtoma\". An early copper plate grant of King Dantidurga (753) shows an image of god Shiva and the coins of his successor, King Krishna I (768), bear the legend \"Parama Maheshwara\" (another name for Shiva). The kings' titles such as \"Veeranarayana\" showed their Vaishnava leanings. Their flag had the sign of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers, perhaps copied from the Badami Chalukyas. The famous Kailasnatha temple at Ellora and other rock-cut caves attributed to them show that the Hinduism was flourishing. Their family deity was a goddess by name \"Latana\" (also known as \"Rashtrashyena\", \"Manasa\" \"Vindyavasini\") who took the form of a falcon to save the kingdom. They built temples with icons and ornamentation that satisfied the needs of different faiths. The temple at Salotgi was meant for followers of Shiva and Vishnu and the temple at Kargudri was meant for worshipers of Shiva, Vishnu and Bhaskara (Surya, the sun god).\n\nIn short, the Rashtrakuta rule was tolerant to multiple popular religions, Jainism, Vaishnavaism and Shaivism. Buddhism too found support and was popular in places such as Dambal and Balligavi, although it had declined significantly by this time. The decline of Buddhism in South India began in the 8th century with the spread of Adi Shankara's Advaita philosophy. Islamic contact with South India began as early as the 7th century, a result of trade between the Southern kingdoms and Arab lands. Jumma Masjids existed in the Rashtrakuta empire by the 10th century and many Muslims lived and mosques flourished on the coasts, specifically in towns such as Kayalpattanam and Nagore. Muslim settlers married local women; their children were known as Mappilas (\"Moplahs\") and were actively involved in horse trading and manning shipping fleets.\n\nChronicles mention more castes than the four commonly known castes in the Hindu social system, some as many as seven castes. One traveller's account mentions sixteen castes including the four basic castes of Brahmins, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Sudras. The \"Zakaya\" or \"Lahud\" caste consisted of communities specialising in dance and acrobatics. People in the professions of sailing, hunting, weaving, cobblery, basket making and fishing belonged to specific castes or subcastes. The \"Antyajas\" caste provided many menial services to the wealthy. Brahmins enjoyed the highest status in Rashtrakuta society; only those Kshatriyas in the \"Sat-Kshatriya\" sub-caste (noble Kshatriyas) were higher in status.\n\nThe careers of Brahmins usually related to education, the judiciary, astrology, mathematics, poetry and philosophy or the occupation of hereditary administrative posts. Also Brahmins increasingly practiced non-Brahminical professions (agriculture, trade in betel nuts and martial posts). Capital punishment, although widespread, was not given to the royal Kshatriya sub-castes or to Brahmins found guilty of heinous crimes (as the killing of a Brahmin in medieval Hindu India was itself considered a heinous crime). As an alternate punishment to enforce the law a Brahmin's right hand and left foot was severed, leaving that person disabled.\n\nBy the 9th century, kings from all the four castes had occupied the highest seat in the monarchical system in Hindu India. Admitting Kshatriyas to Vedic schools along with Brahmins was customary, but the children of the Vaishya and Shudra castes were not allowed. Landownership by people of all castes is recorded in inscriptions Intercaste marriages in the higher castes were only between highly placed Kshatriya girls and Brahmin boys, but was relatively frequent among other castes. Intercaste functions were rare and dining together between people of various castes was avoided.\n\nJoint families were the norm but legal separations between brothers and even father and son have been recorded in inscriptions. Women and daughters had rights over property and land as there are inscriptions recording the sale of land by women. The arranged marriage system followed a strict policy of early marriage for women. Among Brahmins, boys married at or below 16 years of age and the brides chosen for them were 12 or younger. This age policy was not strictly followed by other castes. Sati (a custom in which a dead man's widow would immolate herself on her husband's funeral pyre) was practiced but the few examples noted in inscriptions were mostly in the royal families. The system of shaving the heads of widows was infrequent as epigraphs note that widows were allowed to grow their hair but decorating it was discouraged. The remarriage of a widow was rare among the upper castes and more accepted among the lower castes.\n\nIn the general population men wore two simple pieces of cloth, a loose garment on top and a garment worn like a \"dhoti\" for the lower part of the body. Only kings could wear turbans, a practice that spread to the masses much later. Dancing was a popular entertainment and inscriptions speak of royal women being charmed by dancers, both male and female, in the king's palace. Devadasis (girls were \"married\" to a deity or temple) were often present in temples. Other recreational activities included attending animal fights of the same or different species. The Atakur inscription (hero stone, \"virgal\") was made for the favourite hound of the feudatory Western Ganga King Butuga II that died fighting a wild boar in a hunt. There are records of game preserves for hunting by royalty. Astronomy and astrology were well developed as subjects of study, and there were many superstitious beliefs such as catching a snake alive proved a woman's chastity. Old persons suffering from incurable diseases preferred to end their lives by drowning in the sacred waters of a pilgrim site or by a ritual burning.\n\nKannada became more prominent as a literary language during the Rashtrakuta rule with its script and literature showing remarkable growth, dignity and productivity. This period effectively marked the end of the classical Prakrit and Sanskrit era. Court poets and royalty created eminent works in Kannada and Sanskrit that spanned such literary forms as prose, poetry, rhetoric, the Hindu epics and the life history of Jain tirthankars. Bilingual writers such as Asaga gained fame, and noted scholars such as the Mahaviracharya wrote on pure mathematics in the court of King Amoghavarsha I.\n\n\"Kavirajamarga\" (850) by King Amoghavarsha I is the earliest available book on rhetoric and poetics in Kannada, though it is evident from this book that native styles of Kannada composition had already existed in previous centuries. \"Kavirajamarga\" is a guide to poets (\"Kavishiksha\") that aims to standardize these various styles. The book refers to early Kannada prose and poetry writers such as Durvinita, perhaps the 6th-century monarch of Western Ganga Dynasty.\n\nThe Jain writer Adikavi Pampa, widely regarded as one of the most influential Kannada writers, became famous for \"Adipurana\" (941). Written in champu (mixed prose-verse style) style, it is the life history of the first Jain \"tirthankara\" Rishabhadeva. Pampa's other notable work was \"Vikramarjuna Vijaya\" (941), the author's version of the Hindu epic, Mahabharata, with Arjuna as the hero. Also called \"Pampa Bharata\", it is a eulogy of the writer's patron, King Chalukya Arikeseri of Vemulawada (a Rashtrakuta feudatory), comparing the king's virtues favorably to those of Arjuna. Pampa demonstrates such a command of classical Kannada that scholars over the centuries have written many interpretations of his work.\n\nAnother notable Jain writer in Kannada was Sri Ponna, patronised by King Krishna III and famed for \"Shantipurana\", his account of the life of Shantinatha, the 16th Jain tirthankara. He earned the title \"Ubhaya Kavichakravathi\" (supreme poet in two languages) for his command over both Kannada and Sanskrit. His other writings in Kannada were \"Bhuvanaika-ramaabhyudaya\", \"Jinaksharamale\" and \"Gatapratyagata\". Adikavi Pampa and Sri Ponna are called \"gems of Kannada literature\".\nProse works in Sanskrit was prolific during this era as well. Important mathematical theories and axioms were postulated by Mahaviracharya, a native of Gulbarga, who belonged to the Karnataka mathematical tradition and was patronised by King Amoghavarsha I. His greatest contribution was \"Ganitasarasangraha\", a writing in 9 chapters. Somadevasuri of 950 wrote in the court of Arikesari II, a feudatory of Rashtrakuta Krishna III in Vemulavada. He was the author of \"Yasastilaka champu\", \"Nitivakyamrita\" and other writings. The main aim of the \"champu\" writing was to propagate Jain tenets and ethics. The second writing reviews the subject matter of \"Arthashastra\" from the standpoint of Jain morals in a clear and pithy manner. Ugraditya, a Jain ascetic from Hanasoge in the modern Mysore district wrote a medical treatise called \"Kalyanakaraka\". He delivered a discourse in the court of Amoghavarsha I encouraging abstinence from animal products and alcohol in medicine.\n\nTrivikrama was a noted scholar in the court of King Indra III. His classics were \"Nalachampu\" (915), the earliest in champu style in Sanskrit, \"Damayanti Katha\", \"Madalasachampu\" and Begumra plates. Legend has it that Goddess Saraswati helped him in his effort to compete with a rival in the king's court. Jinasena was the spiritual preceptor and guru of Amoghavarsha I. A theologian, his contributions are \"Dhavala\" and \"Jayadhavala\" (written with another theologian Virasena). These writings are named after their patron king who was also called Athishayadhavala. Other contributions from Jinasena were \"Adipurana,\" later completed by his disciple Gunabhadra, \"Harivamsha\" and \"Parshvabhyudaya\".\n\nThe Rashtrakutas contributed much to the architectural heritage of the Deccan. Art historian Adam Hardy categorizes their building activity into three schools: Ellora, around Badami, Aihole and Pattadakal, and at Sirval near Gulbarga.\nThe Rashtrakuta contributions to art and architecture are reflected in the splendid rock-cut cave temples at Ellora and Elephanta, areas also occupied by Jain monks, located in present-day Maharashtra. The Ellora site was originally part of a complex of 34 Buddhist caves probably created in the first half of the 6th century whose structural details show Pandyan influence. Cave temples occupied by Hindus are from later periods.\n\nThe Rashtrakutas renovated these Buddhist caves and re-dedicated the rock-cut shrines. Amoghavarsha I espoused Jainism and there are five Jain cave temples at Ellora ascribed to his period. The most extensive and sumptuous of the Rashtrakuta works at Ellora is their creation of the monolithic Kailasanath Temple, a splendid achievement confirming the \"Balhara\" status as \"one among the four principal Kings of the world\". The walls of the temple have marvellous sculptures from Hindu mythology including Ravana, Shiva and Parvathi while the ceilings have paintings.\n\nThe Kailasanath Temple project was commissioned by King Krishna I after the Rashtrakuta rule had spread into South India from the Deccan. The architectural style used is \"Karnata Dravida\" according to Adam Hardy. It does not contain any of the \"Shikharas\" common to the \"Nagara\" style and was built on the same lines as the Virupaksha temple at Pattadakal in Karnataka. According to art historian Vincent Smith, the achievement at the Kailasanath temple is considered an architectural consummation of the monolithic rock-cut temple and deserves to be considered one of the wonders of the world. According to art historian Percy Brown, as an accomplishment of art, the Kailasanath temple is considered an unrivalled work of rock architecture, a monument that has always excited and astonished travellers.While some scholars have claimed the architecture at Elephanta is attributable to the Kalachuri, others claim that it was built during the Rashtrakuta period. Some of the sculptures such as \"Nataraja\" and \"Sadashiva\" excel in beauty and craftsmanship even that of the Ellora sculptures. Famous sculptures at Elephanta include \"Ardhanarishvara\" and \"Maheshamurthy\". The latter, a three faced bust of Lord Shiva, is tall and considered one of the finest pieces of sculpture in India. It is said that, in the world of sculpture, few works of art depicting a divinity are as balanced. Other famous rock-cut temples in the Maharashtra region are the Dhumer Lena and Dashvatara cave temples in Ellora (famous for its sculptures of Vishnu and Shivaleela) and the Jogeshvari temple near Mumbai.\nIn Karnataka their most famous temples are the \"Kashivishvanatha\" temple and the Jain Narayana temple at Pattadakal, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Other well-known temples are the Parameshwara temple at Konnur, Brahmadeva temple at Savadi, the Settavva, Kontigudi II, Jadaragudi and Ambigeragudi temples at Aihole, Mallikarjuna temple at Ron, Andhakeshwara temple at Huli (Hooli), Someshwara temple at Sogal, Jain temples at Lokapura, Navalinga temple at Kuknur, Kumaraswamy temple at Sandur, numerous temples at Shirival in Gulbarga, and the \"Trikuteshwara\" temple at Gadag which was later expanded by Kalyani Chalukyas. Archeological study of these temples show some have the stellar (multigonal) plan later to be used profusely by the Hoysalas at Belur and Halebidu. One of the richest traditions in Indian architecture took shape in the Deccan during this time which Adam Hardy calls \"Karnata dravida\" style as opposed to traditional Dravida style.\n\nWith the ending of the Gupta Dynasty in northern India in the early 6th century, major changes began taking place in the Deccan south of the Vindyas and in the southern regions of India. These changes were not only political but also linguistic and cultural. The royal courts of peninsular India (outside of Tamilakam) interfaced between the increasing use of the local Kannada language and the expanding Sanskritic culture. Inscriptions, including those that were bilingual, demonstrate the use of Kannada as the primary administrative language in conjunction with Sanskrit. Government archives used Kannada for recording pragmatic information relating to grants of land. The local language formed the \"desi\" (popular) literature while literature in Sanskrit was more \"marga\" (formal). Educational institutions and places of higher learning (\"ghatikas\") taught in Sanskrit, the language of the learned Brahmins, while Kannada increasingly became the speech of personal expression of devotional closeness of a worshipper to a private deity. The patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains eventually led to its use in the devotional movements of later centuries.\n\nContemporaneous literature and inscriptions show that Kannada was not only popular in the modern Karnataka region but had spread further north into present day southern Maharashtra and to the northern Deccan by the 8th century. Kavirajamarga, the work on poetics, refers to the entire region between the Kaveri River and the Godavari River as \"Kannada country\". Higher education in Sanskrit included the subjects of Veda, \"Vyakarana\" (grammar), \"Jyotisha\" (astronomy and astrology), \"Sahitya\" (literature), \"Mimansa\" (Exegesis), \"Dharmashastra\" (law), \"Puranas\" (ritual), and \"Nyaya\" (logic). An examination of inscriptions from this period shows that the \"Kavya\" (classical) style of writing was popular. The awareness of the merits and defects in inscriptions by the archivists indicates that even they, though mediocre poets, had studied standard classical literature in Sanskrit. An inscription in Kannada by King Krishna III, written in a poetic Kanda metre, has been found as far away as Jabalpur in modern Madhya Pradesh. Kavirajamarga, a work on poetics in Kannada by Amoghavarsha I, shows that the study of poetry was popular in the Deccan during this time. Trivikrama's Sanskrit writing, \"Nalachampu\", is perhaps the earliest in the \"champu\" style from the Deccan.\n\n\nBooks\n\nWeb\n\n"}

She is the new Eve, who cannot eliminate the damage created by Eve, but limit it. Her fullness of grace, her position among the disciples of Christ and her title as Mother of God are seen as assurances that the Virgin Mary is a powerful intercessor.\n\nRefugium Peccatorum is one part of four Marian advocations in the Litany of Loreto, the others being \"Salus Infirmorum\" (healer of the sick) \"Consolatrix Afflictorum\" (consoler of the sad) and \"Auxilium Christianorum\" (help of Christians). Each advocation extolling Mary’s role as advocate for spiritual and corporeal mercy has a rich history, but in general, the notion of asking the Blessed Virgin Mary for help in temporal needs dates back to Saints Justin Martyr, Irenaeus and Ambrose of Milan.\n\nThe Archconfraternity of the \"Immaculate Heart of Mary, Refuge of Sinners\" was established at Notre-Dame-des-Victoires in the 19th century, and spread throughout the world.\n\nThe 18th century Jesuit preacher Antonio Baldinucci had a particular devotion to the Refugium Peccatorum image of Virgin Mary in the Church of the Gesu (Frascati) in Italy and commissioned a copy which he considered miraculous and carried it with him in his travels. The Jesuits spread copies of the image of the \"Madonna of Refuge\" in Mexico by the 19th century, and it began to be depicted in missions there, often with clouds surrounding the lower portion of the image of the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus.\n\nIn some 19th-century images, biblical scenes are included below the image of the Madonna, e.g. Peter's visions as well as the depiction of a safe harbor (Psalm 108:30).\n\nThe term \"Refugium peccatorum\" is also used other works of Roman Catholic Marian art. For instance, there is a marble statue representing the Virgin Mary, on the grand staircase of the old municipal palace in Venice, Italy. The name came from the fact that the convicts were allowed to stop in front of the Virgin Mary’s statue to pray for their soul on the way to the scaffold.\n\nThe traditional feast day of Our Lady, Refuge of Sinners is August 13. In Mexico, the feast day is observed on July 4. She is the patroness of California, where the (arch)dioceses there celebrate the feast on July 5.\n\nOur Lady of Laus, which the Vatican approved in 2008, is named Refuge of Sinners because she asked for the conversion of sinners.\n"}

Judaism recognizes that everybody sins on occasion, but that people can stop or minimize those occasions in the future by repenting for past transgressions. Thus, the primary purpose of repentance in Judaism is ethical self transformation.\n\nA Jewish penitent is traditionally known as a \"baal teshuva\" (\"lit.\", \"master of repentance\" or \"master of return\") (; for a woman: , \"baalat teshuva\"; plural: , \"baalei teshuva\"). An alternative modern term is \"hozer beteshuva\" () (\"lit.\", \"returning in repentance\"). \"In a place where \"baalei teshuva\" stand\", according to halakha, \"even the full-fledged righteous do not stand.\"\n\nAccording to the Talmud, God created repentance before He created the physical universe, making it among the first things created. (\"Nedarim\" 39b).\n\nOne should repent immediately. A parable is told in the Talmud (\"Shabbat\" 153a) that Rabbi Eliezer taught his disciples, \"Repent one day before your death.\" The disciples politely questioned whether one can know the day of one's death, so Rabbi Eliezer answered, \"All the more reason, therefore, to repent today, lest one die tomorrow.\" Because of Judaism's understanding of the annual process of Divine Judgment, Jews believe that God is especially open to repentance during period from the beginning of the month of Ellul through the High Holiday season, i. e., Rosh HaShanah (the Day of Judgement), Aseret Yimei Teshuva (the Ten Days of Repentance), Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement), and, according to Kaballah, Hoshana Rabbah. Another good time to repent is toward the end of one's life.\n\nNumerous guides to the repentance process can be found in rabbinical literature. See especially Maimonides' \"Rules of Repentance\" in the Mishneh Torah.\n\nAccording to \"Gates of Repentance\", a standard work of Jewish ethics written by Rabbenu Yonah of Gerona, a sinner repents by:\n\n\nThe second of Rabbenu Yonah's \"Principles of Repentance\" is \"forsaking the sin\" (Hebrew: עזיבת–החטא, \"azivat-hachet\"). After regretting the sin (Rabbenu Yonah's first principle), the penitent must resolve never to repeat the sin. However, Judaism recognizes that the process of repentance varies from penitent to penitent and from sin to sin. For example, a non-habitual sinner often feels the sting of the sin more acutely than the habitual sinner. Therefore, a non-habitual sinner will have an easier time repenting, because he or she will be less likely to repeat the sinful behavior.\n\nThe case of the habitual sinner is more complex. If the habitual sinner regrets his or her sin at all, that regret alone clearly does not translate into a change in behavior. In such a case, Rabbi Nosson Scherman recommends devising \"a personal system of reward and punishment\" and to avoid circumstances which may cause temptation toward the relevant sin. Rabbi Judah taught, \"Who is the penitent whose repentance ascends until the Throne of Glory? — one who is tested and emerges guiltless\" (\"Yoma\" 86b). Maimonides interpreted this statement to mean that the sign of a true penitent is one who commits a sin and is later given the opportunity to commit exactly the same sin, yet one chooses not to (\"Laws of Repentance\" 2:1).\n\nWhen the Temple in Jerusalem was active, a Jew was required to bring various sacrifices for certain types of sins, and to perform a version of the \"viduy\" confession ritual as part of the sacrificial ritual. Yet, even when the Holy Temple still stood, the mere act of bringing an offering never automatically caused God to forgive someone for their sins. The Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) teaches:\n\n\nMany places Rabbinic literature emphasizes that performing charitable deeds, praying, and studying Torah are more meritorious than animal sacrifice, and that the former can replace animal sacrifice when the Temple is not active:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51759111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51759111", "title": "Rick Sanchez (Rick and Morty)", "text": "Rick Sanchez (Rick and Morty)\n\nRick Sanchez is one of the title characters from the Adult Swim animated television series \"Rick and Morty\". Created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon, Sanchez is a genius misanthropic alcoholic scientist inspired by Emmett \"Doc\" Brown from \"Back to the Future\". Known for his reckless, nihilistic behavior and his rude, pessimistic personality, the character has been well received. He is a mad scientist who seems to know everything in the universe and thus finds life a traumatizing and pointless experience. However, despite assuming to be the smartest person in the universe, there have been times where he has been proven wrong.\n\nHe is formally referred to as Rick Sanchez C-137 (alias: \"Terror Rick\") by the Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks, in reference to his original universe, \"C-137\", and penchant for instigating wars with inter-galactic empires. Both Rick and Morty are voiced by Roiland. Volume 1 of the \"Rick and Morty\" comic series follows the Rick and Morty of Dimension C-132 while most issues of subsequent instalments follow the Rick and Morty of \"C-137\"; the video game \"Pocket Mortys\" follows the Rick and Morty of C-123.\n\nRick Sanchez from Earth dimension C-137 is the father of Beth Smith, and the grandfather of Morty and Summer Smith. He is said to have been away from the family for several years prior to the events of the show. He frequently travels on adventures through space and other planets and dimensions with his grandson Morty. In the third season of the show, it is revealed that he is 70 years old. Rick is portrayed as a mad scientist; utilizing his mathematical and scientific prowess in conjunction with apathy and egotistical cynicism, he emerges safely from any situation, regardless of the consequences of his self-preservation. Rick also, in some episodes, desperately tries to regain his family after losing their trust. The creators wanted him to look like he was in control strategically, but not at all when it came to personal matters.\n\nIn \"The Ricks Must Be Crazy\", Rick reveals that he powers his flying car with a battery that contains a miniature universe, or microverse, whose inhabitants unknowingly provide the required electricity. In the episode, the inhabitants cease to provide Rick's car with energy. This is because a scientist from the microverse, resembling Rick in many ways, has created his own miniature universe to supply energy for the beings of his universe. Rick destroys the miniature universe inside his own miniature universe, killing everyone inside. He does not demonstrate remorse for his actions, and instead shows satisfaction. Nearing the end of the episode, Rick knows that his own microverse would power his battery, or he would toss them out and create a new one.\n\nRick's intelligence is portrayed to transcend that of metaphysical beings, as demonstrated in the episode \"Something Ricked This Way Comes\", where he outsmarts Satan.\n\nRick reveals his disdain for love in the episode \"Rick Potion #9\", in which he claims that it is \"a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed\". When Rick and Morty irreversibly mutate all humans on Earth except for their family members, they abandon their original dimension, Dimension C-137 (and their family in that dimension), for a new one. Rick locates a universe in which the alternate version of himself has undone the damage inflicted by the love potion, but where the new dimension's Rick and Morty have been killed, allowing the C-137 Rick and Morty to take their place. Despite Morty's trauma concerning this knowledge, Rick is nonchalant about moving to the new dimension.\n\nIn the episode \"Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind\", after numerous Ricks in alternate dimensions are murdered, the Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks accuses Rick C-137 and orders for him to be arrested. Rick C-137 finds himself captured by an \"evil\" Rick, but is saved by a legion of alternate-dimension Mortys led by Morty C-137.\n\nIn the first episode of the second season, \"A Rickle in Time\", Rick nearly sacrifices himself to save Morty but saves his own life when he realizes that doing so is possible. In the episode \"Get Schwifty\", it is revealed that Rick was once in a rock band called the Flesh Curtains, alongside Birdperson and Squanchy. In the episode \"Big Trouble in Little Sanchez\", Rick transfers his consciousness into a younger clone of himself, whom he calls \"Tiny Rick\". He soon becomes anguished in his new body, and manages to return to his older true form, and murders a line of other clones he produced. In the second season's finale, \"The Wedding Squanchers\", Rick and his family attend Birdperson's wedding, where Birdperson is betrayed and killed by his bride Tammy, a double agent for the Galactic Federation. The family is forced to inhabit an unusually small yet Earth-like planet, as they cannot return to Earth due to Rick's status as a wanted criminal. Rick turns himself into the Federation to allow his family to return home, and is incarcerated on a prison planet under the charges of having committed \"everything\". But in the season three premiere \"The Rickshank Redemption\", by taking out the Council of Ricks while saving Morty and Summer, it is revealed that Rick actually turned himself in to access the Federation's supercomputer and wipe it out financially. Rick also indirectly convinces Beth to divorce Jerry for trying to convince the family to sell him out.\n\nThe premiere episode of the series' third season, \"The Rickshank Rickdemption\" shows a possible origin for Rick, in which he was a well-meaning scientist who loved his wife Diane and daughter Beth, but had an encounter with a member of the Council of Ricks during his initial testing of a prototype portal gun, who offered him the secret to creating his inter-dimensional portal gun and joining the Council of Ricks. Shortly after his refusal, and his pledge to quit science forever, a bomb was sent through a portal, killing Diane and Beth. Rick claims that this was a fake memory he created in order to trick his interrogator into implanting a virus into the mind-reading device he was attached to, allowing him to hijack his body and escape from the Federation prison. At the end of the episode, Rick again insists, in a rant to Morty, that the death of his wife and daughter was a fake memory, though this may be simply him denying the truth to hide his feelings.\n\nRick's catchphrase is \"Wubba Lubba Dub-Dub\", first introduced in the episode \"Meeseeks and Destroy\". In Birdperson's native language, the catchphrase translates to \"I am in great pain. Please help me\".\n\nRick is a sociopathic, emotionally abusive, dismissive, narcissistic, self-centered, incredibly intelligent and alcoholic mad scientist who often drags his 14-year-old grandson, Morty, and sometimes other members of his family on dangerous adventures. His intelligence makes him believe that existence is miserable and pointless, largely due to his knowledge of infinite universes and timelines with endless possibilities. However, he has proven to be quite wrong on several occasions, even by his more naive grandson. While he has shown signs of loving his family and caring deeply about his best friend Birdperson, he has also been shown to be very self-centered, emotionally abusive and willing to threaten, harm or kill on a whim to get his own way. He does not fear to speak his mind and give his harsh opinions of the things about his family that easily irritate him. His huge ego and reckless, ethically questionable behaviour often lead to him making enemies and getting himself and his family in trouble.\n\nIn the pilot, Rick is revealed to be an atheist, as he tells Summer that \"there is no God.\" Harmon has said that \"anarchist\" is a close ideological descriptor of Rick. In \"The Rickshank Redemption\", Rick professes his longing for the Szechuan sauce once available at McDonald's as a promotional item for the film \"Mulan\". Rick is a polymath who is agnostic about scientific specialties; he seems to dabble in everything from electrical engineering to nanomedicine to quantum mechanics to nuclear biology.\n\nRick has been stated to be pansexual by Justin Roiland, one of the show's creators and executive producers. This was shown in \"Auto Erotic Assimilation\", when Rick connects with Unity, an ex-lover who is a collective hive mind of assimilated individuals from the planet they occupy. Throughout the series, Rick's sexuality has also been heavily hinted at, mostly in his backstory.\n\nThe character was created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon, who first met at Channel 101 in the early 2000s. In 2006, Roiland created \"The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti\", an animated short parodying the \"Back to the Future\" characters Doc Brown and Marty McFly, and the precursor to \"Rick and Morty\". The idea for \"Rick and Morty\", in the form of \"Doc and Mharti\" was brought up to Adult Swim, and the ideas for a family element and Rick being a grandfather to Morty were developed. Roiland considers his voice for Rick to be a \"horrible Doc Brown manic impression\".\n\nThe character has received positive reception. Speaking of Rick's relatability and likability, Dan Harmon stated that \"we’ve all been Rick. But Rick really does have bigger fish to fry than anybody. He understands everything better than us. So you give him the right to be jaded and dismissive and narcissistic and sociopathic\". Emily Gaudette of \"Inverse\" wrote that fans have \"come to love [Rick] over two seasons of misadventures\".\n\nDavid Sims of \"The Atlantic\" noted Rick's \"bitter amorality\" and called the character \"a genius who comfortably thinks of himself as the universe's cleverest man and is grounded only by his empathy toward other people, which he tries to suppress as much as possible\", therefore writing that Rick's selflessness at the end of the episode \"The Wedding Squanchers\" is \"the most surprising twist possible\". Zack Handlen of \"The A.V. Club\" wrote that \"[Rick] slowly realizing that he loved his grandkids and his daughter (and tolerated his son-in-law) no matter how many times he swore at them helped to give the character some necessary depth\", and that \"behind all the catchphrases and the crazed energy ... There's something dead and sad and fucked up in the guy\".\n\nIn the first episode of the third season, \"The Rickshank Redemption\", Rick shows a significant interest in Szechuan sauce and insists that his motivation in life is \"finding that McNugget sauce\" caused a public interest in having the sauce be reinstated on the McDonald's menu, with some fans attempting to recreate the sauce themselves. According to \"USA Today\", McDonald's spokesperson Terri Hickey stated that \"We never say never, because when our customers speak, we listen. And to paraphrase some of our most enthusiastic fans, our sauce is so good that it would be worth waiting 9 seasons or 97 years for.\"\n"}

Sasha are spirits known by someone still alive, while Zamani are spirits not known by anyone currently alive. Sasha are concerned with, and are expressed as, the present time, the recent past, and the near future; while Zamani is the limitless past. Potential time is the third part of the space-time continuum in African Thought. People must learn from the past to act wisely in the present to create a good future.\n\nAccording to James Loewen in his book \"Lies My Teacher Told Me\": \"The recently departed whose time overlapped with people still here are the Sasha, the living dead. They are not wholly dead, for they live on in the memories of the living ... when the last person knowing an ancestor dies, that ancestor leaves the Sasha for the Zamani, the dead. As generalized ancestors, the Zamani are not forgotten but revered.\" Loewen cites and paraphrases the explanation from \"African Religions and Philosophy\" by John Mbiti. Sasha and Zamani are not stages of \"death\". They are the two ontological stages (or dimensions) of \"history\" in Swahili culture.\n\nIn Swahili, the two time dimensions are called sasa and zamani. Both have quality and quantity. People speak of them as big, small, little, short, long, etc. in relation to a particular event. Sasha refers to the events that have just taken place or are taking place now at the moment or are just about to take place in the near future. Sasha time can extend into the future for about six months or, at the most, one year. Zamani time overlaps sasha time to some extent in the present, but it also goes back very far into the past time. It absorbs, holds, and stores all the events that have ever occurred. It is more significant than sasha because it stretches endlessly back into the past. It includes the time of myth when all the stories of creation took place and when the great and famous heroes of the past performed their exploits. (Anderson 1986, Mbiti 1994.)\nZamani is not limited to what in English is called the past.… Zamani overlaps with Sasha and the two are not separable. Sasha feeds or disappears into Zamani. But before events become incorporated into the Zamani, they have to become realized or actualized within the Sasha dimension. When this has taken place, the events \"move\" backwards from the Sasha into the Zamani…. It is the final storehouse for all phenomena and events, the ocean of time in which everything becomes absorbed into a reality that is neither after nor before. \nJohn S.

C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, who founded the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), better known in the West as the Hare Krishna movement. Serving as a writer, poet, and artist, Satsvarupa dasa Goswami is the author of Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada's authorized biography,\"Srila Prabhupada-lilamrta\". After Prabhupada's death, Satsvarupa dasa Goswami was one of the eleven disciples selected to become an initiating guru in ISKCON.\nSatsvarupa dasa Goswami, (Sanskrit: ), is one of the first few westerners ordained by Prabhupada in September 1966. He has been since established as a prolific Vaishnava writer and poet. While traveling, lecturing on Krishna consciousness, and instructing disciples worldwide, he published over hundred books including poems, memoirs, essays, novels, and studies based on the Vaishnava scriptures. In his later years he created hundreds of paintings, drawings, and sculptures that attempt to capture and express his perspective on the culture of Krishna consciousness.\n\nHe was born Stephen Guarino, the elder of two children, to Italian Roman Catholic parents in Staten Island, New York.\nHe was educated initially in a public high school nearby and then enrolled in the Brooklyn College, where he underwent an intellectual revolution putting in question his Catholic values. In the college he read Nietzsche and Dostoevsky and associated with students and professors who were religious skeptics.\nIn January 1962 he joined the Navy, where he served for two years on board of U.S.S. Saratoga, a super-carrier. In his introduction to \"With Śrīla Prabhupāda in the Early Days, 1966–1969\" he writes: \"A few months after the death of President Kennedy, I was honorably discharged, and without visiting my parents on Staten Island, I went directly to the Lower East Side. By then, the Lower East Side was, in my mind and in the minds of my friends, the most mystical place in the world.\" \"I certainly didn’t think some guru was suddenly going to appear and save me. I was too cynical. Yet I was regularly reading versions of the Bhagavad-gita and the Upanishads. Ironically, one week before the gift shop at 26 Second Avenue changed into Srila Prabhupada's temple, I was standing in that very doorway with a Bhagavad-gita in my back pocket, waiting to meet a friend. Somehow we had chosen 26 Second Avenue as a meeting place. At that time, I had no idea what was about to happen.\"\n\nIn July 1966 he met and accepted a spiritual instruction from A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami who registered ISKCON a month later. Prabhupada soon began assigning him typing tasks which Satsvarupa understood \"to be yoga\". On September 23, 1966 he was ordained and shortly became one of the leading figures of the new Gaudiya Vaishnava movement.\n\nAfter Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada died, he was one of eleven disciples selected to become an initiating guru in ISKCON. Prof. Larry Shinn in his overview of the contemporary state of the Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada's movement confirms this while relating his first meeting with Satsvarupa dasa Goswami:\n\nIn a typical initiation ceremony as a guru of International Society for Krishna Consciousness he would begin with purification using \"achamana\" (holy water) and concludes with a sermon on the importance of chanting of the holy names in the life of a new initiate.\n\nIn addition to periods of being a GBC personal assistant, the brief period between January and July 1974 during which he had the opportunity to act as a personal servant and secretary to the founder of ISKCON, Prabhupada, is noted. During this time his duties included bringing Prabhupada his medicine and toothbrush in the morning, accompanying him on his morning walk, preparing his breakfast and lunch and providing his daily massage. In other words, the tasks were those of a menial servant, while Satsvarupa das Goswami was excited about it. Some note that the first time Satsvarupa gave Prabhupada a massage it was \"an intense spiritual experience\" for him:\n\nOne may understand how the service given to one's guru can be of such a value by seeing it in the ritual religious context. The theme of status difference, enriched with the idea of intimacy, coalesce in this simple pattern of devotee massaging the spiritual master's legs and feet in the cultural models expressed in puja and innumerable other Vaishnava contexts. Satsvarupa took the posture of a menial servant with evident relish. It is also taken as an example of ideal typical model of the guru-disciple relationship as a disciple should always consider him- or herself a menial servant of the spiritual master.\n\nAs a writer he is following a line of teachers or gurus in his religious tradition. In his review Srivatsa Goswami suggests this view with a reference to the \"path of Six Goswamis\": Satsvarupa dasa Goswami's writing represents a contemporary variety from commentaries on scriptures to a free flowing poetry and prose.\nHis writings were translated to over forty languages by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust and Gita Nagari Press. He was also requested by Bhaktivedanta Book Trust to complete a number of works, started by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.\n\nOne of widely read and translated of all his books is \"Srila Prabhupada-Lilamrta\". It's a biography of the founder of the Hare Krishna movement, depicting him through different stages of his life. It was written with the help of a large research team for a period of over six years. \"Srila Prabhupada-lilamrta\" is based on material given by interviewers and researchers and is based on a system of ascertaining whether a reported biographical story is authentic. By researching tape recordings of Prabhupada author provided accurate quotes of his statements wherever possible. In this biographical work he would always look for several reliable witnesses, in addition to the one who is recalling a particular event.\n\nOther biographical works include \"He Lives Forever\" (1978) (lectures on the significance of Prabhupada's death) and five volumes of \"Prabhupada Nectar\" (1983–86) (collection of anecdotes told by Prabhupäda's disciples and compiled by Satsvarupa dasa Goswami) and a number of other titles. His memoir \"With Sréla Prabhupada in the Early Days\" (1991) covers the early years of 1966–1969, his book \"Life With the Perfect Master\" (1983) describes the seven-month period in 1974, when he served as Prabhupada's personal servant.\n\nBooks included in this category include titles published by Bhaktivedanta Book Trust such as Narada Bhakti Sutra and Mukunda Mala Strotra, both unfinished works of his preceptor, as well as the multi-volume \"A Poor Man Reads the Bhagavatam\" – elaboration on Bhaktivedanta Purports of the Bhagavata Purana. From 1966 to recent years Satsvarupa has been contributing to \"Back to Godhead\" magazine. His articles in the \"Back to Godhead\" often demonstrate variety of legitimate perspectives on different issues and perspectives in spiritual understanding of Gaudiya Vaishnavism.\n\nHis book published in 1975 during A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada's lifetime was \"Readings in Vedic Literature: the Tradition Speaks for Itself\". Prabhupada was appreciative of reviews of the book by the academic circles. In the years to follow Satsvarupa dasa Goswami was supportive of the foundation of Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies and some of his works were published in the \"ISKCON Communications Journal\" (ICJ) and reviewed by the academia in ICJ academic journal. Despite initial anti-cult controversies, the Hare Krishna movement today is viewed by the academics as \"the most genuinely Hindu of all the many Indian movements in the West\".\n\nA number of his books are employing techniques of free-writing. Diaries and the letters collection from Prabhupada are spanning from the very beginning of the movement in 1966 in the West and provide an account of the ISKCON movement from the very first years to present days. Martin Palmer, Director of the \"International Consultancy on Religion, Education and Culture\" and Religious Adviser to World Wide Fund for Nature wrote of his book \"Entering the Life of Prayer\" 'I recommend this book to any who are genuinely wrestling with the implications of faith and with the path of prayer. It deserves to become a spiritual classic.'\n\nNumber of his poetical works were published in modern American idiom. He was also published in prominent Haiku magazines, the poetry dedicated to Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada glorification received positive reviews. His paintings and sculpture have also been reviewed by the Washington Times. His works as the self-taught artist are reflective of dedication of his life to the \"study of Vedic literature and the teachings of the spiritual tradition\".\n\nSatsvarupa dasa Goswami was a pioneer in the early days of the movement, and is the most senior member of the movement at present. He was appointed as a guru by his perceptor. Satvarupa was also one of the original members appointed as (GBC) Governing Body Commission created by Prabhupada in 1970 to gradually take on the responsibility of the spiritual management duties in ISKCON. Satsvarupa dasa Goswami was selected a trusty in the will of A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada for the management of ISKCON.\n\nSince ISKCON incorporation in July 1966 at 26 Second Avenue Satsvarupa dasa was engaged as A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada's personal typist and ISKCON secretary for the first year. He was one of few devotees who were maintaining outside jobs to support the ISKCON temple at the beginning. Later he was managing ISKCON Boston and ISKCON Press, that grew to be later be registered as Bhaktivedanta Book Trust. Upon assuming duties of a GBC (Governing Body Commissioner) in 1970, Satsvarupa was asked by Prabhupada to accept order of sannyasa in 1972. He accepted sannyasa along with other GBC members, all of whom were originally married man, such as Tamal Krishna Goswami and Hridayananda dasa Goswami. At the time A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada awarded him and other followers the title Goswami with the single line instruction: Preach, preach, preach! He is sometimes listed among active promoters of ahimsa among other eastern religious teachers.\n\nMain preaching activities by the means of traveling sankirtana parties were centered in United States. BBT (Bhaktivedanta Book Trust) Library Party headed by him in mid-1970s was active in establishing distribution network mainly to the Universities of the United States, with some members of the team such as Bhakti Tirtha Swami and Suhotra Dasa traveling as far as Eastern Europe.\n\nIn 1974, Satsvarupa dasa Goswami was requested by Prabhupada to join him as traveling GBC servant, replacing previous servant Srutakirti Dasa and travelled as a menial servant around the globe.\n\nFrom the early days of ISKCON, the Back to Godhead was project required a lot of both contribution and supervision. Satsvarupa dasa Goswami was editor in chief and one of the main contributors to this magazine till 1991, when assisted editor Jayadvaita Swami took over as the editor in chief.\n\nIn accordance with ISKCON GBC Governing Body Commission resolutions March 1978 Satsvarupa dasa Goswami along with other eleven Governing Body Commissioners assumed duties and services of initiating disciples in assigned zones after the death of Prabhupada. Initial preaching areas in the United States and Caribbean were expanded with an addition of Ireland in 1982 where he became a zonal acharya. The assumption of equal status to Srila Prabhupada and the title of acharya are still surrounded in a controversy. While following the direction of Governing Body Commission, Satsvarupa dasa Goswami was one of the pioneers who attempted to reform the system, by assuming more humble and appropriate role of a guru as per recorded instructions of the founder-acharya. While imitation of Prabhupada was criticised, despite these warnings, specifically by Satsvarupa dasa Goswami, such imitation sometimes resulted in curious side-effects and many devotees adopted Prabhupada's mannerisms. This remained evident especially among the older American devotees who even now speak with an Indian accent and display many of Prabhupada's gestures like turning one's head or moving one's hand in a certain way.\n\nIn years 1978–1985 he took part in a controversial zonal acarya system in a position of an Acharya while initiating reform of a high standard of worship. In 1986–1987 a number of senior members and newly appointed GBC members with the support of Satsvarupa dasa Goswami reformed ISKCON guru system, lowering unprecedented level of worship reserved to initiating gurus in ISKCON. He was called as the \"most vocal in the cause of reform\" in ISKCON. Satsvarupa dasa Goswami recorded this period in his book \"Guru Reform Notebook\" (1987). Throughout the years that followed, up until the end of the century, new ISKCON guru system was further developed.\n\nIn 1999 Governing Body Commission confirmed GBC Emeritus status of his membership of the Governing Body of ISKCON.\n\nHis extensive traveling in Europe in 1990s included areas of Scandinavia, Eastern, Central Europe and Italy, but mainly centered in preaching in Ireland and UK.\nIn following years, his devotional life has included the creation of hundreds of paintings, drawings, and sculptures that capture and express the artist's vision of Krishna consciousness. His latest literary work is centered on his commentary on Bhagavata Purana known as \"A Poor Man Reads the Bhagavatam\".\n\nIn 2002, he suffered a physical and emotional collapse from chronic migraine headaches, a condition that required immediate medical intervention and treatment. In consultation with the official governing body of the Krishna consciousness society, he agreed to cease initiating disciples. With the GBC consultation, he retained his Goswami title and continued in the sannyasa order and as an ISKCON guru.\n\nFollowing a period of health recovery, at the age of 68, Satsvarupa dasa Goswami took residence in the East Coast United States where he is engaging in a number of preaching activities, such as regular lecturing and traveling to the holy \"dhamas\". All of the associated preaching and traveling is complementing his main service of commenting and answering disciples' questions on the Bhaktivedanta Purports being published as the volumes of \"A Poor Man Reads the Bhagavatam\" and daily online journal.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

As a group they are also referred to as the Rabbeinu Sevorai or Rabanan Saborai, and may have played a large role in giving the Talmud its current structure. Modern scholars also use the plural term Stammaim (Hebrew; \"closed, vague or unattributed sources\") for the authors of unattributed statements in the Gemara.\nMuch of classical rabbinic literature generally holds that the Babylonian Talmud was redacted into more or less its final form around 550 CE. In the introduction to his Mishnah Torah, Maimonides writes that Rav Ashi compiled the Babylonian Talmud. He also writes that Ravina and Rav Ashi (Amoraim, who are mentioned in the Talmud) were the final sages of Israel who transcribed the Oral Torah.\nHowever, some statements within classical rabbinic literature, and later analysis thereof, have led many scholars to conclude that the Babylonian Talmud was smoothed over by the \"Savora'im\", although almost nothing was changed. Occasionally, multiple versions of the same legalistic discussion are included with minor variations. The text also states that various opinions emanated from various Talmudic academies.\n\nSherira Gaon (c.987 CE) indicates that Rav Yose was the final member of the \"Savora'im\". Occasionally, specific \"Savora'im\" are mentioned by name in the Talmud itself, such as Rabbi Ahai, who (according to later authority Rashbam) was a \"Savora\".\n\nRabbi Triebitz discusses the \"‘chasimas hashas’\" - the final compilation of the Talmud. The Talmud says that Ravina and Rav Ashi were the ‘end of instruction’ which is understood by many to mean that they compiled the Talmud. Yet there are statements in the Talmud referring to later generations. And according to Rav Sherira Gaon the Talmud was not in its final form until many generations later.\n\nThe role of the \"Savoraim\" in the redaction of the Talmud was reexamined in Jewish academia because of the work of David Weiss Halivni, author of \"Mekorot u'Mesorot\", a projected ten volume source-critical commentary on the Talmud.\n\nHalivni terms the editors of the Talmud as \"Stamma'im\", a new term for rabbis that he places after the period of the \"Tannaim\" and \"Amoraim\", but before the Geonic period. He concludes that to a large extent, the \"Stamma'im\" essentially wrote the Gemara (the discussions in the Talmud about the Mishna). Halivni posits that during the time of Ravina and Rav Ashi, they compiled a Gemara that was much smaller than the Gemara known today, and which likely was similar to the Mishna and to the Tosefta. He sees this proto-Gemara as a compilation of rulings that probably had little record of discussions. Halivni also posits that the \"Stamma'im\" did not always fully understand the context and import of the statement of the \"Tanna\" or \"Amora\" when it was said. The methodology employed in his commentary, \"Mekorot u' Mesorot\", will attempt to give Halivni's analysis of the correct import and context and will demonstrate how the Talmud erred in its understanding of the original context.\n\n\n"}

These contacts brought Gandharan Buddhist culture into territories adjacent to China proper.\n\nDirect contact between Central Asian and Chinese Buddhism continued throughout the 3rd to 7th century, well into the Tang period. From the 4th century onward, with Faxian's pilgrimage to India (395–414), and later Xuanzang (629–644), Chinese pilgrims started to travel by themselves to northern India, their source of Buddhism, in order to get improved access to original scriptures. \nMuch of the land route connecting northern India (mainly Gandhara) with China at that time was ruled by the Kushan Empire, and later the Hephthalite Empire.\n\nThe Indian form of Buddhist tantra (Vajrayana) reached China in the 7th century. Tibetan Buddhism was likewise established as a branch of Vajrayana, in the 8th century. But from about this time, the Silk Road transmission of Buddhism began to decline with the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana, resulting in the Uyghur Khaganate by the 740s.\n\nBy this time, Indian Buddhism itself was in decline, due to the resurgence of Hinduism on one hand and due to the Muslim expansion on the other, while Tang-era Chinese Buddhism was repressed in the 9th century, but not before in its turn giving rise to Korean and Japanese traditions.\n\nBuddhism was brought to China via the Silk Road. Buddhist monks travelled with merchant caravans on the Silk Road, to preach their new religion. The lucrative Chinese silk trade along this trade route began during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE) with the establishment by Alexander the Great of a system of Hellenistic kingdoms (323 BC - 63 BC) and trade networks extending from the Mediterranean to modern Afghanistan and Tajikistan on the borders of China. The powerful Greco-Bactrian Kingdoms (250 BC-125 BC) in Afghanistan and the later Indo-Greek Kingdoms (180 BC - 10 CE) practiced Greco-Buddhism and formed the first stop on the Silk Road, after China, for nearly 300 years. See Dayuan (\"Ta-yuan\"; ; literarily \"Great Ionians\").\n\nThe transmission of Buddhism to China via the Silk Road started in the 1st century CE with a semi-legendary account of an embassy sent to the West by the Chinese Emperor Ming (58–75 CE):\n\nExtensive contacts however started in the 2nd century CE, probably as a consequence of the expansion of the Greco-Buddhist Kushan Empire into the Chinese territory of the Tarim Basin, with the missionary efforts of a great number of Central Asian Buddhist monks to Chinese lands. The first missionaries and translators of Buddhists scriptures into Chinese were either Parthian, Kushan, Sogdian or Kuchean.\n\nIn the middle of the 2nd century, the Kushan empire under king Kaniṣka from its capital at Purushapura (modern Peshawar), India expanded into Central Asia and went beyond the regions of Kashgar, Khotan and Yarkand, in the Tarim Basin, modern Xinjiang. As a consequence, cultural exchanges greatly increased, and Central Asian Buddhist missionaries became active shortly after in the Chinese capital cities of Loyang and sometimes Nanjing, where they particularly distinguished themselves by their translation work. They promoted both Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna scriptures. Thirty-seven of these early translators of Buddhist texts are known.\n\n\nThe first documented translation of Buddhist scriptures into Chinese occurs in 148 CE with the arrival of the Parthian prince-turned-monk, An Shigao (Ch. 安世高). He worked to establish Buddhist temples in Loyang and organized the translation of Buddhist scriptures into Chinese, testifying to the beginning of a wave of Central Asian Buddhist proselytism that was to last several centuries. An Shigao translated Buddhist texts on basic doctrines, meditation and \"abhidharma\". An Xuan (Ch. 安玄), a Parthian layman who worked alongside An Shigao, also translated an early Mahāyāna Buddhist text on the bodhisattva path.\n\nMahāyāna Buddhism was first widely propagated in China by the Kushan monk Lokakṣema (Ch. 支婁迦讖, active ca. 164–186 CE), who came from the ancient Buddhist kingdom of Gandhāra. Lokakṣema translated important Mahāyāna sūtras such as the \"Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra\", as well as rare, early Mahāyāna sūtras on topics such as \"samādhi\" and meditation on the buddha Akṣobhya. These translations from Lokakṣema continue to give insight into the early period of Mahāyāna Buddhism.\n\nFrom the 4th century onward, Chinese pilgrims also started to travel on the Silk Road to India, the origin of Buddhism, by themselves in order to get improved access to the original scriptures. According to Chinese sources, the first Chinese to be ordained was Zhu Zixing, after he went to Central Asia in 260 to seek out Buddhism.\n\nIt is only from the 4th century CE that Chinese Buddhist monks started to travel to India to discover Buddhism first-hand. Faxian's pilgrimage to India (395–414) is said to have been the first significant one. He left along the Silk Road, stayed six years in India, and then returned by the sea route. Xuanzang (629–644) and Hyecho traveled from Korea to India.\n\nThe most famous of the Chinese pilgrims is Xuanzang (629–644), whose large and precise translation work defines a \"new translation period\", in contrast with older Central Asian works. He also left a detailed account of his travels in Central Asia and India. The legendary accounts of the holy priest Xuanzang were described in the famous novel \"Journey to the West\", which envisaged trials of the journey with demons but with the help of various disciples.\n\nDuring the fifth and sixth centuries C.E., Merchants played a large role in the spread of religion, in particular Buddhism. Merchants found the moral and ethical teachings of Buddhism to be an appealing alternative to previous religions. As a result, Merchants supported Buddhist Monasteries along the Silk Roads and in return the Buddhists gave the Merchants somewhere to stay as they traveled from city to city. As a result, Merchants spread Buddhism to foreign encounters as they traveled. Merchants also helped to establish diaspora within the communities they encountered and over time, their cultures became based on Buddhism. Because of this, these communities became centers of literacy and culture with well-organized marketplaces, lodging, and storage. The Silk Road transmission of Buddhism essentially ended around the 7th century with the rise of Islam in Central Asia.\n\nBuddhism in Central Asia began to decline in the 7th century in the course of the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana. A turning point was the Battle of Talas of 751.\nThis development also resulted in the extinction of the local Tocharian Buddhist culture in the Tarim Basin during the 8th century.\n\nThe Silk Road \"transmission\" between Eastern and Indian Buddhism thus came to an end in the 8th century, on one hand because Islam in Central Asia repressed Buddhism along the Silk Road itself, but also because Buddhism in both India and China were in decline by that time.\n\nFrom the 9th century onward, therefore, the various schools of Buddhism which survived began to evolve independently of one another. The vigorous Chinese culture progressively absorbed Buddhist teachings until a strongly Chinese particularism developed.\nIn the eastern Tarim Basin, Central Asian Buddhism survived into the later medieval period as the religion of the Uyghur Kara-Khoja Kingdom (see also Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves), and Buddhism became one of the religions in the Mongol Empire and the Chagatai Khanate, and via the Oirats eventually the religion of the Kalmyks, who settled at the Caspian in the 17th century.\nOtherwise, Central Asian Buddhism survived mostly in Tibet and in Mongolia.\n\nCentral Asian missionary efforts along the Silk Road were accompanied by a flux of artistic influences, visible in the development of Serindian art from the 2nd to the 11th century CE in the Tarim Basin, modern Xinjiang.\n\nSerindian art often derives from the Greco-Buddhist art of the Gandhāra district of what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan, combining Indian and Greek influences.\n\nHighly sinicized forms of this syncretism can also be found on the eastern portions of the Tarim Basin, such as in Dunhuang.\n\nSilk Road artistic influences can be found as far as Japan to this day, in architectural motifs or representations of Japanese gods (see Greco-Buddhist art).\n\nThe (5th century) \"Book of the Later Han\", compiled by Fan Ye (398-446 CE), documented early Chinese Buddhism. This history records that around 65 CE, Buddhism was practiced in the courts of both Emperor Ming of Han (r. 58-75 CE) at Luoyang (modern Henan) and, his half-brother, King Ying (r. 41-70 CE) of Chu at Pengcheng (modern Jiangsu).\n\nThe Book of Han has given rise to discussions on the maritime or overland transmission of Buddhism, and the origins of Buddhism in India or China.\n\nFirst, the \"Book of the Later Han\" biography of Liu Ying, the King of Chu, gives the oldest reference to Buddhism in Chinese historical literature. It says Ying was both deeply interested in Huang-Lao 黄老 (from Yellow Emperor and Laozi) Daoism and \"observed fasting and performed sacrifices to the Buddha.\" Huang-Lao or Huanglaozi 黄老子 is the deification of Laozi, and was associated with \"fangshi\" \"technician; magician; alchemist\" methods and \"xian\" \"transcendent; immortal\" techniques. \"To Liu Ying and the Chinese devotees at his court the \"Buddhist\" ceremonies of fasting and sacrifices were probably no more than a variation of existing Daoist practices; this peculiar mixture of Buddhist and Daoist elements remains characteristic of Han Buddhism as a whole.\"\n\nIn 65 CE, Emperor Ming decreed that anyone suspected of capital crimes would be given an opportunity for redemption, and King Ying sent thirty rolls of silk. The biography quotes Ming's edict praising his younger brother:\n\nIn 70 CE, King Ying was implicated in rebellion and sentenced to death, but Ming instead exiled him and his courtiers south to Danyang (Anhui), where Ying committed suicide in 71 CE. The Buddhist community at Pencheng survived, and around 193 CE, the warlord Zhai Rong built a huge Buddhist temple, \"which could contain more than three thousand people, who all studied and read Buddhist scriptures.\"\n\nSecond, Fan Ye's \"Book of Later Han\" quotes a \"current\" (5th-century) tradition that Emperor Ming prophetically dreamed about a \"golden man\" Buddha. While \"The Kingdom of Tianzhu\" section (above) recorded his famous dream, the \"Annals of Emperor Ming\" history did not. Apocryphal texts give divergent accounts about the imperial envoys sent to India, their return with two Buddhist monks, Sanskrit sutras (including \"Sutra of Forty-two Chapters\") carried by white horses, and establishing the White Horse Temple.\n\nSince the \"Book of Later Han\" present two accounts of how Buddhism entered Han China, generations of scholars have debated whether monks first arrived via the maritime or overland routes of the Silk Road.\n\nThe maritime route hypothesis, favored by Liang Qichao and Paul Pelliot, proposed that Buddhism was originally introduced in southern China, the Yangtze River and Huai River region, where King Ying of Chu was worshipping Laozi and Buddha c. 65 CE. The overland route hypothesis, favored by Tang Yongtong, proposed that Buddhism disseminated eastward through Yuezhi and was originally practiced in western China, at the Han capital Luoyang where Emperor Ming established the White Horse Temple c. 68 CE.\n\nThe historian Rong Xinjiang reexamined the overland and maritime hypotheses through a multi-disciplinary review of recent discoveries and research, including the Gandhāran Buddhist Texts, and concluded:\n\nFan Ye's Commentary noted that neither of the Former Han histories – the (109-91 BCE) \"Records or the Grand Historian\" (which records Zhang Qian visiting Central Asia) and (111 CE) \"Book of Han\" (compiled by Ban Yong) – described Buddhism originating in India:\n\nIn the \"Book of Later Han\", \"The Kingdom of Tianzhu\" (天竺, Northwest India) section of \"The Chronicle of the Western Regions\" summarizes the origins of Buddhism in China. After noting Tianzhu envoys coming by sea through Rinan (日南, Central Vietnam) and presenting tribute to Emperor He of Han (r. 89-105 CE) and Emperor Huan of Han (r. 147-167 CE), it summarizes the first \"hard evidence\" about Prince Ying and \"official\" story about Emperor Ming:\n\nDespite secular Chinese histories dating the introduction of Buddhism in the 1st century, some apocryphal Buddhist texts and traditions claim earlier dates in the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BCE) or Former Han Dynasty (208 BCE-9 CE).\n\nOne apocryphal story, first appearing in the (597 CE) \"Lidai sanbao ji\" 歷代三寶紀, concerns a group of Buddhist priests who supposedly arrived in 217 BCE at the capital of Qin Shi Huang in Xianyang (near Xi'an). The monks, led by the shramana Shilifang 室李防, presented sutras to the First Emperor, who had them put in jail:\n\nThe (668 CE) \"Fayuan Zhulin\" Buddhist encyclopedia elaborates this legend with Mauryan emperor Ashoka the Great sending Shilifang to China. With the exception of Liang Qichao, most modern sinologists dismiss this Shilifang story. Some western historians believe Emperor Ashoka sent Buddhist missionaries to China, citing the (ca. 265) 13th Rock Edict that records missions to Greece, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. Others disagree, \"As far as we can gather from the inscriptions he [Ashoka] was ignorant of the very existence of China.\"\n\nThere is a Chinese tradition that in 2 BCE, a Yuezhi envoy to the court of Emperor Ai of Han transmitted one or more Buddhist sutras to a Chinese scholar. The earliest version derives from the lost (mid-3rd century) \"Weilüe\", quoted in Pei Songzhi's commentary to the (429 CE) \"Records of Three Kingdoms\": \"the student at the imperial academy Jing Lu 景盧 received from Yicun 伊存, the envoy of the king of the Great Yuezhi oral instruction in (a) Buddhist sutra(s).\" Since Han histories do not mention Emperor Ai having contacts with the Yuezhi, scholars disagree whether this tradition \"deserves serious consideration\", or can be \"reliable material for historical research\".\n\nMany apocryphal sources recount the \"pious legend\" of Emperor Ming dreaming about Buddha, sending envoys to Yuezhi (on a date variously given as 60, 61, 64 or 68 CE), and their return (3 or 11 years later) with sacred texts and the first Buddhist missionaries, Kāśyapa Mātanga (Shemoteng 攝摩騰 or Jiashemoteng 迦葉摩騰) and Dharmaratna (Zhu Falan 竺法蘭). They translated the \"Sutra in Forty-two Sections\" into Chinese, traditionally dated 67 CE but probably later than 100, the emperor built the White Horse Temple (Baimasi 白馬寺) in their honor, and Chinese Buddhism began. All accounts of Emperor Ming's dream and Yuezhi embassy derive from the anonymous (middle 3rd-century) introduction to the \"Sutra of Forty-two Chapters\". For example, the (late 3rd to early 5th-century) \"Mouzi Lihuolun\" says,\n\nAcademics disagree over the historicity of Emperor Ming's dream; Tang Yongtong sees a possible nucleus of fact behind the tradition, and Henri Maspero rejects it as propagandistic fiction.\n\nExemplifying how traditional accounts of Chinese Buddhism sometimes combined history and legend, the \"Book of Han\" records that in 121 BCE, Emperor Wu of Han sent general Huo Qubing to attack the Xiongnu. Huo defeated the people of prince Xiutu 休屠 (in modern-day Gansu) and \"captured a golden (or gilded) man used by the King of Hsiu-t'u to worship Heaven.\" Xiutu's son was taken prisoner, but eventually became a favorite retainer of Emperor Wu and was granted the name Jin Midi, with his surname Jin 金 \"gold\" supposedly referring to the \"golden man.\" The golden statue was later moved to the Yunyang 雲陽 Temple, near the royal summer palace Ganquan 甘泉 (modern Xianyang, Shaanxi).\n\nThe (c. 6th century) \"A New Account of the Tales of the World\" claims this golden man was more than ten feet high, and Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141-87 BCE) sacrificed to it in the Ganquan 甘泉 palace, which \"is how Buddhism gradually spread into (China).\"\n\n\n\n"}

They had Catholic roots from their ancestry in Dominica. In 1862 the first Catholic church among the Garifuna of British Honduras/Belize was built in Punta Gorda by Belgian Jesuit Fr. John Genon. From Punta Gorda he served the missions along the coast from Redcliff (Barranco) to Stann Creek Town.\nAfter Genon’s death in 1878, Punta Gorda became a mission visited every other month. In 1883 Q'eqchi' Maya from Cobán, Alta Verapaz, Guatemala, settled in Crique Sarco and Dolores near Punta Gorda. A count of the population in the Toledo District in the 1890s reported around 3700 of whom 3249 were Catholic. School populations included Punta Gorda 100, Barranco 50, Monkey River Town 40, Sarstoon 90, and San Antonio 120. \nMany of the Q'eqchi' from Coban worked as laborers on the German-owned Cramer Estates in Temash and Sarstoon (at left).

{"id": "65873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65873", "title": "Sweden Democrats", "text": "Sweden Democrats\n\nSweden Democrats or Swedish Democrats (, SD) is a social conservative and right-wing populist political party in Sweden, founded in 1988. The party describes itself as social conservative with a nationalist foundation. The party has been described by others as far-right, national-conservative, and anti-immigration. Jimmie Åkesson has been party leader since 2005.\n\nSince 2014 the SD has substantially increased its support among both foreign-born and foreign-background voters, becoming the third largest party in Sweden also among this demographic by 2017 (SCB).\n\nThe Sweden Democrats crossed the 4% threshold necessary for parliamentary representation for the first time in the 2010 general election, polling 5.7% and gaining 20 seats in the Riksdag. This increase in popularity has been compared by international media to other similar anti-immigration movements in Europe. The party received increased support in the 2014 Swedish general election, when it polled 12.9% and secured 49 seats in parliament, becoming the third largest party in Sweden. The Sweden Democrats have remained isolated in the Riksdag because the other parties staunchly maintain a policy of refusing cooperation with them. The Sweden Democrats are a member of European Conservatives and Reformists group in the European Parliament.\n\nThe Sweden Democrats party was founded in 1988 as a direct successor to the Sweden Party, which in turn had been formed in 1986 by the merger of (BSS, in English: \"Keep Sweden Swedish\") and a faction of the Swedish Progress Party. SD claims 6 February 1988 as the date of its foundation, although observers tend to see the party's foundation as part of a complex decade-long series of events, with some even calling into question whether a meeting took place on 6 February. The party has its roots in Swedish fascism and was primarily a white nationalist movement through the early-1990s, when it first began distancing itself from its past. The SD's logo from the 1990s until 2006 was a version of the torch used by the UK National Front. \n\nWhile opinions on the early SD vary, it is generally agreed (also by the Swedish Committee Against Antisemitism and by \"Expo\") thatSD has never been a Nazi party, although various connections have existed through some of its former members. The party sponsored music of the nationalist Viking rock band Ultima Thule, and various party officials today acknowledge that being fans of Ultima Thule's music factored prominently in their decision to become politically engaged. Among the founding officials of the party were several people that formerly had expressed strong support for the ideology of Nazi Germany. The party's first auditor, Gustaf Ekström, was a \"Waffen-SS\" veteran and had been a member of the national socialist party \"Svensk Socialistisk Samling\" in the1940s. In 1989, Ekström was a member of the Sweden Democrats' national board. SD's first chairman Anders Klarström had been active in the neo-Nazi (\"Nordic Realm Party\"). Early on, the party recommended international connections to its members such as the National Democratic Party of Germany, the American National Association for the Advancement of White People (founded by David Duke) and publications like the Nazi \"Nation Europa\" and \"\", a newspaper that advocates racial biology.\n\nFrom 1995 onwards the party's new leader, Mikael Jansson (a former member of the Centre Party), strove to make the party more respectable and, after photographs surfaced of some members posing in Nazi uniforms at party meetings, the wearing of any kind of uniform was formally banned in 1996. During the 1990s, the party became more influenced by the French National Front, as well as the Freedom Party of Austria, the Danish People's Party, German The Republicans and Italian National Alliance. SDreceived economic support for the 1998 election from the French National Front, and was active in Le Pen's Euronat from the same time. SD,however, in 1999 left its membership in Euronat to its youth organisation. In 2001 the most extreme faction was expelled from the party, leading to the formation of the more radical National Democrats.\n\nDuring the 2000s the so-called \"Scania gang\", or \"Gang of Four\"Jimmie Åkesson (party leader since 2005), Björn Söder, Mattias Karlsson and Richard Jomshofcontinued and expanded the moderation policy, which included ousting openly extremist members. Before the 2002 election, former Moderate Party MP Sten Christer Andersson defected to SD, citing that the party had gotten rid of its extreme-right elements. In 2003 the party declared the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to be a cornerstone of its policies. In 2006 the party changed its logo from the torch to one featuring an \"Anemone hepatica\", reminiscent of the party's very first, but short-lived, logo (a stylized \"Myosotis scorpioides\").\n\nIn the 2010 general election, SDwon representation in the Swedish Riksdag for the first time, with5.7% of the vote and 20MPs.\n\nSweden Democrat MP William Petzäll was persuaded to leave the party on 26 September 2011 while still retaining his parliamentary seat. This was done because of Petzäll's substance abuse and the problems this might cause for SD'spublic image. Petzäll later died of an overdose and his seat was turned over to Stellan Bojerud in September 2012.\n\nIn November 2012, videos from August 2010 were released, in segments, over the course of three days by Swedish newspaper \"Expressen\" (a year earlier, \"Expressen\" had released the same videos without making much noise). This came to be known as the Iron pipe scandal, although the same videos had already been released on YouTube by Erik Almqvist in 2010. The videos, recorded by MP Kent Ekeroth, featured him along with fellow Sweden Democrats MP Erik Almqvist and Christian Westling. The videos show Almqvist arguing with comedian Soran Ismail: Almqvist is referring to Sweden as \"my country, not your country\", as an insult to Ismail. They are also shown arguing with a drunken man. A woman can also be seen approaching Kent Ekeroth while filming; he calls her a whore and pushes her out of the way. A few minutes later they are seen picking up iron bars. Coming only a month after party leader Åkesson had instated a zero-tolerance policy towards racism in the party, the release of the video caused Almqvist to leave his position as the party's economic policy spokesperson and his place in the executive committee on 14 November. He excused himself as having been under a lot of pressure and threats of violence at the time. As more segments of the video were released, revealing the other two men's involvement, the party announced on 15 November that Ekeroth would take a break from his position as the party's justice policy spokesman. Almqvist and Ekeroth both took time off from their parliament seats. Sweden Democratic Youth president Gustav Kasselstrand and vice president William Hahne criticized the decision to remove Almqvist and Ekeroth in an op-ed in Dagens Nyheter, arguing that the party should not give in to media pressure.\nOnly two weeks after Almqvist and Ekeroth were forced to step down, fellow MP Lars Isovaara reported being robbed of his backpack and pushed out of his wheelchair by \"two unknown men of an immigrant background\". When trying to get into the Riksdag, Isovaara was himself reported by the police for racial abuse against safety guards. The Sweden Democrats initially defended Isovaara, but backed down when \"Expressen\" revealed that Isovaara had actually forgotten his backpack at a restaurant, and that the two men had helped him when he fell out of his wheelchair. He left his seat in the Riksdag on 29 November, and was replaced by Markus Wiechel.\n\nIn the European election of 2014 SD received 9.67% of votes, winning two seats in the European Parliament and becoming the fifth party of the country. The party later joined the Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe and the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group.\n\nIn the 2014 election the Sweden Democrats received 12.9%of the votes, doubling their support and becoming the third-largest party. The party remained big in Scania and Blekinge; for example in Malmö the party received 14% of the votes, in Landskrona it received 19% of the votes and in Sjöbo a total of 30% rendering the party was the largest in that municipality. Other parties, however, remained firm in their decision to isolate them from exerting influence. Out of 29 constituencies electing parliamentarians, the party was the second largest in \"Scania North & East\" while being the third largest party in 25. Although relying heavily on rural areas and the deep south, the party also made strong inroads and results above 15% in some medium-sized central Sweden cities such as Norrköping, Eskilstuna and Gävle, indicating a widening of its voter base in all areas.\n\nSome time after that, Åkesson announced he would go on sick leave due to burnout. Mattias Karlsson was appointed to temporarily take over Åkesson's duties as party leader.\n\nOn Monday, 23 March 2015, it was announced that Åkesson would return from his leave of absence to resume his duties as party leader following an interview to be broadcast on the Friday, 27 March instalment of the \"Skavlan\" program on SVT, and a subsequent press conference with the Swedish media.\n\nAmid media coverage regarding the high immigration figures and the European migrant crisis, the Sweden Democrats soared in all opinion polls during the summer of 2015, even topping web-based polls from YouGov and Sentio in late summer, with a little over a quarter of the vote. The party also saw rising support in phone-based polls, although the swing was lower.\n\nOn 2 July 2018 the two Sweden Democrats MEP left the EFDD group and moved to the soft eurosceptic European Conservatives and Reformists.\n\nIn the 2018 general election, the SD increased its support to 17.6% of the vote, though it did not grow as much as most polls had predicted. According to Emily Schultheis of \"Foreign Policy\", the SD won an ideological victory, as it \"effectively set the terms for debate\" and forced its rivals to adopt immigration policies similar to its own, and other reporters made similar observations. The SD performed particularly well in Skåne County, having the highest number of voters in 21 out of the county's 33 municipalities. An SVT analysis of the results found that at least 22 seats in 17 city councils would be empty as the Sweden Democrats won more seats than the number of candidates it had. The party also received its first mayor, in Hörby Municipality.\n\nThe Sweden Democrats' party programme is based on nationalism and social conservatism. Its ideological basis is described in the party's manifesto, first published on 4 May 2003 during the Jansson leadership and then revised on 8 May 2005 (one day after Åkesson became the new chairman). Nordic Studies scholar Benjamin R. Teitelbaum has called them radical nationalist. The party has been described by sociologist Jens Rydgren and others as xenophobic, racist and right-wing populist. In 2013 a Sveriges Radio journalist called the party xenophobic, which resulted in a complaint lodged to the broadcasting regulator. The Swedish Broadcasting Commission determined that this description was acceptable to use. The party itself rejects the far-right label while placing itself in the political centre. The party officially reject both Fascism and Nazism. \n\nThe Sweden Democrats believe that the current Swedish immigration and integration policies have been a failure. They oppose integration because they believe that integration involves \"meeting in the middle\" and do not think that the Swedish people should have to bear the burden of what they claim is a reckless immigration policy. SDfeels that the current situation, with a large number of immigrants living in cultural enclaves, is not beneficial for the country. They argue that the immigrants themselves are rootless, that there have been rising antagonistic tensions between various population groups (socially, ethnically, religiously and culturally), and the immigration in itself, SD says, has caused social and economic strains on the country.\n\nAs the party considers Sweden to have had too much immigration in recent years, which it claims has seriously threatened national identity and societal cohesion, SDwants to reinstate a common Swedish national identity, which in turn would mean a stronger inner solidarity. SDrejects the policy of multiculturalism. SD wishes to strongly restrict immigration, and give generous support for immigrants who instead of wanting to assimilate in Sweden voluntarily prefer to emigrate back to their country of origin. As more state funds are made free from funding mass immigration, SD believes that Sweden will be better able to help refugees in their own nearby locations.\n\nSD has referred to the recommendations from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) which state that the return of refugees should be the solution to refugee problems. Torbjörn Kastell (former party secretary from 2003 to 2004) said in 2002 that the party wanted \"a multicultural world, not a multicultural society\". In a 2008 survey, a significant minority of 39% of all Swedes thought that there were \"too many foreigners in the country\", and in 2007 a survey showed that 49% of all Swedes wanted to restrict the number of asylum-seekers. In recent years SDhas tried to approach the immigration policy of the Danish People's Party, which from 2001 to 2011 provided parliamentary support for the former Danish liberal/conservative government in return for a tightening of Danish immigration policies and stricter naturalization laws.\n\nAccording to \"Aftonbladet\", 14%of SD members are of immigrant origin, which matches the share of foreign-born inhabitants of Sweden. For the 2010 election in the municipality of Södertälje (Stockholm County), SDwas the only party with a majority of immigrants on its electoral list, mostly Assyrians from the Middle East. Polling7.31%(3,447 votes), SD'smunicipal list in Södertälje got 5of the65 municipal seats. Nader Helawi and four other Swedes of immigrant origin will sit as municipal councilors.\n\nSD wishes to lower the tax rate for the elderly, as well as increase subsidized housing for the elderly. SD also wishes to allocate additional resources to municipalities in order to provide seniors with greater food assistance and, in general, improve their quality of life. SD has also emphasized a desire to crack down on abuses and crimes of which the elderly are particular targets.\n\nThe Sweden Democrats are critical of the special rights given to the indigenous Sami people of northern Sweden. In 2008 the party accepted a motion against the rights to reindeer husbandry. They have argued that those \"who do not involve themselves with reindeer husbandry are treated as second class citizens\" and that the privileges the herders have are \"undemocratic\". They want to restructure the councils and funds that are used to benefit the Sami population, so that they are used \"regardless of ethnic identity and business operations\". They also want to abolish the Sami Parliament, which claims special privileges for an \"ethnic minority while the society claims equal rights for others\".\n\nIn an interview for \"Dagens Nyheter\", Second Deputy Speaker of the Riksdag and then-party secretary Björn Söder elaborated on the SDparty programme with respect to its views on national identity by saying that he personally did not think people with dual national identities in Sweden would necessarily identify themselves as Swedish. Although an immigrant of any ethnic background in theory can become a Swedish citizen, they would have to adapt and be assimilated in order to be considered Swedish in the cultural sense. Björn Söder stated that the officially recognized Swedish minority peoples (e.g. Sami, Tornedalians and Jews) in many cases have dual cultural identities and that they probably would be proud of both heritages. It was widely interpreted that Söder had stated in the interview that Jews cannot be Swedish unless they abandon their Jewish identity. Söder's comments were understood to be anti-semitic and caused Swedish parliamentary groups and party leaders to call for Björn Söder's resignation. The Simon Wiesenthal Center listed the statement as number six on their list of the top ten most anti-semitic events of 2014. Söder responded in the \"Jerusalem Post\", denying the charges of anti-semitism and claiming \"Dagens Nyheter\" had taken his statements out of context.\n\nSD wishes to instate the possibility of life without parole for the worst crimes and to repatriate foreign citizens found guilty of serious crime. SD also wants to establish a public register of convicted pedophiles.\n\nIn its foreign policy, the Sweden Democrats reject joining the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union and are opposed to the accession of Turkey to the European Union. The party supports renegotiating the Schengen Agreement and holding a referendum on Sweden's European Union membership.\n\nThe Sweden Democrats advocates a cultural policy that would strip funding for multicultural initiatives and strengthen support for traditional Swedish culture. This agenda has often manifest as opposition to state funding of immigrant cultural organizations and festivals, and support for traditional Swedish craft, folk music, and folk dance groups. The party also tends to oppose state support for cultural initiatives deemed provocative or elitist. A 2014 letter signed by 52Swedish anthropologists, including Ronald Stade, criticized the Sweden Democrats' use of the terms \"culture\" (\"kultur\") and \"anthropology\" (\"antropologi\"), claiming their views on culture were \"essentialist and obsolete\", clarifying that culture is \"dynamic\" and \"in constant change\". The Sweden Democrats criticize modern art and want the citizens to be able to vote about public art.\n\"The important thing is that what is expressed in the public environment is anchored to the citizens and especially the local residents who are most often in the environment so that they feel an identification\" says the party's cultural spokesperson Aron Emilsson.\n\nThe Sweden Democrats also want a ban on burqa in public places.\n\nThe Sweden Democrats considers children raised in a traditional nuclear family as the preferred option for the child's development. Those not raised by their biological parents should have the right to associate with or at least find out who they were. SD opposes government sanctioned adoption to single people, same-sex couples and polyamorous relationships unless the adopting party are close relatives or already have a close relationship with the child. Insemination for same-sex couples and polyamorous groups is also discouraged, though weddings should be decided by each religious institution.\n\nAlthough SDstrongly criticizes what it calls a \"Homosex Lobby\", the party claims that it is not hostile to homosexuals. Furthermore, party leader Jimmie Åkesson expressed concern that what he describes as Islamization of Sweden will eventually lead to the rights of sexual minorities being violated.\n\nPublished by SD Party secretary Björn Söder on 1 August 2007, a blog article titled \"Botten måste snart vara nådd\" (Soon enough we'll hit rock bottom) led to intense debate and criticism.\n\nThe party argues that other countries should reduce their emissions instead of Sweden which they believe is already doing enough on that front. The party advocates keeping nuclear power plants as a prominent energy source in Sweden.\n\nDuring the 1990s many outspoken far-right advocates were involved with the party. The party had flyers printed by the French National Front in the 1998 general election, and was financially backed for the 2004 European election by Belgian Bernard Mengal.\n\nThe Sweden Democrats have complained about difficulties buying advertising space due to the media banning the party from advertisement, which has been criticised by free speech organisations. On 16 June 2006, \"Dagens Nyheter\" and \"Svenska Dagbladet\" decided to stop their boycott. \"Expressen\", however, still retains a ban on Sweden Democrat advertising.\n\nAfter the Danish daily newspaper \"Jyllands-Posten\" published twelve cartoons depicting Muhammad and ignited a controversy during the2005 autumn and winter, the Sweden Democrats gave their unreserved support to the publication with reference to the freedom of speech. SDstated that it saw no reason why a Danish newspaper should be forced to abide by Muslim rules and prohibitions regarding expression. When the boycott of Danish products was launched in the Middle East, SDlaunched a \"Buy Danish\" campaign in support of Danish workers. In 2006 SD entered the Muhammad cartoon debate by publishing a cartoon depicting Muhammad on its youth league (SDU) and \"SD-Kuriren\" websites. The cartoon showed Muhammad from behind holding a mirror in front of his face. However, instead of any facial features, the mirror showed only a blank head. The cartoon was captioned \"Muhammad's Face\" ().\n\nThe publication attracted the attention of the Swedish government, which informed internet service provider \"Levonline\" about the SD's publications. Subsequently, \"Levonline\" shut down SD's web page. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Laila Freivalds, denied any direct interference. However, at the same time, Laila Freivalds condemned the publication as a provocation. Freivalds then resigned from the Persson Cabinet after being accused of interference with press freedom and lying about such actions.\n\nThis event spurred debate on government censorship in Sweden. The Sweden Democrats also had a hate speech charge filed against them due to the posted caricature. Similar hate speech charges were filed against other Swedish publishers who had depicted Muhammad. However, these charges were immediately deemed to be unfounded by the Swedish Chancellor of Justice (\"Justitiekanslern\").\n\nThe Sweden Democrats originally planned to publish a set of cartoons in their newspaper \"SD-Kuriren\". However, after the controversy erupted, Jimmie Åkesson issued a statement on SD's website on 9 February 2006, stating that they would refrain from further publications online and in print, due to concerns that publishing might spur hostile actions against Swedes and Swedish interests.\n\nThe shutdown of the Sweden Democrats' websites was reported to the Committee on the Constitution by the Liberal People's Party leader Lars Leijonborg. SD filed charges against the Security Service (\"Säpo\") and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs with the \"Justitiekansler\" and \"Justitieombudsmannen\", alleging that the government's interference was unconstitutional. The spokesperson of the Green Party, Peter Eriksson, also expressed concern over possible government involvement in the event.\n\nThe Sweden Democrats have, among all Swedish parliamentary parties, had the largest share of elected municipal representatives resign since the 2010 elections (27.8%). Many of these resignations were brought on by racist statements or actions by these representatives.\n\nIn November 2012, party spokesperson Erik Almqvist resigned after he had been caught on tape making racist and sexist statements. Another video later surfaced, showing how Almqvist, in addition to party spokesperson Kent Ekeroth and party official Christian Westling were arming themselves with aluminium pipes before they sought out a confrontation with Soran Ismail, a Swedish comedian of Kurdish descent.\n\nIn November 2012, parliamentarian Lars Isovaara resigned after accusing two people of foreign origin of stealing his bag (which Isovaara had left at a restaurant) and then proceeding to verbally abuse a security guard of a foreign background. Isovaara's replacement in parliament, Markus Wiechel, was found in April 2013 to have referred to a group of black people as \"monkeys\".\n\nIn March 2013, 12 individuals were thrown out of the party for their involvement in neo-Nazi or other extremist movements.\n\nIn November 2013, parliamentarian and then vice party leader Jonas Åkerlund gained attention for having called immigrants \"parasites\" during a broadcast on SD's own radio station in 2002, after the recording was publicly rediscovered. In his defence, Åkerlund stated that he only said it to provoke people.\n\nIn September 2014, a few weeks before the general election, the party chairman of the local Stockholm branch, Christoffer Dulny, resigned from his position. He had been posting mocking comments about immigrants, calling them \"shameless liars\" on alternative media sites. He also resigned from his newly won position in the parliament on the same day he was elected, 29 September 2014.\n\nIn October 2016, a video of the parliamentarian and economic policy spokesperson Oscar Sjöstedt making antisemitic jokes was released. Whilst at a party, believed to have taken place in 2011, he laughingly told a story about former co-workers with Nazi sympathies mocking Jews and comparing them to sheep.\n\nDuring the same month, the parliamentarian and second vice party leader Carina Herrstedt was confronted with having sent an allegedly racist, antisemitic, homophobic and anti-romanyist email to her then spouse in 2011. The email, which had been leaked from the party's internal servers, for instance contained phrases that named black football players from the team Landskrona BoIS as \"niggers\" whilst also picturing Romani people as thieves.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2016 various members of the party were expelled from the SD for expressing extremist or racist views, or because of disagreement with the party's shift towards moderation and social conservatism. In April 2015, the Sweden Democratic Youth leaders were also expelled for these reasons, and the organization was dissolved shortly after. In December 2016, the parliamentarian Anna Hagwall was thrown out of the party after using arguments associated with antisemitism to argue for a bill that she introduced in parliament intended to reduce concentration of media ownership in Sweden.\n\nIn September 2017, a report from \"Dagens ETC\" found that 14 former municipal representatives of the party had infiltrated the SD in order to financially support the Nordic Resistance Movement, a neo-Nazi organization, through financial transactions, memberships, or purchases of antisemitic and racist literature or souvenirs. In August 2018, 2 members were kicked out due to purchases of Nazi memorabilia online; following the expulsions, Michael Erlandsson, one of the SD spokesmen, publicly stated that people who \"have these types of views and share these types of materials\" have no place in the party. 14 candidates were expelled from the party as well after being exposed as former members of neo-Nazi organizations. Referring to the latest expulsions, SD leader Jimmie Åkesson declared that the party \"works extremely hard to keep clean\".\n\nAshley Fox, leader of the British Conservative MEPs, praised the Sweden Democrats regarding the party's policy decisions on the expulsion of extremist and racist members: \"Over the past decade the Sweden Democrats have made progress in reforming themselves, expelling any members displaying unacceptable views or behaviour and diversifying their party base.\"\n\nThe Sweden Democrats came under fire in 2015 for changing their position on profits made by private welfare companies. Before the election in 2014 they favored having restrictions on the amount of profit that welfare companies could take and use for their own gain. After the election they have favored the approach of the Alliance parties, that is higher and more restrictive quality standards. This has been suspected to be because of extensive lobbying done by the organisation Svenskt Näringsliv among others.

SD has denied all accusations of corruption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Statistiska Centralbyrån (SCB) 2017 party preference survey the Sweden Democrats (SD) have a stronger support among men than among women. There is no noticeable difference in support for the party among different age groups. The support for SD is greater among native born than among foreign born.

Patterson, and distributed by Paramount Pictures and MTV Films. The main plot revolves around Darrin Hill (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who travels to his hometown of Monte Carlo, Georgia as he attempts to revive a church choir in order to enter a gospel competition with the help of a beautiful lounge singer, Lilly (Beyoncé), with whom he falls in love. Through the choir's music, Darrin brings the church community back together all the while seeking a relationship with Lilly.\n\nThe film is notable for its soundtrack and ensemble cast. The film received mixed reviews upon release.\n\nIn 1980, a young boy named Darrin Hill (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and his mother, MaryAnn (Faith Evans), are run out of their hometown after MaryAnn is soon discovered to be singing secular music when she sings in a church choir. After being confronted about this by the self-righteous Paulina Pritchett (LaTanya Richardson), MaryAnn is forced to choose between singing professionally or remaining in the choir. MaryAnn and Darrin are last seen on a bus saying goodbye to Aunt Sally, as they sadly wave to each other.\n\nIn 2003, Darrin has grown up to become a successful advertising executive in New York City with a bad habit of lying. His only true friend and secretary, Rosa Lopez (Lourdes Benedicto), does a good job at keeping his credit problems under control. However, Darrin has achieved so much under false pretenses, having faked his college degree and high school diploma and lied about being the son of a congressman. Eventually, his lies soon catch up with him and get him in trouble with his paranoid boss (Dakin Matthews) and Darrin loses his job. After being tracked down by a private investigator, Darrin soon finds out that Aunt Sally has died.\n\nDarrin returns to his hometown where he finds a new friendship in Lucious (Mike Epps), the town's happy-go-lucky, womanizing cab driver (who also has a fear of the Lord). After Aunt Sally's funeral Darrin soon learns from the Reverend that Aunt Sally had stated in her will that he must direct the church choir and enter the annual \"Gospel Explosion\" competition and win the prize money of $10,000 and in doing so, will inherit Aunt Sally's stock in the company that produces the show which is currently worth $150,000.\n\nUpon taking charge of the once-powerful choir, Darrin discovers that it has fallen into decline over the years, with only a handful of members remaining.\n\nAfter several setbacks, Darrin eventually recruits many new members, most of which he does so by promising half of the competition's prize money to them (though he has no intention of paying anyone). He also reconnects with his childhood friend and crush Lilly (Beyoncé), who has faced ostracization from the townspeople similar to MaryAnn's, due to her being an R&B nightclub singer, and having a son, Dean, out of wedlock. Lilly, at first, refuses to join the choir as she is both disgusted by Darrin's romantic advances and because she doesn't want to put up with the townpeople's criticism of her, but with some assurance from Darrin, she ultimately relents and becomes the new lead singer of the choir, causing Paulina to quit in retaliation.\n\nBefore their performance begins, Darrin tells Lilly that she inspired him to name the choir \"The Fighting Temptations\".\n\nAfter an outstanding performance, the choir wins the competition, but before ending his acceptance speech, Darrin starts a proper relationship with Lilly by surprising her with an unexpected marriage proposal, to which she accepts. Eighteen months later, the two are shown to be happily married with a baby of their own.\n\n\n\nThe film crew used several locations throughout Georgia. The final scene was filmed in Columbus, GA at the RiverCenter for the Performing Arts. Several of the extras were local residents of Columbus, GA.\n\nThe music of the film received universal acclaim, most notably, Beyoncé's cover of \"Fever\".\n\nHowever, the film itself received generally mixed reviews upon its release. The film was criticized for its allegedly poor dialogue, rehashed premise and romantic chemistry between the film's lead actors (Cuba Gooding Jr. and Beyoncé) as well as their noticeable age difference. Despite the mixed reviews the film opened at #2. Notably, Ebert & Roeper reviewed the film and Roger Ebert gave it thumbs up, while Richard Roeper gave it thumbs down. It holds a 42% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThe movie was a minor success at the box office, with a worldwide gross of US$32,445,215 but failed to produce enough revenue for a second installment to go into production (though the primary actors had signed on for one).\n\nHowever, the cast themselves were very pleased with the film, citing its uplifting story and soundtrack. Gooding has confessed in several interviews following the film's release that he enjoyed filming his kissing scenes with Beyoncé. In a 2011 interview on \"The Late Late Show\", Gooding made a humorous reference to this by saying: (In the false words of the host) \"Didn't he make love with Beyoncé on the set of something?\".\n\nA soundtrack accompanied the film and was released by Sony on September 9, 2003 prior to the film itself. The soundtrack received generally positive reviews and was more successful than the film itself. Only one song from the album, \"Summertime\", is not included in the movie. The late R&B legend Luther Vandross also recorded a song for the film called \"Shine\" but it failed to make the final cut of the film as well as the soundtrack. The most obvious reference to this is the fact that Vandross frequently says the title of the film in the song. The song \"Come Back Home\" appears in the film, but was not included on the soundtrack album. It also noted that several other songs performed during the movie including \"Church Is in Mourning (Aunt Sally's Funeral Tribute)\" by Shirley Caesar, \"Won't Ever Change\" by Mary Mary, \"Waiting\" by Ramiyah, and \"Soldier\" by The Blind Boys of Alabama, were also not included on the soundtrack.\n\n\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD on February 3, 2004. While there is a high-definition digital release, it has yet to be released on Blu-ray Disc as of 2018.\n\nIn a 2003 interview with the late Mickey Jones, (who had a supporting role in the film), for HollywoodJesus.com, he stated that he hoped the film performed well because all of the principal actors had signed on for a sequel. As a result of the film's underperformance at the box office, a continuation never materialized.\n\n"}

{"id": "6585476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6585476", "title": "Thiruppavai", "text": "Thiruppavai\n\nThe Tiruppavai (Tamil:திருப்பாவை) is a collection of thirty stanzas (\"paasurams\") written in Tamil by Andal (also known as Nachiyar), in praise of the Lord Perumal, (Vishnu). It is part of Divya Prabandha, a work of the twelve Alvars, and is important part of Tamil literature. Kodhai Devi or Goda Devi/Andal incarnated on earth in the 98th year after the beginning of the Kali Era (3102 BC). She performed a wonderful vratham or vow called Dhanurmasa vratham to tell us that, by practicing this vratham, one can attain all materialistic happiness along with the eternal bliss. The period, from when the sun moves into the constellation of Dhanur-rasi or Sagittarius and until it moves out to the constellation of Makara-rasi or Capricorn is known as Dhanurmasam.\nIn Thiruppavai, Andal gives a universal call to all people to recite the name and glories of Lord Vishnu.\n\nA summary:\nAfter the sun sets, according to the Vedic scriptures, the period just before the ensuing dawn is called Bramhamuhurtham. It is an auspicious time, for it gives good thoughts and intentions. Practices like meditation and penances done during this hour, give favorable results.\nAccording to the Vedic calendar, one Earth-year is equal one celestial day. So the last six months on the earth (every year) is equal to one celestial night. Hence, the predawn period, the Bramhamuhurtha, for the heavenly beings falls in the month of Dhanurmasam. Andal taught us this Dhanurmasa vratham because she wanted us to spend these auspicious days in contemplation of God. This vratham was performed for Krishna. Krishna means good happiness. Man is always in the quest for happiness, in order to attain which, he engages himself in various kinds of jobs. But pursuit of materialistic happiness will eventually lead to sorrow. So, Andal performed this vratham desiring the eternal blissful God. She desired and attained Him.\n\nIt is not easy for man to know who God is and the means to reach him. Air is not visible to our naked eye. We know the presence of air, because if we stop breathing, we die. Similarly, according to the poem, we must realize that there is a divine energy which is the cause and controller of our activities, our present form and name. He can be easily attained in His form as an idol or archa murthi. He exists as an archa murthi with the same auspicious qualities as He is in His highest divine abode Paramapadam. Let us worship Him and ask Him whatever we want. He will suitably grant us everything. Kodhai Devi instilled such a faith through her pasurams (poems).\n\nAccording to the poem God is only one and He appears in various forms for our sake. He accepts our offerings and blessings even when He is worshipped in an idol-form in our house. It is for this reason Kodha Devi performed the vratham near the deity Vatapathrasai. She desired for Lord Sri Ranganatha, she worshipped Lord Sundarabahu, she asked us to reach Sri Venkatachalapathi. This she did to create the faith that God exists in all forms. By whatever name one calls, He is there for us, dwelling on the seven hills as Srinivasa or Lord Balaji in Tirumala, the God of the Kali Yuga, the primeval cause of the creation, the husband of Lakshmi Devi who is Srimannarayana. In order to remind us of this, Andal prayed, so we might be able to do service in the temple of Venkateshwara.\n\nAccording to the poem the symbolic undertone behind Andal’s entreaty to her friends to wake up and seek Krishna subsumes the essence of the three basic mantras in the Vaishnava tradition — the Tirumantram, Dvayam and Charama Sloka that signify the truth of the paramatma or the Supreme being who dwells in everything. There is a hidden meaning in the 27th pasuram, for example, where Andal explains the importance of an acharya whose guidance is mandatory for a disciple to get these trio of mantras. If the meaning is taken literally, it appears that Kodhai Devi is asking for some of the ornaments for the vratham, but in there explains the importance of these three mantras in a symbolic way. Every pasuram has this detailed undertone which must actually be realized.\n\nTiruppavai is said to be 'Vedam Anaithukkum Vithagum', meaning it is the seed of the vedam. As the entire tree and the trees coming from it are hidden in the subtle seed, so is the entire essence of vedam hidden in Tiruppavai which can be revealed only under the guidance of an acharya or a guru who is well versed in vedic scriptures.\n\nThis entire hidden essence is mentioned in the Andal's verses in the form of poetry.\n\nThiruppavai belongs to the Pavai genre of songs, a unique Tamil tradition sung in the context of the Pavai vow (Vratham or ritual) observed throughout the month of \"Margazhi\". Sri Vaishnavas sing these stanzas every day of the year in the temple as well as in their homes. This practice assumes special significance during \"Margazhi\": each day of this month gets its name from one of the thirty verses. There are references to this vow in the late-sangam era Tamil musical anthology \"Paripadal\".\n\nAndal's thirty songs contain the cardinal principles of Vaishnava dharma during the month of \"Marghazhi\". Vaishnavas sing these songs to bring peace, prosperity and Divine Grace. Andal assumes the guise of a cowherd in these 30 verses. Andal appears intent upon performing a particular religious vow to marry the Lord, thereby obtain His everlasting company, and inviting all her girl-friends to join her. Towards the end we learn that she did not actually perform a religious rite; but is simply praying to be granted the service of the Lord for eternity. She yearns for everlasting happiness and service of the Lord.\nThe first five stanzas provide an introduction to the main theme, its principle and purpose. According to Andal one should give up luxuries during this season. Sincere prayers to the God would bring abundant rain and thus prosperity. Offering Lord Krishna fresh flowers would expiate sins committed earlier and those that may be committed in future.\n\nIn the next ten stanzas she describes the importance of community participation. She invites her friends to gather flowers. She essays the ambience at her village, the chirping of birds, colorful blossoms, the musical sound of butter-churning, herds of cattle with tinkling bells, the sounding of the conch from the temple.\n\nShe visits each household and awakens all her friends to join her for a bath in a nearby pond. She also praises the incarnations of the Lord. The next five stanzas describe her visit to the temple accompanied by her friends. She desires to render \"Suprabhata\" gently to wake up the Lord. The group appeases the temple guards, enters the temple and recites prayers extolling the parents of Lord Krishna and begging them to wake up Krishna and Balarama. Then they approach Neela Devi, the consort of the Lord, to have a \"darshan\".\n\nThe last nine stanzas are on the glories of the Lord. On receiving his blessings Andal lists her demands; milk for the \"vrata\", white conch, lamps, flowers, and rich costume and jewellery, plenty of ghee and butter. The concluding stanza is an \"envoie\" identifying her as the daughter of Vishnucittar who made this garland of 30 pasurams and says those who recite with devotion will have Lord’s blessings.\n\nThe Thiruppavai also includes 3 thaniyans (literally, 'singletons' or stand alone verses) composed by later authors to introduce older texts. The first tanniyan, 'Nila tungastana ... ' in Sanskrit was composed by Parasara Pattar, and the next two tanniyans, 'Anna vayal pudhuvai ... ' and \"Choodi kodutha...\" (translated below) were composed by Sri Uyyakondar.\n\nThaniyan\n\nThis is a song which is a prelude to Tiruppavai and is generally termed as taniyan or \"that which stands separately\".\n\nAndal from the swan filled Puduvai,\nSang she, in her sweet voice,\nSeveral enchanting sweet odes,\nFor being sung during,\nThe worship and adulation of Pavai.\nThey are but a garland to him,\nFrom her who wore them first,\nBefore presenting them to Him.\n\nEach Pasuram(ode to Gods) of Thiruppavai is generally named by the first few words of the poem.These are given first and a translation into verse given then:-\n\nIn Thailand, an annual Giant Swing ceremony known as \"Triyampavai-Tripavai\" was held in major cities until 1935, when it was abolished for safety reasons. The name of the ceremony was derived from the names of two Tamil Hindu chants: \"Thiruvempavai\" (a Shaivite hymn by Manikkavacakar) and \"Thiruppavai\". It is known that Tamil verses from \"Thiruvempavai\" — \"poet pratu sivalai\" (\"opening the portals of Shiva's home\") — were recited at this ceremony, as well as the coronation ceremony of the Thai king. According to T.P. Meenakshisundaram, the name of the festival indicates that Thiruppavai might have been recited as well.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48136206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48136206", "title": "Udiya Baba", "text": "Udiya Baba\n\nUdiya Baba (1875 – 1948), (Devanagari: उड़िया बाबा) was a Hindu saint and guru. He was a teacher of Advaita Vedanta and was regarded to be a \"Paramahansa\". He was a \"Parivrajaka\", i.e. one who does not stay in any one place for too long. He would walk all along the banks of Ganges, moving from one place to another. Udiya means one who hails from Orissa. Baba means a \"Sadhu\". Sometime during 1937-38, he came to Vrindavan and an ashram named Shri Krishna Ashram (also known as Oriya Baba Ashram) was constructed by his disciples as a place for his permanent stay. He was a contemporary of the very well known Hindu saints - Anandamayi Ma and Shri Baba of Mokalpur.\n\nHe was born at Jagannath Puri in 1875 of \"Vikram Samvat\", on \"Bhadrapada Krishna Saptami\", on Monday, at noon. That was the day of Krishna \"Janmashtami\" for \"Smartas\". The year was 1875. His father's name was Shri Vaidyanath Mishra who was a direct descendant of Shri Kashi Mishra who lived during the time of Chaitanya Maha Prabhu and was an ardent desiciple of the same. His childhood name of was Artatrana, which is one of the names of Lord Vishnu meaning 'protector of those in distress'.\n\nFrom the age of four to twelve, he learnt to read and write Oriya language, mathematics as well as some knowledge of Sanskrit at home. He was enthusiastic to learn more so one day he left his home without informing anyone and reached a place called Balyabeda, where he studied Sanskrit for five years and passed a course of \"Kavya-teertha\".\n\nOrissa had a severe famine. Thousands of people were dying due to starvation. He therefore decided to serve the needy, but soon realized that in spite of his herculean efforts, he could not improve the situation much. He felt deeply saddened by his inability to help people at large. It was then that he thought of obtaining the mythological \"Akshaya Patra\". A bowl which can yield unlimited supply of food and which is inexhaustible. \"Akshaya Patra\" is also called as \"Annapoorna Siddhi\", which is believed to be bestowed by Annapoorna devi, the Hindu mythological goddess of food and nourishment, and his devotees believed he possessed this mystic power. One finds the description of such magical bowl in the epic Mahabharata. Krishna had gifted it to Draupadi during her exile with the Pandavas. To obtain such a bowl he decided to do penance i.e. \"tapasya\". He left his home on the 5th day of \"Chaitra\" month, of 1951 \"Vikram Samvat\" era, towards goddess Kamakhya temple in Guwahati in Assam. During his stay there, he happened to listen to a discourse on a treatise of Advaita Vedanta called 'Viveka Chudamani'. Inspired by the knowledge of Nondualism his views were transformed and he started to question the very motive of his penance. He thought, what will he gain even if the goddess granted him his wish of obtaining the Akshaya Patra. How many people would he be able to benefit, and how long would he, for that matter, going to live on this planet, besides would all the problems of people be solved by finding food alone?? Therefore, he discontinued his penance and traveled to Kashi and then back home to Jagannath Puri.\n\nAfter coming home, he met and persuaded Swami Shri Madhusudan Tirth who was the Jagadguru and Shankaracharya of Govardhana Peetham at Jagannath Puri, to give him \"Naishthik\" \"Brahmacharya\" \"Diksha\" i.e. initiation into lifelong celibacy. Then he was given a new name of \"Brahmachari\" Vasudeva Swarup. His age was 22 years old.\n\nSoon he decided to take a pilgrimage for searching an accomplished \"'siddha\"' or Guru. He wandered and searched out entire India from Benares i.e Kashi to Rameshwaram. During this journey, he experienced many miracles and spiritual wonders, met many \"sadhus\", mahants and spiritual men. After staying in Rameshwaram for 10 days, he visited Pandharpur, Poona, Mumbai, and then reached Haridwar and Rishikesh. But no matter where he searched, he could not find any true \"siddha\". After such a long pilgrimage which he throughout did walking, he returned to Govardhana Math in Jagannath Puri.\n\nHe accepted \"Sannyasa\" from Swami Shri Madhusudan Tirth, the Jagadguru and Shankaracharya of Govardhana Peetham at Jagannath Puri, at the age of 32, in 1964 of \"Vikram Samvat\". Then he received a new name as Swami Purnananda Tirtha, since he was also carrying a staff, he was called \"Dandi Swami\" Purnananda Tirtha.\n\nUdiya Baba would teach people according to their natural inclinations. He would teach a follower of \"Bhakti\" the secrets of devotion as well as to a follower of \"Jnana\" by helping him understand the true nature of Brahman. He would keep the students of these two paths separate, saying that one should proceed in whatever path one is naturally inclined to. He would say it was difficult for common people to understand texts like Yoga Vasistha, therefore for such people, he would make arrangements for Ramayana, Bhagvad Gita, Bhagavatam. Along with \"Vairagya\" i.e dispassion, he would stress the importance of practice or Sādhanā. Regarding practice, he would say, referring to his own experience that what is only the Pure Consciousness appears, to be a hard physical body due to constant wrong thinking. This is the effect of practice! Therefore it is necessary to constantly practice the opposite thinking. He used to say, there are three stages of practice, first understanding oneself to be different from the physical body. When this practice becomes perfect, one develops the identification with the subtle body. Second, after this, experiencing the detachment from the objects of senses. As a result of this practice, the vision shifts from the subtle body and abides in the causal body, then thirdly comes the experience of separation from pain and pleasure. With this practice the vision or identification shifts from all the four functions of the mind and abides in the Self. He always said one must accept everyone as he or she is, without any desire to change anyone in the slightest.\n\nIn the afternoon of \"Chaitra\" \"Krishna Chaturdasi\" of 2005 \"Vikram Samvat\", the date being 8th May 1948, he was fatally assaulted by a deranged man named Thakur Das. His mortal body was given a \"Jala Samadhi\" i.e. immersion in the holy waters of Yamuna.\n\n"}

He was the last spiritual leader of the ancient Jewish community of Iraq, which was airlifted to Israel in 1952.\n\nYaakov Mutzafi was born in Baghdad, Ottoman Iraq, the son of Ezra Mutzafi and Mazal Tov. He received an early Torah education from his grandfather, Rabbi Moshe Mutzafi, and his primary education at Midrash Talmud Torah alongside his life-long friend and colleague Silman Mutzafi. For his secondary education, Mutzafi was enrolled at Midrash Bet Zilkha, where he received instruction from Ephraim HaCohen, Shimon Agassi, and Sadqa Hussein, the latter with whom Mutzafi would share a lifetime of collaboration. He was later to be the student of Yehuda Fatiyah.\n\nMutzafi married the daughter of Rabbi Sasson Dangour, founder of Yeshivath Dorshei Torah, where he would subsequently continue his studies alongside Silman Hugi Aboudi.\n\nThe winds of war that were blowing in Europe in the late 1930s were about to leave their marks on the faraway Kingdom of Iraq. The British-backed monarchy was coming under increased pressure from pro-German Arab nationalists who were constantly agitating against the royal government, with Jews and other minorities caught in the middle.\n\nThe building political pressure boiled over into a bloody pogrom against the Jews in Baghdad on June 1–2, 1941, which became known as the farhud. Over 180 Jews were killed, with many more injured in the violence. Mutzafi raced to open up the gates of Midrash Bet Zilkha to the surviving Jews who were evicted from their homes, and arranged for their upkeep via donations received from philanthropists in the community.\n\nWith the tumultuous years of World War II over, the final chapter of the History of the Jews in Iraq was about to be written. With the founding of the new State of Israel, Jewish life in the Arab world was becoming more precarious by the day. Ever the pragmatist, Mutzafi understood that the wheels of history were turning fast, but without a favorable outcome for the community he so adored. Although he spent countless hours tending to the spiritual needs of a downtrodden people, he reasoned that there would be no viable future for the Jews in Iraq. He had previously spent one month visiting with his former teacher Sadqa Hussein in Jerusalem, and in 1950 he finally moved there. He immediately took up scholarly residence at Shemesh Sedaqah Synagogue, where he was to serve as hazzan and Rosh yeshiva, at first under the wing of his master. Upon the latter's death in 1961, Mutzafi inherited the full mantle of spiritual leadership of the transplanted community in Israel. Mutzafi would be seen in flowing jellabiya and fez giving council and administering blessings to Jews of various persuasions in the Beit Yisrael neighborhood.\n\nMutzafi served as Av Beth Din of the Sephardi Edah HaHaredith, an organization more closely associated with the anti-Zionist rabbis of the Ashkenazi Old yishuv. Mutzafi shared the same beliefs as his fellows in the Edah regarding their disassociation from the Israeli government, most notably regarding the ban on taking part in elections to the Knesset, even encouraging participation in Neturei Karta demonstrations.\n\nYaakov Mutzafi died in 1983, at the age of 83. He was buried at the Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery.\n\nMutzafi was a mentor to Chief Rabbi of Israel Mordechai Eliyahu.\nThe Jerusalem Municipality named a street in the Ramat Shlomo neighborhood in East Jerusalem after Mutzafi, as did the city of Beitar Illit.\n\n\n"}
