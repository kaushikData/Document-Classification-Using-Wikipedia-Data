While a number of occult works claim to be from earlier periods and other regions than where they were actually published, textual evidence demonstrates that the book must have been written between 1536 and 1583, which encompasses the claimed date of 1575. The final editing of the book was likely carried out by Theodor Zwinger, and was almost definitely published by Pietro Perna, leaving little doubt to the book's claimed Swiss origin. The author remains unknown, but Peterson believes one Jacques Gohory (1520–1576) to be the most likely possibility. Gohory, like Zwinger and Perna, was a Paracelsian.\n\nSome German manuscripts produced shortly after its publication attribute the work to Paracelsus, though without evidence.\n\nThe \"Arbatel\" mainly focuses on the relationship between humanity, celestial hierarchies, and the positive relationship between the two. The Olympian spirits featured in it are entirely original.\n\nA. E. Waite, quite clear of the Christian nature of the work (if dissatisfied with its ideas of practical magic), writes that the book is devoid of black magic and without any connection to the \"Greater\" or \"Lesser Keys of Solomon\". Unlike other grimoires, the \"Arbatel\" exhorts the magus to remain active in their community (instead of isolating themselves), favoring kindness, charity, and honesty over remote and obscure rituals.\n\nThe Bible is the source most often quoted and referred to throughout the work (indeed, the author appears to have almost memorized large portions of it, resulting in paraphrases differing from the Vulgate). The \"Arbatel\" cannot be understood if separated from the philosophy of Paracelsus, who appears to have coined the term \"Olympic spirits\", and was the inspiration for the \"Arbatel\"s understanding of elementals (including Paracelsus's gnomes and the uniquely Paracelsian \"Sagani\"), the macrocosm and microcosm, and experimentation combined with respect for ancient authorities. Indeed, the \"Arbatel\" is both broadly and deeply rooted in classical culture, including Ancient Greek philosophy, the Sibylline oracles and Plotinus, in addition to the contemporaneous theology and occult philosophy of figures such as Iovianus Pontanus and Johannes Trithemius. (All of these traits also feature in the works of Jacques Gohory, which Peterson claims as evidence for his theory of Gohory's authorship.)\n\nThe \"Arbatel\" was one of the most influential works of its kind from its period, inspiring figures such as Johann Arndt, Gerhard Dorn, Adam Haslmayr, Robert Fludd, Heinrich Khunrath and Valentin Weigel, in addition to its editor and publisher, Zwinger and Perna. It was possibly the first work to use \"Theosophy\" in an occult sense (as opposed to a synonym for theology), and for distinguishing between human (\"anthroposophia\") and divine knowledge (\"theosophia\"). Indeed, Jakob Böhme may have chosen the word \"Theosophy\" to describe his ideas due to its use in the \"Arbatel\". It was where Thomas Vaughan found the term anthroposophy, later adopted by Rudolf Steiner to describe his belief system. Not all reception was positive, however. The book was condemned by Johann Weyer in his \"De praestigiis daemonum\" as being \"full of magical impiety\", and by Reformed Church censor Simon Sulzer. In 1617, the University of Marburg took action against two professors who intended to use the grimoire as a textbook, and expelled a student obsessed with it. In 1623, an accused witch named Jean Michel Menuisier revealed that, despite not owning a copy of the \"Arbatel\", used a few invocations from it.\n\nJohn Dee wrote about studying the \"Arbatel\" (among many other occult works of the period). This influence lead Nicholas Clulee to posit that Dee did not see his angelic experiments as magical, but in fact religious, as both Dee's ceremonies and the magical system of the \"Arbatel\" begin with prayers to God that cautiously lead into requests to see heavenly angels. Dee also recorded calling upon at least the \"Arbatel\"s solar Olympian spirit Och. Swedish mystic Johannes Bureus credited the work for his interest in Kabbalah.\n\nElements of the \"Arbatel\" appear in a number of versions of the \"Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses\". Ebenezer Sibly and Frederick Hockley incorporated a number of elements from Robert Turner's translation of the \"Arbatel\" into their own magical works, including \"The Clavic or Key to the Magic of Solomon\" and \"The Complete Book of Magic Science\", the latter of which was one of many later sources for the \"Grimoire of Turiel\".\n\nA copy of the work was listed in the catalogue for the San Francisco Mercantile Library in 1854. Although access to it would have been restricted, its presence indicates that it played a role in American folk beliefs. In 1898, Arthur Edward Waite undertook the first historical study of grimoires as a genre, detailing the \"Arbatel\" as one of many important works. A copy of a German translation appeared in the Berlin publishing company Herman Barsdorf Verlag's \"Magische Werke\" in 1921. Occultist Stephen Skinner claims that the isopsephy of the names of the Olympic Spirits summing to 31, the numeration of \"AL\" as in Liber AL, may have been responsible for inspiring Aleister Crowley's \"Liber AL vel Legis\", although Skinner admits that the influence on Crowley may not have been conscious.\n\nThe first edition was published in 1575 in Basel, with no evidence for earlier editions despite some claims otherwise. Other editions include:\n\n"}

{"id": "9268641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9268641", "title": "Barnett Freedman", "text": "Barnett Freedman\n\nBarnett Freedman CBE, RDI (19 May 1901 in Stepney, London – 4 January 1958) was a British painter, commercial designer, book illustrator, typographer, and lithographer.\n\nBarnett Freedman was born in the east end of London, the son of Jewish immigrants from Russia. Freedman's only formal education was at an elementary school, and from the age of nine he spent much time in hospital. This period was filled by reading and learning how to draw and to play the violin. At the age of fifteen, he obtained work as an office boy, then turning to draughtsmanship, initially with a monumental mason and subsequently at an architect's office. The strong interest in letterforms that grew out of this everyday work was later to stand him in good stead. He was assiduous in attending evening classes at Saint Martin's School of Art, hoping to win a London County Council scholarship. Although Freedman was initially unsuccessful, William Rothenstein, Principal of the Royal College of Art, was impressed by his potential and used his influence to enable Freedman to be admitted to the College.\nAfter leaving the Royal College of Art in 1925, Freedman tried to earn his living as a painter. He married a fellow student, Beatrice Claudia Guercio; and, after hard times, gained an introduction to the publishers, Faber and Gwyer, for whom he illustrated Laurence Binyon's \"Wonder Night\", in the Ariel Poems series. Barnett illustrated two further titles, Walter de la Mare’s \"News\" and \"Behold This Dreamer\", and Roy Campbell’s \"Choosing a Mast\", while Claudia did sketches for de la Mare’s poem, \"A Snowdrop\". Barnett designed book jackets for the firm for twenty-five years. Nearly all were auto-lithographed on stone with hand-drawn lettering. During this period, he carried out a wide range of work for other publishers and worked extensively also on package design.\n\nFaber gave Freedman his first major commission, an assignment to design and illustrate Siegfried Sassoon's \"Memoirs of an Infantry Officer\". Published in 1931, the book was the subject of controversial reviews but brought him into prominence. Freedman had by that time become interested in the difficult medium of auto-lithography, where the artist draws his own designs on to the stones without the intervention of trade craftsmen or photomechanical means. He had received advice from T. E. Griffits, the most influential lithographer of the time, who held sway at Vincent Brooks, Day & Son.\n\nFollowing work on an annual report for the Post Office, Freedman was chosen to design the 1935 postage stamp issues to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of King George V. The distinctive and handsome nature of this work brought him to wider public notice. His work - which took him just a weekend - and the subsequent printing of the stamps was the subject of The King's Stamp, a documentary film by the GPO Film Unit. Freedman also designed Jubilee postal orders, in various values from sixpence to £1. Freedman was now recognised as a force in autolithographic printmaking, and his down-to-earth attitude and lack of pretension made him welcome among the craftsmen at the Curwen Press, the Baynard Press and Chromoworks, the leading firms in the industry. For the Baynard Press, he also designed the \"Baynard Claudia\" typeface, which he named after his wife, Beatrice Claudia Guercio. Guercio was also an artist of some repute and had herself been commissioned to design a new GPO greetings telegram to commemorate the 1937 Coronation of George VI.\n\nIn 1936 he illustrated George Borrow's \"Lavengro\" for the Limited Editions Club of New York. By this time Freedman’s lithography had entered a new phase, where the unique qualities of the medium were taken into a new dimension with the artist’s rainbow palette. Freedman developed a technique whereby the black and white illustrations printed by line block simulated lithography, bringing a unity to the book. Although \"Lavengro\" was poorly subscribed, George Macy, owner of the book club, admired Freedman's work to such an extent that he was subsequently commissioned to illustrate \"Henry IV Part One\", for the Limited Editions Club multi-volume Shakespeare. Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\" (1938) and \"Anna Karenina\" (1951) are recognised as two of the finest examples of twentieth century book design and have ensured Freedman an honoured place in the history of book production. For Macy's less exclusive Heritage Press, Freedman illustrated Dickens's \"Oliver Twist\" (1939), Emily Brontë's \"Wuthering Heights\" (1941) and Charlotte Brontë's \"Jane Eyre\" (1942). The Bronte novels are challenging for the illustrator, and Freedman’s interpretations were regarded as among the best.\n\nFreedman was also employed by Ealing Films to design its 'logo' and provide the publicity for feature films such as \"Johnny Frenchman\" and \"San Demetrio\". A constant stream of commercial design work provided him with a good living.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Second World War, Freedman was appointed as a full-time salaried war artist by the War Artists' Advisory Committee and sent to France in April 1940 to record the work of the British Expeditionary Force. He painted a number of works there but was frustrated by a perceived lack of support, particularly transport provision. He was evacuated to England in May 1940 and worked on coastal defence subjects in Sheerness and the Isle of Sheppey. His full-time contract with WAAC ended in February 1941 after which WAAC purchased individual pieces from him but also offered him several short-term contracts with the Admiralty. By July 1941, Freedman was on board HMS \"Repulse\", and produced the painting \"15 inch Gun Turret, HMS Repulse\". At the end of 1942 he began an album of portraits of aircraft factory workers and then spent time aboard HMS \"Tribune\", which resulted in another album of portraits and the painting \"Interior of a Submarine\"(1943), which was briefly displayed at the National Gallery before being removed from view under wartime censorship regulations. The painting is now in the permanent collection of the Tate. In June 1944 Freedman went to Portsmouth, before travelling to France after the D-Day landings. There he recorded scenes around the landing beaches and at the invasion headquarters, but in July was taken ill and sent to hospital in Liverpool.\n\nIn post-war years, as a teacher at the Royal College of Art and the Ruskin School of Art, he was regarded by many of his students as an inspiring, if unpredictable, mentor who had little regard for time-wasters.\n\nThe inimitable style of Freedman's book jackets drew the eye of the ‘bookshop prowlers’, as they were termed by Maurice Collis, an author who realised and admired the important role that Freedman’s art played in bookshop sales. Freedman produced a stream of colourful posters and black-and-white drawings for press advertisements. At Chromoworks he had total oversight of the production of the Lyons lithographs, a series of fine colour prints by British artists, which were displayed in the teashops of J. Lyons and Co., now regarded as a major achievement in bringing good art to 'the masses'. Unlike many of his contemporaries, who lived and worked into old age, Freedman's precarious health led to an early death, at work in his studio on 4 January 1958.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1442889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1442889", "title": "Contemplation", "text": "Contemplation\n\nContemplation is profound thinking about something. In a religious sense, contemplation is usually a type of prayer or meditation.\n\nThe word \"contemplation\" is derived from the Latin word \"contemplatio\". Its root is also that of the Latin word \"templum\", a piece of ground consecrated for the taking of auspices, or a building for worship, derived either from Proto-Indo-European base *\"tem\"- \"to cut\", and so a \"place reserved or cut out\", or from the Proto-Indo-European base *\"temp\"- \"to stretch\", and thus referring to a cleared space in front of an altar. The Latin word \"contemplatio\" was used to translate the Greek word \"θεωρία\" (\"theōría\").\n\nContemplation was an important part of the philosophy of Plato; Plato thought that through contemplation the soul may ascend to knowledge of the Form of the Good or other divine Forms. Plotinus as a (neo)Platonic philosopher also expressed contemplation as the most critical of components for one to reach henosis. \nTo Plotinus the highest contemplation was to experience the vision of God, the Monad or the One. Plotinus describes this experience in his works the Enneads. According to his student Porphyry, Plotinus stated that he had this experience of God four times. Plotinus wrote about his experience in Enneads 6.9.xx...\n\nIn Islamic tradition, it is said that Muhammad would go into the desert, climb a mountain known as Mount Hira, and seclude himself from the world. While on the mountain, he would contemplate life and its meaning.\n\nIn Eastern Christianity, contemplation (theoria) literally means to see God or to have the Vision of God. The state of beholding God, or union with God, is known as theoria. The process of Theosis which leads to that state of union with God known as theoria is practiced in the ascetic tradition of Hesychasm. Hesychasm is to reconcile the heart and the mind into one thing (see nous).\n\nContemplation in Eastern Orthodoxy is expressed in degrees as those covered in St John Climacus' Ladder of Divine Ascent. The process of changing from the old man of sin into the newborn child of God and into our true nature as good and divine is called Theosis.\n\nThis is to say that once someone is in the presence of God, deified with him, then they can begin to properly understand, and there \"contemplate\" God. This form of contemplation is to have and pass through an actual experience rather than a rational or reasoned understanding of theory (see Gnosis). Whereas with rational thought one uses logic to understand, one does the opposite with God (see also Apophatic theology).\n\nWithin Western Christianity contemplation is often related to mysticism as expressed in the works of mystical theologians such as Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross as well as the writings of Margery Kempe, Augustine Baker and Thomas Merton. Dom Cuthbert Butler notes that contemplation was the term used in the Latin Church to refer to mysticism, and \"'mysticism' is a quite modern word\".\n\nIn Christianity, contemplation refers to a content-free mind directed towards the awareness of God as a living reality. This corresponds, in some ways, to what in Eastern religion is called samadhi. Meditation, on the other hand, for many centuries in the Western Church, referred to more cognitively active exercises, such as visualizations of Biblical scenes as in the Ignatian exercises or \"lectio divina\" in which the practitioner \"listens to the text of the Bible with the 'ear of the heart', as if he or she is in conversation with God, and God is suggesting the topics for discussion.\" \n\nIn Catholic Christianity, contemplation is given importance. The Catholic Church's \"model theologian\", St. Thomas Aquinas wrote: \"It is requisite for the good of the human community that there should be persons who devote themselves to the life of contemplation.\" One of his disciples, Josef Pieper commented: \"For it is contemplation which preserves in the midst of human society the truth which is at one and the same time useless and the yardstick of every possible use; so it is also contemplation which keeps the true end in sight, gives meaning to every practical act of life.\"\n\nAccording to Aquinas, the highest form of life is the contemplative which communicates the fruits of contemplation to others, since it is based on the abundance of contemplation (\"contemplari et contemplata aliis tradere\") (ST, III, Q. 40, A. 1, Ad 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38813", "title": "Coven", "text": "Coven\n\nA coven usually refers to a group or gathering of witches. The word \"coven\" remained largely unused in English until 1921 when Margaret Murray promoted the idea, now discredited, that all witches across Europe met in groups of thirteen which they called \"covens\".\n\nIn Wicca and other similar forms of modern neopagan witchcraft, such as Stregheria and Feri, a coven is a gathering or community of witches, much like a in Christian parlance. It is composed of a group of believers who gather together for ceremonies of worship such as Drawing Down the Moon, or celebrating the Sabbats.\n\nThe number of persons involved may vary. Although some consider thirteen to be ideal (probably in deference to Murray's theories), any group of at least three can be a coven. A group of two is usually called a \"working couple\" (regardless of the sexes). Within the community, many believe that a coven larger than thirteen is unwieldy, citing unwieldy group dynamics and an unfair burden on the leadership. When a coven has grown too large to be manageable, it may split, or \"hive\". In Wicca, this may also occur when a newly made High Priest or High Priestess, also called 3rd Degree ordination, leaves to start their own coven.\n\nWiccan covens are usually jointly led by a High Priestess and a High Priest, although some are led by only one or the other. In more recent forms of neopagan witchcraft, covens are sometimes run as democracies with a rotating leadership.\n\nWith the rise of the Internet as a platform for collaborative discussion and media dissemination, it became popular for adherents and practitioners of Wicca to establish \"online covens\" which remotely teach tradition-specific crafts to students in a similar method of education as non-religious virtual online schools. One of the first online covens to take this route is the Coven of the Far Flung Net (CFFN), which was established in 1998 as the online arm of the Church of Universal Eclectic Wicca.\n\nHowever, because of potentially-unwieldy membership sizes, many online covens limit their memberships to anywhere between 10 and 100 students. The CFFN, in particular, tried to devolve its structure into a system of sub-coven clans (which governed their own application processes), a system which ended in 2003 due to fears by the CFFN leadership that the clans were becoming communities in their own right.\n\nThe Urban Coven is a group founded on Facebook by Becca Gordon for women in Los Angeles to gather, hike, and howl at the moon. It meets monthly and is estimated to have almost 3,500 members. A January 2016 gathering at Griffith Park drew nearly 1,000 women, and was described as follows: \"Many of the women ... were there in groups — mothers and daughters, friends, colleagues. Some arrived solo and struck up conversations with other women or hiked in solitude.\"\n\nIn popular culture, a coven is a group or gathering of witches who work spells in tandem. Such imagery can be traced back to Renaissance prints depicting witches and to the three \"weird sisters\" in Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\" (1606).\n\nOrgiastic meetings of witches are depicted in the Robert Burns poem \"Tam o' Shanter\" (1791) and in the Goethe play \"Faust\" (1832).\n\nFilms featuring covens include \"Rosemary's Baby\" (1968), \"Suspiria\" (1977) and its 2018 remake, \"The Witches of Eastwick\" (1987), \"Four Rooms\" (1995), \"The Craft\" (1996), \"Coven\" (1997), \"Underworld\" (2003), \"\" (2006), \"The Covenant\" (2006), \"Paranormal Activity 3\" (2011), and \"The Witch\" (2015).\n\nIn television, covens have been portrayed in the U.S. in supernatural dramas such as \"Charmed\", \"Witches of East End\", \"The Vampire Diaries\", \"The Originals\", \"The Secret Circle\", \"True Blood\", and \"Once Upon a Time\". The third season of \"American Horror Story\" is entitled \"\" and focuses on witches.\n\nIn vampire novels such as \"The Vampire Chronicles\" by Anne Rice and the \"Twilight\" series by Stephenie Meyer, covens are families or unrelated groups of vampires who live together.\n\nCovens feature in the video game Dishonored, specifically in the DLC's Knife of Dunwall, and The Brigmore Witches.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6990053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6990053", "title": "Dora Gordine", "text": "Dora Gordine\n\nDora Gordine (8th June 1895 – 29 December 1991) was an Estonian Jewish Modernist figurative and portraitist sculptor. Her early career was influenced by the Noor Eesti (‘Young Estonia’) group of artists who favoured Art Nouveau. She moved to Paris and on her second marriage to Hon.Richard Hare (1907–66), her career expanded to the extent that some critics regarded her as amongst the finest sculptors of her generation.She specialized \nin Portrait sculptures attracting international admirers from the: political, social, artistic, literary and theatrical worlds. Her legacy also includes a number of public space pieces. Her latter career was not as prolific or as fated with praise and Gordine was relatively unknown at the time of her death. Major exhibitions in London in 2006 and 2009 have revived her standing and her former home is now a museum.\nDora Gordine's childhood has not been well documented. There is confusion over her date of birth with various dates 1895 (likely), 1898 and 1906 mentioned. She was the youngest of four children born to Morduch (\"Mark\") Gordin and Emma Ester Schepshelewitch, both Russian Jews, in Liepāja, Latvia, at a time when it was still part of the Russian Empire. Two of her siblings, Nikolai and Anna, died at the hands of the Nazis in Tallinn, Estonia in 1941. Another brother, Leopold, escaped and lived in London until his death. The Gordin family evidently belonged to a comfortable middle class. There was money available to pay Gordine’s elder brother, Leopold, to study engineering at Edinburgh University. Later, it seems that Gordine’s father was also prepared to pay for Gordine’s elder sister, Anna, to study at one of Tallinn’s leading art schools.\n\nBy 1912 the Gordin family had moved to Tallinn, Estonia. It is clear that Gordine’s approach to sculpture was considerably shaped by the example of the pre-First World War Noor Eesti (‘Young Estonia’) a group of artists who championed Art Nouveau in the country. She exhibited bronze sculptures in Tallinn in 1917, 1920 and 1921. In the autumn of 1924 she came to Paris to study a course in French civilisation, improving her knowledge of contemporary French sculptural practice. Then, surrounded by galleries and salons, she \"instinctively felt a correlation between the rhythms of music and sculpture\" and developed her sculptural vision. Gordin gallicised her surname by adding an “e\" perhaps in an effort to make it sound more Russian and always denied or deflected suggestions that she was Jewish.\n\nIn 1925 she worked as a painter on a mural for the British Pavilion at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes, in Paris. It provided the means to cast a bronze for exhibition at the Beaux Arts Society. The following year she was invited to exhibit at the Salon des Tuileries where her design of the head & torso of a Chinese philosopher earned enthusiastic reviews; The Straits Times (1932) wrote: \"Like Byron, one morning Dora Gordine woke up famous\". Between 1929 and 1935 she sculpted bronzes for the City Hall, Singapore. Leicester Galleries in London presented Gordine's sculpture in a solo show in 1928. It was a huge success and all her work was sold, amongst which Javanese Head was bought by Samuel Courtauld for the Tate Gallery collection.\n\nIn 1930 she married her first husband, Englishman Dr George Herbert Garlick in Singapore. In 1936 she married her second husband, the Hon. Richard Gilbert Hare (5 September 1907 – 1966), son of Richard Granville Hare, 4th Earl of Listowel and Freda Vanden-Bempde-Johnstone on 21 November 1936. Through her marriage she became part of a liberal aristocratic cultural elite, a member of the top ten percent in Britain when three quarters of the nation belonged to the working class. The independent income from Hare allowed Dora to build Dorich House in Kingston Vale, her studio and a showcase for her work. As well as, a showcase for their collections of Indian, Chinese and nineteenth century Russian art and furniture.\n\nHer husband introduced her to London society figures, many of whom sat for her, Dame Edith Evans, Dame Beryl Grey, Dorothy Tutin, Siân Phillips, Emlyn Williams, Sir Kenneth Clark, John Pope-Hennessy and Professor F. Brown, Head of the Slade School of Art. There were also overseas commissions including the Philosopher Kuu Nim, whose head sculpture Gordine called 'the Chinese Lady of Peace' and a low-relief at Gray's Inn to Sun Yat-Sen, the former leader of China.\n\nEach portrait head had its own patina according to Gordine's vision of her sitter. When interviewed by the BBC in 1972 Gordine commented that, \"when you do portrait busts of somebody you do their noses and mouth – but it is nothing. You have to imagine what they are like inside and bring out their inner feeling and then put it in a form\".\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II, Gordine’s career was brought to a halt. She no longer had access to Valsuani’s in Paris, her favourite foundry, and bronze quickly became rationed. All foundries in Britain were ordered stop all non-essential activity and concentrate on war production. It was not until late 1943 or early 1944 that she found a new foundry and was able to have some of her latest bronze work exhibited in the Royal Academy in 1944. During the 1940s/50s Gordine's work was exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy, the Society of Portrait Sculptors and elsewhere. In October 1945 she had a solo exhibition at the Leicester Galleries, in which The Times described her as having ‘much ability, though she is eclectic in her inspiration, being influenced by works from many schools and periods - Indian and Egyptian among others. Her best works are her portrait heads in bronze which are convincing and straightforward.’ Bronzes from this time have ironic or humorous titles, relating to the pose, such as 'Great Expectations' or 'Mischief' and, of an RAF Officer, 'Above Cloud'. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal British Society of Sculptors in 1949. She occasionally did exotic or erotic pieces (e.g. for Elizabeth Choy). She travelled and lectured in America, working in Hollywood, art lecturing and designing film sets in 1947 and revisited the USA in 1959.\n\nIn 1948 she was commissioned to produce a sculpture to stand in the new mother and baby unit at Holloway Prison in north London. 'Happy Baby' was largely forgotten by 2009 languishing in an administration block at the prison for many years. Now regarded as an important piece in 'La Gordine's' professional history it formed the centre piece of an exhibition of her work at Kingston University in February–March 2009.\n\nIn 1960 Esso commissioned a 7' x 5' low-relief 'Power' for their new Milford Haven Refinery, which was unveiled by the Duke of Edinburgh. Gordine's last public commission, the 8' long 'Mother and Child' was made for the entrance hall of the Royal Marsden Hospital, Surrey, in 1963.\n\nHer husband's sudden death in 1966 from a heart attack left Gordine to live out her life alone in Dorich House. She had no children. As Gordine’s client base became smaller and health problems undermined her ability to work to the standard she had during the 1920s, her eyesight deteriorated and she had arthritis in her shoulders and arms causing her career to end in the 1970s. She had a great interest in her garden and, in particular, herbs and plants used for medicinal purposes, such as Tansy. Adrian Howes and Robert Ruthven were her part-time gardeners for nearly two years in the mid-seventies. She often invited the members of the Royal Ballet School to Dorich house to pose for her. She died in Dorich House in December 1991, aged around 96.\n\nIn subsequent years her work was to be revived by major exhibitions in London in 2006 at the Ben Uri Gallery in the London Jewish Museum of Art, and in 2009 at Dorich House and Kingston University.\n\nDorich House was designed by Gordine and completed in 1936. The name chosen for the house was a portmanteau of Dora and Richard's names. The house is spread across three floors; the ground and first floors devoted to the production and display of Gordine's work, with the upper floor forming the couple's private apartment. In 1994, it was acquired by Kingston University and was refurbished and formally opened as a museum in 1996, housing Gordine's collection of bronze and plaster sculptures and many of her paintings and drawings. There are also items from Hare's Imperial Russian art collection, which includes icons, paintings, ceramics, glassware, metalwork, folk art and furniture dating from the early 18th century to the early 20th century.\n\n\n"}

Trichocereus bridgesii), the Bolivian torch cactus, is a fast-growing columnar cactus from the high deserts of Bolivia. \nAmong the indigenous populations of Bolivia, it is sometimes called \"achuma\" or \"wachuma\", although these names are also applied to related species such as \"Echinopsis pachanoi\" which are also used for their psychedelic effects.\n\nThe plant has a light green to bluish color and usually has four to eight ribs. It can grow 2–5 m tall with stems of up to 15–20 cm in diameter. Spines can range in coloration from honey-coloured to brown, and are located on the nodes in groups of up to four. These spines can grow up to 6–7 cm in length and in fully grown plants are spaced evenly on the ribs, 2.5 to 3 cm apart.\nSeveral varieties of this species are highly prized by ornamental cactus collectors. These include a cristate variety, two variants of monstrose growth, and a more recently developed clone that exhibits both monstrose and cristate growth. These all tend to be much slower growing than the standard form of the species, but owing to their highly unusual shapes, they are sought after by cactus collectors.\n\nThe monstrose form of \"Echinopsis lageniformis\" is known as the penis plant or penis cactus. Contrary to the typical columnar habit of the species, this cultivar displays short stem sections that branch avidly, forming a low spiny bush. The upper part of each stem segment is smooth and spineless, resembling a penis. The lower part is spiny and shows a tendency to form ribs. The plant is light green. The German name for this cultivar, \"frauenglück,\" more euphemistic than its English equivalent, translates as \"women's joy.\"\n\nThe plant contains a number of psychoactive alkaloids, in particular the well-studied chemical mescaline typically at levels several times lower than \"Echinopsis pachanoi\": it was reported 0.56% dry weight mescaline content for \"E. lageniformis\", while up to 5% for \"E. pachanoi.\" The concentrations for specimens from various locations vary considerably and \"E. lageniformis\" may sometimes contain higher mescaline content than \"E. pachanoi\" although that 0.56% concentration was the highest reported in any research. Chemical analysis of some variants of this species have shown it may include some of the most potent of the psychedelic \"Trichocereus\" species, although this is not conclusive nor does it apply to all strains of the species. Outside of its native habitat, it is one of the least known and used of the \"Trichocereus\" cacti for either its psychoactive or ornamental uses. This is not true in areas where it is the dominant species, for example, the La Paz area of Bolivia.\n\nAs with related species, it seems to have long shamanic tradition of use throughout its native habitat.\n\n\n"}

Later, some of the community were awarded zamindaris by the Mughal emperor Jahangir, an example of which was the family settled in Azamgarh that took the title of \"Raja\" from around 1609. By the time of Aurangzeb's reign, the Gautams had gained enough strength to field armed contingents including artillery, horse cavalry and elephants and made incursions against the neighboring zamindars of Gorakhpur. One late 17th-century Gautam chief from the Azamgarh area, named Bikramajit Singh, converted to Islam after Aurangzeb threatened that he would otherwise be executed. His sons and descendants went on to found communities, establish markets and construct improvements such as a canal connecting the Tons River with the Kol.\n\nIn the case of one Gautam Rajput family, from Nagar, the decision by the British East India Company to dispossess them in favour of another landholder was the cause of them joining in the Indian rebellion of 1857. Prior to that rebellion, some Gautam communities, in common with other groups that once held high status and power, were practitioners of female infanticide. This was in part a result of British policies that led to declining socio-economic fortunes and thus a reduction in their ability to construct favourable marriage alliances.\n\nToday, some Gautam Rajputs, who also refer to themselves as \"Gautam Thakurs\", are Muslim and others are Hindus. However, their social and religious customs blur the lines that might usually be expected to exist between different religious communities in India. Indeed, their common identity as Rajputs often over-rides their differences in religion and they can be found participating in each other's customs and rituals.\n"}

According to the 2010 census conducted by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), there were 3,762 individuals that identified Islam as their religion. The majority are Sunnis and a minority are Shiites or Ahmadiyyas.\n\nToday, most Mexican Islamic organizations focus on grassroots missionary activities which are most effective at the community level.\n\nThe \"Centro Cultural Islámico de México\" (CCIM), a Sunni organization headed by Omar Weston, a British born Mexican convert to Islam, has been active in several big cities in northern and central Mexico. In the state of Morelos, the CCIM built a prayer hall and centre for recreation, learning and conferences, called Dar as Salaam, which also operates Hotel Oasis, a hotel that offers halal holidays for Muslim travellers and accommodation for non-Muslims sympathetic to Islam. This group was the subject of a study carried out by British anthropologist Mark Lindley-Highfield of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Aberdeen. Apart from CCIM there is a branch of the Nur Ashki Jerrahi Sufi Order in Mexico City which is often at odds with the traditionalist Muslim community and is headed by two women, Shaykha Fatima Fariha and Shaykha Amina Teslima. There is also a small Salafi organization (the Centro Salafi de México) led by Muhammad Abdullah Ruiz (a former deputy to Weston) and an educational centre managed mainly by Muslims from Egypt and the Middle East, el \"Centro Educativo de la Comunidad Musulmana en México\" (run by Said Louahabi),and centro al hikmah run by Isa Rojas a Mexican convert to Islam, who studied Islamic studies in the University of Medina), within the capital city.\n\nIslam is reportedly growing from a rise in conversions.\n\nThe Spanish Murabitun community, the \"Comunidad Islámica en España\", based in Granada in Spain, and one of its missionaries, Muhammad Nafia (formerly Aureliano Pérez), now emir of the Comunidad Islámica en México, arrived in the state of Chiapas shortly after the Zapatista uprising and established a commune in the city of San Cristóbal. The group, characterized as anti-capitalistic, entered an ideological pact with the socialist Zapatistas group. President Vicente Fox voiced concerns about the influence of the fundamentalism and possible connections to the Zapatistas and the Basque terrorist organization Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA), but it appeared that converts had no interest in political extremism. By 2015, many indigenous Mayans and more than 700 Tzotzils have converted to Islam. In San Cristóbal, the Murabitun established a pizzeria, a carpentry workshop and a Quranic school (madrasa) where children learned Arabic and prayed five times a day in the backroom of a residential building, and women in head scarves have become a common sight. Nowadays, most of the Mayan Muslims have left the Murabitun and established ties with the CCIM, now following the orthodox Sunni school of Islam. They built the Al-Kausar Mosque in San Cristobal de las Casas.\n\nThis is a list of some but by no means all mosques and Islamic meeting centers in Mexico.\n\n\nThe first Christian churches built during the Mexican colonial period, express forms of influence by Mudejar architecture, which is a post-Moorish, Christian Iberian architecture and decoration style that was strongly influenced by Iberian Moorish achitecture and artworks in the High Middle Ages.\n\nIn Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, a fountain, known locally as \"La Corona\" or \" La Pila \" was built to provide the population with water. This architectural work was built in annealed brick with a strong Mudejar influence. It was built by the Spanish Dominican friars during the Colonial era in the sixteenth century.\n\nThe Morisco Kiosk (Moorish Kiosk) in Colonia Santa María la Ribera was made by Mr. José Ramón Ibarrola for the Universal Exhibition of New Orleans from 1884-1885, in the neo-Mudejar style that was prevailing in Spain in the 19th century.\n\n\n"}

The Kumano Kodō and Kumano Sanzan, along with Koyasan and Yoshino and Omine, were registered as World Heritage sites on July 7, 2004 as the \"Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range.\"\n\nThe \"Kiji\" route runs along the west coast of the peninsula to the city of Tanabe where it forks into two: Nakahechi and Ohechi. The Nakahechi route leads into the rugged interior mountains toward Kumano Hongū Taisha and the Ohechi continues south along the coast. The Nakahechi route was the most popular for pilgrimages from Kyoto, the ancient capital of Japan. The earliest records of this route dates from the early 10th century. The trail has a long history of use by people with diverse belief backgrounds leading to mixed religious symbolism overlaid and incorporated into the setting and stages of the pilgrimage itself. \n\nThe UNESCO World Heritage registered section begins at Takijiri-oji which is considered to be the point of entry to the sacred area of Kumano. From here it is about 40 km of mountainous trail before one reaches the mystical Kumano Hongū Taisha. Most pilgrimages break the journey into a two-day walk. The Chikatsuyu-oji is about halfway and most pilgrims stay the night here at a minshuku.\n\nIn Hongū, pilgrims often did purification rites in Yunomine Onsen (Yunomine hot spring). Tsuboyu is a small cabin on the creek that runs through this isolated village, featuring a small rocky bath that is the only World Heritage hot spring open to visitors. The bath was used for purification rites and its legendary healing effects.\n\nThe Kumano Kodō Dainichi-goe route links Kumano Hongū Taisha with Yunomine. It is 2 km long and is a steep climb, and descends over a small pass.\n\nFrom Kumano Hongū Taisha most pilgrims went by boat on the Kumano River to Kumano Hayatama Taisha in the coastal town of Shingū. This 40 km section of the Kumano Kodō is the only river pilgrimage route that is registered as a World Heritage site. There is an overland route that links Kumano Hongū Taisha with Kumano Nachi Taisha. Most pilgrims take two days to complete this walk staying in the small town of Koguchi. The section between Hongū and Koguchi is called the Kogumotori-goe and the section between Koguchi and Kumano Nachi Taisha is called Ogumotori-goe.\n\nThe \"Kohechi\" route links Koyasan to the Kumano Sanzan. It runs north to south and is 70 km long. It is the shortest route connecting Koyasan to Kumano but is a tough walk that traverses three passes of over 1,000 meters.\n\nThe \"Iseji\" route links Ise Grand Shrine with the Kumano Sanzan. It was not until the 17th century that this route became part of the Saikogu pilgrimage, the first temple being Seiganto-ji, which is closely related with the Kumano Nachi Taisha.\n\nThe \"Magose Toge\" forms the boundary between Miyama, Kyoto and Owase, Mie. A moss-covered stone path stretches about 2 km into the beautiful cypress forest covered with ferns. This route leads to Tengura-san with a huge stone at the tip.

However, there are exceptions. In early seventeenth-century China, Jesuit missionaries secured permission from Pope Paul V to celebrate the Catholic Mass in Chinese, part of an effort to adapt their work to Chinese cultural norms and conditions. In Dalmatia and parts of Istria, the liturgy was celebrated in Church Slavonic, and authorization for use of this language was extended to some other Slavic regions between 1886 and 1935. There, \"Tridentine Mass\" was not synonymous with \"Latin Mass\". \n\nA further distancing between the concepts of \"Tridentine Mass\" and \"Latin Mass\" was brought about by the 1964 Instruction on implementing the Constitution on Sacred Liturgy of the Second Vatican Council, which laid down that \"normally the epistle and gospel from the Mass of the day shall be read in the vernacular\". Episcopal conferences were to decide, with the consent of the Holy See, what other parts, if any, of the Mass were to be celebrated in the vernacular. Permissions were thus granted from 1967 onwards to celebrate most of the Tridentine Mass in vernacular languages, including the Canon.\n\nNeither the Second Vatican Council nor the subsequent revision of the Roman Missal abolished Latin as the liturgical language of the Roman Rite: the official text of the Roman Missal, on which translations into vernacular languages are to be based, continues to be in Latin, and Latin can still be used in the celebration. The term \"Latin Mass\" is sometimes applied to such celebrations, which in some places are part of the normal Sunday schedule.\n\nHistorically speaking, \"Latin Mass\" can be applied also to the various forms of Pre-Tridentine Mass from about the year 190 of Pope Victor, when the Church in Rome changed from Greek to Latin.\n\nLatin liturgical rites other than the Roman Rite have used Latin, and in some cases continue to do so. These include the Ambrosian Rite and the Mozarabic Rite. Some priests and communities continue to use non-Roman-Rite liturgies that have been generally abandoned, such as the Carmelite Rite and the Dominican Rite, celebrating them in Latin. Celebration in Latin of such rites is sometimes referred to as \"Latin Mass\".\n\nA Traditionalist Catholic periodical in the United States is entitled \"The Latin Mass, the Journal of Catholic Culture and Tradition\".\n\nVarious editions of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer have been translated into Latin: for example, for use in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge (\"Liber Precum Publicarum\" of Walther Haddon, 1560). The Church of the Advent of Christ the King, an Anglo-Catholic parish in San Francisco, regularly celebrates Mass according to the 1979 Prayer Book of its province, the Episcopal Church, in Latin.\n"}
{"id": "1526333", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1526333", "title": "Leviticus 18", "text": "Leviticus 18\n\nLeviticus 18 is the eighteenth chapter of the Book of Leviticus in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. It narrates part of the instructions which, according to the Bible, were given to Moses by God on biblical Mount Sinai. The chapter deals with a number of sexual activities considered unclean or abominable. Although the chapter is principally concerned with incest, it also contains laws related to bestiality and \"lying with a man as with a woman.\" This single reference in verse 22 has, in recent years, been a focus of debate among Christians and Jews regarding homosexual activity (see Homosexuality and Christianity and Jewish views of homosexuality).\n\nLeviticus 18 is generally regarded as part of the Holiness Code of Leviticus 11–26, and its sexual prohibitions are largely paralleled by Leviticus 20 (except that chapter has more emphasis on punishment).\n\nThe original text of Leviticus 18, like that of most of the Hebrew Bible, was written in Hebrew. The oldest extant versions of the text in Hebrew are found in the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Pentateuch, and the Masoretic Text. An ancient Greek translation from the third century BCE, the Septuagint, also exists. Since the addition of chapter divisions in the thirteenth century CE, this chapter is divided into 30 verses.\n\nThe chapter begins with God speaking to Moses (verse 1) and giving him a message for the Israelites (2), warning them to keep God's laws rather than Canaanite or Egyptian practices (3–5). Then follows a list of people with whom sex is forbidden to do family relationships (6–19). Verse 20 prohibits sexual relations with a neighbor's wife, and 21 prohibits passing one's children through a fire to Moloch. 22 is the famous verse about \"lying with a man,\" discussed below, while 23 forbids bestiality. The final verses (24–30) warn that breaking these laws will produce defilement, and that the Canaanites are about to be displaced from the land of Canaan as a result of following these practices, and warn of a similar fate for the Israelites if they fall into these practices.\n\nThe Bible lists several types of relationship which it regards as incestuous unions; one list appears in the Deuteronomic Code, and two lists occur in the Holiness Code of Leviticus. These lists only mention relationships with female relatives; excluding lesbianism, which implies that the list is addressed to men. These lists then compare as follows: \n\n(blue = forbidden for men only, pink = forbidden for women only, purple = forbidden for both men and women):\n\nOne feature of all the lists is that sexual activity between a man and his own daughter is not explicitly forbidden. The Talmud argues that this is because the prohibition was \"obvious\", especially given the proscription against a relationship with a granddaughter. The shortness of the list in Leviticus 20, and especially of that in Deuteronomy, are explained by classical Jewish scholarship as being due to the \"obviousness\" of the missing prohibitions. Note also that the explicit prohibition against engaging in sexual activity with \"both a woman and her daughter\", implicitly forbids sexual activity between a man and his daughter. Some biblical scholars have instead proposed that it was originally in the list, but was then accidentally left out from the copy on which modern versions of the text ultimately depend, due to a mistake by the scribe.\n\nApart from the questionable case of a man marrying his daughter, the list in Leviticus 18 roughly produces the same rules as were followed in early pre-Islamic Arabic culture. However, most tribal nations also disliked exogamous marriage—marriage to completely unrelated people. In several prominent cases in the Torah, the incest rules are ignored in favour of marriage to a close relative; Jacob is described as having married his first wife's sister, and Abraham as having a father in common with Sarah (rather than a mother, which would have been permitted by the list). These are not seen as illegal marriages as the incest laws were not given until Moses.\n\nThe text of 18:22:\nThe Hebrew wording of Leviticus 18:22 has been generally interpreted as prohibiting some or all homosexual acts, although which precise acts, and in which situations, is a matter of ongoing scholarly debate.\n\nSome authors state that verse 22 condemns \"homosexuality\" or \"homosexual relations\" and other authors maintaining that it condemns only males penetrating males (anal intercourse). The Talmud maintains the law prohibits all male homosexual activity including pederasty. Since the practice is allotted the death penalty for both the active and the passive partners in Leviticus 20 the law appears to have only applied when both participants were men above the age of majority, which is set at 20 years old in the Torah.\n\nLesbianism is not explicitly prohibited in the Torah; however, the rabbi and Jewish scholar Maimonides ruled in the twelfth century that lesbianism was prohibited nonetheless and deserving of punishment by beating.\n\n\n\n"}

The Church, based in Sweden, has been officially recognized by the Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency as a religious community in January 2012, after three application attempts.\n\nGerson has denied any connection between the Church and filesharing site The Pirate Bay, but both groups are associated with the Swedish art and hacking collective Piratbyrån.\n\nThe name Kopimism derives from the words \"copy\" and \"me\" which are the fundamental roots of the Church's beliefs and calls for an invitation to copy information. The work \"Kopimi\" first showed up on a pirate Agency Forum. Isak Gerson, one of the core founders saw something beautiful and theological in this concept of \"copy me\" and argued that the digital sharing of data is a fundamental act in our universe through the reproduction and copying of cells, DNA, and genes and that the entirety of the internet is essentially for sharing.\n\nGerson has been credited with once saying, \"The only thing we can do as Christians now, I suppose, is to do what Jesus tried doing – and do it better.\"\n\nThe followers of the religion are called \"Kopimists\" from \"copy me\".\nA \"Kopimist\" or \"Kopimist intellectual\" is a person who has the philosophical belief that all information should be freely distributed and unrestricted. This philosophy opposes the monopolization of knowledge in all its forms, such as copyright, and encourages file sharing of all types of media including music, movies, TV shows, and software. In fact, the act of withholding and economizing information through copyright is against the sacredness of information. In its spiritual emphasis on copying as an ideal, Kopimism shares values with Chinese aesthetic traditions, in which \"copying is valued not only as a learning tool (as it is in the West) but as artistically satisfying in its own right,\" a concept also called \"duplitecture\".\n\nAccording to the church, \"In our belief, communication is sacred.\" No belief in gods or supernatural phenomena apart from Kopimi itself is mentioned on their web site. \"CTRL+C\" and \"CTRL+V\", the common computer shortcut keys for \"Copy\" and \"Paste,\" are considered sacred symbols. Some groups believe that Kopimi is considered to be a god, and others believing it to be a sacred symbol and spirit residing within every living being.\n\nThe community also holds a religious service known as \"kopyacting\" in which information is distributed to the believers using photocopiers.\n\nAccording to the Kopimist constitution:\n\nOn January 5, 2012, Kopimism was accepted by Sweden as a legitimate religion with an estimated 4,000 members. The religion's association with illegal file sharing has been said not to be a sign that illegal file-sharing will be excused from Sweden's zero-tolerance approach to the controversial matter.\n\nKopimism has also taken root in multiple nations, including:\n\nOn April 28, 2012, the Missionary Church of Kopimism held their first wedding. The wedding took place in Belgrade, Serbia, between a Romanian woman and an Italian man. The holy ceremony was conducted by a Kopimistic Op, wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, while a computer read vows and some of Kopimism's central beliefs aloud.\n\nThe church declared: \"We are very happy today. Love is all about sharing. A married couple shares everything with each other. Hopefully, they will copy and remix some DNA-cells and create a new human being. That is the spirit of Kopimism. Feel the love and share that information. Copy all of its holiness.\"\n\nGerson, the missionary leader of the Church of Kopimism, attended as a witness during the wedding.\n\nBoth founders, Gerson and Nipe have had an extensive background in online activism and served as major players in the Swedish Anti-Piracy Movement which caused many journalists and government officials in Sweden to speculate on the real goals of the creation of this organization.\n\nThere was severe backlash amongst the media and Christian journals in 2011 after the founders first submitted their application for registering as a religion as journalists condemned the Missionary Church of Kopimism as \"a political adventure\", \"a PR stunt\", and \"a devaluation of religion\".\n\n"}

He is the second character to take up the Mister Terrific mantle.\n\nEcho Kellum currently portrays a version of the character named Curtis Holt / Mister Terrific in the shared DC Arrowverse show \"Arrow.\"\n\nMichael Holt was created by John Ostrander and Tom Mandrake and first appeared in \"Spectre\" (vol. 3) #54 (June 1997).\n\nAt a very young age, Michael Holt shows remarkable intelligence, reading and assimilating the works of Aage Bohr, Albert Einstein, Max Planck and Richard Feynman, the pantheon of theoretical physics. Michael grows up with his mentally challenged older brother, Jeffrey, whom he loves dearly. When Jeffrey dies at the age of 15, Michael is devastated.\n\nHolt displays \"a natural aptitude for having natural aptitudes\", as he calls it, easily picking up and retaining complex skills and abilities that others spend their entire lives perfecting. Before he begins his career as a superhero, he already possesses 14 Ph.Ds (two in engineering and physics—including doctorates and master's degrees in law, psychology, chemistry, political science, and mathematics)—is a self-made multi-millionaire with a high tech firm called Cyberwear (subsequently sold to Waynetech), and is a gold medal-winning Olympic decathlete.\n\nThe accidental deaths of his wife and unborn child are a devastating blow to Holt. He considers himself responsible for the accident as he made his wife late for church by arguing with her about the value of religion. While contemplating suicide, he is met by the Spectre, who tells him about Terry Sloane, the Golden Age superhero known as Mister Terrific. Inspired by Sloane's life story, he takes the name Mister Terrific and later joins the current Justice Society of America (JSA), eventually serving as its chairman.\n\nInitially, he wears ordinary clothes and a leather jacket with Sloane's \"Fair Play\" emblem on the back. Later, he switches to a T-shaped mask composed of electronic nanites, a black and white costume with red trim, and a collarless jacket in the same colors (the black sections of tunic and jacket forming a \"T\") with \"Fair Play\" written on the sleeves and \"Terrific\" across the back.\n\nFor a time, he acts as spokesperson for Tylerco and consults for the company on industrial espionage and security matters in exchange for it helping fund a youth center Terrific has started.\n\nHolt has a friendly rivalry with Batman, his opposite number in the Justice League of America (in his identity as Bruce Wayne, Batman owns Holt's business). Holt has encountered Sloane twice through time travel, with Sloane expressing pride in having so worthy a successor. Holt has been noted as the most intelligent member of the JSA in its history, surpassing his predecessor. He is also known as the third-smartest person in the world, and this notion now appears to be widespread within the DC Universe.\n\nDuring a conflict over leadership of the Justice Society between former chairman Hawkman and then-current chairman Sand, Terrific is elected as the JSA's new chairman by his teammates, despite not actively seeking the office. He serves in this capacity until the team disbands following the Infinite Crisis.\n\nMr. Terrific currently remains a member of the reformed Justice Society of America. He resumed his chairmanship from the last incarnation of the team, but his leadership responsibilities in Checkmate eventually prompt him to relinquish the position to Power Girl.\n\nMr. Terrific is part of the team assembled by Batman for an attack on the Brother Eye satellite responsible for controlling the OMACs. He plays a critical role as his invisibility to technology allows him to reach the satellite's propulsion system, sending it crashing to Earth. During this time, he meets and befriends another African American superhero—Black Lightning.\n\nIn the \"One Year Later\" storyline, Holt is still a member of the JSA, and he has also become part of the United Nations Security Council's intelligence agency, Checkmate. He holds the position of White King's Bishop initially, but when the previous White King (Alan Scott) is forced to resign, he becomes Checkmate's new White King, complicating his relationship with Sasha Bordeaux, Checkmate's Black Queen. He has also given up his chairman position, which has been taken over by Power Girl. Mr. Terrific has also established an ill-defined mentorship with Firestorm over the missing year; the specifics of their meeting are yet to be documented.\n\nHolt is forced to face his issues with faith once again when the JSA confront Gog, a God of the Second World. Not only is Gog incapable of hearing Terrific due to his lack of faith, but during a trip to the Earth-Two of the new multiverse, Holt encounters his Earth-Two counterpart, who is now a devout believer after having a religious experience on the day his wife survived her accident.\n\nDuring the \"Final Crisis of Humanity\", the war between Darkseid and the human world, Mister Terrific, along with Cheetah and Snapper Carr, are left trapped in the ruins of Checkmate headquarters, unable to get past the brainwashed metahuman, and caring for Sasha, who prefers using her OMAC programming to shut down her bodily functions rather than falling prey to the Anti-Life Equation. Forcefully waking up Sasha, thus condemning her, Michael Holt has no choice but to activate a new OMAC population, programmed to obey him rather than Brother Eye, and to protect the last few humans against the new Justifiers.\n\nIn \"Justice Society of America\" vol. 3 series, Mr. Terrific takes over the research, just as the low-level villain Tapeworm appears on the news, taking hostages and demanding that Wildcat show himself. All-American Kid and King Chimera must remain in the brownstone, Mister Terrific retreats to his lab, and the rest of the team leaves to help Wildcat. All-American Kid goes into the lab and stabs Mister Terrific in the back, pretending to have been mind controlled. Justice Society members arrive back at headquarters to discover Mr. Terrific has been attacked, and Dr. Mid-Nite tends to his wounds. In the end, Mister Terrific succumbs to his injuries and Alan Scott reports that he has died. However, Scott is able to use the power of the Green Flame to slow down time around Mister Terrific's body in the hopes that he can be healed before brain death occurs. Michael is restored to life by the magic of the new Doctor Fate, and attacks All-American Kid, revealing that he is actually the teenage psychopath known as Kid Karnevil, and subdues him. For a short time during his recovery, Michael is forced to use a wheelchair, although he still finds time to upgrade Mister America's whip.\n\nOn September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Mister Terrific received a self-titled ongoing series written by Eric Wallace and drawn by Roger Robinson. Holt begins sporting a new costume designed by Cully Hamner. He is also in a relationship with Karen Starr.\n\nOn January 12, 2012, DC announced that it would be ending six of the lowest selling New 52 titles in April, replacing them with six different titles in the revamp's second wave. \"Mister Terrific\" was cancelled with issue #8 in April 2012. The series ends with Mister Terrific being displaced to a parallel universe where he continues to appear in the \"Earth-2\" series.\n\nIn \"Dark Days: The Forge\", Mister Terrific returns to Earth Prime as Batman unveils a containment unit in The Lunar Batcave bearing the Plastic Man logo, and suggests it is time to release him.\n\nMister Terrific stumbles upon Simon Stagg's plot to open a portal to the Dark Multiverse with Metamorpho transmutated to Nth Metal. While trying to get Simon Stagg to close the portal with the help of Plastic Man, Mister Terrific is sucked in to the portal with Plastic Man and Metamorpho as Plastic Man shields them from the Dark Multiverse energy. Upon arriving on a lifeless world, they encounter Phantom Girl who has been trapped in her intangible form and had no knowledge of sending a signal. When the four of them find a computer in the gut of a dead giant creature, they are greeted by a hologram of Tom Strong who states that they are needed to save the universe. Mister Terrific, Plastic Man, and Metamorpho learn from Phantom Girl that she was stuck in intangible form since she was a child. After the four of them made it back to their world, Mister Terrific tries to leave the three of them at Simon Stagg's compound only to be drawn back to them. Due to the effects of the Dark Multiverse energy, Mister Terrific concludes that they can't go their separate ways due to this bond. Though Mister Terrific was able to come up with a compromise with Simon Stagg by investigating the bond at his facility. This leads to Mister Terrific to find the Tom Strong that sent left the message and find out how to get untethered by the dark energy.\n\nWhile being held captive by Onimar Synn on an adventure with the Justice Society on Thanagar, Holt first expresses his disbelief in souls and that he is uncomfortable with the notion of reincarnation after witnessing the return of teammate Hawkman. Holt states, \"when my wife, Paula, was killed in a car accident ... she was gone. I didn't feel her 'soul' around me. Didn't feel anything\". He later elaborates on this by explaining that his lack of faith extends back prior to his wife's death, and states that he blames himself for her death as he delayed her going to church because the two of them argued about the merits of faith. Holt believes that she would have avoided the accident if she had not been arguing with him. He acknowledges the irony of this given such factors as the Spectre's role in his origin, and his encounter with the likes of the Spirit King, but he still maintains his skepticism about faith and religion.\n\nAfter a near-death experience where he sees his wife and unborn child (whom he decides to name 'Terry' after the original Mister Terrific), Holt's atheism is shaken and he agrees to attend a church service with teammate Doctor Mid-Nite.\n\nHowever, this attempt to find religion apparently is not satisfying as Holt is also seen getting into a theological discussion with Ragman during the \"Infinite Crisis\" (Ragman is Jewish while Mr. Terrific describes himself as an atheist). When asked if he has faith in anything, Terrific answered, \"Sure I do. I've got faith in my team.\"\n\nDuring \"Thy Kingdom Come\", when Power Girl is sent back to the Earth-2 pre-Crisis universe, she meets her world's Michael Holt, who is ironically a priest after he has a religious experience. During the same storyline, 'our' Holt told Doctor Mid-Nite that he feels that his issues with faith actually stem from his own inability to understand it, confessing that he \"wants\" to believe but something inside him will not let him.\n\n\nIn 2008, an alternate version of Michael Holt from a new Earth-2 appeared in DC stories. This version is a college professor, who has a religious experience after his wife is nearly killed in an accident. This version of Paula Holt is merely left in a coma rather than dying immediately. While contemplating suicide after spending three months trying unsuccessfully to find a cure, he saves another man who is preparing to jump off the same bridge, takes him to a church that was the nearest illuminated building, and the man he saves prays for him. After his wife regains consciousness the following day, this Michael Holt went on to become a devout Christian. He helps the Power Girl of New Earth to return home. When the Justice Society arrives on Earth-2, Professor Holt confronts his counterpart Michael Holt from New-Earth. Professor Holt introduces the Justice Society to his wife, Paula, although New-Earth Michael just introduces himself as Mister Terrific rather than reveal his true name.\n\nIn the alternate timeline of the \"Flashpoint\" event, Mister and Missus Terrific are framed for unknown crimes when they discover Outsider's illicit schemes, and are attempting to assassinate him. Mister and Missus Terrific are both killed by Outsider's guardian statue.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Holt is featured in the \"Smallville Season 11\" digital comic based on the TV series.\n\n\n"}

It has a large presence in Guangxi. While it has a supreme god, the creator Bu Luotuo (布洛陀), numerous other deities are venerated as well. It has a three-element-theory (sky, earth and water). Mo is animistic, teaching that spirits are present in everything.\n\nMo developed from prehistoric beliefs of the Zhuang people; it also has similarities to Chinese folk religion, and has developed similar doctrines to Buddhism and Taoism, in the process of competition with the influence of these religions on Zhuang culture. The Cultural Revolution of China weakened Mo, though the religion has undergone a revival since the 1980s. Moism varies from region to region.\n\nMo has a three-element theory (sky, earth and water). The religion is animistic, teaching that spirits are present in everything. The spirits are seen as immortal and subject to changes in mood.\nMo exhibits totemism and the cult of reproduction.\n\nIn Mo, Bu Luotuo is considered the supreme god, creator and the founder of the religion.\n\nThe Flower Mother, Me Hoa, is seen as the creator of humanity and Bu Luotuo's wife. As the goddess of reproduction, she is seen as governing a large garden of golden flowers (boys) and silver flowers (girls). Whoever behaves with good sense and sentiment will receive good flowers (i.e. good children), while those who behave with bad sense receive bad flowers. Families have altars for her.\n\nOther gods include Tudigong, who is thought to protect the village; She Shen, who is the village tutelary spirit; the Shan Shen (\"god of the mountains\"); and the Dragon King. \nRice is seen as important; there is therefore a field god and a rice god.\n\nIn Mo, spirits are thought to be present in everything, and even inanimate things such as water are considered to have souls. \nMo spirits include deities and ancestors as well as devils.\n\nPeople are considered to have three souls after death: One goes to the sky, one to the cemetery and one comes back to the deceased’s family. Souls of the dead enter a netherworld but can continue to assist the living. According to the religion, people who have died by violence can become evil spirits.\n\nPraying is common within this religion. \nSorcerers venerate their masters as well as the founders of witchcraft in their family. \nThere are temples dedicated to land gods. The sun god is celebrated and given offerings.\n\nMo has the sacred epic \"Buluotuo\", concerning the creation of the universe and life as well as how to live a religiously meritorious life. Its transmission was originally oral.\n\nAccording to Mo, every person is a flower in the garden of Molujia, the goddess of birth. On February 29 of the peasants' almanac, the goddess's birthday, women pick flowers and pray to her for pregnancy. She is said to have been born in a flower at the beginning of the world. There is a festival for her, which varies in place, date and ceremonial procedure.\n\nThe religion has the custom of burying the dead twice. People who have died by violence are cremated to prevent the release of potential malevolent spirits.\n\nMediums, shamans or sorcerers are employed at funerals, to treat disease, and to ward off evil.\n\nMo has female shamans, who attempt to treat sickness and communicate with ancestors while in trances. They mostly are recognized as shamans after having had a state similar to trance and claims to have met spirits in this state. In rural areas, they are considered prophets and miracle healers. There are also male shamans, who serve at an altar. There are sacrifices of oxen, chickens, and other livestock.\n\nA complete family is considered to have three parts: The descendants of the same ancestors, the grave site, and the spirits of the ancestors.\nThe spirits of the ancestors are given great consideration and seen as protecting people. To return to the sacred world of the ancestors is seen as the greatest end for the deceased. Frequently, Mo practitioners have a hall for the ancestors of their homes where ancestors from the past three generations are venerated. Such halls are also the site of ancestor worship ceremonies for important festivals, weddings, deaths and births. It is not allowed to put dog, cat or snake meat in front of the hall. Mo adherents feel a mixture of fear and awe towards their ancestors, believing that their ancestors can support or punish them at will. Because they believe their fate is in the hands of their ancestors, the family propitiates the ancestors through prayer and sacrifices.\n\nMo practitioners celebrate the following festivals of Chinese origin: the Spring Festival, the Qingming Festival, the Duanwu Festival, the Mid-Autumn Festival and the Dongzhi Festival. Regular rituals are performed on traditional celebrations prescribed in the yearly calendar.\n\nThe supreme deity of Mo is a sky god. There are sacrifices to him on the morning of the new year.\n\nSanyuesan is a festival, which takes place on the 3rd of March of the lunar calendar and is considered to be as important as Qingming. On the same day, before the festival takes place, sacrifices for the ancestors take place and graves are cleaned. Adherents sing, and boys keep an eye out for potential female partners.\n\nCattle are seen as holy. The Cattle Soul Festival is celebrated on the 8th day of the 4th lunar month, which Mo adherents believe is the birthday of the Cattle King. On this day, adherents go to their cattle barns and free the animals from their yoke.\n\nThe Frog Festival takes place during the 1st lunar month, when people pray for rain and a good harvest.\n\nThe Ghost Festival takes several days, and is based on the belief that the deceased can contact their relatives as ghosts or by other supernatural means. Families clean their homes carefully and undertake other preparations; then the ghosts are welcomed. Finally, families say goodbye to the ghost and burn objects so that the ghosts are supplied in afterlife.\n\n\n"}

Its history can be divided into three periods: Early (old) Musavat, Musavat-in-exile and New Musavat.\n\nMusavat was founded in 1911 in Baku as a secret organization by Mammed Amin Rasulzade, Mammed Ali Rasulzade (cousin of Mammed Amin Rasulzade), Abbasgulu Kazimzade and Taghi Nagioglu. Its initial name was a Muslim Democratic Musavat Party. The first members were Veli Mikayiloghlu, Seyid Huseyn Sadig, Abdurrahim bey, Yusif Ziya bey and Seyid Musavi bey. Early Musavat members also included future Communist leader of Azerbaijan SSR Nariman Narimanov. This initiative was coming from Mammed Amin Rasulzade, who was then living in exile in Istanbul.\n\nIn its early years before the first world war, Musavat was a relatively small, secret underground organization, much like its counterparts throughout the Middle East, working for the prosperity and political unity of the Muslim and Turkic-speaking world. Although Musavat espoused pan-Islamic ideology and its founder was sympathetic to the pan-Turkic movement, the party supported the tsarist regime during the First World War. Russia's social democrats received the foundation of Musavat in what they considered \"imperial, orientalist terms, governed by the long-standing ideological categories of Muslim backwardness, treachery and religious fanaticism\", as a betrayal of historic proportions.\n\nThe Musavat's programme, which appealed to the Azerbaijani masses and assured the party of the sympathy of the Muslims abroad, announced the following aims:\n\nDuring this time, the Musavat party supported some pan-Islamist and pan-Turkist ideas. Pan-Turkic element in Musavat's ideology was a reflection of the novel ideas of the Young Turk revolution in Ottoman Empire. The founders of this ideology were Azerbaijani intellectuals of Russian Empire, Ali-bey Huseynzadeh and Ahmed-bey Agayev (known in Turkey as Ahmet Ağaoğlu), whose literary works used the linguistic unity of Turkic-speaking peoples as a factor for national awakening of various nationalities inhabiting the Russian Empire.\n\nThe Menshevik and Social Revolutionary parties of Baku, both largely dependent upon the support of selected Georgian, Armenian and Jewish cadrees, as well as upon the ethnic Russian workers, had long vilified the Muslims as \"inert\" and \"unconscious\". For them as well as for Bolsheviks, Constitutional Democrats and Denikinists, the Musavat, by default, was the false friend of social democracy, just a party of feudal \"beks and khans\". These accusations, centerpieces of a paranoid style in social-democratic politics, have endured in the historical literature far beyond their origins. But this form of attitude also alienated predominant Muslim groups from Russia's mainstream social democrats, as Musavat's shifting politics and populist slogans started receiving bigger appeal among the Muslim worker audience. Musavat leaders were largely well-educated professionals from the upper class echelons of Azeri society; its mass membership, most recruited between 1917 and 1919, comprised the poorly-educated Muslims underclass of Baku.\n\nAfter the Amnesty Act of 1913 dedicated to the 300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty, Mammed Amin Rasulzade returned to Azerbaijan and undertook party leadership. Despite the party still being secret, Rasulzade managed to found newspaper the newspaper \"Achig Soz\" (1915–1918), in which Musavat's aims and goals, this time polished and defined in Rasulzade's interpretations, were implicitly advocated. Only after the February Revolution, when Musavat ceased to be a secret organization and became a legal political party did the newspaper officially become the party's organ.\n\nThe Baku Committee of Muslim Social Organizations, as well as the Musavat, were quite radical during the early days of the February Revolution: they wanted a democratic republic, which would guarantee the rights of Muslims. The Soviet historian A. L. Popov writes that the Musavat cannot be \"a priori\" classified as a reactionary party of Khans and Beks, because in the early revolutionary period the Musavat stood on the positions of democracy and even socialism. \"Until a certain time the Baku Committee of Muslim Social Organizations and the Musavat party successfully fulfilled the mission not only of representing the general national interests but also of guiding the Azerbaijani workers' democracy\".\n\nOn June 17, 1917, Musavat merged with the Party of Turkic Federalists, another national-democratic right-wing organization founded by Nasibbey Usubbekov and Hasan bey Agayev, taking on a new name of Musavat Party of Turkic Federalists. Thus, Musavat became the main political force of Caucasian Muslims.\n\nIn October 1917 Musavat convoked in its first congress where it adopted new covenant, with 76 articles.\n\nParticularly, new covenant said:\n\nDuring the period from February until November 1917 Musavat shared the idea of federalism without separating from Russia. In accordance with the doctrine accepted by the Special Transcaucasian Committee (OZAKOM) the Georgian, Armenian and Aerbaijan territories were authorised to rule independent domestic policy, leaving to the Provisorial Russian government only foreign affairs, army and defense, and customs. However, Musavat as well as the other Muslims unions got quickly disappointed in cooperation with the Provisorial government, as it had no wish to delegate to the Muslim territories more independence.\n\nHaving got the news about the October Revolution in Petrograd (Saint Petersburg) Transcaucasia did not accept the new Bolshevik power. In February 1918 Transcaucasian Council (\"Sejm\") started its work in Tbilisi. Musavat entered the Sejm as one of the ruling parties, having 30 deputies of 125. The other parties represented in the new intritution were Georgian mensheviks (32 deputies) and Armenian \"dashnaks\" (27 deputies). At this stage Musavat started propagating the pan-Islamist and pan-Turkish ideas and aimed at creation of United Muslim State under protection of Turkey (Ottoman Empire). The majority of the Party's members were merchants, white-collars and partially peasantry.\n\nMusavat became the tenth largest party elected to the Russian Constituent Assembly(1918).\n\nAfter the disintegration of the Russian Empire and the Declaration of Independence, Musavat became the leading party of the newly established Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, holding the majority of mandates in its parliaments, at first in Azerbaijani National Council and then in \"Parlaman\" (\"parliament\"), Rasulzade being its first head of state (28 May 1918 7 December 1918). Under the Musavat's leadership, the name \"Azerbaijan\" was adopted; a name that prior to the proclamation of the ADR was solely used to refer to the adjacent region of contemporary northwestern Iran. Azerbaijan became in 1918 the first secular democracy in the Muslim world. A year later, in 1919, Azerbaijani women were granted the right to vote, before the U.S. and some European countries.\n\nThe following Musavat members held positions in successive ADR governments:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the fall of the first Republic in April 1920 as a result of the Bolshevik invasion, Musavat switched to secret activities again, by forming a secret committee, in which even famous Azeri playwright Jafar Jabbarli participated. The committee's most famous action was the preparation of the Rasulzade's flight from the Russian SFSR to Finland. Overall, Musavat prepared and conducted several armed insurgency operations, e.g. the rebellions of Ganja, Karabakh, Zagatala and Lankoran. But the Soviets also repressed Musavat by arresting at least 2,000 members of Musavat up to 1923. Most prominent Musavat members thus were killed, exiled or escaped abroad and the party ceased all its activities within Azerbaijan in 1923.\nActivities of Musavat in exile begin in the end of 1922 and in the beginning of 1923. in order to coordinate and lead these activities Mammed Amin Rasulzade established a Foreign Bureau of Musavat in 1923, but also created the Azerbaijani National Center in order to coordinate their activity with other Azeri political immigrants not affiliated with Musavat. Istanbul became the center of Musavat-in-exile in the 1920s and early 30s, before moving to Ankara in the late 1940s.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resurrection of Musavat in Azerbaijan came in 1989, during the second independence of Azerbaijan. A group of intellectuals created the \"Azerbaijan National Democratic New Musavat Party\". Later that group formed the \"Restoration Center of the Musavat Party\" and was recognized by Musavat-in-exile. In 1992 delegates of New Musavat and Musavat-in-exile gathered in the \"III Congress of Musavat\" and formally re-established the party as the Musavat Party. One of the leaders of the Popular Front, Isa Gambar was elected its chairman. He remains its leader as of 2013. The party structure consists of \"Başqan\" (Leader), \"Divan\" (Executive Board), and \"Məclis\" (Congress).\n\nSince 1993, Musavat has been in the opposition to the ruling New Azerbaijan Party. Due to a split between its nationalist and its liberal wing, the party failed to adopt a unified programme at the October 1997 congress. At the 2000/2001 elections, the party won 4.9% of the popular vote and two out of 125 seats. As the party's candidate, its leader Isa Qambar won 12.2% of the popular vote in the 15 October 2003 presidential elections. At the parliamentary elections of 6 November 2005, it joined the Freedom alliance, and won inside the alliance five seats. Musavat is also known for its protests against the Azerbaijani government such as that took place on 16 October 2003, after Isa Qambar had lost the election, as well as on March 12, 2011.\n\nWhen Musavat applied for membership of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR, now Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, ALDE), some members considered Musavat's ideology to be incompatible with Western liberalism. Board member Nasib Nasibli even resigned, stating that the party was committed to Turkic nationalism rather than liberalism. Nevertheless, Musavat was eventually admitted to ELDR.\n\nThe party has alleged that the Azerbaijani government has been seized by leading politicians of Kurdish, Talysh, Armenian or other ethnic groups of non-Turkic origin.\n"}

The show was titled “August” after its centerpiece, a fine 3D video from 2016 that was inspired by the life of August Sander, a German portrait and documentary photographer. But that video, along with an earlier one, has been upstaged by a surrounding installation that transforms Cohan’s white-box space into a New York Chinatown shop or bus-company waiting room with metal chairs, broken A.T.M.s and a shabby facade. Fast seems to have intended the Cohan gallery “waiting room” not as a replication of any real Chinatown but as the kind of fantasy version of immigrant neighborhoods evoked to justify “slum clearance.” While the work was intended to provoke a strong reaction, a group of Chinatown-based activists have called out the piece as racist “poverty porn,” pure and simple, and demanded its removal.\nIn 2015 Fast released his first feature film, based on the Tom McCarthy novel \"Remainder\"\n\n\"Continuity\" features an older couple who hires male escorts to play out their dead son’s return from Afghanistan.

The exhibition included \"Nostalgia\", a three-part film installation that intermingles a man’s account of his struggle for asylum in Britain with a reenactment of his story as a 1970s science fiction movie in which he attempts to flee a dystopian Europe and relocate to a colony in Africa.\nFast's 2009-2010 Nostalgia at the Whitney Museum of American Art was part of the 2008 Bucksbaum Award, given to the most prominent artist in that year's Whitney Biennial.\n\nIn the four-channel video piece \"Casting\", the viewer walks into the screening room initially encountering two hanging projection screens. Each screen contains a different depiction of a narrative showing the characters acting while silent and remaining completely still. The projection screens are double sided and contain two additional images on the rear side where the viewer sees two men engaged in an interview. The two men are a young American Army sergeant and the artist in a dialog about the narrative. The artist states during the interview that he is interested only in memory and how memory gets mediated; he says the work he is trying to achieve has or should have no political slant. Although the work is politically ambiguous it shows the powerlessness of an American Army sergeant in the current Iraqi conflict and possibly the powerlessness of perceived American hegemonic power.\n\nIn 2002, Fast released \"CNN Concatenated\", an 18-minute-long single-channel video which uses CNN news anchor clips. The video is cut so that each word is spoken by a different newsperson. The pieces literally asks the viewers questions about media authenticity and gives CNN a distinct voice.\n\nThe 59-minute two-channel work centers on interviews with residents of Krakow, Poland, who worked as extras in the concentration camp scenes in Steven Spielberg's film \"Schindler's List\".

This title is applied to a number of images around the world, including several in Spain, one in Quito, Ecuador, and one in Parañaque City, Philippines. The image in Quito was the source of an apparition to Mother Mariana de Jésus Torres.\n\nThe title \"Virgen del Buen Suceso\" may have originated with Pope Paul V who, in 1607, gave this name to a Marian image he entrusted as patroness to the Obregonian Brothers. There is a representation of the \"Virgen de la Buena Suerte\" in the chapel of the Catholic Monarchs in Granada, Spain. The location suggests a connection with maritime travel and seafarers' safetyAnother image with the same name is located in Prats de Llusanès, Barcelona. \n\nIn 1577 five Conceptionist sisters traveled from Spain to Quito, Ecuador to start the first convent. Mariana de Jésus Torres, one of the young nuns, is said to have seen the Blessed Mother. On February 2, 1599, as Mariana was praying, the Blessed Mother appeared to her and commanded a statue to be made to her likeness.\n\n“First so that men in the future might realize how powerful I am in placating Divine Justice and obtaining mercy and pardon for every sinner who comes to me with a contrite heart. For I am the Mother of Mercy and in me there is only goodness and love.\nWhen tribulations of spirit and sufferings of the body oppress them and they seem to be drowning in this bottomless sea let them gaze at my holy image and I will always be there ready to listen to their cries and soothe their pain. Tell them that they should always run to their Mother with confidence and love...”\n\nOver the course of ten years Mother Mariana struggled with the issue of completing the statue. Many obstacles prevented its sculpting. One obstacle was a fear of idolatry on the part of the native people in Quito. Another was Mother Mariana’s personal fear of not being believed and thus putting the convent in jeopardy. In the year 1610, she asked the permission of the Bishop to create the statue. The sculpting of the statue of Our Lady of Good Success was given to Francisco del Castillo. Castillo was chosen as he was a talented sculptor and a devotee of the Blessed Mother. The miraculous statue of Our Lady of Good Success was blessed on February 2, 1611. On that day, she was placed above the seat of the Abbess chair at her own specific request as a sign to all that she was the one who governed and watched over the convent. Her official title being that of “Mary of the Good Event of the Purification” (Suceso in Spanish means “event” or “occurrence”.\n\nIn Ecuador and Spain, the feast day of Our Lady of Good Success is celebrated on February 2 the day she appeared to Mother Mariana along with the archangels and St. Francis of Assisi (thus coinciding with the Feast of the Purification).\n\n\n"}

After learning the news, the women's husbands, thinking that it was a joke, went to investigate about the event, thinking that someone was hidden among the bushes around there, but they didn't find anybody.\n\nThen the local authorities inquired on the spot, cut down the near grove and found the ruins of a \"cuba\", an old arc of a mill that nobody remembered any longer, and inside there was a fresco on a stone made by an anonymous painter of the 13th century representing Our Lady with the Child Jesus, which at first the believers called \"Madonna Fons Misericordiae\" (that is Our Lady Source of Mercy).\n\nAfter this discovery all the people started praying before the image rediscovered and in the following days there were several miracles.\n\nThen since 1547, Our Lady of Miracles became the patron saint of Alcamo, in substitution of the Holy Crucified, who was the patron saint of Alcamo and other near small towns (among which Calatafimi and Salemi). The old patron saint's memory however remains in Alcamo people's mind: in fact they call San Francesco di Paola \"santu patri\" (whose translation means \"patron saint\") as the Church named after him was called the Holy Crucified Church.\n\nThe Madonna's discovered image was first called \"Our Lady Source of Mercy”, but thanks to the high number of subsequent miracles, in 1583 the name was changed into \"Our Lady of Miracles\".\n\nFurther to these events, Don Fernando Vega, Alcamo's governor and justice captain, ordered the construction of the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Miracles, which hosts the Madonna's image. Inside the Church there is a white marble sarcophagus containing the mortal remains of the governor Don Fernando Vega, according to his will.\n\nEvery year in Alcamo there are the celebrations in honour of Our Lady of Miracles since 19 June until 21 of June. This is the most important religious and folkloristic festivity in Alcamo. The real celebrations are often anticipated by other events, so extending the feast to about two weeks, in this way the beginning of the celebrations changes every year, while the last day is always the 21 of June.\n\nThe celebrations include:\n\nThe traditional descent to the sanctuary is put on during the so-called \"Historical Cortege\" with period costumes. This cortege, which anticipates the real \"calata\", passes through Corso 6 Aprile and Piazza Ciullo, and finally ends at the Castle of the Counts of Modica (also called \"Castle of Alcamo\"). The workmen of the association \"I Cavalieri di San Giorgio\" (San Giorgio's knights). take part in the cortege too.\n\nIn the past there were the horse races along Corso 6 Aprile too (and in the last years also in Viale Italia), but this tradition (called \"Palio di Alcamo\") was then interrupted owing to the requests done by the \"Associazione Nazionale Tutela Animali\", the \"International Organization for Animal Protection\" and by the Observatory Zoomafia of Lega anti vivisezione, (organizations which protect animals) that denounced the abuses animals suffered and the presence of people involved in illicit activities.\n\nSince 1615, the year in which Alcamo was seriously hit by pestilence, there is the so-called \"Penitential Procession\" of Madonna of Miracles. It takes place on the third Sunday of Lent: the Madonna's statue is brought from the Basilica of Our Lady's Assumption to the Church of Saints Paul and Bartholomew, where it remains for a week and is solemnized, then it goes back to the mother church.\n\n\n"}

He was a prolific writer of fiction and wrote the notable dystopian novel \"Lord of the World\" (1907). His output encompassed historical, horror and science fiction, contemporary fiction, children's stories, plays, apologetics, devotional works and articles. He continued his writing career at the same time as he progressed through the hierarchy to become a Chamberlain to the Pope in 1911 and subsequently titled Monsignor.\n\nBenson was the youngest son of Edward White Benson (Archbishop of Canterbury) and his wife, Mary, and the younger brother of Edward Frederic Benson and Arthur Christopher Benson.\n\nBenson was educated at Eton College and then studied classics and theology at Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1890 to 1893.\n\nIn 1895, Benson was ordained a priest in the Church of England by his father, who was the then Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nAfter his father died suddenly in 1896, Benson was sent on a trip to the Middle East to recover his own health. While there he began to question the status of the Church of England and to consider the claims of the Roman Catholic Church. His own piety began to tend toward the High Church tradition, and he started exploring religious life in various Anglican communities, eventually obtaining permission to join the Community of the Resurrection.\n\nBenson made his profession as a member of the community in 1901, at which time he had no thoughts of leaving the Church of England. As he continued his studies and began writing, however, he became more and more uneasy with his own doctrinal position and, on 11 September 1903, he was received into the Catholic Church. He was awarded the Dignitary of Honour of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre.\n\nBenson was ordained as a Roman Catholic priest in 1904 and sent to Cambridge. He continued his writing career along with his ministry as a priest.\n\nLike both his brothers, Edward Frederic Benson (\"Fred\") and Arthur Christopher Benson, Robert wrote many ghost and horror stories, as well as children's stories and historical fiction. His horror and ghost fiction are collected in \"The Light Invisible\" (1903) and \"A Mirror of Shallott\" (1907). His novel, \"Lord of the World\" (1907), is generally regarded as one of the first modern dystopian novels (see List of dystopian literature). The bibliography below reveals a prodigious output.\n\nBenson was appointed a supernumerary private chamberlain to the Pope (Pius X) in 1911 and consequently styled as Monsignor.\n\nAs a young man, Benson recalled, he had rejected the idea of marriage as \"quite inconceivable\". He had a close friendship with \"Baron Corvo\", \"alias\" the notorious novelist Frederick Rolfe, with whom he had hoped to write a book on Thomas Becket, until Benson decided that he should not be associated (according to writer Brian Masters) \"with a Venetian pimp and procurer of boys\". Nevertheless he maintained his friendship with Lord Alfred Douglas, the friend and lover of Oscar Wilde, and when an acquaintance who protested that the connection with Douglas was inappropriate for him, he replied: \"Lord Alfred Douglas is my friend, and he'll come down when he likes!\"\n\nBenson died of pneumonia in 1914 in Salford, where he had been preaching a mission. He was 42. At his request, he was buried in the orchard of Hare Street House, his house in the Hertfordshire village of Hare Street. A chapel, dedicated to St Hugh, was built over the site. Benson bequeathed the house to the Catholic Church as a county retreat for the Archbishop of Westminster. The Roman Catholic church in the nearby town of Buntingford, which he helped finance, is dedicated to St Richard of Chichester, but also known as the Benson Memorial Church.\n\nScience fiction\n\nHistorical fiction\n\nContemporary Fiction\n\nChildren's Books\n\nDevotional Works\n\nApologetic Works\n\nPlays\n\nSelected articles\n\nOther\n\n\n\n"}

While the concept of sacred contagion has existed in numerous cultures since before recorded history, the term \"sacred contagion\" originated with French sociologist Émile Durkheim, who introduced it in his book, \"The Elementary Forms of Religious Life\". For example, the Book of Leviticus, in Chapters 11 through 15, specifies which animals are considered spiritually clean and unclean, and defines women during menstruation and men after a nocturnal emission as unclean.\n\nThe text also gives many examples of sacred contagion brought about by contact with these spiritually unclean people and things. For example, chapter 15 states that spiritual uncleanliness exists not only in the menstruating woman but also the bed she sleeps in, as well as any object placed upon that bed, and any person who touches an object placed upon that bed. We see not only the passing of uncleanliness through spiritual contagion, but also that the uncleanliness may be further passed, from person to object and back to person indefinitely.\n\nAnthropologist Mary Douglas, whose work is heavily influenced by Durkheim, wrote an extensive modern work on the topic of sacred contagion entitled \"Purity and Danger: An Analysis of the Concepts of Pollution and Taboo\". She states that, \"We cannot understand sacred contagion unless we distinguish a class of cultures in which pollution ideas flourish from another class of cultures, including our own, in which they do not.\" Douglas and Durkheim both rejected the idea that concepts of purity and impurity, such as those found in Leviticus, were an attempt to use religion to explain hygiene, an otherwise impossible task in the scientific terms of the time, several millennium before the concept of germs. Instead, according to Douglas and Durkheim, spiritual cleanliness and physical cleanliness are wholly separate and must be considered on their own terms.\n\n\n"}

The United States, United Kingdom and Australia have well established Christian sports chaplaincy ministries. \n\nIn 1982 a congress held in Hong Kong on sports mission saw sports chaplains and those interested in Mission to people engaged in sports come together from around the world including recognised representatives from North and South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, the sub-continent and Australasia. It was this congress that created the inspiration to further develop or initiate national sports missions and sports chaplains. \n\nSports chaplains consist of people from many different walks of life. Most commonly, the chaplains are ministers or full-time Christian workers but always, chaplaincy work is done without charge or any financial remuneration. Often, sports chaplains to a particular sport are former participants of that sport. This helps the chaplain to not only provide spiritual support and guidance to a player, but gives them the ability to empathize and relate to some of the challenges facing the participant with whom they are ministering.\n\nThere were 193 multi-faith sports chaplains at the London 2012 Olympics.\n\nThe USA have various sport related chaplaincy organizations. Along with major Denominations, Ministries such as Athletes in Action and Fellowship of Christian Athletes also provide chaplains to various sports at the collegiate and professional levels. Every major professional sport in the United States has at least some sports chaplaincy. Some sports are more coordinated, like Major League Baseball (see www.baseballchapel.org), but most are far more loosely structured with each chaplain having a program that best suits their team and individual situation. Every MLB, NFL, NBA & Major League Soccer franchise has a chaplain. Due to financial constraints, very few chaplains travel with their teams. In some cases, especially when an individual coach understands the value of the chaplain to their team, the coach may invite the chaplain to come on a road trip. This happens far more frequently when a team is traveling a short distance to a neighboring city by bus or motor coach, but in some cases, coaches have paid (out of their own pocket) to bring a chaplain on a road trip. \n\nIn recent years, much more work is being done by chaplains in specific sports to coordinate and work together so that their players can have support and encouragement from a chaplain even when they are “on the road”. \n\nIn addition, the US Olympic Team travels with one or more chaplains, primarily to provide emotional support to the athletes.\n\nSports Chaplaincy UK, formerly known as SCORE was established in 1991 under the guidance and direction of the Baptist Union of Great Britain to use the specialist experience of one of their ministers to pioneer sports chaplaincy and sports ministry.\n\nCalled Sports Chaplaincy UK since 2011, the Christian charity seeks to resource over 250 chaplains in a variety of sports and situations. Their chaplains are mainly in football, rugby union, rugby league, cricket and horseracing. They supplied over 40 chaplains to serve at the London2012 Olympics. All offer pastoral and spiritual support in a sensitive, non-judgement, non-sectarian way. All work with integrity and professionalism amongst the whole community of their clubs - the players, coaches, organisation and support staff. There is a real sense of affirmation and endorsement from the widest spectrum of the sports world, from the chaplains' work and involvement.\n\nAs a direct result of the Hong Kong 1982 Congress on Sports Mission, pioneered by Mark Tronson, the Australian Heads of Churches approved a Sports Chaplaincy mission, which was named the 'Sports and Leisure Ministry' (SLM). It was initially housed within the well established InterChurch Trade and Industry Mission (ITIM). In 1985 Australian Heads of Churches gave SLM its independence and in 1987 its Heads of Churches appointed board members adopted incorporation. In 2000 Heads of Churches released its founder, Mark Tronson, to establish Well-Being Australia, specialising in athlete respite. Five years later in 2005 SLM changed its name to Sports Chaplaincy Australia (SCA). \n\nAs a result of its solid foundation under Australian Heads of Churches, SLM (now SCA) has seen many professional sports in Australia adopt sport chaplains. Over 180 chaplains now serve in sports and sport organizations such as cricket, motor racing, tennis, rugby league, basketball, baseball, soccer, golf, yachting, skiing, netball, rodeo and horse racing, the Australian Institute of Sport, and State Institutes of Sport.\n\n\nSports Chaplaincy Australia\nWell-Being Australia\n"}

He is mentioned as the son of the Hindu water deity Varuna and Parnasa. Kalinga is mentioned to have joined the Kaurava camp in the epic war. The story of Srutayudha in the Mahabharata says that his mother had wished for a boon from Varuna for his son so that he could not be slayed by anyone in battle. Varuna had presented a magical mace to Srutayudha by using which he would stay undefeated in battle.\n\nVaruna had also warned about the adverse effects of the magical Mace if it was used against an unarmed opponent. According to the warning, the Mace would strike back Srutyudha himself if he used it against any unarmed person. Srutyudha stood in the front of the Akshauhini of soldiers in the Kaurava side along with Sakuni, Salya, Jayadratha, two princes of Avanti named Vinda and Anuvinda, and the Kekaya brothers, and Sudakshina the ruler of the Kamvojas, Jayatsena, Vrihadvala, Kritavarman . The Mahabharata describes these selected warriors as the tigers in men\n\nAs per the narration in the epic of Mahbharata, Srutayudha challenged Arjuna in the battlefield while he marched on his chariot into the lines of the Kamboja army division and targeted Kritavarman. Srutayudha stuck Arjuna and Krishna with multiple arrows and injured them in the height of the battle. Arjuna fired back arrows at him and then cut off Srutayudha's bow and then his quiver and then struck him on the chest. Arjuna then killed Srutayudha's steeds and charioteer incapacitating his movement on the chariot in the battle. Srutayudha filled with wrath rushed at Arjuna with his magical mace and hurled the mace at Krishna who was an unarmed participant in the battle as the charioteer of Arjuna. As per the conditions described by Varuna earlier while gifting the Mace to him, it didn't harm the unarmed Krishna but boomeranged back on Srutyudha killing him.\n"}

{"id": "1397993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1397993", "title": "The Genesis Flood", "text": "The Genesis Flood\n\nThe Genesis Flood: The Biblical Record and its Scientific Implications is a 1961 book by young Earth creationists John C. Whitcomb and Henry M. Morris that, according to Ronald Numbers, elevated young Earth creationism \"to a position of fundamentalist orthodoxy.\"\n\nBy the late nineteenth century, geologists, physicists and biologists agreed that the age of the Earth was well over 20 million years. Prior to the use of radiometric dating, scientific estimates before 1900 ranged between 20 million and 3 billion years old. Most Christians \"readily conceded that the Bible allowed for an ancient earth and pre-Edenic life.\" With very few exceptions they accommodated the new geological theories either with day-age creationism, the belief that the six days of Genesis represented vast ages, or by separating the original creation from a later Edenic creation: the so-called gap theory. The primary promoter of \"flood geology\" during the early twentieth century was George McCready Price, but he had comparatively little influence among evangelicals because he was a Seventh-day Adventist, a church treated warily by many conservative Protestants.\n\nBy the 1950s, most evangelical scientists scorned flood geology, and those who accepted the theory were increasingly marginalized within the American Scientific Affiliation (founded 1941), an evangelical organization that gradually shifted from strict creationism to progressive creationism and theistic evolution. In 1954, Bernard Ramm, an evangelical apologist and theologian closely associated with the ASA, published \"The Christian View of Science and Scripture\", which attacked the notion that \"biblical inspiration implied that the Bible was a reliable source of scientific data.\" Ramm ridiculed both flood geology and the gap theory, and one ASA member credited Ramm with providing a way for a majority of Christian biologists to accept evolution.\n\nRamm's book sparked a young Bible teacher and seminarian, John C. Whitcomb, Jr., to challenge what he considered its \"absurdities.\" Whitcomb had earlier studied geology and paleontology at Princeton University, but by the 1950s, he was teaching the Bible at Grace Theological Seminary. At the 1953 ASA meeting, Whitcomb had been impressed by a presentation of Henry M. Morris—a hydraulic engineer with a PhD from the University of Minnesota—called \"The Biblical Evidence for Recent Creation and Universal Deluge.\" Following publication of Ramm's book, Whitcomb decided to devote his ThD dissertation to defending flood geology.\n\nBerated almost from the beginning of his project by influential evangelicals such as Edward John Carnell, the newly installed president of Fuller Theological Seminary, Whitcomb completed his dissertation in 1957 and began condensing it for publication. With no illusions about his scientific expertise, Whitcomb sought a collaborator who had a PhD in science. He could find no geologists who took Genesis seriously, and even teachers at evangelical schools at best expressed distaste for flood geology. Eventually, Henry Morris agreed to be Whitcomb's collaborator for the scientific portions of the book. Despite his heavy teaching load and administrative duties at Virginia Tech, where he had just become head of a large civil-engineering program, Morris made steady progress on his section of the book, eventually contributing more than twice as much material as Whitcomb.\n\nAs the manuscript neared completion, Moody Press, which had expressed initial interest, now hesitated. The proposed book was a long work, insisting on six literal days of creation, certain to be criticized by segments of Moody's constituency. Whitcomb and Morris instead published with the smaller Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company, whose owner Charles H. Craig had long wanted to acquire a manuscript that supported catastrophism.\n\nAfter opening with the declaration that \"the Bible is the infallible Word of God,\" Whitcomb's section provides biblical arguments for a universal flood as well as attempting to refute non-geological difficulties with the biblical account. Whitcomb specifically addresses the local flood theories of Bernard Ramm—who has far more entries in the index than anyone else. Whitcomb concludes his section of the work with a review of how geological theories had influenced Christian views of the Flood since the beginning of the nineteenth century and draws the \"one vitally important lesson,\" that the biblical doctrine of the Flood cannot be harmonized with \"uniformitarian theories.\"\n\nMorris introduces his section on geology with the frank statement that Bible-believing Christians face \"a serious dilemma\" because contemporary geologists present \"an almost unanimous verdict\" against the biblical account of creation and the Flood. Nevertheless, Morris assures believers that \"evidences of full divine inspiration of Scripture are far weightier than the evidences for any fact of science.\" Morris then argues that \"fossil-bearing strata were apparently laid down in large measure during the Flood, with the apparent sequences attributed not to evolution but rather to hydrodynamic selectivity, ecologic habitats, and differential mobility and strength of the various creatures.\" He also dismisses the theory of \"thrust faults,\" the mainstream geological theory by which \"old\" rocks were presumed to have come to rest on \"young\" rocks. Morris argues that commonly accepted geological theories do not truly depend on scientific data but are rather a \"moral and emotional decision,\" in which evolutionists seek \"intellectual justification for escape from personal responsibility to his Creator and escape from the 'way of the Cross' as the necessary and sufficient means of his personal redemption.\" Finally, in the longest chapter of the book, Morris addresses \"problems in biblical geology,\" which include commonly used dating methods (such as carbon-14 measurements) as well as geological formations, such as coral reefs, petrified forests, and varves, all of which imply great age for the earth.\n\nSeveral dozen Christian magazines reviewed the book and generally praised its defense of the scriptural account of the Flood, although few seemed to understand that accepting Whitcomb and Morris meant rejecting the day-age and gap theories. \"Christianity Today\", the most important evangelical magazine of the period, published a tepid review that did not address issues raised by the book but instead criticized the authors for using secondary sources and taking arguments out of context. The American Scientific Affiliation featured two hostile reviews, and in 1969, the ASA \"Journal\" published a highly critical commentary by J. R. van der Fliert, a Dutch Reformed geologist at the Free University of Amsterdam, who called Whitcomb and Morris \"pseudo-scientific\" pretenders. \"To ensure that no readers missed his point,\" the journal \"ran boldfaced sidebars by evangelical geologists applauding van de Fliert's bare-knuckled approach.\"\n\nOutside fundamentalist circles \"The Genesis Flood\" created \"hardly a ripple of recognition.\" Its release went unnoted by professional geology journals and periodicals covered by \"Book Review Digest\". In a talk given to the large Houston Geological Society, Morris received a whimsical introduction by the president that fell well short of praise for his work. His call for questions at the conclusion of his talk produced none; one member said the audience was \"too stunned to speak.\"\n\nScientists generally regard the book as a religious apologetic rather than a research document. The Geology Department of Baptist-affiliated Baylor University, in describing the known age of the earth as \"4.51 to 4.55 billion years with a confidence of 1% or better\", defined the key ingredient needed in methodology: \"The defining characteristic of a scientific hypothesis is that it must be testable or falsifiable using reproducible observations. An idea that cannot be tested is not a scientific hypothesis. Scientific hypotheses are developed to fit data; data are not collected to fit or support hypotheses \"post facto.\"\" Joel Cracraft, \"Systematics, Comparative Biology and the Case Against Creationism,\" in Laurie R. Godfrey, \"Scientists Confront Creationism\" (New York: Norton, 1983) attacked the Whitcomb and Morris theory of a quick dispersal of animals from the Ark: \"During the last decade biogeographers have come to realize that when the postulated phylogenetic relationships of organisms—both plants and animals—are examined relative to their distributions, many highly congruent, nonrandom patterns emerge.\" The National Center for Science Education and other critics have shown \"The Genesis Flood\" misquotes scientific source material and takes remarks out of context. For example, in one instance, a source which read \"the sea which vanished so many million years ago\" was quoted as \"the sea which vanished so many years ago.\" Geologist John G. Solum has criticized the work for being inaccurate. Solum noted \"Whitcomb and Morris are mistaken about the nature of the rocks associated with thrust faults. Their claim about fossils is based on a Young Earth creationist misunderstanding of how rocks are dated relative to each other, and how the geologic column was constructed.\" In fact Solum noted, \"Morris' explanation of relative dating is not 'somewhat oversimplified' it is entirely incorrect.\"\n\nWhitcomb and Morris \"attributed the impasse between themselves and their critics to competing cosmologies\" and argued that the term \"science\" could refer only to \"present and reproducible phenomena\", not to observations made about past events. Morris filled out his own cosmology a bit further in \"The Remarkable Birth of Planet Earth\" (1972), saying that the craters of the moon were probably caused by a cosmic battle between the forces of Satan and the armies of the archangel Michael. In defense of their work, Whitcomb and Morris noted that the founders of modern geological science were, like them, non-specialists: Charles Lyell (a lawyer), William Smith (a surveyor), James Hutton (a doctor and gentleman farmer), John Playfair (a mathematician), as well as a number of clergymen.\n\nHistorian of Science Michael D. Gordin has called \"The Genesis Flood\" \"one of postwar America's most culturally significant works about the natural world. It was read by hundreds of thousands, spawned its own research institutes, and remains absolutely rejected by every mainstream biologist and geologist.\" \"The Genesis Flood\" also \"became a best-seller in the Fundamentalist world and polarized Evangelical opinion.\" In 25 years, \"The Genesis Flood\" went through 29 printings and sold more than 200,000 copies. An old-earth creationist book, written specifically to challenge young-earth geological theories, called the late twentieth-century revival of interest in flood geology \"astonishing and perplexing,\" especially \"in the face of increasing geologic and astronomical evidence for the vast antiquity of the Earth and the universe.\" Again, in the words of a critic, Arthur McCalla, the growth in young-earth creationism occurred not because modern fundamentalists were more ignorant than in previous generations but because young-earth creationism \"better defended a plain-sense reading of the inerrant Bible than did the old-Earth creationism of Ramm and the earlier Fundamentalists...Legions of Bible believers responded gratefully to Whitcomb and Morris because their system eliminated once and for all the need for interpretative contortions that twist and bend the words of the Bible in order to reconcile them with the findings of modern science.\"\n\nPublication changed the lives of both the authors. Morris especially was deluged with speaking invitations, and his notoriety became an embarrassment to Virginia Tech. In 1963, Morris became a founder of the Creation Research Society and then, in 1970, the Institute for Creation Research. He wrote many more books devoted to young-earth creationism.\n\nDuring the late twentieth century, young-earth creationism sparked by \"The Genesis Flood\" was regularly featured on Christian radio and became a staple of the home-school movement. An International Conference on Creationism, held every fifth year in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, produces papers of \"considerable scientific and mathematical sophistication,\" and the movement attracts younger scholars with PhDs in the sciences, including even a few in geology. Ken Ham, perhaps the best known young-earth creationist of the early twenty-first century, the founder of Answers in Genesis and the Creation Museum near Cincinnati, called Morris “one of my heroes of the faith. He is the man the Lord raised up as the father of the modern creationist movement. The famous book \"The Genesis Flood\"...was the book the Lord used to really launch the modern creationist movement around the world.”\n\n\n\n"}

Starring Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride and Craig Robinson, the film centers on fictionalized versions of themselves facing a global biblical apocalypse. The film premiered at the Fox Village Theater on June 3, 2013 and was released theatrically in the United States on June 14, 2013 by Columbia Pictures before being re-released on September 6, 2013. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing $126 million on a $32 million budget.\n\nJay Baruchel arrives in Los Angeles to visit old friend and fellow Canadian actor Seth Rogen, who invites him to a party hosted by James Franco. Jay is uncomfortable at the crowded party so Seth accompanies him to a convenience store for cigarettes. When beams of blue light come down and suck numerous people into the sky, Seth and Jay flee back to Franco's house and find the party unharmed. An earthquake strikes and the crowd rushes outside. A sinkhole opens in James' yard swallowing several attendees. Seth, Jay, James, Jonah Hill and Craig Robinson run back inside the house. Jay tells the remaining party-goers that the earthquake has destroyed most of Los Angeles. They take inventory of their supplies, set up a ration system, board up the house and await help.\n\nThe next morning, Danny McBride, unaware of the crisis, wastes much of their food and water. He disbelieves what the others tell him of the previous night's events until a man outside is decapitated by an unseen creature. Tensions rise due to various conflicts including Jay and Seth's growing estrangement, and the others' skepticism of Jay's belief that the disaster might be the Apocalypse predicted in the Book of Revelation. Due to a misunderstanding Emma Watson believes the group is planning to rape her and leaves with the group's remaining drinks. \n\nCraig goes for water but encounters an unknown being causing him to believe Jay's theory. Jay and Seth dig through the floor and find water, but Danny wastes most of it out of spite and the others kick him out of the house. Before leaving, Danny reveals that Jay was in town two months prior but stayed at a hotel instead of with Seth because of their strained friendship. Jonah annoys Jay, who punches him in the nose. Later Jonah prays for Jay to die and is possessed by a demon. Seth and James are attacked by the possessed Jonah. Jay and Craig subdue Jonah and tie him up. During an exorcism attempt Jay and Seth fight and knock over a candle. A fire starts, engulfing Jonah and the house and forcing the others outside.\n\nJames suggests driving to his home in Malibu but finds his car guarded by a demon. Craig volunteers to sacrifice himself and is raptured into Heaven when the plan succeeds. The others realize they can save themselves by performing a selfless act. They are captured by a group of cannibals led by Danny. When James volunteers to sacrifice himself, a blue beam begins to pull him to Heaven, but when he taunts and insults Danny the beam vanishes. Danny and the other cannibals devour James while Seth and Jay run away. They encounter an enormous demonic being. Jay apologizes to Seth for his actions while the being attempts to eat them. A beam strikes Jay and he begins to ascend while Seth does not. Jay grabs Seth's hand but his presence prevents them from ascending into Heaven. Seth forces Jay to leave him behind whereupon another beam appears around Seth. The pair arrive in Heaven where they are greeted by Craig who tells them that any desire comes true there. Jay wishes for the Backstreet Boys and the band performs \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" as everyone dances.\n\nMost of the film's cast portray fictional, exaggerated versions of themselves:\n\nRogen and Goldberg told interviewers, \"We always wanted to do a movie where people played themselves and something extraordinary happened; the initial version of the film was Seth Rogen and Busta Rhymes were filming a music video and a film respectively, on the Sony lot, and Antmen attacked from the center of the earth.\" The film is also based on \"Jay and Seth versus the Apocalypse\", a short film created by Goldberg and Jason Stone in 2007.\n\nIn an interview with \"The Guardian\" Goldberg commented on influences contributing to the film, \"If you drilled down to the core of what I do, it's just ripping off little bits of Charlie Kaufman. Seth and I always loved \"The Larry Sanders Show\" too. And the popularity of reality television now also feeds into that idea of whether what we're watching is actually real. We thought working with our friends in that situation would be awesome because they're all comedians willing to take stabs at themselves.\" The actors play exaggerated versions of themselves, with only James Franco having no objections to doing what the script wanted him to do.\n\nWhile set in Los Angeles, principal photography was in New Orleans due to financial incentives from that city. Filming rolled from February to early July 2012. Modus FX made 240 visual effects for the film, including natural disasters, set extensions for the house, computer-generated demons, and the Rapture beams. After filming wrapped, Rogen and Goldberg were displeased with their ending; they considered putting Morgan Freeman in Heaven but he declined. Since \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" already played in a scene and the directors wanted to close on an over-the-top note, the directors decided to feature the Backstreet Boys in the scene instead.\n\nDuring production, the film was titled \"The Apocalypse\" which was later changed to \"The End of the World\". The name changed to \"This Is the End\" on December 20, 2012, upon the release of its first trailer and poster. This was done at the request of Rogen's \"Paul\" co-star Simon Pegg, who wrote to Rogen in concern that \"The End of the World\" was similar to his comedy film \"The World's End\" which was also released in summer 2013 and centered around an apocalypse with an ensemble cast. As \"The World's End\" was the name of a key location in that film, Pegg felt he couldn't change the name of his film.\n\nThis Is the End: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the soundtrack of the film. It was released on June 11, 2013 by RCA Records.\n\nThe score by Henry Jackman, with additional material by Dominic Lewis and Matthew Margeson and conducted by Nick Glennie-Smith, was not officially released on its own, not even as bonus tracks on the CD or digital releases on RCA's album. Despite that, a promotional album for the score does exist, according to Soundtrack.net.\nOn April 1, 2013 Sony released an April Fools' Day trailer for \"Pineapple Express 2\", which was actually a teaser trailer for \"This Is the End\". According to Rogen and Goldberg, however, the homemade \"Pineapple Express 2\" film in \"This Is the End\" depicts what they envision for the actual sequel. \n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 1, 2013. It was the last film to be rented by Blockbuster Video before they went out of business at 11:00 PM on November 9, 2013. The Blu-ray release fully contains the original short the film was based on, \"Jay and Seth versus the Apocalypse\", as a special feature.\n\n\"This Is the End\" grossed $101.5 million in the United States and Canada and $25.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $126.5 million, against a production budget of $32 million. It made a net profit of $50 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film.\n\nThe film was released in North America on June 14, 2013 alongside \"Man of Steel\", and was projected to open to around $12 million from 3,055 theaters. The film made $7.8 million on its first day and went on to debut to $20.7 million in its opening weekend (a five-day total of $33 million), finishing second at the box office behind \"Man of Steel\" ($116.6 million). In its second weekend it grossed $13.3 million, dropping to 4th.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 82% based on 214 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Energetic, self-deprecating performances and enough guffaw-inducing humor make up for the flaws in \"This Is the End\"s loosely written script.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nOwen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a letter grade of \"A\", saying, \"You could sit through a year's worth of Hollywood comedies and still not see anything that's genuinely knock-your-socks-off audacious. But \"This Is the End\" . . truly is. It's the wildest screen comedy in a long time and also the smartest, the most fearlessly inspired and the snort-out-loud funniest.\" Brian D. Johnson of \"Maclean's\" wrote, \"There could be worse ways to experience the apocalypse than with a party of stoned celebrities at James Franco's house. For one thing, his epic art collection can be used to board up the cracking walls against demons and zombies. That's the screwball scenario of \"This Is the End\"...The film unfolds as a profanely funny showbiz parody. But with perfect timing, it also sends up a genre that has recently gone viral at the multiplex: the apoca-blockbuster.\" Conversely, Canada's \"The Globe and Mail\" gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of five, comparing the film to the interminable wait for a cancelled bus and referring to the actors in the film as \"the lazy, the privileged and the mirthless\".\n\nWhen Evan Goldberg was asked whether a sequel to the film was probable, he said, \"If you ask me, I'd say there's a pretty good chance of a sequel. If you ask Seth Rogen, he'd say no.\" In June 2013, Goldberg announced ideas for a sequel in which the apocalypse occurs at the premiere of \"This Is the End\". \"Seth's a cokehead in this version, Michael Cera is a calm dude with a boyfriend, Rihanna and The Backstreet Boys are back,\" Goldberg said in an interview. \"We have a lot of ideas: a heaven and hell for example and a Garden of Eden version where Danny [McBride] is Adam.\" Despite this, Goldberg has stated that it would be difficult to recreate the casting conditions from the first film due to different schedules, believing them to be a stroke of luck, saying, \"I honestly don't know if we could get the guys together [again].\" In May 2014, Rogen posted a status of the sequel on Twitter saying \"I don't think we'll make a sequel to \"This Is the End\", but if we did, it would be called \"No, THIS Is the End\".\n\n\"This Is The End\" was adapted into a 3D maze entitled \"This Is The End: 3D\" at Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios Hollywood in 2015. The maze served as the event's first comedy-horror based attraction.\n\n\n"}

Although West Virginia is reported to have a low rate of religious adherence, it is above the national average rate of church attendance. Sociologist Samuel S. Hill, comparing data from the \"North American Religion Atlas\" and the American Religious Identity Survey, concluded that a \"disproportionately large number of West Virginians\" were not counted. In 2006, Gallup reported that the lowest rates of church attendance among the 48 contiguous states were in Nevada and the New England states of Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Maine. Church attendance in the western states of Oregon, Washington, and California was only slightly higher. A 2008 Gallup poll comparing belief in God among U.S. regions found that only 59% of residents in the Western United States believe in a god, compared to 80% in the East, 83% in the Midwest, and 86% in the South.\n\nA 2011 Gallup poll showed that when it comes to the number of people seeing religion as important in everyday life, New Hampshire and Vermont were the least religious, both with 23%, followed up with 25% in Maine.\n\nThere has been debate as to whether the Western United States is still the most irreligious part of the United States, due to New England surpassing it as the region with the highest percentage of residents unaffiliated with any religion. On a state level, it is not clear whether the least religious state resides in New England or the Western United States, as the 2008 American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) ranked Vermont as the state with the highest percentage of residents claiming no religion at 34%, but a 2009 Gallup poll ranked Oregon as the state with the highest percentage of residents identifying with \"No religion, Atheist, or Agnostic\", at 24.6%.\n\n\n"}

It was co-written and edited by Corey S. Powell and discusses advances in science in support of evolution. The book is Nye's extension of the Bill Nye–Ken Ham debate that took place in 2014.\n\n\"Undeniable\" was written by Bill Nye, best known as the host of \"Bill Nye the Science Guy\", which aired from 1993 to 1998 on PBS Kids. The show focused on Nye teaching natural science to a preteen audience. Nye transitioned into cable television where he spoke on the topic of science, including giving speaking tours at colleges and universities. During his speaking engagements, Nye would often become involved in a debate of creationism versus evolution, including a 2014 debate with creationist Ken Ham. Nye attributes this to being the inspiration for him writing the book.\n\nNye discusses the creationism versus evolution debate. He lays out evidence about life on earth evolving. He provides an overview of the evolutionary theories such as bottlenecking, punctuated equilibrium, Red Queen hypothesis, and the good enough design theory while at the same time providing counter arguments for creationism theories such as the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Nye also addresses scientific issues that include genetically modified foods and human cloning.\n\nThe book received considerable press, including \"The New York Times\" interviewing Nye about his inspiration and the subject of the book and a feature in \"National Geographic\". In addition to \"The New York Times\", the book was reviewed by major news outlets that included \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"Scientific American\", \"U.S. News & World Report\", C-SPAN, HuffPost Live, \"The Washington Post\", and CBS News.\n\n\"The Wall Street Journal\" stated that \"Mr. Nye makes an eloquent case for evolution.\" Regarding the debate and the book, \"Scientific American\" stated \"no matter your stance on whether Bill should have engaged in the original debate or not, this book is a very appropriate follow-up and a terrific gift idea for those who might need a primer in how science looks at the world.\"\n\nNye stated an upcoming revision of his book would contain a rewritten chapter on GMOs, which he now supports.\n"}
