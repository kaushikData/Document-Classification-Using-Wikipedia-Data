{"id": "47286955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47286955", "title": "Ancient Iranian religion", "text": "Ancient Iranian religion\n\nAncient Iranian religion refers to the ancient beliefs and practices of the Iranian peoples before the rise of Zoroastrianism.\n\nThe Iranian peoples emerged as a separate branch of the Indo-Iranians in the 2nd-millennium BC, during which they came to dominate the Eurasian Steppe and the Iranian Plateau. Their religion is derived from Proto-Indo-Iranian religion, and therefore shares many similarities with Vedic religion. Although the Iranian peoples left few written or material evidence of their religious practices, their religion is possible to reconstruct from scant Iranian, Babylonian and Greek accounts, similarities with Vedic and other Indo-European religions, and material evidence. Their religion was polytheistic and the chief god of their pantheon was Ahura Mazda, who was recognized as the creator of the world. They had a three-tiered division of the cosmos into the earth, the atmosphere and the heaven above. Dualism was strongly emphasized and human nature was considered essentially good. The chief ritual of the ancient Iranians was the yazna, in which the deities were praised and the mind-altering drug hauma was consumed. This ritual was performed by a highly trained priestly class. Fire was worshiped as the deity Atar. Politician and religion under the Persian Empires was strongly connected.\n\nBeginning in the early 10th-century BC, the ancient Iranian religion was gradually displaced by Zoroastrianism, which contains many essential aspects of its predecessor.\n\nThe sources on ancient Iranian religion, though limited, consist of textual and material sources. The textual sources are both Iranian and non-Iranian.\n\nAn important Iranian source is the Avesta, which are Zoroastrian sacred scriptures made in the Avestan. This is considered the principal source of knowledge on ancient Iranian religions. It is a collection of several texts that seems to have been over a large span of time by a variety of authors. These texts have been subjected to editings and redactions throughout their development. It is now the only extant fragment of what remained in the 9th century of the Avesta compiled in the Sasanian Empire by Khosrow I. Summaries of its content reveal that it was a huge collection containing texts not only in Avestan, but also in Pahlavi, which was the language of Zoroastrianism in the Sasanian Empire. Though the existing Avesta is dated quite recently, it contains information that is considerably older. The Gathas (\"Songs\") of the Prophet Zoroaster and much of the Yashts are considered among the oldest. The Gathas includes expressions of the religious vision of Zoroaster, which in many ways is a reinterpretation of the ancient Iranian religious principles. The Yashts are a collection of verses dedicated to various deities. These verses are mostly related to Zoroastrian terminology and ideas, but have little relation to anything specifically Zoroastrian. The gods invoked are basically the pre-Zoroastrian gods of the Iranian peoples. There is little agreement on when Zoroaster lived, but most scholars agree that he lived somewhere between 1200 and 600 BC. Dating the Yashts is similarly difficult, but it is likely that they were redacted (not necessarily composed) initially in the 5th-century BC.\n\nAnother Iranian source are royal inscriptions of the Achaemenid Empire made in the Old Persian (with Akkadian, Aramaic and Elamite translations). These inscriptions, in particular those of Darius I and his son Xerxes I, contain many references to religion. The fact that these are fixed in time and place make them particularly useful.\n\nExcept from the Achaemenid inscriptions, there is no evidence that the Iranian religious compositions were written until the late Parthian or Sassanid period. This makes ancient Iranian religion the only major religion of the Middle East which has no written texts in the ancient period. The religious information was rather oral both in composition and transmission.\n\nThe non-Iranian sources are mainly Greek. The most important Greek source is Herodotus. Some of the Greek information on ancient Iranian religion is however unreliable. This is either because it is based on outright wrong information or based on misunderstandings.\n\nThe historical reconstruction of ancient Vedic literature is also an important source. The earliest religious texts of the related Indo-Aryan peoples are indispensable for reconstructing the historical development of the ancient Iranian religion. The most important of these texts in this regard is the Rigveda. It is composed of more than 1,000 hymns dedicated to various deities. The Rigveda can be dated to the period between 1700 and 1100 BC.\n\nMaterial sources are rather limited and mostly confined to western Iran. The remains of Achaemenid architecture are the most important of these material sources. They provide a mass of evidence of imperial articulation of religious symbols and indicate a significant dependence on Middle Eastern precedents.\n\nDuring the second half of the 2nd millennium BC, one group of Indo-Europeans migrated southwards from the Eurasian Steppe into the Middle East, the Iranian plateau and the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. These were Indo-Iranians calling themselves Arya (\"nobles\"). Those that settled in the Near East and India are known as Indo-Aryan peoples, while those that settled in Greater Iran are known are Iranian peoples. Because of their common origin, Iranian and Indo-Aryan religion is substantially similar. Through a comparative study of both groups one can reconstruct general features of Iranian religion for which there is no direct documentation.\n\nThe Iranian peoples were originally seminomadic pastoralists whoe main economic base was cattle, chiefly bovines but also goats and sheep. They excelled at breeding horses, which they used for riding and pulling chariots in sport and warfare. Exactly how rigid their society was is difficult to determine. The Iranian peoples were specialists in religious matters. Men who could afford chariots and horses were recognized as leaders and warriors.\n\nBy the creation of the Achaemenid Empire, a more rigid division of society into priests, nobles, farmers and artisans had developed. Society was heavily patriarchal, which was strongly reflected in religion. As the Iranian peoples settled the land they became more engaged in agriculture and sedentary life. During this process they were influenced by the indigenous populations. The religions of these peoples are completely unknown except from the elements they have left Iranian religion which has no parallel with other Indo-European religions.\n\nThe ancient Iranians believed in a cosmos which was a three-tiered structure. This structure consisted of the earth, the atmosphere, and the heaven above. Beyond heaven was the realm of Endless Lights while below the earth lay the realm of darkness and chaos. The earth rested on a cosmic sea called the Varu-Karta. In the earths centre was cosmic mountain Hara. Down the Hara flowed the river Ardvi.\n\nThe earth divided into six continents surrounding the central continent. The central continent was Khvaniratha, the locus of Aryana Vajiah (land of the Aryans).\n\nNeither the Avesta or Achaemenid inscriptions have much to say about creation as they contain nothing that can be compared to the Babylonian Enûma Eliš or the first chapters of the Book of Genesis. What is rather emphasized is the majesty and power of Ahura Mazda as the creator of heaven and earth. Beside Ahura Mazda is the ancient Indo-Iranian god Thvarshtar (\"Artisan\"). Thvarstar also appears under the name Spenta Mainyu (\"the Beneficient Spirit\") in Zoroaster's system of the Beneficent Immortals. In the creative aspect Thvarshtar functions in many ways as Ahura Mazda. In the Younger Avesta Spenta and the Gathas Mainyu is paired with the evil antagonist Angra Mainyu (\"the Evil Spirit\", Ahriman in Middle Persian). In later sources it is Ohrmazd (Middle Persian for Ahura Mazda) who is paired with Ahriman. The Avesta contains cryptic allusions to the creations of two antagonistic spirits.\n\nIt is Plutarch (De Iside et Osiride 47), who conducts the first discursive exposition of world creation by two spirits. Plutarch describes the Persians as telling mythical tales about Oromazes (i. e., Ahura Mazda), who is born from light, and Areimanios (i. e., Ahriman), who is born from gloom, engaging in a war against each other. This dualistic idea of two primordial spirits, which Zoroaster calls twins, is an early Indo-European concept. Reconstruction indicates that primordial twins that existed before the creation of the world, came into conflict. One was named \"Man\" (Iranian *Manu', meaning \"man\"), the other was named \"Twin\" (Iranian Yama, Avestan Yima. After Man killed Yima he used his dismembered body to fashion the world. He used the flesh for the earth, the bones for the mountains, the skull for the sky, etc. In a different Iranian variant of the myth, Yama is the first mortal and the first ruler. His rule is described as a golden age in which there is no hot or cold, no death or old age, etc. When falsehood enters Yama's speech this golden age comes to an end. The royal Glory (Khvarnah) departs from Yama and seeks refuge in the cosmic sea. Azhi Dahaka (\"Dahaka the Snake\"), a serpentine tyrant, then overthrows Yama. His rule ushers in a period of chaos, drought and ruin. Azhi is later defeated by the hero Thraitauna. Thraitauna establishes the legendary line of rulers called Kavis.\n\nSince all sources on Iranian myths, both from indigenous texts and classical authors, originated after the emergence of Zoroastrianism, it is difficult to distinguish between myths that are Zoroastrian innovations from that those that are inherited. The fact that Zoroastrianism is heavily inspired by already existing ideas and has adapted from previous Iranian religions makes this discerning particularly hard. Like other ancient religions in general, Iranian religions did not have main collection of myth. Iranian myths are rather fragments from a diverse variety of myths that exhibit variations in common themes.\n\nThere is a variant of the Noah's Ark myth in Iranian religion. Here Yama appears as the herdsman and leader of mankind. Yama rules the world for a long time, during which the earth is increased threefold due to overcrowding. Ahura Mazda tells Yama that a great winter is on the horizon. He advises Yama to build a large three-story barn-like structure (vara) in order to hold seeds of plants and pairs of animals. It seems that the vara were actually some sort of paradise or blessed island, even though the story at first developed as myth among pastoralists about the culture hero building a first winter cattle station.\n\nZoroaster appears to have been the first religious figure to develop an eschatological myth about a future saviour to rescue the world from evil. This idea plays an important part in Zoroastrianism. It was probably also influential in introducing the concept of the messiah in exile Judaism.\n\nThe Iranian pantheon was similar to that of other Indo-European religions. It contained a large number of deities, primarily male. These deities personified natural phenomena, social norms or institutions. It seems that there were two major groups of deities, the daivas and the ahuras. Daiva, which means \"heavenly one\", is derived from the common Proto-Indo-European word for \"god\", which is the meaning it has in the Vedas. Among some Iranians and in Zoroastrianism the daivas were considered demons, but this view was not universal. The ahuras (\"lords\") were noble sovereign deities. They were contradicted with the bagha (\"the one who distributes\") and the yazata (\"the one who worshipped\").\n\nThe chief of the pantheon was Ahura Mazda (\"wise lord\"). He was particularly connected with the principle of social and cosmic order called asha in Avestan. Closely connected to him was the ahura Mithra. Mithra was the god who presided over the covenants. In Iranian religion there were two gods with martial trais similar to those of Vedic Indra, these were Mithra and Vrthraghna. The most prominent female deities were Spanta Aramati, the deity of the earth, and Ardvi Sura, the deity of the sacred river.\n\nAhura Mazda (\"Wise Lord\") was probably the main god in pantheon of the pre-Zoroastrian Iranians. In both the religion of Darius, Xerxes and Zoroaster, he was worshipped as the supreme god to the point that the rest were almost excluded. He is chiefly considered the creator of the universe and the one who maintains cosmic and social order, arta. In his inscriptions, Darius derives his source of authority from Ahura Mazda and makes it clear that political stability and order through law imitates the model set out by the Creator. Through interrogative discourse, an ancient Indo-European poetic device, Zoroaster asks: \"Who is the original father of arta? Who established the paths of the sun and the stars? Who is it through whom the moon now waxes now wanes? Who supports the earth below and (keeps) the heavens (above) from falling down? Who yokes the two steeds to the wind and the clouds?... Who fashioned honoured Devotion together with Dominion? Who made... a son respectful of his father?\"\n\nNeither the Avesta nor the Achaemenid instripctions identify Ahura Mazda with a natural phenomenon. In the hymn of the goddess Rti (Reward), Ahura Mazda is identified as her father and Spenta Ariamati (Earth) as her mother. This implies that he has assumed the role of the Indo-European Father Heaven (*Diēus Pater, Vedic Dyaus Pitar), who is paired with Mother Earth. Herodotus apparently makes this identification when stating that Zeus in Persian mythology \"is the whole circle of heavens\". Zeus is also equated with Oromazes (Ahura Mazda) in other Greek sources. These Greeks made this comparison because of Ahura Mazda’s role as father and chief god of the pantheon. His name implies that that he was sought by worshippers for his wisdom. Based on the expressions of Darius and Zoroaster, it is reasonable to assume that he was the object of a personal devotion which seems to have been absent with other deities.\n\nAlong with Ahura Mazda, Mithra was the most important deity in the ancient Iranian pantheon. He may have occupied a position almost equal to him. In the Achaemenid inscriptions, Mithra is along with Anahita the only deity specifically mentioned.\n\nIn the ancient Iranian pantheon there was an individual sun god called Hvar Khshaita. In the eastern Iranian traditions laid out in the Avesta, Mithra also appears to have a connection to the sun, especially with the first rays of sunrise as he drives forward in his chariot. In the western Iranian tradition Mithra was thoroughly associated with the sun and his name became the common word for \"sun\".\n\nDespite his connection to the sun Mithra function prominently in the ethical sphere. The word Mithra was a common noun meaning \"contract, covenant, treaty\". Mithra was thus the god of Covenant. In this respect he function as a celestial deity overseeing all solemn agreements made between people. Breaking such agreements was subjected to severe punishment whether the agreement were made between individuals or sociopolitical entities. As a covenant breaker, Mithra is described as sleepless and having 1,000 ears and 10,000 eyes. He is great warrior sporting a mace while driving his chariot into battle. In this capacity he intervenes on behalf of those faithful to treaties by subjecting the treaty breakers (mithra-drug) to panic and defeat.\n\nAs an independent deity, Mithra carried the standing epithet varu-gavyuti, which means \"one who (presides over) wide pasture lands\". Another of his epithets was payu, \"protector\". He is considered the one who protects the territories of those who worship him and abide by their promises.\n\nMithra is the god who gave his name to the religion of Mithraism, which was at one point popular throughout the Roman Empire. The Iranian origins of mithraism are difficult to trace.\n\nOne of the longest of the Avestan Yashts is devoted to a goddess whose name is given as Ardvi Sura Anahita, which means \"the damp, strong, untainted\". The long name apparently combines two separate names which originally belonged to two individual deities, Ardvi Sura and Anahiti. Ardvi Sura is the Iranian name for the heavenly river goddess who in the Rigveda is called Sarasvati. In this capacity she brings water to the earth, streams, rivers, and seas while flowing from Mount Hukarya to Varu-Karta sea. Anahiti on the other hand is a separate goddess of unknown origin whose cult appears to have been popular originally in northeastern Iran. The name probably meant “untaintedness, purity\". Here purity was meant both in moral and physical terms. The Greek Anaitis preserves the original Old Iranian form of this name, while the Old Persian and Avestan Anahit(a) is a more recent linguistic form. In post-Achaemenid Iran Anahiti was closely connected with kingship and the shah.\n\nThe Yashts describe Anahita in great detail, unlike any other deity. The descriptions about her clothing and ornamentation are so specific that it is likely the source of the description was a dressed cult image. This fact is confirmed in her mentioning by Artaxerses II. Berossus, a Babylonian historian, notes that the king had several images of her made and distributed. Since the Iranians did not originally make images, it is likely that the cult of Anahiti was inspired by Mesopotamian models. The Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar is a likely candidate in this regard, although Anahiti's dress, in particular her beaver coat, shows major differences. There were also major similarities in their roles. Ishtar was the patroness of the palace and goddess of war. Anahiti is described as a patron of Iranian heroes and legendary rulers and her Yasht is strongly devoted to her martial traits. Both goddesses were important for fertility.\n\nVrthraghna was the mighty deity of war. He had martial traits are similar to Mithra and the Vedic god of war Indra. In the post-Achaemenid period he was equated with Hercules and became a favourite deity of monarchs, many of whom took his name. His name means \"the smashing of resistance or obstruction\". In his capacity as the god who guaranteed his people to overcome all resistance, his name came to be understood as meaning \"Victory\".\n\nIn connection with rulership and granting victory, he held the epithet bara-khvarnah, which means \"Bearing the Glory.\" Like Mithra he is portrayed as the ideal warrior. For the earliest Iranian invaders of the Iranian plateau, he came to personify aspirations to acquire new territory from the native population. For later Iranians he became the divine manifestation for the will to conquer the world.\n\nIn the Iranian pantheon, Vrthraghna was the god who predominantly possessed the ability to undergo transformations, both anthropomorphic and theriomorphic. Though rich mythologies are believed to have existed for these avatars, only 10 forms have been recorded. These are:\n\nThe avatars of Vrthraghna all had a fellow aggressiveness and virility. In some violence is conspicuous. Descriptions of these avatars can be particularly graphic.\n\nRashnu was an ethical deity, a divine judge who presided over the legal disputes of humans. He was often associated with Mithra. The name of Rashnu is derived from the Indo-European verb, *reg (\"to be, make straight, direct, judge\"). In particular he seems to have been the god of oaths and ordeals administered in trials. In several ways he was responsible for the same judicial functions as the Vedic god Varuna, who was the ultimate judge presiding over oaths, often inseparable from the Vedic Mitra.\n\nWhile it is uncertain whether Ahura Mazda had any judicial responsibilities, Rashnu and Mithra were connected with two separate areas of law. While Mithra was concerned with covenants, Rashnu mainly had jurisdiction of legal matters, in particular those of criminal nature. He was invoked as the god who \"best smite(s), who best destroy(s) the thief and the bandit at this trial.\"\n\nAstral deities figured more prominently in ancient Iranian religion than Vedic religion. This may be explained with the influence of Babylonian science on the Iranians, in particular the western groups. In the Avesta stars and constellations such as Ursa Major, the Pleiades, Vega, Fomalhaut and the Milky Way are mentioned. The most important astral deities seem to have been Tiri and Tishtrya.\n\nFor reasons that are unknown, Tishtrya is associated with the star Sirius in one Yasht that is entirely devoted to her. Though the heliacal rising of Sirius is assumed to have occurred during the season of drought, his chief myth concerns a battle between him and the demonic star Apausha (\"Nonprosperity\") over rainfall and water. In a battle taking place along the shores of Varu-Karta, Tishtrya and Apausha battled each other while assuming the forms of a white stallion and an ugly horse. Though Apausha is initially victorious, Tishtrya eventually prevails after receiving worship, driving Apausha \"along a path the length of a race course.\" This combat was reenacted by the Iranians in a yearly equestrian ritual. After assuming victory Tishtrya causes the cosmic sea to boil and surge. Then another star, Satavaisa (Formelhaut), arises with cloud-forming mists. These mists are blown by the wind in the form of \"rain and clouds and hail to the dwelling and the settlements (and) to the seven continents.\"\n\nTishtrya was considered to contain the seeds of waters and was thus closely connected with agriculture. He defeated shooting stars identified as witches, in particular one named \"Bad Crop\" (Duzhyāryā). In Zoroastrianism Tishrya was in late Achaemenid times identified with the western Astral deity Tiri (Mercury in Sassanid astronomy). Little is known about Tiri except from the highly important agricultural festival, the Tiragan. The fourth month, (Tir, Avestan Tishtryaeninis), and the 13th day (Tir) of the Zoroastrian calendar, bears this name.\n\nIn sharp contrast to other people of the Middle East, the Iranians neither made images of their deities or built temples to house them. They preferred to worship their gods in the open. The ancient Iranians practiced a sacrificial ritual yazna. In this ritual fire and the sacred drink hauma played a key part. The chief officiant at this sacrifice was the zautar.\n\nWorship was mainly performed through the central ritual yazna. This ritual corresponds in many regards with the Vedic yajna. Despite changes undergone through the millennia, these rituals are still performed by Zoroastrians and Hindus. It is probably the oldest continuously enacted ritual in the world. As far as yazna can be reconstructed, it was basically a highly elaborate festive meal offered to a guest. In this ritual the sacrificer was the host and the deity the guest. While yazna is a daily ritual in Zoroastrianism, its frequency among the early Iranians is not precisely known. Yazna was held to into communion a divine. This was either for a specific purpose, for example to secure victory in war, to express piety or to secure general welfare. Yazna followed the general rules of hospitality. A guest was sent by invitation. Upon arrival he received a warm greeting and was shown to a comfortable seat. There he was given meat and drink while entertained with songs praising his deeds and virtues. The guest was expected to return the hospitality with a gift.\n\nThe seat provided for the gods invited to yazna originally consisted of special grasses spread on the ground in front of the altar. In Vedic terminology this was called the barhish (Avestan barzish, \"cushion\"). The Avestan word barəsman (Iranian barzman), used in Zoroastrianism, is a cognate of this word. It is used for a bundle of sticks, later thin metal rods, that are manipulated by priests.\n\nOf bigger importance than the offering of meat was the preparation of the divine drink hauma. Like fire, hauma was considered both sacred and as a deity. The most important part of yazna was probably the preparation of hauma. Despite numerous proposals, the plant whose juices were extracted to prepare hauma has not been identified. The word hauma is derived from a verb \"to press, extract\". It thus literally means the juice which has been pressed out of the whatever plant that has been used. While making hauma the stalks were first soaked in water and then pounded. While Zoroastrians did this with metal mortar and pestle, the early Iranians pounded the stalks between two pressing stones. The juice was filtered and mixed with milk to reduce the bitter taste. It was also possibly mixed with water. Hauma was described as yellow. The drink was then consumed immediately. Though it was not alcoholic it was rather a mind-altering drug. According to the Yasht to Hauma: \"All other intoxicants are accompanied by Wrath with the horrible club, but that intoxication which is Hauma’s is accompanied by gladdening Truth (arta).\" This minor statement can be extended with more informative descriptions in the Rigveda. In the Rigveda soma was not only offered to gods, but also consumed by poets to increase their power in their search for truth. Hauma was also drunk as a stimulant by warriors before going into battle. Many heroes of Iranian mythology are remembered for having practiced this cult.\n\nIt is probable that yasna from a very early period was carried out by a priest, the zautar (Vedic hotar). The zautar was probably assisted by several other ritual specialists. With the priests acting through the sacrificer, the gods were invoked through fire. When the god arrived he was placed at the barzman, served parts of the slaughtered victim as food, served a drink and entertained with song. In turn the sacrificer would request a gift, usually in the form of heroic songs, good health or victory. In many ways the ritual can be compared with the old Latin dictum do ut des (\"I give so that you may give\"), in the sense that it was meant to provide a means of inducing the deities to act in favor of humans. In addition it made a communion between the divine and human realms possible. Deities could also be addressed directly through prayer. In this case the supplicant would be standing erect with upraised arms. Prostration was not known.\n\nFire was of supreme importance in Iranian rituals. In ancient Iran, fire was considered a deity and highly sacred element. As a result, atar was denoted both \"fire and \"Fire\". Every instance of fire was considered a manifestation of a deity. Because burned offerings were not not made, Atar's role was mainly that of an intermediary between heaven and earth and between humans and gods. This is similar to his Vedic counterpart Agni. Beyond yazna, fire was carefully treated as a sacred element. Whether in households, or later, in fire temples, fire was maintained with proper fuel, protected from polluting agents, and most importantly never extinguished.\n\nThe song of praise to the divine guest was a major importance. Almost all of the Rigveda and much of the poetic portions of the Avesta must be understood in this context. This means that the ancient poetry of the Indo-Iranians was religious in nature and composed specifically for ritual occasions in which gods required songs of praise in order to make them well disposed towards those who worshipped them.\n\nThe obscure parts of many Vedic hymns and Zoroaster's Gathas can best be understood through realizing that the intended audience were the gods rather than humans.\n\nThe Iranians celebrated various festivals throughout the year. These were mostly related to agricultural and herding cycles. The most important of these was that of New Year, which is still celebrated by Iranian peoples.\n\nLike with other ancient religions, the cosmological dichotomy of chaos and cosmos played an important part of both myth and worldview. The most important and unique aspect of ancient Iranian religion was the development of dualism. This was mainly expressed in opposition between truth (arta) and falsehood (drug, drauga). While originally confined to the conflict between social order and social disorder, this dualistic worldview came to affect all aspects of life. The pantheon became divided between gods and demons. Under the influence of the Magi, who were members of a priestly Median tribe, the animal kingdom became divided into two classes. There were beneficent animals and noxious creatures.\n\nDualism even permeated the vocabulary. \"ahuric\" and \"daivic\" words for developed for such things as body parts. For example, the word zasta and gava became used for the hands of a righteous and evil person, respectively. This was however not a gnostic system like the ones that flourished in the Middle East in the Common Era. This was because there was no myth of evil being created through the corruption of a spiritual being.\n\nIn the Zoroastrian myth of creation, humans are created for the purpose of repulsing the Evil Spirit. Although is uncertain whether this is a pre-Zoroastrian concept, it shows in that in Iranian religion human nature was considered essentially good. This is contrary to the myths about the baseness of human condition found in Babylonian mythology, for example in Enûma Eliš. In Iranian religious thought humans had free will and were able for determine their own destinies through their ethical choices.\n\nIn addition to the body (tanu), an individual was believed to consist of a number of spiritual elements that basically fall under the category of souls. These were:\nIn Zoroastrianism, belief in the Day of Judgement was a central aspect. Zoroastrianism considers the ruvan to be accountable for a person's actions in life. It is therefore the ruvan which receives reward or punishment in the afterlife. At the time of judgement, the ruvan is encountered by the daina. The daina embodies the sums of a persons deeds in life, and is manifested as either a beautiful maiden or an ugly old woman. Depending on how the persons deeds are weighed, the soul is either crossed safely across the Cinvat Bridge to the other world or descends into the abyss.\n\nThe fravarti is a deity which functions as a protective spirit for an individual. It is also an ancestor spirit. The fravartis constitute a warrior band, quite similar to the Vedic Maruts.\n\nApart from the legendary kings of eastern Iran, the Kavis, of whom Zoroaster's patron Vishtaspa (Hystapes) was the last, the only historical information about the relationship between religious and political authority come from the Achaemeneid period in western Iran. The ideology of kingship was closely connected to Ahura Mazda,a the supreme deity. The kings ruled through his will. Achaemenid kings were compelled to contend with the Median priests, known as magi. The origin of the magi is unclear. According to classical sources they were responsible for presiding over religious ceremonies and chanting \"theogonies\".\n\nThe magi were also deeply involved in politics. This can be seen by the attempt of the magus Gaumata to usurp the throne after the death of Cambyses II. Darius persecuted the magi, but they were able to preserve their power and eventually become the official priesthood of the Achaemenid Empire. The magi were probably responsible with introducing dualist ideology and enforcing zealous preoccupation with ritual purity in Zoroastrianism. They are also famous throughout the ancient world for their ability to perform magic.\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1960 by Lavy Becker, who served as volunteer rabbi. Ron Aigen was hired as the congregation's first paid rabbi in 1976, and Heather Batchelor was hired as the first cantor in 2009.\n\nDorshei Emet constructed its first synagogue building in 1967. The congregation soon outgrew this structure, and built a larger one on the same site in 2003.\n\n, Dorshei Emet had close to 500 member households. It was the only Reconstructionist synagogue in Quebec, and the oldest in Canada.\n\nThe Reconstructionist movement's first congregation in Canada was founded in 1960 as the Reconstructionist Synagogue of Montreal by Rabbi Lavy Becker, in time for the High Holy Days. Born in 1905 in Montreal, Becker attended high school in Montreal, and studied Talmud at Yeshiva College (today Yeshiva University) in New York. He graduated from McGill University with a B.A. in 1926, and in 1930 was ordained at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, where he was strongly influenced by Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, the creator of Reconstructionist Judaism.\n\nBecker was the driving force behind a number of synagogues; he had previously helped found the Orthodox Young Israel of Montreal (in 1921), and been the founding rabbi of the Conservative Congregation Beth-El in Mount Royal, Quebec (in 1951). He also helped organize Toronto's first Reconstructionist synagogue, Congregation Darchei Noam, in 1962, and Plantation, Florida's Ramat Shalom Reconstructionist congregation in 1975.\n\nThe Reconstructionist Synagogue of Montreal originally resembled a \"chavurah\", and worshiped in a number of different locations. The synagogue's Torah scrolls came from Egypt, Morocco and Trinidad; Becker was instrumental in acquiring them.\n\nIn 1964, the congregation acquired land on Cleve Road in Hampstead, and began construction of its first building there. The \"habitant-style\" building was completed in 1967, and officially opened by Kaplan during a Reconstructionist convention in Montreal in the spring that year. The building was a one-story structure comprising a sanctuary, some offices, and a small kitchen, and had no basement. It featured stained glass windows by David Ascalon.\n\nThe congregation adopted the name Congregation Dorshei Emet in the late 1970s, though it was still also known as \"the Reconstructionist Synagogue of Montreal\". Ron Aigen was hired as the congregation's first paid rabbi in 1976. That year the congregation, which had under 180 member families, added an extension to its building.\n\nBecker led the congregation as rabbi until 1976 or 1977. His role as rabbi at Dorshei Emet was unpaid, and while serving there he had also served in a number of other roles, including on the executive of the Canadian Jewish Congress and the World Jewish Congress, as president of the Jewish Reconstructionist Federation, and as chairman of the Board of Overseers of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College.\n\nDorshei Emet began accepting non-Jewish partners of members as a \"gerei toshav\" in 1985. Its 1994 constitution, however, clarified that while a non-Jewish spouse of a member was considered a \"ger toshav\", and \"may be welcomed into the synagogue\", he or she was not \"entitled to membership in the congregation\". In 1993 the congregation resolved that \"gay and lesbian Jews, their Jewish partners and families\" would be welcome \"as full members of our congregation\". The synagogue's currently policy regarding non-Jews and marriage is that while the children of mixed marriages may participate in lifecycle events, including Bar and Bat Mitzvah ceremonies, the rabbi will only marry couples (whether opposite or same-sex) if both partners are Jewish. With the hiring of Rabbi Boris Dolin, the congregation is currently undergoing a community discussion about whether the rabbi can officiate at interfaith marriages. \n\nBy 1994, membership exceeded 410 households. The congregation's growth made it impossible for all members to worship together; the original synagogue building had been sized for no more than 150 families. On the High Holy Days, when around 600 people attended (versus 150 on a typical Shabbat), services were split between the sanctuary and a school auditorium/gymnasium. In 1992, the congregation voted against expanding the building, but after the 1995 Quebec sovereignty referendum members felt more confident in Quebec's political situation and economy. In 1999, Aigen led the congregation in a campaign to construct a new building. The property next to the existing building was purchased to accommodate a larger structure, and the existing sanctuary was torn down. While the new synagogue was under construction, the congregation worshiped and held activities at the YM-YWHA. The new building was open in time for the 2003 High Holy Days.\n\nThe architect was Dorshei Emet member Roseanne Moss of the firm Fournier Gersovitz Moss et associés architectes. The new building's exterior was in the form of an unornamented rectangular solid. It was approximately twice the size of the old one, and had a social hall, library, larger kitchen, and more office space.\n\nThe stained glass windows from the old building were installed in the new sanctuary, which one entered through a copper door. Additional stained glass windows were created by Montreal's Studio du Verre in 2005.\n\nThe stained glass windows are heavily oriented towards abstract forms. Together with the Torah ark, they form the figure of a geometrical seven-branched candelabrum or menorah. The other sanctuary walls are pale beige and extremely simple in comparison. During the day, the interior is illuminated by natural light entering through the translucent walls overhead. At night, the entire building glows from interior artificial lighting.\n\nSound damping and acoustics for the sanctuary was done by MJM Conseillers en Acoustique/MJM Acoustical Consultants. In accordance with Reconstructionist Judaism's view of Judaism as an evolving civilization, Dorshei Emet supports Jewish culture and artistic achievement, and the sanctuary is used not only for worship, but also for Jewish cultural and musical events.\n\nIn May 2009, Dorshei Emet commissioned female scribe Jen Taylor Friedman to write a new Torah scroll, in honor of the congregation's 50th anniversary. Dorshei Emet is the first synagogue in Canada and the third in the world to receive a Torah handwritten by a woman; Friedman–then the only woman to have completed a Torah scroll–had previously written two others. The Torah was completed on May 16, 2010.\n\nThe congregation hired its first cantor, Heather Batchelor, in August 2010. Because Dorshei Emet had no tradition of cantorial singing, her role was not typical. In addition to leading Rosh Hashanah and some regular services, she ran children's programs and occasionally read from the Torah. In addition, she started a Friday night service at Dorshei Emet, something it had not had before.\n\nDorshei Emet was one of six Jewish institutions in Montreal that were attacked on the night of January 15, 2011. The other buildings, all in Côte Saint-Luc, consisted of four synagogues and a school.\n\nSince its founding, men and women have had identical roles at Dorshei Emet. According to Aigen, the synagogue \"is an egalitarian, participatory community of Jews where women have always been equal players and full participants in Jewish ritual life, including reading from the Torah\".\n\n, Dorshei Emet had close to 500 member households. It is one of only three Reconstructionist congregations in Canada (the others were in Toronto and Ottawa). Starting in 2015, the congregation began a visioning process to begin a search for a new full-time rabbi to replace Rabbi Aigen after his retirement in 2016. In early 2016, Rabbi Boris Dolin, a Reconstructionist rabbi from Oregon was chosen from among 27 candidates to be the next full-time rabbi. Before joining the Dorshei Emet community, Rabbi Dolin was the rabbi of Beit Polska, the Union of Progressive Congregations in Poland, and Beit Warszawa, a progressive congregation in Warsaw. \n\nOnly a few weeks before his planned retirement Rabbi Aigen died of a massive stroke, which came as a shock to the community just as they were preparing to celebrate his 40 years of serving the community. \n\nThe rabbi of Congregation Dorshei Emet is Boris Dolin.\nBased at Dorshei Emet Synagogue, the Emet Gallery present exhibitions of photography and multimedia art presented \"through the Jewish lens\". Exhibitions have included:\n\n\nSince September 2008 the Emet Gallery has also been running \"The Hemshekh Project\", which gathers oral histories and images from community members in order to create oral traditions for future generations.\n\n"}

Chinese proponents preferred the title \"Wéishí\" (), meaning \"Consciousness Only\" (Sanskrit \"Vijñaptimātra\").\n\nThis school may also be called \"Wéishí Yújiāxíng Pài\" ( \"Consciousness-Only Yogācāra School\") or \"Yǒu Zōng\" ( \"School of Existence\"). Yin Shun also introduced a threefold classification for Buddhist teachings which designates this school as \"Xūwàng Wéishí Xì\" ( \"False Imagination Mere Consciousness System\").\n\nLike the parent Yogācāra school, the Faxiang school teaches that our understanding of reality comes from our own mind, rather than actual empirical experience. The mind distorts reality and projects it as reality itself. In keeping with Yogācāra tradition, the mind is divided into the Eight Consciousnesses and the Four Aspects of Cognition, which produce what we view as reality.\n\nFaxiang Buddhism also maintained the Five Natures Doctrine () which brought it into doctrinal conflict with the Tiantai school in China.\n\nTranslations of Indian Yogācāra texts were first introduced to China in the early fifth century. Among these was Guṇabhadra's translation of the \"Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra\" in four fascicles, which would also become important in the early history of Chan Buddhism.\n\nDuring the sixth century CE, the Indian monk and translator Paramārtha widely propagated Yogācāra teachings in China. His translations include the \"Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra\", the \"Madhyāntavibhāga-kārikā\", the \"Triṃśikā-vijñaptimātratā\", and the \"Mahāyānasaṃgraha\". Paramārtha also taught widely on the principles of Consciousness Only, and developed a large following in southern China. Many monks and laypeople traveled long distances to hear his teachings, especially those on the \"Mahāyānasaṃgraha\".\n\nAlthough Yogācāra teachings had been propagated widely, most look to Xuanzang as the most important founder of East Asian Yogācāra. At the age of 33, Xuanzang made a dangerous journey to India in order to study Buddhism there and to procure Buddhist texts for translation into Chinese. This journey was later the subject of legend and eventually fictionalized as the classic Chinese novel \"Journey to the West\", a major component of East Asian popular culture from Chinese opera to Japanese television (\"Monkey Magic\"). Xuanzang spent over ten years in India traveling and studying under various Buddhist masters. These masters included Śīlabhadra, the abbot of the Nālandā Mahāvihāra, who was then 106 years old. Xuanzang was tutored in the Yogācāra teachings by Śīlabhadra for several years at Nālandā. Upon his return from India, Xuanzang brought with him a wagon-load of Buddhist texts, including important Yogācāra works such as the \"Yogācārabhūmi-śastra\". In total, Xuanzang had procured 657 Buddhist texts from India. Upon his return to China, he was given government support and many assistants for the purpose of translating these texts into Chinese.\n\nAs an important contribution to East Asian Yogācāra, Xuanzang composed the treatise \"Cheng Weishi Lun\", or \"Discourse on the Establishment of Consciousness Only.\" This work is framed around Vasubandhu's \"Triṃśikā-vijñaptimātratā\", or \"Thirty Verses on Consciousness Only.\" Xuanzang upheld Dharmapala of Nalanda's commentary on this work as being the correct one, and provided his own explanations of these as well as other views in the \"Cheng Weishi Lun\". This work was composed at the behest of Xuanzang's disciple Kuiji, and became a central representation of East Asian Yogācāra. Xuanzang also promoted devotional meditative practices toward Maitreya Bodhisattva. Xuanzang's disciple Kuiji wrote a number of important commentaries on the Yogācāra texts and further developed the influence of this doctrine in China, and was recognized by later adherents as the first true patriarch of the school.\n\nIn time, Chinese Yogācāra was weakened due to competition with other Chinese Buddhist traditions such as Tiantai, Huayan, Chan and Pure Land Buddhism. Nevertheless, it continued to exert an influence, and Chinese Buddhists relied on its translations, commentaries, and concepts heavily, absorbing Yogācāra teachings into the other traditions.\n\nYogācāra teachings and concepts remained popular in Chinese Buddhism, including visions of the bodhisattva Maitreya and teachings given from him in Tuṣita, usually observed by advanced meditators. One such example is that of Hanshan Deqing during the Ming dynasty. In his autobiography, Hanshan describes the palace of Maitreya in Tuṣita, and hearing a lecture given by Maitreya to a large group of his disciples.\n\nHanshan recalls the teaching given as the following:\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, the laymen Yang Wenhui and Ouyang Jian () (1871–1943) promoted Buddhist learning in China, and the general trend was for an increase in studies of Buddhist traditions such as Yogācāra, Sanlun, and Huayan. In his 1929 book on the history of Chinese Buddhism, Jiang Weiqiao wrote:\n\nOuyang Jian founded the Chinese Institute of Inner Studies (), which provided education in Yogācāra teachings and the Mahāyāna prajñā class of sūtras, given to both monastics and laypeople. Many modern Chinese Buddhist scholars are second-generation descendants of this school or have been influenced by it indirectly.\n\nThe Consciousness-Only teachings were transmitted to Japan as \"Hossō\", and they made considerable impact. One of the founders of the Hossō sect in Japan was Kuiji. Although a relatively small Hossō sect exists in Japan to this day, the sect has survived long after it died out in Korea and China, though its influence has diminished as the center of Buddhist authority moved away from Nara, and with the rise of the Ekayāna schools of Buddhism. During its height, scholars of the Hossō school frequently debated with other emerging schools. Both the founder of Shingon Buddhism, Kūkai, and the founder of Tendai, Saichō, exchanged letters of debate with Hossō scholar Tokuitsu, which became particularly heated in the case of Saichō. Nevertheless, the Hossō maintained amicable relations with the Shingon esoteric sect, and adopted its practices while providing further scholarship on Yogacara philosophy.\n\nHōnen, founder of the Jōdo-shū Pure Land sect, likewise sought advice from Hossō scholars of his time as a novice monk, and later debated with them after establishing his sect. Another Hossō scholar, Jōkei was among Hōnen's toughest critics, and frequently sought to refute his teachings, while simultaneously striving, as Hōnen did, to make Buddhism accessible to a wider audience by reviving devotion to the bodhisattva Maitreya and teaching followers the benefits of rebirth in the Tuṣita rather than the pure land of Amitābha. Jōkei is also a leading figure in the efforts to revive monastic discipline at places like Tōshōdai-ji, Kōfuku-ji and counted other notable monks among his disciples, including Eison, who founded the Shingon Risshu sect.\n\nDuring the Meiji period, as tourism became more common, the Hossō sect was the owner of several famous temples, notably Hōryū-ji and Kiyomizu-dera. However, as the Hossō sect had ceased Buddhist study centuries prior, the head priests were not content with giving part of their tourism income to the sect's organization. Following the end of World War II, the owners of these popular temples broke away from the Hossō sect, in 1950 and 1965, respectively. The sect still maintains Kōfuku-ji and Yakushi-ji.\n\nEast Asian Yogācāra () were transmitted to Korea. The most well-known Korean figure of Beopsang was Woncheuk, who studied under the Chinese monk Xuanzang. Woncheuk is well known amongst scholars of Tibetan Buddhism for his commentary on the \"Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra\". While in China, Woncheuk took as a disciple a Korean-born monk named Dojeung (), who travelled to Silla in 692 and propounded and propagated Woncheuk's exegetical tradition there where it flourished.\n\nIn Korea, Beopsang teachings did not endure long as a distinct school, but as with China, its teachings were frequently included in later schools of thought.\n\n"}

The most significant orders of friars are the Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians and Carmelites.\n\nFriars are different from monks in that they are called to live the evangelical counsels (vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience) in service to society, rather than through cloistered asceticism and devotion. Whereas monks live in a self-sufficient community, friars work among laypeople and are supported by donations or other charitable support. A monk or nun makes their vows and commits to a particular community in a particular place. Friars commit to a community spread across a wider geographical area known as a province, and so they will typically move around, spending time in different houses of the community within their province.\n\nThe English term \"Friar\" is derived from the Norman French word \"free\" (\"brethren\"), from the Latin \"frater\" (\"brother\"), which was widely used in the Latin New Testament to refer to members of the Christian community. \"Fray\" is sometimes used in Spain and former Spanish colonies such as the Philippines or the American Southwest as a title, such as in Fray Juan de Torquemada.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, there are two classes of orders known as friars, or mendicant orders: the four \"great orders\" and the so-called \"lesser orders\".\n\nThe four great orders were mentioned by the Second Council of Lyons (1274):\n\n\n\nSome of the lesser orders are: \n\nOrders of friars (and sisters) exist in other Christian traditions, including the Order of Lutheran Franciscans, the Order of Ecumenical Franciscans and the Order of Lesser Sisters and Brothers.

A Roman Catholic with monarchist leanings, he was critical of bourgeois thought and was opposed to what he identified as defeatism. He believed this had led to France's defeat and eventual occupation by Germany in 1940 during World War II. Most of his novels have been translated into English and frequently published in both Great Britain and the United States.\n\nBernanos was born in Paris, into a family of craftsmen. He spent much of his childhood in the village of Fressin, Pas de Calais region, which became a frequent setting for his novels. He served in the First World War as a soldier, where he fought in the battles of the Somme and Verdun. He was wounded several times.\n\nAfter the war, he worked in insurance before writing \"Sous le soleil de Satan\" (1926, \"Under the Sun of Satan\").\n\nDespite his Royalist leanings and his membership in Action Française's youth organization), until 1932, Bernanos despised Fascism, which he described as \"disgustingly monstrous\" well before World War II broke out in Europe. He won the Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française for \"The Diary of a Country Priest\" (\"Journal d'un curé de campagne\"), published in 1936.\n\nHe initially supported Francisco Franco and the Falange at the outset of the Spanish Civil War. However, after he observed the conflict in Majorca and saw 'a terrorized people,' he became disgusted with the \"nacionales\" and criticized them in the book \"Diary of My Times\" (1938). He wrote, \"My illusions regarding the enterprise of General Franco did not last long - two or three weeks - but while they lasted I conscientiously endeavoured to overcome the disgust which some of his men and means caused me.\" Most of his important fictional works were written between 1926 and 1937.\n\nWith political tensions rising in Europe, Bernanos emigrated to South America with his family in 1938, settling in Brazil. He remained until 1945 in Barbacena, State of Minas Gerais, where he tried his hand at managing a farm. His three sons returned to France to fight after World War II broke out, while he fulminated at his country's 'spiritual exhaustion,' which he saw as the root of its collapse in 1940. From exile he mocked the 'ridiculous' Vichy regime and became a strong supporter of the nationalist Free French Forces led by the conservative Charles De Gaulle.\n\nAfter France's Liberation, De Gaulle invited Bernanos to return to his homeland, offering him a post in the government.

Govardhan Hill holds a unique position in Hindu Mythology related to Krishna, the land called Vrij where He was born. Known as Govardhan or Giriraj and being the sacred center of Braj, it is identified as a natural form of Krishna. Indian art overwhelmingly prefers the iconic image, but some aniconism does occur in folk worship, early Buddhism, Shiva's Banalinga, and Vishnu's Saligrama Sila (murthi)). They have solar significance, and their use in worship predates the Hindu period in India. The stone is usually brown in color.\n\nGovardhan, a very famous place of Hindu pilgrimage, is located 26 km west of Mathura (154 km from New Delhi) on the state highway to Deeg. Govardhan is located on a narrow sandstone hill known as Giriraj which is about 8 km in length.\nWhen Chaitanya Mahaprabhu did parikrama (circumambulation) of Govardhana Hill while visiting Vrindavana in 1515 AD, he did not walk on the hill because he considered Govardhana as non-different from Lord Krishna. Therefore, traditionally Vaishnavas don’t step on Govardhan hill.\n\nIt is believed that thousands of years ago, Lord Krishna picked up this hill and held it above His head, with his little finger, for 7 days to protect his kinsfolk from the wrath of rain God Indra. This gave Krishna the epithet Govardhandhari. Since Lord Krishna declared that He and Govardhan Hill were non-different, the followers of the Vallabha_Acharya tradition, devotees of Lord Krishna, worship Govardhan Sila. They worship Govardhana-silas along with the Saligrama sila, both considered as aniconic symbols of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, exactly as they worship the Deity of Krishna in the temple. Lifting of Govardhan Hill,Krishna's Lifting Govardhan Hill,Giriraj Govardhan Puja,Krishna Lifting Govardhan Hill,Sri Giriraj Govardhan Puja. \nEnglish translation of the relevant texts on Govardahan Hill from Srimad Bhagvatam state:\n\n\"Krishna assumed a great transcendental form and declared to the inhabitants of Vrindavana that He was Himself Govardhana Hill in order to convince the devotees that Govardhana Hill and Krishna are identical. The identity of Krishna and Govardhana Hill is still honored, and great devotees take rocks from Govardhan Hill, and worship them exactly as they worship the Deity of Krishna in the temple.” (Srimad Bhagavatam 10.24.35 purport)\"\n\n\"Of all the devotees, this Govardhana Hill is the best! O my friends, this hill supplies Krishna and Balarama, along with Their calves, cows and cowherd friends, will all kinds of necessities—water for drinking, very soft grass, caves, fruits, flowers and vegetables. In this way the hill offers respects to the Lord. Being touched by the lotus feet of Krishna and Balarama, Govardhana Hill appears very jubilant.” (Srimad Bhagavatam 10.21.18).\"\n\nPresently at its highest point, the Govardhan hill is just 25m (80 feet) high and is a wide hill. It is a narrow sandstone hill known as Giriraj which is about 8 km in length.\n\nAfter Krishna protected the inhabitants of Vraj (Vridavan) from the wrath of Indra, he counseled them to worship Govardhana hill and they did by way of a Puja and a Parikrama (circumambulation) around the hill.Thus, a festival in commemoration of the lifting of Mount Govardhan, near Mathura, by Krishna came into vogue as Govardhan Puja when Mount Govardhan is worshipped day after Deepawali (festival of lights) is celebrated. Pious people keep awake the whole night and cook fifty-six (or 108) different types of food for the bhog (the offering of food) to Krishna. This ceremony is called ankut or annakuta which means a mountain of food. Various types of food – cereals, pulses, fruit, vegetables, chutneys, pickles, and salads – are offered to the Deity and then distributed as prasada to devotees. Thousands of devotees bring offerings for Giriraj. Followed by this pooja, the devotees perform the Govardhana parikrama.\n\nA Parikrama [circumambulation- going 38 km {24-miles} around the hill] is a sacred ritual called Govardana parikrama performed by many believers. There is no time limit for performing Govardhana parikrama, but for those who perform the dandavata (full prostration) Parikrama, an arduous form which may take weeks and sometimes even months to complete. It is performed by standing in one spot, offering obeisances like a stick (danda) by lying flat on the ground and then continuing, contiguously, till the entire route is covered. It is also said that some sadhus (Hindu holy men) perform 108 dandavata Parikrama by offering 108 obeisances in one spot before moving to the next. This can take a number of months to complete. \n\nThis ritual of circumambulation is considered to be even better if is it done with milk. A clay pot filled with milk, with a hole at the bottom, is carried by the devotees in one hand and a pot filled with dhoop (incense smoke) in another. An escort continuously fills up the pot with milk till the circumambulation is completed. Circumambulation is also done with candy being handed out to children, en route.\n\nParikrama of Govardhana starts at the Manasi-Ganga Kund (lake) and then after having darsan of Lord Harideva, from Radha-kunda village, where the Vrindavan road meets the parikrama path. After parikrama of 38 km, covering important tanks, shilas and shrines such as Radha Kunda, Syama Kunda, Dan Ghati, Mukharavinda, Rinamochana Kunda, Kusuma Sarovara and Punchari, it ends at Mansi Ganga Kund only.\n\nIn Govinda-lilamrita, Krishnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami states that Govardhana Hill is shaped like a peacock and that Radha Kunda and Syama Kunda are its eyes. Dan Ghati and Manasi Ganga are its long neck. Mukharavinda is the mouth, Kusuma Sarovara its face, and Punchari is its back and tail feathers. A peacock often curves its neck and puts his head under its stomach. Govardhana Hill is thus shaped in this pose of a peacock.\n\nFollowers of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu worship Krishna in a small stone form (Govardhana sila) representing Mount Govardhan, with a gunja mala (garland) around it representing Radharani. It is said that the child Krishna was inseparable from his favourite gunja maala which was said to represent Radha. This mythology has made the Gunjā (Abrus precatorius) seeds - the bright red seed of a fig tree - also a favourite for native jewellery. \n\nThe only other God who shows a twig with a gunja seed on his upturned right hand palm to indicate the divya ksehtra’s superiority over Kashi (Varanasi) is Lord Narasimha, in the Gunja Narasimha Swamy temple locaterd at T.Narsipur in Mysore district in Karnataka on the bank of the Kaveri - Kapila - Spatika Sarovar sangam (confluence).\n\n"}

He is also considered the father of modern Punjabi prose and received Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, New Delhi in 1971.\n\nArmed with an engineering degree from the \"Thomson Engineering College\", now the IIT Roorkee, he also studied Civil Engineering at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.\n\nGurbakhsh Singh established \"Preet Nagar\" township that was equidistant between Amritsar and Lahore. Gurbaksh Singh Preetlari, through his personal charisma, brought people like Balraj Sahni, Nanak Singh, celebrity artist [Sobha Singh (painter)] and Diwan Singh, father of Lt Gen Jagjit Singh Arora of Bangladesh war fame, apart from associating Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Sahir Ludhianvi, Upendra Nath Ashq and Kartar Singh Duggal,playwright Balwant Gargi, poets Mohan Singh and Amrita Pritam: the best talent of the time — with Preet Nagar. The great martyr Diwan Singh Kalepani,the great intellectual Principal Teja Singh,principal Jodh Singh were closely associated.\nGandhiji was to visit here and Nehru did. Tagore was aware of it. Mulkh Raj Anand, a renowned writer in English, said that Tagore's legacy was carried forward by four in India, and counts Gurbakhsh Singh as one of these.\n\nHe brought great solace and a sense of adventure to the just about upcoming middle class and would-be professionals, through his writings in the journal he founded in 1933,'This journal, PREETLARI or LINKED(THROUGH)LOVE, preceded the setting up of the township by 5 years.\nThe township was in line with the international trend for Intended Communities, it had among other efforts, a community kitchen, an activity based school called ActivitySchool, a park, physical, artistic, political, economic activity, a team of peace corps, gatherings of like minds, theatrical activity, picnics, etc.\n\nAlthough Preet Nagar suffered a lot at the time of India's partition (it is situated merely a few kilometers from the border that divides India and Pakistan)and most of its inhabitants migrated to Delhi and other cities during those turbulent days, Gurbaksh Singh and his family returned to live there with a few other families.\n\nIn the mid 90's, two decades after Gurbaksh Singh's death, a Trust named 'Gurbaksh Singh Nanak Singh Foundation' was set up to restart cultural activities in Preet Nagar. A building was erected to host a library, an indoor conference hall and an amphitheater. Currently, under the chairperson-ship of the eldest daughter of the writer, Uma Gurbaksh Singh, plays are staged every month in the amphitheater to entertain and educate the local people. This tradition has been going on for the last ten years and Punjabi plays from all over the state as well as neighboring Pakistan have been performed there.\n\nTo share his vision and philosophy of life with others, he started the monthly journal \"Preet Lari\" in 1933. The journal became so popular that Gurbaksh Singh came to be known as Gurbaksh Singh Preet Lari, although he himself never used this suffix as an author. During Gurbaksh Singh's lifetime, from the 1950s his son Navtej Singh, a well-known writer himself, started co-editing the journal with his father and remained its editor until his own death in 1981. After the death of Navtej Singh, his son Sumit Singh aka Shammi and Shammi's wife Poonam continued to run the magazine. Shammi was killed by Sikh fundamentalists as he wrote against extremism. The magazine is now run by Poonam Singh who is the editor and Rati Kant Singh, Shammi's younger brother and husband to Poonam Singh. Gurbaksh Singh's son Hirday Paul Singh edited \"Bal Sandesh\" the special children's magazine in Punjabi, also started by Sardar Gurbaksh Singh.\n\nThe journal Preet Lari carried translations,interpretations of western thought,trends as well as sought to reinvent indehenous institutions in the same,i.e., modern light.\n\nThe family members of Gurbakhsh Singh sported his efforts and the next generation carried on the work during his lifetime and after.\nThe magazine, once printed in four languages, and influencing the generations now in their late seventies in Pakistan, too, and going to many countries such as Thailand. That is, wherever Punjabis were settled, brought about a cultural revolution of sorts.\nIt continues to run today and can be seen at preetlari.wordpress,com? edited by Poonam Singh, his granddaughter in law and published by his grandson Rati Kant Singh.\n\nThere is an Award for Punjabi writer which is named as Gurbaksh Singh Preetlari Award and given to many modern Punjabi Writers such as Dalbir Chetan as mentioned in Who's who of Indian Writers, 1999: A-M book.\n\n"}

There are several Hindu temples which have carvings that depict both men and women engaging in homosexual acts. Same-sex relations and gender variance have been represented within Hinduism from Vedic times through to the present day, in rituals, law books, religious or so-called mythical narratives, commentaries, paintings, and sculpture. The extent to which these representations embrace or reject homosexuality has been disputed within the religion as well as outside of it. In 2009, The United Kingdom Hindu Council issued a statement that 'Hinduism does not condemn homosexuality', subsequent to the decision of the Delhi High Court to legalise homosexuality in India. The Supreme Court of India subsequently overturned the capital high court's decision. A high-ranking member of the influential right-wing Hindu group RSS has publicly stated that he does not believe homosexuality should be illegal, and that the RSS had no official stance on this issue since it was a matter of personal preference. After Supreme Court of India struck down parts of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, RSS stated that while relationships between people of same gender was unnatural, it was not a criminal act.\n\nThe general Hindu civil and criminal code Manu Smriti before the colonial era prescribes strict but corrective punishments and not penalties for LGBs.\n− \nTQAIs are considered equal members of the society with privelages,the famous being Brihannala and Sikhandi\n− \nमैथुनं तु समासेव्य पुंसि योषिति वा द्विजः । \n− \nगोयानेऽप्सु दिवा चैव सवासाः स्नानमाचरेत् ॥ १७४ ॥ \n− \nmaithunaṃ tu samāsevya puṃsi yoṣiti vā dvijaḥ | \n− \ngoyāne'psu divā caiva savāsāḥ snānamācaret || 174 || \n− \nIf a twice-born man commits an unnatural offence with a male, or has intercourse with a female, in an ox-cart, or in water, or during the day, — he should take a bath along with his clothes. — (174)\n− \n− \nOne more shloka from Manu Smriti that condemns homosexuality in men is given below:\n− \nब्राह्मणस्य रुजः कृत्वा घ्रातिरघ्रेयमद्ययोः । \n− \nजैह्म्यं च मैथुनं पुंसि जातिभ्रंशकरं स्मृतम् ॥ ६७ ॥ \n− \nbrāhmaṇasya rujaḥ kṛtvā ghrātiraghreyamadyayoḥ | \n− \njaihmyaṃ ca maithunaṃ puṃsi jātibhraṃśakaraṃ smṛtam || 67 || \n− \nCausing pain to a Brāhmaṇa (by a blow), — smelling at things that should not be smelt, or at wine, — cheating — and sexual intercourse with a man, — all this is declared to lead to loss of caste (Gatibhramsa). — (67) \n− \n− \nThe Atri Smriti also mentions homosexuality as a sin and prescribes an expiation measure for the same:\n− \nBy discharging semen into inhuman females except a cow, into a woman in [her] menses, into others that have no female organs (i.e., a man or a eunuch), or into water one should perform the penance of Santapanam.\n− \n− \nSimilarly,holy cantos such as the Garuda Purana,Bhagavatam and Devi Bhagavatam talk of the Naraka of Vajrakantaka Salmali where LGBs are purged of their sexual sins by diamond sharp thorned Salmali whips.\n− \nLGBTQIA+ activists who include the homosexuals in the Hindu Right Wing R.S.S however seek to modernise this stance.\n− \nAlthough some Hindu dharmic texts contain injunctions against homosexuality, a number of Hindu mythic stories have portrayed homosexual experience as natural and joyful. There are several Hindu temples which have carvings that depict both men and women engaging in homosexual acts. Same-sex relations and gender variance have been represented within Hinduism from Vedic times through to the present day, in rituals, law books, religious or so-called mythical narratives, commentaries, paintings, and sculpture.

A high-ranking member of the influential right-wing Hindu group RSS has publicly stated that he does not believe homosexuality should be illegal, and that the RSS had no official stance on this issue since it was a matter of personal preference.\n\nUnlike the West, the Hindu society does not have the concept of 'sexual orientation' that classifies males on the basis of who they desire. However, there is a strong, ancient concept of third gender, which is for individuals who have strong elements of both male and female in them. According to Sanskrit texts such as the Narada-smriti, Sushruta Samhita, etc., this third sex or gender includes people who have conventionally been called homosexuals, bisexuals, transgender people and intersex people (LGBTI). Third genders are described in ancient Vedic texts as males who have a female nature—referring to homosexual men or feminine-gendered males. The gender/sexual role of third genders has for long been predominantly associated with receiving penetration from men, just like the gender/ sexual role of manhood has been to penetrate men, women or third genders. However, the Kama Sutra clearly describes third-gender men assuming both masculine and feminine identities as well as both receptive and dominant sexual roles.\n\nAlthough Hindu society does not formally acknowledge sexuality between men, it formally acknowledges and gives space to sexuality between men and third genders as a variation of male-female sex (i.e., a part of heterosexuality, rather than homosexuality, if analysed in Western terms). In fact, Hijras, Alis, Kotis, etc.— the various forms of third gender that exist in India today— are all characterized by the gender role of having receptive anal and oral sex with men. Sexuality between men (as distinct from third genders) has nevertheless thrived, mostly unspoken, informally, within men's spaces, without being seen as 'different' in the way it is seen in the West. As in some other non-Western cultures, it is considered more or less a universal aspect of manhood, even if not socially desirable. It is the effeminate male sexuality for men (or for women) which is seen as 'different,' and differently categorised. Men often refer to their sexual play with each other as \"'musti\".'\n\nThe Hindu concept of homosexuality seeks to break this distinction between third gender and men, and to isolate sexuality between men along with the third genders, with all its negative consequences. As such, men in India have long resisted the concept of 'gay,' and have sex with men without identifying as a 'homosexual.' Gay activists have sought to introduce a locally acceptable term for 'homosexual' for two decades, without success. Finally, the term MSM was taken, because it was technically difficult for men to avoid, if they had sex with men. However, it too was rejected by Indian men, as it was seen as just another term for 'gay.' In the past few years, however, the concept of 'homosexuality' has finally taken root.\n\nA significant fallout of this has been that sexual desire between men, which was near universal earlier, is now become more and more isolated from the mainstream, as men are distancing themselves from it because of the stigma of effeminacy or third gender attached to the notion of 'gay.' \n\nSexuality is rarely discussed openly in contemporary Hindu society, especially in modern India where homosexuality was illegal until a brief period beginning in 2009, due to colonial British laws. On July 2, 2009 The Delhi High Court in a historic judgement decriminalised homosexuality in India; where the court noted that the existing laws violated fundamental rights to personal liberty (Article 21 of the Indian Constitution) and equality (Article 14) and prohibition of discrimination (Article 15). However, the Supreme Court of India re-affirmed the penal code provision and overturned the Delhi High Court decision, effectively re-instating the legal ban on homosexuality. Now penalties include life imprisonment. Furthermore LGBT people are often subected to torture, executions and fines by non-government affiliated vigilante groups.\n\nEven though Hinduism is never known to exclusively ban homosexuality, certain Hindu nationalist factions are opposed to legalising homosexuality while certain others choose to remain silent. However, in the last twenty years homosexuality has become increasingly visible in the print and audio-visual media, with many out LGBT people, an active LGBT movement, and a large Indian LGBT presence on the Internet. From the 1990s onward, modern gay and lesbian Hindu organizations have surfaced in India's major cities and in 2004, plausible calls were made for the first time to repeal India's laws against homosexuality.\n\nDeepa Mehta's 1996 film \"Fire\", which depicts a romantic relationship between two Hindu women, was informally banned for \"religious insensitivity\" after Hindu Nationalists attacked cinemas where it was being screened on the grounds that it denigrated Indian culture, not on the grounds of homophobia per se, a position shared and confirmed by feminist Madhu Kishwar. In addition, The Bharatiya Janata Party who were in power in India at the time, refused to ban it. Similar protests occurred in 2004 against the lesbian-themed film \"Girlfriend\" — even though the portrayal of lesbianism was this time distinctly unsympathetic. Several human-rights groups such as the People's Union for Civil Liberties have asserted that sexual minorities in India face severe discrimination and violence, especially those from rural and lower caste backgrounds.\n\nIn her book, \"Love's Rite\", Ruth Vanita examines the phenomena of same-sex weddings, many by Hindu rites, which have been reported by the Indian press over the last thirty years and with increasing frequency. In the same period, same-sex joint suicides have also been reported. Most of these marriages and suicides are by lower middle-class female couples from small towns and rural areas across the country; these women have no contact with any LGBT movements. Both cross-sex and same-sex couples, when faced with family opposition, tend to resort to either elopement and marriage or to joint suicide in the hope of reunion in the next life. Vanita examines how Hindu doctrines such as rebirth and the genderlessness of the soul are often interpreted to legitimize socially disapproved relationships, including same-sex ones. In a 2004 survey, most — though not all — swamis said they opposed the concept of a Hindu-sanctified gay marriage. But several Hindu priests have performed same-sex marriages, arguing that love is the result of attachments from previous births and that marriage, as a union of spirit, is transcendental to gender.\n\nSome Indian and Hindu intellectuals now publicly support LGBT civil rights. Some liberal Hindu reform movements, especially those in the West, also support social acceptance of gays, lesbians and other gender minorities. Psychoanalyst Sudhir Kakar writes that Hindus are more accepting of \"deviance or eccentricity\" than are adherents of Western religions, who typically treat sexual variance as \"anti-social or psychopathological, requiring 'correction' or 'cure'\". Hindus, he argues, believe instead that each individual must fulfil their personal destiny (\"svadharma\") as they travel the path towards moksha (transcendence).\n\nCommenting on the legalisation of homosexuality in India; Anil Bhanot, general secretary of The United Kingdom Hindu Council said: \"The point here is that the homosexual nature is part of the natural law of God; it should be accepted for what it is, no more and no less. Hindus are generally conservative but it seems to me that in ancient India, they even celebrated sex as an enjoyable part of procreation, where priests were invited for ceremonies in their home to mark the beginning of the process\"\n\nHindu philosophy has the concept of a third sex or third gender (\"tritiya-prakriti\" – literally, \"third nature\"). This category includes a wide range of people with mixed male and female natures such as effeminate males, masculine females, transgender people, transsexual people, the intersexed, androgynes, and so on. Many MTF third-genders are not attracted only or at all to men, but are attracted either exclusively to women or are bisexual. Many FTM transgender people are attracted to men. Such persons are not considered fully male or female in traditional Hinduism, being a combination of both. They are mentioned as third sex by nature (birth) and are not expected to behave like ordinary men and women. They often keep their own societies or town quarters, perform specific occupations (such as masseurs, hairdressers, flower-sellers, domestic servants, etc.) and are generally attributed a semi-divine status. Their participation in religious ceremonies, especially as crossdressing dancers and devotees of certain temple gods/goddesses, is considered auspicious in traditional Hinduism. Some Hindus believe that third-sex people have special powers allowing them to bless or curse others. \n\nIn 2008, the state of Tamil Nadu recognised the \"Third Gender\"; with its civil supplies department giving in the ration card a provision for a new sex column as 'T', distinct from the usual 'M' and 'F' for males and females respectively. This was the first time that authorities anywhere in India have officially recognised the third gender.\n\nIn the Hindu narrative tradition, stories of gods and mortals changing gender occur. Sometimes they also engage in heterosexual activities as different reincarnated genders. Homosexual and transgender Hindus commonly identify with and worship the various Hindu deities connected with gender diversity such as Ardhanarisvara (the androgynous form of Shiva and his consort Parvati), Aravan (a hero whom the god Krishna married after becoming a woman), Harihara (an incarnation of Shiva and Vishnu combined), Bahuchara Mata (a goddess connected with transsexuality and eunuchism), Gadadhara (an incarnation of Radha in male form), Chandi-Chamunda (twin warrior goddesses), Bhagavati-devi (a Hindu goddess associated with crossdressing), Gangamma (a goddess connected with crossdressing and disguises) and the goddess Yellamma. There are also specific festivals connected to the worship of these deities, some of which are famous in India for their crossdressing devotees. These festivals include the Aravan Festival of Koovagam, the Bahuchara Mata Festivals of Gujarat and the Yellamma Festivals of Karnataka, among others. Deities displaying gender variance include Mohini, the female avatar of the god Vishnu and Vaikuntha Kamalaja, the androgynous form of Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi.\n\nLBGT interpretations are also drawn in the legends of birth of the deities Ayyappa (a god born from the union of Shiva and Mohini), Bhagiratha (an Indian king born of two female parents) and Kartikeya (where the fire-god Agni \"swallows\" the seed of Shiva after disturbing his coitus with his consort Parvati). Some homosexual Hindus also worship the gods Mitra and Varuna, who are associated with two lunar phases and same-sex relations in ancient Brahmana texts.\n\nGender variance is also observed in heroes in Hindu scriptures. The Hindu epic \"Mahabharata\" narrates that the hero Arjuna takes a vow to live as a member of the third sex for a year as the result of a curse he is compelled to honor. He thus transforms into Brihannala, a member of the third gender, for a year and becomes a dance teacher to a princess. Another important character, Shikhandi, is born female, but raised as a man and even married to a woman. She becomes male due to the grace of a yaksha. Shikhandi eventually becomes the reason of the death of the warrior Bhishma, who refuses to fight a \"woman.\" Another character, Bhishma appeases Yudhishtira's curiosity about relative enjoyment of partners during sex by relating the story of King Bhangasvana, who having had a hundred sons is turned into a woman while on a hunt. She returns to her kingdom, relates the story, turns the kingdom over to her children and retires to the forest to be the spouse of a hermit, by whom she has a hundred more sons. Ila, a king from Hindu narratives, is also known for his/her gender changes.\n\nSome versions of the Krittivasa Ramayana, the most popular Bengali text on the pastimes of Ramachandra (an incarnation of Vishnu), relate a story of two queens who conceived a child together. When the king of the Sun Dynasty, Maharaja Dilipa, died, the demigods become concerned that he did not have a son to continue his line. Shiva therefore appeared before the king's two widowed queens and commanded them, \"You two make love together and by my blessings you will bear a beautiful son.\" The two wives, with great affection for each other, executed Shiva's order until one of them conceived a child. The sage Astavakra accordingly named the child \"Bhagiratha\" – he who was born from two vulvas. Bhagiratha later became a king and is credited with bringing the river Ganges down to earth through his austerities.\n\nHindus have many sacred texts and different communities give special importance to different texts. Even more so than in other religions, Hindus also foster disparate interpretations of the meaning of various texts. The Vedas, which form the foundation of Hinduism for many, do not refer explicitly to homosexuality, but Rigveda says regarding Samsara that Vikruti Evam Prakriti (perversity/diversity is what nature is all about, or, what seems un-natural is also natural), which some scholars believe recognizes the cyclical constancy of homosexual/transsexual dimensions of human life, like all forms of universal diversities. People of a third gender (\"tritiya-prakriti\"), not fully men nor women, are mentioned here and there throughout Hindu texts such as the Puranas but are not specifically defined. In general they are portrayed as effeminate men, often cowardly, and with no desire for women. Modern readers often draw parallels between these and modern stereotypes of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender sexual identities. However, Hindu texts (Mostly Dharmasastras) such as the Manusmirti, Vide Atri Smřti , Vide Baudhāyana Dharmasūtra and the Vide Apastambha Dharmasūtra do treat Homosexuality as a sin, in some cases legally punishable. in addition, each hindu denomination had developed distinct rules regarding sexuality, as hinduism is not unifyed and is decentralized in essence.\n\nHistorians Ruth Vanita and Saleem Kidwai, in their pioneering book, \"Same-Sex Love in India: Readings from Literature and History\", for the first time compiled extracts from Indian texts, from ancient to modern times, including many Hindu texts, translated from 15 Indian languages. In their accompanying analytical essays, they also demonstrated that Hindu texts have discussed and debated same-sex desire from the earliest times, in tones ranging from critical to non-judgmental to playful and celebratory.\n\nMythologist Devdutt Pattanaik summarizes the place of homosexuality in Hindu literature as follows: \"though not part of the mainstream, its existence was acknowledged but not approved.\" Other Indologists assert that homosexuality was not approved for brahmanas or the twice-born but accepted among other castes.\n\nIn his book, \"Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex\", Vaishnava monk Amara Das Wilhelm demonstrates how ancient expressions of Hinduism accommodated homosexual and transgender persons much more positively than we see in India today: \"Early Vedic teachings stressed responsible family life and asceticism but also tolerated different types of sexualities within general society.\"\n\nThe Mahanirvana tantra exclude the third-gendered from the right of inheritance, although establishing they have the right to be financially supported by their family.\n\nThe Kama Sutra is an ancient text dealing with \"kama\" or desire (of all kinds), which in Hindu thought is one of the four normative and spiritual goals of life. The Kama Sutra is the earliest extant and most important work in the Kama Shastra tradition of Sanskrit literature. It was compiled by the philosopher Vatsyayana around the 4th century, from earlier texts, and describes homosexual practices in several places, as well as a range of sex/gender 'types'. The author acknowledges that these relations also involve love and a bond of trust.\n\nThe author describes techniques by which masculine and feminine types of the third sex (\"tritiya-prakriti\"), as well as women, perform fellatio. The Second Part, Ninth Chapter of Kama Sutra specifically describes two kinds of men that we would recognize today as masculine- and feminine-type homosexuals but which are mentioned in older, Victorian British translations as simply \"eunuchs.\" The chapter describes their appearances – feminine types dressed up as women whereas masculine types maintained muscular physiques and grew small beards, moustaches, etc. – and their various professions as masseurs, barbers and prostitutes are all described. Such homosexual men were also known to marry, according to the Kama Sutra: \"There are also third-sex citizens, sometimes greatly attached to one another and with complete faith in one another, who get married together.\" (KS 2.9.36). In the \"Jayamangala\" of Yashodhara, an important twelfth-century commentary on the Kama Sutra, it is also stated: \"Citizens with this kind of homosexual inclination, who renounce women and can do without them willingly because they love one another, get married together, bound by a deep and trusting friendship.\"\n\nAfter describing fellatio as performed between men of the third sex, the Sutra then mentions the practice as an act between men and women, wherein the homosexuals acts are scorned, especially for brahmanas. (KS 2.9.37)\n\nThe Kama Sutra also refers to \"svairini\", who are \"independent women who frequent their own kind or others\" (2.8.26) — or, in another passage: \"the liberated woman, or \"svairini\", is one who refuses a husband and has relations in her own home or in other houses\" (6.6.50). In a famous commentary on the Kama Sutra from the 12th century, Jayamangala, explains: \"A woman known for her independence, with no sexual bars, and acting as she wishes, is called \"svairini\". She makes love with her own kind. She strokes her partner at the point of union, which she kisses.\" (\"Jayamangala\" on Kama Sutra 2.8.13). The various practices of lesbians are described in detail within the Second Part, Eighth Chapter of the Kama Sutra.\n\nThere are other ancient Hindu/Sanskrit texts that refer to homosexuality. The Sushruta Samhita, for example, a highly respected Hindu medical text dating back to at least 600 B.C., mentions two different types of homosexual men (\"kumbhika\" – men who take the passive role in anal sex; and \"asekya\" – men who devour the semen of other men) as well as transgender people (\"sandha\" – men with the qualities, behavior and speech of women). It also states that men who behave like women, or women who behave like men, are determined as such at the time of their conception in the womb. (SS 3.2.42–43) The Sushruta Samhita also mentions the possibility of two women uniting and becoming pregnant as a result of the mingling of their sexual fluids. It states that the child born of such a union will be \"boneless.\" Such a birth is indeed described in the \"Krittivasa\" Ramayana of Bengal (see below).\n\nOther texts list the various types of men who are impotent with women (known in Sanskrit as \"sandha\", \"kliba\", \"napumsaka\", and \"panda\"). The \"Sabda-kalpa-druma\" Sanskrit-Sanskrit dictionary, for instance, lists twenty types, as does the \"Kamatantra\" and \"Smriti-Ratnavali\" of Vacaspati (14th century). The Narada Smriti similarly lists fourteen different types. Included among the lists are transgender people (\"sandha\"), intersex people (\"nisarga\"), and three different types of homosexual men (\"mukhebhaga\", \"kumbhika\" and \"asekya\"). Such texts demonstrate that third-sex terms like \"sandha\" and \"napumsaka\" actually refer to many different types of \"men who are impotent with women,\" and that simplistic definitions such as \"eunuch\" or \"neuter\" may not always be accurate and in some cases totally incorrect. In his article \"Homosexuality and Hinduism\", Arvind Sharma expresses his doubt over the common English translation of words like \"kliba\" into \"eunuch\" as follows: \"The limited practice of castration in India raises another point significant for the rest of the discussion, namely, whether rendering a word such as \"kliba\" as \"eunuch\" regularly is correct...\"\n\nThe Arthashastra of Kautilya represents the principle text of secular law and illustrates the attitude of the judiciary towards sexual matters. Heterosexual vaginal sex is proposed as the norm by this text and legal issues arising from deviation there from are punishable by fines and in extreme cases by capital punishment. Homosexual acts are cited as a small offence punishable by a fine.\n\nSangam literature use the word ‘Pedi’ to refer to transwomen, Likewise, the famous sangam period characters of King Koperunchozhan and Pisuranthaiyar are another example for same sex love and They are said to have not seen each other at all and yet shared love and regard for each other, so much, that they die at the same time at different places. “For instance, the friendship between King Pari and poet Kabilar is shown as something more than just friendship. There are lyrical undertones suggestive of the intimate relationship they had. But since there are no explicit representation, one can only postulate a possibility.\n\nBelow are listed some of the most common third-gender sects found in Hinduism. There are an estimated half million crossdressing \"eunuchs\" in modern-day India, associated with various sects, temples and Hindu deities. Despite being called \"eunuchs\", the majority of these persons (91%) do not practice castration but are more accurately associated with transgender.\n\nThe most well-known third-gender group in India is perhaps the \"hijra\" of northern India. The \"hijra\" is the only sect that practices castration, a custom introduced during Muslim rule around the tenth century A.D. Male castration is not recommended in the Vedas and is not a traditional Hindu practice. There are an estimated 50,000 \"hijra\" in northern India. After interviewing and studying the \"hijra\" for many years, Serena Nanda writes in her book, \"Neither Man Nor Woman: The hijras of India\", as follows: \"There is a widespread belief in India that \"hijras\" are born hermaphrodites [intersex] and are taken away by the \"hijra\" community at birth or in childhood, but I found no evidence to support this belief among the \"hijras\" I met, all of whom joined the community voluntarily, often in their teens.\" Nanda also states: \"There is absolutely no question that at least some \"hijras\" – perhaps even the majority – are homosexual prostitutes. Sinha's (1967) study of \"hijras\" in Lucknow, in North India, acknowledges the \"hijra\" role as performers, but views the major motivation for recruitment to the \"hijra\" community as the satisfaction of the individual's homosexual urges...\" The \"hijras\" especially worship Bahuchara, the Hindu goddess presiding over transsexuality.\n\nThe most numerous third-gender sect (estimated at 150,000) is the \"aravani\" or \"ali\" of Tamil Nadu in southern India. The \"aravanis\" are typically transgender and their main festival, the popular Koovagam or Aravan Festival celebrated in late April/early May, is attended by thousands, including many transgender people and homosexuals. The \"aravani\" worship the Hindu god, Aravan, and do not practice any system of castration.\n\nA lesser-known third-gender sect in India is the \"jogappa\" of South India (Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh), a group similarly associated with prostitution. The \"jogappa\" are connected with the goddess Yellamma (Renuka), and include both transgender people and homosexuals. Both serve as dancers and prostitutes, and they are usually in charge of the temple \"devadasis\" (maidservants of the goddess who similarly serve as dancers and female courtesans). Large festivals are celebrated at these temples wherein hundreds of scantily-clad \"devadasis\" and \"jogappas\" parade through the streets. The \"jogappa\" do not practice castration.\n\nMedieval Hindu temples such as those at Khajuraho depict sexual acts in sculptures on the external walls. Some of these scenes involve same-sex sexuality:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11495982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11495982", "title": "Hubur", "text": "Hubur\n\nHubur () is a Sumerian term meaning \"river\", \"watercourse\" or \"netherworld\", written ideographically with the cuneiform signs . It is usually the \"river of the netherworld\".\n\nA connection to Tiamat has been suggested with parallels to her description as \"Ummu-Hubur\". Hubur is also referred to in the Enuma Elish as \"mother sea Hubur, who fashions all things\". The river Euphrates has been identified with Hubur as the source of fertility in Sumer. This Babylonian \"river of creation\" has been linked to the Hebrew \"river of paradise\". Gunkel and Zimmern suggested resemblance in expressions and a possible connection between the Sumerian river and that found in later literary tradition in the Book of Ezekiel () likely influencing imagery of the \"River of Water of Life\" in the Apocalypse (). They also noted a connection between the \"Water of Life\" in the legend of Adapa and a myth translated by A.H. Sayce called \"An address to the river of creation\". Delitzch has suggested the similar Sumerian word Habur probably meant \"mighty water source\", \"source of fertility\" or the like. This has suggested the meaning of Hubur to be \"river of fertility in the underworld\". Linda Foubister has suggested the river of creation was linked with the importance of rivers and rain in the fertile crescent and suggested it was related to the underworld as rivers resemble snakes. Samuel Eugene Balentine suggested that the \"pit\" (sahar) and \"river\" or \"channel\" (salah) in the Book of Job () were referencing the Hubur. The god Marduk was praised for restoration or saving individuals from death when he drew them out of the waters of the Hubur, a later reference to this theme is made in Psalm 18 ().\n\nThe river plays a certain role in Mesopotamian mythology and Assyro-Babylonian religion, associated with the Sumerian paradise and heroes and deities such as Gilgamesh, Enlil, Enki and Ninlil. The Hubur was suggested to be between the twin peaks of Mount Mashu to the east in front of the gates of the netherworld. The Sumerian myth of Enlil and Ninlil tells the tale of the leader of the gods, Enlil being banished to the netherworld followed by his wife Ninlil. It mentions the river and its ferryman, SI.LU.IGI, who crosses the river in a boat. Themes of this story are repeated later in the Epic of Gilgamesh where the ferryman is called Urshanabi. In later Assyrian times, the ferryman became a monster called Hamar-tabal and may have influenced the later Charon of Greek Mythology. In another story a four-handed, bird demon carries souls across to the city of the dead. Several Akkadian demons are also restrained by the river Hubur. The river is mentioned in the Inscription of Ilum-Ishar, written on bricks at Mari. Nergal, god of the netherworld is referred to as \"king Hubur\" in a list of Sumerian gods. The word is also used into the Assyrian empire where it was used as the name of the tenth month in a calendar dated to around 1100 BC. There was also a goddess called Haburitim mentioned in texts from the Third dynasty of Ur.\n\nIn Sumerian cosmology, the souls of the dead had to travel across the desert or steppe, cross the Hubur river, to the mountainland of Kur. Here the souls had to pass through seven different walled and gated locations to reach the netherworld. The Annanuki administrated Kur as if it were a civilized settlement both architecturally and politically.\n\nFrans Wiggermann connected Hubur to the Habur, a tributary of the Euphrates far away from the Sumerian heartland, there was also a town called Haburatum east of the Tigris. He suggested that as the concept of the netherworld (as opposed to an \"under\"world) in Sumerian cosmogeny lacked the modern concept of an accompanying divine ruler of a location underneath the earth, the geographical terminology suggested that it was located at the edges of the world and that its features derived in part from real geography before shifting to become a demonic fantasy world.\n\n"}

{"id": "1862200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1862200", "title": "Islamic pottery", "text": "Islamic pottery\n\nMedieval Islamic pottery occupied a geographical position between Chinese ceramics, then the unchallenged leaders of Eurasian production, and the pottery of the Byzantine Empire and Europe. For most of the period it can fairly be said to have been between the two in terms of aesthetic achievement and influence as well, borrowing from China and exporting to and influencing Byzantium and Europe. The use of drinking and eating vessels in gold and silver, the ideal in ancient Rome and Persia as well as medieval Christian societies, is prohibited by the Hadiths, with the result that pottery and glass were used for tableware by Muslim elites, as pottery (but less often glass) also was in China, but was much rarer in Europe and Byzantium. In the same way Islamic restrictions greatly discouraged figurative wall-painting, encouraging the architectural use of schemes of decorative and often geometrically-patterned tiles, which are the most distinctive and original speciality of Islamic ceramics.\n\nThe era of Islamic pottery started around 622. From 633, Muslim armies moved rapidly towards Persia, Byzantium, Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Egypt and later Andalusia. The early history of Islamic pottery remains somewhat obscure and speculative as little evidence has survived. Apart from tiles which escaped destruction due to their use in architectural decoration of buildings and mosques, much early medieval pottery vanished.\n\nThe Muslim world inherited significant pottery industries in Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, North Africa (African Red Slip) and later other regions. Indeed, the origin of glazed pottery has been traced to Egypt where it was first introduced during the fourth millennium BCE. However most of these traditions made heavy use of figurative decoration, which was greatly reduced, though not entirely removed, under Islam. Instead Islamic pottery developed geometric and plant-based decoration to a very high level, and made more use of decorative schemes made up of many tiles than any previous culture.\n\nA distinct Muslim style in pottery was not firmly established until the 9th century in Iraq (formerly Mesopotamia), Syria and Persia. During this period pieces mainly used white tin-glaze. Information on earlier periods is very limited. This is largely due to the lack of surviving specimens in good condition which also limits the interest in the study of ceramics of these periods. Archaeological excavations carried out in Jordan uncovered only a few examples from the Umayyad period, mostly unglazed vessels from Khirbat Al-Mafjar. In the East, evidence shows that a production centre was set up in Samarkand under the Samanid dynasty who ruled this region and parts of Persia between 874 and 999 A.D. The most highly regarded technique of this centre is the use of calligraphy in the decoration of vessels. East Persian pottery from the 9th to 11th centuries decorated only with highly stylised inscriptions, called \"epigraphic ware\", has been described as \"probably the most refined and sensitive of all Persian pottery\".\n\nDuring the Abbasid dynasty pottery production gained momentum, largely using tin glazes mostly in the form of opaque white glaze. Some historians, such as Arthur Lane, attribute the rise of such industry to Chinese influence. Evidence from Muslim manuscripts, such as Akhbar al-Sin wa al-Hind (circa 851) and Ibn Kurdadhbih’s Book of Roads and Provinces (846-885), suggest that trade with China was firmly established. Lane also referred to the passage in a work written by Muhammad ibn al-Husayn al-Baihaki, (circa 1059) where he stated that the governor of Khurasan, ‘Ali ibn ‘Isa, sent as a present to the Caliph Harun al-Rashid (786-809), “twenty pieces of Chinese Imperial porcelain (Chini faghfuri), the like of which had never been seen at a Caliph’s court before, in addition to 2,000 other pieces of porcelain”.\nAccording to Lane, the influence of Chinese pottery progressed in three main phases. The first contact with China took place in 751 when the Arabs defeated the Chinese at the Battle of Talas. It has been argued that imprisoned Chinese potters and paper makers could have taught the Muslims the art of pottery and paper-making. In 800’s Chinese stoneware and porcelain reached the Abbasids. The second phase took place in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a period noted for the decline of pottery industry following the fall of the Seljuk dynasty. This period also saw the invasion of the Mongols who brought Chinese pottery traditions.\n\nThe influence of ceramics from the Tang Dynasty can be seen on lustrewares, produced by Mesopotamian potters, and on some early white wares excavated at Samarra (in modern-day Iraq). Ceramics from this period were excavated at Nishapur (in modern-day Iran) and Samarkand (in modern-day Uzbekistan).\nBy the time of the Mongol invasion of China a considerable export trade westwards to the Islamic world was established, and Islamic attempts to imitate Chinese porcelain in their own fritware bodies had begun in the 12th century. These were less successful than those of Korean pottery, but eventually were able to provide attractive local competition to Chinese imports. Chinese production could adapt to the preferences of foreign markets; larger celadon dishes than the Chinese market wanted were favoured for serving princely banquets in the Middle East. Celadon wares were believed there to have the ability to detect poison, by sweating or breaking.\n\nThe Islamic market was apparently especially important in the early years of Chinese blue and white porcelain, which appears to have been mainly exported until the Ming. Again, large dishes were an export style, and the densely painted decoration of Yuan blue and white borrowed heavily from the arabesques and plant scrolls of Islamic decoration, probably mostly taking the style from metalwork examples, which also provided shapes for some vessels. This style of ornament was then confined to blue and white, and is not found in the red and white painted wares then preferred by the Chinese themselves. The cobalt blue that was used was itself imported from Persia, and the export trade in porcelain was handled by colonies of Muslim merchants in Quanzhou, convenient for the huge Jingdezhen potteries, and other ports to the south.\n\nThe start of the Ming dynasty was quickly followed by a decree of 1368, forbidding trade with foreign countries. This was not entirely successful, and had to be repeated several times, and the giving of lavish imperial diplomatic gifts continued, concentrating on silk and porcelain (19,000 pieces of porcelain in 1383), but it severely set back the export trade. The policy was relaxed under the next emperor after 1403, but had by then greatly stimulated the production of pottery emulating Chinese styles in the Islamic world itself, which was by now reaching a high level of quality in several countries (high enough to fool contemporary Europeans in many cases).\n\nOften Islamic production imitated not the latest Chinese styles, but those of the late Yuan and early Ming. In turn, Chinese potters began in the early 16th century to produce some items in overtly Islamic styles, including jumbled inscriptions in Arabic. These appear to have been made for the growing Chinese Muslim market, and probably those at court wishing to keep up with the Zhengde Emperor's (r. 1505-1521) flirtation with Islam.\n\nFrom between the eighth and eighteenth centuries, the use of glazed ceramics was prevalent in Islamic art, usually assuming the form of elaborate pottery. Tin-opacified glazing, for the production of tin-glazed pottery, was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters. The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in Basra, dating to around the 8th century. Another significant contribution was the development of stoneware originating in 9th-century Iraq. It was a vitreous or semivitreous ceramic ware of fine texture, made primarily from non-refactory fire clay. Other centres for innovative pottery in the Islamic world included Fustat (from 975 to 1075), Damascus (from 1100 to around 1600) and Tabriz (from 1470 to 1550).\n\nLusterware was produced in Mesopotamia in the 9th century; the technique soon became popular in Persia and Syria. Lusterware was later produced in Egypt during the Fatimid caliphate in the 10th-12th centuries. While some production of lustreware continued in the Middle East, it spread to Europe—first in the Hispano-Moresque ware of Al-Andalus, notably at Málaga, and then Valencia, then later to Italy, where it was used to enhance maiolica.\n\nAnother innovation was the albarello, a type of maiolica earthenware jar originally designed to hold apothecaries' ointments and dry drugs. The development of this type of pharmacy jar had its roots in the Islamic Middle East. Brought to Italy from Spain, the earliest Italian examples were produced in Florence in the 15th century.\n\nFritware refers to a type of pottery which was first developed in the Near East, where production is dated to the late first millennium AD through the second millennium AD. Frit was a significant ingredient. A recipe for “fritware” dating to c. 1300 AD written by Abu’l Qasim reports that the ratio of quartz to “frit-glass” to white clay is 10:1:1. This type of pottery has also been referred to as “stoneware\" and “faience” among other names. A ninth-century corpus of “proto-stoneware” from Baghdad has “relict glass fragments” in its fabric. The glass is alkali-lime-lead-silica and, when the paste was fired or cooled, wollastonite and diopside crystals formed within the glass fragments. The lack of “inclusions of crushed pottery” suggests these fragments did not come from a glaze. The reason for their addition would be to act as a flux, and so “accelerate vitrification at a relatively low firing temperature, and thus increase the hardness and density of the [ceramic] body.”\n\nBy this period the distinctive Islamic tradition of decorated wall tiles had emerged, and continued to develop together with vessel pottery in a way unique to Islamic art. In the account of Ibn Naji (circa 1016) the Caliph sent, in addition to tiles, “a man from Baghdad” to Qairawan to produce lustre tiles for the mihrab of the Great Mosque (still well preserved). Georges Marcais suggested that Iraqi potters indeed came to Quairawan. The arrival of this Baghdadi potter must have led to the establishment of a satellite centre for the production of ceramics in Quairawan, but no information has yet been developed to confirm or deny this suggestion.\n\nThe events leading to the collapse of the Fatimid reign in 1171 caused ceramic production to move out to new centres, via processes similar to those described above with respect to Iraq. As a result, Persia became a centre of revival under the Seljuk rule (1038–1327). This is not coincidental as the Seljuks expanded their rule over Persia, Iraq, Syria, and Palestine, as well as Anatolia and Muslim Asia Minor. All of these had been, for some considerable time, centres of old pottery.\n\nThe Seljuks brought new and fresh inspiration to the Muslim world, attracting artists, craftsmen and potters from all regions including Egypt. In addition to continuing the production of similar (although more refined) tin and lustre glaze ceramics, the Seljuks (in Persia) were credited for the introduction of a new type sometimes known as \"Faience\". This is made from a hard white frit paste coated with transparent alkaline glaze.\n\nHispano-Moresque ware emerged in Al-Andaluz in the 13th century, probably after potters escaped the instability after the fall of the Fatimids. It introduced lustreware manufacture to Europe and from the start was widely exported to the elites of Christian kingdoms. The first centre was Málaga, producing wares in traditional Islamic styles, but from the 13th century Muslim potters migrated to the reconquered Christian city of Valencia, outlying suburbs of which such as Manises and Paterna became the most important centres, manufacturing mainly for Christian markets in styles increasingly influenced by European decoration, though retaining a distinct character. The potters were mostly still Muslim or Morisco.\nIn a rare manuscript from Kashan compiled by Abulqassim in 1301, there is a complete description of how faience production was carried out. Frit was made of ten parts of powdered quartz, one part of clay and one part of glaze mixture. The addition of greater amounts of clay made wheel throwing of the faience easier, and allowed a better quality of work, because otherwise the material had little plasticity. The glaze itself is “formed of a roughly equal mixture of ground quartz and the ashes of desert plants which contain a very high proportion of alkaline salts. These act as a flux and cause the quartz to vitrify at a manageable temperature. The two alone will produce a transparent glaze”. Lane compared this material with the French pâte tender, which was used by potters as recently as the eighteenth century. This body material and the new glaze offered the potter a greater handling and manipulation ability. This allows the potter to improve the quality and appearance of the vessel, including more refined decorative designs and patterns. The result was a substantial variety of products such as bowls of different size and shapes, jugs, incense burners, lamps, candlesticks, trays, tiles and so on. These advantages also allowed greater control of carved decoration, the use of which the Seljuks refined and extended during the twelfth century.\n\nCarved decoration in ceramics, sgraffito, is an old tradition used in ninth-century Islamic pottery; it is an engraving technique based on incising the design with a sharp tool through a white slip to reveal the red earthenware body. The vessel is then coated with glaze.\n\nThe Seljuks also developed the so-called silhouette wares which are distinguished by their black background. These are produced by a technique which consists of coating the white fritware body with a thick black slip, out of which the decoration is then carved. Later, a coat of colourless or coloured, usually blue or green, transparent glaze is applied. According to Lane, this technique was used, in a simpler form, in Samarkand between the ninth and tenth centuries. The method then consisted of mixing the colours with a thick opaque clay slip instead.\n\nThe influence of Blue and white porcelain of the Yuan and Ming dynasties is evident in many ceramics made by Muslim potters. İznik pottery from around İznik in Anatolia was supported by the Ottoman court and produced the finest Ottoman work in pottery and panels of tiles, using the same vocabulary of bold and elegant floral designs derived from Chinese decoration. A characteristic bold red was developed. İznik ware had a major influence on European decorative arts: for example, on Italian Maiolica. The pottery was produced in as early as the 15th century AD, and was preceded by Miletus ware from the same region. Its best period lasted until the late 16th century. It consists of a body, slip, and glaze, where the body and glaze are “quartz-frit.” The “frits” in both cases “are unusual in that they contain lead oxide as well as soda”; the lead oxide would help reduce the thermal expansion coefficient of the ceramic. Microscopic analysis reveals that the material that has been labeled “frit” is “interstitial glass” which serves to connect the quartz particles. Michael S. Tite argues that this glass was added as frit and that the interstitial glass formed on firing.\n\nThe 15th century saw the finest period of the Hispano-Moresque ware of Valencia, produced by largely Muslim potters in a Christian kingdom, though the southern industry centred on Málaga had ended by the mid-century. Persian pottery under the Safavid dynasty (from 1502) was also heavily influenced by Chinese blue and white porcelain, which to a large extent replaced it in court circles; fine 16th-century Persian pieces are very rare. \n\nThe Islamic parts of Southeast Asia, modern Indonesia and Malaysia, were export markets that were close at hand for the Chinese and later the Japanese, helped by the European trading companies, especially the Dutch East India Company. The Buddhist countries of the region also exported. Special types of wares were developed for them, such as the Chinese Kraak ware and Swatow ware, mostly producing large dishes for serving communally to a table. In the face of such competion, local wares were few and simple. \n\nThe Islamic world as a whole never managed to develop porcelain, but had an avid appetite for imports of it. East Asian porcelain, first Chinese then Japanese export porcelain in the 17th century, was joined in the 18th century by the wares from Europe, in particular Vienna porcelain, which specialized in the Eastern market, and by the latter part of the century was sending as many as 120,000 pieces per year to the Ottoman Empire, many small cups and saucers for Turkish coffee. The smaller scale factories of the Islamic world could not compete with the sophisticated imports arriving from both east and west, and local production became a craft affair, repeating now-traditional patterns.\n\nArthur Lane produced two books which made substantial contribution to understanding the history and merit of Muslim ceramics. The first book was dedicated to the study of early ceramics from the Abbasid period till the Seljuk times, sketching the various events which played a significant role in the rise and fall of particular styles. In his second work, Lane used the same rhetorical style adopted in the first book, this time devoting his attention to later periods from the Mongols to nineteenth-century İznik and Persian pottery.\n\nFollowing Lane's works, numerous studies appeared. The most comprehensive works adopting a general view are those by R.L. Hobson, Ernst J. Grube, Richard Ettinghausen, and more recently Alan Caiger-Smith and Gesa Febervari. Additional contributions were made by those specializing in particular temporal or regional history of Muslim pottery such as Georges Marcais in his work on North Africa, Oliver Watson on Persia and J.R. Hallett on Abbasid Pottery.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was also known as an activist for the preservation of Māori culture.\n\nBaxter was born in Dunedin to Archibald Baxter and Millicent Brown and grew up near Brighton, 20 km south of Dunedin city. He was named after James Keir Hardie, a founder of the British Labour Party. His father had been a conscientious objector during the First World War. His mother had studied Latin, French and German at the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney, the University of Sydney and Newnham College, University of Cambridge.\n\nOn his first day of school, Baxter burned his hand on a stove and later used this incident to represent the failure of institutional education. As a child he contrasted the social order represented by his maternal grandfather with the clan mentality of his Scottish father and frequently drew analogies between the Highland clans and the Māori tribes. Baxter stated that he began writing poetry at the age of seven, and he accumulated a large body of technically accomplished work both before and during his teenage years.\n\nIn 1944, at age eighteen he joined the University of Otagoand that year he published his first collection of poetry, \"Beyond the Palisade\", to much critical acclaim. His work during this time was, as with his contemporary compatriots, most notably the experimental novelist Janet Frame, largely influenced by the modernist works of Dylan Thomas. He was a member of the so-called \"Wellington Group\" of writers that also included Louis Johnson, W.H. Oliver and Alistair Campbell. Baxter typically wrote short lyrical poems or cycles of the same rather than longer poems; he failed to complete his course work at the University of Otago, due to increasing alcoholism and was forced to take a range of odd jobs from 1945-7, most notably a cleaner at Chelsea Sugar Refinery, which inspired the poem \"Ballad of the Stonegut Sugar Works\".\n\nIn 1948 he married Jacqueline Sturm, and his interest in Christianity culminated in his joining the Anglican church during that same year. In February 1951 Baxter enrolled at Wellington Teachers’ College. In 1952 his son, John, was born and a selection of poems in a collaborative volume, \"Poems unpleasant\", was published. Having completed his course at the teachers’ college in December, Baxter spent 1953 in full-time study at Victoria University College and published his third major collection, \"The fallen house\". In 1954 he was appointed assistant master at Epuni School, Lower Hutt and during that time joined Alcoholics Anonymous, being deeply inspired by its principles. He received a BA in 1956.\n\nBy 1955 he had garnered a substantial legacy and could afford a comfortable house in Ngaio, Wellington. He left Epuni School early in 1956 to write and edit primary school bulletins for the Department of Education’s School Publications Branch. This period is likely to have influenced his writing providing material for numerous attacks on bureaucracy. In 1957 Baxter took a course in Roman Catholicism, and his collection of poems \"In Fires of No Return\", published in 1958, was influenced by his new faith. This was his first work to be published internationally, though English critics were largely nonplussed. His wife, a committed Anglican, was dismayed by his Catholicism, and they divorced in 1957. Through the late 50s and 60s Baxter visited the Southern Star Abbey a Cistercian monastery at Kopua near Central Hawke's Bay. He was received into the Catholic church in 1958.\n\nIn the same year, Baxter received a UNESCO stipend and began an extended journey through Asia, and especially India, where Rabindranath Tagore's university Shantiniketan was one of the inspirations for Baxter's later community at Jerusalem. Here he was reconciled with his wife and contracted dysentery. His writing after returning from India was more overtly critical of New Zealand society. In the 1960s he became a powerful and prolific writer of both poems and drama, and it was through his radio play \"Jack Winter's dream\" that he became internationally known.\n\nThe first half of the 1960s saw Baxter struggling to make ends meet on his postman's wage, having refused to take work as a schoolmaster. However, it was at this time that the collection of poems \"Pig Island Letters\" was published in which his writing found a new level of clarity. In 1966, Baxter took up the Robert Burns Fellowship at the University of Otago.\n\nIn 1968 Baxter claimed that he had been instructed in a dream to 'Go to Jerusalem'. Jerusalem, New Zealand was a small Māori settlement (known by its Māori transliteration, Hiruharama) on the Whanganui River. He left his University position and a job composing catechetical material for the Catholic Education Board, with nothing but a bible. This was the culmination of a short period in which he struggled with family life and his vocation as a poet.\n\nBaxter spent some time in Grafton, Auckland where he set up a centre for drug addicts, acting on the same principles as Alcoholics Anonymous. In 1969 he adopted the Māori version of his name, Hemi, and moved to Jerusalem. He lived a sparse existence and made frequent trips to the nearby cities where he worked with the poor and spoke out against what he perceived as a social order that sanctions poverty. His poems of this time have a conversational style but speak strongly of his social and political convictions.\n\nThe harsh deprivations Baxter adopted at this time took their toll on his health. By 1972 he was too ill to continue living at Jerusalem and moved to a commune near Auckland. On 22 October 1972 he suffered a coronary thrombosis in the street and died in a nearby house, aged 46. He was buried at Jerusalem on Māori land in front of \"the Top House\" where he had lived, in a ceremony combining Māori and Catholic traditions.\n\nIn his critical study \"Lives of the Poets\", Michael Schmidt defines Baxter's 'Jacobean consonantal rhetoric'. Schmidt has claimed that Baxter was 'one of the most precocious poets of the century' whose neglect outside of New Zealand is baffling. His writing was affected by his alcoholism. His work drew upon Dylan Thomas and Yeats; then on MacNeice and Lowell. Michael Schmidt identifies 'an amalgam of Hopkins, Thomas and native atavisms' in Baxter's \"Prelude N.Z.\".\n\n\n"}

The weekly \"Jimmy Swaggart Telecast\" and \"A Study in the Word\" programs are broadcast throughout the U.S. and on 78 channels in 104 other countries, and over the Internet. At its height in the 1980s, his telecast was transmitted to over 3,000 stations and cable systems each week. He currently owns and operates the SonLife Broadcasting Network.\n\nSexual scandals with prostitutes in the late 1980s and early 1990s led the Assemblies of God to defrock him. As a result of the scandals, Swaggart temporarily stepped down as the head of Jimmy Swaggart Ministries.\n\nJimmy Lee Swaggart was born on March 15, 1935, in Ferriday, Louisiana. By relation, he is the nephew of Arilla ( Swaggart) Wells (1916–2015), who was also the manager of Wells Grocery in Tunica, Louisiana. He is the cousin of rock'n'roll pioneer Jerry Lee Lewis and country music star Mickey Gilley. He also had a sister, Jeanette Ensminger (1942–1999). With his parents, Swaggart attended a small, 25-member Assemblies of God church in Ferriday. In 1952, aged 17, Swaggart married 15-year-old Frances Anderson whom he met in church while he was playing music with his father. They have a son named Donnie. Swaggart worked several part-time odd jobs in order to support his young family and also began singing Southern Gospel music at various churches.\n\nAccording to his autobiography, Swaggart, along with his wife and son, lived in poverty during the 1950s as he preached throughout rural Louisiana, struggling to survive on US$30 a week (Approximately $250 adjusted for inflation to 2016). Being too poor to own a home, the Swaggarts lived in church basements, pastors' homes, and small motels. Sun Records producer Sam Phillips wanted to start a gospel line of music for the label (undoubtedly to remain in competition with RCA Victor and Columbia, who also had gospel lines at the time) and wanted Swaggart for Sun as the label's first gospel artist. Swaggart's cousin Jerry Lee Lewis, who had previously signed with Sun, was reportedly making $20,000 per week at the time. Although the offer meant a promise for significant income for him and his family, Swaggart turned Phillips down, stating that he was called to preach the gospel.\n\nPreaching from a flatbed trailer donated to him, Swaggart began full-time evangelistic work in 1955. He began developing a revival-meeting following throughout the American South. In 1960, he began recording gospel music record albums and transmitting on Christian radio stations. In 1961, Swaggart was ordained by the Assemblies of God; a year later he began his radio ministry. In the late 1960s, Swaggart founded what was then a small church named the Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; the church eventually became district-affiliated with the Assemblies of God.\n\nIn the late 1960s Swaggart began transmitting a weekly 30-minute telecast over various local television stations in Baton Rouge and also purchased a local AM radio station, WLUX (now WPFC). The station broadcast Christian feature stories, preaching and teaching from various fundamentalist and Pentecostal denominations and played black gospel, Southern gospel, and inspirational music. As Contemporary Christian music became more prevalent, the station avoided playing it. Swaggart sold many of his radio stations gradually throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. Jimmy Swaggart Ministries still operates several radio stations that operate under the name Sonlife Radio.\n\nBy 1975, Swaggart's television ministry had expanded to more stations around the U.S., and he started using television as his primary preaching forum. In 1978 Swaggart's weekly telecast was increased to an hour.\n\nIn 1980, Swaggart began a daily weekday telecast featuring Bible study and music, and the weekend, hour-long telecast included a service from either Family Worship Center (Swaggart's church) or an on-location crusade in a major city. In the early 1980s Swaggart's broadcasts expanded to major cities nationwide. By 1983, more than 250 television stations broadcast Swaggart's telecast.\n\nIn 1988, Swaggart was implicated in a sex scandal involving a prostitute that resulted initially in his suspension, and ultimately defrocking, by the Assemblies of God. Three years later Swaggart was implicated in another scandal involving a prostitute. As a result, Swaggart's ministry became non-affiliated, non-denominational and significantly smaller than it was in the ministry's pre-scandal years.\n\nSwaggart's exposure came as retaliation for an incident in 1986 when Swaggart exposed fellow Assemblies of God minister Marvin Gorman, who had been accused of having several affairs. Once exposed, Gorman was defrocked from the Assemblies of God, his ministry all but ended. As a retaliatory move, Gorman hired his son Randy and son-in-law Garland Bilbo to stake out the Travel Inn on Airline Highway in Baton Rouge. A camera with a telephoto lens was placed in the window of the motel's Room 12, and was draped with a black cloth. When Swaggart arrived, he reportedly went into Room 7. Randy Gorman and Garland Bilbo let the air out of the tires on Swaggart's vehicle. They called Marvin Gorman, whose church was located nearby. Randy Gorman and Garland Bilbo had taken photos of Swaggart outside Room 7 with Debra Murphree, a local prostitute. Gorman arrived at the Travel Inn a short while later and asked Swaggart what he was doing there.\n\nAccording to \"Swaggart: The Unauthorized Biography of an American Evangelist,\" by Ann Rowe Seaman, Gorman secured a promise from Swaggart that he would publicly apologize to Gorman and start the process of Gorman's reinstatement to the Assemblies of God. Gorman offered to remain silent if Swaggart would state publicly that he lied about Gorman's affairs. Gorman waited almost a year, then hand-delivered a note to Swaggart informing him his time was up; Swaggart did not respond. On February 16, 1988, Gorman contacted James Hamil, one of the 13-man Executive Presbytery of the Assemblies of God, who called Raymond Carlson, the Assemblies Superintendent. Carlson summoned Hamill and Gorman to fly to Assemblies of God headquarters in Springfield, Missouri and arranged for an emergency meeting of the presbyters. He was shown photos of several men coming in and going out of Room 7 at the Travel Inn Motel in New Orleans. This was done to establish that the room was being used for prostitution. One of the men seen leaving Room 7 was Swaggart. The presbytery leadership of the Assemblies of God decided that Swaggart should be suspended from broadcasting his television program for three months.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Murphree, who claimed to have posed nude for Swaggart, failed a polygraph test administered by a New York City Police Department polygraph expert. The test administrator concluded that Murphree had failed to tell the truth on all key questions concerning her statement. The test was administered after Murphree offered to sell the story to the \"National Enquirer\" for $100,000. Paul Levy, senior editor for the \"Enquirer\", stated that the polygraph examiner had concluded Murphree was not truthful on six key questions, including one in which she was reportedly asked if she had fabricated the story. Levy stated that the \"Enquirer\" decided not to print her story due to the test results, her drug use, and the fact that she had arrest warrants in three states. Murphree failed questions about whether she was paid or promised money to \"set up\" Swaggart, and whether she made up the story in order to make money from it. Both times she answered no; according to the polygraph examiner, her answers were untrue.\n\nOn February 21, 1988, without giving any details regarding his transgressions, Swaggart gave his now-infamous \"I have sinned\" speech. He tearfully spoke to his family, congregation, TV audience, and finally said \"I have sinned against You, my Lord, and I would ask that Your Precious Blood would wash and cleanse every stain until it is in the seas of God's forgetfulness, not to be remembered against me anymore.\"\n\nThe Louisiana presbytery of the Assemblies of God initially suspended Swaggart from the ministry for three months. The national presbytery of the Assemblies of God soon extended the suspension to their standard two-year suspension for sexual immorality. His return to the pulpit coincided with the end of a three-month suspension originally ordered by the Assemblies. Believing that Swaggart was not genuinely repentant in submitting to their authority, the hierarchy of the Assemblies of God immediately defrocked him, removing his credentials and ministerial license.\n\nSwaggart then became an independent non-denominational Pentecostal minister, establishing Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, based in the Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and the Sonlife Broadcasting Network (SBN) can be seen in the United States, as well as many other countries across the world.\n\nOn October 11, 1991, Swaggart was found in the company of a prostitute for a second time. He was pulled over by a police officer in Indio, California, for driving on the wrong side of the road. With him in the vehicle was a woman named Rosemary Garcia. According to Garcia, Swaggart had stopped to proposition her on the side of the road. She later told reporters, \"He asked me for sex. I mean, that's why he stopped me. That's what I do. I'm a prostitute.\" This time, rather than confessing to his congregation, Swaggart told those at Family Worship Center, \"The Lord told me it's flat none of your business.\" Swaggart's son Donnie then announced to the stunned audience that his father would be temporarily stepping down as head of Jimmy Swaggart Ministries for \"a time of healing and counseling.\"\n\n Jimmy Swaggart Ministries mainly comprised Family Worship Center, \"The Jimmy Swaggart Telecast\", radio and television programs called \"A Study in the Word\", \"SonLife Radio Network\", a website, JSM.org; and a 24/7 cable and satellite television network, SonLife Broadcasting Network (SBN).\n\nSwaggart's wife Frances hosts a television program, \"Frances and Friends,\" shown daily on SBN. Swaggart also hosts a daily Bible study program on SBN, \"The Message of the Cross\". His son Donnie preaches at Family Worship Center and also preaches in churches across America and abroad. Donnie's son Gabriel is the ministry's youth pastor who leads \"Crossfire,\" Family Worship Center's youth ministry. SBN also broadcasts all weekly services at Family Worship Center live, as well as their camp meetings.\n\nSwaggart started SonLife Radio on the noncommercial FM band. Unlike his previous stations, SonLife was commercial-free and did not sell time to outside ministries; the preaching and teaching were all produced in-house. The music played was primarily Southern Gospel. SonLife Radio can be received in 22 U.S. states and is streamed on the Internet.\nSome controversy arose concerning the ministry raising money for stations that were never built.\n\nIn 1973, Swaggart proposed to television producers in Nashville, Tennessee a television program including a fairly large music segment, a short sermon, and time for talking about current ministry projects, after two faltering attempts to tape the half-hour program in Baton Rouge and New Orleans. They accepted, and within weeks the \"Jimmy Swaggart Telecast\" was being broadcast around the United States.\n\nIn 1981, Swaggart launched a daily television program titled \"A Study in the Word\". From the beginning, the primary cable channels the program was aired on were CBN Cable (now Freeform), TBN, and the old PTL Network (now the Inspiration Network).\n\nIn 2010, Jimmy Swaggart Ministries launched a 24 hour-a-day television network entitled the Sonlife Broadcasting Network (SBN), on DirecTV channel 344, Dish Network channel 257, Glorystar channel 125, AT&T U-verse, Verizon Fios, and various cable TV providers and broadcast stations.\n\nSBN is available in the U.S. through Free To Air (FTA) satellite television. It is also available in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSBN is also available 24 hours a day in the United Kingdom on SKY (Channel 593), Freesat (Channel 695) and Freeview (Channel 239)\n\nIn autumn 1984, Swaggart opened Jimmy Swaggart Bible College (\"JSBC\"). The college originally provided education and communication degrees. It flourished during the 1980s, reaching an enrollment of 1,450 students in the fall of 1987. \n\nJSBC enrollment dropped drastically in 1988 when students left as a result of Swaggart's scandal with Debra Murphree, followed by accreditation issues. In 1988 the enrollment at the Bible college was projected to drop 72% that year but the school was planning to proceed with plans to open a theological seminary. Enrollment in August 1988 was projected to be about 400 students, compared to 1,451 students last year in 1987. The estimate was based on the number of students who had registered and the inquiries from potential students. In July 1988 the college dormitories were re-branded and listed as apartments.\n\nIn 1991, after Swaggart was found in the presence of a prostitute in California, JSBC was renamed to World Evangelism Bible College and enrollment dropped to 370 students. The college shut down programs in music, physical education, secretarial science, and communications that October and disbanded its basketball team. \n\nPresently, JSBC offers short term certificate programs, Associate of Arts degree programs, and a four-year Bachelor's degree program.\n\nThe College is not accredited but is currently seeking accreditation \n\nSwaggart has written about 20 Christian books offered through his ministry. He is the author of the \"Expositor's Study Bible\", 13 study guides and 38 commentaries on the Bible. The ministry also publishes a monthly magazine, \"The Evangelist\".\n\nSince October 10, 1952, Swaggart has been married to Frances Swaggart ( Anderson) (born August 9, 1937). They have one son, Donnie (born October 18, 1954), named after Jimmy Swaggart's brother who died in infancy. He has three grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.\n\nDonnie and Gabriel are also preachers, making three generations of the Swaggart family to have become involved in ministerial work.\n\n"}

{"id": "212186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=212186", "title": "Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople", "text": "Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople\n\nThe Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople was an office established as a result of the Fourth Crusade and its conquest of Constantinople in 1204. It was a Roman Catholic replacement for the Eastern Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, and remained in the city until the reconquest of Constantinople by the Byzantines in 1261, whereupon it became a titular see. The office was finally abolished in 1964.\n\nBefore the East–West Schism in 1054, the Christian Church within the borders of the ancient Roman Empire was effectively ruled by five patriarchs (the \"Pentarchy\"): In descending order of precedence: Rome by the Bishop of Rome (who rarely used the title \"Patriarch\") and those of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem.\n\nIn the West the Bishop of Rome was recognized as having superiority over the other Patriarchs, while in the East, the Patriarch of Constantinople gradually came to occupy a leading position. In the East the Pope was generally considered first among equals, but not a direct superior. The sees of Rome and Constantinople were often at odds with one another, just as the Greek and Latin Churches as a whole were often at odds both politically and in things ecclesiastical. There were complex cultural currents underlying these difficulties, including the fact that in the West feudal models began to influence the way of viewing relations within the Church. The tensions led in 1054 to a serious rupture between the Greek East and Latin West called the East–West Schism, which while not in many places absolute, still dominates the ecclesiastical landscape.\n\nIn 1204, the Fourth Crusade invaded, seized and sacked Constantinople, and established the Latin Empire. This was not the doing of the Bishop of Rome, the Pope. Initially he spoke out against the fourth crusade. In writing to his legate the pope said, in part \"How, indeed, is the Greek church to be brought back into ecclesiastical union and to a devotion for the Apostolic See when she has been beset with so many afflictions and persecutions that she sees in the Latins only an example of perdition and the works of darkness, so that she now, and with reason, detests the Latins more than dogs?\" However the popes accepted the acts of the accompanying Catholic clergy who set up a patriarchate subservient in the Western manner to the Pope, in similar manner to what had already occurred in the Crusader states of the Holy Land. The pope recognised these \"Latin\" sees at the Fourth Council of the Lateran. Furthermore, those Orthodox bishops left in their place were made to swear an oath of allegiance to the pope.\n\nWhen the last Latin emperor Baldwin II fled from Constantinople he was well received in Rome by Pope Urban IV who promised him support to regain the throne. This threat of continued support prompted the new Greek emperor to seek out a reunion. Understanding the situation of 1204 helps with the context of the reunion council.\n\nBy establishing communion with the Latin Patriarchs the Papacy in effect made official their position within the Roman Catholic Church. This act was part of a more general picture in which the Crusaders on the one hand established Latin Kingdoms officially acknowledged by the Roman Catholic Church, in the Middle East and in Greece and the Greek Islands, and also in parts of the Balkans. Included were a similar array of Latin episcopal sees.\n\nHowever, the Latin Empire in Constantinople was eventually defeated and dispossessed by a resurgent Byzantium in 1261, and yet the Latin Patriarchate persisted as a titular office with varying vigour.\n\nOn 8 February 1314, Pope Clement V united the Patriarchate with the episcopal see of Negroponte (Chalcis), hitherto a suffragan of the Latin Archbishopric of Athens, so that the patriarchs could once more have a territorial diocese on Greek soil and exercise a direct role as the head of the Latin clergy in what remained of Latin Greece.\n\nFor a time, like many ecclesiastical offices in the West, it had rival contenders who were supporters or protégés of the rival popes. As to the title Latin Patriarch of Constantinople, this was the case at least from 1378 to 1423. Thereafter the office continued as an honorific title, during the later centuries attributed to a leading clergyman in Rome, until it ceased to be assigned after 1948 and was finally abolished in 1964.\n\nA Vicariate Apostolic of Istanbul (until 1990, Constantinople) has existed from 1742 into the present day.\n\n\n\"This title was officially abolished in 1965.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "904847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=904847", "title": "Leon Golub", "text": "Leon Golub\n\nLeon Golub (January 23, 1922 – August 8, 2004) was an American painter. He was born in Chicago, Illinois, where he also studied, receiving his BA at the University of Chicago in 1942, and his BFA and MFA at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1949 and 1950, respectively.\n\nHe was married to and collaborated with the artist Nancy Spero (1926 – October 18, 2009). Their son Stephen Golub is an economics professor at Swarthmore College. Their son Philip Golub is Professor of International and Comparative Politics at the American University of Paris and was a longstanding contributing editor of the influential journal \"Le Monde diplomatique\". Their youngest son Paul Golub is a theater director and acting teacher working in France.\n\nBorn in Chicago in 1922, Golub received his B.A. in Art History from the University of Chicago in 1942. From 1947 to 1949 he studied under the G.I. Bill at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). The student body included a large number of vets, including Golub’s one-time flatmate Cosmo Campoli, George Cohen, Theodore Halkin and Seymour Rosofsky, whose work often reflected the horrors of war, as well as the uncertainties of the Cold War and Nuclear age. It was at SAIC that he met the artist Nancy Spero, to whom he was married for nearly fifty years. Golub helped organize and showed in the seminal Momentum Exhibitions of 1948–1949, put together by SAIC and Institute of Design students in protest over their exclusion from the Art Institute’s prestigious \"Annual Exhibition by Artists of Chicago and Vicinity.\" He was also featured, along with Campoli, Halkin and Rosofsky, in the Art Institute’s \"Veteran's Exhibition\" of 1948. The group included, in addition to Golub’s aforementioned classmates, June Leaf, H.C. Westermann, Irving Petlin, Evelyn Statsinger, Don Baum, and Arthur Lerner.\n\nIn Chicago, Golub became involved with other artists collectively dubbed the \"Monster Roster\" by critic Franz Schulze in the late 1950s, based on their affinity for sometimes gruesome, expressive figuration, fantasy and mythology, and existential thought. They believed that an observable connection to the external world and to actual events was essential if art was to have any relevance to the viewer or society. This is a view that informed Golub's work throughout his career.\n\nGolub, and the group, gained notice in the 1950s when art historian and curator Peter Selz featured him, Campoli and Cohen in a 1955 \"ARTnews\" article, \"Is There a New Chicago School?\", and included him, Campoli and Westermann in the 1959 Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) exhibition, \"New Images of Man\", as examples of vanguard expressive figurative work in Europe and the United States. In later years, the Monster Roster would be regarded as forerunners to the more widely known Chicago Imagists.\n\nGolub, who always painted in a figural style, drew upon diverse representations of the body from ancient Greek and Roman sculpture, to photographs of athletic competitions, to gay pornography; often pulled directly from a huge database he assembled of journalistic images from the mass media. He likened his painting process to sculptural technique and employed a method of layering and scraping away paint, sometimes using a meat cleaver, leaving varying amounts of canvas untouched.\n\nFrom 1959 through 1964, Golub and his wife Nancy Spero opted to live in Europe, a move occasioned in part by the belief that Europe would be more receptive to their work dealing overtly with issues of power, sexual and political. During this period Golub's work increased in size because of larger available studio space and the inspiration of the French tradition of large-scale history painting. He also switched from using lacquer to acrylics, left more of the surface unpainted, and began to grind the paint directly into the canvas. While in Italy, both Golub and Spero were profoundly influenced by the figurative works of Etruscan and Roman art, whose narratives addressed ancient themes of power and violence.\n\nWhen Golub returned to New York State, the Vietnam War was escalating, and he responded with his two series: Napalm and Vietnam. He and Spero became active with \"Artists and Writers Protest\", \"the first such group to take a public stand against the war\". In 1967 as part of the group's \"Angry Arts Week\", Golub organized \"The Collage of Indignation\", a collaborative work by over 150 artists which he described as \"not political art, but rather an expression of popular revulsion.\"\n\nGolub had a career breakthrough that same year when he was selected to exhibit five paintings at the Museum of Modern Art's \"New Images of Man\" show in New York City. His work was included alongside that of such established and rising artists as Willem de Kooning, Francis Bacon and Jackson Pollock.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Golub was beset with self-doubt. He destroyed or cut up many works he produced up to this period and nearly abandoned painting. In the late seventies, however, he produced more than a hundred portraits of public figures, among them political leaders, dictators, and religious figures. \"Leon Golub: Paintings, 1950-2000\" includes several portraits of Nelson Rockefeller and Ho Chi Minh, along with images of Fidel Castro, Francisco Franco, Richard Nixon, and Henry Kissinger.\n\nIn the 1980s, Golub turned his attention to terrorism in a variety of forms, from the subversive operations of governments to urban street violence. Killing fields, torture chambers, bars, and brothels became inspiration and subject for work that dealt with such themes as violent aggression, racial inequality, gender ambiguity, oppression, and exclusion. Among the work produced in this period are the series \"Mercenaries\", \"Interrogation\", \"Riot\", and \"Horsing Around\". His \"Interrogation II\" (1981; Art Institute of Chicago) is representative of the subject from this period and Golub's technique, \"the canvas painted, scraped and repainted many times to create a tense, skinlike surface.\"\n\nFrom the nineties to his death, Golub's work shifted toward the illusionistic, with forms semi-visible, and appropriated graphic styles from ancient carvings, medieval manuscripts, and contemporary graffiti. As an older man he began to consider his own mortality, and moved toward themes of separation, loss, and death. Text appeared in many of the paintings combined with a series of symbolic references, including dogs, lions, skulls, and skeletons.\n\nGolub's work was seen in solo exhibitions throughout the world, among them \"World Wide\" (1991), a Grand Lobby project at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. For \"World Wide\" the artist created a process, repeated in exhibitions at several other museums, by which he enlarged images and details from his paintings and screened them on transparent sheets of vinyl, hung so that they surround the viewer.

These would be the only stained glass windows Leon Golub ever did. They were fabricated in New York by Victor Rothman and Gene Mallard.\n\nWhile Leon Golub's later works from the 1990s offer more fragmented (in his words \"left-over\") reincarnations of his early messages, it is his larger, carved works, vividly depicting power relations that have re-gained attention with the U.S.'s involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIn 2003, Golub revisited his 1959 painting, \"Reclining Youth\", part of a series of paintings inspired by friezes at the Great Altar of Zeus in Pergamon. Working with Magnolia Editions, the artist translated the painting into a large-scale [] Jacquard tapestry, his first and only textile work.\n\nFrom March to May 2015 the Serpentine Gallery in London held a career retrospective which was \"spun off\" and presented as a three-floor career retrospective at the Manhattan Hauser & Wirth in June 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Lithuania converted to Christianity in 1387, but elements of Lithuanian mythology survived into the 19th century. The earliest written sources, authored by foreigners and Christians, only briefly mention the Lithuanian gods. Beginning in the 16th century, the pagan religion received more attention from authors, but often their accounts were confused, contradictory, and heavily influenced by various religious agendas. Collection and recording of folklore began in the 19th century, by which time the pagan mythology had become fragmented and mixed with Christian traditions. The cults of old deities transformed into folklore (individual tales, myths, songs, etc.) without associated rituals. Because of such difficulties obtaining data, there is no accepted list of Lithuanian gods. Different authors present wildly contradictory reconstructions of the Lithuanian pantheon.\n\nThis section includes the names of gods, divine or demonic beings, and other personages from Lithuanian myths, legends, folklore, and fairy-tales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome names from Lithuanian mythology are also found in Russian chronicles of the 13th century. These deities were secretly worshiped by King of Lithuania Mindaugas after his baptism. Russian chronicles are considered the best source of information about the ancient Lithuanian pantheon worshiped by nobles and the military.\n\n\nMartynas Mažvydas in his Latin introduction to \"Catechismusa Prasty Szadei\" (1547) urged the people to abandon their pagan ways and mentioned the following gods:\n\nMaciej Stryjkowski (1547–1593) was a Polish–Lithuanian historian and author of \"Chronicle of Poland, Lithuania, Samogitia and all Russia\".

This 18-page treatise contained a lists of 76 Lithuanian gods with brief description of their functions. Łasicki obtained most of his information from Łaszkowski, a Polish lesser noble who worked as a royal land surveyor. The list contained very minor deities, representing everyday household items. Łasicki was also not intimately familiar with Lithuanian culture or language. Therefore, the academic opinion on the list ranges from a valuable resource to a practical joke designed to poke fun of Christian saints through an inverted mirror. Deities mentioned by Jan Łasicki were:\n\nDeities mentioned by Matthäus Prätorius (1635–1704) were:\n\n\nPolish-Lithuanian historian Theodor Narbutt wrote the ten-volume work \"History of the Lithuanian Nation\" (\"Dzieje starożytne narodu litewskiego\") between 1835 and 1841.

Thus, some gods mentioned only by Narbutt and unknown from other sources are usually treated as inventions of the author.\n\n\n\nThis section contains those names of Lithuanian and Prussian gods or other mythical beings that are mentioned in old treatises on history or philosophy, sometimes accompanied by brief descriptions, and which are known from a few independent sources or from their counterparts under different names in later collections of myths and tales.\n\n\nNames of figures that were more marginal in Lithuanian mythology or less known from existing sources are put here.

The couple's only daughter and child was Dina Wadia, who died in 2017.\n\nRattanbai was the daughter of Lady Dina Petit and Sir Dinshaw Petit 2nd Baronet Petit, who in turn, was the son of Dinshaw Maneckji Petit, a member of the Petit family and the founder of the first cotton mills in India.\n\nRattanbai Petit (often informally called \"Ruttie\") was born on 20 February 1900 in Bombay, British India, into an extremely affluent and well-connected business family belonging to the Parsi community. She was the only daughter of businessman Sir Dinshaw Petit, the second baronet of Petits, and his wife Lady Dinabai Petit. Her paternal grandfather, Dinshaw Maneckji Petit, the first baronet, had built some of the earliest cotton mills in India. Her brother, Fali, who became Sir Dinshaw Maneckji Petit, 3rd Baronet, married Sylla Tata, the sister of J. R. D. Tata, would later become the longest serving chairman of the Tata Group, one of India's leading business conglomerates.\n\nMuhammad Ali Jinnah, then 40, was only three years younger than Ruttie's father, and the two men were good friends. Jinnah was a frequent guest at Petit Hall, the sprawling seaside residence of the Petit family at the foot of Malabar Hill in Mumbai. It was in this setting that Ruttie and Jinnah became acquainted. Their romance, however, started in Darjeeling, while the two were thrown together on a vacation by her unsuspecting family. Despite an age difference of twenty-four years, and the fact that Ruttie was hardly sixteen years old at this time, the two decided to get married. \n\nJinnah broached the topic with his friend by first discussing the question of interfaith and inter-community marriages, always a hot potato in India. Here he was sure of drawing a favorable response from the baronet. Having drawn his friend out to make a general statement in support of mixed marriages, Jinnah then made his proposal to marry his friend's daughter. The baronet was shocked beyond words; he had never imagined anything other than a benign paternalistic relationship between his friend and his daughter. He reacted with violent indignation to the idea and almost ordered Jinnah out of his house. From the Petits' point of view, it was not just the question of religion, but also that of the age difference, especially given that Jinnah was 40, that appalled them.\n\n\"She was, after all, not yet sixteen, an age when modern parents of the new century did not expect their daughters to rush into marriage, although in more conventional homes girls were either betrothed or already married by that age. Sir Dinshaw’s only sister, Hamabai, after having gone to a French boarding school in Nice for her baccalaureate, was still single at twenty-nine and not an eyebrow was raised.\"\n\nSince Ruttie was underage, her father was able to prevent the marriage for the time being, and the matter brewed for more than a year with no resolution. Ruttie was the only daughter (she had three brothers) of her parents, and they always celebrated her birthday in grand style. Despite the tensions within the family, they could hardly give her coming-of-age birthday a miss, and a grand banquet was held on the occasion at the Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai. After the baronet had regaled his guests with a witty after-dinner speech, Ruttie stood up saying \"Thank you, Papa...\" and went on to drop a bombshell. She calmly informed the gathering that she had accepted a proposal of marriage from Jinnah, and that they would be married shortly; she asked the audience to wish them joy. She sat down to thundering silence, but despite the palpable outrage and opposition, a matter which had become so public could not be undone, and Ruttie could not be persuaded to change her mind. Even to the end, her parents could never reconcile themselves to the turn of events. Their objections were manifold: the difference of religion, the vast difference in age, the feeling of having been betrayed by a man they had always regarded as a friend. When the time came for Ruttie to abandon the Parsi religion and be received into the Muslim community, she was disowned and thrown off by her family and had to leave her father's house forthwith. In 1918, only weeks after her 18th birthday, Ruttie converted to Islam, married the 42-year-old Muhammad Ali Jinnah, in an Islamic wedding, and cut all ties with her family and the Parsi community.<ref name=\"dawn/3march2012\"></ref>\n\nThe Jinnah's resided mainly at South Court Mansion in Malabar Hill, a stone's throw from Petit Hall. However, there was no contact between them and the Petit family, and the estrangement continued even after the birth of Ruttie's only child, Dina Jinnah, the following year. In addition to the estrangement from her own family, Ruttie was also ex-communicated from the Parsi Community with extraordinary measures and censure, and a near complete ostracization from their social gatherings.\n\nRuttie and Jinnah also made frequent trips to Europe and spent considerable lengths of time there. They made for a head-turning couple, not just because they looked an unlikely mismatched pair, but also because Ruttie aspired to define the acme of fashion and money was no object. Her long hair would be decked in fresh flowers, she wore vibrant silks and chiffon's, accentuated by headbands and tiaras lavish with diamonds, rubies and emeralds. Jinnah doted on his child-like bride and indulged her every wish, and she was likewise content to be pampered by her beloved husband whom she called “J”. According to most sources, the couple could not have been happier in their first few years of marriage. Their only child, Dina Jinnah, was born on 15 August 1919.\n\nJinnah's own sister Fatima Jinnah, who had been a ward of Jinnah from age eight, since their father's death in 1901, was not amenable to the marriage either. In an attempt to make way for the new bride, Fatima was initially bundled off to another sister's home, but later had come to spending her Sundays at the Jinnah residence at South Court. The young Ruttie, already a mother at 19, found that she was no longer the sole recipient of Jinnah's attentions. It did not help that she and Fatima were of very different temperaments. Ruttie had even yelled at Fatima (considered dour, and very close in personal characteristics in her austerity and fastidiousness, to Jinnah) once, upon seeing her reading the Quran regularly, “the Quran is a book to be talked about, not to be read!” Jinnah enrolled Fatima in a Dental College in 1919. In 1923, he also helped Fatima Jinnah setup her own clinic in Bombay. Yet, this did little in bridging the gap that had developed between Jinnah and Ruttie.\n\nBy mid-1922, Jinnah was facing political isolation (almost reflecting Ruttie's own ex-communication from the Parsi Community), as he devoted every spare moment to be the voice of separatist incitement in a nation torn by Hindu-Muslim antipathy. His increasingly late hours and the ever-increasing distance between them left Ruttie feeling neglected. The marriage deteriorated rapidly within months after the birth of their child. Jinnah expected that after the birth of their child, Ruttie should stop behaving like a child herself and discharge the role of wife and mother in a more traditional mould. Her continuing irresponsibility, self-absorption and elfin childishness were no longer charming but had turned irksome to him. His own interests and pursuits - Muslim welfare, social issues, the question of home rule - were as serious and solemn as hers were floozie and feckless, connected to clothes, jewels, parties and foreign excursions. Both of them were utterly absorbed in their own interests and looked upon the other as being unbending and unmanageable. Both of them left their daughter to the care of nannies and governesses and otherwise neglected her so completely that the child was not even given a name until the age of nine. Jinnah found it convenient to play sugar daddy by keeping Ruttie supplied with money - for which her appetite was enormous - if it would keep her reasonably happy and out of his way, but Ruttie craved not only luxury but also great attention. While on the one hand neglecting her own child so much as to make that a topic of discussion across their circle in Bombay, Ruttie on the other hand demanded that her husband be in an incessant and continuous state of courtship, doting on her, pampering her and attending to her every need every moment of every day. Such a situation had indeed prevailed for a brief period when Jinnah had been a lonely childless widower and Ruttie a frothy, vivacious teenager. That infatuation had worn out, and Jinnah found the demands made on him onerous and vexatious. The change was not something which Ruttie could understand or accept. Her complex relationship with her husband can be gleaned by reading some extracts of her last letter to him:\n\nJinnah, on the other hand, confided to a friend, “she was a child, I shouldn’t have married her. It was my mistake”. Further, in an irony of sorts, his own stance on inter-faith and inter-community marriages was challenged when his daughter Dina decided to marry a Christian-Parsi industrialist from Bombay. In an almost exact way Sir Dinshaw Petit and Ruttie had clashed, Jinnah too clashed with his own daughter over her desire to marry outside the Muslim community. Mahommedali Currim Chagla, who was Jinnah’s assistant at the time, writes in his autobiography Roses in December: “Jinnah asked Dina ‘there are millions of Muslim boys in India, is he the only one you were waiting for?’ and Dina replied ‘there were millions of Muslim girls in India, why did you marry my mother then?’”\n\nJinnah is seen as a very private person who hardly showed his emotions, but he is known to have wept twice in public, and both occasions were connected to Ruttie. One of the occasions was Ruttie's funeral in 1929, and the other was in August 1947, when he visited her grave one last time before leaving for Pakistan. Jinnah left India in August 1947, never to return again.\n\nAfter Ruttie's death, it appeared that Jinnah missed her a great deal. G. Allana wrote a biography of Jinnah entitled \"Quaid-i-Azam Jinnah: The Story of a Nation,\" and he relates an anecdote made known to him by Jinnah's chauffeur. He quoted the chauffeur thus:\n\n"}
{"id": "50328762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50328762", "title": "Religious syncretism", "text": "Religious syncretism\n\nReligious syncretism exhibits blending of two or more religious belief systems into a new system, or the incorporation into a religious tradition of beliefs from unrelated traditions. It is contrasted by the idea of multiple religious belonging and polytheism, respectively.\n\nThis can occur for many reasons, and the latter scenario happens quite commonly in areas where multiple religious traditions exist in proximity and function actively in the culture, or when a culture is conquered, and the conquerors bring their religious beliefs with them, but do not succeed in entirely eradicating the old beliefs or, especially, practices.\n\nReligions may have syncretic elements to their beliefs or history, but adherents of so-labeled systems often frown on applying the label, especially adherents who belong to \"revealed\" religious systems, such as the Abrahamic religions, or any system that exhibits an exclusivist approach. Such adherents sometimes see syncretism as a betrayal of their pure truth. By this reasoning, adding an incompatible belief corrupts the original religion, rendering it no longer true. Indeed, critics of a specific syncretistic trend may sometimes use the word \"syncretism\" as a disparaging epithet, as a charge implying that those who seek to incorporate a new view, belief, or practice into a religious system actually distort the original faith. The consequence, according to Keith Ferdinando, is a fatal compromise of the dominant religion's integrity. Non-exclusivist systems of belief, on the other hand, may feel quite free to incorporate other traditions into their own. \n\nIn modern secular society, religious innovators sometimes create new religions syncretically as a mechanism to reduce inter-religious tension and enmity, often with the effect of offending the original religions in question. Such religions, however, do maintain some appeal to a less exclusivist audience. Discussions of some of these blended religions appear in the individual sections below.\n\nClassical Athens was exclusive in matters of religion. The Decree of Diopeithes made the introduction of and belief in foreign gods a criminal offence and only Greeks were allowed to worship in Athenian temples and festivals as foreigners were considered impure.\n\nOn the other hand, Athens imported many foreign cults, including those of Cybele and the Thracian goddess Bendis, and in some cases this involved a merging of identities: for example, Heracles, who had traditionally been regarded as a mortal hero, began here and elsewhere in the Aegean world to be identified as a divine (Olympian) figure, perhaps under the influence of Eastern counterparts like the Tyrian Melqart.\n\nSyncretism functioned as a feature of Hellenistic Ancient Greek religion, although only outside of Greece. Overall, Hellenistic culture in the age that followed Alexander the Great itself showed syncretist features, essentially blending of Mesopotamian, Persian, Anatolian, Egyptian (and eventually Etruscan–Roman) elements within an Hellenic formula. The Egyptian god Amun developed as the Hellenized \"Zeus Ammon\" after Alexander the Great went into the desert to seek out his oracle at Siwa.\n\nSuch identifications derive from \"interpretatio graeca\", the Hellenic habit of identifying gods of disparate mythologies with their own. When the proto-Greeks (peoples whose language would evolve into Greek proper) first arrived in the Aegean and on the mainland of modern-day Greece early in the 2nd millennium BCE, they found localized nymphs and divinities already connected with every important feature of the landscape: mountain, cave, grove and spring all had their own locally venerated deity. The countless epithets of the Olympian gods reflect their syncretic identification with these various figures. One defines \"Zeus Molossos\" (worshipped only at Dodona) as \"the god identical to Zeus as worshipped by the Molossians at Dodona\". Much of the apparently arbitrary and trivial mythic fabling results from later mythographers' attempts to explain these obscure epithets.\n\nThe Romans, identifying themselves as common heirs to a very similar civilization, identified Greek deities with similar figures in the Etruscan-Roman tradition, though without usually copying cult practices. (For details, see Interpretatio graeca.) Syncretic gods of the Hellenistic period found also wide favor in Rome: Serapis, Isis and Mithras, for example. Cybele as worshipped in Rome essentially represented a syncretic East Mediterranean goddess. The Romans imported the Greek god Dionysus into Rome, where he merged with the Latin mead god \"Liber\", and converted the Anatolian Sabazios into the Roman Sabazius.\n\nThe degree of correspondence varied: Jupiter makes perhaps a better match for Zeus than the rural huntress Diana does for the feared Artemis. Ares does not quite match Mars. The Romans physically imported the Anatolian goddess Cybele into Rome from her Anatolian cult-center Pessinos in the form of her original aniconic archaic stone idol; they identified her as \"Magna Mater\" and gave her a matronly, iconic image developed in Hellenistic Pergamum.\n\nLikewise, when the Romans encountered Celts and Germanic peoples, they mingled these peoples' gods with their own, creating Sulis Minerva, Apollo Sucellos (Apollo the Good Smiter) and Mars Thingsus (Mars of the war-assembly), among many others. In the \"Germania\", the Roman historian Tacitus speaks of Germanic worshippers of Hercules and Mercury; most modern scholars tentatively identify Hercules as Thor and Mercury as Odin.\n\nRomans were familiar with the concept of syncretism because from their earliest times they had experienced it with, among others, the Greeks. The Romans incorporated the originally Greek Apollo and Hercules into their religion. They did not look at the religious aspects that they adopted from other cultures to be different or less meaningful from religious aspects that were Roman in origin. The early Roman acceptance of other cultures religions into their own made it easy for them to integrate the newly encountered religions they found as a result of their expansion.\n\nGnosticism is identified as an early form of syncretism that challenged the beliefs of early Christians. Gnostic dualism posited that only spiritual or invisible things were good, and that material or visible things were evil. Orthodox Christians have always insisted that matter is essentially good, since, as they believe, God created all things, both spiritual and material, and said that it was \"very good\". Simon Magus appears as one of the early proponents of Gnosticism, and is considered by some as one of its founders. He was denounced by many Church authorities, including Peter himself, and is regarded by some as the source of all heresies.\n\nIn the first few centuries after the death of Jesus, there were various competing \"Jesus movements\". The Roman emperors used syncretism to help unite the expanding empire. Social conversion to Christianity happened all over Europe. It became even more effective when missionaries concurred with established cultural traditions and interlaced them into a fundamentally Christian synthesis.\n\nSyncretism is distinguished from assimilation, the latter of which refers the Church's ability to \"incorporate into herself all that is true, good, and beautiful in the world.\" This idea was present in the early Church; the \"Second Apology of Justin Martyr\" states: \"Whatever things were rightly said among all men, are the property of us Christians\". The Church has assimilated many (though not all) of the ideas of Plato and Aristotle. Augustine of Hippo is remembered for assimilating the ideas of Plato, while Thomas Aquinas is known for doing so with the ideas of Aristotle. In his essay on the development of Christian doctrine, John Henry Newman clarified the idea of assimilation.\n\nIn \"Moses and Monotheism\", Sigmund Freud made a case for Judaism arising out of the pre-existing monotheism that was briefly imposed upon Egypt during the rule of Akhenaten. The Code of Hammurabi is also cited as a likely starting point for the Jewish Ten Commandments. Some scholars hold that Judaism refined its concept of monotheism and adopted features such as its eschatology, angelology and demonology through contacts with Zoroastrianism.\n\nIn spite of the Jewish halakhic prohibitions on polytheism, idolatry, and associated practices (\"Avodah Zarah\"), several combinations of Judaism with other religions have sprung up: Messianic Judaism, Jewish Buddhism, Nazarenism and Judeo-Paganism. Several Jewish Messiah claimants (such as Jacob Frank) and the Sabbateans came to mix Kabbalistic Judaism with Christianity and Islam. Until relatively recently, China had a Jewish community which had adopted some Confucian practices.\n\nThe Islamic mystical tradition known as Sufism appears somewhat syncretic in nature in its origins, but it is rejected by many other modern scholars . A better explanation is that,\nMainstream Tasawwuf does not present itself as a separate set of beliefs from the mainstream Sunni tradition; well-established traditions like Naqshbandi, Qadiri, Shadhili, and most others have always been part and parcel of normative Islamic life. No doubt some groups in the name of Sufism, just like in any religion, do espouse theologically unorthodox positions.\n\nDuring Sufi presence in Bengal, Muslim–Hindu syncretism was a general trend, and Nabibangsha by Syed Sultan is an example of it. The book tells the lineage of the prophets of Islam. Apart from Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus Christ, the poet also describes Indian deities such as Brahma, Vishnu, Rama and Krishna.\n\nThe Barghawata kingdom of Morocco followed a syncretic religion inspired by Islam (perhaps influenced by Judaism) with elements of Sunni, Shi'ite and Kharijite Islam, mixed with astrological and heathen traditions. Supposedly, they had their own Qur'an in the Berber language comprising 80 suras under the leadership of the second ruler of the dynasty Salih ibn Tarif who had taken part in the Maysara uprising. He proclaimed himself a prophet. He also claimed to be the final Mahdi of Islamic tradition, and that Isa (Jesus) would be his companion and pray behind him.\n\nThe Druzes integrated elements of Ismaili Islam with Gnosticism and Platonism. Satpanth is considered as syncretism of Ismaili Islam and Hinduism.\n\nBuddhism has syncretized with many traditional beliefs in East Asian societies as it was seen as compatible with local religions. Notable syncretization of Buddhism with local beliefs includes the Three Teachings, or Triple Religion, that harmonizes Mahayana Buddhism with Confucian philosophy and elements of Taoism, and Shinbutsu-shūgō, which is a syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism. The religious beliefs, practices, and identities of East Asians (who comprise the majority of the world's Buddhists by any measure) often blend Buddhism with other traditions including Confucianism, the Chinese folk religion, Taoism, Shinto, and Korean shamanism. Before and during World War II, a Nichiren Shōshū priest named Jimon Ogasawara proposed the blending of Nichiren Buddhism with Shinto.\n\nHinduism, Buddhism and Jainism in ancient India have made many adaptations over the millennia, assimilating elements of various diverse religious traditions. One example of this is the Yoga Vasistha.\n\nAkram Vigyan Movement established by Dada Bhagwan is considered as a Jain-Vaishnava Hindu syncretistic movement.\n\nThe Mughal emperor Akbar, who wanted to consolidate the diverse religious communities in his empire, propounded Din-i-Ilahi, a syncretic religion intended to merge the best elements of the religions of his empire. Satpanth is considered as syncretism of Ismaili Islam and Hinduism.\n\nMeivazhi is a syncretic monotheistic minority religion based in Tamil Nadu, India. Its focus is spiritual enlightenment and the conquering of death, through the teachings. Mevaizhi preaches the Oneness of essence message of all the previous major scriptures - particularly Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism and Christianity - allowing membership regardless of creed. Meivazhi's disciples are thousands of people belonging once to 69 different castes of different religions being united as one family of Meivazhi Religion.\n\nIn China, most of the population follows syncretist religions combining Mahayana Buddhism, Taoism and elements of Confucianism. Out of all Chinese believers, approximately 85.7% adhere to Chinese traditional religion, as many profess to be both Mahayana Buddhist and Taoist at the same time. Many of the pagodas in China are dedicated to both Buddhist and Taoist deities.\n\nThe traditional Mun faith of the Lepcha people predates their seventh century conversion to Lamaistic Buddhism. Since that time, the Lepcha have practiced it together with Buddhism. Since the arrival of Christian missionaries in the nineteenth century, Mun traditions have been followed alongside that faith as well. The traditional religion permits incorporation of Buddha and Jesus Christ as a deities, depending on household beliefs.\n\nOne can contrast Christian syncretism with contextualization or inculturation, the practice of making Christianity relevant to a culture: \"Contextualisation\" does not address the doctrine but affects a change in the styles or expression of worship. Although Christians often took their European music and building styles into churches in other parts of the world, in a contextualization approach, they would build churches, sing songs, and pray in a local ethnic style. Some Jesuit missionaries adapted local systems and images to teach Christianity, as did the Portuguese in China, the practice of which was opposed by the Dominicans, leading to the Chinese rites controversy.\n\nHistorian Yuval Noah Harari argues in \"\" (2014) that syncretism is pervasive in Christianity, saying that \"In fact, monotheism, as it has played out in history, is a kaleidoscope of monotheist, dualist, polytheist and animist legacies, jumbling together under a single divine umbrella. The average Christian believes in the monotheist God, but also in the dualist Devil, in the polytheist saints, and in animist ghosts.\" (page 223)\n\nSyncretism did not play a role when Christianity split into eastern and western rites during the Great Schism. It became involved, however, with the rifts of the Protestant Reformation, with Desiderius Erasmus's readings of Plutarch. Even earlier, syncretism was a fundamental aspect of the efforts of Neoplatonists such as Marsilio Ficino to reform the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1615, David Pareus of Heidelberg urged Christians to a \"pious syncretism\" in opposing the Antichrist, but few 17th-century Protestants discussed the compromises that might effect a reconciliation with the Catholic Church: Johann Hülsemann, Johann Georg Dorsche and Abraham Calovius (1612–85) opposed the Lutheran Georg Calisen \"Calixtus\" (1586–1656) of the University of Helmstedt for his \"syncretism\". (See: Syncretistic controversy.)\n\nCatholicism in Central and South America has been integrated with a number of elements derived from indigenous and slave cultures in those areas (see the Caribbean and modern sections); while many African Initiated Churches demonstrate an integration of Protestant and traditional African beliefs. The Catholic Church allows some symbols and traditions to be carried over from older belief systems, so long as they are remade to fit into a Christian worldview; syncretism of other religions with Catholicism, such as Voudun or Santería, is condemned by the Roman Catholic Church. The image of Our Lady of Guadalupe and the subsequent devotion to her are seen as assimilating some elements of native Mexican culture into Christianity.\n\nThe Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod has created controversy by disciplining pastors for syncretism when they participated in multi-faith services in response to the 9/11 attacks and to the shootings at Newtown, Connecticut, on the grounds that merely sharing a worship setting with other faiths was in error.\nIn the Latter Day Saint movement, doctrine from previous dispensations as recorded in the LDS canon are considered official, though it is accepted that ancient teachings can be warped, misunderstood, or lost as a result of apostasy. While it does not officially recognize doctrine from other religions, it is believed that truth in other sources can be identified via personal revelation.\n\nCatholicism in South Korea has been syncretized with traditional Mahayana Buddhist and Confucian customs that form an integral part of traditional Korean culture. As a result, South Korean Catholics continue to practice ancestral rites and observe many Buddhist and Confucian customs and philosophies. In Asia the revolutionary movements of Taiping (19th-century China) and God's Army (Karen in the 1990s) blended Christianity with traditional beliefs.\n\nThe Bahá'ís follow Bahá'u'lláh, a prophet whom they consider a successor to Muhammad, Jesus, Moses, Buddha, Zoroaster, Krishna and Abraham. This acceptance of other religious founders has encouraged some to regard the Bahá'í religion as a syncretic faith. However, Bahá'ís and the Bahá'í writings explicitly reject this view. Bahá'ís consider Bahá'u'lláh's revelation an independent, though related, revelation from God. Its relationship to previous dispensations is seen as analogous to the relationship of Christianity to Judaism. They regard beliefs held in common as evidence of truth, progressively revealed by God throughout human history, and culminating in (at present) the Bahá'í revelation. Bahá'ís have their own sacred scripture, interpretations, laws and practices that, for Bahá'ís, supersede those of other faiths.\n\nThe process of syncretism in the Caribbean region often forms a part of cultural creolization. (The technical term \"Creole\" may apply to anyone born and raised in the region, regardless of ethnicity.) The shared histories of the Caribbean islands include long periods of European Imperialism (mainly by Spain, France, and Great Britain) and the importation of African slaves (primarily from Central and Western Africa). The influences of each of the above interacted in varying degrees on the islands, producing the fabric of society that exists today in the Caribbean.\n\nThe Rastafari movement, founded in Jamaica, syncretizes vigorously, mixing elements from the Bible, Marcus Garvey's Pan Africanism movement, a text from the European grimoire tradition, the Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses, Hinduism, and Caribbean culture.\n\nAnother highly syncretic religion of the area, vodou, combines elements of Western African, native Caribbean, and Christian (especially Roman Catholic) beliefs.\n\nRecently developed religious systems that exhibit marked syncretism include the African diasporic religions Candomblé, Vodou and Santería, which analogize various Yorùbá and other African deities to the Roman Catholic saints. Some sects of Candomblé have also incorporated Native American deities, and Umbanda combined African deities with Kardecist spiritualism.\n\nHoodoo is a similarly derived form of folk magic practiced by some African American communities in the Southern United States. Other traditions of syncretic folk religion in North America include Louisiana Voodoo as well as Pennsylvania Dutch Pow-wow, in which practitioners invoke power through the Christian God.\n\nMany historical Native American religious movements have incorporated Christian European influence, like the Native American Church, the Ghost Dance, and the religion of Handsome Lake.\n\nSanto Daime is a syncretic religion founded in Brazil that incorporates elements of several religious or spiritual traditions including Folk Catholicism, Kardecist Spiritism, African animism and indigenous South American shamanism, including \"vegetalismo\".\n\nUnitarian Universalism also provides an example of a modern syncretic religion. It traces its roots to Universalist and Unitarian Christian congregations. However, modern Unitarian Universalism freely incorporates elements from other religious and non-religious traditions, so that it no longer identifies as \"Christian.\"\n\nThe Theosophical Society professes to go beyond being a syncretic movement that combines deities into an elaborate Spiritual Hierarchy, and assembles evidence that points to an underlying (or occult) reality of Being that is universal and interconnected, common to all spirit-matter dualities. It is maintained that this is the source of religious belief, each religion simply casting that one reality through the prism of that particular time and in a way that is meaningful to their circumstances.\n\nUniversal Sufism seeks the unity of all people and religions. Universal Sufis strive to \"realize and spread the knowledge of Unity, the religion of Love, and Wisdom, so that the biases and prejudices of faiths and beliefs may, of themselves, fall away, the human heart overflow with love, and all hatred caused by distinctions and differences be rooted out.\"\n\nIn Vietnam, Caodaism blends elements of Buddhism, Catholicism and Taoism.\n\nSeveral Japanese new religions, such as Konkokyo and Seicho-No-Ie, are syncretistic.\n\nThe Nigerian religion Chrislam combines Christian and Islamic doctrines.\n\nThelema is a mixture of many different schools of belief and practice, including Hermeticism, Eastern Mysticism, Yoga, 19th century libertarian philosophies (i.e. Nietzsche), occultism, and the Kabbalah, as well as ancient Egyptian and Greek religion.\n\nExamples of strongly syncretist Romantic and modern movements with some religious elements include mysticism, occultism, Theosophical Society, modern astrology, Neopaganism, and the New Age movement.\n\nIn Réunion, the Malbars combine elements of Hinduism and Christianity.\n\nThe Unification Church, founded by religious leader Sun Myung Moon in South Korea in 1954. Its teachings are based on the Bible, but include new interpretations not found in mainstream Judaism and Christianity and incorporates Asian traditions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28957716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28957716", "title": "Roman mythology", "text": "Roman mythology\n\nRoman mythology is the body of traditional stories pertaining to ancient Rome's legendary origins and religious system, as represented in the literature and visual arts of the Romans. \"Roman mythology\" may also refer to the modern study of these representations, and to the subject matter as represented in the literature and art of other cultures in any period.\n\nThe Romans usually treated their traditional narratives as historical, even when these have miraculous or supernatural elements. The stories are often concerned with politics and morality, and how an individual's personal integrity relates to his or her responsibility to the community or Roman state. Heroism was an important theme. When the stories illuminate Roman religious practices, they are more concerned with ritual, augury, and institutions than with theology or cosmogony.\n\nThe study of Roman religion and myth is complicated by the early influence of Greek religion on the Italian peninsula during Rome's protohistory, and by the later artistic imitation of Greek literary models by Roman authors. In matters of theology, the Romans were curiously eager to identify their own gods with those of the Greeks (\"interpretatio graeca\"), and to reinterpret stories about Greek deities under the names of their Roman counterparts. Rome's early myths and legends also have a dynamic relationship with Etruscan religion, less documented than that of the Greeks.\n\nWhile Roman mythology may lack a body of divine narratives as extensive as that found in Greek literature, Romulus and Remus suckling the she-wolf is as famous as any image from Greek mythology except for the Trojan Horse. Because Latin literature was more widely known in Europe throughout the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance, the interpretations of Greek myths by the Romans often had a greater influence on narrative and pictorial representations of \"classical mythology\" than Greek sources. In particular, the versions of Greek myths in Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", written during the reign of Augustus, came to be regarded as canonical.\n\nBecause ritual played the central role in Roman religion that myth did for the Greeks, it is sometimes doubted that the Romans had much of a native mythology. This perception is a product of Romanticism and the classical scholarship of the 19th century, which valued Greek civilization as more \"authentically creative.\" From the Renaissance to the 18th century, however, Roman myths were an inspiration particularly for European painting. The Roman tradition is rich in historical myths, or legends, concerning the foundation and rise of the city. These narratives focus on human actors, with only occasional intervention from deities but a pervasive sense of divinely ordered destiny. In Rome's earliest period, history and myth have a mutual and complementary relationship. As T. P. Wiseman notes:\nThe Roman stories still \"matter\", as they mattered to Dante in 1300 and Shakespeare in 1600 and the founding fathers of the United States in 1776. What does it take to be a free citizen? Can a superpower still be a republic? How does well-meaning authority turn into murderous tyranny?\nMajor sources for Roman myth include the \"Aeneid\" of Vergil and the first few books of Livy's history as well as Dionysius' s \"Roman Antiquities\". Other important sources are the \"Fasti\" of Ovid, a six-book poem structured by the Roman religious calendar, and the fourth book of elegies by Propertius. Scenes from Roman myth also appear in Roman wall painting, coins, and sculpture, particularly reliefs.\n\nThe \"Aeneid\" and Livy's early history are the best extant sources for Rome's founding myths. Material from Greek heroic legend was grafted onto this native stock at an early date. The Trojan prince Aeneas was cast as husband of Lavinia, daughter of King Latinus, patronymical ancestor of the Latini, and therefore through a convoluted revisionist genealogy as forebear of Romulus and Remus. By extension, the Trojans were adopted as the mythical ancestors of the Roman people.\n\nThe characteristic myths of Rome are often political or moral, that is, they deal with the development of Roman government in accordance with divine law, as expressed by Roman religion, and with demonstrations of the individual's adherence to moral expectations \"(mos maiorum)\" or failures to do so.\n\n\nNarratives of divine activity played a more important role in the system of Greek religious belief than among the Romans, for whom ritual and cult were primary. Although Roman religion did not have a basis in scriptures and exegesis, priestly literature was one of the earliest written forms of Latin prose. The books \"(libri)\" and commentaries \"(commentarii)\" of the College of Pontiffs and of the augurs contained religious procedures, prayers, and rulings and opinions on points of religious law. Although at least some of this archived material was available for consultation by the Roman senate, it was often \"occultum genus litterarum\", an arcane form of literature to which by definition only priests had access. Prophecies pertaining to world history and to Rome's destiny turn up fortuitously at critical junctures in history, discovered suddenly in the nebulous Sibylline books, which Tarquin the Proud (according to legend) purchased in the late 6th century BC from the Cumaean Sibyl. Some aspects of archaic Roman religion survived in the lost theological works of the 1st-century BC scholar Varro, known through other classical and Christian authors.\nThe earliest pantheon included Janus, Vesta, and a leading so-called Archaic Triad of Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus, whose flamens were of the highest order. According to tradition, Numa Pompilius, the Sabine second king of Rome, founded Roman religion; Numa was believed to have had as his consort and adviser a Roman goddess or nymph of fountains and of prophecy, Egeria. The Etruscan-influenced Capitoline Triad of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva later became central to official religion, replacing the Archaic Triad — an unusual example within Indo-European religion of a supreme triad formed of two female deities and only one male. The cult of Diana became established on the Aventine Hill, but the most famous Roman manifestation of this goddess may be Diana Nemorensis, owing to the attention paid to her cult by J.G. Frazer in the mythographical classic \"The Golden Bough\".\nThe gods represented distinctly the practical needs of daily life, and Ancient Romans scrupulously accorded them the appropriate rites and offerings. Early Roman divinities included a host of \"specialist gods\" whose names were invoked in the carrying out of various specific activities. Fragments of old ritual accompanying such acts as plowing or sowing reveal that at every stage of the operation a separate deity was invoked, the name of each deity being regularly derived from the verb for the operation. Tutelary deities were particularly important in ancient Rome.\n\nThus, Janus and Vesta guarded the door and hearth, the Lares protected the field and house, Pales the pasture, Saturn the sowing, Ceres the growth of the grain, Pomona the fruit, and Consus and Ops the harvest. Even the majestic Jupiter, the ruler of the gods, was honored for the aid his rains might give to the farms and vineyards. In his more encompassing character he was considered, through his weapon of lightning, the director of human activity. Due to his widespread domain, the Romans regarded him as their protector in their military activities beyond the borders of their own community. Prominent in early times were the gods Mars and Quirinus, who were often identified with each other. Mars was a god of war; he was honored in March and October. Modern scholars see Quirinus as the patron of the armed community in time of peace.\n\nThe 19th-century scholar Georg Wissowa thought that the Romans distinguished two classes of gods, the \"di indigetes\" and the \"di novensides\" or \"novensiles\": the \"indigetes\" were the original gods of the Roman state, their names and nature indicated by the titles of the earliest priests and by the fixed festivals of the calendar, with 30 such gods honored by special festivals; the \"novensides\" were later divinities whose cults were introduced to the city in the historical period, usually at a known date and in response to a specific crisis or felt need. Arnaldo Momigliano and others, however, have argued that this distinction cannot be maintained. During the war with Hannibal, any distinction between \"indigenous\" and \"immigrant\" gods begins to fade, and the Romans embraced diverse gods from various cultures as a sign of strength and universal divine favor.\n\nThe absorption of neighboring local gods took place as the Roman state conquered neighboring territories. The Romans commonly granted the local gods of a conquered territory the same honors as the earlier gods of the Roman state religion. In addition to Castor and Pollux, the conquered settlements in Italy seem to have contributed to the Roman pantheon Diana, Minerva, Hercules, Venus, and deities of lesser rank, some of whom were Italic divinities, others originally derived from the Greek culture of Magna Graecia. In 203 BC, Rome imported the cult object embodying Cybele from Pessinus in Phrygia and welcomed its arrival with due ceremony. Both Lucretius and Catullus, poets contemporary in the mid-1st century BC, offer disapproving glimpses of Cybele's wildly ecstatic cult.\n\nIn some instances, deities of an enemy power were formally invited through the ritual of \"evocatio\" to take up their abode in new sanctuaries at Rome.\n\nCommunities of foreigners \"(peregrini)\" and former slaves \"(libertini)\" continued their own religious practices within the city. In this way Mithras came to Rome and his popularity within the Roman army spread his cult as far afield as Roman Britain. The important Roman deities were eventually identified with the more anthropomorphic Greek gods and goddesses, and assumed many of their attributes and myths.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9444637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9444637", "title": "Sayram (city)", "text": "Sayram (city)\n\nSayram (, \"Sayram\", سايرام; , \"Сайром\", سەيرام; \"‘Isfījāb\"; , \"Espījāb/Espijâb\") is a rural locality located in southeastern South Kazakhstan Region on the Sayram Su River, which rises at the nearby 4000-meter mountain Sayram Su. In medieval times, the city and countryside were located on the banks of the Arys River, into which the Sayram Su river flows. It is now a suburb of Shymkent. Population: \n\nThe city celebrated the 3,000th anniversary of its founding in 1999. It is among the oldest cities in Kazakhstan, site of the first mosque in Kazakhstan, and similarly among the oldest cities in Transoxania. Sayram is significant today for maintaining mud-brick architecture and the absence of Soviet-style architecture. There are many pre-20th-century mausoleums, and more continue to be built.\n\nArchaeology in Central Asia was active following its conquest by the Russian Empire, but remains a relatively understudied area. There has been some field work done in the city both before and during the rise of the Soviet Union, and there is likewise renewed interest in the city as one of the oldest cities of the independent country of Kazakhstan. Notable among the archaeological discoveries is evidence of an early plumbing system like the kinds found in Samarqand and other cities of the early Persian empires.\n\nThere is another city named Sayram in Xinjiang, China located between Kucha and Aksu, which, according to local tradition, was founded by captives captured by the Qalmaqs.\n\nThe oldest name of the city according to historical evidence is Isfijab (Espijâb, Isfījāb, Asfījāb), which remained until the Mongol conquest. Mahmud Kashgari mentioned it as the \"White City which is called Isbījāb,\" suggesting its connection with the Soghdian/Persian word for white, \"sipīd\" or \"ispīd\". Kashgari also mentioned that the city was known as Sayram at that time, the name which the town bears today. The Russian Orientalist N. S. Lykoshin suggested that Sayram's correct name was \"Sar-i ayyām\", or 'Ancient of Days'. His editor held, however, that instead of \"ayyām\", it was instead the Arabic \"yamm\", 'sea, river' and referred to the source of a stream. If the name Sayrām is actually Turkic, it probably refers to 'a place of shallow water.' To wit, al-Kāshgharī gives, alongside his entry on Sayrām as the name of Isfijāb, the phrase \"seyrem sūw,\" 'shallow water,' which coincidentally is the name of the river running east of the center of the city. Kāsgharī also later notes the verb \"seyremlen\"-, 'to become shallow,' with the phrase \"sūw seyremlendī\", 'the water became shallow (or scanty)'.\n\nThe modern city of Sayram celebrated its 3,000th year of continued habitation in 1999.\nSayram is a city on the frontier between irrigated farmland and the pastures of the Dasht-i Qipchaq. It has a long history of commercial and political importance as a border town and has been the site of numerous conquests and reconquests.\n\nSome local historians have attempted to find proof of Sayram's prehistory in the holy book of the Zoroastrian faith. They state that the first recorded mention of Sayram is in the Avesta, the holy book of Zoroastrianism. There are several names mentioned, though it is possible they refer to people, places, cities, or geographic features. Historian Richard Frye states that \"even guesses about their identity do not help us in reconstructing history.\" The word appearing in the Avesta is \"Sairima\", which some historians equate with the name Sayram. There is mention of a river, and a land or people called \"Sairima elis\", or people or land of/near Sayram. Sayram would have been a northern border town in the northeastern reaches of the Achaemenid Empire, later conquered by Alexander. There is no mention of Sayram in the histories surrounding the acts of Alexander.\n\nIn the 7th century, the Western Turkic Confederation consisted of five Tu-lu and five Nu-shih-pi tribes, known collectively as the On Oq (Ten Arrows) and by the Chinese as Shih Hsing (Ten Clans). In 642, the \"khaqan\" (khan) of the Tu-lu Turkic tribe took refuge in Isfijab from the Nu-shih-pi.\n\nAfter the expulsion of the heretical sects of Christianity, there came a large number of Christians to Central Asia and the East. Largest among them were the Nestorians, who were condemned at the First Council of Ephesus in 431. There was a community of Nestorian Christians in Sayram when Islam first came to Sayram in 766 AD who resisted conversion. Buddhism was also prevalent in Central Asia at that time.\n\nSayram was already an important trading site in the centuries before the Arab Conquest. Islam was brought to Sayram and its neighboring cities by a detachment of Arabic and Arabic-speaking soldier-missionaries from the already converted lands to the south. Sayram, or Isfijab as it was then known, served as a border town between the Islamic lands and the pagan Turks.\n\nThe Arab Conquest was led by Iskak, known today in Sayram as Iskak-bab. The standard bearer of these soldiers of Islam was ‘Abd al-‘Azīz. One surviving manuscript, entitled \"Nasabname\", tells how the Muslim warriors under Iskak-bab came to Sayram and met with the Nestorian patriarch of Sayram, Nakhibar.\nIskak-bab invited Nakhibar to the true faith. But Nakhibar replied, \"I am a \"tarsa\" (Christian) of the seventieth generation, and my faith is true! That is why I shall fight you.\" Hand-to-hand combat ensued, and lasted for three days and nights. Ten thousand Nestorian \"tarsa\"s and fifteen thousand Muslim missionaries died for their faith. The color-bearer of the Muslim forces was ‘Abd al-‘Azīz.\nThe same manuscript goes on to describe Iskak-bab's building of the first mosque in Sayram, which would make it the first mosque in all of present-day Kazakhstan, as well. \n\n\"After that he set up a Friday mosque in Sayram. The first stone in the foundation was laid by his hands. He sanctified the stone with holy water.\"\nIn 840 AD, the Samanid chief of Samarkand Nūḥ ibn Asad, wrested control of the city from the Turks. In that year, Nūḥ built a wall around it to protect it from the Turks. By this time the city was a flourishing market center at the nexus of nomad and sedentary lands. It was also a linchpin in the broad zone of protective forts built to protect the Samanid empire from nomadic raiders. Moqaddasi numbered these fortresses, or \"ribāṭ\"s, at 1,700. They built outer walls to protect the crops of the inhabitants from raiders, but the town was not only a military outpost. Traders from Bukhara and Samarkand constructed large caravanserais for themselves in Sayram.\n\nSayram was also the main contact between Samanid Islam and the Qaghan Turks of Turpan, Kashgar, and Kucha. The alternate southern routes were controlled by rival factions, leaving the primary route east through Farab and Sayram.\n\nSayram is significant for maintaining a degree of independence from the Samanids, remaining a possession of the local Turkic dynasty. The rulers owed three signs of loyalty to the Samanids: military service, the presentation of symbolic gifts, and the name of the Samanid ruler on minted currency. Sayram at this time was one-third the size of Banākath (now in ruins near present-day Chinoz, Uzbekistan), the chief town of the neighboring district of Shāsh (present-day Tashkent).\n\nSayram was divided into three districts, like others of the time: \"qohandez\" (citadel), \"madīnah\" (inner town), and \"rabaż\" (suburb), the latter two being protected by walls. All the houses were of mud brick. The government center (\"dār al-imārah\"), the prison, and the Friday mosque were all in the inner city. There were four main gates to the inner town, each guarded by a \"ribat\" manned by \"ghāzī\"s (volunteer fighters for the faith) recruited from Bukhara and Samarkand. The ruler of Sayram apparently also exercised some authority within the steppes, since Moqaddasi mentions that the \"king of the Turkmen\" at nearby rdū habitually sent presents to Asfījāb.\n\nThe Qarakhanids seized the city in 980, during the reign of Nuh II of the Samanid Empire. At this time, according to al-Istakhri, the city marked the border between Karluks and Oğuz Turks. Sayram was part of the eastern Qarakhanid khanate based on three cities: Sayram itself, Talas, and Farghāna. Coins were minted there by the Qarakhanid rulers. In the opening years of the 7th/13th century, the district seems to have been taken over by the Qipchaqs of the middle Syr Darya, for the Khorezmshah ʿAlāʾ al-dīn Muḥammad devastated the area beyond the Syr Darya to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Mongol leader Küchlüg.\n\nThe city of Sayram was captured by the Mongols using catapults under the command of the Siet Alahai.\n\nIn 1220, the Taoist monk Qiu Chuji left his home town of Shandong in northern China and traveled to Persia to present himself before Genghis Khan. His fame as a pious exemplar of Taoist belief had preceded him, and his travels carried him over roads newly restored by the Mongols, roads that were then in better condition than when the Russian imperial orientalist V. V. Barthold described them in the early 20th century. Qui Chuji (Chan-Chun, or Чан-чунь in Barthold's work) traveled through the land of the Uyghurs, through Kulja, through Zhetysu, crossing first the Chu River on a wooden bridge, then the Talas River on a bridge of stone, before reaching Sayram in November 1221. The city of Sayram is mentioned in some detail in Qui Chuji's book \"Travels to the Western Regions\", recorded by his disciples after Chuji returned home.\n\nGenghis Khan camped in Sayram, and awaited the arrival of his sons in 1223. Sayram's neighbor to the west was not so lucky, the doomed city of Otrar, also called Utrar or Farab, and the birthplace of Al-Farabi, which was utterly destroyed by the Mongol leader.\n\nThe famous historian Rashid-al-Din (1247–1318）wrote that Sayram was also known as Kary Sailam (Old Sayram). At that time it was a large city with forty gates, and it took one whole day to cross the city.\n\nIt is unclear when the city fell under Timur's rule. Under the Timurids, Sayram was an important border city, a center of trade, and Timur gave rule of the city to his grandson Ulugbek. In 1404, the right wing of Timur's China-bound invasion force wintered in Sayram, Tashkent, and Banākath.\n‘Abd al-Razzāq wrote that in 1410 the fortress of Sayram was besieged by Moghul forces, and by the end of the 15th century was given to Yunus Khan of Moghulistan, where his son was reigning in 1496.\n\nDuring the Ming dynasty, envoy Chen Cheng was sent by the Yongle Emperor to the Timurid khanate and subsequently dedicated one chapter of his book A Record of the Barbarian Countries in the Western Region to Sayram.\n\nToward the end of the Timurid power, in the middle of the 15th century, Sayram was raided regularly (along with Turkestan) by the Moghul amir Mir Haqq-Berdi Bekichek.\n\nShaybani Khan took Sayram in 1503. With the coming of Uzbek power in the region, Sayram fell to Muhammad Shaybani Khan along with the rest of the region. However, peace in the region was elusive. The Kazakhs soon grew in power and Sayram became a common prize of raids and wars between the Kazakhs, Uzbeks, and Qalmaqs.\n\nIn 1512, the keys of the city were given to Qasim Khan, Khan of the Kazakhs when he came to the city. In Babur's account, no khan was as respected or authoritative as Qasim, who could command over 300,000 men.\n\nManṣūr Khān led an Uzbek force against the Kazakhs in 1522 in response to their raids from the region of Sayram into the Farghana. The failure of this expedition to control Kazakh raids effectively ended attempts by the Uzbeks to control Sayram and its region.\n\nThe rise of the collection of Oirat clans into what became known as the Zunghar Khanate in the 1600s saw much of what is now southern Kazakhstan leave the control of the Kazakh Khans. The historian Barthold argued that only after Galdan Boshugtu Khan, the Khong Tayiji of the Zunghars, had successfully conquered and destroyed the power of Sayram did he move his encampment west to the valley of the Ili, ensuring his control of Zhetysu east of Sayram. Galdan sent forces against Sayram in 1681, which must have been unsuccessful because they returned in 1683, when Barthold tells us that his commander Rabtan (probably Tsewang Rabtan took the city and razed it.\n\nSayram was slowly rebuilt, likely with the support of the merchants of Central Asia and the leadership of the Kazakhs. This knowledge comes from the fact that the city appears again as a target of Zunghar aggression forty years later.\n\nIn 1723, the year of the Barefooted Flight of the Kazakhs, Sayram, Turkistān, and Tashkent passed under the control of the Qalmaqs and remained within their control until their destruction by the Chinese in 1758.\n\nThe city of Sayram was taken by the Ming of the Kokand Khanate in 1810. The local Qazaq population, and possibly the local sedentary population, revolted against Kokand control in 1820-1. There is little mention of Sayram in regional histories until its fall to the Russians in 1864, by which time the nearby city of Chimkent had already begun to eclipse Sayram in local importance.\n\nAfter the Russian conquest in 1864, several new villages were founded around Sayram. They were found to be prosperous by I. I. Geier, a local Russian journalist/historian writing in the first decade of the 20th century, though Sayram was still noted for its superior wheat, horse market, historical background, and many tombs.\n\nDuring National delimitation, the area of Sayram was at one point part of the Turkistan ASSR. At that time, the majority of modern-day Kazakhstan, including the steppe regions, were part of the separate Kirgizistan ASSR. After this period of border drawing and redrawing, Sayram eventually became part of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. It remains in the successor independent country of the Kazakh SSR, Kazakhstan.\n\nThe population of over 40,000 is roughly 95% Uzbek, 3% Kazakh, and 1% Russian, with the remainder being Uzbek-speaking Azeris, Chechens, Tajiks, and Iranians. Sayram is a city of observant Muslims, and the call to prayer can be heard from the city's mosques.\n\nThe economy of Kazakhstan being much stronger than Uzbekistan's, Sayram has seen an increase of migrant laborers from Uzbekistan, as well as those coming to stay as permanent residents.\n\nThe citizens of modern Sayram are ethnic Uzbeks. There is small minority of other ethnicities, mostly Kazakhs.\n\nThe religion of the inhabitants of Sayram is Islam. Like most of Central Asia's Muslims, the people of Sayram follow the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence.\n\nModern Sayram is still very much a part of ancient Central Asia. Unlike most of Kazakhstan, it bears almost no mark of Soviet planning or modernization. The streets curve in many directions, while the center of the town occupies the same crossroads that have been used for centuries. There are no apartments in the city proper, and no buildings more than two stories high, allowing the skyline to be dominated by the domes of local minarets, mosques, and mausoleums, some more than 1,000 years old.\n\nSayram is reachable via a ten- to fifteen-minute bus, taxi, or marshrutka ride from Shymkent, which is host to an international airport that also receives domestic flights from Kazakhstan's international hubs Almaty and Astana.\n\nThe man who later became Khoja Ahmad Yasavi was born in Sayram. The date of his birth is difficult to ascertain from historical documents, and later 13th-century hagiographical sources show evidence of pushing the date of his life to before the Mongol Conquest, i.e. c. 1103–1166. This chronology is generally accepted in contemporary Central Eurasian studies. His first teacher was Hazrat Shayh Shahobiddin Isfijabi. Today he is known by the nickname Oqota Baba (White Grandfather). Near his mausoleum, there is a small stream bridged by the main road into Sayram. This bridge is the focus of a local legend concerning the meeting of Ahmad as a boy and the great wanderer Arslan Bab.\n\nAccording to legend, Arslan was one of the Islamic prophet Muhammad's followers. He had already lived 300 years before meeting Muhammad, and was well versed in all of the world's religions, though he chose to follow Islam alone. As Muhammad's death drew near, he asked his followers who would take the stone of his holy date, a carrier of all Islamic knowledge, and give it to the next generation. Arslan replied that he would gladly bear this burden, and taking the stone, continued on his journey. Hundreds of years later, as he passed through the small town of Isfijab, Arslan Baba [his title of respect] was stopped on the road by a young boy. \"Grandfather, give me my date stone!\" demanded the young Ahmad. Arslan relinquished the stone, and following the death of Ahmad's father in 1113, journeyed with Ahmad to Yasi. From there Ahmad became a prize pupil and one of the rising stars of Sufism. Arslan Baba finally succumbed to old age and was buried near Otrar. Following Arslan's death, Ahmad moved to Bukhara and followed the studies of Yusuf Hamadani before moving to Yasi.\n\nHe spent the majority of his life in Yasi, taking the name Ahmad Yasawi. His order is known as the Yasawiyya/Yasavi, and is particularly important in the history of the region, as well as in Anatolia. Their order was known for its disdain for hypocrisy and also the inclusion of certain historic Central Eurasian traditions identified with Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism. The earliest historical record of the Yasavi Order comes from Hakim Ata, and the uncertainty surrounding Ahmad's order stems from the confusion regarding the multiple dates given for Hakim's life and possible direct descent from Ahmad as the second, third, fourth, or fifth generation of the order.\n\nAhmad's mother and father are buried in Sayram. Their mausoleums are both major sites of pilgrimage today, drawing pilgrims from all over Central Asia: Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and the surrounding area. Tīmūr ibn Taraghay Barlas decreed that a mausoleum be raised over the site of the Sufi's grave.\n\n"}

Crowley explained the method of crafting a Simon Iff story in simple terms:\n\nThe Simon Iff stories were written during a visit to New Orleans in December 1916, primarily as a means of alleviating Crowley's financial hardships. The mystic was verging on bankruptcy, a result of his lifestyle, and extravagant self-publishing, while having never earned a wage. The initial collection of six stories which Crowley penned would be labelled \"The Scrutinies of Simon Iff.\" Crowley would later write twelve more stories under the title \"Simon Iff in America\", six stories as \"Simon Iff Abroad\", and two final stories as \"Simon Iff Psychoanalyst.\" \"The Scrutinies of Simon Iff\" were first published in 1917-1918 in the New York publication \"The International\" under the pseudonym Edward Kelly ( presumably a nod to Edward Kelley, the Elizabethan alchemist and enochian magician). There is an edition of \"The Scutinies of Simon Iff\" published by Teitan Press: , while a 2012 Wordsworth Editions release (), under their \"Tales of Mystery & the Supernatural\" line, contains the complete works. As with most of Crowley's work, the Iff stories are practically unheard of outside of occult circles.\n\nSimon Iff also appears in Crowley's most widely read novel \"Moonchild\" (1929).\n\n"}

She was an early and influential participant in the underground comix movement, and one of the first few female artists in that movement. Both as a cartoonist and historian, Robbins has long been involved in creating outlets for and promoting female comics artists. In the 1980s, Robbins became the first woman to draw \"Wonder Woman\" comics. She is a member of the Will Eisner Hall of Fame.\n\nRobbins was an active member of science fiction fandom in the 1950s and 1960s. Her illustrations appeared in science fiction fanzines like the Hugo-nominated \"Habakkuk\".\n\nRobbins' first comics were printed in the \"East Village Other\"; she also contributed to the spin-off underground comic \"Gothic Blimp Works\".\n\nIn 1969, Robbins designed the costume for the Warren Publishing character Vampirella, for artist Frank Frazetta in \"Vampirella\" #1 (Sept. 1969).\n\nShe left New York for San Francisco in 1970, where she worked at the feminist underground newspaper \"It Ain't Me, Babe\". That same year she, along with fellow female artist Barbara \"Willy\" Mendes, established the first all-woman comic book, the one-shot \"It Ain't Me, Babe Comix\". From this period on, Robbins became increasingly involved in creating outlets for and promoting female comics artists, through projects such as the comics anthology \"Wimmen's Comix\", with which she was involved for twenty years. \"Wimmen's Comix\" #1 featured Robbins' \"Sandy Comes Out\", the first-ever comic strip featuring an \"out\" lesbian.\n\nRobbins became increasingly outspoken in her beliefs, criticizing underground comix artist Robert Crumb for the perceived misogyny of many of his comics. She said, \"It's weird to me how willing people are to overlook the hideous darkness in Crumb's work ... What the hell is funny about rape and murder?\"\n\nIn the early 1980s Robbins created adaptations of Sax Rohmer's \"Dope\" and Tanith Lee's \"The Silver Metal Lover\". In the mid-1980s she wrote and drew \"Misty\" for the Marvel Comics children's imprint Star Comics. The short-lived series was a reinterpretation of the long-standing character Millie the Model, now an adult running her own modeling agency and minding her niece Misty.\n\nRobbins' official involvement with Wonder Woman, a character she had long admired, began in 1986. At the conclusion of the first volume of the series (in conjunction with the series \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\"), DC Comics published a four-issue limited series titled \"The Legend of Wonder Woman\", written by Kurt Busiek and drawn by Robbins. Robbins was the first woman to draw Wonder Woman comics. The series paid homage to the character's Golden Age roots. She also appeared as herself in \"Wonder Woman Annual 2\" (1989). In the mid-1990s, Robbins criticized artist Mike Deodato's \"bad girl art\" portrayal of Wonder Woman, calling Deodato's version of the character a \"barely clothed hypersexual pinup.\" In the late 1990s, Robbins collaborated with Colleen Doran on the DC Comics graphic novel \"Wonder Woman: The Once and Future Story\", on the subject of spousal abuse.\n\nRobbins has been writing the comic book adventures of Honey West, notable as being one of popular fiction's first female private detectives.\n\nIn addition to her comics work, Robbins is an author of nonfiction books on the history of women in cartooning.\n\nHer first book, co-written with Catherine Yronwode, was \"Women and the Comics,\" a history of female comic-strip and comic-book creators. As one of the first books ever published on this subject, it was covered in the mainstream press, in addition to the fan press. Subsequent Robbins volumes on women in the comics industry include \"A Century of Women Cartoonists\" (Kitchen Sink, 1993), \"The Great Women Superheroes\" (Kitchen Sink, 1997), \"From Girls to Grrrlz: A History of Women’s Comics from Teens to Zines\" (Chronicle, 1999), and \"The Great Women Cartoonists\" (Watson-Guptill, 2001). Her most recent work, \"Pretty In Ink\", published by Fantagraphics, covers the history of North American women in comics from Rose O'Neill's 1896 strip \"The Old Subscriber Calls\" to present.\n\nRobbins was a co-founder of Friends of Lulu, a nonprofit formed in 1994 to promote readership of comic books by women and the participation of women in the comic book industry.\n\nRobbins is featured in the feminist history film \"She's Beautiful When She's Angry\".\n\nRobbins was intimately involved in the 1960s rock scene, where she was close friends with Jim Morrison and The Byrds. She is the first of the three \"Ladies of the Canyon\" in Joni Mitchell's classic song from the album of the same name. In the late 1960s she ran an East Village clothing boutique called \"Broccoli\" and made clothes for Mama Cass, Donovan, David Crosby and others. She has written a memoir entitled \"Last Girl Standing\", scheduled for release in 2017 from Fantagraphics. Her partner is artist Steve Leialoha.\n\nRobbins was a Special Guest of the 1977 San Diego Comic-Con, when she was presented with an Inkpot Award. She won a Special Achievement Award from the San Diego Comic Con in 1989 for her work on \"Strip AIDS U.S.A.\", a benefit book that she co-edited with Bill Sienkiewicz and Robert Triptow.\n\nShe was the 1992 Guest of Honor of WisCon, the Wisconsin Science Fiction Convention.\n\nIn 2002, Robbins was given the Special John Buscema Haxtur Award, a recognition for comics published in Spain.\n\nIn 2011, Robbins' artwork was exhibited as part of the Koffler Gallery show \"Graphic Details: Confessional Comics by Jewish Women\".\n\nIn July 2013, during the San Diego Comic-Con, Robbins was one of six inductees into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame. The award was presented by \"Mad\" magazine cartoonist and \"Groo the Wanderer\" creator Sergio Aragonés. The other inductees were Lee Falk, Al Jaffee, Mort Meskin, Joe Sinnott, and Spain Rodriguez.\n\nIn a 2015 poll, Robbins was ranked #25 among the best female comics creators of all-time.\n\nIn 2017, Robbins was chosen for the Wizard World Hall of Legends.\n\nIn consideration of her contributions to the comic art form and her work as a historian, Comics Alliance listed Robbins as one of twelve women cartoonists deserving of lifetime achievement recognition.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1178251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1178251", "title": "United Nation of Islam", "text": "United Nation of Islam\n\nThe United Nation of Islam (UNOI) is a group based in Kansas City, Kansas and offshoot of Nation of Islam. It was founded circa 1978 by Royall Jenkins, who continues to be the leader of the group and styles himself Royall, Allah in Person. They have since changed their name to \"Food for Life Supreme\", \"Value Creators\" and most recently \"Promise Keepers\".\n\nRoyall Jenkins was born in 1942 in South Carolina and grew up in eastern Maryland, later moving to New York and then Chicago, while working as a long-distance truck driver delivering publications of the Nation of Islam (NOI). He remained a member until after the death of Elijah Muhammad but split from the organization in 1978. According to Jenkins, he spent time on a spaceship with angels, where he learned that he was the Supreme Being and how to govern the world.\n\nPublic records show Jenkins working as a truck driver and living mostly with friends as he tried to recruit followers, including his daughter Maureen, who joined him in 1985 in a house in Waldorf, Maryland. The house was rented for them by Joseph Kelly, one of Jenkins' first converts. The UNOI eventually grew, and was incorporated as a nonprofit organization in New Jersey in 1993.\n\nBetween 1996 and 2002, the group relocated to its current Kansas City location. The UNOI is very controversial and currently has a membership of a few hundred people.\n\nThe beliefs of the UNOI are based on the beliefs of the NOI with considerable modifications by Jenkins. While believing that Allah came in the person of Wallace Fard Muhammad, founder of the NOI, Jenkins claims that he himself is Allah in his own person who is more powerful and who is given the task of coercing the submission of all things and perfecting everything used to magnify Him, after which \"men\" [specifically males] will all be God, or gods.\n\nJenkins stresses the relations between different races and sexes, referring extensively to black man, black woman, and white man. Black men are said to be the real and original men, whereas white people are claimed to have been created by a scientist named Yakub 6,000 years ago, the same belief held, at least in a metaphorical sense, by followers of the NOI prior to the death of Elijah Muhammad. Jenkins also claims that black men created black women as a natural pleasure, that women are inferior, and that following female guidance leads to Hell. He believes that black women are in league with white men, whom he considers enemies, and condemns women seeking child support, custody, and alimony though courts.\n\nJenkins also claims that the current NOI has been led astray by its leader Louis Farrakhan, whom he asserts is the most \"formidable enemy to Allah,\" and that Farrakhan uses tricks and deceptive tactics to \"silence anyone else's voice\" and \"prepare the masses to fight for him,\" through appearing \"to be against the Whiteman and his government.\"\n\nMembers of the UNOI work as unpaid labor in various businesses owned by the organization. UNOI-owned businesses include a full-service gas station (Your Gas Station), several restaurants and bakeries, a sewing factory, an urgent-care medical facility (Your Colonic Center) and a construction company, among others. UNOI claims that it provides for all the needs of all full-time volunteers. The group has roughly 200 full-time members in Kansas City, with perhaps 300 spread across several other cities. Most of the latter are part-time.\n\nUNOI hosts several call-in TV and radio programs across the United States. Jenkins appears regularly on these programs, as well as touring various US cities. The UNOI also offers classes and has a Web site that provides extensive writings by Jenkins and recordings of his TV appearances.\n\nAfter moving to Kansas City in 1996 (although its headquarters was not moved there until 2001), the UNOI received commendations for apparently aiding in the renewal of an area along Quindaro Boulevard that had a reputation for high crime rates and as a slum. The group purchased several properties in the area at minimal prices and used them to house its various businesses. As this happened, crime rates fell dramatically and property values rose. Commendations extended to the Wyandotte County government donating several additional (vacant) buildings to UNOI.\n\nCritics of the UNOI note that members work for Jenkins' benefit in UNOI businesses and receive no income, apply for and receive welfare from the government, and are given only the minimal necessities for survival, while UNOI uses the funds for their own benefit (including free vacations in the Caribbean). UNOI members and their children are required to be educated by the UNOI, which does not instruct them in many basic skills or provide opportunity for accredited higher education. Members receive health insurance and are not permitted to receive medical care outside that offered by the UNOI at Your Colonic Center, which does not include any physicians licensed in Kansas. At least one child of UNOI members has died without being taken to Kansas City emergency medical services.\n\nThe UNOI has also overstated its success—on one occasion stating that the Kansas City site is free of all crime, in the same month as a gunman fired twenty shots at a UNOI-run gas station. The Kansas City police department said it was unable to judge the effectiveness of UNOI in reducing crime. In 2002, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment reported five health violations at a UNOI-operated diner. In 2003, the gas station was the UNOI's only profitable business.\n\nJenkins has taken several wives from among his followers, including a teenaged stepdaughter (after having impregnated her). From these unions, he has fathered at least 15 children. Jenkins claims that he is justified in practicing polygamy, comparing himself to Solomon and claiming \"In the near future, a man will be known for his wisdom according to the number of wives that he has.\"\n\nNotable among the UNOI's critics are at least ten former members, including Moreen and Hanif Jenkins, two of Royall Jenkins' children from his first marriage. Hanif was a member of the UNOI for six months and then became a critic of its operations. Moreen joined the UNOI in 1985. She claimed that she married Joseph Kelly, one of the first members of the UNOI, and also studied UNOI theology for several hours a day for years. In 1997, Royall Jenkins declared that Kelly was a reincarnation of Elijah Muhammad, a claim that the NOI rejected. In 2002 Moreen Jenkins claimed her father threatened her life and the life of her youngest child after she attempted to apologize to the victim of a beating by UNOI members. She then took her infant child and left UNOI. Members continued to harass her. She stated that the UNOI was blocking her attempts to communicate with her other children and her attempts to gain custoy. As of 2003, she had filed for divorce and still sought custody of her children. Moreen died at her home on October 14, 2008, shortly after her 45th birthday.\n\nIn 2003, the UNOI stated that Moreen Jenkins was \"operating out of vengeance, scorn, anger, desire and treachery\" and proposed that she seduced reporters with \"the guise of a scoop.\" In the same statement, Royall Jenkins is quoted as announcing “the time when those who conspire against the rise of the Blackman —including Black women—will no longer be tolerated.\" After her death, Jenkins described his daughter as a traitor, stated \"the death of my daughter Moreen was more than justified\" and exhorted his followers not to mourn.\n\nIn June 2018, the United Nation of Islam was profiled on A&E's \"Cults & Extreme Belief\", a television show where host Elizabeth Vargas and others interview former members of organizations considered cults, talking to them about how they became involved and their allegations of abuse. In the episode, former members talks about their allegations of human trafficking, unpaid labor, neglect and abuse of children of members of the group.\n\nIn September 2017 Kendra Ross brought a civil suit against the UNOI stating that she was forced into unpaid work for 10 years and made to move to various cities from the age of 11 until she escaped at 21. She was forcibly separated from her mother at 12. Her lawyer stated that \"“This organization just took away her childhood...They stripped her of 19 years of her life, forced her to work for no pay, and subjected her to just inhumane conditions.” She was forced to marry another member who was chosen by a \"psychic doctor\". A Federal judge awarded her approximately $8 million in damages.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18507812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18507812", "title": "Yehowists", "text": "Yehowists\n\nYehowists (also Yehowist-Ilyinites, Ilyinists, Ilyintsy, Jehovists, Sect of the Right-hand Brotherhood, The Message of Zion, ) is a Russian Spiritual Christian millenarian religious movement founded by retired army officer and religious thinker Nikolai Ilyin in the 1840s.\n\nDuring Ilyin's life and due to sending bulk booklets both by Ilyin and by his followers groups of Ilyinites were founded in different parts of the Russian Empire. The center of the movement before the Revolution remained in Ural but individual groups were also formed in Transcaucasia, Northern Caucasus and Ukraine. Ilyinites were persecuted periodically, and quite often they were punished by exiling to Central Asia and other parts of the Russian Empire. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Russians were populating parts of Kazakhstan and northern Kyrgyzstan. There were Yehowists among settlers who discovered that new places provide more religious freedom than they had in Russian regions.\n\nIlyinites took the revolution of 1917 indifferently. Their teaching prohibits them to take action in military clashes and killing, however Ilyinites expected to get more religious freedom after the revolution. In 1939 a secret center of Ilyinites was discovered and closed by NKVD in Nizhny Tagil city in Ural. During the Soviet period Ilyinites had to hide their activity; some of them were persecuted, arrested; their religious literature was confiscated. Quite often young men refused to serve in the army, which resulted in criminal prosecution and in some cases in capital punishment. Nevertheless, Yehowists kept on distributing Ilyin's booklets both printed secretly and hand-written or copied with a copying paper. Yehowists are not a registered organization believing that there is no need in getting registered with the authorities that belong to Satan. Religious publications about Yehowists made during the Soviet period are scarce and contain wrong data about Yehowists. They stated that Ilyinites ceased to exist as a religious movement and also tried to represent Yehowists as part or a branch of Jehovah's Witnesses, which is totally incorrect.\n\nThe Yehowist Movement (frequently referred to by its members as Brotherhood) continues to exist in parts of the former Soviet Union, particularly in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Southern Russia, and Ukraine. Most Yehowists are ethnic Russians, although the percentage of non-Russian members is growing due to conversion. The period is characterized by new forms of distribution of religious literature; in particular Ilyinites actively use the Internet translating Ilyin's works to other languages. Yehowists run a multilingual website - http://svetoch.org offering both Russian originals intended for the public at large and also English, German, Hebrew, Greek, Polish and Kyrgyz translations. Invitations to visit the site are posted periodically on forums and other sites in the Russian segment of the Internet.\n\nThe Yehowist population is small and there are no accurate estimates to the number of Yehowists because it is a closed religious organization. Ilyinites never provide any information about their population and also about internal life and activity of their communities. Their population is believed to grow due to proselytism.\n\nIlyin's teaching in today's representation is a quite sophisticated and philosophical concept, which focuses on such aspects as 1000 year kingdom, physical immortality of man, upcoming battle between Yehowah and Satan in Armageddon. Despite the fact that Ilying was a proponent of polytheism he focused on two Gods only: Yehowah and Satan. According to Ilyin there are two ManGods of equal strength in our Solar system - Yehowah and Satan. There are other Gods outside the Earth and the Solar system but they are not empowered to deal with earthly people and people must not worship them. Speaking about Yehowah Ilying said: \"...THE ONLY GOD over people, and HE is the only ONE, who has keys to death and graves... and HE is the only ONE, whom we should worship and pray about everything...\" Gods like people exist in human form. Yehowism totally denies existence of a soul, paradise and hell in their modern interpretation. For this reason Yehowah is often called a mangod in Ilyin's works. According to Ilyin: \"Yehowah is a man and even a Hebrew but the EVERLASTING ONE...\" Yehowah is God of the immortals while Satan is God of the mortals or satanists meaning followers of the traditional Christian denominations and Talmudic Judaism. Ilyin wrote: \"my GOD walks on Earth, and visits HIS friends, and has supper with them, like HE visited Abraham and had supper with him under the oak tree, …visited Melchizedek, Job, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Balaam and Mohammad.\" Some famous religious people of the past, according to Ilyin, were representatives of Yehowism in their time, for example John Huss, Quaker George Fox, a German mystic Jakob Böhme, Socrates, Pythagoras, Medichi, Elisabeth Kridner, Muhammad, Confucius and many others. Yehowah, according to Ilyin, is Jesus. Jesus Christ was a temporary incarnation of Yehowah on Earth. So it was Hebrew God Yehowah himself, who was crucified and died on the cross. Yehowists totally deny trinity taking it as Satan's fiction.\n\nYehowah and Satan lead an ongoing fight with each other. Yehowists fight for Yehowah by distributing Ilyin's works and following moral and ritual norms of Yehowism. In reward they will get eternal life in physical form. A decisive battle will soon take place between the two Gods, which Ilyin calls Armageddon. Yehowah will win and build 1000 year Jerusalem Republic. This will be a period of abundance for people. After 1000 years Satan will break free and the last battle with Yehowah will take place, in which Satan and his followers will be exterminated utterly. Then Yehowah will renew the Earth drastically and will keep on improving it periodically.\n\nIlyin never set any particular dates for Armageddon foretelling rather forthcoming apocalyptic events than their dates: \"[Satan] will force all people to bow to its vicious power and for cannon fodder causing a lot of suffering and bloodshed; especially it will kill brutally lot of people in the Turkish empire, Balkan Peninsula, Jerusalem and in the Caucasus,\" or in another booklet he says: \"first, [i.e. before the tribulation] YEHOWAH will bring down cannon fire on Germany.\"\n\nThe goal of every person on this planet, according to Ilyin, is to achieve physical immortality through self-perfection, observing Yehowah's Law and his last-days commands given through Ilyin.\n\nYehowists believe that text of the Christian (and Jewish) Bible was distorted by Satan. Although they agree that the bible contains some truths but its text is so much distorted that Yehowists don't use it at all believing that the reader will not be able to tell the truth from later Satan's distortions and additions. Although Ilyin's works contain numerous references to the Bible but members of Yehowist society are not allowed to read it including Holy Scriptures of other religions. Instead Yehowists take Book of Revelation of Saint John edited by Ilyin and alternatively called by Yehowists the Book from Heaven as the holiest book. This book is considered secret and available to members of the Yehowist society only. Apart from the Book from Heaven Ilyin's works are also regarded as holy writings. They are divided into several types depending on creation period and purpose. Some books written by Ilyin are considered to be out of date intended mainly for members of the organization. Works written during the initial period are known to be materials for distribution, which are distributed with the aim of propagation of Ilyin's teaching. All works by Ilyin are reproduced by Yehowists both in printed and handwritten forms with the old Russian spelling kept in order to avoid distortions when reproducing them. Below you can find a list of booklets translated into English:\n\n\nHanding out booklets is the only allowed method of propagation of the teaching while verbal preaching is prohibited. Nikolai Ilyin prohibited his followers to preach verbally based on the prophecy in Is. 41-25 \"...he will do it the way that no one will hear him preaching a sermon nor breaking a bruised reed in the street\"; in addition, preaching may easily lead to debate with members of other religions. Preaching is also believed to have a possibility of distortions of the message. Booklets are handed out to all people who are willing to take them.\n\nWorship of Yehowists take place during closed meetings and only members of the society can take part in them. The meetings are likely to include prayers, singing, reading Holy Scriptures and burning the incense. Yehowists use a book of hymns written by Ilyin for singing both at worship meetings and at also at informal meetings.\n\nWorship meetings of Yehowists takes place on Saturdays starting from Friday night because Saturday is a day of rest like in Judaism. Unlike Judaism observing the Saturday is not so strict. Saturday is the only religious festivity of Yehowists. Celebration of Christmas, Easter and other traditional Christian religious celebrations is not allowed. Although Yehowists use common and personal celebrations like New Year and birthday for informal meetings.\n\nYehowists strictly follow a food diet, which in general is similar to the Jewish one. In particular eating pork, hare and other seafood is strictly forbidden.\n\nYehowists don't serve in the army and don't take part in military actions. As a whole the moral rules they preach are universal. They condemn hatred, unjustness, lie, slander, theft, alcohol, smoking and other vices.\n\nYehowists value secular education. Ilyin repeatedly emphasized that his message, first of all, is intended for educated people. In reality the majority of Ilyinites don't hold academic degrees, which is caused mainly by persecution by the authorities and limited capabilities for getting education, especially in rural areas. There are no any restrictions for getting education including higher one excluding theological, legal, military and theatrical ones regarded by Ilyin as Satan's sciences.\n\nYehowism claims to be the only true religion of God Yehowah. Consequently, other religions are considered to be false or deluded. Participation in worship and even visiting religious buildings of other religions is prohibited. Although Ilyin praised some religious leaders and followers of the past such as Quakers, Novgorod strigolniks and others. As a whole Ilyin criticized other religions in his writings, especially traditional Christian denominations and Talmudic Judaism.\n\nQuite often Yehowists are criticized for expressing hatred and being intolerant of other religions. Indeed, a lot of sayings by Ilyin contain keen criticism towards them and are not ethically acceptable. However, despite severe criticism of other religions and ideologies Yehowism is friendly to people practicing them. Ilyin repeatedly called on his followers to get along with all people regardless of their beliefs and perception. Ilyin's style is characterized by a certain degree of rudeness and straightforwardness. This might easily astonish and even shock readers, who have never read similar ideas. Disrespect to the Bible, Christian sacred objects, mysteries, Talmud, etc. shown by Ilyin in his writings also might drive away and insult members of traditional religions.\n\n"}
