A functioning community was not founded in Chile until 1940 with the beginning of the arrival of coordinated pioneers from the United States finding national Chilean converts and achieved an independent national community in 1963. In 2002 this community was picked for the establishment of the first Bahá'í Temple of South America which the community is still prosecuting. The US government estimated 6000 Bahá'ís in Chile as of 2007 though the Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 26000 Bahá'ís in 2005.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention Latin American regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 — after the end of World War I and the Spanish flu. The first actions on the part of Bahá'í community towards Latin America were that of a few individuals who made trips to Mexico and South America near or before this unavailing in 1919, including Mr. and Mrs. Frankland, and Roy C. Wilhelm, and Martha Root. Root's travels, perhaps the first Bahá'í to Chile, began in the summer of 1919 - stopping first in Brazil, then Argentina and Uruguay before setting out to cross the Andes mountains into Chile in winter; she visited Valparaiso and Santiago. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919.\n\n\"His Holiness Christ says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the world and summon the people to the Kingdom of God. Hence the mercy of God must encompass all humanity. Therefore do ye not think it permissible to leave that region deprived of the breezes of the Morn of Guidance. Consequently, strive as far as ye are able to send to those parts fluent speakers, who are detached from aught else save God, attracted with the fragrances of God, and sanctified and purified from all desires and temptations. ...Guatemala, Honduras, Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and the seventh country Belize...The teachers going to those parts must also be familiar with the Spanish language. Attach great importance to the indigenous population of America...Likewise the islands of ... Cuba, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, ... Bahama Islands, even the small Watling Island...Haiti and Santo Domingo...the islands of Bermuda... the republics of the continent of South America—Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, the Guianas, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Venezuela; also the islands to the north, east and west of South America, such as Falkland Islands, the Galapagòs, Juan Fernandez, Tobago and Trinidad...\"\n\nFollowing the release of these tablets and then `Abdu'l-Bahá's death in 1921, a few Bahá'ís began moving to or at least visiting Latin America. For example Mark Tobey visited Mexico in 1931 during a world trip from Europe through Palestine, the Americas and back to Europe.\n\nShoghi Effendi, who was named `Abdu'l-Bahá's successor, wrote a cable on May 1, 1936 to the Bahá'í Annual Convention of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of `Abdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin. In his cable he wrote:\n\n\"Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by 'Abdu'l-Bahá in \"Tablets of the Divine Plan\". Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Bahá'í Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh and establish structural basis of His World Order.\"\nFollowing the May 1st cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent pioneers to be established in all the countries of Latin America. The Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada was appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bahá'í North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bahá'ís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the Bahá'í House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois. In 1937 the \"First Seven Year Plan\" (1937–44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bahá'ís the goal of establishing the Bahá'í Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bahá'ís in Latin American, Bahá'í communities and Local Spiritual Assemblies began to form in 1938 across Latin America.\n\nThe permanent Chilean Bahá'í community dates from the arrival of Marcia Stewart Atwater, born in 1904 in Pasadena, California, who arrived in Chile on December 7, 1940 when her ship docked at Arica (though written materials of the Bahá'í Faith are known to have been present in Chile though the Theosophical Society previous none had become Bahá'í.). The first Chilean to accept the Bahá'í Faith was 12-year-old Paul Bravo, which was followed by his family becoming Bahá'ís. Then in 1943, Chile's first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly was elected. Following this election Atwater went to Punta Arenas, the southern most city of the world.\n\nIn 1943, during the annual Bahá'í convention of the United States, Shoghi Effendi announced a Northern- and Southern- international convention which would include representative from each state and province from the United States and Canada and each republic of Latin America. During this convention, Esteban Canales was the Chilean delegate.\n\nArtemus Lamb, the second Bahá'í pioneer in Chile arrived on October 2, 1944 in Punta Arenas, and thus relieving Atwater from her outpost. In that city, Lina Smithson (known as Lina Gianotti in Chile) became its first Chilean believer in 1945; in 1945 Bahá'ís moved from Punta Arenas area to Santiago, Valparaíso and Valdivia.\n\nBy 1946, a mixture of pioneers and Chilean citizens increased the number of Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assemblies from fourteen to thirty-seven, of which three had obtained legal incorporation; and the number of localities in which Bahá'ís resided had been increased to almost a hundred. The first South American Bahá'í Congress was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, November, 1946. In 1947 the Bahá'í international teaching committee for South America (CEPSA) was appointed and the first members were Walter Hammond, Rosy Vodanovic, Esteben Canales, Betty Rowe, and Artemus Lamb, all of Chile. At a similar conference for the Central American region a Bahá'í mentioned a campaign had begun. It was explained more in May 1947 that she and others had advertised in major newspapers of several cities along these lines:\n\nWe are seeking people of good will to organize a Center of Study and Teaching founded on the following principles (a formulation of Bahá'í teachings). This movement already has affiliated groups established in all the major countries of the world, which function by means of the collective consultation of all their members. Without obligation, you may ask for literature and every kind of information by writing to (address in San Jose). \n\nFrom this advertising there were enquiries which were sent Bahá'í literature and eventually an assembly was elected. Bahá'ís from Chile were interested in the method enough to emulate it. By October 1947 this method was being used in Chile. Lucha G. de Padilla, wife of the former consul-general of Chile to the United States, went to Costa Rica in May 1948 to see the process for herself. This method was still being used up to at least 1966.\n\nThe second South American Bahá'í Congress was celebrated in Santiago, Chile, in January, 1948 and was organized and executed by CEPSA with the help of the Local Spiritual Assembly of Santiago. In 1950, the Bahá'í Faith achieved legal recognition in Chile with the formation of an international Regional Spiritual Assembly for South America whose first members were Edmund Miessler of Brazil, Margot Worley of Brazil, Eve Nicklin of Peru, Gayle Woolson of Colombia, Esteban Canales of Paraguay, Mercedes Sanchez of Peru, Dr. Alexander Reid of Chile, Rangvald Taetz of Uruguay, and Manuel Vera of Peru.\n\nFollowing the election of the Regional Bahá'í Spiritual Assembly of South America in 1950, in 1957 this Assembly was split into two - basically northern/eastern South America with the Republics of Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela, in Lima, Peru and one of the western/southern South America with the Republics of Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Chile established its independent Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly in 1961.\n\nSince its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. Following the changes in Chile due to transition to democracy between 1989 and 1991, the Chilean Ministry of Education approved programs for Bahá'í General Basic (Elementary) Education and Secondary Education, and two schools were established by the National Spiritual Assembly — the Elementary School of Faizi, Number 335 and the Elementary School of Dr. Muhajir, Number 499; both schools serve largely Mapuche communities.\n\nOther mentions of the religion included in well-known Chilean Isabel Allende's book \"The Infinite Plan: A Novel\" (1991) which states: \"Gregory's journey is marked by the contending philosophies of his mother's Bahai Faith.\" By 1994 a radio station was established in Chile to nurture and preserve the local culture by featuring local story-tellers and music recorded at station-sponsored annual indigenous music festivals. During 1994-95 there were two Bahá'í youth conferences. In August 1994 in Talca a youth conference was held were all talks and workshops were prepared and presented by youth to give them opportunities to develop their skills; the conference focused on evaluating the past year's projects and planning for the future. The second national conference, in February 1995, was the culmination of a month-long teaching project undertaken by the youth in sixteen cities of Chile.\n\nIn 2000, Chile rose in support of a United Nations human rights resolution about concern over the Bahá'ís in Iran as well as taking steps to further document conditions.\n\nIn late 2002, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Chile and the Universal House of Justice, the international governing body of the Bahá'ís, announced a competition for the design of the first Bahá'í House of Worship for South America, to be built near Santiago though the general decision to have the first temple of South America was set since 1953. The selected design was designed by Siamak Hariri of Toronto, Canada, and fabrication of components began in 2007. Its sides will be composed of translucent panels of alabaster and cast glass. The interior structure will be a lattice structure of steel supporting the inside of the upper dome. The construction completed in October, 2016, with doors opening on October 19, 2016.\n\nKamal Siegel is a musician born in Punta Arenas of American parents; his first album was released in 2005, and one of its songs was featured in a 2007 compilation album produced by Grammy Award-Winner KC Porter. In 1998 Siegel moved to the Seattle area of the United States where he gained experience as a game artist and designer and in 2004 founded his own production and animation company.\n\nOther Chilean Bahá'í artists include musician Rebecca Johnston-Garvin who moved to Chile in 1979, who has produced three CD's, singer/songwriter Dario Cardoso, who in 1991 participated in a Bahá'í music group called Planeta Paz and toured Brasil, Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay, architect and musician Javier Duhart, and rap duo \"New Vision\" with Vahid Masrour and Kioumars Balazadeh.\n\nThe US government estimated 6000 Bahá'ís in Chile as of 2007 though the Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 26415 Bahá'ís in 2005. Either way, Bahá'ís claim nearly half of the Chilean Bahá'í community is of the indigenous Mapuche people.\n\n\n"}

They earned their income by reciting vocal literature to the accompaniment of biwa music. Often blind, they adopted the shaved heads and robes common to Buddhist monks. This occupation likely had its origin in China and India, where blind Buddhist lay-priest performers were once common.\n\nTheir musical style is referred to as , which literally means \"\"heike\" music\". Although these performers existed well before the events of the Genpei War, they eventually became famous for narrating. Before \"biwa hōshi\" sang \"heikyoku\", they were entertainers and ritual performers. They took on a broad range of roles, including poetry and song, plague prevention, and spiritual purification; actually, it was probably because of their ritualistic duties that they became the caretakers of .\n\nThe \"biwa hōshi\" are considered the first performers of the \"Tale of the Heike\", which is one of Japan`s most famous epics. It details battles between two powerful clans, the Minamoto and the Taira around the 12th century. The Taira (or Heike) were eventually annihilated by the Minamoto (sometimes called the Genji), who systematically killed every male descendant of the Taira. Religion in Japan at the time incorporated many native animistic (Shinto) beliefs into its Buddhist theological framework, leading many court nobles and religious leaders to worry about angry Taira spirits disrupting the peace. The great earthquake around 1185 CE contributed to this sentiment. Since their rituals included placating spirits and preventing plagues, \"heike\" music became a vehicle for placating lingering, resentful Heike spirits. \"Heikyoku\" and \"biwa hōshi\" became immensely popular for the next several hundred years.\n\n literally means \"lute priest\". is derived from , which translates as a teacher who explains Buddhist precepts. The two characters and mean \"Buddhist doctrine\" and \"teacher\" respectively. \"Hōshi\" referred to blind priests who played the \"heike-biwa\" to accompany their songs about legends, wars, histories, and mythologies. Eventually, \"hōshi\" referred to non-blind and blind performers and was also used as a suffix to a series of other types of people, such as , , , and . \"Biwa hōshi\" are referred to in Japanese iconography that dates back to the late Heian period (794–1185 CE). They are also referred to in the \"Shinsarugakuki\", written by Fujiwara no Akihira (989–1066).\n\nShōbutsu, a Buddhist monk of the Tendai school, was, according to tradition, the first \"biwa hōshi\" to sing the \"Heike Monogatari\", around the year 1220. Subsequently, two different factions of \"biwa hōshi\" were formed. These were the Ichikata school, founded by Akashi Kyoichi, and the Yasaka School, founded by Yasaka Kigen. Ranks were assigned to \"biwa hōshi\" on the basis of skill, the highest being , followed by , and .\n\nThe proliferation of the Yasaka and Ichikata factions heightened with the contributions of Akashi Kakuichi (1300–1371). A noted \"biwa hōshi\", Kakuichi's \"heikyoku\" narration is currently accepted as the definitive version of the \"heike\". A documented reason for this is that Kakuichi was largely responsible for forming the Ichikata guild. This preceded the formation of the , a self-governing guild of \"biwa hōshi\". The Tōdō received income in two ways: patronage from the Kyoto aristocracy and military, and its monopoly over the teaching and transmission of \"heikyoku\". To be accepted as a disciple, an aspiring student would have to pay a fee, after which the study of each new piece of music required payment. By the 13th and 14th centuries, \"biwa hōshi\" performed for the military elite and the aristocracy, including the regional \"daimyō\" feudal lords. Public performances were also given during Buddhist temple services. The general population had the further option of attending Kanjin performances, which they were required to pay a fee to see.\n\nThe Ōnin War (1467–1477) proved a trying occurrence for the proliferation of the \"biwa hōshi\". The war instigated the Sengoku period (15th–17th centuries), an era of civil war and political–military conflict that lasted for nearly two centuries. In this time, many \"heike\" musicians turned their attention to the \"jōruri\" or the \"shamisen\" three-stringed lute. Therefore, not only did the conflict cause a loss of performers, but also a decline in the number of listeners of the \"heikyoku\".\n\nHowever, the complete demise of the \"biwa hōshi\" was prevented by a \"daimyō\" named Tokugawa Ieyasu who favored the art of \"heike\" performance. It was he who ultimately reunified the country by establishing the Tokugawa shogunate, where he became a fervent patron of the \"heike\".\n\nDuring the Edo period (1600–1868), the Tokugawa Shogunate provided the Tōdō with special privileges and substantial financing, which the Tōdō then distributed to members according to rank. The Edo period also marks the era in which the Shogunate designated \"heike\" as one of its official ceremonial forms of music.\n\nAccordingly, new schools of \"heike\" appeared, many of which were influenced by the newly introduced \"shamisen\" style. The two predominant schools that came about during the Edo period were the Maeda-ryū founded by Maeda Kyūichi, and the Hatano-ryū founded by Hatano Kōichi. Both figures were members of the Shidō-ha, which was the most active branch of the older Ichikata school. Collaborations were formed between amateur aficionados of the \"heike\" who, over the course of the Edo period, made small revisions to the musical notation of the \"heike\" score. The ceremonial form of the \"heike\" performed for the Shogunate became increasingly solemn and refined to meet the standards of the intellectual class. Moreover, to ensure the development of the \"heike\" score, improvisation notably declined.\n\nIn 1868, the Meiji Restoration heralded the collapse of the Tokugawa Shogunate. This ultimately contributed to the abolition of the Tōdō, which undermined social privileges for the musicians and reduced the availability of avenues for performance. The Hatano-ryū, in particular, underwent a debilitating decline in popularity, so much so that it struggled to survive in Kyoto until the middle of the 20th century. In addition, the \"shamisen\", which accompanied the contemporary idiom of songs and narratives, made the ancient tales of the Heike appear antiquated. And by the end of the Edo period, the \"koto\" had in fact replaced the \"biwa\" as the most common instrument used among blind musicians.\n\nThe \"heike\" tradition persisted, however, through the Tsugaru lineage (transmitted by sighted performers) and the Nagoya lineage (transmitted by professional blind musicians of the Tōdō tradition), both of which belonged to the Maeda-ryū. The Tsugaru lineage consisted of Kusumi Taisō (1815–1882), who learned the \"heike\" of the Edo Maeda-ryū, as well as his sons Tateyama Zennoshin and Tateyama Kōgo, both of whom lamented the decline of \"heike\" in the late years of Meiji and sought to foster a number of pupils. And in Nagoya, a city which had been a thriving nucleus for Heike performance, a small faction of blind male players continued to transmit Heike alongside other mediums of music of growing popularity, such as the \"koto\" and \"shamisen\". Differences exist between these lineages due to geographical separation and changes that have occurred uniquely in time. For example, the Nagoya lineage relied almost entirely on oral transmission. Nevertheless, the Nagoya \"heike\" and Tsugaru \"heike\" were both nominated by the Japanese government as \"Intangible Cultural Properties that should be recorded and preserved\": Nagoya in 1955 and Tsugara in 1959. Those nominated Nagoya performers continue their transmission; by name, they are Inokawa Kōji, Doizaki Masatomi and Mishina Masayasu).\n\nThe libretto notation on which remaining \"heikyoku\" performance is based today in Nagoya is called Heike Shosetsu. It was composed by Ogino Tomoichi (1732–1801), initially a disciple in the Hatano-ryū faction, before acquiring the post of \"kengyō\" in the Kyoto branch of the Maeda-ryū school. He had great knowledge of both major schools as a Hatano-ryū disciple master. As such, he played a fundamental role in the revival of the \"biwa hōshi\".\n\nToru Takemitsu saved the \"biwa\" from extinction by collaborating with Western composers. Takemitsu, and several composers before him, recognized that Japanese music was quickly becoming obsolete. Interest in Japanese music was almost nonexistent. Studies in music theory and music composition almost entirely consisted in Western theory and instruction. Some of these composers began to incorporate Japanese music and Japanese instruments into their compositions. Yet, these composers focused on those Japanese instruments most similar to Western ones; for example, Michio Miyagi's utilization of the \"koto\". Takemitsu, on the other hand, collaborated with Western composers and compositions to include the distinctly Asian \"biwa\". His well-received compositions have revitalized interest in the \"biwa\" and saved it from becoming obsolete.\n\nAccording to Hugh de Ferranti, modern, live performances of \"biwa\" narrative singing are rare, with almost all performers being \"practitioners of Chikuzen-biwa and Satsuma-biwa\". Satsuma-biwa \"emerged from interaction between moso and the samurai class\" in Satsuma Province, starting a period of popularity for \"modern biwa\" until the 1930s, while Chikuzen-biwa had its origin in the 1890s in the Chikuzen region of Kyushu, drawing upon aspects of \"mōsō\" music, \"shamisen\", and Satsuma-biwa technique. These traditions enjoyed widespread appreciation during the early twentieth century due to the \"mationalist, militarist sentiments of late-Meiji imperialist ideology\". In the post-war era, these traditions were considered \"refined classical pursuits\", resulting in their popularity beyond \"heike-biwa\" The \"biwa\" itself is also depicted with the image of goddess Benzaiten at her shrines, and in images of the \"in homes, shops, and offices\".\nHowever, modern associations with \"biwa\" are mainly connected to the \"biwa hōshi\", themselves linked to the \"Tale of Heike\" and \"Hōichi the Earless\", well-known works taught in schools and readapted for television series, manga, popular literature and other media. As such, \"most Japanese come to think of the biwa as a battered old string instrument played by a decrepit blind man who looks like a Buddhist priest and wanders about chanting old tales about war and ghosts\". According to Hugh de Ferranti, \"outside of the realms of scholarship and the few who are involved in learning and performing\", few Japanese civilians are familiar with the aural qualities of the \"biwa\" and cannot recognize its tones with references to ancient war-tales. The instrument is viewed as antiquated, a relic of the past that \"cannot be a thing of contemporary Japanese life and experience, but is tied forever to the world of the \"Tale of the Heike\"; a gloomy world of martial valour and samurai ghosts\".\n\nFor most of Japan’s recorded history, music along with narrative performance have been frequent professions for the blind, whose importance in most other major genres is also unavoidable, save for court and theatre music, from the thirteenth century until the nineteenth. Folk and literature attest \"invariably about blind \"biwa hōshi\" and \"zatō\"\", and only in modern times do sighted musicians master such instruments like the \"biwa\".\n\nAccording to De Ferranti, the act of playing lutes for alms by blind musicians finds its roots in Indian Buddhist culture during the first millennium CE. As early as the fourth century, blind itinerants in South Asia, described by texts such as the \"Ashokavadana\" as holy men, played lutes for alms. A seventh-century text from China and Japan's early twelfth-century \"Konjaku Monogatarishū\" recount this story, while other \"scattered accounts\" of blind lute-laying priests can be found in Tang-period volumes from the Chinese mainland. In the Shanbei region near Inner Mongolia, \"blind beggars who recited tales and travelled with pipa accompanists were common\", prior to the 1949 revolution. Under Mao, blind itinerants called \"shuoshude\" () played a three-string lute in \"household ritual contexts\" using their narrative \"as a potent force for social reform\" by the Communist Party.\n\nPrior to the spread of Buddhism during the sixth to ninth centuries, it was \"generally acknowledged that in Japanese ritual life blind men and women [were] respected as shamanic celebrants who bore numinous power because of their separation from the world experienced by others\". Historically, the blind performed healing rituals for curing illness and exorcising spirits. For music, plucking or striking string instruments also have ritual meanings, and were tasks probably given to blind individuals to perform in belief of their shamanistic abilities. The Azusa Yumi was utilized for summoning deities in a pre-Buddhist ritual, likely involving the blind. The role of early \"biwa hōshi\" in delivery the vocal performance of battle tales \"to allay the fury of slain warriors' ghosts\" further implies a shamanistic qualification of the blind. Historical references suggest \"biwa hōshi\" were involved in both divination and also in this fundamental role of placating aggravated spirits, especially those killed in battle.\n\nThe intimate ties between the \"biwa\" and the blind in the Tōdō and various regional groups for further cement this inseparable relationship. Blindness was a necessary condition for membership in these organizations, which looked after blind \"heike\" performers and professionals and blind \"biwa\" ritualists respectively. In the Tōdō, \"heike\" performers came to control the guild, and thus the lives of many Japanese blind people. According to the legends of these institutions, \"the lineage of blind biwa players ultimately is traced to ... a blind disciple of the historical Buddha Shakyamuni, called Gankutsu Sonja\".\n\nHowever, according to Hugh de Ferranti, not all blind \"biwa\" players of antiquity \"were completely lacking the sense of vision and knowledge of music\". Indeed, many people called blind were likely \"only impaired in their vision\", evidenced by the denotation of words for blind people such as , \"zatō\", and . Also, many blind individuals gain the ailment gradually, resulting from aging, illness, or accident, meaning literacy may have been acquired earlier in life. Hugh de Ferranti states that notable numbers of \"biwa\" performers \"were sighted and in some cases literate\", evidenced by records of the Jojuin \"mōsō\" tradition and historical membership of the Gensei Hōryū \"mōsō\" group. Such individuals thus must be acknowledged for potential importance in producing written texts and in the \"transmission of repertory\".\n\nBuddhist iconography throughout East and South-East Asia depict short-necked lutes being played by celestial beings as well as the Hindu goddess Saraswati, who led such divine musicians. Avatars of Sarasvati, \"the \"biwa\"-playing Hindu goddess of music, wisdom, and eloquence\", also play the lute in Tibetan and Chinese iconographic displays; such avatars correspond to Benzaiten, a Japanese deity known for holding a \"biwa\" in her benevolent arms.\n\nJapanese iconography indicates two female lute-playing deities: the aforementioned Benzaiten and Myōonten; their identities are often fused together, but both have their roots in the continental Asian tradition, and can be traced from Sarasvati through various forms. Benzaiten represents eloquence while Myōonten epitomizes music itself. As the bodhisattva named \"Miraculous Sound\", Myōon Bōsatsu is described in the Lotus Sutra and was important for \"biwa\" players in court society. Her influence would spread beyond the court, integrating itself especially in the biwa hoshi tradition. After the early eighth century however, most sculptures and iconographic depictions show the pipa instead of the lute.\n\nLocations whose name contain the characters or sounds \"biwa\" also have sanctified lore. Lake Biwa is famous for Chikubu-shima, where Taira no Tsunemasa performs at the Benzaiten shrine, whose deity appears in the form of a white dragon. Especially in Kyushu, there are \"biwa\" hills, valleys, ponds, and bridges throughout Japan, where performers supposedly buried or offered instruments to the local waters. Other legends of certain sects and accounts from ancient texts further the sacred associations of the \"biwa\" instrument.\n\nDespite the depiction of Benzaiten, the patron deity of music revered by \"biwa hōshi\" and \"mōsō\", as a female entity and the existence of highly celebrated female \"biwa\" players in twentieth century, with the \"exception of avocational performance by women in the court music tradition\", professional \"biwa\" players were men until the \"shamisen\"'s use in the sixteenth century. Along with blindness, maleness was a necessary condition for admission to the \"mōsō\" and Tōdō. However, it was common in Tang China for women to play pipa, as it was also common for courtly women from the Heian through Muromachi periods to learn \"biwa\" in childhood. There are also a few rare references to both sighted and blind female entertainers who may have played \"biwa\", though in the Edo period, some female enthusiasts learned from \"heike-biwa\" professionals as a recreational activity.\n\nItinerant women performers did still exist in medieval Japan, though they are most frequently shown playing the \"tsuzumi\" drum. In the Edo period, singers called \"goze\" often accompanied themselves on the \"shamisen\" or \"koto\", the latter of which was played by \"affluent blind women who taught it to the wives of samurai and merchants\". The former along with its wooden imitation, \"gottan\" were played for performance to procure alms, house to house; this was called . In Kyushu, \"goze\" were not uncommon with such performers mentioned in the Tōdō's late-eighteenth-century accounts. Although not bona fide members of the guild, \"goze\" held annual festivals, and this profession continued to be viable into the mid-1900s.\n\nThough blindness in Japanese society has historically been stigmatized \"as the result of a Buddhist interpretation of the condition as a form of karmic punishment\", other factors also led to the marginalization and discrimination of blind musicians. In general, the blind were treated according to the restrictions of their societal rank. In other words, commoner townsman (\"chōnin\") and warrior–rank blind people \"were allowed to engage in the professions available to all of similar rank, within the constraints of their visual impairment\", while those in agrarian households were excepted to contribute to the payment of land taxes via any means of labor possible. However, the most common professions for all such peoples included music, massage, acupuncture and moxa therapy, while ritual work was common in specialized locations.\n\nAs for itinerant performers, the most affluent could \"make a living during the Edo period as teachers and performers based at their homes\", while the rest (representing the majority of \"zatō\" and \"goze\") relied on \"kadozuke\", regarded as a form of begging, despite its ritual associations. Door-to-door performances delivered by professionals associated to shrines and temples also occurred in the historical practice of seasonal rites and celebrations for farming areas; they were considered to be of low status by the middle class, however, and were affiliated with the Sanjō districts in which \"the discriminated classes\" lived. However, folk beliefs in the visits of \"kami\" during such harvest festivals to rid villagers of impurity upon receiving gifts from householders may have provided a socio-cultural basis for the willingness to offer food and money to itinerant performers; further, \"kadozuke\" was seen as an act of merit.\n\nAccording to Hugh de Ferranti, iconographic and literary sources generally portray \"biwa hōshi\" as solitary and pitiable figures, though wealthy and powerful individuals also exist in such representations. Sometimes they are depicted as mysterious, frightening, and potentially dangerous individuals while in other sources, they are \"ridiculous\" characters \"to be made fun of, at times with unbridled cruelty\". Folklore links \"biwa hōshi\" to ghosts through their placation of wronged spirits and the chinkon ritual performance, accounts for their fearful quality. However, Kyōgen plays called Zatō-mono feature deliberate tricking of a blind \"zatō\" so that he becomes lost and disoriented, or suffers losses and misunderstanding. Such action is provoked by sighted individuals for pure amusement, as in the stories of Saru \"zatō\" and Tsukimi \"zatō\". Picture scrolls marry this \"similar sense of \"biwa hōshi\" as bizarre, somewhat frightening figures who can nevertheless be taunted\". In these images, people \"look out from their houses at the biwa players and appear to be laughing or jeering at them\", while children run away from and dogs bark at them.\n\nThe present trend of scholarly analysis is to consider the \"heike\"'s origin as having arisen first as a biwa recitation for the purpose of spreading Buddhism. According to the \"Tsurezuregusa\" or \"Essays in Idleness\", in the reign of the cloistered emperor Go-Toba, Yukinaga – the man in charge of the household of the chief advisor to the emperor, Fujiwara Kanezane – often exchanged poems with the imperial court. He was invited to an imperial discourse on poems, and unable to recall two of the seven virtues, was thus named the Jack of Five Virtues. Embarrassed, he gave up on learning poetry and took the tonsure, and became a monk under the abbot Jien of the Tendai sect. Jien was known to gather talent at the Shōren-in temple on Mount Hiei in Kyoto to discuss ways of spreading the Tendai faith. Many here were \"biwa hōshi\". It is in this way that Yukinaga legendarily wrote the script of the \"Tale of the Heike\", and taught it to a \"mōsō-biwa\" from eastern Japan named Shōbutsu, renowned for his impressive narrative delivery and extensive knowledge of warriors, bows, and horses.\n\nAccording to George Gish, there were five essential ingredients for the development of the Heike:\n\n\n\"Heikyoku\" musically is influenced by Buddhist chant, and the \"kōshiki\" and \"shōmyō\" traditions of the \"biwa\" from the 11th and 12th centuries. Indeed, it is a combination of the \"monogatari\" style practiced by \"gaku-\" and \"mōsō-biwa\", and \"shōmyō\" narrative. Author Yukinaga brought elements of the court tradition, while Jien offered shomyo aspects. Shōbutsu as a Kyoto-mōsō and a \"biwa hōshi\" brought unique perspectives as well.\n\nThe \"heike-biwa\" instrument itself is a combination of \"gaku-\" and \"mōsō-biwa\" predecessors. Indeed, the relative average distance between the frets is equal to that of \"heike-biwa\", as are the relative height of the frets. From Shobutsu, two schools emerged, the Yasaka-ryū School, led by Jōgen, and Ichikata-ryū School, headed by Jōichi. Akashi Kakuichi was Jōichi's disciple and a favorite of shōgun Ashikaga Takauji, possibly due to blood relations. Kakuichi soon gained the rank of \"kengyō\", the head of guild for the blind, the Tōdō; he died in 1371, the peak of \"heike-biwa\".\n\nMusically, development continued with the Ichikata-ryū, with it spreading into four separate branches. Now, during the Edo period, the main branches split further with the influence by \"shamisen\" style. The main schools were Hatano-ryū and Maeda-ryū, named after their respective founders; intense rivalry between the schools, compounded by changes in music world at large, contributed to the decline of the \"heike\" tradition.\n\nThe growing utilization of the \"shamisen\" by the mid 16th century had precipitated new innovations in popular music. Some of the earliest innovations were carried out by some \"heike\" players during this musical tradition. They would use a \"biwa\" type plectrum on the \"shamisen\" to emulate the \"biwa\" buzzing effect and sounds.\n\nThe \"shamisen\" resulted in alluring new creative opportunities, attracting musicians, and their patrons and listeners along with them. The new idiom of song made the old styles of \"heikyoku\" antiquated, especially with the \"koto\" as new instrument.\n\nBlind musicians\n\n"}

The black dog is essentially a nocturnal apparition, some of them shapeshifters, and are often said to be associated with the Devil or described as a ghost or hellhound. Its appearance was regarded as a portent of death. It is generally supposed to be larger than a normal dog and often has large glowing eyes. It is sometimes associated with electrical storms (such as Black Shuck's appearance at Bungay, Suffolk) and also with crossroads, places of execution and ancient pathways.\n\nThe origins of the black dog are difficult to discern. It is uncertain whether the creature originated in the Celtic or Germanic elements of British culture. Throughout European mythology, dogs have been associated with death. Examples of this are the (Welsh), (Norse) and Cerberus (Greek), all of whom were in some way guardians of the Underworld. This association seems to be due to the scavenging habits of dogs. It is possible that the black dog is a survival of these beliefs.\n\nBlack dogs are generally regarded as sinister or malevolent, and a few (such as the Barghest and Shuck) are said to be directly harmful. They may also serve as familiar spirits for witches and warlocks. Some black dogs, however, such as the Gurt Dog in Somerset and the Black Dog of the Hanging Hills in Connecticut, are said to behave benevolently. Some, known as guardian black dogs, guide travellers at night onto the right path or guard them from danger.\n\nSome of the better-known black dogs are the Barghest of Yorkshire and Black Shuck of East Anglia. Various other forms are recorded in folklore in Britain and elsewhere. Other names are Hairy Jack, Padfoot, Skriker, Churchyard Beast, Shug Monkey, Capelthwaite, Moddey Dhoo (or Mauthe Doog), Hateful Thing, Swooning Shadow, Bogey Beast, Gytrash (or Guytrash), Oude Rode Ogen (Flanders), Tibicena (Canary Islands) and Dip (Catalonia). Although the Church Grim is not a Barghest or Shuck, it can also take the form of a large black dog.\n\nBlack dogs have been reported from almost all the counties of England, the exceptions being Middlesex and Rutland.\n\n\nA Barghest (or Barguest) is said to roam the Snickelways and side roads of York, preying on passersby, and has also been seen near Clifford's Tower. To see the monstrous dog is said to be a warning of impending doom.\n\nA man who lived in a village near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire would go each morning and night to milk his cows in a distant field. One night on his way there he encountered a sinister black dog, and every night thereafter until he brought a friend along with him. When the dog appeared again he attacked it using the yoke of his milk pails as a weapon, but when he did so the dog vanished and the man fell senseless to the ground. He was carried home alive but remained speechless and paralytic for the rest of his life.\n\nNear the town of Lyme Regis in Dorset stood a farmhouse that was haunted by a black dog. This dog never caused any harm, but one night the master of the house in a drunken rage tried to attack it with an iron poker. The dog fled to the attic where it leaped out through the ceiling, and when the master struck the spot where the dog vanished he discovered a hidden cache of gold and silver. The dog was never again seen indoors, but to this day it continues to haunt at midnight a lane which leads to the house called Haye Lane (or Dog Lane). Dogs who are allowed to stray in this area late at night have often mysteriously disappeared. A bed and breakfast in Lyme Regis is named The Old Black Dog, and part of the legend states that the man who discovered the treasure used it to build an inn that originally stood on the site.\n\nThe Black Dog of Newgate has been said to haunt the Newgate Prison for over 400 years, appearing before executions. According to legend, in 1596 a scholar was sent to the prison for witchcraft, but was killed and eaten by starving prisoners before he was given a trial. The dog was said to appear soon after, and although the terrified men killed their guards and escaped, the beast is said to have hunted them down and killed them wherever they fled. Grim (or Fairy Grim) is the name of a shapeshifting fairy that sometimes took the form of a black dog in the 17th-century pamphlet \"The Mad Pranks and Merry Jests of Robin Goodfellow\". He was also referred to as the Black Dog of Newgate, but though he enjoyed frightening people he never did any serious harm.\n\nIn the village of Northorpe in the West Lindsey district of Lincolnshire (not to be confused with Northorpe in the South Kesteven district) the churchyard was said to be haunted by a \"Bargest\". Some black dogs are said to be human beings with the power of shapeshifting. In another nearby village there lived an old man who was reputed to be a wizard. It was claimed that he would transform into a black dog and attack his neighbours' cattle. It is uncertain if there was any connection between the barghest and the wizard.\n\nIn the parish of Tring, Hertfordshire, a chimney sweep named Thomas Colley was executed by hanging in 1751 for the drowning murder of Ruth Osborne whom he accused of being a witch. Colley's spirit now haunts the site of the gibbet in the form of a black dog, and the clanking of his chains can also be heard. In one tale a pair of men who encountered the dog saw a burst of flame before it appeared in front of them, big as a Newfoundland with the usual burning eyes and long sharp teeth. After a few minutes it disappeared, either vanishing like a shadow or sinking into the earth.\n\nIn Norfolk, Suffolk and the northern parts of Essex, a black dog known as Black Shuck (also Old Shuck or Shock) is regarded as malevolent, with stories ranging from terrifying people (or killing them outright) to being a portent of death to themselves or a person close to the victim. There are tales that in 1577 it attacked the church in the market town of Bungay, killing two people and appearing on the same day at the church in the nearby village of Blythburgh, taking the lives of another three and leaving claw marks which remain today. In the parish of Overstrand is a dreary lane known as Shuck's Lane from its frequent appearances there. If the spot where it was just seen is examined then one may find scorch marks and the smell of brimstone. There are also less common tales of a similar dog said to accompany people on their way home in the role of protector rather than an omen of misfortune. Among other possible meanings, the name Shuck is derived from a provincial word meaning \"shaggy\".\n\nIn Westmorland and adjacent parts of Yorkshire there was a belief in Capelthwaite, who could take the form of any quadruped but usually appeared as a large black dog. He took his name from the barn in which he lived called Capelthwaite Barn, near Milnthorpe. He performed helpful services for the people on the farm such as rounding up the sheep, but toward outsiders he was very spiteful and mischievous until one day he was banished by a vicar. As both a helper and a trickster the Capelthwaite behaved more like a domestic hobgoblin than a typical black dog.\n\nThe Church Grim guards a local Christian church and its attached churchyard from those who would profane them including thieves, vandals, witches, and warlocks. For this purpose it was the custom to bury a dog alive under the cornerstone of a church as a foundation sacrifice. Sometimes the grim will toll the bells at midnight before a death occurs. At funerals the presiding clergyman may see the dog looking out from the churchtower and determine from its \"aspect\" whether the soul of the departed was bound for Heaven or Hell. Another tradition states that when a new churchyard was opened the first man buried there had to guard it against the Devil. To save a human soul from such a duty a black dog was buried in the north part of the churchyard as a substitute.\n\nFreybug is the name of an alleged Black Dog appearing in an English manuscript from 1555. In fact, the earliest known mention of the Freybug are the books \"Giants, Monsters, and Dragons\" and \"Spirits, Fairies, Gnomes, and Goblins\" by Carol Rose, who never specified the English manuscript, so the Freybug may be made up by Rose.\n\nGabriel Hounds are dogs with human heads that fly high through the air, and are often heard but seldom seen. They sometimes hover over a house, and this is taken as a sign that death or misfortune will befall those who dwell within. They are also known as Gabriel Ratchets (ratchet being a hound that hunts by scent), Gabble Retchets, and \"sky yelpers\", and like Yeth Hounds they are sometimes said to be the souls of unbaptised children. Popular conceptions of the Gabriel Hounds may have been partially based on migrating flocks of wild geese when they fly at night with loud honking. In other traditions their leader Gabriel is condemned to follow his hounds at night for the sin of having hunted on Sunday (much like the Cornish Dando), and their yelping cry is regarded as a death omen similar to the birds of folklore known as the Seven Whistlers.\n\nGuardian Black Dogs refer to those relatively rare black dogs that are neither omens of death nor causes of it. Instead they guide lost travellers and protect them from danger. Stories of this type became more widespread starting around the early 1900s. In different versions of one popular tale a man was journeying along a lonely forest road at night when a large black dog appeared at his side and remained there until the man left the forest. On his return journey through the wood the dog reappeared and did the same as before. Years later two convicted prisoners told the chaplain that they would have robbed and murdered the wayfarer in the forest that night but were intimidated by the presence of the black dog.\n\nThe Gurt Dog (\"Great Dog\") of Somerset is an example of a benevolent dog. It is said that mothers would allow their children to play unsupervised on the Quantock Hills because they believed the Gurt Dog would protect them. It would also accompany lone travellers in the area, acting as a protector and guide.\n\nThe Gytrash (or Guytrash) is a black dog and death omen of Northern England that haunts solitary ways and also takes the form of a horse, mule and cow. It was popularised in folklore by its mention in the novel \"Jane Eyre\" by Charlotte Brontë.\n\nThere are many tales of ghostly black dogs in Lincolnshire collected by Ethel Rudkin for her 1938 publication \"Folklore\". Such a creature, known locally as Hairy Jack, is said to haunt the fields and village lanes around Hemswell, and there have been reported sightings throughout the county from Brigg to Spalding. Rudkin, who claimed to have seen Hairy Jack herself, formed the impression that black dogs in Lincolnshire were mainly of a gentle nature, and looked upon as a spiritual protector. Hairy Jack was also said to haunt lonely plantations, byways, and waste places where it attacked anyone passing by.\n\nIn Wakefield, Leeds, Pudsey and some areas of Bradford the local version of the legend is known as Padfoot. A death omen like others of its type, it may become visible or invisible and exhibits certain characteristics that give it its name. It is known to follow people with a light padding sound of its paws, then appearing again in front of them or at their side. It can utter a roar unlike the voice of any known animal, and sometimes the trailing of a chain can be heard along with the pad of its feet. It is best to leave the creature alone, for if a person tries to speak to or attacks it then it will have power over them. One story tells of a man who tried to kick the Padfoot and found himself dragged by it through hedge and ditch all the way to his home and left under his own window. Although usually described as black, another tale concerns a man who encountered a white Padfoot. He attempted to strike it with his stick but it passed completely through, and he ran home in fear. Soon afterward he fell sick and died.\n\nThe Skriker (or Shrieker) of Lancashire and Yorkshire is a death omen like many others of its type, but it also wanders invisibly in the woods at night uttering loud, piercing shrieks. It may also take visible form as a large black dog with enormous paws that make a splashing sound when walking, like \"old shoes walking in soft mud\". For this reason the Skriker is also known as Trash, another word for \"trudge\" or \"slog\". The name Skriker is also derived from a dialect word for \"screech\" in reference to its frightful utterances.\n\nThe Yeth Hound (or Yell Hound) is a black dog found in Devon folklore. According to Brewer's \"Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\", the Yeth Hound is a headless dog, said to be the spirit of an unbaptised child, that rambles through the woods at night making wailing noises. It is also mentioned in the \"Denham Tracts\", a 19th-century collection of folklore by Michael Denham. It may have been one inspiration for the ghost dog in \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, described as \"an enormous coal-black hound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen\" - with fire in his eyes and breath (Hausman 1997:47).\n\nThe Wisht or Wish Hounds (\"wisht\" is a dialect word for \"ghostly\" or \"haunted\") are a related phenomenon and some folklorists regard them as identical to the Yeth Hounds. Wistman's Wood on Dartmoor in southern Devon is said to be the home of the Wisht Hounds as they make their hunting forays across the moor. The road known as the Abbot's Way and the valley of the Dewerstone are favoured haunts of the hounds. Their huntsman is presumably the Devil, and it is said that any dog that hears the crying of the hounds will die. One legend states that the ghost of Sir Francis Drake sometimes drove a black hearse coach on the road between Tavistock and Plymouth at night, drawn by headless horses and accompanied by demons and a pack of headless yelping hounds. Charles Hardwick notes that black coach legends are \"relatively modernised versions\" of Wild Hunt and Furious Host traditions. Robert Hunt further defines \"whish\" or \"whisht\" as \"a common term for that weird sorrow which is associated with mysterious causes\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n' (\"Old Red Eyes\") or the \"Beast of Flanders\" was a spirit reported in Flanders, Belgium in the 18th century who would take the form of a large black dog with fiery red eyes. In Wallonia, the southern region of Belgium, folktales mentioned the ' (\"Chained Hound\" in Walloon), a hellish dog bound with a long chain, that was thought to roam in the fields at night. In Germany and the Czech lands it was said that the devil would appear in the form of a large black dog.\n\nThe earliest known report of a black dog was in France in AD 856, when one was said to materialise in a church even though the doors were shut. The church grew dark as it padded up and down the aisle, as if looking for someone. The dog then vanished as suddenly as it had appeared.\n\nIn Lower Brittany there are stories of a ghost ship crewed by the souls of criminals with hellhounds set to guard them and inflict on them a thousand tortures.\n\nBlack dogs with fiery eyes are reported throughout Latin America from Mexico to Argentina under a variety of names including the Perro Negro (Spanish for black dog), Nahual (Mexico), Huay Chivo and Huay Pek (Mexico) - alternatively spelled Uay/Way/Waay Chivo/Pek, Cadejo (Central America), the dog Familiar (Argentina) and the Lobizon (Paraguay and Argentina). They are usually said to be either incarnations of the Devil or a shape-changing sorcerer.\n\nThe legend of a small black dog has persisted in Meriden, Connecticut since the 19th century. The dog is said to haunt the Hanging Hills: a series of rock ridges and gorges that serve as a popular recreation area. The first non-local account came from W. H. C. Pychon in \"The Connecticut Quarterly\", in which it is described as a death omen. It is said that, \"If you meet the Black Dog once, it shall be for joy; if twice, it shall be for sorrow; and the third time shall bring death.\"\n\nA New England black dog story comes from southeastern Massachusetts in the area known, by some, as the Bridgewater Triangle. In the mid-1970s, the town of Abington was, reportedly, terrorized by a large, black dog that caused a panic. A local fireman saw it attacking ponies. Local police unsuccessfully searched for it, at first; but, eventually, a police officer sighted the dog walking along train tracks and shot at it. Apparently, the bullets had no effect on the animal; and, it wandered off never to be seen, again.\n\n\n\n\nThe legend has been referenced many times in popular culture. One of the most famous ghostly black dogs in fiction appears in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\", where a large dog-like creature haunts a family estate. Sherlock Holmes is brought in to determine if the dog is in fact real or supernatural. This story makes use of folktales where black dogs symbolize death.\n\n\n"}

His devoutly religious mother\ntook her sons to the Te Awamutu Methodist Church on Sundays. Tamaki describes his father as an alcoholic who showed no interest in fatherhood. During Tamaki's childhood the family moved from the farm to Te Awamutu and then on to Tokoroa in 1970. While in Tokoroa Tamaki became interested in rugby union and a little later came to enjoy pig-hunting and participating in a rock-band playing the pub circuit. Two of Tamaki's brothers, Doug and Mike, are well-known tourism venture operators in Rotorua.\n\nTamaki dropped out of secondary school at fifteen, before completing the fourth form and took a labour job in the forestry industry. In his teens he impregnated Hannah Lee and the unwed couple moved to Te Awamutu, where Tamaki worked on a dairy farm owned by his uncle and aunt. Tamaki and Lee had their first child, Jasmine, in December 1978. Later at 21, Tamaki joined the Ngaruawahia Apostolic Church. He lost his farm job and he and Lee returned to Tokoroa, where he attended the Tokoroa Apostolic Church. Tamaki became heavily involved with the church after pastor Manuel Renata baptised him in December 1979. Since Tamaki and his partner had not married, Renata would not allow him to carry out all the functions of the church. Tamaki and Lee then married at the Tokoroa Presbyterian Church on 22 March 1980. Fourteen months later they had their second child, a girl named Jamie.\n\nIn 1982 the Tamakis attended the Apostolic Church's Te Nikau Bible College in Paraparaumu, and also had their third child, Samuel. Tamaki became an ordained elder, and then (in September 1984) a pastor in the Tokoroa Apostolic Church. Tamaki went on to establish the Rosetown Community Church in Te Awamutu, the Lake City Church in Rotorua, City Church and then Destiny Church in Auckland.\n\nOn 18 June 2005 kaumatua and Destiny Pastor Manuel Renata ordained Tamaki as bishop of the Destiny Church movement (which totals 15 churches throughout New Zealand and Australia).\n\nTamaki advocates prosperity theology. \n\nIn mid-April 2018, it was reported that Tamaki had sustained two second-degree burns to his face and body after a botched attempt to burn rubbish. Tamaki announced to members of his congregation that he was recovering and praised his wife and hospital staff for aiding his recovery.\n\nIn 2003 several members of the Destiny Church started the Destiny New Zealand political party, led by Richard Lewis. The party ran candidates in most electorates in the 2005 general election, but garnered less than 1 percent of the vote – well short of the 5 percent threshold required to enter Parliament without winning an electorate seat.\n\nDestiny New Zealand was promoted by a nationwide tour and DVD labelled \"A Nation Under Siege\". Tamaki features in the DVD and accompanied the tour. The DVD shows Tamaki decrying what he sees as four problems with New Zealand society: \"a Government gone evil, a radical homosexual agenda, the media: a modern day witchcraft\" and \"the retreat of religion in New Zealand\".\n\nIn 2004, Tamaki predicted the Destiny Church would be \"ruling the nation\" before its tenth anniversary in 2008.\n\nDestiny Church claimed a close relationship with New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Atlanta, USA, the church of Bishop Eddie Long, until at least September 2010. In his autobiography Tamaki wrote a chapter titled \"Spiritual Father – a long time coming\", in which he described meeting \"my spiritual father\", Eddie Long, in 2002. In October 2003, Long travelled to New Zealand after Tamaki invited him to address Destiny Church members. Tamaki wrote, \"... the ease of our connection and the confirmation of a date was entirely in line with Kingdom principle – when God speaks, do it\". Long travelled to New Zealand again subsequently and Tamaki usually met him each year at church conferences.\n\nAt the Nelson meeting of the Destiny New Zealand \"A Nation Under Siege\" tour, Tamaki attacked the media, the government, the Green Party and Grey Power (a lobby group for the elderly), referring to the Greens as \"pagans\", Grey Power as \"self centred\" and the media as \"modern day witchcraft\".\n\nIn 2004 the \"Sunday Star-Times\" reported that Mr Tamaki \"hijacked\" $450,000 from elderly couple Barry and Marian Wilson. The Wilsons lent the money, which they had received from the sale of nautical clothing label Line7 in the mid-'90s, on the understanding that it was to be used to purchase a block of land in Rotorua for the construction of a church. It was reported that after almost 10 years and countless attempts to contact Mr Tamaki and his wife Hannah, the Wilsons had given up hope of ever recovering the full amount. The \"Sunday Star-Times\" asked Mr Tamaki for a response to a series of questions regarding the loan, but he declined to respond.\n\nIn 2004 \"Sunday\" broadcast a documentary of Tamaki and of the Destiny Church. Dr Philip Culbertson of the University of Auckland said: \"As far as I can tell it's a cult\".\n\nIn July 2005 Tamaki had directed \"highly offensive abuse\" at Newstalk ZB host Mike Yardley while off-air during an interview on 20 July.\nIn his autobiography Tamaki denies that the abuse happened.\n\nIn May 2006 a poll ranked Tamaki the least-trusted of 75 prominent New Zealanders.\nIn June 2006 Tamaki expressed opposition to Sue Bradford's private members Child Discipline Bill, which removed the legal defence of \"reasonable force\" for prosecutions of parents who have assaulted their children.\n\nIn May 2007 the Reader's Digest \"Most Trusted People\"' poll again ranked Tamaki as New Zealand's least trusted of 75 prominent persons, followed by Ahmed Zaoui and Don Brash. He was again ranked least-trusted in 2012 in a list of 100, this time followed by Hone Harawira and Kim Dotcom.\n\nIn July 2008 TV3 broadcast \"Inside New Zealand:The Life of Brian\", a documentary by reporter Ross Jennings. Jennings claimed to \"go inside the head of the Destiny Church’s home, inside his boat, inside his church and yes, even inside his flashy wardrobe.\"\n\nIn a Close-Up TV interview on the subject Tamaki denied that his church is a cult claiming that \"if we are a cult then the Catholics, the Presbyterians, the Methodists, the Baptists, and the Pentecostals are all cults as well. Because we believe – we have the same actual orthodox tenets of belief.\"\n\nRichard Lewis, spokesperson for Destiny, earlier in the same interview deflected the criticism by re-defining the term in a pejorative sense saying \"Well a cult is umm some exclusive community out in the backdrops of nowhere, but Destiny is the opposite of that; we’re in the middle of Mt Wellington, our doors are always open, as Bishop says; we broadcast live, we’re an open book\".\n\nRadio Pacific host John Banks aired an interview with Tamaki that attacked a New Zealand AIDS Foundation's \"takatāpui\" (Māori for LGBT-person) HIV-prevention project, in which Tamaki referred to traditional Māori pre-colonial intolerance for male homosexuality, painting a picture of a society which, he claimed, exterminated gay and lesbian people. However, many Māori academic authorities question the basis for this claim.\n\nThe broadcasting of Tamaki's preaching against homosexuality on Television New Zealand has led to numerous complaints to the Broadcasting Standards Authority.\nTelevision New Zealand pulled the original opening episode of his series \"Higher Ground\", because it \"had language and phrases that did not meet industry standards of accuracy, fairness and balance\".\n\nTamaki does not recognise the sex-reassignment surgery of the transgender former MP Georgina Beyer: Tamaki referred to Beyer in his autobiography as a male.\n\nOn 16 November 2016, Brian Tamaki drew controversy when he made statements during a sermon that the 2010 and 2011 Christchurch earthquakes were divine retribution for sinful behavior including murder and homosexuality. These statements preceded the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake by a few hours. Tamaki's comments were condemned by leading New Zealand public figures including the Mayor of Christchurch Bob Parker, Prime Minister John Key, and the Anglican bishop of Dunedin, Kelvin Wright. One Auckland-based critic Aaron Smithson also organized a Change.org petition calling on Prime Minister Key to revoke Destiny Church's tax-free status. On 17 November, Tamaki responded by accusing the media of bias and sensationalizing his statements.\n\nOn 19 April 2018, Tamaki tweeted his support for Australian rugby union player Israel Folau's comments condemning homosexuality.\n\nTamaki regards the perceived lack of male leadership in New Zealand, including the leadership over one's family, as \"the work of the devil\". He claims that Parliament reflects this alleged lack of male leadership. In his autobiography he defends his attitude towards women by pointing to the role of his wife Pastor Hannah Tamaki in the Destiny Church organisation, and also says \"God is very specific about the role and function of men\".\n\nTrans woman MP Georgina Beyer confronted Tamaki at the \"Enough is Enough\" protest in Wellington in August 2004, charging \"Your hatred is totally intolerable\". Beyer also compared Tamaki to despots like Robert Mugabe in a 3 News interview.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38310", "title": "Cannabis", "text": "Cannabis\n\nCannabis () is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cannabaceae. The number of species within the genus is disputed. Three species may be recognized: \"Cannabis sativa\", \"Cannabis indica\", and \"Cannabis ruderalis\"; \"C. ruderalis\" may be included within \"C. sativa\"; or all three may be treated as subspecies of a single species, \"C. sativa\". The genus is widely accepted as being indigenous to and originating from Central Asia, with some researchers also including upper South Asia in its origin.\n\nThe plant is also known as hemp, although this term is often used to refer only to varieties of \"Cannabis\" cultivated for non-drug use. Cannabis has long been used for hemp fibre, for hemp oils, for medicinal purposes, and as a recreational drug. Industrial hemp products are made from cannabis plants selected to produce an abundance of fiber. To satisfy the UN Narcotics Convention, some cannabis strains have been bred to produce minimal levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the principal psychoactive constituent. Some strains have been selectively bred to produce a maximum of THC (a cannabinoid), the strength of which is enhanced by curing the flowers. Various compounds, including hashish and hash oil, are extracted from the plant.\n\nGlobally, in 2013, 60,400 kilograms of cannabis were produced legally. In 2014 there were an estimated 182.5 million cannabis users (3.8% of the population aged 15–64). This percentage has not changed significantly between 1998 and 2014.\n\nCannabis is an annual, dioecious, flowering herb. The leaves are palmately compound or digitate, with serrate leaflets. The first pair of leaves usually have a single leaflet, the number gradually increasing up to a maximum of about thirteen leaflets per leaf (usually seven or nine), depending on variety and growing conditions. At the top of a flowering plant, this number again diminishes to a single leaflet per leaf. The lower leaf pairs usually occur in an opposite leaf arrangement and the upper leaf pairs in an alternate arrangement on the main stem of a mature plant.\n\nThe leaves have a peculiar and diagnostic venation pattern that enables persons poorly familiar with the plant to distinguish a cannabis leaf from unrelated species that have confusingly similar leaves (see illustration). As is common in serrated leaves, each serration has a central vein extending to its tip. However, the serration vein originates from lower down the central vein of the leaflet, typically opposite to the position of, not the first notch down, but the next notch. This means that on its way from the midrib of the leaflet to the point of the serration, the vein serving the tip of the serration passes close by the intervening notch. Sometimes the vein will actually pass tangent to the notch, but often it will pass by at a small distance, and when that happens a spur vein (occasionally a pair of such spur veins) branches off and joins the leaf margin at the deepest point of the notch. This venation pattern varies slightly among varieties, but in general it enables one to tell \"Cannabis\" leaves from superficially similar leaves without difficulty and without special equipment. Tiny samples of \"Cannabis\" plants also can be identified with precision by microscopic examination of leaf cells and similar features, but that requires special expertise and equipment.\n\nAll known strains of \"Cannabis\" are wind-pollinated and the fruit is an achene. Most strains of \"Cannabis\" are short day plants, with the possible exception of \"C. sativa\" subsp. \"sativa\" var. \"spontanea\" (= \"C. ruderalis\"), which is commonly described as \"auto-flowering\" and may be day-neutral.\n\n\"Cannabis\" is predominantly dioecious, having imperfect flowers, with staminate \"male\" and pistillate \"female\" flowers occurring on separate plants. \"At a very early period the Chinese recognized the \"Cannabis\" plant as dioecious\", and the (c. 3rd century BCE) \"Erya\" dictionary defined \"xi\" \"male \"Cannabis\"\" and \"fu\" (or \"ju\" ) \"female \"Cannabis\". Male flowers are normally borne on loose panicles, and female flowers are borne on racemes.\n\nMany monoecious varieties have also been described, in which individual plants bear both male and female flowers. (Although monoecious plants are often referred to as \"hermaphrodites\", true hermaphrodites – which are less common in \"Cannabis\" – bear staminate and pistillate structures together on individual flowers, whereas monoecious plants bear male and female flowers at different locations on the same plant.) Subdioecy (the occurrence of monoecious individuals and dioecious individuals within the same population) is widespread. Many populations have been described as sexually labile.\n\nAs a result of intensive selection in cultivation, \"Cannabis\" exhibits many sexual phenotypes that can be described in terms of the ratio of female to male flowers occurring in the individual, or typical in the cultivar. Dioecious varieties are preferred for drug production, where the female flowers are used. Dioecious varieties are also preferred for textile fiber production, whereas monoecious varieties are preferred for pulp and paper production. It has been suggested that the presence of monoecy can be used to differentiate licit crops of monoecious hemp from illicit drug crops. However, \"sativa\" strains often produce monoecious individuals, probably as a result of inbreeding.\n\n\"Cannabis\" has been described as having one of the most complicated mechanisms of sex determination among the dioecious plants. Many models have been proposed to explain sex determination in \"Cannabis\".\n\nBased on studies of sex reversal in hemp, it was first reported by K. Hirata in 1924 that an XY sex-determination system is present. At the time, the XY system was the only known system of sex determination. The X:A system was first described in Drosophila spp in 1925. Soon thereafter, Schaffner disputed Hirata's interpretation, and published results from his own studies of sex reversal in hemp, concluding that an X:A system was in use and that furthermore sex was strongly influenced by environmental conditions.\n\nSince then, many different types of sex determination systems have been discovered, particularly in plants. Dioecy is relatively uncommon in the plant kingdom, and a very low percentage of dioecious plant species have been determined to use the XY system. In most cases where the XY system is found it is believed to have evolved recently and independently.\n\nSince the 1920s, a number of sex determination models have been proposed for \"Cannabis\". Ainsworth describes sex determination in the genus as using \"an X/autosome dosage type\".\n\nThe question of whether heteromorphic sex chromosomes are indeed present is most conveniently answered if such chromosomes were clearly visible in a karyotype. \"Cannabis\" was one of the first plant species to be karyotyped; however, this was in a period when karyotype preparation was primitive by modern standards (see History of Cytogenetics). Heteromorphic sex chromosomes were reported to occur in staminate individuals of dioecious \"Kentucky\" hemp, but were not found in pistillate individuals of the same variety. Dioecious \"Kentucky\" hemp was assumed to use an XY mechanism. Heterosomes were not observed in analyzed individuals of monoecious \"Kentucky\" hemp, nor in an unidentified German cultivar. These varieties were assumed to have sex chromosome composition XX. According to other researchers, no modern karyotype of \"Cannabis\" had been published as of 1996. Proponents of the XY system state that Y chromosome is slightly larger than the X, but difficult to differentiate cytologically.\n\nMore recently, Sakamoto and various co-authors have used RAPD to isolate several genetic marker sequences that they name Male-Associated DNA in \"Cannabis\" (MADC), and which they interpret as indirect evidence of a male chromosome. Several other research groups have reported identification of male-associated markers using RAPD and AFLP. Ainsworth commented on these findings, stating,\n\nEnvironmental sex determination is known to occur in a variety of species. Many researchers have suggested that sex in \"Cannabis\" is determined or strongly influenced by environmental factors. Ainsworth reviews that treatment with auxin and ethylene have feminizing effects, and that treatment with cytokinins and gibberellins have masculinizing effects. It has been reported that sex can be reversed in \"Cannabis\" using chemical treatment. A PCR-based method for the detection of female-associated DNA polymorphisms by genotyping has been developed.\n\n\"Cannabis\" plants produce a group of chemicals called cannabinoids, which produce mental and physical effects when consumed.\n\nCannabinoids, terpenoids, and other compounds are secreted by glandular trichomes that occur most abundantly on the floral calyxes and bracts of female plants. As a drug it usually comes in the form of dried flower buds (marijuana), resin (hashish), or various extracts collectively known as hashish oil. In the early 20th century, it became illegal in most of the world to cultivate or possess \"Cannabis\" for sale or personal use.\n\"Cannabis\", like many organisms, is diploid, having a chromosome complement of 2n=20, although polyploid individuals have been artificially produced. The first genome sequence of \"Cannabis\", which is estimated to be 820 Mb in size, was published in 2011 by a team of Canadian scientists.\n\nThe genus \"Cannabis\" was formerly placed in the nettle (Urticaceae) or mulberry (Moraceae) family, and later, along with the genus \"Humulus\" (hops), in a separate family, the hemp family (Cannabaceae sensu stricto). Recent phylogenetic studies based on cpDNA restriction site analysis and gene sequencing strongly suggest that the Cannabaceae sensu stricto arose from within the former family Celtidaceae, and that the two families should be merged to form a single monophyletic family, the Cannabaceae sensu lato.\n\nVarious types of \"Cannabis\" have been described, and variously classified as species, subspecies, or varieties:\n\n\"Cannabis\" plants produce a unique family of terpeno-phenolic compounds called cannabinoids, some of which produce the \"high\" which may be experienced from consuming marijuana. There are 483 identifiable chemical constituents known to exist in the cannabis plant, and at least 85 different cannabinoids have been isolated from the plant. The two cannabinoids usually produced in greatest abundance are cannabidiol (CBD) and/or Δ-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), but only THC is psychoactive. Since the early 1970s, \"Cannabis\" plants have been categorized by their chemical phenotype or \"chemotype\", based on the overall amount of THC produced, and on the ratio of THC to CBD. Although overall cannabinoid production is influenced by environmental factors, the THC/CBD ratio is genetically determined and remains fixed throughout the life of a plant. Non-drug plants produce relatively low levels of THC and high levels of CBD, while drug plants produce high levels of THC and low levels of CBD. When plants of these two chemotypes cross-pollinate, the plants in the first filial (F) generation have an intermediate chemotype and produce intermedite amounts of CBD and THC. Female plants of this chemotype may produce enough THC to be utilized for drug production.\nWhether the drug and non-drug, cultivated and wild types of \"Cannabis\" constitute a single, highly variable species, or the genus is polytypic with more than one species, has been a subject of debate for well over two centuries. This is a contentious issue because there is no universally accepted definition of a species. One widely applied criterion for species recognition is that species are \"groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations which are reproductively isolated from other such groups.\" Populations that are physiologically capable of interbreeding, but morphologically or genetically divergent and isolated by geography or ecology, are sometimes considered to be separate species. Physiological barriers to reproduction are not known to occur within \"Cannabis\", and plants from widely divergent sources are interfertile. However, physical barriers to gene exchange (such as the Himalayan mountain range) might have enabled \"Cannabis\" gene pools to diverge before the onset of human intervention, resulting in speciation. It remains controversial whether sufficient morphological and genetic divergence occurs within the genus as a result of geographical or ecological isolation to justify recognition of more than one species.\n\nThe genus \"Cannabis\" was first classified using the \"modern\" system of taxonomic nomenclature by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, who devised the system still in use for the naming of species. He considered the genus to be monotypic, having just a single species that he named \"Cannabis sativa\" L. (L. stands for Linnaeus, and indicates the authority who first named the species). Linnaeus was familiar with European hemp, which was widely cultivated at the time. In 1785, noted evolutionary biologist Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck published a description of a second species of \"Cannabis\", which he named \"Cannabis indica\" Lam. Lamarck based his description of the newly named species on plant specimens collected in India. He described \"C. indica\" as having poorer fiber quality than \"C. sativa\", but greater utility as an inebriant. Additional \"Cannabis\" species were proposed in the 19th century, including strains from China and Vietnam (Indo-China) assigned the names \"Cannabis chinensis\" Delile, and \"Cannabis gigantea\" Delile ex Vilmorin. However, many taxonomists found these putative species difficult to distinguish. In the early 20th century, the single-species concept was still widely accepted, except in the Soviet Union where \"Cannabis\" continued to be the subject of active taxonomic study. The name \"Cannabis indica\" was listed in various Pharmacopoeias, and was widely used to designate \"Cannabis\" suitable for the manufacture of medicinal preparations.\n\nIn 1924, Russian botanist D.E. Janichevsky concluded that ruderal \"Cannabis\" in central Russia is either a variety of \"C. sativa\" or a separate species, and proposed \"C. sativa\" L. var. \"ruderalis\" Janisch, and \"Cannabis ruderalis\" Janisch, as alternative names. In 1929, renowned plant explorer Nikolai Vavilov assigned wild or feral populations of \"Cannabis\" in Afghanistan to \"C. indica\" Lam. var. \"kafiristanica\" Vav., and ruderal populations in Europe to \"C. sativa\" L. var. \"spontanea\" Vav. In 1940, Russian botanists Serebriakova and Sizov proposed a complex classification in which they also recognized \"C. sativa\" and \"C. indica\" as separate species. Within \"C. sativa\" they recognized two subspecies: \"C. sativa\" L. subsp. \"culta\" Serebr. (consisting of cultivated plants), and \"C. sativa\" L. subsp. \"spontanea\" (Vav.) Serebr. (consisting of wild or feral plants). Serebriakova and Sizov split the two \"C. sativa\" subspecies into 13 varieties, including four distinct groups within subspecies \"culta\". However, they did not divide \"C. indica\" into subspecies or varieties.\n\nIn the 1970s, the taxonomic classification of \"Cannabis\" took on added significance in North America. Laws prohibiting \"Cannabis\" in the United States and Canada specifically named products of \"C. sativa\" as prohibited materials. Enterprising attorneys for the defense in a few drug busts argued that the seized \"Cannabis\" material may not have been \"C. sativa\", and was therefore not prohibited by law. Attorneys on both sides recruited botanists to provide expert testimony. Among those testifying for the prosecution was Dr. Ernest Small, while Dr. Richard E. Schultes and others testified for the defense. The botanists engaged in heated debate (outside of court), and both camps impugned the other's integrity. The defense attorneys were not often successful in winning their case, because the intent of the law was clear.\n\nIn 1976, Canadian botanist Ernest Small and American taxonomist Arthur Cronquist published a taxonomic revision that recognizes a single species of \"Cannabis\" with two subspecies: \"C. sativa\" L. subsp. \"sativa\", and \"C. sativa\" L. subsp. \"indica\" (Lam.) Small & Cronq. The authors hypothesized that the two subspecies diverged primarily as a result of human selection; \"C. sativa\" subsp. \"sativa\" was presumably selected for traits that enhance fiber or seed production, whereas \"C. sativa\" subsp. \"indica\" was primarily selected for drug production. Within these two subspecies, Small and Cronquist described \"C. sativa\" L. subsp. \"sativa\" var. \"spontanea\" Vav. as a wild or escaped variety of low-intoxicant \"Cannabis\", and \"C. sativa\" subsp. \"indica\" var. \"kafiristanica\" (Vav.) Small & Cronq. as a wild or escaped variety of the high-intoxicant type. This classification was based on several factors including interfertility, chromosome uniformity, chemotype, and numerical analysis of phenotypic characters.\n\nProfessors William Emboden, Loran Anderson, and Harvard botanist Richard E. Schultes and coworkers also conducted taxonomic studies of \"Cannabis\" in the 1970s, and concluded that stable morphological differences exist that support recognition of at least three species, \"C. sativa\", \"C. indica\", and \"C. ruderalis.\" For Schultes, this was a reversal of his previous interpretation that \"Cannabis\" is monotypic, with only a single species. According to Schultes' and Anderson's descriptions, \"C. sativa\" is tall and laxly branched with relatively narrow leaflets, \"C. indica\" is shorter, conical in shape, and has relatively wide leaflets, and \"C. ruderalis\" is short, branchless, and grows wild in Central Asia. This taxonomic interpretation was embraced by \"Cannabis\" aficionados who commonly distinguish narrow-leafed \"sativa\" strains from wide-leafed \"indica\" strains.\n\nMolecular analytical techniques developed in the late 20th century are being applied to questions of taxonomic classification. This has resulted in many reclassifications based on evolutionary systematics. Several studies of Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and other types of genetic markers have been conducted on drug and fiber strains of \"Cannabis\", primarily for plant breeding and forensic purposes. Dutch \"Cannabis\" researcher E.P.M. de Meijer and coworkers described some of their RAPD studies as showing an \"extremely high\" degree of genetic polymorphism between and within populations, suggesting a high degree of potential variation for selection, even in heavily selected hemp cultivars. They also commented that these analyses confirm the continuity of the \"Cannabis\" gene pool throughout the studied accessions, and provide further confirmation that the genus consists of a single species, although theirs was not a systematic study \"per se\".\n\nKarl W. Hillig, a graduate student in the laboratory of long-time \"Cannabis\" researcher Paul G. Mahlberg at Indiana University, conducted a systematic investigation of genetic, morphological, and chemotaxonomic variation among 157 \"Cannabis\" accessions of known geographic origin, including fiber, drug, and feral populations. In 2004, Hillig and Mahlberg published a chemotaxonomic analysis of cannabinoid variation in their \"Cannabis\" germplasm collection. They used gas chromatography to determine cannabinoid content and to infer allele frequencies of the gene that controls CBD and THC production within the studied populations, and concluded that the patterns of cannabinoid variation support recognition of \"C. sativa\" and \"C. indica\" as separate species, but not \"C. ruderalis.\" The authors assigned fiber/seed landraces and feral populations from Europe, Central Asia, and Turkey to \"C. sativa\". Narrow-leaflet and wide-leaflet drug accessions, southern and eastern Asian hemp accessions, and feral Himalayan populations were assigned to \"C. indica\". In 2005, Hillig published a genetic analysis of the same set of accessions (this paper was the first in the series, but was delayed in publication), and proposed a three-species classification, recognizing \"C. sativa\", \"C. indica\", and (tentatively) \"C. ruderalis\". In his doctoral dissertation published the same year, Hillig stated that principal components analysis of phenotypic (morphological) traits failed to differentiate the putative species, but that canonical variates analysis resulted in a high degree of discrimination of the putative species and infraspecific taxa. Another paper in the series on chemotaxonomic variation in the terpenoid content of the essential oil of \"Cannabis\" revealed that several wide-leaflet drug strains in the collection had relatively high levels of certain sesquiterpene alcohols, including guaiol and isomers of eudesmol, that set them apart from the other putative taxa. Hillig concluded that the patterns of genetic, morphological, and chemotaxonomic variation support recognition of \"C. sativa\" and \"C. indica\" as separate species. He also concluded there is little support to treat \"C. ruderalis\" as a separate species from \"C. sativa\" at this time, but more research on wild and weedy populations is needed because they were underrepresented in their collection.\n\nIn September 2005, New Scientist reported that researchers at the Canberra Institute of Technology had identified a new type of \"Cannabis\" based on analysis of mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA. The New Scientist story, which was picked up by many news agencies and web sites, indicated that the research was to be published in the journal \"Forensic Science International\".\nDespite advanced analytical techniques, much of the cannabis used recreationally is inaccurately classified. One laboratory at the University of British Columbia found that Jamaican Lamb's Bread, claimed to be 100% sativa, was in fact almost 100% indica (the opposite strain). Legalization of cannabis in Canada () may help spur private-sector research, especially in terms of diversification of strains. It should also improve classification accuracy for cannabis used recreationally. Legalization coupled with Canadian government (Health Canada) oversight of production and labelling will likely result in more—and more accurate—testing to determine exact strains and content. Furthermore, the rise of craft cannabis growers in Canada should ensure quality, experimentation/research, and diversification of strains among private-sector producers.\n\nThe scientific debate regarding taxonomy has had little effect on the terminology in widespread use among cultivators and users of drug-type \"Cannabis\". \"Cannabis\" aficionados recognize three distinct types based on such factors as morphology, native range, aroma, and subjective psychoactive characteristics. \"Sativa\" is the most widespread variety, which is usually tall, laxly branched, and found in warm lowland regions. \"Indica\" designates shorter, bushier plants adapted to cooler climates and highland environments. \"Ruderalis\" is the informal name for the short plants that grow wild in Europe and Central Asia.\n\nBreeders, seed companies, and cultivators of drug type \"Cannabis\" often describe the ancestry or gross phenotypic characteristics of cultivars by categorizing them as \"pure indica\", \"mostly indica\", \"indica/sativa\", \"mostly sativa\", or \"pure sativa\".\n\n\"Cannabis\" is used for a wide variety of purposes.\n\nThe use of \"Cannabis\" as a mind-altering drug has been documented by archaeological finds in prehistoric societies in Eurasia and Africa. The oldest written record of cannabis usage is the Greek historian Herodotus's reference to the central Eurasian Scythians taking cannabis steam baths. His (c. 440 BCE) \"Histories\" records, \"The Scythians, as I said, take some of this hemp-seed [presumably, flowers], and, creeping under the felt coverings, throw it upon the red-hot stones; immediately it smokes, and gives out such a vapour as no Grecian vapour-bath can exceed; the Scyths, delighted, shout for joy.\" Classical Greeks and Romans were using cannabis, while in the Middle East, use spread throughout the Islamic empire to North Africa. In 1545, cannabis spread to the western hemisphere where Spaniards imported it to Chile for its use as fiber. In North America, cannabis, in the form of hemp, was grown for use in rope, clothing and paper.\n\nCannabis is a popular recreational drug around the world, only behind alcohol, caffeine and tobacco. In the United States alone, it is believed that over 100 million Americans have tried cannabis, with 25 million Americans having used it within the past year.\n\nThe psychoactive effects of \"cannabis\" are known to have a triphasic nature. Primary psychoactive effects include a state of relaxation, and to a lesser degree, euphoria from its main psychoactive compound, tetrahydrocannabinol. Secondary psychoactive effects, such as a facility for philosophical thinking, introspection and metacognition have been reported among cases of anxiety and paranoia. Finally, the tertiary psychoactive effects of the drug cannabis, can include an increase in heart rate and hunger, believed to be caused by 11-OH-THC, a psychoactive metabolite of THC produced in the liver.\n\nNormal cognition is restored after approximately three hours for larger doses via a smoking pipe, bong or vaporizer. However, if a large amount is taken orally the effects may last much longer. After 24 hours to a few days, minuscule psychoactive effects may be felt, depending on dosage, frequency and tolerance to the drug.\n\nVarious forms of the drug cannabis exist, including extracts such as hashish and hash oil which, because of appearance, are more susceptible to adulterants when left unregulated.\n\nCannabidiol (CBD), which has no psychotropic effects by itself (although sometimes showing a small stimulant effect, similar to caffeine), attenuates, or reduces the higher anxiety levels caused by THC alone.\n\nAccording to Delphic analysis by British researchers in 2007, cannabis has a lower risk factor for dependence compared to both nicotine and alcohol. However, everyday use of cannabis may be correlated with psychological withdrawal symptoms, such as irritability or insomnia, and susceptibility to a panic attack may increase as levels of THC metabolites rise. However, cannabis withdrawal symptoms are typically mild and are never life-threatening.\n\nRisk of adverse outcomes from cannabis use may be reduced by implementation of evidence-based education and intervention tools communicated to the public with practical regulation measures.\n\nMedical cannabis (or medical marijuana) refers to the use of cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids, to treat disease or improve symptoms. Cannabis is used to reduce nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy, to improve appetite in people with HIV/AIDS, and to treat chronic pain and muscle spasms. Cannabinoids are under preliminary research for their potential to affect stroke.\n\nShort-term use increases both minor and major adverse effects. Common side effects include dizziness, feeling tired, vomiting, and hallucinations. Long-term effects of cannabis are not clear. Concerns including memory and cognition problems, risk of addiction, schizophrenia in young people, and the risk of children taking it by accident.\n\nThe term \"hemp\" is used to name the durable soft fiber from the \"Cannabis\" plant stem (stalk). \"Cannabis sativa\" cultivars are used for fibers due to their long stems; Sativa varieties may grow more than six metres tall. However, \"hemp\" can refer to any industrial or foodstuff product that is not intended for use as a drug. Many countries regulate limits for psychoactive compound (THC) concentrations in products labeled as hemp.\n\nCannabis for industrial uses is valuable in tens of thousands of commercial products, especially as fibre ranging from paper, cordage, construction material and textiles in general, to clothing. Hemp is stronger and longer-lasting than cotton. It also is a useful source of foodstuffs (hemp milk, hemp seed, hemp oil) and biofuels. Hemp has been used by many civilizations, from China to Europe (and later North America) during the last 12,000 years. In modern times novel applications and improvements have been explored with modest commercial success.\n\nThe Cannabis plant has a history of medicinal use dating back thousands of years across many cultures. The Yanghai Tombs, a vast ancient cemetery (54 000 m) situated in the Turfan district of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in northwest China, have revealed the 2700-year-old grave of a shaman. He is thought to have belonged to the Jushi culture recorded in the area centuries later in the \"Hanshu\", Chap 96B. Near the head and foot of the shaman was a large leather basket and wooden bowl filled with 789g of cannabis, superbly preserved by climatic and burial conditions. An international team demonstrated that this material contained tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive component of cannabis. The cannabis was presumably employed by this culture as a medicinal or psychoactive agent, or an aid to divination. This is the oldest documentation of cannabis as a pharmacologically active agent.\n\nSettlements which date from c. 2200–1700 BCE in the Bactria and Margiana contained elaborate ritual structures with rooms containing everything needed for making drinks containing extracts from poppy (opium), hemp (cannabis), and ephedra (which contains ephedrine). Although there is no evidence of ephedra being used by steppe tribes, they engaged in cultic use of hemp. Cultic use ranged from Romania to the Yenisei River and had begun by 3rd millennium BC Smoking hemp has been found at Pazyryk.\n\n\"Cannabis\" is first referred to in Hindu Vedas between 2000 and 1400 BCE, in the \"Atharvaveda\". By the 10th century CE, it has been suggested that it was referred to by some in India as \"food of the gods\". Cannabis use eventually became a ritual part of the Hindu festival of Holi. One of the earliest to use this plant in medical purposes was Korakkar, one of the 18 Siddhas. The plant is called \"Korakkar Mooli\" in the Tamil language, meaning Korakkar's herb.\n\nIn Buddhism, cannabis is generally regarded as an intoxicant and may be a hindrance to development of meditation and clear awareness. In ancient Germanic culture, \"Cannabis\" was associated with the Norse love goddess, Freya. An anointing oil mentioned in Exodus is, by some translators, said to contain \"Cannabis\". Sufis have used \"Cannabis\" in a spiritual context since the 13th century CE.\n\nIn modern times, the Rastafari movement has embraced \"Cannabis\" as a sacrament. Elders of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church, a religious movement founded in the United States in 1975 with no ties to either Ethiopia or the Coptic Church, consider \"Cannabis\" to be the Eucharist, claiming it as an oral tradition from Ethiopia dating back to the time of Christ. Like the Rastafari, some modern Gnostic Christian sects have asserted that \"Cannabis\" is the Tree of Life. Other organized religions founded in the 20th century that treat \"Cannabis\" as a sacrament are the THC Ministry, Cantheism, the Cannabis Assembly and the Church of Cognizance. Rastafarians tend to be among the biggest consumers of modern Cannabis use.\n\nCannabis is frequently used among Sufis – the mystical interpretation of Islam that exerts strong influence over local Muslim practices in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Turkey, and Pakistan. Cannabis preparations are frequently used at Sufi festivals in those countries. Pakistan's Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in Sindh province is particularly renowned for the widespread use of cannabis at the shrine's celebrations, especially its annual \"Urs\" festival and Thursday evening \"dhamaal\" sessions - or meditative dancing sessions.\n\nThe word \"cannabis\" is from Greek (') (see Latin '), which was originally Scythian or Thracian. It is related to the Persian \"kanab\", the English \"canvas\" and possibly even to the English \"hemp\" (Old English '). In modern Hebrew, ' ( ) is used but there are those who have theorized that it was referred to in antiquity as קני בושם \"\", a component of the biblical anointing oil. Old Akkadian \"qunnabtu\", Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian \"qunnabu\" were used to refer to the plant meaning \"a way to produce smoke\".\n\n\n\n"}

The new inhabitants are a mixture of Sunni Muslims (from Tripoli), Eastern Orthodox and Maronites from within and the surrounding areas. The buyers and inhabitants of these 5-6 apartment blocks with 4 apartments in each (6 * 4= 24 new families) are mostly from the Sunni sect of Islam who are now unable to afford higher rents and unable to purchase within the tripoli-Al Mina areas. This change in demographics has the ability to shift the demographics of some smaller villagers and towns found closest to the highway south of Tripoli into the Koura. It is estimated that Dahr Al-Ain has a total resident population of 500-700. With the 34 new families, each with the possibility of containing 4 persons per household, that equates to an increase of 96 persons to the village of varying religions as a result from one large piece of land being sold and further subdivided. It would only require a further 4-5 larger pieces of lands to be sold to developers to shift the demographics of the Maronite majority village to a Sunni majority village. With the increase of Sunni inhabitants into the area (attracted to the cheaper properties and rents or a calculated shift in demographics) services pertaining to the new residents e.g. mosques and schools has the ability to increase sectarian tensions as Dahr Al-Ain does not have a mosque and the closest mosque would be situated 5–10 minutes away in Ras Masqa (above Qalamoun) and one being constructed in Dedde. A similar change in demographics is also occurring but to a higher degree to areas surrounding Qalamoun and Tripoli within Ras Masqa (Orthodox and Maronite with Sunni), Dedde (Orthodox with Sunni), Barsa (Orthodox and Maronite with Sunni), Dahr Al-Ain (Maronite with Orthodox and Sunni), Hret al Khalsa (Sunni) and Semriye (Orthodox with Sunni and Maronites). These areas are accessible within ease to and from Tripoli (where most people work, study and have family ties) by a newly asphalted highway that travels to the south from Tripoli through Bahsas and towards Kousba.\n"}

Its headquarters are located in the town of Chowk Mehta, approximately 25 miles north of the city of Amritsar.\n\nIn 1706, after the Battle of Muktsar, Guru Gobind Singh camped at Sabo Ki Talwandi. The place became known as Damdama i.e. a halting place (or breathing place), this place is now referred to as Damdama Sahib (In 1737, Damdama Sahib was considered to be the highest seat of learning for the Sikhs). Damdami Taksal claims to be over 300 years old and names Guru Gobind Singh as its founder. However, some scholars, such as Harjot Oberoi, assert that there is no firm evidence to support this claim.\n\nThe word taksal (literally 'mint') refers to an education institute or community of students who associate themselves to a particular sant or prominent spiritual leader. \"In 1706... Gobind Singh... is said to have founded a distinguished school of exegesis\". It was later headed up by Baba Deep Singh According to the Damdami Taksal, it was entrusted with the responsibility of teaching the reading (\"santhyia\"), analysis (\"vichar\") and recitation of the Sikh scriptures by Guru Gobind Singh.\n\nDamdami Taksal's or Jatha Bhindran Mehta has its main center located at Gurdarshan Parkash gurdwara at Mehta near Moga, Punjab in Amritsar. Damdami Taksal is a branch of bhindran Taksal, a major religious school of traditional Sikh learning. The name Bhindran Taksal was made after the village of Bhindran Kalan where its head Gurbachan Singh Bhindranwale lived. Jatha Bhindran Mehta or Bhindran Taksal is considered the current Damdami Taksal.\n\nDuring the first part of the 20th century Gurbachan Singh Bhindranwale was a widely prominent \"Sant\" teaching a large number of students and today remains an influential figure.\n\nIn 1975, a large event to commemorate the 300th anniversary martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur was attended by Indira Gandhi and the leader of the Damdami Taksal (Kartar Singh Bhindranwale). This was the starting point of tensions between Damdami Taksal and the Indian Congress Government. The dispute was about who was the leader and who had the greater authority over the Sikh people, the Guru Granth Sahib or Indira Gandhi.\n\nThe Damdami Taksal was brought to wider attention by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and the 1978 massacre, the Anandpur Resolution with the Dharm Yudh Morcha of 1982, and later the Khalistan movement.\n\nDuring British Colonial rule, Sunder Singh Bhindranwale set about purging diversity in Sikh doctrine, ritual and practice, hoping to have a uniform Sikh community. Part of this strategy was to have a standardized code of conduct (\"Rehat Maryada\"). Sunder Singh established Gurdwara Gurdarshan Parkash at Mehta, Amritsar district, which now is the headquarters of today's Damdami Taksal.\n\nSunder Singh was succeeded by Gurbachan Singh Bhindranwale in 1930, after whom Kartar Singh Bhindranwale continued his work in 1961. In 1977, after the death of Kartar Singh, Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale became the head of Damdami Taksal. Baba Thakur Singh Bhinderwale took over his Taksal when Sant Jarnail Singh was killed in 1984 by the military assault on Harmander Sahib, referred to as Operation Bluestar. Baba Takhur Singh died in 2004. Current leader of Damdami Taksal is Harnam Singh Dhuma.\n\nThe Damdami Taksal have their own Sikh Code of Conduct, the \"Gurmat Rehat Maryada\", which differs from the \"Rehat Maryada\" published by the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee. Some differences include the reading of \"Ragmala\" after \"Akhand Path\" and not eating meat, fish, and eggs. Damdami Taksal is somewhat influenced by the Nirmale school of thought as the eleventh leader of Damdami Taksal, Sant Baba Bishan Singh Muralewale, studied under Nirmale Sants such as Pundit Tara Singh and Pundit Sadhu Singh during the late 19th century.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "747934", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=747934", "title": "Fall of man", "text": "Fall of man\n\nThe fall of man, or the fall, is a term used in Christianity to describe the transition of the first man and woman from a state of innocent obedience to God to a state of guilty disobedience. Although not named in the Bible, the doctrine of the fall comes from a biblical interpretation of Genesis chapter 3. At first, Adam and Eve lived with God in the Garden of Eden, but the serpent tempted them into eating the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which God had forbidden. After doing so, they became ashamed of their nakedness and God expelled them from the Garden to prevent them from eating from the tree of life and becoming immortal.\n\nFor many Christian denominations, the doctrine of the fall is closely related to that of original sin. They believe that the fall brought sin into the world, corrupting the entire natural world, including human nature, causing all humans to be born into original sin, a state from which they cannot attain eternal life without the grace of God. The Eastern Orthodox Church accepts the concept of the fall but rejects the idea that the guilt of original sin is passed down through generations, based in part on the passage that says a son is not guilty of the sins of his father. Calvinist Protestants believe that Jesus gave his life as a sacrifice for the elect, so they may be redeemed from their sin. Judaism does not have a concept of \"the fall\" or \"original sin\" and has varying other interpretations of the Eden narrative. Lapsarianism, the logical order of God's decrees in relation to the Fall, is the distinction, by some Calvinists, as being supralapsarian (antelapsarian, pre-lapsarian or prelapsarian, before the Fall) or infralapsarian (sublapsarian, postlapsarian, after the Fall).\n\nThe story of the Garden of Eden and the fall of man represents a tradition among the Abrahamic peoples, with a presentation more or less symbolical of certain moral and religious truths.\n\nThe doctrine of the fall of man is extrapolated from Christian exegesis of . According to the narrative, God creates Adam and Eve, the first man and woman. God places them in the Garden of Eden and forbids them to eat fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. The serpent tempts Eve to eat fruit from the forbidden tree, which she shares with Adam and they immediately become ashamed of their nakedness. Subsequently, God banishes Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, condemns Adam to working in order to get what he needs to live and condemns Eve to giving birth in pain, and places cherubim to guard the entrance, so that Adam and Eve will not eat from the \"tree of life\".\n\nThe Book of Jubilees gives time frames for the events that led to the fall of man by stating that the serpent convinced Eve to eat the fruit on the 17th day, of the 2nd month, in the 8th year after Adam's creation (3:17). It also states that they were removed from the Garden on the new moon of the 4th month of that year (3:33).\n\nChristian exegetes of (\"for in the day that you eat of it you shall die\") have applied the day-year principle to explain how Adam died within a day. , and Jubilees 4:29–31 explained that, to God, one day is equivalent to a thousand years and thus Adam died within that same \"day\". The Greek Septuagint, on the other hand, has \"day\" translated into the Greek word for a twenty-four-hour period (ἡμέρα, \"hēméra\").\n\nAccording to the Genesis narrative, during the antediluvian age, human longevity approached a millennium, such as the case of Adam who lived 930 years. Thus, to \"die\" has been interpreted as to become mortal. However, the grammar does not support this reading, nor does the narrative: Adam and Eve are expelled from the Garden lest they eat of the second tree, the tree of life, and gain immortality.\n\nCatholic exegesis of Genesis 3 claims that the fall of man was a \"primeval event, a deed that took place at the beginning of the history of man.\" Traditionally, the fall of Adam and Eve is said to have brought “four wounds” to human nature. These are enumerated by St Bede and others, especially St Thomas Aquinas (STh I-II q. 85, a. 3) They are original sin (lack of sanctifying grace and original justice), concupiscence (the soul's passions are no longer ordered perfectly to the soul’s intellect), physical frailty and death, and darkened intellect and ignorance. These negated or diminished the gifts of God to Adam and Eve of original justice or sanctifying grace, integrity, immortality and infused knowledge. This first sin was \"transmitted\" by Adam and Eve to all of their descendants as original sin, causing humans to be \"subject to ignorance, suffering and the dominion of death, and inclined to sin.\" Although the state of corruption, inherited by humans after the primeval event of Original Sin, is clearly called guilt or sin, it is understood as a sin acquired by the unity of all humans in Adam rather than a personal responsibility of humanity. Even children partake in the effects of the sin of Adam, but not in the responsibility of original sin, as sin is always a personal act. Baptism is considered to erase original sin, though the effects on human nature remain, and for this reason the Catholic Church baptizes even infants who have not committed any personal sin.\n\nEastern Orthodoxy rejects the idea that the guilt of original sin is passed down through generations. It bases its teaching in part on that says a son is not guilty of the sins of his father. The Church teaches that, in addition to their conscience and tendency to do good, men and women are born with a tendency to sin due to the fallen condition of the world. It follows Maximus the Confessor and others in characterising the change in human nature as the introduction of a \"deliberative will\" (θέλημα γνωμικόν) in opposition to the \"natural will\" (θέλημα φυσικόν) created by God which tends toward the good. Thus, according to St Paul in his epistle to the Romans, non-Christians can still act according to their conscience.\n\nOrthodoxy believes that, while everyone bears the consequences of the first sin (that is, death), only Adam and Eve are guilty of that sin. Adam's sin isn't comprehended only as disobedience to God's commandment, but as a change in man's hierarchy of values from theocentricism to anthropocentrism, driven by the object of his lust, outside of God, in this case the tree which was seen to be \"good for food\", and something \"to be desired\" (see also theosis, seeking union with God).\n\nTraditionally, women have received the major blame for the Fall of humanity. The subordination exegesis is that the natural consequences of sin entering the human race, was prophesied by God when the phrase was made: the husband \"will rule over you\". This interpretation is reinforced by comments in the First Epistle to Timothy, where the author gives a rationale for directing that a woman (NIV: possibly \"wife\") \n\nAlternatively, Richard and Catherine Clark Kroeger argue that \"there is a serious theological contradiction in telling a woman that when she comes to faith in Christ, her personal sins are forgiven but she must continue to be punished for the sin of Eve.\" They maintain that judgmental comments against women in reference to Eve is a \"dangerous interpretation, in terms both of biblical theology and of the call to Christian commitment\". They reason that \"if the Apostle Paul was forgiven for what he did ignorantly in unbelief\" including persecuting and murdering Christians, \"and thereafter was given a ministry, why would the same forgiveness and ministry be denied women\" (for the sins of their foremother eons ago)? Addressing that, the Kroegers conclude that Paul was referring to the promise of that through the defeat of Satan on the cross of Jesus Christ, the woman's child (Jesus) would crush the serpent's head, but the serpent would only bruise the heel of her child.\n\nSymbolic aspects of the fall of man are commonly taken to correlate with knowledge gained by experience in the wake of fateful decisions. Some of the Genesis 3 narrative's symbolism may correlate to the experience of the agricultural revolution. The serpent of the Genesis narrative may represent seasonal changes and renewal, as with the symbolism of Sumerian, Egyptian, and other creation myths. In Mesoamerican creation myths, Quetzalcoatl, a feathered serpent agricultural deity, is associated with learning as well as renewal. The leading role of Eve in the Genesis narrative may be attributed to the interest of neolithic women in shifting away from gatherer life in favor of raising crops. Women also may of necessity have taken the role of organizers in early farming settlements, thus effectively leading the shift to agrarian society. Though these settlements may have been relatively egalitarian compared to more modern societies, the Genesis narrative may be interpreted as mourning the hunter-gatherer life as a paradise lost.\n\nIn Gnosticism, the snake is thanked for bringing knowledge to Adam and Eve, and thereby freeing them from the Demiurge's control. The Demiurge banished Adam and Eve, because man was now a threat.\n\nIn Islam, Adam and his wife were misled by Shayṭān, who tempted them with immortality and a kingdom that never decays, saying: \"Your Lord only forbade you this tree, lest ye should become angels or such beings as live for ever\". Adam and Eve had been warned of Shayṭān's scheming against them, and had been commanded by God to avoid the tree Shayṭān referred to. Although God had reminded them that there was enough provision for them \"not to go hungry nor to go naked, nor to suffer from thirst, nor from the sun's heat\", they ultimately gave in to Shayṭān's temptation and partook of the tree anyway. Following this sin, their \"nakedness appeared to them: they began to sew together, for their covering, leaves from the Garden\", and were subsequently sent down from Paradise onto the earth with \"enmity one to another\". However, God also gave them the assurance that \"when there come unto you from Me a guidance, then whoso followeth My guidance, he will not go astray nor come to grief.\"\n\nIn classic Zoroastrianism, humanity is created to withstand the forces of decay and destruction through good thoughts, words and deeds. Failure to do so actively leads to misery for the individual and for his family. This is also the moral of many of the stories of the Shahnameh, the key text of Persian mythology.\n\nThe Alawites believed that they were once luminous stars worshipping ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib in a world of light, but that upon committing sins of pride they were banished from their former state and forced to transmigrate in the world of matter.\n\nIn William Shakespeare's \"Henry V\" (1599), the King describes the betrayal of Lord Scroop – a friend since childhood – as being \"like another fall of man\", referring to the loss of his own faith and innocence the treason has caused.\n\nIn the novel \"Perelandra\" (1943) by C. S. Lewis, the theme of the fall is explored in the context of a new Garden of Eden with a new, green-skinned Adam and Eve on the planet Venus, and with the protagonist the Cambridge scholar Dr. Ransom transported there and given the mission of thwarting Satan and preventing a new fall.\n\nIn the novel \"The Fall\" (1956) by Albert Camus, the theme of the fall is enunciated through the first-person account given in post-war Amsterdam, in a bar called \"Mexico City.\" Confessing to an acquaintance, the protagonist, Jean-Baptiste Clamence, describes the haunting consequence of his refusal to rescue a woman who had jumped from a bridge to her death. The dilemmas of modern Western conscience and the sacramental themes of baptism and grace are explored.\n\nJ. R. R. Tolkien included as a note to his comments about the \"Dialogue of Finrod and Andreth\" (published posthumously in 1993), the Tale of Adanel that is a reimagining of the fall of man inside his Middle-earth's mythos. The story presented Melkor seducing the first Men by making them worship him instead of Eru Ilúvatar, leading to the loss of the \"Edenic\" condition of the human race. The story is part of \"Morgoth's Ring\".\n\nIn both Daniel Quinn's \"Ishmael\" (1992) and \"The Story of B\" (1996) novels, it is proposed that the story of the fall of man was first thought up by another culture watching the development of the now-dominant totalitarian agriculturalist culture.\n\nIn Philip Pullman's \"His Dark Materials\" series (1995, 1997, 2000), the fall is presented in a positive light, as it is the moment at which human beings achieve self-awareness, knowledge, and freedom. Pullman believes that it is not worth being innocent if the price is ignorance.\n\nThe novel \"Lord of the Flies\" explores the fall of man. The storyline depicts young innocent children who turn into savages when they are stranded on a desert island. \"Lord of the Flies\" was originally named \"Strangers from Within\", also showing his views of human nature.\n\nThe theme is also frequently depicted in historical European art. Lucas van Leyden, a Dutch engraver and painter during the Renaissance period, created several different woodcuts featuring Adam and Eve (two were part of his \"Power of Women\" series).\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded when ministers of four other Lutheran church bodies who objected to various positions held in their respective churches, specifically regarding atonement, women's ordination, worship styles, and the \"Lutheran Confessions\", met to discuss these and other issues of concern. This meeting led to the establishment of the General Lutheran Church and to its endorsement of universal salvation, women's ordination, and flexibility with regards to liturgical matters. The church claims to be a successor to the former Evangelical Lutheran General Synod of the United States of America.\n\nThe General Lutheran Church values the \"Lutheran Confessions\" as expressed in the \"Book of Concord\", other works by Martin Luther, and the writings of Samuel Simon Schmucker as theological guides, and allows its ministers and congregations the liberty of conscience to interpret and apply the teachings of the \"Lutheran Confessions\". The church also supports the right and duty of private judgment in the interpretation of the Scriptures. The denomination does, however, expect congregations and ministers to abide by the following set of beliefs:\n\n\nThe denomination bases its belief on universal salvation from Martin Luther's statement, \"God forbid that I should limit the time of acquiring faith to the present life. In the depth of the Divine mercy, there may be an opportunity to win it in the future,\" and from the New Testament: \"And when I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw everyone to myself\"(John 12:32), \"Everyone will see the salvation of God\" (Luke 3:6), and \"Our hope is set on the living God, who is the savior of all people, especially those who believe\" (1 Timothy 4:10).\n\nThe General Lutheran Church is a semi-congregationalist denomination headed by the General Leadership, which consists of the General Minister and the General Pastor. The General Minister is the presiding officer, executive administrator, and spiritual leader of the denomination. The General Minister is invested with the responsibility of ensuring the purpose and mission of the General Lutheran Church are carried out and that the Statement of Faith and the general principles of the Christian faith are adhered to. Responsibilities include overseeing and regulating issues related to the administrative, legislative, ministerial, evangelistic, educational, missionary, benevolent and other interests of the denomination. The General Pastor is appointed by the General Minister and serves to assist, advise, and counsel the General Minister. The General Pastor has no decision-making powers. All final decisions regarding polity and procedure belong exclusively to the General Minister. The National Leadership exercises no control or authority over individual congregations or pastors and only serve in an advisory capacity. The National Leadership assists pastors in crisis situations or by request.\n\nThe General Lutheran Institute of Pastoral Theology offers free certificate courses in systematic theology, Lutheran history, pastoral counseling, biblical languages, pastoral theology, and the Lutheran confessions to meet the academic requirements for ordination as a General Lutheran minister. The courses are taught by qualified faculty who all hold degrees from institutions accredited by agencies recognized by the United States Department of Education or hold accredited status in their respective countries.\n\nThe General Lutheran Church is opposed to same-sex marriage, the ordination of practicing gays and lesbians, and abortions not medically necessary. However, engaging in abusive or malicious behaviors towards the gay and lesbian community, all immigrants, and those who have made the difficult decision to have an abortion are prohibited. The denomination condemns racism, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, and all other types of hate and discrimination at all levels.\n\n\n"}

The newspaper's slogan is \"The Newspaper of Torah Jewry\". It comes with two magazines, \"Inyan\" and \"Binyan\". \"Haaretz\", the newspaper of Israel's secular left, describes \"Hamodia\" as one of the \"most powerful\" newspapers in the Haredi community.\n\n\"Hamodia\" was founded in 1950 by Rabbi Yehuda Leib Levin, son of the Agudat Israel leader Rabbi Yitzhak-Meir Levin of Warsaw and Jerusalem.\n\nIts current director general is Rabbi Chaim Moshe Knopf, and its deputy director general is Knopf's son, Rabbi Elazar Knopf.\n\nThe English edition of \"Hamodia\" is published by Levin's daughter, Ruth Lichtenstein. It was first printed on February 27, 1998, as a weekly paper, and on December 15, 2003, it expanded to include a daily publication as well. The daily edition is published from Monday to Friday, with no edition appearing on Saturday (the Jewish Sabbath), Sunday, or the week of Passover, or the week of Sukkot. The weekly edition is printed on Wednesdays, and includes expanded sections and a glossy magazine. The English-language \"Hamodia\" is published in four editions: United States (daily and weekly), Israel (weekly only), Australia (weekly only), and Britain (weekly only).

Although not Zionist, on ideological grounds, it is right of center in its Israeli coverage. It is very vociferous on the thorny issue of Jerusalem, and opposes even minimal concessions. It includes editorials on all sides of American political and economic issues. However, regarding same-sex marriage, the newspaper does not even use that name, but rather uses \"immorality\" (as in: \"The Supreme Court has announced it will rule in an immorality case\").\n\nTorah and community related topics are more often written by the reporters at the paper, while most of the national and international news is taken from other news sources, such as Reuters and Associated Press.\n\nThe publication adheres to a strict interpretation of Tzniut that prohibits photographs of women on its pages and website. It avoids sensationalism and reveling in tragedies. As Hareidi culture shuns television, internet usage, and the reading of secular newspapers, \"Hamodia\" is one of the few news sources available to many of its readers.

It was founded by A.D. Gordon, Yosef Aharonovich, Yosef Sprinzak and followed a non-Marxist, Zionist, socialist agenda. Hapoel Hatzair was a pacifist, anti-militarist group that sought to establish a Jewish foothold in Palestine through manual labor and agricultural settlement.\n\nHapoel Hatzair was formed in 1905 by ten members of the second wave of Jewish immigrants to Palestine, who came between 1904 and 1914. The new immigrants sought to build a Jewish socialist homeland in Palestine and formed two groups in order to accomplish this: Poale Zion (Workers of Zion) and Hapoel Hatzair. By 1906, Hapoel Hatzair had grown to 90 members. In 1907, it founded a newspaper of the same name. By 1910, the group had grown, although not to huge numbers. There were only 500 members of Hapoel Hatzair and Poale Zion combined. Hapoel Hatzair's commitment to practical Zionism and the conquest of labour created a group that was dedicated to the creation of new Jewish agricultural communities. Hapoel Hatzair settled land bought from Arab effendis (landowners) by the Jewish National Fund in accordance with socialist principles.\n\nWhen Ahdut HaAvoda was formed in 1919, Hapoel Hatzair decided not to join, although some members did leave to join Ahdut HaAvoda. Leaders of Hapoel Hatzair felt that the Labor Union, which had strong political ambitions, would dominate any united group and they did not want this to cause them to compromise Hapoel Hatzair's role as the conscience of the labor movement. By not joining Ahdut HaAvoda, Hapoel Hatzair was forced to enter into the urban worker movement. While powerful among agricultural workers, Hapoel Hatzair did not have a large following in the towns; however, they did have a significant following among writers, teachers, and other intellectuals, which although not helpful in the political arena, did bring more prestige to the group. \n\nOver time, members of Hapoel Hatzair and Ahdut HaAvoda realized that they were duplicating work. As both groups existed as a labor group as well as a political party, they had separate employment exchanges, mutual aid organisations, cultural and social clubs, and sickness funds. In 1920, it was suggested that unite. This led to the formation of the Histadrut, which was a single workers organization to control labor. While these parties had united their labor organizations into the Histadrut, they continued to fight for dominance of this group. In the first election in 1924, Hapoel Hatzair won 27 seats, which was second only to Ahdut HaAvoda, which held 38. While Ahdut HaAvoda was larger, Hapoel Hatzair was more powerful; In 1921 Yosef Sprinzak of Hapoel Hatzair was the first member of the labor movement to be elected to the Zionist Executive.\n\nBy the end of the 1920s, Ahdut HaAvoda, with the help of David Ben-Gurion, had won control of the Histadrut. Economic troubles at the end of the 1920s caused the Histadrut to apply intense pressure to Jewish companies which employed Arabs. Many Jews viewed this as a threat to their livelihood. The Histadrut thus faced opposition and Ben-Gurion saw that a united Histadrut would be more powerful against opposition. He thus united Ahdut HaAvoda and Hapoel Hatzair in December 1930 to create the Mapai party, bringing an end to Hapoel Hatzair. One of the Hapoel Hatzair leaders who joined the senior levels of Mapai was Haim Arlosoroff.\n\nLeading female members of Hapoel Hatzair were among some of the leaders of the Jewish feminist movement. While the only female delegates of the first Histadrut were members of Ahdut HaAvoda, members of Hapoel Hatzair, Ada Fishman-Maimon and Yael Gordon, were invited to attend as guests. While there, Ada Maimon, who was a leader in the struggle for women's suffrage in Jewish institutions, objected to the fact that no delegates to the Histadrut had been chosen by female workers and that they therefore did not represent these women. After gaining support of the leading parties, including her own Hapoel Hatzair, she was granted a position at the Histadrut and two seats were then reserved for delegates who had been elected by women workers themselves.\n\nIn March 1920, at a congress in Prague, the World Union of Hapoel Hatzair and Zeirei Zion formed Hitahdut Olamit (known as Hitahdut). In 1926, at its Berlin third congress, its name was changed to the World Zionist Labour Party Hitahdut. Its youth movement was named Gordonia, after A. D. Gordon. In 1932, it merged with Poale Zion to create Ihud Olami, the World Union of Zionists-Socialists.\n"}

It was a product of the Hindmarsh Island bridge controversy.\n\nIn May 1995, the South Australian media carried reports that the 'secret women's business' had been fabricated. Five Ngarrindjeri women reportedly said that they did not believe in or had never heard of the 'secret women's business' until it had been raised by Doreen Kartinyeri. In June 1995 there were further allegations that two prominent members of the Ngarrindjeri community – Doug and Sarah Milera – had confirmed the allegations of fabrication.\n\nIn response, the South Australian Government established a Royal Commission on 16 June 1995. A former South Australian District Court judge, Mrs Iris Stevens, was appointed as Royal Commissioner. In brief, the Royal Commissioner was appointed to inquire into and report on whether any aspect of the 'women's business' was a fabrication and, if so, how the fabrication occurred, its extent and purpose.\n\nControversy plagued the work of the Royal Commission. The 'proponent women' refused to give evidence to the Commission; 'dissident' Ngarrindjeri women claimed threats and intimidation; Ngarrindjeri elder, Doug Milera reportedly withdrew his allegations that the 'secret women's business' had been fabricated; amateur historian, Betty Fisher, told the Commission she had first been told of the 'secret women's business' in 1960; and anthropologists from the South Australian Museum disputed the existence of the 'secret women's business'.\n\nThe Royal Commission's report was published in December 1995. Its major findings were:\n\n\nThe Howard Government passed the \"Hindmarsh Island Bridge Act (1997)\", which allowed construction to go ahead; and in August 2001, in a civil case in the Federal Court of Australia, Justice John von Doussa rejected claims for damages by the developers, stating that he was not satisfied that the claims of \"secret women's business\" had been fabricated.\n\n"}

It discusses her marriage to a Jewish man, referred to as Ben in the article. Herself being a Christian White American of German descent, she describes her marriage as an interracial marriage. The article also discusses the assimilation of Jews and other minorities into a white American mainstream culture. She writes that she frequently tries \"to see things from the Nazis' point of view,\" to \"the hurt confusion\" of her Jewish husband.\n\nThe essay became the subject of extensive commentary after \"The Atlantic\" published its archive on the Internet in 2008, leading to the article's rediscovery and going viral. The commentary focused on the topics of white privilege and the prejudices in America at the time, and pointed out her naïveté and the fact that \"the author, a liberal-minded young woman, manages nonetheless to be spectacularly wrong about just about everything.\" Jonathan Chait wrote that \"she tries to take a balanced, blame-both-sides-equally approach to the anti-Semitism issue\" and called her \"the world’s first recorded Shiksplainer,\" a portmanteau of the disparaging Yiddish term shiksa, meaning a non-Jewish woman or girl, and mansplainer.

{"id": "174201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=174201", "title": "International Society for Krishna Consciousness", "text": "International Society for Krishna Consciousness\n\nThe International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), known colloquially as the Hare Krishna movement or Hare Krishnas, is a Gaudiya Vaishnava Hindu religious organisation. ISKCON was founded in 1966 in New York City by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada known to his followers as Guru and spiritual master. Its core beliefs are said to be based on select Hindu scriptures, particularly the Bhagavad Gita and the Bhagavata Purana, and the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition, which has had adherents in India since the late 15th century and American and European converts since the early 1900s in North America . In West Virginia, the Prabhupada's Palace of Gold is now a shrine for the founder, who died in 1977.\n\nThe movement is labelled as a sect by anti-cults organisations and some adepts have been accused and condemned of sexual abuse, including towards minors. The New York Times reported similar stories in 1990.\n\nISKCON was formed to spread the practice of Bhakti yoga, in which those involved (\"bhaktas\") dedicate their thoughts and actions towards pleasing, Krishna, their Supreme Lord. Its most rapid expansions in membership as of 2007 have been within India and, especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe.\n\nISKCON devotees follow a disciplic line of Gaudiya Bhagavata Vaishnavas and are the largest branch of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. \"Vaishnavism\" means 'worship of Vishnu', and \"Gauḍa\" refers to the area where this particular branch of Vaishnavism originated, in the Gauda region of West Bengal. Gaudiya Vaishnavism has had a following in India, especially West Bengal and Odisha, for the past five hundred years. Bhaktivedanta Swami disseminated Gaudiya Vaishnava Theology in the Western world through extensive writings and translations, including the \"Bhagavad Gita\", \"Srimad Bhagavatam\" (\"Bhagavata Purana\"), \"Chaitanya Charitamrita\", and other scriptures. These works are now available in more than seventy languages and serve as the scriptures of ISKCON.\n\nKrishna is described as the source of all the avatars of God. Thus ISKCON devotees worship Krishna as the highest form of God, \"svayam bhagavan\", and often refer to him as \"the Supreme Personality of Godhead\" in writing, which was a phrase coined by Prabhupada in his books on the subject. To devotees, Radha represents Krishna's divine female counterpart, the original spiritual potency, and the embodiment of divine love. \"The individual soul is an eternal personal identity which does not ultimately merge into any formless light or void as suggested by the monistic (Advaita) schools of Hinduism\". Prabhupada most frequently offers \"Sanatana-dharma\" and \"Varnashrama dharma\" as more accurate names for the religious system which accepts Vedic authority. It is a monotheistic tradition which has its roots in the theistic Vedanta traditions.\n\nISKCON advocates preaching. Members try to spread Krishna consciousness, primarily by singing the Hare Krishna mantra in public places and by selling books written by the founder. Both of these activities are known within the movement as \"Sankirtan\". Street preaching is one of the most visible activities of the movement. ISKCON street evangelists sometimes invite members of the public to educative activities, such as a meal with an accompanying talk.\n\nA study conducted by E. Burke Rochford Jr. at the University of California found that there are four types of contact between those in ISKCON and prospective members. Those are individually motivated contact, contact made with members in public areas, contact made through personal connections, and contact with sympathizers of the movement who strongly encourage people to join. According to the doctrine of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, one does not need to be born in a Hindu family to take up the practice.\nThere are ISKCON communities around the world with schools, restaurants and farms. In general, funds collected by ISKCON are treated as communal property and used to support the community as a whole and to promote the preaching mission. Many temples also have programs (like Food for Life) to provide meals for the needy. In addition, ISKCON has recently brought the academic study of Krishna into eastern academia as Krishnology.\n\nThe ISKCON Ministry of Education regulates educational activities within ISKCON and oversees the operation of primary, secondary, tertiary, and seminary schools and centres of education. The Ministry of Education also oversees education for religious and sastric study, developed and monitored by the UK-based Vaisnava Training and Education organisation.\n\nThe Bhaktivedanta Institute (BI) is the scientific research branch of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Founded in 1976 by Bhaktivedanta Swami and Bhaktisvarupa Damodara Swami, it aims to advance the study of the nature and origin of life, utilising Vedic insights into consciousness, the self, and the origin of the universe. The institute's motto, in the Sanskrit language, is \"Athato Brahma jijnasa,\" which translates as \"One should inquire into the Supreme.\" Under the directorship of Bhaktisvarupa Damodara Swami, the BI organised four international conferences and hundreds of panel discussions and talks and published over thirty books. Currently, there are a number of branches of BI, with one of the main branches in Mumbai. Ravi Gomatam is the director of BI in Berkeley and Mumbai. The director of BI in Kolkata is Vrajapati Das.\n\nISKCON founded a project called Food for Life, which it has also sponsored in the past. The goal of the project is to distribute vegetarian meals. The international headquarters known as Food for Life Global, established by Paul Rodney Turner and Mukunda Goswami, coordinates the project. Food for Life is currently active in over sixty countries and serves up to 2 million free meals every day.\n\nBhaktivedanta Swami spent much of the last decade of his life setting up the institution of ISKCON.\n\nThe Governing Body Commission (or GBC) was created by him in 1970. In a document \"Direction of Management\" written on 28 July 1970 Prabhupada appointed the following members to the commission, all of them non-sannyasi:\n\n\nThe letter outlined the following purposes of the commission: improving the standard of temple management, the spread of Krishna consciousness, the distribution of books and literature, the opening of new centers and the education of the devotees. GBC has since grown in size to include 48 senior members from the movement who make decisions based on consensus of opinion. \n\nISKCON adheres to the traditional system of paramparā, or disciplic succession, in which teachings upheld by scriptures are handed down from master to disciple, generation after generation.\n\nBefore his death, Prabhupada appointed the following eleven of his disciples to serve as gurus or to continue to direct the organisation: Satsvarupa Dasa Goswami, Jayapataka Swami, Hridayananda Dasa Goswami, Tamal Krishna Goswami, Bhavananda Goswami, Hansadutta Swami, Ramesvara Swami, Harikesa Swami, Bhagavan Dasa, Kirtanananda Swami, and Jayatirtha Dasa. These eleven \"Western Gurus were selected as spiritual heads\" of the ISKCON after 1977, however \"many problems followed from their appointment and the movement had since veered away from investing absolute authority in a few, fallible, human teachers\", however of these eleven, the first three have remained prominent leaders within the movement, as was Tamal Krishna Goswami until his death in a car accident in March 2002. Bhavananda no longer holds the post of an initiating guru. Ramesvara, Bhagavan and Harikesa resigned as spiritual leaders in 1985, 1987 and 1999 respectively and the remaining three were all expelled from the movement by the Governing Body Commission during the 1980s. Of Prabhupada's disciples, who number 4,734 in total, approximately 90 are diksha gurus within ISKCON. As of April 2011, ISKCON had a total of 100 sannyasis, most of whom were acting as gurus. Also, there are 2 Grastha Prabhupada disciples who act guru in ISKCON.\n\nAccording to the essay \"Women in ISKCON in Prabhupada's times\" written by Jyotirmayi Devi Dasi, women are renowned within ISKCON and regarded as completely equal in regards to spirituality. Prabhupada in his original writings encouraged the complete equality of women in the eye of Krishna based on the teachings of Bhagavad Gita that soul does not have any gender and everybody is eligible for spiritual liberation.\n\nSrila Prabhupada rebuked several of his male followers for discriminating against women. Since mother is the most respected position in Vedic culture, women within the Hare Krishna community are all viewed as mothers, especially for celibate male members Brahmacharis. \"Mother is a term of respect for women in the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), and is often prefixed to the Sanskrit name they receive in initiation. Even unmarried women are referred to as mothers\".\n\nWomen's roles are a controversial issue within ISKCON, and its members have strongly divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of Srila Prabhupada's teachings on gender roles. While some of its leaders, such as Hridayananda Dasa Goswami, advocate that women should be allowed to join the workforce and take public leadership roles, other leaders, such as Bhakti Vikasa Swami, condemn these views as an undesirable influence of secular feminism within ISKCON.\n\nWithin ISKCON, both men and women can advance spiritually by chanting Hare Krishna, studying the Bhagavad-gita As It Is, the Srimad Bhagavatam, Caitanya Carita Marta, and other Vaisnava literature and rendering devotional service to the spiritual master and Krishna. Marriage is highly recommended and married women can also \"advance through motherhood and devotion to their husbands in the tradition of \"stri dharma,\" the wifely duty of submission to the husband and the bearing of sons\" but is not entirely accepted.\n\nISKCON has experienced a number of significant internal problems, the majority of which occurred from the late seventies onwards, and especially within the decade following Prabhupada's death. ISKCON has also been scrutinised by some anti-cult movements.\n\nSome Food for Life programs have suffered severe criticism from ISKCON leaders and devotees who believe them to be a major deviation from Srila Prabhupada's original preaching mission by their promotion of so-called \"mundane welfare activities\". According to these opponents, Srila Prabhupada was strongly opposed to food distribution done without chanting of the names of Krishna and without preaching.\n\nThe elder \"sannyasi\" Srila Bhaktivedanta Narayana Goswami was a disciple of A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami's \"sannyasa\" guru and was long a well-wisher of ISKCON. A small group of prominent ISKCON leaders were closer to his association and Srila Bhaktivedanta Narayana made no effort to conceal his relationship with them, which as time went on became increasingly intimate. His emphasis on \"gopi-bhava\", the mood of Krishna's cowherd lovers, particularly disturbed his ISKCON audiences since Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami had stressed that the path of spontaneous devotion was only for liberated souls. At the annual GBC meeting in 1993, members questioned their affiliation with Srila Bhaktivedanta Narayana Goswami. Those involved minimized the seriousness of the relationship, though for some it had been going on for as long as five years. By the next annual meeting, the GBC forced the involved members to promise to greatly restrict further association with their new teacher. Though adhering externally, their sympathies for Srila Bhaktivedanta Narayana's teachings were unabated. In 1995, GBC's position was firm and the controversy was first on the 1995 annual meeting's agenda. A week of thorough investigation brought the implicated members in line. Asked to suggest what they might do to make amends, the leaders involved with the controversy tendered their resignations, which the GBC promptly refused. They further volunteered to refrain from initiating new disciples or visiting Vrindavana until their case could be reassessed the following year and at the March 1996 meeting GBC insisted on maintaining most of the restrictions.\n\nThe capitulation of the GBC members previously following Srila Bhaktivedanta Narayana Maharaj did not prevent the departure of devotees who felt unable to repose full faith in the ISKCON Governing Body Commission authority.\n\nIn a landmark 1976 case, People vs. Murphy, the Supreme Court of New York found that \"'the Hare Krishna religion is a bona fide religion with roots that go back thousands of years.\" Although the parents of two Hare Krishna members claimed ISKCON had brainwashed their children, the court found they hadn't and that their children had freely followed the tenets of their chosen faith.\n\nA brainwashing lawsuit filed by an Orange County mother and daughter, Robin George, in 1977 led to numerous appeals reaching the Supreme Court. In a long-awaited ruling on religious liberty, the state appeals court dismissed a claim that the Hare Krishna sect brainwashed a 15-year-old girl. In addition to the brainwashing claim, the 4th District Court of Appeal dismissed claims that they intentionally caused Robin George emotional distress and libeled her.\n\nKirtanananda Swami, or Swami Bhaktipada, a leader of ISKCON expelled from the organisation in 1987 for various deviations, pleaded guilty before his 1996 retrial to one count of racketeering and after serving 8 years of a 20-year prison sentence was subsequently released in 2004. Previously in 1991 the jury found him not guilty on charges of conspiracy to commit the murders-for-hire of two devotees, but found him guilty of racketeering and mail fraud. These convictions were later overturned on appeal, only to result in the later retrial.\n\nThe case placed a spotlight on New Vrindaban, which by then had nearly 500 members, making it the largest and most famous Hare Krishna community in the United States at that time.\n\nA suit for $900 million was filed in Texas State Court by alleged victims of abuse in the temples' schools in the 1970s and 1980s. ISKCON had to later file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Known as the Turley Case, the eventual 2008 settlement was $15 million.\n\nIn 1998, ISKCON published an exposé of widespread physical, emotional and sexual abuse of children in the group's boarding schools in the United States and India. The Hare Krishna monks and young devotees caring for the children had no training in the task and often resented having to perform it, the report said. At a meeting in 1996, former Krishna pupils testified that they had been regularly beaten at school, denied medical care, and sexually molested and raped.\n\nThe Child Protection Policy and Procedure Guidelines was revised and ratified by the GBC in June 2012. This document is ecclesiastical in nature.\n\nThe Hare Krishna mantra appears in a number of famous songs, notably in former Beatle George Harrison's 1970–71 hit \"My Sweet Lord\". John Lennon also included the phrase \"Hare Krishna\" in his lyrics to \"Give Peace a Chance\" and the Beatles' 1967 track \"I Am the Walrus\", as did Ringo Starr in his 1971 hit \"It Don't Come Easy\", written with the help of Harrison. Later Paul McCartney produced a single with a picture of Krishna riding on a swan on the cover, although there was no chanting of Krishna's names inside.\n\nOf the four Beatles, only Harrison fully embraced Krishna Consciousness; he also provided financial support for ISKCON's UK branch and enjoyed a warm friendship with Swami Prabhupada, who provided the inspiration for Harrison songs such as \"Living in the Material World\". \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1274010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1274010", "title": "Islam in South Africa", "text": "Islam in South Africa\n\nIslam in South Africa is a minority religion, practised, according to 2015 estimates, by roughly 1.5% of the total population.\nIslam in South Africa has grown in three phases. The first phase brought the earliest Muslims as part of the involuntary migration of slaves, political prisoners and political exiles from Africa and Asia (mainly from the Indonesian archipelago) that lasted from about 1652 to the mid-1800s. The second phase was the arrival of indentured labourers from British India to work in the sugar-cane fields in Natal between 1860 and 1868, and again from 1874 to 1911. Of the approximately 176,000 Indians of all faiths who were transported to the Natal province, almost 7-10% of the first shipment were Muslims.\n\nThe third phase has been marked – post apartheid – by the wave of African Muslims that have arrived on the shores and borders of South Africa. Recent figures put the number at approximately at between 75,000 and 100,000. In addition to this are a considerable number of Muslims from South Asia that have arrived as economic migrants. Although, the majority of Muslims are Sunni, smaller numbers are Shia and there is also a large Ahmadi following, particularly in Cape Town.\n\nIn the 17th century the Dutch controlled East Indies and the Cape. Muslims were brought from Dutch East Indies (modern day Indonesia), etc. as slaves including those who waged Jihad in the Dutch colonies.\n\nThe first recorded arrival of free Muslims known as Mardyckers is in 1658. Mardycka or Maredhika implies freedom. The Mardyckers were people from Amboyna in the southern Moluccas and were brought to the Cape in order to defend the newly established settlement against the indigenous people, and also to provide labour in the same way that they had been employed at home, first by the Portuguese and later by the Dutch, in Amboyna. Jan Van Riebeeck had requested that the Mardyckers be sent to the Cape as a labour force. The Mardyckers were prohibited from openly practising their religion: Islam. This was in accordance with the Statute of India (drafted by Van Dieman in 1642) which stated in one of its placaats [statutes]: \"No one shall trouble the Amboinese about their religion or annoy them; so long as they do not practise in public or venture to propagate it amongst Christians and heathens. Offenders to be punished with death, but should there be amongst them those who had been drawn to God to become Christians, they were not to be prevented from joining Christian churches.\" The same Placaat was re-issued on 23 August 1657 by Governor John Maetsuycker probably in anticipation of the advent of the Mardyckers to the Cape of Good Hope. The Placaat governed the Cape as part of the Dutch Colonial Empire.\n\nDuring the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century the Dutch continued to exile Muslim leaders from Dutch East Indies to the Cape.\n\n1667 saw the arrival of first Muslim political exiles banished by the Dutch to the Cape. These political exiles or \"Orang Cayen\" were Muslim men of wealth and influence who were banished to the Cape from their homeland in the East because the Dutch feared them as a threat to their political and economic hegemony. The first political exiles were the rulers of Sumatra. They were Sheikh Abdurahman Matabe Shah and Sheikh Mahmood. Both were buried in Constantia. From the very outset the Cape authorities accommodated the exiles away from Cape Town as they feared the exiles would escape. A tomb for these political exiles has been erected on \"Islam Hill\" in Constantia in the Cape. Sheikh Abdurahman Matebe Shah used his exile to consolidate the teaching of Islam among slaves in the Cape.\n\nThe next \"Orang Cayen\" was Sheikh Yusuf of Bantam who arrived on board 'De Voetboog' on 2 April 1694 along with his family and followers. They were housed on a farm in Zandvleit, near the mouth of the Eerste River in the Cape, far from Cape Town, on 14 June 1694. The Company's attempt to isolate Shaykh Yusuf at Zandvleit did not succeed. On the contrary, Zandvleit turned out to be the rallying point for 'fugitive' slaves and other exiles from the East. It was here that the first cohesive Muslim community in South Africa was established. Since the Sheikh and his followers hailed from Macassar, the district around Zandvleit is still known today as Macassar.\n\nSa‘id Alowie (Sayyid ‘Alawi), popularly known as Tuan Sa‘id, of Mocca in Yemen, Arabia, arrived at the Cape in 1744 with Hadjie Matarim. They were banished to the Cape by the Dutch and were incarcerated on Robben Island. On his release from Robben Island Tuan Sa'id settled at the Cape where he worked as a police constable - an occupation which gave him ample opportunities for visiting slave quarters at night to teach. Tuan Sa‘id is known for his active Da'wah (missionary endeavor) amongst the slaves in the Slave Lodge. He is generally regarded as the first official imam of the Cape Muslims.\n\nIn 1767 Prince Abdullah Kadi Abu Salaam of Tidore, Indonesia, was exiled to the Cape. He wrote a copy of the Quran from memory during his incarceration, and the volume is still preserved in Cape Town. He was released from jail in 1793 and establish a madrasah or Islamic school the same year. It is the first madrasah in the country and extremely popular among the slaves and the Free Black community. It played an important role in converting many slaves to Islam. It was also at this madrasah that the literary teaching of Arabic-Afrikaans emerged. It was through his work at the madrasah that he gained the appellation \"Tuan Guru\", meaning mister teacher.\n\nIn 1793 the growth of the community encouraged Cape Town's Muslims to petition the VOC for permission to build a mosque. Tuan Guru became the first imam of the first mosque established at the Cape. Islam was a popular religion among the slaves - its tradition of teaching enabled literate slaves to gain better positions in their masters' households, and the religion taught its followers to treat their own slaves well.\n\nIn the 1800s there were two groups of Muslims that emigrated to South Africa from India. The first began with a wave of immigration by indentured labourers from South India in the 1860s. These labourers were brought to South Africa by the British. 7-10% of these labourers were Muslim. The second group of immigrants were merchants or traders (\"Passenger Indians\") that arrived from North India and settled in Natal, the Transvaal and the Cape. The first mosque in Natal, Jumuah Musjid, was built in Grey Street in Durban in 1881. By 1911, 152,641 Indians had come to Natal.\n\nAfter South Africa became a democracy in 1994, there has been a growing number of Muslim migrants from South Asia and North Africa; however, their numbers are fairly low. Most of the non-South African Muslims are urban dwellers and thus live in or near Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth, East London, Kimberley, Pretoria or Johannesburg.\n\nAccording to converts quoted by the Christian Science Monitor, their biggest reason for the dramatic rise in Islam is that the religion is a refuge from early sex, AIDS, alcoholism, and domestic violence that is rampant in many black townships, where the greatest rates of conversions are seen. It is estimated that Islam is the largest religion of conversion in South Africa. Islam grew by sixfold in thirteen years, during the time from 1991 to 2004. Even though organizations such as IPCI, the Islamic Dawah Movement of South Africa, and the Africa Muslim Agency have been eager to proselytize in the region, there have been other civic organizations such as the MYMSA and the Call of Islam who considered other approaches to weave Islam into the social fabric of South Africa as a more significant way of making the Muslims' presence conspicuous.\n\nAccording to Michael Mumisa, a researcher and writer on African Islam, there has been an increase in the number of black South Africans converting to Islam particularly among the women and the youth. He believes that for some of the youth and women who were schooled in the politics of South African resistance and confrontation with the security forces of the former Apartheid state, the acceptance of Islam has become part of a radical rejection of a society based on Christian principles which are seen as having been responsible for establishing and promoting the Apartheid doctrine through the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa. The influence of the radical ideas espoused by Malcolm X is very evident among South African Muslims of all races. Branches of the Nation of Islam are already established in South Africa. Louis Farrakhan paid a visit to South Africa and was received by President Nelson Mandela and African Muslim communities.\n\nAnother reason has been the presence of a growing Number of Sufi Orders and Groups. Amongst these is the Murabitun, a group that has a strong following in Spain.\n\nOrganizations such as the Jamiat ul-Ulama of the Transvaal (est. 1923), The Muslim Judicial Council (est. 1945) and Muslim Youth Movement of South Africa (est. 1970) enjoyed a fair amount of moral and financial support from the Muslim community for their social welfare activities. The once strong Muslim Students Association of South Africa (est. 1974), which had branches on many tertiary campuses, became less vocal and thus lost its grip on student activities; the MSA was thus replaced by Islamic societies that were either independent or affiliates of other Muslim organizations outside these institutions. There is also a Turkish school Nizamiye Muslim School which was established in 2011. There is also a community of the Chisti way of Tasawwuf.\n\nThere is emerging black Muslim movement in the township around Gauteng in particular. Gauteng Muslim Shurah Council (GMSC) this is as results of a lot of dissatisfaction with the above organizations who are predominantly Indian and colored and are viewed as colonizing the black thought into indopak version of Islam. The GMSC is now resourced in all Gauteng townships with regional shurah's with Amir's. Amir Mohammed Gadimang is the leader of this group. With prominent other regional Amir's Zaid Langa (Soweto and Abdul Qadir Mandla Nkosi (Tshwane) who are the biggest regions.\n\nBesides political parties, a number of Islamic organisations operate in South Africa, looking after various aspects of Muslim life. \n\nMajor organisations include the Muslim Judicial Council, whose activities include the provision of Halaal certification of food. The South African Hajj and Umrah Council (SAHUC) looks after the needs of South Africa's pilgrims and is responsible for the issuing of Hajj permits. There exist many other local organisations that look after the interests of their communities.\n\nThere are many Muslim relief organisations in South Africa serving both Muslim and Non-Muslim causes:\nSome of these organisations have their roots in South Africa, while others form part of a larger international organisation.\n\nOrganisations such as PAGAD have received attention for their fight against gangsterism and drugs. PAGAD consisted of mainly Muslim people, but were joined by people from various religions. PAGAD, as the name suggests, was ostensibly formed to combat the rising trends of gangsterism and drug use. It became known more prominently, however, as proponents of urban terror. They were implicated in over 300 acts of violence, the majority of which involved explosives. PAGAD's operations largely ceased after the arrest and prosecution of its leaders in 2000.\n\nWhen the first democratic elections took place in April 1994 two Muslim parties emerged, the Africa Muslim Party and the Islamic Party. The AMP contested the National Assembly as well as the provincial legislature and the IP contested only the Western Cape provincial legislature. Neither party was able to secure seats in either legislature.\n\nNo Islamic party contested the 1999 elections.\n\nThe 2004 elections were contested by the AMP and the Peace and Justice Congress, again without success.\n\nMost South African Muslims are members of the Sunni branch of Islam; there are also a large numbers of Shi'a and other smaller sects throughout South Africa. \n\nSunnis make up the majority of South African Muslims followed by Shia Muslims and smaller sects like Ahmedis.\n\nMost of the Indian community follow the Hanafi Madhab, while the Malay, Kokni Indian & East African Communities usually follow the Sha'afi madhab, which predominates in the Western Cape. There is also an increasingly large number of adherents to the Maliki madhab, composed mostly of recent West African and Maghribi Migrants.\n\nThe Dominant traditions of scholarship are the rival South Asian Deobandi/Barelvi schools within the Indian Community.\n\nThe Malay Community has a much more varied tradition with graduates of Al-Azhar in Egypt, Umm-al Qurra in Mecca & other universities in Saudi Arabia & South Asia. Most of the Indian scholars are graduates from Deobandi affiliated Madrassahs or Sunni Zia Ul Ulooms Like Jamia Razvia Zia Ul Uloom (Rawalpindi - Pakistan).\n\nThe Muslim community in South Africa lives in harmony with other faith communities. This religious cohesion is most obvious in the Indian and Coloured residential areas where Muslims live amongst, work with and attend school with fellow South Africans of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christian, atheist and agnostic beliefs. South African Muslims generally do not segregate themselves from people of other faiths. As per the culture in South Africa, it is not uncommon for South African Muslims, just like their fellow non-Muslims, to shake hands, hug or even kiss (in the case of close friends and distant or close family) as a greeting - even with non-mahrams.\nThe National Interfaith Leadership Council, which advises President Zuma, includes former Western Cape premiere, Erahim Rasool.\n\nThe Muslim community has been affected by a rise in drug abuse, particularly in Cape Town of the drug \"Tik\" (crystal meth Crime and gangsterism are also visible in the poorer Muslim communities.\n\nQur'ans are available in libraries including the National Library.\nDuring the month of Ramadan, many Muslim retail stores, radio stations (public and private), publications and organisations send messages of goodwill to the local Muslim community. Many Muslim stores are closed on Eid-ul-Fitr.\n\nFinancial services providers such as First National Bank, ABSA bank, Standard Bank and Nedbank offer Sharia compliant financial solutions and banking products. South Africa also has several branches of Albaraka Bank (of Saudi Arabia), Habib Overseas Bank Ltd and HBZ Bank Ltd, which offers only Shari'a compliant banking. Oasis Crescent Management Group is also a financial service provider to Muslims in South Africa.Halal food products, butcheries, restaurants are widely available in South Africa although gender segregation is not common within South African society.\n\nSouth Africa is one of the few Muslim minority countries in the world which is considering the implementation of Muslim Personal Law or Muslim Family Law. In 2003, a draft Muslim Marriages Bill was submitted to the Department of Justice. This would allow courts to enforce the marital regulations of sharia law, with the assistance of a Muslim judge and assessors familiar with Islamic law, in order to protect the rights of Muslim women.\n\nProponents of the bill believe it would protect the rights of Muslim women as decisions made by legal scholars are not legally binding regarding financial settlements following a divorce.\n\nQuestions have been raised about the need for a separate marriage bill for Muslims, and there is lack of consensus in the Muslim community itself on the need for, and structure of the bill. \n\nIn 2009, an unsuccessful application was brought before the Constitutional Court of South Africa by a Muslim women's organisation, to compel the government to enact the Muslim Marriages bill. During the hearing, Judge Kate O'Regan stated that, \"the question is whether it is acceptable for the state to take over the management of a particular religion\". Judge Albie Sachs commented that \"it's asking the courts to intrude, in a very profound way, on a very sensitive issue\".\n\nThere are a number of Halal certification authorities, who certify food, retail edible items and restaurants as Halal. There is some disagreement between these organisations. The certifications carry considerable weight amongst South African Muslims.\n\nThe most prominent Halaal certification authorities in South Africa are:\n\nThe majority of South African Muslim attend mixed gender public schools, while some attend private (mostly Catholic or Anglican) schools, where they are exempt from prayer sessions and Biblical curriculum. Islamic schools also exist under the control of the Association of Muslim Schools (AMS) as well as Madrasahs. The Islamic Schools under AMS offer a syllabus combining secular and Islamic studies. The secular syllabus is taken from the CAPS syllabus issued by the Department of Basic Education while the Islamic studies syllabus is taken from the Taalimi Board affiliated to the Jamiatul Ulama South Africa. Some institutions offer short courses on Islamic teaching, while Islamic Law and Islamic finance studies are also available. \n\nQu'ran Study groups are common and Arabic studies are available through private tutoring, or universities such as Wits University and University of the Western Cape.\n\nSouth Africa has a number of Darul Ulooms around the country. These institutes have students from around the world, including a large number of African students. Some of these institutions include: \n\n\nIn addition to Cabinet ministers, there are a number of Members of Parliament as well as councillors in the various provinces. The former Western Cape premier, Ebrahim Rasool, is Muslim (Rasool is currently serving as South Africa's Ambassador to the United States of America). Imam Hassan Solomon (Raham) was a Member of Parliament from 1994 until his death in 2009. During the struggle for liberation, Imam found himself being asked by many communities to preach, even in churches! He joined the United Democratic Front, seen by many as a front for the banned African National Congress (ANC). During his years in exile in Saudi Arabia, Imam Solomon furthered his Islamic education, but was always available to enlighten people on the situation in South Africa. Imam Solomon returned to South Africa in 1992, and took up a seat in the National Assembly in Parliament following the first democratic elections in 1994. He served in Parliament until his death in 2009. Naledi Pandor is the minister of Science and Technology, Pandor is the granddaughter of Z.K. Mathews an anti apartheid teacher and a prominent member of the ANC. Naledi converted to Islam after her marriage to Sharif Josef Pandor.\n\nSheikh Ahmed Badsha Peer was a highly respected Sufi. He arrived in South Africa in 1860 as an indentured labourer and was given an honourable discharge by the colonial British authorities when he was discovered to be mystic. His tomb is at the Badsha Peer Square/Brook Street Cemetery in Durban.\n\nAbu Bakr Effendi was an Osmanli \"qadi\" who was sent in 1862 by the Ottoman sultan Abdülmecid I at the request of the British Queen Victoria to the Cape of Good Hope, in order to teach and assist the Muslim community of the Cape Malays. During his stay at the Cape he produced one of the first works in Afrikaans literature with his work in Arabic Afrikaans, \"Uiteensetting van die godsdiens\" ().\n\n\n\n\nIn South Africa there are two TV channels dedicated to the broadcast of Islamic content: ITV Networks, which is aired on paid satellite platform DSTV; and Deen Channel, which is available on the satellite TV platform StarSat. Both channels broadcast a combination of local and international Islamic content.\n\nEvery weekday public TV channel SABC 1 broadcasts short religious programmes before the Siswati/Ndebele news at 17h30. Each day a different religion is represented, with \"Reflections on Faith\" being the Islamic edition, broadcast on Fridays 17H00-17H02. An \"Nur-The Light\" is a Muslim religious programme that airs on SABC 1 on Sunday mornings and interfaith programme. \"Spirit Sundae\" features Muslim event coverage, personal profiles and discusses issues pertaining to the community. \"Religions of South Africa\" also broadcasts information about Islam. Islam Channel is also available on DSTV to South African Muslims as well as other Muslim programmes on the DSTV Indian Bouqet.\n\nRegional community TV station Cape Town TV (CTV) has weekly broadcasts of pre-recorded Jumuah (Friday) prayer sessions. During the month of Ramadan, CTV also brings viewers lectures from the days of fasting, which broadcasts every night between 21H30-22H30.\n\nMuslim stations in South Africa are limited to regional, or community based coverage. These include \"Radio 786 (Cape Town)\", \"Radio Islam (Johannesburg)\", \"The Voice of the Cape (Cape Town)\", \"Channel Islam International (Johannesburg)\" and \"Radio Al Ansaar (Durban).\"\n\nNewspapers include Muslim Views, and Al Qalam Newspaper.\n\nGenerally, the local Muslim population are known to be peaceful, tolerant and moderate. However, the US state department listed two South African organizations that it claims were international terrorist organizations: People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) and Qibla.\n\nWhile Qibla and Pagad were active in violent activity in 2001, since then they have been involved in peaceful marches and protest actions, speaking out against war's in Iraq, Gaza, Darfur and other regions across the world.\n\nCritics claim widespread corruption among police and officials, including the black market sale of South African passports, had undermined counter-terrorism efforts.\n\nIt was feared prior to the 2010 FIFA World Cup that extremists may have carried out attacks during the tournament and there were reports of Somali al-Qaeda, al-Shabab and militant run camps in neighbouring Mozambique. Despite this, no direct threats or attacks materialised.\n\nThe Muslim community in the country had organized a campaign to welcome guests into their country and homes, actively dispelling any perceived terrorism threats.\n\nThe campaign, labelled 'SA Muslims 2010', showcased Islam and Muslims in South Africa through various exhibitions, reflecting some of the community's 300-year history.\n\nIn May 2010, the local \"Mail & Guardian\" published a cartoon depicting Muhammad by Jonathan Shapiro (a.k.a. Zapiro) which sparked some uproar from the Muslim community. Death threats were made to Mr. Shapiro and the editor of the newspaper. An emergency court interdict was sought by The Council of Muslim Theologians (Jamiatul Ulama) to prevent the publishing of the cartoon, however the petition was denied by the presiding judge - who is herself a Muslim. The judge earlier chose not to recuse herself saying that her religious beliefs would not influence her. Zapiro created the cartoon in response to international outrage over the \"Everybody Draw Muhammad Day\" campaign of Facebook. Zapiro depicts the prohet Muhammad on a psychologist's couch moaning that, \"other prophets have followers with a sense of humour!\". The council stated that they feared violence in response and that the drawing may put the security of the 2010 FIFA World Cup at risk from extremists. It said that though it does not advocate violence, it would not be able to ensure that there would not be any. The editor of the paper said that, \"\"My view is no cartoon is as insulting to Islam as the assumption Muslims will react with violence,\" and said that the cartoon would not have been published if it was intended to be racist or Islamophobic. Zapiro stated that his cartoon was mild and not offensive and in no way similar to the Danish cartoon depicting Muhammad in a negative light. The following week, Zapiro published a cartoon of himself on a psychologists couch off-loading about the difficult week prior, and also saying, \"The issue is depicting the prophet... it's that simple\", and, \"That's for adherents of Islam! Why should non-believers be censored? And there's the contradiction of all those ancient Iranian and Turkish Muhammad drawings... drawn by devout Muslims!\". Further, \"I'm sorry I'm being linked to that juvenile Islamophobic Facebook campaign. And I'm sorry if anyone's linked me to the Islamophobia of the U.S. 'war on terror'! ... Or the Burqa and minaret bans in Western Europe!\", and that \"making exceptions for religious censorship is hard for a cartoonist\". An editorial piece opposite the cartoon stated that the paper \"clearly underestimated the depth of anger ignited by the cartoon, and sincerely regret the sense of injury it caused many Muslims\". Zapiro also noted the irony of being so harshly condemned by Muslims who often supported his pro-Palestinian drawing which angered his fellow Jews. Local clerics stated in a meeting with Zapiro that week that while they support freedom of expression, they do not support drawings of Muhammad.\nNo violence or protests ensued after the cartoon was published and most local Muslims found it to be mild and some did not find it to be offensive and found the reaction of the council to have been exaggerated.\n\nThe Council of Muslim Theologians (Jamiatul Ulama) succeeded in 2006 in preventing the Sunday Times from publishing a controversial cartoon of Muhammad by a Danish cartoonist.\n\n\n\n"}

Local legend claims that at the foot of Kaylartha Mountain sat the ancient Kingdom of the Gold. \n\nKaylartha Mountain is situated from Taungson, Mon State, and can be driven up to by truck. The range is part of the or Eastern Arakan Yoma Mountains. It is at a distance of from Yangon and 136 kilometers north of Mawlamyine, the capital of Mon State. The summit is above . Monkeys live atop the mountain and are fed by pilgrims.\n\nAt the top of Mount Kaylartha stands a pagoda said to house a hair of the Buddha. It is believed that in the Tharthanar Era (111), the Gautama Buddha arrived at the Kaylartha Mountain, Thuwunna Bonmi. He stayed at a monastery built by King Tissa Dama Thiha Yaza. The Buddha preached sermons to the public for seven days. During that time, he became close with the Hermits Tissa and Thiha and the local hermit of Kaylartha Mountain. They requested that he leave behind some relic to be revered by the people in his place after he left to return home. Buddha agreed and gave six of his hairs to hermits from Kyaiktiyo, Zinkyaik (to Tissa), Mount Zwegabin (to Thiha), Kaylartha, Kuthaerayone and Melan. A pair of belu brothers from Kyaikhtisaung also received a hair. All the hermits and belus enshrined the hair in great stones.\n\nThe Hermit of Kaylartha, whose name was Tila of Dokkhalun, discussed how to go about enshrining the hairs and building pagodas around them with Hermits Tissa and Thiha and Indra Sakka, who had supported Thiha in constructing a pagoda on Mount Zwegabin. He enshrined the hair relic in the pagoda atop Kaylartha Mountain, and was advised by Indra Sakka. \n\nThe hermits communicated with each other by shining lights atop their respective mountains at nighttime. Tissa, who stayed atop Zinkyaik Mountain, did not see light coming from Mountain Kaylartha and wondered what might have occurred. He went to Kaylartha Mountain and found the body of the Kaylartha Hermit. The body was burnt and buried, while the head, which was not burnt nor decomposed, held one of Buddha's hairs in its braid. It was returned to Mok Soe Taung Pagoda and joined the original two hair relics there.\n\nThe Kyaikhtisaung Sayadaw restored nine Buddha hair relic pagodas during his lifetime, with Kaylartha Pagoda being one of them. He built a compound around the pagoda and paved a road up to the top. It is now a popular spot for tourists and locals and had a resident abbot and monastery at the summit of the mountain. \n\n"}

He carries a tower that can capture any spirit, demon or god within its walls. He also appears in the classic Chinese novels \"Journey to the West\" and \"Fengshen Yanyi\" (\"Investiture of the Gods\"). He is an analogue of Vaisravana.\n\nLi Jing is renowned throughout the Shang Dynasty as a high ranking commander officer of the Old Pond Pass. His wife is Lady Yin, and he has three sons, Jinzha, Muzha, and Nezha. Throughout his past, Li Jing had studied under Superiorman Danger Skipper of Mount Kunlun, and had soon become a master of exceedingly fast underground travel (even to the extent of traveling thousands of miles without a single individual noticing). Thus, Li Jing gave a new name to the art of speed after being forced down to the Red Dust.\n\nIn time, Li Jing would have a third son by the name of Nezha, as destined by the heavens. He and Nezha's relationship began as rocky because Nezha is disobedient and short-tempered. Nezha would cause untold chaos and trouble in the future, such as that with the Eastern Sea Dragon King Ao Guang. Nezha kills the Dragon King's son and gains his wrath. Due to Nezha causing trouble in the Eastern Sea Dragon's Kingdom, Li Jing was required to give his life to Ao Guang if he did not sacrifice Nezha. But Nezha sacrificed himself, handing over his flesh to his parents.\n\nFollowing the bitter luck attained with his third son, Li Jing burned the sacrificial temple that had been built for Nezha's spirit. However, this made Nezha wish to kill his father. After Nezha was reincarnated, his body remade by his master Taiyi Zhenren, his father saw him and said,\"You vermin! When you were my child, you caused untold calamities. Why do you reincarnate and disturb the peace?\" Thus, a major conflict between Li Jing and Nezha began to unfold.\n\nAfter battling Nezha, Li Jing soon realized that his mortal body did not match 1 to 100 compared to that of Nezha's. Thus, he ran as fast as he could underground in a state of incredible fear for his life. Luckily, Li Jing happened to run into his second son, Muzha. Following Muzha's defeat by Nezha's hands, Li Jing tried to commit suicide. Wenshu Guangfa Tianzun interceded, saving Li Jing's life and containing Nezha. Nezha was then forced to submit to his father after being restrained by another superiorman by the name of Randeng Daoren. To effectively restrain his son, Randeng Daoren would teach Li Jing how to use the golden tower art as to trap Nezha within a burning tower if opposed. Thus, Nezha would be forced to submit to Li Jing, or now better known as Li the Pagoda Bearer.\n\n"}

{"id": "31485960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31485960", "title": "Monasteries in Spain", "text": "Monasteries in Spain\n\nMonasteries in Spain have a rich artistic and cultural tradition, and serve as testament to Spain's religious history and political-military history, from the Visigothic Period to the Middle Ages. The monasteries played an important role in the recruitment conducted by Christian aristocracy during and after the progress of the Reconquista, with the consequent decline in the Muslim south of the peninsula.\n\nTheir presence in the peninsula dates from the early centuries of Christianity, when the original hermit life gave rise to the formation of religious communities and the construction of small monasteries by Hispanics in the sixth and seventh centuries. Many of these buildings reflect the traditional style of Mozarabic.\n\nThe second phase was developed with the arrival of the Benedictines of Cluny, during the Reconquista and several new orders developed at this time: Cistercian, military orders, Premonstratensian, Carthusians, Jeromes, Augustinians, Camaldolese and beggars.\n\nMonastic communities of various sizes sprang up from Catalonia to Galicia; some of these structures remain while others were abandoned or destroyed. Most of the monasteries in Spain are distributed in the northern half in line with the historical discourse of the zone in the Middle Ages. Monasteries are much less numerous in the south, Andalusia and the Canary Islands.\n\nThe establishment of monasteries during the Middle Ages was paramount from a social and cultural standpoint, benefiting the arts and agriculture.\n\nThe Camino de Santiago proved an important factor in locations of these monastic orders, as often an important objective was to support the pilgrims traveling along this route.\n\nThe first reference to a monastery in Spain was in a letter from St. Augustine to the abbot of the Monastery of Cabrera, written in 398. In 410, the monk Baquiario first used the term \"monastery\" in a text written in Hispania. He, as a monk, and Egeria, and the nun Etheria, perhaps more properly a consecrated virgin, were the first such members of religious houses whose names are known.\n\nThe first monasteries arose in the fourth century and were humble buildings erected in the shadow of shrines dedicated to or graves of beloved local martyrs. Many of these monastic people were troglodytes, or cave dwellers, as hermits or recluses who served as models for later monastic culture preferred to live in caves equipped to be shelters or shrines. Such is the origin of the monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla, which preserves as a shrine the cave where Aemilianus, also known as Millán, lived. The caves served as dwellings for disciples of this saint. The practice of living apart from the world was transformed by monks belonging to monasteries; although they lived in communities, the individuals within the community maintained their ascetic practice, living in a remote location, often in the desert.\n\nThe quantitative success of monasticism in the Visigothic period led to clashes with the secular clergy, and they brought this dispute to the Councils of Toledo. Much of this conflict derived from the social and economic benefits that were accorded as privileges of the monastic life. In some cases, as in the area of El Bierzo, monasteries, such as Compludo and Ruphianensi Monasterium, accepted whole families. Others which served as foundations of Fructuosus of Braga had the appearance of real villages. In other areas, such as Andalusia, monasteries were segregated by gender. Some sources also attributed more extreme features of the hermit movement, such as social protest, to the more extreme features of the hermit movement, especially in areas such as Burgos, Álava and Logroño. This is in parallel with other religious movements as heresy Priscillianist, which survived in Galicia and other areas into the sixth century.\n\nIn the following centuries, Hispanic monasteries emerged and expanded, developing their own set of similar characteristics, with a purely Hispanic artistic style. With the arrival of the monks of Cluny in the eleventh century, and the order of St. Benedict and observers of their rule, the Spanish monastery complex took on new importance and influence. This is the era of quintessential monastic life and notable edifices. Many of these clusters of buildings have survived to the modern era in various states of repair, although many are now used for purposes unrelated to monasticism. The political role of Cluny and its link with the monarchy and noble houses was decisive in the Europeanization of the Christian kingdoms of the mainland and the formation of feudal society in Spain.\n\nWith regard to the social and economic role of the Benedictine monasteries, the classic materialistic interpretations—that of a feudal lord overseeing and creating the monastery—are tempered by recent historiography. This study includes other aspects of the communities, such as inclusion in legal and sociological networks, using the methodology of cultural anthropology and microhistory.\n\nFollowing the momentum of Cluny, Cistercians arrived with new works and reforms, followed by the Carthusians. In the thirteenth century the Franciscans and Dominicans, Premonstratensian and Jesuits, arrived. Some of these groups have remained quite monastic. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, numerous monasteries and convents arose, such as the Monastery of the Valley of the Fallen.\n\nRecent monasteries founded and built in Spain were:\n\n\nMonasteries in this area were historically founded mainly by kings, bishops and nobles. There were a number of reasons individuals might found a monastery, largely self-serving ones: to reserve a burial there, which came with perpetual prayers by the monks on behalf of the founder's soul, sheltering a princess, widow, unmarried or bastard, in the case of kings. Sometimes there were political reasons for founding or protection of a particular monastery; many of the religious houses who protected were located in border areas where battles often raged, such as Castile and León or Navarre, as was the case Matallana monastery (in the Valladolid), or Bujedo-Navarre. Bishops had an interest in building a monastery on which to exercise their authority, especially in the feudal period, as this guaranteed an income. The nobility desired salvation for themselves and his family, plus a demonstration of political influence through sponsoring one of these great works. The monastic vows (poverty, chastity and obedience) were considered an appropriate vocation for younger sons, regardless of the sincerity or otherwise of his vocation, in order to reduce the likelihood of disputes over the inheritance of the firstborn, who would then hold undivided estates according to the institution of primogeniture. This close identification between the clergy and nobility, both privileged classes, survived as an enduring connection during the Middle Ages and the Modern Age to the end of the ancien regime.\n\nOther monasteries arose without intervention from the above-mentioned members of society, when a community formed around a shrine. This is the case of the monastery of San Juan de Ortega which originally was a humble chapel founded by the saint to preserve relics of St. Nicholas of Bari Over time, sufficient people arrived to care for the shrine to require the formation of an official community. Or from hermits, in some cases doubling, that were left to be guided by any rule, as the Royal Monastery of Santa María de Vallbona (Vallbona de les Monges), the monastery of Santo Domingo de Ocaña (Toledo) of the sixteenth century has the distinction of being founded by a neighbor who wanted to be close to the preachers.\n\nThere are recent foundations, of the twentieth century, whose intent is very clear from the outset, as is the spiritual community of the Dominican Fathers of Caleruega (Burgos), in 1952, destined for the convent-school-house of spirituality. The Monastery of Our Lady of the Angels of Palma de Mallorca, in 1914, can be included as a religious house of education, as it was conceived as a major seminary, Novitiate House, Ecumenical Centre College and routinely providing Evangelical Protestants Lutheran Germans.\n\nDuring the sixth and seventh centuries, the Hispanic Visigoth cultures are evidenced in a wealth of monastic communities in which ancient tradition still flourished and where the monks themselves supported monastic rule by living it. Many monasteries arose in this period.\n\nSome sources consider the Monastery of St. Victorian of Asan (in Sobrarbe, Huesca province) as the first monastery founded in Spain, but more likely, given the existence of references to previous monasteries, the first initiative for foundation of churches sprang from the Visigoth king Gesalec in 506. Other possible inspirations are attributed to Swabians in the northwest, with the activity of San Martín de Dumio, from Pannonia. Other founding saints such as San Donato, came from Africa Játiva. San Fructuoso de Braga founded the monastery of Compludo in the early seventh century and twenty other foundations from Galicia to Andalusia. During the same century, San Leandro and his brother St. Isidore composed their own monastic rules.\n\nMorphologically, Hispanic monasteries are clearly distinguished by two concepts:\n\nThe cloister was an enclosure that isolated and protected the monastery and its residents, which is very important to the religious life being cultivated. In one chapter, the San Isidoro rule states:\n\"The mill of the monastery on its premises only have one door and one wicket to leave the garden.\"\n\nIt was later advised that the city remain separate from the cloister, and respect that separation. This suggests the building of an enclosure or wall surrounding the buildings and gardens of the monastery. This first is called monastic enclosure or cloister.\n\nThe second concept is referred to the domus, i.e. the group of houses which constitute the monastery. Documents refer to two different places within the monasteries: domus domorum, or ultimate home, which refers to the church building, and maior domus, which is the served as bedrooms and community activities. According to the surviving descriptions and annotations, the maior domus should be a dependency of high architectural quality and large size, standing next to the church, at the height of the atrium.\n\nIn the domus as a whole, there were several required dwellings such as the cilla, nursing, the punishment cell, the novitiate, the gatekeeper's shelter. What would be called a chapter house centuries later among the Benedictines was referred to at this time as a conference room in these early Hispanic monasteries. Many documents mention this space and its utility but historians are not certain where it was located. It is known that minor issues monks gathered in the choir.\n\nDocumentation of these early Hispanic monasteries is abundant and descriptive. However, only a few of the cloisters have been preserved; the rest of the sites are lost and archaeological evidence is inconclusive.\n\nMany monasteries arose in the tenth century on land reclaimed in hitherto barren areas, no man's land, or abandoned places in the basin of the Duero and Bierzo in León. The monasteries might construct new buildings or small churches, or restore those crumbling and neglected earlier that new monks transformed and supplemented with monastic dependencies. In many cases, these areas were found to be inhabited by small groups, pastoralists, and farmers attached to their land.\n\nThe monks who created this kind of monastery came from both the South (especially Cordoba, at a time of persecution of Christians in that city) and the North, bringing with them the influence of their region of origin, but without forgetting the traditional Spanish-Gothic forms. The architectural heritage survived almost two centuries despite the abandonment will be restored by these people repopulating. The lands of the Duero valley will witness the revival of architecture over the neo-visigothic 10th and 11th centuries, while the first Romanesque building started in Catalan lands in the year 1000. This is demonstrated in small churches, the only remains of the monasteries of that period that have survived until today (2008).\n\nMany of these religious buildings took advantage of those surviving from the Visigothic period and mosques, especially in Aragon first and, later, Andalusia.\n\nBuildings of this age have much in common, so some generalizations can be made about elements of construction and ornamentation.\n\nPrimary materials are rubble, stone and wood. Walls are constructed of either masonry or courses of stone blocks. The latter is typical of places with nearby quarries, as slate is often used where it is common. When the building is of masonry, lintels, corners and windows will be reinforced with stone blocks.\n\nVaults, roofs, arches and columns often presented a problem. The builders' ideal was to construct ceilings in stone barrel vault, but this was not always possible, whether because of the high cost of the labor or other technical difficulties. Very few edifices managed to use barrel vaults throughout the building; stone vaulting was often used only in the apses and wooden framing was used in the rest of the building. Smaller churches tried vaulting, but were forced to economize with poor materials, such as tufa stone, brick and masonry.\n\nThe horseshoe arch design of the vaults is in the tradition of Asturian architecture with some influence from Visigothic art, and in some cases following influence of the Mozarabic Cordoba. The influence of Cordoba art on these buildings is manifested in the ribbed vaults.\n\nSantiago de Peñalba is an example of Mozarabic alfiz arches.\n\nThe arch is a common architectural design, though the Moorish horseshoe arch differs from the Spaniard in that it cannot be close to 2/3 of the ratio Sometimes the same building may include both styles, as in San Miguel de Escalada.\n\nThe columns utilize techniques used in other buildings and styles, usually Romans. Its discovery by the builders, ownership and carry is a fact and the usual great convenience. Sometimes come from places far from their final destination. Many of the capitals are also reused, those developed specifically for the building following a Corinthian tradition of drawing the characteristic necking stranded (such as wreathed Asturias).\n\nOrnamental architecture did not reach a great development. Eaves were decorated, and the openings of the windows filled with beautiful stone lattices. Many times the doors and windows were framed with alfiz. But there are very many entries as a decoration paramental, they are of all kinds; funeral, consecration, foundation, etc. Are written in good handwriting and on the basis of good material, usually marble.\n\nPainting was the final step in construction of a church; the building was not considered finished until the walls were painted inside and out. Only a few traces of paint have been preserved over the centuries since, not only is paint the least resistant decorative element over time but also nineteenth century restorations removed or covered up these murals. If the exterior was plastered, the plastering was often scraped off to reveal the underlying material. This trend continued throughout the twentieth century and continues into the twenty-first century.\n\nBuildings were often painted with a specific tone and the details on arches, moldings, capitals, imposts and other architectural components would have been picked out in a different color. It is known that the Church of Santiago de Peñalba had a red painted base, 73 cm in height, both outside and inside.\n\n\nThe church of Santa Maria de Piasca (Cantabria) is one of the most important priories in the service of the Cluniac monastic order of Sahagún.\n\nIn Catalonia, the abbot Oliba had strong ties with the Abbey of Cluny, but it was strictly a spiritual relationship, and had no legal connotations. Via this abbot, King Sancho III of Navarre established relations with the abbot St. Odilon de Cluny, which resulted in a Cluniac abbot being put in charge of the monastery of San Juan de la Peña. As a result of this action the Cluniac influence spread through monasteries that were in the domains of Sancho III. The spiritual relationship with the Abbey of Cluny continued with the descendants of Sancho III until the reign of King Alfonso VI with whom the relationship moved from being a purely spiritual sympathy to one which has economic ties and political and religious influences. The monastery of Sahagún in León was a central one, as it was the biggest propagator of the Cluniac observance. Alfonso VI became the center of Cluny and became its protector. It was called \"The Spanish Cluny\", the abbey being more powerful in the kingdoms of León and Castile, which had nearly 100 monasteries. Alfonso was owner of the land ranging from the Cantabrian Sea to the River Duero. Sahagun was a central influence in Spain of the eleventh and twelfth centuries.\n\nThe Moreruela monastery (Zamora) was the first Cistercian enclave on the Iberian Peninsula; it was founded in 1133 in the reign of Alfonso VII, followed by the Fitero in 1140, Santa María de Sobrado, 1142, (in Sobrado dos Monxes, La Coruña) and the monastery of Poblet (1150) in Catalonia, sponsored by Count Ramón Berenguer IV of Barcelona. Moruela was part of the great Cistercian group of abbeys consisting of Clairvaux (in the valley of Absinthe, France), the Great Forest (in Languedoc), Fontfreda (near Narbonne) and Poblet. The first cloister for women was that of Santa Maria de la Caridad in Tulebras (Navarra). From this monastery, nuns departed to found the communities of Perales (Palencia), of Gradefes, Cañas (La Rioja), Trasobares in Zaragoza, Vallbona, Lleida and Las Huelgas in Burgos. Cistercian monasteries, both female and male, spread throughout the peninsula.\n\nThe mendicant orders (also called preachers) emerged in the early thirteenth century, with the Dominicans and Franciscans. They emerged as a spiritual response, necessary in a time when monastic orders had relaxed the norms and behavior. These mendicant orders proposed a novel mode of action based on direct action toward the faithful and the organizational system that was based on division by provinces. The convents and monasteries of these monks were always very close to or within cities. They were also placed alongside roads, especially in the Camino de Santiago, in order to provide care and support to travelers.\n\nThe complex of buildings used for the mendicant groups is in keeping with the usual monastic style, but differences arise according to the needs and the work of these monks. Many of the foundation buildings were donations of houses more or less adapted to life in community. The churches were built specifically for the monastic community, or in some cases expanding some existing chapel or shrine), with its own characteristics. The building's acoustics were a primary criterion in construction, as the sermons and talks with the faithful were common practice. Churches were divided into two parts, one for those attending mass and another for the monks' enclosures. These churches did not continue a distinct style but adapted to the current fashion and geographical needs. Another feature was the small number of chapels in the wings, in contrast to the Cistercian churches. This is because the rules do not oblige each monk to say daily Mass, quite the contrary. Francis of Assisi said in the General Chapter \"In places where the monks dwell be held one Mass a day [...] but if somewhere has many priests, with a love of charity is happy listening to the mass of the other.\"\n\nConstruction materials are typically poor, with a few severe facade sculptures, a polygonal apse with large window openings. The monasteries adapted and assimilated local building traditions to the community's needs, so churches vary depending on geographic location. In Spain there were two models: buildings with a Latin cross and buildings with a single nave with chapels between buttresses.\n\nIn Navarre there was a proliferation of mendicant convents during the reign of Champagne, especially with Theobald II was defined as chief patron and protector. In Castilla y León were many convents but most which have survived to the twenty-first century are badly deteriorated.\n\nPaired monasteries were those made jointly by male and female communities, within the High Middle Ages achieved considerable importance. These monasteries had their origin in the monasteries turned into family homes where whole families decided to benefit from religious rules and form a monastic community whose members spent the rest of their days without leaving the house. It was a kind of exalted fashion and later came to commit errors and excesses such that they were reprimanded by the religious leaders. There was a text, Regula Communis, written for these monasteries. This rule made clear the changes in architectural design made necessary by this combining of communities: all spaces should be double so that the female community was separated from the male; they might share only the chapter, but must sit apart. As for the bedrooms, not only ordered that they were separated but well away from each other.\n\nIn time, these monasteries came to be officially removed, but still, in the twelfth century, a group of thirty-one nuns nicknamed \"tuquinegras\" lived with a large number of monks, men who were supposed to protect and who were known by the name of milites. No buildings have been preserved from these monastic communities other than the churches.\n\nThe Military Orders built their own monasteries which served also as a fortress of defense, though otherwise the houses followed the monastic premise as other monasteries did. A typical example of this type of monastery is the Calatrava la Nueva, headquarters of the Order of Calatrava founded by the Abbot of Fitero, Raymond, at the behest of King Sancho III of Castile, to protect the area restored to the Muslims. Other orders as Order of Santiago, Knights Templar and Canons of the Holy Sepulchre devoted much of their efforts to protect and care for pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago.\n\n\nalthough many monasteries emerged along the Camino de Santiago, some have disappeared altogether. Typical of the monasteries' aid to travelers are the thirty-twohospitals or hospices governed by a small community of monks belonging to different orders, but many of the monasteries of this route have also attached their own hospitals. Here is a list of the most important monasteries of this route:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe royal palace in this institution is one of the characteristics of the Spanish monastery.\n\nOccasionally, already constructed buildings were willingly converted into a palace. Such is the case of Tordesillas, Miraflores and Paular. In other instances, the monastery offered a residence to the king or the nobility when they traveled for matters relating to their own Reconquista or to follow the travels of the courts of Castile and Aragon. In some monasteries the palatial residence required building a new building inside the compound, as in the monasteries of Poblet, Carracedo and Yuste. The monastery of El Escorial was conceived from the beginning with a specific architecture and set of structures to house the monks and the king and his court.\n\nMany Spanish monasteries were built from scratch in order to house the tombs of royal families or members of the nobility. To this end, the patrons made large donations of land, money and men. During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, it was considered of vital importance that the monks keep in their prayers the memory of the dead buried near them in churches, cloisters, or cemeteries, and not only consider this important for the salvation of souls but as a perpetual reminder to future generations how important those buried were. Among the great monasteries which possessed noble or royal mausoleums are:\n\n\nAmong the monasteries, cemeteries and burial of the family of the nobility, there are:\n\n\nSome religious communities have education as their main activity. The agencies and the religious way of life is no different from other monasteries, only instead of cultivating the land, their work is channeled to instruction and education. Examples of such religious houses are the Convent of Santo Domingo as the University of Orihuela (known as the Colegio de Santo Domingo) and the convent of San Esteban de Murcia.\n\nThe major universities (University of Salamanca, Universidad de Valladolid and University of Alcalá) were closely linked to the regular clergy by religious orders who controlled their schools, mostly Dominicans and Augustinians, and the Jesuits from the sixteenth century. In university towns, there were important monastic or conventual foundations, such as the Dominican Convent of San Esteban de Salamanca.\n\nSome monasteries and convents are located within developed areas; these tend to belong to the so-called mendicant orders, but should not be taken as a general rule. Occasionally, religious houses were built adjacent to communities, neither inside the community or in the countryside, such as Benedictines and Cistercians, and occasionally small hermitages.\n\nThese urban monasteries are similar to traditional monasteries but have their own architectural characteristics. The buildings are not in most cases surrounded by a wall or fence that isolates, the only walls being those that encircle the garden or orchard. The windows look out onto the streets of the city so it is necessary to protect those inside with blinds. Secular residents of the surrounding community have direct access to the building of the church inside of which there is a closed off area for the monks or nuns. Inside the church, the pulpit becomes a central element because these congregations have as a main goal to instruct and speak directly to the faithful.\n\nThere are other elements that distinguish convents from monasteries Female convents there are other elements that characterize them, as the existence of a wheel, the only element of contact the religious residents of the community have with the outside. The church building sometimes has an elevated choir and a choir under the feet or a choir under the side of the chancel, separated by a communion rail.\n\nMost of these urban monasteries proliferated during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries throughout the Spanish territory.\n\nMany of the Hispanic monasteries were abandoned, forgotten and lost, over time. The medieval monasteries were maintained, although some were plundered and burned, to recover from these tragedies only with new reconstructions.\n\nThe nineteenth century was crucial for the conservation of these monastic buildings. The Spanish War of Independence brought many calamities; French soldiers were quartered in the buildings in some cases the churches were turned into stables or kitchens. Fires were set for heating and cooking, with the inevitable consequences. Many of the tombs were desecrated in search of possible treasures or for the mere pleasure of destroying, apart from robbery and theft of works of art in wartime. In some cases, it was believed that the destruction would bring about social transformation, as was the case with the demolition of thirty-seven convents in Madrid and the convent of San Francisco (Valladolid).\n\nAfter years of peace, and of building restoration and recovery of scattered pieces, monasteries were again involved in the events of the Carlist Wars, the identification of the Carlist and the clergy, most notably the burning of convents and monasteries in 1835, which included a massacre of monks. Finally, in this century, the various confiscations ended with the realized heritage of most medieval monasteries. Many of their churches were spared because they took on a new life by becoming parishes. In some cases, other provincial institutions and individuals came forward to museums with recovered pieces, including parts of the churches' architecture. The monastic ruins went on to become a commonplace instance of romanticism, and poets and musicians seeking inspiration in them; notable artists include Frédéric Chopin and George Sand in the Cartuja de Valldemossa and the Bécquer brothers Gustavo and Valeriano in the Cistercian Monastery Veruela (Zaragoza).\n\nIn the last quarter of the nineteenth century, with the Restoration, there was a political climate more favorable to the founding of new religious orders and the restoration of the old. Some monasteries were able to revive the monastic life.\n\nIn the first third of the twentieth century, political and social critical junctures brought back to light the old Spanish anticlericalism which culminated in Tragic Week in Barcelona in 1909. In 1910, the Law of the lock prevented the establishment of new religious congregations. In 1931, shortly after the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, came a new burning of convents, but much more serious was the destruction during the Spanish Civil War, with thousands of victims among the clergy.\n\nIn the last quarter century, both the Spanish state and companies became aware of the great ruined monastic heritage was lost, great buildings abandoned or poorly maintained but still remained standing part of its architecture and began the quest to give them a meaning and relevance, such as rehabilitation for museums, cultural centers, or schools.\n\nThe monastery and its dependencies eventually consolidated with the Benedictine Order of Cluny in Romanesque period in the early Middle Ages. The monks of Cluny spread throughout Europe and founded the monasteries whose architectural structure would henceforth be an example to follow, with minor variations in some monastic orders, taking into account possible regional differences.\n\nIn many monasteries and convents it was traditional to construct a transept and small chapels that served as a shrine, located in the vast expanse of the garden. Fountains and wells which is usually open in the center or side of the courtyard.\n\nA common image was that of the patron saint of the warrant or the title holder of the church. Sometimes the title is kept original to the foundation of the monastery and sometimes switches to receive the relics of a saint local or foreign.\n\nSculptural decoration shields were common, signifying the monastic order as appropriate, those of kings or noble founders or sponsors, bishops (where applicable) and the arms of the city. It is also common to see figures representing the founder.\n\nAn important addition is the tower or steeple with a bell serving as the municipal clock. The language of the bells was very important during the Middle Ages and Renaissance as well as representing the time, as was the town crier announcing events.\n\nThe churches of the monasteries have some features that differentiate them from those of secular clergy, especially in regard to the chorus, vestries and penitential cells. In all other respects, they follow the same rules and practice space is dedicated to the liturgy, with the center of spiritual life and religious communities.\n\nChurches are always oriented to the east, like other Christian churches (except in cases where the place names force a placement). Its plan is a Latin cross transept and apse or apses. They usually have three gates: the main foot, which gives access to outdoor and one in the side wall to access the cloister, used exclusively by the monks, and a third located in the transept, which leads to the sacristy.\n\nMonasteries placed several chapels or simple altars in small spaces due to the requirement that the monks had to say daily Mass each. However, in the convents, this need did not exist because there was only one chaplain for the entire community. This reasoning applies to the sacristy, which were more spacious in monasteries than convents.\n\nThe altar would be placed in this part of the church. Placement of the altar was usually connected with a sculpture of the patron saint of the monastery. In some religious houses, this image is tucked into a niche suitable for pilgrims to visit, such as the monastery of the Virgin of Guadalupe.\n\nThe choir was customarily located in the middle of the nave in the Spanish monasteries, separated from the chancel by the transept. It might also be located in the apse behind the main altar, surrounded by a circular wall. The choir in the middle of the church is an enclosed space that is usually surrounded by a screen. Inside, it is furnished with seating with ornamentation used to instruct artists. Both armrests and backs are profusely decorated with carvings that are iconographic animal symbols, mythology, allegories, genre scenes and so on. In the center of the choir is lectern furniture that supports the great liturgical choral music book, written in large characters that can be read from afar by the monks. The organ was placed in a lateral.\n\nThe quintessential medieval Spanish cloister is the Benedictine whose pattern spread throughout Christian Europe. Its construction consists of four galleries called \"pandas\", one of them attached to the south or north nave of the church. One gallery is dedicated always to the chapter house and another small unit. The west gallery houses usually the cilla and laymen, and the gallery border to the church has the refectory and kitchen calefactory. In some monasteries, the profundis room is replaced by the refectory where the monks chant Psalm\n\"De profundis ad te Dominum clamavi ...\"\nPsalm 130 (129)\n\nOne of Saint Benedict's foremost edicts concerned caring for the ill indigent residents around the monasteries. To this end, the monasteries established hospitals both inside the monastery grounds and elsewhere in the community. Inside the monastery, there was an infirmary which treated the friars themselves and on occasion, ill visitors. As a complement to this infirmary, monasteries often had stores of herbal or botanic medicines, supplied by the monastery's garden. In some cases, this infirmary and associated medical stores might expand beyond the needs of the monastery and the surrounding community. This is true of the monastery of Santo Domingo de Silos, which was founded in 1705 at the request of the town of Silos. It became a famous chemist and recognized in the region, which is today quite well preserved; it is a museum for those who wish to study what these infirmaries were like. One particular display is that of a collection of jars produced in Talavera de la Reina, for the center, with the coat of arms of the monastery.\n\nThere are many documents about these aromatic gardens cultivated by the monks. In the monastery of Santa Maria de Matallana in the province of Valladolid, reconstruction of the ruins revealed the space that monks had devoted to this garden, growing plants. Another major herbarium was the monastery of San Julián de Samos in the province of Lugo.\n\nThe apothecaries were served by the monks, themselves specialized. They carried out all relevant tasks for the manufacture of medicines, ointments, and spirits both medicinal and otherwise. Many of these pharmacies have conserved tools such as the stills used for distillation.\n\nIn the High and Late Medieval period, much learning and literature was in the hands of the monasteries. It was there that knowledge was preserved, books were copied and translations made. Many of these monasteries had a scriptorium in addition to a library, furnished with benches, desks and shelves and equipped with pens, parchment, inks and other tools needed for writing and painting miniatures. Judging by the illuminated manuscripts preserved in Catalonia, there is evidence that desks were abundant. The Royal Monastery of Santa María de Vallbona had not only a significant library but some furniture of the period.\n\nThe library of the monastery of Montserrat has 400 incunabula, despite the ravages of time, and the Real Monasterio de Nuestra Senora de Rueda in Aragon still retains its scriptorium space.\n\nAnother significant library of the period was that of Santa María de Huerta, Soria, built in the twelfth century and decorated in the seventeenth. In the monastery of Valvanera, the rich library survives, in which there are records which refer to the Polyglot Bible Valvanera, which Philip II removed to El Escorial where it was destroyed in a fire. In Galicia, the famous monastery of San Julián de Samos had a great library that was burned in a fire in the late twentieth century.\n\nUsually the monks were buried in the cloisters' crypt. The Cistercian monks were buried directly in the ground (without a coffin) and face down. The abbots were buried in the chapter house.\n\nOne of the most important areas in a monastery is the garden, large or small. It supplied both food and a place for monks to come do penance or for spiritual retreats. The large monasteries had similarly large gardens with all kinds of facilities, from fountains, canals and wells. In some minor orders, the gardens had simply small chapels or oratories.\n\nSometimes inns were built outside the closure area. Over time and with the growing authority of the abbot, the religious houses were wont to build their own house, where the abbot might receive important guests.\n\nLarger monasteries provided not only the means for the monks' subsistence but for a strong local economic base, with workshops, foundries, mills, potteries, wineries, and other small businesses.\n\nDespite the great vicissitudes suffered by the Spanish monasteries—fire, theft, plundering, confiscations, laziness—there still remains still a considerable heritage of artistic furnishings.\n\nThe monasteries tried to move away from the heritage of austerity required of ascetics, without exhibiting any external signs of wealth. Maintaining this position was virtually impossible because of the desire of lay founders, sponsors and donors that their gifts be visible as indications of their power, generosity and position. All these monasteries developed a rich collection of art, and this display did not escape the strictest order in this regard, the Carthusian Order.\n\nIn the Renaissance and Baroque period, the great chapel altars and those of smaller subsidiary chapels, following the new concept of post-Counter liturgical life. Thus arose the sculpted altarpieces, such as that by Damián Forment in the monastery of Poblet, which resulted in such an extravagant expenditure that the monks rebelled against the abbot. Another example of a huge altarpiece was in the monastery of San Benito el Real de Valladolid, a masterpiece of Berruguete Alonso, which is kept at present at the National Museum of Sculpture in the city.\n\nThe vestries were enriched not only with the necessary furniture but adorned with works of famous painters, often in valuable frames. Also paintings of kings and nobility often hung on the walls of the churches or cloisters as symbols of or to attract their patronage.\n\nMany monasteries have liturgical pieces, and large pieces of jewelry displayed in glass cases along with textile items, such as vestments and clothing. Some monasteries are by themselves a veritable museum of art, like the Descalzas Real in Madrid. Others have opened up within its walls (taking advantage of old farms) where to place a museum and recovered missing pieces, such is the case of Poblet whose museum occupies the area that was the Palace of King Martin the Humane in Poblet. Counted among their treasure are valuable books.\n\nSome monasteries have historical significance or are simply interesting. The short listing here does not imply that these monasteries are the best or most important, but simply interesting histories.\n\nThis monastery was important enough that it was referred to as the Spanish Cluny. It was the most powerful and influential Benedictine monastery of the Middle Ages in the Kingdom of León. It was protected and promoted by King Alfonso VI which, among other privileges granted to preserve the protected Urraca also gave the monastery the right to mint its own currency and the Jews of the town as vassals by King Alfonso VII. Its heritage spanned the provinces of León, Valladolid, Palencia, Zamora and Cantabria, thus counting a far larger number of subjects under their jurisdiction than the holdings of other important figures of the time. From the religious point of view, Sahagun was the center from which sprang at the behest of Pope Gregory VII the new Roman liturgy which replaced Spanish Mozarabic Rite. Father Sandoval and Father Yepes listed fifty to sixty monasteries and a large number of churches which depended on Sahagún. The monastery's influence stretched from Toledo and from Cantabria Rioja to Galicia.\n\nIts founding in 1389 brought a new reform of the Benedictine order under the royal protection of Juan I and the blessing of Pope Clement VII; the \"black monks\" had relaxed their strictures, forgetting Saint Benedict's strictures so far as to sleep outside the monasteries. This monastery instilled its members with a respect for the example of Saint Benedict. The cloister was the property of the monastery, not only from the spiritual perspective but the physical, with a double gate installed in the entries. The principle was established with toughness and authority of perpetual abstinence, fasting and severity in the monk's practice and in their habitations; it also enforced generosity to the needy in the form of sharing food, money and fuel. Valladolid took the lead in the fifteenth century reforms of the Benedictine orders in Spain, and other Benedictine monasteries became dependent on it Valladolid, as did the Congregation of San Benito de Valladolid, after the papal bull of Pope Alexander VI. To this end, many chapters drafted the relevant constitutions.\n\nPoblet was founded by the Count of Barcelona Ramon Berenguer IV. It was one of the four great Cistercian abbeys of Christendom, along with Clairvaux, in Absinthe, France; the Great Forest, in Languedoc; and Fontfreda, near Narbonne). In 1340, Peter ordered the crypts for royalty and nobility to be created, which became an important center for burial. The abbots of Poblet became a very powerful part of the clergy who participated in Parliament; one abbot even became president of the Generalitat. The involvement of the abbots in Catalan wars became apparent.\n\nThis is a Franciscan monastery in the town of Palos de la Frontera, in Huelva province. This was an important place in the history of Spain since its participation in the negotiations which took place between the friars and Fray Antonio de Marchena Friar Juan Perez and Colon during the four visits he made. The monks helped and supported Columbus to the Catholic Monarchs, and as such the monastery is part of what is termed \"Columbus's Places\" in Andalusia.\n\nIn this small and humble monastery were first written the annotations or glosses called Emilian Glosses written in \"romance\", a little- studied form of Castilian derived from Latin, and two or three in Euskera. It is considered the cradle of these languages.\n\nIt had a famous scriptorium which produced a series of illuminated books, many of which are preserved in the museum of the monastery. The medieval image of the Virgin of Guadalupe which was taken by the discoverers of Extremadura to the Americas. This images is particularly venerated in Mexico.\n\nMany well known historical figures passed through the monastery as pilgrims: Christopher Columbus, Hernán Cortés, King Sebastian of Portugal, Teresa de Jesus Buenfil, Lope de Vega and Pope John Paul II (in 1982.)\n\nFounded in the sixth century in the Cantabrian region of Liébana, this monastery held from the eighth century a relic of the True Cross, supposedly the largest fragment preserved. At the same time, the monk Beatus of Liébana wrote two works of great significance: the Commentary on Revelation, of which several valuable illuminated illustrated copies are held, and the refutation of heresy that had spread among Mozarabic Christians under Muslim occupation and Elipando, bishop of Toledo. The monastery regularly celebrated a Jubilee or Holy Year Liebana.\n\nThis was a two-part monastery of monks and nuns in the Visigothic tradition, founded by Abbot Froila, under the patronage of Alfonso III and located 43 km northeast of Zamora. The excavations brought to light two columnar towers and an arch that led to the lower room of the tower. In this tower was the scriptorium where the monk Emeterio finished illuminating the Beatus miniatures Tabara, initiated by his master, Magio. Emeterio himself writes the following account:\n\n\"Oh Tábara tower, high tower of stone! It's there in the top and into the first room of the library, where sat Emeterio and hunched over his homework, over 3 months, and all the members crippled by the work of the pen. 52 was finished this book 6 of the Kalends of August, the year 1008 was Hispanic, 53 to the facet hour.\"\n\nThis phrase, along with an illustration of the tower workplace, have been highly valued for depicting how such work was in the monasteries.\n\nFounded by San Pedro de Alcantara Acim Pedroso (Cáceres (province)) in 1557, this was considered the world's smallest religious house. Subsequently extended, it retained the original area under the name of the convent. In a tiny space, were built several structures a chapel for the offices large enough to fit only the officiant and an acolyte, to which is attached the founder's cell, which describes Santa Teresa de Jesús this way:\nIt seems they were forty years, he told me he had slept one hour and a half between night and day, and it was the greatest work of penance that had in the early to beat the dream and it was always or kneeling or standing. I was sitting and sleeping head leaning against a maderillo he had driven into the wall.

It is a monastery known and admired worldwide. Herrera architecture was revolutionary in Spanish art, and El Escorial retains great treasures and its library and art gallery spaces are considered to hold very rich and valuable collections.\n\nLocated in the Sierra de Guadarrama mountain range near Madrid, this led in the years after its building to a great social impact, not only by the vast proportion its construction but its later role in burials.\n\nMany monasteries have crumbled over the centuries, leaving no trace of their existence. However, some may be described by researchers who have access to related documents. In some cases, these documents only speak of history, but in other cases, contracts or purchases remain fairly accurately related to the buildings. A large number of the monasteries have only the church as a witness of the complex that might be. At other times, ruins remain which are being transformed to a fruitful use. Occasionally buildings which remained intact over the centuries have been converted into a hotel, a school or a restaurant. In none of these cases, has the modern business retained the property the garden or nearby buildings.\n\nAlso many of these medieval monasteries have regained their original function and survive as a community of monks or nuns. In the absence of patronage and custom or donations, these religious people adapt to modern life with modern media and subsist on the work undertaken by the community's members: confectionery, wine and spirits, cheese, bee hives, poultry farms, textiles and fiber arts, writing scores, dissertations, obituaries, advanced computing, pottery of all kinds, decorated white porcelain, artisanal food, farming, vestments, textiles, caring for sick and elderly, schools and daycare.\n\nIn addition, about 250 monasteries have a guest house for lay people who must follow some basic rules, with minimal cost.\n\n"}
{"id": "1548471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1548471", "title": "Negiah", "text": "Negiah\n\nNegiah (), literally \"touch\", is the concept in Jewish law (Halakha) that forbids or restricts physical contact with a member of the opposite sex (except for one's spouse, children, siblings, grandchildren, parents, and grandparents). A person who abides by this halakha is colloquially described as a \"shomer negiah\" (\"one observant of negiah\").\n\nThe laws of \"negiah\" are typically followed by Orthodox Jews, with varying levels of observance. Some Orthodox Jews follow the laws with strict modesty and take measures to avoid \"accidental\" contact, such as avoiding sitting next to a member of the opposite sex on a bus, airplane, or other similar seating situation. Others are more lenient, only avoiding purposeful contact. Adherents of Conservative and Reform Judaism do not follow these laws.\n\nThe prohibition of \"negiah\" is derived from two verses in Leviticus: \"Any man shall not approach (לקרב \"lekarev \") his close relative to uncover nakedness; I am God\" (18:6), and: \"You shall not approach a woman in her time of unclean separation, to uncover her nakedness\" (18:19). Although the verses speak in the masculine gender, women are equally bound by these commandments, just as they are obligated in virtually all negative commandments.\n\nThe former verse is viewed by the Tannaim of late antiquity (70–200 CE) as referring to an expansive prohibition against \"coming near\" (קרב \"qarab\") any of the \"arayot,\" or biblically prohibited sexual relations, which includes most close relatives. The latter verse is viewed as referring to the prohibition against \"coming near\" any woman who is in Niddah status (menstruating) [whether or not she is otherwise one of the Arayot]. The same actions are forbidden under both verses.\n\nThe prohibition against physical contact with \"arayot\" is codified by Rishonim including Maimonides (\"Hilchos Issurei Biah\" 21:1) and the Moses ben Jacob of Coucy (\"Sefer Mitzvos Gadol\" 126), who note the consideration of whether the contact is done \"derekh [chibah v']taavah\" (דרך [חבה ו]תאוה) in a[n affectionate or] lustful manner. The biblical etiology of Maimonide's prohibition is disputed by Nachmanides, who refers to the derivation from Leviticus 18:6 as an \"asmachta\" (a rabbinic prohibition with a biblical allusion) and not true exegesis.\n\nMaimonides and the \"Shulchan Aruch\" formulate this prohibition as \"hugging, kissing, or enjoying close physical contact\" (\"chibbuk venishuk veneheneh bekiruv basar\"). They do not indicate that mere touching is forbidden.\n\nThe term \"negiah\" is used by Jonah of Gerona, in his \"Sha'arei teshuvah\" (Gates of Repentance) 3:80.\nThe prohibition has been further elaborated on by many contemporary halakhic authorities. For example, \"negiah\" is the subject of a series of four important responsa by Moshe Feinstein (1959).\n\nRabbi Feinstein elaborates the two prohibitions underlying the laws of \"negiah.\" The first law is derived from a Biblical prohibition against close contact (קרב \"qarab\") with \"arayot,\" as described above. Because all women above the age of 11 are presumed to fall into the category of illicit relationships due to menstruation, it follows that the \"negiah\" prohibition extends to all women above that age, not only to the other illicit relationships prohibited by the biblical text. The second derives from the notion of \"hirhur\", a prohibition against having inappropriate sexual thoughts. Feinstein prohibits such acts as hugging, kissing, and holding hands. With regard to shaking hands, see below.\n\nLike most laws, these prohibitions are waived to save a person who is in life-threatening danger, e.g. for a man to save a woman from drowning. In such cases, the prohibitions are waived even if the male rescuer is certain that he will experience improper thoughts (Hirhur). Furthermore, medical practitioners and other professionals such as hairdressers may touch members of the opposite sex in the course of their professional practice.\n\nWhether halacha permits a man to shake a woman's hand (or vice-versa) is a matter of dispute. Opinions range from saying that it is prohibited for a man to return a woman's handshake even if doing so would embarrass him or her, to saying that returning a handshake is permissible to avoid embarrassment but not otherwise, to saying that handshaking is entirely permissible.\n\nSome authorities prohibit returning a handshake, even to avoid embarrassing the other person. For example, the Chazon Ish has been quoted as stating that shaking hands between men and women is \"absolutely forbidden\" [implying that it is forbidden under all circumstances]. This is also the opinion of Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky, Moshe Stern Yitzchak Abadi, Yosef Hayyim, and Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg in his \"Sefer Chassidim.\" \n\nRabbi Feinstein gives the benefit of the doubt to those who return a handshake, stating that they apparently hold that doing so is not \"derekh khiba v'taavah\" (דרך חבה ותאוה), but concludes that such leniency is difficult to rely upon. Although Feinstein did not address the mitigating factor of preventing the other person from being embarrassed, and fell short of stating outright that returning a handshake is forbidden, it is commonly assumed that R' Moshe prohibits returning a handshake even to avoid embarrassing the other person. One publication states this in very strong terms. Rav Yaakov Kamenetsky has also suggested that there may be room to be lenient in this situation.\n\nAhron Soloveichik has been quoted as giving a novel basis for permitting handshaking, based on the Yerushalmi (Jerusalem Talmud) and the ruling of the Rambam (Maimonides). Likewise, Yehuda Henkin holds that it is permissible to shake a woman's hand according to \"the basic halacha\" (the Rambam and Shulchan Aruch), and that those who feel otherwise are stringent. Hershel Schachter quotes Chaim Berlin as saying that shaking hands with women is strictly speaking (\"me'ikar haddin\") permitted, particularly if to do otherwise would make the Torah look bad, and indicates that he agrees with this position.\n\nAccording to Fuchs, \"Halichos Bas Yisrael\", only German Rabbis have traditionally permitted returning a handshake; and a man who is stringent about shaking hands may be lenient and shake hands with his sister (and vice versa), since we find other leniencies concerning brother and sister.\nThe Career Development Center at Yeshiva University, a Modern Orthodox institution, informs its students that \"Shaking hands is a customary part of the interview process. Halacha permits non-affectionate contact between men and women when necessary. A quick handshake can be assumed to be business protocol. Since failure to shake hands will most likely have a strong negative effect on the outcome, it is necessary non-affectionate contact, which is permissible.\"\n\nHowever, nonetheless, it has been said in the name of prominent Yeshiva University rabbis that one shouldn't engage fully in a handshake, but rather, one shouldn't hold a tight grip. His hand should be \"helpless\" and as if the other person is initiating and completing the full action, with his hand being the innocent bystander. Acting as such prevents embarrassment and or loss of a business deal, while at the same time allows one to stay in the framework of halacha (Jewish Law).\n\nThe Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson wrote that remaining firm in one's convictions when it comes to shaking hands with a woman can engender the respect of the other party. In contrast, some people view the practice of those who follow the stringent view and do not shake hands with members of the opposite sex as offensive or discourteous. Some even view it as a manifestation of sexism. The case of a woman whose offer of a handshake was politely declined by her real estate agent is discussed by \"New York Times\" \"Ethicist\" Randy Cohen. Orthodox legal scholar Michael Broyde, founding Rabbi of the Young Israel of Toco Hills and Professor of Law at Emory University, has opined that in the case discussed by Cohen, the values of gender equality and of religious freedom are in conflict. However, others argue that the \"intent [of the practice is] to elevate and sanctify the relationship between men and women, which is all too often trivialized.\" The exact same phenomenon is seen in all religions that segregate by gender such as Islam. They further state that, rather than showing a lack of respect for the opposite gender, the laws of \"negiah\" recognize the inherent sexual attraction between the sexes and the need to avoid viewing members of the opposite gender as objects of sexual desire, except in the marital context. Moreover, the practice is not discriminatory because \"strictly observant Jewish women also do not touch men, so the prohibition clearly does not confer 'untouchable' status on one sex or another. Rather it proscribes physical contact between the sexes equally.\"\nCohen, on the other hand, likens this argument to the \"separate but equal\" status rejected in school desegregation cases.\n\n"}

{"id": "81677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=81677", "title": "Pontifex maximus", "text": "Pontifex maximus\n\nThe Pontifex Maximus or pontifex maximus (Latin, \"greatest priest\") was the chief high priest of the College of Pontiffs (\"Collegium Pontificum\") in ancient Rome. This was the most important position in the ancient Roman religion, open only to patricians until 254 BC, when a plebeian first occupied this post. A distinctly religious office under the early Roman Republic, it gradually became politicized until, beginning with Augustus, it was subsumed into the Imperial office. Its last use with reference to the emperors is in inscriptions of Gratian (reigned 375–383) who, however, then decided to omit the words \"pontifex maximus\" from his title. Although in fact the most powerful office of Roman priesthood, the \"pontifex maximus\" was officially ranked fifth in the ranking of the highest Roman priests (\"ordo sacerdotum\"), behind the \"rex sacrorum\" and the \"flamines maiores\" (\"Flamen Dialis\", \"Flamen Martialis\", \"Flamen Quirinalis\").\n\nThe word \"pontifex\" and its derivative \"pontiff\" later became terms used for Christian bishops, including the Bishop of Rome, and the title of \"Pontifex Maximus\" was applied within the Catholic Church to the Pope as its chief bishop and appears on buildings, monuments and coins of popes of Renaissance and modern times. The official list of titles of the Pope given in the Annuario Pontificio includes \"Supreme Pontiff\" (in Latin, \"Summus Pontifex\") as the fourth title, the first being \"Bishop of Rome\".\n\nThe etymology of \"pontifex\" is uncertain, and has been since Roman times. The word appears to consist of the Latin word for \"bridge\" and the suffix for \"maker\". However, there is a possibility that this definition is a folk etymology for an Etruscan term, since Roman religion was heavily influenced by Etruscan religion, and very little is known about the Etruscan language, which is not Indo-European.\n\nAccording to the common interpretation, the term \"pontifex\" means \"bridge-builder\" (\"pons\" + \"facere\"); \"maximus\" means \"greatest\". This was perhaps originally meant in a literal sense: the position of bridge-builder was indeed an important one in Rome, where the major bridges were over the Tiber, the sacred river (and a deity): only prestigious authorities with sacral functions could be allowed to \"disturb\" it with mechanical additions. However, it was always understood in its symbolic sense as well: the pontifices were the ones who smoothed the \"bridge\" between gods and men.\n\nThe interpretation of the word \"pontifex\" as \"bridge-builder\" was that of Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Marcus Terentius Varro. Plutarch pointed out that the term existed before there were any bridges in Rome and derived the word from Old Latin \"pontis\" (sic) meaning a powerful or absolute master, while others derived it from \"potis facere\" in the sense of \"able to sacrifice\". The last derivation is mentioned also by Varro, who rejected it, but it was the view of Pontifex Maximus Quintus Scaevola. Others have held that the word was originally \"pompifex\" (leader of public processions). The word \"pons\" originally meant \"way\" and \"pontifex\" would thus mean \"maker of roads and bridges\".\n\nAnother opinion is that the word is a corruption of a similar-sounding but etymologically unrelated Etruscan word. Yet another hypothesis considers the word as a loan from the Sabine language, in which it would mean a member of a college of five, from Osco-Umbrian \"ponte\", five. This explanation takes into account the fact that the college was established by Sabine king Numa Pompilius and the institution is Italic: the expressions \"pontis\" and \"pomperias\" found in the Iguvine Tablets may denote a group or division of five or by five. The pontifex would thence be a member of a sacrificial college known as \"pomperia\" (Latin \"quinio\").\n\nThe Roman title \"Pontifex Maximus\" was rendered in Greek inscriptions and literature of the time as \"ἀρχιερεύς\" (literally, \"high priest\"|) or by a more literal translation and order of words as \"ἀρχιερεὺς μέγιστος\" (literally, \"greatest high priest\". The term \"ἀρχιερεύς\" is used in the Septuagint text of the Old Testament and in the New Testament to refer to the Jewish high priest.\n\nThe \"Collegium Pontificum\" (College of Pontiffs) was the most important priesthood of ancient Rome. The foundation of this sacred college and the office of Pontifex Maximus is attributed to the second king of Rome, Numa Pompilius. Much of what is known about the Regal period in Roman history is semi-legendary or mythical. The \"Collegium\" presumably acted as advisers to the \"rex\" (king) in religious matters. The \"collegium\" was headed by the \"pontifex maximus\", and all the \"pontifices\" held their office for life. But the pontifical records of early Rome were most likely destroyed when the city was sacked by the Gauls in 387 BCE, and the earliest accounts of Archaic Rome come from the literature of the Republic, most of it from the 1st century BC and later.\n\nAccording to the Augustan-era historian Livy, Numa Pompilius, a Sabine, devised Rome's system of religious rites, including the manner and timing of sacrifices, the supervision of religious funds, authority over all public and private religious institutions, instruction of the populace in the celestial and funerary rites including appeasing the dead, and expiation of prodigies. Numa is said to have founded Roman religion after dedicating an altar on the Aventine Hill to Jupiter Elicius and consulting the gods by means of augury. Numa wrote down and sealed these religious instructions, and gave them to the first Pontifex Maximus, Numa Marcius.\n\nIn the Roman Republic, the Pontifex Maximus was the highest office in the state religion of ancient Rome and directed the College of Pontiffs. According to Livy, after the overthrow of the monarchy, the Romans created the priesthood of the \"rex sacrorum\", or \"king of sacred rites,\" to carry out certain religious duties and rituals previously performed by the king. The \"rex sacrorum\" was explicitly deprived of military and political power, but the \"pontifices\" were permitted to hold both magistracies and military commands.\n\nThe official residence of the Pontifex Maximus was the \"Domus Publica\" (\"State House\") which stood between the House of the Vestal Virgins and the Via Sacra, close to the Regia, in the Roman Forum. His religious duties were carried out from the Regia. Unless the \"pontifex maximus\" was also a magistrate at the same time, he was not allowed to wear the toga praetexta, i.e. toga with the purple border. In artistic representations, he can be recognized by his holding an iron knife \"(secespita)\" or the \"patera\", and the distinctive robes or toga with part of the mantle covering the head \"(capite velato)\", in keeping with Roman practice.\n\nThe Pontifex was not simply a priest. He had both political and religious authority. It is not clear which of the two came first or had the most importance. In practice, particularly during the late Republic, the office of Pontifex Maximus was generally held by a member of a politically prominent family. It was a coveted position mainly for the great prestige it conferred on the holder; Julius Caesar became pontifex in 73 BC and pontifex maximus in 63 BCE.\n\nThe major Republican source on the pontiffs would have been the theological writings of Varro, which survive only in fragments preserved by later authors such as Aulus Gellius and Nonius Marcellus. Other sources are Cicero, Livy, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Valerius Maximus, Plutarch's \"Life of Numa Pompilius\", Festus' summaries of Verrius Flaccus, and in later writers, including several of the Church Fathers. Some of these sources present an extensive list of everyday prohibitions for the Pontifex Maximus; it seems difficult to reconcile these lists with evidence that many Pontifices Maximi were prominent members of society who lived normal, non-restricted lives.\n\nThe number of Pontifices, elected by \"co-optatio\" (i.e. the remaining members nominate their new colleague) for life, was originally five, including the \"pontifex maximus\". The \"pontifices\", moreover, could only come from the old nobility, the patricians. However, in 300–299 BCE the \"lex Ogulnia\" opened the office of Pontifex Maximus to public election and permitted the \"plebs\" (plebeians) to be co-opted as priests, so that part of the exclusivity of the title was lost. But it was only in 254 BCE that Tiberius Coruncanius became the first plebeian Pontifex Maximus.\n\nThe \"lex Ogulnia\" also increased the number of pontiffs to nine (the \"pontifex maximus\" included). In 104 BCE the \"lex Domitia\" prescribed that the election of all pontiffs would henceforward be voted by the \"comitia tributa\" (an assembly of the people divided into voting districts); by the same law only 17 tribes, chosen by lot from the 35 tribes of the city, could vote. The law's promulgator, L[ucius] Domitius Ahenobarbus, was shortly afterwards elected Pontifex Maximus after the death of the incumbent Metellus Dalmaticus: Something of a personal revenge because, the previous year, he had expected to be co-opted as a pontiff to replace his late father, but the pontifical college had appointed another candidate in his place. The office's next holder, Q[uintus] Mucius Scaevola, was also elected under the same law, though without controversy or opposition since he was a former consul and long-serving pontiff.\n\nThis law was abolished in 81 BCE by Sulla in his dictatorship, in the \"lex Cornelia de Sacerdotiis\", which restored to the great priestly colleges their full right of \"co-optatio\". Also under Sulla, the number of pontifices was increased to fifteen, the \"pontifex maximus\" included, and Sulla nominated Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius as the next holder of the office – the only truly unelected Pontifex Maximus in history, since even the other pontiffs did not get a vote in the matter.\n\nIn 63 BC, the law of Sulla was abolished by the tribune Titus Labienus, and a modified form of the \"lex Domitia\" was reinstated providing for election by \"comitia tributa\" once again: Gaius Julius Caesar followed Ahenobarbus's precedent by being elected by public vote, although Caesar at least had previously been a pontiff. Marcus Antonius later restored the right of \"co-optatio\" to the college, in time for the election of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Also under Julius Caesar, the number of pontifices were increased to sixteen, the pontifex maximus included. (Possibly because Caesar's own long absences from Rome necessitated the appointment of a deputy pontiff for those occasions when fifteen needed to be present?) The number of pontifices varied during the Empire but is believed to have been regular at fifteen.\n\nThe office came into its own with the abolition of the monarchy, when most sacral powers previously vested in the King were transferred either to the Pontifex Maximus or to the Rex Sacrorum, though traditionally a (non-political) dictator was formally mandated by the Senate for one day, to perform a specific rite.\n\nAccording to Livy in his \"History of Rome\", an ancient instruction written in archaic letters commands: \"Let him who is the Praetor Maximus fasten a nail on the Ides of September.\" This notice was fastened up on the right side of the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, next to the chapel of Minerva. This nail is said to have marked the number of the year.\n\nIt was in accordance with this direction that the consul Horatius dedicated the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus in the year following the expulsion of the kings; from the Consuls the ceremony of fastening the nails passed to the Dictators, because they possessed greater authority. As the custom had been subsequently dropped, it was felt to be of sufficient importance to require the appointment of a Dictator. L[ucius] Manlius was accordingly nominated but his appointment was due to political rather than religious reasons. He was eager to command in the war with the Hernici. He caused a very angry feeling among the men liable to serve by the inconsiderate way in which he conducted the enrollment. At last, in consequence of the unanimous resistance offered by the tribunes of the plebs, he gave way, either voluntarily or through compulsion, and laid down his Dictatorship. Since then, this rite has been performed by the Rex Sacrorum.\n\nThe main duty of the Pontifices was to maintain the \"pax deorum\" or \"peace of the gods.\"\n\nThe immense authority of the sacred college of pontiffs was centered on the Pontifex Maximus, the other pontifices forming his \"consilium\" or advising body. His functions were partly sacrificial or ritualistic, but these were the least important. His real power lay in the administration of \"ius divinum\" or divine law; the information collected by the pontifices related to the Roman religious tradition was bound in a \"corpus\" which summarized dogma and other concepts. The chief departments of \"jus divinum\" may be described as follows:\n\nThe pontifices had many relevant and prestigious functions such as being in charge of caring for the state archives, the keeping the official minutes of elected magistrates and list of magistrates, and they kept the records of their own decisions (\"commentarii\") and of the chief events of each year, the so-called \"public diaries\", the \"Annales maximi\".\n\nThe Pontifex Maximus was also subject to several taboos. Among them was the prohibition to leave Italy. Plutarch described Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio (141–132 BCE) as the first to leave Italy, after being forced by the Senate to do so, and thus break the sacred taboo. Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus (132–130 BCE) was the first to leave Italy voluntarily. Afterwards it became common and no longer against the law for the Pontifex Maximus to leave Italy. Among the most notable of those who did was Julius Caesar (63–44 BCE).\nThe Pontifices were in charge of the Roman calendar and determined when intercalary months needed to be added to synchronize the calendar to the seasons. Since the Pontifices were often politicians, and because a Roman magistrate's term of office corresponded with a calendar year, this power was prone to abuse: a Pontifex could lengthen a year in which he or one of his political allies was in office, or refuse to lengthen one in which his opponents were in power. This caused the calendar to become out of step with the seasons; for example, Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon in January 49 BCE actually took place in mid-autumn.\n\nUnder his authority as Pontifex Maximus, Gaius Julius Caesar introduced the calendar reform that created the Julian calendar, with a fault of less than a day per century, and which remained the standard till the Gregorian reform in the 16th century. His reform also made 46 BCE 445 days long - not coincidentally, it was the year of Julius's third consulship.\n\nAfter Julius Caesar's assassination in 44 BCE, his ally Marcus Aemilius Lepidus was selected as Pontifex Maximus. Though Lepidus eventually fell out of political favor and was sent into exile as Augustus consolidated power, he retained the priestly office until his death in 13 BCE, at which point Augustus was selected to succeed him and given the right to appoint other pontifices. Thus, from the time of Augustus, the election of pontifices ended and membership in the sacred college was deemed a sign of imperial favour. With this attribution, the new office of Emperor was given a religious dignity and the responsibility for the entire Roman state cult. Most authors contend that the power of naming the Pontifices was not really used as an \"instrumentum regni\", an enforcing power.\n\nFrom this point on, \"Pontifex Maximus\" was one of the many titles of the Emperor, slowly losing its specific and historical powers and becoming simply a referent for the sacral aspect of imperial duties and powers. During the Imperial period, a promagister (vice-master) performed the duties of the \"pontifex maximus\" in lieu of the emperors whenever they were absent.\n\nIn post-Severan times (after 235 CE), the small number of pagan senators interested in becoming pontiffs led to a change in the pattern of office holding. In Republican and Imperial times no more than one family member of a gens was member of the College of Pontiffs, nor did one person hold more than one priesthood in this collegium. However, these rules were obviously loosened in the later part of the 3rd century A.D. In periods of joint rule, at first only one of the emperors bore this title, as it occurred for the first time during the reign of Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, when only Marcus Aurelius was \"pontifex maximus\", but later two \"pontifices maximi\" could serve together, as Pupienus and Balbinus did in 238 A.D. — a situation unthinkable in Republican times.\n\nIn the crisis of the Third Century, usurpers did not hesitate to claim for themselves the role not only of Emperor but of Pontifex Maximus as well. Even the early Christian Emperors continued to use it; it was only relinquished by Gratian, possibly in 376 A.D. at the time of his visit to Rome, or more probably in 383 when a delegation of pagan senators implored him to restore the Altar of Victory in the Senate House. A more recent article suggests that the title may have kept by Gratian and even accepted by Theodosius and Valentian.\n\nThe practice of religious and secular authority united in the sovereign has a long history. In ancient Athens, the Archon basileus was the principal religious dignitary of the state; according to legend, and as indicated in his title of \"Basileus\" (meaning \"king\"), he was supposed to inherit the religious functions of the king of Athens in earlier times.\n\nEastern traditions, from the ancient Egyptian to the Japanese, carried the concept even further, according their sovereigns demigod status.\n\nWith the adoption of Christianity, the Roman emperors took it on themselves to issue decrees on matters regarding the Christian Church. Unlike the Pontifex Maximus, they did not themselves function as priests, but they acted practically as head of the official religion, a tradition that continued with the Byzantine Emperors. In line with the theory of Moscow as the Third Rome, the Russian Tsars exercised supreme authority over the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nWith the English Reformation, the sovereign of England became Supreme Governor of the Church of England and insisted on being recognised as such. Much the same occurred in other countries affected by the Protestant Reformation.\n\nEven in countries where there was no formal break with the Holy See, various sovereigns assumed similar authority. An example is Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, whose ecclesiastical policy is described in the Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) article on him.\n\nWhen Tertullian, a Montanist, furiously applied the term to some bishop with whom he was at odds (either Pope Callixtus I or Agrippinus of Carthage), \"c\" 220, over a relaxation of the Church's penitential discipline allowing repentant adulterers and fornicators back into the Church, it was in bitter irony:\nThe last traces of Emperors being at the same time chief pontiffs are found in inscriptions of Valentinian I, Valens, and Gratian (Orelli, Inscript. n1117, 1118). From the time of Theodosius I (\"r\" 379–395), the emperors no longer appear in the dignity of pontiff, but the title was later applied to the Christian bishop of Rome. In 382, the Emperor Gratian, at the urging of Ambrose, removed the Altar of Victory from the Forum, withdrew the state subsidies that funded many pagan activities and formally renounced the title of Pontifex Maximus.\n\nIn the 15th century, when the Renaissance stirred up new interest in ancient Rome, \"Pontifex Maximus\" became a regular title of honour for Popes.\n\nWhile the title \"Pontifex Maximus\" has for some centuries been used in inscriptions referring to the Popes, it has never been included in the official list of papal titles published in the Annuario Pontificio.\n\nThe title of \"Pontifex Maximus\" thus has a very ancient history, dating back to the times of the Roman Republic, but it does not predate the word \"pope\" itself (in Greek, \"πάππας\"), which is found already in the time of Homer as a name used by a child for addressing a father. This title likewise is not included in the official list of his titles, but is used in official documents such as the headings of encyclicals and similar documents, while the title \"Pontifex Maximus\" appears in inscriptions on buildings and on coins and medallions.\n\nThe word \"pontifex\", Latin for \"pontiff\", was used in ancient Rome to designate a member of the College of Pontiffs. In the Vulgate translation of the New Testament, it is sometimes used to designate the Jewish high priest, as in and . From perhaps as early as the 3rd century, it has been used to denote a bishop, not exclusively the bishop of Rome. The name given to the book containing the liturgical rites to be performed by any bishop, \"The Roman Pontifical\", and to the form of liturgy known as Pontifical High Mass witness to the continued use of \"pontifex\" in this wide sense.\n\nIn Emperor Theodosius's edict \"De fide catholica\" of 27 February 380, enacted in Thessalonica and published in Constantinople for the whole empire, by which he established Catholic Christianity as the official religion of the empire, he referred to the western Bishop of Rome, Damasus, as a \"pontifex\", while calling the eastern Bishop of Alexandria, Peter, an \"episcopus\":... the profession of that religion which was delivered to the Romans by the divine Apostle Peter, as it has been preserved by faithful tradition and which is now professed by the \"Pontiff\" Damasus and by Peter, \"Bishop\" of Alexandria ... We authorize the followers of this law to assume the title Catholic Christians ...\n\nIn December 2012 Pope Benedict XVI adopted \"@pontifex\" as his Twitter handle, prompting users to pose questions with the \"#askpontifex\" hashtag. This has been maintained by his successor Pope Francis, who now uses it as his Twitter handle.\n\nVarious forms of \"summus pontifex\" (highest pontiff or bishop) were for centuries used not only of the Bishop of Rome but of other bishops also. Hilary of Arles (d. 449) is styled \"summus pontifex\" by Eucherius of Lyons (P. L., L, 773), and Lanfranc is termed \"primas et pontifex summus\" by his biographer, Milo Crispin (P. L., CL, 10. The term was originally applied to the High Priest of Israel (cf. Judith 15:9 in the Vulgate), whose place the Christian bishops were regarded as holding each in his own diocese (I Clement 40), but from the 11th century it appears to be applied only to the Pope.\n\nThe official list of titles of the Pope given in the Annuario Pontificio includes \"Supreme Pontiff of the whole Church\" (in Latin, \"Summus Pontifex Ecclesiae Universalis\") as the fourth title, the first being \"Bishop of Rome\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19059158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19059158", "title": "San La Muerte", "text": "San La Muerte\n\nSan La Muerte (Saint Death) is a skeletal folk saint that is venerated in Paraguay, the Northeast of Argentina (mainly in the province of Corrientes but also in Misiones, Chaco and Formosa) and southern Brazil (specifically in the states of Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul). As the result of internal migration in Argentina since the 1960s the veneration of San La Muerte has been extended to Greater Buenos Aires and the national prison system as well.\n\nSaint Death is depicted as a male skeleton figure usually holding a scythe. Although the Catholic Church has attacked the devotion of Saint Death as a tradition that mixes paganism with Christianity and is contrary to the Christian belief of Christ defeating death, many devotees consider the veneration of San La Muerte as being part of their Catholic faith. \n\nAlthough the rituals connected to and powers ascribed to San La Muerte are very similar, San La Muerte should not be confused with the similar folk saint Santa Muerte that is venerated in Mexico and parts of the US, and is depicted as a female skeleton figure.\n\nSan La Muerte is one of many folk saints venerated in the Guaraní language region that covers parts of Paraguay, north-eastern Argentina and southern Brazil. Others include San Biquicho, San Alejo and Santa Catalina. Other names for San La Muerte include Señor De La Muerte (Lord of Death), Señor De La Buena Muerte (Lord of the Good Death) or - mainly in Paraguay - San Esqueleto (Saint Skeleton). It is believed that San La Muerte was first venerated among the Guaraní Indians following the expulsion of their Jesuit missionaries in 1767, as a mixture of their previous beliefs and the newly imported Catholic faith. Another Argentine folk saint, Gauchito Gil, was a known devotee of San La Muerte. Some of the Guarani tribes worshiped the bones of ancestors demanding protection against natural phenomena and adverse spiritual forces, which converged with the Catholic tradition of considering the bones of saints as holy relics. However, there is currently no authoritative account of the origins of the San La Muerte cult.\n\nTo believers, San La Muerte exists within the context of the Catholic faith and is comparable to other purely supernatural beings such as archangels. The San La Muerte devotion involves prayers, rituals, and offerings, which are given directly to the saint in expectation of and tailored to the fulfillment of specific requests. Offerings can include devotee’s own blood, alcoholic drinks, candles and other valuable objects. San La Muerte receives offerings in exchange for favors related to a wide range of personal problems; San La Muerte is said to help to restore love, health and fortune, to protect worshipers from witchcraft, to remove the evil eye and to grant good luck in gambling. In addition to these powers, which are commonly attributed to folk saints in general, San La Muerte is also said to be able to grant a number of requests that are connected to crime and violence. For instance, it is believed that the skeletal saint can bring death upon the enemies of his devotees, can keep people from being sent to prison and shorten prison terms of inmates and can help in the recovery of stolen and misappropriated items.\n\nThe San La Muerte devotion is characterized by a moral code that must be obeyed. In the devotion of San La Muerte devotees have numerous obligation towards the saint, which they must honor in exchange for his protection. While followers \"request\" favors from other saints they \"demand\" them from San La Muerte. Communication with San La Muerte takes place through prayers that are passed on between believers. The San La Muerte devotion is based on punishment and submission. To be favored by the saint, one sometimes even has to be threatened. Common threats involve hunger or banishment to an uninhabited place until the favor is granted. When graces are granted, the saint will be rewarded and fed but never fully, in order to increase the chances of him soon being willing to grant another grace.\n\nFor most devotees San La Muerte offers personal and non-transferable protection that will only be accessible to others when - after the death of the original owner - he or she has acquired the sculpture. There are also intermediaries such as brujos and traditional healers (curanderos) who invoke San La Muerte's power on behalf of their clients, usually concealing the image from sight of their customers. In other cases San La Muerte is kept as a concealed household saint, extending his protection upon all family members with no distinction. A number of public altars that are devoted to San La Muerte can also be found. They are run by devotees acting as guardians of and caretakers for these altars. Some of these altars host public festivities on 15 August as San La Muerte's saint's day. (Since the Catholic Church evidently has assigned no day for veneration of a saint it does not recognize, the date is somewhat contested and in some cases his day is celebrated on 13 August). The feast day of San La Muerte (August 15) also falls in the feast day of the similar folk saint Santa Muerte, though her feast day can also be celebrated on 1 November.\n\nThe San La Muerte devotion is based on interactions between worshipers and the Saint Death represented by sculptures. Individual sculptures are addressed as San La Muerte (Because of the small size, such a statuette may be colloquially referred to as \"Santito\", or'Small Saint'.) The representation of San La Muerte varies according to the individual sculptor that has crafted him, however, the classic image is a human skeleton, standing, with simple, minimalistic features. The skeleton usually carries a scythe, in some cases with drops of blood on the edge. The same image can be dressed mostly in black and red cloths. Other representations include standing skeletons without a scythe, sitting skeletons and skeletons in a coffin.\n\nSan La Muerte sculptures can be carved from wood, bones, metal (especially bullets) and usually stand between 3 and 15 centimeters tall. Increased powers are attributed to sculptures which are crafted from materials of significant origin, such as the last phalanx bone of the little finger, a bone from a dead baby, wood taken from a dead person's coffin, or a crucifix that belonged to someone recently deceased. Other more common raw materials include guaiac tree and cedar wood.\n\nAccording to believers, a San La Muerte sculpture, in order to be able to grant favors, needs to be consecrated by a Catholic priest seven times. If the sculpture is carved out of the bone of a Catholic man it only needs to be consecrated five times (as the bone has already been consecrated twice). To get sculptures of San La Muerte blessed, worshipers resort to subterfuge by concealing a picture of San La Muerte underneath a picture of a conventional saint. When a priest blesses the regular saint picture, it is felt that San La Muerte underneath has also been blessed.\n\nAside from sculptures that are usually kept on an altar or at a fixed place in the house there are a range of personal forms of the ritual that entail representations of San La Muerte being worn on (in the form of amulets and tattoos) or in the body (in the form of carvings inserted under the skin of the worshiper). San La muerte tattoos, amulets and body insertions are believed to offer special protection from death, bodily harm and imprisonment. Among devotees, fired bullets, preferably those that have wounded or killed a Christian man, are regarded as the most powerful raw material for amulets. Other materials for amulets include (human) bone, silver and gold. Tattoos of San La Muerte exhibit a wide variety of styles. From rudimentary outlines to elaborate depictions of three dimensional figures. Images of San La Muerte are usually accompanied by partial or complete transcriptions of prayers to him.\n\n\n\n"}

He painted theater scenery in his early career and then had several showings in galleries in New York City. Winning Works Progress Administration commissions in the 1930s, he completed murals for the post offices in Jackson, Mississippi and Beaufort, North Carolina. His works are in the permanent collections of the Dallas Museum of Art, the National Museum of American Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.\n\nSimka Faibusovich Simkhovitch was born on May 21, 1885 O.S./June 2, 1885 N.S. into a Jewish family in Novozybkov, Russia, who owned a small department store. During a severe case of measles when he was seven, Simkhovitch sketched the views outside his window and decided to become an artist, over his father's objections. Beginning in 1905, he studied at the Grekov Odessa Art School and upon completion of his studies in 1911 received a recommendation to be admitted to the Imperial Academy of Arts. Though he enrolled to begin classes in architecture, painting, and sculpture at the Imperial Academy, he was dropped from the school roster in December because of the quota on the number of Jewish students and drafted into the army. Simkhovitch served as a private in the until his demobilization in 1912. Re-enrolling in the Imperial Academy, he audited classes.\n\nSimkhovitch exhibited paintings and sculptures in 1918 as part of an exhibition of Jewish artists and in 1919 placed 1st in the competition \"The Great Russian Revolution\" with a painting called \"Russian Revolution\" which was hung in the State Museum of Revolution. In 1922, Simkhovitch exhibited at the International Book Fair in Florence (). In 1924, Simkhovitch came to the United States to make illustrations for Soviet textbooks and decided to immigrate instead. Initially he supported himself by doing commercial art and a few portrait commissions. In 1927, he was hired to paint a screen for a scene in the play \"The Command to Love\" by Fritz Gottwald and Rudolph Lothar which was playing at the Longacre Theatre on Broadway. Art dealers began clamoring for the screen and Simkhovitch began a career as a screen painter for the theater. Catching the attention of the screenwriter, Ernest Pascal, he worked as an illustrator for Pascal, who then introduced him to gallery owner, Marie Sterner. Simkhovitch's works appeared at the Marie Sterner Gallery beginning with a 1927 exhibit and were repeated the following year. Simkhovitch had an exhibit in 1929 at Sterner's on circus paintings. In 1931, he held a showing of works at the Helen Hackett Gallery, in New York City and later that same year he was one of the featured artists of a special exhibit in San Francisco at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor in Lincoln Park. The exhibit was coordinated by Marie Sterner and included four watercolors, including one titled \"Nudes\".\n\nIn 1936, Simkhovitch was selected to compete the mural for the WPA Post office project in Jackson, Mississippi. The mural was hung in the post office and courthouse in 1938 depicted a plantation theme. In the 1970s, it was the source of repeated controversy for its depiction of stereotypical imagery and during various courthouse remodels was covered. The following year, his painting \"Holiday\" won praise at an exhibition in Lincoln, Nebraska. In 1940, Simkhovitch's second WPA post office project was completed when four murals, \"The Cape Lookout Lighthouse and the Orville W. Mail Boat\", \"The Wreck of the Crissie Wright\", \"Sand Ponies\" and \"Canada Geese\" were installed in Beaufort, North Carolina. The works were commissioned in 1938 and did not generate the controversy that the Jackson mural had. The main mural is \"The Wreck of the Crissie Wright\" and depicts a shipwreck which had occurred in Beaufort in 1866. \"The Cape Lookout Lighthouse and the Orville W. Mail Boat\" depicted the lighthouse built in 1859 and the mail boat that was running mail during the time which Simkhovitch was there. The boat ran mail for the area until 1957. \"Sand Ponies\" shows the wild horses common to the North Carolina barrier islands and \"Canada Geese\" showed the importance of hunting and fishing in the area. All four murals were restored in the 1990s by Elisabeth Speight, daughter of two other WPA muralists, Francis Speight and his wife Sarah Jane Blakeslee.\n\nSimkhovitch's work was selected for a \"Life Magazine\" article and in 1940 the artists whose work would appear were highlighted in an exhibit at Morrill Hall on the campus of the University of Nebraska. He also had a one-man show that year in Manhattan. The 4-page \"Life\" feature appeared in the December 29, 1941 edition of the magazine and showed Simkhovich's home and studio in Greenwich, Connecticut as well as photographs of his wife, the model Elsa Forne, and two of their three daughters, Sonya and Naomi. Simkhovitch continued to paint and do illustrations. In 1946, he sold a painting \"Sonya with Fruit\" to Upjohn to use in cough medicine advertising, which was included in an exhibit of the Upjohn Collection. The following year, he did his first gallery showing in Connecticut at the Sterling House in Stratford. In February 1949, Simkhovitch and his wife bought a new home in Milford, Connecticut, but Simkhovitch contracted pneumonia during the move. He died after a brief illness on 25 February 1949 in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nSubsequent to his death, Simkhovitch's papers were donated to the Archives of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution in 1989. His works are part of the permanent collections of the Dallas Museum of Art, the\nNational Museum of American Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art, as well as other collections.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9424687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9424687", "title": "Talmudic Academies in Syria Palaestina", "text": "Talmudic Academies in Syria Palaestina\n\nThe Talmudic Academies in Syria Palaestina were \"yeshivot\" that served as centers for Jewish scholarship and the development of Jewish law in Syria Palaestina (and later Palaestina Prima and Palaestina Secunda) between the destruction of the Second Temple \"circa\" 70 CE and the deposition of Raban Gamliel VI \"circa\" 425 CE. The academies a great and lasting impact on the development of world Jewry, including the creation of the Jerusalem Talmud. Land of Israel is a religious name for the region which during the Talmudic period was officially known as Syria Palaestina (under the Romans) and Palaestina Prima / Palaestina Secunda (under the Byzantines).\n\nThe Roman destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE put as abrupt an end to the disputes of the schools as it did to the contests between political parties. It was then that a disciple of Hillel the Elder, Johanan ben Zakai, founded a new home for Jewish Law in Yavne (Jamnia). The seat of the Sanhedrin at Yavne, which at once constituted itself the successor of the Great Sanhedrin of Jerusalem by putting into practice the ordinances of that body as far as was necessary and practicable, attracted all those who had escaped the national catastrophe and who had become prominent by their character and their learning.\n\nMoreover, it reared a new generation of similarly gifted men, whose task it became to overcome the results of the Bar Kokhba revolt. During the interval between these two disasters (56-117), or, more accurately, until the Kitos War under Trajan, the school at Yavne was the recognized tribunal that gathered the traditions of the past and confirmed them; that ruled and regulated existing conditions; and that sowed the seeds for future development. Next to its founder, it owed its splendor and its undisputed supremacy especially to Gamaliel II, a great-grandson of Hillel. To him flocked the pupils of Johanan ben Zakkai and other masters and students of the Law and of Talmudical hermeneutics. Although some of them taught and labored in other places – Eliezer ben Hurcanus in Lod; Joshua ben Hananiah in Peki'in; Rabbi Ishmael in Kefar Aziz, Rabbi Akiva in Bnei Brak; Haninah ben Teradion in Siknin – Yavne remained the center; and in \"the vineyard\" of Yavne, as they called their place of meeting, they used to assemble for joint action.\n\nIn the fertile ground of the Yavne Academy the roots of the literature of tradition — Midrash and Mishnah, Talmud and Aggadah — were nourished and strengthened. There, too, the way was paved for a systematic treatment of Halakhah and exegesis. In Yavne were held the decisive debates upon the canonicity of certain Biblical books; there the Jewish liturgy received its permanent form; and there, probably, was edited the Targum on the Pentateuch, which became the foundation for the later Targum named after Onkelos. It was Yavne that inspired and sanctioned the new Greek language version of the Bible — that of Akylas (Aquila of Sinope). The events that preceded and followed the great civil revolution under Bar Kokhba (from the year 117 to about 140) resulted in the decay and death of the school at Yavne. According to tradition, the Sanhedrin was removed from Yavne to Usha, from Usha back to Yavne, and a second time from Yavne to Usha. This final settlement in Usha indicates the ultimate spiritual supremacy of Galilee over Judea, the latter having become depopulated by the war of Hadrian. Usha remained for a long time the seat of the academy; its importance being due to the pupils of Akiba, one of whom, Judah bar Ilai, had his home in Usha. Here was undertaken the great work of the restoration of Levantine Judaism after its disintegration under Hadrian. The study of the Law flourished anew; and Simeon ben Gamliel II, was invested with the rank that had been his father's in Yavne. With him the rank of nasi or patriarch became hereditary in the house of Hillel, and the seat of the academy was made identical with that of the patriarch.\n\nIn the time of Shimon ben Gamaliel II, the seat of the Patriarchate frequently shifted location; its first move being from Usha to Shefa-'Amr; thence, under Simeon's son and successor, Judah the Prince, to Beit She'arim; and finally to Sepphoris, where a celebrated disciple of Akiba, Jose ben Halafta, had been teaching. Only with great difficulty could Shimon ben Gamaliel establish his authority over this pupil of Akiba, who far outshone him in learning. Shimon's son, Judah I, however, was fortunate enough to unite with his inherited rank the indisputable reputation of a distinguished scholar, a combination of great importance under the circumstances. Judah, in whom \"Torah and dignity\" were combined, was the man appointed to close an important epoch and to lay the foundation of a new one. The academy at Sepphoris, to which eminent students from Babylonia also flocked, erected an indestructible monument to itself through Judah's activity in editing the Mishnah, which attained to canonical standing as the authentic collection of the legal traditions of religious practise. In the Mishnah, the completion of which was accomplished soon after the death of its author or editor (about 219), the schools both of the Land of Israel and of Babylonia received a recognized text-book, upon which the lectures and the debates of the students were thence-forward founded. The recognition of Rabbi Judah's Mishnah marks a strong dividing line in the history of the Academies and their teachers: it indicates the transition from the age of the Tannaim to that of the Amoraim.\n\nAfter Judah's death Sepphoris did not long remain the seat of the patriarch and the Academy. Gamaliel III, the unpretentious son of a distinguished father, became patriarch; but Hanina bar Hama succeeded him as head of the school, and introduced the new order of things that commenced with the completion of the Mishnah. In Hanina's lifetime the last migration of the Sanhedrin occurred. His pupil, Johanan bar Nappaha, settled in Tiberias, and the patriarch Judah II (grandson of Judah I) soon found himself compelled to remove to that city. The imposing personality and unexampled learning of Johanan rendered Tiberias for a long period the undisputed center of Levantine Judaism, the magnet which attracted Babylonian students.\n\nWhen Johanan died in 279—this is the only settled date in the whole chronology of the Amoraim—the renown of the Tiberias Academy was so firmly established that it suffered no deterioration under his successors, although none of them equaled him in learning. For a time, indeed, Caesarea came into prominence, owing solely to the influence of Hoshaya, who lived there in the first half of the third century, and exercised the duties of a teacher contemporaneously with the Church Father Origen, with whom he had personal intercourse. After Johanan's death the school at Cæsarea attained a new standing under his pupil Abbahu; and throughout the whole of the fourth century the opinions of the \"sages of Caesarea\" were taken into respectful account, even in Tiberias. Sepphoris also resumed its former importance as a seat of learning; and eminent men worked there in the fourth century, long after the disaster to the city wrought by the forces of the emperor Gallus. From the beginning of the third century there had been an academy at Lydda in Judea, or \"the South,\" as Judea was then called. This academy now gained a new reputation as a school of traditional learning. From it came the teacher to whom Jerome owed his knowledge of Hebrew and his insight into the \"Hebræa Veritas.\" But neither Caesarea, Sepphoris, nor Lydda could detract from the renown of Tiberias.\n\nTiberias accordingly remained the abode of the official head of Judaism in the Land of Israel and, in a certain sense, of the Judaism of the whole Roman Empire, as well as the seat of the Academy, which considered itself the successor of the ancient Sanhedrin. The right of ordination which, since Shimon ben Gamaliel II, the patriarch alone had exercised (either with or without the consent of the Council of Sages), was later on so regulated that the degree could only be conferred by the patriarch and council conjointly. The patriarchal dignity had meanwhile become worldly, as it were; for exceptional learning was by no means held to be an essential attribute of its possessor. The Academy of Tiberias, whose unordained members were called ḥaberim (associates), never lacked men, of more or less ability, who labored and taught in the manner of Johanan. Among these may be mentioned Eleazar ben Pedat, Rabbi Ammi and Rabbi Assi, Hiyya bar Abba, Rav Zeira, Samuel ben Isaac, Jonah, Jose, Jeremiah, Mani, the son of Jonah, and Jose ben Abin, who constitute a series of brilliant names in the field of the Halakah. In the department of the Aggadah — always highly prized and popular in the Land of Israel - the renown of Tiberias was also greatly augmented by many prominent and productive workers, from the contemporaries and pupils of Johanan down to Tanhuma ben Abba, who was illustrious as a collector and an editor of aggadic literature.\n\nThe imperishable monument to the school of Tiberias is the Jerusalem Talmud (Palestinian Talmud), of which Johanan ben Nappaha laid the foundation; for which reason he is generally styled, although erroneously, its redactor or author. In point of fact, however, this work was not completed until nearly a century and a half after Johanan's death; and its close is undoubtedly connected with the extinction of the patriarchal office (about 425). But Tiberias did not therefore cease to be a seat of learning, although very little of its subsequent activity is known. According to a Babylonian legend, a scion of the Babylonian exilarch's house fled to Tiberias in the first third of the sixth century, and there became a \"resh pirqa\" (ἀρχιφερεχίτης = head of the school); a hundred years later a Syrian bishop made an appeal to the sages of Tiberias for the purpose of inducing Dhu Nuwas, the Jewish king of the Himyarite Kingdom, to cease his persecution of the Christians there.\n\nFurther importance was gained by Tiberias as the seat of the Masoretic traditions and innovations; for there in the seventh century was introduced that system of punctuation which was destined to aid so efficiently in the proper reading and understanding of the Biblical text. This system, which achieved universal recognition, is called the \"Tiberian punctuation\". At Tiberias flourished, about the middle of the eighth century, the Masorite Phinehas, called also \"Rosh Yeshiva\" (\"Head of the Academy\"), and Asher the Great, forefather of five generations of Masorites (Nehemiah ben Asher, Moses ben Nehemiah, Asher ben Moses, Moses ben Asher, and Aaron ben Moses), was to a certain extent his contemporary. The last-named Aaron ben Moses ben Asher (briefly called Ben Asher), a contemporary of Saadia Gaon, brought the Tiberian school of Masorites to a distinguished end. Tiberias thereafter ceased to play any part in Jewish learning, until, in the twelfth century, it emerged for a brief period, and again in the sixteenth century, when it became the object of the pious ambition of Don Joseph Nasi of Naxos.\n\n\n"}

He is considered one of the most learned Alvar and the most superior Alvar in the context of composition of verses. He holds the title \"Narkavi Perumal\", the mark of an excellent poet, and \"Parakala\" (Beyond Time).\n\nThough he is respected as a Vaishnava saint-poet, he, initially, worked as a military commander, a chieftain and then a robber. After his conversion to Vaishnavism, he confronted practitioners of rival Hindu sect of Shaivism as well as Buddhism and Jainism.\n\nThe traditional date attributed to Thirumangai is year 399 of Kaliyuga, that is 2702 or 2706 BC, making him traditionally the last of the Alvar saints. Modern scholars have placed the Alvars in between 5th to 9th centuries based on few historical evidence. Dr. N. Subba Reddiar summarizes their views and arrives at the date 776 AD for Thirumangai, making him chronologically the eighth Alvar, though even these dates are disputed. Sakkottai Krishnaswami Aiyangar notes he is generally dated to 7th-8th century. Professor of Religion and Asian Studies, James G. Lochtefeld of Carthage College dates Tirumangai to the 9th century.\n\nThe hagiographies detailing the life of Thirumangai and other Alvars are Divya charitam (11th century) and Guruparampara-prabhavam-arayirappadi (13th century) and Guruparampara-prabhavam-muvayirappadi (14th century). Other Vaishnava scholars have written hagiographics based on the above works later.\n\nThirumangai was born in Thirukuraiyalur, a small village in Tamil Nadu, in a Muthuraja family. Thirumangai's real name was Kaliyan or Kalikanti. Thirumangai's father was Nilam, a general under the Chola empire. He was skilled in archery and worked as a military commander himself for the Chola king. In recognition of his valour, he was conferred upon the title \"Parakala\" and rewarded a small territory called Ali Nadu to govern, for his military services. Its capital was Thirumangai. He earned the title \"Thirumangai Mannan\" or chief of Thirumangai, a name he maintained even when he became a saint.\n\nAccording to the traditional account, he fell in love with Kumudavalli, a Vaishnava doctor's adopted daughter at a place Thiruvellakkulam (also known as Annan Kovil). She gave a set of conditions that he must become a Vaishnative and that he must feed a thousand for over a year, everyday. During that process, he was so much attracted to Vaishanvism, that he started constructing temple walls for Srirangam. Unable to bear the heavy expense of feeding a thousand people, Kaliyan resorted to highway robbery. One day, he saw a group of people returning from a marriage, with the bride and groom. He and his assistants were able to get all the loot, but the toe ring from the groom was left. He tried to remove them but could not do so. Then he realised the bridegroom was none other than the Supreme god Vishnu himself. Narayana revealed himself to Kaliyan and transformed him by teaching the \"Narayana mantra\" or \"Ashtaksara\" (the eight syllabled) – \"namo narayanaya\", turning the robber into a saint and starts singing the first verse of Peria Thirumozhi/ Peria Thirumoli (Vaadinen Vaadi).The temple-god of Thirunaraiyur (Naraiyur Nindra Nambi) – a form of Vishnu – is believed to have initiated Thirumangai into Vaishnavism, by teaching him the \"pancha samskara\".\n\nThe first ten verses of Thirumangai's poem \"Periya Tirumoli\" sing of his transformation, after receiving the spiritual knowledge from Vishnu. He sings about his transformation thus:\n\n<poem>\nI became a thief\ndeceitful and dishonest\nI wandered hither and thither \nyet light dawned upon me –\nI reached Your feet\nand instantly your grace fell upon me\nwith melting heart and choked voice\nyour praises I sing\nbathed in streaming tears\nI repeat day and night\nthe sacred name of Narayana (Vishnu)\n</poem>\n\nTransformed by his encounter with God, Thirumangai gave up his chieftainship and became a devout Vaishnava, dedicated to god Vishnu. To atone for his sins, he visited 88 of the Divya Desams, a group of 108 Vishnu shrines primarily in south India. He spread the poems of older Alvars in his wandering. He was also well versed in earlier Tamil literature like Naaladiyar, Thirukkural, Sangam literature and Jain literature.\n\nThirumangai preached against penance and advocated bhakti (devotion) as way to attain salvation. He composed 6 poems in Tamil, together acoounting for 1361 verses. In the book Divya Prabandham, 1361 verses of Thirumangai are included, making them the most composed by any Alvar. Tamil Vaishnavas consider them as the six Tamil \"Vedangas\" or \"Angas\" of the 4 poems of Nammalvar, which are considered as Vedas. His most important work is \"Periya Tirumoli\" (பெரிய திருமொழி), composed of 1084 hymns. The others are: \"Tirunedunthandakam\" (திருநெடுந்தாண்டகம்), [30 verses], \"Tirukuruthandakam\" (திருக்குருந்தாண்டகம்), [20 verses], \"Tiruvelukkutirukkai\" (திருவழிக்கூற்றைருக்கை), [a single long poem of 47 lines], \"Siriya Tirumadal\" (சிரியதிருமடல்), [155 lines] and \"Periya Tirumadal\" (பெரியதிருமடல்), [297 lines].\n\nA late ninth century text, Tamilalangaram by Dandapani Swamigal describes him of having the rare privilege of biting god Vishnu's toes and being pardoned for all his sins, as he wrote in Tamil. Vaishnavas consider him as a divine incarnation of Sharanga, Vishnu's bow.\n\n\"Periya Tirumoli\" is the composition of hymns illustrating the greatness of Vaishnava shrines and their presiding deity as well as God's numerous attributes. His songs extol the largest number of shrines – over 40 forms of Vishnu, from Badrinath in North India to Thirukkurungudi in the extreme South. Thirumangai also discusses causes of human suffering and ways to overcome it to achieve salvation. Vedanta Desika praises the work as \"a deep insight in spiritual knowledge\".\n\nThe word \"thandakam\" in \"Tiru-nedun-thandakam\" and \"Tiru-kuru-thandakam\" refers to the staff used for support for climbing a hill, this refers to God as the support for sustence of the soul in context of the poems. The words \"nedu\" and \"kuru\" signify the length of the compositions and its poetic meter. In \"Tirunedunthandakam\", Thirumangai speaks as a \"Nayaki\" (consort of the Lord), who separated from her beloved God (Nayaka). \"Tirukuruthandakam\" speaks dependency of the soul on God and its way to escape suffering being God, who is the sole supporter.\n\n\"Tiruvelukkutirukkai\" deals with the concept of surrender to God to attain freedom from suffering, the nature of God and the means of attaining Him.\n\n\"Periya Tirumadal\" and \"Siriya Tirumadal\" use the \"madal\", an ancient Tamil custom which is practised by a rejected lover to win back his love, though it is prohibited for women. The custom evolves singing about his love in love, devoid of food and sleep and finally trying to commit suicide before her if all things fail. Thirumangai sings as a woman threatening Lord to finish her life if He can not reciprocate her love. He assumes the role of a gopika (milkmaid) who threats Krishna (a form of Vishnu) with madal. He defends the gopika's actions of performing the prohibited madal, by saying that he follows the Sanskrit literary tradition who permits madal for women, not the Tamil one. His songs are also based on \"akam\" love poems, and talk of employing bees and storks are messengers to God. He goes to the length of portraying himself as the nayaki, pining for the love of Vishnu.\n\nHe was instrumental in the decline of Jainism in south India. He is known for building of the third wall at the Vishnu temple, Srirangam for which he melted a gold Buddha statue from the Negapatam monastery. This indicates a conflict with Buddhism.\n\nVaishnava texts like Divyasuri charitam and Guruparamparai prabhavams tell of his meeting with Thirugnana sambandhar, a Shaiva saint, who went to meet Thirumangai on his own and invited Thirumangai to his home town Sirkazhi so that Thirumangai would compose a poem in praise of the local deity Thadaalan. On the request of Thirugnana sambandhar at Sirkazhi, Thirumangai composed a poem on the spot, which was admired by the Shaiva – who granted Thirumangai a trident as a mark of appreciation.\n\nIn Hampi's Vitthala temple complex, a temple was dedicated to Thirumangai.\n\nThe Thirumangai Alvar \"Mangalasasana utsavam\"(festival)in the month of Thai(Jan–Feb) witnesses 11 Garudasevai a spectacular event in which festival images idols from the 11 Thirunaangur \"Divyadesam\" shrines in the area are brought on Garuda mounts to Thirunangur. An idol of Thirumangai Alvar is also brought here on a \"Hamsa Vahanam\"(swan) and his \"paasurams\"(verses) dedicated to each of these 11 temples are recited. The \"Utsavar\"(festival deity) of Thirumangai Alvar and his consort Sri Kumudavalli Naachiyar are taken in a palanquin to each of the 11 temples, through the paddy fields in the area. The \"paasurams\"(poems) dedicated to each of the 11 \"Divyadesams\" are chanted in the respective shrines.\n\nThe Nangur Vishnu Temples are regarded to have been sanctified by him.\nK. C. Varadachari, author of \"Alvars of South India\" describes Thirumangai as:\n\n"}

Many religions also consider particular sources or bodies of water to be sacred or at least auspicious; examples include Lourdes in Roman Catholicism, the Jordan River (at least symbolically) in some Christian churches, the Zamzam Well in Islam and the River Ganges (among many others) in Hinduism.\n\nFaiths that incorporate ritual washing (ablution) include Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, Shinto, Taoism, and the Rastafari movement. Immersion (or aspersion or affusion) of a person in water is a central sacrament of Christianity (where it is called baptism); it is also a part of the practice of other religions, including Judaism (\"mikvah\") and Sikhism (\"Amrit Sanskar\"). In addition, a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including Judaism and Islam. In Islam, the five daily prayers can be done in most cases (see \"Tayammum\") after completing washing certain parts of the body using clean water (\"wudu\"). In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area (e.g., in the ritual of \"misogi\").\n\nIn Hinduism, statues of Durga and Ganesh are immersed in rivers at the final stages of the festivals Durga Puja and Ganesh Chaturthi respectively.\n\nIn Christianity the baptism of Jesus is an important moment in Christian theology and is the third most important feast of the Church, following Easter and Pentecost. Its feast, called Epiphany or Theophany, is celebrated on January 6.\n\nWater deities are usually a focus of worship at specific springs or holy wells, but there are also more abstract ocean deities, and deities representing \"water\" as an abstract element, such as Aban in Zoroastrianism.\n\nExample for local tutelary water deities include Celtic Sulis, worshipped at the thermal spring at Bath, or Ganges in Hinduism, personified as a goddess. The Hindu goddess Saraswati originated as a personification of the Saraswati River in the Rigveda, but became a more abstract deity of wisdom in Hinduism. African examples include the Yoruba river goddess Oshun, the Igbo lake goddess Ogbuide (Uhammiri), the Igbo river goddess Idemili and Agulu Lake (Achebe).\n\n\n\n"}

Smith therefore argued that Christianity's origins lay in a pre-Christian Jesus cult—that is, a Jewish sect had worshipped a divine being Jesus in the centuries before the human Jesus was supposedly born. Evidence for this cult was found in Hippolytus' mention of the Naassenes and Epiphanius' report of a Nasarene sect that existed before Christ, as well as passages in \"Acts\". The seemingly historical details in the New Testament were built by the early Christian community around narratives of the pre-Christian Jesus.\n\nSmith also argued against the historical value of non-Christian writers regarding Jesus, particularly Josephus and Tacitus.\n\nInfamously, Smith was also a white supremacy advocate whose book \"The Colour Line: A Brief on Behalf of the Unborn\" (1905) argued for the racial inferiority of Negroes. He unsuccessfully challenged the studies of races by American anthropologist Franz Boas.\n\nUpon his death in 1934, Smith left a partial translation of Homer's \"Iliad\". This work was completed by his old Tulane colleague Walter Miller and when published in 1944 was the first English translation in the original dactylic hexameter.\n\nBooks\n\n\nPapers\n\n\n\n"}
