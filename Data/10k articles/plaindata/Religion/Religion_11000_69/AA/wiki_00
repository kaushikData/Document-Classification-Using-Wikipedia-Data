He is most widely known for his creation of the large-scale puppet performance works that lead New York's Village Halloween Parade each year.\n\nIn 1998, Kahn and his partner, Sophia Michahelles, brought together an ensemble of artists, puppeteers, theatrical technicians, and performers to design the annual performances that lead New York's Village Halloween Parade. Originally named \"Superior Concept Monsters\", the group was incorporated as a non-profit in 2005 and renamed Processional Arts Workshop with a mission to create site-specific community-built processions, parades, and other open-space performances. These works are often developed through open community workshops that bring hundreds of volunteers together to build, rehearse, and ultimately perform cyclical pieces specifically for the parade. The performances typically incorporate elements of puppetry, sound, dance, costume/mask, lighting/projection and mobile architecture, an amalgam of mediums Kahn dubbed \"processional art\".\n\nIn addition to leading New York's Village Halloween Parade each year, Kahn's creations have appeared in venues nationally and internationally. His work, Metamorphosis, involving 20' tall pupating luna moths, officially opened the 2000 Henson International Festival of Puppet Theatre. In 2002, he and Michahelles initiated a midsummer pageant project in the Italian Alps village of Morinesio, drawing on local folklore and oral history to create a unique site-specific pageant. Inspired by the success of the now-annual tradition, they have seeded similar projects in diverse locales in Ukraine, Turkey, Italy, Texas, New York, and elsewhere. In 2006, Kahn was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to Trinidad and Tobago, to study the artistic and cultural structures behind Caribbean Carnival and Trinidadian \"Mas'\", or costumed procession. More recent PAW works have included major commissions for Socrates Sculpture Park the NY Architectural League's Beaux Arts Ball, the PEN World Voices Festival, Houston's Buffalo Bayou Park, the Grand Opening of the High Line over Penn Rail Yards.\n\nKahn has maintained an independent practice as a theatrical designer, printmaker, installation artist, and teacher. His interdisciplinary approach was strongly influenced by his experience as technical director of the Kitchen Performance Center during the 1990s. During this time he created lighting, objects, and effects for performance artists including John Jesurun (\"Chang in a Void Moon\"), Mikel Rouse (\"Failing Kansas\"), Roseanne Spradlin, Meredith Monk, Pauline Oliveros, and David Hykes. Kahn trained as a master printer under Robert Blackburn (artist) and chaired the Printmaking Department at Maine College of Art from 2000 to 2004. His Spam Cantos, a retooling of spam messages generated by Baysean algorithms into a series of letterpress poems, appeared at the Maine Institute of Contemporary Art in 2008. In 2016, Kahn performed in the role of \"choir-master\" in \"The Visitors\" a video-work by Icelandic artist Ragnar Kjartansson, which has appeared at major museums around the world. His ongoing project, a fictional traveling museum called the Archive of the Synapse, has been exhibited nationally. \"San Francisco Chronicle\" art critic Kenneth Baker described the work as follows:\n\n"}

Dr. P.W. Philpott. In 1922, the group was named the Christian Workers' Church of Canada. To differentiate itself from similarly named, but theological differing groups, the denomination was renamed Associated Gospel Churches of Canada in 1925. It was federally incorporated March 18, 1925.\n\nThe AGC began its first expansion outside of Ontario in 1940, when a group of churches based in Western Canada sought to affiliate themselves with AGC. This group of churches eventually became what is now known as AGC Canada West Region\n\nIn 1944, the AGC began expanding its English language ministries into the Canadian province of Quebec, and began its first French language ministries in 1972.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, negotiations were undertaken to see if a denominational merger with the Evangelical Free Church of Canada could take place. Talks concluded in December 2006 with no agreement.\n\nIn April 2007, a vote was taken at the AGC's two regional conferences with a 98% approval for Rev. Dr. Bill Fietje to take over the presidency from Rev. Bud Penner beginning in June 2008. Rev. Penner retired from the position at the AGC's National Conference at that time, which took place at Redeemer University College in Ancaster, Ontario.\n\nFair Havens Ministries is a Bible Conference and Christian retreat centre, owned and operated by the Associated Gospel Churches (AGC). It is located near Beaverton, Ontario, about 120 km (or 75 miles) north of Toronto. Attached to the Fair Havens grounds is the Fair Glen Youth Camp, a Christian Outdoor Education Centre for youth.\n\nThe AGC currently consists of over 140 churches, congregations, and ministries across Canada.\n"}
{"id": "2328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2328", "title": "Ayahuasca", "text": "Ayahuasca\n\nAyahuasca (, ), iowaska, or yagé (), is an entheogenic brew made out of \"Banisteriopsis caapi\" vine and other ingredients. The brew is used as a traditional spiritual medicine in ceremonies among the indigenous peoples of the Amazon basin and is known by a number of different names (see below).\n\n\"B. caapi\" contains several alkaloids that act as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Another common ingredient in ayahuasca is the shrub \"Psychotria viridis\" which contains the primary psychoactive compound, dimethyltryptamine (DMT). MAOIs are required for DMT to be orally active.\n\nAyahuasca is known by many names throughout Northern South America and Brazil.\n\n\"Ayahuasca\" is the hispanicized spelling of a word in the Quechua languages, which are spoken in the Andean states of Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia. Speakers of Quechua languages or of the Aymara language may prefer the spelling \"ayawaska\". This word refers both to the liana \"Banisteriopsis caapi\", and to the brew prepared from it. In the Quechua languages, \"aya\" means \"spirit, soul\", \"corpse, dead body\", and \"waska\" means \"rope\" and \"woody vine\", \"liana\". The word \"ayahuasca\" has been variously translated as \"liana of the soul\", \"liana of the dead\", and \"spirit liana\".\n\nIn Brazil, the brew and the liana are informally called either caapi or cipó; the latter is the Portuguese word for liana (or woody climbing vine). In the União do Vegetal of Brazil, an organised spiritual tradition in which people drink ayahuasca, the brew is prepared exclusively from \"B. caapi\" and \"Psychotria viridis\". Adherents of União do Vegetal call this brew hoasca or vegetal Brazilian Yawanawa call the brew \"Uní\".\n\nThe Achuar people and Shuar people of Ecuador and Peru call it natem, while the Sharanahua peoples of Peru call it shori.\n\nIn the 16th century, Christian missionaries from Spain and Portugal first encountered indigenous South Americans using ayahuasca; their earliest reports described it as \"the work of the devil\". In the 20th century, the active chemical constituent of \"B. caapi\" was named \"telepathine\", but it was found to be identical to a chemical already isolated from \"Peganum harmala\" and was given the name harmine. Beat writer William S. Burroughs read a paper by Richard Evans Schultes on the subject and while traveling through South America in the early 1950s sought out ayahuasca in the hopes that it could relieve or cure opiate addiction (see \"The Yage Letters\"). Ayahuasca became more widely known when the McKenna brothers published their experience in the Amazon in \"True Hallucinations\". Dennis McKenna later studied pharmacology, botany, and chemistry of ayahuasca and oo-koo-he, which became the subject of his master's thesis.\n\nRichard Evans Schultes allowed for Claudio Naranjo to make a special journey by canoe up the Amazon River to study ayahuasca with the South American Indians. He brought back samples of the beverage and published the first scientific description of the effects of its active alkaloids.\n\nIn Brazil, a number of modern religious movements based on the use of ayahuasca have emerged, the most famous of them being Santo Daime and the União do Vegetal (or UDV), usually in an animistic context that may be shamanistic or, more often (as with Santo Daime and the UDV), integrated with Christianity. Both Santo Daime and União do Vegetal now have members and churches throughout the world. Similarly, the US and Europe have started to see new religious groups develop in relation to increased ayahuasca use. Some Westerners have teamed up with shamans in the Amazon rainforest regions, forming ayahuasca healing retreats that claim to be able to cure mental and physical illness and allow communication with the spirit world.\n\nIn recent years, the brew has been popularized by Wade Davis (\"One River),\" English novelist Martin Goodman in \"I Was Carlos Castaneda\", Chilean novelist Isabel Allende, writer Kira Salak, author Jeremy Narby (\"The Cosmic Serpent\"), author Jay Griffiths (\"\"), American novelist Steven Peck, and radio personality Robin Quivers.\n\nSections of \"Banisteriopsis caapi\" vine are macerated and boiled alone or with leaves from any of a number of other plants, including \"Psychotria viridis\" (\"chacruna\"), \"Diplopterys cabrerana\" (also known as \"chaliponga\" and \"chacropanga\"), and \"Mimosa tenuiflora\", among other ingredients which can vary greatly from one shaman to the next. The resulting brew may contain the powerful psychedelic drug DMT and MAO inhibiting harmala alkaloids, which are necessary to make the DMT orally active. The traditional making of ayahuasca follows a ritual process that requires the user to pick the lower Chacruna leaf at sunrise, then say a prayer. The vine must be \"cleaned meticulously with wooden spoons\" and pounded \"with wooden mallets until it's fibre.\"\n\nBrews can also be made with plants that do not contain DMT, \"Psychotria viridis\" being replaced by plants such as \"Justicia pectoralis\", \"Brugmansia\", or sacred tobacco, also known as \"mapacho\" (Nicotiana rustica), or sometimes left out with no replacement. This brew varies radically from one batch to the next, both in potency and psychoactive effect, based mainly on the skill of the shaman or brewer, as well as other admixtures sometimes added and the intent of the ceremony. Natural variations in plant alkaloid content and profiles also affect the final concentration of alkaloids in the brew, and the physical act of cooking may also serve to modify the alkaloid profile of harmala alkaloids.\n\nThe actual preparation of the brew takes several hours, often taking place over the course of more than one day. After adding the plant material, each separately at this stage, to a large pot of water it is boiled until the water is reduced by half in volume. The individual brews are then added together and brewed until reduced significantly. This combined brew is what is taken by participants in Ayahuasca ceremonies.\n\nAyahuasca is used largely as a treasured sacrament. People who work with ayahuasca in non-traditional contexts often align themselves with the philosophies and cosmologies associated with ayahuasca shamanism, as practiced among indigenous peoples like the Urarina of the Peruvian Amazon. While non-native users know of the spiritual applications of ayahuasca, a less well-known traditional usage focuses on the medicinal properties of ayahuasca. When used for its medicinal purposes, ayahuasca affects the human consciousness for less than six hours, beginning half an hour after consumption and peaking after two hours. In some cases, individuals experience significant psychological stress during the experience. Ayahuasca also has cardiovascular effects, moderately increasing heart rate and diastolic blood pressure. It is for this reason that extreme caution should be taken with those who may be at risk of heart disease.\n\nThe psychedelic effects of ayahuasca include visual and auditory stimulation, the mixing of sensory modalities, and psychological introspection that may lead to great elation, fear, or illumination. Its purgative properties are important (known as \"la purga\" or \"the purge\"). The intense vomiting and occasional diarrhea it induces can clear the body of worms and other tropical parasites, and harmala alkaloids themselves have been shown to be anthelmintic. Thus, this action is twofold; a direct action on the parasites by these harmala alkaloids (particularly harmine in ayahuasca) works to kill the parasites, and parasites are expelled through the increased intestinal motility caused by these alkaloids.\n\nDietary taboos are often associated with the use of ayahuasca. In the rainforest, these tend towards the purification of one's self – abstaining from spicy and heavily seasoned foods, excess fat, salt, caffeine, acidic foods (such as citrus) and sex before, after, or during a ceremony. A diet low in foods containing tyramine has been recommended, as the speculative interaction of tyramine and MAOIs could lead to a hypertensive crisis. However, evidence indicates that harmala alkaloids act only on MAO-A, in a reversible way similar to moclobemide (an antidepressant that does not require dietary restrictions). Dietary restrictions are not used by the highly urban Brazilian ayahuasca church União do Vegetal, suggesting the risk is much lower than perceived and probably non-existent.\n\nShamans and experienced users of ayahuasca advise against consuming ayahuasca when not in the presence of one or several well-trained shamans.\n\nIn some areas, there are purported brujos (Spanish for 'Sorcerers') who masquerade as real shamans and who entice tourists to drink ayahuasca in their presence. Shamans believe one of the purposes for this is to steal one's energy and/or power, of which they believe every person has a limited stockpile.\n\nTraditional ayahuasca brews are usually made with \"Banisteriopsis caapi\" as an MAOI, while dimethyltryptamine sources and other admixtures vary from region to region. There are several varieties of caapi, often known as different \"colors\", with varying effects, potencies, and uses.\n\nDMT admixtures:\n\nOther common admixtures:\n\nCommon admixtures with their associated ceremonial values and spirits:\n\n\nIn the late 20th century, the practice of ayahuasca drinking began spreading to Europe, North America and elsewhere. The first ayahuasca churches, affiliated with the Brazilian Santo Daime, were established in the Netherlands. A legal case was filed against two of the Church's leaders, Hans Bogers (one of the original founders of the Dutch Santo Daime community) and Geraldine Fijneman (the head of the Amsterdam Santo Daime community). Bogers and Fijneman were charged with distributing a controlled substance (DMT); however, the prosecution was unable to prove that the use of ayahuasca by members of the Santo Daime constituted a sufficient threat to public health and order such that it warranted denying their rights to religious freedom under ECHR Article 9. The 2001 verdict of the Amsterdam district court is an important precedent. Since then groups that are not affiliated to the Santo Daime have used ayahuasca, and a number of different \"styles\" have been developed, including non-religious approaches.\n\nIn modern Europe and North America, ayahuasca analogs are often prepared using non-traditional plants which contain the same alkaloids. For example, seeds of the Syrian rue plant can be used as a substitute for the ayahuasca vine, and the DMT-rich \"Mimosa hostilis\" is used in place of \"chacruna\". Australia has several indigenous plants which are popular among modern ayahuasqueros there, such as various DMT-rich species of \"Acacia\".\n\nThe name \"ayahuasca\" specifically refers to a botanical decoction that contains \"Banisteriopsis caapi\". A synthetic version, known as pharmahuasca, is a combination of an appropriate MAOI and typically DMT. In this usage, the DMT is generally considered the main psychoactive active ingredient, while the MAOI merely preserves the psychoactivity of orally ingested DMT, which would otherwise be destroyed in the gut before it could be absorbed in the body. In contrast, traditionally among Amazonian tribes, the \"B. Caapi\" vine is considered to be the \"spirit\" of ayahuasca, the gatekeeper, and guide to the otherworldly realms.\n\nBrews similar to ayahuasca may be prepared using several plants not traditionally used in South America:\n\nDMT admixtures:\n\nMAOI admixtures:\n\nHarmala alkaloids are MAO-inhibiting \"beta\"-carbolines. The three most studied harmala alkaloids in the \"B. caapi\" vine are harmine, harmaline and tetrahydroharmine. Harmine and harmaline are selective and reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), while tetrahydroharmine is a weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI).\n\nThis inhibition of MAO-A allows DMT to diffuse unmetabolized past the membranes in the stomach and small intestine, and eventually cross the blood–brain barrier (which, by itself, requires no MAO-A inhibition) to activate receptor sites in the brain. Without RIMAs or the non-selective, nonreversible monoamine oxidase inhibition by drugs like phenelzine and tranylcypromine, DMT would be oxidized (and thus rendered biologically inactive) by monoamine oxidase enzymes in the digestive tract.\n\nIndividual polymorphisms in the cytochrome P450-2D6 enzyme affect the ability of individuals to metabolize harmine. Some natural tolerance to habitual use of ayahuasca (roughly once weekly) may develop through upregulation of the serotonergic system. A phase 1 pharmacokinetic study on ayahuasca (as Hoasca) with 15 volunteers was conducted in 1993, during the Hoasca Project. A review of the Hoasca Project has been published.\n\nPeople who have consumed ayahuasca report having mystical or religious experiences and spiritual revelations regarding their purpose on earth, the true nature of the universe, and deep insight into how to be the best person they possibly can. This is viewed by many as a spiritual awakening and what is often described as a rebirth. In addition, it is often reported that individuals feel they gain access to higher spiritual dimensions and make contact with various spiritual or extra-dimensional beings who can act as guides or healers.\n\nAuthor Don Jose Campos claims that people may experience profound positive life changes subsequent to consuming ayahuasca. Vomiting can follow ayahuasca ingestion; this purging is considered by many shamans and experienced users of ayahuasca to be an essential part of the experience, as it represents the release of negative energy and emotions built up over the course of one's life. Others report purging in the form of vomiting, diarrhea, and hot/cold flushes.\n\nThe ingestion of ayahuasca can also cause significant but temporary emotional and psychological distress. Excessive use could possibly lead to serotonin syndrome (although serotonin syndrome has never been specifically caused by ayahuasca except in conjunction with certain anti-depressants like SSRI's). The temporary non-entheogenic effects of ayahuasca can, depending on dosage, include tremors, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, autonomic instability, hyperthermia, sweating, motor function impairment, sedation, relaxation, vertigo, dizziness, and muscle spasms, which are primarily caused by the harmala alkaloids in ayahuasca. Long-term negative effects are not known. A few deaths due to participation in the consumption of ayahuasca have been reported, although none have been linked specifically to ayahuasca itself, but are usually said to be due to other factors. Some of the deaths may have been due to unscreened preexisting heart conditions, interaction with drugs, such as antidepressants, recreational drugs, caffeine (due to the CYP1A2 inhibition of the harmala alkaloids), or nicotine (from drinking tobacco tea for purging/cleansing), or from improper or irresponsible use due to behavioral risks or possible drug to drug interactions.\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that a single dose of ayahuasca significantly reduced symptoms of treatment-resistant depression in a small placebo-controlled trial.\n\nInternationally, DMT is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances notes, however, that the plants containing it are not subject to international control:\n\nThe cultivation of plants from which psychotropic substances are obtained is not controlled by the Vienna Convention. . . . Neither the crown (fruit, mescal button) of the Peyote cactus nor the roots of the plant Mimosa hostilis nor Psilocybe mushrooms themselves are included in Schedule 1, but only their respective principals, mescaline, DMT, and psilocin.\nA fax from the Secretary of the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) to the Netherlands Ministry of Public Health sent in 2001 goes on to state that \"Consequently, preparations (e.g. decoctions) made of these plants, including ayahuasca, are not under international control and, therefore, not subject to any of the articles of the 1971 Convention.\"\n\nDespite the INCB's 2001 affirmation that ayahuasca is not subject to drug control by international convention, in its 2010 Annual Report the Board recommended that governments consider controlling (i.e. criminalizing) ayahuasca at the national level. This recommendation by the INCB has been criticized as an attempt by the Board to overstep its legitimate mandate and as establishing a reason for governments to violate the human rights (i.e., religious freedom) of ceremonial ayahuasca drinkers.\n\nThe legal status in the United States of DMT-containing plants is somewhat ambiguous. Ayahuasca plants and preparations are legal, as they contain no scheduled chemicals. However, brews made using DMT containing plants are illegal since DMT is a Schedule I drug. That said, some people are challenging this, using arguments similar to those used by peyotist religious sects, such as the Native American Church. A court case allowing the União do Vegetal to import and use the tea for religious purposes in the United States, \"Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal\", was heard by the U.S. Supreme Court on November 1, 2005; the decision, released February 21, 2006, allows the UDV to use the tea in its ceremonies pursuant to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. In a similar case an Ashland, Oregon-based Santo Daime church sued for their right to import and consume ayahuasca tea. In March 2009, U.S. District Court Judge Panner ruled in favor of the Santo Daime, acknowledging its protection from prosecution under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nReligious use in Brazil was legalized after two official inquiries into the tea in the mid-1980s, which concluded that ayahuasca is not a recreational drug and has valid spiritual uses.\n\nIn France, Santo Daime won a court case allowing them to use the tea in early 2005; however, they were not allowed an exception for religious purposes, but rather for the simple reason that they did not perform chemical extractions to end up with pure DMT and harmala and the plants used were not scheduled. Four months after the court victory, the common ingredients of ayahuasca as well as harmala were declared \"stupéfiants\", or narcotic schedule I substances, making the tea and its ingredients illegal to use or possess.\n\nAyahuasca has also stirred debate regarding intellectual property protection of traditional knowledge. In 1986 the US Patent and Trademarks Office allowed the granting of a patent on the ayahuasca vine \"B. caapi\". It allowed this patent based on the assumption that ayahuasca's properties had not been previously described in writing. Several public interest groups, including the \"Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin\" (COICA) and the \"Coalition for Amazonian Peoples and Their Environment (Amazon Coalition)\" objected. In 1999 they brought a legal challenge to this patent which had granted a private US citizen \"ownership\" of the knowledge of a plant that is well-known and sacred to many indigenous peoples of the Amazon, and used by them in religious and healing ceremonies.\n\nLater that year the PTO issued a decision rejecting the patent, on the basis that the petitioners' arguments that the plant was not \"distinctive or novel\" were valid. However, the decision did not acknowledge the argument that the plant's religious or cultural values prohibited a patent. In 2001, after an appeal by the patent holder, the US Patent Office reinstated the patent. The law at the time did not allow a third party such as COICA to participate in that part of the reexamination process. The patent, held by US entrepreneur Loren Miller, expired in 2003.\n\n\n\n"}

The Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica brings together manuscripts and printed works in the field of Hermeticism, more specifically the 'Christian-Hermetic' tradition. It is located in the center of Amsterdam.\n\nThe Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica was founded in 1957 by Joost Ritman, opened to the public in 1984, and is not linked to any public organisation or library. The Bibliotheca co-operates with international libraries and organizations, such as the Russian Rudomino Library for Foreign Literature in Moscow, the Herzog August Bibliothek in Wolfenbüttel, the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana in Florence, and the Biblioteca Marciana in Venice.\n\nTo date, the library holds more than 23,000 volumes on hermetica, Rosicrucianism, alchemy, mysticism, gnosis, esotericism and comparative religion, and has great scientific and artistic value. Other areas of the collection are Sufism, Kabbalah, anthroposophy, Freemasonry, Judaica and the Grail. There are around 4,500 manuscripts and books printed before 1800 CE, and around 17,000 books (primary and secondary sources) printed after 1800 CE. Among the treasures of the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica are the \"Corpus Hermeticum\" published in 1471, the first illustrated edition of Dante's \"La Divina Commedia\" from 1481, and Cicero's \"De Officiis\" printed in 1465.\n\nThe founder of the library, Joost R. Ritman (1941), is an active Amsterdam business man with a deep interest in spirituality. He began collecting rare books at a young age, after his mother had presented him with a copy of a seventeenth-century edition of The Aurora, a work by Jacob Böhme, one of the authors who are a lasting source of inspiration to him. When he conceived the plan to turn his private collection of books into a library, his vision was to bring together under one roof manuscripts and printed works in the field of the Hermetic tradition, and to show the interrelatedness between the various collecting areas and their relevance for the present day. Following a difficult year in the shadow of the financial crisis and cuts, The Ritman Library reopened its doors on December 16th 2011. \n\nThe library is currently focussing on reshaping the once privately funded library into a self-sustaining and public institution, and on preparing the move to the Huis met de Hoofden (House with the Heads) in Amsterdam. The originally private library therefore acquired the status of a Public Benefit Institution (ANBI). With the rehousing to the Keizersgracht 123, a new era begins in which the library will be passed on to a new generation and made accessible to a broader audience.\n\nIn June 2016 it was announced that author Dan Brown, who did research in the library for some of his books, will donate Euro 300,000. This money will be used to digitize the library's core collection of 4,600 early printed books and 300 older manuscripts. These will be available online in spring 2017. The Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds is donating Euro 15,000.\n\n\n"}

The center was established in Efrat in 2008 by Rabbi Dr. Shlomo Riskin, who has been described as \"the most prominent rabbinic spokesperson to Christian Zionists\". CJCUC partners with major Christian interfaith organizations such as Christians United for Israel and the International Christian Embassy Jerusalem.\n\nThe ideological groundwork, which led to the eventual establishment of CJCUC in 2008, began to take shape almost 50 years beforehand. In 1964, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, the teacher and mentor of CJCUC's Chancellor and Founder, Shlomo Riskin, published an essay entitled \"Confrontation\" in which he expounded his views on interfaith dialogue and carefully drew out guidelines which permitted such a dialogue and, in the view of Riskin, not only permitted it but rendered it necessary.\n\nAt around the same time, fundamental ideological shifts were forming within the ranks of the Catholic Church, and a year after Soloveitchik's essay was published, The Holy See issued \"Nostra aetate\", the Declaration on the Relation of the Church with Non-Christian Religions. \"Nostra aetate\" absolved the Jews from the crucifixion of Jesus, and admitted that religious antisemitism had a significant role in laying the foundation for the atrocities perpetrated against the Jewish people.\n\nRiskin's academic plunge into Jewish–Christian relations began in the early 1960s when he attended seminars, held by Professor David Flusser, about the Christian Gospels at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. As an Orthodox Jew, he could pinpoint the parallels for Jesus' teachings within the Hebrew scripture.\n\nAfter settling in Efrat, Riskin began to engage with the Christian world. Most of the Christian visitors to Efrat, those who came to hear and learn, were Evangelicals. He formed relations with Rev. Robert Stearns of Eagles' Wings and with Pastor John Hagee.\n\nCJCUC hosts Christian groups from all over the world for all-day seminars, which include tours\nof biblical sites such as nearby Jerusalem, the Path of the Patriarchs and the Herodian wells.\nAmong the subjects that the seminar series includes are Jewish–Christian Relations; the Theology\nof Biblical Holidays; Covenant and Mission; The Ten Commandments; Satan, Evil and Free Will;\nJudaism and the Ministry of Jesus; and Human Life Created in the Image of God.\n\nThe center runs educational seminars for students and faculty of Catholic and Protestant seminaries in the United States, Canada, and Europe. It has appointed North American and European directors to coordinate relations with religious leaders on these continents.\n\nCJCUC has established a Theological Think Tank, the Institute for Theological Inquiry (ITI), headed by Rabbi Eugene Korn and Dr. Robert Jenson of the Witherspoon Institute, which consists of international scholars and theologians whose tasks are to clarify areas of Jewish and Christian theological agreement and disagreement, as well as identify areas of fruitful cooperation. The topics focus on past and present Jewish–Christian Relations, Covenant, Salvation, Biblical Hermeneutics, Religion and Violence, Ethical Monotheism, and\nMessianism.\n\nIn May 2011, CJCUC facilitated and sponsored a Yale University student group consisting of Orthodox Jewish and Evangelical Christians to learn the fundamentals of Jewish–Christian relations.\n\nIn March 2012, CJCUC took Latin American priests and rabbis to learn the fundamentals of Jewish-Catholic relations in the backdrop of the Holy Land.\n\nIn June 2012, CJCUC partnered with Christians United for Israel to bring 30 Evangelical pastors from the U.S. to learn the fundamentals of Jewish–Christian relations.\n\nIn February 2013, CJCUC co-sponsored the visit of more than 160 pastors to Israel through the Christians United for Israel organization.\n\nIn January 2015, CJCUC founder, Rabbi Shlomo Riskin along with CJCUC's Executive Director, David Nekrutman, addressed a group of 400 pastors and rabbis at a symposium held in Broward County, Florida.\n\nIn February 2015, on a visit to Oklahoma, Rabbi Riskin unveiled plans for historic high school curricula, being worked on in a joint effort with the government of Israel, detailing advancements in Jewish–Christian relations.\n\nIn July 2016, CJCUC announced that it was moving its center of operations from Efrat to the Bible Lands Museum in Jerusalem.\n\nCJCUC has received funds from Israel's Hertog family, Paul Singer Foundation, Zion's Gate International Foundation, Ministry of Justice, and John Hagee Ministries.\n\nIn October 2014, Riskin became the first Orthodox rabbi to invite Christian visitors to Israel to participate in a \"praise rally\" with Jewish interfaith leaders at the Center's headquarters during the holiday of Sukkot. For Sukkot 2012, he hosted a seminar for Christian visitors.\n\nIn March 2015, he launched the Day to Praise global initiative calling out to Christians worldwide to join him in reciting Hallel (Psalms 113–118) to praise God on Yom Ha'atzmaut (Israel's Independence Day).\n\nLater that year, in 2015, during the festival of Sukkot, CJCUC, together with its founder, Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, the chief rabbi of Efrat, hosted an interfaith event in Efrat in which 200 Christians and Jews came together to sing the praises of God in unity. Riskin said that \"the prayer event will help usher in the Messianic Age.\"\n\nCJCUC created the first food voucher program to help financially disadvantaged Christian Arabs living in the Land.\n\nIn September 2016, CJCUC's Associate Director, Rabbi Pesach Wolicki, launched the \"Blessing Bethlehem\" fundraising initiative at the LifeLight Festival in Sioux Falls, South Dakota in and effort to create a food giveaway program for persecuted Christians in Bethlehem and the surrounding area.\n\nIn October 2013, CJCUC Executive Director, David Nekrutman published a controversial appeal for funds from Jews to support the purchase of a permanent site for the Christian-Arab church of Pastor Steven Khoury.\n\nIn May 2014, CJCUC sponsored an interfaith Latin American clergy mission that visited the Ziv Medical Center in Safed, Israel, donating supplies to wounded Syrian civil war refugees.\n\nIn a September 2015 piece for The Times of Israel, Executive Director, David Nekrutman appealed to the Israeli Ministry of Education in regards to budget cuts and equal funding for Christian Schools in Israel citing these budget cuts as \"collateral damage\" of internal political issues and stating that these issues \"should never oppress minority populations\". Later, together with The Pave the Way Foundation (PTWF) and the Galilee Center for Studies in Jewish-Christian Relations (CSJCR), CJCUC initiated an international campaign urging the Israeli Prime Minister and Education Ministry to Save Christian Education.\n\nCJCUC accomplishments include:\n\n\n\n\nOn 3 December 2015, CJCUC spearheaded a petition of orthodox rabbis from around the world calling for increased partnership between Jews and Christians.\n\nThe unprecedented statement, entitled \"To Do the Will of Our Father in Heaven: Toward a Partnership between Jews and Christians\", was initially signed by over 25 prominent Orthodox rabbis in Israel, United States, and Europe, and now has over 60 signatories.\n\nThe statement cites traditional opinions by past rabbinic authorities to justify partnership with Christians and religious appreciation of Christianity.\n\nIn May 2017, the statement was approbated by Rabbi Abraham Skorka of Argentina and Cardinal Christoph Schönborn Archbishop of Vienna.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Spike defeats the demon but allows it to live.\n\nPrincipal Wood tells Buffy to go home and concentrate on her \"real\" job, killing monsters and getting ready to battle the First. Buffy takes him to the house and introduces him to the rest of the crew, including Spike. The tension between Spike and Wood is tangible. Wood gives Buffy a bag that he got from his mother and should have been passed on to Buffy anyway.\n\nChloe commits suicide after the First talks to her all night. Buffy delivers a strong lecture, angering many of the others. She accuses Spike of holding back in fights and rebukes him that he used to be a better fighter before he got his soul back. She calls an emergency and opens the slayer's bag. Inside is a set of shadow figures that trigger a portal. Against the advice of her friends, Buffy jumps in, sending back an enormous demon that beats everybody up and flees.

It was one of the first Israeli newspapers to use colour printing.\n\nThe paper was soon hit by a scandal as it published details of the Kav 300 affair in violation of the Israeli Military Censor. Having decided not to join the Editors Committee, \"Hadashot\" published a story stating that an investigative committee had been formed to look into the incident. As a result, the censor closed the paper for three days from 29 April 1984 for not sending the information about the article. Although the paper was cleared of all charges in 1993, the closure damaged the momentum the paper had gained.\n\n\"Hadashot\" initially had a young, left-wing, anti-establishment image, and was written in youthful Hebrew, bordering on slang.

It is in colour and in the English language. It is part of the \"In Search of History\" series.\n\nThe Nazi Party reportedly grew out of several occult groups that sprang up in the late 19th century as a reaction to the advanced materialism and technology of the era. These groups spoke of the coming of a new Messiah that would save Germany. Hitler developed the notion that perhaps he was the chosen one to save the German people.\n\nThe political parties created in the wake of the country's defeat in World War I combined nationalistic sentiment and occultist practices to forge an image of a superior German people. Hitler's imprisonment after the failed 1923 Munich Beer Hall Putsch would make him a national hero for his defense of a strong German state, convincing him that he was the Messiah who could save Germany.\n\nHitler appropriated Christian symbolism, such as the Spear of Destiny and the Holy Grail for his own purposes. He adopted the swastika from the Hindu/Sanskrit symbol for the Sun. The original symbol turns clockwise. The Nazi one turns backwards. The four arms of the original Hindu swastika represented the Four Vedas. It decorates most Hindu homes and temples.\n\nAt the conclusion, author Dusty Sklar points out that Hitler's suicide happened during the night of April 30 – May 1, known as Walpurgis Night. The narrator continues: \"With Hitler gone, it was as if a spell had been broken\". Then Joachim von Ribbentrop's infamous statement of his continued subservience to Hitler at the Nuremberg Trials is taken as final evidence of Hitler's \"occult power\": (\"Even with all I know, if in this cell Hitler should come to me and say 'Do this!', I would still do it.\").\n\n"}

Having received the \"grant of speech\" from Oyasama, Iburi dictated the Osashizu, additional divinely inspired instructions on the creation and maintenance of a Tenrikyo community.\n\nIburi was born in Murō, Nara in 1833, but was forced to leave when his family became despondent. He moved to modern-day Tenri, and sought out a wife. His first wife died in childbirth, while the second arranged marriage to a gambling addict was quickly annulled. His third wife became gravely ill after childbirth which led him to seek Tenrikyo. He became a member after his wife was healed and went to see Oyasama every day, supporting her during times of religious persecution.\n\nIburi presided over a period of rapid expansion for Tenrikyo, which saw it reach villages throughout Japan. In 1896, eight percent of all Japanese citizens were dues-paying adherents of Tenrikyo. Iburi petitioned the government to be separated from the Sect Shinto group Shinto Honkyoku; this petition was granted in 1908.\n\nIt was Iburi's intention to continue the \"Honseki\" position by passing on spiritual leadership to a worthy successor, while the \"Shinbashira\" position was passed on in the Nakayama family. He chose a woman, Naraito Ueda, for this position.

{"id": "429985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=429985", "title": "Imamah (Shia)", "text": "Imamah (Shia)\n\nIn Shia Islam, the imamah () is the doctrine that the figures known as imams are rightfully the central figures of the ummah; the entire Shi'ite system of doctrine focuses on the imamah. Shi'ites believe that the Imams are the true Caliphs or rightful successors of Muhammad, and further that Imams are possessed of divine knowledge and authority (Ismah) as well as being part of the Ahl al-Bayt, the family of Muhammad. These Imams have the role of providing commentary and interpretation of the Quran as well as guidance.\n\nAccording to Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, the Imam is a means through which humans receive divine grace, because \"He brings men closer to obedience (of Allah) and keeps them away from disobedience.\" As fulfilling the human being is his wish, it is logical that God appoints Imams to subject man to his wishes. So his existence and his deeds display two forms of grace of God toward man.\n\nThe word \"Imām\" denotes a person who stands or walks \"in front\". For Sunni Islam, the word is commonly used to mean a person who leads the course of prayer in the mosque. It also means the head of a \"madhhab\" (\"school of thought\"). However, from the Shia point of view this is merely the \"basic\" understanding of the word in the Arabic language and, for its proper religious usage, the word \"Imam\" is applicable \"only\" to those members of the house of Muhammad designated as infallible by the preceding Imam.\n\nThe Shia further believe only these A'immah have the right to be Caliphs, meaning that all other caliphs, whether elected by consensus (\"Ijma\") or not, are usurpers of the Caliphate so those were political positions not divine positions.\n\nAll Muslims believe that Muhammad had said: \"To whomsoever I am Mawla, Ali is his Mawla.\" This hadith has been narrated in different ways by many different sources in no less than 45 hadith books of both Sunni and Shia collections. This hadith has also been narrated by the collector of hadiths, al-Tirmidhi, 3713; as well as Ibn Maajah, 121; etc. The major point of conflict between the Sunni and the Shia is in the interpretation of the word 'Mawla'. For the Shia the word means 'Master' and has the same elevated significance as when the term had been used to address Muhammad himself during his lifetime. Thus, when Muhammad actually (by speech) and physically (by way of having his closest companions including Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman [the three future Caliphs who had preceded Ali as Caliph] \"publicly\" accept Ali as their Master by taking Ali's hand in both of theirs as token of their allegiance to Ali) \"transferred\" this title and manner of addressing Ali as the Mawla for all Muslims at Ghadiri Khum Oasis just a few months before his death, the people that came to look upon Ali as Muhammad's \"immediate successor\" even before Muhamamd's death came to be known as the Shia. However, for the Sunnis the word simply means the 'beloved' or the 'revered' and has no other significance at all.\n\nWithin Shia Islam (Shiism), the various sects came into being because they differed over their Imams' successions, just as the Shia - Sunni separation within Islam itself had come into being from the dispute that had arisen over the succession to Muhammad. Each succession dispute brought forth a different tariqah (literal meaning 'path'; extended meaning 'sect') within Shia Islam. Each Shia tariqah followed its own particular Imam's dynasty, thus resulting in different numbers of Imams for each particular Shia tariqah. When the dynastic line of the separating successor Imam ended with no heir to succeed him, then either he (the last Imam) or his unborn successor was believed to have gone into concealment, that is, The Occultation.\n\nThe Shia tariqah with a majority of adherents are the Twelvers who are commonly known as the \"Shia\". After that come the Nizari Ismailis commonly known as the Ismailis; and then come the Mustalian Ismailis commonly known as the \"Bohras\" with further schisms within their Bohri tariqah. The Druze tariqah initially were part of the Fatimid Ismailis and separated from them (the Fatimid Ismailis) after the death of the Fatimid Imam and Caliph al Hakim Bi Amrillah. The Shia Sevener tariqah no longer exists. Another small tariqah is the Zaidi Shias, also known as the Fivers and who do not believe in The Occultation of their last Imam.\n\nAlthough all these different Shia tariqahs belong to the Shia group (as opposed to the Sunni group) in Islam, there are major doctrinal differences between the main Shia tariqahs. After that there is the complete doctrinal break between all the different Shia tariqahs whose last Imams have gone into Occultation and the Shia Nizari Ismailis who deny the very concept of Occultation. The Shia Nizari Ismailis by definition have to have a present and living Imam until the end of time. Thus if any living Nizari Ismaili Imam fails to leave behind a successor after him then the Nizari Ismailism’s cardinal principle would be broken and it’s very raison d'être would come to an end.\n\nShias believe that Imamah is of the Principles of Faith (Usul al-Din). As the verse 4:165 of Quran expresses the necessity to the appointment of the prophets; so after the demise of the prophet who will play the role of the prophet; till the people have not any plea against Allah. The same logic that necessitated the assignment of prophets also is applied for Imamah. That is Allah must assign someone similar to prophet in his attributes and Ismah as his successor to guide the people without any deviation in religion.\n\nThey refer to the verse \"(...This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion...)\" 5:3 of Quran which was revealed to the prophet when he appointed Ali as his successor at the day of Ghadir Khumm.\n\nBy the verse Quran, 2:124, Shias believe that Imamah is a divine position always Imamah is accompanied by the word guidance, of course a guidance by God's Command.A kind of guidance which brings humanity to the goal. Regarding 17:71, no age can be without an Imam. So, according to the upper verse 1.Imamah is a position which is appointed by God and must be specified by Him 2.Imam is protected by a divine protection and no one exceles him in nobility 3. No age can be without an Imam and finally Imam knows everything which is needed for human being to get to the truth and goal.\n\nIt is forbidden for the Divine Leader not to be from the family of Muhammad. According to Ali al-Ridha, since it is obligatory to obey him, there should be a sign to clearly indicate the Divine Leader. That sign is his well-known ties of kinship with Muhammad and his clear appointment so that the people could distinguish him from others, and be clearly guided toward him. Otherwise others are nobler than Muhammad's offspring and they are to be followed and obeyed; and the offspring of Muhammad are obedient and subject to the offspring of Muhammad’s enemies such as Abi Jahl or Ibn Abi Ma’eet. However, Muhammad is much nobler than others to be in charge and to be obeyed.\nMoreover, once the prophethood of Muhammad is testified they would obey him, no one would hesitate to follow his offspring and this would not be hard for anyone. While to follow the offspring of the corrupted families is difficult. And that is maybe why the basic characteristic of Muhammad and other prophets was their nobility. For none of them, it is said, were originated from a disgraced family. It is believed that all Muhammad's ancestors up to Adam were true Muslims. \nJesus was also from a pious family, as it is mentioned in Quran that after his birth, people said to Mary: O sister of Aaron, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste.\"\n\nThe doctrine of the Imamate in Isma'ilism differs from that of the Twelvers because the Isma'ilis had living Imams for centuries after the last Twelver Imam went into concealment. They followed Isma'il ibn Jafar, elder brother of Musa al-Kadhim, as the rightful Imam after his father, Ja'far al-Sadiq. The Ismailis believe that whether Imam Ismail did or did not die before Imam Ja'far, he had passed on the mantle of the imamate to his son Muhammad ibn Isma'il as the next imam.\n\nAccording to Isma'ilism, God has sent seven great prophets known as \"Nātiq\"s \"Speaker\" in order to disseminate and improve his dīn of \"Islam\". All of these great prophets has also one assistant known as \"Sāmad\" \"Silent\" Imām. At the end of each seven \"Sāmad\" silsilas, one great \"Nātiq\" has been sent in order to improve the faith. After Adam and his son Seth, and after six \"Nātiq–Sāmad\" silsila (Noah–Shem), (Abraham–Ishmael), (Moses–Aaron), (Jesus–Simeon, son of Jacob), (Muhammad–Ali); the silsila of \"Nātiq\"s and \"Sāmad\"s have been completed with Muhammad ibn Isma'il.\n\nIsmailis view Imams are true representative of God. God has made all prophets his representative. Individual prophets era are distinct. After one prophets God created next prophet. Islam view that Mohammed is last prophet. Mohammed appointed his specific representative Ali. Ali made imams as his next representative and one imam appointed another till date. The Isma'ili view that these Imam are only from their hereditary chain and their appointment is a must, and Earth cannot remain vacant, without presence of Imam.\n\nZaidiyyah or Zaidi is a Shia madhhab (sect, school) named after the imam Zayd ibn Ali. Followers of the Zaidi fiqh are called Zaidis (or are occasionally called Fivers in the West). However, there is also a group called the Zaidi \"Wasītī\"s who are Twelvers.\n\nIn the context of the Shi'a Muslim belief in spiritual leadership or Imamate, Zaydis believe that the leader of the Ummah or Muslim community must be \"Fatimids\": descendants of Muhammad through his only surviving daughter Fatimah, whose sons were Hasan ibn ʻAlī and Husayn ibn ʻAlī. These Shi'a called themselves Zaydi so they could differentiate themselves from other Shi'is who refused to take up arms with Zayd ibn Ali.\n\nZaydis believe Zayd ibn Ali was the rightful successor to the Imamate because he led a rebellion against the Umayyad Caliphate, who he believed were tyrannical and corrupt. Muhammad al-Baqir did not engage in political action and the followers of Zayd believed that a true Imām must fight against corrupt rulers. The renowned Muslim jurist Abu Hanifa who is credited for the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam, delivered a fatwā or legal statement in favour of Zayd in his rebellion against the Umayyad ruler. He also urged people in secret to join the uprising and delivered funds to Zayd.\n\nUnlike Twelver Shi'ites, Zaydis do not believe in the infallibility of Imāms and do not believe that the Imāmate must pass from father to son—but believe it can be held by any descendant, from either Hasan ibn ʻAlī or Husayn ibn ʻAlī.\n\nThe period of occultation (\"ghaybat\") is divided into two parts:\n\n\nDuring the Minor Occultation (\"Ghaybat al-Sughrá\"), it is believed that al-Mahdi maintained contact with his followers via deputies (Arab. \"an-nuwāb al-arbaʻa\" or \"the Four Leaders\"). They represented him and acted as agents between him and his followers. Whenever the believers faced a problem, they would write their concerns and send them to his deputy. The deputy would ascertain his verdict, endorse it with his seal and signature and return it to the relevant parties. The deputies also collected zakat and khums on his behalf.\n\nFor the Shia, the idea of consulting a hidden Imam was not something new because the two prior Twelver Imams had, on occasion, met with their followers from behind a curtain. Also, during the oppressive rule of the later Abbasid caliphs, the Shia Imams were heavily persecuted and held prisoners, thus their followers were forced to consult their Imams via messengers or secretly.\n\nShia Tradition hold that four deputies acted in succession to one another:\n\n\nIn 941 (329 AH), the fourth deputy announced an order by al-Mahdi, that the deputy would soon die and that the deputyship would end and the period of the Major Occultation would begin.\n\nThe fourth deputy died six days later and the Shia Muslims continue to await the reappearance of the Mahdi. In the same year, many notable Shia scholars such as Ali ibn Babawayh Qummi and Muhammad ibn Ya'qub Kulayni, the learned compiler of \"Kitab al-Kafi\", also died.\n\nOne view is that the Hidden Imam is on earth \"among the body of the Shia\" but \"incognito.\" \"Numerous stories\" exist of the Hidden Imam \"manifesting himself to prominent members of the ulama.\"\n\nThe Ismailis differ from Twelvers because they had living imams for centuries after the last Twelver Imam went into concealment. They followed Isma'il ibn Jafar, elder brother of Musa al-Kadhim, as the rightful Imam after his father Ja'far al-Sadiq. The Ismailis believe that whether Imam Ismail did or did not die before Imam Ja'far, he had passed on the mantle of the imamate to his son Muḥammad ibn Ismail as the next imam. Thus, their line of imams is as follows (the years of their individual imamats during the Common Era are given in brackets):\n\nThe eighth Imam, Abd Allah al-Akbar of the Ismaili Shia remained hidden but continued the Ismaili movement in the 9th century in Salamiyah, Syria. The eighth to tenth Imams, (Abadullah, Ahmed and Husain), remained hidden and worked for the movement against the period's time's rulers. First phase of seclusion ends with 10th Imam. The 11th Imam Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah, under the guise of being a merchant, and his son had made their way to Sijilmasa, fleeing persecution by the Abbasids. Imam Abdullah founded Fatimid Caliphate. The Fatimid Ismaili Imams continued till 20th Imam holding the post of caliph also, ruling a vast part of Arabian peninsula.\n\nUpon the death of the twentieth Imam, al-Amir bi-Ahkami'l-Lah (d. ), his two-year old child at-Tayyib Abu'l-Qasim (b. ) was appointed twenty-first Imam. The supporters of Tayyeb became the Tayyibi Ismāʿīlī. As Tayyeb was not in position to run the dawah, Queen Arwa al-Sulayhi, the Da'i al-Mutlaq, acted as his regent. Imam Tayyeb was hidden, and second phase of seclusion started. The Da'i had now been given absolute authority and made independent from political activity. With period of time Tayyibi divided further into several sects headed by different Dai they believed. These Dai continued acting on behalf of hidden Imams till date. Dawoodi Bohra is biggest amongst them with population spread over many countries all over the continentals.\n\nAccording to the majority of Shī'a, namely the Twelvers (\"Ithnā'ashariyya\"), the following is a listing of the rightful successors to Muḥammad. Each Imam was the son of the previous Imam except for Hussayn ibn 'Alī, who was the brother of Hassan ibn 'Alī.The belief in this succession to Muḥammad stems from various Quranic verses which include: 75:36, 13:7, 35:24, 2:30, 2:124, 36:26, 7:142, 42:23. They support their discussion by citing Genesis 17:19–20 and Sunni hadith:Sahih Muslim, Hadith number 4478, English translation by Abdul Hamid Siddiqui.\n\nAccording to Twelvers, there is always an Imam of the era, who is the divinely appointed authority on all matters of faith and law in the Muslim community. Ali was the first of the Twelve Imams, and, in the Twelvers and Sufis' view, the rightful successor to Muhammad, followed by male descendants of Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah. Each Imam was the son of the previous Imam, with the exception of Husayn ibn Ali, who was the brother of Hasan ibn Ali. The twelfth and final Imam is Muhammad al-Mahdi, who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive, and hidden in the Major Occultation until he returns to bring justice to the world. It is believed by Twelver and Alevi Muslims that the Twelve Imams have been foretold in the Hadith of the Twelve Successors. All of the Imams met unnatural deaths, with the exception of the last Imam, who according to Twelver and Alevi belief, is living in occultation.\n\nThe Ismaili line of imams for both sects (the Nizari and Musta'li) continues undivided until al-Mustansir Billah (d. 1094). After his death the line of the imamat separates into the Nizari and Musta'li dynasties.\n\nThe line of imams of the Musta'li Muslims (also known as the Bohras/Dawoodi Bohra) continued up to Aamir ibn Mustali. After his death, they believe their 21st Imam, at-Tayyib Abu'l-Qasim went into a Dawr-e Satr (period of concealment) that continues to this day. In the absence of an imam they are led by a Da'i al-Mutlaq (absolute missionary) who manages the affairs of the Imam-in-Concealment until re-emergence of the Imam from concealment.\n\nThe line of imams of the Nizari Ismaili Shia Muslims (also known as the Agha-khani Ismailis in South and Central Asia) continues to their present living 49th hereditary imam, Aga Khan IV (son of Prince Aly Khan). They are the only Shia Muslim community today led by a present and living (Hazir wa Mawjud) imam.\n\nThe Zaidi branch of Shi'ism established its own line of Imams starting in the year 897; the line continued without interruption until 1962 when the North Yemen Civil War brought the Imamate to an end and established a republic.\n\nThe Syrian mufti Ibn Taymiyyah (d. 728 AH/1328 AD) composed a long refutation of the notion of the Imamate in his \"Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah\".\n\nThe belief of the Twelver Imamah with the consideration of the sacred status of the four Rashidun Caliphs is shared in Sunni Islam, due to the following hadith of Muhammad:\n\n\"I heard the Apostle of Allah say 'Islam shall not cease to be glorious up to twelve Caliphs, every one of them being from the Quraish'\". (And in a narration) \"The affairs of men will not cease to decline so long as twelve men will rule over them, every one of them coming from Quraish. And in a narration: The religion will continue to be established till the hour comes as there are twelve Caliphs over them, everyone of them coming from the Quraish\"\n\"The affairs of the people will continue to be conducted as long as they are governed by twelve men, he then added from Quraish\"\n\"I will be followed by twelve Khalifas all will be Quraysh\". \n\n\n\n\n"}

They are the priests or gurus of the Hindu Shaiva. There is an age old tradition calling Jangamas as gurus of'Lingayat’ .Jangamas are disciples of Lord Shiva as mentioned in Puranas. A visit of a jangam to a house is treated as the visit of Lord Shiva himself and the jangam shall be given good alms and the jangam blesses the natives. The Jangam is the wandering holy man in Virashaivism. Jangams are to he regarded as moving and living lingas. And are therefore superior to fixed lingas - made of stones and\ninstalled in temples as also worn on persons as mentioned in purnas.\n\nAccording to the Hindu mythology of India, Goddess Parvati had claimed that she had given birth to Lord Ganesh (elephant headed Deity) when she died as Sati (previous incarnation who died by self-immolation). She told Lord Shiva. that he too should also create a similar lord. Lord Shiva proceeded to cut his thigh and his blood spilled on the lifeless statue known as Kusha which immediately came alive and was thereafter referred to as Jangam. \"The term 'Jangam’ (or) 'Jangam Sages' in Himalayas, Kashi and Kumbh mela (or) 'Jangam Sadhu' in Hindu Temples (or)'Jangam Ayya' in Karnataka Priestly Section (or) 'Jangam Lingayat Pandaram' in Tamil Nadu Priestly Section and Kerala (or) Jangam Jogi in Haryana (or) 'Jangam Baba' in North India (or) Jangam Deva in Andhra Pradesh (or) Jangam Guru in Nepal is also the name given to the wandering Shivite (Hindu worshippers of Lord Shiva) mendicants who are believed to be descendants of the original ‘Jangam’.\" They function as priests or Guru for all those who follow the Shivite cult and for those who don’t avail of services of the Brahmin priests. In most temples the priests who conduct the religious rituals are Brahmins however this is not true for the Lord Shiva temples where the Jangams perform the Pooja (prayer and worship of Lord Shiva). The Jangam priests may preside over all rituals however special regard is given to marriage rites in Lingayatism and Shaivism section of Hinduism.\n\nJangama dhyana technique is associated with Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj and his direct disciple Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj. On 7 August 1949, Shri Shivabalayogi experienced a vision of a tall Jangama Sage (ancient order of ascetics) with matted hair, who told him to sit in padmasana (lotus posture), and close his eyes. The Sage then touched the young boy between the eyebrows and instructed, 'Watch here.' Thus, Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj sat in tapas (deep, prolonged meditation) for twelve years, meditating for 23 hours a day for eight years and around 12 hours a day for the remaining four years. After this period, he initiated tens of thousands of people into the meditation technique he had used to achieve Self Realization.\nThe name for the technique was coined by Shri Shivabalayogi while walking around the Dehradun ashram one night with his direct disciple, Seenu, who was later to become the Enlightened Yogi, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi. He suddenly turned to Seenu and said:\n\n\"Perhaps it would be nice to name the meditation technique we are teaching worldwide as Jangama dhyana. Lord Shiva first appeared to me in the form of a Jangama Sage to impart the technique, and Jangama means 'Eternal Existence'; so Jangama dhyana would mean 'meditation on the Eternal Existence of the Self.\"\nFor more information visit Jangama dhyana\n\nThe Jangam Lingyat called as Jangam Lingayath religion caste is composed of respectable people.Pandaram is surname ( Title) of Jangam people. The name pandaram is from Tamil word means valuable storing place of jewels, navarathnas stored in the Lord Shiva temples and palaces, they are placed to maintain the jewels of Lord Shiva temples and palaces in Tamil Nadu. Jangam Lingyat Pandaram (Jangam Lingyat or Jangam) in Tamil Nadu are Land holders, Traders, Sanyasis or Monk or Priests or Guru and Managers of richly endowed Lord Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. \"The Jangam Lingayat pandaram are known as Lingayath religion or Jangam Lingayath or Jangamma in Lord Shiva temples and Lord Basava temples in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry\". Many Jangam live in Tamil Nadu, specifically, and in Vellore, Cuddalore, Virudhunagar, Sivakasi, Dindigul, Pattukkottai, Theni, Dharmapuri, Madurai, Krishnagiri, Namakkal, Erode, Tirupur, Villupuram, Arni and Coimbatore, Pudukottai, Salem, Kanchipuram, Thiruvellore, Trichy and Chennai (Madras) districts. In Kerala,specifically Palakkad, Kollam, Kottayam districts. The Jangam is the holy man in Virashaivism. The divinity of the Jangama is reflected in many narrative stories in the Basava Purana and other collections, and in which the Jangama is actually\nShiva. Jangam also called as Veerashaiva Brahmins.\n\nLingayath contains two sections, one the ancient race of Veerashaiva jangam ( the priests at Srisailam and Kedarnath since the times of Adi Shankaracharya) and the Lingayat which constitutes all different working classes of the society. Jangam Lingayaths where Ishtalinga on their chest hanging through a thread in Karnataka. After death they are buried in Dhyana-Mudra with Linga in hand or they have given Samadhi or called Lingaekya or merger in god Linga. They believe in formless god in form of Ista-Linga and no other idol . \"The Jangam Lingayat or Jangam are known as Lingayath or True Lingayath or Movable Lingam or Jangam Sage or Jangama or Lingayat Priest or Jangam Guru or Guru/ Jangam Ayya in Lord Basava Period of Lingayath Religion and Lord Shiva temples in Karnataka\".\n\nJangam Jogi are folk musicians associated with region of Haryana. Jangam is a style of devotional music dedicated to Lord Shiva by Jangam community from Haryana. Their instruments are small and portable (being travellers) like dafli, khanjari, khartal. Jangam Gāyan: Devotional Music and Folk Music of India: Jangam Gāyan is a narrative sung by the Jangam and is performed in the temple courtyards of Lord Shiva temples to huge gatherings. Sometimes, there are public performances in village squares. The members of this community are wandering mendicants and earn their living mainly by performing the element in Lord Shiva temples. The Jangams are also live in Shiva the state of Haryana in India. The community is concentrated in and around Kurukshetra, the great battle field of the epic of Mahabharata and in the historical town of Thaneswar which has been a strong centre of the Pasupati (Lord Shiva) tradition of Shaivism. Besides, they also move as itinerant religious mendicants in the adjoining states of Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir in north India.\n\nAt present, Jangam follows the Hindu mythology of Jangam i.e., according to Hindu mythology of Lord Shiva they would live by Religious priestly performance (by priest, religious prayer, prayer for healing, and Guru). Jangam Katha Burra katha: Folk Dance in Andhra Pradesh: Jangam Katha is a special folk dance of the Andhra Pradesh state. Jangam Katha, is a special Dance of Andhra Pradesh Jangam or Jangam Deva or Jangamayya and it observes tales from the Indian Hindu Mythology. In the performance, the main artist (Jangam or Jangam Deva or Jangamayya) narrates a story, plays music and dance on the tunes. The co-artists beat drums and speak to him, enriching certain events in the story. Now, Jangam Katha is called as Burra katha, Tamboora Katha and Saradha Katha. Jangam or Jangama is one who is endowed with the true knowledge, sacrificed his life for the society, and avoided all the worldly happiness and attained the divine happiness. Jangam, a Sanskrit word, etymologically means that which moves. When this word applied to a person, in the context of Lingayath religion, it symbolizes a man who moves from place to place preaching moral and religious values in Shaivism, Lingayatism and Jangama dhyana section of Hinduism. \n\nJangam Dance is an Indian folk dance performed in the honour of Lord Shiva in Lord Shiva temples. Those who perform this traditional dance are called Jangam dancers. The term Jangam has been derived from the movable emblem of Lord Shiva. Jangam is a sub-caste of the Lingayat (Veerashaiva) community called Lingayath religion. The Jangams migrated from Karnataka and Andra Pradesh states of India in order to disseminate the Shaivaite cult and to act as priests for those who do not avail the services of Brahmans for performing religious rites in Lord Shiva temples. While performing Jangam dance, the dancers recite verses on the mythological marriage of Siva and Parvati. The recitation is done in a ritualistic hypnotic monotone. As performers, they entertain people during religious and social festivals in the obscurity of the villages. Their dramatic presence is heightened by their headgear, a brass band with the image of a snake and peacock feathers flashing in the air. Their narrative and rhythmic movement is embellished by bells, gongs, manjim or cymbals, and chhenna or percussion sticks, weaving the most incredible musical patterns. Presently, forced into penury by the loss of rural audiences to mass media, they are reduced to begging for alms.\n\nIn the 9th century, the king Narendra Dev of Lichhivi dynasty has described the Jangam Pratishthan, which is available in stone inscription in Anantlingeshwor temple, in which he has addressed the name of the Chancellor of Jangam Pratisthan and explained rights and duties performed by the Pratisthan. With this evidence we can say that Jangam community was present in Nepal before the 9th century.\nThe king of Karnatvansh Shri Nanya Dev became ruler of Mithila state (Northern Bihar) by expanding his dynasty in the 11th century. During the period Veerashaiva Jangam were the Rajaguru of the King Nanya Dev. After ruling the Mithila dynasty for 240 years King Harisingh Dev Mall became the king of Nepal Mandal and established the capital at Bhaktapur City. Devi Tula Bhavani was the deity they worshiped and they started spreading the religion of veerashaivism in the region. When Malla Vansh (dynasty) was established in Nepal Mandal Veerashaiva religion had started. The veerashaiva philosophy was being popularized by the disciples. It establishes that Veerashaiva religion section of Hinduism had its roots since the 9th century. There is a Jangam math in Bhaktapur. There is a stone inscription belonging to Nepali Year 692, which explains the role of Hari Singh Dev Mall of mallavansa, who renovated the Jangam math in Bhaktapur. With this, we can say that Veerashiava Religion was established in Nepal in the 13th century. There are many Stone writings and Tamrapatra available in jangam math in Nepal. Jangamwadi Math, Jangambari, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh: Jangamwadi Math is the oldest Math among all the maths of Kashi, Kashi Vishwanath Temple Uttar Pradesh, India and is also known as Jnana Simhasana or Jnana Peetha. Jangam means knower of Shiva, wadi means living place. One among the five of the holiest shrines for the Lingayath religion.\n\nJangams are factually considered as movable lingas. Jangam is considered a human linga shrine. Jangams are divided into Virakhtas or celibates, Samanyas or common Jangams, Ganachans or managers, and Mathapathis or Beadles.\n\nVirakthas, the highest class of Jangams, dedicate themselves to celibacy. They are not allowed to celebrate marriages. They are comparatively a small body and move about the country accompanied by their disciples. The Samanya Jangam is the ordinary Jangam who had the initiation performed on him. He is a married man, who conducts marriages, begs, serves in a temple or lives by agriculture. When a Jangam goes begging, he wears a garter of bells called Jang below his right knee, and carries a cobra cane. Mathapatis or beadles and Ganachans or managers are Jangams who hold rent-free lands. They are considered rather inferior to the regular or Samanya Jangams.\n\"The two main categories of Jangam are 1) Sthira 2) Chara.\" Sthira Jangama: is a person who, staying in math (mutt) i.e., has to carry on mass education, preaching to the local people, and giving them the necessary guidance to achieve spiritual progress called Jangama dhyana, and to perform certain rites and rituals concerned with birth, marriage, death, holy communication on special occasions etc. Chara Jangama is one who constantly moves around, preaching as he goes, without settling himself at any particular place and without accumulating any property of his own.\n\nThe community is distributed throughout India and also in Nepal. However, they form a significant proportion of population in the southern states of India mainly Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.\n\nIn Jangam community, the male child after the initiation (Ayyachar) will be handed over to the custody of Jangam (Guru). The child will be brought up under shelter of Jangam (in mutt/math) and by his blessings he too can become a Jangam (Guru) of any of the maths. Jangam priests live in ‘maths’ and guide their followers in Hindu religious and spiritual matters.\n\nJangams are Hindus by religion, they follow the tenets of Veershaiva Lingayat section. They wear, Linga on their body, the Linga is always cased in a silver box called ‘Gundagi’ which is tied round the neck by a thread called ‘Shwdhar' They worship the Linga daily after taking bath, smear their forehead with ‘Vibhuti' and do not touch food without offering 'Nyvedya' to the 'Istalinga’. \n\nThe Linga is tied to the womb in the 8th or 9th month of mother’s pregnancy for the prospective child. Linga wearing ceremony to the child is thus performed before the child takes birth. \n\nThree types Jangam gurus are (i) Dikshaguru (who tins the Linga) (ii) Sikshaguru (who imparts education) (iii) Mokshaguru (who is a religious guide).\n\nVeershaiva Jangams celebrate a Hindu festivals, namely, Deepavali, Shivrathi, Ugadi, Nagarpanchmai etc. Among these festivals Shivratri is an important one. On this day all elderly people observe fast and they perform Bhajanas (Prayer) in praise of 'Lord Shiva'.\n\nJangam : Born out of Lord Shiva's Thigh and Religious priestly (by priest, religious prayer, prayer for healing, and Guru): Jangam sages, who claim they originated from a part (thigh) of Lord Shiva's body. Jangam claims that he is born out of the thigh of Shiva. Hindu mythology has it, \"Shiva wanted to give some donation to Brahma and Vishnu but when they refused he became so angry that it led to his creating the Jangam Sages.\". \"Jangam or Jangama over the generations have been able to maintain a distinct identity over generations.\" What sets them apart is their attire and the rituals that they follow. The \"Jangam sages\" go from one place to another and explain the different saints the story of the holy union of Lord Shiva and Parvati. With the Shivpuran (Lord Shiva) on the tip of their hand, enacting the epic tale for them is nothing but a piece of cake. Hindu mythology has it, Lord Shiva had blessed them with \"immortality\" but declared that they would \"live by religious begging in Lord Shiva temples (by priest, religious prayer, prayer for healing, and Guru )\". Another version is that Lord Shiva at his wedding created two recipients of his alms, one Jangam, from the sweat of his brow, the other Lingam, from his thigh. These Jangams accept alms from devout. \"The jangams meanwhile suggest, they don’t earn more money, a month. They do so by religious Prayer (The chanting of mantras) begging (by priest, religious prayer, prayer for healing, and Guru) in Prayer in Hinduism\". \"At present, The 21st Century, Still now they (some Jangam) follows the Hindu mythology of Jangam ie., according to Hindu mythology Lord Shiva had blessed them (Jangam) with immortality (ie., entire world is destroyed by nature or some other factors to destroyed the nature, Jangam will Live) but declared that they would live by Religious Begging in Lord Shiva temples (by priest, religious prayer, prayer for healing, and Guru) (The Lord's Prayer) after some religious event completed by them in Prayer in Hinduism.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1261981", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1261981", "title": "Jew (word)", "text": "Jew (word)\n\nThe English term Jew originates in the Biblical Hebrew word \"Yehudi\", meaning \"from the Kingdom of Judah\", or \"Jew\". It passed into Greek as \"Ioudaios\" and Latin as \"Iudaeus\", which evolved into the Old French \"giu\" after the letter \"d\" was dropped. A variety of related forms are found in early English from about the year 1000, including \"Iudea\", \"Gyu\", \"Giu\", \"Iuu\", \"Iuw\", and \"Iew\", which eventually developed into the modern word.\n\nAccording to the Book of Genesis, Judah (, \"Yehudah\") was the name of the fourth son of the patriarch Jacob. During the Exodus, the name was given to the Tribe of Judah, descended from the patriarch Judah. After the conquest and settlement of the land of Canaan, Judah also referred to the territory allocated to the tribe. After the splitting of the united Kingdom of Israel, the name was used for the southern kingdom of Judah. The kingdom now encompassed the tribes of Judah, Benjamin and Simeon, along with some of the cities of the Levites. With the destruction of the northern kingdom of Israel (Samaria), the kingdom of Judah became the sole Jewish state and the term \"y'hudi\" () was applied to all Israelites. When the word makes its first appearance in writing (in the book of Esther) its meaning has already expanded to include converts to the Jewish religion as well as descendants of Israelites.\n\nThe term \"Yehudi\" () occurs 74 times in the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible. The plural, \"Yehudim\" () first appears in where it refers to a defeat for the Yehudi army or nation, and in , where it refers to the language of the Yehudim (). has the earliest singular usage of the word \"Yehudi\". In , the name \"Yehudi\" () has a generic aspect, in this case referring to a man from the tribe of Benjamin:\n\nThe name appears in the Bible as a verb in which states:\n\nIn some places in the Talmud the word \"Israel(ite)\" refers to somebody who is Jewish but does not necessarily practice Judaism as a religion: \"An Israel(ite) even though he has sinned is still an Israel(ite)\" (Tractate \"Sanhedrin\" 44a). More commonly the Talmud uses the term \"Bnei Yisrael\", i.e. \"Children of Israel\", (\"Israel\" being the name of the third patriarch Jacob, father of the sons that would form the twelve tribes of Israel, which he was given and took after wrestling with an angel, see Genesis 32:28-29) to refer to Jews. According to the Talmud then, there is no distinction between \"religious Jews\" and \"secular Jews.\"\n\nIn modern Hebrew, the same word is still used to mean both Jews and Judeans (\"of Judea\"). In Arabic the terms are \"yahūdī\" (sg.), \"al-yahūd\" (pl.), and بَنُو اِسرَائِيل \"banū isrāʼīl\". The Aramaic term is \"\".\n\nThe Septuagint (reputedly a product of Hellenistic Jewish scholarship) and other Greek documents translated , \"Yehudi\" and the Aramaic \"\" using the Koine Greek term \"Ioudaios\" (; pl. \"Ioudaioi\"), which had lost the 'h' sound. The Latin term, following the Greek version, is \"Iudaeus\", and from these sources the term passed to other European languages. The Old French \"giu\", earlier \"juieu\", had elided (dropped) the letter \"d\" from the Latin \"Iudaeus\". The Middle English word \"Jew\" derives from Old English where the word is attested as early as 1000 in various forms, such as \"Iudeas\", \"Gyu\", \"Giu\", \"Iuu\", \"Iuw\", \"Iew\". The Old English name is derived from Old French. The modern French term is \"juif\".\n\nMost European languages have retained the letter \"d\" in the word for Jew. Etymological equivalents are in use in other languages, e.g., \"Jude\" in German, \"judeu\" in Portuguese, \"jøde\" in Danish and Norwegian, \"judío\" in Spanish, \"jood\" in Dutch, etc. In some languages, derivations of the word \"Hebrew\" are also in use to describe a Jew, e.g., \"Ebreo\" in Italian, \"Ebri/Ebrani\" () in Persian and \"Еврей, Yevrey\" in Russian. (See Jewish ethnonyms for a full overview.)\n\nThe German word \"Jude\" is pronounced , the corresponding adjective \"jüdisch\" (Jewish), and is cognate with the Yiddish word for \"Jew\", \"Yid\".\n\nIn modern English, the term \"Israelite\" was used to refer to contemporary Jews as well as to Jews of antiquity until the mid-20th-century. Since the foundation of the State of Israel, it has become less common to use \"Israelite\" of Jews in general. Instead, citizens of the state of Israel, whether Jewish or not, are called \"Israeli\", while \"Jew\" is used as an ethno-religious designation.\n\nThe word \"Jew\" has been used often enough in a disparaging manner by antisemites that in the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was frequently avoided altogether, and the term \"Hebrew\" was substituted instead (e.g. Young Men's Hebrew Association). Even today some people are wary of its use, and prefer to use \"Jewish\". Indeed, when used as an adjective (e.g. \"Jew lawyer\") or verb (e.g. \"to jew someone\"), the term \"Jew\" is purely pejorative. According to \"The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\", Fourth Edition (2000):\nIt is widely recognized that the attributive use of the noun \"Jew\", in phrases such as \"Jew lawyer\" or \"Jew ethics\", is both vulgar and highly offensive. In such contexts \"Jewish\" is the only acceptable possibility. Some people, however, have become so wary of this construction that they have extended the stigma to any use of \"Jew\" as a noun, a practice that carries risks of its own. In a sentence such as \"There are now several Jews on the council\", which is unobjectionable, the substitution of a circumlocution like \"Jewish people\" or \"persons of Jewish background\" may in itself cause offense for seeming to imply that Jew has a negative connotation when used as a noun.\n\nIn much the same manner, the Yiddish term for \"Jew\" (,) \"Yid\", (singular), \"Yidn\" (plural)) — originally a benign term — was once used as an ethnic slur, but now is often used by Jews in praise, to describe an upstanding religiously observant Jew (e.g., \"He's such a \"Yid\", giving up his time like that\") or to distinguish upstanding religiously observant Jews from non-observant, with the implication that the latter would be better people if they were stricter in their observance (e.g., \"\"Yidn\" wouldn't do such a thing\").\n\n"}

The first numerals for the date may be read as 40, or possibly 70 (according to Buhler), so that the regnal date could be either 42 or 72 (with 72 being favoured by most).\n\nAccording to Smith, the initial year of the era used by the great Satrap Sodasa is not known, but the inscription may be considered as dating a few years earlier than the Christian era or the 1st century. According to others, it is not known if the date 42/72 is a regnal year of Sodasa, or an era founded by his father or another ruler. \n\nAccording to some authors, the regnal date for Sodasa was 80 CE, so that the tablet would have been dedicated in 152 CE (50+72). A recent date for Sodasa's reign was given as 15 CE, meaning that the regnal date of the inscription would start from the Vikrama era started by Indo-Scythian king Azes I (Bikrami calendar (starting in 57 BCE)+72=15 CE). This would put the long reign of his father Rajuvula in the last quarter of the 1st century BCE, which is probable. \n\nAnother inscription of the Satrap Sodasa was found by Alexander Cunningham in the Jail mound at Mathura. His coins also are found in the neighborhood.\n"}

A \"kannushi\" was a man capable of miracles or a holy man who, because of his practice of purificatory rites, was able to work as a medium for a kami. Later the term evolved to being synonymous with \"shinshoku\", that is, a man who works at a shrine and holds religious ceremonies there.\n\nIn ancient times, because of the overlap of political and religious power within a clan, it was the head of the clan who led the clansmen during religious functions, or else it could be another official. Later, the role evolved into a separate and more specialized form. The term appears in both the \"Kojiki\" (680 AD) and \"Nihon Shoki\" (720 AD). In them respectively, Empress Jungū and Emperor Suijin become \"kannushi\".\n\nWithin the same shrine, for example at Ise Jingū or Ōmiwa Shrine, there can be different types of \"kannushi\" at the same time called for example , , or .\n\n\"Kannushi\" can marry and their children usually inherit their position.\nAlthough this hereditary status is no longer legally granted, it continues in practice.\n\nThe clothes they wear, for example the \"jōe\", the \"ebōshi\" and the \"kariginu\" (see photos), do not have any special religious significance, but are simply official garments used in the past by the Imperial court.

Other implements used by \"kannushi\" include a baton called \"shaku\" and a wand decorated with white paper streamers (\"shide\") called \"ōnusa\". \"Kannushi\" are assisted in their religious or clerical work by women called \"miko\".\n\nTo become a \"kannushi\", a novice must study at a university approved by the , typically Tokyo's Kokugakuin University or Ise's Kogakkan University, or pass an exam that will certify his qualification.

Marriage is thought to consist of a covenant between the man, the woman, and God. The church teaches that in addition to civil marriage, which ends at death, a man and woman can undergo a celestial marriage in a temple performed by priesthood authority, whereby the marriage and parent–child relationships resulting from the marriage will last forever in the afterlife.\n\nFrom 1852 until 1890, the LDS Church openly authorized polygamous marriages between one man and multiple wives, though polygamous families continued cohabitating into the 1940s and 1950s. Today, the church is opposed to such marriages and excommunicates members who participate in them or publicly teach that they are sanctioned by God. The LDS Church also opposes the legalization of same-sex marriage.\n\nA spouse is the only person other than the Lord that Latter-day Saints are commanded to love \"with all [their] heart\". A revelation in the Doctrine and Covenants states: \"Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else.\" Church leaders have taught that this commandment applies equally to wives loving their husbands.\n\nThe LDS Church also teaches that marriage is a partnership of equals, and that partners should be thoughtful, respectful, and loyal to one another. The church teaches that if couples keep their lives centered on Jesus Christ, their love will grow. Regarding marriage and divorce, the church instructs its leaders: \"No priesthood officer is to counsel a person whom to marry. Nor should he counsel a person to divorce his or her spouse. Those decisions must originate and remain with the individual. When a marriage ends in divorce, or if a husband and wife separate, they should always receive counseling from Church leaders.\"\n\nCelestial (or eternal) marriage is an ordinance performed by priesthood authority in a temple of the church. A celestial marriage is thought to continue forever into the afterlife if the man and woman do not break their covenants. Thus, eternally married couples are often referred to as being \"sealed\" to each other. Sealed couples who keep their covenants are also promised to have their posterity sealed to them in the afterlife.\n\nThe LDS Church teaches that a celestial marriage is required for exaltation. This teaching is based on Mormon scripture, in which Joseph Smith taught, “In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees; and in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage]; and if he does not, he cannot obtain it. He may enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot have an increase”. Exaltation is also known as \"eternal life\" and is defined as \"the kind of life God lives\". Those who are exalted will \"live eternally in the presence of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ[;] will become gods[;] will be united eternally with their righteous family members and will be able to have eternal increase [spirit children][; and] will have everything that our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have—all power, glory, dominion, and knowledge\". Members of the LDS Church are encouraged to prepare to be celestially married in a temple.\n\nIt is believed, therefore, that all humans are spirit children of \"heavenly parents\" who as mortals were celestially married and went on to become exalted. This married couple is known to Latter-day Saints as God the Father and Heavenly Mother. Because of the beliefs that (1) celestial marriage is required for exaltation, and (2) that Jesus is exalted, some leaders of the LDS Church have hypothesized that Jesus must have been married, possibly to Mary Magdalene, Mary, sister of Lazarus, and/or Martha.\n\nBecause it is a requirement for exaltation, celestial marriages are performed vicariously in church temples for deceased couples who were legally married.\n\nIn some legal jurisdictions, celestial marriages can be recognized as civil marriages; in other cases, couples are civilly married outside of the temple and are later sealed in a celestial marriage. The church will no longer perform a celestial marriage on a couple unless they are first (or simultaneously) legally married.\n\nA celestial marriage is not annulled by a civil divorce: a \"cancellation of a sealing\" may be granted, but only by the First Presidency, the highest authority in the church. Civil divorce and marriage outside the temple carry with them a stigma in Mormon culture; the church teaches that the \"gospel of Jesus Christ—including repentance, forgiveness, integrity, and love—provides the remedy for conflict in marriage.\n\nUntil 1890, the LDS Church openly sanctioned plural marriage, which was the practice of marrying a man celestially to multiple women. Such polygamous marriages were celestial marriages only, not legal civil marriages. Today, the church is opposed to such marriages and excommunicates members who participate in them, whether or not polygamy is legal in the jurisdiction in question. The church teaches that “the standard doctrine of the church is monogamy\" and that polygamy was a temporary exception to the rule. Early church leaders taught that God the Father and Jesus Christ both practiced polygamy in defense of the practice, a belief widely accepted among Mormons by the late-1850s.\n\nIn the past, LDS Church leaders have consistently opposed marriage between different ethnicities with the apostle Boyd Packer publicly stating in 1977 that \"We've always counseled in the Church for ... our Caucasians to marry Caucasians ... The counsel has been wise.\" Nearly every decade beginning with the church's formation until the '70s has seen some denunciation against miscegenation, with most focusing on black-white marriage. These church leaders' views stem from racist \"biological and social\" principles. One exception was intermarriage with Native Americans, who Mormons believed to be Lamanites, a race descended from ancient Israelites. Intermarriage with Native Americans was actually encouraged as a way to fulfill a Book of Mormon prophecy that the Lamanites would become white and delightsome. \n\nChurch publications have also contained statements discouraging interracial marriage. In the same June 1978 issue announcing that black members were now eligible for temple rites, missionary service, and priesthood ordination, the official newspaper of the LDS Church, printed an article entitled \"Interracial marriage discouraged\". The same day a church spokesman stated \"interracial marriages generally have been discouraged in the past, ... that remains our position\" and that \"the Church does not prohibit ... interracial marriages but it does discourage them.\"\n\nIn 2003 author Jon Krakauer's stated that \"official LDS policy has continued to strongly admonish white saints not to marry blacks\" in his \"Under the Banner of Heaven\". In response the church newsroom released a statement from BYU Dean of Religious Education Robert Millet that \"There is, in fact, no mention whatsoever in [the church] handbook concerning interracial marriages. In addition, having served as a Church leader for almost 30 years, I can also certify that I have never received official verbal instructions condemning marriages between black and white members.\" Though, denying any condemnation of interracial marriage, there was no comment on whether it was still discouraged, however.\n\nThe discouragement of marriage between those of different ethnicities by church leaders continued being taught to youth during Sunday meetings until 2013 when the use of the 1996 version of the church Sunday meeting manual for adolescent boys was discontinued. The manual had used a 1976 quote from past church president Spencer Kimball that said, \"We recommend that people marry those who are of the same racial background generally\". The quote is still in use, however, in the 2003 institute Eternal Marriage Student Manual.\n\nIn 2008 the American Religious Identification Survey reported: \"Mormons have the highest proportions of currently married adults, and lowest divorce rates reflecting the emphasis on family values in this tradition ... Commitment to 'traditional or normative family values' is measured by creating a combined index of the proportions divorced and cohabiting, whereby those traditions that score lowest are the most familial. The tradition with the lowest percentages on this index are Mormons (11%)\".\n\n"}

{"id": "30965055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30965055", "title": "N. D. Cocea", "text": "N. D. Cocea\n\nN. D. Cocea (common rendition of Nicolae Dumitru Cocea, , also known as Niculae, Niculici or Nicu Cocea; November 29, 1880 – February 1, 1949) was a Romanian journalist, novelist, critic and left-wing political activist, known as a major but controversial figure in the field of political satire. The founder of many newspapers and magazines, including \"Viața Socială\", \"Rampa\", \"Facla\" and \"Chemarea\", collaborating with writer friends such as Tudor Arghezi, Gala Galaction and Ion Vinea, he fostered and directed the development of early modernist literature in Romania. Cocea later made his name as a republican and anticlerical agitator, was arrested as an instigator during the 1907 peasant revolt, and played a leading role in regrouping the scattered socialist clubs. His allegiances however switched between parties: during World War I, he supported the Entente Powers and, as a personal witness of the October Revolution, the government of Soviet Russia, before returning home as a communist.\n\nDuring the interwar period, Cocea was elected to Romanian Parliament as an independent socialist, campaigned for the outlawed Romanian Communist Party, and found his press banned by the authorities on several occasions. In 1923, he was found guilty of \"lèse majesté\". Cocea, although kept under constant surveillance, was rumored to have been an opportunistic double dealer, and his personal life was a matter of public scandal. His novels, the vast majority of which are samples of erotic literature, fueled innuendo about his sexual exploits, which also resulted in his sentencing for statutory rape. After World War II, Cocea was again close to the Communist Party and, from 1948, rose to prominence as an official writer for the communist regime.\n\nFor a while the son-in-law of journalist Constantin Mille, N. D. Cocea was from a theatrical family: his daughters Dina and Tantzi, like his sister Alice before them, were acclaimed actresses. Another daughter, Ioana-Maria Cocea, is a noted sculptor.\n\nBorn in Bârlad, Cocea claimed lineage from the lesser boyar aristocracy of Moldavia. His father, Dumitru Cocea, was a Romanian Land Forces officer, who would reach the rank of General. The Coceas descended from an 18th-century Albanian Moldavian \"Serdar\" Gheorghe Cocea, but claimed lineage from a 16th-century soldier in the armies of Michael the Brave. Nicolae's mother, Cleopatra, was a published author and a journalist. She hailed from a family of yeomen (\"răzeși\") or landowners, and her artistic education helped shape his cultural tastes from early childhood. Although he made his name as a writer and journalist, his most ardent wish was to become an actor.\n\nNicolae attended primary school in his native town, and had a hectic adolescence, determined by his father's successive postings. He is known to have first been enlisted at the National High School of Iași. During the late 1890s, young Cocea was in Bucharest, attending the Saint Sava National College, becoming close friends with two other students and future writers: one was Galaction, the other was Vasile Demetrius. Another Saint Sava student, Ion G. Duca (the Prime Minister of Romania in 1933), was occasionally present among them, but political differences drew them apart with time. Despite oral tradition, Arghezi, who joined the Cocea group around the same time, may not have been a Saint Sava student at all: according to literary historian C. Popescu-Cadem, there is no record of him ever attending that institution. Cocea's own education was vague. He flunked out after the 3rd and 7th grades, was transferred to Ploiești, then returned to Saint Sava only to pass reexamination.\n\nCocea and his Saint Sava friends were already leftists who attended the public lectures of senior socialist leader Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea. According to literary historian Tudor Vianu, the four youths, including the \"restless, daring and ingenious\" Cocea, were mounting an independent protest against \"bourgeois\" values. They literary taste favored Symbolism, Parnassianism and literary naturalism, which they saw as modern shields against traditionalist culture. Inspired by the works of Charles Baudelaire, they soon joined efforts with the Romanian Symbolist movement. All members of the group visited with the Symbolist doyen Alexandru Macedonski, although Cocea the writer was first discovered by Symbolist academic Ovid Densusianu and his \"Vieața Nouă\" review.\n\nAs his personal note, Cocea rebelled against paternal and institutional authority. Under the pen name \"Nely\", he published the defiantly erotic novel \"Poet-Poetă\" (1898, with a preface by Galaction), that resulted in his near-definitive expulsion from public high school. Around the same time, Galaction married Cocea's cousin Zoe Marcou, a laicized Romanian Orthodox nun; she would inspire him to become an Orthodox priest.\n\nAround 1900, Cocea, who had already graduated in Romanian Law, was in France, undergoing specialization at the University of Paris. At this stage in life, he was probably acquainted with the French roots of Romanian radical liberalism, which infused his left-wing outlook. A sympathizer of the Dreyfusards, he was also becoming interested in the various projects to transform the Kingdom of Romania into a republic, in marked contrast to his father's ardent monarchism. He witnessed first-hand the progress of trade unionism in France, and had personal interviews with writer Anatole France and sculptor Auguste Rodin. The family's French connections were preserved by the writer's siblings. Cocea's sister Alice, the future comedian, was born in Sinaia, where Dumitru Cocea was stationed in 1899, and also settled in France at a later date. She was joined there by Cocea's younger sister, Florica.\n\nUpon his return to Romania, Cocea was for a while employed as justice of the peace, but was later virtually inactive as a lawyer. Instead, he began frequenting the Romanian socialist milieu. He was at the time married to Florica Mille, daughter of Constantin Mille. Her father was founder of \"Adevărul\" daily and co-founder of the Social-Democratic Workers' Party (PSDMR). This was another break with the Cocea family tradition: allegedly, General Dumitru Cocea had once ordered his troops to devastate the \"Adevărul\" offices.\n\nFlorica was born from Mille's first marriage, which ended in divorce, and had a sister, Margareta, married into the Messerschmitt family of German industrialists. Through Mille, Cocea became related to another Moldavian boyar family, the Tăutus. Cocea's marriage, which resulted in the 1912 birth of Dina Cocea, was troubled and ended in divorce.\n\nLike some of the veteran socialists (Garabet Ibrăileanu, Henric Sanielevici, the \"România Muncitoare\" group), the young journalist made repeated attempts to revive and reunite the socialist clubs, left in disarray by the 1899 dissolution of the PSDMR. Cocea, with Arghezi, Demetrius and Galaction, stood out for marrying this political ideal with the artistic credo of Symbolism. This unusual vision was preserved in the magazine the three published together during 1904, \"Linia Dreaptă\" (\"The Straight Line\"). In 1905, Arghezi left for Switzerland and entrusted Cocea with his collection of rare books. Cocea is said to have lost it, an event which marked the first of several disagreements between them.\n\nWith the March 1907 peasant uprising, N. D. Cocea's profile in political journalism was boosted. He is the probable source of a much circulated canard, taken up by \"Adevărul\", according to which Romanian authorities had killed 11,000 or more peasant insurgents. Cocea himself eventually settled for a death toll of 12,000, claiming that, \"had the peasants' bodies been lined up and down on Calea Victoriei\", Romanian King Carol I of Hohenzollern could have walked over to Dealul Mitropoliei \"on a soft rug of peasant flesh\".\n\nDuring the actual events, N. D. Cocea was mainly active on the lower course of the Danube, recognized by other socialists as \"one of the leaders of the [workers'] movement\" in Brăila. His regional daily, \"Dezrobirea\" (\"The Emancipation\"), was probably paid for by a local banker, Alphonse (or Alfons) Nachtigal. Drawing official suspicion as a republican paper, it became noted for fueling revolt regionally. After the \"România Muncitoare\" circle organized a socialist rally in Brăila, \"Dezrobirea\"s entire staff was arrested on orders from Prefect Nicolae T. Faranga, who also confiscated most of the printed issues (although some 1,000 were still freely distributed among the intrigued peasants). Cocea was eventually tried as an instigator, and sentenced to a term in prison.\n\nUpon his release, Cocea moved back to Bucharest, where he became a socialist orator, a \"România Muncitoare\" editor, and a correspondent of the workers' journal \"Viitorul Social\". He was one of the Romanian delegates to the International Socialist Congress, hosted by the Second International in Stuttgart. It was there that Russian socialist opinion leader Vladimir Lenin publicized a thesis according to which the Romanian revolt and the Russian Revolution of 1905 were similar, in both character and impact. Back in Romania, Cocea was resuming his contacts with Dobrogeanu-Gherea, who was by then all but withdrawn from active socialist politics. As Cocea later wrote, the veteran leader confessed to him that he was being brought down by acute insomnia.\n\nThe young activist was blending his socialism with a critic's interest in modern art and experimental literature. Literary historian Paul Cernat argues that, like Symbolist poet N. Davidescu, Cocea spent the 1900-1920 period disseminating modernist literature \"on all fronts\". He made his name as an art critic by 1908, when, like Arghezi, he defended the Romanian post-Impressionist art club, whose members were being marginalized by the \"Tinerimea Artistică\" society; he also saluted Iosif Iser's international post-Impressionist exhibit. Within a series of articles in \"Pagini Libere\" journal, Cocea also explained his divorce with Symbolism and Art Nouveau, concluding that they represented \"the cosmopolitan class of sloth and of universal parasitism\". The following year, Cocea was assigned the art column of \"Noua Revistă Română\", an eclectic journal put out by Romanian thinker Constantin Rădulescu-Motru. While there, he militated in favor of modernized art, urging artists to destroy \"antiquated artistic formulas\" and to subvert \"the laws of nature\".\n\nAccording to Cocea's future friend and foe Pamfil Șeicaru, 1910 was the time year Cocea, with Christian Rakovsky, Ecaterina Arbore, I. C. Frimu and Ilie Moscovici, was in the \"chief of staff\" of the newly created Social Democratic Party of Romania. Cocea was additionally a member of the party's Social Studies Circle, furnishing its library and organizing its Kalinderu Church offices.\n\nIn February 1910, Cocea and Arghezi set up a new periodical, \"Viața Socială\". The magazine, which received contributions from Dobrogeanu-Gherea, militated for universal suffrage, social equality and land reform, while informing readers about world socialism. It enlisted collaborations from a number of anti-establishment journalists, from agrarian militant Vasile Kogălniceanu and socialist physician Tatiana Grigorovici to writers Ion Minulescu, Lucia Demetrius or Constantin Graur, and republished contributions from some of Europe's known social critics: Eduard Bernstein, Rinaldo Rigola, Vsevolod Garshin, Leo Tolstoy, Jean Jaurès, Emile Vandervelde, Hubert Lagardelle and Gustave Hervé. Other contributors were Arbore, Davidescu, V. Demetrius, Traian Demetrescu, Sofia Nădejde, Vasile Savel and Avram Steuerman-Rodion.\n\nCulturally, this moment saw Cocea and his friends coordinating the transition from Symbolism to the early 20th-century avant-garde. This move was also accelerated by art critic Theodor Cornel, who was for while a staff writer for Cocea's publication. In his first \"Viața Socială\" editorial, Cocea himself deemed Arghezi \"the most revolutionary poet\" of the period. However, his unilateral decision to publish Arghezi's \"Evening Prayer\", as an example of poetic rebellion, greatly enraged the expatriated author. They resumed their friendship only after Arghezi returned from his Swiss sojourn, and Cocea, with Galaction, Dumitru Karnabatt and various others, frequented the salon formed in Arghezi's Bucharest home. Cocea was also witness when Arghezi wedded his long-term lover, Constanța Zissu (December 1912); the register describes him as \"a journalist by profession, living at Polonă Street, 1.\"\n\nThrough Galaction's interventions, \"Viața Socială\" maintained links with the more mainstream and home-grown current on Romania's leftist scene, Poporanism, as well as with the post-socialist magazine of Iași, \"Viața Românească\". It also published several poems by the young Poporanist George Topîrceanu. Also in Iași, the \"Viața Socială\" circle acquired a number of young disciples, involved in editing \"Fronda\" and \"Absolutio\" magazines: Isac Ludo, Eugen Relgis etc.\n\nStill, traditionalist critic Ilarie Chendi notes, \"Viața Socială\" as a whole failed, because the Symbolist and post-Symbolist contributors were not ardent socialists, and because no \"notable poets or prose writers\" could be found among the socialists. The same was observed in 1913 by critic Gheorghe Savul, who suggested that \"Viața Socială\" took on Symbolists such as Davidescu for opportunistic reasons, since they also had an anti-bourgeois axe to grind, but that there was little else to unite its contributors.\n\nCocea was by then frequenting the anarchist boyar Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești, an art patron, cultural innovator and personal friend of Arghezi. In 1911, he visited Italy together with Lagardelle, the French Syndicalist militant, and personally met with liberal theorists Benedetto Croce and Guglielmo Ferrero, as well as with Syndicalist Arturo Labriola and fellow journalist Giuseppe Prezzolini. His travel account, which includes essays on art and civilization, was published the same year, as \"Spre Roma\" (\"Toward Rome\").\n\nBack in Romania, Cocea launched \"Rampa\", a theatrical review originally published as a daily. His partner in this venture was a veteran of thetrical life, Alexandru Davila. Cocea also set up the independent socialist newspaper \"Facla\". The latter, identified as Romania's first socialist and satirical magazine by Arghezi himself, was soon joined by the 18-year-old poet Ion Vinea, as literary columnist and campaigner for post-Symbolist literature, with painters Iser and Camil Ressu as illustrators. The other noted contributors to Cocea's publications were Toma Dragu, Saniel Grossman, George Diamandy, Camil Petrescu and avant-garde critic Poldi Chapier, whose 1912 article for \"Rampa\" chronicled the international success of Futurism. Also featured were poems and translations by the post-Symbolist H. Bonciu. Cocea's own contributions include the chronicle of a play by Henry Bataille and a salute to the \"invincible spirit\" of the Portuguese republican revolution.\n\nAlongside renewed attacks on Romania's cultural traditionalism, Cocea and Arghezi initiated a lengthy campaign in favor of universal suffrage. Their articles and headlines were often sensationalist and provoking, again focusing on Carol I, Romania's aging King. They often referred to the monarch as \"Ploșnița\" (\"The Tick\"), \"Gheșeftarul\" (\"The Shop-Keeper\") or \"Neamțul\" (\"The Kraut\"). \"Facla\", with media support from \"Adevărul\" and the Romanian anarchist milieus, was taunting the authorities by staging its own mock trial for \"lèse majesté\". \"Facla\"s anticlericalism, specifically aimed at the Orthodox Church, formed part of a larger scandal, which had earlier seen Arghezi giving up his hierodeacon's frock. The ardent antimilitarism of Cocea's \"Facla\" articles, in particular his mockery of General Grigore C. Crăiniceanu and his sons, had similar results: the journalist was handed a preemptive and dishonorable military discharge.\n\nCulturally, \"Facla\" was a leading adversary of traditionalist literature and of the nationalist periodicals which supported it. Its attack was concentrated on \"Drum Drept\" and \"Convorbiri Critice\" magazines (the focus of Vinea's articles) and on antisemitic historian Nicolae Iorga, who had earlier dismissed \"Facla\" as a venue for Jewish Romanian interests. \"Facla\" also inaugurated the conflict between Cocea and the \"Viața Românească\" Poporanists. As a socialist, Cocea attacked the Poporanists for supporting artistic nationalism, and then for courting the mainstream National Liberal Party.\n\nCocea unsuccessfully presented himself as a Social Democratic candidate in the elections of 1912, the first ones in Romania to be contested by an independent socialist party. However, he soon broke off from the party, and came to be considered a representative of the \"bourgeois press\" by his former socialist colleagues. One of them, Constantin Titel Petrescu, informs that Cocea \"could not live by the party discipline\".\n\nAt an early stage in World War I, public opinion in neutral Romania was divided between the Entente Powers and the Central Powers, both of which held Romanian irredenta. In this context, the Francophile Cocea manifested himself as an outspoken partisan of Romania's alliance with the Entente. There followed a split between Cocea and his erstwhile partners Arghezi, Galaction and Bogdan-Pitești. The latter three were committed Germanophiles who proceeded to publish their own review, \"Cronica\". \"Chemarea\", a mainly political magazine published by Ion Vinea in 1915, stood between the two groups, but was probably managed by Cocea, who allegedly came up with its name (lit. \"the calling\"). Cocea's friendship with Arghezi had again soured to the point of mutual hatred. In \"Facla\", Cocea made thinly veiled comments about the poet's mother, an unmarried woman, and suggested that the \"Cronica\" staff \"still lives on the morsels left over from Bogdan-Pitești's feasts\".\n\nWhen the 1916-1917 Campaign turned into a defensive war, N. D. Cocea joined the government and Land Forces on their retreat to Western Moldavia. Reunited with Vinea, he helped publish a daily named \"Deșteptarea\" (\"The Awakening\"), flirting with the Germanophiles and Zimmerwald neutralists, hotly criticizing the Ententist and National Liberal establishment. However, he remained an outspoken critic of those public figures whom he perceived as German hirelings, including politician Alexandru Marghiloman and \"Arena\" newspaperman Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo. As was later acknowledged by Vinea, Cocea and his \"Deșteptarea\" colleagues had formed a conspiratorial \"revolutionary republican committee\". Both of them were also affiliated with a wing of the Romanian Freemasonry.\n\nA while after, Cocea made his way in the Russian Republic, Romania's Entente ally, and settled in Petrograd. His activities there included putting out the French-language magazine, \"L'Entente\" (\"The Entente\"), which was financed by his old rivals, the Romanian National Liberals. As a resident of Hotel Astoria, he witnessed first-hand the October Revolution, and became a passionate supporter of the Bolshevik cause. He later claimed to have been present, on Revolution day, in the Petrograd Soviet hall, hearing the victorious speech of Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin, and to have later attended the second All-Russian Congress of Soviets. As a representative of the International Association for Information of the Labor Press of America, France, and Great Britain, Cocea exchanged notes with Lenin. He interviewed Lenin about the Bolsheviks' goals, assuring him that his replies would be published verbatim.\n\nBy the end of the year, Cocea had returned to Moldavia. Under his direction (December 1917 to February 1918), \"Deșteptarea\" became a new edition of \"Chemarea\". It was often issued with large blank spaces, showing interventions by military censors. The gazette managed to publish a letter of protest, signed by poet Benjamin Fondane, expressing a hope that Arghezi would not be prosecuted as a traitor. After advertising its \"radical socialist\" agenda, \"Chemarea\" was promptly shut down by the Alexandru Averescu cabinet. For this and other reasons, Cocea would later refer to Averescu as the organizer of \"White Terror\" in Romania.\n\nCocea was a strong critic of Romania's separate armistice with Germany, and consequently listed as a \"persona non grata\" by the Central Powers. In August 1918, he launched \"Depeșa\" (\"The Dispatch\"), later published as a third edition of \"Chemarea\". A new presence on these two periodicals was writer Jacques G. Costin, who produced several political pieces (including a renewed denunciation of Hefter-Hidalgo) and later the musical chronicle. Its other staff writers were young men who later built career in the political press, both left- and right-wing: Vinea, Demostene Botez, Alexandru Busuioceanu, Cezar Petrescu, Pamfil Șeicaru and Adrian Maniu. They took care of the newspaper when Cocea left Iași on a short visit to Bessarabia, a former Russian province that was in the process of uniting with Romania.\n\nVictorious in its lengthy conflict with Hefter's \"Arena\", \"Chemarea\" eventually relocated to Bucharest, but suffered from the nationwide paper shortage. Cocea supported the Socialist Party of Romania (PS) through the leftist riots of December 1918, and, when the PS leadership was arrested, sat on the defense team, alongside Mille and Dragu.\n\n\"Chemarea\" survived until November 1, 1919—when its lampoon of Romanian King Ferdinand I prompted the intervention of military censors. On November 2, shortly before the general election day, Cocea profited from the temporary suspension of censorship to reissue the same paper, subsequently renamed \"Chemarea Roșie\" (\"The Red Call\"), then \"Facla\", \"Torța\" (\"The Torch\"), \"Clopotul\" (\"The Bell\") and again \"Chemarea\" (changes which were supposed to keep censors always a step behind Cocea). These publications were attempts to revive and radicalize the socialist literary press, that had virtually succumbed in Romania after the demise of \"Facla\"s first edition. A Marxist literary critic, Ovid Crohmălniceanu, proposes that Cocea's renewed offensive missed the mark, lacking \"a clear enough vision\".\n\nCocea was elected to the Lower Chamber during the November 1919 suffrage (reelected during the May 1920 suffrage). He represented a non-partisan electoral list for Bucharest (the Citizen's List), whose other two candidates, physician Nicolae L. Lupu and lawyer Constantin Costa-Foru, also won seats. Although officially an independent, he rallied with the PS in the Chamber minority group led by Gheorghe Cristescu and Ilie Moscovici. Cocea's mandate was immediately contested by his National Liberal adversaries. They sought to invalidate his candidature, citing a law which prevented those with a military discharge from running in elections. The National Liberal motion was however defeated when Cocea, who presented himself as a political victim, earned unexpected support from the Romanian National Party and the Democratic Nationalist Party.\n\nIn opposition to the People's Party and the anti-communist consensus, Cocea spoke positively in Parliament about Soviet Russia, arguing that the Bolshevik foreign policy had saved the whole of civilization, and citing favorable statements made by the returning war prisoners. His theory was that the Comintern was a legitimate successor of the First International. The notion was contested by another socialist deputy, Dragu—early signs of a schism between the Cominternist socialist-communists and those who followed the Vienna International. In one of his addresses to the Chamber (July 28, 1920), Cocea presented a vision of socialism that was neither \"unilateral\" nor \"narrow\", but suited to the needs of \"all peoples and all times\", and quoted from \"The Internationale\". Cocea's rhetoric, equating the October Revolution with the birth of Christ and glorifying the Slavic soul, was ridiculed from the benches as \"Russian mysticism\".\n\nFor a while, Cocea's sympathy turned toward the rising Peasants' Party. This Poporanist group, which reacted against National Liberal politics and sought peace with the socialists and the Soviets, was called \"civilized and Westernized\" by the socialist journalist. Nevertheless, Cocea was becoming disappointed by the parliamentary system of Greater Romania. He argued that Parliament itself should be replaced with a technocratic body, elected by a radical form of universal suffrage, and clamored his belief that \"in short while, [...] Romania will be socialist.\"\n\nIn August 1920, Cocea voted in favor of Grigore Trancu-Iași's labor law, although he found it unsatisfactory—his stated belief was that the law's inequities would spark a \"social revolution\". There followed the October 1920 general strike, that was condoned and supported by Cocea and the writers at \"Chemarea\". During December, following a state of siege, Cocea and Lupu were behind parliamentary efforts to investigate the alleged murder of socialist activist Herșcu Aroneanu by People's Party authorities.\n\nWhen, in early 1921, Cristescu and the other socialist-communists set up the Romanian Communist Party (PCR), Cocea became an outside sympathizer of their cause, protesting against their imprisonment and prosecution in the Dealul Spirii Trial. In May and June of that year, when Chamber was assessing the case of Moscovici's seat, left vacant by his sentencing after the strike, Cocea asked for it to be filled by Constantin Popovici; Popovici, next on the electoral list, was himself under arrest. His speech about \"government terror\" ended in a heated dispute with People's Party deputies Berlescu (whom Cocea called a descendant of Romani slaves) and Alexandru Oteteleșeanu. Shortly before the 1921 suffrage, Cocea labeled Conservative-Democratic leader Take Ionescu, the Prime Minister-designate, as a pawn of King Ferdinand and his \"camarilla\". Early in 1922, Cocea also joined Dem. I. Dobrescu and other lawyers on the Dealul Spirii Trial defense team.\n\nIn 1920, \"Chemarea\" came to its end, and Cocea began putting out another edition of \"Facla\" weekly. The newspaper acquired offices in the Frascatti Hotel (later the \"Savoy\" branch of Constantin Tănase Revue Theater), redecorated by artist Marcel Janco. According to political scientist Stelian Tănase, this enterprise was secretly financed by Soviet Russia as external agitprop: notes kept by \"Siguranța Statului\" intelligence agency suggest that Cocea was a regular guest at the Russian mission in Romania.\n\nCocea's disciple, Ion Vinea, went on to publish the magazine \"Contimporanul\", originally as a socialist tribune, but later as a modernist forum. Cocea was an occasional contributor to this venue, but was separated from its avant-garde staff writers, having a less rebellious writing style and a more structured political vision. In exchange, Vinea was an occasional contributor to \"Facla\", whenever \"Contimporanul\" met financial difficulties; he was also the editorial director from 1925 to 1926 (the year when \"Facla\" again closed down). Vinea's own political articles were noted for their critique of National Liberal policies, portraying liberal Romania as a Brătianu family dictatorship and campaigning in favor of the socialist groups. Around 1924, the \"Facla\" group was also joined by \"Red Prince\" Scarlat Callimachi, a modernist promoter and communist militant, by aspiring critic Șerban Cioculescu, and by the Zionist opinion maker A. A. Luca. Cocea was at the time the animator of cultural debates at Terasa Oteteleșanu, where he introduced the young novelist and journalist I. Peltz.\n\nThe early 1920s also witnessed N. D. Cocea's involvement in various other civic and cultural campaigns. He became, in 1922, a member of the Romanian Friends of Nature, a socialist-inspired environmental organization, and, the following year, joined Dem I. Dobrescu in creating the League for Human Rights. He was among the regular guests at International Red Aid \"literary tea parties\", described by historian Adrian Cioroianu as \"one of those schemes the communists employed in collecting money for their comrades in prison\". With Fondane, director Armand Pascal and various others, Cocea also participated in creating \"Insula\", an actors' working group. It was supposed to revolutionize Romanian theater, but disappeared after only a few months of existence (February 1923). Cocea compensated by giving moral support to the Jewish modernist Vilna Troupe, which relocated to Bucharest in 1924. Also that year Cocea published a new book, \"Ignoranță\" (\"Ignorance\").\n\nAfter the adoption by a National Liberal legislature of Romania's 1923 Constitution, Cocea joined up with the angrier ranks of political opposition. He soon publicized a claim that King Ferdinand and his favorite minister, Brătianu, had together given legal foundations to a plutocracy. He was taken to court and lost, being sentenced for \"lèse majesté\". Reputedly, the authorities also confiscated samples of Cocea's anticlerical fiction works, but these were recovered and published by \"Contimporanul\" in 1925. Through the voice of Vinea, \"Contimporanul\" also protested the sentencing, claiming that Cocea was a persecuted man, his career \"a spectacle of modern dramatism\". The trial attracted significant attention among the Romanian youth, which divided itself into monarchists and republicans.\n\nCocea's conduct was the topic of controversy throughout the early 1920s: in 1922, Cocea's influential modernist rival, the literary theorist Eugen Lovinescu, bitterly attacked him, Arghezi and Bogdan-Pitești for their wartime conduct. Noted for its xenophobic attacks on \"Contimporanul\"s editors, the nationalist review \"Țara Noastră\" openly celebrated Cocea's arrest. An unsigned note in that paper announced that Cocea had been imprisoned \"for the least of his crimes\", and called to mind that Cocea had been lampooning its editor, Octavian Goga. The antisemitic publicist Alexandru Hodoș designated Cocea's supporters at \"Adevărul\" and \"Cuvântul Liber\" with the title of \"Shabbos goyim\", describing Cocea as a habitual prankster, a renegade of the socialist cause, and a dishonorable man.\n\nCocea served his sentence of one year and a half at Craiova penitentiary, and paid the 10,000 lei fine. He was afterward involved in communist agitation, speaking at PCR rallies in Câmpina (1925), Soroca and Otaci (during the 1931 electoral campaign). The PCR underground's leaders were often Cocea's guests at Frascatti. His modernist supporters did not follow his lead. By 1929, Vinea and \"Contimporanul\" were toning down their own socialist agenda, cooperating instead with the moderate National Peasants' Party, and even drawing suspicion from the left that they had become sympathetic to fascism. Generally a critic of the National Peasantists, Cocea quit a resurfacing \"Facla\" in 1930, leaving Vinea in charge (the latter was editor of that newspaper until its 1940 disestablishment).\n\nOver the next few years, N. D. Cocea is believed to have been largely inactive in the political press. Instead, he made his return to fiction. In 1931, his novel \"Vinul de viață lungă\" (\"The Wine of a Long Life\") was released under contract with Editura Cultura Națională. Its received much acclaim, unmatched by Cocea's later works in the genre, which critics often found unpalatable for their erotic content. Cocea's erotic series includes: \"Fecior de slugă\" (\"The Son of the Servant\"), published in 1933 by Cultura Națională; \"Pentr-un petec de negreață\" (\"Over a Black Patch\", also known as \"Andrei Vaia\"), 1934, Alcaly Publishers; and \"Nea Nae\" (\"Uncle Nae\"), 1935, Alcaly.\n\nDuring that interval, Cocea was again brought into custody. He was tried and imprisoned for statutory rape, having eloped with the 16-year-old Gina, orphaned daughter of the wealthy National Liberal politico Ion Manolescu-Strunga. The liberties he took in public life, and the provoking nature of his writings, resulted in other disputes with the nationalists, forming part of their larger conservative crusade against \"pornography\" and the avant-garde. The traditionalist periodical \"Neamul Românesc\", put out by Nicolae Iorga, had \"Cocea Niculae\" on its blacklist, as the third most offensive Romanian author (the avant-garde authors H. Bonciu and Geo Bogza were at No. 1 and No. 2 respectively). In parallel, Cocea was becoming involved in a publicized controversy with his wartime colleague Pamfil Șeicaru. As commentators have since noted, the two journalists were equally vulgar, but Șeicaru had been enlisted by the nationalists and the traditionalists.\n\nIn 1934, Cocea joined a group known as \"Amicii URSS\", formed on the basis of a PCR initiative and formally seeking to normalize Romania's relations with the Soviet Union. In November of that year, \"Siguranța Statului\" was reporting that Cocea and Callimachi, together with Petre Constantinescu-Iași, were going to establish in Bucharest a \"far left platform\" with a \"pronounced Semitic tendency\"; known as \"Ideea Socială\" (\"The Social Idea\"), it was supposedly part of the \"Adevărul\"-\"Dimineața\" network. The period also brought Cocea's brief and uneventful marriage with Lila Stănescu. She was in reality the lover of PCR activist Ion Gheorghe Maurer, whom the journalist continued to view as his friend.\n\nIn 1936, the year when he married his long-time lover Gina Manolescu-Strunga, Cocea again returned to the forefront of Romania's left-wing press, launching the theoretical magazine \"Era Nouă\" (\"New Era\"). Also a front for the PCR, replacing the banned \"Bluze Albastre\" of communist writer Alexandru Sahia, \"Era Nouă\" was itself shut down by the authorities in 1937. It had published only two issues. In one of its internal memos, \"Siguranța Statului\" reviewed the first of these as inoffensively \"academic\", the second as \"agitatorial\". \"Siguranța\" agents also noted that Cocea, with Dobrescu and Callimachi, was making efforts to assist the PCR activists tried in Chișinău, and trying to obtain further support from the left-wing National Peasantists (Virgil Madgearu, Grigore Iunian).\n\n\"Era Nouă\"s main contributors were young communist essayists such as Sahia, Miron Radu Paraschivescu, Ștefan Voicu and Silvian Iosifescu, but the magazine also published avant-garde authors with Marxist sensibilities: Ion Călugăru, Stephan Roll, Virgil Teodorescu, Dolfi Trost and Paul Păun. They were joined by communist polemicists Ghiță Ionescu and Belu Zilber. In its first issue, \"Era Nouă\" prophesied that the general crisis of capitalism was evident in the rapid decay of \"its culture and ideology\", leaving the proletariat in a position to reinterpret mainstream culture \"on the large basis offered by dialectical materialism\". According to cultural historian Zigu Ornea, such pronouncements, soon taken up by the entire communist press, were in reality a form of left-wing totalitarianism, and therefore equivalent to the internal logic of fascism.\n\nCocea was reputedly pondering the relaunch of \"Chemarea\" as a communist newspaper, supposedly with Ștefan Foriș, the ex-convict head of PCR Agitprop, as its manager, and Paraschivescu, Voicu, as well as other Communist Youth activists, as co-editors. \"Siguranța\" men had it that Cocea shocked his communist partners by informing them that \"Chemarea\" was to be a \"centrist\" platform, with no known communist on its staff. However, the senior socialist remained active in proximity to the PCR over the next year. In May 1937, he caught \"Siguranța\"s attention as a would-be collaborator to Callimachi's anti-fascist review \"Munca\" (\"The Labor\"). Making overtures toward the National Peasantist left-wingers, \"Munca\" also received contributions from poets Mihail Cruceanu and Sandu Tudor, from sociologist Mihai Ralea and journalist Tudor Teodorescu-Braniște, and from writer-director Sandu Eliad. In summer 1937, the moderate left-wing \"Azi\" daily published Cocea's renewed criticism of censorship, part of a series of a collective reply to the far right's moralistic discourse.\n\nCocea was again mandated by the PCR to lead \"Reporter\" weekly, beginning with its November 1937 issue. The periodical, already in existence for five years, was making efforts to reach the apolitical public. In an editorial for \"Reporter\", Cocea made comments similar to the \"Era Nouă\" program, with a more pronounced satirical tone and allusions to fascism: \"however massive the stupidity of dictatorial rules, man's intelligence, honesty in convictions [and] the fervor of the masses will in the end topple them. [...] The greedy satraps, the leeward adventurers have come to tumble down, one on top of the other.\"\n\n\"Reporter\"s agenda was generically anti-fascist: campaigning for the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War, it lampooned Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, and repeatedly attacked the Iron Guard or other Romanian fascist groups. Its political panelists included, alongside Voicu, Paraschivescu and Călugăru, the future communist historian Ion Popescu-Puțuri, reporter Aurel Baranga, and anti-fascist poet Gherasim Luca. Other members of the \"Reporter\" circle, whose contacts with Cocea were closely investigated by the authorities, included a diverse gathering of PCR figures: Foriș, Trost, Marxist sociologist Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, unionist Ilie Pintilie and the Bessarabian poet Emilian Bucov. \"Reporter\" also published the militant poems of Demostene Botez, Liviu Deleanu and Al. Șahighian, and samples of international left-leaning literature (Ilya Ehrenburg, André Malraux, Nikolai Ostrovsky). The maverick dramatist Mihail Sebastian was, for a while, \"Reporter\"s literary chronicler.\n\nOnly two months after Cocea took over, \"Reporter\" was banned by state censorship, suspected of \"communist tendencies\" and of publishing \"alarmist articles.\" The sincerity of Cocea's political credo was by then coming into question: the maverick communist Petre Pandrea alleged that Cocea was infiltrated into the party ranks by \"Siguranța Statului\". Stelian Tănase also describes Cocea as a double agent, notoriously close to \"Siguranța\" director Mihail Moruzov (his Bucharest neighbor), trafficking in information from the communist movement and the court of Carol II, but still advising PCR Agitprop. Cocea was nevertheless being closely watched by the \"Siguranța\" Detective Corps. It kept notes on his meetings with French press correspondents, with Spanish Republican diplomats and with disgraced Jewish Romanian journalists such as Jacques G. Costin. According to these documents, Cocea discussed political matters with the opponents of Carol II, including National Peasantist Iuliu Maniu and communist sympathizer Petru Groza. He is known to have had great sympathy for Maniu, despite their political differences.\n\nA 1939 entry in Cocea's own diary admits that the \"unexpected\" Non-Aggression Treaty between the Soviets and Nazi Germany was the source of \"doubting\" and \"bitterness\" among left-wing Romanians, but scolds his old friend Nicolae L. Lupu for having then lost faith in socialism. In contrast to his earlier political stances, Cocea was, by 1938, a member of the National Liberal Party, probably because a new wave of repression had led the PCR to implode. He was registered with the National Liberals until after Carol II's National Renaissance Front dictatorship pushed them into semi-clandestinity, and still enjoyed a privileged relationship with them during World War II.\n\nCocea was inactive during the war, when Romania was allied with the Axis Powers, and the successive dictatorial regimes. Inhabiting a private villa in the Transylvanian town of Sighișoara, he kept diaries which offer insight into his various political dealings. Around 1939, he was separated from his wife Gina, following a series of disagreements in the family. The fascist National Legionary regime continued to keep track on his movements during 1940, alarmed by rumors that he had been operating a clandestine printing press, but was unable to determine whether he was still a communist.\n\nFrom 1941, the Nazi-aligned regime of \"Conducător\" Ion Antonescu ordered Romania's participation in the war against the Soviet Union. Cocea was active in the informal opposition to Antonescu, approaching his old friends in the mainstream political parties. As early as January 1942, Cocea met with the National Peasantist leadership, probing its attitude toward the Soviet Union and the Romanian communists. Like them, Cocea was positively impressed that the PCR was turning into a \"patriotic\" party and going back on its pro-German stance. Around 1944, Cocea resumed contacts with the since-revived PCR. In June, \"Siguranța\" reported that he was rounding up support for communist sympathizer Mihai Ralea and his underground Socialist Peasants' Party. He later served as the communists' liaison with the National Liberal Party wing of Gheorghe Tătărescu (later, the National Liberal Party-Tătărescu). Cocea's intervention contributed to a strategic alliance between the communists and the various other parties, within a coalition which overthrew Antonescu (\"see King Michael's Coup\"). Cocea's actress sister Alice, who was living in Nazi-occupied France, was taking a different path: she and her manager, Robert Capgras, had a friendly relationship with the Germans and were later deemed collaborators with the enemy.\n\nIn September 1944, Cocea was elected Vice President of the Romanian Writers' Society, which was in the process of expelling writers associated with the wartime regimes. He personally proposed for some 50 \"valuable writers\", from Maria Banuș and Ury Benador to Radu Tudoran and Gheorghe Zane, including many of his left-wing friends, to be admitted into the Society (only 20 of them were eventually received). The following month, he participated with Callimachi in the creation of a formally unified Journalists' Trade Union. Split between PCR and National Peasantist lobbies, it was created around the conjectural goal of purging the Romanian press of fascist influences. The Union was originally presided by a Committee comprising Cocea, Callimachi, Nicolae Carandino, Miron Constantinescu, George Ivașcu, Eugen Jebeleanu, Octav Livezeanu, George Macovescu, Nicolae Moraru, Ion Pas, Grigore Preoteasa, Tudor Teodorescu-Braniște, Alfons Vogel and several others. In May 1945, Cocea represented the Writers' Society at the funeral of his \"Reporter\" colleague Mihail Sebastian, who had been killed in a road accident.\n\nThe Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union (ARLUS), which offered a good reception to Soviet occupation forces, counted N. D. and Dina Cocea among its earliest members (although they were probably not among its founders); in December 1944, father and daughter were co-opted on the ARLUS Leadership Committee. The ARLUS Press Section, headed by Teodorescu-Braniște, had Cocea as one of its first vice presidents, serving alongside Ion Pas. Around 1946, Cocea approached Arghezi with a PCR offer to become a paid communist writer. According to his own classified report for the party, he was unable to persuade his former friend to join him in this cause. Cocea's various efforts still earned praise from official poet Mihai Beniuc, who included his colleague among the writers most active in disseminating communist principles after August 1944. According to Tănase, Cocea \"offered himself to the Soviet occupier, with the same amoralism and cynicism that have been following him through life.\"\n\nBetween 1944 and 1946, Cocea was also editor and publisher of \"Victoria\" (\"Victory\") daily. Although nominally independent, it has been claimed by journalist Victor Frunză that this paper was a tribune for the PCR, supporting the policies of communization, and popularizing Stalinism. It fostered a new generation of journalists and activists, among them Vera Călin, B. Elvin, George Mărgărit and Marius Mircu. Other \"Victoria\" contributors, including Iosifescu, Constantin Balmuș, the avant-garde writers Radu Boureanu and Geo Dumitrescu, wrote articles which condemned the various traditional seats of learning and the Romanian Academy, as \"reactionary\", while naming the senior far right supporters in culture (from Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voinești and D. Caracostea to P. P. Panaitescu and Ion Petrovici).\n\nOn March 31, 1945, Cocea replaced the disgraced Carandino as Inspector-general of the Romanian theaters, and began introducing communist censorship. In September 1947, a few months before the Romanian communist regime officially took over, Cocea was reelected to the Writers' Society Leadership Committee. Together with Ion Pas, the Minister of Arts, he introduced legislation that severely curtailed the Romanian dramatic repertoire. It was largely impractical, causing an uproar in the theatrical community, and leading to Cocea's demotion in December 1947.\n\nOn January 9, 1948, Cocea was made Vice President of the reformed Writers' Society (later Writers' Union of Romania), alongside Galaction, Gábor Gaál and Al. Șahighian (Zaharia Stancu was the President, Ion Călugăru the General Secretary). He died the next year at his home in Sighișoara, shortly after a spiritual crisis had brought him back into the Romanian Orthodox Church.\n\nN. D. Cocea had a notoriously promiscuous lifestyle, a favorite topic of gossip and urban legends. In his recollections, fellow journalist Constantin Beldie alleged that Cocea once owned a summer pavilion frequented by debauched young women, a veritable \"seraglio\". A writer named Bogdan Amaru noted in autumn 1934 that \"Nicu D. Cocea always walks around with two girls on his arms. The women sense in him the writer who is at all times willing to render them immortal with the tip of his pen.\" However, the intelligence agents keeping Cocea under surveillance during the 1930s and '40s collected rumors according to which their target was a homosexual. The \"Țara Noastră\" polemicists also claimed that Cocea's pederasty was a matter of public record.\n\nCocea's marriages and relationships resulted in four children: Tantzi, Dina, Radu and Ioana-Maria (also known as Maria Cocea). Florica Mille, who was his first wife, left him for his many affairs with younger women, even though, Dina Cocea recalls, she was forever fascinated by his intellect. After the 1920 divorce, Cocea is said to have lived with a Maria or Zoe Grigorescu. Tantzi, who was born to him from this relationship (1909), was the first wife of Liviu Ciulley (father of the award-winning filmmaker Liviu Ciulei). The writer's second marriage, to Lila Stănescu, was allegedly one of convenience, and he was at the time still in a physical relationship with Gina Manolescu-Strunga, the reason for his statutory rape trial. Their affair continued even after Gina married art critic Petru Comarnescu, and she was carrying Cocea's child when that marriage was annulled.\n\nThe daughter, Ioana-Maria, was later recognized by Cocea, and earned her artistic reputation as a sculptor; through her mother, she was related to the Ghica family and to the banker Iosif Pincas. Like Comarnescu before him, Cocea became disenchanted with Gina and was repelled by her public persona: his diaries contain sarcastic comments on her supposed lack of principles and naïvete, calling her \"Gina Balamuc\" (\"Madhouse Gina\"). After parting with Cocea, Gina was married to communist journalist Ghiță Ionescu (later known as an anti-communist academic, relocated to England). In the 1940s, while in Sighișoara, Cocea had as a mistress Ioana Mosora, who was more than 40 years his junior. One of his final projects was to educate Ioana, the daughter of impoverished peasants, on art and literary history.\n\nAccording to literary historian George Călinescu, Cocea was only devoted to \"the cause of the proletariat\" in his public life: \"in his most intimate life, an aristocrat, worshiping the established order and the supreme factor.\" The anticlerical journalist was always troubled by the matters of belief and organized religion. In \"Spre Roma\", Cocea confesses about having piously knelt in front of Leonardo da Vinci's \"Last Supper\", and about finding the arguments of Roman Catholic preachers to be almost irresistible. Cocea was still active in the Romanian Freemasonry: he stood by the dissident Masons who pledged allegiance to Grand Masters George Valentin Bibescu and Grigore C. Grigoriu; from 1945, he was himself a Deputy Grand Master. Reputedly, it was him who advised Grigoriu and Mihail Noradunghian to send this Masonic Lodge into \"sleep\", as a means to preempt communist suppression. In old age, he rediscovered Romanian Orthodoxy. He made arrangements for his parents to be reburied in Sighișoara, recognized all his illegitimate children, and, on his death bed, demanded to be buried with an Orthodox service performed by his old friend Galaction.\n\nCocea's image with his two friends Galaction and Arghezi had a more shady side. Cocea himself divulged Arghezi's private anti-communism in his 1946 report to the PCR overseers, recording that Arghezi rejected offers for collaboration with sarcasm and pride. Arghezi's own private notes, and some of his published lampoons, contain some biting remarks about Cocea's communist career. In a 2005 interview, Galaction's daughter Elena also stated that her father had only remained in contact with Cocea because of Cocea's kinship with Zoe Marcou-Galaction; the family, she claimed, mistrusted and feared Cocea, whom Zoe herself likened to the devil, but whose conversation skills they all found irresistibly entertaining.\n\nIn George Călinescu's definition, Cocea was \"more of a yellow journalist than a talented one\". Reviewing \"Fecior de slugă\" for \"Gând Românesc\" magazine in October 1933, cultural journalist C. Pastia sarcastically commented that Cocea's lampoons had \"taught boys how to curse\", in which action he identified the Cocea's lifelong objective. Similar assessments were later passed by other authors and researchers. Paul Cernat described Cocea the pamphleteer as \"feared\" and \"vitriolic\", while Stelian Tănase summarized his writing as \"sharp, polemical and vulgar\". Likewise, critic Mihai Zamfir calls Cocea's republican pamphlets \"filthy\", accusing them of promoting, together with the \"stupid little poems\" of the much older Alexandru Vlahuță, a distorted image of the Romanian monarchy. Stelian Tănase also notes that Cocea resorted in blackmail, just like his ex-pupil turned rival Pamfil Șeicaru, but that he was less interested than Șeicaru in accumulating fortunes. Cocea himself was vexed by Șeicaru's style. In his definition, it was the literary equivalent of \"postilion curses\".\n\nThe harsh pronouncements on Cocea's journalistic contributions are nuanced or contradicted by other writers and critics. Scarlat Callimachi spoke of his comrade, the \"feared polemicist\", as in reality \"a good man\" of \"amazing generosity\", and, stylistically, \"a poet\": \"Even in his most violent articles one finds glimpses of true poetry.\" The latter trait, Callimachi assessed, survived no matter how hard Cocea trained himself to repress it. Cocea's skill was emphasized by his foe, Comarnescu, who believed Cocea to be a \"semi-failure\" as an intellectual, but also a \"joker\" of genius. According to Pastia: \"no one in Romanian literature has ever speculated paradox with as much courage and talent.\" Writing in 1936, the young \"Facla\" essayist Eugène Ionesco (later a world-famous playwright), listed Cocea and Arghezi among the \"peaks\" of an older generation, as Romania's two \"greatest lampoonists\". Various other authors have also seen in Cocea a founding figure of the more satirical and politically aware side of modern Romanian humor.\n\nCocea's youthful debut with \"Poet-Poetă\" was his homage to Symbolist prose poetry, colored with a strongly erotic tinge. According to George Călinescu, the book, \"vehemently priapic and monotonous in its excess\", borrows its tone from Alexandru Macedonski, its titillating subject from Pierre Louÿs, and its plot from Mihai Eminescu (the novel \"Cezara\"). The protagonists of \"Poet-Poetă\", Iulius and Ersilia, living on love and desire, discover each other's bodies and then the joy of dying of one's own volition, hurling themselves off a precipice. Writing in 1911, Ilarie Chendi noted that the book was Cocea's first known blunder, speculating that literary failure had relegated Cocea to the promotion of other, more talented, Symbolists.\n\nCălinescu sees the positive aspect of \"Poet-Poetă\" in its \"delicate description\" of the human form (Ersilia's hair, for instance, is \"stofă fără preț\", \"priceless fabric\"). Fellow literary historian and critic Ștefan Cazimir has included Cocea's work among the Symbolist novels directly influenced by Vienna Secession art and the Secessionists' feminization of nature. Such traits also stand out in Galaction's biblical preface, a new \"Song of Songs\": \"Ersilia's eyes are as green as the depths of the ponds at Heshbon; and her breasts like twin does grazing among the lilies.\" These interventions were held against Galaction by literary historian Eugen Lovinescu (an outspoken adversary of the \"Viața Socială\" writers): \"A militant Orthodox, [Galaction] prefaced in his youth novels which defile all things sacred\".\n\nIn 1908, when he castigated both Symbolism and \"perverted eroticism\", Cocea left a detailed list of authors he considered \"degenerate\" and \"bourgeois\": Gabriele d'Annunzio, Dumas-fils, Maurice Maeterlinck, Anna de Noailles, Georges Ohnet, Marcel Prévost, and Oscar Wilde. According to literary historian Angelo Mitchievici, the substance of such \"class-based criticism\" was equivalent to the biological determinism of Cocea's nationalist adversaries, announcing the absolutes of fascism (\"degenerate art\") and communism (the Zhdanov Doctrine).\n\n\"Vinul de viață lungă\" is considered by some to be Cocea's main work as a novelist. The main character, Manole Arcaș, is, like Cocea himself, a Moldavian boyar. Successive episodes in the book reveal his complex worldview: Arcaș is an atheist with modernist sensibilities, a lover of nature, and a utopian socialist who has been turning his estate into a commune. Having reached a venerable age, he slowly reveals the secret of his longevity in conversations with the much younger judge: after decades of experimentation, the Arcaș estate produces a special sort of Moldavian wine; the grapes were pressed by Manole and a Romani (Gypsy) girl, in the course of their love-making. The object of Arcaș' olfactory fetish, the girl has died a tragic death, inspiring Manole to take up the winery project as a sort of symbolic rebirth.\n\nWith its aesthetics and its tone, \"Vinul de viață lungă\" is an unusual sample of militant literature, contrasting with the work of socialist or Poporanist writers from Cocea's lifetime. French historian Bernard Camboulives notes that Cocea made a point of reacting against Poporanists' call to preserve \"Romanian specificity\". Similarly, George Călinescu notes that the Poporanist setting is given an original twist in Cocea's novel, with the erotic interludes. As Callimachi writes, the book is a rare moment in which Cocea the poet vanquished Cocea the journalist, while Camboulives sees in it \"a eulogy to life, to love, to the senses and to the most elevated thoughts\". In Călinescu's more skeptical interpretation, it merely stands for \"a journalistic narrative, with the stylistic decency of well-read men\", its author being less than a \"creator\", its dialogues just \"chatter\".\n\nDuring the interwar period, Cocea could at times register significant success, but it was largely owed to the scandalous nature of his novels. The issue was taken into consideration by Călinescu, who referred to Cocea's \"exaggerated, but explainable\" popularity. C. Pastia also suspected Cocea of pulling a prank, \"leaving the impression that he had dedicated himself to literature\" in \"Vinul de viață lungă\", and then returning to the political stage with novel-lampoons. Cocea also found critics among his fellow modernists: writing in 1935, modernist critic Lucian Boz created a separation between the \"pornographic novels\" of Cocea or D. V. Barnoschi, which \"have orgasm as their goal\", and the controversial but \"brave\" literature of James Joyce.\n\n\"Fecior de slugă\", the first of Cocea's political novels, takes its artistic inspiration from the \"fin de siècle\" novelist Duiliu Zamfirescu, creator of the social climbing prototype Dinu Păturică. Cocea's Dinu is Tănase Bojogeanu, the \"son of the servant\" referred to in the book's title. As a child, he is shown competing in school with Nelu Azan, the daydreaming aristocrat, profiting from Azan's generosity and overtaking him in many respects. However, while Nelu preserves ideals which lead him into the communist movement, Tănase, the corrupt clerk, rises through the ranks to become King's Commissioner. The two are pitted against each other, their ideological conflict made worse when Bojogeanu sells a young female communist into sexual slavery.\n\nPresent throughout the work are masked portrayals of Cocea's political allies and adversaries. Pastia, who described such cameos as both cartoonish and interesting, identified Alexandru Averescu, Ion I. C. Brătianu, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, I. C. Frimu, Dumitru Iliescu-Turtucaia, Take Ionescu, Nicolae Iorga and some others. Pastia also suggests that the central theme (Bojogeanu as the bourgeois suffocating ancient boyardom) is conventional and ultimately irrelevant: \"That may well be, and we agree that our morals may tolerate the decay of the Azans and the ascent of the Bojogeanus. But this did not a novel make. An issue of \"Facla\" would have sufficed.\" Călinescu spoke with displeasure about \"Fecior de slugă\" as an illustration of Cocea's \"strident, violent style, excessively vulgar and of a sexuality that is never redeemed by a hint of whatever is eternally human.\" Pastia however found that Cocea wrote his book with noticeable talent \"in rendering that which is vulgar\", a Romanian answer to Charles Baudelaire's \"Les Fleurs du mal\".\n\n\"Pentr-un petec de negreață\", with its name borrowed from peri-urban Romanian folklore, shows its male protagonist Andrei Vaia alternating between dreams of free love in the countryside and the adulation of Bucharest as a hotspot of erotic pursuits. Of the adventures depicted, some are believed to have been modeled on Cocea's own sexual exploits. A pivotal moment in the novel shows Andrei discovering that his Bucharest lover, Mira, is cheating on him with the hunchback Bergher, who has purchased her attentions with stockings and silk. Through Vaia's monologues, the book gives Cocea's views about the female psyche and bodily needs, the supposedly eternal insecurity of men, and the mystery of female orgasm. \"Pentr-un petec...\" doubled as a barely disguised satire of the interwar political class, in this case specifically directed at the National Peasants' Party—according to Călinescu, this was Cocea's selling tactic, as were its advertised depictions of \"fornication\" and \"sexual abnormalities\", or its licentious quotation from the Book of Proverbs.\n\nIn \"Nea Nae\", the eponymous protagonist is a boorish and thick potentate, always on the hunt for \"beastly erotic pleasures\" (Călinescu), sometimes accompanied by thinly disguised political figures of the interwar. Călinescu was especially critical of Nae's speech patterns, caricatured \"without the gifts of the picturesque\".\n\nCocea greatly influenced the journalistic style of young Ion Vinea and Scarlat Callimachi. In addition to his presence in the memoirs or diaries of his friends and enemies, Cocea is the republican revolutionist in \"Cronică de familie\" (\"Family Chronicle\"), by the communist writer Petru Dumitriu—a text allegedly plagiarized from Vinea's unpublished works. Among the better-known visual portrayals of Cocea is a 1928 ink drawing by Marcel Janco.\n\nSome of N. D. Cocea's writings enjoyed a good standing throughout Romania's communist period. During the early 1960s, official textbooks described him as one of those who covered the gap between 19th-century Realism and Romanian Socialist Realism. In particular, the communist regime overplayed Cocea's criticism of the Romanian monarchy, glorifying him as someone who had undermined the credibility of Michael I and his predecessors. In one instance, communist historiography even claimed that Cocea and Arghezi had served time for their 1912 anti-monarchy campaign, taking \"Facla\" lampoons at face value. Cocea's World War II diaries were passed on to his relatives in Switzerland, and have not been published except for the short fragments hosted in the 1960s by two Romanian reviews: \"Magazin Istoric\" and \"Secolul XX\". In 1970, an edition of his \"Jurnal\" (\"Diary\") was issued by the PCR's Editura Politică. A previously unknown novel by Cocea was signaled in the late 1970s, and noted for its virulent attacks on Pamfil Șeicaru.\n\nCocea's literature and political controversy were also publicized outside Romania. From his refuge in Francoist Spain, Șeicaru made public his decades-long polemic with Cocea. His repeated talk about Cocea's immorality prompted literary historian Nicolae Manolescu to note a paradox: \"It is somewhat strange to see accusations of immorality being launched by people who, beyond their talent [...], do not even possess the most basic moral sense. The mere fact that the pamphlets they hurl at each other, like hogwash, have morality as their stake (never their own, always the other's), should make one think.\" A French-language translation of \"Vinul de viață lungă\" was published by Jean de Palacio (\"Le Vin de longue vie\", Le Serpent à Plumes, 2000). According to Romanian literary critic Mircea Iorgulescu, the positive reception of such works in France \"would probably astound the Romanian literary environment, for whom Cocea hardly even exists.\"\n\nStreets named after Cocea exist in Bucharest, Sighișoara, Brașov, Oradea, Sibiu and Timișoara. His residence in Sighișoara is preserved by the local authorities as a \"memorial house\". The same city is home to the N. D. Cocea Literary Club, established 1979.\n\n"}

{"id": "18952265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18952265", "title": "Pulque", "text": "Pulque\n\nPulque (occasionally referred to as agave wine) is an alcoholic beverage made from the fermented sap of the maguey (agave) plant. It is traditional to central Mexico, where it has been produced for millennia. It has the color of milk, somewhat viscous consistency and a sour yeast-like taste. \n\nThe drink's history extends far back into the Mesoamerican period, when it was considered sacred, and its use was limited to certain classes of people. After the Spanish Conquest of Mexico, the drink became secular and its consumption rose. The consumption of pulque reached its peak in the late 19th century. In the 20th century, the drink fell into decline, mostly because of competition from beer, which became more prevalent with the arrival of European immigrants. There are some efforts to revive the drink's popularity through tourism.\n\nPulque is a milk-colored, somewhat viscous liquid that produces a light foam. It is made by fermenting the sap of certain types of maguey (agave) plants. In contrast, mezcal is made from the cooked heart of certain agave plants, and tequila, a variety of mezcal, is made all or mostly from the blue agave. About six varieties of maguey are best used for the production of pulque. The name \"pulque\" is derived from Nahuatl. The original name of the drink was \"iztāc octli\" (white pulque), the term pulque was probably mistakenly derived by the Spanish from the \"octli poliuhqui\" , which meant \"spoiled pulque\".\n\nThe maguey plant, also called a \"century plant\" in English, is native to Mexico. It grows best in the cold, dry climates of the rocky central highlands to the north and east of Mexico City, especially in the states of Hidalgo and Tlaxcala. Maguey has been cultivated at least since 200 CE in Tula, Tulancingo and Teotihuacan, and wild plants have been exploited for far longer. The plant historically has had a number of uses. Fibers can be extracted from the thick leaves to make rope or fabric, its thorns can be used as needles or punches and the membrane covering the leaves can be used as paper or for cooking. The name \"maguey\" was given by the Spanish, who picked it up from the Taíno. This is still its common name in Spanish, with \"Agave\" being its scientific generic or technical name. The Nahuatl name of the plant is \"metl\".\n\nThe manufacturing process of pulque is complex and required the death of the maguey plant. As the plant nears maturity, the center begins to swell and elongate as the plant gathers stored sugar to send up a single flower stalk, which may reach up to 20 feet in height. However, plants destined for pulque production have this flower stalk cut off, leaving a depressed surface 12-18 inches in diameter. In this center, the maguey sap, known as \"aguamiel\" (honeywater), collects. It takes a maguey plant 12 years to mature enough to produce the sap for pulque.\n\nPulque has been drunk for at least 1,000 years, and its origins are the subject of various stories and myths. Most involve Mayahuel, the goddess of the maguey. It was thought that the aguamiel collecting in the center of the plant was her blood. Other deities, such as the Centzon Totochtin (400 rabbits) are associated with it, by representing the drink's effects, and are the children of Mayahuel. Another version involving \"Mayahuel\" has her as a mortal woman who discovered how to collect aguamiel but someone named \"Pantecatl\" discovered how to make pulque.\n\nAccording to another story, pulque was discovered by the \"Tlacuache\" (opossum), who used his human-like hands to dig into the maguey and extract the naturally fermenting juice. He became the first drunk. \"Tlacuache\" was thought to set the course of rivers. The rivers he set were generally straight except when he was drunk. Then they follow \"Tlacuache's\" meandering path from cantina to cantina.\n\nAnother account traces the discovery of aguamiel to the Toltec Empire, when a noble named Papantzin was trying to get the emperor to marry his daughter Xochitl. He sent her to the capital with an offering of \"aguamiel\", honey of the agave plant. The emperor and princess wed, and their son was named \"Meconetzin\" (maguey son). In other versions of the story, Xochitl is credited with discovering pulque.\n\nThe maguey was one of the most sacred and important plants in ancient Mexico. It had a privileged place in mythology, religious rituals and the Mesoamerican economy. Pulque appears in a number of graphic representations from pre-colonial times, beginning with stone carvings from about 200 CE. The first major work involving pulque is a large mural called the \"Pulque Drinkers\", unearthed in 1968 at the pyramid of Cholula, Puebla. The most likely means of the discovery of aguamiel and fermented pulque was from the observation of rodents who gnaw and scratch at the plant to drink the seeping sap. Fermentation of the aguamiel can take place within the plant itself.\n\nFor the indigenous peoples of the central highlands of Mexico, the imbibing of pulque was done only by certain people, under certain conditions. It was a ritual drink, consumed during certain festivals, such as that of the goddess Mayahuel, and the god Mixcoatl. It was drunk by priests and sacrificial victims, to increase the priests' enthusiasm and to ease the suffering of the victim. There are many references in Aztec codices, such as the Borbonicus Codex, of pulque's use by nobility and priesthood to celebrate victories. Among commoners, it was permitted only to the elderly and pregnant women. Production of pulque was ritualized and the brewers were superstitious. They would abstain from sex during the fermentation period because they believed that sexual intercourse would sour the process.\n\nAfter the Conquest, pulque lost its sacred character, and both indigenous and Spanish people began to drink it. The Spanish initially made no laws regarding its use. It became a lucrative source of tax revenue, but by 1672, public drunkenness had become enough of a problem that the viceregal government created regulations to curtail its consumption. A maximum of 36 \"pulquerias\" were permitted for Mexico City, which had to be located in open areas, be without doors and close at sundown. Food, music, dancing and the co-mingling of the sexes was prohibited. However, pulque continued to play a major role in the socioeconomic history of Mexico during colonial times and in the early years of Independence. Through this period, it was the fourth largest source of tax revenue. At the end of the 17th century, the Jesuits began large-scale production of the drink to finance its educational institutions. In this way, the making of pulque passed from being a home-made brew to one commercially produced.\n\nThe casta system of racial hierarchy was created in Spanish America for elites to classify individuals into groups based on phenotype and perceived social class, and give them characteristics that were supposedly inherent to their group. Often artists portrayed mixed-race castas. This form of Mexican art portrayed castas in settings that were typical of their social group. The portrayal of pulque was used to show polarization between different castas. Before the Spanish colonization of the Americas, pulque was used for religious ceremonies in Mesoamerica. After the arrival of the Spanish, consumption was widespread among Indigenous Americans and mixed-race castas. This led to many social problems including sexual crimes and violence within the population.\n\nIn casta painting, pulque depicted situations the Europeans saw as characteristic of the castas they portrayed. Some of these paintings incorporated images of indigenous Americans and Africans as drunk with bottles appearing in the scenes. This is a reason that \"shortly after the conquests, colonial officials declared pulque abuse and Indian drunkenness a major concern and committed themselves to addressing its impacts on society\". As a result, some casta painters depicted different castas safely consuming and selling pulque. Other casta painters depicted Indigenous Americans intoxicated in the streets, and incapacitated which as a result required their families to escort them home. Casta painting was used as a method of social commentary on the destructive use of pulque in everyday society. As the Spanish attempted to crack down on pulque, some casta painters depicted indigenous Americans in safe environments where even children were able to consume pulque. The paintings were meant to show that Spanish regulation was effective in controlling the consumption and distribution of pulque in the colonial period.\n\nProduction of pulque exploded after Independence, when the regulation of pulque producers ended, and Mexican nationalism increased. From then until the 1860s, pulque haciendas multiplied, especially in Hidalgo and Tlaxcala states. In 1866, the first railway between Veracruz and Mexico City began operations, crossing through Hidalgo. This line was soon known as the \"Pulque Train\" because it brought supplies of the drink daily to the capital. This production and easy shipment of the drink made Hidalgo rich, and gave rise to a \"pulque aristocracy\" made up of some of the most powerful families of this time: Torres Adalid, Pimenta y Fagoaga, Macedo and others. At its peak, there were about 300 pulque haciendas. Some still remain in the plains of Apan and Zempoala, in Hidalgo. Pulque hit its peak of popularity during the late 19th century, when it was enjoyed by rich and poor alike. As late as 1953, Hidalgo and Tlaxcala still obtained 30 and 50% respectively of their total revenues from pulque. This has diminished since then since irrigation, roads and other infrastructure has made possible other, more lucrative enterprises.\n\nIn spite of its former popularity, pulque represents only 10% of the alcoholic beverages consumed in Mexico today. Pulque is still consumed in Mexico, mostly in the central highlands and predominantly in rural and poor areas. It has acquired a general connotation of being something for the lower class, while consumption of European-style beer flourished throughout the 20th century.\n\nThe complex and delicate fermentation process of pulque had always limited the product's distribution, as it does not keep long and agitation during transport speeds degradation. Since pre-Hispanic times, its consumption has mostly been limited to the central highlands of Mexico.\n\nThe decline of pulque began in the first decade of the 20th century, when the Mexican Revolution caused a decline in its production. In the 1930s, the government of Lázaro Cárdenas campaigned against pulque, as part of an effort to reduce alcoholic consumption in general. But the most decisive factor to the decline of pulque has been the introduction of beer.\n\nEuropean immigrant beer brewers in the early 20th century had their own campaign against the native pulque, claiming that pulque producers used a \"muñeca\" (doll), a textile bag containing human or animal feces which was placed in the \"aguamiel\" to hasten the fermentation process. Some pulque producers have insisted that the \"muñeca\" is completely a myth, but modern historians suggest that it did happen, although only rarely. Beer producers promoted the idea that pulque was generally made this way, generally by word of mouth and insinuation. This was done to inhibit pulque sales and to promote the consumption of beer, which they claimed was \"rigorously hygienic and modern\".\n\nThe strategy proved successful, with pulque now generally looked-down-upon and imbibed by relatively few people, with Mexican-brewed beer ubiquitous and extremely popular. Pulque's popularity is low and continues to fall. Twenty years ago, about 20 trucks would come every three days to Xochimilco (in southern Mexico City) to deliver pulque, but now the number is down to one or two. Only five pulquerias remain in this district, where there used to be 18. The situation is similar in most other parts of Mexico, as well. The remaining pulquerias are very small establishments, selling a product made by small producers.\n\nIn the state of Hidalgo, in which most maguey is grown, fields of this plant are disappearing, with barley taking its place. Most maguey plants here serve as boundary markers between properties. Many of these plants do not survive long, as they are often vandalized. An estimated 10,000 plants are mutilated each week by cutting off the lower leaves for barbacoa or destroying them completely to look for the edible white grubs or ant eggs that can inhabit them.\n\nThe production process is long and delicate. The maguey plant needs 12 years of maturation before the sap, or \"aguamiel\", can be extracted, but a good plant can produce for up to one year. This aguamiel can be drunk straight, but it is alcoholic only after a fermentation process that can start in the plant itself. This liquid is collected twice a day from the plant, yielding about five or six liters per day. Today, this liquid is collected with a steel scoop, but in the past, an elongated gourd was used as a tube to suck the juice out. Between gatherings, the plant's leaves are bent over the center where the juice collects to keep out bugs and dirt. This center is regularly scraped out to keep the plant's production of sap active. Most maguey plants produce this \"aguamiel\" for about four to six months before they finally die. Some plants can yield up to 600 L of pulque. \n\nThe collected juice is placed into 50-liter barrels and carried from the field to the fermentation vats. These vats, called \"tinas\", are located in a special building called a \"tinacal\". This word derives from Spanish \"tina\" and Nahuatl \"calli\" that means house of vats. When pulque haciendas reached their peak in the late 19th century, hacienda life revolved around these \"tinacals\". It typically was a rectangular shed of stone with a wooden roof. The upper parts of the walls opened for air circulation and the façades were sometimes decorated with indigenous designs or other images associated with the making of pulque. One popular motif was the discovery of pulque by Xochitl. Other popular elements were the images of the hacienda's patron saint and the Virgin of Guadalupe. Inside were the vats, which were cowhide stretched over wooden frames lined up against the walls. In larger \"tinacals\", there were three or four rows of vats. Today, the \"tinas\" are made of oak, plastic or fiberglass and hold about 1,000 liters each.\nAfter placing the juice in the fermentation vats, mature seed pulque (\"semilla\" or \"xanaxtli\") is added to \"jump start\" the process. Unlike beer, the fermenting agent present in pulque is a bacterium of the species \"Zymomonas mobilis\" (syn. \"Thermobacterium mobile\" ) rather than yeast. Those in charge of the fermentation process guard their trade secrets, passing them on from father to son. Fermentation takes from seven to 14 days, and the process seems to be more art than science. A number of factors can affect fermenting pulque, such as temperature, humidity and the quality of the \"aguamiel\".\n\nThe process is complex and delicate, and can go sour at any point. For this reason, and perhaps due to its ancient \"sacred\" character, there are rituals and prohibitions. Religious songs and prayers may be offered, and women, children and strangers are not allowed inside the \"tinacal\". Other superstitions include those against eating canned fish and wearing a hat inside the tinacal. The first is claimed to cause a bad taste in the pulque and the second is considered bad luck. To cleanse the bad luck, the offender must fill the hat with pulque and drink it down.\n\nJust before the peak of fermentation, the pulque is quickly shipped to market in barrels. The fermentation process is continuous, so the pulque must be consumed within a certain time before it spoils.\n\nMost pulque is consumed in bars called \"pulquerías\". At the beginning of the 20th century, more than 1,000 were located in Mexico City alone. By the early 20th century, \"pulquerías\" became socially accepted, and some were places of great elegance. But whether for rich or poor, two features stood out among these establishments: odd or catchy names, and murals decorating the walls. Names included (translated) \"My Office\", \"Memories of the Future\", \"Drink and Go\", \"I'm Waiting for You Here at the Corner\", and, across the street from the National Chamber of Deputies, \"The Recreation Center of Those Across the Street\". Diego Rivera once said one of the most important manifestations of Mexican painting was the murals that decorated the facades and interiors of \"pulquerías\". One tradition maintained at all\" pulquerias \"at the beginning of the 20th century was to put sawdust on the floor. The tradition at that time was to begin a pulque-drinking session by spilling a little on the floor or ground as an offering to Mother Earth. Traditional \"pulquerías\" tend to be like clubs with closed membership, with casual visitors ignored or sometimes stared at. Frequent visits and large consumption of the drink tends to win acceptance. While some establishments may forbid women, it is much more common for the establishment to provide a separate seating area for them. Intermingling of the sexes is not permitted. In the more rural areas of Hidalgo and Tlaxcala, where most pulque is made, the pulque is fresher and better. A vendor usually displays a white flag over the door when a fresh shipment has arrived.\n\nTraditionally, pulque is served from large barrels on ice. and served into glasses, using a \"jicara\", which is a half of a calabash tree gourd. The bartender is called a \"jicarero\". In a \"pulquería\", \"cruzado\", meaning something like \"bottoms up\", is a frequent salute.\n\nDrinking glasses have colorful names and can reflect a customer's ability to drink pulque. Large two-liter glasses are called \"macetas\" (flower pots), one-liter glasses are called \"cañones\" (cannons), half–liters are called \"chivitos\" (little goats), quarter-liter glasses are \"catrinas\" (dandies), and eighth-liter glasses are \"tornillos\" (screws). Traditionally, these glasses are made from a greenish, hand blown glass. Pulque can be drunk straight from the barrel or can have a number of additives, such as fruit or nuts, added. Pulque prepared this way is called \"curado\" or cured.\n\nOne of the limitations to pulque's popularity has been the inability to store it for long periods or ship it far. Recently, pulque makers have found a way to preserve the beverage in cans. However, they admit this does change the flavor. The hope is that with this innovation, pulque can regain its lost market in Mexico and even achieve success as an export item, like tequila. It is already being offered in the United States by Boulder Imports, selling the brand \"Nectar del Razo\". The original market was Mexican-American men, but the company reports the product is having success as a health food, sought out by athletes and body builders.\n\nThere is a saying that pulque \"sólo le falta un grado para ser carne\" – \"it is only a bit shy of being meat\", referring to the nutritional value of the drink. This was recognized by the Mesoamericans, who allowed pregnant women and the elderly to imbibe what was normally reserved only for priests and nobility. Modern analysis of the liquid has found that it contains carbohydrates, vitamin C, B-complex, D, E, amino acids and minerals such as iron and phosphorus.\n\nFrom the glory days of pulque, the state of Hidalgo has about 250 pulque haciendas, many of which have been abandoned or converted to other uses, such as ranching. Their \"tinacals\" have either disappeared or been converted into storage or party rooms. A few remaining ones continue to make pulque, but use more modern and sanitary facilities. In Tlaxcala, the federal Secretariat of Tourism and the state government have organized a tour called the \"Pulque Route\", which includes the main haciendas that still make the beverage in this state. It is a two-day route which begins at the Church of La Barca de la Fe in Calpulalpan to the San Bartolo Hacienda, which is the principal exporter of canned pulque. This hacienda was the property of Ignacio Torres Adalid, who was called the \"king of pulque\". Today, it belongs to Ricardo del Razo. The tour also covers maguey fields like those around a town called Guillermo Ramirez.\nThese old haciendas varied widely. Some were ostentatious with great architectural harmony such as the Montecillos Hacienda, of Spanish colonial style and originally built in the 17th century by the Jesuits or San Antonio Ometusco Hacienda built by architect Antonio Rivas Mercado. However, most haciendas were the result of a constructive process that started in the 16th century, with mixed architectural styles and methods of both Mexico and Europe. One characteristic feature is Neo-Gothic towers. The Santiago Tetlapayac Hacienda has murals related to charreada and attributed to the painter Icaza. The Zotoluca Hacienda has an octangonal floorplan in Neo-Moorish style and was restored in the 1950s. But the center of each of these pulque haciendas is the tinacal. They were planned and decorated befitting their importance. Almost all have interesting architectural details, such as a specially decorated main doorway, murals or sculpted windows. Some are considered works of art, such as the tinacal at the Montecillos Hacienda or the one at the San Antonio Ometusco Hacienda, which also has an elegant canopy covering the shipping dock with moulded iron columns and walls decorated with murals relating to the history of pulque.\n\n"}

A common syncretic religion is Vodou, which combined the West African religions of the African slaves with Catholicism and some Native American strands; it shows similarities to Cuban Santería.\n\nThe largest Christian denomination in the country is Roman Catholicism, which is estimated to be about 55 percent of the population according to the 2018 CIA World Factbook, and 57 percent according to the Pew Research Center. The historical background is very much due to the French influence brought about through the newly conquered territories.\n\nProtestantism has grown in recent years and Protestants are currently estimated by the CIA World Factbook to form 28.5% of the population, while the Pew Research Center estimates their share to be nearly 30 percent. \n\nThe predominant denomination is Roman Catholicism. Similar to the rest of Latin America, Saint-Domingue was built up by Roman Catholic European powers such as the Spanish and the French. Following in this legacy, Catholicism was in the Haitian constitution as its official state religion until 1987. According to recent estimates by the CIA World Factbook and Pew Research Center, between 55 and 60% of Haitians are Catholics. Pope John Paul II visited Haiti in 1983. In a speech in the capital of Port-au-Prince, he criticized the government of Jean-Claude Duvalier. It is believed that the impact of this speech on the Catholic bureaucracy in Haiti contributed to his removal in 1986.\n\nAccording to the Catholic Church in Haiti, the 10 dioceses of the two ecclesiastical provinces of Haiti include 251 parishes and about 1,500 Christian rural communities. The local clergy has 400 diocesan priests and 300 seminarians. There are also 1,300 religious missionary priests belonging to more than 70 religious order and fraternities. Vocations to the priesthood are plentiful.\n\nThe CIA Factbook reports that around 28.5% of the population is Protestant (Baptist 15.4%, Pentecostal 7.9%, Adventist 3%, Methodist 1.5% other 0.7%). Other sources put the Protestant population higher than this, suggesting that it may form one-third of the population today, as Protestant churches have experienced significant growth in recent decades. Other sources put the Protestant population higher than this, suggesting that it might have formed form one-third of the population in 2001.\n\nThe Episcopal Diocese of Haiti is the Anglican Communion diocese consisting of the entire territory of Haiti. It is part of Province 2 of the Episcopal Church (United States). Its cathedral, Holy Trinity (French: Cathédrale Sainte Trinité) located in the corner of Avenue Mgr. Guilloux and Rue Pavée in downtown Port-au-Prince, has been destroyed six times, including in the 2010 Haiti earthquake. It is the largest diocese in the Episcopal Church (United States), with 83,698 members reported in 2008.\n\nMissionary work in Haiti by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints began in May 1980 and the land was dedicated for the preaching of the gospel by Thomas S. Monson, then a member of the church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, on 17 April 1983. As of 2018, the church reported having 46 congregations and more than 23,000 members in Haiti. In September 2012, the third and fourth Haitian stakes were created. All four stakes are based in the capital region; districts are based in Les Cayes, Saint-Marc, Gonaïves, and Cap-Haïtien.\nAt the church's April 2009 General Conference, Fouchard Pierre-Nau, a native of Jérémie, was called as an area seventy in the church's Fourth Quorum of the Seventy, the most prominent church position ever held by a Haitian. In April 2016, Pierre-Nau was released and Hubermann Bien-Aimé, a native of Gonaïves, was called to that same quorum.\n\nDuring the April 2015 General Conference, Monson—now serving as the church's president—announced the church's intention to build a temple in Port-au-Prince. Groundbreaking took place 28 October 2017. In anticipation of the temple's completion, Fritzner and Gina Joseph were called in August 2018 as the first president and matron of the temple.\n\nThe New World Afro-diasporic religion of Vodou is also practised. Vodou encompasses several different traditions, and consists of a mix encompassing African, European and indigenous \"Taíno\" religious elements. In this way, it is very similar to other Latin American syncretist movements, such as the Cuban Santería. It is more widespread in rural parts of the country, partly due to negative stigmas attached to its practice. During the season of Lent, Vodou societies create parading musical bands for a festival called Rara, and fulfill religious obligations in local spaces such as streams, rivers, trees.\n\nThe CIA World Factbook reports that 2.1% of the population identifies its religion as Vodou, but adds that \"many Haitians practice elements of Vodou in addition to another religion, most often Roman Catholicism.\" The proportion of Haitians that practice Vodou is disputed, due to the often syncretic manner in which it is practiced alongside Catholicism. Haitian Protestants are less likely to practice Vodou, as their churches strongly denounce it as diabolical.\n\nThere is a small Muslim community in Haiti, mainly residing in Port-au-Prince, Cap-Haïtien and its surrounding suburbs. The history of Islam on the island of Hispaniola (which Haiti shares with the Dominican Republic) begins with slavery in Haiti. Many Muslims were imported as slaves to Haiti.\n\nIn 2000, Nawoon Marcellus, a member of Fanmi Lavalas from Saint-Raphaël, became the first Muslim elected to the Chamber of Deputies of Haiti.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith in Haiti begins with a mention by `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, in 1916 as one of the island countries of the Caribbean being among the places Bahá'ís should take the religion to. The first Bahá'í to visit Haiti was Leonora Armstrong in 1927. After that others visited until Louis George Gregory visited in January 1937 and he mentions a small community of Bahá'ís operating in Haiti. The first long term pioneers, Ruth and Ellsworth Blackwell, arrived in 1940. Following their arrival the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly of Haiti was formed in 1942 in Port-au-Prince. From 1951 the Haitian Bahá'ís participated in regional organizations of the religion until 1961 when Haitian Bahá'ís elected their own National Spiritual Assembly and soon took on goals reaching out into neighboring islands. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 21,000 Bahá'ís in Haiti in 2005.\n\nSephardic Jews arrived in Saint-Domingue during the first days of the colonial period, despite that they were banned in the official Catholic edicts. They became merchants and integrated themselves into the French Catholic society. Waves of Jews continued to immigrate to the Haiti, including a group of Ashkenazi Jews escaping Hitler's Germany in the 1940s; Haiti was one of the few countries to welcome them openly. Haitian Catholics had idiosyncratic ideas about Jews, stemming from Catholic anti-Judaism, although many Vodou practitioners imagined themselves to be the descendants of Jews and to hold esoteric Judaic knowledge.\n\nThere is a group of Judaism predominantly residing in Port-au-Prince, where the community today meets at the home of businessman billionaire Gilbert Bigio, a Haitian of Syrian descent. Bigio's father first settled in Haiti in 1925 and was active in the Jewish community. In November 1947, his father played a significant role in Haiti's support for the statehood of Israel in a vote to the United Nations. Every Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, services are held at his residence. The last Jewish wedding to take place in Haiti occurred 10 years ago; Bigio’s daughter, while the last bris was done for his son, more than 30 years ago. Bigio owns the only Torah in all of the country, which he provides to the community for services.\n\n"}

{"id": "16264154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16264154", "title": "Religion in Kosovo", "text": "Religion in Kosovo\n\nReligion in Kosovo is separated from the state. The Constitution establishes Kosovo as a secular state that is neutral in matters of religious beliefs and where everyone is equal before the law and freedom to belief, conscience and religion is guaranteed.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of State's 2007 International Religious Freedom Report, 'the last credible census was taken in the 1980s', and the religious demographics had to be estimated. The Report found that Islam was the predominant faith in Kosovo, 'professed by most of the majority ethnic Albanian population, the Bosniak, Gorani, and Turkish communities, and some of the Roma/Ashkali/Egyptian community'. About 100,000–120,000 people were Serbs, and these were largely Serbian Orthodox. Approximately 3.4% of ethnic Albanians were Catholics, whereas Protestants comprised a minority of less than 1%, there were only two known families of Jewish origin and no reliable data for atheists. It is also likely that there are some Orthodox Albanians in Kosovo. However, with current tension between Kosovars and Serbs, they may feel as if they do not want to identify as Orthodox, as they may be thought of as ‘Serbs’ because of their Orthodox status. Therefore, they are not represented in the census. Furthermore, the Report claimed that religion was 'not a significant factor in public life. Religious rhetoric was largely absent from public discourse in Muslim communities, mosque attendance was low, and public displays of conservative Islamic dress and culture were minimal.'\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center's 2015 study, in 2010 Kosovo had 93.8% Muslims and 6.1% Christians; all other religious groups and the unaffiliated each had less than 1%.\nThe 2011 Kosovo population census was largely boycotted by the Kosovo Serbs (who predominantly identify as Serbian Orthodox Christians), especially in North Kosovo, leaving the Serb population underrepresented. The results of the 2011 census gave the following religious affiliations for the population included in the census:\n\nThese figures do not represent individual sects operating in Kosovo such as Sufism or Bektashism which are sometimes classified generally under the category of \"Islam.\"\n\nThe Serb population is largely Serbian Orthodox, and primarily concentrated in North Kosovo, though a few enclaves exist elsewhere. The Catholic Albanian communities are mostly concentrated in Gjakova, Prizren, Klina and a few villages near Peć and Vitina (see laramans). Slavic-speaking Catholics usually call themselves Janjevci or Kosovan Croats. Slavic-speaking Muslims in the south of Kosovo are known as the Gorani people.\n\nChristianity probably reached Kosovo in the 5th century as the Roman Empire gradually split into a Greek East and Latin West. Kosovo became part the former, known as the Byzantine Empire, and thus fell into the sphere of the Orthodox Church based in Constantinople. During the High Middle Ages, as Byzantine rule in Kosovo gave way to the Serbian Empire in the early 13th century, there was a Serb-speaking Orthodox Christian majority, but also a Roman Catholic minority consisting of the Italo-Dalmatian merchant class from Ragusa, German immigrants from Hungary and Transylvania, and probably all of the native Albanian population.\n\nThe presence of Serbian Orthodox bishops in Lipljan and Prizren was first recorded in the 10th century. In 1219, the Serbian Orthodox Church split from the Greek Orthodox Church, and Greek bishops were expelled from Kosovo. The See of the Serbian Orthodox Church was moved from Žiča in present-day Serbia to Peć/Peja in present-day Kosovo in 1252, thus making it the religious and cultural centre of Serbian Orthodoxy. In 1346, the archbishop of Peć assumed the title of patriarch.\n\nKosovo was conquered by the Ottoman Empire along with the other remnants of the Serbian Empire in the period following the Battle of Kosovo (1389). Although the Ottomans did not force the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christian population to convert to Islam, there was strong social pressure (such as not having to pay the jizya) as well as political expediency to do so, which ethnic Albanians did in far greater numbers (including the entire nobility) than Serbs, Greeks and others in the region. Many Albanian Catholics converted to Islam in the 17th and 18th centuries, despite attempts by Roman Catholic clergy to stop them. During the \"Concilium Albanicum\", a meeting of Albanian bishops in 1703, a strict condemnation of conversion – especially for opportunistic reasons such as jizya evasion – was promulgated. Whilst many of these converts stayed crypto-Catholics to a certain extent, often helped by pragmatic lower clerics, the higher Roman Catholic clergy ordered them to be denied the sacraments for their heresy. Efforts to convert the Laraman community of Letnica back to Roman Catholicism began in 1837, but the effort was violently suppressed – the local Ottoman governor put laramans in jail. After the Ottoman Empire abolished the death penalty for apostasy from Islam by the Edict of Toleration 1844, several groups of crypto-Catholics in Prizren, Peja and Gjakova were recognised as Catholics by the Ottoman Grand Vizier in 1845. When the Laramans of Letnica asked the district governor and judge in Gjilan to recognise them as Catholics, they were refused however, and subsequently imprisoned, and then deported to Anatolia, from where they returned in November 1848 following diplomatic intervention. In 1856, a further Tanzimat reform improved the situation, and no further serious abuse was reported. The greater part of converts of Laramans, almost exclusively new-borns, took place between 1872 and 1924.\n\nAfter victory at the Battle of Kosovo (1389), the Ottoman Empire imposed Islamic rule on the region. Conversion was not obligatory, but had several financial, social and political benefits. Until the sixteenth century the degree of Islamisation in Kosovo was minimal, and largely confined to urban centres. The pace of conversions to Islam only increased significantly in the second half of the sixteenth century, possibly because converts thus became exempt from the \"cizje\", a tax levied only on non-Muslims. By 1634, the majority of Kosovo Albanians had converted to Islam, although a minority remained Roman Catholic. Besides the ethnic Albanians, and the ruling Turks who settled in Kosovo, the Roma and some part of the Slavic-speaking population (later called the Bosniaks and/or Gorani, to distinguish them from the Orthodox Serbs) also became Muslims, by far most of them Sunni, although small a minority of Shia Muslims formed in the countryside. By the end of the 17th century, the Islamic population started to outnumber the Christians.\n\n"}
{"id": "29098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29098", "title": "Shaolin Monastery", "text": "Shaolin Monastery\n\nThe Shaolin Monastery (), also known as the Shaolin Temple, is a Chan (\"Zen\") Buddhist temple in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, China. Believed to have been founded in the 5th century CE, the Shaolin Temple is the main temple of the Shaolin school of Buddhism to this day. \n\nShaolin Monastery and its Pagoda Forest were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2010 as part of the \"Historic Monuments of Dengfeng\".\n\nThe name refers to the forests of Shaoshi () mountain, one of the seven peaks of the Song mountains. The first Shaolin Monastery abbot was Batuo (also called \"Fotuo\" or \"Buddhabhadra\"), a dhyāna master who came to ancient China from ancient India or from Central Asia in 464 AD to spread Buddhist teachings.\n\nAccording to the \"Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks\" (645 AD) by Daoxuan, Shaolin Monastery was built on the north side of Shaoshi, the central peak of Mount Song, one of the Sacred Mountains of China, by Emperor Xiaowen of the Northern Wei dynasty in 477 AD, to accommodate the Indian master beside the capital Luoyang city. Yang Xuanzhi, in the \"Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang\" (547 AD), and Li Xian, in the \"Ming Yitongzhi\" (1461), concur with Daoxuan's location and attribution. The \"Jiaqing Chongxiu Yitongzhi\" (1843) specifies that this monastery, located in the province of Henan, was built in the 20th year of the \"Taihe\" era of the Northern Wei dynasty, that is, the monastery was built in 495 AD.\n\nAs the center of Chan Buddhism, the Shaolin Temple attracted many emperors’ attention in China’s history. During the Tang dynasty 618-907 AD Empress Wu Zetian (AD 625-705) paid several visits to the Shaolin Temple discussing Chan philosophy with high monk Tan Zong. According to legend, Emperor Taizong granted the Shaolin Temple extra land and a special \"imperial dispensation\" to consume meat and alcohol during the Tang dynasty. If true, this would have made Shaolin the only temple in China that did not prohibit alcohol. Regardless of historical veracity, these rituals are not practiced today. This legend is not corroborated in any period documents, such as the Shaolin Stele erected in 728. The stele does not list any such imperial dispensation as reward for the monks' assistance during the campaign against Wang Shichong, only land and a water mill are granted. The founder of the Yuan dynasty, Kublai Khan (AD 1215-1294) ordered all Buddhist temples in China to be led by the Shaolin Temple; there were eight Princes during the Ming dynasty turned themselves into Shaolin monks.\n\nTraditionally Bodhidharma is credited as founder of the martial arts at the Shaolin Temple. However, martial arts historians have shown this legend stems from a 17th-century qigong manual known as the \"Yijin Jing\".\n\nThe authenticity of the \"Yi Jin Jing\" has been discredited by some historians including Tang Hao, Xu Zhen and Ryuchi Matsuda. This argument is summarized by modern historian Lin Boyuan in his \"Zhongguo wushu shi\": \nThe oldest available copy was published in 1827. The composition of the text itself has been dated to 1624. Even then, the association of Bodhidharma with martial arts only became widespread as a result of the 1904–1907 serialization of the novel \"The Travels of Lao Ts'an\" in \"Illustrated Fiction Magazine\":\nOther scholars see an earlier connection between Da Mo and the Shaolin Monastery. Scholars generally accept the historicity of Da Mo (Bodhidharma) who arrived in China from his country India around 480. Da Mo (Bodhidharma) and his disciples are said to have lived a spot about a mile from the Shaolin Temple that is now a small nunnery. \nIn the 6th century, around 547, The Record of the Buddhist Monasteries says Da Mo visited the area near Mount Song. In 645 The Continuation of the Biographies of Eminent Monks describes him as being active in the Mount Song region. Around 710 Da Mo is identified specifically with the Shaolin Temple (Precious Record of Dharma's Transmission or Chuanfa Baoji) and writes of his sitting facing a wall in meditation for many years. It also speaks of Huikes many trials in his efforts to receive instruction from Da Mo. In the 11th century a (1004) work embellishes Da Mo legends with great detail. A stele inscription at the Shaolin Monastery dated 728 reveals Da Mo residing on Mount Song. Another stele in 798 speaks of Huike seeking instruction from Da Mo. Another engraving dated 1209 depicts the barefoot saint holding a shoe according to the ancient legend of Da Mo. A plethora of 13th- and 14th-century steles feature Da Mo in Various roles. One 13th-century image shows him riding a fragile stalk across the Yangtze River. In 1125 a special temple was constructed in his honor at the Shaolin Monastery.\n\nThe monastery has been destroyed and rebuilt many times. During the Red Turban Rebellion in the 14th century, bandits ransacked the monastery for its real or supposed valuables, destroying much of the temple and driving the monks away. The monastery was likely abandoned from 1351 or 1356 (the most likely dates for the attack) to at least 1359, when government troops retook Henan. The events of this period would later figure heavily in 16th-century legends of the temple's patron saint Vajrapani, with the story being changed to claim a victory for the monks, rather than a defeat.\n\nIn 1641, rebel forces led by Li Zicheng sacked the monastery due to the monks' support of the Ming dynasty and the possible threat they posed to the rebels. This effectively destroyed the temple's fighting force. The temple fell into ruin and was home to only a few monks until the early 18th century, when the government of the Qing dynasty patronized and restored the temple.\n\nPerhaps the best-known story of the Temple's destruction is that it was destroyed by the Qing government for supposed anti-Qing activities. Variously said to have taken place in 1647 under the Shunzhi Emperor, in 1674, 1677, or 1714 under the Kangxi Emperor, or in 1728 or 1732 under the Yongzheng Emperor, this destruction is also supposed to have helped spread Shaolin martial arts through China by means of the five fugitive monks. Some accounts claim that a supposed southern Shaolin Temple was destroyed instead of, or in addition to, the temple in Henan: Ju Ke, in the \"Qing bai lei chao\" (1917), locates this temple in Fujian province. These stories commonly appear in legendary or popular accounts of martial history, and in \"wuxia\" fiction.\n\nWhile these latter accounts are popular among martial artists, and often serve as origin stories for various martial arts styles, they are viewed by scholars as fictional. The accounts are known through often inconsistent 19th-century secret society histories and popular literature, and also appear to draw on both Fujianese folklore and popular narratives such as the classical novel \"Water Margin\". Modern scholarly attention to the tales is mainly concerned with their role as folklore.\n\nThere is evidence of Shaolin martial arts being exported to Japan since the 18th century. Martial arts such as Okinawan Shōrin-ryū (小林流) style of Karate, for example, has a name meaning \"Shaolin School\" and the Japanese Shorinji Kempo (少林寺拳法) is translated as \"Shaolin Temple Fist Method\". Other similarities can be seen in centuries-old Chinese and Japanese martial arts manuals.\n\nIn 1928, the warlord Shi Yousan set fire to the monastery, burning it for over 40 days, destroying a significant percent of the buildings, including many manuscripts of the temple library.\n\nThe Cultural Revolution launched in 1966 targeted religious orders including the monastery. The five monks who were present at the monastery when the Red Guards attacked were shackled and made to wear placards declaring the crimes charged against them. The monks were jailed after publicly being flogged and paraded through the street as people threw rubbish at them. The government purged Buddhist materials from within the monastery walls, leaving it barren for years.\n\nMartial arts groups from all over the world have made donations for the upkeep of the temple and grounds, and are subsequently honored with carved stones near the entrance of the temple.\n\nIn the past, many have tried to capitalise on Shaolin Monastery fame by building their own schools on Mount Song. However, the Chinese government eventually outlawed this; the schools were moved to the nearby towns.\nA dharma gathering was held from August 19 to August 20, 1999, in Shaolin Monastery for Shi Yongxin's assumption of office as abbot. In March 2006, Russian President Vladimir Putin became the first foreign leader to visit the monastery. In 2007, the Chinese government partially lifted the 300-year ban of the Jieba, the ancient ceremony of the nine marks which are burned onto the head with sticks of incense. The ban was lifted only for those who were mentally and physically prepared to participate in the tradition.\n\nTwo modern bathrooms were recently added to the temple for use by monks and tourists. The new bathrooms reportedly cost three million yuan to build. Films have also been released like \"Shaolin Temple\" and more recently, \"Shaolin\" starring Andy Lau.\n\nIn 1994 the temple registered its name as a trademark. In the late 2000s, Shi Yongxin began authorizing Shaolin branches outside of mainland China in what has been called a franchise scheme. The branches are run by current and former monks and allow dispersion of Shaolin culture and study of Shaolin kung fu around the world. As of January, 2011, Yongxin and the temple operated over 40 companies in cities across the world, including London and Berlin, which have purchased land and property.\n\nIn 2018, for the first time in its 1500-year history, the Shaolin Monastery raised the national flag as a part of a \"patriotism drive\" under the new National Religious Affairs Administration, a part of the United Front Work Department which \"oversees propaganda efforts as well as relations with the global Chinese diaspora\". Senior theology lecturer Sze Chi Chan of Hong Kong Baptist University analyzes this move as Xi Jinping making an example of the Shaolin Monastery to send a message to other temples and the Chinese Catholic Church.\n\nThe temple's inside area is , that is, . It has 7 main halls on the axis and 7 other halls around, with several yards around the halls. The temple structure includes:\n\n\nA number of traditions make reference to a Southern Shaolin Monastery located in Fujian province. There has also been a Northern Shaolin monastery in northern China. Associated with stories of the supposed burning of Shaolin by the Qing government and with the tales of the Five Elders, this temple, sometimes known by the name Changlin, is often claimed to have been either the target of Qing forces or a place of refuge for monks displaced by attacks on the Shaolin Monastery in Henan. Besides the debate over the historicity of the Qing-era destruction, it is currently unknown whether there was a true southern temple, with several locations in Fujian given as the location for the monastery. Fujian does have a historic monastery called Changlin, and a monastery referred to as a \"Shaolin cloister\" has existed in Fuqing, Fujian, since the Song dynasty, but whether these have an actual connection to the Henan monastery or a martial tradition is still unknown. The Southern Temple has been a popular subject of \"wuxia\" fiction, first appearing in the 1893 novel \"Shengchao Ding Sheng Wannian Qing\", where it is attacked by the Qianlong Emperor with the help of the White Eyebrow Taoist.\n\n\n"}

The kingdom was founded in 1599 and witnessed the reign of a sole Sultan, Sultan Tengah Manga, known as Ibrahim Ali Omar Shah of Sarawak. The state established close relationship with Brunei, Johor and forged dynastic rules to the surrounding Malay kingdoms in western Borneo including Sambas, Sukadana and Tanjungpura-Matan. The kingdom was dissolved following Sultan Tengah's assassination in 1641. The administration of the territory was then replaced by the local Malay governors appointed from Brunei, reunifying the area into Brunei prior to the White Rajah era.\n\nAccording to the \"Salahsilah Raja-Raja Brunei\" (Bruneian Royal Annals), the state was established following the demise of Sultan Muhammad Hassan, the monarch of Bruneian Empire who ruled between 1582 to 1598. The death of the sultan witnessed the enthronement of Abdul Jalilul Akbar, the eldest prince of Muhammad Hassan as the Sultan of Brunei. However, the crowning of Abdul Jalil Akbar was objected by Pengiran Muda Tengah, claiming that the status of Abdul Jalilul was invalid as the elder prince was born before their father become the Sultan, in contrast to the Pengiran who was born after his father’s ascension to the throne, hence he believed that he had the superior right to inherit the kingdom.\n\nAlready anticipating this dispute, the newly crowned Sultan of Brunei appointed the Pengiran Muda Tengah as the Sultan of Sarawak, a frontier territory far from the central core of the Bruneian kingdom. The departure of the Pengiran was accompanied by more than 1000 soldiers from the Sakai, Kedayan, and Bunut tribes, natives of Borneo. A coterie of Bruneian nobility also followed him to develop the administration system in the new kingdom. Today, a number of Kuching and Sambas Malay community can trace their origin from the pioneers.\n\nThe new Sultan constructed a fortified palace in Sungai Bedil, Santubong, morphing the area into the royal, judicial and administrate capital of the kingdom. He began appoint his deputies and delegates, incorporating the position of Datu Seri Setia, Datu Shahbandar Indera Wangsa, Datu Amar Setia Diraja and Datuk Temenggong Laila Wangsa in the governance system. He proclaimed as the sultan after completing the administration system of the new kingdom, bearing the regal name of Sultan Ibrahim Ali Omar Shah. According to Sambas Royal records, Sultan Tengah Manga was known as Sultan Abdul Jalil.\n\nBy the early 17th century, Sultan Tengah was in Pahang (then an autonomous-kingdom in Johor) to visit his aunt, Raja Bondan, the Queen consort. Before he left, he elected four Datus (nobleman) to administer the kingdom. His aunt was married to the sultan, Abdul Ghafur Muhiuddin Shah. While in Johor, he was invited to perform a courtly dance. It was during the performance that one of the dancer almost hit the face of Sultan Tengah with a handkerchief, by accident. The furious Sultan Tengah then slapped the dancer. This caused a disappointed by the Sultan of Pahang, he then ordered the Sarawakian Royal entourage to immediately left his kingdom.\n\nWhile based on the Sultanate of Sambas narration, Sultan Tengah was requested to leave the Johorean soil for his refusal to marry Princess Cik Zohra upon the request of his queen aunt.\n\nThe royal entourage was hit by a major storm during their return voyage to Borneo. The vessel was then blew off course and arrived to the shores of the Sukadana Kingdom. The polity of Sukanada was ruled by a Javanese Hindu King, Penambahan Giri Mustika, he was later known as Sultan Muhammad Saifuddin after his conversion to Islam by Sheikh Shamsuddin, a missionary from Mecca. It was also during his time in Sukadana that Sultan Tengah commenced his religious studies under the guidance of Sheikh Shamsuddin.\n\nThe Sultan later wedded Princess Puteri Surya Kesuma, sister of the reigning monarch. He also briefly settled in Sukadana and requested permission to carry out missionary activities to the local populace. His request was permitted and granted the land around the Sambas river to perform his duties. By 1600, he departed Sukadana to Sambas together with an entourage of 40 vessels with armed men.\n\nThe royal entourage arrived and built a settlement around Kuala Bangun, near the Sambas river. It was during the time in Sambas that the Puteri gave birth to a prince, Radin Sulaiman. She later gave birth to following two childrens, Pengiran Badaruddin (later become Pengiran Bendahara Seri Maharaja) and Pengiran Abdul Wahab (Pengiran Temenggong Jaya Kesuma).\n\nLocated further up of the Sambas River, The sultan's arrival in Kota Lama was greatly celebrated by the Ratu Sapundak, the King of Kota Lama who welcomed the Sultan as the royal guest of honour. The King allowed Sultan Tengah to perform his missionary activities to the local populace, despite himself being a Hindu ruler of Majapahit descent. The long stay in Sambas also witnessed the marriage of his Sultan Tengah's prince, Radin Sulaiman to Puteri Mas Ayu Bongsu, the princess of Ratu Sapundak. The royal pair had a son named Radin Bima, who would later become the 2nd Sultan of Sambas.\n\nFollowing the death of Ratu Sapundak, the throne of Sambas was succeeded by Pengiran Prabu Kenchana who appointed Radin Sulaiman as one of his advisers. Historical records narrated that Ratu Sapundak had desired to appoint Sultan Tengah as his successor due to his expertise in governance and administration, although his request was highly objected by the members of Sambas aristocrats due to their religious differences, with the members of the then-Sambas nobility was predominantly of Hindu faith. However, this would change in 1631, when Radin Sulaiman rise to the crown of Sambas, bearing the regal name of Sri Paduka al-Sultan Tuanku Muhammad Safiuddin I, the first muslim ruler of the Sambas Kingdom.\n\nBy 1630, the sultan departed to Matan. In Matan, he married a local princess. The marriage issued a prince, Pengiran Mangku Negara, who later become the Sultan of Matan. It was after a few years in Matan that he decided to return to Sarawak.\n\nAfter staying a few years in Matan, the sultan decided to return to Sarawak. In 1641, he and his party settled in Batu Buaya, Santubong while en route to Sarawak. It was during his time in Batu Buaya that he was assassinated by one of his escorts. When the news of the death of the sultan arrived in Sarawak, Datu Patinggi, Shahbandar Datu, Datu Amar and Datu Temenggong departed to Santubong to complete the funeral rites of the sultan based on the Bruneian Royal customs. The Queen consort, Ratu Surya Kesuma decided to return to the Kingdom of Sukananda after his demise.\n\nThe kingdom was then reunified with Brunei following the death of the popular sultan, marking the end of an era. The local Sarawakian administration was then succeeded to the local governors appointed by the Bruneian monarch.\n\nThe final resting place of the first and the final sultan of Sarawak was discovered in 1993, located in Kampong Batu Buaya. A royal mausoleum was constructed in May 1995 following the rediscovery of the tomb. The monument was visited by Hassanal Bolkiah, the Sultan of Brunei during his state visit to Sarawak in 2007.\n\nThe death of the sultan witnessed the demise of the Sultanate of Sarawak. Nonetheless, his reign was instrumental to the sociopolitical framework of western shores of Borneo. He established his capital in Sungai Bedil which then prospered into Kuching during the White Rajah era. He also had incorporated the position of Datu Patinggi, Shahbandar Datu, Datu Amar and Datu Temenggong in the Sarawak administration system that can be seen today. While his missionary activities also transformed the native Hindu society into a Malay Muslim community in coastal Borneo, while his political marriage and alliances established new dynastic houses to the kingdoms of Sambas and Matan.\n\n"}
{"id": "218211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=218211", "title": "Traditionalist Catholicism", "text": "Traditionalist Catholicism\n\nTraditionalist Catholicism is a movement in favour of restoring many or all of the customs, traditions, liturgical forms, public and private devotions and presentations of the teaching of the Catholic Church before the Second Vatican Council (1962–65). It is associated with an attachment to the pre-1970 Roman Rite Mass, referred to as the Traditional Latin Mass.\n\nTraditionalist Catholics were disturbed by the liturgical transformations of the Second Vatican Council, arguing that it stripped the liturgy of its outward sacredness and made it too Protestant, eroding faith in the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Many also oppose the social teachings given by the Church during and after the Council, and that on ecumenism, claiming that the latter blurs the lines between Catholicism and other religions.\n\nAbout 1% of people who identify as Catholic claim to be \"traditional\", but the number of practicing Catholics who consider themselves \"traditional\" may be as high as 11%. The vast majority of traditional Catholics regard the newer rites of the sacraments and the post-Vatican II popes as valid, and attend traditional Masses offered by diocesan priests, the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest (ICRSS), FSSP, or SSPX. Some attend the Mass as revised in 1969, referred to as the Novus Ordo Mass, if no Traditional Latin Mass is available to them, while regarding it as inferior; others refuse to attend the Novus Ordo Mass, even if there is no Traditional Latin Mass.\n\nThe traditionalist movement traces its roots to at least the early 1970s, when conservative Catholics opposed to or uncomfortable with the social and liturgical changes brought about by Second Vatican Council began to coalesce. In 1970, French Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre founded the Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX), made up of priests who would say only the Traditional Latin Mass and who stood opposed to what he saw as excessive liberal influences in the Church. Over time, Lefebvre's movement grew despite split-offs by various offshoot groups. Some Catholics, many never affiliated with Lefebvre, took the position of sedevacantism, which teaches John XXIII and his successors are heretics and cannot therefore be considered popes, and that the new Church and new expressions of the sacraments are not valid. Other, marginal groups known as conclavists have elected their own popes in opposition to the men generally considered by the world to be the true popes. The Society of Saint Pius V (SSPV) broke off from Lefebvre over its objections to the SSPX's use of the missal of Pope John XXIII, preferring the much older 1570 missal of Pope Pius V, and publicly questioning the legitimacy of the post-Vatican II popes. Lefebvre officially renounced these positions, but his movement still drew the suspicion of Roman authorities. In 1988, he and another bishop consecrated four men as bishops without papal permission, resulting in an \"Latae sententiae\" excommunication for all six men directly involved, not of the Society. The excommunications were lifted for the surviving bishops by Pope Benedict XVI in 2009. Some members of the SSPX, unwilling to participate in what they considered schism, left and founded the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter (FSSP), which celebrates the Traditional Latin Mass but in full communion with the Holy See. During the papacy of Pope Benedict XVI, numerous attempts were made to bring the SSPX back from its separation from the authority of the Church, including the lifting of the excommunications on the four surviving bishops. These failed, but the efforts of the SSPX to negotiate with Rome led to the establishment of the minority SSPX Resistance.\n\nTraditionalist Catholics may be divided into four broad groups.\n\nSince the Second Vatican Council, several traditionalist organizations have been started with or have subsequently obtained approval from the Catholic Church. These organizations accept in principle the documents of the Second Vatican Council, and regard the changes associated with the Council (such as the revision of the Mass) as legitimate, if often prudentially unwise, but celebrate the older forms with the approval of the Holy See.\n\nThere are also multiple monastic communities, including\n\nSee Communities using the Tridentine Mass for a more detailed list.\n\nIn addition, many traditionalist Catholics in good standing with Rome are served by local diocesan or religious priests who are willing and able to offer the traditional rites. Many other Catholics who sympathize with or who identify themselves as traditionalist are not able to attend the traditional liturgy regularly because it is not offered in their area (at least not with regular canonical standing) and attend the Mass of Paul VI, the current ordinary or normal Roman Rite of Mass following the Second Vatican Council. Others may attend the liturgies of Eastern Catholic Churches, if they are available. There are also numerous local and international lay organizations of traditionalist Catholics, such as the youth-groups of Juventutem.\n\nTraditionalist Catholics are considered by some to differ from neo-conservatives in that the neo-conservative bases his entire belief system on the teaching of the present magisterium, while the traditionalist interprets the present with the perspective of the past.\n\nSome traditionalists receive the Sacraments from priests considered suspended \"a divinis\" by Church authorities, though these priests and the Catholics that flock to them affirm their loyalty to the Church, while at the same time affirming that teachings of the Second Vatican Council on ecumenism, religious liberty, and collegiality are inconsistent with Catholic teaching and doctrine. They form what Julie Byrne terms the right wing of independent Catholicism: \"Independents vary widely, ranging from right to left in the political spectrum. On the right traditionalist churches practice versions of Catholicism more conservative than Rome. These include the Society of St. Pius X, founded by Marcel Lefebvre, as well as the Mount St. Michael's community in Spokane, Washington, and actor Mel Gibson's church in Malibu, California, which made headlines when he directed the movie, \"The Passion of the Christ\", in 2004. On the left stand groups such as the Church of Antioch, the Ecumenical Catholic Communion, and the White-Robed Monks of St. Benedict.\"\n\nThe largest priestly society to fit this description is the Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX), which was founded in 1970, with the authorisation of the bishop of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg, by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre. Members of this category view many of the post-Conciliar changes as doctrinally and pastorally unacceptable. They recognise the official Church hierarchy, while generally functioning independently of them and rejecting some decisions which they perceive as inconsistent with the Catholic faith, or ineffective in terms of catechesis and how the Catholic faith is passed down. This way of acting draws accusations of disloyalty and disobedience from many, including from members of the preceding groups that are recognised by the Holy See; on the other hand, the SSPX and groups like them consider their accusers guilty of blind obedience, which is not imposed by—and can be contrary to—the requirements of Catholic faith and morals. Discussions between the SSPX and the Holy See have been in progress for some years. In January 2009 the Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops remitted the excommunications which the Congregation had declared to have been incurred by the Society's bishops in 1988. Bishop Bernard Fellay of the Society expressed his gratitude for this act, though the Society has always held that the excommunications never took effect in the first place (citing canon 1323, §4, canon 1323, 7 and canon 1324, §3; §1, 8 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law). The Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops further expressed the hope that the Society would speedily return to \"full communion\" with the Church by showing \"true fidelity and true acknowledgment of the Magisterium and the authority of the pope\". The SSPX rejects the notion of \"full\" and \"partial\" communion with the Church, insisting that they belong to the Church according to the criteria given by Pope Pius XII, because they have the same faith, celebrate the same Sacraments, and recognise the same hierarchy of the Church. More recently, the Vatican has granted priests of the SSPX the authority to hear confessions and has authorised local ordinaries, in certain circumstances, to grant delegation to SSPX priests to act as the qualified witness required for valid celebration of marriage. In each of these documents the hope was expressed that thereby \"the process towards full institutional regularisation may be facilitated\".\n\nSedevacantists hold that the post-Vatican II popes have forfeited their position through their acceptance of heretical teachings connected with the Second Vatican Council and consequently there is at present no known true pope. They conclude, on the basis of their rejection of the revised Mass rite and their rejection of certain aspects of postconciliar Church teaching as false, that the popes involved are also false. This is a minority position among traditionalist Catholics and a highly divisive one, so that many who hold it prefer to say nothing of their view, while other sedevacantists have accepted episcopal ordination from sources such as Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục.\n\nThe terms \"sedevacantist\" and \"sedevacantism\" derive from the Latin phrase \"sede vacante\" (\"while the chair/see [of Saint Peter] is vacant\"), a term normally applied to the period between the death or resignation of one pope and the election of his successor.\n\nThe best-known, and likely best-organized Sedevacantist organization is the Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen (CMRI). Many often refer to the Society of Saint Pius V (SSPV) as being a Sedevacantist organization as well; however, it has never formally adopted this position and considers the question of the validity of recent Papacies to be unresolved.\n\nConclavism is the belief and practice of some who, claiming that all recent occupants of the papal see are not true popes, elect someone else and propose him as the true pope to whom the allegiance of Catholics is due. They are often classified as sedevacantists because they reject the official papal succession for the same reasons. Conclavist groups include the\n\n\nThe Palmarian Church has drastically altered its worship and doctrines and as such is no longer considered Catholic by other traditionalists.\n\nTraditionalist Catholics believe that they are preserving Catholic orthodoxy by not accepting all changes introduced since the Second Vatican Council, changes that some of them have described as amounting to a \"veritable revolution\". They claim that the positions now taken by mainstream Catholics—even conservative Catholics—would have been considered \"modernist\" or \"liberal\" at the time of the Council, and that they themselves hold positions that were then considered \"conservative\" or \"traditional\".\n\nMany traditionalists further believe that errors have crept into the presentation and understanding of Catholic teachings since the time of the Council. They attribute the blame for this to liberal interpretations of the documents produced by the Second Vatican Council, to harmful post-conciliar pastoral decisions, to the text of the conciliar documents themselves, or to some combination of these.\n\nMost traditionalists view the Council as a valid, albeit problematic, Ecumenical Council of the Catholic Church, though most sedevacantists regard it as wholly invalid. It is common for traditionalists in dispute with Rome to affirm that the Council was \"pastoral\", and hence that its decrees were not absolutely binding on Catholics in the same way as the dogmatic decrees of other Ecumenical Councils. Support for this view is sought in Pope John XXIII's \"Opening Address to the Council\", Pope Paul VI's closing address, statements from Pope Benedict XVI, and the lack of formal dogmatic definitions in the Conciliar documents.\n\nPope Benedict XVI contrasted the \"hermeneutic of discontinuity and rupture\" that some apply to the Council (an interpretation adopted both by certain traditionalists and by certain \"progressives\") with the \"hermeneutic of reform, as it was presented first by Pope John XXIII in his Speech inaugurating the Council on 11 October 1962 and later by Pope Paul VI in his Discourse for the Council's conclusion on 7 December 1965.\" He made a similar point in a speech to the bishops of Chile in 1988, when he was still Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger:\n[Archbishop Lefebvre] declared that he has finally understood that the agreement he signed aimed only at integrating his foundation into the 'Conciliar Church'. The Catholic Church in union with the Pope is, according to him, the 'Conciliar Church' which has broken with its own past. It seems indeed that he is no longer able to see that we are dealing with the Catholic Church in the totality of its Tradition, and that Vatican II belongs to that.\n\nThere is some tension between different traditionalist groups at the official level: the SSPX, for example, condemns the FSSP and attendance at its Masses and is also often in conflict with other traditionalists. In fact, the common denominator that is held by all the groups identifying as traditionalist is love of the traditional form of the Mass and the other sacraments, traditional devotions, a handful of teachings that they claim have become obscured since the Second Vatican Council, and, usually, suspicion of modern \"neoconservative\" Catholicism, which is viewed as shallow, ahistorical, and intellectually dishonest. On other questions, there are a variety of opinions.\n\nMany traditionalist Catholics associate themselves with a particular priestly society. Other small groups of traditionalists sometimes form around an individual \"independent\" priest who has no ties with any particular organisation.\n\nSome leaders of Independent Catholic Churches also claim to be traditionalist Catholics and to be preserving the Tridentine Mass and ancient traditions. Examples are the Apostolic Catholic Church, the Canonical Old Roman Catholic Church, and the Fraternité Notre-Dame.\n\nTraditionalists' claims that substantive changes have taken place in Catholic teaching and practice since the Council often crystallise around the following specific alleged examples, in which others see not what Pope Benedict XVI called \"discontinuity and rupture\", but what he called \"renewal in the continuity of the one subject-Church which the Lord has given to us\":\n\nGeorges de Nantes, a priest of the Diocese of Grenoble and founder of the traditionalist Catholic League for Catholic Counter-Reformation, criticized the Second Vatican Council for encouraging ecumenism and reform of the Church, and accused Pope Paul VI of heresy and of turning the Church into a movement for advancing democracy, a system of government that de Nantes abhorred. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a notification on 10 August 1969, stating that, as de Nantes continued to maintain his views on the Council, the \"aggiornamento\" of the Church, the French episcopate, and the \"heresies\" of Pope Paul VI, he thereby \"disqualified the entirety of his writings and his activities\". It issued another notification in 1983, published on \"L'Osservatore Romano\" of 16–17 May of that year, stating that de Nantes had come to Rome to present a \"Book of Accusation against Pope John Paul II for Heresy, Schism and Scandal\", and that the Secretary of the Congregation had received him, as instructed by the Pope, but had refused to accept from him a book that contained unjustified gravely offensive accusations of the same character as those that de Nantes had directed against Pope Paul VI in a book published in 1973. It added that the refusal of de Nantes to retract his previous attacks on Pope Paul VI and the Second Vatican Council, to which he was now adding attacks on Pope John Paul II, made it impossible to believe in the sincerity of his declaration in 1978 and 1981 of a desire for the reconciliation for which the Pope remained always disposed.\n\nThose who in response to these criticisms by certain traditionalists defend the decisions of the Second Vatican Council and the subsequent changes made by the Holy See make the following counterclaims:\n\nSedevacantists claim that they avoid much of the mainstream Catholic critique of traditionalism because their view is that, beginning with John XXIII or Paul VI, one or both of whom and all their successors they consider to be heretics, there is no valid Catholic Pope or body of bishops to whom allegiance or obedience is owed. They criticise non-sedevacantist traditionalists for recognising the recent Popes, on grounds such as the following:\n\n\"Integrism\" is a term used to describe traditionalist Catholicism especially in a social and political context. Kay Chadwick writes: \"It would be naive to suppose that [Catholic integrism] does not harbour a political agenda. It is both anti-Masonic and anti-Communist. It finds a voice in the Right-wing press. ... The annual Joan of Arc procession in Paris brings together integrists and National Front supporters. The annual National Front party celebration is preceded by a Latin Mass, celebrated in the pre-1970 form. Just before his death in March 1988, Lefebvre was fined eight thousand francs by the Court of Appeal in Paris for 'racial defamation' and 'incitement to racial hatred', for suggesting publicly that immigrants, beginning with Muslims, should be expelled from Europe. In 1976, he declared his support for Latin American dictatorships. He was an admirer of Maurras and Pétain, and supported the cause of French Algeria.\"\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) used the terms \"radical traditionalist Catholics\" to describe those who \"may make up the largest single group of serious anti-Semites in America, subscribe to an ideology that is rejected by the Vatican and some 70 million mainstream American Catholics. Many of their leaders have been condemned and even excommunicated by the official church.\" The SPLC claims that adherents of radical traditional Catholicism \"routinely pillory Jews as 'the perpetual enemy of Christ'\", reject the ecumenical efforts of the Vatican, and sometimes assert all recent Popes are illegitimate. The SPLC says that adherents are \"incensed by the liberalizing reforms\" of the Second Vatican Council (1962–65) which condemned hatred for Jewish people and \"rejected the accusation that Jews are collectively responsible for deicide in the form of the crucifixion of Christ\" and that \"Radical traditional Catholics\" also embrace \"extremely conservative social ideals with respect to women.\"\n\nThe SPLC clarifies, however, \"Radical traditionalists are not the same as Catholics who call themselves 'traditionalists' — people who prefer the old Latin Mass to the mass now typically said in vernacular languages — although the radicals, as well, like their liturgy in Latin.\"\n\nThe best-known and most visible sign of Catholic traditionalism is an attachment to the form that the Roman Rite liturgy of the Mass had before the liturgical reform of 1969–1970, in the various editions of the Roman Missal published between 1570 and 1962. This form is generally known as the Tridentine Mass, though traditionalists usually prefer to call it the \"Traditional Mass\". Many refer to it as the \"Latin Mass\", though the Mass of Paul VI that replaced it can also be celebrated in Latin (Latin is the original language of all liturgical documents in the Roman Rite). In his 2007 motu proprio \"Summorum Pontificum\" Pope Benedict XVI relaxed the regulations on use of the 1962 Missal, designating it \"an extraordinary form of the Roman Rite\". Some refer to it, less exactly, as \"\"the\" extraordinary form\".\n\nDifferent traditionalist priests use different editions of the Roman Missal to celebrate the Tridentine Mass. Most, not only those in good standing with the Holy See but also such as those in the SSPX, use the 1962 edition, the only one that the Holy See authorises. A series of modifications to the 1962 liturgy introduced in 1965 are used by some traditionalists in good standing with Rome. This version of the liturgy is sometimes referred to as that of the \"1965 Missal\", though no new edition of the Roman Missal was in fact published in that year.\n\nSince sedevacantists consider John XXIII not to have been a Pope, they reject the 1962 typical edition of the Roman Missal, which he promulgated. They generally use the 1920 typical edition, updated to some date previous to 1962. The Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen follows the Missal as in 1955, accepting the changes introduced by Pius XII, but others reject his alteration of the calendar of saints and his revision of the rites of Holy Week. Thus these others reject both John XXIII's 1962 edition and Pius XII's changes, seeing them as steps that led to the Novus Ordo Missae. There are no reports of priests regularly using any typical edition of the Missal earlier than that of 1920, which incorporated the rubrical and calendar changes made by Pope Pius X in 1910.\n\nLinked with the celebration of the Tridentine Mass is the observance of the liturgical calendar of saints' days as it existed before the revision of 1969 (see General Roman Calendar of 1960). Some also ignore the revisions of 1960 by Pope John XXIII, and of 1955 by Pope Pius XII, and use instead the General Roman Calendar of 1954.\n\nMany traditionalist Catholics lay stress on following customs prevailing immediately before the Second Vatican Council, such as the following:\n\nThese practices are, of course, not confined to traditionalists: many mainstream Catholics also follow them. Likewise, they are not all followed by all traditionalist Catholics at all times.\n\nOpposition to the Post-Conciliar doctrine and attempts to remove Roman Rite borrowings have caused a very small Traditionalist backlash in the Eastern Catholic Churches as well. The dispute has been most highly publicized within the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. In some other Eastern Catholic Churches, however, there are small numbers who try to hold to practices as they were before the 1958 death of Pope Pius XII.\n\nThe Holy See has argued since before the Second Vatican Council that Latinization was never an organic development. Frequently cited examples of this are Pope Leo XIII's 1894 encyclical \"Orientalium dignitas\" and Saint Pius X's instructions that the priests of the Russian Byzantine Catholic Church should offer the Liturgy, \"No More, No Less, and No Different,\" than the Orthodox and Old Ritualist clergy.\n\nLiturgical De-Latinization began with the 1930s corrections of the liturgical books by Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky. According to his biographer Cyril Korolevsky, however, Metropolitan Andrey opposed the use of coercive force against those who remained attached to Latin Rite practices. He expressed fear that any attempt to do so would lead to a Greek Catholic equivalent of the 1666 Schism within the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nThe De-Latinisation of the UGCC gained further momentum with the 1964 decree \"Orientalium Ecclesiarum\" of the Second Vatican Council) and several subsequent documents. This resulted in the Latinisations being discarded within the Ukrainian diaspora. The Soviet annexation of Western Ukraine had meanwhile forced Byzantine Catholics into a clandestine existence and the Latinizations continued to be widely used in underground parishes, seminaries, and religious communities. After the prescription against the UGCC was lifted in 1989, numerous UGCC priests and Hierarchs arrive from the diaspora and attempted to enforce liturgical conformity. This has provoked widespread opposition.\n\nThe Priestly Society of Saint Josaphat, which operates a seminary, Basilian convent, and numerous parishes, alleges ties to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, while simultaneously receiving priestly orders from the bishops of the SSPX. The PSSJ's superior, Father Basil Kovpak, has accused the UGCC hierarchy of using intense psychological pressure against priests who are reluctant or unwilling to de-Latinise. He alleges that numerous laity, who have been attached to the Latinisations since the Soviet persecution of the UGCC, would prefer to stay home on Sunday rather than attend a de-Latinised liturgy.\n\nThe SSJK opposes the removal of the stations of the cross, the rosary and the monstrance from the liturgy and parishes of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. They also reject the replacement of the UGCC's liturgical language, Old Church Slavonic, with the vernacular Ukrainian language. In his memoir \"Persecuted Tradition\", Fr. Kovpak also cites numerous examples of the UGCC turning away Orthodox clergy and laity who wish to convert to Eastern Catholicism. In many cases, he alleges, this is because the converts are not ethnically Ukrainian.\n\nIn 2003, Cardinal Lubomyr excommunicated SSJK superior Kovpak from the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Kovpak appealed this punishment at the papal Sacra Rota Romana in Vatican City and the excommunication was declared null and void by reason of a lack of canonical form.\n\nIn 2006, the SSJK got Latin Bishop Richard Williamson, at that time a member of the SSPX, to ordain two priests and seven deacons in Warsaw, Poland, an action that violated canons 1015 §2, 1021 and 1331 §2 of the Code of Canon Law and the corresponding canons of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches. Archbishop Ihor Vozniak of Lviv, the archdiocese in which the PSSJ is most active, denounced the ordinations as a \"criminal act\", and condemned Kovpak's participation in the ceremony. He stressed that the two priests whom Bishop Williamson had ordained would not receive faculties within the archeparchy. Officials of the Lviv archdiocese said that Kovpak could face excommunication, and that \"'he deceives the church by declaring that he is a Greek (Byzantine) Catholic priest,' while supporting a group \"[SSPX]\" that uses the old Latin liturgy exclusively, eschewing the Byzantine tradition, and does not maintain allegiance to the Holy See.\"\n\nFather Kovpak's excommunication process was restarted by the hierarchy of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church and was confirmed by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on 23 November 2007.\n\nOn 3 March 2008 a group of Basilian priests stationed in Pidhirtsi, Ukraine, informed Pope Benedict XVI that four of them had been consecrated as bishops in order to save the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC) from heresy and apostasy. On 11 August 2009, they announced the formation of the Ukrainian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church as a \"new Church structure for the orthodox faithful of the UGCC\", professing the Catholic faith, including the primacy of the Roman Pontiff, and disassociating themselves from \"contemporary heresies which destroy both the Eastern and the Western Church\". Having elected their own patriarch, they declared on 1 May 2011 that both Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI were excommunicated, leaving the Holy See vacant; they added: \"The Byzantine Catholic Patriarchate is now commissioned by God to protect the orthodox doctrine of the Catholic Church, including the Latin Church. Only after an orthodox Catholic hierarchy and an orthodox successor to the Papacy is elected, will the Patriarchate be relieved of this God-given duty.\"\n\nThe Holy See recognises as fully legitimate the preference that many Catholics have for the earlier forms of worship. This was apparent in Pope John Paul II's 1988 apostolic letter \"Ecclesia Dei\" and Pope Benedict XVI's 2007 motu proprio \"Summorum Pontificum\". Naturally, however, the Holy See does not extend its approval to those who take a stand against the present-day Church leadership.\n\nThe Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei was founded in July 1988 in the wake of Pope John Paul II's apostolic letter \"Ecclesia Dei\". Pope Benedict XVI was a member of the Commission during his tenure as Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.\nSpeaking on 16 May 2007 to the Fifth General Conference of the Bishops of Latin America and the Caribbean, Cardinal Castrillón, the current head of the Commission, stated that his department had been founded for the care of those \"traditionalist Catholics\" who, while discontented with the liturgical reform of the Second Vatican Council, had broken with Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, \"because they disagreed with his schismatic action in ordaining Bishops without the required papal mandate\". He added that at present the Commission's activity is not limited to the service of those Catholics, nor to \"the efforts undertaken to end the regrettable schismatic situation and secure the return of those brethren belonging to the Fraternity of Saint Pius X to full communion.\" It extends also, he said, to \"satisfying the just aspirations of people, unrelated to the two aforementioned groups, who, because of their specific sensitiveness, wish to keep alive the earlier Latin liturgy in the celebration of the Eucharist and the other sacraments.\"\n\nIn the same speech Cardinal Castrillón indicated that it was intended to make the Commission an organ of the Holy See for the purpose of preserving and maintaining the traditional liturgy; at the same time he stated that this was not with the purpose of \"going backward, of returning to the times before the 1970 reform... The Holy Father wishes to preserve the immense spiritual, cultural and aesthetic treasure linked with the old liturgy. Recovery of these riches goes together with the no less precious riches of the Church's present liturgy.\"\n\nFollowing months of rumour and speculation, Pope Benedict XVI issued the motu proprio \"Summorum Pontificum\" in July 2007. The Pope ruled that priests of the Latin Rite can freely choose between the 1962 Roman Missal and the later edition \"in Masses celebrated without the people\". Such celebrations may be attended by those who spontaneously ask to be allowed. Priests in charge of churches can permit stable groups of laypeople attached to the earlier form to have Mass celebrated for them in that form, provided that the celebrating priest is \"qualified to [celebrate] and not juridically impeded\" (this would exclude traditionalist priests not in good standing with Rome).\n\nThe document, as well as being welcomed by the traditionalist groups that have been in good relations with Rome, has been considered by groups such as the Sons of the Most Holy Redeemer, which have been in dispute with Rome, to be sufficient grounds for seeking an agreement. The Society of Saint Pius X welcomed the document, but referred to \"difficulties that still remain\", including \"disputed doctrinal issues\" and the notice of excommunication that still affected its bishops. Sedevacantists of course consider all documents issued by Benedict XVI to be devoid of canonical force.\n\nThe conferring of holy orders may be valid but illicit. The Catholic Church obviously considers the orders of traditionalist clergy who are in good standing with the Holy See, such as the clergy of the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter, to be both valid and licit. It sees as valid but illicit the orders of the bishops and priests of the Society of Saint Pius X, and accordingly considers them to be forbidden by law to exercise priestly offices, but still technically priests. As for the \"independent\" traditionalists, whether bishops or priests, it certainly sees their ordination as illicit, but its judgement on the validity is less clear. The Holy See declared devoid of canonical effect the consecration ceremony conducted by Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục for the Carmelite Order of the Holy Face group at midnight of 31 December 1975, while expressly refraining from pronouncing on its validity. It made the same statement with regard also to any later ordinations that those bishops might confer, saying that, \"as for those who have already thus unlawfully received ordination or any who may yet accept ordination from these, whatever may be the validity of the orders (\"quidquid sit de ordinum validitate\"), the Church does not and will not recognise their ordination (\"ipsorum ordinationem\"), and will consider them, for all legal effects, as still in the state in which they were before, except that the ... penalties remain until they repent.\"\n\nTraditionalists themselves are divided on the question of the validity of the orders conferred using the rite promulgated by Pope Paul VI in 1968. Those who deny or put in doubt the validity of the sacramental liturgies as revised after the Second Vatican Council pass the same negative judgement on all such ordinations. The Society of Saint Pius V split from that of Saint Pius X for reasons that included Archbishop Lefebvre's acceptance of priests ordained according to the revised sacramental rites as members of the traditionalist Society that he founded.\n\nAccording to the Vatican's \"Statistical Yearbook of the Church\", the Catholic Church's worldwide recorded membership at the end of 2005 was 1,114,966,000. Estimates of the number of traditionalist Catholics vary. Catholic World News reported that \"the Vatican\" estimated the number of those served by the Fraternity of St Peter, the Society of St Pius X and similar groups at \"close to 1 million\". Various sources estimate the adherents of the Society of St Pius X alone at 1 million. No major religious survey has ever made an attempt to sample and enumerate subsets of Catholics by their position on a liberal to mainstream conservative to traditionalist and sedevacantist continuum, so any figure on the numbers of traditionalist Catholics must by necessity be more or less educated guesses.\n\nThe two most prominent societies of traditionalist priests – the SSPX and the FSSP – claim to have a presence in 31 and 14 countries respectively. A large share of their members in each case are stationed in France. Two other societies, the SSPV and CMRI, are based in the United States and also claim a presence in many countries, especially the CMRI. Traditionalist Catholics in English-speaking countries and Germany are more likely to be sedevacantist than those in France and other Latin countries.\n\nAccording to one writer, one percent of people who claim to be Catholic identify as \"traditional Catholics\"; the same writer says that \"the Vatican and the SSPX seem to agree that there are about 0.01% of Catholics world-wide are members or traditional Catholics\"; on the basis of \"an educated guess\", he calculates that 80% of \"Traditional Catholics\" are practicing, dynamic Catholics, and on the basis of research that only 7% of Catholics are \"dynamic Catholics\" concludes that \"groups of traditional Catholics\" represent approximately 11% of \"practicing\" Catholics. For purposes of comparison with mainstream Catholic organisations, the Knights of Columbus in the United States are stated to have 1.7 million members, the Neocatechumenal Way is reported to have around 1 million members, and Opus Dei is claimed to have 87,000 members.\n\nAnother comparison is that Eastern Rite Catholics number 16 million. Approximately 7,650,000 belong to the fourteen Catholic Churches of Byzantine Rite, whether they attend the Divine Liturgy in that liturgical rite or in another, and 8,300,000 belong to other Eastern Catholic Churches of Armenian, Coptic and Syriac traditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a mixed-genre work which blends experimental theater, prose poetry, short story, and essay with a manifesto on democracy and American power in a post–September 11 world. The book narrates the author's violent displacement from her home in the Battery Park neighborhood in New York City.\n\nPart One, titled as \"Ground Zero\", offers a poetic critique of 21st century capitalism and corporate censorship with its depictions of New York City before and during the September 11 attacks. Part One unfolds through a collection of metafiction, short stories, and essays on American culture since the collapse of the World Trade Center.\n\nIn Part Two, called \"United States of Banana\", the structure radically changes from a collection of fragmented works into an experimental theater work consisting of dramatic and philosophical dialogues. Historical literary characters Hamlet and Zarathustra (Zoroaster) join the author's alter-ego, Giannina, on a quest to liberate the Puerto Rican prisoner Segismundo from the dungeon of the Statue of Liberty where he has been held by his father, the King of the United States of Banana, more than 100 years prior for the crime of having been born. When the king remarries, he frees his son, and for the sake of reconciliation, makes Puerto Rico the fifty-first state and grants American passports to all Latin American citizens.\n\nThe experimental play dramatizes the plight of Latino prisoners in the United States, Puerto Rico's position as an American territory, and Braschi's struggle for liberty. By having the people of Puerto Rico vote on Segismundo's liberty, the work satirizes the three political options of Puerto Rico: statehood, nation, and colony.\n\n\n\nIn 2017, the novel was adapted as a Swedish graphic novel illustrated by Joakim Lindengren.\n\n"}
{"id": "145043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=145043", "title": "Vice", "text": "Vice\n\nVice is a practice, behaviour, or habit generally considered immoral, sinful, criminal, rude, taboo, depraved, or degrading in the associated society. In more minor usage, vice can refer to a fault, a negative character trait, a defect, an infirmity, or a bad or unhealthy habit (such as an addiction to smoking). Vices are usually associated with a transgression in a person's character or temperament rather than their morality. Synonyms for vice include fault, sin, depravity, iniquity, wickedness, and corruption.\n\nThe opposite of vice is virtue.\n\nThe modern English term that best captures its original meaning is the word \"vicious\", which means \"full of vice\". In this sense, the word \"vice\" comes from the Latin word \"vitium\", meaning \"failing or defect\".\n\nDepending on the country or jurisdiction, vice crimes may or may not be treated as a separate category in the criminal codes. Even in jurisdictions where vice is not explicitly delineated in the legal code, the term \"vice\" is often used in law enforcement and judicial systems as an umbrella for crimes involving activities that are considered inherently immoral, regardless of the legality or objective harm involved.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the term \"vice\" is commonly used in law and law enforcement to refer to criminal offences related to prostitution and pornography. In the United States, the term is also used to refer to crimes related to drugs, alcohol, and gambling.\n\nA vice squad, also called a vice unit or a morality squad, is (though not always) a police division, whose focus is to restrain or suppress moral crimes. Though what is considered or accepted as a \"moral\" crime by society often varies considerably according to local laws or customs between nations, countries, or states, it often includes activities such as gambling, narcotics, pornography, and illegal sales of alcoholic beverages. Vice squads do not concentrate on crimes like fraud and murder.\n\nReligious police, for example islamic religious police units or sharia police in certain parts of the Arab-speaking world, are morality squads that also monitors for example dress codes, observance of store-closures during prayer time, consumption of unlawful beverages or foods, unrelated males and females socializing, and homosexual behavior.\n\nIn the Sarvastivadin tradition of Buddhism, there are 108 defilements, or vices, which are prohibited. These are subdivided into 10 bonds and 98 proclivities. The 10 bonds are the following:\n\nChristians believe there are two kinds of vice:\n\nThe first kind of vice, though sinful, is believed less serious than the second. Vices recognized as spiritual by Christians include blasphemy (holiness betrayed), apostasy (faith betrayed), despair (hope betrayed), hatred (love betrayed), and indifference (scripturally, a \"hardened heart\"). Christian theologians have reasoned that the most destructive vice equates to a certain type of pride or the complete idolatry of the self. It is argued that through this vice, which is essentially competitive, all the worst evils come into being. In Christian theology, it originally led to the Fall of Man, and, as a purely diabolical spiritual vice, it outweighs anything else often condemned by the Church.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church distinguishes between vice, which is a habit of sin, and the sin itself, which is an individual morally wrong act. Note that in Roman Catholicism, the word \"sin\" also refers to the state that befalls one upon committing a morally wrong act. In this section, the word always means the sinful act. It is the sin, and not the vice, that deprives one of God's sanctifying grace and renders one deserving of God's punishment. Thomas Aquinas taught that \"absolutely speaking, the sin surpasses the vice in wickedness\". On the other hand, even after a person's sins have been forgiven, the underlying habit (the vice) may remain. Just as vice was created in the first place by repeatedly yielding to the temptation to sin, so vice may be removed only by repeatedly resisting temptation and performing virtuous acts; the more entrenched the vice, the more time and effort needed to remove it. Saint Thomas Aquinas says that following rehabilitation and the acquisition of virtues, the vice does not persist as a habit, but rather as a mere disposition, and one that is in the process of being eliminated. Medieval illuminated manuscripts circulated with colorful schemas for developing proper attitudes, with scriptural allusions modelled on nature: the tree of virtues as blossoming flowers or vices bearing sterile fruit, The Renaissance writer Pietro Bembo is credited with reaffirming and promoting the Christian perfection of classical humanism. Deriving all from love (or the lack thereof) his schemas were added as supplements in the newly invented technology of printing by Aldus Manutius in his editions of Dante's Divine Comedy dating from early in the 16th century.\n\nThe poet Dante Alighieri listed the following seven deadly vices, associating them structurally as flaws in the soul's inherent capacity for goodness as made in the Divine Image yet perverted by the Fall:\n\nThe first three terraces of purgatory expiate the sins which can be considered to arise from love perverted, that is, sins which arise from the heart of the sinner being set upon something which is wrong in the eyes of God. Those being purged here must have their love set upon the right path. The fourth terrace of purgatory expiates the sins which can be considered to arise from love defective, that is, love which, although directed towards the correct subjects is too weak to drive the sinner to act as they should. Those being purged here must have their love strengthened so as to drive them correctly. The fifth, sixth, and seventh terraces of purgatory expiate the sins which can be considered to arise from love excessive, that is, love which although directed towards ends which God considers good is directed towards them too much for the sinner to gain bliss from them, and also so that the sinner is distracted from the love of other things of which God approves. Their love must be cooled to a more sensible level.\n\nThe Qur'an and many other Islamic religious writings provide prohibitions against acts that are seen as immoral.\n\nIbn abi Dunya, a 9th-century scholar and tutor to the caliphs, described seven \"censures\" (prohibitions against vices) in his writings:\n\n\nIn Sanskrit काम (lust) क्रोध (anger) लोभ (greed) मद(pride) मोह (temptation) मत्सर (jealousy)\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is known for endlessly cutting down a self-healing osmanthus tree on the Moon, a divine punishment which has led to his description as the Chinese Sisyphus. In modern Chinese, the \"chengyu\" \"Wu Gang chopping the tree\" () is used to describe any endless toil. The specific reason for his situation has varied in the sources, but Wu Gang's story dates back to at least the Tang dynasty.\n\nAn etiological myth for the moon's phases was that a great forest or great tree grew there, swiftly growing and losing leaves and blossoms over the course of each month. After the expansion of the Chinese cultural area south of the Yangtze River during the Qin and Han dynasties, the lunar trees became associated with the fragrant and white-blossoming osmanthus. This tree flowers during the autumn and promoted the connection of the Chinese harvest celebration with the Moon, a connection still observed during the modern Mid-Autumn Festival. Confections and wine flavored with its blossoms are also still associated with the holiday.\n\nBy the time of the Han, the \"Book of the Master of Huainan\" associated the waxing of the moon with trees growing from the feet of a Chinese immortal.\n\nIn his \"Compendium of\" Materia Medica, Li Shizhen explains that Wu Gang was added to the stories about the holiday from novellas published during the Sui and Tang dynasties.\n\nThe 9th-century \"Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang\" mentions a lunar tree over five hundred feet high and says that Wu Gang of Xihe stood under it. It relates that \"other\" immortals were sent there to chop the tree when they made a mistake.\n\nWu witnessed a liaison between his wife and Yandi's grandson, after the two had already carried on an affair so long it begat three sons. In a rage, Wu murdered his wife's lover but Yandi ordered Wu banished to the Moon, where he would cut down a tree. After each blow, the tree healed itself and Wu was therefore forced to cut at it forever.\n\nAnother version features a cherry bay. In this version, Wu Gang began the attempt to become a Taoist immortal but gave up lazily midway through the process. The Jade Emperor was furious and decided to punish him. The Emperor created a cherry bay on the Moon and Wu Gang was invited to chop it down in order to become an immortal. Wu Gang tried, but again the tree healed itself and the task was impossible. The shadows on the Moon are said to be created by the growing cherry bay.\n\nIn yet another version, Wu found a teacher in the mountains in his quest for immortality. When his teacher taught him to heal, he gave up after three days. When he was taught to play Chinese chess, he gave up after two days. When he was taught the method of eternal life, he gave up after a day. His teacher then sent him to the Moon to chop down the tree.\n\n"}

Prior to Armenia's Christianisation, it was a predominantly Zoroastrian-adhering land.\n\nA number of Zoroastrian fire-altars had been discovered in Christian sanctuaries in Armenia. In various parts of Armenia, Zoroastrianism lingered on for several centuries even after the official adoption of Christianity. The Arsacid dynasty of Armenia, under which Armenia eventually would become a Christian nation, were pious Zoroastrians who invoked Mithra as the lord of covenants, as is proper. An episode which illustrates the Armenian Arsacids their observance of the cult is the famous journey of Tiridates I to Rome in A.D. 65-66. The same aforementioned Tiridates I, brother of Vologases I of Parthia and founder of the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia, was a Zoroastrian magus or priest.\n\nIn A.D. 53 the Parthian Arsacid dynasty came into Armenia, the king, Trdat I, is thought to have done a great amount to spread Zoroastrianism in Armenia. According to J. Russel, Zurvanism was the form of Zoroastrianism under Yazdagrird II (438-57), which he promoted in Persian Armenia.\n\nThe Armenian month names show influence of the Zoroastrian calendar.\n\nAn Armenian Christian source, according to which an Zurvanite proselytizer, Mihr-Narseh, spoke of the words openly: \n\nA small minority kept their Zoroatrian faith down through the centuries until the early 20th century, these people were known as the Arewordik / Arevordik (Children of the Sun).

{"id": "2527664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2527664", "title": "Ásatrúarfélagið", "text": "Ásatrúarfélagið\n\nThe Ásatrúarfélagið (, \"Ásatrú Fellowship\") is an Icelandic religious organisation of Heathenry (in Iceland also called \"\", \"faith of the Æsir\"). It was founded on the First Day of Summer 1972, and granted recognition as a registered religious organization in 1973, allowing it to conduct legally binding ceremonies and collect a share of the church tax.\n\nThe organization was led by farmer and poet Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson from 1972 until his death in 1993. During most of this period membership did not exceed 100 people and after the initial enthusiasm faded, there was little activity. The time of the next high priest, Jörmundur Ingi Hansen (1994–2002), saw considerable growth and activity, including the design of an Ásatrú burial ground. These trends have continued under the present high priest, musician Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson (2003-), and as of January 1st 2018, the organization has 4126 registered members, about one third of whom are women. Since 2002, the number of registered members has grown annually from 8% (2006-2007) to 21% (2011-2012).\n\nÁsatrúarfélagið does not have a fixed religious dogma or theology but the high priests have tended towards a pantheistic worldview. The central ritual is the communal \"blót\" feast but the priests (\"goðar\") also conduct name-giving ceremonies, coming of age rituals, weddings and funerals. The organization has on some occasions taken a stance on political issues, including abortion rights, gay marriage, the separation of church and state, and environmental issues. The organisation is a founding member of the European Congress of Ethnic Religions.\n\nThe idea to found a folk religious organization came about in late winter 1972 in discussions in a café in Reykjavík. The four men who would become the organization's early leaders and ideologues were Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson, a farmer and a traditionalist poet, Jörmundur Ingi Hansen, a jack of all trades and a prominent person in the Reykjavík hippie movement, Dagur Þorleifsson, a journalist and active member of the Reykjavík theosophy lodge, and Þorsteinn Guðjónsson, leader of Félag Nýalssinna, an organization devoted to the theories of Helgi Pjeturss.\n\nSveinbjörn Beinteinsson described the founding of Ásatrúarfélagið as based on a belief in hidden forces in the land and connected to \"the desire that Icelanders could have their own faith, and nourish it no less than imported religions\". Dagur Þorleifsson emphasized that the religion constituted a movement back to nature, seeking refuge from the ills of industrial civilization. One observer traces the origins of the organization to the countercultural and religious waves of the time, as well as to nationalism and the widespread Icelandic interest in spiritism, theosophy and elves.\n\nThe Ásatrú organization was formed on the First Day of Summer 1972 in a meeting at Hótel Borg. In a meeting shortly thereafter Sveinbjörn was chosen as chairman and dubbed \"allsherjargoði\".\n\nShortly before Christmas 1972, Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson and Þorsteinn Guðjónsson visited Ólafur Jóhannesson, minister of justice and ecclesiastical affairs, and expressed interest in registering Ásatrúarfélagið as an official religious organization. The minister at first believed that the request was a joke but when Sveinbjörn and Þorsteinn told him that they were serious he requested additional paperwork. According to Sveinbjörn, shortly after he and Þorsteinn exited the ministry, the lights in the center of town went out due to a thunderstorm, leaving the minister sitting in the dark. The newspaper Vísir wrote about this in a jocular tone, noting that \"the representatives of the Ásatrúarmenn got rather vague answers from the minister, — and apparently that's what Thor the thunder god thought as well, because as the visit was at an end and the minister stood up to follow the guests to the door there was a terrible thunder in the center of Reykjavík, causing damage close to the office of the ministry\".\n\nSigurbjörn Einarsson, Bishop of Iceland, recommended to the ministry that the organization not be granted recognition. In a written opinion, later published, the bishop pointed out that the Icelandic constitution granted everyone a right to \"found organizations to serve god\" and that this assumed a monotheistic outlook. Sigurbjörn cited the opinion of legal scholar Einar Arnórsson, published in 1912, that \"polytheistic religious organizations founded [in Iceland] would therefore not be protected by the constitution\". Sigurbjörn further criticized the application for not including the declaration of an individual stating that he would assume the leadership of the organization. He criticized the organization for having vague teachings and for not including clear documents on them. He also pointed out that the organization had no dedicated house of worship.\n\nIn Sigurbjörn's opinion the most significant effort to revive Germanic folk religion happened in Nazi Germany and was connected to the racial ideology of that regime. He pointed out that the present applicants had hitherto considered themselves followers of the \"Nýall\" theories of Helgi Pjeturss and that these theories contained the same racial elements as the Nazi ideology. The bishop expressed concern over the possible moral teachings of an Ásatrú organization, in particular as regarded individualism, polygamy and security of person. Finally he pointed out that the group applying for recognition was small, consisting of 21 individuals. \"Morgunblaðið\", Iceland's biggest daily newspaper, declared its agreement with the bishop in an editorial. The paper stated that the Christian faith was the \"basis of Icelandic society\" and that \"Christ is enough, though he was not enough for Hitler, Stalin or their followers\".\n\nIn the Asatruers' reply to the bishop's criticism they argued that even Christianity had some polytheistic elements and that Ásatrú could include a belief in a Supreme Being. They denied any association with national socialism and argued that it was doubtful that the Third Reich had any genuine Asatruers while it was certain that a number of Christian sects had cooperated with the Nazis.\n\nÁsatrúarfélagið was officially recognized as a religious organization by the Icelandic government in May, 1973. This gives it the legal right to perform marriages and other ceremonies and also entitles it to a share of the church tax in proportion to its number of adult members.\n\nIn the Althing, Halldór Blöndal and Magnús Jónsson, members of the Independence Party, requested an explanation for why Ólafur Jóhannesson had given legal recognition to Ásatrúarfélagið. The minister defended his decision on the grounds that the constitution granted freedom of association and freedom of religion. Magnús Jónsson argued that the constitution applied freedom of religion only to monotheistic religions and that the recognition of an organization practicing polytheism and idol worship was thus an illegal act. The minister countered that legal scholars had debated whether the clause applied to polytheism.\n\nIn 1975, the Althing changed the law in a way that made it more difficult for new religious organizations to gain recognition.\n\nOn August 5, 1973, Ásatrúarfélagið held the first public outdoor \"blót\" (plural same as singular) in Iceland since public \"blót\" were forbidden by law in the year 1000. The event was held at Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson's farm at Dragháls in pelting rain below a plaster statue of the god Thor made by Jörmundur Ingi Hansen. The blót was described by the newspaper \"Vísir\" as \"vigorous and energetic\" while Sigurður A. Magnússon commented that the historic significance of the event had not been matched by the quality of the ceremony, \"It could hardly have been simpler or more pedestrian\".\n\nÁsatrúarfélagið had received extensive media coverage even in its very early formative stages and by the time of the\nfirst public \"blót\" that attention extended to foreign media and had become disproportionate to the scale of the event with about as many journalists as participants attending.\n\nEarly on, the organization had ambitious plans for building a temple, getting a burial ground, and dividing the land into \"goðorð\", led by individual goðar. However, membership in the organization did not increase as quickly as these goals would have necessitated. In 1973 Ásatrúarfélagið had 58 registered members, in 1974 it had 70 and in 1976 it had 77. As its leaders realized that the organization's more ambitious goals could not be quickly achieved, the society settled down to a low level of activity. In 1983 a \"blót\" had not been held for three years, but one was arranged to provide the makers of a documentary with\nmaterial.\n\nBy the mid-80s, membership in the organization started to rise every year. In 1985 there were 74 members and by 1992 membership had risen to 119. At that point the organization decided that the time had come for increased activity. The same year, Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson published his autobiography.\n\nSveinbjörn Beinteinsson acted as \"allsherjargoði\" from 1972 until his death in December 1993. He lived a simple life on a farm without modern luxuries. A popular grandfatherly figure, he was \"a little eccentric and shy in his role as a media spokesman\". He left a lasting impression in people's minds.\n\nIn late 1993, Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson died and in 1994, elections were held for a new \"allsherjargoði\". The candidates were Jörmundur Ingi Hansen and Haukur Halldórsson. Jörmundur Ingi ran on a platform of continuity while Haukur promised more innovation. Jörmundur Ingi won with 59 votes against 34.\n\nWhile Jörmundur was, like Sveinbjörn, an older man knowledgeable in ancient literature, he differed from his predecessor in his greater skill at dealing with the media. Jörmundur's time as allsherjargoði saw a rapid rise in membership in the organization, going from 172 in 1994 to 628 in 2002. Jörmundur's time also saw an increase in the percentage of women members, going from 13% in 1994 to 21% in 2002.\n\nIn 1999, the organization achieved one of its oldest goals of having a burial ground of its own. The burial ground was designed by Jörmundur Ingi and the first burial took place the same year.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, on the occasion of the 1000 year commemoration of the Christianisation of Iceland, the Icelandic state and the Church of Iceland organized a celebration at Þingvellir. Ásatrúarfélagið had its own annual \"blót\" at Þingvellir at the same time, leading to conflict over the use of facilities with some underlying ideological tensions. In the end, more than 1000 people participated in Ásatrúarfélagið's summer event, more than in any previous ceremony by the organization.\n\nIn 2000, Ásatrúarfélagið passed the Buddhist Association of Iceland and the Icelandic Bahá'i Community to become Iceland's largest non-Christian religious organization.\n\nThe growth of the organization brought with it increased complexity and internal disputes.\n\nIn 2002, the board of directors sacked Jörmundur and installed Jónína Kristín Berg (born 1962) as temporary allsherjargoði. In 2003, musician Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson (born 1958), was chosen as allsherjargoði. As of 2018, he remains in office. The demographic trends of previous years have continued. The number of members went from 628 in 2002 to 4126 in 2018 (from 0.20% to 1.18% of the population of Iceland) while the percentage of women has gone from 21% in 2002 to 33% in 2018.\n\nIn 2006, the Ministry of Justice increased the number of Ásatrú priests allowed to conduct legally binding ceremonies (icelandic:vígsluréttindi) from two (the \"allsherjargoði\" and his substitute) to five. Two of those five priests are women. As of 2018 there are 10 priests who are officially allowed by the government to conduct legally binding ceremonies. \n\nThe website of Ásatrúarfélagið (as of 2009) defines \"Ásatrú\" as belief \"in the Icelandic/Nordic folklore, the spirits and entities the folklore represents, in addition to gods and other beings from the Nordic pantheism\".\n\nFrom the beginning, Ásatrúarfélagið has not had any fixed religious dogma or theology. Individual members have various beliefs (there are, for example, a number of Wiccan members). Though members are not expected to follow the lead of any religious authority, all the high priests have publicly expressed their personal beliefs at one point or another.\n\nSveinbjörn Beinteinsson summarized his religious convictions in his autobiography, saying that he had not a simple religious conviction but a \"somewhat unquiet faith\".\n\nMy faith is based on a constant search but I don't search frantically. It's no use to rush out into space to search for some gods there, if they want to have anything to do with me, they will come. I have often become aware of them, but I don't rush after them or shout at them. I have gotten to know them a bit in myself and also in other people. ... Primarily it is the effects of the great force felt by everyone that make me religious. ... The most remarkable thing about faith is that it gives us growth, the possibility to grow and thrive. And humility cannot be neglected. Without it we cannot live to any useful degree, though of course it has its particular place. But a man who is completely without it is a madman.\n\nIn a 1992 interview, Jörmundur Ingi Hansen expressed his views on various theological subjects, including the nature of the gods and the basis of his Ásatrú beliefs.\n\nFrom my perspective, the world is split into two in its nature, divided into constructive forces, the Æsir, and the destructive forces which we call jötnar. ... Ásatrú or heathenry is basically only to realize this dichotomy and to decide to side with the Æsir. The best way to do that, in my opinion, is to be self-consistent, live in harmony with nature, associate with it with respect and to submit to the public order. ... The gods shape the dwelling places of people, the earth and the solar system out of the material that already exists. To that extent we can look on the forces of nature as the gods themselves and to a large extent that is what people did in antiquity.\n\nIn a 1996 interview, Jónína K. Berg said:\n\nÁsatrú is a pantheistic belief. The earth, the air and the water has great value to us. We are a part of the earth and not its masters.\n\nIn a 2003 interview, Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson summarized his faith.\n\nI believe in a higher power which appears to us in the multiplicity of nature and of human life. We have manifestations of certain primal forces which we regard as gods and we have a division in the roles of the gods. These are powers that are visible, half-visible and sometimes invisible. One could have a long scholarly discussion on the role of individual gods, but in the end this is a question of a feeling for the different aspects of life.\n\nThe central ritual performed by Ásatrúarfélagið is the communal \"blót\" feast. A \"blót\" starts with a \"goði\" hallowing the ceremony with a certain formula and declaring a truce between all present. This is followed by the reciting or chanting of verses from the \"Poetic Edda\". Next, a drinking horn is passed around and participants drink to the gods, the wights and the ancestors. Libations are offered. This initial part of the ceremony, often conducted outdoors, is followed by a communal feast, typically indoors. The feast is often accompanied by musical performances or other forms of entertainment.\n\nIn the early days of the movement, the founders were asked whether they conducted ritual slaughter of animals during \"blót\". The general response was that while this would not be morally problematic it was not practical. Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson commented:\n\nNo, for the simple reason that we can't be bothered. It's far easier to just get a carcass so that's what we do. In earlier times it was normal to slaughter the animal in place because people couldn't store meat. But in modern circumstances it's completely unnecessary and too much trouble.\"\n\nNevertheless, during the first public \"blót\" \"a sympathizing visual artist brought along a live cock and had it beheaded in the kitchen, while the lamb was being cooked\".\n\nÁsatrúarfélagið has since stated that it rejects the use of Ásatrú as a justification for animal sacrifice, as well as for militarism and supremacy ideology.\n\nThe four main \"blót\" are \"Jólablót\" (\"Yule blót\") on the winter solstice, \"Sigurblót\" (\"Victory blót\") on the First Day of Summer, \"Sumarblót\" (\"Summer blót\") on the summer solstice, and \"Veturnáttablót\" (\"Winter Nights blót\") on the First Day of Winter. The organization also holds \"Þorrablót\" and individual \"goðar\" hold local \"blót\" on various occasions.\n\nOther rituals include name-giving ceremonies, \"siðfesta\" (a coming of age ritual), weddings and burials. The first Ásatrú name-giving ceremony took place in November 1973. Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson performed the first Ásatrú wedding ceremony in August 1977, marrying Dagur Þorleifsson and Ingibjörg Hjartardóttir. Since 1999, the organization has its own burial ground and several burials have taken place.\n\nAs a part of the \"Jólablót\", children light candles to celebrate the rebirth of the sun. The organization has intermittently run a Sunday school and a youth group.\n\nIn 2005, a decision was made to sell the organization's property. The property had increased substantially in value since it was bought in 1998. The profit from the sale made building a temple (referred to by the organisation in Icelandic as a \"hof\") a realistic option and an application for a plot of land was sent to the Reykjavík city council. Processing of the application took longer than the organization had hoped for due to political instability in Reykjavík. In January 2008, a plot of land was finally granted in Öskjuhlíð, a wooded hill in Reykjavík 'The temple will be built into the surrounding cliffs and overlooks the beautiful Nauthólsvík beach. Its design is timeless; being neither contemporary nor reminiscent of the Viking era.' Ásatrúarfélagið commissioned five architects to present proposals for a temple building. Those were ready in September 2008. The organization lost a substantial amount of money in the collapse of the Icelandic banks in October 2008 but proceeded with study of different options for a temple building. The architect Magnús Jensson was chosen; it was announced in February 2015 that the temple construction would start in early 2015, and in 2016 that the temple would be completed in 2017. However, technical problems led to a temporary halt in 2017, and at that time completion was not expected until 2018.\n\nÁrni Sverrisson, a member of Ásatrúarfélagið, built a hof at his farm Efri Ás in Skagafjörður from 2010 to 2014. The project started as a small building which eventually grew to 80 square meters. The building was constructed with stone and turf walls, a wooden framework and a turf covered roof. It was named Ásheimar and consecrated by the \"goði\" Jóhanna Harðardóttir in 2014.\n\nIn June 1974 Ásatrúarfélagið issued a press release opposing the legalization of abortion and recommending strict punishment for distributors of narcotics. In April 1975 there was another press release opposing abortion, this time noting that the battle for legalization of abortion could be \"traced to international movements opposed to the Nordic nations and in particular to the Nordic race\". A few days later, Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson stated that this latter press release did not have its origins in any legal meeting of Ásatrúarfélagið and\nonly represented the private opinions of its author.\n\nIn the following years, Ásatrúarfélagið mostly did not involve itself in political questions, though individual members did. Having been unable to advance his racial ideology within Ásatrúarfélagið, Þorsteinn Guðjónsson in 1982 founded a separate organization, \"Norrænt mannkyn\" (\"Nordic Race\"), to lobby for the reduction of immigration and banning of abortion. Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson was active in the peace movement, erecting a \"níðstöng\" against nuclear power in 1985.\n\nSummarizing her 1991 study of Germanic folk religion, literary scholar Stefanie von Schnurbein describes Ásatrúarfélagið as a \"mix of individualistic anarchists, atheistic church opponents, and racist spiritualists\". In a 2001 study of Ásatrú in Iceland, anthropologist María Erlendsdóttir disagreed, pointing out that von Schnurbein's field research included only two interviews with members of the organization and arguing that this was \"not enough to give sound grounds to her accusations\". She further argued that \"the heavy accusations of Von Schnurbein contradict certain clues that Ásatrúarfélagið has an open mind to people of other cultures and races\" and concluded that \"Icelandic paganism in contemporary society has strong roots within folk belief and literary tradition\".\n\nIn a 2000 study of Ásatrúarfélagið, religious studies scholar Michael Strmiska noted that \"Ásatrú movements in America and Scandinavia have been known to espouse racist and Neo-Nazi ideology\" but that he was \"not aware of any member of Icelandic Ásatrú espousing such sentiments or ideology\".\n\nSince early on, environmentalism has been important to members of Ásatrúarfélagið and the organization has been active in environmentalist causes. In October 2003, Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson erected a \"níðstöng\" against the Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant. Jóhanna G. Harðardóttir, a \"goði\", wrote on the occasion: \"We have come to call upon gods and good wights. We intend to ask for mercy for our land and we intend to erect a \"níðstöng\" to those who dishonor their mother, the earth.\"\n\nSince 2007, Ásatrúarfélagið participates in forest reclamation in Heiðmörk with the Icelandic Forestry Association.\n\nThe organization has fought for the right to marry gay couples.\n\nÁsatrúarfélagið has fought for the separation of church and state, and for a share in a fund currently only accessible to the National Church. The Church supports the latter effort. Ásatrúarfélagið cooperates on issues of common concern with other Icelandic religious organizations, in particular the Reykjavík Free Church.\n\nIn 2003, Sigurjón Þórðarson, an active member of Ásatrúarfélagið and a \"goði\", was elected to the Althing for the Liberal Party. When asked if his faith shaped the way he approached laws and the structure of government he replied: \"I’m in favour of separating faith and law, but I do think that faith marks the individual.\"\n\nIn August 2014 Ásatrúarfélagið issued a statement against the abuse of their name and their religion:\nWe strongly oppose any attempt by individuals to use their association with the Ásatrúarfélagið of Iceland to promote attitudes, ideologies and practices rejected by the leadership of the Ásatrúarfélagið. We particularly reject the use of Ásatrú as a justification for supremacy ideology, militarism and animal sacrifice.\nIt should also be known that visitors have no authority to speak on our behalf. There is no advisor to the Ásatrúarfélagið and there is no spokesman other than our allsherjargoði. We respectfully request that visitors not claim any such authority based on their association with us.\n\n\n\n"}
