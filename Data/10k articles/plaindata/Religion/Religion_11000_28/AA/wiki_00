The name as well as the topic of this chapter is jinn. Similar to angels, the Jinn are spiritual beings invisible to the naked human eye. In the Quran, it is stated that humans are created from the earth and jinn from smokeless fire in more than one instance.\n\nIn the second verse the jinn recant their belief in false gods and venerate Muhammad for his monotheism. The jinn apologize for their past blasphemy and criticize mankind for either neglecting them or encouraging their disbelief. Verses 20-22 are especially important as Monotheism (tawhid) among the Jinn is reaffirmed and the inescapable wrath of God is emphasized. The Judgement in verse 7, and the Punishment in verse 25, are both references to the Islamic Judgement Day, Yaum al Qiyamah. Verse 25-28 establish that Qiyamah is known only to God, and that God takes into account all the deeds of a man when judging him.\n\nAlthough \"Al-Jinn\" is a Meccan sura, it is generally agreed that it was revealed much later than any other sura contained in \"Juz' Tabāraka -lladhi\" (which covers suras 67 to 77). Abdullah Yusuf Ali says that it is “tolerably certain” that \"Al-Jinn\" was revealed around 2 B.H. when Muhammad was evangelising near present-day Ta'if. Maulana Muhammad Ali agrees with the date of around 2 B.H., saying that this sura was revealed at a time when opposition to the Holy Prophet’s message was reaching a climax.\n\n"}
{"id": "2974488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2974488", "title": "Anekantavada", "text": "Anekantavada\n\nAccording to Jainism, no single, specific statement can describe the nature of existence and the absolute truth. This knowledge (\"Kevala Jnana\"), it adds, is comprehended only by the Arihants. Other beings and their statements about absolute truth are incomplete, and at best a partial truth. All knowledge claims, according to the \"anekāntavāda\" doctrine must be qualified in many ways, including being affirmed and denied. Anekāntavāda is a fundamental doctrine of Jainism.\n\nThe origins of \"anekāntavāda \" can be traced back to the teachings of Mahāvīra (599–527 BCE), the 24th Jain . The dialectical concepts of \"syādvāda\" \"conditioned viewpoints\" and \"nayavāda\" \"partial viewpoints\" arose from \"anekāntavāda\" in the medieval era, providing Jainism with more detailed logical structure and expression. The details of the doctrine emerged in Jainism in the 1st millennium CE, from debates between scholars of Jain, Buddhist and Hindu schools of philosophies.\n\nThe word \"anekāntavāda\" is a compound of two Sanskrit words: \"anekānta\" and \"vāda\". The word \"anekānta\" itself is composed of three root words, \"an\" (not), \"eka\" (one) and \"anta\" (end, side), together it connotes \"not one ended, sided\", \"many-sidedness\", or \"manifoldness\". The word \"vāda\" means \"doctrine, way, speak, thesis\". The term \"anekāntavāda\" is translated by scholars as the doctrine of \"many-sidedness\", \"non-onesidedness\", or \"many pointedness\".\n\nThe term \"anekāntavāda\" is not found in early texts considered canonical by Svetambara tradition of Jainism. However, traces of the doctrines are found in comments of Mahavira in these Svetambara texts, where he states that the finite and infinite depends on one's perspective. The word anekantavada was coined by Acharya Siddhasen Divakar to significant the teaching of Mahavira that truth can be expressed in infinite ways. The earliest comprehensive teachings of anekāntavāda doctrine is found in the \"Tattvarthasutra\" by Acharya Umaswami, and is considered to be authoritative by all Jain sects. In the Digambara tradition texts. The 'two-truths theory' of Kundakunda also provides the core of this doctrine.\n\nThe Jain doctrine of \"anekāntavāda\", also known as \"anekāntatva\", states that truth and reality is complex and always has multiple aspects. Reality can be experienced, but it is not possible to totally express it with language. Human attempts to communicate is \"naya\", or \"partial expression of the truth\". Language is not Truth, but a means and attempt to express truth. From truth, according to Māhavira, language returns and not the other way around. One can experience the truth of a taste, but cannot fully express that taste through language. Any attempts to express the experience is \"syāt\", or valid \"in some respect\" but it still remains a \"perhaps, just one perspective, incomplete\". In the same way, spiritual truths are complex, they have multiple aspects, language cannot express their plurality, yet through effort and appropriate karma they can be experienced.\n\nThe \"anekāntavāda\" premises of the Jains is ancient, as evidenced by its mention in Buddhist texts such as the \"Samaññaphala Sutta\". The Jain āgamas suggest that Māhavira's approach to answering all metaphysical philosophical questions was a \"qualified yes\" (\"syāt\"). These texts identify \"anekāntavāda\" doctrine to be one of the key differences between the teachings of the Māhavira and those of the Buddha. The Buddha taught the Middle Way, rejecting extremes of the answer \"it is\" or \"it is not\" to metaphysical questions. The Māhavira, in contrast, taught his followers to accept both \"it is\" and \"it is not\", with \"perhaps\" qualification and with reconciliation to understand the absolute reality. \"Syādvāda\" (predication logic) and \"Nayavāda\" (perspective epistemology) of Jainism expand on the concept of \"anekāntavāda\". \"Syādvāda\" recommends the expression of \"anekānta\" by prefixing the epithet \"syād\" to every phrase or expression describing the nature of existence.\n\nThe Jain doctrine of \"anekāntavāda\", according to Bimal Matilal, states that \"no philosophic or metaphysical proposition can be true if it is asserted without any condition or limitation\". For a metaphysical proposition to be true, according to Jainism, it must include one or more conditions (\"syadvada\") or limitations (\"nayavada\", standpoints).\n\n\"Syādvāda\" () is the theory of \"conditioned predication\", the first part of which is derived from the Sanskrit word \"syāt\" (), which is the third person singular of the optative tense of the Sanskrit verb \"as\" (), 'to be', and which becomes \"syād\" when followed by a vowel or a voiced consonant, in accordance with \"sandhi\". The optative tense in Sanskrit (formerly known as the 'potential') has the same meaning as the present tense of the subjunctive mood in most Indo-European languages, including Hindi, Latin, Russian, French, etc. It is used when there is uncertainty in a statement; not 'it is', but 'it may be', 'one might', etc. The subjunctive is very commonly used in Hindi, for example, in 'kya kahun?', 'what to say?'. The subjunctive is also commonly used in conditional constructions; for example, one of the few English locutions in the subjunctive which remains more or less current is 'were it ०, then ०', or, more commonly, 'if it were..', where 'were' is in the past tense of the subjunctive.\n\nSyat can be translated into English as meaning \"perchance, may be, perhaps\" (it is). The use of the verb 'as' in the optative tense is found in the more ancient Vedic era literature in a similar sense. For example, sutra 1.4.96 of Panini's Astadhyayi explains it as signifying \"a chance, maybe, probable\".\n\nIn Jainism, however, \"syadvada\" and \"anekanta\" is not a theory of uncertainty, doubt or relative probabilities. Rather, it is \"conditional yes or conditional approval\" of any proposition, state Matilal and other scholars. This usage has historic precedents in classical Sanskrit literature, and particularly in other ancient Indian religions (Buddhism and Hinduism) with the phrase \"syad etat\", meaning \"let it be so, but\", or \"an answer that is 'neither yes nor no', provisionally accepting an opponent's viewpoint for a certain premise\". This would be expressed in archaic English with the subjunctive: 'be it so', a direct translation of \"syad etat\". Traditionally, this debate methodology was used by Indian scholars to acknowledge the opponent's viewpoint, but disarm and bound its applicability to certain context and persuade the opponent of aspects not considered.\n\nAccording to Charitrapragya, in Jain context \"syadvada\" does not mean a doctrine of doubt or skepticism, rather it means \"multiplicity or multiple possibilities\". \"Syat\" in Jainism connotes something different from what the term means in Buddhism and Hinduism. In Jainism, it does not connote an answer that is \"neither yes nor no\", but it connotes a \"many sidedness\" to any proposition with a sevenfold predication.\n\n\"Syādvāda\" is a theory of qualified predication, states Koller. It states that all knowledge claims must be qualified in many ways, because reality is many-sided. It is done so systematically in later Jain texts through \"saptibhaṅgīnāya\" or \"the theory of sevenfold scheme\". These \"saptibhaṅgī\" seem to be have been first formulated in Jainism by the 5th or 6th century CE Svetambara scholar Mallavadin, and they are:\n\nEach of these seven predicates state the Jain viewpoint of a multifaceted reality from the perspective of time, space, substance and mode. The phrase \"syāt\" declares the standpoint of expression – affirmation with regard to own substance (\"dravya\"), place (\"kṣetra\"), time (\"kāla\"), and being (\"bhāva\"), and negation with regard to other substance (\"dravya\"), place (kṣetra), time (kāla), and being (\"bhāva\"). Thus, for a ‘jar’, in regard to substance (\"dravya\") – earthen, it simply is; wooden, it simply is not. In regard to place (\"kṣetra\") – room, it simply is; terrace, it simply is not. In regard to time (\"kāla\") – summer, it simply is; winter, it simply is not. In regard to being (\"bhāva\") – brown, it simply is; white, it simply is not. And the word ‘simply’ has been inserted for the purpose of excluding a sense not approved by the ‘nuance’; for avoidance of a meaning not intended.\n\nAccording to Samantabhadra's text \"Āptamīmāṁsā\" (Verse 105), \"\"Syādvāda\", the doctrine of conditional predications, and \"kevalajñāna\" (omniscience), are both illuminators of the substances of reality. The difference between the two is that while \"kevalajñāna\" illumines directly, \"syādvāda\" illumines indirectly\". \"Syadvada\" is indispensable and helps establish the truth, according to Samantabhadra.\n\n\"Nayavāda\" () is the theory of standpoints or viewpoints. \"Nayavāda\" is a compound of two Sanskrit words—\"naya\" (\"standpoint, viewpoint, interpretation\") and \"vāda\" (\"doctrine, thesis\"). Nayas are philosophical perspective about a particular topic, and how to make proper conclusions about that topic.\n\nAccording to Jainism, there are seven \"nayas\" or viewpoints through which one can make complete judgments about absolute reality using \"syadvada\". These seven \"naya\", according to Umaswati, are:\n\nThe \"naya\" theory emerged after about the 5th century CE, and underwent extensive development in Jainism. There are many variants of \"nayavada\" concept in later Jain texts.\n\nA particular viewpoint is called a \"naya\" or a partial viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, \"Nayavada\" does not deny the attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them to be from a particular perspective. A \"naya\" reveals only a part of the totality, and should not be mistaken for the whole. A synthesis of different viewpoints is said to be achieved by the doctrine of conditional predications (\"syādvāda\").\n\nAncient India, particularly the centuries in which the Mahavira and the Buddha lived, was a ground of intense intellectual debates, especially on the nature of reality and self or soul. Jain view of soul differs from those found in ancient Buddhist and Hindu texts, and Jain view about \"jiva\" and \"ajiva\" (self, matter) utilizes \"anekantavada\".\n\nThe Upanishadic thought (Hindu) postulated the impermanence of matter and body, but the existence of an unchanging, eternal metaphysical reality of \"Brahman\" and \"Ātman\" (soul, self). The Buddhist thought also postulated impermanence, but denied the existence of any unchanging, eternal soul or self and instead posited the concept of anatta (no-self). According to the vedāntin (Upanishadic) conceptual scheme, the Buddhists were wrong in denying permanence and absolutism, and within the Buddhist conceptual scheme, the vedāntins were wrong in denying the reality of impermanence. The two positions were contradictory and mutually exclusive from each other's point of view. The Jains managed a synthesis of the two uncompromising positions with \"anekāntavāda\". From the perspective of a higher, inclusive level made possible by the ontology and epistemology of \"anekāntavāda\" and \"syādvāda\", Jains do not see such claims as contradictory or mutually exclusive; instead, they are seen as \"ekantika\" or only partially true. The Jain breadth of vision embraces the perspectives of both Vedānta which, according to Jainism, \"recognizes substances but not process\", and Buddhism, which \"recognizes process but not substance\". Jainism, on the other hand, pays equal attention to both substance (\"dravya\") and process (\"paryaya\").\n\nThis philosophical syncretisation of paradox of change through \"anekānta\" has been acknowledged by modern scholars such as Arvind Sharma, who wrote:\nSome Indian writers state that Anekantavada is an inclusivist doctrine positing that Jainism accepts \"non-Jain teachings as partial versions of truth\", a form of sectarian tolerance. Others scholars state this is incorrect and a reconstruction of Jain history because Jainism has consistently seen itself in \"exclusivist term as the one true path\". Classical Jain scholars saw their premises and models of reality as superior than the competing spiritual traditions of Buddhism and Hinduism, both of which Jainism considered inadequate. For instance, the Jain text \"Uttaradhyayana Sutra\" in section 23.63 calls the competing Indian thought to be \"heterodox and heretics\" and that they \"have chosen a wrong path, the right path is that taught by the Jinas\". Similarly, the early Jain scholar Haribhadra, who likely lived between the 6th and 8th century, states that those who do not follow the teachings of Jainism cannot be \"approved or accommodated\".\n\nJohn Koller states \"anekāntavāda\" to be \"epistemological respect for view of others\" about the nature of existence whether it is \"inherently enduring or constantly changing\", but \"not relativism; it does not mean conceding that all arguments and all views are equal\".\n\nIn contemporary times, according to Paul Dundas, the \"Anekantavada\" doctrine has been interpreted by some Jains as intending to \"promote a universal religious tolerance\", and a teaching of \"plurality\" and \"benign attitude to other [ethical, religious] positions\". This is problematic and a misreading of Jain historical texts and Mahavira's teachings, states Dundas. The \"many pointedness, multiple perspective\" teachings of the Mahavira is a doctrine about the nature of Absolute Reality and human existence, and it is sometimes called \"non-absolutism\" doctrine. However, it is not a doctrine about tolerating or condoning activities such as sacrificing or killing animals for food, violence against disbelievers or any other living being as \"perhaps right\". The Five vows for Jain monks and nuns, for example, are strict requirements and there is no \"perhaps, just one perspective\". Similarly, since ancient times, Jainism co-existed with Buddhism and Hinduism, according to Dundas, but Jainism was highly critical of the knowledge systems and ideologies of its rivals, and vice versa.\n\nThe principle of \"anekāntavāda\" is one of the foundational Jain philosophical concept. The development of \"anekāntavāda\" also encouraged the development of the dialectics of \"syādvāda\" (conditioned viewpoints) and \"nayavāda\" (partial viewpoints).\n\nAccording to Karl Potter, the Jain \"anekāntavāda\" doctrine emerged in a milieu that included Buddhists and Hindus in ancient and medieval India. The diverse Hindu schools such as Nyaya-Vaisheshika, Samkhya-Yoga and Mimamsa-Vedanta, all accepted the premise of Atman that \"unchanging permanent soul, self exists and is self-evident\", while various schools of early Buddhism denied it and substituted it with Anatta (no-self, no-soul). Further, for causation theories, Vedanta schools and Madhyamika Buddhists had similar ideas, while Nyaya-Vaisheshika and non-Madhyamika Buddhists generally agreed on the other side. Jainism, using its \"anekāntavāda\" doctrine occupied the center of this theological divide on soul-self (\"jiva\") and causation theories, between the various schools of Buddhist and Hindu thought.\n\nThe origins of \"anekāntavāda\" are traceable in the teachings of Mahāvīra, who used it effectively to show the relativity of truth and reality. Taking a relativistic viewpoint, Mahāvīra is said to have explained the nature of the soul as both permanent, from the point of view of underlying substance, and temporary, from the point of view of its modes and modification.\n\nEarly Jain texts were not composed in Vedic or classical Sanskrit, but in Ardhamagadhi Prakrit language. According to Matilal, the earliest Jain literature that present a developing form of a substantial \"anekantavada\" doctrine is found in Sanskrit texts, and after Jaina scholars had adopted Sanskrit to debate their ideas with Buddhists and Hindus of their era. These texts show a synthetic development, the existence and borrowing of terminology, ideas and concepts from rival schools of Indian thought but with innovation and original thought that disagreed with their peers.\n\nThe early Svetambara canons and teachings do not use the terms \"anekāntavāda\" and \"syādvāda\", but contain teachings in rudimentary form without giving it proper structure or establishing it as a separate doctrine. \"Śvētāmbara\" text, \"Sutrakritanga\" contains references to \"Vibhagyavāda\", which, according to Hermann Jacobi, is the same as \"syādvāda\" and \"saptibhaṅgī\". For example, Jacobi in his 1895 translation interpreted \"vibhagyavada\" as \"syadvada\", the former mentioned in the Svetambara Jain canonical text \"Sutrakritanga\". However, the Digambara Jains dispute this text is canonical or even authentic.\n\nAccording to Upadhyaye, the \"Bhagvatisūtra\" (also called Vyākhyāprajñapti) mentions three primary predications of the \"saptibhaṅgīnaya\". This too is a Svetambara text, and considered by Digambara Jains as unauthentic.\n\nThe earliest comprehensive teachings of anekāntavāda doctrine is found in the \"Tattvarthasutra\" of Umasvati, considered to be authoritative by all Jain sects including Svetambara and Digambara. The century in which Umaswati lived is unclear, but variously placed by contemporary scholars to sometime between 2nd and 5th century.\n\nThe Digambara scholar Kundakunda, in his mystical Jain texts, expounded on the doctrine of \"syādvāda\" and \"saptibhaṅgī\" in \"Pravacanasāra\" and \"Pancastikayasāra\". Kundakunda also used \"nayas\" to discuss the essence of the self in \"Samayasāra\". Kundakunda is believed in the Digambara tradition to have lived about the 1st-century CE, but has been placed by early modern era scholars to 2nd or 3rd century CE. In contrast, the earliest available secondary literature on Kundakunda appears in about the 10th century, which has led recent scholarship to suggest that he may have lived in or after 8th-century. This radical reassessment in Kundakunda chronology, if accurate, would place his comprehensive theories on \"anekantavada\" to the late 1st millennium CE.\n\nThe Jain texts explain the \"anekāntvāda\" concept using the parable of blind men and elephant, in a manner similar to those found in both Buddhist and Hindu texts about limits of perception and the importance of complete context. The parable has several Indian variations, but broadly goes as follows:\n\nThis parable is called \"Andha-gaja-nyaya\" maxim in Jain texts.\n\nTwo of the Jain references to this parable are found in \"Tattvarthaslokavatika\" of Vidyanandi (9th century) and it appears twice in the \"Syādvādamanjari\" of Ācārya Mallisena (13th century). According to Mallisena, whenever anyone takes a partial, unconditional view of the ultimate reality, and denies the possibility of another aspect of that reality, it is an instance of the above parable and a defective view. Mallisena goes further in his second reference to the above parable and states that all reality has infinite aspects and attributes, all assertions can only be relatively true. This does not mean scepticism or doubt is the right path to knowledge, according to Mallisena and other Jain scholars, but that any philosophical assertion is only conditionally, partially true. Any and all viewpoints, states Mallisena, that do not admit an exception are false views.\n\nWhile the same parable is found in Buddhist and Hindu texts to emphasize the need to be watchful for partial viewpoints of a complex reality, the Jain text apply it to isolated topic and all subjects. For example, the \"syadvada\" principle states that all the following seven predicates must be accepted as true for a cooking pot, according to Matilal:\n\n\nĀcārya Haribhadra (8th century CE) was one of the leading proponents of \"anekāntavāda\". He wrote a doxography, a compendium of a variety of intellectual views. This attempted to contextualise Jain thoughts within the broad framework, rather than espouse narrow partisan views. It interacted with the many possible intellectual orientations available to Indian thinkers around the 8th century.\n\nĀcārya Amrtacandra starts his famous 10th century CE work \"Purusathasiddhiupaya\" with strong praise for \"anekāntavāda\": \"I bow down to the principle of \"anekānta\", the source and foundation of the highest scriptures, the dispeller of wrong one-sided notions, that which takes into account all aspects of truth, reconciling diverse and even contradictory traits of all objects or entity.\"\n\nĀcārya Vidyānandi (11th century CE) provides the analogy of the ocean to explain the nature of truth in \"Tattvarthaslokavārtikka\", 116:\n\n, a 17th-century Jain monk, went beyond \"anekāntavāda\" by advocating \"madhāyastha\", meaning \"standing in the middle\" or \"equidistance\". This position allowed him to praise qualities in others even though the people were non-Jain and belonged to other faiths. There was a period of stagnation after Yasovijayaji, as there were no new contributions to the development of Jain philosophy.\n\nThe Jain philosophical concept of Anekantavada made important contributions to ancient Indian philosophy, in the areas of skepticism and relativity. The epistemology of \"anekāntavāda\" and \"syādvāda\" also had a profound impact on the development of ancient Indian logic and philosophy.\n\nWhile employing \"anekāntavāda\", the 17th century Jain scholar Yasovijaya stated that it is not \"anābhigrahika\" (indiscriminate attachment to all views as being true), which is effectively a kind of misconceived relativism. In Jain belief, \"anekāntavāda\" transcends the various traditions of Buddhism and Hinduism.\n\n\"Anekāntavāda\" played a role in the history of Jainism in India, during intellectual debates from Śaivas, Vaiṣṇavas, Buddhists, Muslims, and Christians at various times. According to John Koller, professor of Asian studies, \"anekāntavāda\" allowed Jain thinkers to maintain the validity of their doctrine, while at the same time respectfully criticizing the views of their opponents. In other cases, it was a tool used by Jaina scholars to confront and dispute Buddhist scholars in ancient India, or in the case of Haribhadra justify the retaliation of the killing of his two nephews by Buddhist monks, with capital punishment for all Buddhist monks in the suspected monastery, according to the Buddhist version of Haribhadra's biography.\n\nThere is historical evidence that along with intolerance of non-Jains, Jains in their history have also been tolerant and generous just like Buddhists and Hindus. Their texts have never presented a theory for holy war. Jains and their temples have historically procured and preserved the classic manuscripts of Buddhism and Hinduism, a strong indicator of acceptance and plurality. The combination of historic facts, states Cort, suggest that Jain history is a combination or tolerance and intolerance of non-Jain views, and that it is inappropriate to rewrite the Jainism past as a history of \"benevolence and tolerance\" towards others.\n\nMahatma Gandhi mentioned Anekantavada and Syadvada in the journal \"Young India – 21 Jan 1926\". According to Jeffery D. Long – a scholar of Hindu and Jain studies, the Jain Syadvada doctrine helped Gandhi explain how he reconciled his commitment to the \"reality of both the personal and impersonal aspects of Brahman\", and his view of \"Hindu religious pluralism\":\n\nReferring to the September 11 attacks, John Koller states that the threat to life from religious violence in modern society mainly exists due to faulty epistemology and metaphysics as well as faulty ethics. A failure to respect the life of other human beings and other life forms, states Koller, is \"rooted in dogmatic but mistaken knowledge claims that fail to recognize other legitimate perspectives\". Koller states that \"anekāntavāda\" is a Jain doctrine that each side commit to accepting truths of multiple perspectives, dialogue and negotiations.\n\nAccording to Sabine Scholz, the application of the \"Anekantavada\" as a religious basis for \"intellectual Ahimsa\" is a modern era reinterpretation, one attributed to the writings of A.B. Dhruva in 1933. This view states that \"Anekantavada\" is an expression of \"religious tolerance of other opinions and harmony\". In the 21st century, some writers have presented it as an intellectual weapon against \"intolerance, fundamentalism and terrorism\". Other scholars such as John E. Cort and Paul Dundas state that, while Jainism indeed teaches non-violence as the highest ethical value, the reinterpretation of \"Anekantavada\" as \"religious tolerance of other opinions\" is a \"misreading of the original doctrine\". In Jain history, it was a metaphysical doctrine and a philosophical method to formulate its distinct ascetic practice of liberation. Jain history shows, to the contrary, that it persistently was harshly critical and intolerant of Buddhist and Hindu spiritual theories, beliefs and ideologies. John Cort states that the \"Anekantavada\" doctrine in pre-20th century Jain literature had no relation to religious tolerance or \"intellectual Ahimsa\". Jain intellectual and social history toward non-Jains, according to Cort, has been contrary to the modern revisionist attempts, particularly by diaspora Jains, to present \"Jains having exhibited a spirit of understanding and tolerance toward non-Jains\", or that Jains were rare or unique in practicing religious tolerance in Indian intellectual history. According to Padmanabha Jaini, states Cort, indiscriminate open mindedness and the approach of \"accepting all religious paths as equally correct when in fact they are not\" is an erroneous view in Jainism and not supported by the \"Anekantavada\" doctrine.\n\nAccording to Paul Dundas, in and after the 12th century, the persecution and violence against Jains by Muslim state caused Jain scholars to revisit their theory of Ahimsa (non-violence). For example, Jinadatta Suri in 12th century, wrote during a time of widespread destruction of Jain temples and blocking of Jaina pilgrimage by Muslim armies, that \"anybody engaged in a religious activity who was forced to fight and kill somebody\" in self-defense would not lose any merit. N.L. Jain, quoting Acarya Mahaprajna, states \"Anekantavada\" doctrine is not a principle that can be applied to all situations or fields. In his view, the doctrine has its limits and \"Anekantavada\" doctrine does not mean intellectual tolerance or acceptance of religious violence, terrorism, taking of hostages, proxy wars such as in Kashmir, and that \"to initiate a conflict is as sinful as to tolerate or not oppose it\".\n\nThe reinterpretation of \"Anekantavada\" as a doctrine of religious tolerance is novel, popular but not unusual for contemporary Jains. It is a pattern of reinterpretation and reinvention to rebrand and reposition that is found in many religions, states Scholz.\n\nAccording to Bhagchandra Jain, one of the difference between the Buddhist and Jain views is that \"Jainism accepts all statements to possess some relative (\"anekāntika\") truth\" while for Buddhism this is not the case.\n\nIn Jainism, states Jayatilleke, \"no proposition could in theory be asserted to be categorically true or false, irrespective of the standpoint from which it was made, in Buddhism such categorical assertions were considered possible in the case of some propositions.\" Unlike Jainism, there are propositions that are categorically true in Buddhism, and there are others that are \"anekamsika\" (uncertain, indefinite). Examples of categorically true and certain doctrines are the Four Noble Truths, while examples of the latter in Buddhism are the avyakata-theses. Further, unlike Jainism, Buddhism does not have a Nayavāda doctrine.\n\nAccording to Karl Potter and other scholars, Hinduism developed various theory of relations such as \"satkaryavada\", \"asatkaryavada\", \"avirodhavada\" and others. The \"anekantavada\" overlaps with two major theories found in Hindu and Buddhist thought, according to James Lochtefeld. The \"Anekantavada\" doctrine is \"satkaryavada\" in explaining causes, and the \"asatkaryavada\" in explaining qualities or attributes in the effects. The different schools of Hindu philosophy further elaborated and refined the theory of \"pramanas\" and the theory of relations to establish correct means to structure propositions in their view.\n\nIndologists such as professor John E. Cort state that \"anekāntavāda\" is a doctrine that was historical used by Jain scholars not to accept other viewpoints, but to insist on the Jain viewpoint. Jain monks used \"anekāntavāda\" and \"syādvāda\" as debating weapons to silence their critics and defend the Jain doctrine. According to Paul Dundas, in Jain hands, this method of analysis became \"a fearsome weapon of philosophical polemic with which the doctrines of Hinduism and Buddhism could be pared down to their ideological bases of simple permanence and impermanence, respectively, and thus could be shown to be one-pointed and inadequate as the overall interpretations of reality they purported to be\". The Jain scholars, however, considered their own theory of \"Anekantavada\" self-evident, immune from criticism, needing neither limitations nor conditions.\n\nThe doctrines of \"anekāntavāda\" and \"syādavāda\" are often criticised to denying any certainty, or accepting incoherent contradictory doctrines. Another argument against it, posited by medieval era Buddhists and Hindus applied the principle on itself, that is if nothing is definitely true or false, is \"anekāntavāda\" true or false?\n\nAccording to Karl Potter, the \"Anekantavada\" doctrine accepts the norm in Indian philosophies that all knowledge is contextual, that object and subject are interdependent. However, as a theory of relations, it does not solve the deficiencies in other progress philosophies, just \"compounds the felony by merely duplicating the already troublesome notion of a dependence relation\".\n\nThe Nyaya school criticized the Jain doctrine of \"anekantavada\", states Karl Potter, as \"wanting to say one thing at one time, the other at another\", thereby ignoring the principle of non-contradiction. The Naiyayikas states that it makes no sense to simultaneously say, \"jiva and ajiva are not related\" and \"jiva and ajiva are related\". Jains state that \"jiva\" attaches itself to karmic particles (ajiva) which means there is a relation between ajiva and jiva. The Jain theory of ascetic salvation teaches cleansing of karmic particles and destroying the bound ajiva to the jiva, yet, Jain scholars also deny that ajiva and jiva are related or at least interdependent, according to the Nyaya scholars. The Jain theory of \"anekantavada\" makes its theory of karma, asceticism and salvation incoherent, according to Nyaya texts.\n\nThe Vaisheshika and Shaivism school scholar Vyomashiva criticized the \"Anekantavada\" doctrine because, according to him, it makes all moral life and spiritual pursuits for moksha meaningless. Any spiritually liberated person must be considered under \"Anekantavada\" doctrine to be [a] both liberated and not liberated from one point of view, and [b] simply not liberated from another point of view, since all assertions are to be qualified and conditional under it. In other words, states Vyomashiva, this doctrine leads to a paradox and circularity.\n\n\"Anekāntavāda\" was analyzed and critiqued by Adi Śankarācārya (~800 CE) in his \"bhasya\" on \"Brahmasutra\" (2:2:33–36): He stated that \"anekantavada\" doctrine when applied to philosophy suffers from two problems: \"virodha\" (contradictions) and \"samsaya\" (dubiety), neither of which it is able to reconcile with objectivity.\n\nShankara's criticism of \"anekantavada\" extended beyond the arguments of it being incoherent epistemology in ontological matters. According to Shankara, the goal of philosophy is to identify one's doubts and remove them through reason and understanding, not get more confused. The problem with \"anekantavada\" doctrine is that it compounds and glorifies confusion. Further, states Shankara, Jains use this doctrine to be \"certain that everything is uncertain\". According to Karl Potter, Shankara does not take Jains seriously and admits that he doesn't understand Jainism's theory of relations.\n\nContemporary scholars, states Piotr Balcerowicz, concur that the Jain doctrine of \"Anekantavada\" does reject some versions of the \"law of non-contradiction\", but it is incorrect to state that it rejects this law in all instances.\n\nThe Buddhist scholar Śāntarakṣita, and his student Kamalasila, criticized \"anekantavada\" by presenting his arguments that it leads to the Buddhist premise \"jivas (souls) do not exist\". That is, the two of the most important doctrines of Jainism are mutually contradictory premises. According to Santaraksita, Jains state that \"jiva is one considered collectively, and many considered distributively\", but if so debates Santaraksita, \"jiva cannot change\". He then proceeds to show that changing jiva necessarily means jiva appear and disappear every moment, which is equivalent to \"jiva don't exist\". According to Karl Potter, the argument posited by Śāntarakṣita is flawed, because it commits what is called in the Western logic as the \"fallacy of division\".\n\nThe Buddhist logician Dharmakirti critiqued \"anekāntavāda\" as follows:\nThe medieval era Jain logicians Akalanka and Vidyananda, who were likely contemporaries of Adi Shankara, acknowledged many issues with anekantavada in their texts. For example, Akalanka in his \"Pramanasamgraha\" acknowledges seven problems when \"anekantavada\" is applied to develop a comprehensive and consistent philosophy: dubiety, contradiction, lack of conformity of bases (\"vaiyadhi karanya\"), joint fault, infinite regress, intermixture and absence. Vidyananda acknowledged six of those in the Akalanka list, adding the problem of \"vyatikara\" (cross breeding in ideas) and \"apratipatti\" (incomprehensibility). Prabhācandra, who probably lived in the 11th-century, and several other later Jain scholars accepted many of these identified issues in \"anekantavada\" application.\n\n"}

Before that time, Kazakhstan, as part of the Russian Empire, had indirect contact with the Bahá'í Faith as far back as 1847. Following the arrival of pioneers the community grew to be the largest religious community after Islam and Christianity, although only a minor percent of the national whole. By 1994 the National Spiritual Assembly of Kazakhstan was elected and the community had begun to multiply its efforts across various interests. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 6,400 Bahá'ís in 2005.\n\nThe earliest relationship between the Bahá'í Faith and Kazakhstan came under the sphere of the country's history with Russia. In 1847 the Russian ambassador to Tehran, Prince Dimitri Ivanovich Dolgorukov, requested that the Báb, the herald to the Bahá'í Faith who was imprisoned at Maku, be moved elsewhere. He also condemned the massacres of Iranian religionists and asked for the release of Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith. By the 1880s an organized community of Bahá'ís was established in Ashgabat and later built the first Bahá'í House of Worship in 1913-1918.\n\nBy the time of the October Revolution Bahá'ís had spread through Central Asia and Caucasus with the community in Ashgabat numbering about two thousand people. The community of Ashgabat had developed a library, hospital, hotel and Bahá'í schools — including a school for girls — all open to all people regardless of religion. After the October Revolution and the ban on religion, the Bahá'ís (strictly adhering to their principle of obedience to legal government) abandoned their administration and allowed their properties to be nationalized. By 1938, after numerous arrests and a policy of oppression of religion, most Bahá'ís were sent to prisons and camps or sent abroad. There were at this time some 1,400 families of Bahá'ís resident in Ashgabat. The authorities arrested every adult male Bahá'í. The women and children were deported to Iran, while the men were either deported or sentenced to long terms of imprisonment or exile. Many were sent to Pavlodar in northern Kazakhstan. Bahá'í communities in 38 cities ceased to exist.\n\nBahá'ís had managed to re-enter various countries of the Eastern Bloc throughout the 1950s, following a plan of the head of the religion at the time, Shoghi Effendi. By 1953 the first pioneers arrived in Kazakhstan. A pair of small communities are listed in 1963.\n\nThere is evidence that the Bahá'í Faith started to grow across the Soviet Union in the 1980s. In 1991 a Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly of the Soviet Union was elected but was quickly split among its former members. In 1992, a regional National Spiritual Assembly for the whole of Central Asia (Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Kirgizia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) was formed with its seat in Ashkhabad. In 1994 the National Spiritual Assembly of Kazakhstan was elected.\n\nAs of 2001, 25 Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assemblies or smaller groups had registered with the government - and these communities totaled 25 of 55 of the organized communities of \"nontraditional\" religions (\"traditional\" being defined by the Kazakh government as Islam, Christianity, Judaism and Buddhism.) Local Spiritual Assemblies had been registered in many Kazakh cities.} There were more registered communities of Bahá'ís than Jews and Buddhists and the rest of the non-Moslem, non-Christian religious communities. In 1999 - the closest national census - 7% of the religious national population of 14,896,000 (or just over 1 million) were not Muslim or Christian.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2002 Bahá'í Conference on Social and Economic Development for the Americas, held in Orlando, Florida had an attendee from Kazakhstan.\n\nA Kazakhstan citizen worked at the Bahá'í World Centre in Haifa and volunteered participation with the Inspirit troupe which toured Vilnius in 2004.\n\nA \"Conference on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace,\" which was held on 22 June 2005 had Bahá'í speakers rising in support of the advancement of women and the conference was co-sponsored by several governments including Kazakhstan's, and at which the Kazakh Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs also spoke.\n\nIn 2005 Kazakhstan government statistics reported to the United States indicated 44 registered \"nontraditional\" religious groups during the reporting period, (recall from above that 25 had been Bahá'í as late as 2001). The U.S. State Department says: Kazakh laws were amended in 2005 to reinforce registration requirements and clarify that religious groups must register with both the central government and the local governments of individual regions (oblasts) in which they have congregations. Prior to these amendments, the government required religious organizations to register only if they wished to be accorded legal status in order to buy or rent property, hire employees, or engage in other legal transactions. Although the amended national religion laws explicitly require religious organizations to register with the government, it continues to provide that all persons are free to practice their religion \"alone or together with others.\" To register, a religious organization must have at least ten members and submit an application to the Ministry of Justice. A regional conference in 2008 on the progress of the religion in Almaty in southeastern Kazakhstan gathered about 650 people from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Western Siberia.\n\nThe Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 6,400 Bahá'ís in 2005.\n\n\n\n"}

The community includes around 400 people, with a centre in Beit Mery, just outside the capital Beirut, and cemeteries in Machgara and Khaldeh. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 3,900 Bahá'ís in 2005.\n\nThe first Bahá'ís who came to present day Lebanon were Iranians who came in the 1870s. The founder of the Bahá'í Faith, Bahá'u'lláh, was exiled to Acre, which was at the time was part of the same Ottoman province, or vilayet, of Beirut.\n\nIn 1880, Bahá'u'lláh's son `Abdu'l-Bahá, visited Beirut at the invitation of Midhat Pasha, the Ottoman governor of the Syria Vilayet. A Beirut newspaper described his visit by saying \"His Excellency, the learned, erudite, intelligent and illustrious ‘Abbas Effendi, resident of the city of ‘Akka, has arrived in our city\". Following the visit Baha'u'llah wrote the \"Tablet of the Land of Ba (Beirut)\", later described as a \"glowing tribute\" to `Abdu'l-Bahá.\n\nDuring his visits to Beirut, `Abdu'l-Bahá also met Muhammad Abduh, one of the key figures of Islamic Modernism and the Salafi movement, at a time when the two men were both opposed to the Ottoman \"ulama\" and shared similar goals of religious reform. Rashid Rida asserts that during his visits to Beirut, `Abdu'l-Bahá would attend Abduh's study sessions. Regarding the meetings of `Abdu'l-Bahá and Muhammad 'Abduh, Shoghi Effendi asserts that \"His several interviews with the well-known Shaykh Muhammad ‘Abdu served to enhance immensely the growing prestige of the community and spread abroad the fame of its most distinguished member.\" \n\nIn 1894 a Lebanese Christian, Ibrahim George Kheiralla, converted to the Bahá'í Faith whilst traveling in Cairo. After Bahá'u'llúh wrote a specific tablet to him, he moved to Chicago in the United States and was instrumental in converted many of the early Bahá'í followers there.\n\nTwo Beirut universities - the American University of Beirut and the Saint Joseph University - had significant Baha'i student populations in the early twentieth century. The first Baha'i student was recorded in the 1890s, the “Society of the Bahá’í Students of Beirut\" was formed in 1906 and by 1929 there were over 60 Baha'i students from Iran, Iraq, Egypt and Palestine. The university promoted \"internationalism\" as a core value and acknowledged the Baha'i students as a significant contribution to this vision. The Baha'i leader, Shoghi Effendi, studied at the AUB, graduating in 1917.\n\nA Shi'ite Imam in the southern village of Machgara, Sheikh Ja’afar Al-Tahhan, converted to the Bahá'í Faith in 1923, and that village is now the centre of the community, with the only Lebanese local Spiritual Assembly.\n\nThe \"Encyclopedia of the Orient\" reported that there were 4,000 Bahá'ís living in Lebanon, or around 0.13% of the population.\n\nIn 1968, a prominent Bahá'í academic, Suheil Bushrui became a visiting professor at the American University of Beirut. In the 1980s he was appointed an advisor by President Amine Gemayel, indicating how Bahá'ís are accepted. Bushrui is noted scholar on Khalil Gibran, having published more than one volume about him and serves as the Kahlil Gibran Chair for Values and Peace at the University of Maryland.\n\nThe Baha'i Faith is not one of the 18 recognised sects in Lebanon, so many Bahá'ís are officially listed according to the religion of their ancestors, mostly Shiite. Bahá'í marriages are therefore not recognised, so Bahá'ís tend to travel to Cyprus to have a civil wedding, which is recognised when they return. Other than that, Bahá'ís are allowed to practice their religion in public without any problems.\n\n"}
{"id": "17806024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17806024", "title": "Bahá'í Faith in the Philippines", "text": "Bahá'í Faith in the Philippines\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith in the Philippines is a community of Filipinos, who like their fellow Bahá'ís living in other parts of the world, view the world's major religions as a part of a single, progressive process through which God reveals His will to humanity. They recognize Baha'u'llah, the founder of the Baha'i Faith, as the most recent in a line of Divine Messengers that includes Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Zoroaster, Christ and Muhammad. It is composed of Filipinos from various ethnic and religious background. The religion first reached the country in 1921 with a Bahá'í first visiting the Philippines that year. By 1944 the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly in the country was established in Solano, Nueva Vizcaya. In the early 1960s, during a period of accelerated growth, the community grew from 200 in 1960 to 1000 by 1962 and 2000 by 1963. In 1964 the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the Philippines was elected and by 1980 there were 64000 Bahá'ís and 45 local assemblies. The Bahá'ís have been active in multi/inter-faith developments. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimates the Bahá'í population of the Philippines at about 272600.\n\nThe first mention of the Philippines in Bahá'í literature, is in a letter from 1911 by `Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion. Later he wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916-1917 asking the followers of the religion to travel to other countries; these letters were compiled together in the book titled Tablets of the Divine Plan. The seventh of the tablets was the first to mention several island nations in the Pacific Ocean. Written on April 11, 1916, it was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 — after the end of World War I and the Spanish flu. The seventh tablet was translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on April 4, 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on December 12, 1919.\n\n\"A party speaking their languages, severed, holy, sanctified and filled with the love of God, must turn their faces to and travel through the three great island groups of the Pacific Ocean—Polynesia, Micronesia and Melanesia, and the islands attached to these groups, such as New Guinea, Borneo, Java, Sumatra, Philippine Islands, Solomon Islands, Fiji Islands, New Hebrides, Loyalty Islands, New Caledonia, Bismarck Archipelago, Ceram, Celebes, Friendly Islands, Samoa Islands, Society Islands, Caroline Islands, Low Archipelago, Marquesas, Hawaiian Islands, Gilbert Islands, Moluccas, Marshall Islands, Timor and the other islands. With hearts overflowing with the love of God, with tongues commemorating the mention of God, with eyes turned to the Kingdom of God, they must deliver the glad tidings of the manifestation of the Lord of Hosts to all the people.\"\n\nMirza Hossein R. Touty (perhaps a transliteration of \"Tiati\"), a Persian Bahá'í and subscriber to \"Star of the West\", travelled to the Philippine Islands in 1921 before the death of `Abdu'l-Bahá, during American territorial period. Touty arrived via Shanghai, then Vladivostok and came to Mindanao in the Philippines, ending up in Surigao, in January 1921 for a time. In 1926 both Siegfried Schopflocher and Martha Root, both later entitled as Hands of the Cause, were able to give talks in Manila. Touty left the Philippines in 1926.\n\nIn 1938 Felix Maddela became the first Filipino Bahá'í. His first encounter with the Bahá'í Faith was in 1924 when a purchase he made was wrapped in a piece of old newspaper which contained an article by Martha Root about the religion. As the author's address did not appear in the article, it was another 14 years before he encountered more about the religion. In the early spring of 1937, Loulie Albee Mathews arrived in Manila on board the \"Franconia.\" As the boat was to dock for only a few hours, she managed to place in a college library a few pamphlets for the shelf of comparative religions. A few months later, on a visit to Manila from Solano, Nueva Vizcaya, Mr. Maddela came across the literature. This started a series of correspondence with the Bahá'í Publishing Committee of the United States. With Madella so fired up, he immediately taught his family and friends. Shortly before World War II, the Bahá'í's of Solano numbered around fifty. When war broke out all communications ceased. Immediately after the war, contact was re-established through Alvin Blum, who was attached to the medical unit of the United States Army. Hitch-hiking to Solano, which was in ruins, he located the Maddelas living in impoverished conditions. Of the fifty enrolled Bahá'í's, twenty-five had been killed or missing. The others had survived by hiding in rice fields for three years.\n\nOn December 2, 1946, the Local Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'í's of Solano was incorporated. The members and incorporators were Felix Maddela, Angustia Maddela, Zacarias Tottoc, Mariano Tagubat, Nicanora Lorenzo, Dionisia Vadel, Maurelio Bueza, Jacinta Piggangay and Azucena Cruz. In 1947, Mr. Dominador Anunsacion and his brother Angelo traveled to Solano, heard and accepted the Faith. Upon their return to Santiago,Isabela another community was established.\n\nHazel Mori, an American, became a Bahá'í in the USA in 1941, and later moved to the Philippines as a Baha'i pioneer. For more than ten years she served as treasurer of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the Philippines when it was formed later. Others, heeding the call of Shoghi Effendi, then head of the Bahá'í Faith, also visited Philippines. These were Nina Nadler, William Allison, Miss Virginia Breaks, and Michael Jamir. Hand of the Cause Agnes Baldwin Alexander also visited the Philippines six or seven times from 1958 to 1964. In 1956, the Local Spiritual Assemblies of Rosario and Diffun were established. The first Bahá'í Summer School was held in Solano in 1958. The Local Spiritual Assembly of Manila was also established in 1959.\n\nLuisa Mapa Gomez was the first Bahá'í of Manila. Born in Talisay, Negros Occidental, she was the daughter of a prominent doctor, and graduated from the University of the Philippines College of Education. She sponsored countless students to attend elementary, high schools and colleges. After the visit of Mrs. Mori to the Philippines in 1953, and after attending firesides in the home of Mrs. Nina Adler, who was then working in the American Embassy, \"Momsu\", as she was fondly called, accepted the Faith.\n\nIn 1960 the Bahá'í community of the Philippines consisted of four local spiritual assemblies and a population of about 200. In 1961, Hand of the Cause, Dr. Rahmatu'lláh Muhájir arrived in Manila for the first of his numerous visits. The handful of believers in Solano, Santiago and Manila were empowered to overcome natural shyness and to reach out to masses in these provinces. Bill Allison, Jack Davis, Vivian Bayona, Grace Maddela, Philip Flores, Baltazar Mariano, Len Scott, Vic Samaniego and Freddie Santiago were among those who assisted others in the process of entry to the Faith. Gradually, Dr. Muhajir encouraged everyone to expand beyond Isabela and Nueva Vizcaya into other provinces. By 1962 there were reports of mass conversions with 24 Local Spiritual Assemblies and 1000 converts. By 1963 there were 2000 Bahá'ís and there were several specific tribes known to have converts - Ifugao, Igorot, Ilocano, Ilongot, Kalinga, Negritoes, Pangasinan, and Tagalog. There were villages where the inhabitants were all Bahá'ís. Dr. Muhájir, accompanied by Ms. Vivian Bayona, introduced the religion to the Bilaan tribe in Mindanao. Datu Eloy Epa, the tribal chief, accepted the Faith. In 1964, National Spiritual Assembly was elected for the first time. The members were Vicente Samaniego, Pablo Mercado, Jack Davis, Neva Dulay, Luisa Mapa Gomez, Dominador Anunsacion, Ruth Walbridge, Theo Boehnert and Orpha Daugherty. That year, Dr. Muhájir visited the island of Mindoro and walked for eight hours across mountainous terrain to reach the Mangyan tribes. The religion was received with immediate acceptance. One new declarant, Rogelio Onella, began using a room in his house to teach literacy classes to fellow tribesmen. This small class developed further into the 'Rogelio Onella Memorial School' and served as nucleus of four tutorial schools among the tribes. By 1980 there were 45 Local Spiritual Assemblies and 64,000 adherents. During this period the only Hand of the Cause to visit the interior of the country was Rahmatu'lláh Muhájir though Agnes Baldwin Alexander and Collis Featherstone also visited the country. This large scale growth was generally true across Southeast Asia in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIn late July 1972 three Iranian Bahá'í students of Mindanao State University were murdered: Parvíz Sadeghi, Farámarz Vujdání and Parvíz Furúghí were killed while traveling in rural Muslim areas of Mindanao. After recovering their mutilated bodies from a shallow grave a convocation was held and funeral procession attended by thousands of people including fellow students, faculty members and university officials.\n\nSince its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. The Bahá'í community in the Philippines has been active in the country on several different areas. A curriculum on Values education for public secondary schools in the Philippines was initially developed by a team of Bahá'í educators and was then completed as a doctoral dissertation. The curriculum was to be offered to the Department of Education, Culture and Sports of the Philippine government to be used for \"Values Education\", a subject taught in Philippine public secondary schools. A Bahá'í AM radio station was also officially launched in the Philippines on 29 November 2002 in Nueva Ecija province registered as station DZDF. A Bahá'í National Arts Festival was held between 26 and 29 December 2004 in Baguio City with Bahá'ís from 20 localities. Internationally, the National Spiritual Assembly of Bahá'ís of the Philippines participated in the Conference on Interfaith Cooperation for Peace hosted by the Filipino Department of Foreign Affairs held in 2005 in New York which was attended by the President of the Committee of Religious NGOs in the UN. The Philippines community hosted a regional conference of Bahá'ís totaling over 1,000 - nearly 700 people from the Philippines itself were joined by Bahá'ís from Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, Caroline Islands, Mariana Islands, and the Marshall Islands.\n\nThe 2000 census stated that about 2%, or about 1.53 million people, were classified as \"Other\" in the religious field (non-Christian, non-Muslim, and negligible Buddhist religious communities). The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimates the Bahá'í population of the Philippines at about 272600.\n\n\n"}

The feminine form is \"Belit\" 'Lady, Mistress'. \"Bel\" is represented in Greek as Belos and in Latin as Belus. Linguistically \"Bel\" is an East Semitic form cognate with Northwest Semitic Baal with the same meaning.\n\nEarly translators of Akkadian believed that the ideogram for the god called in Sumerian \"Enlil\" was to be read as \"Bel\" in Akkadian. Current scholarship holds this as incorrect, but one finds \"Bel\" used in referring to Enlil in older translations and discussions.\n\n\"Bel\" became especially used for the Babylonian god Marduk and when found in Assyrian and neo-Babylonian personal names or mentioned in inscriptions in a Mesopotamian context it can usually be taken as referring to Marduk and no other god. Similarly \"Belit\" without some disambiguation mostly refers to Bel Marduk's spouse Sarpanit. However, Marduk's mother, the Sumerian goddess called Ninhursag, Damkina, Ninmah and other names in Sumerian, was often known as \"Belit-ili\" 'Lady of the Gods' in Akkadian.\n\nOther gods called \"Lord\" could be and sometimes were identified totally or in part with Bel Marduk. The god Malak-bel of Palmyra is an example, though in the later period from which most of our information comes he seems to have become very much a sun god.\n\nSimilarly, Zeus Belus mentioned by Sanchuniathon as born to Cronus/El in Peraea is certainly most unlikely to be Marduk.\n\nA god named Bel was the chief-god of Palmyra in pre-Hellenistic times, being worshipped alongside the gods Aglibol and Yarhibol. Originally, he was known as Bol, after the Northwestern Semitic word Ba'al (usually used to refer to the god Hadad), until the cult of Bel-Marduk spread to Palmyra and by 213 BC, Bol was renamed to Bel. The temple of Bel was dedicated to this god.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20323463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20323463", "title": "Bengali Hindu wedding", "text": "Bengali Hindu wedding\n\nBengali Hindu wedding refers to Bengali wedding with Hindu rites and rituals native to the Indian subcontinent.\n\nA traditional wedding is arranged by Ghotoks (matchmakers), who are generally friends or relatives of the couple. The matchmakers facilitate the introduction among the family and the prospective bride and groom.\n\nBengali weddings are traditionally in four parts: the bride's \"Gaye Holud\", the groom's \"Gaye Holud\", the \"Beeye\" and the \"Bou Bhaat\". These often take place on separate days. The first event in a wedding is an informal one: the groom presents the bride with a ring marking the \"engagement\", a system which is gaining popularity. This can sometimes be considered as Ashirwaad.\n\nThere can be subtle differences in Bengali Hindu marriages in West Bengal and Bangladesh. The rituals sometimes differ. In Paaka Katha (final talk), the parents of the bride/groom, along with one or two very close relatives/friends go to the other party's house to formally settle the marriage. It may be followed by a lunch / dinner.\n\nA Bengali Hindu Marriage can be divided into the following parts:\n\n\nAshirbaad – On an auspicious day the elders of the groom's side go to bless the bride and vice versa, by sprinkling husked rice and trefoil on their heads and giving them gold ornaments. It is a kind of acceptance of the boy and the girl on both sides.\n\nGaye Holud – A ceremony in which five or seven married women of the household grind turmeric with mortar and pestle and anoint the bride with turmeric paste, first it is been applied on groom then the same paste will sent to bride's home for applying it on her along with a new Saree and gamchha (bengalee cotton towel) and other treassaud set from the boy's party. This brightens up the bride's complexion and makes her skin glow.\n\nDodhi Mongol – At dawn on the day of marriage seven married ladies adorn the bride's hands with the traditional bangles Shakha and Paula – one pair of red and one pair of white Conch-shell bangles, and feed her a meal of curd and rice, nowadays other dishes as well, the only meal after which the bride and her parents fast the whole day. This ritual is celebrated on groom's side also.\n\nBor Jatri – The members of the groom's house as well as his friends dress in their best attire and journey to the bride's house where the wedding takes place.\n\nBor Boron – When the bor jatri reaches the bride's place, usually the mother of the bride along with other members come out to welcome the groom and his family by showing the holy earthen lamp, sprinkling trefoil, and husked rice placed on a bamboo winnow (kula). Then they are served sweets and drinks.\n\nPotto Bastra – After the groom is seated at the chadnatolla (wedding altar and canopy) – the sanctum sanctorum where only the groom, bride and the priest takes their place, the groom is offered new clothes by the person who is to do the sampradaan – the elderly male member of the family who does sampradan offers the responsibility of the bride to the groom.\n\nSaat Paak – The bride, usually seated on a low wooden stool called pidi is lifted by her brothers and is taken round the groom in seven complete circles. The significance is they are winded up securely to each other.\n\nSubho Dristi – After saat paak the bride and the groom are made to look at each other in front of all the assembled invitees. The bride is told to remove the paan leaves. This exchange of loving glance is to initiate them to be together officially by the society.\n\nMala Badal – After the circles are completed, still sitting high on the piri, the bride and the groom exchange garlands of fragrant flowers thrice. This is the first step in which they accept each other.\n\nSampradan – The bride then takes her place at the chadnatolla where an elderly male member of the bride's family hands her over to the groom and the couple's hands are bound by the sacred thread amidst recital of Vedic chants and are placed on the mangal ghot – a brass pitcher filled with water that is covered with mango leaves attached to one twig and a green coconut placed on it.\n\nYagna – The bride and groom sit in front of the sacred fire and chant mantras after the priest. Agni, the fire god is made the divine witness to the marriage. See Vedic marriage.\n\nSaptapadi – Seven circular rounds are taken by the couple around the fire thereby solemnising the occasion.\n\nAnjali – An offering to the fire is made. The bride's brother puts puffed rice (khoi) in the hands of the bride, and the groom standing close to her holds her hands from the back and extends their arms forward. They then pour the offering into the fire together.\n\nSindoor Daan and Ghomta – Once again seated at their respective places in chadnatolla the groom applies sindoor or vermilion (a symbol of marriage worn by Hindu women thereafter) on the bride's hair-parting. The bride then covers her head with a new sari offered by the groom as ghomta or veil.\n\nBidaay – This is a farewell – mixed moment of joy and sorrow as the bride is bid adieu with blessings of her parents and relatives to start a new life with her beau. The bride has to throw rice in the sari of her mother to fill the responsibility of her mother to her (as it is considered that the bride is the Groom's responsibility).\n\nBodhu Boron - This is done when the bride reaches the groom's house. One dish is made full with alta and milk. The bride stands on it, then enters the room with groom after being welcomed by the mother-in-law.\n\nKaal Ratri – After the couple reaches the groom's house and the initial welcome ceremony is over they are separated for the night, probably to get a refreshing sleep and prepare for the next day's final wedding ceremony.\n\nBou Bhaat – The bride cooks and serves all the members of her husband's family.

{"id": "26267761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26267761", "title": "Cumaean Sibyl", "text": "Cumaean Sibyl\n\nThe Cumaean Sibyl was the priestess presiding over the Apollonian oracle at Cumae, a Greek colony located near Naples, Italy. The word \"sibyl\" comes (via Latin) from the ancient Greek word \"sibylla\", meaning prophetess. There were many sibyls in different locations throughout the ancient world. Because of the importance of the Cumaean Sibyl in the legends of early Rome as codified in Virgil's \"Aeneid\" VI, and because of her proximity to Rome, the Cumaean Sibyl became the most famous among the Romans. The Erythraean Sibyl from modern-day Turkey was famed among Greeks, as was the oldest Hellenic oracle, the Sibyl of Dodona, possibly dating to the second millennium BC according to Herodotus, favored in the east.\n\nThe Cumaean Sibyl is one of the four sibyls painted by Raphael at Santa Maria della Pace (see gallery below.) She was also painted by Andrea del Castagno (\"Uffizi Gallery, illustration right\"), and in the Sistine Ceiling of Michelangelo her powerful presence overshadows every other sibyl, even her younger and more beautiful sisters, such as the Delphic Sibyl.\n\nThere are various names for the Cumaean Sibyl besides the \"Herophile\" of Pausanias and Lactantius or the \"Aeneid\"'s \"Deiphobe, daughter of Glaucus\": \"Amaltheia\", \"Demophile\" or \"Taraxandra\" are all offered in various references.\n\nThe story of the acquisition of the Sibylline Books by Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the semi-legendary last king of the Roman Kingdom, or Tarquinius Priscus, is one of the famous mythic elements of Roman history.\n\nCenturies ago, concurrent with the 50th Olympiad, not long before the expulsion of Rome's kings, an old woman \"who was not a native of the country\" (Dionysius) arrived incognita in Rome. She offered nine books of prophecies to King Tarquin; and as the king declined to purchase them, owing to the exorbitant price she demanded, she burned three and offered the remaining six to Tarquin at the same stiff price, which he again refused, whereupon she burned three more and repeated her offer. Tarquin then relented and purchased the last three at the full original price, whereupon she \"disappeared from among men\" (Dionysius). \n\nThe books were thereafter kept in the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill, Rome, to be consulted only in emergencies. The temple burned down in the 80s BC, and the books with it, necessitating a re-collection of Sibylline prophecies from all parts of the empire (Tacitus 6.12). These were carefully sorted and those determined to be legitimate were saved in the rebuilt temple. The Emperor Augustus had them moved to the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine Hill, where they remained for most of the remaining Imperial Period.\n\nThe Cumaean Sibyl is featured in the works of various Roman authors, including Virgil (\"The Eclogues\", \"The Æneid\"), Ovid (\"The Metamorphoses\") and Petronius (\"The Satyricon\").\n\nThe Cumaean Sibyl prophesied by “singing the fates” and writing on oak leaves. These would be arranged inside the entrance of her cave, but if the wind blew and scattered them, she would not help to reassemble the leaves and recreate the original prophecy.\n\nThe Sibyl was a guide to the underworld (Hades), whose entrance lay at the nearby crater of Avernus. Aeneas employed her services before his descent to the lower world to visit his dead father Anchises, but she warned him that it was no light undertaking:\n\nThe Sibyl acts as a bridge between the worlds of the living and the dead (cf. concept of liminality). She shows Aeneas the way to Avernus and teaches him what he needs to know about the dangers of their journey.\n\nAlthough she was a mortal, the Sibyl lived about a thousand years. She attained this longevity when Apollo offered to grant her a wish in exchange for her virginity; she took a handful of sand and asked to live for as many years as the grains of sand she held. Later, after she refused the god's love, he allowed her body to wither away because she failed to ask for eternal youth. Her body grew smaller with age and eventually was kept in a jar (\"ampulla\"). Eventually only her voice was left (\"Metamorphoses\" 14; compare the myth of Tithonus).\n\nVirgil may have been influenced by Hebrew texts, according to Tacitus, amongst others. Constantine, the Christian emperor, in his first address to the assembly, interpreted the whole of \"The Eclogues\" as a reference to the coming of Christ, and quoted a long passage of the Sibylline Oracles (\"Book 8\") containing an acrostic in which the initials from a series of verses read: Jesus Christ Son of God Saviour Cross.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, both the Cumaean Sibyl and Virgil were considered prophets of the birth of Christ, because the fourth of Virgil's \"Eclogues\" appears to contain a Messianic prophecy by the Sibyl. In it, she foretells the coming of a saviour, whom Christians identified as Jesus. This was identified by early Christians as such—one reason why Dante Alighieri later chose Virgil as his guide through the underworld in \"The Divine Comedy\". Similarly, Michelangelo prominently featured the Cumaean Sibyl in the Sistine Chapel among the Old Testament prophets, as had earlier works such as the Tree of Jesse miniature in the Ingeberg Psalter (c. 1210).\n\n\nThe famous cave known as the \"Antro della Sibilla\" was discovered by Amedeo Maiuri in 1932, the identification of which he based on the description by Virgil in the 6th book of the Aeneid, and also from the description by an anonymous author known as pseudo-Justin. (Virg. Aen. 6. 45–99; Ps-Justin, 37). The cave is a trapezoidal passage over 131 m long, running parallel to the side of the hill and cut out of the volcanic tuff stone and leads to an innermost chamber, where the Sibyl was thought to have prophesied.\n\nA nearby tunnel through the acropolis now known as the \"Crypta Romana\" (part of Agrippa and Octavian's defenses in the war against Sextus Pompey) was previously identified as the Grotto of the Sibyl. The inner chamber was later used as a burial chamber during the 4th or 5th century AD (M. Napoli 1965, 105) by people living at the site.\n\nSome archaeologists have proposed an alternative cave site as the home of the Sibyl. A tunnel complex near Baiae leads to an underground geothermally-heated stream that could be presented to visitors as the river Styx. The layout of the tunnels conforms to the description in the Aeneid of Aeneas' journey to the underworld and back.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30994122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30994122", "title": "Hindu Shahi", "text": "Hindu Shahi\n\nThe Hindu Shahi held sway over the Kabul Valley and Gandhara (modern-day Pakistan and Afghanistan) from as far back as the fourth century CE. During the Early Medieval Indian history (700-1000 CE) there were two dynasties in Kabul Valley and Gandhara: the Kshatriya-Hindu dynasty and the Brahmana-Hindu dynasty which replaced it. Both used the title of \"Shahi\". Details about these rulers have been assembled over a period of time from chronicles, coins and stone inscriptions by researchers as no consolidated account of their history has become available.\n\nEfforts were made, earlier also, to apportion the Kshatriya \"varna\" to Kallar's Brahamana successors on the basis of their name-endings, marriage alliances and even their \"‘terrible valour’\" at the battlefield. All these arguments were deemed untenable. However, in 1973, Yogendra Misra projected the view that according to Rajatarangini Hindu Shahis (meaning here post-Lagaturman kings) were also Kshatriyas.\n\nC. V. Vaidya says that the Hindu Shahis were Brahmanas. He has further highlighted that \"the Mohyals who are a sub-sect of Sarasvata Brahmnas ... claim \"with justice and propriety\" that Jaipal and Anandapal were Mohyal Brahmanas.\" D. B. Pandey has expressed the view that, in the present state of our knowledge, the Hindu Shahis were Brahma-Kshatras, who discarded the priestly profession for martial pursuits.\"\n\nOther Accounts suggest Punjabi Kshatriya origins for the Hindu Shahi dynasty. The Palas are ruling clans originating in Punjab and belonged to either Mohyal Clan or Janjua Rajputs.\n\nAt some stage the Hindu kingdom of Kapisha had split up. Its western part formed a separate state called the kingdom of Zabul. It can be surmised that it was a family division because there were consanguineous and political relationships between the states of Kabul and Zabul.\n\nIn 700-701, Abdur Rehman bin Mohammed bin Ashta was dispatched with forty thousand men and was able to collect considerable booty but failed to have any territorial gains – thus incurring the displeasure of Hajjaj. Exasperated by the threats of super session he determined to carry arms against his master and, in order to strengthen his power, conducted a treaty with the enemies of faith (Rutbil) that the latter would afford him asylum in the event of the failure of his campaign against the caliph. After some initial successes, Abdur Rehman was at the end compelled to seek the protection of his Hindu ally. Sustained political intervention of the Rutbil brought the Islamic expansion to a halt and he had made Sistan an ‘ill-omened frontier’ for the Arabs. In folklore Rutbil became the hero of many Arab stories of holy wars on the frontier of Hind. Gradually, the Arabs - the ruling caliphs - ceased to be a powerful political force and Rutbils ruled in comparative peace for another one hundred and fifty years.\n\nIn theory, the caliph as the successor of the Prophet was the fountainhead of all political authority. Kings and all tribal chiefs were subordinate to him and his sanction alone could provide the legal basis for their authority. With the waning of political might of the caliphate, its governors in Khurasan set up their own strong kingdom – the Samanid dynasty (c. 819-1005 CE) – controlling regions west and north of Koh Hindu Kush up to Balkh. Under the loosely centralized feudal government of the Samanids, Transoxiana and Khurasan prospered with a notable expansion of industry and commerce. Samanids were great art patrons and they turned Bukhara and Samarkand into famous cultural centres, rivaling Baghdad.\n\nAccording to \"The Mazare Sharif Inscription of the Time of the Shahi Ruler Veka\", recently discovered from northern Afghanistan and reported by the Taxila Institute of Asian Civilisations, Islamabad, Veka (sic.) conquered northern region of Afghanistan ‘with eightfold forces’ and ruled there. He established a Shiva temple there which was inaugurated by \"Parimaha Maitya\" (the Great Minister). He also issued copper coins of the Elephant and Lion type with the legend Shri Vakkadeva.\n\nNine principal issues of Bull and Horseman silver coins and only one issue of corresponding copper coins of Spalapatideva have become available. As many as five Elephant and Lion type of copper coins of Shri Vakkadeva are available and curiously the copper issues of Vakka are \"contemporaneous\" with the silver issues of Spalapati.\n\nOn his way back from Balkh, Yaqub is stated to have attacked Kabul. \"Whether the word Kabul stands here for the city in particular or Kabul valley in general, is not clearly stated. The sequence of events, however, suggests that latter was probably the case\" (Abdur Rahman). As we know, Shahis had a governor in Northern Afghanistan. Invasion of this province was an attack on (the state of) Kabul and the idols, say from the Shiva temple established by Vakkadeva would verily be ‘idols from Kabul’. There is no indication of a direct battle between Yaqub and the king of Kabul, which event could not go unreported.\n\nIt was some time during this period that the Hindu Shahis shifted their capital from Kabul to Udabhandapura.\n\nReliable evidence has now become available indicating that this oft-quoted narration by ‘Ufi was short of the ‘whole truth’. Kamlu did not stop in his tracks by Fardaghan's ingenious propaganda. \"Tarikh-i-Sistan\" illuminates the history of this period differently. Amr-i-Lais's pre-occupation with affairs in Khurasan and the provocative action of his newly appointed governor of Ghazni, prompted two Indian Kings (Rai of Hindustan), whose names reported in very corrupt form have been restored as \"Ashta\" and \"Tormana\", to take firm retaliatory measures. They combined their forces and launched a united invasion of Ghazni. Fardaghan is said to have opposed the Hindu army. The \"Tarikh\" does not tell us whether the city of Ghazni was actually occupied by the victors at this stage or the name Ghazni stands for the province of Zabulistan, and not the city of Ghazni. The news of this invasion reached Amr when he was in Gurgan on his way to his last encounter with Ismail. In April 900 Amr was decisively defeated and sent as a prisoner to Baghdad where he breathed his last. He must have passed through Gurgan only a couple of months before his defeat. Thus Kamlu's invasion of Zabulistan can safely be placed in the beginning of 900 at the latest.\n\nHaving successfully dealt with the Saffarids, Ashta (the governor of Kabul) appears to have stayed back and maneuvered a ‘palace coup’. He seized the Shahi throne at Udabhandapura, dislodging his brother Kamalavarman but the state of Kashmir intervened. \"Rajatarangini\" records that Prabhakaradeva the \"Koshadhyaksha\" (Superintendent of Treasury) led a victorious expedition against the Shahi power at the town of Udabhandapura and bestowed the kingdom of the rebellious Shahi (\"ajna atikrami Shahi\" – a Shahi violator of order) upon Tormana, Lalliya's son and gave him the new name \"Kamaluka\". This may have happened in 903 during the reign of child king Gopalavarman (r. 902-904) ruling under the guardianship of his mother Sugandha.\n\nKamaluka has been identified as Kamalavarman, son of Lalliya (Samantadeva). He was succeeded by his son, Bhimadeva.\n\nDuring the reign of Kamalavarman, the Saffarid rule weakened precipitately and ultimately Sistan became a part of the Samanid Empire. The disorder generally prevailed and the control of Zabulistan changed hands frequently. Taking advantage of the situation, the Shahis stepped up activities on their western frontier. The result was the emergence of a small Hindu power at Ghazni, supported by the Shahis. \"The authorities either themselves of early date or enshrining early information mention Lawik\" who was a Hindu as the ruler at Ghazni, before this place was taken over by the Turkish slave governor of the Samanids.\n\nBy the middle of the tenth century, Turkish slaves began to acquire power in the Samanid realm, as they were holding principal offices in the court and kingdom. One of these, Alaptagin, a former Hajib or Door Keeper, defeated the superior royal army near Khulm Pass and decided to carve out an independent kingdom for himself. He first took over Bamian ‘the country of the infidel (Hindu) Shir Barak’. He next turned to Ghazni where Lawik, its ruler, submitted after a prolonged siege of four months. Alaptagin thus became the undisputed master of Ghazni but he died soon thereafter and his son Abu Ishaq succeeded him in 963.\n\nSubstitution of Hindu potentates of Bamian and Ghazni by an emerging Turkish power posed a serious threat to the Shahi kingdom which acted with ‘remarkable alacrity’ at this stage. The Lawik was sent back to Ghazni with a huge army which ousted the Turks and sent Abu Ishaq flying to Bukhara. The Shahis had secured their western frontier – for the time being. But the gathering storm had not blown away.\n\nBhimadeva had only one daughter and no son. This daughter was married to Simhraja of the Lohara dynasty.\n\nThe Shahi state had successfully managed to ward off danger from the strong neighbouring kingdom of the Samanids for more than a century. That Muslim kingdom was gradually decaying but its ambitious Turk officers were acquiring power and setting up personal fiefdoms, menacing the Hindu states south of Koh Hindu Kush. Though ruling with grandeur, unmolested by any neighbouring kingdom, Bhimadeva was getting old and must have been weighing his options in the matter of succession, because he did not have a male heir. The Shahi kingdom was strong and prosperous but not easy to govern - and protect. He could not count either on the Lawiks or his granddaughter Didda of Kashmir for this onerous responsibility. He selected the allied kingdom of Punjab for this honour and probably installed a successor in his own life for the succession seems to have been without ‘contest or convulsion’.\n\nWith Jayapala, a new dynasty started ruling over the former Shahi kingdom of south- eastern Afghanistan and the change over was smooth and consensual. On his coronation, Jayapala used the additional name-suffix \"deva\" from his predecessor's dynasty in addition to the \"pala\" name-ending of his own family. (With Kabul lost during the lifetime of Jayapaladeva, his successors – Anandapala, Trilochanapala and Bhimapala - reverted to their own family \"pala\"-ending names.) Jayapala did not issue any coins in his own name. Bull and Horseman coins with the legend Samantadeva, in billon, seem to have been struck during Jayapala's reign. As the successor of Bhima, Jayapala was a Shahi monarch of the state of Kabul, which now included the Punjab. Minhaj-ud-din describes Jayapala as \"the greatest of the Rais of Hindustan.\"\n\nFrom the beginning Jayapala followed an aggressive and pro-active policy towards the Turks. As stated earlier, Abu Ishaq had been evicted from Ghazni and the Lawiks were installed there with Shahi help. In 965, Abu Ishaq regained Ghazni with assistance from the Samanid ruler Abu Mansur and the Lawik fled to ‘Hind’ once again to seek help from the Shahis. Ultimately, Sabuktagin descended the throne of Ghazni in 977. He soon added Bust, Dawar, Qusdar, Tukhristan and Ghur to his dominions. Conflict with ‘Hind’ could not have been postponed for too long.\n\nJayapaladeva attacked the growing power Sabuktagin and was a fierce battle in which Jayapala was defeated. He lost more territory but continued to rule from Waihind and Peshawar.\n\nSabuktagin then became more involved in the affairs of the Samanid state and left the Shahis in peace. He became very powerful in the Samanid Kingdom by virtue of his strong and disciplined army. Sabuktagin died at Balkh in 997 at the age of fifty six. After a struggle for succession with brothers, his son Mahmud ascended the throne of Ghazni in 998. Mahmud first consolidated his position on his western front, even if he had to challenge the authority of his Samani over-lord. Soon he had control over Herat, Balkh, Bust and Khurasan. Recognising his power, the Caliph of Baghdad acknowledged him as a sovereign in his own right and conferred high sounding titles on him. The Ghaznavids had thus acquired a status equal to their former masters – the Samanids. The balance of power had been gradually tilting in favour of Ghazni.\n"}
{"id": "14992612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14992612", "title": "History of Unitarianism", "text": "History of Unitarianism\n\nUnitarianism, as a Christian denominational family of churches, was first defined in Poland-Lithuania and Transylvania in the late 16th century. It was then further developed in England and America until the early 19th century, although theological ancestors are to be found as far back as the early days of Christianity. It matured and reached its classical form in the middle 19th century. Later historical development has been diverse in different countries.\n\nUnitarians trace their history back to the Apostolic Age, i.e. the life of Jesus and the decades immediately after his death, and claim this doctrine was widespread during the pre-Nicene period, that is, before the First Council of Nicaea met in 325. Many believe their Christology (understanding of Jesus Christ) most closely reflects that of the \"original Christians.\" (For a discussion of the New Testament evidence, see Nontrinitarianism.)\n\nWhile it is evident that other Christologies existed in the late 1st and early 2nd centuries, at least some Jewish-Christian congregations tended to hold the view that Jesus was a great man and prophet, even the Son of God, but not God himself. (See Ebionites.)\n\nOne of the earliest controversies over the nature of Christ that involved the propagation of \"unitarian\" ideas broke out at Rome during the episcopate of Victor I (189–199). This was the so-called \"Monarchian controversy\", which originated in a revolt against the influential Logos theology of Justin Martyr and the apologists, who had spoken of Jesus as a second god. Such language was disturbing to some. Justin's language appeared to promote ditheism (two gods). The view, however, was defended by Hippolytus of Rome, for whom it was essential to say that the Father and the Logos are two distinct \"persons\" (\"prosopa\").\n\nSome critics of Justin's theology tried to preserve the unity of God by saying that there is no difference to be discerned between the ‘Son’ and the ‘Father’ (unless ‘Son’ is a name for the physical body or humanity of Christ and ‘Father’ a name for the divine Spirit within). This sort of thinking, known as Modal Monarchianism or Sabellianism, would one day lead to a compromise doctrine that the Father and the Son are consubstantial (of the same being).\n\nOther critics preserved the unity of God by saying that Jesus was a man, but differentiated in being indwelt by the Spirit of God to an absolute and unique degree. They thus denied that Jesus was God or a god. They became known as \"adoptionists\", because they suggested that Jesus was adopted by the Father to be his Son. This view was associated with Theodotus of Byzantium (the Shoemaker) and Artemon.\n\nSo even at this early stage we find evidence of proto-Arianism (Justin's view) and proto-Socinianism (the Adoptionist view), though they were, as yet, not fully formed. Both of these theologies have similarities to latter day Unitarianism.\n\nThe Monarchian controversy came to a head again in the mid-3rd century. In 259 the help of Dionysius of Alexandria, was invoked in a dispute among the churches in Libya between adherents of Justin's Logos-theology and some modalist Monarchians. Dionysius vehemently attacked the modalist standpoint. He affirmed that the Son and the Father were as different as a boat and a boatman and denied that they were \"of one substance\" (\"homoousios\"). The Libyans appealed to Dionysius of Rome, whose rebuke to his Alexandrian namesake stressed the unity of God and condemned \"those who divide the divine monarchy into three separate hypostases and three deities\".\n\nAnother crisis occurred over Paul of Samosata, who became bishop of Antioch in Syria in 260. Paul's doctrine is akin to the primitive Jewish-Christian idea of the person of Christ and to the Christology of Theodotus of Byzantium (adoptionism). To many his doctrine seemed plain heresy, and a council of local bishops was held to consider his case in 268. The bishops found it easier to condemn Paul than to expel him, and he remained in full possession of the church with his enthusiastic supporters. However, the bishops appealed to the Roman emperor, who decided that the legal right to the church building should be assigned \"to those to whom the bishops of Italy and Rome should communicate in writing\". It was the first time that an ecclesiastical dispute had to be settled by the secular power. So Paul was put out of his church.\n\nArius, son of Ammonius, was a popular priest appointed presbyter for the district of Baucalis in Alexandria in 313. His views of the nature of Jesus, although not original, conflicted with the views held by Bishop Alexander of Alexandria. Both Arius and Alexander held that Jesus was the Word (Logos) made perfect Flesh; however, Arius held that the Word was the first Son and Creation of God, who had a beginning of existence, coming after God the Father in time and substance, whereas Alexander held that the Word was co-eternal and consubstantial with God. When disagreement arose between the two men, forces were set in motion that resulted in the formation of the doctrine of the Trinity.\n\nIn the Nicene Creed adopted at the First Council of Nicaea in 325, wherein the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great got involved, the issue was considered settled and the adoption of Alexander's view became the orthodox doctrine and all other views were considered heresy and officially suppressed. During the reign of the emperor Constantius II, however, the anti-Nicene party rose to prominence and exercised considerable control over the church for about a generation. New creeds were drawn up to counter the homoousian doctrine of the Nicene Creed. When Theodosius I took the imperial throne, however, the tables were turned, and at the Council of Constantinople in 381, the position that the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost were all the same being was agreed upon, and the formulation of the doctrine of the Trinity was complete. Theodosius outlawed all Nontrinitarian forms of Christianity.\n\nThe Protestant Reformation of the 16th century saw in many European countries an outbreak, more or less serious, of anti-Trinitarian opinion. Some doubt has been raised about the Reformers' commitment to previous beliefs, including previous Christology: John Henry Newman wrote, \"Luther himself at one time rejected the Apocalypse, called the Epistle of St. James \"straminea\" ['straw'], condemned the word 'Trinity,' fell into a kind of Eutychianism in his view of the Holy Eucharist, and in a particular case sanctioned bigamy. Calvinism, again, in various distinct countries, has become Socinianism, and Calvin himself seems to have denied our Lord's Eternal Sonship and ridiculed the Nicene Creed. \n\"Another evidence, then, of the faithfulness of an ultimate development is its \"definite anticipation\" at an early period in the history of the idea to which it belongs.\"\n\nSuppressed as a rule in individual cases, this type of doctrine ultimately became the badge of separate religious communities, in Poland, Hungary and, at a much later date, in England. By contrast, Sabellianism (also known as modalism, modalistic monarchianism, or modal monarchism) is the nontrinitarian belief that the Heavenly Father, Resurrected Son and Holy Spirit are different modes or aspects of one God, as perceived by the believer, rather than three distinct persons in God Himself.\n\nAlong with the fundamental doctrine, certain characteristics have always marked those who profess unitarianism: a large degree of tolerance, a historical study of scripture, a minimizing of essentials, and a repugnance to formulated creed.\n\nMartin Cellarius (1499–1564), a friend of Luther, and Hans Denck (1500–1527) usually are considered the first literary pioneers of the movement; the anti-Trinitarian position of Ludwig Haetzer did not become public until after his execution (1529) for Anabaptism. Luther himself was opposed to the Unitarian movement, and viewed the founder of Islam, Muhammad, as an adherent to the teachings of Arius.\n\nMichael Servetus (1511?–1553) stimulated thought in this direction and heavily influenced other reformers both by his writings and by his death at the stake. In 1531 he had published his theological treatise \"De Trinitatis Erroribus\" (On the Errors About the Trinity), in which he rejected the Nicene dogma of the Trinity and proposed that the Son was the union of the divine Logos with the man Jesus, miraculously born from the Virgin Mary through the intervention of God's spirit. This was generally interpreted as a denial of the Trinitarian dogma (actually Servetus had described the Trinity as a \"three-headed Cerberus\" and \"three ghosts\" which only led believers to confusion and error). Servetus expanded his ideas on the nature of God and Christ 20 years later in his major work, \"Christianismi Restitutio\" (The Restoration of Christianity), which caused his burning at the stake in Calvin's Geneva (and also in effigy by the Catholic Inquisition in France) in 1553 . Nowadays most Unitarians see Servetus as their pioneer and first martyr, and his thought was a remarkable influence in the beginnings of Polish and Transylvanian Anti-trinitarian churches, even though his Arian views on Jesus Christ (e.g. retaining belief in the pre-existence of Christ) were different from those of the Polish Socinians (rejecting belief in Jesus' pre-existence), and again from the generation of Thomas Belsham (rejecting also the virgin birth), and very different from what the Unitarian Church generally believes today.\n\nThe Anabaptist Council of Venice 1550, marks the start of a formal but underground antitrinitarian movement in Italy, led by men such as Matteo Gribaldi. The Italian exiles spread antitrinitarian views to Switzerland, Germany, Poland, Transylvania and Holland.\n\nThe \"Dialogues\" (1563) of Bernardino Ochino, while defending the Trinity, stated objections and difficulties with a force which captivated many. In his 27th Dialogue Ochino points to Hungary as a possible home of religious liberty. And in Poland and Hungary definitely anti-Trinitarian religious communities first formed and were tolerated.\n\nScattered expressions of anti-Trinitarian opinion appeared in Poland early. At the age of 80, Catherine, wife of Melchior Vogel or Weygel, was burned at Cracow (1539) for apostasy; whether her views embraced more than deism is not clear. The first synod of the (Calvinist) Reformed Church took place in 1555; the second Synod (1556) faced the theological challenges of Grzegorz Paweł z Brzezin (Gregory Pauli) and Peter Gonesius (Piotr z Goniądza), who were aware of the works of Servetus and of Italian antitrinitarians such as Matteo Gribaldi. The arrival of Giorgio Biandrata in 1558 furnished the party with a temporary leader.\n\nThe term \"Unitarian\" first appeared as \"unitaria religio\" in a document of the Diet of Lécfalva, Transylvania on 25 October 1600, though it was not widely used in Transylvania until 1638, when the formal \"recepta Unitaria Religio\" was published. The Polish Brethren began as a grouping of Arians and Unitarians who split from the Polish Calvinist Church in 1565, though by 1580 the Unitarian views of Fausto Sozzini (hence the adjective Socinian) had become the majority. Sozzini's grandson Andrzej Wiszowaty Sr. in 1665-1668 published \"Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum quos Unitarios vocant\" (\"Library of the Polish Brethren who are called Unitarians\" 4 vols. 1665–69). The name was introduced into English by the Socinian Henry Hedworth in 1673. Thereafter the term became common currency in English, though their detractors continued to label both Arian and Unitarian views as \"Socinian\".\n\nIn 1565, the Diet (Sejm) of Piotrków excluded anti-Trinitarians from the existing synod of the Polish Reformed Church (henceforth the \"Ecclesia maior\") and Unitarians began to hold their own synods as the \"Ecclesia minor\". Known by various other names (of which Polish brethren and Arian were the most common), at no time in its history did this body adopt for itself any designation save \"Christian\". Originally Arian (but excluding any worship of Christ), and Anabaptist, the \"Minor Church\" was (by 1588) brought round to the views of Fausto Sozzini, who had settled in Poland in 1579, and who denied the pre-existence of Christ, while accepting the virgin birth (see Socinianism).\n\nIn 1602 the nobleman Jakub Sienieński established among the non-Trinitarian community founded by his father at Raków, Kielce County the Racovian Academy and a printing-press, from which the Racovian Catechism was issued in 1605. In 1610 a Catholic reaction began, led by Jesuits. The establishment at Raków was suppressed in 1638, after two boys allegedly pelted a crucifix outside the town.\n\nFor twenty years 1639-1659 the Arians were tolerated, but public opinion widely considered them as collaborators with Sweden during The Deluge, and in 1660 the Polish Diet gave anti-Trinitarians the option of conformity or exile. The \"Ecclesia minor\" or Minor Church included many Polish magnates, but their adoption of the views of Sozzini, which precluded Christians from magisterial office, rendered them politically powerless.\n\nThe execution of the decree, hastened by a year, took place in 1660. Some conformed; a large number made their way to the Netherlands, where the Remonstrants admitted them to membership on the basis of the Apostles' Creed. Others, like Christopher Crell, went to the German frontier, Prussia and Lithuania. A contingent settled in Transylvania, not joining the Unitarian Church, but maintaining a distinct organization at Cluj until 1793.\n\nThe refugees who reached Amsterdam published the \"Bibliotheca fratrum polonorum\" (1665–1669), with the assistance of the Prussian emigre Christopher Sandius, embracing the works of Johannes Crellius, their leading theologian, Jonasz Szlichtyng, their chief Biblical commentator, Fausto Sozzini and Johann Ludwig von Wolzogen. The title page of this collection, bearing the words \"quos Unitarios vocant\", introduced the term \"Unitarian\" to Western Europe.\n\nThe term Unitarian (in Latin) was first used by Polish and Dutch Socinians from the 1660s.\n\nNo distinct trace of anti-Trinitarian opinion precedes the appearance of Giorgio Biandrata at the Transylvanian court in 1563. His influence was exerted on Ferenc Dávid (1510–1579), who was successively Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist and finally anti-Trinitarian. Some argue that the growth of anti-Trinitarian opinion in Transylvania and Hungary may have partly been due to the growing Islamic influence of the expanding Ottoman Empire at the time.\n\nIn 1564 Dávid was elected by the Calvinists as \"bishop of the Hungarian churches in Transylvania\", and appointed court preacher to John Sigismund, prince of Transylvania. His discussion of the Trinity began (1565) with doubts of the personality of the Holy Ghost.\n\nHis antagonist in public disputations was the Calvinist leader, Peter Melius (Bishop of Debrecen 1558-1572); his supporter was Biandrata. John Sigismund, adopting his court-preacher's views, issued (1568) an edict of religious liberty at the Diet of Torda, which allowed Dávid (retaining his existing title) to transfer his episcopate from the Calvinists to the anti-Trinitarians, Kolozsvár being evacuated by all but his followers.\n\nIn 1571 John Sigismund was succeeded by Stephen Báthory, a Catholic. Under the influence of Johann Sommer, rector of the Kolozsvár gymnasium, David (about 1572) abandoned the worship of Christ. The attempted accommodation by Fausto Sozzini only precipitated matters; tried as an innovator, Dávid died in prison at the Fortress of Déva (1579). The \"cultus\" of Christ became an established usage of the Church; it is recognized in the 1837 edition of the official hymnal, but removed in later editions.\nThe term \"unitarius\" made its first documentary appearance, \"unitaria religio\", in a decree of the Diet of Lécfalva (1600); though it was not officially adopted by the Church until 1638.\n\nIn 1618 the Unitarian Church condemned and withdrew from Simon Péchi and the Sabbatarians, a group with Judaic tendencies. The group continued to exist till the 1840s by which time many had converted to Judaism. In 1626 the \"Disciplina ecclesiastica\" was published by Bishop Bálint Radeczki (Latin: Valentinus Radecius, bishop 1616—1632). 1638 saw the Accord of Dés and suppression of the Unitarians.\n\nOf the line of twenty-three bishops the most distinguished were George Enyedi (1592–1597), whose \"Explicationes\" obtained European vogue, and Mihály Lombard de Szentábrahám (1737–1758), who rallied the forces of his Church, broken by persecution and deprivation of property, and gave them their traditional statement of faith. His \"Summa Universae Theologiae Christianae secundum Unitarios\" (published 1787), Socinian with Arminian modifications, was accepted by Joseph II as the official manifesto of doctrine, and so remains, though subscription to it has not been required since the 19th century.\n\nThe first secondary school in Transylvania was established in the late 18th century in Székelykeresztúr (Cristuru Secuiesc); this functions to this day, although as a state school.\n\nThe official title in Hungary is the Hungarian Unitarian Church, with a membership of about 25,000 members, whereas in Romania there is a separate church with the name of Unitarian Church of Transylvania and about 65,000 members, especially among the \"Székely\" population. In the past, the Unitarian bishop had a seat in the Hungarian parliament. The principal college of both churches is located at Cluj-Napoca (\"Kolozsvár\"), which is also the seat of the Transylvanian consistory; there were others at Turda (\"Torda\") and at Cristuru Secuiesc.\n\nUntil 1818 the continued existence of this body was largely unknown to English Unitarians ; relations subsequently became intimate. After 1860 a succession of students finished their theological education at Manchester College, Oxford; others at the Unitarian Home Missionary College.\n\nIn England Unitarianism was a protestant sect that had its roots in the Anabaptist radicals of the English Civil War. They adopted adult baptism, and Godly republicanism; and they were egalitarians who sought to promote extreme revolutionary ideals. The movement gained popularity among dissenting nonconformists in the early 18th century. English Presbyterians were attracted to the second city at Norwich, by its emerging scientific community, which in the wake of the Enlightenment was particularly strong in Scotland. They began to become a formal denomination in 1774 when Theophilus Lindsey organized meetings with Joseph Priestley, founding the first avowedly Unitarian congregation in the country, at Essex Street Church in London. In 1791 Lindsey and his colleague John Disney were behind the \"first organized denominational Unitarian society\", formally The Unitarian Society for promoting Christian Knowledge and the Practice of Virtue by the Distribution of Books but more simply known as the Unitarian Book Society. This was followed by The Unitarian Fund (1806), which sent out missionaries and financially supported poorer congregations. Unitarianism was not fully legal in the United Kingdom until the Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813, a bill largely pushed forward in Parliament by William Smith, and thus known sometimes under his name, or as the \"Unitarian Relief Act (Trinity Act)\" or \"The Unitarian Toleration Bill\". This did not grant them full civil rights while the oppressive Corporation Act and Test Act remained, and thus in 1819 the third significant Unitarian society was created, The Association for the Protection of the Civil Rights of Unitarians. In 1825 these three groups amalgamated into the British and Foreign Unitarian Association. A century later, this joined with the Sunday School Association to become the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches, which remains today the umbrella organisation for British Unitarianism.\n\nBetween 1548 (John Assheton) and 1612 we find few anti-Trinitarians, most of whom were either executed or forced to recant. Those burned included the Flemish surgeon George van Parris (1551); Patrick Pakingham (1555), a fellmonger; Matthew Hamont (1579), a ploughwright; John Lewes (1583); Peter Cole (1587), a tanner; Francis Kett (1589), physician and author; Bartholomew Legate (1612), a cloth-dealer and last of the Smithfield victims; and the twice-burned Edward Wightman (1612). In all these cases the anti-Trinitarian sentiments seem to have come from Holland; the last two executions followed the dedication to James I of the Latin version of the Racovian Catechism (1609).\n\nFausto Sozzini had died on the road, after expulsion from Kraków, Poland on 4 March 1604, but the Racovian Academy and printing press continued till 1639, exerting influence in England via the Netherlands.\n\nThe vogue of Socinian views, typified by men like Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland and Chillingworth, led to the abortive fourth canon of 1640 against Socinian books. The ordinance of 1648 made denial of the Trinity a capital offence, but it remained a dead letter, Cromwell intervening in the cases of Paul Best (1590–1657) and John Biddle (1616–1662).\n\nIn 1652–1654 and 1658–1662 Biddle held a Socinian conventicle in London; in addition to his own writings he reprinted (1651) and translated (1652) the Racovian Catechism, and the \"Life of Socinus\" (1653). His disciple Thomas Firmin (1632–1697), mercer and philanthropist, and friend of John Tillotson, adopted the more Sabellian views of Stephen Nye (1648–1719), a clergyman. Firmin promoted a remarkable series of controversial tracts (1690–1699).\n\nIn England the Socinian controversy, initiated by Biddle, preceded the Arian controversy initiated by Samuel Clarke's \"Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity\" (1712), although John Knowles was an Arian lay preacher at Chester in 1650. Arian or semi-Arian views had much vogue during the 18th century, both in the Church and among dissenters.\n\nThe word \"Unitarian\" had been circulating in private letters in England, in reference to imported copies of such publications as the \"Library of the Polish Brethren who are called Unitarians\" (1665), Henry Hedworth was the first to use the word \"Unitarian\" in print in English (1673), and the word first appears in a title in Stephen Nye's \"A brief history of the Unitarians, called also Socinians\" (1687). It was construed in a broad sense to cover all who, with whatever differences, held to the unipersonality of the Divine Being. Firmin later had a project of Unitarian societies \"within the Church\".\n\nThe first preacher to describe himself as Unitarian was Thomas Emlyn (1663–1741) who gathered a London congregation in 1705. This was contrary to the Act of Toleration 1689, which excluded all who should preach or write against the Trinity.\n\nIn 1689 Presbyterians and Independents had coalesced, agreeing to drop both names and to support a common fund. The union in the London fund was ruptured in 1693; in course of time differences in the administration of the two funds led to the attaching of the Presbyterian name to theological liberals, though many of the older Unitarian chapels were Independent foundations, and at least half of the Presbyterian chapels (of 1690–1710) came into the hands of Congregationalists.\n\nThe free atmosphere of dissenting academies (colleges) favoured new ideas. The effect of the Salters' Hall conference (1719), called for by the views of James Peirce (1673–1726) of Exeter, was to leave dissenting congregations to determine their own orthodoxy; the General Baptists had already (1700) condoned defections from the common doctrine. Leaders in the advocacy of a purely humanitarian christology came largely from the Independents, such as Nathaniel Lardner (1684–1768), Caleb Fleming (1698–1779), Joseph Priestley (1733–1804) and Thomas Belsham (1750–1829).\n\nIsaac Newton was an anti-Trinitarian, and possibly a Unitarian (though he may have been Sabellian). One of his last visitors before his death in 1727 was Samuel Crellius from Lithuania.\n\nThe formation of a distinct Unitarian denomination dates from the secession (1773) of Theophilus Lindsey (1723–1808) from the Anglican Church, on the failure of the Feathers petition to parliament (1772) for relief from subscription. Lindsey's secession had been preceded in Ireland by that of William Robertson D.D. (1705–1783), who has been called \"the father of Unitarian nonconformity\". It was followed by other clerical secessions, mostly of men who left the ministry, and Lindsey's hope of a Unitarian movement from the Anglican Church was disappointed. The congregation he established at Essex Street Chapel, with the assistance of prominent ministers such as Joseph Priestley and Richard Price, was a pivot for change. Legal difficulties with the authorities were overcome with the help of barrister John Lee, who later became Attorney-General. By degrees Lindsey's type of theology superseded Arianism in a considerable number of dissenting congregations.\n\nThe Act of Toleration 1689 was amended (1779) by substituting belief in Scripture for belief in the Anglican (doctrinal) articles. In 1813 the penal acts against deniers of the Trinity were repealed by the Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813, largely pushed through Parliament by William Smith, M.P., abolitionist, and grandfather of Florence Nightingale. In 1825 the British and Foreign Unitarian Association was formed as an amalgamation of three older societies, for literature (1791), mission work (1806) and civil rights (1818).\n\nAttacks were made on properties held by Unitarians, but created prior to 1813. The Wolverhampton Chapel case began in 1817, the more important Hewley Fund case in 1830; both were decided against the Unitarians in 1842. Appeal to parliament resulted in the Dissenters' Chapels Act (1844), which secured that, so far as trusts did not specify doctrines, twenty-five years tenure legitimated existing usage.\n\nThe period 1800-1850 is characterized by a shift in the British Unitarian movement's position from questioning the doctrine of the Trinity or the pre-existence of Christ to questioning the miraculous, inspiration of Scripture, and the virgin birth, though not yet at this point questioning the resurrection of Christ.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the drier Priestley-Belsham type of Unitarianism, bound up with a determinist philosophy, was gradually modified by the influence of Channing (see below), whose works were reprinted in numerous editions and owed a wide circulation to the efforts of Robert Spears (1825–1899). Another American influence, potent in reducing the rigid though limited supernaturalism of Belsham and his successors, was that of Theodore Parker (1810–1860). At home the teaching of James Martineau (1805–1900), resisted at first, was at length powerfully felt, seconded as it was by the influence of John James Tayler (1797–1869) and of John Hamilton Thom (1808–1894).\n\nEnglish Unitarianism produced some well-known scholars, e.g. John Kenrick (1788–1877), James Yates (1789–1871), Samuel Sharpe (1799–1881), but few popular preachers, though George Harris (1794–1859) is an exception. For the education of its ministry it supported Manchester College at Oxford (which deduced its ancestry from the academy of Richard Frankland, begun 1670), the Unitarian Home Missionary College (founded in Manchester in 1854 by John Relly Beard, D.D., and William Gaskell), and the Presbyterian College, Carmarthen. It also produced the notable Chamberlain family of politicians: Joseph Chamberlain, Austen Chamberlain, and Neville Chamberlain, and the Courtauld and Tate industrialist dynasties.\n\nEnglish Unitarian periodical literature begins with Priestley's \"Theological Repository\" (1769–1788), and includes the \"Monthly Repository\" (1806–1838), \"The Christian Reformer\" (1834–1863), \"The Christian Teacher\" (1835–1844), \"The Prospective Review\" (1845–1854), \"The National Review\" (1855–1864), the \"Theological Review\" (1864–1879), and \"The Hibbert Journal\", one of the enterprises of the Hibbert Trust, founded by Robert Hibbert (1770–1849) and originally designated the Anti-Trinitarian Fund. This came into operation in 1853, awarded scholarships and fellowships, supported an annual lectureship (1878–1894), and maintained (from 1894) a chair of ecclesiastical history at Manchester College.\n\nMuch has been made of the execution (1697) at Edinburgh of the student Thomas Aikenhead, convicted of blaspheming the Trinity. The works of John Taylor, D.D. (1694–1761) on original sin and atonement had much influence in the east of Scotland, as we learn from Robert Burns; and such men as William Dalrymple, D.D. (1723–1814) and William M'Gill, D.D. (1732–1807), along with other \"moderates\", were under suspicion of similar heresies. Overt Unitarianism has never had much vogue in Scotland. The only congregation of old foundation is at Edinburgh, founded in 1776 by a secession from one of the \"fellowship societies\" formed by James Fraser, of Brea (1639–1699). The mission enterprises of Richard Wright (1764–1836) and George Harris (1794–1859) produced results of no great permanence.\n\nThe Scottish Unitarian Association was founded in 1813, mainly by Thomas Southwood Smith, M.D., the sanitary reformer. The McQuaker Trust was founded (1889) for propagandist purposes.\n\nParadoxically, one of the reasons for the relative weakness of Unitarian movement in Scotland in the early 19th century may be the continuing presence of conservative, and therefore Bible-fundamentalist, non-Trinitarian, Arian, and Socinian views in dissenting chapels and among the Scottish followers of the Restoration Movement and Millerite movement. The Non-Trinitarian believers in Scotland were often more sympathetic to the Unitarians of a century earlier than to the more liberal views of Wright, Harris and Southwood Smith. A notable Bible-fundamentalist Scottish Unitarian was J. S. Hyndman, author of \"Lectures on The Principles of Unitarianism\" (Alnwick, 1824) This conservative non-Trinitarian presence can be demonstrated by the response in Scotland, relative both to America and to his home town London, of the call of the first Christadelphian John Thomas. The first congregations following Thomas' Socinian and Adventist teachings in 1848-1849 were predominantly Scottish. And while the Christadelphians initially made more of their Millennialist teachings, the christological legacy of 17th century unitarians such as John Biddle is evident and acknowledged.\n\nThere are currently four Unitarian churches in Scotland: Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow.\n\nControversy respecting the Trinity was excited in Ireland by the prosecution at Dublin (1703) of Thomas Emlyn (see above), resulting in fine and imprisonment, for rejecting the deity of Christ. In 1705 the Belfast Society was founded for theological discussion by Presbyterian ministers in the north, with the result of creating a body of opinion adverse to subscription to the Westminster standards. Toleration of dissent, withheld in Ireland till 1719, was then granted without the requirement of any doctrinal subscription. Next year a movement against subscription was begun in the General Synod of Ulster, culminating (1725) in the placing of the advocates of non-subscription, headed by John Abernethy, D.D., of Antrim into a presbytery by themselves. This Presbytery of Antrim was excluded (1726) from jurisdiction, though not from communion. During the next hundred years its members exercised great influence on their brethren of the synod; but the counter-influence of the mission of the Scottish Seceders (from 1742) produced a reaction. The Antrim Presbytery gradually became Arian; the same type of theology affected more or less the Southern Association, known since 1806 as the Synod of Munster. From 1783 ten of the fourteen presbyteries in the Synod of Ulster had made subscription optional; the synod's code of 1824 left \"soundness in the faith\" to be ascertained by subscription or by examination. Against this compromise Henry Cooke, D.D. (1788–1868), directed all his powers, and was ultimately (1829) successful in defeating his Arian opponent, Henry Montgomery, LL.D. (1788–1865). Montgomery led a secession which formed (1830) the Remonstrant Synod of Ulster, comprising three presbyteries.\n\nIn 1910 the Antrim Presbytery, Remonstrant Synod and Synod of Munster united as the General Synod of the Non-subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland, with 38 congregations and some mission stations. Till 1889 they maintained two theological chairs in Belfast, where John Scott Porter (1801–1880) pioneered biblical criticism; they afterwards sent their students to England for their theological education, though in certain respects their views and practices remained more conservative than those of their English brethren. Irish Unitarian periodical literature began in 1832 with the \"Bible Christian\", followed by the \"Irish Unitarian Magazine\", the \"Christian Unitarian\", the \"Disciple\" and the \"Non-subscribing Presbyterian\".\n\nThe history of Unitarian thought in the United States can be roughly divided into four periods:\n\n\nUnitarianism in the United States followed essentially the same development as in England, and passed through the stages of Arminianism, Arianism, to rationalism and a modernism based on an acceptance of the results of the comparative study of all religions. In the early 18th century Arminianism presented itself in New England, and sporadically elsewhere. This tendency was largely accelerated by a backlash against the \"Great Awakening\" under Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield. Before the War of Independence Arianism showed itself in individual instances, and French influences were widespread in the direction of deism, though they were not organized into any definite utterance by religious bodies.\n\nAs early as the middle of the 18th century Harvard College represented the most advanced thought of the time, and a score or more of clergymen in New England preached what was essentially Unitarianism. The most prominent of these men was Jonathan Mayhew (1720–1766), pastor of the West Church in Boston, Massachusetts, from 1747 to 1766. He preached the strict unity of God, the subordinate nature of Christ, and salvation by character. Charles Chauncy (1705–1787), pastor of the First Church from 1727 until his death, the chief opponent of Edwards in the great revival, was both a Unitarian and a Universalist. Other Unitarians included Ebenezer Gay (1698–1787) of Hingham, Samuel West (1730–1807) of New Bedford, Thomas Barnard (1748–1814) of Newbury, John Prince (1751–1836) and William Bentley (1758–1819) of Salem, Aaron Bancroft (1755–1836) of Worcester, and several others.\n\nThe first official acceptance of the Unitarian faith on the part of a congregation was by King's Chapel in Boston, which settled James Freeman (1759–1835) in 1782, and revised the Prayer Book into a mild Unitarian liturgy in 1785. The Rev. William Hazlitt (father of the essayist and critic), visiting the United States in 1783–1785, published the fact that there were Unitarians in Philadelphia, Boston, Charleston, Pittsburgh, Hallowell, on Cape Cod, and elsewhere. Unitarian congregations were organized at Portland and Saco in 1792 by Thomas Oxnard; in 1800 the First Church in Plymouth—the congregation founded by the Pilgrims in 1620—accepted the more liberal faith. Joseph Priestley emigrated to the United States in 1794, and organized a Unitarian Church at Northumberland, Pennsylvania, the same year and one at Philadelphia in 1796. His writings had a considerable influence.\n\nThus from 1725 to 1825, Unitarianism was gaining ground in New England, and to some extent elsewhere. The first distinctive manifestation of the change was the inauguration of Henry Ware (1764–1845) as professor of divinity at Harvard College, in 1805.\n\nIn the same year appeared Unitarian books by John Sherman (1772–1828) and another in 1810 by Noah Worcester (1758–1837). At the opening of the 19th century, with one exception, all the churches of Boston were occupied by Unitarian preachers, and various periodicals and organizations expressed their opinions. Churches were established in New York City, Baltimore, Washington, Charleston, and elsewhere during this period.\n\nThe next period of American Unitarianism, from about 1800 to about 1835, can be thought of as formative, mainly influenced by English philosophy, semi-supernatural, imperfectly rationalistic, devoted to philanthropy and practical Christianity. Dr. Channing was its distinguished exponent.\n\nThe first official acceptance of the Unitarian faith on the part of a congregation in America was by King's Chapel in Boston, which settled James Freeman (1759–1853) in 1782, and revised the Prayer Book into a mild Unitarian liturgy in 1785. In 1800, Joseph Stevens Buckminster became minister of the Brattle Street Church in Boston, where his brilliant sermons, literary activities, and academic attention to the German \"New Criticism\" helped shape the subsequent growth of Unitarianism in New England. Unitarian Henry Ware (1764–1845) was appointed as the Hollis professor of divinity at Harvard College, in 1805. Harvard Divinity school then shifted from its conservative roots to teach Unitarian theology. Buckminster's close associate William Ellery Channing (1780–1842) was settled over the Federal Street Church in Boston, 1803; and in a few years he became the leader of the Unitarian movement. At first mystical rather than rationalistic in his theology, he took part with the \"Catholic Christians\", as they called themselves, who aimed at bringing Christianity into harmony with the progressive spirit of the time. His essays on \"The System of Exclusion and Denunciation in Religion\" (1815), and \"Objections to Unitarian Christianity Considered\" (1819), made him a defender of Unitarianism. His sermon on \"Unitarian Christianity\", preached at First Unitarian Church of Baltimore in 1819, at the ordination of Jared Sparks, and that at New York in 1821, made him its interpreter.\n\nThe result of the \"Unitarian Controversy\" (1815) was a growing division in the Congregational churches, which was emphasized in 1825 by the formation of the American Unitarian Association at Boston. It was organized \"to diffuse the knowledge and promote the interests of pure Christianity\" and it published tracts and books, supported poor churches, sent out missionaries into every part of the country, and established new churches in nearly all the states. Essentially non-sectarian, with little missionary zeal, the Unitarian movement has grown slowly; and its influence has chiefly operated through general culture and the literature of the country. Many of its clergymen have been trained in other denominations; but the Harvard Divinity School was distinctly Unitarian from its formation, in 1816, to 1870, when it became a non-sectarian department of the university. The Meadville Lombard Theological School was founded at Meadville, Pennsylvania in 1844, and the Starr King School for the Ministry at Berkeley, California in 1904.\n\n\"The History of Essex Hall\", written in 1959 by Mortimer Rowe, the Secretary (i.e. chief executive) of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches for its first twenty years, claims that the BFUA and AUA were founded entirely coincidentally on the same day, 26 May 1825.\n\nA third period (\"see\" Transcendentalism), from about 1835 to about 1885, profoundly influenced by German idealism, was increasingly rationalistic, though its theology was largely flavoured by mysticism. As a reaction against this, the National Unitarian Conference was organized in 1865, and adopted a distinctly Christian platform, affirming that its members were \"disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ\".\n\nThe more rationalistic minority thereupon formed the Free Religious Association, \"to encourage the scientific study of theology and to increase fellowship in the spirit.\" The Western Unitarian Conference later accepted the same position, and based its \"fellowship on no dogmatic tests, but affirmed a desire \"to establish truth, righteousness and love in the world.\" In addition, the WUC claimed belief in God was not a necessary component of Unitarian belief.\n\nThis period of controversy and of vigorous theological development practically came to an end soon after 1885. Its cessation was assured by the action of the national conference at Saratoga, New York in 1894, when it was affirmed by a nearly unanimous vote that: \"These churches accept the religion of Jesus, holding, in accordance with his teaching, that practical religion is summed up in love to God and love to man. The conference recognizes the fact that its constituency is Congregational in tradition and polity. Therefore it declares that nothing in this constitution is to be construed as an authoritative test; and we cordially invite to our working fellowship any who, while differing from us in belief, are in general sympathy with our spirit and our practical aims.\" The leaders of this period were Ralph Waldo Emerson with his idealism and Theodore Parker with his acceptance of Christianity as absolute religion.\n\nThe fourth period, beginning about 1885, has been one of rationalism, recognition of universal religion, large acceptance of the scientific method and ideas and an ethical attempt to realize what was perceived as to be the higher affirmations of Christianity. It has been marked by a general harmony and unity, by steady growth in the number of churches and by a widening fellowship with all other similarly minded movements.\n\nThis phase was shown in the organization of The International Council of Unitarian and other Liberal Religious Thinkers and Workers at Boston on 25 May 1900, \"to open communication with those in all lands who are striving to unite pure religion and perfect liberty, and to increase fellowship and co-operation among them.\" This council has held biennial sessions in London, Amsterdam, Geneva and Boston. During the period after 1885 the influence of Emerson became predominant, modified by the more scientific preaching of Minot Judson Savage, who found his guides in Darwin and Spencer.\n\nBeyond its own borders the body obtained recognition through the public work of such men as Henry Whitney Bellows and Edward Everett Hale, the remarkable influence of James Freeman Clarke and Thomas Lamb Eliot, and the popular power of Robert Collyer. The number of Unitarian churches in the United States in 1909 was 461, with 541 ministers. The church membership then, really nominal, may be estimated at 100,000. The periodicals were \"The Christian Register\", weekly, Boston; \"Unity\", weekly, Chicago; \"The Unitarian\", monthly, New York; \"Old and New\", monthly, Des Moines; \"Pacific Unitarian\", San Francisco.\n\nIn 1961, the American Unitarian Association merged with the Universalist Church of America, forming the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA).\n\nStrictly speaking, modern-day Unitarian Universalism is not Unitarian in theology. Despite its name, this denomination does not necessarily promote either belief in One God or universal salvation. It is merely the inheritor of the Unitarian and Universalist church system in America. Though there are Unitarians within the UUA, there is no creed or doctrine that one must affirm to join a Unitarian Universalist congregation. This makes it very different from many other faith groups. Today, the majority of Unitarian Universalists do not identify themselves as Christians. Jesus and the Bible are generally treated as exceptional sources of inspiration, along with the holy people and traditions around the world. Unitarian Universalists base their community on a set of Principles and Purposes rather than on a prophet or creed. Notable Unitarian Universalists include Tim Berners-Lee (founder of the World Wide Web), Pete Seeger, U. S. Congressman Pete Stark, former U. S. Senator Mike Gravel and Christopher Reeve.\n\nThe decline of specifically Christian theology in the Unitarian churches in the United States has prompted several revival movements. Unitarian Christians within the UUA formed, the Unitarian Universalist Christian Fellowship (UUCF) in 1945, a fellowship within UUA just for Christians, who were gradually becoming a minority. Similarly, the American Unitarian Conference (AUC) was founded in 2000 with 4 congregations, but unlike the UUCF, the AUC remains outside the UUA. The AUC's mission is \"renewal of the historic Unitarian faith\", and promotes a set of God-centered religious principles, but like Unitarian Universalism, it does not impose a creed on its members.\n\nUnitarians in America, because of the developments with the Unitarian churches, have generally taken one of three courses of action to find communities in which to worship God. Some have stayed within the Unitarian churches, accepting the non-Christian nature of their congregation, but have found their needs met in the UUCF. Some Unitarians, because they felt that the mainstream UUA churches are not accepting of Christians, or that the larger Unitarian Universalist organizations are becoming too political and liberal to be considered a religious movement or faith, have decided to affiliate with the American Unitarian Conference. Most Christian Unitarians have sought out liberal Christian churches in other denominations and have made homes there.\n\nUnitarianism arrived in Canada from Iceland and Britain. Some Canadian congregations had services in Icelandic into living memory. The first Unitarian service in Canada was held in 1832 by a minister from England, Rev, David Hughes, in a school owned by the Workman family, who were Unitarians from Belfast. The Montreal congregation, founded in 1842, called their first permanent minister, the Rev. John Cordner, of the Remonstrant Synod of Ulster; he arrived in 1843 and served as their minister for thirty-six years. Then in 1845, a congregation in Toronto was founded whose first minister, William Adam, was a Scottish Baptist missionary who had served in India. Then other congregations formed, Hamilton in 1889, Ottawa in 1898, the First Icelandic Unitarian Church in Winnipeg in 1891, a congregation in Vancouver in 1909 and a congregation in Victoria in 1910. Individual Canadian congregations had ties to the British association until they were disrupted by World War II, when relations to Unitarians in the United States became stronger.\n\nUniversalism found its way to Canada during the 19th century, for the most part, though not entirely, brought by settlers from the United States. The Universalist concepts of universal reconciliation, a loving and forgiving God, and the brother/sisterhood of all people, were welcomed by those for whom the partialist view or predestination were no longer acceptable. Universalist congregations formed, with the exception of the congregation in Halifax in 1837, mostly in rural towns and villages in lower Quebec and the Maritimes, and in southern Ontario. Universalism in Canada followed a corresponding decline as in the United States, and today the three remaining congregations at Olinda, Ontario founded in 1880, North Hatley, Quebec founded in 1886, and Halifax, Nova Scotia have since the 1960s been part of the Canadian Unitarian Council (CUC).\n\nThe CUC was formed on May 14, 1961, one day before the UUA in the United States, but the two functioned in close association until money exchange and other complications led to greater independence, with the CUC in 2002 assuming the direct delivery of services to Canadian congregations which was formerly delivered by the UUA. The UUA continues to provide ministerial settlement services to CUC member congregations.\n\nThe Unitarian Service Committee, established during World War II as an overseas emergency relief agency, began under the capable direction of Dr. Lotta Hitschmanova and initially supported largely by Unitarians, now continues as a separate agency called USC Canada which draws support throughout Canada for its humanitarian work in many parts of the world.\n\nThe first ordination of a Canadian Unitarian minister after the organizational separation of the CUC and the UUA was held at the First Unitarian Church of Victoria, British Columbia, in 2002. Rev. Brian Kiely, who was to give the ordination sermon, was told (partly in jest) he must define Canadian Unitarianism, as Rev. Channing had at that New England ordination sermon of 1819. The simile Rev. Kiely chose was that Canadian Unitarianism is like a doughnut, the richness is in the circle of fellowship, not a creedal centre.\n\nIn 1928 the British and Foreign Unitarian Association merged with the Sunday School Association, with which it had been sharing offices for decades, as the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches. The General Assembly is still the umbrella organisation for British Unitarianism, which has its headquarters, Essex Hall, in the same place in central London.\n\nIn May 2004 Rev. Peter Hughes, vice-chairman of the East Lancashire Unitarian Mission, and a minister at Chowbent Chapel founded in 1645 in Atherton, Greater Manchester, published an article in the movement's journal, \"The Inquirer\", and gave an interview to \"The Times\" where he warned of the extinction of the Unitarian Church. According to \"The Times\", \"the church has fewer than 6,000 members in Britain; half of whom are aged over 65.\" He added, referring to Toxteth Chapel in Liverpool, the movement's oldest building, where he was brought up, \"they have had no minister since 1976 and the Unitarian cause there is effectively dead.\" The denomination's president, Dawn Buckle, a retired lecturer in education, denied that the movement was in a terminal phase and described it as a \"thriving community capable of sustaining growth\". There are more than 180 Unitarian congregations in Britain as part of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches.\n\nEntirely separate from the General Assembly, and generally with no historical descent from the British and Foreign Unitarian Association (1825–1928), there are a number of other denominations and small groups which look to earlier periods of Unitarianism as influences. This includes both groups looking back to the early Polish, Dutch and English \"Socinians\" of the 17th century such as the Restoration Fellowship of Sir Anthony Buzzard, 3rd Baronet, and those looking to the later \"biblical unitarianism\" of Robert Spears. Many of these groups are nontrinitarian in theology, liberal in some political areas - such as conscientious objection, but fundamentalist in regard to the Bible, and conservative in areas such as homosexuality or women priests. Some of these groups however do have women ministers.\n\nRecently some religious groups have adopted the term \"Biblical Unitarianism\" to distinguish their theology from modern liberal Unitarianism.\n\nThere are currently four separate groups of Unitarians in Germany:\n\nIn 1900 \"Det fri Kirkesamfund\" (literally, The Free Congregation) was founded by a group of liberal Christians in Copenhagen. Since 1908, the church is outside the Folkekirke (the Danish Lutheran state church). In Aarhus, another Unitarian congregation was founded at this time by the Norwegian Unitarian pastor and writer Kristofer Janson (1841–1917); it has since closed.\nOften labeled and considered as a \"pioneer\" or \"precursor\" (in a spiritual manner) to the Unitarian movement in Denmark was the Icelandic theologian Magnús Eiríksson (1806–1881), who lived in Copenhagen from 1831 until his death in 1881.\n\nInspired by the writings of Theodore Parker the Swedish writer Klas Pontus Arnoldson founded in Gothenburg in 1871 the Unitarian association \"Sanningssökarna\" (\"The Truth Seekers\") – later also found in Stockholm. This association also published the periodical \"Sanningssökaren\" (\"The Truth Seeker\"). Two other Unitarian associations were founded in 1882 (one of them in Stockholm). In 1888 Unitarians asked the Swedish King for permission to establish yet another Unitarian association in Gothenburg but was turned down because Unitarianism was not regarded as a Christian religion. Later many Unitarians turned to theosophy. In 1974 members of The Religion and Culture Association in Malmö founded The Free Church of Sweden and Rev. Ragnar Emilsen would be its pastor (ordained 1987 to Unitarian minister for Sweden and Finland and later the first to become Unitarian bishop of Scandinavia, he died February 2008). In 1999 the church changed its name to The Unitarian Church in Sweden.\n\nIn 1892 and 1893 the Norwegian Unitarian ministers Hans Tambs Lyche and Kristofer Janson returned from America and at once started independently of each other to introduce Unitarianism. In 1894 Tambs Lyche failed to organize a Unitarian Church in Oslo (then Kristiania) but managed to publish Norway's first Unitarian periodical (Free Words). In January 1895 Kristofer Janson founded The Church of Brotherhood in Oslo which was to be the first Unitarian church – where he stayed as the congregation's pastor only for 3 years. In 1904 Herman Haugerud was to return to Norway from America and to become the last Unitarian pastor to The Unitarian Society (which The Church of Brotherhood now was renamed). Pastor Haugerud died in 1937 and the Unitarian church ceased to exist shortly thereafter. Between 1986 and 2003 different Unitarian groups were active in Oslo. In 2004 these merged into The Unitarian Association which registered as religious society according to Norwegian law on 20 April 2005 under the name The Unitarian Association (The Norwegian Unitarian Church). Later \"Bét Dávid\" has been added to the name: The Bét Dávid Unitarian Association (The Norwegian Unitarian Church). The church is akin to both Transylvanian Unitarianism and Judaism, hence the name \"bét\" referring to the Hebrew word for \"house\" and \"Dávid\" which is the name of the first Transylvanian Unitarian bishop Dávid Ferenc (1510–1579). In 2006 this church was associated with the International Council of Unitarians and Universalists (ICUU). Since 2007 there is also a Unitarian Universalist Fellowship independent of The Norwegian Unitarian Church. This fellowship is located in the Oslo area.\n\nAlthough the pioneer and first martyr of European Unitarianism was a Spaniard,\nMichael Servetus, the Spanish Inquisition and the religious hegemony of the Roman Catholic Church over both the State and the Spanish society, blocked for centuries any possibility of developing a Unitarian Church in Spain.\n\nThis situation began to change in the 19th century. A liberal Spanish writer and former priest, José María Blanco-White, became a Unitarian during his exile in England and remained so until the end of his life (1841). At the end of the century, a group of liberal Spanish intellectuals and reformers, the Krausistas (who received this name for being followers of German idealist philosopher Karl Krause), were admirers of American Unitarian leaders William Ellery Channing and Theodore Parker, and wished that natural religion and religious rationalism were more present in Spain, although they did not create any liberal church to push that process forward.\n\nThe Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) put an end to any expectations of change and liberal developments in Spain for several decades. After the death of dictator Francisco Franco and the approval of the Spanish Constitution of 1978, religious freedom was finally established in Spain (although still with many restrictions in actual practice). In 2000, the Sociedad Unitaria Universalista de España (SUUE) was founded in Barcelona, and in 2001 it became a member of the International Council of Unitarians and Universalists (ICUU). In \"2005\" it changed its name to the Unitarian Universalist \"Religious\" Society of Spain in order to achieve legal status as a religious organization under the Spanish law on Religious Freedom, but the application was also rejected.\n"}

A biting religious satire, it was also produced, directed, and co-written by Marty Feldman.\n\nA naive monk, Brother Ambrose (Feldman), is sent by the abbot on a mission to raise $5000 in order to save their monastery from closing. He goes to Hollywood where he encounters a number of eccentric characters. He is at first robbed and later befriended by con artist Dr. Sebastian Melmoth (Boyle), and meets a prostitute named Mary (Lasser) who lets him stay at her apartment. Mary grows to care for Ambrose and seduces him while he is taking a cold shower to try to alleviate his lustful thoughts about her. While he is in Hollywood, he visits several churches including a service at the Church of Divine Profit, performed by the televangelist Armageddon T. Thunderbird (Kaufman) in which he sees the focus of the sermon being a request for money in exchange for salvation. Ambrose is angered by this message and tries to meet a number of times with Thunderbird, being ejected each time. \n\nDr. Melmoth and Ambrose travel the city in a modified school bus, in which they hold church services for donations. During one service, the brakes of the bus release and the bus rolls downhill into a river. The passengers escape safely in the river and are shown on the local news being baptized by the pair, which catches Thunderbird's attention. He prays to G. O. D. for guidance and it tells him to work with Ambrose to make more money because Ambrose is an innocent and has a clean image. \n\nThunderbird has his minions kidnap Ambrose and bring him to his office where he outlines a plan for his own brand of church on wheels. He says he will pay Ambrose the $5000 the monastery needs if he assists him. While they are talking, Thunderbird mentions that G. O. D. (Richard Pryor) audibly talks to him when he prays to him and Ambrose is surprised because he himself has never heard from God in this way. Ambrose agrees to work with Thunderbird and they go across the country from town to town holding services in their own bus. \n\nOne day at Thunderbird's headquarters, Ambrose overhears Thunderbird praying to G. O. D. in his private chamber and when he hears G. O. D. speak back to him, he is intrigued. When Thunderbird leaves, he sneaks into the chamber and discovers that G. O. D. (General Organizational Directivatator) is a sophisticated master computer, linked to all of Thunderbird's finances and operations. He talks with G. O. D. and reads the Bible to it, giving it morality and a conscience. G. O. D. decides to give all of Thunderbird's money away and tells Ambrose what to do to accomplish this, which results in bags of money being poured out of the office's window. Thunderbird discovers someone has been interfering with the computer and rushes back to headquarters where he tries to capture Ambrose and destroys the computer. Ambrose grabs the paid monastery mortgage certificate from Thunderbird's office and escapes in a chase through the city. \n\nWhile Mary and Dr. Melmoth look for Ambrose during his escape, she learns that Melmoth is her father that left her family when she was a child, due to a distinctive tattoo she sees on his leg. They eventually find Ambrose and rescue him from the people chasing him.\n\nAmbrose goes back to the monastery and gives the abbot the mortgage certificate, then leaves and marries Mary, who is pregnant from their single night together. The end titles show Melmoth's bus traveling down the road, saying they \"all lived happily hereafter\".\n\nLasser is the last surviving member of the above cast.\n\nThe name \"Sebastian Melmoth\" was a pseudonym used by Oscar Wilde.\n\n"}
{"id": "673799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=673799", "title": "Intercession", "text": "Intercession\n\nIntercession or intercessory prayer is the act of praying to a deity on behalf of others. In Western Christianity, intercession forms a distinct form of prayer, alongside Adoration, Confession and Thanksgiving.\n\nThe Apostle Paul's exhortation to Timothy specified that intercession prayers can be made for those in authority.\n\nThe early Christians continued to practice intercessory prayer on behalf of others after Jesus' death. St. Ignatius of Antioch was one man who exhorted Christians to continue to pray for others, and especially for those who became Docetists or held other heretical beliefs. In his letter to the churches of Smyrna, St. Ignatius exhorts the Christians there to pray for other people: \"only you must pray to God for them, if by any means they may be brought to repentance, which, however, will be very difficult. Yet Jesus Christ, who is our true life, has the power of [effecting] this\". Throughout all of Ignatius's letters, the word for prayers of intercession appear nineteen times, and Ignatius asks for prayer \"for himself (eight times), for the Christian church in Syria (seven times), for persecutors, heretics, and all people generally (once each)\".\n\nSt. Ignatius and the other church fathers, such as Paul the Apostle, who were keen on intercessory prayer based this practice on Jesus' own teachings which required that one pray for others, especially one's enemies:\n\nAccording to Lionel Swain, of St. Edmund's College, Ware, St. Paul believed intercession to be one of the most important aspects of faith and praying life, as praying for others as a recurring theme in his works. Prayer acts as a way for St. Paul to acknowledge God's power. Intercessory prayer also acts as a way for the Apostle to \"share in ... the Father's redemptive love\". Paul believed that prayer transformed the person doing the praying, as much as the one being prayed for, which creates a stronger bond between him and God.\n\nProf. Dr Johannes van Oort, Professor Extraordinarius in the Department of Church History and Church Polity of the Faculty of Theology at the University of Pretoria, South Africa adds that, in addition to praying for wisdom, the early church was very much involved with different charismas, one of which being healing. Praying for other people's illnesses was another way that intercessory prayer was important in the early church, as healing was a sign of \"the power of God's Kingdom\". This gift of healing is specifically mentioned, among the other charismata, as a sign of being a true Christian by Irenaeus of Lyons in his text, \"Against Heresies\".\n\nIntercession of the saints is a doctrine held by the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches that saints may be asked to intercede (or pray) for others. The doctrine of requesting intercession from saints can be found in Christian writings from the 3rd century AD. \nThe 4th-century Apostles' Creed states belief in the communion of saints which certain Christian churches interpret as supporting the intercession of saints. Following the stream of Judaic-Christian tradition, Judaism allows for the petition of the saints. In Lutheran teachings all believers are saints, but prayer to saints who have been transferred to the Church Triumphant is forbidden.\n\nIn addition to praying for each other in life, early Christians would pray for those who had died. There is no unequivocal evidence that Christians began to pray for the dead before the third century AD. G. F. Hamilton argues that the earliest example of Church prayer on behalf of dead Christians are found in the Sacramentary of Serapion of Thmuis (350 AD). Rather than pray for the departed in regular church services on Sunday, these early Christians would hold special commemorative occasions during the week. There was a sharp distinction drawn between remembering and praying on behalf of the dead, and those who were the faithfully' departed\", where Christians would only pray for those who had died as believers. The First Epistle of Clement (95 AD) contains a prayer, while mainly for protection for the living, also includes the dead. Even quite early, a distinction was drawn between those who had died as Christians, and those who had died as unbelievers. In the \"Martyrdom of Polycarp\" (155 AD), Polycarp is killed and his bones are taken by fellow Christians and a shrine is set up to him, where they may remember his martyrdom. In contrast, the \"Apology of Aristides\" shows how those who were not Christians were grieved for, while the dead faithful were rejoiced over.\n\nAlthough the idea of intercession or mediation (Arabic: \"s̲h̲afāʿa\") has historically played a very prominent role in Islamic thought, it is not universally accepted by all Muslims in the present day. The Quran says that the pre-Islamic Arab pagan gods will not be able to intercede with God on behalf of humankind, and that \"the guilty\" (\"al-mujrimīn\", 74:41) will not benefit from any intercession on the Day of Judgment. However, \"intercession is mentioned in the Qurʾān with respect to angels praying for the believers and the Prophet praying for erring but repentant Muslims.\" Furthermore, it became an orthodox Islamic doctrine or \"cardinal belief\" that \"Muḥammad will intercede for all Muslims on the Day of Resurrection.\" While this particular tenet practically remained unchallenged throughout Islamic history, the widespread Shia practice of asking deceased saints for intercession by praying at their tombs have become contentious issues in the modern Islamic world, with all these different types of intercession often being labelled by Sunni, Salafi and Wahhabi Muslims as a type of polytheism, in a manner akin to the attitude of many Protestants towards the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox practice of saint-intercession.\nIn prophetic sayings there is intercession of martyrs for \"seventy relatives\" in the Hereafter. http://en.islamtoday.net/node/1318\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25414055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25414055", "title": "Khutu", "text": "Khutu\n\nKhutu was the name given to a material used by medieval Islamic cutlers for knife handles. The ultimate source of the material has been a matter of conjecture for more than a thousand years; Islamic polymath al-Biruni was among the first to investigate it and debate about the material—especially its source—continues to this day. The hypothesized sources for the material have included narwhal, walrus, and mammoth ivory, the frontal bones of bulls, goats, and birds, the teeth of snakes, fish, and hippopotamuses, and the root of a tree. The most recent investigation, by natural historian Chris Lavers, has pointed to the frontal boss of the horns of the muskox.\n\nKhutu has been ascribed properties other than those of a work material. It was, for example, described as an alexipharmic—a property that eventually was attached to alicorn, the supposed horn of the unicorn.\n\nIslamic polymath al-Biruni (973–1048) was among the first to investigate khutu, which he referred to as \"al-chutww\". He described it as being from the land of the Kirgiz in the northern part of the Turkish territory and mentioned that it was in great demand in Egypt. He noted that the material came in a variety of colours, with yellowish-green being best, followed by those coloured camphor, white, \"like the sun\", and dark grey. He also mentioned the beliefs that the material came from the forehead of the roc (an enormous bird from Arabic and Persian myths which was said to carry off and eat elephants) or the forehead of a hippopotamus, but did not seem to attach much weight to these ideas, noting that it was much more similar to the frontal bone of a bull or goat. He wrote: \"It originates from an animal; it is much in demand, and preserved in the treasuries among the Chinese who assert that it is a desirable article because the approach of poison causes it to exude.\"\n\nIn another work he described it as \"bigger than the hand in size\" and \"thicker than two fingers\" and mentioned that \"Amir Abu Ja'far bin Banu has a large box-like case made of long and broad khutu planks.\" Because the material gave off a fishy smell when burned, he felt that it was probably a marine creature of some kind, but he specifically noted an instance where someone was able to pass off walrus ivory for proper khutu, strongly implying that the two materials were distinct – at least to him.\n\nWriting shortly after al-Biruni, Kashgari mentioned khutu in his work \"Diwan Lughat at-Turk\" (c. 1075): \n\n\"Horn of a sea fish imported from China. It is (also) said that it is the root of a tree. It is used for knife handles. The presence of poison in food is put to the test by it because when broth or other dishes in the bowl are stirred with it the food cooks without fire (if poison is present in it), or if the horn is placed on a bowl it (the horn) sweats without steam.\"\nThe next investigation of khutu was by Ibn al-Akfani (1286–ca. 1348-49), who called the material \"chartut\". Although he cited al-Biruni's earlier work, he disagreed with a number of Al-Biruni's conclusions. For example, he favoured the theory that khutu came from the forehead of a large bird. He also offered a slightly different spectrum of possible colours for khutu (yellow, red, apricot, dust, black), though he did agree that the quality of the material varied with the colour.\n\nThe era of modern scholarship on the identity of khutu began with the work of the orientalist Berthold Laufer. The first paper was titled \"Arabic and Chinese Trade in Walrus and Narwhal Ivory\" and published in the journal \"T'oung Pao\" in 1913. Laufer provided a brief overview of the medieval scholarship and provided detailed information regarding the trade of narwhal and walrus ivory on the basis that khutu referred to one or both of those items. A second paper, titled \"Supplementary Notes on Walrus and Narwhal Ivory\" was published in 1916 in the same journal and provided some corrections and clarifications of his earlier work.\n\nWhile Laufer had detailed the Chinese end of the narwhal and walrus ivory trade, Richard Ettinghausen focused on the Arabic side. Like Laufer, he felt that khutu was probably walrus ivory, with perhaps some samples being narwhal ivory.\n\nThe most recent work on khutu has been done by Chris Lavers. In contrast to the early 20th century scholars, Lavers does not believe khutu to have been either walrus or narwhal ivory, but rather the frontal bone and associated horn material of the muskox, with some specimens perhaps coming from mammoth ivory. His primary evidence for this was the work of al-Biruni, particularly where he mentions that knowledgeable people could differentiate walrus ivory from proper khutu (a fact that Laufer could not have known in his earlier work, as the al-Biruni text mentioning it had not yet been translated). In \"The Natural History of Unicorns\" he acknowledges that Asian muskoxen were supposed to have become extinct about a thousand years before al-Biruni's investigations (see muskox for information regarding their extinction and reintroduction), but points out that there could well have been an isolated refugium of muskoxen existing in Asia until more modern times, that it was possible that there was trade in material goods between Asian arctic and North American arctic peoples, and also that frozen or fossilized muskoxen material could have been harvested in the same way that mammoth ivory was.\n"}

Ethiopian Jewish religious leaders are sometimes called kahen, a form of the same word, but the position is not hereditary and their duties are more like those of rabbis than kohanim in most Jewish communities.\n\nThe noun \"kohen\" is used in the Torah to refer to priests, whether Jewish or pagan, such as the \"kohanim\" (\"priests\") of Baal (2 Kings 10:19) or Dagon, though Christian priests are referred to in Hebrew by the term \"komer\" (). \"Kohanim\" can also refer to the Jewish nation as a whole, as in Exodus 19:6, part of the Parshath Yithro, where the whole of Israel is addressed as \"a kingdom of priests and a holy nation\". The word derives from a Semitic root common at least to the Central Semitic languages; the cognate Arabic word \"kāhin\" means \"soothsayer, augur\", or \"priest\".\n\nTranslations in the paraphrase of the Aramaic Targumic interpretations include \"friend\" in Targum Yonathan to 2 Kings 10:11, \"master\" in Targum to Amos 7:10, and \"minister\" in Mechilta to Parshah Jethro (Exodus 18:1–20:23). As a starkly different translation the title \"worker\" (Rashi on Exodus 29:30) and \"servant\" (Targum to Jeremiah 48:7), have been offered as a translation as well.\n\nThe status of priest \"kohen\" was conferred on Aaron, the brother of Moses, and his sons as an everlasting covenant or a covenant of salt. During the 40 years of wandering in the wilderness and until the Holy Temple was built in Jerusalem, the priests performed their priestly service in the portable Tabernacle. (, , , ) Their duties involved offering the daily and Jewish holiday sacrifices, and blessing the people in a Priestly Blessing, later also known as \"Nesiat Kapayim\" (\"Raising of the hands\").\n\nIn a broader sense, since Aaron was a descendant of the Tribe of Levi, priests are sometimes included in the term \"Levites\", by direct patrilineal descent. However, not all Levites are priests.\n\nWhen the Temple existed, most sacrifices and offerings could only be conducted by priests. Non-priest Levites (i.e. all those who descended from Levi, the son of Jacob, but not from Aaron) performed a variety of other Temple roles, including ritual slaughter of animals, song service by use of voice and musical instruments, and various tasks in assisting the priests in performing their service.\n\nThe Torah mentions Melchizedek king of Salem, identified by Rashi as being Shem the son of Noah, as a \"priest\" \"kohen\" to El Elyon (the supreme God) . The second is Potiphera, priest of Heliopolis, then Jethro, priest of Midian both pagan priests of their era.\n\nWhen Esau sold the birthright of the first born to Jacob, Rashi explains that the priesthood was sold along with it, because by right the priesthood belongs to the first-born. Only when the first-born (along with the rest of Israel) sinned in the incident of the golden calf, the priesthood was given to the Tribe of Levi, which had not been tainted by this incident.\n\nMoses was supposed to receive the priesthood along with the leadership of the Jewish people, but when he argued with God that he should not be the leader, God then chose Aaron as the recipient of the priesthood.\n\nAaron received the priesthood along with his children and any descendants that would be born subsequently. However, his grandson Phinehas had already been born, and did not receive the priesthood until he killed the prince of the Tribe of Simeon and the princess of the Midianites (). Thereafter, the priesthood has remained with the descendants of Aaron.\n\nThe Torah provides for specific vestments to be worn by the priests when they are ministering in the Tabernacle: \"And you shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, for dignity and for beauty\" (). These garments are described in detail in , and . The high priest wore eight holy garments (\"bigdei kodesh\"). Of these, four were of the same type worn by all priests, and four were unique to the Kohen Gadol.\n\nThose vestments which were common to all priests, were:\n\nThe vestments that were unique to the high priest were:\n\nThe high priest, like all priests, would minister barefoot when he was serving in the Temple. Like all of the priests, he had to immerse himself in the ritual bath before vesting and wash his hands and his feet before performing any sacred act. The Talmud teaches that neither the kohanim nor the Kohen Gadol were fit to minister unless they wore their priestly vestments: \"While they are clothed in the priestly garments, they are clothed in the priesthood; but when they are not wearing the garments, the priesthood is not upon them\" (B.Zevachim 17:B). It is further taught that just as the sacrifices facilitate an atonement for sin, so do the priestly garments (B.Zevachim 88b). The high priest had two sets of holy garments: the \"golden garments\" detailed above, and a set of white \"linen garments\" (\"bigdei ha-bad\") which he wore only on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) (). On that day, he would change his holy garments four times, beginning in the golden garments but changing into the Linen Garments for the two moments when he would enter the Holy of Holies (the first time to offer the blood of atonement and the incense, and the second time to retrieve the censer), and then change back again into the golden garments after each time. He would immerse in the ritual bath before each change of garments, washing his hands and his feet after removing the garments and again before putting the other set on. The linen garments were only four in number, those corresponding to the garments worn by all priests (undergarments, tunic, sash and turban), but made only of white linen, with no embroidery. They could be worn only once, new sets being made each year.\n\nIn every generation when the Temple was standing, one kohen would be singled out to perform the functions of the High Priest (Hebrew \"kohen gadol\"). His primary task was the Day of Atonement service. Another unique task of the high priest was the offering of a daily meal sacrifice; he also held the prerogative to supersede any priest and offer any offering he chose. Although the Torah retains a procedure to select a High Priest when needed, in the absence of the Temple in Jerusalem, there is no High Priest in Judaism today.\n\nKing David assigned each of the 24 priestly clans to a weekly watch (Heb. משמרת, \"mishmeret\") during which its members were responsible for maintaining the schedule of offerings at the Temple in Jerusalem, in accordance with . Prior to that time, the priestly courses numbered a mere eight. This newly instated a cycle of priestly courses, or priestly divisions, which repeated itself roughly twice each year.\n\nWhen the First and Second Temples were built, the priests of Aaron’s lineage assumed these roles in the Temple in Jerusalem. Each of the 24 groups consisted of six priestly families, with each of the six serving one day of the week. On the Sabbath day, all six worked in tandem. According to later rabbinical interpretation, these 24 groups changed every Sabbath at the completion of the Mussaf service.. However, on the biblical festivals all 24 were present in the Temple for duty.\n\nAccording to the Jerusalem Talmud (Ta‘anith 4:2 / 20a): “Four wards came up out of exile: Yedaiah, Harim, Pašḥūr and Immer. The prophets among them had made a stipulation with them, namely, that even if Jehoiariv should come up out of exile, the officiating ward that serves in the Temple at that time should not be rejected on his account, but rather, he is to become secondary unto them.”\n\nFollowing the Temple's destruction at the end of the First Jewish Revolt and the displacement to the Galilee of the bulk of the remaining Jewish population in Judea at the end of the Bar Kochva Revolt, Jewish tradition in the Talmud and poems from the period record that the descendants of each priestly watch established a separate residential seat in towns and villages of the Galilee, and maintained this residential pattern for at least several centuries in anticipation of the reconstruction of the Temple and reinstitution of the cycle of priestly courses. Specifically, this kohanic settlement region stretched from the Beit Netofa Valley, through the Nazareth region to Arbel and the vicinity of Tiberias. In subsequent years, there was a custom of publicly recalling every Sabbath in the synagogues the courses of the priests, a practice that reinforced the prestige of the priests' lineage.\n\nProfessor Yosef Tobi, describing a stone inscription found in Yemen and which contains a partial list of the names (in Hebrew) of the twenty-four priestly courses and their places of residence, writes: \"As for the probable strong spiritual attachment held by the Jews of Ḥimyar for the Land of Israel, this is also attested to by an inscription bearing the names of the \"miśmarōṯ\" (priestly wards), which was initially discovered in September 1970 by W. Müller and then, independently, by P. Grjaznevitch within a mosque in Bayt al-Ḥāḍir, a village situated near Tan‘im, east of Ṣanʻā’. This inscription has been published by several European scholars, but the seminal study was carried out by E.E. Urbach (1973), one of the most important scholars of rabbinic literature in the previous generation. It should be noted that the priestly wards were seen as one of the most distinctive elements in the collective memory of the Jewish people as a nation during the period of Roman and Byzantine rule in the Land of Israel following the destruction of the Second Temple, insofar as they came to symbolize Jewish worship within the Land.”\n\nIt is now uncertain when this stone inscription was first engraved, but certainly it dates back to a time near the Second Temple’s destruction. The complete list of sacerdotal names would normally have included twenty-four priestly wards. However, today, the stone inscription contains only a partial list of their names, with their former places of residence – beginning from the fourth ward, and ending with the fourteenth ward. This was because the stone had been partially broken away, as also part of which was hidden underground. This is the longest roster of names of this kind ever discovered unto this day:\n\nAlthough kohanim may assume their duties once they reached physical maturity, the fraternity of kohanim generally would not allow young kohanim to begin service until they reached the age of twenty, and some opinions state that this age was thirty. There was no mandatory retirement age. Only when a kohen became physically infirm could he no longer serve.\nA kohen may become disqualified from performing his service for a host of reasons, including, but not limited to, Tumah, marital defilements, and physical blemishes. Of importance is that the kohen is never permanently disqualified from service but is permitted to return to his normal duties once the disqualification ceases.\n\nThe kohanim were compensated for their service to the nation and in the Temple through the twenty-four kohanic gifts. Of these 24 gifts, 10 are listed as to be given even outside the land of Israel. An example of the gifts given to the kohen in the Diaspora are most notably the five shekels of the Pidyon haben ceremony, and the giving of the foreleg, cheeks and abomasum from each Kosher-slaughtered animal.\n\nTorah verses and rabbinical commentary to the Tanakh imply that the kohen has a unique leadership role amongst the nation of Israel. In addition to the well-known role of the kohen to officiate in the sacrificial activity in the Temple (the Korbanot), the kohen is presumed to have the responsibility of being knowledgeable in the laws and nuances of the Torah and to be able to give accurate instruction in those laws to the Jewish people.\n\nRabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch explains this responsibility as not being the exclusive Torah instructors, but working in tandem with the rabbinic leaders of the era, while other rabbinic greats – notably the Chasam Sofer and Maharitz Chayes – acknowledged a unique assignment of torah instruction to the descendents of Aaron.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Second Temple and the suspension of sacrificial offerings, the formal role of priests in sacrificial services came to an end temporarily (until the rebuilding of the temple once more). Kohanim, however, retain a formal and public ceremonial role in synagogue prayer services. Kohanim also have a limited number of other special duties and privileges in Jewish religious practice. These special roles have been maintained in Orthodox Judaism, and sometimes in Conservative Judaism. Reform Judaism does not afford any special status or recognition to kohanim.\n\nEvery Monday, Thursday and Shabbat in Orthodox synagogues (and many Conservative ones as well), a portion from the Torah is read aloud in the original Hebrew in front of the congregation. On weekdays, this reading is divided into three; it is customary to call a kohen for the first reading (\"aliyah\"), a Levite for the second reading, and a member of any other Tribe of Israel to the third reading. On Shabbat, the reading is divided into seven portions; a kohen is called for the first \"aliyah\" and a levite to the second, and a member of another tribe for the rest.\n\nIf a kohen is not present, it is customary in many communities for a levite to take the first \"aliyah\" \"bimkom kohen\" (in the place of a kohen) and an Israelite the second and succeeding ones. This custom is not required by halakha (Jewish law), however, and Israelites may be called up for all aliyot.\n\nIn the late 12th and early 13th century, Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg ruled that, in a community consisting entirely of kohanim, the prohibition on calling kohanim for anything but the first two and \"maftir\" \"aliyot\" creates a deadlock situation which should be resolved by calling women to the Torah for all the intermediate \"aliyot\".\n\nThe Conservative Rabbinical Assembly's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards (CJLS), consistent with the Conservative movement's general view of the role of kohanim, has ruled that the practice of calling a kohen to the first aliyah represents a custom rather than a law, and that accordingly, a Conservative rabbi is not obligated to follow it. As such, in some Conservative synagogues, this practice is not followed.\n\nThe kohanim participating in an Orthodox and some other styles of traditional Jewish prayer service also deliver the priestly blessing, during the repetition of the \"Shemoneh Esrei\". They perform this service by standing and facing the crowd in the front of the congregation, with their arms held outwards and their hands and fingers in a specific formation, with a Jewish prayer shawl or Talit covering their heads and outstretched hands so that their fingers cannot be seen. Kohanim living in Israel and many Sephardic Jews living in areas outside Israel deliver the priestly blessing daily; Ashkenazi Jews living outside Israel deliver it only on Jewish holidays.\n\nOutside the synagogue, the kohen leads the \"Pidyon Haben\" ceremony. This symbolic Redemption of the first-born son is based on the Torah commandment, \"and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man among your sons\".\n\nOrthodox Judaism recognizes the rules as being in full force.\n\nA priest of Aaron's lineage (i.e. Kohen) is forbidden by the Mosaic Law (Torah) to marry a divorced woman even if she were a native Israelite. Likewise, a male descendant from Aaron's line is prohibited to marry a Jewish woman who has had intercourse with a non-Jew, whether she had been raped or she had willfully done so. So, too, he cannot marry a Jewish woman whose birth was by a father who is a Kohen but who violated one of these prohibitions. If he went ahead and did one of these three things, his male issue born from such union is no longer a priest (i.e. Kohen), but rather becomes a \"Ḥallal\" - a term designating one who is no longer a priest, but profaned. A priest must maintain an untainted lineage, and his mother must be of Jewish birth. If he married a non-Jewish woman from the gentile nations, his children are no longer priests, but gentiles. Had a priest of Aaron's lineage transgressed this prohibition and married a divorced woman, and they had children together, all of his female issue - whether his, or his sons, or his grandchildren - would be prohibited from marrying into the priestly stock for all generations.\n\nRape poses an especially poignant problem. The pain experienced by the families of kohanim who were required to divorce their wives as the result of the rapes accompanying the capture of Jerusalem is alluded to in this Mishnah:\n\nIf a woman were imprisoned by non-Jews concerning money affairs, she is permitted to her husband, but if for some capital offense, she is forbidden to her husband. If a town were overcome by besieging troops, all women of priestly stock found in it are ineligible [to be married to priests or to remain married to priests], but if they had witnesses, even a slave, or even a bondswoman, these may be believed. But no man may be believed for himself. Rabbi Zechariah ben Hakatsab said, \"By this Temple, her hand did not stir from my hand from the time the non-Jews entered Jerusalem until they went out.\" They said to him: No man may give evidence of himself.\n\nThe Israeli rabbinate will not perform a marriage halakhically forbidden to a kohen. For example, a kohen cannot legally marry a divorced or converted woman in the State of Israel, although a foreign marriage would be recognized.\n\nConservative Judaism has issued an emergency \"takanah\" (rabbinical edict) temporarily suspending the application of the rules in their entirety, on the grounds that the high intermarriage rate threatens the survival of Judaism, and hence that any marriage between Jews is welcomed. The \"takanah\" declares that the offspring of such marriages are to be regarded as kohanim. The movement allows a kohen to marry a convert or divorcee for these reasons:\n\n\"Kohen\" was a status that traditionally referred to men, passed from father to son, although there were situations where a \"bat kohen,\" daughter of a kohen, enjoyed some special status. For example, the first-born son of a bat \"kohen\", or the first-born son of a \"bat levi\" (the daughter of any levite) did not require the ritual of \"Pidyon HaBen.\" \n\nIn addition, females, although they did not serve in the Tabernacle or the Temple, were permitted to eat or benefit from some of the 24 kohanic gifts. However, if a \"kohen\"'s daughter married a man from outside the kohanic line, she was no longer permitted to benefit from the kohanic gifts. Conversely, the daughter of a non-\"kohen\" who married a \"kohen\" took on the same rights as an unmarried daughter of a \"kohen\".\n\nToday, Orthodox and many Conservative rabbis maintain the position that only a man can act as a \"kohen\", and that a daughter of a \"kohen\" is recognized as a \"bat kohen\" only in those very limited ways that have been identified in the past. Other Conservative rabbis, along with some Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis, are prepared to give equal \"kohen\" status to the daughter of a \"kohen\".\n\nOrthodox Judaism maintains that the privileges and status of \"kohanim\" stem primarily from their offerings and activities in the Temple. Accordingly, in Orthodox Judaism only men can perform the Priestly Blessing and receive the first \"aliyah\" during the public Torah reading, and women are generally not permitted to officiate in a \"Pidyon HaBen\" ceremony. However, the question of what acts (if any) a \"bat kohen\" can perform in an Orthodox context is a subject of current discussion and debate in some Orthodox circles.\n\nSome women's prayer groups that practice under the halakhic guidance of non-Orthodox rabbis, and which conduct Torah readings for women only, have adapted a custom of calling a \"bat kohen\" for the first \"aliyah\" and a \"bat levi\" for the second.\n\nConservative Judaism, consistent with its view that sacrifices in the Temple will not be restored and in light of many congregations' commitment to gender (but not caste) egalitarianism, interprets the Talmudic relevant passages to permit elimination of most distinctions between male and female \"kohanim\" in congregations that retain traditional tribal roles while modifying traditional gender roles. The Conservative movement bases this leniency on the view that the privileges of the \"kohen\" come not from offering Temple offerings but solely from lineal sanctity, and that ceremonies like the Priestly Blessing should evolve from their Temple-based origins. (The argument for women's involvement in the Priestly Blessing acknowledges that only male \"kohanim\" could perform this ritual in the days of the Temple, but that the ceremony is no longer rooted in Temple practice; its association with the Temple was by rabbinic decree; and rabbis therefore have the authority to permit the practice to evolve from its Temple-based roots). As a result, some Conservative synagogues permit a \"bat kohen\" to perform the Priestly Blessing and the Pidyon HaBen ceremony, and to receive the first \"aliyah\" during the Torah reading.\n\nThe Conservative halakha committee in Israel has ruled that women do not receive such \"aliyot\" and cannot validly perform such functions (rabbi Robert Harris, 5748). Therefore, not all Conservative congregations or rabbis permit these roles for \"bnot kohanim\" (daughters of priests). Moreover, many egalitarian-oriented Conservative synagogues have abolished traditional tribal roles and do not perform ceremonies involving \"kohanim\" (such as the Priestly Blessing or calling a \"kohen\" to the first \"aliyah\"), and many traditionalist Conservative synagogues have retained traditional gender roles and do not permit women to perform these roles at all.\n\nBecause most Reform and Reconstructionist temples have abolished traditional tribal distinctions, roles, and identities on grounds of egalitarianism, a special status for a \"bat kohen\" has very little significance in these movements.\n\nSince the Y chromosome is inherited only from one's father (women have no Y chromosome), all direct male lineages share a common haplotype. Therefore, testing was done across sectors of the Jewish and non-Jewish population to see if there was any commonality among their Y chromosomes. The initial research by Hammer, Skorecki, et al. was based on a limited study of 188 subjects, which identified a narrow set of genetic markers found in slightly more than 50% of Jews with a tradition of priestly descent and approximately 5% of Jews who did not believe themselves to be kohanim.\n\nOver the succeeding decade, Hammer, Skorecki, and other researchers continued to collect genetic material from Jewish and non-Jewish populations around the world. The most recent results suggest that 46% of those who have a family tradition of Priestly descent belong to the Y-DNA haplogroup identified as J-P58, and that at least two-thirds of that 46% have very similar Y-DNA sequences indicating comparatively recent common ancestry. A further 14% of kohanim were found to belong to another lineage, in haplogroup J2a-M410. In contrast, the so-called Cohen Modal Haplotype (CMH), a characteristic Y chromosome haplotype earlier identified in a majority of men self-reporting as kohanim, is found in as much as 5% to 8% of Jews who have no family tradition of being kohanim, and only 1.5% were found to have the closest match to the most detailed sequence. Amongst non-Jews, the CMH can be found among non-Jewish Yemenites (>67.7%) and Jordanians (~7%), but none were found to most closely match the most detailed sequence. Thus, studies document certain distinctions among the Y chromosomes of kohanim, implying that a substantial proportion of kohanim share some common male ancestry.\n\nSince the religious status of a kohen is contingent upon being the male biological descendant of Aaron in conjunction with numerous other variables that are not subject to genetic testing (the wife of a kohen cannot have had relations with a non-Jew, be a divorcee etc.) the possession of a common haplotype does not provide sufficient evidence to confer or maintain the religious status of a kohen, which depends on more than simple heredity. This loss of priestly status over time may account for the 1.5% of non-kohen Jews who very closely match the Y chromosome sequence that is most common amongst kohanim.\n\nThe status of kohen in Judaism has no necessary relationship to a person's surname. Though it is true that descendants of kohanim often bear surnames that reflect their genealogy, there are many families with the surname Cohen (or any number of variations) who are not kohanim nor even Jewish. Conversely, there are many kohanim who do not have Cohen as a surname.\n\nThere are numerous variations to the spelling of the surname Cohen. These are often corrupted by translation or transliteration into or from other languages, as exemplified below (not a complete list).\n\n\nIn contemporary Israel, \"Moshe Cohen\" is the equivalent of \"John Smith\" in English-speaking countries – i.e., proverbially the most common of names.\n\nOne common interpretation of the practice of having three pieces of matzah on a Seder plate is that they represent \"Kohen, Levi and Yisrael\" (i.e., the priests, the tribe of Levi, and all other Jewish people).\n\nAccording to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, either \"literal descendants of Aaron\", or worthy Melchizedek priesthood holders have the legal right to constitute the Presiding Bishopric under the authority of the First Presidency (). To date, all men who have served on the Presiding Bishopric have been Melchizedek priesthood holders, and none have been publicly identified as descendants of Aaron. See also Mormonism and Judaism.\n\nThe positioning of the kohen's hands during the Priestly Blessing was Leonard Nimoy's inspiration for Mr. Spock's Vulcan salute in the . Nimoy, raised an Orthodox Jew (but not a kohen), used the salute when saying \"Live long and prosper\".\n\nThe Priestly Blessing was used by Leonard Cohen in his farewell blessing during \"Whither Thou Goest\", the closing song on his concerts. Leonard Cohen himself was from a kohen family. He also used the drawing of the Priestly Blessing as one of his logos.\n\nIn 1938, with the outbreak of violence that would come to be known as Kristallnacht, American Orthodox rabbi Mnachem HaKohen Risikoff wrote about the central role he saw for Priests and Levites in terms of Jewish and world responses, in worship, liturgy, and \"teshuva\", repentance. In הכהנים והלוים HaKohanim vHaLeviim (1940) \"The Priests and the Levites\", he stressed that members of these groups exist in the realm between history (below) and redemption (above), and must act in a unique way to help move others to prayer and action, and help bring an end to suffering. He wrote, \"Today, we also are living through a time of flood, Not of water, but of blood, which burns and turns Jewish life into ruin. We are now drowning in a flood of blood...Through the Kohanim and Levi'im help will come to all Israel.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The purpose of the Institute has been to provide an ecumenical training in Tibetan Buddhism and to meet the need for renewal of meditation and scholarship all over Tibet in the wake of China’s Cultural Revolution of 1966-76.\n\nDespite its remote location, it grew from a handful of disciples gathering in Jigme Phuntsok's home to be one of the largest and most influential centers for the study of Tibetan Buddhism in the world, numbering to nearly 10,000 monks, nuns, and lay disciples by the year 2000. As of 2015, the number of residents has grown to about 40,000.\n\nOverall, the student body of Larung Five Sciences Buddhist Academy is made up of monks, nuns, lay \"vow-holders\" of both Tibetan and Chinese origins, and tantric practitioners. They study under four major religious divisions in the Academy: Ngarig Nangten Lobling, International Religious Committee, Pema Khandro Duling Nunnery, and Lektso Charbeb Ling. Ngarig Nangten Lobling consists of 2,500 Tibetan monks. Lektso Charbeb Ling is the section that trained over 1,000 lay Tibetan \"vow-holders\" and tantric practitioners from Sêrtar and other regions of Tibet.\n\nPema Khandro Duling Nunnery is the home for study to approximately 3,500-4,000 nuns from all regions of Tibet. More than half of those who came to Sertar are women and the curriculum allows nuns to achieve a coveted Khenpo degree for the first time in Tibetan history. Entry into the relatively small number of nunneries that exist in other areas of Tibet is limited, but Sertar is open to virtually anyone who genuinely seeks to become a student of Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok’s ecumenical vision. Khenpo’s niece, Jetsunma Mumso, is recognized as a tulku and heads the order of nuns. The term is descriptive of certain teachers in Tibet who are thought to reincarnate over a number of generations.\n\nRoughly ten percent of the nearly 10,000 students attending Sertar are ethnic Han people. They attend separate classes taught in Standard Chinese while larger classes are taught in Amdo Tibetan. The International Religious Committee oversees 1,000 disciples from regions of the People’s Republic of China and students from other Asian countries.\n\nThe Sertar Institute operated with a standing executive committee of seven learned lamas, but major decisions were confirmed and implemented only after consultation with Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok.\n\nThe Sertar Institute has been home to over 500 khenpos — holders of Doctoral degrees in divinity — and is widely renowned for the high quality of both its religious and secular education. English, Chinese, and Tibetan languages and modern computer studies have been taught alongside a traditional non-sectarian Buddhist curriculum.\n\nIn August 2017, it emerged that a deputy police chief of Garze would be acting as the institute’s party secretary and director with a committee of cadres.\n\nLarung Gar is outside the main tourist routes and few foreigners find their way there. Occasionally officials have prevented foreigners from visiting the institute, but in recent years it has been mostly accessible. There is one hotel on the Northern ridgeline, which is most easily reached via the new construction access road from the north, avoiding the congestion on the narrow streets of the institute. There are also a simple guesthouse and a few restaurants on the main square next to the main Gompa. A new \"Temple of Death\" has been built at the sky burial site about one kilometer north of the institute.\n\nIn February 2016, a photograph of Larung Gar by Hungarian photographer Attila Balogh was shortlisted for that year’s Sony World Photography Awards.\n\nThe Chinese demolished about 2,000 homes in 2001, \"because of concerns about social stability\" at the site, simultaneously limiting the population to 1,400 residents. More than 1,000 new homes are constructed every year by both professional crews and monks and nuns themselves with the help of their families and friends. However, in January 2014, a massive blaze destroyed around 100 wood houses in Larung Gar.\n\nOn 22 July 2016, the BBC reported evidence from the campaign group Free Tibet that a government work team, accompanied by Chinese police and plainclothes members of the armed forces, had begun to demolish more buildings at Larung Gar in response to an order made the previous month by local authorities. According to some reports, authorities ordered to cut the number of Larung Gar residents by half to 5,000 and offered rewards to ethnic Tibetan dwellers if they moved away. On 6 December 2016, Tibetan government-in-exile urged the United Nations to intervene on the issue. On 15 December 2016, European Parliament passed a resolution against the People's Republic of China and condemned the partial dismantling of Larung Gar.\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" noted that the demolition was being carried out after \"two major government meetings during which President Xi Jinping stressed “national unity” and the necessity for religious groups to support the Communist Party and “merge their religious doctrines with Chinese culture.”\" L[Robert] Barnett [a Tibet scholar at Columbia University] said this was indicative of the social unrest in Tibet, quoted in the LA Times as saying \"We’ve had — what is it? — five years of self-immolations, massive protests in 2008 and so on. The language of resistance is rife throughout China and Tibet.\"\n\nIn March 2017 it was revealed that the dismantling is part of a rebuilding project that the local government is carrying out in order to make the academy fire- and earthquake-safe.\n\n"}

She returned to Britain in 1999 and was ordained at Leo Baeck College, serving as rabbi at Alyth Synagogue (North Western Reform Synagogue) until 2011, when she became inaugural holder of her current position.\n\nIn her position, Janner-Klausner represents a progressive Jewish voice to British Jewry and the wider public, speaking on affairs including Israel-Palestine, social justice, same-sex marriage and interfaith relations. Janner-Klausner is a regular broadcaster on programmes such as BBC Radio 4’s \"Thought for the Day\", BBC Radio 2’s \"Pause for Thought\" and BBC One’s \"The Big Questions\" and \"Sunday Morning Live\". In November 2014, \"The Huffington Post\" reported that Janner-Klausner was \"fast becoming the most high-profile Jewish leader in the country\" and described her as \"wildly likeable, emphatic, intense, and outspoken\". In 2018 she featured in The Progress 1000 list of London's most influential people. She is currently writing a book on the theme of resilience.\n\nJanner-Klausner was raised in north London and attended South Hampstead High School. As a young girl, Janner-Klausner regularly travelled to constituency surgeries at the weekends with her father, Greville Janner, a QC and then a Labour Member of Parliament. Janner-Klausner’s great-uncle, Emeritus Chief Rabbi of Great Britain, Sir Israel Brodie, had a profound influence on her growing up. Her siblings are Marion Janner OBE, a mental health campaigner, and Daniel Janner QC, a barrister.\n\nInitially a member of Hampstead Garden Suburb Synagogue, a congregation affiliated to the United Synagogue of Orthodox British Jews, Janner-Klausner has frequently cited her bat mitzvah as a pivotal moment. Janner-Klausner was so disaffected by the experience she left Hampstead Garden Suburb Synagogue the very next day. Janner-Klausner subsequently became involved in youth activities at Alyth Gardens Reform Synagogue near Golders Green, developing a passion for Reform Judaism’s values of egalitarianism and social justice and expressing interest in becoming a Rabbi as young as 13.\n\nJanner-Klausner spent her gap year in Israel and was a representative of British Reform Judaism at Machon L'Madrichei Chutz La'Aretz (The Institute for Youth Leaders from Abroad). She returned to London in 1982 and became a founding member of RSY-Netzer, which is now the largest Jewish youth movement in the United Kingdom.\n\nJanner-Klausner studied divinity at the University of Cambridge, where she was taught by Rowan Williams, later Archbishop of Canterbury. She studied with Professor Linda Woodhead, now Professor in the sociology of religion at Lancaster University. Janner-Klausner was on the Union of Jewish Students executive and ran her university's Israel Society and Progressive Jewish Society.\n\nFollowing her graduation in 1985, aged 22, Janner-Klausner moved to Israel and began teaching Jewish history, Judaism and youth leadership at the Machon L'Madrichei Chutz La'Aretz. She worked there continuously until 1998 and later became the Director of its English-speaking department.\n\nJanner-Klausner began working in 1992 at Melitz, an educational centre specialising in Jewish peoplehood based in Jerusalem, and later served as Director of the Centre for Christian Encounters with Israel, where she helped train Palestinian tour guides in Bethlehem and Jerusalem. Janner-Klausner also led Israeli-Palestinian dialogue facilitation for the European Union’s \"The People's Peace\" programme, following the Oslo I Accord of 1993.\n\nBefore returning to live in London, Janner-Klausner had studied at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Jerusalem and acquired postgraduate degrees in Community Centre Management at the Hebrew University and Jewish Communal Service with a focus on Jewish education at Brandeis University, Massachusetts.\n\nJanner-Klausner returned to London in 1999 with her husband David and their three children, citing the ideological intensity of living in Jerusalem as a primary reason. She soon began training to become a rabbi at Leo Baeck College, serving many congregations as a trainee rabbi – including Alyth Synagogue (North Western Reform Synagogue), the synagogue where she had developed a passion for Reform Judaism and its egalitarian values as a teenager. Following her ordination, Janner-Klausner became Rabbi at Alyth.\n\nJanner-Klausner featured in a BBC radio series presented by Jonathan Freedland in 2008 entitled \"British Jews and the Dream of Zion\", discussing the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. She then began to broadcast regularly on programmes such as BBC Radio 4’s \"Today\" programme (in the \"Thought for the Day\" slot) and BBC One’s \"The Big Questions\".\n\nWhilst Rabbi at Alyth, Janner-Klausner began chairing British Friends of Rabbis for Human Rights, an Israeli human rights organisation. By 2011, she had served for eight years as Rabbi at Alyth, a community with 3000 members.\n\nIn July 2011, Janner-Klausner became first Senior Rabbi to Reform Judaism, a position initially entitled \"Movement Rabbi\". Chair-elect of Reform Judaism, Jenny Pizer, said Janner-Klausner was \"an influential broadcaster and writer, a great teacher and a popular rabbi of one of our flourishing communities\".\n\nThe Assembly of Reform Rabbis created the position to increase the voice of Reform Judaism and represent its constituent communities on a national level, both within the British Jewish community and general public.\n\nShortly after being appointed, Janner-Klausner set improving periodically fraught relations between the Orthodox and Reform Judaism as part of her agenda. On the selection of Ephraim Mirvis as Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations in December 2012, Janner-Klausner said: \"I welcome the appointment of Rabbi Mirvis as another powerful voice for British Jewry. I look forward to working closely with him as a partner on areas of common interests to the Jewish and wider community\". Janner-Klausner has since said of Rabbi Mirvis: \"he made some very positive noises about inclusivity and working together and it was really well received. It’s not playing out in reality, unfortunately.\"\n\nIn November 2014, Janner-Klausner featured in \"Beyond Belief\" by \"The Huffington Post\", a series of interviews with Britons who use faith \"to create a force for positive change\". The article, entitled \"How Britain's Only Female Head Of Faith Took On The Religious Establishment, And Won\", explored Janner-Klausner's early life and professional career. It reported that Janner-Klausner had dramatically improved the status of Reform Judaism in Britain and was \"fast becoming the most high-profile Jewish leader in the country\".\n\nJanner-Klausner is a prominent voice on British interfaith relations and regularly meets representatives of Christian and Muslim communities. She is a President of the Council of Christians and Jews and has worked with organisations including the Three Faiths Forum and the Interfaith Network for the UK. Having studied Christian theology at university, Janner-Klausner has worked with the Methodist Church, the Church of Scotland and the Quakers to deepen interfaith ties.\n\nIn May 2013, following the murder of Lee Rigby, Janner-Klausner joined faith leaders in solidarity with Woolwich residents and its Muslim community at the Greenwich Islamic Centre. With far-right groups including the English Defence League and British National Party organising protests in response to the murder by a Muslim extremist, she stated that \"a single extreme act... does not reflect on the wider British Muslim community\".\n\nJanner-Klausner strongly supports same-sex marriage, which she calls \"equal marriage\". Referring to the legalisation of gay marriage, Janner-Klausner said \"our starting point, middle point and finishing point is about equality\". In March 2014, same-sex marriage was legalised in Britain. Janner-Klausner signed an open letter from Christian and Jewish faith leaders including Danny Rich, chief executive of Liberal Judaism, and Alan Wilson, the Bishop of Buckingham, voicing support for gay marriage. The leaders said they would \"rejoice\" in the introduction of gay marriage.\n\nJanner-Klausner has emerged as one of the leading British religious voices on the issue of refugee rights. She was involved in bringing the issue to public prominence, writing in August 2015 that \"when Jewish people look at Calais migrants, we see ourselves\" and being one of the leading voices in a letter signed by over 200 Jewish representatives labelling the government's response \"appalling\". Janner-Klausner was especially vocal on the topic of the Calais Jungle, visiting on multiple occasions. In September 2015, a short film was made documenting Janner-Klausner visiting the Jungle alongside Imam Qari Muhammad Asim. When the Jungle was threatened with demolition in early 2016, she was a key signatory on a Citizens UK letter signed by over 90,000 people to halt demolition until vulnerable children had been granted safe arrangements. In July 2016, she led further efforts to prevent the demolition, including a letter to the government signed by Christian and Jewish faith leaders. After the demolition of the camp, Janner-Klausner continued to speak out, stating that \"it is beyond comprehension that people can be mistreated like this\".\n\nDuring debate over the Dubs Amendment to the Immigration Bill to grant 3,000 unaccompanied child refugees entry to the UK, Janner-Klausner spoke extensively in its favour. She was at the forefront of a letter signed by many Rabbinic leaders calling for the Dubs Amendment to be adopted and spoke out alongside Jewish leaders from a range of denominations after the amendment was initially rejected, saying \"I believe Britain has the capacity and the will to do more during this crisis\". After the success of the amendment, Janner-Klausner continued to pressure the government to accept the children identified in Calais who she said had \"a clear legal right to be here\", speaking at a vigil outside the Home Office.\n\nJanner-Klausner has continued to call on the British government to change its treatment of refugees. She has spoken at the Houses of Parliament to call for an end to the indefinite detention of asylum seekers, alongside other prominent religious leaders. In September 2016, she addressed a crowd of 10,000 people at a Solidarity with Refugees rally in Trafalgar Square.\n\nInternationally, Rabbi Janner-Klausner has spoken out against the treatment of refugees crossing the US-Mexico border by the Trump administration, saying \"the numbing of empathy, the dehumanisation of other people through the encouragement of disdain are documented stages in history that have led to atrocities and even genocides\".\n\nJanner-Klausner is a progressive Zionist and considers Israel the spiritual and intellectual centre of Judaism and the Jewish people. She supports two states for Israel and Palestine as the sustainable and just solution to the present conflict, having facilitated Israeli-Palestinian dialogue for the European Union whilst living in Jerusalem and led tours to the West Bank with British Friends of Rabbis for Human Rights. She is a past chair of British Friends of Rabbis for Human Rights.\n\nJanner-Klausner is especially interested in the relationship between religion and power. She has criticised religious fundamentalists, proposing that literalist interpretations of religious text \"worship words instead of God\". At the Bath Literature Festival in March 2013, she spoke about the importance of challenging religious belief and suggested \"we need to lock faith and doubt together\".\n\nAt the Limmud Conference in December 2013, Janner-Klausner delivered a JDOV speech about \"Power and its Discontents\", addressing themes of power and powerlessness in Judaism. Before the speech at JDOV or \"Jewish Dreams, Observations and Visions\", a British Jewish organisation inspired by TED talks, she wrote: \"I strongly believe in inverting the power pyramid so that everyone claims their opportunity to play their part in decisions that affect themselves and their communities\".\n\nJanner-Klausner believes enabling colleagues to receive opportunities in the public sphere is as an important responsibility and does not believe the Senior Rabbi role makes her a chief rabbi or holder of special religious authority. In April 2013, Rabbi Mark Goldsmith, Chairman of the Assembly of Reform Rabbis, remarked that Janner-Klausner was \"not our only public face to the world. Part of her role is to enable all of us to be more outward-facing rabbis\".\n\nJanner-Klausner is currently writing a book on resilience.\n\nJanner-Klausner was introduced by an aunt to her husband, David, in Jerusalem in 1986. They married in 1988 and have three children: Tali, Natan and Ella. Dr David Janner-Klausner was Programme and Planning Director at the United Jewish Israel Appeal and currently works as Director of Business Development at Commonplace Digital Ltd. He is the brother of Amos Oz, the Israeli author.\n\nJanner-Klausner speaks fluent Hebrew.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17484020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17484020", "title": "Madhurāṣṭakam", "text": "Madhurāṣṭakam\n\nThe Madhurāṣṭakam () is a Sanskrit composition in devotion of Krishna, composed by the Hindu Bhakti philosopher-poet Sripad Vallabha Acharya. Sripad Vallabhacharya flourished under the patronage of the Vijayanagara King Sri Krishnadevarya in the late fifteenth century Andhra State and created many other literary pieces including the Vyasa Sutra Bhashya, Jaimini Sutra Bhasya, Bhagavata Tika Subodhini, Pushti Pravala Maryada and Siddhanta Rahasya in Sanskrit.\n\nThe devotional hymn \"Madhurāṣṭakam\" of Sri Vallabhacarya was created to lead the devotee in Pustimarga, the Path of Grace, which involves a constant love-filled devotion to Krishna by various acts of homage, such as singing (kirtana), remembering (smarana), conceptualising and beholding (darshana) a beatific image of the deity upon singing of the Madhurāṣṭakam, and offering of services (seva). These acts enable the devotee to enter into the divine presence of Sri Krishna and to experience the Lord's real essence (svarupa) which are in fact, succinctly laid down by the Madhurāṣṭakam. Hence, Madhurāṣṭakam plays an instrumental role in the realisation of the Lord.\n\nThe term \"aṣṭakam\" is derived from the Sanskrit word , meaning \"eight\". An \"aṣṭakam\" is made up of eight stanzas.\n\n\"Aṣṭakam\" belong to the genre of lyric poetry, which tends to be short, extremely melodic, and contemplative. It reflects and portrays the poet's own feelings, states of mind, and perceptions about the theme or character in the \"aṣṭakam\".\n\nThe thought behind the composition in 'Bhakti mixed with Love', being a typical frame of devotion and dedication in the Bhakti movement. In the loved bhakti frame, the devotee falls in love with the almighty and to the devotee, all the attributes and actions of the Lord God appears sweet, as those appear to a lover.\n\nThe Madhurāṣṭakam deals with the qualities and deeds of Lord Krishna, all of which have been conceptualized as been dipped in madhu, meaning honey or nectar. In the eyes of the devotee, everything that pertains to Lord is sweet and graceful, he being the adhipati (Lord and Godhead) of all sweetness.\n\nThe body of the Madhurāṣṭakam includes many qualities, attributes and motifs associated with Krishna, including the venu flute, cows, the Yamuna river, gopis, and Krishna's lila. These symbols and motifs related to the life and deeds of Lord Sri Krishna have been labelled as 'sweet' in the astakam.\n\nSee Sanskrit for details of pronunciation.\n\nMadhurāṣṭakam has been a very popular devotional song. Renowned singers, including the classical legend M. S. Subbulakshmi and semi-classical singer K. J. Yesudas have given classical and semi-classical renditions of the song. In the Odissi dance tradition, the Madhurāṣṭakam comprises an elegant and intoxicating theme for dance drama.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2424838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2424838", "title": "Nat (spirit)", "text": "Nat (spirit)\n\nThe nats (; MLCTS: \"nat\"; ) are spirits worshipped in Myanmar in conjunction with Buddhism. They are divided between the 37 Great Nats and all the rest (i.e., spirits of trees, water, etc.). Almost all of the 37 Great Nats were human beings who met violent deaths (, lit. \"green death\"). They may thus also be called \"nat sein\" (; lit. green spirits). The word 'sein', while meaning 'green', is being used to mean 'raw' in this context. There are however two types of nats in Burmese Buddhist belief.\n\nNat spirits are termed lower nats or \"auk nat\"s (), whether named or unnamed, whereas \"ahtet nat\"s () or higher nat dewas inhabit the six heavens. Much like sainthood, nats can be designated for a variety of reasons, including those only known in certain regions in Burma. Nat worship is less common in urban areas than in rural areas, and is practised among ethnic minorities of Myanmar as well as in the mainstream Bamar society. It is however among the Theravada Buddhist Bamar that the most highly developed form of ceremony and ritual is seen.\n\nEvery Burmese village has a \"nat sin\" () which essentially serves as a shrine to the village guardian nat called the \"ywa saung nat\" (). An offertory coconut () is often hung on the main southeast post () in the house, wearing a \"gaung baung\" (headdress) and surrounded by perfume, as an offering to the Min Mahagiri (Lord of the Great Mountain), also known as the \"ein dwin\" () or \"ein saung\" () (house guardian) nat. One may inherit a certain member or in some instances two of the 37 Nats as \"mi hsaing hpa hsaing\" (; lit. mother's side, father's side) from one or both parents' side to worship depending on where their families originally come from. One also has a personal guardian spirit called \"ko saung nat\" ().\n\nAcademic opinions vary as to whether Burmese Buddhism and Burmese spirit worship are two separate entities, or merged into a single religion. Some Burmese might say spirit worship is superstition and downplay its role in society. The formalizing of the official 37 Nats by King Anawrahta (1044–1077) of Bagan, has been interpreted as Burmanisation and establishment of Bamar supremacy in the Irrawaddy valley after the unification of the country and founding of the First Burmese Empire.\nWorship of nats predates Buddhism in Burma. With the arrival of Buddhism, however, the nats were merged, syncretistically, with Buddhism.\n\nThe widespread traditional belief among rural folks that there are forest guardian spirits called \"taw saung nat\"s () and mountain guardian spirits called \"taung saung nat\"s () appears to act as a deterrent against environmental destruction up to a point. Indiscriminate felling particularly of large trees is generally eschewed owing to the belief that they are dwellings of tree spirits called \"yokkazo\" () and that such an act would bring the wrath of the nat upon the perpetrator.\n\nThe most important nat pilgrimage site in Burma is Mount Popa, an extinct volcano with numerous temples and relic sites atop a mountain 1300 metres tall located near Bagan in central Burma. The annual festival is held on the full moon of the month of \"Natdaw\" (December) of the Burmese calendar. Taungbyone, north of Mandalay in Madaya Township, is another major site with the festival held each year starting on the eleventh waxing day and including the full moon in the month \"Wagaung\" (August). Yadanagu at Amarapura, held a week later in honour of Popa Medaw (\"Mother of Popa\"), who was the mother of the Taungbyone Min Nyinaung (\"Brother Lords\"), is also a popular nat festival.\n\nNats have human characteristics, wants, and needs. They are flawed, having desires considered derogatory and immoral in mainstream Buddhism. During a \"nat pwè\", which is a festival during which nats are propitiated, \"nat kadaw\"s ( \"lord-consort\", i.e. \"medium, shaman\") dance and embody the nat's spirit in a trance. Historically, the \"nat kadaw\" profession was hereditary and passed from mother to daughter. Until the 1980s, few \"nat gadaw\"s were male. Since the 1980s, persons identified by outsiders as trans women or gay male transvestites have increasingly performed these roles.\n\nMusic, often accompanied by a hsaing waing (\"orchestra\"), adds much to the mood of the \"nat pwè\", and many are entranced. People come from far to take part in the festivities in various nat shrines called \"nat kun\" or \"nat naan\", get drunk on palm wine and dance wildly in fits of ecstasy to the wild beat of the Hsaing waing music, possessed by the nats.\n\nWhereas \"nat pwè\"s are annual events celebrating a particular member of the 37 Nats regarded as the tutelary spirit in a local region within a local community, with familial custodians of the place and tradition and with royal sponsorship in ancient times, hence evocative of royal rituals, there are also \"nat kannah pwè\"s where individuals would have a pavilion set up in a neighbourhood and the ritual is generally linked to the entire pantheon of nats. The \"nat kadaw\"s as an independent profession made their appearance in the latter half of the 19th century as spirit mediums, and \"nat kannah\"s are more of an urban phenomenon which evolved to satisfy the need of people who had migrated from the countryside to towns and cities but who wished to carry on their traditions or \"yo-ya\" of supplicating the \"mi hsaing hpa hsaing\" tutelary spirit of their native place.\n\nKing Anawrahta of Bagan (1044–1077) designated an official pantheon of 37 nats after he had failed to enforce a ban on nat worship. His stratagem of incorporation eventually succeeded by bringing nats to Shwezigon Pagoda portrayed worshipping Gautama Buddha and by enlisting Śakra , a Buddhist protective deity, to head the pantheon above the Mahagiri nats as Thagyamin. Seven out of the 37 Nats appear to be directly associated with the life and times of Anawrahta.\n\nThe official pantheon is made up predominantly of those from the royal houses of Burmese history, but also contains nats of Thai (Yun Bayin) and Shan (Maung Po Tu) descent; illustrations of them show them in Burmese royal dress. Listed in proper order, they are:\n\n\n\n"}

According to tradition, the first Marian apparition is said to have occurred to a young boy delivering butter-milk to a man who lived far away. During his travels, the boy stopped to rest beside a lake that was shaded by a Banyan tree. A beautiful woman, carrying a child, is said to have appeared, and asked the boy for some milk to feed her child, which he gave. When he reached the home for his milk delivery, he apologised for the delay and that there would be less milk in his pot. But when they opened the lid of the milk pot, the container was brimming with milk. \n\nThe second apparition occurred a few years later. A lame boy would sell buttermilk to passing travellers, who would pause in the shade of a large Bayan tree, to escape the heat of the day. However, he had no customers. Suddenly, an ethereal woman, holding a child appeared before him, and asked for a cup of buttermilk. He gave her a cup, which she fed to her child. The woman asked the boy to go to Nagapattinam, and find a certain Catholic man in the town, and tell him to build a chapel at Vailankanni in her honour. Apparently cured, the boy ran to Nagapattinam, where he found the man and told him his story.\n\nThese apparitions have not been approved by the Holy See.\n\nThe Basilica of Our Lady of Good Health erected by the Portuguese and the Indians stands at the site where the buttermilk seller saw Mary and Jesus. The iconic depiction of the Madonna is unique in that it is one of two only icons where Mary is portrayed wearing an Indian Sari, while the other statue is said to have been buried with Aurangzeb, the Mughal Emperor . The basilica is known as a site for pilgrims from all over India and its assembly of multilingual prayers every Christmas.\n\nThough there is no historical document or record about the reputed apparitions of Mary at Vailankanni, only oral tradition ascertain the two apparitions in the 16th century and the saving of the Portuguese sailors from a tempest in the Bay of Bengal in the 17th century.\n\nA Gothic-styled basilica stands in Velankanni in memory of the apparitions\n\nSeptember 8, the Feast of the Nativity of Mary, is also commemorated as the feast of Our Lady of Good Health. The celebration starts on 29 August and ends on the day of the feast. The feast day prayers are said in Marathi, East Indian, Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu, Kannada, Konkani, Hindi and English.\n\n\nA Tamil language movie was made in honor of Our Lady of Good Health with the title \"Annai Velankanni\" in 1971. The movie was directed by K. Thankappan, starring major stars of Tamil cinema including Gemini Ganesan, Kamal Haasan, K. R. Vijaya, Jayalalitha and Padmini.\n\n\n"}

Below the image a ribbon carries the inscription: \"Queen of Poland, give us days of peace.\" The image measures 9.5 × 15.5 cm and is on larger panel of 16 × 25 cm. There is a second crown above the image, on the larger panel.\n\nThe icon was painted in 1772 as a replica of the icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary enshrined in Rokitno, Międzyrzecz County in Western Poland. According to legend, a Polish soldier (called Thomas Kłossowski) was wounded in the Battle of Leipzig in 1813 and had a vision of the Virgin Mary who saved him from death and instructed him to look for the image upon his return to Poland. Kłossowski is then said to have looked for and found the image in the woods in Grąblin as instructed.\n\nAccording to oral tradition, in 1850 Kłossowski and shepherd Nicholas Sikatka witnessed several apparitions of the Virgin Mary who called for repentance and prayer. In the apparitions, the Virgin reportedly predicted war and a cholera epidemic, but also gave hope. During the cholera plague of 1852, the image became famous for performing miracles.\n\nOn 29 September 1852 the image was moved to the parish church in Licheń and remained there until 2006. Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski, the Primate of the Millennium gave its Canonical Coronation towards the image with the approval of Pope Paul VI on 15 August 1967.\n\nIn 1994 the construction of the new basilica of Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lichen was started to house the image and accommodate the large number of pilgrims. Pope John Paul II blessed the basilica in 1999. The basilica is Poland's largest church, the seventh largest in Europe and eleventh in the world. The basilica's organ manufactured by the Zych company (157 stops, 6 manuals and pedalboard) is the largest instrument in Poland, the fourth largest in Europe and thirteenth largest in the world. On July 2, 2006 the image was placed in the main altar of the basilica.\n\n"}

He was the son of Pharnaces II of Phrygia and grandson of Pharnabazus I, and great-grandson of Artabazus I. He and his male ancestors had governed the satrapy of Hellespontine Phrygia from its headquarters at Dascylium since 478 BC. He married Apama, daughter of Artaxerxes II of Persia, and their son Artabazus was likewise a satrap of Phrygia.\n\nAccording to research by Theodor Nöldeke, he was descended from Otanes, one of the associates of Darius in the murder of Smerdis.\n\nPharnabazus II is first recorded as satrap of this province in 413 BC, when, having received orders from Darius II of Persia to send in the outstanding tribute of the Greek cities on the Ionian coast, he, like Tissaphernes of Caria, entered into negotiations with Sparta and began a war with Athens. The conduct of the war was much hindered by the rivalry between the two satraps, of whom Pharnabazus was by far the more energetic and upright. Although Pharnabazus initially fought with the Spartans against the Athenians during the Peloponnesian war, even, in one instance, coming to the rescue of the retreating Spartan forces, riding his horse into the sea to fend off the Athenians while encouraging his regiment. However, he eventually came into conflict with the Spartan king, Agesilaus and went on to aid the Athenians against the Spartans in the Corinthian War (395–387 BC). During this period, Pharnabazus is notable for his command of the Achaemenid fleet at the Battle of Cnidus in which the Persians, allied with the former Athenian admiral and then commissioned into Persian service, Conon, annihilated the Spartan fleet, ending their brief status as the dominant Greek naval power. Pharnabazus followed up this victory by capturing several Spartan-allied cities in Ionia. Abydus and Sestus were the only cities to refuse to expel the Lacedaemonians despite threats from Pharnabazus to make war on them. He attempted to force these into submission by ravaging the surrounding territory, but this proved fruitless, leading him to leave Conon in charge of winning over the cities in the Hellespont. From there, Pharnabazus sailed with his fleet to the Aegean island of Melos and established a base there. He proceeded to take revenge on the Spartans by invading Lacedaemonian territory, where he laid waste to Pherae and raided along the coast. Eventually he left due to scarce resources and few harbors for his fleet in the area, as well as the looming possibility of Lacedaemonian relief forces being dispatched. He then besieged and captured Cythera, proceeding to install an Athenian governor and a garrison to cripple Sparta's offensive military capabilities. He also gave Sparta's rivals funds to further threaten the Lacedaemonians. After being convinced by Conon that allowing him to rebuild the Long Walls around Piraeus, the main port of Athens, would be a major blow to the Lacedaemonians, Pharnabazus eagerly gave Conon a fleet and additional funds to accomplish this task. As a reward for his success, Pharnabazus was allowed to marry the king's daughter. He was then reassigned to help command a military expedition into Egypt, having proven his ability against the Spartans.\n"}

{"id": "26736386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26736386", "title": "Separation of Light from Darkness", "text": "Separation of Light from Darkness\n\nThe Separation of Light from Darkness is, from the perspective of the Genesis chronology, the first of nine central panels that run along the center of Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling and which depict scenes from the Book of Genesis. Michelangelo probably completed this panel in the summer of 1512, the last year of the Sistine ceiling project. It is one of five smaller scenes that alternate with four larger scenes that run along the center of the Sistine ceiling. The \"Separation of Light from Darkness\" is based on verses 3–5 from the first chapter of the Book of Genesis:\nAlthough in terms of the Genesis chronology it is the first of nine central panels along the Sistine ceiling, the \"Separation of Light from Darkness\" was the last of the nine panels painted by Michelangelo. Michelangelo painted the Sistine ceiling in two stages. Between May 1508 and the summer of 1511, he completed the \"entrance half\" of the Sistine chapel and ended this stage by painting the \"Creation of Eve\" and the scenes flanking this central panel. After an idle period of about 6 months, he painted the \"altar half,\" starting with the \"Creation of Adam\", between the winter of 1511 and October 1512.\n\nIn the \"Separation of Light from Darkness\", the image of God is framed by four \"ignudi\" and by two shields or medallions. The \"ignudi\" are young, nude males that Michelangelo painted as supporting figures at each corner of the five smaller narrative scenes along the center of the ceiling. There are a total of 20 \"ignudi\". These figures are all different and appear less constrained within their space than the Ancestors of Christ or the Bronze Nudes. In the earliest frescoes painted by Michelangelo toward the entrance of the Sistine chapel, the \"ignudi\" are paired, and their poses are similar but with minor variations. The variations in the poses increase with each set until the poses of the final set of four \"ignudi\" in the \"Separation of Light from Darkness\" bear no relation to each other.\n\nAlthough the meaning of these figures has never been completely clear, the Sistine scholar Heinrich Pfeiffer has proposed that the four \"ignudi\" associated with the \"Separation of Light from Darkness\" represent day and night, which echo the theme of light and darkness. For instance, he points out that the \"ignudo\" next to God's right hand (on the side of darkness) is stretching as if awakening from sleep in the morning, that the diagonally opposed \"ignudo\" below God's knee (on the side of light) is carrying a heavy bundle of oak garlands on his shoulders, representing a daytime activity, and that the \"ignudo\" next to God's left arm is falling asleep and signifies nighttime.\nPfeiffer and other scholars have also suggested that in Michelangelo's Sistine iconography the \"ignudi\" represent angels and that the Bronze Nudes below the \"ignudi\" are fallen angels.\n\nTwo shields or medallions accompany each set of four \"ignudi\" in the five smaller Genesis panels along the center of the Sistine ceiling. They are often described as painted to resemble bronze. Each is decorated with a picture from either the Old Testament or the Book of Maccabees from the Apocrypha. The subjects of the shields are often violent. In the \"Separation of Light from Darkness\" the shield above God shows Abraham sacrificing his son Isaac (Genesis 22:9–12), and the one below God shows the prophet Elijah as he is carried up to heaven in a chariot of fire (2 Kings 2:11).\n\nAt the center of the composition, God is shown in \"contrapposto\" rising into the sky, with arms outstretched separating the light from the darkness. Michelangelo employed in this fresco the challenging ceiling fresco technique of \"sotto in su\" (\"from below, upward\"), which makes a figure appear as if it is rising above the viewer by using foreshortening. The contrapposto pose was also used by Michelangelo in the \"David\". It is reported that Michelangelo painted this fresco in a single \"giornata\", that is, a single working day of approximately eight hours. During Michelangelo's lifetime, this fresco was considered evidence of the painter's technical prowess at its peak. For instance, Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574), Michelangelo's student and biographer, wrote in 1550:\n\n\"Furthermore, to demonstrate the perfection of his art and the greatness of God, Michelangelo depicted God dividing the light from darkness in these scenes, where He is seen in all His majesty as He sustains himself alone with open arms with the demonstration of love and creative energy.\n\nArt historians have noted several unusual features of this fresco. Andrew Graham-Dixon has pointed out that God has exaggerated pectoral muscles suggestive of female breasts, which he interprets as Michelangelo's attempt to illustrate \"male strength but also the fecundity of the female principle.\" In addition it has been noted that the anatomy of God's neck is too complex and does not resemble the normal contour of the neck. The lighting scheme of the image has been noted to be inconsistent; whereas the entire scene is illuminated from the bottom left, God's neck appears to have a different light source from the right.\n\nSeveral authors have proposed that Michelangelo concealed anatomical images in this fresco and that these anatomical images account for its unusual features. In an article published in the journal \"Neurosurgery\" in May 2010, Ian Suk, a medical illustrator, and Rafael Tamargo, a neurosurgeon, both from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, suggested that Michelangelo concealed three neuroanatomical images in the \"Separation of Light from Darkness.\" Suk and Tamargo explained that Michelangelo started to dissect cadavers at the age of 17–19 years and continued his anatomical studies throughout his life. As a result of his dissections, Michelangelo probably developed a detailed understanding of gross anatomy of the brain and spinal cord. They showed that the anatomical details in God's neck are unlike those of either other necks painted by Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel or of other necks painted by Michelangelo's contemporaries, such as Leonardo da Vinci and Raffaello Sanzio (Raphael). The unusual anatomy of God's neck is particularly evident when it is contrasted with the anatomy of the neck of the ignudo facing God in the upper left corner of the panel. The position of the neck of this ignudo is almost identical to that of God's neck, yet the ignudo's neck does not have any of the unusual lines found in God's neck. It is possible that Michelangelo placed these two analogous neck perspectives side by side to emphasize and contrast the hidden image in God's neck.\n\nSuk and Tamargo suggested that Michelangelo concealed a sophisticated image of the undersurface of the brainstem in God's neck and that by following Michelangelo's lines in God's neck, one can outline an anatomically correct image of the brainstem, cerebellum, temporal lobes, and optic chiasm. In addition, they suggested that Michelangelo also included an anterior view of the spinal cord in God's chest and an image of the optic nerves and globes in God's abdomen. They showed how a \"shadow analysis\" of the unusual lines in God's neck correspond to specific spaces around the brainstem known as the \"arachnoid cisterns,\" which were described in detail much later in 1875 but which Michelangelo inadvertently depicted in God's neck since he was able to render images with almost photographic accuracy. They concluded that \"being a painter of genius, a master anatomist, and a deeply religious man, Michelangelo cleverly enhanced his depiction of God in the iconographically critical panels on the Sistine Chapel vault with concealed images of the brain and in this way celebrated not only the glory of God, but also that of His most magnificent creation.\"\n\nOf note is that in an article published in the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\" in October 1990, Frank Meshberger, an obstetrician-gynecologist from Indiana, explained that Michelangelo similarly concealed an image of the brain in the shroud surrounding God in the \"Creation of Adam\". Since Michelangelo painted the \"Creation of Adam\" and the \"Separation of Light from Darkness\", along with two other Genesis panels, as a single thematic unit between the winter of 1511 and October 1512, it is possible that these four central panels have an underlying anatomical motif. Indeed, Garabed Eknoyan, a nephrologist from Baylor College of Medicine, proposed in an article published in \"Kidney International\" in March 2000 that Michelangelo concealed an image of a kidney in the \"Separation of Land and Water\", the third panel in the Genesis series. Michelangelo was particularly interested in kidney function because he suffered from kidney stones throughout his adult life and documented this interest in his letters and poems, according to Eknoyan.\n\nAlternatively, the concealed anatomical image in God's neck in the \"Separation of Light from Darkness\" has been interpreted as a goiter (an enlarged thyroid gland). In an article published in the \"Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine\" in December 2003, Lennart Bondeson and Anne-Greath Bondeson from Malmo University Hospital in Sweden, argued that the abnormality in God's neck is a goiter. This interpretation has been challenged on the basis that goiters typically occur lower in the neck and, as stated by Suk and Tamargo, that \"it is unlikely that Michelangelo, a deeply religious individual, would have defiled the image of God in this important panel by giving God a goiter.\"\n\nAlong these lines, Gilson Barreto and Marcelo G. de Oliveira, in a book published in 2004, analyzed the \"Separation of Light from Darkness\" and noted that God's upper chest and outstretched arms define a \"U\" shape, which they suggested is reminiscent of the hyoid bone, although they do not offer a thematic explanation for this structure in the fresco.\n"}

They are also known as the \"Moyal and Panchal\". They are Hindu in Gujarat and Sikh in Punjab, and both Hindu and Sikh in Haryana.\n\nThe Arabic word \"saiqal\" means a \"polisher\", and the Sikligar are those people who had the hereditary duty of polishing weapons. Many administrators of the British Raj, such as H. A. Rose, Denzil Ibbetson and William Crooke wrote books that referred to the blacksmith communities as \"Lohars\", although in fact that term refers to a specific group of people and is not interchangeable.\n\nThey are a nomadic community, often with encampments at the edge of towns and cities. The Sikligar claim to have been Rajputs who fled from Islamic invading armies and subsequently became weapon polishers to disguise themselves from their foes. Their ancestral home is said to be the city of Kannauj, but they speak Gujarati. The community is strictly endogamous and is divided into twelve clans with equal status. These are the Kanthiwala Bhand, Mole Bhand, Gandhiwala Bhand, Jumarwala, Jilpatia, Pathlerde, Juni, Mat and Bardika clans.\n\nAccording to their traditions, during the period of the Hindu deity Rama known as Haryana, there was a clan called the Chakreli. The Chakreli were the traditional manufacturers of swords and shields. The Chakreli lived in Chitor, in Rajasthan. Their ancestors fled their hometown in the face of invaders, and the ancestors of the Haryana Sikligar moved into the region in ancient times. Other traditions relate that the community is of Rajput origin. According to those stories, they were Rajput soldiers in the army of Prithvi Raj Chauhan, and became blacksmiths after his defeat at the hands of Mohammed Ghori.\n\nIn Punjab, the Sikligar claim to have immigrated from Rajasthan, where they manufactured swords. The community converted to Sikhism after they settled in Punjab, and are now found throughout the area, especially in the districts of Bhatinda, and Ludhiana. The Sikligar are now divided into a number of clans, the main ones being the Moyal, Tank, Junni, Dangi, Bhond, Bhori, Khichi, Tilvithya, Ghor-chare Tank, Kalyani and Churi te Biori.\n\nThe Hindu Sikligar of Gujarat continue their traditional occupation of sharpening knives, scissors, household articles and agricultural implements. Economically, they are extremely marginalised, with cases of child labor existing.\n\nThe Sikligar in Haryana are now divided into two groups, the Hindu Sikligar and Sikh Sikligar. The difference in religions mean that both groups are distinct communities, with no intermarriage. Both speak the Haryanvi dialect. They are found mainly in the districts of Hissar, Jind, Rohtak, Sirsa and Mohendargarh. Settled in hamlets on the outskirts of towns and villages, living often in thatched huts, they are further divided into 84 clans, known as gotras. The main ones being the Chauhan, Nirban, Taunk, Kalilot, Mohil, Joone, Dugoli Ke, Moyal, Padyar, Khankhara, Bhati, Dhare, Khichi, Ghelot, Badke, Dangi, Jaspal, Patwa, Solanki, Matlana, Dagar, and Banwari. Their main occupation remains metal burnishing. They are involved in the manufacturing of implements such as spades, sickles, sieves and iron baskets. A small number are now farmers, raising poultry and cattle.\n\nIn Punjab, the Sikligar are still engaged in the manufacture of swords, knives, daggers and buckets, selling these implements directly to villagers. The Sikh Sikligar are strictly endogamous, and practice clan exogamy; their customs are similar to other Sikh communities in Punjab. They speak Punjabi, with most understanding Hindi. The community now has OBC status.\n"}

{"id": "200732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=200732", "title": "Spiritualism", "text": "Spiritualism\n\nSpiritualism is a religious movement based on the belief that the spirits of the dead exist and have both the ability and the inclination to communicate with the living. The afterlife, or the \"spirit world\", is seen by spiritualists, not as a static place, but as one in which spirits continue to evolve. These two beliefs — that contact with spirits is possible, and that spirits are more advanced than humans — lead spiritualists to a third belief, that spirits are capable of providing useful knowledge about moral and ethical issues, as well as about the nature of God. Some spiritualists will speak of a concept which they refer to as \"spirit guides\"—specific spirits, often contacted, who are relied upon for spiritual guidance. Spiritism, a branch of spiritualism developed by Allan Kardec and today practiced mostly in Continental Europe and Latin America, especially in Brazil, emphasizes reincarnation.\n\nSpiritualism developed and reached its peak growth in membership from the 1840s to the 1920s, especially in English-speaking countries. By 1897, spiritualism was said to have more than eight million followers in the United States and Europe, mostly drawn from the middle and upper classes.\n\nSpiritualism flourished for a half century without canonical texts or formal organization, attaining cohesion through periodicals, tours by trance lecturers, camp meetings, and the missionary activities of accomplished mediums. Many prominent spiritualists were women, and like most spiritualists, supported causes such as the abolition of slavery and women's suffrage. By the late 1880s the credibility of the informal movement had weakened due to accusations of fraud perpetrated by mediums, and formal spiritualist organizations began to appear. Spiritualism is currently practiced primarily through various denominational spiritualist churches in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\nSpiritualists believe in the possibility of communication with the spirits of dead people, whom they regard as \"discarnate humans\". They believe that spirit mediums are gifted to carry on such communication, but that anyone may become a medium through study and practice. They believe that spirits are capable of growth and perfection, progressing through higher spheres or planes, and that the afterlife is not a static state, but one in which spirits evolve. The two beliefs—that contact with spirits is possible, and that spirits may dwell on a higher plane—lead to a third belief, that spirits can provide knowledge about moral and ethical issues, as well as about God and the afterlife. Many believers therefore speak of \"spirit guides\"—specific spirits, often contacted, and relied upon for worldly and spiritual guidance.\n\nAccording to spiritualists, anyone may receive spirit messages, but formal communication sessions (séances) are held by mediums, who claim thereby to receive information about the afterlife. \n\nAs an informal movement, spiritualism does not have a defined set of rules, but various spiritualist organizations have adopted variations on some or all of a \"Declaration of Principles\" developed between 1899 and 1944 and revised as recently as 2004. In October 1899, a six article \"Declaration of Principles\" was adopted by the National Spiritualist Association (NSA) at a convention in Chicago, Illinois. An additional two principles were added by the NSA in October 1909, at a convention in Rochester, New York. Finally, in October 1944, a ninth principle was adopted by the National Spiritualist Association of Churches, at a convention in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nSpiritualism first appeared in the 1840s in the \"Burned-over District\" of upstate New York, where earlier religious movements such as Millerism and Mormonism had emerged during the Second Great Awakening.\n\nThis region of New York State was an environment in which many thought direct communication with God or angels was possible, and that God would not behave harshly—for example, that God would not condemn unbaptised infants to an eternity in Hell.\n\nIn this environment, the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772) and the teachings of Franz Mesmer (1734–1815) provided an example for those seeking direct personal knowledge of the afterlife. Swedenborg, who claimed to communicate with spirits while awake, described the structure of the spirit world. Two features of his view particularly resonated with the early spiritualists: first, that there is not a single Hell and a single Heaven, but rather a series of higher and lower heavens and hells; second, that spirits are intermediates between God and humans, so that the divine sometimes uses them as a means of communication. Although Swedenborg warned against seeking out spirit contact, his works seem to have inspired in others the desire to do so.\n\nSwedenborg was formerly a highly regarded inventor and scientist, achieving several engineering innovations and studying physiology and anatomy. According to New Age, Neopagan and Religious Movements, “in 1741, he also began to have series of intense mystical experiences, dreams, and visions, claiming that he had been called by God to reform Christianity and introduce a new church.\"\n\nMesmer did not contribute religious beliefs, but he brought a technique, later known as hypnotism, that it was claimed could induce trances and cause subjects to report contact with supernatural beings. There was a great deal of professional showmanship inherent to demonstrations of Mesmerism, and the practitioners who lectured in mid-19th-century North America sought to entertain their audiences as well as to demonstrate methods for personal contact with the divine.\n\nPerhaps the best known of those who combined Swedenborg and Mesmer in a peculiarly North American synthesis was Andrew Jackson Davis, who called his system the \"harmonial philosophy\". Davis was a practicing Mesmerist, faith healer and clairvoyant from Blooming Grove, New York. He was also strongly influenced by the socialist theories of Fourierism. His 1847 book, \"The Principles of Nature, Her Divine Revelations, and a Voice to Mankind\", dictated to a friend while in a trance state, eventually became the nearest thing to a canonical work in a spiritualist movement whose extreme individualism precluded the development of a single coherent worldview.\n\nSpiritualists often set March 31, 1848, as the beginning of their movement. On that date, Kate and Margaret Fox, of Hydesville, New York, reported that they had made contact with a spirit that was later claimed to be the spirit of a murdered peddler whose body was found in the house, though no record of such a person was ever found. The spirit was said to have communicated through rapping noises, audible to onlookers. The evidence of the senses appealed to practically-minded Americans, and the Fox sisters became a sensation. As the first celebrity mediums, the sisters quickly became famous for their public séances in New York. However, in 1888 the Fox sisters admitted that this \"contact\" with the spirit was a hoax, though shortly afterward they recanted that admission.\n\nAmy and Isaac Post, Hicksite Quakers from Rochester, New York, had long been acquainted with the Fox family, and took the two girls into their home in the late spring of 1848. Immediately convinced of the veracity of the sisters' communications, they became early converts and introduced the young mediums to their circle of radical Quaker friends.\nConsequently, many early participants in spiritualism were radical Quakers and others involved in the mid-nineteenth-century reforming movement. These reformers were uncomfortable with more prominent churches because those churches did little to fight slavery and even less to advance the cause of women's rights.\n\nSuch links with reform movements, often radically socialist, had already been prepared in the 1840s, as the example of Andrew Jackson Davis shows. After 1848, many socialists became ardent spiritualists or occultists. Socialist ideas, especially in the Fourierist vein, exerted a decisive influence on Kardec and other Spiritists.\n\nThe most popular trance lecturer prior to the American Civil War was Cora L. V. Scott (1840–1923). Young and beautiful, her appearance on stage fascinated men. Her audiences were struck by the contrast between her physical girlishness and the eloquence with which she spoke of spiritual matters, and found in that contrast support for the notion that spirits were speaking through her. Cora married four times, and on each occasion adopted her husband's last name. During her period of greatest activity, she was known as Cora Hatch.\n\nAnother famous woman spiritualist was Achsa W. Sprague, who was born November 17, 1827, in Plymouth Notch, Vermont. At the age of 20, she became ill with rheumatic fever and credited her eventual recovery to intercession by spirits. An extremely popular trance lecturer, she traveled about the United States until her death in 1861. Sprague was an abolitionist and an advocate of women's rights.\n\nYet another prominent spiritualist and trance medium prior to the Civil War was Paschal Beverly Randolph (1825–1875), of mixed race, who also played a part in the abolitionist movement. Nevertheless, many abolitionists and reformers held themselves aloof from the spiritualist movement; among the skeptics was the famous abolitionist, Frederick Douglass.\n\nAnother social reform movement with significant Spiritualist involvement was the effort to improve conditions of Native Americans. As Kathryn Troy notes in a study of Indian ghosts in seances:\n\nUndoubtedly, on some level Spiritualists recognized the Indian spectres that appeared at seances as a symbol of the sins and subsequent guilt of the United States in its dealings with Native Americans. Spiritualists were literally haunted by the presence of Indians. But for many that guilt was not assuaged: rather, in order to confront the haunting and rectify it, they were galvanized into action. The political activism of Spiritualists on behalf of Indians was thus the result of combining white guilt and fear of divine judgment with a new sense of purpose and responsibility.\n\nIn the years following the sensation that greeted the Fox sisters, demonstrations of mediumship (séances and automatic writing, for example) proved to be a profitable venture, and soon became popular forms of entertainment and spiritual catharsis. The Fox sisters were to earn a living this way and others would follow their lead. Showmanship became an increasingly important part of spiritualism, and the visible, audible, and tangible evidence of spirits escalated as mediums competed for paying audiences. As independent investigating commissions repeatedly established, most notably the 1887 report of the Seybert Commission, fraud was widespread, and some of these cases were prosecuted in the courts.\n\nDespite numerous instances of chicanery, the appeal of spiritualism was strong. Prominent in the ranks of its adherents were those grieving the death of a loved one. Many families during the time of the American Civil War had seen their men go off and never return, and images of the battlefield, produced through the new medium of photography, demonstrated that their loved ones had not only died in overwhelmingly huge numbers, but horribly as well. One well known case is that of Mary Todd Lincoln who, grieving the loss of her son, organized séances in the White House which were attended by her husband, President Abraham Lincoln. The surge of spiritualism during this time, and later during World War I, was a direct response to those massive battlefield casualties.\n\nIn addition, the movement appealed to reformers, who fortuitously found that the spirits favored such causes \"du jour\" as abolition of slavery, and equal rights for women. It also appealed to some who had a materialist orientation and rejected organized religion. In 1854 the utopian socialist Robert Owen was converted to spiritualism after \"sittings\" with the American medium Maria B. Hayden (credited with introducing spiritualism to England); Owen made a public profession of his new faith in his publication \"The Rational quarterly review\" and later wrote a pamphlet, \"The future of the Human race; or great glorious and future revolution to be effected through the agency of departed spirits of good and superior men and women.\nMany scientists who investigated the phenomenon also became converts. They included chemist and physicist William Crookes (1832–1919) and evolutionary biologist Alfred Russel Wallace (1823–1913). Nobel laureate Pierre Curie was impressed by the mediumistic performances of Eusapia Palladino and advocated their scientific study. Other prominent adherents included journalist and pacifist William T. Stead (1849–1912) and physician and author Arthur Conan Doyle (1859–1930).\n\nDoyle, who lost his son Kingsley in World War I, was also a member of the Ghost Club. Founded in London in 1862, its focus was the scientific study of alleged paranormal activities in order to prove (or refute) the existence of paranormal phenomena. Famous members of the club included Charles Dickens, Sir William Crookes, Sir William F. Barrett, and Harry Price. The Paris séances of Eusapia Palladino were attended by an enthusiastic Pierre Curie and a dubious Marie Curie. The celebrated New York City physician, John Franklin Gray, was a prominent spiritualist.\n\nThe claims of spiritualists and others as to the reality of ghosts were investigated by the Society for Psychical Research, founded in London in 1882. The society set up a Committee on Haunted Houses.\n\nProminent investigators who exposed cases of fraud came from a variety of backgrounds, including professional researchers such as Frank Podmore of the Society for Psychical Research and Harry Price of the National Laboratory of Psychical Research, and professional conjurers such as John Nevil Maskelyne. Maskelyne exposed the Davenport brothers by appearing in the audience during their shows and explaining how the trick was done. \n\nThe psychical researcher Hereward Carrington exposed fraudulent mediums' tricks, such as those used in slate-writing, table-turning, trumpet mediumship, materializations, sealed-letter reading, and spirit photography. The skeptic Joseph McCabe, in his book \"Is Spiritualism Based on Fraud?\" (1920), documented many fraudulent mediums and their tricks.\n\nMagicians and writers on magic have a long history of exposing the fraudulent methods of mediumship. During the 1920s, professional magician Harry Houdini undertook a well-publicised campaign to expose fraudulent mediums; he was adamant that \"Up to the present time everything that I have investigated has been the result of deluded brains.\" Other magician or magic-author debunkers of spiritualist mediumship have included Chung Ling Soo, Henry Evans, Julien Proskauer, Fulton Oursler, Joseph Dunninger, and Joseph Rinn.\n\nIn February 1921 Thomas Lynn Bradford, in an experiment designed to ascertain the existence of an afterlife, committed suicide in his apartment by blowing out the pilot light on his heater and turning on the gas. After that date, no further communication from him was received by an associate whom he had recruited for the purpose.\n\nThe movement quickly spread throughout the world; though only in the United Kingdom did it become as widespread as in the United States.\nSpiritualist organizations were formed in America and Europe, such as the London Spiritualist Alliance, which published a newspaper called \"The Light\", featuring articles such as \"Evenings at Home in Spiritual Séance\", \"Ghosts in Africa\" and \"Chronicles of Spirit Photography\", advertisements for \"Mesmerists\" and patent medicines, and letters from readers about personal contact with ghosts.\nIn Britain, by 1853, invitations to tea among the prosperous and fashionable often included table-turning, a type of séance in which spirits were said to communicate with people seated around a table by tilting and rotating the table. One prominent convert was the French pedagogist Allan Kardec (1804–1869), who made the first attempt to systematise the movement's practices and ideas into a consistent philosophical system. Kardec's books, written in the last 15 years of his life, became the textual basis of spiritism, which became widespread in Latin countries. In Brazil, Kardec's ideas are embraced by many followers today. In Puerto Rico, Kardec's books were widely read by the upper classes, and eventually gave birth to a movement known as \"mesa blanca\" (white table).\n\nSpiritualism was mainly a middle- and upper-class movement, and especially popular with women. American spiritualists would meet in private homes for séances, at lecture halls for trance lectures, at state or national conventions, and at summer camps attended by thousands. Among the most significant of the camp meetings were Camp Etna, in Etna, Maine; Onset Bay Grove, in Onset, Massachusetts; Lily Dale, in western New York State; Camp Chesterfield, in Indiana; the Wonewoc Spiritualist Camp, in Wonewoc, Wisconsin; and Lake Pleasant, in Montague, Massachusetts. In founding camp meetings, the spiritualists appropriated a form developed by U.S. Protestant denominations in the early nineteenth century. Spiritualist camp meetings were located most densely in New England, but were also established across the upper Midwest. Cassadaga, Florida, is the most notable spiritualist camp meeting in the southern states.\n\nA number of spiritualist periodicals appeared in the nineteenth century, and these did much to hold the movement together. Among the most important were the weeklies the \"Banner of Light\" (Boston), the \"Religio-Philosophical Journal\" (Chicago), \"Mind and Matter\" (Philadelphia), the \"Spiritualist\" (London), and the \"Medium\" (London). Other influential periodicals were the \"Revue Spirite\" (France), \"Le Messager\" (Belgium), \"Annali dello Spiritismo\" (Italy), \"El Criterio Espiritista\" (Spain), and the \n\"Harbinger of Light\" (Australia). By 1880, there were about three dozen monthly spiritualist periodicals published around the world. These periodicals differed a great deal from each other, reflecting the great differences among spiritualists. Some, such as the British \"Spiritual Magazine\" were Christian and conservative, openly rejecting the reform currents so strong within spiritualism. Others, such as \"Human Nature\", were pointedly non-Christian and supportive of socialism and reform efforts. Still others, such as the \"Spiritualist\", attempted to view spiritualist phenomena from a scientific perspective, eschewing discussion on both theological and reform issues.\n\nBooks on the supernatural were published for the growing middle class, such as 1852's \"Mysteries\", by Charles Elliott, which contains \"sketches of spirits and spiritual things\", including accounts of the Salem witch trials, the Cock Lane Ghost, and the Rochester rappings.\n\"The Night Side of Nature\", by Catherine Crowe, published in 1853, provided definitions and accounts of wraiths, doppelgangers, apparitions and haunted houses.\n\nMainstream newspapers treated stories of ghosts and haunting as they would any other news story. An account in the \"Chicago Daily Tribune\" in 1891, \"sufficiently bloody to suit the most fastidious taste\", tells of a house believed to be haunted by the ghosts of three murder victims seeking revenge against their killer's son, who was eventually driven insane.\nMany families, \"having no faith in ghosts\", thereafter moved into the house, but all soon moved out again.\nIn the 1920s many \"psychic\" books were published of varied quality. Such books were often based on excursions initiated by the use of Ouija boards. A few of these popular books displayed unorganized spiritualism, though most were less insightful.\n\nThe movement was extremely individualistic, with each person relying on his or her own experiences and reading to discern the nature of the afterlife. Organisation was therefore slow to appear, and when it did it was resisted by mediums and trance lecturers. Most members were content to attend Christian churches, and particularly universalist churches harbored many spiritualists.\n\nAs the spiritualism movement began to fade, partly through the publicity of fraud accusations and partly through the appeal of religious movements such as Christian science, the Spiritualist Church was organised. This church can claim to be the main vestige of the movement left today in the United States.\n\nLondon-born Emma Hardinge Britten (1823–99) moved to the United States in 1855 and was active in spiritualist circles as a trance lecturer and organiser. She is best known as a chronicler of the movement's spread, especially in her 1884 \"Nineteenth Century Miracles: Spirits and Their Work in Every Country of the Earth\", and her 1870 \"Modern American Spiritualism\", a detailed account of claims and investigations of mediumship beginning with the earliest days of the movement.\n\nWilliam Stainton Moses (1839–92) was an Anglican clergyman who, in the period from 1872 to 1883, filled 24 notebooks with automatic writing, much of which was said to describe conditions in the spirit world. However, Frank Podmore was skeptical of his alleged ability to communicate with spirits and Joseph McCabe described Moses as a \"deliberate impostor\", suggesting his apports and all of his feats were the result of trickery.\n\nAdelma Vay (1840–1925), Hungarian (by origin) spiritistic medium, homeopath and clairvoyant, authored many books about spiritism, written in German and translated into English.\n\nEusapia Palladino (1854–1918) was an Italian spiritualist medium from the slums of Naples who made a career touring Italy, France, Germany, Britain, the United States, Russia and Poland. Palladino was said by believers to perform spiritualist phenomena in the dark: levitating tables, producing apports, and materializing spirits. On investigation, all these things were found to be products of trickery.\n\nThe British medium William Eglinton (1857–1933) claimed to perform spiritualist phenomena such as movement of objects and materializations. All of his feats were exposed as tricks.\n\nThe Bangs Sisters, Mary \"May\" E. Bangs (1862-1917) and Elizabeth \"Lizzie\" Snow Bangs (1859-1920), were two spiritualist mediums based in Chicago, who made a career out of painting the dead or \"Spirit Portraits\".\n\nMina Crandon (1888–1941), a spiritualist medium in the 1920s, was known for producing an ectoplasm hand during her séances. The hand was later exposed as a trick when biologists found it to be made from a piece of carved animal liver. In 1934, the psychical researcher Walter Franklin Prince described the Crandon case as \"the most ingenious, persistent, and fantastic complex of fraud in the history of psychic research.\"\n\nThe American voice medium Etta Wriedt (1859-1942) was exposed as a fraud by the physicist Kristian Birkeland when he discovered that the noises produced by her trumpet were caused by chemical explosions induced by potassium and water and in other cases by lycopodium powder.\n\nAnother well-known medium was the Scottish materialization medium Helen Duncan (1897–1956). In 1928 photographer Harvey Metcalfe attended a series of séances at Duncan's house and took flash photographs of Duncan and her alleged \"materialization\" spirits, including her spirit guide \"Peggy\". The photographs revealed the \"spirits\" to have been fraudulently produced, using dolls made from painted papier-mâché masks, draped in old sheets. Duncan was later tested by Harry Price at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research; photographs revealed Duncan's ectoplasm to be made from cheesecloth, rubber gloves, and cut-out heads from magazine covers.\n\nSpiritualists reacted with an uncertainty to the theories of evolution in the late 19th and early 20th century. Broadly speaking the concept of evolution fitted the spiritualist thought of the progressive development of humanity. At the same time however, the belief in the animal origins of humanity threatened the foundation of the immortality of the spirit, for if humans had not been created by God, it was scarcely plausible that they would be specially endowed with spirits. This led to spiritualists embracing spiritual evolution.\n\nThe spiritualists' view of evolution did not stop at death. Spiritualism taught that after death spirits progressed to spiritual states in new spheres of existence. According to spiritualists evolution occurred in the spirit world \"at a rate more rapid and under conditions more favourable to growth\" than encountered on earth.\n\nIn a talk at the London Spiritualist Alliance, John Page Hopps (1834–1911) supported both evolution and spiritualism. Hopps claimed humanity had started off imperfect \"out of the animal's darkness\" but would rise into the \"angel's marvellous light\". Hopps claimed humans were not fallen but rising creatures and that after death they would evolve on a number of spheres of existence to perfection.\n\nTheosophy is in opposition to the spiritualist interpretation of evolution. Theosophy teaches a metaphysical theory of evolution mixed with human devolution. Spiritualists do not accept the devolution of the theosophists. To theosophy humanity starts in a state of perfection (see Golden age) and falls into a process of progressive materialization (devolution), developing the mind and losing the spiritual consciousness. After the gathering of experience and growth through repeated reincarnations humanity will regain the original spiritual state, which is now one of self-conscious perfection.\nTheosophy and spiritualism were both very popular metaphysical schools of thought especially in the early 20th century and thus were always clashing in their different beliefs. Madame Blavatsky was critical of spiritualism; she distanced theosophy from spiritualism as far as she could and allied herself with eastern occultism.\n\nThe spiritualist Gerald Massey claimed that Darwin's theory of evolution was incomplete:\n\nThe theory contains only one half the explanation of man's origins and needs spiritualism to carry it through and complete it. For while this ascent on the physical side has been progressing through myriads of ages, the Divine descent has also been going on—man being spiritually an incarnation from the Divine as well as a human development from the animal creation. The cause of the development is spiritual. Mr. Darwin's theory does not in the least militate against ours—we think it necessitates it; he simply does not deal with our side of the subject. He can not go lower than the dust of the earth for the matter of life; and for us, the main interest of our origin must lie in the spiritual domain.\n\nSpiritualists believed that without spiritualism \"the doctrine of Darwin is a broken link\". Gerald Massey said \"Spiritualism will accept evolution, and carry it out and make both ends meet in the perfect circle\".\n\nA famous medium who rejected evolution was Cora L. V. Scott, she dismissed evolution in her lectures and instead supported a type of pantheistic spiritualism.\n\nAlfred Russel Wallace believed qualitative novelties could arise through the process of spiritual evolution, in particular the phenomena of life and mind. Wallace attributed these novelties to a supernatural agency. Later in his life, Wallace was an advocate of spiritualism and believed in an immaterial origin for the higher mental faculties of humans, he believed that evolution suggested that the universe had a purpose, and that certain aspects of living organisms are not explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes, in a 1909 magazine article entitled \"The World of Life\", which he later expanded into a book of the same name. Wallace argued in his 1911 book \"World of Life\" for a spiritual approach to evolution and described evolution as \"creative power, directive mind and ultimate purpose\". Wallace believed natural selection could not explain intelligence or morality in the human being so suggested that non-material spiritual forces accounted for these. Wallace believed the spiritual nature of humanity could not have come about by natural selection alone, the origins of the spiritual nature must originate \"in the unseen universe of spirit\".\n\nOliver Lodge also promoted a version of spiritual evolution in his books \"Man and the Universe\" (1908), \"Making of Man\" (1924) and \"Evolution and Creation\" (1926). The spiritualist element in the synthesis was most prominent in Lodge's 1916 book \"Raymond, or Life and Death\" which revived a large interest for public in the paranormal.\n\nAfter the 1920s, spiritualism evolved in three different directions, all of which exist today.\n\nThe first of these continued the tradition of individual practitioners, organised in circles centered on a medium and clients, without any hierarchy or dogma. Already by the late 19th century spiritualism had become increasingly syncretic, a natural development in a movement without central authority or dogma. Today, among these unorganised circles, spiritualism is similar to the new age movement. However, theosophy with its inclusion of Eastern religion, astrology, ritual magic and reincarnation is an example of a closer precursor of the 20th century new age movement. Today's syncretic spiritualists are quite heterogeneous in their beliefs regarding issues such as reincarnation or the existence of God. Some appropriate new age and neo-pagan beliefs, while others call themselves \"Christian spiritualists\", continuing with the tradition of cautiously incorporating spiritualist experiences into their Christian faith.\n\nThe second direction taken has been to adopt formal organization, patterned after Christian denominations, with established liturgies and a set of seven principles, and training requirements for mediums. In the United States the spiritualist churches are primarily affiliated either with the National Spiritualist Association of Churches or the loosely allied group of denominations known as the spiritual church movement; in the U.K. the predominant organization is the Spiritualists' National Union, founded in 1890.\n\nFormal education in spiritualist practice emerged in 1920s, with organizations like the William T. Stead Center in Chicago, Illinois, and continue today with the Arthur Findlay College at Stansted Hall in England, and the Morris Pratt Institute in Wisconsin, United States.\n\nDiversity of belief among organized spiritualists has led to a few schisms, the most notable occurring in the U.K. in 1957 between those who held the movement to be a religion \"sui generis\" (of its own with unique characteristics), and a minority who held it to be a denomination within Christianity. In the United States, this distinction can be seen between the less Christian organization, the National Spiritualist Association of Churches, and the more Christian spiritual church movement.\n\nThe practice of organized spiritualism today resembles that of any other religion, having discarded most showmanship, particularly those elements resembling the conjurer's art. There is thus a much greater emphasis on \"mental\" mediumship and an almost complete avoidance of the apparently miraculous \"materializing\" mediumship that so fascinated early believers such as Arthur Conan Doyle. The first spiritualist church in Australia was the United Stanmore & Enmore Spiritualist Church established in 1913. In 1921, Conan Doyle gave a farewell to Australia speech there.\n\nAlready as early as 1882, with the founding of the Society for Psychical Research (SPR), parapsychologists emerged to investigate spiritualist claims. The SPR's investigations into spiritualism exposed many fraudulent mediums which contributed to the decline of interest in physical mediumship.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3669622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3669622", "title": "The Root of All Evil?", "text": "The Root of All Evil?\n\nThe Root of All Evil?, later retitled The God Delusion, is a television documentary written and presented by Richard Dawkins in which he argues that humanity would be better off without religion or belief in God.\n\nThe documentary was first broadcast in January 2006, in the form of two 45-minute episodes (excluding advertisement breaks), on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. Dawkins did not think \"The Root of All Evil?\" was an ideal title. His book \"The God Delusion\", published in September 2006, explores topics from the documentary in more detail.\n\n\"The God Delusion\" explored the unproven traditions that are given as fact by religious faiths, and the extremes that some followers take them. Dawkins argues that faith is not a way of understanding the world (described as \"non-thought\"), and is opposed to modern science which tests hypotheses and builds theories to describe the world. Dawkins visits the United States to interview pastor Ted Haggard, president of the National Association of Evangelicals, and to Jerusalem to interview Yousef al-Khattab (Joseph Cohen), an American born Jew who settled in Israel before converting to Islam. Responding to charges that scientific understanding doesn't entitle one to reject religion, Dawkins describe's Bertrand Russell's celestial teapot thought experiment.\n\nIn \"The Virus Of Faith\" Dawkins made a more emotional appeal. The programme examined the moral framework that religions are often cited as providing, and argued against the indoctrination of children. The title of the programme comes from Dawkins' 1976 book \"The Selfish Gene\" in which Dawkins introduced the idea of the meme. DNA travels from parents to offspring in genes, but some DNA in the form of viruses can also pass between any individuals.\n\nDawkins compares religious faith to a virus, being passed from parents to offspring and teachers to pupils. Dawkins visits a London Hasidic Jewish school, in which students are largely isolated from outside ideas. Also in London, Dawkins visits Phoenix Academy, one of the semi-independent city academies introduced by Tony Blair's government, which follows the American Accelerated Christian Learning curriculum. Dawkins finds the pupils rote learning biblical stories, which are integrated into various academic subjects. Dawkins interviews the head teacher of the school, asking why the science curriculum includes Noah's Ark and describes AIDS as the \"wages of sin\". When the teacher states that without God or a law-giver people will tend to do bad things, Dawkins takes this as a cue to explore the differences between secular ethics and morality based on religious law.\n\nReturning to the United States Dawkins visits the Hell-House Outreach Programme, an organisation that uses hell for \"moral policing\", producing videos aimed at twelve-year-olds. He also interviews Michael Bray, a friend of Paul Jennings Hill who was sentenced to death for murdering a doctor who performed abortions. Dawkins takes Bray's belief that the bible sanctions capital punishment for adultery as a cue to discuss his views that the bible, especially the Old Testament, clashes with modern secular ethics. Quoting from the Old Testament, Dawkins describes its God as \"the most unpleasant character in all fiction,\" and expresses similar disregard for the New Testament's \"sadomasochistic doctrine of atonement for original sin.\"\n\nDawkins interviews Richard Harries, the Bishop of Oxford, a liberal Anglican, about why Harries accepts some of the Bible while rejecting others, including many of its moral teachings. Harries states that it is possible to be intellectually fulfilled as both a rationalist and religious person.\n\nFinally Dawkins discusses some of the ideas about morality from evolutionary biology, such as reciprocal altruism and kin selection.\n\nDawkins has said that the title \"The Root of All Evil?\" was not his preferred choice, but that Channel 4 had insisted on it to create controversy. The sole concession from the producers on the title was the addition of the question mark. Dawkins has stated that the notion of anything being the root of \"all\" evil is ridiculous. Dawkins' book \"The God Delusion\", released in September 2006, goes on to examine the topics raised in the documentary in greater detail. The documentary was rebroadcast on the More4 channel on 25 August 2010 under the title of \"The God Delusion\".\n\nWriting in the \"New Statesman\", Dawkins stated that Channel 4's correspondence in response to the documentary had been running at two to one in favour. Journalists including Howard Jacobson had accused Dawkins of giving voice to extremists, a claim Dawkins responded to by noting that the National Association of Evangelicals has some 30 million members, and also that he had invited the main UK religious leaders to participate, but they all declined.\nHowever, Alister McGrath, a Professor of Historical Theology at Oxford University, was interviewed for the program, but was not included in the documentary. McGrath claimed to have made Dawkins \"appear uncomfortable\" with his explanations of religious belief and the implication, made by McGrath, was that Dawkins's program showed journalistic dishonesty. In a lecture at City Church of San Francisco McGrath said that his interview was cut because he said things that did not promote the message that Dawkins and the producers wanted to get across. The McGrath interview, together with other interviews not shown in the program \"The Root of All Evil?\", was released in the DVD \"Root of All Evil? The Uncut Interviews\".\n\nThe religious journalist Madeleine Bunting produced a scathing review for \"The Guardian\", in which she described the documentary as \"a piece of intellectually lazy polemic not worthy of a great scientist\". In \"The Tablet\", Keith Ward criticised Dawkins for what he considered to be an indiscriminate and simplistic approach to religion. Professor Keith Ward's book \"Is Religion Dangerous?\", responding to the Dawkins programme, analyzes the claim that religion does more harm than good and suggests that \"such assertions ... ignore the available evidence... and substitute rhetoric for analysis\".\n\nCharlie Brooker writes for \"The Guardian\" that Dawkins' \"central point [...] seems pretty valid from where I'm standing\" but that Dawkins \"quickly becomes far too angry to conduct a civil conversation\" in interviews with religious people and this \"doesn't exactly move the debate forward\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29734047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29734047", "title": "Ursula Kuczynski", "text": "Ursula Kuczynski\n\nUrsula Kuczynski (15 May 1907, Schöneberg, Prussia, German Empire – 7 July 2000, Berlin, Germany, also known as Ruth Werner, Ursula Beurton and Ursula Hamburger) was a German Communist activist who worked for the Soviet Union in the 1930s and 1940s as a spy, most famously as the handler of nuclear scientist Klaus Fuchs. She moved to East Germany in 1950 when Fuchs was unmasked, and published a series of books related to her spy work, including her bestselling autobiography, \"Sonjas Rapport\".\n\nSources concerned with her espionage work in the 1930s/40s sometimes use the cover name originally suggested to her in Shanghai by her fellow intelligence operative, Richard Sorge: \"Sonja\", \"Sonja Schultz\" or, after she moved to Britain, \"Sonya\".\n\nUrsula Maria Kuczynski was second of the six recorded children born to the distinguished economist and demographer Robert René Kuczynski and his wife Berta Gradenwitz/Kuczynski, who was a painter. The children were academically gifted and the family was prosperous. Her elder brother, Jürgen would later become a distinguished historian-economist who had a controversial relationship of his own with the espionage community. Ursula grew up in a small villa in the Schlachtensee quarter in the southwest of Berlin. When she was eleven she landed a screen role in \"The House of Three Girls\" (1918), the cinema version of \"Das Dreimäderlhaus\".\n\nShe attended the \"Lyzeum\" (secondary school) in Berlin-Zehlendorf and then, between 1924 and 1926, undertook an apprenticeship as a book dealer. She had already, in 1924, joined the left-leaning Free Employees league (\"AfA-Bund\"), and 1924 was also the year in which she joined the Young Communists (KJVD) and Germany's Red Aid (\"Rote Hilfe\"). In May 1926, the month of her nineteenth birthday, Ursula Kuczynski joined the Communist Party of Germany.\n\nIn 1926/27 she attended a librarianship academy while working at a lending library. She then took a job at Ullstein Verlag, a large Berlin publishing house. However, she lost this job in 1928 after participating in a May-Day Demonstration and/or on account of her Communist Party membership. Between December 1928 and August 1929 she worked in a New York book shop before returning to Berlin where she married her first husband, Rudolf Hamburger, who was an architect and fellow member of the Communist Party. It was also at this time that she set up the Marxist Workers' Library (MAB) in Berlin which she headed up between August 1929 and June 1930.\n\nWith her husband she relocated, in July 1930, to Shanghai where a frenetic construction boom afforded ample opportunities for Hamburger's architectural work. She would remain based in China till 1935. It was here that the couple's son, the Shakespeare scholar , was born in February 1931. After they had been in Shanghai for a little more than four months she was introduced by the US journalist Agnes Smedley to another German expatriate, Richard Sorge, outwardly a journalist, who is better remembered as \"Ramsai\" an active agent of the Soviet Intelligence Directorate (GRU). Sources are vague as to whether the Hamburgers were already working for the GRU before they left Germany for China, but in any case it was after the meeting with Sorge that between 1930 and 1935 \"Sonja\" (the cover name by which Kuczynski was known in The Service - means dormouse in Russian) operated a Russian spy ring under Sorge's direction.\n\nIn Autumn 1934 she had to send her son Michael to live with her husband's parents (now relocated from Germany to Czechoslovakia) when she was sent to Moscow where she undertook a seven-month training session before returning to China. There had been a concern that if baby Michael had accompanied her to Moscow he might inadvertently have blown her cover later by blurting out words in Russian. It was also during this period that she mastered various practical aspects of spy-craft. This included radio operator skills that were much prized in the world of espionage: she learned to build and operate a radio receiver, becoming an exceptionally fluent and accurate user of Morse code. Between March and December 1934 she was based in Shenyang in Manchuria which had been under Japanese military occupation since 1931. Here she met the GRU's chief agent who was working under the name \"Ernst\". Sonja and Ernst had a romance which would result in the birth of her daughter Janina in April 1936. Her husband Rudolf Hamburger generously acknowledged \"Nina\" as though she were his own daughter. The GRU was nevertheless concerned that the affair with Ernst might lead to the unmasking of both agents, and she was recalled with Rudolf to Moscow in August 1935. In September 1935 they were both posted to Poland where, apart from at least one more lengthy visit to Moscow, they would remain till Autumn 1938. In the meantime it would later transpire that in 1937 the Soviets awarded her the Order of the Red Banner for her espionage work in China. Without ever wearing a uniform, she now held the rank of colonel in the Soviet military.\n\nBetween Autumn 1938 and December 1940, as agent \"Sonja Schultz\", she was based, still with her husband Rudolf Hamburger, in Switzerland where she was one of the so-called \"red three\", together with Sándor Radó: her duties included working as a specialist radio operator, applying technical skills acquired during her Moscow visits earlier in the decade. The codes she used to send information to Moscow from her little house in Caux, a three-hour walk up into the mountains above Montreux, have never been deciphered. In Switzerland, which was where her marriage with Rudolf Hamburger finally broke apart, she collaborated with the Lucy spy ring and was involved in recruiting agents to be infiltrated into Germany. After the Nazi take-over of Danzig in Autumn 1939 she also set up a resistance group in the formerly free city.\n\nShe divorced later that same year, and early in 1940, while still in Switzerland, married her second husband. Len Beurton, like her, was working for the Soviet GRU, and like Kuczynski he came with an unusually wide range of names. He also came with a British passport, and by marrying him Agent Sonya automatically acquired a British passport too. Sent by the GRU she and her new husband now relocated from Switzerland to England where she would remain for the rest of the 1940s, and where her second son was born in the late summer of 1943. They had settled in north Oxford, but soon moved on to the first of a succession of nearby villages, settling initially in Glympton, and then in Kidlington. In May 1945 the Beurtons relocated again, to a larger house in the north Oxfordshire village of Great Rollright where they remained till 1949 or 1950, becoming so integrated into the village community that both her parents, who were frequent visitors in Oxfordshire even after the war ended, and who both died in 1947, are buried in the Great Rollright churchyard. In each Oxfordshire property in which she lived Agent Sonya installed a radio receiver and transmitter (which during the war would have been considered illegal had it come to the attention of the authorities). Living in Oxfordshire placed them conveniently close to Ursula's parents who had emigrated to London after 1933, and were then living with friends in Oxford because of the air raids in London.\n\nThe Beurtons' Oxfordshire village homes were also close to the UK's Atomic Research Centre at Harwell, and to Blenheim Palace, where a large part of the British intelligence service had been relocated at the start of the war. In Oxfordshire, together with , she worked on infiltrating German Communist exiles into the US Intelligence Agency. By Autumn 1944 she and Henschke had succeeded in penetrating UK activities of the US Intelligence Service (OSS). The Americans were at this time preparing an effort called \"Operation Hammer\" for parachuting UK-based German exiles into Germany. Ursula Beurton was able to ensure that a substantial number of the parachuted OSS agents would be reliable communists, able and willing to make inside intelligence from the \"Third Reich\" available not merely to the US military in Washington, but also to Moscow.\n\nFrom 1943 she also worked as a courier for the USSR's \"Atomic spies\", Klaus Fuchs and Melita Norwood. Agent Sonya thus hastened the development of the Soviet atomic bomb, successfully tested in 1949. In addition to the (retrospectively) high-profile spies Fuchs and Norwood, Sonya was the GRU handler for (among others) an officer of the British Royal Air Force and a British specialist in submarine radar. She was also able to pass to her Soviet employers information from her brother, her father, and other exiled Germans in England. It was, indeed, her brother Jürgen Kuczynski, an internationally respected economist, who originally recruited Klaus Fuchs to spy for the Soviets at the end of 1942.\n\nMany years later Ruth Werner (as she would by that time have become known) recalled that she was twice visited by MI5 representatives in 1947, and asked about her links with Soviet intelligence, which Werner refused to discuss. Werner's communist sympathies were no secret, but it seems that British suspicions were insufficiently supported by evidence to justify her arrest. Her visitors were unaware of or unconcerned by her periodic, and apparently casual, meetings with Fuchs in Banbury or on country cycle rides. At that time the British intelligence services seem to have been disinclined to follow up their concerns. Two years later detonation of the first Soviet atomic bomb refocused priorities within MI5, however. Klaus Fuchs was arrested towards the end of 1949; in January 1950 he was put on trial and confessed that he was a spy. The day before his trial started, fearing that she was about to be unmasked, Agent Sonya left England. In March 1950, after two decades away from the city of her birth, she turned up back in Berlin. Meanwhile, Klaus Fuchs finally identified her as his Soviet contact in November 1950. The espionage-related aspects of her friendship with Melita Norwood only began to emerge several decades later.\n\nGermany had changed. Ursula Beurton returned to East Berlin in the Soviet occupation zone of what remained of the country, although the Soviet Military Administration had by now retreated into the background following the formal establishment of the German Democratic Republic in October 1949. A systematic nation building process had actually been underway for several years before 1949, starting with the arrival from Moscow of 30 well prepared formerly exiled German communists in Berlin at the start of May 1945, led by a man called Walter Ulbricht. One change was the disappearance in the new country of the Communist Party of Germany. In fact, the party had not exactly disappeared, but it had been replaced in April 1946 through the contentious merger of the Communist party with the East German elements of the old German Social Democratic Party (SPD), to form the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / \"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\"). On her arrival in East Berlin Beurton lost little time in resigning from the GRU and joining the SED. Six years later she started to re-emerge with a new life as an author. In the meantime, she undertook some journalism and other writing work. She was given a government job in 1950 as head of the Capitalist Countries Division in the Central Department of Foreign Information in the Government Information Office. She was later fired from the Government Information office, reportedly because she forgot properly to lock the armour plated door of a large safe. Between 1953 and 1956 she worked in the Chamber of Commerce for foreign trade.\nHer short (64 page) publication \"Immer unterwegs. Reportage aus Prag über die Tätigkeit unserer Ingenieure im Ausland\" was published under the name \"Ursula Beurton\" in Berlin in 1956.\n\nBetween 1958 and 1988, she produced a succession of books under the name by which she subsequently came to be known, Ruth Werner. Most were story books for children or suitably expurgated memoirs of her time in espionage. Her autobiography appeared in East Germany under the title \"Sonjas Rapport\" (\"Sonya's Report\") and became a bestseller. There was no mention of Klaus Fuchs who was still alive in 1976, and, presumably for the same reason, no mention of Melita Norwood. An English language version appeared in 1991 and a Chinese translation in 1999. An uncensored German language version came out only in 2006, although many questions were still left unanswered.\n\nIn 1982 Ruth Werner became a member of the of PEN International.\n\nAs the stand-alone existence of the German Democratic Republic came to an end, Ruth Werner was one of the few people energetically to defend it. On 10 November 1989, directly after The Wall was breached she took to the political stage, addressing tens of thousands of people at a meeting in the Berlin Lustgarten (pleasure park) on the subject of her faith in Socialism with a human face. During the ensuing months of the run-up to German reunification she placed great faith in Egon Krenz, who briefly served as the East German leader.\n\nShe lived another ten years and seems never to have regretted or seen the need to apologize for her espionage. Back in 1956, when Nikita Khrushchev made public the darker face of Communist Russia under Stalin, she was invited to comment. She was reluctant to join the criticism of the Soviet wartime leader:\n\nInterviewed in 2000, a few months before her death, she was asked about the consequences of \"Die Wende\", the changes which had led to German reunification (which many of her persuasion still saw as a peaceful annexation of East Germany by West Germany):\n\nSince 1989 more information has become available concerning at least some of her espionage achievements, and appreciation of Ruth Werner's exceptional abilities has grown. In the opinion of one historian who has studied her career, she was \"one of the top spies ever produced by the Soviet Union and her penetration of Britain's secrets and MI5 possibly went far deeper than was thought at the time she was operational.\" An unidentified GRU chief is reported to have observed during the war, \"If we had five Sonyas in England, the war would end sooner.\" Werner herself could be more reticent about her contribution: \"I was simply working as a messenger\" \"(\"Ich arbeitete ja bloß als Kurier.\")\"\n\nWhat is incontrovertible is that she engaged in an exceptionally high risk trade on behalf of Stalin's Intelligence machine without being shot by the enemy or sent to the Gulag by her own side. Her husband and the father of her first son, , who also worked for Soviet intelligence, fell foul of the Soviet regime in 1943 and was deported to the Gulag in the east of the Soviet Union. He was released in 1952 but remained officially \"banned\" and was sent to Ukraine, only being permitted to return to Germany in 1955. This type of experience was far from unusual among Soviet spies. Sandór Radó with whom she had worked so closely in the hills above Geneva also spent long years as a guest of the Russian Gulag. Richard Sorge, who probably recruited her to work for Moscow in the first place, was caught and hanged by the Japanese. Werner herself, as far as her story has come into the public domain, suffered nothing more harrowing than a couple of pointed but ultimately inconclusive meetings with British Intelligence agents in 1947, and was able to escape to the safe haven of East Germany before her espionage activities became the subject of any trial or other retributive process. Simple survival represented a considerable achievement under the circumstances of her two decades in espionage, and seem to justify the media epithets she attracted to the effect that she was \"Stalin's best spy\" (\"Stalins beste Spionin\").\n\n\n"}

He has around 4,000 followers (called Vissarionites) living in the settlement and around 10,000 followers worldwide.\n\nVissarion claims to be a reincarnated Christ. He teaches reincarnation, vegetarianism, and apocalypse. On 18 August 1990, when he was 29, Vissarion claims that he had a revelation that he was the reincarnation of Christ. He first spoke publicly in Minusinsk on 18 August 1991. He founded the \"Church of the Last Testament\" (Церковь Последнего Завета \"Tserkov Poslednego Zaveta\"), also known as \"Community of Unified Faith\".\n\nVissarion was born in Krasnodar; after service in the Red Army, he settled in Minusinsk. He worked as a patrol officer before losing his job in 1989. He claims that in 1990 he was \"reborn\" as Vissarion, a returned Christ. In his system this does not make him God, but instead the word of God. His religion combines elements of the Russian Orthodox Church with Buddhism, apocalypticism, collectivism, and ecological values. His followers observe strict regulations, are vegetarians, and are allowed no vices such as smoking or drinking alcohol, and money is banned. The aim of the group is to unite all religions on Earth. Vissarion formed his religion around the time of the fall of the USSR.\n\nTiberkul, the settlement in the Taiga, was established in 1994 on a territory of , and today the community spans several nearby villages as well, including villages of Petropavlovka and Cheremshanka, at ca. , and counts some five thousand inhabitants, largely living autochthonous and on ecological principles. The central settlement, also called \"The Town\" and \"The Mountain\", has a three-tiered structure: the Town itself (\"Abode of Dawn\"), the \"Heavenly Abode\", and the \"Temple Peak\".\n\nIn October 1995, the religious association of Vissarion officially registered as the \"Church of the Last Testament\".\n\nVissarion has two wives, and six children from two marriages. He rejected his first wife and married a nineteen-year-old who had lived with him since she was a girl of seven.\n\nVissarion has a younger half-sister, Irina. Though his biological mother is a woman named Nadyezhda, Vissarion considers Mary, mother of Jesus, as his own mother.\n\nVissarion's cult is estimated to have some ten thousand adherents, with claims of up to 50,000 adherents in eighty-three communities spread over 150 square kilometers..\n\nSince 1992, biographer Vadim Redkin has published an annual volume detailing Vissarion's activities. Vissarion has attracted a number of followers from Germany's esoteric subculture, and seven volumes of Vadim's account have been translated into German.\n\nIn March 2010, UK TV channel, Channel 4 showed an hour-long documentary about Vissarion and his followers.\n\nIn May 2012, the \"Vice\" YouTube channel uploaded a video titled \"Cult Leader Thinks He's Jesus (Documentary Exclusive)\". This video follows the experiences of Rocco, a reporter for \"Vice\" in Petropavlovka and his interview with Vissarion. The video depicts the settlement and the people as a very nice place with good people, but the ideas of the \"religion\" as very cultish. This was the first time Vissarion had granted an interview in three years. Rocco asked him about the stance of his religion and what it is based on, such as aliens, the downfall of the USSR, his favorite color and foods, and his experiences and memories of Jesus. Vissarion avoided direct answers.\n\nIn August 2012, the 16x9 YouTube channel uploaded an interview titled \"Jesus of Siberia\".\nIn August 2013, the SBS Dateline YouTube channel uploaded a video called \"Jesus of Siberia\"\n\nIn January 2014, the RT YouTube Channel uploaded a documentary titled \"Siberian 'Messiah' (RT Documentary)\". The video shows that he predicts that a great flood is coming and that he promises salvation and spiritual perfection to his followers. His followers choose to abandon their homes and build settlements near the sacred Mountain, where “The Teacher” lives. One woman, a former member of the cult, in the video shares her experience and explains how her new faith has torn her family apart.\n\nIn 2017, he appeared on the BBC documentary \"Russia with Simon Reeve\".\n\nThere is a community in Russia who are followers of Vissarion in Siberia, the population of this community is 4000. There are Vissarion churches in Germany and in Bulgaria.\n\n\n"}

He is the founder of Agudas Ohalei Tzadikim.\n\nGabbai's father was a native of Morocco and his mother a descendant of German Jews; they married in France, where Gabbai was born. \n\nHe along with his family later moved to Israel. In his youth, Gabbai attended Yeshivas Lucerne under Rav Yitzchok Dov Koppelman and went on to study in the Ponevezh Yeshiva in Bnei Brak and the Breslov Yeshiva in Jerusalem.\n\nIn 1980, Gabbai traveled to the Soviet Union for the first time to visit the grave of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov in Uman, Ukraine. Upon touring other cities, he was shocked by the degradation and ruin of Jewish holy sites in Russia. During the Soviet era, Jewish gravestones were often uprooted by vandals or by poor people who used the stones for heating and building. In large cities, the Soviets destroyed and paved over entire cemeteries to build sports complexes and other buildings. In 1989, after the fall of Communism, Gabbai began his work of identifying and restoring Jewish holy sites in the Former Soviet Union.\n\nIn Medzhybizh, Ukraine, burial place of the Baal Shem Tov, Gabbai was instrumental in refurbishing the Baal Shem Tov's grave and \"ohel\", which also covers the graves of the Degel Machaneh Ephraim, the Apter Rav, and Rabbi Boruch of Medzhybizh. Gabbai also built a large synagogue near the Baal Shem Tov's burial place, a guest house and a mikveh. He is currently completing the reconstruction of the synagogue of the Apter Rav in Medzhybizh, which was destroyed by fire.\n\nAccording to his website, Gabbai is active in nearly every Jewish cemetery in Ukraine, renovating, fencing and marking cemeteries which have been paved over for buildings. He also established a permanent \"ner tamid\" at the graves of the Baal Shem Tov and Rebbe Nachman of Breslov.\n\nIn recent years, Gabbai expanded his activities to include grave restoration work in Syria, Yemen, Turkey and Israel. \n\nGabbai calls on many resources in his work. For example, in the restorations in Mezhibuz, he consulted with an elderly Jew living in Ashdod, Israel, who had hid in Mezhibuz as an 18-year-old refugee during World War II, and with a rabbi whose father, the former Rav of the town, had sketched a detailed map that identified important graves and Jewish landmarks. In his quest to identify the unmarked grave of Rashi, he consulted with a French-Jewish philosopher who was able to access academic archives to unearth an ancient map.\n\nHis accomplishments include:\n\nWhile Gabbai is a resident of Israel, he also has a French passport which allows him to enter countries hostile to Israel, such as Syria. When he travels, however, he makes no secret of his mission and dresses in full Hasidic regalia, including flat-topped, wide-brim hat, hand-knitted yarmulke, short pants and Hasidic rekel (long coat), in addition to his full beard and payot.\n\n"}
{"id": "802103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=802103", "title": "Yoh Asakura", "text": "Yoh Asakura\n\nYoh also in the prequel \"Shaman King Zero\" and in the sequel \"Shaman King Flowers\". He also appears in the anime adaptation of \"Shaman King\" where his Japanese voice actress is Yūko Satō, and his English dub voice is provided by Sebastian Arcelus. He also appears as the protagonist in all the \"Shaman King\" video games and appears in multiple crossover fighting games alongside other characters that appeared in the same magazine that \"Shaman King\" debuted. Critical reception to Yoh has been mostly positive, based on his interactions with other characters. Merchandising based on him has also been released.\n\nFor Takei, Yoh was the hardest character to make; Takei explained that it was difficult to develop Yoh's character because of the criteria set by \"Weekly Shōnen Jump\". The engagement between Yoh and Anna being introduced at the beginning of the story has been regarded as unusual for a shonen manga for its maturity and partly reflects Takei's own personal experience, but it still an ideal relationship.\nYoh is the protagonist of \"Shaman King\" who befriends a fellow student from school named Manta Oyamada during his introduction. When Manta is badly beaten by local delinquents led by \"Wooden Sword\" Ryu, Yoh reveals himself to be a shaman and comes to Manta's defence with the help of a six-hundred-year-old samurai ghost, Amidamaru. Yoh and Manta soon become best friends and have numerous adventures involving local ghosts until Yoh reveals his actual purpose in coming to Tokyo: he has come to train for the Shaman Fight, an event that occurs once every 500 years, where shaman from all over the world will battle to become the Shaman King and gain the power to change the world. In order to ensure he trains properly, Yoh is soon joined by his fiancée Anna Kyoyama, an itako from Aomori, who drives Yoh relentlessly and brutally so that he may stand up to the powerful opponents he will have to contend with in order to become Shaman King. While Yoh possesses an overly laid-back personality and lazy demeanor, he is noted as being a perceptive individual who is generally able to remain cool under pressure. His most distinctive trait is a pair of orange headphones and a necklace with three bear claws, both which he wears almost constantly; his usual attire consists of his school uniform with his shirt unbuttoned along with a pair of sandals. He is the latest descendant and heir to the Asakura family, a prestigious family of shaman whose lineage dates back to the Heian era.\n\nDespite Yoh's claims that he wishes to become Shaman King merely to live an easy life, his primary motivation is the promise he made to Anna when they first met and he saved her life after her powers, fueled by her deep-seated hatred of humanity and the resulting loneliness she felt, nearly destroyed her. Because Yoh's own loneliness in childhood, resulting from being regarded as an outcast by his peers for being a shaman, he deeply treasures his friends and will not hesitate to do anything to protect them.\n\nIt is revealed in the series Yoh was born as the younger of a pair of identical twin brothers to Keiko Asakura and Mikihisa Maki. Before Yoh's birth, it had been predicted that the family's progenitor, Hao Asakura, would reincarnate himself for the second time as one of Keiko's children and attempt to become Shaman King. The circumstances allowed the Asakuras to spare Yoh and Yohmei raised his grandson with the hope that he would be able to defeat Hao once and for all, thwarting Hao's plans to create a shaman only world.\n\nIn 1995, Yoh's grandmother Kino suggests that Yoh be engaged to her apprentice, Anna Kyoyama. Accompanied by the spirit Matamune, Yoh went to Aomori and fell in love with Anna at first sight. However, her unchecked ability to read minds resulted in Anna closing her heart off and developing a hatred of humanity, which manifested as powerful demons. Matamune, who had once been the original Hao's greatest friend, used his power to help Yoh save Anna; Anna began to open her heart again out of the love she had developed for Yoh and Yoh resolved to become strong enough to summon Matamune again in material form.\n\nUpon entering the Shaman Fight, he meets a number of shaman who would become his friends and allies. Upon the second round of the Shaman Fight, Yoh becomes the leader of \"Team Funbari Onsen\", which includes \"Wooden Sword\" Ryu and Faust VIII as his teammates. When Yoh learns of his connection to Hao and learns more about his past and personality, Yoh becomes determined not only to stop Hao from realizing his plan to create a shaman only world, but also the considerably more difficult task of saving Hao by defeating the darkness in Hao's heart.\n\nIn \"Funbari no Uta\", a series of short stories written by Hiroyuki Takei and set six or seven years after the conclusion of \"Shaman King\", it is revealed that Yoh and Anna have a son named Hana. The child wields Yoh's \"Futsunomitama Sword\" and travels around with Ryu Umemiya in search of the Five Elemental Warriors. An older Yoh and Anna do not appear until the conclusion of the short series, apparently on their way to Funbari Hill, as they have been travelling around the world in order to resolve various conflicts. In their absence, Hana was raised by Tamao Tamamura with no awareness of who his actual parents are, though Tamao intends to tell him when his parents return at last. Yoh and Anna also appear in flashbacks in \"Shaman King Flowers\", the sequel from \"Shaman King\" series set about six or seven years after \"Funbari no Uta\" with Hana. \"Shaman King Flowers\" also revealed Yoh became a father when he was 16 years old.\n\nYoh appears as a playable character for the Nintendo DS titles, \"Jump Superstars\" and \"Jump Ultimate Stars\". He also appears as a main character in the various video games based on the \"Shaman King\" series.\n\nHe has been featured various times in the \"Animage\"'s Anime Grand Prix polls, ranking as one of the most popular male anime characters. Merchandise based on Yoh have been released, including action figures, key chains, and plush toys. In a \"Shaman King\" popularity poll from 2018, Yoh's first appearance was voted as the series' most popular character. \n\nCritical reception to Yoh's character has been both positive and negative. Justin Freeman from Anime News Network qualified Yoh as \"easy-going\" person. He criticized the fact that \"Yoh is a vessel for his ephemeral allies, but in reality they up end being a vessel for him, to the benefit of no one.\" Writing for Mania Entertainment, Eduardo Chavez commented that Yoh is \"such a laid back casual character\", and that \"Yoh's attitude to not go beyond his own abilities might be a little lazy\" but he thinks that is \"a smart approach to conserve mental and physical strength.\" Chris Beverdige also from Mania said Yoh is \"very much a laid back slacker.\" Alexander Hoffman of Comics Village declared \"in this first novel, letting the relationships between Yoh, Amidamaru, and Manta flesh out is more important that developing every spiritual entity that shows up.\" Active Anime's Holly Ellingwood praised the Yoh's \"much more idealistic and noble [position] than that of his rivals.\" A reviewer for \"The Star\" noted that while it was predictable that Yoh will meet other Shamans to become the Shaman King he noted it would be entertaining how the character will develop more powers. While reviewing the manga's twenty-second volume, Margaret Veira from Active Anime remarked the scenes in which Yoh starts feeling rage to the point she said \"you can feel the anger emanating from the page! It feels so real!\" In the book \"Summoning the Spirits: Possession and Invocation in Contemporary Religion\", author Andrew Dawson called Yoh the \"Japanese Shaman\" as he is not based on any religion unlike other characters appearing in the series despite noting some his relationship with the spirit of Amidamaru who is closed on Buddahood. Dawson also praised Yoh's character for being relatable with most of the readers of the series.\n"}
