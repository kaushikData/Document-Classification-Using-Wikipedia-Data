She was the author of over 60 books of spirituality and theology, and a mystic and stigmatist.\n\nAdrienne von Speyr was born in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. Her father, Theodor von Speyr, was an ophthalmologist. Her mother, Laure Girard, was the descendant of a family of noted watchmakers and jewelers from Geneva and Neuenburg. Speyr was her parents' second child. Her sister, Helen, was a year-and-a-half older. Her first brother, Wilhelm, who became a physician, was born in 1905 and died in 1978. Her second brother, Theodor, was born in 1913 and became the director of a bank in London for many years.\n\nSpeyr's mother scolded her daily, and this led her to form a strong trust and devotion to God, as well as a recognition of the meaning of sacrifice and renunciation. She formed a deep relationship with her grandmother, a holy and pious woman. She also had a devotion to her father, who treated her with mutual respect and understanding, often taking her with him to the hospital to visit sick children. In her primary school years she began working with the poor and even formed a society with her friends for those living in poverty.\n\nA very bright student, Speyr occasionally substituted for one of her teachers who suffered from asthma. It was in her religion classes that she began to sense the emptiness of the Protestantism that was being offered to her. At the age of nine she gave a talk to her classmates about the Jesuits, believing that an angel had told her \"that the Jesuits were people who loved Jesus totally, and that the truth of God was greater than that of men, and as a result one could not always tell people everything exactly as one understands it in God\". She later told Father von Balthasar that when she was six years old she had a mysterious encounter with St. Ignatius while walking up a steep street on Christmas Eve.\n\nIn her secondary school years, Speyr reproached her religious teacher for failing to discuss other religious beliefs, especially Catholic teachings.\n\nSpeyr was often sick and had constant backaches that forced her to lie down for long periods of time. She would always become ill before Easter; and explained that it was due to Good Friday. Despite her physical sufferings, she focused on helping others who were suffering, spending time comforting and encouraging hospital patients. Not surprisingly, at her secondary school she formed the intention of becoming a doctor, a decision supported by her father but not her mother. And after two years at the school, her mother was successful in having her removed from the school on the ground that it allowed her too much association with boys, and she then spent a year in an advanced girls’ school; although unhappy there, she also met her best friend, Madeleine Gallet. The two of them talked constantly about God, the spiritual life, and how they might convert their classmates.\n\nSpeyr's father permitted her to return to her former secondary school, where she was the only girl in her class and was very popular, due to her charm, sense of humor, and natural leadership. In November 1917 she experienced a mystical vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary surrounded by angels and saints; her later work would always be marked by a deeply Marian character.\n\nAround this same time, Speyr knew, she said, that her father would soon die. After his death (from a perforated stomach ulcer), she attended both business school and secondary school. In 1918 she suffered a total physical collapse brought on by tuberculosis in both lungs, and the doctors believed she would die within a year. She was sent to Leysin, where she was cared for by Charlotte Olivier, a doctor who was married to one of her relations. Meanwhile, her mother distanced herself even further from her. Speyr spent time learning and reading Russian. It was in Leysin–where she would often pray in a cold Catholic chapel–that she began to believe that she was being called to the Roman Catholic Church. After another physical collapse, she was able to return to school.\n\nHer mother arranged for a job and a possible husband, but Speyr resolved to be a doctor; this led to a lengthy period of silence between mother and daughter. She pursued her studies and an internship; in \"these and many other experiences\", noted Father von Balthasar, \"Adrienne learned to seek the God whom she had not yet succeeded in truly finding by the way of service to neighbor.\"\n\nIn the summer of 1927 Speyr met a history professor, Emil Dürr, a widower with two young sons. They married, and shortly after the wedding Adrienne passed her state boards to become a physician; she was the first woman in Switzerland to be admitted to the medical profession. Dürr died suddenly in 1934, and in 1936 the widowed Speyr married Werner Kaegi, an associate professor under Dürr who took over his Chair of History at the University of Basel.\n\nDuring the next few years Adrienne made several unsuccessful attempts to contact Catholic priests, to inform them of her desire to convert. In the fall of 1940 she was introduced to Father Hans Urs von Balthasar, a Jesuit priest recently appointed as the students' chaplain in Basel. She told him of her desire to become a Roman Catholic, and was baptized on 1 November 1940, the Feast of All Saints, when she was 38. Soon after, she was confirmed. Her family was initially shocked; it would take years for a reconciliation with them to take place.\n\nAdrienne proceeded to form friendships with many great Catholic thinkers, including Romano Guardini, Hugo Rahner, Erich Przywara, Henri de Lubac, Reinhold Schneider, Annette Kolb, and Gabriel Marcel. Meanwhile, her medical practice was very successful; she had as many as sixty to eighty patients a day.\n\nShe is considered by many to have been a mystic and is reputed to have had mystical experiences of the Trinity and the saints. Her reputed mystical experiences grew in frequency until her death.\n\nFr. von Balthasar wrote that shortly after her conversion \"a veritable cataract of mystical graces poured over Adrienne in a seemingly chaotic storm that whirled her in all directions at once. Graces in prayer above all: she was transported beyond all vocal prayer or self-directed meditation upon in order to be set down somewhere after an indeterminate time with new understanding, new love and new resolutions.\" This included \"an increasingly open and intimate association with Mary…\" Driving home one night shortly after her conversion, she saw a great light in front of the car and she heard a voice say: \"Tu vivras au ciel et sur la terre\" (You shall live in heaven and on earth). This was \"the key to all that was to follow\" in her life.\n\nThe years following 1940 were filled with much physical pain, including a heart attack, diabetes, severe arthritis, and eventually blindness; mystical experiences, including the stigmata; and a close relationship with Fr. von Balthasar, who became her spiritual director and confidant and with whom she co-founded a secular institute, the (Community of St. John). While in a state of contemplative, mystical prayer, she dictated to Fr. von Balthasar over sixty books, including commentaries on the Bible (the Johannine writings, some of St. Paul, the Catholic Epistles, the Apocalypse, and parts of the Old Testament) and various theological topics. Fr. von Balthasar wrote, \"She seldom dictated for more than half an hour per day. During vacations she would occasionally dictate for two or three hours, but this was rare.\" The result was some sixty books dictated between 1940 and 1953. \"Her spiritual productivity knew no limits,\" wrote Fr. von Balthasar, \"we could just as well have two or three times as many texts of hers today.\"\n\nBy 1954 she was so ill that she had to discontinue her medical practice. She spent hours each day in prayer, knitting clothing for the poor, and reading Bernanos and Mauriac, among other French authors. From her mid-fifties onward she was so ill that physicians wondered how she remained alive. In 1964 she went blind. Her last months were filled with \"continuous, merciless torture,\" said Fr. von Balthasar, \"which she bore with great equanimity, always concerned about the others and constantly apologetic about causing me so much trouble.\" She died in Basel, Switzerland on 17 September 1967, the Feast of St. Hildegard, who was also a mystic and physician.\n\nBalthasar wrote that the three characteristics of Speyr that were most striking were her joyousness, her courage, and her ability to remain a child, having a childlike clarity and wonder about her. In \"Our Task\" he provides this character sketch:.\n\nFrom \"How Does One Read Adrienne von Speyr?\" by Hans Urs von Balthasar:\n\nA different approach to her work is offered by her smaller, treatise-like works, which develop a special aspect of her theological vision. Before all others, the Handmaid of the Lord should be read, then works of smaller scope like the Gates of Eternal Life, The Immeasurable God, The Face of the Father, and similar ones. From this point, the more extensive works like The World of Prayer and Confession are more easily accessible.\n\nThe Jesuit Hans Urs von Balthasar said that most of his work was primarily inspired and translated from Speyr's \"experimentellen Dogmatik\" (experimental theology).\n\n\nWORKS:\n\n.

He has been accused of conspiring to persecute Muslims in Myanmar through his speeches, although he claims to be a peaceful preacher and not to have advocated violence—which is disputed by others. Facebook also banned his page on the charge of spreading religious hatred towards other communities, after repeated warnings to not post religiously inflammatory content.\n\nWirathu was born in 1968 near Mandalay. He left school at the age 14 to become a monk. In 2001, he became involved in the 969 Movement. Two years later, in 2003, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for his sermons, but was released in 2012 along with many other political prisoners. Since the government reforms of 2011, he has been especially active on YouTube and other forms of social media. Facebook banned his page on the charge of spreading religious hatred towards other communities, after repeated warnings to not post religiously inflammatory content. He has been warned by other social networking sites.\n\nWirathu led a rally of monks in Mandalay in September 2012 to promote President Thein Sein's controversial plan to send Burmese Rohingya Muslims to a third country. One month later, more violence broke out in Rakhine state. Wirathu claims the violence in Rakhine was the spark for the most recent violence in Myanmar's central city of Meiktila, where a dispute in a gold shop quickly spiraled into a looting-and-arson spree. More than 14 people were killed, after monasteries, shops and houses were burned down across the city. At least two people, including a Burmese Buddhist monk, Shin Thawbita, and a Muslim man were reportedly assaulted and tortured by mobs in Meikhtilar on 5 March.\n\nWirathu is mentioned on the cover story of \"Time\" magazine as \"The Face of Buddhist Terror\" on 20 June 2013. \"You can be full of kindness and love, but you cannot sleep next to a mad dog,\" Wirathu said, referring to Muslims. \"If we are weak,\" he said, \"our land will become Muslim.\" Referring to Muslim violence and domination in neighbouring nations and the example of the spread of Islam in Indonesia, Wirathu worries about a similar fate for Myanmar. Wirathu claims that his Muslim opponents labelled him the \"Burmese Bin Laden\" after the \"Time\" article incorrectly reported he described himself in this manner. He said he \"abhorred violence\" and \"opposes terrorism\". Wirathu has also expressed admiration for, and a desire to follow the example of, the English Defence League by \"protecting the public.\"\n\nThein Sein accused \"Time\" of slandering the Buddhist religion and harming the national reconciliation process by accusing the outspoken cleric of stoking anti-Muslim violence in Myanmar. Describing him as a \"son of Buddha\", the president defended Wirathu as a \"noble person\" committed to peace. \"The article in Time Magazine can cause misunderstanding about the Buddhist religion, which has existed for millennia and is followed by the majority of Burmese citizens,\" Thein Sein said. In an interview with DVB, Wirathu accused \"Time\" of committing a \"serious human rights violation\" by refusing to present his views in a verbatim question and answer format. \"Before I had heard [rumours] of the Arab world dominating the global media,\" he said, \"but this time, I've seen it for myself.\" Wirathu openly blamed Muslims for instigating the recent violence. Wirathu claimed that Myanmar's Muslims are being financed by Middle Eastern forces, saying, \"The local Muslims are crude and savage because the extremists are pulling the strings, providing them with financial, military and technical power\".\n\nOn 21 July 2013, he was the apparent target of a bomb explosion, but he remained unscathed. Five people were slightly injured in the blast, including a novice monk. Wirathu claimed that the bombing was an attempt by Muslim extremists to silence his voice.\n\nHe has called for restrictions on marriages between Buddhists and Muslims, and for boycotts of Muslim-owned businesses.\n\nHowever, not everyone from within his own faith agrees with his teachings. Abbot Arriya Wuttha Bewuntha of Mandalay's Myawaddy Sayadaw monastery denounced him, saying, \"He sides a little towards hate [and this was] not the way Buddha taught. What the Buddha taught is that hatred is not good, because Buddha sees everyone as an equal being. The Buddha doesn't see people through religion.\" Critics also explain what they see as his extremism as little more than due to ignorance, although his views do have influence in Myanmar where many businesses are \"run successfully by Muslims\".\n\nBurmese pro-democracy activist Maung Zarni also denounced Wirathu's 969 Movement for spreading hate speech and argued that EU countries should take the matter seriously as Myanmar is a \"major EU-aid recipient country\".\n\nIn September 2014, Wirathu attended a \"Great Sangha Conference\" in Colombo organised by Bodu Bala Sena. Wirathu said that his 969 Movement would work with the Bodu Bala Sena.\n\nIn January 2015 Wirathu publicly called United Nations envoy Yanghee Lee a \"bitch\" and a \"whore\" and invited her to \"offer your arse to the \"kalars\"\" (a derogatory term for Muslims).\n\nWirathu led a prayer and protest at the Mahamuni Buddha Temple in Mandalay on February 23, 2017, to condemn the Thai government's raid on the Wat Phra Dhammakaya in Bangkok.\n\nAyeyarwady Region's government banned Wirathu from preaching in the region on 10 March 2017.\n\n\n"}

The association was established in September 2010 with the claimed objective of having \"a forum, and a voice to reflect, discuss and comment on issues affecting the Irish Church and society today\". One of its founders was Fr Tony Flannery who, in April 2012, was disciplined by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith for questioning whether Jesus Christ had instituted the priesthood. His brother Frank Flannery is a former General Secretary of the Fine Gael party.\n\nThe ACP says that it accepts the Creed and that it does not seek to overturn the defined teaching of the Catholic Church but these are questionable claims given its attempts to undermine settled Church teaching on issues like adultery and contraception \nIn June 2014, the issue of vocations was discussed at the Irish Catholic Bishops Conference in Maynooth. The ACP called for the Church to have a plan for vocations. Father Sean McDonagh says that the Church is \"facing an implosion in terms of vocations to the priesthood.\". In this regard, the ACP advocates the appointment of female deacons. According to Fr.McDonagh: \"It’s fairly clear historically that women have served in the Church, despite every effort to silence their voices since the 4th century.\"\n\nThe ACP also called for men who left the priesthood to marry to be called back to ministry in some form. McDonagh claimed that if the ACP’s recommendations were not acted on, parish churches could be forced to close down.\n\nThe report of the Apostolic visitation to Ireland expressed some concerns about the \"communio\" (communion or unity) of the Church. The ACP claims \"We cherish and we value and we wish to further the unity of all our people, with our fellow clergy, with Religious, with our bishops and with the Successor of Peter.\"\n\nMembers of the association have been censured by the Roman Curia. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) placed restrictions on the association's founder, Fr Tony Flannery who is a member of the Redemptorist Congregation. He was advised by Rome to go to a monastery where he might \"pray and reflect\" on his heterodox views and his role with the association. His monthly column in the congregation's monthly magazine, \"Reality\", has been discontinued. Restrictions have also been imposed on the magazine itself and its editor, Fr Gerard Moloney.\n\nSupporters of the censure cite that the Vatican has \"a sacred obligation to investigate any religious whose teaching is contrary to that of the church: to defend those sacred teachings: and to protect the faithful from all taint of error and corruption.\" Other supporters advocate that those censured by the CDF are free to set up a rival church: \"Those with strong private theories and opinions have plenty of churches to choose from and, if they find none to their liking, they can always set up another.\nSince that time, it has emerged that three other priests have also been silenced: Marist priest Fr Seán Fagan, Capuchin priest Fr Owen O'Sullivan and Passionist priest Fr Brian D'Arcy.\n\nAt a conference organised by the ACP in Dublin's Regency Hotel, Fr Brendan Hoban told the gathering \"that clamping down on \"wayward\" opinions was not the way to deal with issues\".\n\nIts intervention in the case of Fr Kevin Reynolds, who was libelled in RTÉ's \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme – Mission to Prey – in May 2011 was instrumental is securing an apology from the broadcaster.\n\nIn April 2012 it published a survey that it commissioned which revealed that nine out of 10 of the 1,000 interviewed practising Catholics (35 per cent attend Mass once a week, 51 per cent once or more each month and 20 per cent a few times a year) said priests should be allowed to marry, with 77 per cent believing women should be ordained and three-quarters of respondents not seeing Catholic Church teachings on sexuality as relevant to them or to their family.\n\nOn 30 May 2012, a steering group under the umbrella of the ACP met in All Hallows College, Dublin. The meeting, was attended by about 200 people and resulted in the establishment of a new lay organisation for Irish Catholics with an interim title of the \"Association of Catholics in Ireland\". The new association committed itself to \"the renewal of the Catholic faith in the changed and changing circumstances of the 21st century and to the reform of the institutional church which, at this time, is experiencing conflict, crisis and lack of credibility\". In November 2012, at a meeting attended by over 300 people, the objectives of the Association of Catholics in Ireland were formally approved.\n\n\n"}

It concerns a controversial Buddhist reliquary from the Piprahwa Stupa in Uttar Pradesh, India. It was released in May, 2013, and was broadcast in July 2013 in the US on PBS as part of the \"Secrets of the Dead\" series.\n\nWriter and host Charles Allen investigates the Piprahwa Stupa, a large Buddhist Stupa which is argued to be one of the eight resting places of the Buddha's ashes. In 1898, estate manager and amateur archaeologist W.C. Peppé excavated the stupa, finding a large brick dome with a sarcophagus, or coffer, at the center. Inside were four vessels (three stoneware, one glass) along with about 1600 small jewels and gold pieces — the Piprahwa treasure — all of undetermined age. One of the stoneware vessels — the \"Piprahwa reliquary\" — contained jewels mixed with human ashes and bone. Peppé made the mistake of consulting Dr Alois Anton Führer — a German archaeologist who soon became notorious for forging other Buddhist relics — and the Piprahwa find, along with Peppé's own reputation, were soon irretrievably tainted with scandal and the \"Buddha's bones\" discredited in the professional archeological world. In presenting the background to the story, Allen visits the Buddhist sites of Kushinagar and Sanchi, as well as the old Peppé family manor house, now in a state of extreme neglect.\n\nAllen interviews Harry Falk (professor of Indology at the Freie Universität in Berlin and said to be the \"world's foremost expert\" in ancient Indian languages and history), who states that Führer could not have forged the Piprahwa reliquary inscription. This is, Falk says, because he lacked sufficient knowledge of the language (Prakrit) in which its inscription was written, and, more importantly, he could have never known the Sanskrit word \"nidhane\" (\"container\"), which is written on the reliquary, a \"hapax legomenon\" (unique example) in the entire corpus of Brahmi script. That said, however, it should be noted that Führer had taught Sanskrit for three years at St. Xavier's College, Bombay, and was one of the editors of Epigraphia Indica; that he had translated Sanskrit texts, and that \"nidhane\" occurs commonly enough in such Sanskrit textual sources.\n\nFalk concludes that the reliquary found at Piprahwa in 1898 did contain a portion of the ashes of the Buddha, and that the inscription is authentic. According to him, the inscription translates as \"these are the relics of the Buddha, the Lord\". The conclusion is that the Piprahwa Stupa was built by the Emperor Ashoka 150 years later in 245 BCE over the original and simpler interment site created by Shakya clansmen for the 1/8th of the Buddha's ashes they had been apportioned. Falk points to the close similarity of materials used at Piprahwa and its grand size with other Ashokan stupas, and that the coffer containing the reliquary found at Piprahwa closely reflects Ashokan workmanship, design, and the type of sandstone used for monuments like the Lumbini pillar erected during his reign. (In 1971, Indian archeologist K.S. Srivastava excavated deeper into the stupa than Peppé had, uncovering two chambers each containing a soapstone casket with redware fragments. This is taken as confirmation of the existence of an earlier, deeper burial site at Piprahwa dating back to the death of the Buddha.)\n\n"}

{"id": "760054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=760054", "title": "Cupid and Psyche", "text": "Cupid and Psyche\n\nCupid and Psyche is a story originally from \"Metamorphoses\" (also called \"The Golden Ass\"), written in the 2nd century AD by Lucius Apuleius Madaurensis (or Platonicus). The tale concerns the overcoming of obstacles to the love between Psyche (, , \"Soul\" or \"Breath of Life\") and Cupid (Latin \"Cupido,\" \"Desire\") or Amor (\"Love\", Greek Eros ’′Ερως), and their ultimate union in a sacred marriage. Although the only extended narrative from antiquity is that of Apuleius, Eros and Psyche appear in Greek art as early as the 4th century BC. The story's Neoplatonic elements and allusions to mystery religions accommodate multiple interpretations, and it has been analyzed as an allegory and in light of folktale, \"Märchen\" or fairy tale, and myth.\n\nSince the rediscovery of Apuleius's novel in the Renaissance, the reception of \"Cupid and Psyche\" in the classical tradition has been extensive. The story has been retold in poetry, drama, and opera, and depicted widely in painting, sculpture, and even wallpaper. Though Psyche is usually referred to in Roman mythology by her Greek name, her Roman name through direct translation is Anima\n\nThe tale of Cupid and Psyche (or \"Eros and Psyche\") is placed at the midpoint of Apuleius's novel, and occupies about a fifth of its total length. The novel itself is a first-person narrative by the protagonist Lucius. Transformed into a donkey by magic gone wrong, Lucius undergoes various trials and adventures, and finally regains human form by eating roses sacred to Isis. Psyche's story has some similarities, including the theme of dangerous curiosity, punishments and tests, and redemption through divine favor.\n\nAs a structural mirror of the overarching plot, the tale is an example of \"mise en abyme\". It occurs within a complex narrative frame, with Lucius recounting the tale as it in turn was told by an old woman to Charite, a bride kidnapped by pirates on her wedding day and held captive in a cave. The happy ending for Psyche is supposed to assuage Charite's fear of rape, in one of several instances of Apuleius's irony.\n\nAlthough the tale resists explication as a strict allegory of a particular Platonic argument, Apuleius drew generally on imagery such as the laborious ascent of the winged soul (\"Phaedrus\" 248) and the union with the divine achieved by Soul through the agency of the \"daimon\" Love (\"Symposium\" 212b).\n\nThere were once a king and queen, rulers of an unnamed city, who had three daughters of conspicuous beauty. The youngest and most beautiful was Psyche, whose admirers, neglecting the proper worship of the love goddess Venus, instead prayed and made offerings to her. It was rumored that she was the second coming of Venus, or the daughter of Venus from an unseemly union between the goddess and a mortal. Venus is offended, and commissions Cupid to work her revenge. Cupid is sent to shoot Psyche with an arrow so that she may fall in love with something hideous. He instead scratches himself with his own dart, which makes any living thing fall in love with the first thing it sees. Consequently, he falls deeply in love with Psyche and disobeys his mother's order. \n\nAlthough her two humanly beautiful sisters have married, the idolized Psyche has yet to find love. Her father suspects that they have incurred the wrath of the gods, and consults the oracle of Apollo. The response is unsettling: the king is to expect no human son-in-law, but rather a dragon-like creature who harasses the world with fire and iron and is feared by even Jupiter and the inhabitants of the underworld.\n\nPsyche is arrayed in funeral attire, conveyed by a procession to the peak of a rocky crag, and exposed. Marriage and death are merged into a single rite of passage, a \"transition to the unknown\". Zephyr the West Wind bears her up to meet her fated match, and deposits her in a lovely meadow \"(locus amoenus)\", where she promptly falls asleep.\n\nThe transported girl awakes to find herself at the edge of a cultivated grove \"(lucus)\". Exploring, she finds a marvelous house with golden columns, a carved ceiling of citrus wood and ivory, silver walls embossed with wild and domesticated animals, and jeweled mosaic floors. A disembodied voice tells her to make herself comfortable, and she is entertained at a feast that serves itself and by singing to an invisible lyre.\n\nAlthough fearful and without sexual experience, she allows herself to be guided to a bedroom, where in the darkness a being she cannot see makes her his wife. She gradually learns to look forward to his visits, though he always departs before sunrise and forbids her to look upon him, and soon she becomes pregnant.\n\nPsyche's family longs for news of her, and after much cajoling, Cupid, still unknown to his bride, permits Zephyr to carry her sisters up for a visit. When they see the splendor in which Psyche lives, they become envious, and undermine her happiness by prodding her to uncover her husband's true identity, since surely as foretold by the oracle she was lying with the vile winged serpent, who would devour her and her child.\nOne night after Cupid falls asleep, Psyche carries out the plan her sisters devised: she brings out a dagger and a lamp she had hidden in the room, in order to see and kill the monster. But when the light instead reveals the most beautiful creature she has ever seen, she is so startled that she wounds herself on one of the arrows in Cupid's cast-aside quiver. Struck with a feverish passion, she spills hot oil from the lamp and wakes him. He flees, and though she tries to pursue, he flies away and leaves her on the bank of a river.\n\nThere she is discovered by the wilderness god Pan, who recognizes the signs of passion upon her. She acknowledges his divinity \"(numen)\", then begins to wander the earth looking for her lost love.\n\nPsyche visits first one sister, then the other; both are seized with renewed envy upon learning the identity of Psyche's secret husband. Each sister attempts to offer herself as a replacement by climbing the rocky crag and casting herself upon Zephyr for conveyance, but instead is allowed to fall to a brutal death.\n\nIn the course of her wanderings, Psyche comes upon a temple of Ceres, and inside finds a disorder of grain offerings, garlands, and agricultural implements. Recognizing that the proper cultivation of the gods should not be neglected, she puts everything in good order, prompting a theophany of Ceres herself. Although Psyche prays for her aid, and Ceres acknowledges that she deserves it, the goddess is prohibited from helping her against a fellow goddess. A similar incident occurs at a temple of Juno. Psyche realizes that she must serve Venus herself.\n\nVenus revels in having the girl under her power, and turns Psyche over to her two handmaids, Worry and Sadness, to be whipped and tortured. Venus tears her clothes and bashes her head into the ground, and mocks her for conceiving a child in a sham marriage. The goddess then throws before her a great mass of mixed wheat, barley, poppyseed, chickpeas, lentils, and beans, demanding that she sort them into separate heaps by dawn. But when Venus withdraws to attend a wedding feast, a kind ant takes pity on Psyche, and assembles a fleet of insects to accomplish the task. Venus is furious when she returns drunk from the feast, and only tosses Psyche a crust of bread. At this point in the story, it is revealed that Cupid is also in the house of Venus, languishing from his injury.\nAt dawn, Venus sets a second task for Psyche. She is to cross a river and fetch golden wool from violent sheep who graze on the other side. These sheep are elsewhere identified as belonging to the Sun. Psyche's only intention is to drown herself on the way, but instead she is saved by instructions from a divinely inspired reed, of the type used to make musical instruments, and gathers the wool caught on briers.\n\nFor Psyche's third task, she is given a crystal vessel in which to collect the black water spewed by the source of the rivers Styx and Cocytus. Climbing the cliff from which it issues, she is daunted by the foreboding air of the place and dragons slithering through the rocks, and falls into despair. Jupiter himself takes pity on her, and sends his eagle to battle the dragons and retrieve the water for her.\n\nThe last trial Venus imposes on Psyche is a quest to the underworld itself. She is to take a box \"(pyxis)\" and obtain in it a dose of the beauty of Proserpina, queen of the underworld. Venus claims her own beauty has faded through tending her ailing son, and she needs this remedy in order to attend the theatre of the gods \"(theatrum deorum)\".\nOnce again despairing of her task, Psyche climbs a tower, planning to throw herself off. The tower, however, suddenly breaks into speech, and advises her to travel to Lacedaemon, Greece, and to seek out the place called Taenarus, where she will find the entrance to the underworld. The tower offers instructions for navigating the underworld:\n\nThe airway of Dis is there, and through the yawning gates the pathless route is revealed. Once you cross the threshold, you are committed to the unswerving course that takes you to the very Regia of Orcus. But you shouldn’t go emptyhanded through the shadows past this point, but rather carry cakes of honeyed barley in both hands, and transport two coins in your mouth.\nThe speaking tower warns her to maintain silence as she passes by several ominous figures: a lame man driving a mule loaded with sticks, a dead man swimming in the river that separates the world of the living from the world of the dead, and old women weaving. These, the tower warns, will seek to divert her by pleading for her help: she must ignore them. The cakes are treats for distracting Cerberus, the three-headed watchdog of Orcus, and the two coins for Charon the ferryman, so she can make a return trip.\n\nEverything comes to pass according to plan, and Proserpina grants Psyche's humble entreaty. As soon as she reenters the light of day, however, Psyche is overcome by a bold curiosity, and can't resist opening the box in the hope of enhancing her own beauty. She finds nothing inside but an \"infernal and Stygian sleep,\" which sends her into a deep and unmoving torpor.\n\nMeanwhile, Cupid's wound has healed into a scar, and he escapes his mother's house by flying out a window. When he finds Psyche, he draws the sleep from her face and replaces it in the box, then pricks her with an arrow that does no harm. He lifts her into the air, and takes her to present the box to Venus.\n\nHe then takes his case to Jupiter, who gives his consent in return for Cupid's future help whenever a choice maiden catches his eye. Jupiter has Mercury convene an assembly of the gods in the theater of heaven, where he makes a public statement of approval, warns Venus to back off, and gives Psyche ambrosia, the drink of immortality, so the couple can be united in marriage as equals. Their union, he says, will redeem Cupid from his history of provoking adultery and sordid liaisons. Jupiter's word is solemnized with a wedding banquet.\n\nWith its happy marriage and resolution of conflicts, the tale ends in the manner of classic comedy or Greek romances such as \"Daphnis and Chloe\". The child born to the couple will be Voluptas (Greek Hedone ‘Ηδονή), \"Pleasure.\"\n\nThe assembly of the gods has been a popular subject for both visual and performing arts, with the wedding banquet of Cupid and Psyche a particularly rich occasion. With the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, this is the most common setting for a \"Feast of the Gods\" scene in art. Apuleius describes the scene in terms of a festive Roman dinner party \"(cena)\". Cupid, now a husband, reclines in the place of honor (the \"top\" couch) and embraces Psyche in his lap. Jupiter and Juno situate themselves likewise, and all the other gods are arranged in order. The cupbearer of Jove (Jupiter's other name) serves him with nectar, the \"wine of the gods\"; Apuleius refers to the cupbearer only as \"ille rusticus puer\", \"that country boy,\" and not as Ganymede. Liber, the Roman god of wine, serves the rest of the company. Vulcan, the god of fire, cooks the food; the Horae (\"Seasons\" or \"Hours\") adorn, or more literally \"empurple,\" everything with roses and other flowers; the Graces suffuse the setting with the scent of balsam, and the Muses with melodic singing. Apollo sings to his lyre, and Venus takes the starring role in dancing at the wedding, with the Muses as her chorus girls, a satyr blowing the aulos \"(tibia\" in Latin), and a young Pan expressing himself through the pan pipes \"(fistula)\".\n\nThe wedding provides closure for the narrative structure as well as for the love story: the mysteriously provided pleasures Psyche enjoyed in the \"domus\" of Cupid at the beginning of her odyssey, when she entered into a false marriage preceded by funereal rites, are reimagined in the hall of the gods following correct ritual procedure for a real marriage. The arranging of the gods in their proper order \"(in ordinem)\" would evoke for the Roman audience the religious ceremony of the \"lectisternium\", a public banquet held for the major deities in the form of statues arranged on luxurious couches, as if they were present and participating in the meal.\nThe wedding banquet was a favored theme for Renaissance art. As early as 1497, Giovanni Sabadino degli Arienti made the banquet central to his now-lost Cupid and Psyche cycle at the Villa Belriguardo, near Ferrara. At the Villa Farnesina in Rome, it is one of two main scenes for the Loggia di Psiche (ca. 1518) by Raphael and his workshop, as well as for the Stanza di Psiche (1545–46) by Perino del Vaga at the Castel Sant' Angelo. Hendrick Goltzius introduced the subject to northern Europe with his \"enormous\" engraving called \"The Wedding of Cupid and Psyche\" (1587, 43 by 85.4 cm), which influenced how other northern artists depicted assemblies of the gods in general. The engraving in turn had been taken from Bartholomaeus Spranger's 1585 drawing of the same title, considered a \"\"locus classicus\" of Dutch Mannerism\" and discussed by Karel Van Mander for its exemplary composition involving numerous figures.\n\nIn the 18th century, François Boucher's \"Marriage of Cupid and Psyche\" (1744) affirmed Enlightenment ideals with the authority figure Jupiter presiding over a marriage of lovely equals. The painting reflects the Rococo taste for pastels, fluid delicacy, and amorous scenarios infused with youth and beauty.\n\nThe story of Cupid and Psyche was readily allegorized. In late antiquity, Martianus Capella (5th century) refashions it as an allegory about the fall of the human soul. For Apuleius, immortality is granted to the soul of Psyche as a reward for commitment to sexual love. In the version of Martianus, sexual love draws Psyche into the material world that is subject to death: \"Cupid takes Psyche from Virtue and shackles her in adamantine chains\".\n\nThe tale thus lent itself to adaptation in a Christian or mystical context. In the Gnostic text \"On the Origin of the World\", the first rose is created from the blood of Psyche when she loses her virginity to Cupid. To the Christian mythographer Fulgentius (6th century), Psyche was an Adam figure, driven by sinful curiosity and lust from the paradise of Love's domain. Psyche's sisters are Flesh and Free Will, and her parents are God and Matter. To Boccaccio (14th century), the marriage of Cupid and Psyche symbolized the union of soul and God.\n\nApuleius's novel was among the ancient texts that made the crucial transition from roll to codex form when it was edited at the end of the late 4th century. It was known to Latin writers such as Augustine of Hippo, Macrobius, Sidonius Apollinaris, Martianus Capella, and Fulgentius, but toward the end of the 6th century lapsed into obscurity and survived what was formerly known as the \"Dark Ages\" through perhaps a single manuscript. The \"Metamorphoses\" remained unknown in the 13th century, but copies had begun to circulate in the mid-1300s among the early humanists in Florence. Boccaccio's text and interpretation of \"Cupid and Psyche\" in his \"Genealogia deorum gentilium\" (written in the 1370s and published 1472) was a major impetus to the reception of the tale in the Italian Renaissance and to its dissemination throughout Europe.\n\nOne of the most popular images from the tale was Psyche's discovery of a naked Cupid sleeping, found in ceramics, stained glass, and frescos. Mannerist painters were intensely drawn to the scene. In England, the Cupid and Psyche theme had its \"most lustrous period\" from 1566 to 1635, beginning with the first English translation by William Adlington. A fresco cycle for Hill Hall, Essex, was modeled indirectly after that of the Villa Farnesina around 1570, and Thomas Heywood's masque \"Love's Mistress\" dramatized the tale to celebrate the wedding of Charles I and Henrietta Maria, who later had her withdrawing chamber decorated with a 22-painting \"Cupid and Psyche\" cycle by Jacob Jordaens. The cycle took the divinization of Psyche as the centerpiece of the ceiling, and was a vehicle for the Neoplatonism the queen brought with her from France. The \"Cupid and Psyche\" produced by Orazio Gentileschi for the royal couple shows a fully robed Psyche whose compelling interest is psychological, while Cupid is mostly nude.\nAnother peak of interest in \"Cupid and Psyche\" occurred in the Paris of the late 1790s and early 1800s, reflected in a proliferation of opera, ballet, Salon art, deluxe book editions, interior decoration such as clocks and wall paneling, and even hairstyles. In the aftermath of the French Revolution, the myth became a vehicle for the refashioning of the self. In English intellectual and artistic circles around the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, the fashion for \"Cupid and Psyche\" accompanied a fascination for the ancient mystery religions. In writing about the Portland Vase, which was obtained by the British Museum around 1810, Erasmus Darwin speculated that the myth of Cupid and Psyche was part of the Eleusinian cycle. With his interest in natural philosophy, Darwin saw the butterfly as an apt emblem of the soul because it began as an earthbound caterpillar, \"died\" into the pupal stage, and was then resurrected as a beautiful winged creature.\n\nIn 1491, the poet Niccolò da Correggio retold the story with Cupid as the narrator. John Milton alludes to the story at the conclusion of \"Comus\" (1634), attributing not one but two children to the couple: Youth and Joy. Shackerley Marmion wrote a verse version called \"Cupid and Psyche\" (1637), and La Fontaine a mixed prose and verse romance (1699).\n\nWilliam Blake's mythology draws on elements of the tale particularly in the figures of Luvah and Vala. Luvah takes on the various guises of Apuleius's Cupid: beautiful and winged; disembodied voice; and serpent. Blake, who mentions his admiration for Apuleius in his notes, combines the myth with the spiritual quest expressed through the eroticism of the Song of Solomon, with Solomon and the Shulamite as a parallel couple.\nMary Tighe published her poem \"Psyche\" in 1805. She added some details to the story, such placing two springs in Venus' garden, one with sweet water and one with bitter. When Cupid starts to obey his mother's command, he brings some of both to a sleeping Psyche, but places only the bitter water on Psyche's lips. Tighe's Venus only asks one task of Psyche, to bring her the forbidden water, but in performing this task Psyche wanders into a country bordering on Spenser's \"Fairie Queene\" as Psyche is aided by a mysterious visored knight and his squire Constance, and must escape various traps set by Vanity, Flattery, Ambition, Credulity, Disfida (who lives in a \"Gothic castle\"), Varia and Geloso. Spenser's Blatant Beast also makes an appearance. Tighe's work influenced English lyric poetry on the theme, including two poems by William Wordsworth called \"To a Butterfly,\" and the \"Ode to Psyche\" (1820) by John Keats. Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poem \"Cupid and Psyche\" (1826) illustrates an engraving of a painting by W. E. West.\n\nWilliam Morris retold the Cupid and Psyche story in verse in \"The Earthly Paradise\" (1868–70), and a chapter in Walter Pater's \"Marius the Epicurean\" (1885) was a prose translation. About the same time, Robert Bridges wrote \"Eros and Psyche: A Narrative Poem in Twelve Measures\" (1885; 1894).\n\nSylvia Townsend Warner transferred the story to Victorian England in her novel \"The True Heart\" (1929), though few readers made the connection till she pointed it out herself. Other literary adaptations include \"The Robber Bridegroom\" (1942), a novella by Eudora Welty; \"Till We Have Faces\" (1956), a version by C.S. Lewis narrated by a sister of Psyche; and the poem \"Psyche: 'Love drove her to Hell'\" by H.D. (Hilda Doolittle). Robert A. Johnson made use of the story in his book \"She: Understanding Feminine Psychology\", published in 1976 by HarperCollinsPublishers.\n\nWilliam Adlington made the first translation into English of Apuleius's \"Metamorphoses\" in 1566, under the title \"\". Adlington seems not to have been interested in a Neoplatonic reading, but his translation consistently suppresses the sensuality of the original. Thomas Taylor published an influential translation of \"Cupid and Psyche\" in 1795, several years before his complete \"Metamorphoses\". A translation by Robert Graves appeared in 1951 as \"The Transformations of Lucius Otherwise Known as THE GOLDEN ASS, A New Translation by Robert Graves from Apuleius\", published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux, New York.\n\nBruno Bettelheim notes in \"The Uses of Enchantment\" that the 18th-century fairy tale \"Beauty and the Beast\" is a version of \"Cupid and Psyche\". Motifs from Apuleius occur in several fairy tales, including \"Cinderella\" and \"Rumpelstiltskin\", in versions collected by folklorists trained in the classical tradition, such as Charles Perrault and the Grimm brothers. In the Grimm version, Cinderella is given the task of sorting lentils and peas from ash, and is aided by birds just as ants help Psyche in the sorting of grain and legumes imposed on her by Venus. Like Cinderella, Psyche has two envious sisters who compete with her for the most desirable male. Cinderella's sisters mutilate their own feet to emulate her, while Psyche's are dashed to death on a rocky cliff. In Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Little Mermaid\", the Little Mermaid is given a dagger by her sisters, who, in an attempt to end all the suffering she endured and to let her become a mermaid again, attempt to persuade her to use it to slay the Prince while he is asleep with his new bride. She cannot bring herself to kill the Prince, however. Unlike Psyche, who becomes immortal, she doesn't receive his love in return, but she, nevertheless, ultimately earns the eternal soul she yearns for.\n\nThomas Bulfinch wrote a shorter adaptation of the Cupid and Psyche tale for his \"Age of Fable\", borrowing Tighe's invention of Cupid's self-wounding, which did not appear in the original. Josephine Preston Peabody wrote a version for children in her \"Old Greek Folk Stories Told Anew\" (1897).\n\nC.S. Lewis' \"Till We Have Faces\" is a retelling of Apuleius' \"Cupid and Psyche\" from the perspective of one of Psyche's sisters. \"Till We Have Faces\" is C.S. Lewis' last work of fiction and elaborates on Apuleius' story in a modern way.\n\nIn 1634, Thomas Heywood turned the tale of Cupid and Psyche into a masque for the court of Charles I. Lully's \"Psyché\" (1678) is a Baroque French opera (a \"tragédie lyrique\") based on the 1671 play by Molière, which had musical \"intermèdes\" by Lully. Matthew Locke's semi-opera \"Psyche\" (1675) is a loose reworking from the 1671 production. In 1800, Ludwig Abeille premièred his four-act German opera \"(singspiel)\" \"Amor und Psyche\", with a libretto by Franz Carl Hiemer based on Apuleius.\nIn the 19th century, \"Cupid and Psyche\" was a source for \"transformations,\" visual interludes involving \"tableaux vivants\", transparencies and stage machinery that were presented between the scenes of a pantomime but extraneous to the plot. During the 1890s, when \"tableaux vivants\" or \"living pictures\" were in vogue as a part of vaudeville, the 1889 \"Psyché et l'Amour\" of Bouguereau was among the artworks staged. To create these \"tableaux\", costumed performers \"froze\" in poses before a background copied meticulously from the original and enlarged within a giant picture frame. Nudity was feigned by flesh-colored bodystockings that negotiated standards of realism, good taste, and morality. Claims of educational and artistic value allowed female nudes—a popular attraction—to evade censorship. \"Psyché et l'Amour\" was reproduced by the scenic painter Edouard von Kilanyi, who made a tour of Europe and the United States beginning in 1892, and by George Gordon in an Australian production that began its run in December 1894. The illusion of flight was so difficult to sustain that this \"tableau\" was necessarily brief. The performer billed as \"The Modern Milo\" during this period specialized in recreating female sculptures, a \"Psyche\" in addition to her namesake \"Venus de Milo\".\n\nFrederick Ashton choreographed a ballet \"Cupid and Psyche\" with music by Lord Berners and decor by Sir Francis Rose, first performed on 27 April 1939 by the Sadler's Wells Ballet (now Royal Ballet). Frank Staff danced as Cupid, Julia Farron as Psyche, Michael Somes as Pan, and June Brae as Venus.\n\nPlaywright Emily C. A. Snyder's five-act iambic pentameter version of Cupid and Psyche ~ A New Play in Blank Verse, produced by Turn to Flesh Productions, which premiered at The Barrow Group Theatre in New York City on Valentine's 2014, explores the nature of Lust unbounded and then transformed. The play incorporates both Elizabethan iambic pentameter verse (for the gods), as well as Molière rhyming couplets (for the lovers), with sections of prose (for some mortals.) The play takes a feminist approach in diverging from the original myth, giving Psyche more agency.\n\nViewed in terms of psychology rather than allegory, the tale of Cupid and Psyche shows how \"a mutable person … matures within the social constructs of family and marriage\". In the Jungian allegory of Erich Neumann (1956), the story of Psyche was interpreted as \"the psychic development of the feminine\".\n\n\"Cupid and Psyche\" has been analyzed from a feminist perspective as a paradigm of how the gender unity of women is disintegrated through rivalry and envy, replacing the bonds of sisterhood with an ideal of heterosexual love. This theme was explored in \"Psyche's Sisters: Reimagining the Meaning of Sisterhood\" (1988) by Christine Downing, who uses myth as a medium for psychology.\n\nJames Hillman made the story the basis for his critique of scientific psychology, \"The Myth of Analysis: Three Essays in Archetypal Psychology\" (1983). Carol Gilligan uses the story as the basis for much of her analysis of love and relationships in \"The Birth of Pleasure\" (Knopf, 2002).\n\nThe story of Cupid and Psyche is depicted in a wide range of visual media. Psyche is often represented with butterfly wings, and the butterfly is her frequent attribute and a symbol of the soul, though the literary \"Cupid and Psyche\" never says that she has or acquires wings. In antiquity, an iconographical tradition existed independently of Apuleius's tale and influenced later depictions.\n\nSome extant examples suggest that in antiquity Cupid and Psyche could have a religious or mystical meaning. Rings bearing their likeness, several of which come from Roman Britain, may have served an amuletic purpose. Engraved gems from Britain represent spiritual torment with the image of Cupid torching a butterfly. The two are also depicted in high relief in mass-produced Roman domestic plaster wares from 1st-2nd centuries AD found in excavations at Greco-Bactrian merchant settlements on the ancient Silk Road at Begram in Afghanistan (see gallery below). The allegorical pairing depicts perfection of human love in integrated embrace of body and soul ('psyche' Greek for butterfly symbol for transcendent immortal life after death). On sarcophagi, the couple often seem to represent an allegory of love overcoming death.\n\nA relief of Cupid and Psyche was displayed at the mithraeum of Capua, but it is unclear whether it expresses a Mithraic quest for salvation, or was simply a subject that appealed to an individual for other reasons. Psyche is invoked with \"Providence\" \"(Pronoia)\" at the beginning of the so-called Mithras Liturgy.\n\nIn late antiquity, the couple are often shown in a \"chin-chuck\" embrace, a gesture of \"erotic communion\" with a long history. The rediscovery of freestanding sculptures of the couple influenced several significant works of the modern era.\n\nOther depictions surviving from antiquity include a 2nd-century papyrus illustration possibly of the tale, and a ceiling fresco at Trier executed during the reign of Constantine I.\n\nWorks of art proliferated after the rediscovery of Apuleius's text, in conjunction with the influence of classical sculpture. In the mid-15th century, Cupid and Psyche became a popular subject for Italian wedding chests \"(cassoni)\", particularly those of the Medici. The choice was most likely prompted by Boccaccio's Christianized allegory. The earliest of these \"cassoni\", dated variously to the years 1444–1470, pictures the narrative in two parts: from Psyche's conception to her abandonment by Cupid; and her wanderings and the happy ending. With the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, the subject was the most common choice for specifying paintings of the Feast of the Gods, which were popular from the Renaissance to Northern Mannerism.\n\n\"Cupid and Psyche\" is a rich source for scenarios, and several artists have produced cycles of works based on it, including the frescoes at the Villa Farnesina (ca. 1518) by Raphael and his workshop; frescoes at Palazzo del Tè (1527–28) by Giulio Romano; engravings by the \"Master of the Die\" (mid-16th century); and paintings by the Pre-Raphaelite Edward Burne-Jones (in the 1870s–90s). Burne-Jones also executed a series of 47 drawings intended as illustrations for Morris's poem. \"Cupid and Psyche\" was the subject of the only cycle of prints created by the German Symbolist Max Klinger (1857–1920) to illustrate a specific story.\n\nThe special interest in the wedding as a subject in Northern Mannerism seems to spring from a large engraving of 1587 by Hendrik Goltzius in Haarlem of a drawing by Bartholomeus Spranger (now Rijksmuseum) that Karel van Mander had brought back from Prague, where Spranger was court painter to Rudolf II. \"The Feast of the Gods at the Marriage of Cupid and Psyche\" was so large, at 16 7/8 x 33 5/8 in. (43 x 85.4 cm), that it was printed from three different plates. Over 80 figures are shown, placed up in the clouds over a world landscape that can be glimpsed below. The composition borrows from both Raphael and Giulio Romano's versions.\n\nThe most popular subjects for single paintings or sculpture are the couple alone, or explorations of the figure of Psyche, who is sometimes depicted in compositions that recall the sleeping Ariadne as she was found by Dionysus. The use of nudity or sexuality in portraying Cupid and Psyche sometimes has offended contemporary sensibilities. In the 1840s, the National Academy of Art banned William Page's \"Cupid and Psyche\", called perhaps \"the most erotic painting in nineteenth-century America\". Classical subject matter might be presented in terms of realistic nudity: in 1867, the female figure in the \"Cupid and Psyche\" of Alphonse Legros was criticized as a \"commonplace naked young woman\". But during the same period, Cupid and Psyche were also portrayed chastely, as in the pastoral sculptures \"Psyche\" (1845) by Townsend and \"Cupid and Psyche\" (1846) by Thomas Uwins, which were purchased by Queen Victoria and her consort Albert, otherwise keen collectors of nudes in the 1840s and 50s.\n\nPortrayals of Psyche alone are often not confined to illustrating a scene from Apuleius, but may draw on the broader Platonic tradition in which Love was a force that shaped the self. The \"Psyche Abandoned\" of Jacques-Louis David, probably based on La Fontaine's version of the tale, depicts the moment when Psyche, having violated the taboo of looking upon her lover, is abandoned alone on a rock, her nakedness expressing dispossession and the color palette a psychological \"divestment\". The work has been seen as an \"emotional proxy\" for the artist's own isolation and desperation during his imprisonment, which resulted from his participation in the French Revolution and association with Robespierre.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28714269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28714269", "title": "Daesun Jinrihoe", "text": "Daesun Jinrihoe\n\nDaesun Jinrihoe (), which in its English-language publications has recently used the transliteration Daesoonjinrihoe and, from 2017, Daesoon Jinrihoe, is a Korean new religious movement, founded in April 1969 by Park Han-gyeong, known to his followers as Park Wudang (박한경) (1917–96, or 1917-95 according to the lunar calendar used by the movement). Daesoon thought is said to be a comprehensive system of truth representing the Great Dao of \"resolution of grievances and reciprocation of gratitude into mutual beneficence\".\n\nDaesoon Jinrihoe is the largest among more than one hundred different Korean religious movements constituting the group of new religions known as Jeungsanism and originating from the activities of Kang Jeungsan (Gang Il-Sun, 1871-1909), believed by his followers to be the incarnated Supreme God. After Kang’s death in 1909, each of his main disciples, and some of his relatives, went on to establish different new religions, which in turn splintered and fragmented into rival groups, of which today the most active outside Korea is Jeung San Do, which was founded in 1974. The rival group Jeung San Do is better known internationally, but less widely followed within Korea, while Daesoon Jinrihoe has concentrated its activities in Korea.\n\nParadoxically, the largest branch did not originate from a direct disciple of Kang. Jo Cheol-Je, known to his disciples as Jo Jeongsan (1895-1958), never personally met Kang, but claimed to have received a revelation from him in 1917. Eventually, he was recognized as the mysterious successor Kang had announced in his prophecies by Kang’s sister (Seondol, ca. 1881-1942), mother (Kwon, 1850-1926) and daughter (Sun-Im, 1904-1959), although the daughter eventually founded her own separate branch. Jo Jeongsan's followers claim that, in 1909, Kang saw a train passing, which had the young Jo Jeongsan aboard, and stated: “A man can do anything at the age of 15 if he is able to take his identification tag (\"hopae\") with him.” Jo Jeongsan's disciples later claimed that these words amounted to an endorsement by Kang of Jo Jeongsan as his successor.\nJo gathered a sizable number of followers and established land-reclaiming projects in the Anmyeondo and Wonsando Islands, aimed at improving the situation of his disciples. In 1925, he legally incorporated his religious order, Mugeukdo, in Jeongeup. Korea, however, was under Japanese occupation and, due to Japan’s hostility to new religions Jo decided to disband Mugeukdo in 1941. After World War II, Japanese left Korea, and in 1948 Jo was able to reconstitute the order, changing its name into Taegeukdo in 1950. New headquarters were established in Busan, initially in the center of the city. Later, due to the new zoning regulations introduced in Busan, the headquarters were relocated to the suburb that came to be called Taegeukdo Village.\n\nJo passed away on March 6, 1958. Initially, almost all his followers accepted that he had designated as his successor Park Han-Gyeong, later known as Park Wudang (1917-1996, or 1917-95 according to the lunar calendar used by the movement), a schoolteacher who had joined the movement after World War II, after having being forced to join the Japanese army, and Taegeukdo continued as a united movement under Park for ten years, between 1958 and 1968. In 1968, a movement criticizing Park was led by one of Jo Jeongsan’s sons, Jo Yongnae (1934-2004). Eventually, the two factions parted company. Jo Yongnae’s followers kept the name Taegeukdo and the headquarters at the Taegeukdo Village, while Park incorporated in 1969 a new religious order under the name Daesoon Jinrihoe, with headquarters at the Junggok Temple in Junggok-dong in Seoul. Besides the faction of Taegeukdo led by Jo Yongnae and the followers of Park, who eventually became part of Daesoon Jinrihoe, a third group should be mentioned. It included those members of Taegeukdo who tried to promote a reconciliation between the two factions and called for a return of Park to Taegeukdo Village. Those in this third group formed in August 1969 an association called “Taegeukdo-jeongsin-hoe\" (Taegeukdo Spirit Association), which changed its name into “Taegeuk Jinrihoe” in March 1971. In (or around) 1972, Taegeuk Jinrihoe was dissolved by its members, who decided to join Daesoon Jinrihoe.\n\nUnder Park’s guidance, Daesoon Jinrihoe had a spectacular success. According to some accounts, it became the largest new religion in Korea. In 1986, a large new temple was inaugurated in Yeoju, followed in 1991 by Daejin University and later by other temples. In 1993, the movement’s headquarters were moved to the Yeoju Temple.\n\nPark had not named a successor and passed away in 1996 (1995 according to the lunar calendar). Many of his followers had believed that they would achieve the state of \"dotong\", or perfect unification with the Tao, during Park's lifetime. They strongly opposed the idea of appointing a successor of Park, and controversies followed. However, the main reason for the disputes, which had also motivations preceding Park Wudang’s death, so that some divisions had already manifested during his last years, was a controversy about the divinization of Park Wudang (i.e. whether he should now be worshipped as a god or identified with Buddha Maitreya), together with Kang Jeungsan and Jo Jeongsan, who had been in turn divinized. Those favorable to the divinization were led by Yi Yu-jong (1936-2010), the chairperson of the Yeoju Headquarters Temple Complex, who was also accused of administrative wrongdoings by his opponents. On July 16, 1999, a number of leaders of the faction opposed to Yi (estimates vary from 150 to 1,500 or 2,000) gathered at the headquarters in Yeoju and asked Yi to resign. A face-off erupted and the police was called, which finally escorted Yi out of the temple. The police had to intervene again in January 2000, when Yi's faction unsuccessfully tried to retake the Yeoju Headquarters. Yi's followers managed however to take control of Daesoon Jinrihoe's Junggok Temple in Seoul, where Yi proclaimed himself the successor of Park, while the majority group insisted that Park had appointed no successor and organized a collegial direction of the movement.\n\nEventually, Yi's group experienced in turn further schisms, and Daesoon Jinrihoe split into at least five factions: one, including a large majority of Park’s followers, was opposed to his deification and remained headquartered in Yeoju, while the four main groups that were in favor of considering Park either a god or the Buddha Maitreya were headquartered respectively at the Junggok Temple in Seoul, in Pocheon, Pohang, and Goesan. The latter branch is now known as Daejin Sungjuhoe. In 2013, a council was held in Yeoju to \"normalize\" the management of the order, attended by the Yeoju Headquarters, Seoul's Junggok Temple, and Pocheon branches. They did not come to an agreement about their doctrinal problems, but agreed to a joint management of Daejin University and of Jesaeng Hospital, one of the main components of Daesoon Jinrihoe’s health system.\n\nThese internal problems did not seem to stop the expansion of the movement. In 1997, a giant Maitreya Buddha statue was enshrined in the Geumgangsan Toseong Training Temple, which had been completed in 1996 in the Geumgang Mountain area, where Park Wudang was also buried. The educational and health systems also expanded. The movement also developed a distinctive approach to visual arts in the decoration of its temples and production of sacred paintings, combining traditional Korean Buddhist themes and folk art.\n\nThe doctrine of Daesoon Jinrihoe is based on a sacred history. While the world was in a miserable situation, the Catholic missionary priest Matteo Ricci attempted the solution of the problems through the spreading of Christianity and the construction of an earthly paradise in China. Because of the corrupted situation of Confucianism, Ricci failed, but his mission opened a door through which the Divine Spirits of the East could travel to the West. This was largely responsible for the scientific and cultural progress of the West. Eventually, however, both East and West succumbed to materialism, greed, and wars.\n\nAs a consequence, all divine spirits petitioned Sangje, the Supreme God, to intervene directly. Sangje undertook a “Great Itineration,” where he reordered the three kingdoms of Heaven, Earth, and Human Beings. He descended to the West, from where he moved East and came to Korea, where he stayed for thirty years in the giant Buddha Maitreya statue in the Maitreya Hall of the Geumsansa Temple. During this time, he revealed his divine teachings and plans for a heavenly order to Choe Je-u, the founder of Donghak. Choe’s mission, just as Ricci’s centuries before, failed because of the resistance of the Confucian system. Sangje then withdrew his heavenly mandate from Choe (who was executed in 1864) and in 1871 incarnated as Kang Jeungsan.\n\nDaesoon Jinrihoe followers, thus, believe that Kang Jeungsan (Gang Il-Sun) was Sangje, or the Supreme God, in human form. Sangje descended to earth and assumed human form at the end of 19th century in order to renew human beings and build an Earthly Paradise through his \"Chenji-gongsa\"(Reordering Works of the Universe).[. To achieve this aim, a religious organization was also needed, and Daesoon Jinrihoe believes it was created through the succession in the religious orthodoxy first by Jo Jeongsan and then by Park Wudang.\n\nDaesoon Jinrihoe articulates its doctrine in four tenets, which are “virtuous concordance of yin and yang,” “harmonious union between divine beings and human beings,” “resolution of grievances for mutual beneficence” and “perfected Unification with Dao.” These four tenets are believed to contain within themselves all the teachings of Sangje. Some scholars believe that the third tenet, “resolution of grievances for mutual beneficence” (\"Haewon sangsaeng\", 解冤相生) is the most distinctive teaching of Daesoon Jinrihoe. It teaches that, while Kang Jeungsan opened the road to solving the problem of grievances, humans should do their part by “cultivating” themselves, propagating the truth, and avoiding the creation of new grievances. The itinerary of “cultivation” is depicted in Daesoon Jinrihoe’s temples through the \"Simudo\", i.e. “ox-seeking” paintings, where the spiritual journey is described through the metaphor of seeking a white ox.\n\nDaesoon Jinrihoe teachings are, in certain parts, similar to Confucianism, including an emphasis on sincerity, reverence, and trust, but Daesoon Jinrihoe diverges from the patriarchy and social hierarchy that characterize Confucianism. Daesoon Jinrihoe builds on terminology and ideas found in all of Korea's religious traditions. American scholar Don Baker called it the \"quintessential Korean religion,” arguing that Daesoon Jinrihoe is \"more than the sum of its parts\": not Buddhist, not Confucian, not Daoist, not inspired by Cheondoism, and not shamanistic, but all of these together and more. As mentioned earlier, the branches of the religion that divinize Park Wudang believe in a Trinity (similar to the beliefs of another Korean religion, Taejonggyo), in this case made up of Kang Jeungsan, Jo Jeongsan, and Park Wudang.. \n\nFollowers believe that there will be a \"Great Transformation\", after which humans will live in a universe with no poverty, disease, or war, and with divine beings and human beings existing in a state of unification. They have a mantra, called \"T'aeulju\", which they believe hastens the unification with Dao. Predictions about a specific date for the \"kaebyŏk\" (개벽, literally \"dawn of a new age\"), or entrance into the earthly paradise, have been banned by the movement. However, some followers still engaged in these predictions in the 1980s and 1990s, including in 1984 and, according to Jorgensen, in connection with the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.\n\nDaesoon Jinrihoe believes that the principle of \"Haewon sangsaeng\" should be realized in practice through three main social activities: charity aid, social welfare, and education. The movement is known in Korea for its centers of medical service and welfare for the elderly, including Jesaeng Hospital, and for the educational facilities, including Daejin University, which was founded in 1991, and six high schools. In addition to spiritual activities, the movement also campaigns on issues such as the environment, gender equality, reunification of Korea, and the achievement of world peace.\n\nEvery month, the members of Daesoon Jinrihoe make a monetary contribution, which is all sent to the head office. The movement reports that over 70% of the money collected then goes to the three major activities: relief and charity, social welfare, and education, and that a total of over 660 billion won (about 560 million USD) was allocated to those fields in the 39 years between 1975 and 2013. The movement also claims that Daesoon Jinrihoe “is a practical religion which actively puts its doctrines into action, and its activities are more influential and contributive than any other religions in Korea, from the viewpoint of its scale.”\n\nThe religion has a following among a wide variety of classes. It claims a membership of six million, though a 1995 survey by \"The Chosun Ilbo\" found it had 67,632 followers (sixth behind Wŏn Buddhism with 84,918 followers). A 2005 census revealed fewer than 35,000 Koreans claimed a belief in the religions derived from Kang Jeungsan, of which Daesoon Jinrihoe is one. The survey and census may have underestimated the number of followers, due to a lack of a specific category for Daesoon Jinrihoe and other new religions, and because followers have opted out of labeling themselves with a religious affiliation.\n\nBy the mid-1990s Daesun Jinrihoe had already over 1,500 centers, and the headquarters at Yeoju could house 10,000 people. In 2017, centers had become more than 2,000. The growth of the religion has been attributed to its ancestor worship, emphasis on self-cultivation, messianism and enlightenment, a focus on the present, and the stable system of its organization. According to Don Baker, “Daesoon doctrine also gains persuasive power from its focus on the ethical concerns that have been at the center of Korean religiosity for millennia”.\n\nCriticism of Daesoon Jinrihoe mostly comes from rival religions in the Kang Jeungsan lineage and Korean media hostile to local new religions in general, and it has been argued that, from there, it also found an echo in the works of Western scholars, such as John Jorgensen. Daesoon Jinrihoe members made a habit of recruiting at large bookstores or in the Seoul underground; these members would ask passers-by if they were interested in Eastern thought and invite them to learn more, without mentioning Daesoon Jinrihoe. In the mid-1990s, the main Yeoju branch of Daesoon Jinrihoe confronted these problems and banned missionary activities in public places altogether. However, these practices are still carried on by some other branches. Jorgensen also reported that rumors of extortion and violence against opponents were common in the 1990s; the clergy were said to work without pay on the religion's projects, and be restricted to 4-5 hours of sleep a day during some of the movement’s “cultivation” practices.. .\n\n\n"}

There have been few reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice.\n\nThe country has an area of and a population of 3.1 million. Buddhism and the country's traditions are closely tied, and while 26.5 percent of the population are atheists, 59.7 percent of religious Mongolians practice some form of Buddhism. Lamaist Buddhism and within it the Gelugpa school is the traditional and dominant religion.\n\nWhen socialist controls on religion and on the country's traditions ended in 1990, interest in the practice of Buddhism grew.\n\nKazakhs, most of whom are Muslim, are the largest ethnic minority, constituting approximately 4 percent of the population nationwide and 85 percent in the western province, Bayan-Ölgii. Kazakhs operate Islamic schools for their children. They sometimes receive financial assistance from religious organizations in Kazakhstan and Turkey.\n\nThere is a small number of Christians, including Roman Catholics, Russian Orthodox, but especially Protestants. In the capital, Ulaanbaatar, approximately 30,000 citizens, or 3 percent of the registered population of the city, practice Christianity.\n\nMany Mongols practice shamanism.The majority of these resides in the countryside. There are also small communities of the Bahá'í Faith and Ananda Marga in Ulaanbaatar.\n\nMissionaries are present in the country.\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice; however, the law limits proselytizing, and some religious groups seeking registration face burdensome bureaucratic requirements and lengthy delays. The constitution explicitly recognizes the separation of church and state.\n\nAlthough there is no state religion, ethnic Mongolian traditionalists believe that Buddhism is the \"natural religion\" of the country. The Government contributed to the restoration of several Buddhist sites that are important religious, historical, and cultural centers. The Government did not otherwise subsidize Buddhist or any other religious groups.\n\nA religious group must register with the Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs, a decentralized and bureaucratic process, in order to legally function as an organization. Religious institutions must reregister annually. The law allows the Government to supervise and limit the number of places of worship and number of clergy. The Government used the registration process as a mechanism to limit the number of places for religious worship; however, there were no reports that it limited the number of clergy during the reporting period.\n\nGroups must provide the following documentation when registering: a letter to the national ministry requesting registration, a letter from the city council or other local authority granting approval to conduct religious services, a brief description of the organization, its charter, documentation of the founding of the local group, a list of leaders or officers, brief biographic information on the person wishing to conduct religious services, and the expected number of worshippers. The Ulaanbaatar city council and other local legislative bodies require similar documentation prior to granting approval to conduct religious services. While the Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs possesses the ultimate authority to approve an organization's application, this appears to be largely pro forma. In practice local legislative bodies assess the applications.\n\nThe registration process is decentralized with several layers of bureaucracy and, under the best of circumstances, can take months to complete. Registration with the Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs in the capital may not be sufficient if a group intends to work in the countryside where local registration is also necessary. Throughout the country, there were 391 registered places of worship, including 217 Buddhist, 143 Christian, 5 Baha'i, 24 Muslim, and 2 shamanistic. During the period covered by this report, the Ministry registered 16 new Christian churches, 11 Buddhist temples, 19 Moslem mosques and 2 shaman temples. In Ulaanbaatar, the registration of one Buddhist and three Christian religious organizations which own a temple and three churches, respectively, remained under consideration.\n\nReligious instruction is not permitted in public schools. There is a school to train Buddhist lamas in Ulaanbaatar.\n\nWhile the law does not prohibit proselytizing by registered religious groups, it limits such activity by forbidding spreading religious views to nonbelievers by \"force, pressure, material incentives, deception, or means which harm health or morals or are psychologically damaging.\" There were no instances of prosecutions under this law during the reporting period. A Ministry of Education directive bans mixing foreign language or other training with religious teaching or instruction. Monitoring of the ban, particularly in the capital area, is strict. There were no reported violations of the ban in recent years. Religious groups that violate the law may not receive an extension of their registration. If individuals violate the law, the Government may ask their employers to terminate their employment. No such cases were reported during the reporting period. Registration and reregistration are burdensome for all religious groups. The length and documentation requirements of the process discourage some organizations from applying. Some Christian groups stated that local officials believed there were \"too many\" churches, or that there should at least be parity in the registration of new Buddhist temples and new Christian churches. No churches were known to have been refused registration in Ulaanbaatar during the reporting period; the applications of four religious organizations remained under consideration.\n\nAuthorities in Tuv aimag (province), near Ulaanbaatar, routinely denied registration to churches. There are currently no churches registered in the aimag, and several churches were again denied registration during the reporting period. A nongovernmental organization (NGO) filed a formal complaint with the National Human Rights Commission in May 2007 concerning the refusal by Tuv aimag authorities to register Christian churches. In June 2007 the Commission wrote to the Tuv aimag legislative body stating that the body's actions were in violation of the Constitution. Until the past year, almost all mosques throughout the country were registered as branches of one central Islamic organization. However, during the reporting period the Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs clarified that each mosque needed to seek additional approvals from local authorities in their areas. This separate registration generally proceeded smoothly. However, one mosque in Darkhan-Uul aimag was told that the aimag legislature had approved its application, but it did not receive documentation, leaving it unable to register with the Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs.\n\nUnregistered religious institutions are often able to function in practice but potentially face difficulties with authorities and are unable to sponsor foreign clergy for visas. Visa problems especially affect Christian churches, many of which depend on foreign clergy.\n\nThe Muslim community in Ulaanbaatar reported that authorities were helpful in assisting its efforts to construct a mosque, including donating a piece of land for the site.\n\nThere were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees or of forced religious conversions.\n\nReligions in Mongolia are in unequeal situation with regard to funding their activity. Buddhism was totally destroyed in Socialist time, and so it has not enough resources for adequate recovery. On the contrast, Christian and especially Protestant organizations have significantly more funds coming from abroad for their missionary activity. This resulated in their quick spreading in Mongolia at the expense of its traditional religions, Buddhism and Shamanism.\n\nThere were few reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice in the period covered by this report. Citizens generally were tolerant of the beliefs of others; however, because in the past humanitarian assistance was accompanied by proselytizing activity, there was some friction between foreign Christian missionary groups and citizens. Some social conservatives have criticized foreign influences on youth and children, including foreign religions and the alleged use of material incentives to attract converts.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45593433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45593433", "title": "Guru Nanak Jhira Sahib", "text": "Guru Nanak Jhira Sahib\n\nGuru Nanak Jhira Sahib is a Sikh historical shrine situated in Bidar, Karnataka. Gurdwara Nanak Jhira Sahib was built in the year 1948 and is dedicated to the first Sikh guru Guru Nanak. Bidar has a very long association with Sikhism as this is the home town of Bhai Sahib Singh, one of the Panj Pyare (five beloved ones), who offered to sacrifice their heads and were later baptised as the first members of the Khalsa.\n\nThe Gurudwara is established in a nice valley, surrounded by laterite hills on three sides. The shrine comprises \"Darbar Sahib\", \"Diwan Hall\" and \"Langar Hall\". In the sukhaasan room, Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of Sikh is placed. There is a separate room called the \"Likhari Room\", where donations are accepted and receipts are issued.\n\nA beautiful Gurdwara has been constructed after the independence of India in 1948 by the side of the spring. The water from the spring is collected in a small Amrit Kund (a holy water tank) built opposite to the front stairs of the Gurudwara . It is believed that a holy dip is enough to cleanse the body as well as the soul. There is a free community kitchen (Guru Ka Langar) where free food is given to pilgrims 24 hours night and day. A Sikh museum has been built in the memory of Guru Tegh Bahadur, depicting the important events of Sikh history through pictures and paintings.\n\nDuring his second udasi (missionary tour) of south India between 1510-1514 A.D., Guru Nanak after sojourning through Nagpur and Khandwa visited the ancient Hindu temple of Omkareshwar on the Narmada and reached Nanded (where 200 years later Guru Gobind Singh spent his last days). From Nanded he proceeded towards Hyderabad and Golconda where he met Muslim saints and then arrived at Bidar to meet \"Pir Jalaluddin and Yakoob Ali\".\n\nAccording to the Janamsakhis, the Guru accompanied by his companion \"Mardana\" stayed in the outskirts of the Bidar. Nearby were the huts of Muslim fakirs, who took keen interest in the sermons and teachings of the great guru. The news soon spread throughout Bidar and its surrounding areas about the holy saint of the north and large number of people started coming to him to have his darshan and seek his blessings. There used to be acute shortage of drinking water in Bidar. All efforts of the people to dig wells were of no avail. Even when wells produced water the water was found to be unfit for drinking.\n\nThe guru was greatly moved by the miserable condition of the people, and while uttering Sat Kartar, shifted a stone and removed some rubble from the place with his wooden sandal. To the utter surprise of all, a spring of cool and fresh water that has flowed to this day.\nThis is how the place soon came to be known as Nanak Jhira (Jhira=Stream). The crystal clear stream that still flows out of a rock near the Gurudwara is believed to be God's answer to the Guru's prayers.\n\nAnother version of Guru Nanak's visit to Bidar has him visiting a Sufi saint who lived with his family and followers here amidst a source of fresh, sweet water and that is where the Gurudwara eventually came to be.\n\nThough Bidar is at an elevation, the gurdwara is at a lower level. It is located amidst the slopes of the hilly terrain. The lateritic rock formation under the plateau enables percolation of surface water. Bidar urban plateau is of irregular shape, land stretching about 35.4 km in length and 19.3 km in width. The plateau consists of red laterite rocky crust, of a depth varying from 30.5 m to 152.4 m supported on impervious trap base.\nThis has resulted in springs at the cleavages between trap and laterite rocks. Such water springs can be observed in Bidar also at Narasimha Jharni, Papanasha Shiva Temple etc.\n\nIt may be recalled that Bhai Sahib Singh, one of The Panj Piaras (five beloved of Guru Gobind Singh), hailed from Bidar where he was once a barber. He was the son of Gurunarayana and Ankamma from Bidar.\n\nThe spring is flowing since more than 500 years and has never dried out. Devotees throng to the Nanak Jhira Bidar Gurudwara especially during Guru Nanak Jayanti. Volunteers make elaborate preparations to celebrate the Guru Nanak Jayanti, which is one of the major festivals of the Sikhs. Preparations include cleaning the gurudwara, guarding the shoes of visitors and helping out in the kitchen. The gurudwara is especially adorned with flags, banners and lights for this occasion.\n\nIn respect of Gurudwara Sri Nanak Jhira Sahib, It will not be out of place to mention that this Gurudwara is second super natural occurrences of Guru Nanak, whereas, the first one was Sri Punja Sahib (Now in Pakistan & strictly prohibited for free visits), Hence Gurudwara Nanak Jhira Sahib is \"Second Punja Sahib\" of India.\n\nNearly four to five lakh pilgrims visit this gurudwara every year. Part of the towns business comes from these crowds who gather at the spot built around water. It stands to reason therefore that special attention is paid to the spring and great care taken of this water resource. The Gurudwara itself has organized the tunnel and the point where the spring emerges very well. A glass panel enables viewing, yet protects the spring from desecration.\n\nVisitors and Pilgrims carry the \"holy\" water from the spring in bottles and water-cans.\n\nThe recharge zone of the spring, the surrounding hills are being built upon at an unprecedented rate. Septic tanks and soak pits are sending the waste-water generated into the ground. The surface is being crusted up with roads and buildings preventing the seepage of water into the ground.\n\nIt is likely that the sacred ‘Jhira’ will first be contaminated by the bad water and if steps are not taken quickly, may also run dry due to lack of recharge of waters in the hills.\n\n"}

The temple of Ptah in Memphis was dedicated to Ptah, his consort Sekhmet and their son Nefertem.\n\nHigh priests of Ptah are mentioned in inscriptions dating back to at least the Fourth Dynasty. In the tomb of the nobleman Debhen, for instance, there is a description of a visit by Pharaoh Menkaure to the construction site for his pyramid \"Divine is Menkaure\". The pharaoh is accompanied by a naval commander and two high priests of Ptah.\n\nThere used to be two high Priests of Ptah until the Sixth Dynasty.

The earliest tablets, written in the native Umbrian alphabet, were probably produced in the 3rd century BC, and the latest, written in the Latin alphabet, from the 1st century BC. The tablets contain religious inscriptions that memorialize the acts and rites of the Atiedian Brethren, a group of 12 priests of Jupiter with important municipal functions at Iguvium. The religious structure present in the tablets resembles that of the early stage of Roman religion, reflecting the Roman archaic triad and the group of gods more strictly related to Jupiter. Discovered in a farmer's field in the year 1444, they are currently housed in the Civic Museum of the Palazzo dei Consoli in Gubbio.\n\nThe tablets are written in the Umbrian language, and are by far the longest and most important document of any of the Osco-Umbrian group of languages, which are closely related to Latin. The tablets shed light on the grammar of this ancient dead language, and also on the religious practices of the ancient peoples of Italy, including the archaic religion of the Romans. Parts of tablets VI and VII appear to be written in an accentual metre, similar to the Saturnian metre that is encountered in the earliest Latin poetry.\n\nThe complete text, together with a translation into Latin, was published in London in 1863 by Francis Newman and 1931 in a book by Albrecht von Blumenthal. They were translated into English and published by James W. Poultney in 1959. Although the general meaning of the tablets is clear, there are still many obscure and debated points and issues. The main difficulty in understanding the text is the insufficient knowledge of the Umbrian vocabulary.\n\nThese are the only documents of the ancient religions of Europe and the Mediterranean which have come down to us in an almost complete state. Moreover, their content deals with the rituals (sacrifices and prayers) addressed to the highest gods of the local community and to some extent may reflect the common religious beliefs and practices of the Italic peoples. Consequently, a great number of scholars have devoted their efforts to reading and deciphering them since their discovery. As historical linguist Giacomo Devoto once described it, only Asia has documents of equal value.\n\nA farmer found the tablets in a field in 1441 and sold them to the city for two years' worth of farming rights. The content of the tablets concerns the religions and ceremonies that were celebrated at Iguvium, the town's religious organization and its boundaries.\n\nThe tablets are engraved on bronze. Analysis of the external appearance of the supporting material has led scholars to conclude that only tablets V, VI and VII were meant to be exposed in public. The other ones were cast as an archive document. They are inscribed in Italic alphabet derived from Etruscan (T. I to Vb 8) and in Latin alphabet (T. Vb 9 onwards, VI, VII).\n\nThe study of the \"ductus\" (writing style), conducted by comparing the tablets with other inscriptions from the area of Central Italy, has allowed scholars to conclude that they date from no later than the end of the 3rd century for T. III and IV to the first half of the 1st century for the latest T. VI and VII.\n\nTablets I to V present their topic in a concise, matter of fact manner. Tablets VI and VII repeat the same subject of Tablet I in a much more detailed and diluted way, with apparent literary and encomiastic intentions and overtones. The content of the tablets is given below, in their relative order of antiquity as established by Newman on the authority of Aufrecht and Kirchhoff, which is identical to that recently indicated by A. Maggiani.\n\nSacrifice to Puemonos Popricos and Vesuna.\n\nGeneral prescriptions concerning the holding of the sacrifice, sacrifice of the \"ovis\" (lamb) to \"Puemonos\" and \"Vesuna\" near a sacred grove. Containing details on the choice of the \"ohtur\" (\"auctor\", head, perhaps \"augur\") of the ceremony, the dispositions of the ritual instruments, the ritual invocations for the safety of the city to \"Iove Patre\" and \"Puemonos\", the distribution of the sacrificial meat and the libations.\n\nSide a (b of Lepsius)\n\n(Lacuna at the beginning of the text).\n\nSacrifice of an ox to \"Iove Patre\", of a ram to \"Iovio\"? (\"Iuno\" according to Newman), of a lamb to \"Iovio\" (\"Iuno\") and of a boar to \"Marte\".\n\nThe Hondia.\nMaking of the \"arfertur\".\nPreparations: readying of the victim(s), grains, \"strues\", \"fertum\"; incense or meal, wine; salt, \"mola\"; \"mandraculum\" (white linen used to wrap the officiant's hand), vases; pure water; ignition of the fire at the \"ara\". Petronian Feast to \"Hontos Iovios\": sacrifice to \"Hontos Iovios\" of puppies, offers of wine, libation, partition of the meats and their exposition on a board. Holding and turning of the \"ara\" with the hands and offer of wine. Division of the wine, the strues and ferctum, the meats among the participants. Burning (or inhumation) of the puppies at the \"ara\".\n\nSide b (a of Lepsius)\n\nSacrifice and feast of the Attidian Brotherhood:\n\nSacrifice of a pig and a ram to \"Iove\" at the time of the \"decuriae\" of month \"Semonius\" by the ten sets of families of each of the 12 regions. Sacred \"Epulum\" (feast) in honour of \"Iove Patre\", started in town and profanated at the various \"fana\" with libations using the \"mandraculum\".\n\nVocian (Buck: Lucian) Feast to \"Iupater\":\n\nSacrifice of a calf to \"Iove Patre\" for the Vocian (Lucian?) \"gens\" of the Attidians. The sacrifice is conducted with the \"urfeta\" in one hand at the offering and the \"crencatro\" (augural implement comparable to the \"lituum\" but crossed (Newman), or toga wore slanted across the right shoulder (Buck)) in the right hand at the time of the slaughtering.\n\nSide a\n\nSix triplet sacrifices to the Grabovian triad and the minor triad:\n\nAfter observing the birds on the before and the behind three oxen are sacrificed to \"Iove Grabovius\" before (without) the \"Trebulana Gate\". Behind (within) it three sows are sacrificed to \"Trebus Iovio\".\n\nBefore the \"Tesenaca Gate\" three oxen are sacrificed to \"Marte Grabovie\". Behind it three pigs are sacrificed to \"Fisus Sancius\". A libation ensues.\n\nBefore the \"Vehiia Gate\" three white fronted oxen are sacrificed to \"Vofione Grabovie\". Behind the Gate three ewe lambs are sacrificed to \"Tefre Iovie\". After the profanation of the lambs, the rump is offered in expiation and a libation for the \"tota\", local community, ensues, on the two sides separately starting with the right side. After the profanation of the rumps is over the backs shall be profanated.\n\nSide b\n\nTwo more triplet sacrifices to \"Marte Hodie\" and \"Hondos Çerfios\" in atonement for the citadel:\n\nAt the Jovian grove after the shearing of sheep three male calves shall be sacrificed to \"Marte Hodie\" for the Iguvine people and \"tota\".\n\nAt the Coreties (Quiritius or Curiatius) grove three male calves shall be sacrificed to \"Hontos Çerfios\".\n\nHenceforth the citadel will be expiated. If any anything vicious happened in the discharge of the rite the birds shall be observed, the rite shall be reinstated once again after returning to the Trebulana Gate.\n\nReview of the city militia and expulsion (\"exterminatio\") of the traditional enemies of Iguvium by the \"arfertur\" and the two \"prinovatus\" (\"augures\" or their attendants): Tadinates, Tusci, Naherci, (Sabines from the area of river Nar, now Nera), Iapuzcoi (a people settled near the Alps between NE Italy and NW Balkans).\n\nFour more triplet sacrifices:\n\nNear the small fontains three red boars shall be sacrificed to Çerfos Martios.\n\nOn the Rubinian \"ager\" three she boars shall be sacrificed to Prestata Çerfia of Çerfos Martios. The sacred jugs, black and white, shall there be ordered and turned.\n\nBeyond the \"Sahata\" (\"Sahata\" is probably the area considered within the pomerium, possibly marked by a stream) three she calves shall be sacrificed to Tursa Çerfia of Çerfios Martios.\n\nThe assignation of the place where to carry out the slaughter of the boars shall be decided according to the site upon which the officiant is watching, whether either behind on the \"Rubina\" or beyond on the \"Sahata\".\n\nThree days later the people shall be assembled and three heifers sacrificed below the Forum of \"Sehemania\" (\"Semonia\") to \"Tursa Iovia\" at \"Acedonia\". One of the heifers shall be consecrated by the \"arfertur\" and two by the \"prinovatus\".\n\nSide a\n\nDuties of the \"arfertur\":\n\nThe \"arfertur \" must provide whatever is essential for the ceremony and select the victims.\n\nFees to be levied for the performance of the rites.\n\nWhenever the banquet of the brotherhood takes place, the \"fratreks\" or the \"cvestor\" must put to votes whether the banquet was properly arranged. If the majority of those present think it was not, a further vote must be taken to fix the penalty for the \"arfertur\".\n\nSide b\n\nContributions to be made by two \"gentes\" to the brethren, and portions of flesh to be awarded them by the brethren on the decurial festival.\n\nThese two tablets repeat the content of tablet I while expanding it to include and expound the minutest details of the rituals.\n\nVI Side a\n\nLustration of the \"arx\"\n\nIntroductory auspices: as in I the sacrifice is to be preceded by the taking of the auspices. Formulae passed between the augur and the arfertur (legum dictio); warning against noises, interruptions, meddling; boundaries of the augural templum; formulae of announcement of the auspices (conspectio, nuntiatio); prescriptions applying to the ensuing sacrifice concerning the military rod (\"pirsca arsmatia\"), the disposition of the pots and the fire.\n\n1. Sacrifice of three oxen to Iove Grabovios before the Trebulan gate. An opening prayer is followed by three long prayers in identical words for each of the three offerings to the three Grabovian gods and these by a general prayer in conclusion. Then follow prayers especially devoted to the rites connected with the sacrifice.\n\n2. Sacrifice of three pregnant sows to Trebos Iovios behind the Trebulan gate: the prayers used in the first sacrifice are to be repeated.\n\nSide b\n\n3. Sacrifice of three oxen to Marte Grabovios before the Tesenaca gate. The prayers of the first sacrifice are to be repeated .\n\n4. Sacrifice of three suckling pigs to Fisus Sancius behind the Tesenaca gate. The prayers of the first sacrifice are to be repeated. Then an offering of cakes accompanied by specific prayers and ceremonies ensues (involving the use of the \"mandraculum\", white linen cloth wrapping the right hand of the officiant): special attention is given to Fisus Sancius, patron of the citadel (\"ocre Fisia\").\n\n5. Sacrifice of three oxen with a white forehead (\"calersuf\") to Vofionos Grabovios before the Vehia gate. The prayers of the first sacrifice are to be repeated.\n\n6. Sacrifice of three she lambs to Tefer Iovios behind the Vehia gate. The prayers of the first sacrifice are to be repeated. Then supplementary offerings follow, thereafter prayers and accompanying rites with vases on both sides of a trench.\n\n7. Sacrifice of three bull calves to Marte Horse at the Iovian grove. The prayers of the first sacrifice are to be repeated.\n\n8. Sacrifice of other three bull calves to Hondos Çerfios at the Coredian grove. The prayers of the first sacrifice are to be repeated.\n\nRites for the lustration of the \"poplo\" (people, i. e. city militia) and execration of the enemies:\n\nThe auspices are to be taken in the same way as for the lustration of the \"arx\". Holding the \"perca arsmatia\" (ritual staff) and the \"cringatro\" the \"arsfertur\" lights the fire then with the two assistants (\"prinovatus\"), who hold rods of pomegranate wood, marches with the victims along the Augural Way to the district of \"Acedonia\". Proclamation is made expelling the alien enemies. The Iguvines are ordered to form in companies. The \"arsfertur\" and the assistants march about them thrice with the victims and the fire. At the end a prayer is made invoking misfortune upon the aliens and blessings upon the Iguvinians.\n\nVII Side a\n\nSacrifice of three boars to\" Çerfios Martios\" at the \"Fontuli\", accompanied by the prayers used at the Trebulan gate.\n\nSacrifice of three sows to \"Praestita Çerfia\" at \"Rubinia\", with the prayers used at the Trebulan gate. Ceremonies with the black vessels and the white vessels, the former meant to bring misfortune to the aliens, the latter to avert it from the Iguvinians. Offering to Fisovius Sancius with the prayersw used behind the Tesenaca gate.\n\nSacrifice of three female calves beyond the \"Sahata\" to \"Tursa Çerfia\" of the Çerfios of Marte. The prayers used at the Trebulan gate are to be repeated. The profanation of the offerings must take place where the \"nuntiatio\" happened: either in Rubinia or beyond the Sahata.\n\nAfter three days the holder of the \"perca arsmatia\" and the two assistants pray silently for the execration of the enemies and the safety of Iguvium from the shrine of Tursa. Then heifers are set free below the Forum of \"Sehemenia\": the first person who has caught any of the first three shall sacrifice them to \"Tursa Iovia\" at \"Aceronia\" for Iguvium. The prayers and rituals (offer of cereals, strues, fertum, \"persea\") used at the Trebulan gate are to be repeated.\n\nSide b\n\nObligations of the \"fratrexs\" and entity of the fine he must pay in case of omissions (300 asses).\n\nThe triad of the \"Grabovii\" is the highest group of deities of the Iguvian pantheon and looks to be strictly aligned with the archaic triad of Roman religion. The epithet Grabovius seems to be related to Etruscan \"crapis\", ceremonial litter, which might derive from a word meaning oakwood.\n\nThe triad is composed by \"Iove\" or \"Iove Patre\", \"Marte\" and \"Vofionos\". The identity of the last has been understood as corresponding to Roman gods \"Quirinus\" or \"Liber\", the former from an IE root *leudh- meaning people, the latter either directly from the Italic theonym \"Loifer\" or through the intermediary of the Italic or Etruscan interpretation of Greek god \"(Dionysos) Eleutheros\", recorded also in the Etruscan theonym \"Tin Luth\" (=Iuppiter Liber) of the Piacenza Liver.\n\nThe gods of the triad of the Grabovii receive in sacrifice three oxen (\"buf\") outside the three town gates (\"Preveres Treblanes, Tesenaces, Vehiies\" before the Trebulan, Tesenacan, Vehiian Gate). Those to be offered to Vofionos are qualified as \"calersu\", probably correspondent in meaning to Latin \"callidus\", with a white forehead.\n\nThe gods of this triad receive sacrifices in correspondence with those of the major one but these gods are honoured within the town gates. \"Trebos Iovios\" corresponds to \"Iove Grabovios\", \"Fisus Sancius\" to \"Marte Grabovios\" and \"Tefer Iovios\" to \"Vofionos Grabovios\". They received sacrifices of three pregnant sows, three suckling pigs and three ewe lambs respectively. Only the identity of the second one is known with any degree of certainty from attestations of his existence in Rome and elsewhere in Italy. In Rome he is known as Semo Sancus Dius Fidius. It is odd that he is here associated with Mars while his association with Jupiter would seem more well grounded theologically . The topic has been the object of a study by Dominique Briquel: he opines the reason should lie in the repressive and henceforth military connotation of the notion of divine sanction of the law. This aspect is particularly relevant as to the divine sanction\nof the town wall, fact which is of primary concern in the content of the Tablets.\n\n\"Trebos\" in \"Trebos Iovios\" is usually understood as corresponding in meaning to Latin \"trabs\", ridge of the roof. \"Tefer\" of \"Tefer Iovios\" is often explained as burner, from the IE root *\"tep\" haet. This interpretation though is very debated.\n\nBoth Benveniste and Dumézil have argued that the Iguvine triads are just another testimony of their three functional hypothesis of IE religion. In particular the sacrificial offerings roughly correspond to those of Rome in their three functional significance and the sixfold invocations of VIa 30 and 39, VIb 13 and 32 (\"nerf, arsmo; veiro, peiquo; castruo, fri\": princes, priests; men, cattle; fields, land produce) show a direct connection to the sovereign, military and productive activities.\n\nMany scholars, from Bücheler to Prosdocimi, opine this deity is an underworld god of agricultural fertility and plenty on the grounds of the sacrifice of puppies he receives at his festival. Prosdocimi calls it the \"intermestruae cereales\": the declaration of the dog is set at the climax of the \"feriae\" . Jörg Rüpke remarks the association of Hondos with Juppiter is one among the numerous in the tablets, in which a complex multilevel and hierarchic structure of relationship among theonyms is envisaged. This phenomenon would put the god into a sort of host-guest relationship with the one given in the attributive. In the case of Hondos this feature is apparent also in the fact that his cults at the Hondia festival take place in the Jovian Grove but those at the lustration of the citadel (when the god bears the epithet of Çerfios) in the Coredian Grove.\n\nThese deities are invoked and receive sacrifices aimed at obtaining their favour for the protection of the \"arx\" itself, of the community and of the fields in connexion to the lustration rites of the Iguvian citadel at different locations of augural relevance.\n\nThe rites concerning the \"Praestota\" and the two \"Tursae\" involve a complex of libations aimed at obtaining a twofold action: the safety for the Iguvine community and the offsetting and expulsion of its traditional enemies.\n\nThe debated points are few as far as the \"Praestota\" and \"Tursa\" are concerned. The two theonyms correspond to the Latin \"Iuppiter Praestes\", \"Iuppiter Praestitus\", \"Iuppiter Praestabilis\" and the \"Lares Praestites\". \"Tursa\" corresponds to god \"Terminus\", being the deity that represents the boundaries of the city at different locations of augural relevance: these are without and within the city for \"Tursa Çerfia\" and \"Tursa Iovia\" respectively (TI I b; VII a). Such a meaning is connected to the Umbrian word for border, \"tuder\": \"Tursa\" is written \"Tuda\" in the Etruscan tablets, the intervocalic \"d\" being pronounced as a weak \"rs\" (i.e.: ḍ). Dumézil on the other hand, on the grounds of the function of \"Tursa\", a deity whose action is to scare, inspire terror into the enemies, opines the theonym derives from a verbal root equivalent to Latin \"terreo\", I scare (interpreting accordingly \"tursitu, tremitu\" in VIb 60).\n\nThere is no agreement among scholars on the meaning of the epithet \"Çerfios\" and as to whether this is also a theonym, i. e. \"Çerfos Martios\" is a god different from Mars or not. An inscription from Corfinium reads: \"Çerfom sacaracicer Semunes sua[d\", \"priest of the Çerfi and the Semones\", placing side by side the two categories of entities, the \"çerfi\" and the \"semunes\". \"Çerfos\" is most times associated to IE root *ker(s) and Latin theonyms \"Ceres\" and \"Cerus\". This view though might create interpretative problems concerning the theology of Mars and of the two deities who in Rome are associated with the sphere of law and defence, i. e. gods Jupiter and Semo Sancus Dius Fidius. Georg Wissowa and Dumézil both underline that the derivation from root *ker(s) is not certain: Umbrian group -\"rf\" could have a different origin than -\"rs\".\n\nMarte and Hondos appear also under these epithets. Here too the only certain indication is from Roman \"Heres\" (or \"Here\") \"Martea\", connected with \"heres\", he who inherits and also \"dominus\", the position of master of the house. Some scholars though connect the epithet to Latin adjective \"fodius\", he who destroys. The two gods both receive sacrifices of male calves in the rites for the lustration of the citadel at the Iovian and Coredian groves respectively; theirs are the last in the series of sacrifices after the two triads and before the execration of the enemies.\n\nGod Hondos receives the epithet \"Iovios\" in II and that of \"Çerfios\" in VI. This fact raises the question of whether these epithets were used alternatively in connexion with local or temporal constraints. Another similar instance is that of \"Tursa Çerfia\" and \"Tursa Iovia\", who are found without and within the \"pomerium\" respectively.\n\nThis divine couple appears only in tablets III and IV, the most ancient ones. Puemonos's name seems to be related with Roman goddess Pomona; moreover both the name itself and the epithet \"Popricos\" (\"Publicus\") hint towards a universal fertility god, similar to Latin god Liber. Vesuna is also found on a coin from Marsian territory.\n\nO. de Cazanove observes Iguvinian theonyms appear to be compound formations of two, three and four terms: they may consist of a substantive plus an epithet (e. g. Honods Iovios, Tursa Iovia, Puemonos Podpricos), of a substantive plus a possessive phrase plus epithet (e. g. Vesuna of Puemonos Podpricos) and of a substantive plus epithet plus possessive phrase plus epithet (e. g. Prestota Çerfia of Çerfios Martios, Tursa Çerfia of Çerfios Martios). In his view this situation is comparable to that of Rome where are recorded purely functional deities in the pontifical books. These divinities were invoked in the prayers according to the Roman rite as mentioned by Gellius: \"Lua Saturni, Salacia Neptuni, Hora Quirini, Virites Quirini, Maia Vulcani, Heries Iunonis, Moles Martis, Nerio Martis\"\". These entities would be a concrete representation of the powers of their respective god.\n\nAt Iguvium though the situation looks more complex and less fixed as Tursa and Hondos are alternatively Çerfian and Martian and Çerfian and Iovian respectively.\n\nSome other deities are known just because they are mentioned occasionally in specifying the limits of augural observation (included those of the town). These theonyms are for the most part known in Roman religion. They are Tursa and (possibly) Hulos in IV 17 and 19 respectively, Vestisios (Libasius) apparently god of libations, Hoios (cf. Latin Holus, Helus, Roman grove of Helernus in Ovid's \"Fasti\" II 67-68) god of vegetation and Padella (cf. Roman goddess Patella), goddess of opening sheaves in VIa 14. Possibly adjective \"deueia\" of \"Asa Deueia\" (VIa 9, 10) implies a cult of the sky under the name \"Dius\", \"Dia\", similar to that of Dea Dia outside Rome (Ancellotti & Cerri).\n\nThe Attidian brethren had an \"arsfertur\" (literally the Umbrian equivalent of Latin \"adfertor\", i. e. \"he who carries something to somewhere\", clearly referring to a role in the ceremonies, holder of the \"pirca arsmatia\", ceremonial rod). Other mentioned offices include the \"fratrecs\" interpreted as \"curator arcae\", the \"cvestor\" and the \"prinovatus\", probably agrimensors, attendants of the person who takes the auspices. An \"ohtor\" (\"auctor\") is mentioned in T. III and IV: the term denotes the person responsible for the ceremony.\n\nThe tablets record different sets of rites held on different festive occasions: the main and recorded in greatest detail one is the annual lustration of the citadel (\"ocre\", Latin \"arx\") of Iguvium (Tablets I, VI and VII). This rite includes sacrifices to the \"Grabovian\" (major) triad and the minor one near the gates of the town, sacrifices to \"Marte Hodie\" and \"Hondos Çerfios\" at the two sacred groves of \"Iove\" and \"Coredios\" (interpreted as \"Quiritius\" or \"Curiatius\") respectively, the lustral review of the people of Iguvium in arms, i. e. the city militia, the execration and ritual expulsion (\"exterminatio\") of the traditional enemies of Iguvium and final sacrifices to \"Çerfios Marti(os)\", the \"Praestita Çerfia\" and the two \"Tursae\", \"Çerfia and Iovia\", at various locations without and within the pomerium. Tablets VI and VII relate the ritual actions such as circumambulations, libations, kneelings and dance in minute detail recording all the prayers and the other augural formulae. The older tablet I gives a more concise record.\n\nThe ritual triple (three time) circumambulation with fire and the victims about the city militia looks parallel to the Roman ritual performed by king Tullius as described by Dionysius of Halicarnassus.\n\nThe most complex ceremonies are those concerning Tefer Iovios and Fisus Sancius. A summary is appended below.\n\nTefer Iovios:\n\nSacrifice of the ewe lambs with the usual prayers used for each god of the two triads.\n\nOffering of the \"persondro sorsom\" (suine) at the right foot of the gate with accompanying libation.\n\nOffering of the libations.\n\nPrayer to Tefer Iovios.\n\nOffering of the \"persondro staflare\" (bovine or ovine) at the left foot of the gate.\n\n\"Tripodium\".\n\nPrayer repeated.\n\nAssigning of the \"prosecta\" (cuts of sacrificial meat).\n\nAssigning of the libation accompanying the \"persondro sorsale \" at the right foot where the \"sorso\" was offered to the god (profanated).\n\nAssigning of the libation accompanying the \"persondro staflare \" at the left foot as above.\n\nBurning or inhumation of the \"persondro sorsale\".\n\nBurning or inhumation of the \"persondro staflare\".\n\nThrowing away of the vessels used for the \"persondro\" during the prayer on the incense (or cereal meal).\n\nFisus Sancius (here appealed to also as \"Fisovius\" = \"Fiducius\"):\n\nSacrifice of three suckling piglets with the usual prayers, consecration with incense (or meal) and grains as at the Trebulan gate.\n\nWearing of the \"mandraculum\" (white cloth) around the right hand by the officiant.\n\nAdding of the \"ficla\" and \"strucla\" to the \"prosecta\".\n\nPlacing of the \"sopo\" (offa) at the back.\n\nThe officiant while kneeling offers the libation, the \"mefa\" and the \"spefa\" spilling them from the vessels.\n\nPrayer for the \"arx\" and the community.\n\nDuring the prayer libation and \"tripodium\".\n\nOffering of the libation.\n\nDistribution of the \"prosecta\" and of the libation while kneeling.\n\nCrushing and spilling over the fire of the \"mefa\", libation, \"sopa\" (possibly lower entrails).\n\nMilling while sitting, prayer over the milled incense or meal.\n\nThe two profane and the two sacred jugs are disposed in rows.\n\nTablet II records various sacrifices to \"Iove\", \"Iovio\" (or \"Iovia\"? Newman: \"Iuno\") and \"Marte\" to be held in atonement of possible unknown ritual faults; \nthe \"Hondia\" festivals on which occasion dogs were offered in sacrifice to \"Hondos Iovios\"; the feast to \"Hondos Iovios\" held by the \"gens Petronia\" (these last two festivals might in fact be one); the sacrifice and feast of the \"sodalitas\" of the \"Fratres Atiedii\" on which rams and pigs were sacrificed to \"Iove\" by the ten sets of families of the twelfth \"pomperias\", districts of Iguvium; finally the sacrifice of a calf at the feast of \"Iove Patre\" held by the gens \"Vocia\" (\"Lucia\"). The tablet might be fragmentary, i. e. record only the final part of a ritual at its beginning.\n\nHere is the summary of the ceremonies at the festival of Hondos:\n\nHondia (IIa 15-44):\n\nthe sum of money for the kid(s) is to be raised among the dining tables at the published price\n\nthe arfertur is to be made after observing the birds\n\nthe kid(s), grains, \"strues\", \"fertum\"; incense, wine, salt, \"mola\"; \"mandraculum\", vases (consecrated and not or wet and dry), water (or ointment) are to be prepared\n\nthe fire is lit on the \"ara\"\n\nthe incense is consecrated\n\noffer of the kid(s) to Hondos Iovios, declaration of its purity\n\nthe \"sopa\"s of the kid are taken and the \"prosiciae\" (cutlets) divided upon the breadcrusts\n\nempty baskets are placed behind and the cereals before at the foot (of the \"ara\")\n\noffer of the incense\n\nlibation and \"tripodium\"\n\n\"tripodium\" near the vessels of wine chanting in turn nine times: \"I honour Thee with incense and wine\"\n\nbringing of the crusts with the entrails\n\nlibation\n\ntwo cuts of the kid(s) are divided into three pieces or three times\n\naddition of \"strues\" and \"fertum\"\n\noffering of the dog\n\nprayer over the uncut flesh\n\naddition of \"strues\" and \"fertum\" to the flesh cuts\n\noffering of the kid(s); prayer in front of it\n\nprayer on the flesh, both uncut and roasted\n\noffer of the \"suppa\" on the plates\n\nprayer on the dedicatory jugs\n\nlibation, \"tripodium\", moving and placing down of the offerings\n\n\"suppa\"s are placed behind, the flesh is taken by hand\n\nthe incense is placed in two jars on the bracket\n\nbreadcrusts, fried placentas, pots both containing water (ointment) and empty are brought over\n\nlibation to Hondos Iovios from the jugs for the gens Petronia of the Attidian Brethren\n\nbeyond the bracket prayer on the pure breadcrusts\n\nsame wise prayer on the placentae, the pure jugs filled with water and the empty ones on the bracket\n\nlibation and \"tripodium\"\n\nthe bracket is moved aside; prayer on the pure water (ointment)\n\nhands are washed from the \"ara\" (or the \"ara\" is turned in the hands)\n\nback to the ara, near it silent prayer on the pure wine\n\nbringing and distribution of whatever the participants wish: wine, incense\n\ngrinding of the \"strues\", \"fertum\"; spilling of the incense or meal on the jar\n\nprayer on the whole and the ground grains\n\nthe rite is proclaimed over\n\nthe sacred rite is profanated\n\nthe kid(s) is burnt near the \"ara\".\n\nSacrifices of dogs were not common among ancient Italic people. Instances in Rome include the Lupercalia and a parallel may be found in the \"Augurium Canarium\" and the Robigalia, both held in late Spring for the propitiation of a good harvest and for the preservation of the grains from mildew respectively. According to the explanation given in Ovid by the \"flamen Quirinalis\" the dog was sacrificed because at the time in which the grains in the ears are in danger for the heat and draught the sun enters the constellation of the Dog: this explanation is erroneous. Another ritual aimed at protecting corn in danger from fires concerned foxes which were set afire in the Circus Maximus on the last day of the \"Cerialia\" (\"Cerealia\"). Finally dogs were crucified on the Capitol at the beginning of August, time of the \"canicula\" to avert the rabies contagion or lessen their barking which disturbed sick people.\n\nTablet III and IV record in minute detail the rituals of the festival of Puemonos Popricos and Vesuna at a sacred grove outside the town. Recently Michael Weiss has advanced the view that this was a new year ritual on the grounds of comparative material.\n\nLatin sources concerning the cooking of the \"viscera\" underline the difference between the Etruscan and Roman customs distinguishing the \"exta aulicocta\" boiled in the \"olla extaris\" before the offering to the god, from the Tuscan \"exta \" roasted \"in veru\" and partly eaten during the sacrificial rite. At Iguvium the description of some sacrificial rites documents both the use of spits for the viscera and the presence of \"prosiciae\" displayed on the table of the offerings beside the fire and perhaps consecrated and burnt to the gods.\n\nAugural practices are presented in the tablets, most notably in the last two ones. They include the \"praeire verba\", i.e. the uttering of the words to be repeated by the \"arfertur\", the \"legum dictio\", the rules for the taking of the auspices such as silence (\"silentium\") and the avoidance of other incidents, the definition of the boundaries of the augural \"templum\", the \"nuntiatio\", announcement of the appearance of the expected signs from birds, the circumambulation of the army with fire.\n\nTablet VI begins with an augural song.

{"id": "14605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14605", "title": "Indian religions", "text": "Indian religions\n\nIndian religions, sometimes also termed as Dharmic faiths or religions, are the religions that originated in the Indian subcontinent; namely Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. These religions are also all classified as Eastern religions. Although Indian religions are connected through the history of India, they constitute a wide range of religious communities, and are not confined to the Indian subcontinent.\n\nEvidence attesting to prehistoric religion in the Indian subcontinent derives from scattered Mesolithic rock paintings. The Harappan people of the Indus Valley Civilisation, which lasted from 3300 to 1300 BCE (mature period, 2600–1900 BCE), had an early urbanized culture which predates the Vedic religion.\n\nThe documented history of Indian religions begins with the historical Vedic religion, the religious practices of the early Indo-Iranians, which were collected and later redacted into the \"Vedas\". The period of the composition, redaction and commentary of these texts is known as the Vedic period, which lasted from roughly 1750–500 BCE. The philosophical portions of the Vedas were summarized in Upanishads, which are commonly referred to as \"Vedānta\", variously interpreted to mean either the \"last chapters, parts of the Veda\" or \"the object, the highest purpose of the Veda\". The early Upanishads all predate the Common Era, five of the eleven principal Upanishads were composed in all likelihood before 6th century BCE, and contain the earliest mentions of \"Yoga\" and Moksha.\n\nThe Reform or Shramanic Period between 800–200 BCE marks a \"turning point between the Vedic Hinduism and Puranic Hinduism\". The Shramana movement, an ancient Indian religious movement parallel to but separate from Vedic tradition, which often defied many of the Vedic and Upanishadic concepts of soul (Atman) and the ultimate reality (Brahman). In 6th century BCE, the Shramnic movement matured into Jainism and Buddhism and was responsible for the schism of Indian religions into two main philosophical branches of astika, which venerates Veda (e.g., six orthodox schools of Hinduism) and nastika (e.g., Buddhism, Jainism, Charvaka, etc.). However, both branches shared the related concepts of Yoga, \"saṃsāra\" (the cycle of birth and death) and \"moksha\" (liberation from that cycle).\n\nThe Puranic Period (200 BCE – 500 CE) and Early Medieval period (500–1100 CE) gave rise to new configurations of Hinduism, especially bhakti and Shaivism, Shaktism, Vaishnavism, Smarta and much smaller groups like the conservative Shrauta.\n\nThe early Islamic period (1100–1500 CE) also gave rise to new movements. Sikhism was founded in the 15th century on the teachings of Guru Nanak and the nine successive Sikh Gurus in Northern India. The vast majority of its adherents originate in the Punjab region.\n\nWith the colonial dominance of the British a reinterpretation and synthesis of Hinduism arose, which aided the Indian independence movement.\n\nJames Mill (1773–1836), in his The History of British India (1817), distinguished three phases in the history of India, namely Hindu, Muslim and British civilisations. This periodisation has been criticised, for the misconceptions it has given rise to. Another periodisation is the division into \"ancient, classical, medieval and modern periods\", although this periodization has also received criticism.\n\nRomila Thapar notes that the division of Hindu-Muslim-British periods of Indian history gives too much weight to \"ruling dynasties and foreign invasions,\" neglecting the social-economic history which often showed a strong continuity. The division in Ancient-Medieval-Modern overlooks the fact that the Muslim-conquests took place between the eight and the fourteenth century, while the south was never completely conquered. According to Thapar, a periodisation could also be based on \"significant social and economic changes,\" which are not strictly related to a change of ruling powers.\n\nSmart and Michaels seem to follow Mill's periodisation, while Flood and Muesse follow the \"ancient, classical, mediaeval and modern periods\" periodisation. An elaborate periodisation may be as follows:\n\nEvidence attesting to prehistoric religion in the Indian subcontinent derives from scattered Mesolithic rock paintings such as at Bhimbetka, depicting dances and rituals. Neolithic agriculturalists inhabiting the Indus River Valley buried their dead in a manner suggestive of spiritual practices that incorporated notions of an afterlife and belief in magic. Other South Asian Stone Age sites, such as the Bhimbetka rock shelters in central Madhya Pradesh and the Kupgal petroglyphs of eastern Karnataka, contain rock art portraying religious rites and evidence of possible ritualised music.\n\nThe religion and belief system of the Indus valley people have received considerable attention, especially from the view of identifying precursors to deities and religious practices of Indian religions that later developed in the area. However, due to the sparsity of evidence, which is open to varying interpretations, and the fact that the Indus script remains undeciphered, the conclusions are partly speculative and largely based on a retrospective view from a much later Hindu perspective. An early and influential work in the area that set the trend for Hindu interpretations of archaeological evidence from the Harrapan sites was that of John Marshall, who in 1931 identified the following as prominent features of the Indus religion: a Great Male God and a Mother Goddess; deification or veneration of animals and plants; symbolic representation of the phallus (linga) and vulva (yoni); and, use of baths and water in religious practice. Marshall's interpretations have been much debated, and sometimes disputed over the following decades.\nOne Indus valley seal shows a seated, possibly ithyphallic and tricephalic, figure with a horned headdress, surrounded by animals. Marshall identified the figure as an early form of the Hindu god Shiva (or Rudra), who is associated with asceticism, yoga, and linga; regarded as a lord of animals; and often depicted as having three eyes. The seal has hence come to be known as the Pashupati Seal, after \"Pashupati\" (lord of all animals), an epithet of Shiva. While Marshall's work has earned some support, many critics and even supporters have raised several objections. Doris Srinivasan has argued that the figure does not have three faces, or yogic posture, and that in Vedic literature Rudra was not a protector of wild animals. Herbert Sullivan and Alf Hiltebeitel also rejected Marshall's conclusions, with the former claiming that the figure was female, while the latter associated the figure with \"Mahisha\", the Buffalo God and the surrounding animals with vahanas (vehicles) of deities for the four cardinal directions. Writing in 2002, Gregory L. Possehl concluded that while it would be appropriate to recognise the figure as a deity, its association with the water buffalo, and its posture as one of ritual discipline, regarding it as a proto-Shiva would be going too far. Despite the criticisms of Marshall's association of the seal with a proto-Shiva icon, it has been interpreted as the Tirthankara Rishabha by Jains and Dr. Vilas Sangave or an early Buddha by Buddhists. Historians like Heinrich Zimmer, Thomas McEvilley are of the opinion that there exists some link between first Jain Tirthankara Rishabha and Indus Valley civilisation.\n\nMarshall hypothesized the existence of a cult of Mother Goddess worship based upon excavation of several female figurines, and thought that this was a precursor of the Hindu sect of Shaktism. However the function of the female figurines in the life of Indus Valley people remains unclear, and Possehl does not regard the evidence for Marshall's hypothesis to be \"terribly robust\". Some of the baetyls interpreted by Marshall to be sacred phallic representations are now thought to have been used as pestles or game counters instead, while the ring stones that were thought to symbolise \"yoni\" were determined to be architectural features used to stand pillars, although the possibility of their religious symbolism cannot be eliminated. Many Indus Valley seals show animals, with some depicting them being carried in processions, while others show chimeric creations. One seal from Mohen-jodaro shows a half-human, half-buffalo monster attacking a tiger, which may be a reference to the Sumerian myth of such a monster created by goddess Aruru to fight Gilgamesh.\n\nIn contrast to contemporary Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilisations, Indus valley lacks any monumental palaces, even though excavated cities indicate that the society possessed the requisite engineering knowledge. This may suggest that religious ceremonies, if any, may have been largely confined to individual homes, small temples, or the open air. Several sites have been proposed by Marshall and later scholars as possibly devoted to religious purpose, but at present only the Great Bath at Mohenjo-daro is widely thought to have been so used, as a place for ritual purification. The funerary practices of the Harappan civilisation is marked by its diversity with evidence of supine burial; fractional burial in which the body is reduced to skeletal remains by exposure to the elements before final interment; and even cremation. \n\nThe early Dravidian religion constituted of non-Vedic form of Hinduism in that they were either historically or are at present Āgamic. The Agamas are non-vedic in origin and have been dated either as post-vedic texts. or as pre-vedic oral compositions. The \"Agamas\" are a collection of Tamil and later Sanskrit scriptures chiefly constituting the methods of temple construction and creation of \"murti\", worship means of deities, philosophical doctrines, meditative practices, attainment of sixfold desires and four kinds of yoga. The worship of tutelary deity, sacred flora and fauna in Hinduism is also recognized as a survival of the pre-Vedic Dravidian religion.\nAncient Tamil grammatical works Tolkappiyam, the ten anthologies Pattuppāṭṭu, the eight anthologies Eṭṭuttokai also sheds light on early religion of ancient Dravidians. \"Seyon\" was glorified as \"the red god seated on the blue peacock, who is ever young and resplendent,\" as \"the favored god of the Tamils.\" Sivan was also seen as the supreme God. Early iconography of Seyyon and Sivan and their association with native flora and fauna goes back to Indus Valley Civilization. The Sangam landscape was classified into five categories, \"thinais\", based on the mood, the season and the land. Tolkappiyam, mentions that each of these \"thinai\" had an associated deity such Seyyon in \"Kurinji\"-the hills, Thirumaal in \"Mullai\"-the forests, and Kotravai in \"Marutham\"-the plains, and Wanji-ko in the \"Neithal\"-the coasts and the seas. Other gods mentioned were Mayyon and Vaali who were all assimilated into Hinduism over time. Dravidian linguistic influence on early Vedic religion is evident, many of these features are already present in the oldest known Indo-Aryan language, the language of the \"Rigveda\" (c. 1500 BCE), which also includes over a dozen words borrowed from Dravidian. This represents an early religious and cultural fusion or synthesis between ancient Dravidians and Indo-Aryans, which became more evident over time with sacred iconography, traditions, philosophy, flora and fauna that went on to influence Hinduism, Buddhism, Charvaka, Sramana and Jainism.\nThroughout Tamilakam, a king was considered to be divine by nature and possessed religious significance. The king was 'the representative of God on earth’ and lived in a “koyil”, which means the “residence of a god”. The Modern Tamil word for temple is koil. Titual worship was also given to kings. Modern words for god like “kō” (“king”), “iṟai” (“emperor”) and “āṇḍavar” ( “conqueror”) now primarily refer to gods. These elements were incorporated later into Hinduism like the legendary marriage of Shiva to Queen Mīnātchi who ruled Madurai or Wanji-ko, a god who later merged into Indra. Tolkappiyar refers to the Three Crowned Kings as the “Three Glorified by Heaven”. In the Dravidian-speaking South, the concept of divine kingship led to the assumption of major roles by state and temple.\n\nThe cult of the mother goddess is treated as an indication of a society which venerated femininity. This mother goddess was conceived as a virgin, one who has given birth to all and one, typically associated with Shaktism. The temples of the Sangam days, mainly of Madurai, seem to have had priestesses to the deity, which also appear predominantly a goddess. In the Sangam literature, there is an elaborate description of the rites performed by the Kurava priestess in the shrine Palamutircholai. Among the early Dravidians the practice of erecting memorial stones “Natukal\" or \"Hero Stone had appeared, and it continued for quite a long time after the Sangam age, down to about 16th century. It was customary for people who sought victory in war to worship these hero stones to bless them with victory.\n\nThe documented history of Indian religions begins with the historical Vedic religion, the religious practices of the early Indo-Aryans, which were collected and later redacted into the \"Samhitas\" (usually known as the Vedas), four canonical collections of hymns or mantras composed in archaic Sanskrit. These texts are the central \"shruti\" (revealed) texts of Hinduism. The period of the composition, redaction and commentary of these texts is known as the Vedic period, which lasted from roughly 1750 to 500 BCE.\n\nThe Vedic Period is most significant for the composition of the four Vedas, Brahmanas and the older Upanishads (both presented as discussions on the rituals, mantras and concepts found in the four Vedas), which today are some of the most important canonical texts of Hinduism, and are the codification of much of what developed into the core beliefs of Hinduism.\n\nSome modern Hindu scholars use the \"Vedic religion\" synonymously with \"Hinduism.\" According to Sundararajan, Hinduism is also known as the Vedic religion. Other authors state that the Vedas contain \"the fundamental truths about Hindu Dharma\" which is called \"the modern version of the ancient Vedic Dharma\" The Arya Samajis recognize the Vedic religion as true Hinduism. Nevertheless, according to Jamison and Witzel,\n\nThe rishis, the composers of the hymns of the Rigveda, were considered inspired poets and seers.\n\nThe mode of worship was the performance of Yajna, sacrifices which involved sacrifice and sublimation of the havana sámagri (herbal preparations) in the fire, accompanied by the singing of Samans and 'mumbling' of Yajus, the sacrificial mantras. The sublime meaning of the word yajna is derived from the Sanskrit verb yaj, which has a three-fold meaning of worship of deities (devapujana), unity (saògatikaraña) and charity (dána). An essential element was the sacrificial fire – the divine Agni – into which oblations were poured, as everything offered into the fire was believed to reach God.\n\nCentral concepts in the Vedas are Satya and Rta. \"Satya\" is derived from Sat, the present participle of the verbal root \"as\", \"to be, to exist, to live\". \"Sat\" means \"that which really exists [...] the really existent truth; the Good\", and \"Sat-ya\" means \"is-ness\". \"Rta\", \"that which is properly joined; order, rule; truth\", is the principle of natural order which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe and everything within it. \"Satya (truth as being) and rita (truth as law) are the primary principles of Reality and its manifestation is the background of the canons of dharma, or a life of righteousness.\" \"Satya is the principle of integration rooted in the Absolute, rita is its application and function as the rule and order operating in the universe.\" Conformity with Ṛta would enable progress whereas its violation would lead to punishment. Panikkar remarks:\nThe term rta is inherited from the Proto-Indo-Iranian religion, the religion of the Indo-Iranian peoples prior to the earliest Vedic (Indo-Aryan) and Zoroastrian (Iranian) scriptures. \"Asha\" is the Avestan language term (corresponding to Vedic language ṛta) for a concept of cardinal importance to Zoroastrian theology and doctrine. The term \"dharma\" was already used in Brahmanical thought, where it was conceived as an aspect of Rta.\n\nMajor philosophers of this era were Rishis Narayana, Kanva, Rishaba, Vamadeva, and Angiras.\n\nDuring the Middle Vedic period Rgveda X, the mantras of the Yajurveda and the older Brahmana texts were composed. The Brahmans became powerful intermediairies.\n\nHistorical roots of Jainism in India is traced back to 9th-century BC with the rise of Parshvanatha and his non-violent philosophy.\n\nThe Vedic religion evolved into Hinduism and Vedanta, a religious path considering itself the 'essence' of the Vedas, interpreting the Vedic pantheon as a unitary view of the universe with 'God' (Brahman) seen as immanent and transcendent in the forms of Ishvara and Brahman. This post-Vedic systems of thought, along with the Upanishads and later texts like epics (namely Gita of Mahabharat), is a major component of modern Hinduism. The ritualistic traditions of Vedic religion are preserved in the conservative Śrauta tradition.\n\nSince Vedic times, \"people from many strata of society throughout the subcontinent tended to adapt their religious and social life to Brahmanic norms\", a process sometimes called Sanskritization. It is reflected in the tendency to identify local deities with the gods of the Sanskrit texts.\n\nDuring the time of the shramanic reform movements \"many elements of the Vedic religion were lost\". According to Michaels, \"it is justified to see a turning point between the Vedic religion and Hindu religions\".\n\nThe late Vedic period (9th to 6th centuries BCE) marks the beginning of the Upanisadic or Vedantic period. This period heralded the beginning of much of what became classical Hinduism, with the composition of the Upanishads, later the Sanskrit epics, still later followed by the Puranas.\n\nUpanishads form the speculative-philosophical basis of classical Hinduism and are known as Vedanta (conclusion of the Vedas). The older Upanishads launched attacks of increasing intensity on the ritual. Anyone who worships a divinity other than the Self is called a domestic animal of the gods in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. The Mundaka launches the most scathing attack on the ritual by comparing those who value sacrifice with an unsafe boat that is endlessly overtaken by old age and death.\n\nScholars believe that Parsva, the 23rd Jain \"tirthankara\" lived during this period in the 9th century BCE.\n\nJainism and Buddhism belong to the sramana tradition. These religions rose into prominence in 700–500 BCE in the Magadha kingdom., reflecting \"the cosmology and anthropology of a much older, pre-Aryan upper class of northeastern India\", and were responsible for the related concepts of \"saṃsāra\" (the cycle of birth and death) and \"moksha\" (liberation from that cycle).\n\nThe shramana movements challenged the orthodoxy of the rituals. The shramanas were wandering ascetics distinct from Vedism. Mahavira, proponent of Jainism, and Buddha (c. 563-483), founder of Buddhism were the most prominent icons of this movement.\n\nShramana gave rise to the concept of the cycle of birth and death, the concept of samsara, and the concept of liberation. The influence of Upanishads on Buddhism has been a subject of debate among scholars. While Radhakrishnan, Oldenberg and Neumann were convinced of Upanishadic influence on the Buddhist canon, Eliot and Thomas highlighted the points where Buddhism was opposed to Upanishads. Buddhism may have been influenced by some Upanishadic ideas, it however discarded their orthodox tendencies. In Buddhist texts Buddha is presented as rejecting avenues of salvation as \"pernicious views\".\n\nJainism was established by a lineage of 24 enlightened beings culminating with Parsva (9th century BCE) and Mahavira (6th century BCE).\n\nThe 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, Mahavira, stressed five vows, including \"ahimsa\" (non-violence), \"satya\" (truthfulness), \"asteya\" (non-stealing) and \"aparigraha\" (non-attachment). Jain orthodoxy believes the teachings of the Tirthankaras predates all known time and scholars believe Parshva, accorded status as the 23rd Tirthankara, was a historical figure. The Vedas are believed to have documented a few Tirthankaras and an ascetic order similar to the shramana movement.\n\nBuddhism was historically founded by Siddhartha Gautama, a Kshatriya prince-turned-ascetic, and was spread beyond India through missionaries. It later experienced a decline in India, but survived in Nepal and Sri Lanka, and remains more widespread in Southeast and East Asia.\n\nGautama Buddha, who was called an \"awakened one\" (Buddha), was born into the Shakya clan living at Kapilavastu and Lumbini in what is now southern Nepal. The Buddha was born at Lumbini, as emperor Ashoka's Lumbini pillar records, just before the kingdom of Magadha (which traditionally is said to have lasted from c. 546–324 BCE) rose to power. The Shakyas claimed Angirasa and Gautama Maharishi lineage, via descent from the royal lineage of Ayodhya.\n\nBuddhism emphasises enlightenment (nibbana, nirvana) and liberation from the rounds of rebirth. This objective is pursued through two schools, Theravada, the Way of the Elders (practised in Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, SE Asia, etc.) and Mahayana, the Greater Way (practised in Tibet, China, Japan etc.). There may be some differences in the practice between the two schools in reaching the objective.\nIn the Theravada practice this is pursued in seven stages of purification (visuddhi); viz. physical purification by taking precepts (sila visiddhi), mental purification by insight meditation (citta visuddhi), followed by purification of views and concepts (ditthi visuddhi), purification by overcoming of doubts (kinkha vitarana vishuddhi), purification by acquiring knowledge and wisdom of the right path (maggarmagga-nanadasana visuddhi), attaining knowledge and wisdom through the course of practice (patipada-nanadasana visuddhi), and purification by attaining knowledge and insight wisdom (nanadasana visuddhi).\n\nBoth Jainism and Buddhism spread throughout India during the period of the Magadha empire.\n\nBuddhism in India spread during the reign of Ashoka of the Maurya Empire, who patronised Buddhist teachings and unified the Indian subcontinent in the 3rd century BCE. He sent missionaries abroad, allowing Buddhism to spread across Asia. Jainism began its golden period during the reign of Emperor Kharavela of Kalinga in the 2nd century BCE.\n\nFlood and Muesse take the period between 200 BCE and 500 BCE as a separate period, in which the epics and the first puranas were being written. Michaels takes a greater timespan, namely the period between 200 BCE and 1100 CE, which saw the rise of so-called \"Classical Hinduism\", with its \"golden age\" during the Gupta Empire.\nAccording to Alf Hiltebeitel, a period of consolidation in the development of Hinduism took place between the time of the late Vedic Upanishad (c. 500 BCE) and the period of the rise of the Guptas (c. 320–467 CE), which he calls the \"Hindus synthesis\", \"Brahmanic synthesis\", or \"orthodox synthesis\". It develops in interaction with other religions and peoples:\nThe end of the Vedantic period around the 2nd century CE spawned a number of branches that furthered Vedantic philosophy, and which ended up being seminaries in their own right. Prominent amongst these developers were Yoga, Dvaita, Advaita and the medieval Bhakti movement.\n\nThe \"smriti\" texts of the period between 200 BCE-100 CE proclaim the authority of the Vedas, and \"nonrejection of the Vedas comes to be one of the most important touchstones for defining Hinduism over and against the heterodoxies, which rejected the Vedas.\" Of the six Hindu darsanas, the Mimamsa and the Vedanta \"are rooted primarily in the Vedic \"sruti\" tradition and are sometimes called \"smarta\" schools in the sense that they develop \"smarta\" orthodox current of thoughts that are based, like \"smriti\", directly on \"sruti\".\" According to Hiltebeitel, \"the consolidation of Hinduism takes place under the sign of \"bhakti\".\" It is the \"Bhagavadgita\" that seals this achievement. The result is a universal achievement that may be called \"smarta\". It views Shiva and Vishnu as \"complementary in their functions but ontologically identical\".\n\nIn earlier writings, Sanskrit 'Vedānta' simply referred to the Upanishads, the most speculative and philosophical of the Vedic texts. However, in the medieval period of Hinduism, the word Vedānta came to mean the school of philosophy that interpreted the Upanishads. Traditional Vedānta considers scriptural evidence, or shabda pramāna, as the most authentic means of knowledge, while perception, or pratyaksa, and logical inference, or anumana, are considered to be subordinate (but valid).\n\nThe systematisation of Vedantic ideas into one coherent treatise was undertaken by Badarāyana in the Brahma Sutras which was composed around 200 BCE. The cryptic aphorisms of the Brahma Sutras are open to a variety of interpretations. This resulted in the formation of numerous Vedanta schools, each interpreting the texts in its own way and producing its own sub-commentaries.\n\nAfter 200 CE several schools of thought were formally codified in Indian philosophy, including Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mimāṃsā and Advaita Vedanta. Hinduism, otherwise a highly polytheistic, pantheistic or monotheistic religion, also tolerated atheistic schools. The thoroughly materialistic and anti-religious philosophical Cārvāka school that originated around the 6th century BCE is the most explicitly atheistic school of Indian philosophy. Cārvāka is classified as a \"nāstika\" (\"heterodox\") system; it is not included among the six schools of Hinduism generally regarded as orthodox. It is noteworthy as evidence of a materialistic movement within Hinduism. Our understanding of Cārvāka philosophy is fragmentary, based largely on criticism of the ideas by other schools, and it is no longer a living tradition. Other Indian philosophies generally regarded as atheistic include Samkhya and Mimāṃsā.\n\nTwo of Hinduism's most revered \"epics\", the Mahabharata and Ramayana were compositions of this period. Devotion to particular deities was reflected from the composition of texts composed to their worship. For example, the \"Ganapati Purana\" was written for devotion to Ganapati (or Ganesh). Popular deities of this era were Shiva, Vishnu, Durga, Surya, Skanda, and Ganesh (including the forms/incarnations of these deities).\n\nIn the latter Vedantic period, several texts were also composed as summaries/attachments to the Upanishads. These texts collectively called as Puranas allowed for a divine and mythical interpretation of the world, not unlike the ancient Hellenic or Roman religions. Legends and epics with a multitude of gods and goddesses with human-like characteristics were composed.\n\nThe Gupta period marked a watershed of Indian culture: the Guptas performed Vedic sacrifices to legitimize their rule, but they also patronized Buddhism, which continued to provide an alternative to Brahmanical orthodoxy. Buddhism continued to have a significant presence in some regions of India until the 12th century.\n\nThere were several Buddhistic kings who worshiped Vishnu, such as the Gupta Empire, Pala Empire, Malla Empire, Somavanshi, and Satavahana. Buddhism survived followed by Hindus.\n\nTantrism originated in the early centuries CE and developed into a fully articulated tradition by the end of the Gupta period. According to Michaels this was the \"Golden Age of Hinduism\" (c. 320–650 CE), which flourished during the Gupta Empire (320 to 550 CE) until the fall of the Harsha Empire (606 to 647 CE). During this period, power was centralised, along with a growth of far distance trade, standardizarion of legal procedures, and general spread of literacy. Mahayana Buddhism flourished, but the orthodox Brahmana culture began to be rejuvenated by the patronage of the Gupta Dynasty. The position of the Brahmans was reinforced, and the first Hindu temples emerged during the late Gupta age.\n\nAfter the end of the Gupta Empire and the collapse of the Harsha Empire, power became decentralised in India. Several larger kingdoms emerged, with \"countless vasal states\". The kingdoms were ruled via a feudal system. Smaller kingdoms were dependent on the protection of the larger kingdoms. \"The great king was remote, was exalted and deified\", as reflected in the Tantric Mandala, which could also depict the king as the centre of the mandala.\n\nThe disintegration of central power also lead to regionalisation of religiosity, and religious rivalry. Local cults and languages were enhanced, and the influence of \"Brahmanic ritualistic Hinduism\" was diminished. Rural and devotional movements arose, along with Shaivism, Vaisnavism, Bhakti and Tantra, though \"sectarian groupings were only at the beginning of their development\". Religious movements had to compete for recognition by the local lords. Buddhism lost its position, and began to disappear in India.\n\nIn the same period Vedanta changed, incorporating Buddhist thought and its emphasis on consciousness and the working of the mind. Buddhism, which was supported by the ancient Indian urban civilisation lost influence to the traditional religions, which were rooted in the countryside. In Bengal, Buddhism was even prosecuted. But at the same time, Buddhism was incorporated into Hinduism, when Gaudapada used Buddhist philosophy to reinterpret the Upanishads. This also marked a shift from Atman and Brahman as a \"living substance\" to \"maya-vada\", where Atman and Brahman are seen as \"pure knowledge-consciousness\". According to Scheepers, it is this \"maya-vada\" view which has come to dominate Indian thought.\n\nBetween 400 and 1000 CE Hinduism expanded as the decline of Buddhism in India continued. Buddhism subsequently became effectively extinct in India but survived in Nepal and Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Bhakti movement began with the emphasis on the worship of God, regardless of one's status – whether priestly or laypeople, men or women, higher social status or lower social status. The movements were mainly centered on the forms of Vishnu (Rama and Krishna) and Shiva. There were however popular devotees of this era of Durga. The best-known devotees are the Nayanars from southern India. The most popular Shaiva teacher of the south was Basava, while of the north it was Gorakhnath. Female saints include figures like Akkamadevi, Lalleshvari and Molla.\n\nThe \"alwar\" or \"azhwars\" (, \"āzvārkaḷ\" , those immersed in god) were Tamil poet-saints of south India who lived between the 6th and 9th centuries CE and espoused \"emotional devotion\" or bhakti to Visnu-Krishna in their songs of longing, ecstasy and service. The most popular Vaishnava teacher of the south was Ramanuja, while of the north it was Ramananda.\n\nSeveral important icons were women. For example, within the Mahanubhava sect, the women outnumbered the men, and administration was many times composed mainly of women. Mirabai is the most popular female saint in India.\n\nSri Vallabha Acharya (1479–1531) is a very important figure from this era. He founded the Shuddha Advaita (\"Pure Non-dualism\") school of Vedanta thought.\n\nAccording to \"The Centre for Cultural Resources and Training\",\n\nIn the 12th and 13th centuries, Turks and Afghans invaded parts of northern India and established the Delhi Sultanate in the former Rajput holdings. The subsequent Slave dynasty of Delhi managed to conquer large areas of northern India, approximately equal in extent to the ancient Gupta Empire, while the Khalji dynasty conquered most of central India but were ultimately unsuccessful in conquering and uniting the subcontinent. The Sultanate ushered in a period of Indian cultural renaissance. The resulting \"Indo-Muslim\" fusion of cultures left lasting syncretic monuments in architecture, music, literature, religion, and clothing.\n\nDuring the 14th to 17th centuries, a great \"Bhakti\" movement swept through central and northern India, initiated by a loosely associated group of teachers or \"Sants\". Ramananda, Ravidas, Srimanta Sankardeva, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Vallabha Acharya, Sur, Meera, Kabir, Tulsidas, Namdev, Dnyaneshwar, Tukaram and other mystics spearheaded the Bhakti movement in the North while Annamacharya, Bhadrachala Ramadas, Tyagaraja among others propagated Bhakti in the South. They taught that people could cast aside the heavy burdens of ritual and caste, and the subtle complexities of philosophy, and simply express their overwhelming love for God. This period was also characterized by a spate of devotional literature in vernacular prose and poetry in the ethnic languages of the various Indian states or provinces.\n\nLingayatism is a distinct Shaivite tradition in India, established in the 12th century by the philosopher and social reformer Basavanna.\nThe adherents of this tradition are known as Lingayats. The term is derived from Lingavantha in Kannada, meaning 'one who wears \"Ishtalinga\" on their body' (\"Ishtalinga\" is the representation of the God). In Lingayat theology, \"Ishtalinga\" is an oval-shaped emblem symbolising Parasiva, the absolute reality. Contemporary Lingayatism follows a progressive reform–based theology propounded, which has great influence in South India, especially in the state of Karnataka.\n\nAccording to Nicholson, already between the 12th and 16th century,\nThe tendency of \"a blurring of philosophical distinctions\" has also been noted by Burley. Lorenzen locates the origins of a distinct Hindu identity in the interaction between Muslims and Hindus, and a process of \"mutual self-definition with a contrasting Muslim other\", which started well before 1800. Both the Indian and the European thinkers who developed the term \"Hinduism\" in the 19th century were influenced by these philosophers.\n\nSikhism originated in 15th-century Punjab, Delhi Sultanate (present-day India and Pakistan) with the teachings of Nanak and nine successive gurus. The principal belief in Sikhism is faith in \"Vāhigurū\"— represented by the sacred symbol of \"ēk ōaṅkār\" [meaning one god]. Sikhism's traditions and teachings are distinctly associated with the history, society and culture of the Punjab. Adherents of Sikhism are known as Sikhs (\"students\" or \"disciples\") and number over 27 million across the world.\n\nAccording to Gavin Flood, the modern period in India begins with the first contacts with western nations around 1500. The period of Mughal rule in India saw the rise of new forms of religiosity.\n\nIn the 19th century, under influence of the colonial forces, a synthetic vision of Hinduism was formulated by Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Swami Vivekananda, Sri Aurobindo, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Mahatma Gandhi. These thinkers have tended to take an inclusive view of India's religious history, emphasising the similarities between the various Indian religions.\n\nThe modern era has given rise to dozens of Hindu saints with international influence. For example, Brahma Baba established the Brahma Kumaris, one of the largest new Hindu religious movements which teaches the discipline of Raja Yoga to millions. Representing traditional Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Prabhupada founded the Hare Krishna movement, another organisation with a global reach. In late 18th-century India, Swaminarayan founded the Swaminarayan Sampraday. Anandamurti, founder of the Ananda Marga, has also influenced many worldwide. Through the international influence of all of these new Hindu denominations, many Hindu practices such as yoga, meditation, mantra, divination, and vegetarianism have been adopted by new converts.\n\nJainism continues to be an influential religion and Jain communities live in Indian states Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Jains authored several classical books in different Indian languages for a considerable period of time.\n\nThe Dalit Buddhist movement also referred to as Navayana is a 19th- and 20th-century Buddhist revival movement in India. It received its most substantial impetus from B. R. Ambedkar's call for the conversion of Dalits to Buddhism in 1956 and the opportunity to escape the caste-based society that considered them to be the lowest in the hierarchy.\n\nAccording to Tilak, the religions of India can be interpreted \"differentially\" or \"integrally\", that is by either highlighting the differences or the similarities. According to Sherma and Sarma, western Indologists have tended to emphasise the differences, while Indian Indologists have tended to emphasise the similarities.\n\nHinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism share certain key concepts, which are interpreted differently by different groups and individuals. Until the 19th century, adherents of those various religions did not tend to label themselves as in opposition to each other, but \"perceived themselves as belonging to the same extended cultural family.\"\n\nHinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism share the concept of moksha, liberation from the cycle of rebirth. They differ however on the exact nature of this liberation.\n\nCommon traits can also be observed in ritual. The head-anointing ritual of \"abhiseka\" is of importance in three of these distinct traditions, excluding Sikhism (in Buddhism it is found within Vajrayana). Other noteworthy rituals are the cremation of the dead, the wearing of vermilion on the head by married women, and various marital rituals. In literature, many classical narratives and purana have Hindu, Buddhist or Jain versions. All four traditions have notions of \"karma\", \"dharma\", \"samsara\", \"moksha\" and various \"forms of Yoga\".\n\nRama is a heroic figure in all of these religions. In Hinduism he is the God-incarnate in the form of a princely king; in Buddhism, he is a Bodhisattva-incarnate; in Jainism, he is the perfect human being. Among the Buddhist Ramayanas are: \"Vessantarajataka\", Reamker, Ramakien, Phra Lak Phra Lam, Hikayat Seri Rama etc. There also exists the \"Khamti Ramayana\" among the Khamti tribe of Asom wherein Rama is an Avatar of a Bodhisattva who incarnates to punish the demon king Ravana (B.Datta 1993). The \"Tai Ramayana\" is another book retelling the divine story in Asom.\n\nCritics point out that there exist vast differences between and even within the various Indian religions. All major religions are composed of innumerable sects and subsects.\n\nFor a Hindu, \"dharma\" is his duty. For a Jain, \"dharma\" is righteousness, his conduct. For a Buddhist, \"dharma\" is usually taken to be the Buddha's teachings.\n\nIndian mythology also reflects the competition between the various Indian religions. A popular story tells how Vajrapani kills Mahesvara, a manifestation of Shiva depicted as an evil being. The story occurs in several scriptures, most notably the \"Sarvatathagatatattvasamgraha\" and the \"Vajrapany-abhiseka-mahatantra\". According to Kalupahana, the story \"echoes\" the story of the conversion of Ambattha. It is to be understood in the context of the competition between Buddhist institutions and Shaivism.\n\n\"Āstika\" and \"nāstika\" are variously defined terms sometimes used to categorise Indian religions. The traditional definition, followed by Adi Shankara, classifies religions and persons as \"āstika\" and \"nāstika\" according to whether they accept the authority of the main Hindu texts, the Vedas, as supreme revealed scriptures, or not. By this definition, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga, Purva Mimamsa and Vedanta are classified as \"āstika\" schools, while Charvaka is classified as a \"nāstika\" school. Buddhism and Jainism are also thus classified as \"nāstika\" religions since they do not accept the authority of the Vedas.\n\nAnother set of definitions—notably distinct from the usage of Hindu philosophy—loosely characterise \"āstika\" as \"theist\" and \"nāstika\" as \"atheist\". By these definitions, \"Sāṃkhya\" can be considered a \"nāstika\" philosophy, though it is traditionally classed among the Vedic \"āstika\" schools. From this point of view, Buddhism and Jainism remain \"nāstika\" religions.\n\nBuddhists and Jains have disagreed that they are nastika and have redefined the phrases āstika and nāstika in their own view. Jains assign the term nastika to one who is ignorant of the meaning of the religious texts, or those who deny the existence of the soul was well known to the Jainas.\n\nFrawley and Malhotra use the term \"Dharmic traditions\" to highlight the similarities between the various Indian religions. According to Frawley, \"all religions in India have been called the Dharma\", and can be\nAccording to Paul Hacker, as described by Halbfass, the term \"dharma\"\nThe emphasis on the similarities and integral unity of the dharmic faiths has been criticised for neglecting the vast differences between and even within the various Indian religions and traditions. According to Richard E. King it is typical of the \"inclusivist appropriation of other traditions\" of Neo-Vedanta:\nThe \"Council of Dharmic Faiths\" (UK) regards Zoroastrianism, whilst not originating in the Indian subcontinent, also as a Dharmic religion.\n\nThe inclusion of Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs within Hinduism is part of the Indian legal system. The 1955 Hindu Marriage Act \"[defines] as Hindus all Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs and anyone who is not a Christian, Muslim, Parsee (Zoroastrian) or Jew\". And the Indian Constitution says that \"reference to Hindus shall be construed as including a reference to persons professing the Sikh, Jaina or Buddhist religion\".\n\nIn a judicial reminder, the Indian Supreme Court observed Sikhism and Jainism to be sub-sects or \"special\" faiths within the larger Hindu fold, and that Jainism is a denomination within the Hindu fold. Although the government of British India counted Jains in India as a major religious community right from the first Census conducted in 1873, after independence in 1947 Sikhs and Jains were not treated as national minorities. In 2005 the Supreme Court of India declined to issue a writ of Mandamus granting Jains the status of a religious minority throughout India. The Court however left it to the respective states to decide on the minority status of Jain religion.\n\nHowever, some individual states have over the past few decades differed on whether Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs are religious minorities or not, by either pronouncing judgments or passing legislation. One example is the judgment passed by the Supreme Court in 2006, in a case pertaining to the state of Uttar Pradesh, which declared Jainism to be indisputably distinct from Hinduism, but mentioned that, \"The question as to whether the Jains are part of the Hindu religion is open to debate. However, the Supreme Court also noted various court cases that have held Jainism to be a distinct religion.\n\nAnother example is the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Bill, that is an amendment to a legislation that sought to define Jains and Buddhists as denominations within Hinduism. Ultimately on 31 July 2007, finding it not in conformity with the concept of freedom of religion as embodied in Article 25 (1) of the Constitution, Governor Naval Kishore Sharma returned the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2006 citing the widespread protests by the Jains as well as Supreme Court's extrajudicial observation that Jainism is a \"special religion formed on the basis of quintessence of Hindu religion by the Supreme Court\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1186383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1186383", "title": "Islam in Nigeria", "text": "Islam in Nigeria\n\nNigeria has the largest Muslim population in West Africa. The CIA estimates 50% while the BBC estimates slightly over 50% (2007). Muslims in Nigeria are predominantly Sunni of the Maliki school of thought. However, there is a significant Shia minority, primarily in Kaduna, Kano, Katsina and Sokoto states; (see Shia in Nigeria). A smaller minority follow the Ahmadiyya, a reformatory sect originating in 19th-century India. In particular Pew Forum on religious diversity identifies 12 percent as Shia Muslims.\n\nIslam was first documented in Nigeria in the 9th century. Religious archives showed Islam had been adopted as the religion of the majority of the leading figures in the Borno Empire during the reign of Mai (king) Idris Alooma (1571–1603), although a large part of that country still adhered to traditional religions. Alooma furthered the cause of Islam in the country by introducing Islamic courts, establishing mosques, and setting up a hostel in Makkah, the Islamic pilgrimage destination, for Kanuris. It had spread to the major cities of the northern part of the country by the 16th century, later moving into the countryside and towards the Middle Belt uplands. However, there are some claims for an earlier arrival. The Nigeria-born Muslim scholar Sheikh Dr. Abu-Abdullah Abdul-Fattah Adelabu has argued that Islam had reached Sub-Sahara Africa, including Nigeria, as early as the 1st century of Hijrah through Muslim traders and expeditions during the reign of the Arab conqueror, Uqba ibn al Nafia (622–683), whose Islamic conquests under the Umayyad dynasty, during Muawiyah's and Yazid's time, spread all Northern Africa or the Maghrib Al-Arabi, which includes present-day Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Morocco.\n\nIslam also came to the southwestern Yoruba-speaking areas during the time of the Mali Empire. In his Movements of Islam in face of the Empires and Kingdoms in Yorubaland, Sheikh Dr. Abu-Abdullah Adelabu supported his claims on early arrival of Islam in the southwestern Nigeria by citing the Arab anthropologist Abduhu Badawi, who argued that the fall of Koush southern Egypt and the prosperity of the politically multicultural Abbasid period in the continent had created several streams of migration, moving west in the mid-9th Sub-Sahara. According to Adelabu, the popularity and influences of the Abbasid Dynasty, the second great dynasty with the rulers carrying the title of 'Caliph' fostered peaceful and prosperous search of pastures by the inter-cultured Muslims from Nile to Niger and Arab traders from Desert to Benue, echoing the conventional historical view that the conquest of North Africa by the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate between AD 647–709 effectively ended Catholicism in Africa for several centuries. Islam in Ancient Yoruba is referred to as Esin Imale (religion of the malians) as the earliest introduction of the religion to that region was through Malian itinerant traders (Wangara Traders) around the 14th century. Large-scale conversion to Islam happened in the 17th century.\n\nYorubas came in contact with Islam around the 14th century during the reign of Mansa Kankan Musa of the Mali Empire. According to Al-Aluri, the first Mosque was built in Ọyọ-Ile in AD 1550 although, there were no Yoruba Muslims, the Mosque only served the spiritual needs of foreign Muslims living in Ọyọ. Progressively, Islam came to Yoruba land, and Muslims started building Mosques: Iwo town led, its first Mosque built in 1655 followed by Iṣẹyin, in 1760; Lagos, 1774; Ṣaki, 1790; and Oṣogbo, 1889. In time, Islam spread to other towns like Oyo (the first Oyo convert was Solagberu), Ibadan, Abẹokuta, Ijẹbu-Ode, Ikirun, and Ẹdẹ before the 18th century Sokoto jihad. Several factors contributed to the rise of Islam in Yoruba land by mid 19th century. Before the decline of Ọyọ, several towns around it had large Muslim communities, unfortunately, when Ọyọ was destroyed, these Muslims (Yoruba and immigrants) relocated to newly formed towns and villages and became Islam protagonists. Second, there was a mass movement of people at this time into Yoruba land, many of these immigrants were Muslims who introduced Islam to their host. According to Eades, the religion \"differed in attraction\" and \"better adapted to Yoruba social structure, because it permitted polygamy\"; more influential Yorubas like (Seriki Kuku of Ijebu land) soon became Muslims with positive impact on the natives. Islam came to Lagos at about the same time like other Yoruba towns, however, it received royal support from Ọba Kosọkọ, after he came back from exile in Ẹpẹ. According to Gbadamọṣi (1972; 1978 in Eades, 1980) Islam soon spread to other Yoruba towns, especially, during the intra-tribal wars-when there was a high demand for Islamic teachers-who dubbed as both Koran teachers and amulet makers for Yoruba soldiers during the intra-tribal wars in Yoruba land. Islam, like Christianity also found a common ground with the natives that believed in Supreme Being, while there were some areas of disagreements, Islamic teachers impressed upon their audience the need to change from worshipping idols and embrace Allah. Without delay, Islamic scholars and local Imams started establishing Koranic centers to teach Arabic and Islamic studies, much later, conventional schools were established to educate new converts and to propagate Islam. Islamic religion no doubt, impacted Yoruba culture significantly, according to Ahmad Faosy Ogunbado, \"Ifa (oracle) consultation is Islamized to Istikhara (inquires prayer). Celebration of oriṣa festival is transformed or replaced with celebrating eid-el-fitri and eid-el-kabir.\" Women and men outlook is modified as polygamy is curtailed or modified into \"four at a time\" while prefixed oriṣa names were changed to \"Olu\" (Ọlọrun) plus Bunmi, becomes Ọlọrunbunmi. Traditional shrines and ritual sites were replaced with Central Mosques in major Yoruba town and cities.\n\nIn the early 19th century, Islamic scholar Usman dan Fodio launched a jihad, which is called the Fulani War, against the Hausa Kingdoms of Northern Nigeria. He was victorious, and established the Fulani Empire with it's capital at Sokoto.\n\nA fringe and heretical group, led by Quranist cleric Mohammed Marwa Maitatsine, started in Kano in the late 1970s and operated throughout the 1980s. Maitatsine (since deceased) was from Cameroon, and claimed to have had divine revelations superseding those of the Prophet Muhammad. With their own mosques and a doctrine antagonistic to established Islamic and societal leadership, its main appeal was to marginal and poverty-stricken urban in-migrants, whose rejection by the more established urban groups fostered this religious opposition. These disaffected adherents ultimately lashed out at the more traditional mosques and congregations, resulting in violent outbreaks in several cities of the north.\n\nNon-sectarian Muslims who reject the authority of hadith, known as Quranists, Quraniyoon, or 'Yan Kala Kato, are also present in Nigeria. 'Yan Kala Kato is often mistaken for a militant group called Yan Tatsine (also known as Maitatsine), an unrelated group founded by Muhammadu Marwa. Marwa was killed in 1980. Marwa's successor, Musa Makaniki, was arrested in 2004 and sentenced in 2006, but later released. And another leader of Yan Tatsine, Malam Badamasi, was killed in 2009. Notable Nigerian Quranists include Islamic scholars Mallam Saleh Idris Bello, Malam Isiyaka Salisu, and Nigerian High Court Judge Isa Othman.\n\nTwo features of Islam essentially concern its place in Nigerian society. They are the degree to which Islam permeates other institutions in the society, and its contribution to Nigerian pluralism. As an institution in emirate society, Islam includes daily and annual ritual obligations; the \"hajj\", or pilgrimage to Mecca; \"sharia\", or religious law; and an establishment view of politics, family life, communal order, and appropriate modes of personal conduct in most situations.\n\nThus, even in 1990, Islam pervaded daily life. Public meetings began and ended with Muslim prayer, and everyone knew at least the minimum Arabic prayers and the five pillars of the religion required for full participation. Public adjudication (by local leaders with the help of religious experts, or Alkali courts) provided widespread knowledge of the basic tenets of \"sharia\" law—the Sunni school of law according to Malik ibn Anas was that primarily followed.\n\nAir transport has made the \"hajj\" more widely available. Upper-income groups went several times and sent or took their wives as well.\n\nSheikh Adelabu has claimed an even greater influence of Islam in Nigeria. He cited Arabic words used in Nigerian languages, especially Yoruba and Hausa names of the days such as Atalata (Ar. Ath-Thulatha الثلاثاء) for Tuesday, Alaruba (Ar. Al-Arbi'a الأربعاء) for Wednesday, Alamisi (Ar. Al-Khamis الخميس) for Thursday, and Jimoh (Ar. Al-Jum'ah الجمعة) for Friday. By far Ojo Jimoh is the most favourably used. It is usually preferred to the unpleasant Yoruba word for Friday Eti, which means Failure, Laziness or Abandonment. Maintaining that the wide adoption of Islamic faith and traditions has succeeded to lay impacts both on written and spoken Nigerian vernaculars, Sheikh Adelabu asserted nearly all technical terms and cultural usages of Hausa and Fulani were derived from Islamic heritages, citing a long list of Hausa words adopted from Arabic. In furthering supports for his claims, Sheikh Adelabu gave the following words to be Yoruba's derivatives of Arabic vocabularies:\n\nNigerian Islam is not highly organized. Reflecting the aristocratic nature of the traditional ruling groups, there were families of clerics whose male heirs trained locally and abroad in theology and jurisprudence and filled major positions in the mosques and the judiciary. These \"ulama\", or learned scholars, had for centuries been the religious and legal advisers of emirs, the titled nobility, and the wealthy trading families in the major cities. Ordinary people could consult the myriads of would-be and practicing clerics in various stages of training, who studied with local experts, functioned at rites of passage, or simply used their religious education to gain increased \"blessedness\" for their efforts.\n\nSufi brotherhoods, a form of religious order based on more personal or mystical relations to the supernatural, were widespread, especially in the major cities. There the two predominant ones, Qadiriyah and Tijaniyah, had separate mosques and, in a number of instances, a parochial school system receiving grants from the state. The brotherhoods played a major role in the spread of Islam in the northern area and the middle belt.\n\nSa'adu Abubakar, the 20th Sultan of Sokoto, is considered the spiritual leader of Nigeria's Muslims.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "42835048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42835048", "title": "Jīvaka", "text": "Jīvaka\n\nJīvaka (; ) was the personal physician () of the Buddha and the Indian King Bimbisāra. He lived in Rājagṛha, present-day Rajgir, in the 6th5th century BCE. Sometimes described as the \"Medicine King\" (), he figures prominently in legendary accounts in Asia as a model healer, and is honoured as such by traditional healers in several Asian countries.\n\nAccounts about Jīvaka can be found in Early Buddhist Texts in many textual traditions such as the Pāli and Mūlasarvāstivāda traditions, as well as later Buddhist discourses and devotional Avadāna texts. Textual traditions agree that Jīvaka was born as a foundling child of a courtesan, but the texts do not agree who this courtesan was, nor who the father was. Regardless, Jīvaka is found and raised by people from the royal court of King Bimbisāra. As he grows up, Jīvaka decides to travel to Takṣaśilā, to learn traditional medicine from a well-respected teacher. He turns out to be a promising student, and after seven years, starts his healing profession in Rājagṛha. His medical feats gain him a reputation and he is quickly appointed as the personal physician of King Bimbisāra and the Buddha. As he gets into contact with the Buddha more, he develops faith in Buddhism and becomes an important supporter of the religion, building a monastery in the process. Later, Bimbisāra is killed by his son Ajātaśatru, who usurps the throne. Eventually, Jīvaka is instrumental in bringing him to see the Buddha, to whom the new king repents his evil deeds.\n\nIn the texts, Jīvaka is depicted performing complicated medical procedures, including procedures that could be interpreted as brain surgery. Scholars are in debate to which extent these depictions have historical value. Regardless, Jīvaka is honoured throughout Asia by Buddhists, and to some extent by healers outside of Buddhism, as a model physician and Buddhist saint. Several medieval medical texts and procedures in India and China are attributed to him. Up until the present day, Jīvaka is honoured by Indians and Thai as a patron of traditional medicine, and he has a central role in all ceremonies involving Thai traditional medicine. Furthermore, Jīvaka's legendary persona has had an important role in helping to proselytise and legitimise Buddhism, as some of the detail of Jīvaka's accounts were adjusted to fit the local milieus in which they were passed on. Jīvaka's monastery was identified by the Chinese pilgrim Xuan Zang in the 7th century, and it was excavated in the 19th century. Presently, it is one of the oldest Buddhist monasteries with archaeological remains still in existence.\n\nThe life of Jīvaka exists in several early Buddhist textual traditions, that is, in Pāli language, Chinese (from the Dharmaguptaka, Mahīśāsaka and Sarvāstivāda traditions, all translated from Indic texts in 5th century CE), Tibetan (Mūlasarvāstivāda) and Sanskrit texts. Jīvaka's story can be found in the texts of monastic discipline (Pāli and ) of which the oldest stratum can be dated back to the first half of 4th century BCE. This stratum includes rules and regulations about medicine, also relating the life and work of Jīvaka, and can be found in various textual traditions.\n\nFurthermore, in the Chinese canon of Buddhist scriptures, two separate discourses () can be found that are not part of the Vinaya, titled the \"Āmrapāli and Jīvaka Sūtra\" (known as T. 554) and the similarly titled \"Āmrapāli and Jīvaka \"Avadāna\" Sūtra\" (T. 553). The latter two discourses originate from before the 5th century CE and between 7th and 10th century respectively, both translated from a Sanskrit or Central Asian source. Traditionally, the two translations were attributed to An Shigao (148180 CE), but this was probably an attempt to make them look more ancient and legitimate. Salguero argues that they were probably based on a translation made by Zhu Fahu (233±308 CE), as well as early Vinaya and 5th-century apocryphal material. Whereas the Vinaya accounts are intended for a monastic audience, the two \"Jīvaka Sūtras\" appear to be more popular versions of the account, meant for a wider lay audience. The T. 554 \"sūtra\" most likely incorporated and sometimes replaced the early Vinaya accounts in the Mahīśāsaka and Sarvāstivāda canons, some of which have hardly been passed down as part of the Vinaya, and can therefore only be found within that \"sūtra\". The other T. 553 \"sūtra\" is most likely based on the T. 554, but has been expanded using material from the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya.\n\nBesides these sources, several Avadāna texts also contain accounts about Jīvaka. There are also numerous references to him in Indian literature that is not Buddhist, such as the Māṭharavṛtti, a commentary to the Sāṃkhyasūtra, and the satirical poems of Kṣemendra, the 11th-century Kashmiri poet.\n\nHistorians Kenneth Zysk and C. Pierce Salguero have compared the different recensions of the story and have argued that none of them are the original text, and thus the original narrative cannot be known. Instead, they argue that the different narratives were adjusted to fit with local traditions. For example, Salguero argues that the medieval \"Jīvaka Sūtras\" that are not part of the Vinaya were written based on much indigenous knowledge of Chinese medicine: some of the healing methods Jīvaka uses, both in the \"Jīvaka Sūtras\" and the Vinaya texts, are more Chinese than Indian, and many motifs in his biography are drawn from legends of other famous Chinese physicians. Zysk notes that the Pāli recension is more practical, whereas the traditions influenced by Mahāyāna teachings deploy more magical and miraculous motifs. He also observes that the Tibetan and Sanskrit accounts depict more treatments that appear traditional Indian (Āyurveda) in nature. Each recension has its own regional character in understanding the diseases and having Jīvaka heal them, although there are also many similarities.\n\nThere are significant differences in how Jīvaka's early life is rendered according to the different textual traditions. In what appears to be the earliest version of the narrative, Jīvaka is described as a foundling discarded by a courtesan with no royal blood, which is later found and raised in the court by Prince Abhaya. In later versions, the story has been embellished to appeal to a wider audience, as Jīvaka's mother is identified with the courtesan of divine origin and Buddhist disciple Āmrapāli, and the previously unnamed father becomes none other than King Bimbisāra. Furthermore, some versions of the story, the Sanskrit and Tibetan version and the \"Jīvaka Sūtras\", attempt to show that Jīvaka is the real \"Medicine King\", a title used for other legendary healers such as the Chinese healers Bian Que and Hua Tuo. Many motifs in these accounts point in this direction: for example, the \"Jīvaka Sūtras\" state that Jīvaka is born with acupuncture needles and herbs in his hand, which is used as proof that Jīvaka is superior above other Chinese healers. In the Sanskrit and Tibetan version, Jīvaka is recognised and named the \"Medicine King\" by the court up unto three times, whenever he performs a miraculous feat of medicine. He is therefore also described as the \"Thrice-crowned Physician\".\n\nTexts from the earliest, Pāli tradition, as well as the Chinese Dharmaguptaka Vinaya and the T. 553 \"sūtra\", describe that Jīvaka is born in Rājagṛha (present-day Rajgir) as a child of a courtesan (; in the Pāli and Dharmaguptaka canons this is not Āmrapāli, but Salāvatī), who has him discarded on a trash heap by a slave. He is later seen by a prince called Abhaya, son of King Bimbisāra, who asks whether the child is still alive (). When the people respond that it is, he decides to raise him and names him \"he who is alive\", for having survived the ordeal. The Pāli, Tibetan and Sanskrit traditions explain that his second name becomes \"Komārabhacca\", because he is raised by a prince (), but scholars have suggested the name is more likely related to the Kaumārabhṛtya: ancient Indian obstetrics and pediatrics, one of the eight branches of the Āyurveda. As he grows up, Jīvaka learns about his humble origins, and determines to find himself good education to compensate for his background. Without Prince Abhaya's knowledge, he goes to learn medicine at an ancient place of learning called Takṣaśilā (what the Greeks called Taxila), presently identified with a city in Islamabad, Pakistan.\n\nSanskrit texts and early Tibetan translations in the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition state that Jīvaka is born as an illegitimate child of King Bimbisāra and a merchant's wife, who in the Chinese \"Jīvaka Sūtras\" is identified with the courtesan Āmrapāli. In the Sanskrit and Tibetan recension however, the wife of the merchant remains unnamed, whereas Āmrapāli is considered to be the mother of Prince Abhaya instead of Jīvaka. The Sanskrit and Tibetan texts, as well the T. 554 \"sūtra\", explain that the king has had an illicit affair with the wife and later she informs him that she is pregnant. The king tells the mother that if the child should turn out male, she should bring it to him to be raised in the court. When it is born, she has the child placed in front of the palace in a chest. The king has the chest brought in and asks whether the child is still alive. When his servants respond that it is, he calls it \"he who is alive\" (Sanskrit and ). The king has the child raised in the court by a certain Zho-nu Jigmed, and in the court his interest in medicine is sparked when he sees some \"vaidyas\" (physicians) visit. He therefore decides to train as a physician in Takṣaśilā. In the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya and the Chinese \"Jīvaka Sūtras\", Jīvaka considers his medical teachers in the court inferior and demonstrates his superior medical knowledge, after which he decides to further his studies in Takṣaśilā.\n\nTexts in the Chinese tradition relate that Jīvaka is a prince in a kingdom in Central India. When the king dies, his younger brother prepares an army to battle Jīvaka. But Jīvaka says to his brother that he has not much interest in the throne, because his mind is focused on the Buddha instead. He exposes his chest, showing a Buddha image engraved on his heart. The younger brother is impressed and calls off his army. Because of this story, Jīvaka is called the 'Heart-exposing Arhat' ().\n\nIn all versions of the story, Jīvaka gives up his claim to the throne to study in Takṣaśilā. He is probably sixteen when he goes there.\n\nHe is trained for seven years in Takṣaśilā by a \"ṛṣi\" (seer) called Ātreya Punarvasu, which Tibetan texts say used to be the physician of Bimbisāra's father. During that time, Takṣaśilā was under Achaemenid rule, following the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley circa 515 BCE. The Takṣaśilā in the time of Jīvaka was probably populated by Persians, Greeks and many ethnicities coming from the various parts of the Achaemenid Empire. Thus, the renowned university enabled him to benefit from exchange with people from various cultures.\n\nJīvaka learns the classical Āyurvedic medical treatises of the time, such as the Caraka Saṃhitā (attributed to Ātreya) and the Suśruta Saṃhitā, although some later treatments of Jīvaka also point at other medieval traditions of knowledge. Ātreya helps Jīvaka build up his observation skills. Jīvaka becomes known for his powers of observation, as depicted in many stories. In one account, Jīvaka looks at the footprint of an elephant and is able to describe the rider of the elephant in great detail, just basing himself on the elephants's footprint. Tibetan texts do state that Jīvaka suffers from jealous fellow-students, however, who accuse Ātreya of favouring him, because he is from the court. In the Pāli and Chinese version of the story, Ātreya then sends Jīvaka and his fellow pupils to look for any plant in the forest that does not have medicinal qualities. Jīvaka returns disappointed, however, telling Ātreya that he could not find a single plant of which he did not recognise its medicinal qualities. When Ātreya is satisfied with his progress, he gives him a bit of money and sends him off, but not before acknowledging him as his next successor.\n\nIn the Sanskrit and Tibetan recensions, however, the test of the forest is done before accepting Jīvaka in Takṣaśila, as opposed to the exam at the end of his studies. After Jīvaka passes the test, is admitted and learns at the centre for several years, he starts to demonstrate his medical superiority and is recognised as such by Ātreya. He finishes his studies with Ātreya and continues his studies at the city of Bhadraṅkara in Vidarbha, where he studies the textbook called the \"Sarvabhūtaruta\", which may refer to a book about magical chants and dharanis. After that, he travels further and comes in possession of a miraculous object that helps him to see through the human body and discover any ailments. In this account, which can also be found in the \"Jīvaka Sūtras\", Jīvaka comes across a man carrying wooden sticks. In some accounts, the man seems to suffer terribly because of the effect of the wooden sticks, being emaciated and sweating; in other accounts, the wooden sticks which the man carries allow any by-passers to see through his back. Regardless, Jīvaka buys the sticks and finds that, according to most of the Chinese texts, one of the sticks originates from a miraculous \"Medicine King Tree\" (): the tree of Bhaiṣajrayājan, who later Mahāyāna texts would describe as a \"bodhisattva\", a Buddha-to-be, focused on healing. The Tibetan and Sanskrit version, however, relate that it is a gem hidden between the sticks which is the source of the miracles. Regardless, the miraculous object enables him to see through his patients' bodies and diagnose their illnesses, as the object \"illuminates his inside as a lamp lights up a house\". These accounts may have led to a myth about an ancient \"ultrasound probe\", as imagined in medieval Buddhist kingdoms of Asia.\n\nAccording to the Pāli texts, on his way back to Rājagṛha, Jīvaka needs money for his travelling expenses, so he is forced to start working in Sāketa. A rich merchant () asks for help for his wife, but since many physicians failed to heal her, Jīvaka is reluctant and states that he will ask for no fee if his treatment is unsuccessful. He successfully treats her though, and is rewarded generously. After his return in Rājagṛha, he gives his first earnings to Prince Abhaya, who refuses these but has Jīvaka work in the palace. He quickly becomes wealthy because of his service to influential patients, including King Bimbisāra. Although he receives good payments from his wealthy customers, the texts state he also treats poor patients for free. When King Bimibisāra suffers from an anal fistula, he calls upon the help of Jīvaka. As the king was bleeding through his rectum, his female servants made fun of him, saying that he was bleeding \"like us women\". After curing the king of his fistula, the king appoints him as his personal physician and as a personal physician to the Buddha.\n\nJīvaka is depicted healing a misplacement of intestines, performing an operation of trepanning on a patient, removing an intracranial mass and performing nose surgery. In T. 553, as well as in the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, he heals a \"disease of the head\" by treating the patient with ghee through the nose, and he is depicted in Pāli texts as performing laparotomy, removing post-traumatic volvulus and a cesarean section on patients under some form of anaesthesia. This and some other descriptions of Jīvaka's medical procedures follow the protocol of the Suśruta and Charaka Saṃhitās closely. The \"Jīvaka Sūtras\" describe that he also performs acupuncture, but this must have been a Chinese interpolation in the narrative, since this was Chinese, not Indian practice.\n\nIn a more psychological case, Jīvaka treats another \"seṭṭhī\", this time with a brain condition. After having performed brain surgery, he tells the patient to lie still on the right side for seven years, on the left side for another seven years and on his back for yet another seven years. The patient lies on each side for seven days and cannot lie still for longer, standing up from his sleeping place. He confesses this to Jīvaka, who reveals to him that he ordered him seven years on each side just to persuade him to complete the full seven days on each side.\n\nIn another case described in the Mūlasarvāstivāda texts, King Bimbisāra lends Jīvaka to King Pradyota (), the King of Ujjeni, to heal his jaundice. Jīvaka knows through the power of his magical wood that Pradyota is poisoned by a snake and can only be healed by using ghee, which Pradyota hates. Praydyota is prone to anger and Jīvaka is in doubt whether he should try to heal him. Consulting the Buddha, the Buddha says that Jīvaka took a vow in a previous life that he would heal people's bodies, whereas the Buddha had taken a vow that he would heal people's mindsJīvaka the decides to attempt to heal the king. Therefore, Jīvaka gives a decoction to the king containing ghee, without him being aware. Anticipating the king's response, Jīvaka flees the palace on one of the king's elephants. When King Pradyota becomes furious as Jīvaka expected, he sends one of his servants to catch and bring back Jīvaka. The servant catches up with Jīvaka, but as they are eating, Jīvaka secretly serves him a strong purgative. By the time they manage to get back to the palace, King Pradyota is healed and no longer angry, rewarding Jīvaka generously for healing him. In the Pāli version, he rewards him by giving him an expensive cloth, which Jīvaka then offers to the Buddha; in the Mūlasarvāstivāda version, the king rewards Jīvaka by listening to the teaching of the Buddha, the only payment Jīvaka accepts.\n\nAccounts in medieval Japanese and Chinese literature depict Jīvaka offering baths to the Buddha and dedicating the religious merit to all sentient beings. The story was used in East Asian societies to promote the medicinal and ritual value of bathing, emphasizing the benefits of offering such benefits to the monastic community as a form of \"medical karma\".\n\nSome scholars have pointed to accounts about Jīvaka as evidence of ancient medical practices, with medical historians Thomas and Peter Chen stating that \"[i]t is likely that the salient events of Jivaka's life and his medical feats are authentic\" and analysing some of Jīvaka's procedures from a viewpoint of scientific medical practice. Salguero is more skeptical, however, and argues that \"[m]edical legends simply cannot be considered evidence of medical practice\".\n\nPāli texts often describe Jīvaka giving treatments to the Buddha for several ailments, such as when the Buddha has a cold, and when he is hurt after an attempt on his life by the rebellious monk Devadatta. The latter happened at a park called Maddakucchi, where Devadatta hurls a rock at the Buddha from a cliff. Although the rock is stopped by another rock midway, a splinter hits the Buddha's foot and causes him to bleed, but Jīvaka heals the Buddha. Jīvaka sometimes forgets to finish certain treatments, however. In such cases, the Buddha knows the healer's mind and finishes the treatment himself. Jīvaka tries to heal the Buddha using only objects that are regarded as reverential, such as parts of the lotus flower instead of herbs from trees. Tibetan texts state that Jīvaka very often checks up on the Buddha, up to three times a day. Jīvaka not only cares for the Buddha, but also expresses concern for the monastic community, at one point suggesting the Buddha that he has the monks exercise more often.\n\nApart from his role as a healer, Jīvaka also develops an interest in the Buddha's teachings. One Pāli text is named after Jīvaka: the \"Jīvaka Sutta\". In this discourse, Jīvaka inquires about how to be a good lay devotee. He also specifically asks why the Buddha eats meat. The Buddha responds that a monk is only allowed to eat meat if the animal is not killed especially for himapart from that, meat is allowed. He continues by saying that a monk cannot be choosy about the food he is consuming, but should receive and eat food dispassionately, just to sustain his health. The discourse inspires Jīvaka, who decides to dedicate himself as a Buddhist lay person. The Tibetan tradition has another version of Jīvaka's conversion: Jīvaka's pride that he thinks he is the best physician in the world obstructs him from accepting the Buddha. The Buddha sends Jīvaka to legendary places to find ingredients, and finally Jīvaka discovers there is still a lot he does not know yet about medicine, and it turns out that the Buddha knows a lot more. When Jīvaka accepts the Buddha as \"the supreme of physicians\", he is more receptive to the Buddha's teachings and the Buddha starts teaching him. Jīvaka takes upon himself the five moral precepts.\n\nPāli texts relate that Jīvaka later attains the state of \"śrotāpanna\", a state preceding enlightenment. Having accomplished this, he starts to visit the Buddha twice a week. Since he has to travel quite far for that often, he decides to donate a mango grove close to Rājagṛha and builds a monastery there. The monastery is used by monks during the yearly rains retreat. Later on, Jīvaka is the first layman recorded to offer robes to Buddhist monks. It was probably out of health considerations that Jīvaka offered the robes, since before that time, Buddhist monks would usually sew their robes together from pieces of rag left behind, or from corpses, which was less hygienic. At the time of Jīvaka's gift of robes, the Buddha was ill and this illness could be related to lack of hygiene. On a similar note, Jīvaka is described to donate robes made of woollen material, to be used in the winter.\n\nAt the end period of the Buddha's ministry, King Bimbisāra is imprisoned by his son Ajātaśatru, who usurps the throne. Attempting to starve his own father, Ajātaśatru hears that his mother tries to prevent Bimbisāra from starving. According to the Mūlasarvāstivāda texts, Ajātaśatru nearly kills his mother out of anger, but is stopped by Jīvaka and a minister, who warn him that he will be considered a casteless outcast () if he kills his own mother. Later on, Bimbisāra does starve and die. Ajātaśatru develops a tumour after his father's death, and asks Jīvaka to heal it. Jīvaka says he needs the meat of a child to heal the tumour. As Ajātaśatru is planning to eat a child, he remembers that he killed his father. When he thinks about the killing of his father, the tumour disappears. Ajātaśatru becomes ashamed of what he has done. Eventually, Jīvaka manages to bring Ajātaśatru to see the Buddha to repent his misdeeds. In the Mūlasarvastivāda texts, this happens after Jīvaka raises examples of other evil people that could still be saved despite their misdeeds, and after Jīvaka reminds Ajātaśatru that the Buddha is at the end of his life. In the Mahāsaṃghika texts, however, Ajātaśatru consults his ministers about who he should go to look for counsel. Although his ministers recommend to see several other non-Buddhist teachers, eventually Jīvaka suggests the new king to see the Buddha.\n\nIn Buddhist texts, the Buddha declares Jīvaka foremost among laypeople in being beloved by people, and the Pāli texts name him as example of someone with unwavering faith in Buddhism. Jīvaka is that widely known for his healing skills, that he cannot respond to all the people that want his help. Since Jīvaka gives priority to the Buddhist monastic community, some people needing medical help seek ordination as monks to get it. Jīvaka becomes aware of this and recommends the Buddha to screen people for diseases before ordaining, which the Buddha eventually does for five diseases.\n\nAlthough Jīvaka is depicted as showing great respect for the Buddha and concern and help for the monastic community, there is at least one case in which he fails to show respect. This is the case of Paṇṭhaka, a monk who is considered stupid by many. Jīvaka also shares this opinion, and when he invites the Buddha and the monastic community for a meal, Paṇṭhaka is the only monk he leaves out. The Buddha, arriving for the meal, refuses to start eating, insisting that someone fetches Paṇṭhaka. Jīvaka sends a servant to get Paṇṭhaka, but this servant is surprised to find 1,250 Paṇṭhakas walking around the monastery, as Paṇṭhaka brings about a supernatural accomplishment. Eventually, the real Paṇṭhaka joins the meal, but Jīvaka still does not acknowledge the monk's mental prowess. Jīvaka only changes his mind as Paṇṭhaka shows another supernatural accomplishment and stretches his arm very long to help take the Buddha's alms bowl for him. Jīvaka bows at the monk's feet to request his forgiveness.\n\nMedieval Chinese accounts about Jīvaka tend be hagiographic in nature, and were used more in the proselytising of Buddhism than regarded as medical biography. Since healing knowledge and the proselytising of Buddhism were closely connected, praise for Jīvaka's medical prowess also meant praise and legitimisation of Buddhism. In Chinese texts about medicine from the Six Dynasties period (early medieval), Jīvaka figures most prominently of all physicians, and his stories influenced the stories about other legendary physicians, as well as being influenced by their narratives. In East Asia, Jīvaka was associated with gynaecology, and the name \"Jīvaka\" is related to ancient female pathology and paediatrics. Several medieval medical formulas were named after him, and he is referred to in numerous medical texts from at least the 4th century CE onward. In 6th-century texts of Chinese pharmacology, the adage \"Everything on earth is nothing but medicine\" is attributed to him. In 10th-century Chinese medicine, many treatises were associated with or attributed to Jīvaka. There is also evidence that shows Jīvaka was regarded as an important figure for Indian Āyurvedic medicine: for example, Ḍalhaṇa, an Indian scholar who lived between the 11th and 13th century, wrote in a commentary on the Suśruta Saṃhitā that \"Jīvaka's compendium\" was regarded as an authoritative text on children's diseases, though this text has now been lost. This does not mean that Jīvaka was revered unanimously by all of Asia; several medieval Indian texts such as the Māṭharavṛtti, and the poems of Kṣemedra, depict him, as well as other physicians, as impostors. Among Indian texts, Buddhist texts tend to stand out in that they give much honour to the occupation of the physician, and medical knowledge was highly respected. The former may be related to the doctrine of salvation of Buddhism, in which the Buddha is often described as a doctor that cures the ills of the human race.\n\nJīvaka was and is for many Buddhists and traditional healers and icon and a source of inspiration. The figure of Jīvaka is presented in ancient texts as evidence for the superiority of Buddhism in both the realm of the spiritual as well as the medical. The \"Jīvaka Sūtras\" and the Mūlasarvāstivāda version describe that when Jīvaka meets the Buddha, the latter makes a statement that \"I treat internal diseases; you treat external diseases\", the word \"treat\" () in this context also meaning 'to reign over'. Throughout the medieval period, the accounts about Jīvaka were used to legitimate medical practices. In the early Buddhist texts which were translated in Chinese, Jīvaka was deified and described in similar terminology as used for Buddhas and \"bodhisattvas\". He came to be called the \"Medicine King\", a term used for several legendary Chinese physicians. There is evidence that during the Tang dynasty (7th10th century), Jīvaka was worshipped along the Silk Road as a patron deity of children's health. Today, Jīvaka is seen by Indians as a patriarch of traditional healing, and is regarded by Thai people as the creator of traditional Thai massage and medicine. Thai people still venerate him to ask for assistance in healing ailments, and he plays a central role in nearly all ceremony that is part of traditional Thai medicine. Many stories exist about Jīvaka's purported travels to Thailand.\n\nIn the Sanskrit textual traditions, Jīvaka is the ninth of the Sixteen Arhats, disciples that are entrusted to protect the Buddha's teaching until the arising of the next Buddha. He is therefore believed by Buddhists to still be alive on a mountain peak called Gandhamādana, between India and Sri Lanka. The monastery Jīvaka presented to the Buddhist community came to be known as the Jīvakarāma Vihāra, Jīvakāmravaṇa or Jīvakambavana, and was identified by the Chinese pilgrim Xuan Zang ( 60264) with a monastery in Rajgir. The remains were discovered and excavated in the period from 1803 to 1857. The former monastery is described by archaeologists as \"... one of the earliest monasteries of India dating from the Buddha's time\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1566697", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1566697", "title": "Koliva", "text": "Koliva\n\nKoliva, also spelled kollyva, kollyba or colivă, is a dish based on boiled wheat that is used liturgically in the Eastern Orthodox Church for commemorations of the dead.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, koliva is blessed during funerals, as well as during the memorial service (\"mnemosyno\") that is performed at various intervals after a person's death and on special occasions, such as the Saturday of Souls (ψυχοσάββατο). It may also be used on the first Friday of Great Lent, at Slavas, or at \"mnemosyna\" in the Christmas meal. In some countries, though not in Greece and Romania, it is consumed on nonreligious occasions as well.\n\nA similar food item is widely popular in Lebanon where it is known as \"snuniye\" and, more commonly, as \"berbara\" as it is prepared for Saint Barbara's feast day, December 4, which is celebrated with Halloween-like festivities.\n\n\"Kollyba\", a word which in Greek is the plural form of \"kollybo\" (: n neu; itself rarely used), is derived from the Classical Greek word , \"kollybos\" (n masc), i.e. a small coin or a small gold weight. In the Hellenistic period, the neuter plural form of the latter word, i.e. , \"kollyba\", took the meaning of small pies made of boiled wheat.The sense of the ritual food is of a latter period.\n\nWhile recipes may vary widely, the primary ingredient is wheat kernels which have been boiled until they are soft, they are drained very well and spread on a cloth to be just moist, and then sweetened with honey or sugar. Koliva also contains some or all of the following: wheat, sesame seeds, almonds, ground walnuts, cinnamon, sugar, pomegranate seeds, raisins, anise and parsley. Romanians decorate the koliva with crosses of cocoa, chocolate or candy. In terms of the Greek Pantheon, the wheat symbolized the earth goddess Demeter, while pomegranates stood for her daughter, Persephone, queen of the underworld. Almonds were sacred to Aphrodite and raisins to Dionysus. Sesame seeds were considered to open the doors of consciousness.\n\nThe practice of offering koliva is traditional in Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Russia and Balkan countries, and among Christians in the Middle East. When served, the koliva mixture, which looks like earth, is shaped into a mound to resemble a grave. The whole is then covered with powdered sugar and the initials of the deceased are outlined on the top. A candle, usually placed in the center of the koliva, is lit at the beginning of the memorial service and extinguished at its end. After the liturgy, those attending share in eating the koliva as they speak of the deceased and say, \"May God forgive him/her.\"\n\nSome Orthodox parishes have a designated individual charged with making the koliva. This is in part due to the health risk of fermented wheat if the koliva is not prepared correctly.\n\nSometimes koliva is made with rice or barley instead of wheat. This custom began as a practical response to a famine that occurred in Soviet Russia, when the faithful did not have wheat available for koliva, so they used rice instead. Some communities continue to use rice for their koliva to this day. In the Japanese Orthodox Church where rice is mainly eaten, koliva is commonly made from rice sweetened with sugar and decorated with raisins, without reference to famine.\n\nThe origins of koliva predate Christianity. The word koliva itself stems from the Ancient Greek word (\"kollybos\"), which originally meant \"a small coin\" and later in the neuter plural form \"small pies made of boiled wheat\". In the Ancient Greek \"panspermia\", a mixture of cooked seeds and nuts were offered during the pagan festival of the Anthesteria. For this reason, in Greece koliva is also called \"sperma\", i.e. seed(s).\n\nIn the 5th century CE koliva in the sense of boiled wheat, constituted along with raw vegetables the diet of monks who refused to eat bread.\nThe 12th century canonist Theodore Balsamon maintained that koliva as a ritual food practice was originated by Athanasius of Alexandria during the reign of the Emperor Julian the Apostate.\n\nThe association between death and life, between that which is planted in the ground and that which emerges, is deeply embedded in the making and eating of koliva. The ritual food passed from paganism to early Christianity in Byzantium and later spread to the entire Orthodox world.\n\nOrthodox Christians consider koliva to be the symbolic of death and resurrection, according to the words of the Gospel:\n\"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.\" ()\n\nWheat which is planted in the earth and rises in new life is symbolic of those beloved departed who have died in the hope of resurrection, in accordance with the words of Saint Paul:\n\"So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption. It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body...\"()\n\nThis symbolism has its highest expression in the Saints, whose blessed state in heaven have been manifested to the world. For this reason, koliva is blessed not only at memorials for the departed, but also in commemoration of saints.\n\nKoliva is used on a number of different occasions:\n\nThe tradition of blessing and eating koliva at the end of the first week of Great Lent is connected with an event in the reign of Julian the Apostate. The tradition states that the Emperor knew that the Christians would be hungry after the first week of strict fasting, and would go to the marketplaces of Constantinople on Saturday to buy food. So he ordered that blood from pagan sacrifices be sprinkled over all the food that was sold there. This made the food unsuitable as Lenten fare (since the Christians could not eat meat products during Lent), and in general as food for Christians, who are forbidden to eat food from such sacrifices. However, St. Theodore Tyro appeared in the dream to Archbishop Eudoxius and advised him that the people should not eat food bought at the marketplace that day, but only boiled wheat mixed with honey. As a result, this first Saturday of Great Lent has come to be known as Theodore Saturday.\n\nDuring requiem services (, Slavonic: \"Panikhida\", Romanian: \"parastas\"), the family or friends of the departed will often prepare a koliva which is placed in front of the memorial table before which the service is chanted.\n\nMemorial services are held on the third, ninth, and fortieth days after the repose of an Orthodox Christian, as well as on the one-year anniversary. In addition, there are several Soul Saturdays during the church year (mostly during Great Lent), as well as Radonitsa (on the second Tuesday after Pascha), on each of which general commemorations are made for all the departed.\n\nDuring the Greek, Romanian and Serbian funeral services it is offered to all who attend the funeral.\n\nIt is also customary in the Slavic practice on the feast of the Patron Saint of a church or of a family, or on the feast of saints of special significance to offer koliva. Instead of serving a memorial service, the koliva is set in front of an icon of the saint and a Moleben is served to that saint.\n\n\n"}

With the assisted help of Prime Minister Shang Rong, Mei Bo effectively seized the chance to talk matters with the ignorant king. Mei Bo first barks at the king about the unjust punishment and soon death of Du, who was a loyal astrologer serving under the kingdom for over three generations.

Often applied as an artificial motif, it is common in ancient art. It also found in classical architecture, particularly in the funeral architecture of the ancient Attic Cemeteries as grave reliefs or shrines with statues like the example of Kerameikos in Athens and in the black-figured and red-figured pottery of Ancient Greece at the Loutrophoros and the Lekythos. Although such \"naiskoi\" often draw portraits of men who died, they lack columns and are properly \"grave stelae\" in English-language scholarship. There also exist naiskos-type figurines or other types of temples formed in terracotta; examples abound at the Louvre Museum in Paris. The \"naiskos\" everywhere has a religious background, relating especially to Greek funerary cult. A similar style, called the Aedicula, is observed in Roman art.\n\nThe Funerary Stele of a Woman is in the form of a \"naiskos\". It is a funerary sculpture made from Pentelic marble and dates back to approximately 325 – 320 BCE. Originating from Attica, a region in southern Greece, as many \"naiskoi,\" the artist is unknown. The stele was acquired by the Ernest Brummer Collection and Brummer Gallery in New York in 1923; auctioned to Galerie Koller, an auction house in Switzerland in 1979; and purchased by the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) in Boston in 1979, where the monument currently resides.\n\nIt features a seated young woman on the right of the stele. Next to her is another woman, who is presumed to be a maidservant based on her clothing, standing with a large jewelry box. Both of these women are sculpted in high relief, but between them in a lower relief are remnants of a third standing figure. Only the two female figures has been well preserved. A large portion in the middle is missing.\n\nThe stele functioned as a funerary monument during the Late Classical period of the 4th century. Funerary reliefs were produced in large quantities and typically featured reoccurring images of the maid-and-mistress motif. The Funerary Stele of a Woman is no exception to this tendency, and is comparable to earlier works of the Grave Stele of Hegeso and the Achilles Painter's Attic white-ground oil flask of Mistress and Maid: a seated woman receives a wreath from a standing servant girl.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "248866", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=248866", "title": "Our Lady of Fátima", "text": "Our Lady of Fátima\n\nOur Lady of Fátima (, formally known as Our Lady of the Holy Rosary of Fátima, ), is a Catholic title of the Blessed Virgin Mary based on the famed Marian apparitions reported in 1917 by three shepherd children at the Cova da Iria, in Fátima, Portugal. The three children were Lúcia dos Santos and her cousins Francisco and Jacinta Marto.\n\nBishop José Alves Correia da Silva declared the events \"worthy of belief\" on 13 October 1930. On 13 May 1946, Pope Pius XII granted a canonical coronation to the venerated image enshrined at the Chapel of the Apparitions of Fátima via his apostolic legate, Cardinal Benedetto Aloisi Masella. On 11 November 1954, the same Pontiff raised the Sanctuary of Fátima to the status of Minor Basilica by his Papal brief \"Lucer Superna\".\n\nThe published memoirs of Lúcia dos Santos in the 1930s revealed two secrets that she claimed came from the Virgin while the third secret was to be revealed by the Catholic Church in 1960. The controversial events at Fátima gained fame due partly to elements of the secrets, prophecy and eschatological revelations allegedly related to the Second World War and possibly more global wars in the future, particularly the Virgin's alleged request for the Consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.\n\nIn the spring and summer of 1916, nine-year-old Lúcia dos Santos and her cousins Francisco and Jacinta Marto were herding sheep at the Cova da Iria near their home village of Aljustrel in the parish of Fátima, Portugal. They later said they were visited three times by an apparition of an angel. They said the angel, who identified himself as the \"Angel of Peace\" and \"Guardian Angel of Portugal\", taught them prayers, to make sacrifices, and to spend time in adoration of the Lord.\n\nBeginning in the spring of 1917, the children reported apparitions of an Angel, and starting in May 1917, apparitions of the Virgin Mary, who the children described as \"the Lady more brilliant than the Sun\". The children reported a prophecy that prayer would lead to an end to the Great War, and that on 13 October that year the Lady would reveal her identity and perform a miracle \"so that all may believe.\" Newspapers reported the prophecies, and many pilgrims began visiting the area. The children's accounts were deeply controversial, drawing intense criticism from both local secular and religious authorities. A provincial administrator briefly took the children into custody, believing the prophecies were politically motivated in opposition to the officially secular First Portuguese Republic established in 1910. The events of 13 October became known as the Miracle of the Sun.\nOn 13 May 1917, the children reported seeing a woman \"brighter than the sun, shedding rays of light clearer and stronger than a crystal goblet filled with the most sparkling water and pierced by the burning rays of the sun.\" The woman wore a white mantle edged with gold and held a rosary in her hand. She asked them to devote themselves to the Holy Trinity and to pray \"the Rosary every day, to bring peace to the world and an end to the war\". While the children had never told anyone about seeing the angel, Jacinta told her family about seeing the brightly lit woman. Lúcia had earlier said that the three should keep this experience private. Jacinta's disbelieving mother told neighbors about it as a joke, and within a day the whole village knew of the children's vision.\nThe children said the woman told them to return to the Cova da Iria on 13 June 1917. Lúcia's mother sought counsel from the parish priest, Father Ferreira, who suggested she allow them to go. He asked to have Lúcia brought to him afterward so that he could question her. The second appearance occurred on 13 June, the feast of Saint Anthony, patron of the local parish church. On this occasion the lady revealed that Francisco and Jacinta would be taken to Heaven soon, but Lúcia would live longer in order to spread her message and devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.\n\nDuring the June visit, the children said the lady told them to say the Holy Rosary daily in honor of Our Lady of the Rosary to obtain peace and the end of the Great War. (Three weeks earlier, on 21 April, the first contingent of Portuguese soldiers had embarked for the front lines of the war.) The lady also purportedly revealed to the children a vision of hell, and entrusted a secret to them, described as \"good for some and bad for others\". Fr. Ferreira later stated that Lúcia recounted that the lady told her, \"I want you to come back on the thirteenth and to learn to read in order to understand what I want of you. ...I don't want more.\"\n\nIn the following months, thousands of people flocked to Fátima and nearby Aljustrel, drawn by reports of visions and miracles. On 13 August 1917, the provincial administrator Artur Santos (no relation to Lúcia dos Santos) intervened, as he believed that these events were politically disruptive in the conservative country. He took the children into custody, jailing them before they could reach the Cova da Iria. Santos interrogated and threatened the children to get them to divulge the contents of the secrets. Lúcia's mother hoped the officials could persuade the children to end the affair and admit that they had lied. Lúcia told Santos everything short of the secrets, and offered to ask the woman for permission to tell the official the secrets.\n\nThat month, instead of the usual apparition in the Cova da Iria on 13 August, the children reported that they saw the Virgin Mary on 19 August, a Sunday, at nearby Valinhos. She asked them again to pray the rosary daily, spoke about the miracle coming in October, and asked them \"to pray a lot, a lot for the sinners and sacrifice a lot, as many souls perish in hell because nobody is praying or making sacrifices for them.\"\n\nThe three children claimed to have seen the Blessed Virgin Mary in a total of six apparitions between 13 May and 13 October 1917. 2017 marked the 100th anniversary of the apparitions.\n\nAfter some newspapers reported that the Virgin Mary had promised a miracle for the last of her apparitions on 13 October, a huge crowd, possibly between 30,000 and 100,000, including reporters and photographers, gathered at Cova da Iria. What happened then became known as the \"Miracle of the Sun\".\n\nVarious claims have been made as to what actually happened during the event. The three children who originally claimed to have seen Our Lady of Fátima reported seeing a panorama of visions during the event, including those of Jesus, Our Lady of Sorrows, Our Lady of Mount Carmel, and of Saint Joseph blessing the people. Father John De Marchi, an Italian Catholic priest and researcher wrote several books on the subject, which included descriptions by witnesses who believed they had seen a miracle created by Mary, Mother of God. According to accounts, after a period of rain, the dark clouds broke and the sun appeared as an opaque, spinning disc in the sky. It was said to be significantly duller than normal, and to cast multicolored lights across the landscape, the people, and the surrounding clouds. The sun was then reported to have careened towards the earth before zig-zagging back to its normal position. Witnesses reported that their previously wet clothes became \"suddenly and completely dry, as well as the wet and muddy ground that had been previously soaked because of the rain that had been falling\".\n\nNot all witnesses reported seeing the sun \"dance\". Some people only saw the radiant colors, and others, including some believers, saw nothing at all. The only known picture of the sun taken during the event does not show anything unusual. No unusual phenomenon of the sun was observed by scientists at the time. A number of theologians, scientists, and skeptics have offered alternative explanations that include psychological suggestibility of the witnesses, temporary retinal distortion caused by staring at the intense light of the Sun, and optical effects caused by natural meteorological phenomena.\n\nFrancisco and Jacinta Marto died in the international flu pandemic that began in 1918 and swept the world. Francisco Marto died at home on 4 April 1919, at the age of ten. Jacinta died at the age of nine in hospital on 20 February 1920. They are buried at the Sanctuary of Fátima. They were beatified by Pope John Paul II on 13 May 2000 and canonized by Pope Francis on 13 May 2017. Their mother Olímpia Marto said that her children predicted their deaths many times to her and to curious pilgrims in the brief period of time after the Marian apparitions.\n\nAt the age of fourteen, Lúcia was sent to the school of the Sisters of St. Dorothy (Dorothean) in Vilar, a suburb of Porto, Portugal. In 1928 she became a postulant at the convent of the Sisters of St. Dorothy in Tui, Spain, near the border with Portugal. Lúcia continued to report private visions periodically throughout her life. She reported seeing the Virgin Mary again in 1925 in the convent. This time she said she was asked to convey the message of the First Saturdays Devotion. She said that a subsequent vision of Christ as a child reiterated this request. In 1929, Lúcia reported that Mary returned and repeated her request for the Consecration of Russia to her Immaculate Heart. She also reported an apparition in Rianxo, Galicia, in 1931, in which she said that Jesus visited her, taught her two prayers, and delivered a message to give to the church's hierarchy.\n\nIn 1936 and again in 1941, Sister Lúcia said that the Virgin Mary had predicted the deaths of her two friends during the second apparition on 13 June 1917. According to Lúcia's 1941 account, on 13 June, Lúcia asked the Virgin if the three children would go to heaven when they died. She said that she heard Mary reply, \"Yes, I shall take Francisco and Jacinta soon, but you will remain a little longer, since Jesus wishes you to make me known and loved on Earth. He wishes also for you to establish devotion in the world to my Immaculate Heart.\"\n\nIn 1947, Sister Lúcia left the Dorothean order. She joined the Discalced Carmelite Order in a monastery in Coimbra, Portugal. Lúcia died on 13 February 2005, at the age of 97.\n\nThe widely reported miracle of the sun contributed to Fátima quickly becoming a major centre of pilgrimage. Two million pilgrims visited the site in the decade following the events of 1917. A small chapel – the \"Capelinha\" – was built by local people on the site of the apparitions. The construction was neither encouraged nor hindered by the Catholic Church authorities.\n\nOn 13 May 1920, pilgrims defied government troops to install a statue of the Virgin Mary in the chapel. The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass was first officially celebrated there in January 1924. A hostel for the sick was begun in that year. In 1927 the first rector of the sanctuary was appointed, and a set of Stations of the Cross were erected on the mountain road. The foundation stone for the present basilica was laid the next year.\n\nIn 1930 the Catholic Church officially recognised the apparition events as \"worthy of belief\" and granted a papal indulgence to pilgrims visiting Fátima. In 1935 the bodies of the child visionaries, Francisco and Jacinta, were reinterred in the basilica. Pope Pius XII granted a Canonical Coronation of the statue of Our Lady of Fátima on 13 May 1946. This event drew such large crowds that the entrance to the site had to be barred.\n\nIn the 21st century, pilgrimage to the site takes place year round. Additional chapels, hospitals and other facilities have been constructed at the site. The principal pilgrimage festivals take place on the thirteenth day of each month, from May to October, on the anniversaries of the original apparitions. The largest crowds gather on 13 May and 13 October, when up to a million pilgrims have attended to pray and witness processions of the statue of Our Lady of Fátima, both during the day and by the light of tens of thousands of candles at night.\n\nThe reported visions at Fátima gathered widespread attention, as numerous pilgrims began to visit the site. After a canonical inquiry, the Bishop of Leiria-Fátima officially declared the visions of Fátima as \"worthy of belief\" in October 1930, officially permitting the belief of Our Lady of Fátima.\n\nAt the time of the apparitions, Portugal was undergoing tensions between the secularizing Republican government and more conservative elements in society. The First Republic had begun with the revolution of 1910 overthrowing the constitutional monarch. It was intensely anticlerical and provoked a strong conservative reaction, ultimately leading to the military coup of 1926. Later in Spain during the 1920s and 1930s, as the forces of the Republic gathered strength, armies of the faithful carried the Virgin Mary against groups they said were godless.\n\nDuring the Spanish Second Republic, apparitions of the Virgin Mary were seen on Spanish soil at Ezquioga. Ramona Olazabal said that Mary had marked the palms of her hands with a sword. Seers gained much credence in Integrist and Carlist circles. The visions at Ezquioga were widely covered in the press, as were sixteen other visitations of the Virgin reported in 1931 in Spain. Conservative elements in the Spanish Church actively encouraged the Fátima devotion as a way of countering the perceived threat of atheistic Communism. In Portugal and its former colony of Brazil, conservative groups were sometimes associated with the cult of Fátima. When Germany invaded Russia in 1941, some Catholics interpreted this in terms of the Fátima apparitions, and believed that the Virgin's prophecy was about to be fulfilled.\n\nThe original apparitions took place during the six months preceding the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, and supposedly the Lady talked to the children about the need to pray for Russia. Lucia admitted later that the children initially thought she was requesting prayers for a girl named Russia. In the first edition of Sister Lúcia's memoirs, published after the outbreak of WW II, she focused on the issue of Russia. The warning by the Lady that \"if Russia was not consecrated, it would spread its errors throughout the world\" was often seized upon as an anti-communist rallying cry.\n\nThe Blue Army of Our Lady of Fátima, for instance, has always been strongly anti-Communist and its members often associated the Fátima story in the context of the Cold War. The Blue Army is made up of Catholics who believe that by dedicating themselves to daily prayer (specifically, of the Rosary), they can help to achieve world peace and put an end to the error of communism. Organizations such as the Blue Army have gained the approval of the Catholic Church.\n\nThe Fátima story developed in two parts: that which was reported in 1917, and information later mentioned in Sister Lúcia's memoirs which she wrote years later, after the Church ruled that the events in Fátima were \"worthy of belief.\" Her memoir was not subject to the same scrutiny. The early messages focused on the need to pray the rosary for peace and an end to World War I.\n\nThe supernatural events in Fátima were not widely known outside Portugal and Spain until Lúcia published her memoirs, starting in the late 1930s. Between 1935 and 1993, she wrote six memoirs. The first four, written between 1935 and 1941 during World War II, are now published under the title \"Fatima in Lucia's Own Words\". The fifth and six memoirs, written in 1989 and 1993, are published as \"Fatima in Lucia's Own Words II\".\n\nIn the mid-1930s the Bishop of Leiria encouraged Lúcia (at that time named Sister Maria Lúcia das Dores) to write her memoirs, so that she might reveal further details of the 1917 apparitions. In her first memoir, published in 1935, focused on the holiness of Jacinta Marto. The deceased girl was by then popularly considered a saint. In her second memoir, published in 1937, Lucia wrote more about her own life, the apparition of 13 June 1917, and first reveals the earlier apparitions of the Angel of Peace.\n\nIn her third memoir of 1941, Sister Lúcia described three secrets. She said these had been entrusted to the children during the apparition of 13 July 1917.\n\nThis was a vision of hell, which Lúcia said they experienced on 13 July 1917.\n\nThis was a recommendation for devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary as a way to save souls and bring peace to the world. It predicted an end to the Great War, but predicted a worse one if people did not cease offending God. This second war would be presaged by a night illuminated by an unknown light, as a \"great sign\" that the time of chastisement was near. To avert this, Mary would return to ask for the consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart, and the establishment of the First Saturdays Devotion. If her requests were heeded, Russia would be converted, and there would be peace; if not, Russia would spread her errors throughout the world, causing wars and persecutions of the Church. It ended with a promise that in the end, \"the Immaculate Heart would triumph. The Holy Father would consecrate Russia to Mary, and a period of peace would be granted to the world.\"\n\nOn 25 January 1938 (during solar cycle 17), bright lights, an aurora borealis appeared over the northern hemisphere, including in places as far south as North Africa, Bermuda and California. It was the widest occurrence of the aurora since 1709 and people in Paris and elsewhere believed a great fire was burning and notified fire departments. Sister Lúcia indicated that it was the sign foretold and so apprised her superior and the bishop in letters the following day. Just over a month later, Hitler seized Austria and eight months later invaded Czechoslovakia.\n\nAccording to Sister Lúcia, the Virgin Mary promised that the Consecration of Russia would lead to Russia's conversion and an era of peace. At the time the supposed request for the consecration of Russia was made, however, the Bolsheviks had not yet taken control of Russia.\n\nPope Pius XII, in his Apostolic Letter \"Sacro Vergente\" of 7 July 1952, consecrated Russia to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Pius XII wrote,\n\nIn 1952 the Pope said to the Russian people and the Stalinist regime that the Virgin Mary was always victorious. \"The gates of hell will never prevail, where she offers her protection. She is the good mother, the mother of all, and it has never been heard, that those who seek her protection, will not receive it. With this certainty, the Pope dedicates all people of Russia to the immaculate heart of the Virgin. She will help! Error and atheism will be overcome with her assistance and divine grace.\"\n\nPopes Pius XII and John Paul II both had a special relationship with Our Lady of Fátima. Pope Benedict XV began Pacelli's church career, elevating him to archbishop in the Sistine Chapel on 13 May 1917, the date of the first reported apparition. Pius XII was laid to rest in the crypt of Saint Peter's Basilica on 13 October 1958, the Feast of Our Lady of Fátima.\n\nPope John Paul II again consecrated the entire world to the Virgin Mary in 1984, without explicitly mentioning Russia. Some believe that Sister Lúcia verified that this ceremony fulfilled the requests of the Virgin Mary. However, in the Blue Army's Spanish magazine, \"Sol de Fátima\", in the September 1985 issue, Sister Lúcia said that the ceremony did not fulfill the Virgin Mary's request, as there was no specific mention of Russia and \"many bishops attached no importance to it.\" In 2001, Archbishop Tarcisio Bertone met with Sister Lúcia, who reportedly told him, \"I have already said that the consecration desired by Our Lady was made in 1984, and has been accepted in Heaven.\" Sister Lúcia died on 13 February 2005, without making any public statement of her own to settle the issue.\n\nSome maintain that, according to Lúcia and Fátima advocates such as Abbé Georges de Nantes, Fr. Paul Kramer and Nicholas Gruner, Russia has never been specifically consecrated to the Immaculate Heart of Mary by any Pope simultaneously with all the world's bishops, which is what Lúcia in the 1985 interview had said Mary had asked for.\n\nHowever, by letters of 29 August 1989 and 3 July 1990, she stated that the consecration had been completed; indeed in the 1990 letter in response to a question by the Rev. Father Robert J. Fox, she confirmed:\nI come to answer your question, \"If the consecration made by Pope John Paul II on 25 March 1984 in union with all the bishops of the world, accomplished the conditions for the consecration of Russia according to the request of Our Lady in Tui, Spain on 13 June 1929?\" Yes, it was accomplished, and since then I have said that it was made.\n\nAnd I say that no other person responds for me, it is I who receive and open all letters and respond to them.\nIn the meantime, the conception of Theotokos Derzhavnaya, Orthodox Christian venerated icon, points out that Virgin Mary is considered actual Tsarina of Russia by the religious appeal of Nicholas II; thus \"Consecration of Russia\" may refer to return of Russian monarchy. The icon was brought to Fátima in 2003 and 2014, together with another significant icon, the Theotokos of Port Arthur.\n\nThe third secret, a vision of the death of the Pope and other religious figures, was transcribed by the Bishop of Leiria and reads:\n\nLúcia declared that the Third Secret could be released to the public after 1960. Some sources, including Canon Barthas and Cardinal Ottaviani, said that Lúcia insisted to them it must be released by 1960, saying that, \"by that time, it will be more clearly understood\", and, \"because the Blessed Virgin wishes it so.\" Instead, in 1960 the Vatican published an official press release stating that it was \"most probable the Secret would remain, forever, under absolute seal.\" This announcement triggered widespread speculation. According to the \"New York Times,\" speculation over the content of the secret ranged from \"worldwide nuclear annihilation to deep rifts in the Roman Catholic Church that lead to rival papacies.\"\n\nThe Vatican did not publish the Third Secret, a four-page, handwritten text, until 26 June 2000.\n\nSuch writers as Father Paul Kramer, Christopher Ferrara, Antonio Socci, and Marco Tosatti have suggested that this was not the full text of the secret and stating the Third Secret is not the full text. They alleged that Cardinals Bertone, Ratzinger and Sodano concealed the existence of another one-page document, containing information about the Apocalypse and a great apostasy.\n\nThe Vatican has maintained its position that the full text of the Third Secret was published. According to a December 2001 Vatican press release (published in \"L'Osservatore Romano\"), Lúcia told then-Archbishop Bertone in an interview that the secret had been completely revealed when published.\n\nDuring his apostolic visit to Portugal during 11–14 May 2010 on the 10th anniversary of the beatification of Jacinta and Francisco Marto, Pope Benedict XVI explained to reporters that the interpretation of the third secret did not only refer to the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II in Saint Peter's Square in 1981. He said that the third secret, \"has a permanent and ongoing significance,\" and that, \"its significance could even be extended to include the suffering the Church is going through today as a result of the recent reports of sexual abuse involving the clergy.\"\n\nMany Roman Catholics recite prayers based on Our Lady of Fátima. Lúcia later said that, in 1916, she and her cousins had several visions of an angel calling himself the \"Angel of Portugal\" and the \"Angel of Peace,\" who taught them to bow with their heads to the ground and to say \"My God, I believe, I adore, I hope, and I love you. I ask pardon for those who do not believe, do not adore, do not hope and do not love you.\" Lúcia later set this prayer to music and a recording exists of her singing it. It was also said that sometime later, the angel returned and taught them a eucharistic devotion now known as the Angel Prayer.\n\nLúcia said that the Lady emphasized Acts of Reparation and prayers to console Jesus for the sins of the world. Lúcia said that Mary's words were, \"When you make some sacrifice, say 'O Jesus, it is for your love, for the conversion of sinners, and in reparation for sins committed against the Immaculate Heart of Mary.'\" At the apparition of 13 July 1917, Lucia said Mary told the children that sinners could be saved from damnation by devotion to the Immaculate Heart, but also by making \"sacrifices\". They heard her repeat the idea of sacrifices several times. Her vision of hell prompted them to ever more stringent self-mortifications to save souls. Among many other practices, Lúcia wrote that she and her cousins wore tight cords around their waists, flogged themselves with stinging nettles, gave their lunches to beggars, and abstained from drinking water on hot days. Francisco and Jacinta became extremely devoted to this practice. Lúcia wrote that Mary said God was pleased with their sacrifices and bodily penances.\n\nAt the first apparition, Lúcia wrote, the children were so moved by the radiance that they involuntarily said \"Most Holy Trinity, I adore you! My God, my God, I love you in the Most Blessed Sacrament.\" Lúcia also said that she heard Mary ask for the following words to be added to the Rosary after the Gloria Patri prayer: \"O my Jesus, pardon us, save us from the fires of hell. Lead all souls to heaven, especially those in most need.\"\n\nAccording to Vatican teaching on the tradition of Marian visitations, references to the \"conversion of sinners\" do not necessarily mean religious conversion to the Roman Catholic Church. Pope Leo XIII, in his encyclical on the \"Unity of the Church, Satis Cognitum\", said that would mean the \"conversion of heretics or apostates who are 'outside the church and alien to the Christian Faith.' Rather, \"conversion of sinners\" refers to general repentance and an attempt to amend one's life according to the teachings of Jesus for those true Catholics who are fallen into sins. Lúcia wrote that she and her cousins defined \"sinners\" not as non-Catholics but as those who had fallen away from the church or, more specifically, willfully indulged in sinful activity, particularly \"sins of the flesh\" and \"acts of injustice and a lack of charity towards the poor, widows and orphans, the ignorant and the helpless,\" which she said were even worse than sins of impurity.\n\nThe cultus of the Immaculate Heart is the central message of Fátima. Ecclesiastical approbation does not imply that the Church provides an infallible guarantee on the supernatural nature of the event. But, Karl Rahner and other theologians have said that popes, by authoritatively fostering the Marian veneration in places such as Fátima and Lourdes, motivate the faithful into an acceptance of divine faith.\n\nIn October 1930 Bishop da Silva declared that the apparitions at Fátima were \"worthy of belief,\" and approved public devotion to the Blessed Virgin under the title Our Lady of Fátima. The Vatican granted indulgences and permitted special Liturgies of the Mass to be celebrated in Fátima.\n\nIn 1939, Eugenio Pacelli, who was consecrated as a bishop on 13 May 1917 — the day of the first apparition — was elected to the papacy as Pius XII. He is considered to have become \"the Pope of Fátima.\" In 1940 after World War II had started, Sister Lúcia asked Pope Pius XII to consecrate the world and Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. She repeated this request later that year on 2 December 1940, stating that in the year 1929, the Blessed Lady requested in another apparition that Russia be consecrated to her Immaculate Heart. Mary was said to promise the conversion of Russia from its errors.\n\nOn 13 May 1942, the 25th anniversary of the first apparition and the silver jubilee of the episcopal consecration of Pope Pius XII, the Vatican published the \"Message and Secret of Fátima.\" On 31 October 1942, Pope Pius XII, in a radio address to the people of Portugal, discussed the apparitions of Fátima and consecrated the human race to the Immaculate Heart of the Virgin, with specific mention of Russia. (See below) On 8 December 1942, the Pontiff officially and solemnly declared this consecration in a ceremony in Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome.\n\nOn 13 May 1946, Cardinal Masalla, the personal delegate of Pius XII, crowned in his name Our Lady of Fátima, as the Pope issued a second message about Fátima:\n\nOn 1 May 1948, in \"Auspicia quaedam\", Pope Pius XII requested the consecration to the Immaculate Heart of every Catholic family, parish and diocese.\n\nOn 18 May 1950, the Pope again sent a message to the people of Portugal regarding Fátima: \"May Portugal never forget the heavenly message of Fátima, which, before anybody else she was blessed to hear. To keep Fátima in your heart and to translate Fátima into deeds, is the best guarantee for ever more graces\". In numerous additional messages, and in his encyclicals \"Fulgens corona\" (1953), and \"Ad Caeli Reginam\" (1954), Pius XII encouraged the veneration of the Virgin in Fátima.\n\nAt the end of the Second Vatican Council, Pope Paul VI renewed the consecration of Pius XII to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. In an unusual gesture, he announced his own pilgrimage to the sanctuary on the fiftieth anniversary of the first apparition. On 13 May 1967, he prayed at the shrine together with Sister Lúcia.\n\nIn the final and historic consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, Pope John Paul II on 25 March 1984 consecrated Russia and the world in a public ceremony at St. Peter's in Rome; the consecration was in the form of a 'whole-world consecration' carried out in union with the Catholic bishops throughout the world. Cardinal Bertone said to the press many times that the message of Fátima was finished. Pope John Paul II credited Our Lady of Fátima with saving his life following an assassination attempt on 13 May 1981, the Feast of Our Lady of Fátima. Then on 12 May 1987, he expressed his gratitude to the Virgin Mary for saving his life. The following day, he renewed the consecration of Pius XII to the Immaculate Heart of the Virgin.\n\nOn 12–13 May 2010, Pope Benedict XVI visited the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima and strongly stated his acceptance of the supernatural origin of the Fátima apparitions. On the first day, the Pope arrived at the Chapel of Apparitions to pray; he gave a Golden Rose to Our Lady of Fátima \"as a homage of gratitude from the Pope for the marvels that the Almighty has worked through you in the hearts of so many who come as pilgrims to this your maternal home\". The Pope also recalled the \"invisible hand\" that saved John Paul II. He said in a prayer to the Blessed Virgin Mary that \"it is a profound consolation to know that you are crowned not only with the silver and gold of our joys and hopes, but also with the 'bullet' of our anxieties and sufferings.\"\n\nOn the second day, Pope Benedict spoke to more than 500,000 pilgrims; he referred to the Fátima prophecy about the triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and related it to the final \"glory of the Most Holy Trinity.\"\n\nPius XII, Paul VI, John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Pope Francis all voiced their acceptance of the supernatural origin of the Fátima events.\n\nIn March 2017 the Holy See announced that Pope Francis would canonize two of the visionaries, Francisco and Jacinta Marto, on 13 May at a Mass in Fátima during a two-day visit. The decision followed papal confirmation of a miracle attributed to the intercession of the two visionaries.\n\nThe pope solemnly canonized the children on 13 May 2017 during the centennial of the first apparition.\n\nSeveral statues of Our Lady of Fátima are notable, among which are the following:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "215153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=215153", "title": "Pastor", "text": "Pastor\n\nA pastor is an ordained leader of a Christian congregation. A pastor also gives advice and counsel to people from the community or congregation.\n\nIt is derived from the Latin word \"pastor\", meaning shepherd. When used as an ecclesiastical styling or title, the term may be abbreviated to \"Pr\" or \"Ptr\" (singular) or \"Ps\" (plural).\n\nThe word \"pastor\" derives from the Latin noun which means \"shepherd\" and is derived from the verb – \"to lead to pasture, set to grazing, cause to eat\". The term \"pastor\" also relates to the role of elder within the New Testament, but is not synonymous with the biblical understanding of minister. Many Protestant churches call their ministers \"pastors\".\n\nPresent-day usage of the word is rooted in the Biblical metaphor of shepherding. The Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament) uses the Hebrew word (\"roʿeh\"), which is used as a noun as in \"shepherd,\" and as a verb as in \"to tend a flock.\" It occurs 173 times in 144 Old Testament verses and relates to the literal feeding of sheep, as in Genesis 29:7. In Jeremiah 23:4, both meanings are used (\"ro'im\" is used for \"shepherds\" and \"yir'um\" for \"shall feed them\"), \"And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the LORD.\" (KJV).\nEnglish-language translations of the New Testament usually render the Greek noun (\"poimēn\") as \"shepherd\" and the Greek verb (\"poimainō\") as \"feed\". The two words occur a total of 29 times in the New Testament, most frequently referring to Jesus. For example, Jesus called himself the \"Good Shepherd\" in John 10:11. The same words in the familiar Christmas story (Luke 2) refer to literal shepherds.\n\nIn five New Testament passages though, the words relate to members of the church:\n\nBishops of various denominations often bear a formal crosier in the form of a stylised shepherd's crook as a symbol of their pastoral/shepherding functions.\n\nAround 400 AD, Saint Augustine, a prominent African Catholic bishop, described a pastor's job: Disturbers are to be rebuked, the low-spirited to be encouraged, the infirm to be supported, objectors confuted, the treacherous guarded against, the unskilled taught, the lazy aroused, the contentious restrained, the haughty repressed, litigants pacified, the poor relieved, the oppressed liberated, the good approved, the evil borne with, and all are to be loved.\n\nIn the United States, the term \"pastor\" is used by Catholics for what in other English-speaking countries is called a \"parish priest\". The Latin term used in the Code of Canon Law is \"parochus\".\nIn some Lutheran churches (such as the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland), ordained presbyters are called priests, while in others, such as the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, the term pastor is used more frequently.\n\nOrdained presbyters are called priests in the Church of England, as in all other ecclesiastical provinces of the Anglican Communion.\n\nUnited Methodists ordain to the office of deacon and elder, each of whom can use the title of pastor depending. United Methodists also use the title of pastor for non-ordained clergy who are licensed and appointed to serve a congregation as their pastor or associate pastor, often referred to as licensed local pastors. These pastors may be lay people, seminary students, or seminary graduates in the ordination process, and cannot exercise any functions of clergy outside the charge where they are appointed.\n\nThe use of the term \"pastor\" to refer to the common Protestant title of modern times dates to the days of John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli. Both men, and other Reformers, seem to have revived the term to replace the Roman Catholic priest in the minds of their followers. The pastor was considered to have a role separate from the board of presbyters.\n\nSome groups today view the \"pastor\", \"bishop\", and \"elder\" as synonymous terms or offices; many who do are descended from the Restoration Movement in America during the 19th century, such as the Disciples of Christ and the Churches of Christ.\n\nOther religions have started to use terms such as \"Buddhist pastor\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3727944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3727944", "title": "Piprahwa", "text": "Piprahwa\n\nPiprahwa is a village near Birdpur in Siddharthnagar district of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Kalanamak rice, a scented and spicy variety of rice is grown in this area. It lies in the heart of the historical Buddha's homeland and is 12 miles from the world heritage site of Lumbini that is believed to be the place of Gautama Buddha's birth. \n\nPiprahwa is best known for its archaeological site and excavations that suggest that it may have been the burial place of the portion of the Buddha's ashes that were given to his own Sakya clan. A large stupa and the ruins of several monasteries as well as a museum are located within the site. Ancient residential complexes and shrines were uncovered at the adjacent mound of Ganwaria. It was venerated by the current Dalai Lama when he visited in 1956 and again after his exile in 1959.\n\nA buried stupa was discovered by William Claxton Peppe, a British colonial engineer and landowner of an estate at Piprahwa in January 1898. Following the severe famine that decimated Northern India in 1897, Peppe led a team in excavating a large earthen mound on his land. Having cleared away scrub and jungle, they set to work building a deep trench through the mound. After digging through 18 feet of solid brickwork, they came to a large stone coffer which contained five small vases containing bone fragments, ashes and jewels. On one of the vases was a Brahmi script which was translated by Georg Bühler, a leading European epigraphist of the time, to mean: \n\n\"Sukiti-bhatinaṃ sabhaginikanam sa-puta-dalanam iyaṃ salila-nidhane Budhasa bhagavate sakiyanam\"\n\"This relic-shrine of divine Buddha (is the donation) of the Sakya-Sukiti brothers, associated with their sisters, sons, and wives,\" \n\nThis inscription implies that the bone fragments were part of the remains of Gautama Buddha. In the following decade or so epigraphists debated the precise meaning of the inscription. Vincent Smith, William Hoey, Thomas Rhys Davids and Emile Senart all translated the inscription to confirm that these were relics of the Buddha. In 1905 John Fleet, a former epigraphist of the Government of India, published a translation that agreed with this interpretation.. However, on assuming the role of Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society from Thomas Rhys Davids, he proposed a different reading: \n\"This is a deposit of relics of the brethen of Sukiti, kinsmen of Buddha the Blessed One, with their sisters, their children and wives.\" \n\nThis interpretation was firmly rejected by his contemporaries and Fleet wrote that 'I now abandon my opinion'. Epigraphists of the time subscribed instead to the meaning given by Auguste Barth: \"This receptacle of relics of the blessed Buddha of the Śākyas (is the pious gift) of the brothers of Sukīrti, jointly with their sisters, with their sons and their wives.\"\n\nOver a hundred years later, in the 2013 documentary, \"Bones of the Buddha\", epigraphist Harry Falk of Freie Universität Berlin confirmed the original interpretation that the depositors believed these to be the remains of the Buddha himself. Falk translates the inscription as \"these are the relics of the Buddha, the Lord\" and concludes that the reliquary found at Piprahwa did contain a portion of the ashes of the Buddha and that the inscription is authentic.\n\nIn 1997 epigraphist and archaeologist Ahmad Hasan Dani noted the challenges that isolated finds present to paleographical study and to dating materials. He concluded that \"the inscription may be confidently dated to the earlier half of the second century B.C.\" but noted that \"The Piprahwa vase, found in the Basti District, U.P., has an inscription scratched on the steatite stone in a careless manner. As the inscription refers to the remains of the Buddha, it was originally dated to the pre-Mauryan period, but it has been brought down to the third century B.C. on a comparison with Asokan Brahmi. The style of writing is very poor, and there is nothing in it that speaks of the hand of the Asokan scribes\". Dani's dating of the inscription puts it around 250 years after the generally agreed 480 BCE death of the historical Buddha which suggests that the stupa itself was built after the Buddha's lifetime. The time difference is most likely explained by the Emperor Ashoka’s sudden conversion to Buddhism. After slaughtering tens of thousands to secure his kingdom, Ashoka issued a decree to build stupas and redistribute the Buddha’s remains across his kingdom. \n\nThe main stupa at Piprahwa, one of the earliest so far discovered in India, was built in three phases. In the 6th-5th century BCE around the time of the death of the Buddha, it was raised by piling up natural earth from the surrounding area. This was in accordance with a request of the Buddha who had asked that he be buried under earth ‘heaped up as rice is heaped in an alms bowl’ Phase II occurred during Ashoka’s rule(and was likely completed after his death around 235 BCE) as part of the Emperor’s mission to ‘distribute the relics of the exalted one.’ Ashoka opened up the original stupas containing the relics of the Buddha then restored the stupa and interred a portion of what he had taken. The remaining relics were distributed to other new stupas. At Piprahwa the restoration consisted of filling thick clay over the structure and of building two tiers to reach a height of 4.55m. In phase III, during the Kushan period, the stupa was extensively enlarged and reached a height of 6.35m. The largest structure after the stupa is the Eastern Monastery that measures 45.11m x 41.14m with a courtyard and more than thirty cells around it. There is also the Southern Monastery, the Western Monastery and the smaller Northern Monastery.\n\nPrince Prisdang (aka Jinavaravansa), a former ambassador to Siam and cousin to the King Rama V, had been ordained as a Buddhist monk in Sri Lanka and arrived at Piprahwa shortly after the discovery. He soon learned that W.C. Peppe had ‘generously placed all the objects discovered at the disposal of government’. His eloquent arguments to persuade British government officials to donate the bone relics to the King of Siam to share with Buddhist communities in other countries received some support from lower level British officials and worked their way up to the Viceroy. It was an obvious solution that that might appease Buddhists who were upset that the recently discovered Bodh Gaya, believed to be the place of the Buddha's enlightenment, had remained under Hindu control. It was also a gesture of goodwill to a country that was being courted by the French, Russian and Dutch superpowers of the time. In 1999 a ceremony was held and the bone relics were handed off to an emissary of King Rama V and travelled to Bankok. Prisdang’s request to be involved was not realised. \n\nThe bone relics were immediately distributed across several locations, including:\n\nThe majority of the gold and jewelry relic offerings were donated by the Indian government to the Indian Museum at Kolkata. Today, a replica urn is on display but neither the original nor the relic offerings have been exhibited to a largely Hindu public. Photographs of the items are on display at the Kapilavastu museum at Piprahwa that is visited by Buddhist pilgrims.\n\nW. C. Peppe was allowed to ‘retain a number of duplicates’ which are exhibited in museums today. He also gave some pieces to:\n\nPrince Prisdang who had requested ‘some flowers and buddhist crosses'. These were interred in the Dipaduttamrama Temple which became known as the Jewel stupa.\n\nPrisdang's Buddhist master, Ven. Sri Subuthi who had asked Peppe for a bone relic before realising that they had been put ‘at the disposal of government’. Peppe sent him ’20 relics and a gold roll’ and wrote: 'I hope you will accept them as a present from me. you will see how beautifully they are made.' \n\nA box of 12 flowers most likely given to Thomas Rhys Davids and the Royal Archaeological Society and discovered as part of a clean up at the Buddhist Society headquarters in London in 2004.\n\nFrom 1971-1973, a team of the Archaeological Survey of India led by K.M. Srivastava resumed excavations at the Piprahwa stupa site. The team discovered a casket containing fragments of charred bone, at a location several feet deeper than the coffer that W.C. Peppe had previously excavated. As the relic containers were found in the deposits from the period of Northern Black Polished Ware, Srivastava dated the find to the fifth-fourth centuries BCE, which would be consistent with the period in which the Buddha is believed to have lived. He also discovered 13 sealings which bore the same legend in Kushan script: 'Of the community of the monks of great Kapilavastu'. Today the ancient sites of Piprahwa and Ganwaria host the Kapilavastu Museum, controlled by the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\nThe bone fragments recovered by Srivastava's team are currently located at the National Museum, New Delhi. \nThe relics from the original and the 1970s excavations of the Piprahwa stupa are revered by many Buddhists the world over. In 1978 the Indian government allowed their share of the discovery to be exhibited in Sri Lanka and more than 10 million people paid homage. They were also exhibited in Mongolia in 1993, Singapore in 1994, South Korea in 1995 and Thailand in 1996 and again in Sri Lanka in 2012.\n\nSrivastava's discovery of the terracotta sealings bearing the name Kapilavastu has lead some scholars to believe that modern-day Piprahwa was the site of the ancient city of Kapilavastu, the capital of the Shakya kingdom, where Siddhartha Gautama spent the first 29 years of his life. Others suggest that the original site of Kapilavastu is located to the northwest, at Tilaurakot, in what is currently Kapilvastu District in Nepal. \nThis question is especially important to scholars of Buddhist history, as Kapilavastu was the capital of the Shakya kingdom. King Śuddhodana and Queen Māyādevī lived at Kapilavastu, as did their son Prince Siddhartha Gautama until he left the palace at 29 years of age. . \n\nAlthough there was some initial uncertainty about the translation, there is no record of any challenge to the authenticity of the find at the time. However, in introducing the discovery to the members of the Royal Asiatic Society in April of 1900, its secretary, Thomas Rhys Davids, stressed that 'The hypothesis of forgery in this case is simply unthinkable'. Over a century later some have assumed that such doubts must have therefore existed and the possibility of forgery has been explored in two very different ways. Michael Willis, a former curator of early South Asian and Himalayan collections at the British Museum, has published nothing himself on the subject but chimed in as part of his review of one of epigraphist Harry Falk's books. He references a visit to the Piprahwa excavation six weeks after the discovery by Alois Anton Führer, an archaeologist who was exposed as a forger some months after the discovery, and declares that the Piprahwa inscription is \"in all likelihood a forgery made by A.A. Führer\". \n\nHistorian Charles Allen also believes that Anton Fuhrer's disgrace as a forger tainted public opinion about the find but reaches a different conclusion. In his documentary \"Bones of the Buddha\" and his paper \"What happened at Piprahwa\", he researches the unfolding of events at Piprahwa based on the letters of W.C. Péppe, Vincent Smith and A.A. Führer, and concludes that Führer was unable to interfere with the discovery of the inscription made by W.C. Péppe. Harry Falk (professor of Indology at the Freie Universität in Berlin and said to be the \"world's foremost expert\" in ancient Indian languages and history), stated in the documentary that Führer could not have forged the Piprahwa reliquary inscription. Richard Salomon of the University of Washington notes that 'Forgeries tend to be either blatant imitations of genuine inscriptions, or totally aberrant texts, and if the Piprahwa inscription were a forgery - which I am certain is not the case - it would belong to the latter category.' He goes on 'the Piprahwa inscription rings true in all regards'.\n\n\n\n"}

Commonly called shrooms, magic mushrooms, golden tops, cubes, or gold caps, it belongs to the Hymenogastraceae family of fungi and was previously known as Stropharia cubensis. It is the most well known psilocybin mushroom due to its wide distribution and ease of cultivation.\n\nThe species was first described in 1906 as \"Stropharia cubensis\" by Franklin Sumner Earle in Cuba. In 1907 it was identified as \"Naematoloma caerulescens\" in Tonkin by Narcisse Théophile Patouillard, while in 1941 it was called \"Stropharia cyanescens\" by William Alphonso Murrill in Florida. These synonyms were later assigned to the species \"Psilocybe cubensis\".\n\nThe name \" Psilocybe \" is derived from the Greek roots \"psilos\" (ψιλος) and \"kubê\" (κυβη), and translates as \"thin head\". \"Cubensis\" means \"coming from Cuba\", and refers to the type locality published by Earle.\n\n\n\"Psilocybe cubensis\" is probably the most widely known of the psilocybin-containing mushrooms used for triggering psychedelic experiences after ingestion.\nIts major psychoactive compounds are:\n\n\nThe concentrations of psilocin and psilocybin, determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, were determined to be in the range of 0.14–0.42% and 0.37–1.30% (dry weight) in the whole mushroom, 0.17–0.78% and 0.44–1.35% in the cap and 0.09 and 0.30%/0.05–1.27% in the stem, respectively.\n\nIndividual brain chemistry and psychological predisposition play a significant role in determining appropriate doses. For a modest psychedelic effect, a minimum of one gram of dried \"Psilocybe cubensis\" mushrooms is ingested orally. 0.25–1 gram is usually sufficient to produce a mild effect, 1–2.5 grams usually provides a moderate effect. 2.5 grams and higher usually produces strong effects. For most people, 3.5 dried grams (1/8 oz) would be considered a high dose and may produce an intense experience; this is, however, typically considered a standard dose among recreational users. For many individuals doses above 3 grams may be overwhelming. For a few rare people, doses as small as 0.25 grams can produce full-blown effects normally associated with very high doses. For most people, however, that dose level would result in virtually no effects. Due to factors such as age and storage method, the psilocybin content of a given sample of mushrooms will vary. \nEffects usually start after approximately 20–60 minutes (depending on method of ingestion and stomach contents) and may last from four to ten hours, depending on dosage. Visual distortions often occur, including walls that seem to breathe, a vivid enhancement of colors and the animation of organic shapes.\n\nThe effects of very high doses can be overwhelming depending on the particular phenotype of cubensis, growth method, and the individual. \"Psilocybe cubensis\" mushrooms can come in rather different sizes. It is recommended that one weigh the actual mushrooms, as opposed to simply counting them. People taking MAOIs need to be careful, as psilocybin and psilocin are metabolized by the enzyme monoamine oxidase. A monoamine oxidase inhibitor reduces the body's ability to metabolize psilocin and psilocybin, greatly increasing the intensity of the experience. This can sometimes produce uncomfortable or undesirably intense experiences.\n\nPsilocybin and psilocin are listed as Schedule I drugs under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. However, mushrooms containing psilocybin and psilocin are not illegal in some parts of the world. For example, in Brazil they are legal, but extractions from the mushroom containing psilocybin and psilocin remain illegal. In the United States, \"Psilocybe cubensis\" is illegal.\n\nPersonal-scale cultivation of \"Psilocybe cubensis\" mushrooms ranges from the relatively simple and small-scale PF Tek and other \"cake\" methods, that produce a limited amount of mushrooms, to advanced techniques utilizing methods of professional mushroom cultivators. These advanced methods require a greater investment of time, money, and knowledge, but reward the diligent cultivator with far larger and much more consistent harvests.\n\nTerence McKenna and his brother Dennis made \"Psilocybe cubensis\" particularly famous when they published \"Psilocybin: The Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide\" in the 1970s upon their return from the Amazon rainforest, having deduced new methods (based on pre-existing techniques) for growing psilocybin mushrooms and assuring their audience that \"Psilocybe cubensis\" were amongst the easiest psilocybin-containing mushrooms to cultivate.\n\n\n\n"}

Although females were often selected to continue the line of shaman-ism, not all \"pulingaws\" are female and there were rare instances where males were selected to take up the role. However, the \"pulingaw\"'s gender issue is still an ongoing debate as certain sources insist that only females become \"pulingaws\". The \"pulingaws\" are considered as therapists, who are responsible for mediating and bringing peace to social and biological disorders. They are also responsible for various rituals that range from hunting ceremonies, exorcisms and funerals.\n\nThe \"pulingaws\" are considered to be above other mainstream therapists and they have a significant social status of their own within the Puyuma community. They have been bestowed with the role of averting and curing biological and sociological maladies but at the same time, pleasing their electoral spirits, \"kinitalian\".\n\nThe \"pulingaws\" do not receive former training and they are expected to learn their skills by following and imitating what their fellow senior \"pulingaws\" would be doing. Their job involves visiting their clients’ houses when requested and providing them with spiritual healing processes. \"Pulingaws\" are also expected to participate in an annual ritual, known as \"pualasakan\", which happens during the third day of the third moon. The ritual lasts for eight days an during then, the \"pulingaws\" perform chants, self-purification using water, ridding their sanctuary of miasma, and on the last night of \"pualasakan\", \"punlingaws\" would perform their ‘words of offering’ and be in the \"yaulas\" stage, which is a divine stage that allows the pulingaws to connect with their ancestors’ \"biruas\". \"Pualasakan\" rituals also include another individual that deals with the supernatural, known as the \"benabulu\", who is often a man. \n\nDifferent \"pulingaws\" have somewhat similar practices and languages. They also perform the \"yaulas\" ritual where they perform the yaulas rite and incarnate \"birua\"(s) in order to deal with either biological or sociological events. These dealings may pose neutral, beneficial or even detrimental effects. For example for biological events, if an individual’s \"tinabawan\" (one of the three souls of an individual) is affected by their ancestral \"birua\", who would most likely be offended or annoyed by the individual’s behaviour or actions, the \"pulingaw\" would try to summon the \"birua\" and rectify the situation. During rituals as such, areca nuts and fired clay beads are often used to summon \"birua\" or even for exorcising purposes. The areca nuts are also used as repellents for vengeful spirits, who are either animals or birua who had an unpleasant life prior to their deaths or they carried vengeful intentions during the deaths.\n\nThe main reason behind why most elected individuals refuse to become a \"pulingaw\" is due to the need cope with having a double life. Since most \"pulingaws\" are females, they are required to carry out their expected roles such as cooking, childcare and since they have been bestowed with the fate, she has to attend to patients, whom she cannot refuse unless she is severely ill or injured and that her predicament inhibits her from commuting towards other locations. At times, there would be a need for these \"pulingaws\" to leave their own house to attend to housecalls during the day and don’t even get back home till the wee hours in the morning. \n\nThe \"pulingaws\", however, do expect some form of payment from their patients as their birua have informed them that they do not agree to doing ‘unpaid’ work and if no payment was received, the \"pulingaw\" would be the one suffering the punishment from the \"birua\", as mentioned in the previous paragraph that the \"birua\" is often summoned to deal with an individual’s torment or suffering. These payments used to come in the form of a few coins or areca nuts since fees are paid according to their clients’ discretion. Hence, payment can come in any form, even a gift, and as long as there is a payment, the \"birua\" would remain content.\n\nIt was claimed that there was, initially, only one shaman, known as Samguan, an effiminiate man, and it was him that formalised shaman-ism within the Puyuma. Samguan’s elector \"birua\" loved him so much that he did not suffer what most of the successive shamans suffered prior to his investiture. His investiture process was, in fact, an interesting one. He claimed that while he was ploughing the fields, his \"birua\" dropped a bag (that he proceeded to use as part of his yaulas rituals) from the sky and it landed close to his feet and thus accepted his role as a \"pulingaw\" the moment he picked up the bag. Today, \"pulingaws\" carry an exact replica of this bag (also known as an \"aliut\") everywhere they go.\n\nIt was mentioned that prior to Samguan’s existence, there were only \"miapali\", who were known as people ‘with the evil eye’. These people were often feared and are expected to socially confine and isolate themselves from the rest of the society, to prevent any form of contact (mostly visual). Although people who associate themselves with the supernatural such as the \"miapali\" have existed for a long period of time, it was rather surprising to note that formalised ritualistic practitioners as the \"pulingaw\"s did not exist until the end of the 19th century as Samguan was only 25 when the Japanese arrived in Taiwan in 1895. This claim, at some extent, caused a number of debates amongst the shamans in the past as some pulingaws do believe and claim that another pulingaw known as Udekaw should be considered as the first shaman instead.\n\nThe reason behind Samguan’s well-attained status could most likely be due to his contribution in preventing the Japanese administration in Taiwan from completely annihilating the tribe’s shamans and their practices. His intervention was perhaps not conducted directly against the Japanese administration in the form of a confrontational war, but rather in the form of secret gatherings and classes. It was through these gatherings or classes that Samguan conveyed his knowledge to the next generation of \"pulingaws\". In order to suit their practices to the environmental contexts then, the \"pulingaws\" would have to be constantly aware of their surroundings and avoid getting caught by the Japanese. For example, in order to avoid being caught by the Japanese, rituals such as the \"pualasakan\" would only take place once a year whenever but before that, these rituals took place whenever or wherever there were small issues like illnesses.\n\nElecting ancestors (\"kinitalian\") were said to visit their selected candidates through various ways and eventually have these candidates go through investitures that make them official \"pulingaws\". Electing ancestors would in some instances select individuals based on personal preference but these individuals must be descendants of the electing ancestor. Once selected (prior to their acceptance of the role), these candidates would often succumb to various experiences ranging from extreme physical pain that cannot be cured through modern means of medication. Others have also complained of severe headaches and for female \"pulingaws\", some even complained that their \"kinitalians\" were so relentless that their (\"kinitalian\") fury had caused the women to have miscarriages. These troubles may in some instances, also be afflicted upon the candidates’ families, especially when the \"birua\" is annoyed or furious at the candidates for refusing their fate. Thus, in other words, selected \"pulingaw\" candidates cannot refuse their calling and they must reveal their \"biruas\"’ calls.\n\nOnce these candidates have accepted their fate of becoming a \"pulingaw\", life for most \"pulingaws\" were often said to be better as their \"kinitalian\" no longer disturb them and provide them with blessings. However, there are also exceptions where candidates accepted the role but suffered misfortune events and in some instances led to their deaths. These resulting misfortunes were often associated with the \"pulingaw\"s’ reluctance to fully commit themselves to their \"pulingaw\" calling by either abandoning their faith or more importantly, refuse to partake in the annual \"pualasakan\" ritual. As a result, they were punished by their \"kinitalian\" through a series of calamity.\n\nPrior to the Japanese’s arrival, the Puyuma tribe had a strong hunting culture and men being part of hunting activities was often seen as a masculine role that most males are expected to partake in. However, effeminate males also known as \"a fortiori\", who do not partake in tribal hunting activities would often turn out to be \"pulingaws\". These effeminate male \"pulingaws\" are in a way similar to the Samoan concept of fa’afafine, and some of them do in fact have children. As a matter of fact, the concept of homosexuality never existed within the Puyuma community and male \"pulingaws\" are still seen as men that would fulfil the appropriate gender roles when it comes to having sexual relations with another person, which would be women. \n\nConsidering the fact that the concept of \"pulingaws\" is rather new, previous effeminate men were perhaps classified as \"miapalis\" as they did not fit in well with social expectations. They were also, perhaps, considered as \"mialigu\", who has the power to become or even make things around them become invisible. Hence, both \"miapali\" and \"mialigu\" were believed to be part of the social concepts that traditional Puyumans used to reject individuals that do not seem to meet societal expectations or predisposed Puyuman gender roles. This would, however, require more studies to confirm the existing questions regarding such claims.\n\nThere is also another possibility behind the reason that current \"pulingaw\" practices are female dominated. It should be considered that the Puyumas were previously a shaman-hunting society where men were in charge of shaman rituals and hunting. Eventually, as Puyuman men focused more on agricultural practices (which is considered as a shameful form of practice for men), they left the shamanistic practices to mostly women. This social demographic change eventually became permanent during the Japanese administration when hunting was forbidden.\n"}

He taught at Barnard College and Columbia University for twenty-seven years before moving to Dartmouth College in 2012, where he was named the Mandel Family Professor in the Arts & Sciences. He is also an Episcopal priest. He earned his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1985. He has been a visiting professor at Dartmouth College and at Rutgers, Princeton, Drew University, Emory University, Yale and Northwestern universities and at Union Theological Seminary, where he was also adjunct professor of church history. He has also taught in the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. He was visiting professor at Yale Divinity School from 2004 until 2008.\n\nFollowing his ordination in 2006 and concurrent with his academic responsibilities, Balmer served as part-time rector of two Episcopal parishes in Connecticut: St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington (2008-2009) and Christ Episcopal Church in Middle Haddam (2010-2012). In addition to his academic writing, Balmer has published commentaries in newspapers across the country, including the \"Des Moines Register,\" the \"Philadelphia Inquirer,\" the \"Dallas Morning News,\" the \"Omaha World Herald,\" the \"Los Angeles Times,\" the \"Anchorage Daily News,\" the \"Hartford Courant,\" the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch,\" \"New York Newsday,\" the \"Minneapolis Star Tribune,\" and the \"New York Times,\" among others. His work has also appeared in the \"Nation\", the \"New Republic\", the \"Washington Post Book World\", and the \"New York Times Book Review\".\n\nBalmer was nominated for an Emmy for script-writing and hosting the three-part PBS documentary \"Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory,\" based on his book with the same title. He also wrote and hosted two other PBS documentaries: \"Crusade: The Life of Billy Graham\" and \"In the Beginning: The Creationist Controversy.\"\n\nIn various books and articles, Balmer has criticized the politicization of the American Christian evangelical movement. In an article titled \"Jesus is not a Republican\" in the \"Chronicle of Higher Education\", Balmer writes:\nIndeed, the most effective and vigorous religious movements in American history have identified with the downtrodden and have positioned themselves on the fringes of society rather than at the centers of power. The Methodists of the 19th century come to mind, as do the Mormons. In the 20th century, Pentecostalism, which initially appealed to the lower classes and made room for women and people of color, became perhaps the most significant religious movement of the century.\n\nThe leaders of the religious right have led their sheep astray from the gospel of Jesus Christ to the false gospel of neoconservative ideology and into the maw of the Republican Party. And yet my regard for the flock and my respect for their integrity is undiminished. Ultimately it is they who must reclaim the gospel and rescue us from the distortions of the religious right.\n\nThe Bible I read tells of freedom for captives and deliverance from oppression. It teaches that those who refuse to act with justice or who neglect the plight of those less fortunate have some explaining to do. But the Bible is also about good news. It promises redemption and forgiveness, a chance to start anew and, with divine help, to get it right. My evangelical theology assures me that no one, not even Karl Rove or James Dobson, lies beyond the reach of redemption, and that even a people led astray can find their way home. \nIn 2003, Balmer ran for a seat on his local school board and lost by four votes.\n\nIn 2004, Balmer won the Democratic nomination for a seat representing the 111th District in the Connecticut House of Representatives. Balmer ran in the general election against incumbent Republican John H. Frey, despite the fact that Balmer had lived in the district for less than three years, Frey had never drawn an opponent, and the town of Ridgefield (which the 111th District represents) was \"two-to-one Republican.\" Ultimately, Balmer was defeated in the election. Frey won 8,824 votes, and Balmer won 4,478 votes; Frey won more votes than anyone else in the Connecticut House that year.\n\n\n"}

Many of the prominent texts are associated with Indian religions, i.e., Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, and were composed in ancient India. However, others were composed central, East or Southeast Asia and the canon includes works covering secular sciences and the arts. Early works of Sanskrit literature were transmitted through an oral tradition for centuries before they were written down in manuscript form.\n\nHindu Sanskrit texts are manuscripts and historical literature related to any of the diverse traditions within Hinduism. A few texts are shared resources across these traditions and broadly considered as Hindu scriptures. These include the \"Shruti\", namely the Vedas and the early Upanishads. Many scholars include the Bhagavad Gita and Agamas as Hindu scriptures, while Dominic Goodall includes Bhagavata Purana and Yajnavalkya Smriti to the list of Hindu scriptures.\n\nThe \"Smriti\" Sanskrit texts are a specific body of Hindu texts attributed to an author, as a derivative work they are considered less authoritative than \"Sruti\" in Hinduism. The Smrti literature is a vast corpus of diverse texts, and includes but is not limited to Vedāngas, the Hindu epics, the Sutras and Shastras, the texts of Hindu philosophies, the Puranas, the Kāvya or poetical literature, the \"Bhasyas\", and numerous \"Nibandhas\" (digests) covering politics, ethics, culture, arts and society.\n\nMany ancient and medieval Hindu texts were composed in Sanskrit, many others in regional Indian languages. In modern times, most ancient texts have been translated into other Indian languages and some in Western languages. Prior to the start of the common era, the Hindu texts were composed orally, then memorized and transmitted orally, from one generation to next, for more than a millennia before they were written down into manuscripts. This verbal tradition of preserving and transmitting Hindu texts, from one generation to next, continued into the modern era.\n\nTattvartha Sutra is a Jain text written in the Sanskrit language. It is regarded as one of the earliest, most authoritative books on Jainism, and the only text authoritative in both the \"Digambara\" and \"Śvētāmbara\" sects.\n\nLiterature in Sanskrit continues to be produced. These works, however, have a very small readership. In the introduction to \"Ṣoḍaśī: An Anthology of Contemporary Sanskrit Poets\" (1992), Radhavallabh Tripathi writes:\n\nMost current Sanskrit poets are employed as teachers, either pandits in \"pāṭhaśāla\"s or university professors. However, Tripathi also points out the abundance of contemporary Sanskrit literature:\n\nSimilarly, , in \"Post-Independence Sanskrit Literature: A Critical Survey\", estimates that more than 3000 Sanskrit works were composed in the period after Indian Independence (i.e., since 1947) alone. Further, much of this work is judged as being of high quality, both in comparison to classical Sanskrit literature, and to modern literature in other Indian languages.\n\nSince 1967, the Sahitya Akademi, India's national academy of letters, has had an award for the best creative work written that year in Sanskrit. In 2009, Satyavrat Shastri became the first Sanskrit author to win the Jnanpith Award, India's highest literary award.\nVidyadhar Shastri wrote two epic poems (\"Mahakavya\"), seven shorter poems, three plays and three songs of praise (\"stavana kavya\"), he received the \"Vidyavachaspati\" award in 1962. Some other modern Sanskrit composers include Abhiraj Rajendra Mishra (known as \"Triveṇī Kavi\", composer of short stories and several other genres of Sanskrit literature), Jagadguru Rambhadracharya (known as \"Kavikularatna\", composer of two epics, several minor works and commentaries on \"Prasthānatrayī\").\n\n5. ^ Bhattacharji Sukumari, History of Classical Sanskrit Literature, Sangam Books, London, 1993, , p. 148.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47900835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47900835", "title": "Sita Upanishad", "text": "Sita Upanishad\n\nThe Sita Upanishad () is a medieval era Sanskrit text and a minor Upanishad of Hinduism. It is attached to the Atharva Veda, and is one of the nine Shakta Upanishads. It is categorized as a late Upanishad, in which goddess Sita is extolled as the Ultimate Reality of the Universe (Brahman), the ground of Being (Spirituality), and material cause behind all manifestation. The Upanishad identifies Sita with primordial Prakriti (nature) and her three powers, asserts the text, are manifested in daily life as will (ichha), action (kriyā) and knowledge (jnana).\n\nThis Upanishad is notable for asserting that the cosmos is Atman (soul), it resides in the heart, its awareness and self-realization emerges by Vichara (investigation into the Self) and Samadhi, the ultimate stage of meditation.\n\nThe author and the century in which Sita Upanishad was composed is unknown. The text was likely composed, in the same period as other Shakta Upanishads, between the 12th- and 15th-century CE. Even though this text is of relatively late origin, Sita as goddess is traceable to 1st-millennium BCE Hindu texts and the Epic Ramayana.\n\nManuscripts of this text are also found titled as \"Sitopanishad\". In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at number 45.\n\nThe Upanishad has 37 verses in one chapter and is narrated as a discourse between Prajapati and the gods, the latter eager about \"Who is Sita? What is her nature?\"\n\nPrajapati describes Sita as primal Prakriti, or primordial nature. She is, asserts the text, same as Lakshmi and the Shakti (energy and power) of Vishnu. The text references and uses fragments of hymns in the Vajasaneyi Samhita of Yajurveda, asserting the goddess to manifest all the times as \"will, action and knowledge\" that drives change in the universe, wherein everything, the empirically observed and the transcendental reality, is manifestation of her Being.\n\nSita is all of creation, the good and the bad, all the gods and the demons, the cause and the effect, the material and the spiritual, the virtue and the beauty. Her quality includes the changing reality (Maya, metaphysical illusion), and the unchanging reality without a second (Brahman, metaphysical constant). She is free from change. She has no blemishes. She represents the vocal form of the four Vedas, which the text asserts comes from 21 schools of Rigveda, 109 schools of Yajurveda, 1000 schools of Samaveda, and 40 schools of Atharvaveda. She is ethics, tradition, law, legend, and the five minor Vedas, asserts the text, naming these as architecture, archery, music, medicine and \"Daivika\" (divinity). She is the basis of the whole world, is composed of Brahma Vishnu and Shiva, and she is the soul (inner self, Atman) that resides in all livings.\nHer name Sita, signifies Pranava or “Aum”, and she is the first cause of the universe. The text then offers a folk etymology for her name, asserting that each letter of her name has specific meaning. The “S” indicates Satya or eternal truth, the “i” signifies Maya or illusion in an unchanging form, and “ta” denoting the goddess of speech conjoined with Brahman.\n\nThe text weaves in mythical elements of her origins. She, asserts the text, emerged at the tip of the plough symbolizing her link to Prakriti or nature that feeds and nourishes all life. She is all pervading. She, asserts the text, lights up everything in all worlds. \"The wheel of time and the wheel of the Universe\" are her personifications. Evolution and preservation are her gifts, she is the tree of plenty.\n\nShe is Lakshmi, seated as a Yogini on her lion throne. The universe is full of the beautiful, states the Upanishad, and all that beauty is she, she alone.\n\nThe Vedas are her, states Sita Upanishad, and she personifies the three goddesses: Shri (goddess of prosperity, Lakshmi), Bhumi (mother earth), and Nila (goddess of destruction). These manifestations of her, correspond to Samkhya theory of Guṇa, as Sattva, Rajas and Tamas respectively, and are traced in Vaishnavism tradition respectively to the Sri-Sukta, Bhu-Sukta, and Nila-Sukta hymns in the Vedas.\n\nSita, states the text, is the supreme goddess, non-dual Brahman (Ultimate Reality), the Being (Spirituality), and material cause of empirical reality.\n\nDavid Scott states that the description of Sita in this Upanishad mirrors the description of goddesses in Greek literature and other civilizations. Sita is described in verse 10 of this text, states Scott, as the one with different forms yet same in essence, \"she is all\" embodied with various attributes and activities, she is who manifests as gods, sages and men. Similarly, adds Scott, Apuleius in section 11.5 of \"Metamorphoses\" describes its goddess as, \"Though I am worshipped in many aspects, known by countless names and propitiated by all manners of different rites, yet the whole earth venerates me\".\n\n\n"}

Xiuhcoatl is a Classical Nahuatl word that literally translates as \"turquoise serpent\"; it also carries the symbolic and descriptive meaning, \"fire serpent\".\n\nXiuhcoatl was a common subject of Aztec art, including illustrations in Aztec codices and its use as a back ornament on representations of both Xiuhtecuhtli and Huitzilopochtli. Xiuhcoatl is interpreted as the embodiment of the dry season and was the weapon of the sun. The royal diadem (or \"xiuhuitzolli\", \"pointed turquoise thing\") of the Aztec emperors apparently represented the tail of the Xiuhcoatl, the fire serpent.\n\nXiuhcoatl was typically depicted with a sharply back-turned snout and a segmented body. Its tail resembled the trapeze-and-ray year sign, and probably does represent that symbol. In Nahuatl, the word \"xihuitl\" means \"year\", \"turquoise\" and \"grass\". The tail of Xiuhcoatl is often marked with the Aztec symbol for \"grass\". The body of the Xiuhcoatl was wrapped with knotted strips of paper, linking the serpent to bloodletting and sacrifice.\n\nIn the Postclassic period, the Xiuhcoatl fire serpent was associated with the three concepts associated with its tail-sign; turquoise, grass and the solar year. All three of these concepts were associated with fire in central Mexico during the Postclassic, with dry grass and the solar year being closely identified with fire and solar heat. Page 46 of the pre-Columbian Codex Borgia depicts four smoking Xiuhcoatl serpents arranged around a burning turquoise mirror. A turquoise-rimmed mirror has been found at the Maya city of Chichen Itza, with four fire serpents circling the rim. The archaeological site of Tula has warrior columns on Mound B that bear mirrors on their backs, also surrounded by four Xiuhcoatl fire serpents.\n\nAlthough the Fire Serpent can be easily traced back to the Early Postclassic period in Tula, its ultimate origins are unclear. During the Classic Period, the War Serpent of Teotihuacan was probably a forerunner of Xiuhcoatl, it was also depicted with the grass symbol, flames and the trapeze-and-ray year symbol.\n\nXiuhcoatl was considered to be the nahual, or spirit form, of the Aztec fire god Xiuhtecuhtli. It was a lightning-like weapon borne by Huitzilopochtli. With it, soon after his birth he pierced his sister Coyolxauhqui, destroying her, and also defeated the Centzon Huitznahua. This incident is illustrated on a fragment of broken sculpture excavated from the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan. The fragment was originally a part of a large stone disk that depicted the fallen Coyolxauhqui with the Xiuhcoatl fire serpent penetrating her chest. This Xiuhcoatl wielded by Huitzilopochtli symbolises the forces of darkness being driven out by the fiery rays of the sun.\n\nTonatiuh, the Sun god, was guided across the sky by Xiuhcoatl, and was used by him as a weapon against his underworld enemies, the stars and the moon.\n\nDuring the Panquetzaliztli ceremony, Xiuhcoatl was represented by a paper serpent with red feathers emerging from its open maw to represent flames. During the ceremony, burning torches also symbolised Xiuhcoatl and a serpent dance was performed.\n"}
