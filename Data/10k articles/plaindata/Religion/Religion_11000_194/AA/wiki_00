It was formerly known as Tjikini Mosque (Indonesian: 'Masjid Tjikini').\n\nThe mosque stands on what was the estate of Raden Saleh, the famous late nineteenth-century Romantic painter. Oral tradition has it that Raden Saleh himself allowed local Muslims to build a prayer house on his estate, sometime in 1850. In 1897, the late artist's wife sold the estate to the Alatas family, a prominent Peranakan Arab clan of colonial landlords and officials.\n\nSome thirty years later, Sayyid Ismail bin Sayyid Abdoellah bin Alwi Alatas sold part of the estate to Koningin Emma Stichting, a foundation that would later build and manage Cikini Hospital (Indonesian: 'Rumah Sakit Cikini'). The old mosque was excluded from the transaction due to an ongoing ownership dispute between the Sayyid and the mosque. Around this time, the simple old structure was moved to the banks of the Ciliwung to enable worshippers to undertake wudu in the river.\n\nAfter Sayyid Ismail's victory in the courts, the land on which the mosque stood was sold to Koningin Emma Stichting in 1923. A year later, the hospital board officially requested the mosque board to move the house of worship further away from its present site.\n\nThe mosque authorities, however, refused since they consider the land a legacy, or waqf, left to the community by Raden Saleh.\n\nTo ensure the mosque's survival \"in situ\", a committee was formed to transform the old simple prayer house into a permanent, concrete structure. Among the committee members were Agus Salim, Mas Mansur and Cokroaminoto. Between 1932 and 1934, the mosque underwent further renovation and expansion work, financed by Sarekat Islam. These efforts helped stave off efforts to have the mosque moved away, though the building remained in a legal limbo for many decades to come. It was only in 1991 that Cikini Hospital bequeathed - for good - to the mosque the land which it has occupied since 1850.\n\n"}

The early history of the religion in Iran covers the lives of these individuals, their families and their earliest prominent followers: the Letters of the Living, the Apostles of Bahá'u'lláh and later some of the Disciples of `Abdu'l-Bahá and Hands of the Cause. In the 19th century conversions from Judaism and Zoroastrianism are well documented - indeed such a change of status removing legal and social protections.\n\nSince its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. Prior to 1911 a private school for girls existed in Tehran which was opened by Iranian Bahá'í women. During the Persian Constitutional Revolution situations required the close of the school.\n\nAlthough ‘Abdu'l-Bahá had instructed the Bahá'ís in Iran not to take part in open defiance of the government (and they did not participate in the street demonstrations and the taking of sanctuary in the British Legation in Tehran in the summer of 1906) during the period of the Persian Constitutional Revolution they did broadly support the Constitutionalist cause.\nTarbiyat-i Banat (Girls’ Education), established in 1911 in Tehran, was the most respected Baha’i girls’ school. Founded on the efforts of private school for girls by Bahá'ís, it was re-opened under the direction of an Iranian Bahá'í boys’ school committee and several American Bahá'í women pioneers who moved in order to support the goals of the religion. Even though it catered to the Iranian Bahá'í community, Tarbiyat attracted children from non-Bahá'í families, as the curriculum was largely secular.\n\nThe situation of the Bahá'ís improved under the Pahlavi dynasty when the government actively sought to secularize public life however there were still organizations actively persecuting the Bahá'ís in addition to there being curses children would learn decrying the Báb, a central figure of the religion, and Bahá'ís. See Hojjatieh. The founder of SAVAK, Teymur Bakhtiar, took a pick-ax to a Bahá'í building himself at the time. See Persecution during the early 20th century and during the Pahlavi Dynasty.\n\nThe religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. However the modern history of persecution of Bahá'ís in Iran is extensive and prevented these kinds of developments in Iran:\n\nDespite the persecution, one of many Bahá'í schools in the world, the Bahá'í Institute for Higher Education, \"an elaborate act of communal self-preservation\", was set up, though it has been systematically raided. Between 1987 and 2005 the Iranian authorities closed down the university several times as part of the pattern of suppressing the Bahá'í community. Between September 30 and October 3, 1998, and most recently again on 22 May 2011, officials from the Ministry of Intelligence entered the homes of academic staff of the Bahá'í Institute for Higher Education, a university in Iran designed and managed by the Bahá'í community for Iranian Bahá'ís as a Bahá'í school for those who are excluded from access to higher education in their country, seizing books, computers and personal effects and shutting down buildings used for the school.\n\nAfter a wave of arrests, Shirin Ebadi volunteered to be the lawyer for the arrested Bahá'í leadership of Iran in June 2008. By December 29 the Islamic authorities closed Ebadi's Center for Defenders of Human Rights, raiding her private office and seizing her computers and files.\n\nIndeed, several agencies and experts and journals have published concerns about viewing the developments as a case of genocide: Roméo Dallaire, Genocide Watch, Sentinel Project for Genocide Prevention, and the journals \"War Crimes, Genocide, & Crimes against Humanity\" and \"Journal of Genocide Research\".\n\nA summary of 2013 incidents of prison sentences, fines and punishments showed that these were more than twice as likely to apply to Bahá'ís as any other religious minority in Iran and that the total rate of such cases had gone up by 36% over 2012.\n\nThe first known survey of the religion comes from an unpublished work in 1919–1920 gathered by John Esslemont and had been intended to be part of his well-known Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era. In it, consulting various individuals, he summarizes the religion's presence in Egypt, Germany, India, Iran, Iraq, Turkestan, and the United States. It did not arrive at a total but did have some regional statistics based on some individual reports. In Iran \"The Cause has not only spread in important centres, but even in remote villages and corners…. In Teheran alone there are probably 10,000 Bahais.… [The] population of Teheran [is] 750,000.… Khorassan: villages where the whole population is Bahai. Esphahan, places where 2/3 of the people are Bahais. In Azerbayjan, villages where 1/2 are Bahais.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

Bahá'í sources usually estimate the worldwide Bahá'í population to be above 5 million. Most encyclopedias and similar sources estimate between 5 and 6 million Bahá'ís in the world in the early 21st century. The religion is almost entirely contained in a single, organized, hierarchical community, but the Bahá'í population is spread out into almost every country and ethnicity in the world, being recognized as the second-most geographically widespread religion after Christianity. See Bahá'í statistics.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith in Australia has a long history beginning with a mention by `Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, in 1916 following which United Kingdom/American emigrants John and Clara Dunn came to Australia in 1920. They found people willing to convert to the Bahá'í Faith in several cities while further immigrant Bahá'ís also arrived. The first Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in Melbourne followed by the first election of the National Spiritual Assembly in 1934.\n\nWhen persecution of Bahá'ís intensified in Iran in 1955, Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, suspended plans for a Bahá'í House of Worship in Tehran, and in its place commissioned the Kampala Bahá'í House of Worship and the Sydney Bahá'í House of Worship. According to Jennifer Taylor, a historian at Sydney University, the latter was among Sydney's four most significant religious buildings constructed in the twentieth century. It was the world's fourth Bahá'í House of Worship to be completed, dedicated in 1961. Shoghi Effendi, head of the Bahá'í Faith when the House of Worship was designed, called it the \"Mother Temple of the whole Pacific area\" and the \"Mother Temple of the Antipodes.\"\n\nThough they had been denied entry in 1948, Iranian Bahá'ís began to be admitted in 1973 where persecution again rose. Since the 1980s the Bahá'ís of Australia have become involved and spoken out on a number of civic issues – from interfaith initiative such as \"Soul Food\" to conferences on indigenous issues and national policies of equal rights and pay for work. The community was counted by census in 2001 to be about 11,000 individuals and includes some well-known people (see Bahá'í Faith in Australia – National exposure.)\n\nIn 2000, Paul Sjoquist of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the Hawaiian Islands estimated that there were as many as 1,000 followers in Hawaii.\n\nThe only substantial non-Christian population is of the Bahá'í Faith. The Bahá'í Faith in Kiribati begins after 1916 with a mention by `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, that Bahá'ís should take the religion to the Gilbert Islands which form part of modern Kiribati. The first Bahá'ís pioneered to the island of Abaiang(aka Charlotte Island, of the Gilbert Islands), on 4 March 1954. They encountered serious opposition from some Catholics on the islands and were eventually deported and the first convert banished to his home island. However, in one year there was a community of more than 200 Bahá'ís and a Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly. Three years later the island where the first convert was sent to was found to now have 10 Bahá'ís. By 1963 there were 14 assemblies. As the Ellice Islands gained independence as Tuvalu and the Gilbert Islands and others formed Kiribati, the communities of Bahá'ís also reformed into separate institutions of National Spiritual Assemblies in 1981. The Bahá'ís had established a number schools by 1963 and there are still such today – indeed the Ootan Marawa Bahá'í Vocational Institute being the only teacher training institution for pre-school teachers in Kiribati. The census figures are consistently between 2 and 3% for the Bahá'ís while the Bahá'ís claim numbers above 17%. All together the Bahá'ís now claim more than 10,000 local people have joined the religion over the last 50 years and there are 38 local spiritual assemblies.\n\nBahá'í Faith is practised by 3% of the population of Tuvala. It forms majority in the Nanumea Island of Tuvalu. Nanumea island is the only region in Oceania where Bahai's forms majority.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith in the Marshall Islands begins after 1916 with a mention by `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, that Bahá'ís should take the religion there. The first Bahá'í to pioneer there arrived in August 1954 however she could only stay until March 1955. Nevertheless, with successive pioneers and converts the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly in 1967 in Majuro. The community continued to grow and in 1977 elected its first National Spiritual Assembly. Before 1992 the Bahá'ís began to operate state schools under contract with the government. Middle estimates of the Bahá'í population are just over 1,000, or 1.50% in 2000.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith in New Caledonia was first mentioned by `Abdu'l-Bahá in 1916, though the first Bahá'í arrived in 1952 during a temporary visit because of restrictive policies on English-speaking visitors. In 1961 Jeannette Outhey was the first New Caledonian to join the religion and with other converts and pioneers elected the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly of Nouméa. The Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly of New Caledonia was elected in 1977. Multiplying its involvements through to today, the 2001 population was reported at 1,070 and growing.\n\nWhile the first mention of events related to the history of the Bahá'í Faith in New Zealand was in 1846 continuous contact began around 1904 when one individual after another came in contact with Bahá'ís and some of them published articles in print media in New Zealand as early as 1908. The first Bahá'í in the Antipodes was Dorothea Spinney who had just arrived from New York in Auckland in 1912. Shortly thereafter there were two converts about 1913 – Robert Felkin who had met `Abdu'l-Bahá in London in 1911 and moved to New Zealand in 1912 and is considered a Bahá'í by 1914 and Margaret Stevenson who first heard of the religion in 1911 and by her own testimony was a Bahá'í in 1913. After `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote the Tablets of the Divine Plan which mentions New Zealand the community grew quickly so that the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly of the country was attempted in 1923 or 1924 and then succeeded in 1926. The Bahá'ís of New Zealand elected their first independent National Spiritual Assembly in 1957. By 1963 there were four Assemblies, and 18 localities with smaller groups of Bahá'ís. The 2006 census reports about 2800 Bahá'ís in some 45 local assemblies and about 20 smaller groups of Bahá'ís though the Association of Religion Data Archives estimated there were some 7,000 Bahá'ís in 2005.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith in Papua New Guinea begins after 1916 with a mention by `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, that Bahá'ís should take the religion there. The first Bahá'ís move there (what Bahá'ís mean by \"pioneering\",) in Papua New Guinea arrived there in 1954. With local converts the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1958. The first National Spiritual Assembly was then elected in 1969. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on\"World Christian Encyclopedia\") estimated some 60000 or 0.9% of the nation were Bahá'ís in 2005 though the 2012 CIA Factbook estimated 1/3rd of that citing national census figures from 2000. Either way it is the largest minority religion in Papua New Guinea, if a small one.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith in Tonga started after being set as a goal to introduce the religion in 1953, and Bahá'ís arrived in 1954. With conversions and pioneers the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1958. From 1959 the Bahá'ís of Tonga and their local institutions were members of a Regional Spiritual Assembly of the South Pacific. By 1963 there were five local assemblies. Less than forty years later, in 1996, the Bahá'ís of Tonga established their paramount Bahá'í school in the form of the Ocean of Light International School. Around 2004 there were 29 local spiritual assemblies and about 5% of the national population were members of the Bahá'í Faith though the Tonga Broadcasting Commission maintained a policy that does not allow discussions by members of the Baha'i Faith of its founder, Bahá'u'lláh on its radio broadcasts.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith in Samoa and American Samoa begins with the then head of the religion, `Abdu'l-Bahá, mentioning the islands in 1916, inspiring Bahá'ís on their way to Australia to stop in Samoa in 1920. Thirty four years later another Bahá'í from Australia pioneered to Samoa in 1954. With the first converts the first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly was elected in 1961, and the Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly was first elected in 1970. Following the conversion of the then Head of State of Samoa, King Malietoa Tanumafili II, the first Bahá'í House of Worship of the Pacific Islands was finished in 1984 and the Bahá'í community reached a population of over 3,000 in about the year 2000.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8931878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8931878", "title": "Criticism of Conservative Judaism", "text": "Criticism of Conservative Judaism\n\nCriticism of Conservative Judaism is widespread in the Orthodox Jewish community, although the movement also has its critics in Reform Judaism and in other streams of Judaism. While the Conservative movement professes fidelity to Jewish tradition, it considers \"Halakha\" (Jewish religious law) to be a dynamic process that needs reinterpreting in modern times. The criticism by Orthodox Jews and traditionalists within the movement itself revolves around the following: \n\n\nCritics also claim that the legal analysis of the Conservative movement tends to be ideologically-driven, resulting in intended outcomes to such an extent that it is outside the bounds of traditional halakhic analysis.\n\nFrom Haredi Judaism perspective, criticism is exemplified by Rabbi Avi Shafran of Agudath Israel of America. Shafran wrote in 2001 that the Conservative movement's leaders \"trample\" halakha while proclaiming fealty to it. He argued that the movement was a failure because nearly three-quarters of Conservative Jews said that they consider a Jew to be anyone raised Jewish, even if his or her mother was a gentile—the official Reform position, rejected by Conservative leaders as nonhalachic. Shafran further argued that Conservative Judaism \"movement is not honest\" because, though stating its commitment to halakhah (Jewish law), it approved the ordination of women based on a commission containing mostly laypeople and only one Talmud scholar. Shafran stated that the movement should have relied on the Talmud faculty of JTS. Similarly, in 2006, Rabbi Shafran criticized the decision by the Conservative movement's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards to adopt a responsum liberalizing its position on homosexual conduct. Shafran repeated his assertion that the Conservative movement, despite its \"claim of halachic integrity\", did not follow the \"true halachic process\".\n\nMoreover, Rabbi Avi Weiss, an Open Orthodox rabbi on the left wing of Orthodox Judaism, also characterized the differences between Orthodox and Conservative Judaism in a manner critical of the Conservative approach:\n\nAt the 2006 convention of the Rabbinical Assembly, the Conservative movement's official rabbinical organization, Rabbi Ismar Schorsch said that the Conservative movement had \"lost faith in itself\" and \"become Reform.\"\n\nIn an interview, Rabbi Schorsch, who was about to retire as Chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary, criticized rabbis and activists who were lobbying to change the Conservative movement's opposition to same-sex unions and the ordination of gay clergy. He described their methods as using scholarship to overturn halakha rather than to foster appreciation of it.\n\nRabbi Schorsch made similar criticism two months later in his final commencement address at Jewish Theological Seminary, in which he spoke of the \"malaise of Conservative Judaism\", its \"impoverishment\", and its \"grievous failure of nerve\". He also criticized the Seminary, one of the chief academic and intellectual institutions of Conservative Judaism:\n\nRabbi David Golinkin, the chair of the Masorti movement's \"Va'ad Halakha\" (Israel's counterpart to the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards), criticized the Conservative movement's proposal to liberalize its position on homosexual conduct. He wrote that such a change would \"split the Conservative movement in two ... drive away the most halakhically observant laypeople in our synagogues, and ... have a devastating effect on the Conservative movement throughout the world.” According to Rabbi Golinkin, if the Conservative movement adopted such a change, most Israelis would see little difference between the Masorti movement (Israeli Conservative Judaism in Israel) and Reform Judaism.\n\nRabbi Joseph Prousser, a member of the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, also lobbied against the proposal, arguing that its adoption would result in \"a fractured Conservative movement\" that is \"rendered less viable\". He wrote that adopting such a change would represent a \"failure of moral and religious leadership\" and that such a significant change would diminish the Conservative rabbinate's ability to provide meaningful religious guidance to its congregants:\n\nAfter the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards adopted the responsum liberalizing its position on homosexual conduct, Rabbi Prouser and three other members of the Committee—Rabbis Joel Roth, Mayer Rabinowitz, and Leonard Levy—resigned in protest.\n\nRabbi Paul Menitoff, Executive Vice President of the Reform movement’s Central Conference of American Rabbis, wrote in a 2004 essay that Conservative Judaism would either merge with Reform Judaism or \"disappear\". Rabbi Menitoff said that the Conservative movement's policies were at odds with the principles of its young adult members on issues such as intermarriage, patrilineal descent, and the ordination of lesbians and gay men—all issues that Conservative Judaism then-opposed yet Reform Judaism supported. (The Conservative movement has since liberalized its policy concerning the ordination of gay clergy.) To support his prediction, Rabbi Menitoff described Conservative Judaism's dilemma:\n\nRabbi Menitoff's essay drew criticism from Conservative rabbis, two of whom described his prediction as \"off base\" and \"wishful thinking.\" Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, then Chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary, pointed out that “at the beginning of the 20th century, all the Jewish pundits predicted the demise of Orthodoxy, and they all proved dead wrong. So Rabbi Menitoff has good company in bad predictions.”\n\nSome third-wave feminists have criticized Conservative Judaism's efforts at integrating women as half-hearted attempts at egalitarianism. Instead of maintaining a traditional approach to worship and treating women as if they were men, what Dr. Rachel Adler calls \"honorary men\", some have suggested that the Conservative movement cannot become truly egalitarian until it reinterprets Judaism to reflect the perspectives and experiences of women.\n\nIn her 1998 book \"Engendering Judaism: An Inclusive Theology and Ethics\", Dr. Adler wrote:\n"}

The Confucian \"Classic of Filial Piety\", thought to be written around the Qin-Han period, has historically been the authoritative source on the Confucian tenet of filial piety. The book, a purported dialogue between Confucius and his student Zengzi, is about how to set up a good society using the principle of filial piety. The term can also be applied to general obedience. Filial piety is central to Confucian role ethics.\n\nIn more general terms, filial piety means to be good to one's parents; to take care of one's parents; to engage in good conduct not just towards parents but also outside the home so as to bring a good name to one's parents and ancestors; to perform the duties of one's job well so as to obtain the material means to support parents as well as carry out sacrifices to the ancestors; not be rebellious; show love, respect and support; display courtesy; ensure male heirs, uphold fraternity among brothers; wisely advise one's parents, including dissuading them from moral unrighteousness; display sorrow for their sickness and death; and carry out sacrifices after their death.\n\nFilial piety is considered a key virtue in Chinese culture, and it is the main concern of a large number of stories. One of the most famous collections of such stories is \"The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars\" (\"Ershi-si xiao\" ). These stories depict how children exercised their filial piety in the past. While China has always had a diversity of religious beliefs, filial piety has been common to almost all of them; historian Hugh D.R. Baker calls respect for the family the only element common to almost all Chinese people.\n\nFilial piety is illustrated by the Chinese character \"xiao\" (孝). The character is a combination of the character \"lao\" (old) above the character \"zi\" (son), that is, an elder being carried by a son. In Korean Confucianism, the character is pronounced \"hyo\" (효). In Vietnamese, the character is written in Quoc Ngu as \"hiếu\". In Japanese, the term is generally used in spoken and written language as 親孝行, \"\"oyakōkō\",\" adding characters for \"parent\" and \"conduct\" to make the word more specific.\n\nAccording to the \"Classic of Filial Piety\", Confucius once said: \"In serving his parents, a filial son reveres them in daily life; he makes them happy while he nourishes them; he takes anxious care of them in sickness; he shows great sorrow over their death that was for him; and he sacrifices to them with solemnity.\" For Confucius, filial piety was not merely blind loyalty to one's parents. More important than the norms of \"xiào\" were the norms of \"rén\" (仁; benevolence) and \"yì\" (義; righteousness). For Confucius and Mencius, \"xiào\" was a display of \"rén\" which was ideally applied in one's dealings with all elders, thus making it a general norm of intergenerational relations. However, in practice, \"xiào\" was usually reserved for one's own parents and grandparents, and from time to time, was elevated above the notions of \"rén\" and \"yì\".\n\nFilial piety was emphasized in Confucianism because devotion to one's parents was often associated with one's devotion to the state.\n\nBuddhism stressed \"individual\" salvation, and had little room for the interdependent society that Confucianism had created in China, which stressed the good of the \"community\" more than the good of the \"individual\". In India, Buddhism also advocated celibacy among its monks which was unacceptable in the Confucian world view, given that it was viewed as the child's duty to continue the parental line.\n\nWhen Buddhism was introduced to China, it was redefined to support filial piety. The \"Mouzi Lihuolun\" (牟子理惑論), a work defending Buddhism to the Chinese, presented arguments for Buddhist monks' seemingly poor treatment of their parents, by closely reading the works of Confucius himself. The \"Guiyangtu\" (跪羊图) and Vimalakirti Nirdesa Sutra are also Buddhist works portraying lay householder duties and obligations in contrast with pure monastic renunciation.\n\nThe \"Mouzi Lihuolun\" compares the Buddhist monk to a filial son who saves his father from drowning.\nA long time ago, the Ch'i people crossed a large river in a boat and it happened that their father fell into the water. His sons rolled up their sleeves, seized his head, and turned him upside down, forcing the water out of his mouth, thus bringing their father back to life. Now, to seize one's father's head and turn him upside down is certainly not very filial. Yet they could have done nothing better to save their father's life. If they had folded their hands and practiced the norm of filial sons, their father's life would have been lost in the waters.\nThe behavior of a Buddhist monk is similar. While on the surface the Buddhist seems to reject and abandon his parents, the pious Buddhist is actually aiding his parents as well as himself on their path towards salvation. The \"Mouzi Lihuolun\" also attempted to counter charges that not having children was a violation of good ethics. It was pointed out that Confucius himself had praised a number of ascetic sages who had not had children or family, but because of their wisdom and sacrifice were still perceived as ethical by Confucius. The argument that Buddhist filial piety concerns itself with the parent’s soul is the most important one. The same essential argument was made later by Sun Chuo, who argued that Buddhists monks (far from working solely for their own benefit) were working to ensure the salvation of all people and aiding their family by doing so. Huiyuan continued in this reasoning, arguing that if one member leaves the household to be a monk, then all other members of the family would benefit from good fortune and lead superior lives.\n\nThese philosophical arguments were not entirely successful in convincing the filial Chinese that the behavior advocated by Buddhism was correct, and so less subtle methods were employed. To more directly give Buddhism filial nature, passages and parables that were of minor importance in Indian and Central Asian Buddhism became very prominent in Chinese Buddhism. \"The story of Shanzi\" 睒子 (\"Syama\" in Sanskrit, Sama in Pāli, from the \"Sama Jātaka\"), is an example of this.\n\nShanzi spent his entire life aiding his blind parents, until he was accidentally killed. But, because of his life of filial devotion, he was miraculously revived. This story was often mentioned in the Chinese canon of Buddhist texts, and was included in a number of different anthologies (such as the \"Liudu Jijing\" and referred to by other Chinese Buddhist writers. While it is clearly of Indian origin based on the story of Shravan, this tale was virtually indistinguishable from similar Chinese tales. While the tale was transmitted along with Buddhist writings, philosophically it had very little to do with traditional Buddhism.\n\nAnother story advocating filial piety is that of Moggallāna, a Buddhist monk who goes to great lengths to rescue his mother from condemnation for her unjust life. This story appeared in the \"Ullambana Sūtra\" and it is far more relevant to Buddhism than the tale of Shan-tzǔ, though it was still not a particularly important tale in Indian Buddhism. In China, however, these stories became not just elements of Buddhist scripture, but also popular tales which were even told among non-Buddhists. While these tales were a part of the Buddhist tradition, East Asian Buddhism raised them from a peripheral role to a central one.\n\nAnother tale that achieved great renown in China was that of the Buddha rising to heaven for three months after his enlightenment to preach and teach his mother his new philosophy. This tale was used to indicate that the Buddha did indeed show proper concern and respect for his parents, in that he cared for their immortal souls.\n\nA number of apocryphal texts were also written that spoke of the Buddha's respect for his parents, and the parent-child relationship. The most important of these, the \"Sutra of Filial Piety\", was written early in the Tang dynasty. This text (\"sūtra\") has the Buddha making the very Confucian argument that parents made great sacrifices, and put great efforts into ensuring the well-being of their child. In return each child must repay this kindness with loyalty and respect. Despite being a forgery, the \"sūtra\" was accepted as accurate by generations of scholars and commoners, and it played an important role in the development of a fully Chinese variation of Buddhism. Other documents discussing the Buddha’s views on the parent child-relationship were also probably forgeries. The \"Sutra on a Filial Son\", for instance, also sounds far more Chinese than Indian, and shows Confucian influence.\n\nLu Xun in his collection \"Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk\" (朝花夕拾) criticized the stories \"He Buried His Son for His Mother\" and \"Wang Xiang: He Lay on Ice in Search of Carp\". The latter story is about Wang Xiang, a very young boy, who laid on an iced lake in order to get a fish for his sick mother.\n\n\n\n"}

He was introduced by John Hagee as \"The Apostle of Joy\" on TBN, a phrase that became his professional PR slogan. He has been a full-time evangelistic minister since 1978, using his music and comic talent in his work. In the book \"Close Encounters of the God Kind\", Duplantis writes about his daily relationship with God, the reality of eternity, perspectives on Heaven and his belief in the depth of the compassion, forgiveness and love God has for humankind.\n\nHe is the founder of Jesse Duplantis Ministries (JDM), which maintains an international headquarters in America and branches in the United Kingdom and Australia. In 1997, he and his wife, Cathy Duplantis, founded Covenant Church, a local outreach of JDM on the International Headquarters property in Destrehan, Louisiana. The JDM official website states: \"Jesse Duplantis Ministries is an evangelistic ministry dedicated to reaching people and changing lives with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Our vision is world evangelism and our desire is to see God bless everyone in every way.\" Duplantis' books have been translated into thirteen languages, including Braille, and are distributed worldwide. Duplantis appears on the internet via webcasts, a variety of Christian television stations such as the Trinity Broadcasting Network, Daystar, and LeSEA, in addition to secular networks inclusive of the ABC, NBC and CBS.\n\nIn early 2006, Duplantis was invited to become the first Louisiana Director of Christians United For Israel. He states, \"CUFI has asked me to be the Louisiana Director, and it's an offer I've accepted. I believe that Christians like us should stand for Israel and the Jewish people.\" A diverse group of Christian leaders met in San Antonio February 7–8, 2006 to form the organization, which is chaired by John Hagee.\n\nDuplantis was on the Board of Regents of Oral Roberts University, which awarded him an honorary doctorate, until late 2007, when he, fellow regent Creflo Dollar, and the President of the University Richard Roberts all resigned. Duplantis said in a prepared statement released by the school, \"the demands of ministry have made it increasingly difficult to continue to effectively serve.\" The rest of the Board which included Kenneth Copeland and Benny Hinn was swept away over the next few weeks after the University accepted a $70 million donation on the condition it inaugurate \"a new era of transparent governance and accountability.\"\n\nIn May 2018, Duplantis asked his followers to donate money to him so that he could buy a new $54 million private jet, the Dassault Falcon 7X. Duplantis said that his organization, Jesse Duplantis Ministries, had already paid for three private jets by 2006, and that he had been using them by \"just burning them up for the Lord Jesus Christ.\" Duplantis defended his choice by saying: \"I really believe that if Jesus was physically on the earth today he wouldn't be riding a donkey. Think about that for a minute. He'd be in an airplane preaching the gospel all over the world.\" In response to a wave of criticism, Duplantis stated on his ministry website, \"I'm not asking you to pay for my plane.\"\n\nPreviously in 2016, Duplantis and fellow televangelist Kenneth Copeland defended their use of private jets as firstly, commercial planes were full of \"demons\" which would bog down their schedules with requests for prayers; and secondly, on a commercial airplane, Duplantis would not be able to unbuckle his seat belt to speak to God standing up.\n\nIn recognition of his \"many years of effectively sharing God's message of salvation through Jesus Christ to the world,\" Jesse Duplantis was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Divinity degree from Oral Roberts University in 1999.\n\nDuplantis's estimated $40 million net worth and lavish lifestyle come under harsh criticism from those outside the \"prosperity gospel\" fold. \n\nThe Trinity Foundation (Dallas), a religious watchdog organization, has kept an eye on Duplantis for more than 10 years. The organization's president Ole Anthony said that because DuPlantis' tax exemption, technically, every person in St. Charles Parish was “helping to pay for Duplantis' extravagant lifestyle”.\n\nThe ownership of Duplantis' $3 million house, which also serves as the church rectory, was also the subject of investigation, as it had been paid for through non-taxable donations, and Duplantis avoided paying up to $33,000 a year in taxes for what a house of that value would be taxed. Retired Tax Assessor Clyde Gisclair of that parish said that whereas most homeowners qualify for a tax exemption, Duplantis has placed the house in the ministry's name, though it is for his own use, and will not be paying taxes at all. Therefore taxpayers will be footing the bill. \"When somebody's exempt, somebody has to pay the bill,\" Gisclair said. He said that instances like this can cause the area's millage, or property tax, to go up.\n\nAccording to Anthony, \"If the IRS finds that he in fact is abusing the tax code with regard to those two issues (conversion and inurement), then they could conceivably revoke his ability to give tax receipts for donations - he could lose his tax exempt status.\" Besides the house, Jesse Duplantis Ministries also owns a huge private jet, with which Duplantis had used to take thousands of trips, including to Hawaii and Las Vegas.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16429", "title": "Jewish views on marriage", "text": "Jewish views on marriage\n\nIn traditional Judaism, marriage is viewed as a contractual bond commanded by God in which a man and a woman come together to create a relationship in which God is directly involved. () Though procreation is not the sole purpose, a Jewish marriage is traditionally expected to fulfil the commandment to have children. () In this view, marriage is understood to mean that the husband and wife are merging into a single soul, which is why a man is considered \"incomplete\" if he is not married, as his soul is only one part of a larger whole that remains to be unified.\n\nSome Jewish denominations such as Reconstructionist, Reform, and Conservative Judaism recognize same-sex marriage, and de-emphasize procreation, focusing on marriage as a bond between a couple. This view is considered as a diversion from the Jewish Law by the Orthodox denominations, rather than as a legitimate, alternative interpretation.\n\nIn Jewish law, an engagement (\" kiddushin\") is a contract between a man and a woman where they mutually promise to marry each other at some future time and the terms on which it shall take place. The promise may be made by the intending parties or by their respective parents or other relatives on their behalf. The promise is formalized in a document known as the , the \"Document of Conditions\", which is read prior to the . After this reading, the mothers of the future bride and groom break a plate. Today, some sign the contract on the day of the wedding, some do it as an earlier ceremony, and some do not do it at all.\n\nIn Haredi communities, marriages may be arranged by the parents of the prospective bride and groom, who may arrange a shidduch by engaging a professional match-maker (\"shadchan\") who finds and introduces the prospective bride and groom and receives a \"brokerage-fee\" for his or her services. The young couple is not forced to marry if either does not accept the other.\n\nIn Jewish law, marriage consists of two separate acts, called \"erusin\" (or \"kiddushin\", meaning \"sanctification\"), which is the betrothal ceremony, and \"nissu'in\" or \"chupah\", the actual Jewish wedding ceremony. \"Erusin\" changes the couple's interpersonal status, while \"nissu'in\" brings about the legal consequences of the change of status. In Talmudic times, these two ceremonies usually took place up to a year apart; the bride lived with her parents until the actual marriage ceremony (\"nissuin\"), which would take place in a room or tent that the groom had set up for her. Since the Middle Ages the two ceremonies have taken place as a combined ceremony performed in public.\n\nAccording to the Talmud, \"erusin\" involves the groom handing an object to the bride - either an object of value such as a ring, or a document stating that she is being betrothed to him. In order to be valid, this must be done in the presence of two unrelated male witnesses. After erusin, the laws of adultery apply, and the marriage cannot be dissolved without a religious divorce. After \"nisuin\", the couple may live together.\n\nMarital harmony, known as \"\"shlom bayit\",\" is valued in Jewish tradition. The Talmud states that a man should love his wife as much as he loves himself, and honour her \"more\" than he honours himself; indeed, one who honours his wife was said, by the classical rabbis, to be rewarded with wealth. Similarly, a husband was expected to discuss with his wife any worldly matters that might arise in his life. The Talmud forbids a husband from being overbearing to his household, and domestic abuse by him was also condemned. It was said of a wife that \"God counts her tears\".\n\nAs for the wife, the greatest praise the Talmudic rabbis offered to any woman was that given to a wife who fulfils the wishes of her husband; to this end, an early midrash states that a wife should not leave the home \"too frequently\". A wife, also, was expected to be modest, even if the only other person present with her was her husband. God's presence dwells in a pure and loving home.\n\nMarriage obligations and rights in Judaism are ultimately based on those apparent in the Bible, which have been clarified, defined, and expanded on by many prominent rabbinic authorities throughout history.\n\nTraditionally, the obligations of the husband include providing for his wife. He is obligated to provide for her sustenance for her benefit; in exchange, he is also entitled to her income. However, this is a right to the wife, and she can release her husband of the obligation of sustaining her, and she can then keep her income exclusively for herself. The document that provides for this is the ketuba.\n\nThe Bible itself gives the wife protections, as per Exodus 21:10, although the rabbis may have added others later. The rights of the husband and wife are described in tractate Ketubot in the Talmud, which explains how the rabbis balanced the two sets of rights of the wife and the husband.\n\nAccording to the non-traditional view, in the Bible the wife is treated as a possession owned by her husband, but later Judaism imposed several obligations on the husband, effectively giving the wife several rights and freedoms; indeed, being a Jewish wife was often a more favourable situation than being a wife in many other cultures. For example, the Talmud establishes the principle that a wife is entitled, but not compelled, to the same dignity and social standing as her husband, and is entitled to keep any additional advantages she had as a result of her social status before her marriage.\n\nBiblical Hebrew has two words for \"husband\": \"ba'al\" (also meaning \"master\"), and \"ish\" (also meaning \"man\", parallel to \"isha\" meaning \"woman\" or \"wife\"). The words are contrasted in Hosea 2:18 (2:16 in Christian Bibles), where God speaks to Israel as though it is his wife: \"On that day, says the Lord, you will call [me] 'my husband' (\"ish\"), and will no longer call me 'my master' (\"ba'al\").\"\n\nA wife was also seen as being of high value, and was therefore, usually, carefully looked after. Early nomadic communities practised a form of marriage known as \"beena\", in which a wife would own a tent of her own, within which she retains complete independence from her husband; this principle appears to survive in parts of early Israelite society, as some early passages of the Bible appear to portray certain wives as each owning a tent as a personal possession (specifically, Jael, Sarah, and Jacob's wives). In later times, the Bible describes wives as being given the innermost room(s) of the husband's house, as her own private area to which men were not permitted; in the case of wealthy husbands, the Bible describes their wives as having each been given an entire house for this purpose.\n\nIt was not, however, a life of complete freedom. The descriptions of the Bible suggest that a wife was expected to perform certain household tasks: spinning, sewing, weaving, manufacture of clothing, fetching of water, baking of bread, and animal husbandry. The Book of Proverbs contains an entire acrostic about the duties which would be performed by a \"virtuous\" wife.\n\nThe husband, too, is indirectly implied to have responsibilities to his wife. The Torah obligates a man to not deprive his wife of food, clothing, or of sexual activity; if the husband does not provide the first wife with these things, she is to be divorced, without cost to her. The Talmud interprets this as a requirement for a man to provide food and clothing to, and have sex with, each of his wives, even if he only has one.\n\nAs a polygynous society, the Israelites did not have any laws which imposed monogamy on men. Adulterous married women and adulterous betrothed women, and their male accomplices however, were subject to the death penalty by the biblical laws against adultery, According to the Priestly Code of the Book of Numbers, if a woman was suspected of adultery, she was to be subjected to the Ordeal of Bitter Water, a form of trial by ordeal, but one that took a miracle to convict. The literary prophets indicate that adultery was a frequent occurrence, despite their strong protests against it, and these legal strictnesses.\n\nThe Talmud sets a minimum provision which a husband must provide to his wife:\n\nRabbinic courts could compel the husband to make this provision, if he fails to do so voluntarily. Moses Schreiber, a prominent 19th century halachic decisor, argued that if a man could not provide his wife with this minimum, he should be compelled to divorce her; other Jewish rabbis argued that a man should be compelled to hire himself out, as a day-labourer, if he cannot otherwise make this provision to his wife.\n\nAccording to prominent Jewish writers of the Middle Ages, if a man is absent from his wife for a long period, the wife should be allowed to sell her husband's property, if necessary to sustain herself. Similarly, they argued that if a wife had to take out a loan to pay for her sustenance during such absence, her husband had to pay the debt on his return.\n\nIn order to offset the husband's duty to support his wife, she was required by the Talmud to surrender all her earnings to her husband, together with any profit she makes by accident, and the right of usufruct on her property; the wife was not required to do this if she wished to support herself. Although the wife always retained ownership of her property itself, if she died while still married to her husband, he was to be her heir, according to the opinion of the Talmud; this principle, though, was modified, in various ways, by the rabbis of the Middle Ages.\n\nIn Jewish tradition, the husband was expected to provide a home for his wife, furnished in accordance to local custom and appropriate to his status; the marital couple were expected to live together in this home, although if the husband's choice of work made it difficult to do so, the Talmud excuses him from the obligation. Traditionally, if the husband changed his usual abode, the wife was considered to have a duty to move with him. In the Middle Ages, it was argued that if a person continued to refuse to live with their spouse, the spouse in question had sufficient grounds for divorce.\n\nMost Jewish religious authorities held that a husband must allow his wife to eat at the same table as him, even if he gave his wife enough money to provide for herself. By contrast, if a husband mistreated his wife, or lived in a disreputable neighbourhood, the Jewish religious authorities would permit the wife to move to another home elsewhere, and would compel the husband to finance her life there.\n\nExpanding on the household tasks which the Bible implies a wife should undertake, rabbinic literature requires her to perform all the housework (such as baking, cooking, washing, caring for her children, etc.), unless her marriage had given the husband a large dowry; in the latter situation, the wife was expected only to tend to supposedly \"affectionate\" tasks, such as making his bed and serving him his food. Jewish tradition expected the husband to provide the bed linen and kitchen utensils. If the wife had young twin children, the Talmud made her husband responsible for caring for one of them.\n\nThe Talmud elaborates on the biblical requirement of the husband to provide his wife with clothing, by insisting that each year he must provide each wife with 50 zuzim's-worth of clothing, including garments appropriate to each season of the year. The Talmudic rabbis insist that this annual clothing gift should include one hat, one belt, and three pairs of shoes (one pair for each of the three main annual festivals: Passover, Shabu'ot, and Sukkoth). The husband was also expected by the classical rabbis to provide his wife with jewellery and perfumes if he lived in an area where this was customary.\n\nThe Talmud argues that a husband is responsible for the protection of his wife's body. If his wife became ill, then he would be compelled, by the Talmud, to defray any medical expense which might be incurred in relation to this; the Talmud requires him to ensure that the wife receives care. Although he technically had the right to divorce his wife, enabling him to avoid paying for her medical costs, several prominent rabbis throughout history condemned such a course of action as \"inhuman\" behaviour, even if the wife was suffering from a prolonged illness.\n\nIf the wife dies, even if not due to illness, the Talmud's stipulations require the husband to arrange, and pay for, her burial; the burial must, in the opinion of the Talmud, be one conducted in a manner befitting the husband's social status, and in accordance with the local custom. Prominent rabbis of the Middle Ages clarified this, stating that the husband must make any provisions required by local burial customs, potentially including the hiring of mourners and the erection of a tombstone. According to the Talmud, and later rabbinic writers, if the husband was absent, or refused to do these things, a rabbinical court should arrange the wife's funeral, selling some of the husband's property in order to defray the costs.\n\nIf the wife was captured, the husband was required by the Talmud and later writers to pay the ransom demanded for her release; there is some debate whether the husband was required only to pay up to the wife's market value as a slave, or whether he must pay any ransom, even to the point of having to sell his possessions to raise the funds. If the husband and wife were both taken captive, the historic Jewish view was that the rabbinic courts should first pay the ransom for the wife, selling some of the husband's property in order to raise the funds.\n\nIn the classical era of the rabbinic scholars, the death penalty for adultery was rarely applied. It forbids conviction if:\n\nThese rules made it practically impossible to convict any woman of adultery; in nearly every case, women were acquitted. However, due to the belief that a priest should be untainted, a Kohen was compelled to divorce his wife if she had been raped.\n\nEven when a woman was convicted, the punishment was comparatively mild; the death penalty (for all crimes) was abolished in 40 AD, and adulteresses were flogged instead. Nevertheless, the husbands of convicted adulteresses were not permitted by the Talmud to forgive their guilty wives, instead being compelled to divorce them; according to Maimonides, a conviction for adultery nullified any right that the wife's \"marriage contract\" (Hebrew: \"ketubah\") gave her to a compensation payment for being divorced. Once divorced, an adulteress was not permitted, according to the Talmudic writers, to marry her paramour.\n\nAs for men who committed adultery (with another man's wife), Abba ben Joseph and Abba Arika are both quoted in the Talmud as expressing abhorrence, and arguing that such men would be condemned to Gehenna.\n\nThe laws of \"family purity\" (\"tehorat hamishpacha\") are considered an important part of an Orthodox Jewish marriage, and adherence to them is (in Orthodox Judaism) regarded as a prerequisite of marriage. This involves observance of the various details of the menstrual niddah laws. Orthodox brides and grooms attend classes on this subject prior to the wedding. The niddah laws are regarded as an intrinsic part of marital life (rather than just associated with women). Together with a few other rules, including those about the ejaculation of semen, these are collectively termed \"family purity\".\n\nIn marriage, conjugal relations are guaranteed as a fundamental right for a woman, along with food and clothing. This obligation is known as \"onah.\" Sex within marriage is the woman's right, and the man's duty. If either partner refuses to participate, that person is considered rebellious, and the other spouse can sue for divorce.\n\nEarly-teen marriage was possible in Judaism. Babylonian rabbis encouraged early marriage as a means of legally channeling the male libido. According to the Talmud, a father is commanded not to marry his daughter to anyone until she grows up and says, \"I want this one\". A marriage that takes place without the consent of the girl is not an effective legal marriage.\n\nDespite the young threshold for marriage, a large age gap between the spouses was opposed, and, in particular, marrying one's young daughter to an old man was declared as reprehensible as forcing her into prostitution.\n\nA \"ketannah\" (literally meaning \"little [one]\") was any girl between the age of 3 years and that of 12 years plus one day; she was subject to her father's authority, and he could arrange a marriage for her without her agreement. However, after reaching the age of maturity, she would have to agree to the marriage to be considered as married. If the father was dead or missing, the brothers of the \"ketannah\", collectively, had the right to arrange a marriage for her, as had her mother. In these situations, a \"ketannah\" would always have the right to annul her marriage, even if it was the first.\n\nIf the marriage did end (due to divorce or the husband's death), any further marriages were optional; the \"ketannah\" retained her right to annul them. The choice of a \"ketannah\" to annul a marriage, known in Hebrew as \"mi'un\" (literally meaning \"refusal\", \"denial\", \"protest\"), led to a true annulment, not a divorce; a divorce document (\"get\") was not necessary, and a \"ketannah\" who did this was not regarded by legal regulations as a divorcee, in relation to the marriage. Unlike divorce, \"mi'un\" was regarded with distaste by many rabbinic writers, even in the Talmud; in earlier classical Judaism, one major faction - the House of Shammai - argued that such annulment rights only existed during the betrothal period (\"erusin\") and not once the actual marriage (\"nissu'in\") had begun.\n\nEvidence from Rabbinic material indicates that Jewish males normally married at the age of thirty, to adolescent women. In medieval Jewish Ashkenazi communities, girls were often married at very young ages. Since the Enlightenment, child marriage is extremely rare in the Jewish community.\n\nRates of marriage between Jews and non-Jews have increased in countries other than Israel (the Jewish diaspora). According to the National Jewish Population Survey 2000-01, 47% of marriages involving Jews in the United States between 1996 and 2001 were with non-Jewish partners. Jewish leaders in different branches generally agree that possible assimilation is a crisis, but they differ on the proper response to intermarriage.\n\n\nThere are also differences between streams on what constitutes an intermarriage, arising from their differing criteria for being Jewish in the first place. Orthodox Jews do not accept as Jewish a person whose mother is not Jewish, nor a convert whose conversion was conducted under the authority of a more liberal stream.\n\nIn Israel, the only institutionalized form of Jewish marriage is the religious one, i. e., a marriage conducted under the auspices of the rabbinate. Specifically, marriage of Israeli Jews must be conducted according to Jewish Law (halakha), as viewed by Orthodox Judaism. One consequence is that Jews in Israel who cannot marry according to Jewish law (e. g., a kohen and a divorcée, or a Jew and one who is not halachically Jewish), cannot marry each other. This has led for calls, mostly from the secular segment of the Israeli public, for the institution of civil marriage.\n\nSome secular-Jewish Israelis travel abroad to have civil marriages, either because they do not wish an Orthodox wedding or because their union cannot be sanctioned by \"halakha\". These marriages are legally recognized by the State, but are not recognized by the State Rabbinate.\n\nMarriages performed in Israel must be carried out by religious authorities of an official religion (Judaism, Islam, Christianity, or Druse), unless both parties are \"without religion\".\n\nHalakha (Jewish law) allows for divorce. The document of divorce is termed a \"get\". The final divorce ceremony involves the husband giving the \"get\" document into the hand of the wife or her agent, but the wife may sue in rabbinical court to initiate the divorce. In such a case, a husband may be compelled to give the \"get\", if he has violated any of his numerous obligations; this was traditionally accomplished by beating and or monetary coercion. The rationale was that since he was required to divorce his wife due to his (or her) violations of the contract, his good inclination desires to divorce her, and the community helps him to do what he wants to do anyway. In this case, the wife may or may not be entitled to a payment.\n\nSince around the 12th century, Judaism recognized the right of a wife abused physically or psychologically to a divorce.\n\nConservative Judaism follows halacha, though differently than Orthodox Judaism. Reform Jews usually use an egalitarian form of the Ketubah at their weddings. They generally do not issue Jewish divorces, seeing a civil divorce as both necessary and sufficient; however, some Reform rabbis encourage the couple to go through a Jewish divorce procedure. Orthodox Judaism does not recognize civil law as overriding religious law, and thus does not view a civil divorce as sufficient. Therefore, a man or woman may be considered divorced by the Reform Jewish community, but still married by the Conservative community. Orthodox Judaism usually does not recognize Reform weddings because according to Talmudic law, the witnesses to the marriage must be Jews who observe halacha, which is seldom the case in reform weddings.\n\nTraditionally, when a husband fled, or his whereabouts were unknown for any reason, the woman was considered an \"agunah\" (literally \"an anchored woman\"), and was not allowed to remarry; in traditional Judaism, divorce can only be initiated by the husband. Prior to modern communication, the death of the husband while in a distant land was a common cause of this situation. In modern times, when a husband refuses to issue a \"get\" due to money, property, or custody battles, the woman who cannot remarry is considered a Michuseres Get, not an agunah. A man in this situation would not be termed a \"Misarev Get\" (literally, \"a refuser of a divorce document\"), unless a legitimate Beis Din had required him to issue a Get. The term \"agunah\" is often used in such circumstances, but it is not technically accurate.\n\nWithin both the Conservative and Orthodox communities, there are efforts to avoid situations where a woman is not able to obtain a Jewish divorce from her husband. After the fact, various Jewish and secular legal methods are used to deal with such problems. None of the legal solutions addresses the agunah problem in the case of a missing husband.\n\nThe Midrash is one of the few ancient religious texts that makes reference to same-sex marriage. The following teaching can be found twice in the Midrash:\n\n\"Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Joseph, 'The generation of the Flood was not wiped out until they wrote גמומסיות (either sexual hymns or marriage documents) for the union of a man to a male or to an animal.'\"\nAnother important reference is found in the Babylonian Talmud:\n\"'Ula said: Non-Jews [litt. Bnei Noach, the progeny of Noah] accepted upon themselves thirty mitzvot [divinely ordered laws], but they only abide by three of them: The first one is that they do not write marriage documents for male couples, the second one is that they do not sell dead [human] meat by the pound in stores, and the third one is that they respect the Torah.'\" \n\nOrthodox Judaism does not have a Jewish legal construct of same-gender marriage. While any two Jewish adults may be joined by a Jewish legal contract, the rites of kiddushin are reserved for a union of a man and woman. Orthodox Judaism does not recognize civil marriages to have theological legal standing, be they civil marriages between male and female, or between two adults of the same gender.\n\nIn June 2012, the American branch of Conservative Judaism formally approved same-sex marriage ceremonies in a 13-0 vote.\n\nIn 1996, the Central Conference of American Rabbis passed a resolution approving same-sex civil marriage. However, this same resolution made a distinction between civil marriages and religious marriages; this resolution thus stated:\n\nIn 1998, an ad-hoc CCAR committee on human sexuality issued its majority report (11 to 1, 1 abstention) which stated that the holiness within a Jewish marriage \"may be present in committed same gender relationships between two Jews and that these relationships can serve as the foundation of stable Jewish families, thus adding strength to the Jewish community.\" The report called for CCAR to support rabbis in officiating at same-sex marriages. Also in 1998, the Responsa Committee of the CCAR issued a lengthy \"teshuvah\" (rabbinical opinion) that offered detailed argumentation in support of both sides of the question whether a rabbi may officiate at a commitment ceremony for a same-sex couple.\n\nIn March 2000, CCAR issued a new resolution stating that \"We do hereby resolve that the relationship of a Jewish, same gender couple is worthy of affirmation through appropriate Jewish ritual, and further resolve, that we recognize the diversity of opinions within our ranks on this issue. We support the decision of those who choose to officiate at rituals of union for same-sex couples, and we support the decision of those who do not.\"\n\nThe Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association (RRA) encourages its members to officiate at same-sex marriages, though it does not require it of them.\n\n"}

Greece (application No. 14307/88) is a landmark case of the European Court of Human Rights, decided in 1993 and concerning compatibility of certain sanctions for proselytism with Articles 7 and 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It ruled by a vote of six-to-three that a Jehovah's Witness man's freedom to manifest his religion, protected by Article 9, had been violated by the Greek government. One of the judges wrote that this case was \"of particular importance\" because it was \"the first real case concerning freedom of religion to have come before the European Court since it was set up\" in 1959.\n\nThe crime of proselytism, according to Greek law, meant \"in particular, any direct or indirect attempt to intrude on the religious beliefs of a person of a different religious persuasion (eterodoxos), with the aim of undermining those beliefs, either by any kind of inducement or promise of an inducement or moral support or material assistance, or by fraudulent means or by taking advantage of his inexperience, trust, need, low intellect or naivety\". Greek court has later clarified that \"purely spiritual teaching does not amount to proselytism, even if it demonstrates the errors of other religions and entices possible disciples away from them, who abandon their original religions of their own free will; this is because spiritual teaching is in the nature of a rite of worship performed freely and without hindrance. Outside such spiritual teaching, which may be freely given, any determined, importunate attempt to entice disciples away from the dominant religion by means that are unlawful or morally reprehensible constitutes proselytism as prohibited\".\n\nMr. Minos Kokkinakis, a Jehovah's Witness, and his wife, called at the home of Mrs Kyriakaki in Sitia and engaged in a discussion with her, described by Ms. Kyriakaki as follows: \"They immediately talked to me about Olof Palme, whether he was a pacifist or not, and other subjects that I can’t remember. They talked to me about things I did not understand very well. It was not a discussion but a constant monologue by them. ... If they had told me they were Jehovah’s Witnesses, I would not have let them in. I don’t recall whether they spoke to me about the Kingdom of Heaven. They stayed in the house about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. What they told me was religious in nature, but I don’t know why they told it to me. I could not know at the outset what the purpose of their visit was. They may have said something to me at the time with a view to undermining my religious beliefs... [However,] the discussion did not influence my beliefs\". Mrs Kyriakaki’s husband, who was the cantor at a local Orthodox church, informed the police and Mr. Kokkinakis was convicted for proselytism.\n\nMr. Kokkinakis appealed to the ECtHR under Articles 7, 9, 10 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The court's Commission unanimously held that there had been a violation of Kokkinakis' rights under Article 9.\n\nThe court held that the measure complained of was prescribed by law and was in pursuit of a legitimate aim under Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights, namely the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. However, it found a violation of Article 9 (by six votes to three), reasoning that the interference with Kokkinakis' freedom of religion was not necessary in a democratic society since: a \"distinction has to be made between bearing Christian witness and improper proselytism. The former corresponds to true evangelism, which a report drawn up in 1956 under the auspices of the World Council of Churches describes as an essential mission and a responsibility of every Christian and every Church. The latter represents a corruption or deformation of it. It may, according to the same report, take the form of activities offering material or social advantages with a view to gaining new members for a Church or exerting improper pressure on people in distress or in need; it may even entail the use of violence or brainwashing; more generally, it is not compatible with respect for the freedom of thought, conscience and religion of others. Scrutiny of section 4 of Law no. 1363/1938 shows that the relevant criteria adopted by the Greek legislature are reconcilable with the foregoing if and in so far as they are designed only to punish improper proselytism, which the Court does not have to define in the abstract in the present case. The Court notes, however, that in their reasoning the Greek courts established the applicant’s liability by merely reproducing the wording of section 4 and did not sufficiently specify in what way the accused had attempted to convince his neighbour by improper means. None of the facts they set out warrants that finding. That being so, it has not been shown that the applicant’s conviction was justified in the circumstances of the case by a pressing social need. The contested measure therefore does not appear to have been proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued\".\n\nThe Court rejected (by eight votes to one) applicant's claim that the provision of Greek law serving as ground for his conviction was not sufficiently precise and clear, violating Article 7.\n\nThe Court held unnecessary to examine the case under Article 10 or 14.\n\nJudge Pettiti submitted a partly concurring opinion, considering that the criminal legislation in Greece on proselytism was in itself contrary to Article 9. Judge De Meyer submitted a short concurring opinion.\n\nJudges Foighel and Loizou, jointly, and Judge Valticos filed two dissenting opinions, regarding Article 9 as not violated.\n\nJudge Martens filed a partly dissenting opinion, offering his own rationale for the finding of violation of Article 9 and also considering Article 7 to be violated.\n\n"}

Turners career, this painting depicts a deluge scene where the natural effects of light and weather (the atmosphere) play a crucial role on Turner's concept of vision. The deluge being referred to in the title is the representation of the great flood story told in the Book of Genesis. As suggested by its title, the painting also acknowledges Moses, known as the author of the book of Genesis found in the Old Testament of the Bible. In this painting the role of man is portrayed as passive through his inability to control nature, which is beautiful to the eye yet has the power to destroy and recreate life. This piece also illustrates Turner's belief that God is the one in charge as it is He who creates the flood, allows Noah to survive, and inspired Moses to write the Book of Genesis. Genesis, in this case leads back to the creation of man, light, and the water which light is being reflected on.\n\nFor most of his career Turner, whose works are predominantly subjective, was recognised for his watercolor and oil paintings that reflected landscape images and scenes of natural entities such as the weather, the ocean, the effect of light, and vision. Through the blurring of images, Turner attempts to justify the belief that the eye is always trying to form an image as it tries to recreate nature. Traditionally, colour is used as a type of \"accessory\" to form, but Turner's attraction to light and colour allows colour to take the place of form. The main colours used by Turner were red, yellow, and blue, which is discussed more in depth in relation to other works that influenced that of Turner. His work also illustrates his relationship to the Romantic Movement and position as the precursor of the impressionist movement.\n\nAs expressed in the title of the painting, J.M.W. Turner found interest in Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe's book, \"Theory of Colours\" also known as Zur Farbenlehre, published in 1810.\n\nTurner absorbed Goethe’s theory of light and darkness and depicted their relationship in a number of his paintings, including \"Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory) – the Morning after the Deluge – Moses Writing the Book of Genesis\". According to this theory,the creation of colour is dependent on the distribution of dark and light reflecting through a transparent object. Turner uses main concepts from Goethe’s theory, which is a rejection of Newton's Seven Color Theory, and expresses the belief that every colour was an individualised combination of light and darkness. Newton's reasoning in his theory of light and colour was, in the words of Michael Duck, too \"simplistic\" for Goethe. As a result, Goethe found his own form of vision in regards to the physiological aspects of the concept of colour. As a result, Goethe claims that there is an infinite amount of colour variation, and through his paintings Turner attempts to reflect this theory. Turner also responds to the \"plus\" and \"minus\" concepts that Goethe created to address both emotions and the eye. His main focus was the after image that is left on the retina after seeing an image. Through this after image the \"plus\" addresses the colours red and yellow which is intended to evoke a buoyant feelings, while the colour blue contrasts such as it creates the emotion of melancholy and desolation. According to Goethe's concept, yellow undergoes a transition of light becoming darker when light reaches its peak, just as the sun shines in the sky, it develops to a white light that is colourless. But the light deepens and evolves the yellow into an orange and then finally to a ruby red hue. Turner illustrates the process of yellow transitioning into phases of light by showing how, as the viewer moves away from the centre, the edges get darker.\n\nThe yellowing colouring of the painting is a reference to Goethe’s \"Theory of Colour\", which explains the colour yellow as being the first colour transmitted from light. The form of the painting is circular, symbolising the construction of the human eye, changing the focus of a typical linear splitting of space to a more subjective portrayal. The colour yellow is typically optimistic, but Turner captures the negativity of yellow by attaching the colour to a light that is subject to change. The morning sun aspect of the colour is something transient.\n\n\n\"Light and Colour\" was among three paintings stolen from a Frankfurt museum in 1994. \"Shade and Darkness\" was also taken. In 2002, the Tate Gallery covertly purchased \"Light and Colour\" on the black market for $2 million.\n\n"}

The Manmukh is attached to worldly desires, material wealth, worldly allurements and sensual enjoyments. His desires and his needs are unlimited.\n\nTo be a Manmukh is to follow one's own mind or desires without regards for anyone else. A person who is self-centred is called a Manmukh. The opposite of Manmukh is Gurmukh, which means a person who follows the teaching and life-code as narrated by the guru. A Manmukh is the opposite of a Gurmukh. Hence, a Manmukh is a material being (egoistic or attached to worldly things) as opposed to a spiritual being. The people with materialistic attachment believe that everlasting happiness is attainable only in acquisition (i.e. ownership) and the use of these material objects. In other words, a Manmukh is ruled by and is conditioned by pleasure of his five senses and his mind. Simply stated, a Manmukh is an ego-centric person whose actions are controlled by the following urges and desires: lust, anger, greed, material attachment, self-conceit, envy and stubborn mindedness, with their numerous variations.\n\nAs a result, he has no belief no understanding of the Naam (God's existence), Shabad (word of the guru), Hukam (will of the Almighty), Atma (Soul), or God (Spirit or Sat Guru). Consequently, he has no understanding of the ultimate purpose of life, his relationship with God, and the way of God (Gurmat). In this madness and illusion and \"I-am-ness\", he cultivates the life of a faithless cynic called \"Saakat\" — an unwise and an untrue being. Thus, according to the Gurbani, anyone who has not realized the Self within (God, Truth, Shabad or Naam, etc.) alone is a Manmukh.\n\nEveryone in the world can be categorised as either a servant of Maya or a servant of the Akal. Those who serve Maya are called Manmukhs, and those who serve the Truth (God) are called Gurmukhs or Divine. Thus, a Manmukh regardless of how advanced he may be in his or her material qualifications by education or cultural status, lacks in Divine qualities; consequently, is not aware of the Cosmic Reality that is contained within him/her. Such individuals fail to attain Spiritual Perfection or Intuitive Understanding of the \"ultimate reality\"; for their intellect is dimmed by material contamination. They hate holiness. They chase after Maya, and wander in this dense forest of material existence like a beast in human garb.\n\nA Manmukh lifestyle is void of humility, contentment, compassion, love and spiritual wisdom. Such lifestyle exhibits nothing but undesirable qualities in a person. To make us aware of Manmukhs and their conduct, Gurbani has provided us with numerous symptoms of such material beings caught in the vertex of unenlightened existence. Some of these symptoms include: egoism, ignorance, selfishness, duality, bondage, evil-mindedness, falsehood, violence, untruthfulness, doubts, superstitions, uncontrolled senses, identification with the feeling of \"I, me, mine, your\", lust, anger, greed, attachment, self pride, self-conceit; superstitious, jealousy and enviousness, stubborn mindedness, hatred, fanaticism, conflicts, lack of contentment, material hankering and lamentation, lack of mental control and inner peace, self-centredness, are full of quarrel and contentions, lack of faith, ritualistic, unhappy, always interested in taking instead of giving, affinity for bad association, lack of self-discipline, mental agitation, unceasing wandering (rat-race), begging material things from God, complaining, finding faults in others, unable to bear pains and sorrows of life, love for material world instead of the Self within, corruption, fraud, larceny and swindling, bribery, cheating, lying, plundering, stealing, fond of mental speculations and material logic, attachment to material world, deceitful nature, fearful, unceasing desire for sense objects, cynicism, hypocrisy, always wanting to control the world, always wanting to be appreciated, unceasing hunger for name and fame, love for titles and honor, divisiveness, prejudices, cruelty, bigotry, unnatural diet, indulgence in worldly pleasures, illusion, delusion, wrong identity, stupor, obstinate error, love of Maya or worldliness, crookedness, animosity, and so on. Opposite to these are the attributes of Gurmukhs (Spiritual Beings)\n\nAccording to the Gurbani, a Manmukh is not a question of heredity, family of birth, ancestry, race, region, social status, caste, creed, education, titles, religion or any peculiar external appearance of a person; it is a question of lack of Naam Simran, self-evaluation, unenlightened existence, cynicism, egoism, ignorance, hypocrisy, bondage, mental delusion, body-consciousness, mistaken identity, and so on.\n\nThe Sikh scriptures have some very harsh word to say to the Manmukh. Below are several quotations from the Holy Text:\n\nFrom Sri Guru Granth Sahib:\n\n"}

After sunset every day, Khonvoum gathers fragments of the stars and throws them into the sun to revitalize it for the next day. He occasionally contacts mortals through Gor (a thunder god who is also an elephant) or a chameleon (similar to the divine messenger used by Orish-nla of Yoruba mythology). Khonvoum created mankind from clay. Black people were made from black clay, white people came from white clay, and the Pygmies themselves came from red clay. He also creates the animals that are needed by hunters.\n\nArebati is a lunar deity and Sky Father. In some sources, he was said to have created humanity from clay, instead of Khonvoum.\n\nTore is a god of the forests who supplies animals to hunters. He is also a thunder god who appears as a storm and hides in rainbows. Most importantly, Tore appears as a leopard in the initiation rites. The first Pygmies stole fire from Tore; he chased them but could not catch them, and when he returned home, his mother had died. As punishment, he decreed that humans would also die, and he thus became the death god.\n\nNegoogunogumbar is a child-eating giant. Obrigwabibikwa is a dwarf who can change himself into a reptile.\n\nA Mbuti soul is called a megbe. When a man dies, his son places his mouth over his to draw in part of the \"megbe\". Another part inhabits the man's totem animal. If the son does not inhale the megbe or the totem animal is later killed, it may escape into the forest, where it becomes a semi-visible being called a Lodi and lives forever with others like it.\n\n"}

It falls on the 7th day of the 7th lunar month on the Chinese calendar. \n\nThe festival originated from the romantic legend of two lovers, Zhinü and Niulang, who were the weaver girl and the cowherd, respectively. The tale of \"The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl\" has been celebrated in the Qixi Festival since the Han dynasty. The earliest-known reference to this famous myth dates back to over 2600 years ago, which was told in a poem from the \"Classic of Poetry\". The Qixi festival inspired the Tanabata festival in Japan and Chilseok festival in Korea.\n\nThe festival has variously been called the \"Double Seventh Festival\", the \"Chinese Valentine's Day\", the \"Night of Sevens\", or the \"Magpie Festival\".\n\nThe general tale is a love story between Zhinü (the weaver girl, symbolizing Vega) and Niulang (the cowherd, symbolizing Altair). Their love was not allowed, thus they were banished to opposite sides of the Silver River (symbolizing the Milky Way). Once a year, on the 7th day of the 7th lunar month, a flock of magpies would form a bridge to reunite the lovers for one day. There are many variations of the story.\n\nDuring the Han dynasty, the practices were conducted in accordance to formal ceremonial state rituals. Over time, the festival activities also included customs that the common people partook.\n\nGirls take part in worshiping the celestials (拜仙) during rituals. They go to the local temple to pray to Zhinü for wisdom. Paper items are usually burned as offerings. Girls may recite traditional prayers for dexterity in needlework, which symbolize the traditional talents of a good spouse. Divination could take place to determine possible dexterity in needlework. They make wishes for marrying someone who would be a good and loving husband. During the festival, girls make a display of their domestic skills. Traditionally, there would be contests amongst those who attempted to be the best in threading needles under low-light conditions like the glow of an ember or a half moon. Today, girls sometimes gather toiletries in honor of the seven maidens.\n\nThe festival also held an importance for newlywed couples. Traditionally, they would worship the celestial couple for the last time and bid farewell to them (辭仙). The celebration stood symbol for a happy marriage and showed that the married woman was treasured by her new family.\n\nOn this day, the Chinese gaze to the sky to look for Vega and Altair shining in the Milky Way, while a third star forms a symbolic bridge between the two stars. It was said that if it rains on this day that it was caused by a river sweeping away the magpie bridge or that the rain is the tears of the separated couple. Based on the legend of a flock of magpies forming a bridge to reunite the couple, a pair of magpies came to symbolize conjugal happiness and faithfulness.\n\nInteractive Google doodles have been launched since the 2009 Qixi Festival to mark the occasion. The latest was launched for the 2018 Qixi Festival.\n\n\nHard copy\n\nOnline\n"}

They are either \"sacra privata\" or \"publica\". The former were undertaken on behalf of the individual by himself, on behalf of the family by the pater familias, or on behalf of the \"gens\" by the whole body of the people.\n\nThe centre of the domestic service of the gods is formed by the worship of the Penates and Lares. In particular cases recourse was also had to certain specified deities. Besides this, private sacra were attached to particular families; these passed to the heir with the succession and became a burden on him. Hence an inheritance without sacra [\"hereditas sine sacris\"] proverbially signified an unimpaired piece of good fortune. If a patrician wished to become a plebeian he had to renounce his familial sacra, his gens and his curia. As the family had sacra, so also had the gens, which had arisen out of the family by expansion. These were performed by a sacrificial priest flamen appointed from among the gentiles, the celebration taking place in his own house or in a special sacellum in the presence of the assembled gentiles.\n\nSacra Privata typically takes place within the family. An individual might perform sacra at any time and whenever they thought it necessary; but if he vowed such sacra before the pontiffs and wished that they should be continued after his death, his heirs inherited with his property the obligation to perform them, and the pontiffs had to watch that they were performed duly and at their proper time. Even though Sacra could take place at any time, however, the devout Roman prayed and made a sacrifice typically during meal times. The usual time was between dinner and dessert. When possible, a pig was sacrificed. Proper ceremonies accompanied all family occasions from birth to death, even when the gods were no longer popular. The gens of families had special rites, sacra. It must be maintained for the welfare of the clan and State. If not, it was believed that gods will become displeased with the pater familias. In return, their supposed underworld relatives, the malicious and vagrant Lemures, might be placated with midnight offerings of black beans and spring water.\n\nFor home sacrifices, citizens would usually use foods instead of animals because they were less messy. However, it was not unheard of. Many families would use small animals for their blood sacrifices. Some foods that they would use were wine, cheese, fruits, milk, honey cakes, honeycombs, and grapes. Families would also use incense, fire, or wreaths if they wanted a sacrifice that was more permanent. Romans would use sacrifices that represented life. If their ancestors became angry, they would placate them with an offering of black beans and spring water at midnight.\n\nLares, a household protector, was housed in a shrine along with the penates and favorite gods or goddesses. In the homes of the lower class, the shrines were set in wall-niches with a basic painted background, whereas the upper class, built their shrines in the servants quarters. This kept the focus on religion instead of making it a public showing.\n\nThe sacra publica were undertaken pro populo, i.e., collectively, (1) by the curia, pagi, or vici, into which the community was divided, whence such sacrifices were called sacra popularia; or (2) by the individual gentes and societies, i.e., the sodalitas, to which the superintendence of a particular cult had been committed by the State; or (3) by the magistrates and priests of the Roman State. The sacra of the gentes were with few exceptions performed in public, though the multitude present remained silent spectators; only in a few cases they took part in the procession to the place of worship or in the sacrificial feast.\n\nThe public religious practices of Ancient Rome served multiple purposes due to the nature of its religion. In ancient Rome, religion and the affairs of the state were closely intertwined so that the state religion was a mode of political power. Religious rituals and festivals were often held in order to calm and distract the people. This can be seen through the establishment of the Apollinares around the time of the Second Punic War. These public affairs were meant to honor the gods by either consisting of sporting competitions, such as the Apollinares, or religious rituals. When these rituals consisted of sacrifice, they were controlled by the Emperor and the Elites\n\nThe correct practice of rituals, or orthopraxis was essential to currying favor of the gods. Public ceremonies were presided over by some sort of authority from the higher social class over public affairs, and in some rare cases specifically women. The presider would begin the ceremony at the start of the day and bathe himself or herself thoroughly beforehand. Any civilians in attendance would wear togas with a hood over their heads while the presider was bareheaded, often with a laurel wreath on his head for distinction. In live sacrifices, only domestic religion in ancient Rome were used. These animals were cleaned and often decorated with ribbons or garlands with colors dependent on the god or goddess for whom they were intended. The Romans would also use fruit and grains in public ceremonies as well as libations or drinks. These inanimate sacrifices were not less significant than live animal sacrifices, but rather they all served different purposes and went to different deities.\n"}

A female novice is a \"śrāmaṇerī\" or \"śrāmaṇerikā\" (Sanskrit; Pāli: \"sāmaṇerī\").\n\nThe \"sāmaṇera\" is a Pali language diminutive of the Sanskrit term \"śrāmaṇa\" \"strenuous\", which indicates an ascetic practitioner. Therefore, sāmaṇera might be said to mean \"small or young renunciate\". In some South and Southeast Asian Buddhist traditions, the term refers to someone who has taken the initial pravrajya vows but not the upasampada or full ordination. The prātimokṣa rules do not apply to them and they do not take part in the recital of the rules on uposatha days.\n\nThe word \"śrāmaṇerī\" is the feminine form of \"śrāmaṇera\".\n\nThe account provided in the literature of South Asian Buddhism (and adopted by other Buddhist sects) is that when Gautama Buddha's son Rāhula was seven years old, he followed the Buddha, saying \"Give me my inheritance.\" The Buddha called Sariputta and asked him to ordain Rāhula, who became the first sāmaṇera.\n\nIn the Vinaya (monastic regulations) used by many South Asian Buddhist sects, a man under the age of 20 cannot ordain as a bhikṣu (monk) but can ordain as a sāmaṇera. Sāmaṇeras (and sāmaṇerīs – the equivalent term for girls) keep the Ten Precepts as their code of behaviour and devote themselves to the religious life during breaks from secular schooling, or in conjunction with it if devoted to formal ordination. In other cultures and Buddhist traditions (particularly North East Asia, and those in the West that derive from these lineages), monks take different sets of vows, and follow different customary rules.\n\nThe Ten Precepts upheld by sāmaṇeras are:\n\nOrdination differs between sāmaṇeras and srāmaṇerīs.\n\nAfter a year or at the age of 20, a sāmaṇera will be considered for the upasampada or higher ordination as a bhikṣu. Some monasteries will require people who want to ordain as a monk to be a novice for a set period of time, as a period of preparation and familiarization. Adults would normally wear the white robes of a Brahmin.\n\nA woman is to be ordained, according to the traditional vinayas, by both a monk and a nun, first as a śrāmaṇerī.

In 2011 it was officially recognised by the government of Fujian.\n\nThe religion is based on Confucian moral ideas and ancestral worship, and includes meditation techniques modeled after \"neidan\" and pursuit of enlightenment. Differently from other Chinese folk religious sects, the Sanyi philosophy is not expounded in the sentimental vernacular language but in the elaborate language of the Confucian literary tradition. The \"Three in One\" is a philosophical concept expressing the original trinity proceeding from the Tao, the two principles, yin and yang, of the Great Pole. The Great Pole is the One that contains yin and yang, the Two, in the Three.\n\nSanyiism was founded by Lin Zhao'en (1517–98), in Putian, Fujian. Lin was born in an upper-class family, and among his ancestors and relatives were many officials and scholars. He started the usual career for the son of an influential family and passed the first civil examinations in 1534, but after failing the higher exams he forsook the career of an official to become a master of religion and philosophy according to the Confucian tradition. Given this background, Lin Zhao'en doctrines show little influence from the vernacular folk religious tradition of the \"baojuan\" literature.\n\nLin Zhao'en was instructed by other religious leaders, including a Confucian who taught him the true meaning of the Confucian classics and Taoists from whom he learnt \"neidan\" techniques.\n\nIn 1585 the regional official Yang Sizhi wrote a proclamation of heterodoxy against Lin, upset by his claim to be the true interpreter of the Confucian tradition, rejecting Zhu Xi, and to continue the teachings of the sages of antiquity. Despite the accusation of heterodoxy, the strength of the sect remained unshaken.\n\nIn Sanyi holy scriptures Lin Zhao'en is portrayed as a supernatural savior of cosmic significance. After Lin died, he was deified as the \"Lord of the Three-in-One\", and is worshipped in over a thousand temples in Fujian, and also in Taiwan and Southeast Asia's Chinese communities.\n\nThe religious community split into a number of schools and spread beyond the borders of Fujian up to Anhui, and then reaching Beijing. The community in Nanjing developed as an influential centre of gravitation for the religion. In Fujian, the religion developed into two major competing branches led by two direct disciples of Master Lin, namely Lu Wenhui and Lin Zhenming (alias Lin Zhijing). Through the Qing dynasty the religion survived strong in Fujian but declined elsewhere, and at the end of the 19th century it started to strongly revive.\n\nAs of 1998 the Church of the Three-in-One had approximately 500,000 adherents in Putian, which is 17% of the total population. In 2011 it was officially recognised as a legal religion by the government of Fujian.\n\nThree-in-One practices include the \"heart method\" of self-cultivation, which is still widely practised in Putian today. The religion has its independent ritual tradition, similar to those of Taoism and Buddhism. Its ritual specialists perform communal offerings (\"jiao\") and funeral services (\"gongde\"), along with individual rites.\n\nIn some communities in the Putian region, the Sanyi temple has become the primary village temple, centre of collective life. Annual pilgrimages are made to the religion's central temple in Putian, Fujian.\n\n\n\n"}

Defined as an historic district, it includes about half of the original buildings and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Shirley Shaker Village began in 1793. Hundreds of acres of land was donated by John Warren, Elijah and Ivory Wildes, and Nathan Willard near their properties. At its peak there were 26 buildings; Now there are 13. Within the community there were the North, South and Church families. By 1853 there were 150 believers, or members, and the community continued into the 20th century.\n\nThe buildings were first made of clapboard and painted yellow and white. After the 1840s and the founding of a brick factory nearby, new buildings were constructed of brick. The brick administration building was styled similarly to one at the Canterbury Shaker Village in New Hampshire. The interiors of the buildings were described by William Dean Howells in 1875 as \n\"the unpapered walls, the scrubbed floors hidden only by rugs and strips of carpeting, and the plain flat finish of the wood-work. Each chamber accommodates two brothers or sisters, and is appointed with two beds, two rocking chairs, two wash stands, and a wood stove with abundance of rugs. There were few tokens of personal taste in the arrangements of the rooms.\"\n\nThe Shakers earned income by producing and selling jellies, applesauce, herbs, mops and brooms. When the community dwindled and they were no longer able to be self-supporting, in 1908 \"believers\" moved to the Hancock Shaker Village.\n\nThe state purchased the property in 1909 and adapted it for use as an \"industrial school\" for troubled and delinquent boys. Extensive changes were made to the property, resulting in the movement, alteration, and demolition of buildings.\n\nIn 1971 the school was closed. New construction was done on site and the total facility was converted into the Massachusetts Correctional Institution complex. A historic district, encompassing the Shaker-related resources on more than of land in Shirley and Lancaster, was defined and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The Shirley Historical Society arranges periodic tours of the former Shirley Shaker Village.\n\nSeveral other Shaker village sites operate today as museums. A similar community was founded in nearby Harvard. The meetinghouse of Shirley Shaker Village was moved in 1962 to Hancock Shaker Village in Pittsfield to replace an identical one which burned and then was razed in 1938.\n\nToday, only one \"society\" remains in the control of the last Shakers, located at Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village in New Gloucester, Maine.\n\n\n"}

The popular beliefthat Benevento would be the Italian witches' gathering placehas abundant implications, blurring the border between reality and imagination. Various writers, musicians, and artists have drawn inspiration from or referred to it.\n\nMany hypotheses on the birth of the witches' legend exist. It has probably been the synergy of several elements that gave Benevento lasting fame as the \"city of witches.\"\n\nFor a brief period during Roman times, the cult of Isis, Egyptian goddess of the moon, proliferated in Benevento; also, the emperor Domitian had a temple erected in her honor.\n\nWithin this cult Isis was part of a sort of Trimurti: she became identified with Hecate, goddess of the underworld, and Diana, goddess of the hunt. These deities were also connected with magic.\n\nThe cult of Isis probably stands on the basis of some elements of paganism that survived in succeeding centuries: the characteristics of some witches can be connected with those of Hecate, and the same term used for witches in Benevento, \"janara\", arguably could be derived from the name of Diana.\n\nThe chief physician of Benevento, Pietro Piperno, in his essay \"On the Superstitious Walnut Tree of Benevento\" (1639, translated from his original Latin \"De Nuce Maga Beneventana\"), traced the roots of the witch legend back to the seventh century. At that time Benevento was the capital of a Lombard duchy. The invaders, although formally converted to Catholicism, did not renounce their traditional pagan religion. Under Duke Romuald I they worshiped a golden viper (perhaps winged, or with two heads), which probably had some connection with the cult of Isis, since the goddess was able to control serpents. They began to develop a singular rite near the Sabato river, which the Lombards celebrated in honor of Wotan, father of the gods: the hide of a goat was hung on a sacred tree. The warriors earned the favor of the god by rushing frantically around the tree on horseback and striking the hide with their lances, with the intent of tearing off shreds, which they then ate. In this ritual can be recognized the practice of \"diasparagmos\", the god sacrificed and torn to pieces, which became the ritual meal of the devotees.\n\nThe Christians of Benevento would have connected these frenzied rites with their already-existing beliefs about witches: in their eyes the women and the warriors were witches, the goat was the incarnation of the Devil, and the cries were orgiastic rites.\n\nA priest named Saint Barbatus of Benevento outright accused the Lombard rulers of idolatry. According to the legend, when Benevento was besieged by forces of the Byzantine emperor Constans II in 663, Duke Romuald promised Barbatus to renounce paganism if the city—and the duchy—were saved. Constans withdrew (according to the legend, by divine grace), and Romuald made Barbatus the bishop of Benevento.\n\nSaint Barbatus cut down the sacred tree and tore out its roots, and on that spot he had a church built, called Santa Maria in Voto. Romuald continued to worship the golden viper in private, until his wife Teodorada handed it over to St. Barbatus, who melted it down to make a chalice for the Eucharist.\n\nThis legend is incompatible with the historical facts. In 663 the duke of Benevento was Grimoald, while Romuald I would not succeed his predecessor until 671, having become King of the Lombards in the meantime; moreover, Romualdo's wife was named Theuderada—not Teodorada, who was instead the wife of Ansprand and mother of Liutprand. In any case, Paul the Deacon neither mentioned the legend, nor the presumed pagan faith of Romuald, who was much more likely to have been an Arian like his father Grimoald.\n\nThe meetings under the walnut tree, one of the main features of the witch legend, therefore very probably came from these Lombard customs; nevertheless, they are also found in the practices of the cultus of Artemis (the Greek goddess who can in part be assimilated to Isis), carried out in the Anatolian region of Caria.\n\nThe first centuries of the diffusion of Christianity were characterized by a harsh battle against the pagan, rural, and traditional culti. The basic principle is that any cultus which is not oriented toward the one God is, by elimination, subservience to the Devil. This explains the demonization of rituals like those of the Lombard women in Benevento, who became \"witches\" in a wider sense with regard to how they were understood by popular culture. Originally, in effect, the potential wickedness of these women was not in the context of a religious sense; Christianity depicted them as women who had made a pact with the Devil, and as a sort of opposite to the Madonna, dedicated to orgiastic rites and bearers of infertility.\n\nIn the following centuries the legend of the witches took form. Beginning in 1273 reports of witches' gatherings began to circulate in Benevento. Based on the statements of Matteuccia da Todi, who was put on trial for witchcraft in 1428, they took place under a walnut tree, and it was believed that it was the tree that had been cut down by Barbatus, perhaps restored by the work of the Devil or, rather, replanted by the witches from seed. Later, in the 16th century, bones with the flesh recently stripped off were found under a tree; an aura of mystery was created around the matter, gradually becoming more complex.\n\nAccording to the testimony of the presumed witches, the walnut must have been a tall tree, ever green, and of a \"noxious nature\". There are various hypotheses about the location of the Riverbank of the \"Janara\"s, the place on the bank of the Sabato where the walnut tree would be found. The legend does not rule out that there could have been more than one. Pietro Piperno, intending to prove the rumor to be false, included in his essay a map that indicated a possible positioning of several walnut tees.\n\nOther versions have the walnut tree located in a gorge called the Strait of Barba, in Ceppaloni on the road to Avellino, where there was a grove flanked by an abandoned church, or in another location called Plain of the Chapels. Even the vanished Pagan Tower is spoken of, on which was built a chapel to St. Nicholas where the saint had worked numerous miracles.\n\nThere were several nut trees forming a circular shape near what is now the , just at the outskirts of the city, where witches would dance and chant: \"To the nut tree of Benevento, over the water, over the wind.\"\n\n\"'Nguento, 'nguento,\"<br>\n\"mànname a lu nocio 'e Beneviento\",<br>\n\"sott'a ll'acqua e sotto ô viento,\"<br>\n\"sotto â ogne maletiempo.\"\n\nUnguent, unguent,<br>\nCarry me to the walnut tree of Benevento,<br>\nAbove the water and above the wind,<br>\nAnd above all other bad weather.\n\nThe legend has it that the witches, indistinguishable from the other women by day, at night anointed their underarms (or their breasts) with an unguent and took off flying, pronouncing a magic phrase (recounted above), riding on brooms of sorghum. At the same time the witches became incorporeal, spirits like the wind; indeed, their preferred nights for flying were stormy ones. In particular, it was further believed that there was a bridge from which the witches of Benevento usually launched themselves into flight, which was therefore called the \"bridge of the \"jannara\"s,\" destroyed during World War II. At night they stole horses out of their stables and after plaiting the horses' hair they would race the horse until it started to foam around the mouth; they would then rub themselves with it.\n\nWitches of various origins participated in the sabbats under the walnut tree. These sabbats consisted of banquets, dances, and orgies with spirits and demons in the form of cats or goats, and they also came to be called the \"games of Diana.\"\n\nAfter the gatherings the witches spread horror. It was believed that they were able to cause abortions, to generate deformities in newborns, making them suffer dreadful afflictions, which brushed against sleepers like a gust of wind and caused a sense of oppression on the chest, which at times was felt while they lay on their backs. Also feared were certain more \"innocent\" pranks, which, for example, would make the horses be found in their stables in the morning with their manes braided, or sweating from having been ridden all night. In some small Campanian villages, rumors circulated among the elderly that they kidnapped newborns from their cradles in order to be passed among them, throwing them on the fire, and finishing the game by bringing them back to where they had taken them from.\n\nThe \"janara\"s, because of their incorporeal consistency, entered a house by passing under the door (corresponding with another possible etymology of the term: \"ianua\", 'door'. For this reason a broom or some salt was usually left on the threshold; the witch would have to count all the fibers of the broom or grains of salt before entering, but in the meantime the day would arrive and they would be compelled to go away. The two objects have a symbolic value: the broom is a phallic symbol opposed to the sterility brought by the witch; the salt was connected through a false etymology to \"salus\" ('safety').\n\nIf someone was harassed by a \"janara\", they freed themselves from her by shouting behind her \"Come get the salt on Sunday!\" If \"janara\"s were mentioned in a conversation, the ill omen was warded off with the sentence \"Today is Saturday.\"\n\nBesides the \"janara\"s, there were other types of witches in the popular imagination of Benevento. The \"zucculara\" ('lame person') haunted Triggio, the medieval Lombard quarter, the area of the Roman Theater, and she was called that because of her noisy clogs. The figure probably derives from Hecate, who wore only one sandal and was venerated at the crossroads (the name \"Triggio\" derives from \"trivium\", 'crossroads').\n\nThere is also the \"manalonga\", 'the one with the long arm', who lives in wells and pulls down passersby in the vicinity. The fear of pits, imagined to be the passageways to hell, is a recurring element: in the cliff under the Bridge of the \"Janara\"s there is a pool in which whirlpools are suddenly formed, which is called \"the whirlpool of hell.\" Finally, there are the \"uria\"s, domestic spirits who recall the lares and penates of Roman times.\n\nIn popular beliefs the legend of the witches still survives in part today, enhanced by anecdotes and manifested in superstitious attitudes and fear of supernatural events.\n\nThe persecutions of the purported witches may be considered to have begun with the preaching of Saint Bernardino of Siena, who preached harshly against them in the 15th century, referring in particular to those of Benevento. He denounced them to the people as responsible for disasters and bluntly asserted that they must be exterminated.\n\nA final incentive to witch hunting came from the publication of \"Malleus Maleficarum\" in 1486, which explained how to recognize witches and how to try them effectively and interrogate them using the cruelest tortures. From the 15th to the 17th centuries, many confessions were coerced from supposed witches in this way, who often spoke of sabbats in Benevento. Common elements turned up, such as flight or practices like that of sucking children's blood; however, discrepancies also turned up about, for example the frequency of their meetings. In the great majority of cases the \"witches\" were burned, sent to the gallows, or otherwise given the death penalty, with more or less atrocious methods.\n\nOnly in the 17th century was it realized that truthful confessions could not be made under torture. During the Enlightenment a rational interpretation of the legend came to prevail with Girolamo Tartarotti, who in 1749 explained the witches' flight as a hallucination provoked by the Devil, or Ludovico Antonio Muratori, who in 1745 asserted that the witches were only psychologically ill women. Successive hypotheses held that the unguent the witches were anointed with was a hallucinogenic substance.\n\nA local historian, Abele De Blasio, reported that in the archepiscopal archive of Benevento were kept the records of about two hundred trials for witchcraft, largely destroyed in 1860 to avoid saving documents that could further inflame the anticlerical tendencies that accompanied the era of Italian unification. Another part was lost because of the bombardments in World War II.\n\nLike all popular beliefs, the legend of the witches is fueled by a large number of popularly spread tales.\n\n\nItalian and foreign poets and writers, as well as musicians and others, relate tales of the witches, taking inspiration from the Benevento legend.\n\n\n"}

The first vision proclaimed that \"within a few moons there was to be a great upheaval or earthquake... [during which] the improvements of the whites-all their houses, their goods, stores, etc.-would remain, but the whites would be swallowed up, while the Indians would be saved and permitted to enjoy the earth and all the fullness thereof, including anything left by the wicked whites\". This selective earthquake was met with skepticism, so after a second trip to the mountain, Wodziwob received a new prophecy that stated that all peoples would be swallowed by the earthquakes, and after a few days the Native Americans would return to a paradisiacal world while the whites would be destroyed. As the time period began to pass, many became disenchanted with Wodziwob's prophecies. This prompted him to make a third trip to the mountain, where it was revealed to him that those \"who believed in the prophecy would be resurrected and be happy, but those who did not believe in it would stay in the ground and be damned forever with the whites\". An additional prophecy stating that a train carrying the dead would come from the east within four years is also attributed to Wodziwob (although this may have been a later addition by his disciple, Weneyuga). By the time of Wodziwob's death in 1872, he had apparently removed the destruction of whites from his prophecy, replacing it with the idea that all were to be granted eternal life with no racial distinction being made.\n\nWeneyuga would proselytize the prophecy of Wodziwob for several years after Wodziwob's death, but after the failure of the train to restore the dead within four years, he essentially retired and became a respected medicine man until his death in the 1910s, with the majority of direct activities centered on Wodziwob's message not surviving the 1870s.\n\nOne of his followers may have been Numu-tibo'o (also known as Tavibo), who for several decades was incorrectly identified as being the same man as Wodziwob. Numu-tibo'o was the father of Wovoka, who re-introduced a version of the Ghost Dance in 1890.\n"}

Zabulistan translates to \"land of Zabul\" or \"land of the Zabuls\". The name \"Zabuls\" is probably a transliteration of Zunbils, a Hindu dynasty that ruled the area during the Islamic conquest of Afghanistan.\n\nBabur, founder of the Mughal dynasty in the 16th century, records in Baburnama that the territory south of the Hindu Kush between Kandahar and Ghazni is generally known as Zabulistan. According to Persian mythology, city of Zabol in eastern Iran, was the birthplace of Iranian hero Rostam.\n\nFrom the 7th century to 11th century, the region was ruled by Shahi kings. Later, it was conquered by the Ghaznavids of Ghazni.\n\nAccording to book writer André Wink,\nAccording to another book by William Bayne Fisher and Richard Nelson Frye:\n\nThe region of southern Afghanistan was first invaded by Muslim Arabs from Zaranj in what is now Nimruz Province. From there they marched toward Bost, Kandahar, Zabulistan, and reached Kabul. In 683 Kabul revolted and defeated the Muslim army, but two years later Zabul's army was routed by the Arabs.\n\nVarious scholars have recorded the importance of Sakawand as a major centre of Hindu pilgrimage.\n\n"}

He is saki-mitama and kushi-mitama of Ōkuninushi and associated with Mount Miwa and is worshipped at the Ōmiwa shrine there.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Sujin (around 97-30 BCE), a plague affected the country. After Ōmononushi's descendant, Ōtataneko, petitioned the kami, the Emperor had a dream in which Ōmononushi appeared to him and claimed responsibility for the plague, announcing that it would not stop until an appropriate priesthood was set up on Mount Miwa. When the Emperor created such a priesthood, the plague ceased. Ōmononushi was worshipped as a nature spirit who provided good weather and bountiful harvests, and was strongly associated with snakes.\n\nAt least two legends tell of Ōmononushi fathering children with human women. On one occasion he transformed himself into an arrow in order to impregnate a girl named Seyadatarahime, whilst on another occasion he used the form of a snake to have a son with the maiden Ikutamayorihime. In the \"Kojiki\" he is recognised as the ancestor of Himetataraisuzu-hime (Isukeyorihime), the spouse of Emperor Jimmu.\n"}
