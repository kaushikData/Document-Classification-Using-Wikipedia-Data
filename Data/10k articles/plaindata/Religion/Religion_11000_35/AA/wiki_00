{"id": "46184815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46184815", "title": "Asraya", "text": "Asraya\n\nĀśraya (Sanskrit: आश्रय) variously means – base, source, assistance, shelter, protection, refuge, dependence, having recourse to or depending on. In terms of Hindu philosophy, the living entity or \"Jiva\" is \"āśraya\", and Brahman or the Supreme Being, the Godhead, is \"viśaya\", the supreme objective, the goal of life Bhagavata Purana (VII.x.6). But, this word - \"āśraya\" conveying the primary meaning – 'refuge', immediately relates with the deity which is worshipped rather than with the abstract Brahman, the substratum of all that exists.\n\nVishishtadvaita Vedanta, which promotes qualified-monism, holds the belief that \"Jiva\" is \"anu\" or monadic in substance. \"Jiva\" though infinitesimal, is the individual \"atman\" harboured by a body, which \"atman\" the Mundaka Upanishad tells us, to be known by the mind is capable of becoming infinite through its attributive knowledge. \"Jiva\" is \"kartā\" and \"bhoktā\", both; it is the \"āśraya\" for \"jñāna\", the substrate for \"krti\" or \"prayatna\" (effort) caused by the desire to act. Therefore, \"Jiva\" is the \"āśraya\" for the states of experience that invariably involve changes in mental disposition without affecting the \"Jiva\".\n\nShankara does not consider \"avidyā\" (ignorance) as something positively existent, he does not speak about its \"vikśepa-śakti\" (power of dispersion) or \"avarna-sakti\" (power of concealment); he does not raise \"avidyā\" to an eternal metaphysical entity. Shankara also does not subscribe to the view that the individual soul is the bearer of \"avidyā\" (āśraya) or to the contention that the Paramatman is the \"āśraya\" of \"avidyā\" as is held by Mandana and Vācaspati. He reiterates that for an awakened person there is no \"avidyā\" to delude and cause pain or pleasure. In the context of the origin of the world (the original state is called \"avyakta\") he terms Parameswara-Brahman as the āśraya of nāmarūpe (the physical presence which name manifests) and that Brahman is the āspada (locus) of the cosmic vyavahāra imagined by avidya.\n\nKnowledge implies the subject which knows and the object that is known. Suppression (\"avarna\") precedes substitution (\"viksepa\"); \"avidyā\" makes one misapprehend and therefore it is described as positive (\"bhāva-rūpa\"), and does not contradict \"vidyā\" (knowledge). With regard to the transmigrating souls, Shankara does speak about the \"bhūta- āśraya\" or elementary substratum or material substratum of the soul, the subtle body, and about the \"karma- āśraya\" or moral substratum connected with \"vāsanās\" (impressions), \"karma\" (works ordained or forbidden) and \"pūrvaprajñā\" (previous experience) but he does not accept the existence of subtle persisting elements of works or preparatory elements of fruits called \"apurva\" because of their non-spiritual nature.\n\nAccording to the Bhagavata Purana (one of the 18 Mahapuranas or 18 Major Puranas) the personal aspect of God is the Āśraya of the ātmā.\n\nCondition of existence (\"gati\"), according to Jain philosophy, is the state of a soul shaped by \"gati-nama-karma\" (body-condition-making) or is the cause of the soul passing through any one of the four conditions of existence – hellish, sub-human, human and celestial. They subscribe to the view that in a thing which is permanent the existence of \"sāmānaya\" and \"samavāya\" is complete, that means that common properties cannot exist without individuals possessing them; the individuals are the \"āśraya\"; \"sāmānaya\" and \"samavāya\" is complete in one substance will not exist without \"āśraya\" (substratum).\n\nVasubandhu explains that the \"āśraya\" (foundation or support) of the fundamental change that indicates \"ātmabhāva\" (psychophysical continuum) is the non-conceptual wisdom free from the duality of the apprehender and the apprehended; \"āśraya\" refers to obscured \"tathagatagarbha\" (the fourth vajra-point) and its change (\"tataparāvrtti\") which is enlightenment (the fifth vajra-point). It is possible to replace one \"āśraya\" with another by freeing the \"ayatanas\" (internal and external sense- bases) from physical and mental impregnations of negative tendencies which bring about craving, suffering etc., by cultivating calm abiding and superior insight, which process activates the\"ayatanas\" associated with awareness (\"vidyā\") that purify all impregnations of negative tendencies and involve raising oneself to \"śuddhāśrayabhūmi\", the level of pure superior intention, never to return to the lower realms or suffer rebirth.\n\n\"Tathatā\" is the basis of transcendental wisdom, and \"Bhūtatathatā\" is the genuine 'Suchness', the essential nature of phenomenal existence, the self-identical universality, the grounding (\"āśraya\") truth of finite particularity. The Buddhists believe that the \"skandhas\", the \"ayatanas\" and the \"dhātus\" are the \"dharmas\" that constitute the phenomenal world and are the forms (and the conditioning factors) in which consciousness appears to itself. \"Bhūtatathatā\" is the \"āśraya\" i.e. the basis which is to be transformed (\"āśraya-paravritti\"), and also the \"āśraya\" which is the result of the transformation. Therefore, it is the \"āśraya\" of delusion and awakening. The \"Mahāyāna-samparigrahaśāshtra\" tells us that the mind of Reality is ever obstructed by \"āveṇkī avidyā\" which is \"manas\", the seventh consciousness and the \"āśraya\" of \"mano-vijñāna\" and the five sensorial consciousnesses evolved from self-patterning of the Absolute; the attachment of \"manas\" to \"ātmagrāha\" (egohood) and \"dharmagrāha\" (thinghood) makes the perception of the multiplicity of forms possible. The \"Mahāyāna-abhidharmasutra\" tells us that the beginningless \"dhātu\" (locus) is the equal support (\"āśraya\") of all phenomena (\"dharma\") and rests in the body as seeds. According to the Yogacaras, \"ātmabhāva\" and \"āśraya\" basically mean – \"body\", and who also tell us that \"āśraya-paravritti\" can be of the mind or path or errant tendencies.\n\n\"Āśarya yoga\", a special kind of planetary placement with most planets resting in moveable or fixed or common signs (\"rāsis\"), is one of the thirty-two varieties of \"Nabhasa yogas\" in which regard Varahamihira tells us –\n"}

Today they are found in all countries with Chassidic populations, including the United States, performing their shtick at weddings.\n\nThe \"badchen\" was considered a standard part of the wedding party, as \"de rigueur\" as the officiating rabbi. An elaborate traditional wedding might also involve a \"letz\" (lit. a clown, here a \"jongleur\" or musician) and a \"marshalik\" (a master of ceremonies).\n\nThe \"badchen\" has to be able both to provide the energy for a party before and after the ceremony itself and also to make the transition to a more serious tone immediately before the ceremony. To this end his comedy was not of a slapstick variety but rather verbal with many intricate Talmudic references and in-jokes.\n\nFollowing the Council of Vilna on July 3, 1661, a decree was issued banning merry-making, including the setting of limitations on wedding celebrations, public drinking, fire dances, masquerades, and Jewish comic entertainers. The \"badchen\" was exempted from the decree.\n\nSome famous \"badchonim\" include Chaim Menachem (Mendel) Mermelstein (born March 2, 1920 in Munkacz, died November 7, 1985 in New York), considered the father of modern-day \"badchonus\", and the present-day performers Yankel Miller and Yoel Lebowits.\n\nThe 19th-century Broder singers began as \"badchonim\", but soon started to perform outside of the context of weddings. They, in turn, are usually seen as the forerunners of Yiddish theater.\n\nOn the Jewish holiday of Purim many young men undertake to be \"badchonim\" during Purim spiels.\n\n"}

The first pioneer to Spanish Guinea was Elise Lynelle (then Elise Schreiber) who arrived in Bata, Spanish Guinea (as it was called then), on 17 May 1954, and was recognized as a Knight of Baha'u'llah. In 1968 the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Equatorial Guinea was elected in Santa Isabel, (later renamed Malabo). The community has elected a National Spiritual Assembly since 1984. The community celebrated its golden jubilee in 2004. The Association of Religion Data Archives estimated some 3,500 Bahá'ís in 2005.\n\n`Abdu'l-Bahá wrote a series of letters, or tablets, to the followers of the religion in the United States in 1916–1917; these letters were compiled together in the book \"Tablets of the Divine Plan\". The eighth and twelfth of the tablets mentionedAfrica and were written on 19 April 1916 and 15 February 1917, respectively. Publication however was delayed in the United States until 1919—after the end of the First World War and the Spanish flu. The tablets were translated and presented by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab on 4 April 1919, and published in Star of the West magazine on 12 December 1919. `Abdu'l-Bahá mentions Bahá'ís traveling \"...especially from America to Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia, and travel through Japan and China. Likewise, from Germany teachers and believers may travel to the continents of America, Africa, Japan and China; in brief, they may travel through all the continents and islands of the globe\" and \" ...the anthem of the oneness of the world of humanity may confer a new life upon all the children of men, and the tabernacle of universal peace be pitched on the apex of America; thus Europe and Africa may become vivified with the breaths of the Holy Spirit, this world may become another world, the body politic may attain to a new exhilaration...\"\n\nAfter the initiation of the Ten Year Crusade, initiated by Shoghi Effendi, head of the religion after the death of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, coordinated efforts to expand the religion across Africa. The first pioneer to Spanish Guinea was Elise Lynelle (then Elise Schreiber) who arrived in Bata, Spanish Guinea (as it was called then), on 17 May 1954, and was recognized as a Knight of Baha'u'llah. Because of legal segregation she was unable to meet black Africans. Instead she was able to introduce the teachings of the religion, to a Spaniard, Jose Ramos Espinosa, who accepted the religion. With his assistance she was able to stay in the country longer and in June she sailed to the island of Corisco as part of her new job. Here she met the elderly King of the island, Santiago Uganda Mdelo and his nephew, Edward Robinson, both of whom readily accepted the religion. King Uganda told Lynelle that he had had a premonition about someone who would come to him with a message.\n\nThe Bahá'í Community in Equatorial Guinea came under the responsibility of the regional National Spiritual Assembly of North West Africa in 1956. In 1964 the constituent Bahá'í communities were reorganized as the regional assembly of the Bahá'ís of West Central Africa, with its seat in Victoria, comprising the Bahá'ís in the countries and places of Cameroon, Spanish Guinea, St. Thomas Island, Fernando Po Island, Corisco Island, Nigeria, Niger, Dahomey, Togo, and Ghana. Then in 1967 the National Spiritual Assembly of Cameroon Republic was elected with its seat in Victoria and oversaw the neighboring regions of Spanish Guinea, Fernando Po, Corisco, and São Tomé and Príncipe Islands. This was during a period of wide scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa near the end of the period of Colonisation of Africa. Pioneers continued to arrive like Joseph Enonguene and Johanna Ngompex, who came from the Bahá'í community in Cameroon in the 1960s.\n\nIn 1967 in Santa Isabel (later renamed Malabo), pioneer Hassey Ime lived and helped a community in Fernando Poo island (later renamedBioko) and reported an estimated community of at least twenty there. In 1968 the first Local Spiritual Assembly of Equatorial Guinea was elected there. American pioneers Mr. and Mrs. George Karch were also members of the community. In June 1969 a local pioneer, Hans Ayukangu, moved to Biapa on Fernando Poo island where there was a group of four Bahá'ís.\n\nFormation of the National Spiritual Assembly of Equatorial Guinea 18 July 1973. However, between 1972 and 1979 civil society in the country was under duress and religion was repressed (especially progressively from 1975 to 1979). The national assembly was dissolved in 1975-6 by government action.\n\nThe first citizen on Annabon a tiny island of Equatorial Guinea, joined the religion in early 1982. Jose Maria Fierro Cueto (also known as Dr. Pepe), came from Mexico to Equatorial Guinea in the 1980s to assist the Baha'i community. Following a change in government the national assembly was reformed in 1984. That same year it was invited to participate as an observer at the first \"International Hispanic Congress of Culture\" in Bata sponsored by UNESCO. The Bahá'í community also contributed a statement on topics of the congress like of the role of women in society and the importance of education and unity. The congress was designed to define a cultural aim for Equatorial Guinea and to help make that country better known around the world. Joseph Sheppherd was a pioneer to Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, whose circumstances were woven into a book he later wrote which presents the Bahá'í Faith in a context of global change (see Bahá'í Faith in fiction) and delves into the dynamics of pioneering as a method to gain understanding of spiritual issues compared to social issues, to struggle with a cultural naivete. He served for two years as anthropological adviser to the government and curator of the National Ethnological and Archaeological Museum in Malabo.\n\nSince its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern. That involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics even then. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. The modern Bahá'í community of Equatorial Guinea has multiplied its interests internally and externally along these lines. It sponsored a functional literacy course for women in Malabo and Bata starting in November 1996. Working with the Ministry of Women and Social Affairs, the community used Bahá'í Centers in Malabo, Baney, Luba, and Bata for the courses, which taught literacy as well as reproductive health, nutrition, and basic mathematics.\n\nIn 2004 the community celebrates its golden jubilee celebrations. The national television channel, Radio Television Malabo, covered the event. A monthly magazine, \"La Gazzetta\", later published an article about the celebrations.\n\nBahá'í citizens of Equatorial Guinea were among those to gather in Yaounde, Cameroon, in a conference called for by the Universal House of Justice in 2008.\n\nIn 2001 Operation World estimated 0.38%, or 1,720 people were Bahá'ís—and growing at an annual rate of +4.2%. In 2004 there were four local assemblies in Equatorial Guinea. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying mostly on the World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated nearly 3,552, or 0.5% of the national population, Bahá'ís in 2005.\n\n\n"}

Bromo-DragonFLY is considered a potent hallucinogen, having around one third the potency of LSD with a normal dose in the region of 200 μg to 800 μg, and it has an extremely long duration of action, up to several days. Bromo-DragonFLY has a stereocenter and (\"R\")-(−)-bromo-DragonFLY is the more active stereoisomer.\n\nBromo-DragonFLY was first synthesized by Matthew Parker in the laboratory of David E. Nichols in 1998. As with the earlier and less potent dihydrofuran series of compounds nicknamed \"FLY\", Bromo-DragonFLY was named after its superficial structural resemblance to a dragonfly.\n\nThe hallucinogenic effect of bromo-DragonFLY is mediated by its agonist activity at the 5-HT serotonin receptor. Bromo-DragonFLY also has a high binding affinity for the 5-HT and 5-HT serotonin receptors, and is most accurately described as a non-subtype selective 5-HT agonist, as it is actually twice as potent an agonist for 5-HT receptors as for 5-HT, as well as being less than 5x selective for 5-HT over 5-HT. Bromo-DragonFLY is also a MAOI-A inhibitor, and thus strongly inhibits oxidative deamination of 5-HT, increasing its risk profile.\n\nThe typical dose of Bromo-DragonFLY is not known, however it has varied from 500 μg to 1 mg. It has about 300 times the potency of mescaline, or 1/3 the potency of LSD. It has been sold in the form of blotters, similar to the distribution method of LSD, which has led to confusion, and reports of mistakenly consuming Bromo-DragonFly. It has a much longer duration of action than LSD and can last for up to 2–3 days following a single large dose, with a slow onset of action that can take up to 6 hours before the effects are felt.\n\nThe toxicity of Bromo-DragonFLY appears to be fairly high for humans when taken in doses significantly above the therapeutic range, with reports of at least five deaths believed to have resulted from Bromo-DragonFLY reported in Norway, Sweden,\nDenmark,\nFinland\nand the United States.\nLaboratory testing has confirmed that in October 2009, a batch of Bromo-Dragonfly was distributed, mislabeled as the related compound 2C-B-FLY, which is around 20x less potent than BDF by weight. This mistake is believed to have contributed to several lethal overdoses and additional hospitalizations. The batch implicated in these deaths also contained significant synthesis impurities, which may have contributed to the toxicity.\n\nVasoconstrictive action resulting from severe overdose of Bromo-DragonFLY is known to have caused tissue necrosis of the extremities in at least one case. In September 2007, a 35-year-old Swedish male required amputation of the front part of his feet and several fingers on one hand after taking a massive (but unknown) overdose; reportedly, the compound acted as a long-acting efficacious vasoconstrictor, leading to necrosis and gangrene which became apparent several weeks after the overdose occurred. Treatment was of limited efficacy in this case, although tolazoline is reportedly an effective treatment where available.\n\nOverdose-associated disturbing experiences and health problems have been described. One case in 2008 in England involved inhalation of vomit, causing nearly fatal asphyxia. Seizures have also been reported.\n\nOn October 3, 2009, a 22-year-old male from Copenhagen died after ingesting Bromo-dragonfly. His friend described the trip saying, \"It was like being dragged to hell and back again. Many times. It is the most evil [thing] I've ever tried. It lasted an eternity.\" \n\nOn May 7, 2011, in the United States, two young adults died after overdosing on Bromo-DragonFLY, which they thought was 2C-E, and several others were hospitalized during the same incident. Because they took a dosage appropriate for 2C-E, those who took the drug received, in some cases, 100x the normal dose. Both deaths followed seizures, vomiting blood, and terrifying hallucinations. Several surviving victims are reportedly still suffering from its physical effects.\n\nBromo-DragonFLY is listed as a Schedule I in Oklahoma.\n\nSchedule III as of Oct 12 2016. \"2C-phenethylamines and their salts, derivatives, isomers and salts of derivatives and isomers that correspond\" to a broad definition that includes anything with a 2,5-dimethoxyphenylethamine core. This includes most 2C-s, DOx, TMA, Aleph, NBOMes, NBOHs, NBF, bk-2-C-B, 2C-B-Fly, Bromo-DragonFLY, etc. See http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2016/2016-05-04/html/sor-dors73-eng.php.\n\nBromo-DragonFLY is widely reported by the media as being a class A drug. However, as of 2014, it remains unclear to what extent it is covered by the UK phenylethylamine catch-all clause, with commentators noting both the structural similarities and differences to the phenylethylamine class. If the prosecution could demonstrate structural similarity in court, it would be considered a Class A substance but as a benzodifuran it is significantly different to this class. It is not explicitly named in the misuse of drugs act. It would be covered by the UK Psychoactive Substances Act 2016.\n\n\"Sveriges riksdag\" added Bromo-Dragonfly to schedule IV (\"substances, plant materials and fungi with medical use\") as narcotics in Sweden as of Jan 3, 2008, published by \"Medical Products Agency\" in their regulation LVFS 2007:14 listed as Bromo-Dragonfly, brombensodifuranyl-isopropylamin. Bromo-DragonFLY was first classified as \"health hazard\" by \"Sveriges riksdags\" health ministry under the act (translated \"Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health\") as of Jul 15, 2007, in their regulation SFS 2007:600 listed as brombensodifuranylisopropylamin (Bromo-Dragonfly), making it illegal to sell or possess.\n\nOn December 3, 2007 the drug was banned in Denmark. The substance has been declared illegal by health minister Jakob Axel Nielsen, following recommendations from the Danish Health Ministry. It is currently classified as a dangerous narcotic and therefore its possession, manufacture, importation, supply or usage is strictly prohibited. Anyone involved in such activities can face legal action.\n\nBromo-DragonFLY is currently on the Norwegian narcotics list. Thus it is effectively a narcotic drug by Norwegian law.\n\nCurrently, Bromo-DragonFLY is an uncontrolled substance in Poland.\n\nThe chemical compound has been added as an illegal substance under the Law 143/2000 on February 10, 2010.<ref name=\"titleModified Romanian law 143/2000 on January 10, 2010.\"></ref>\n\nAs of 9 September 2011, Bromo-DragonFLY was added to Schedule 2 of the Queensland Drugs Misuse Regulation 1987.\n\nNationally, the drug is listed under Schedule 9 (Prohibited) of the Poisons Standard.

First published in the 1970s and then inactive during most of the 1990s, the magazine has become notorious for its xenophobic and anti-Semitic editorial line.\n\nThe first issue of \"Cabildo\" was published on 17 May 1973, eight days before the democratically elected president Héctor Cámpora took office after several years of military dictatorship. In this stage the magazine consistently demanded the return to military rule through a new coup d'état. Not long afterwards, President Cámpora resigned, leaving the way open for Juan Perón to return to the country from exile and be elected president. After Perón's death, the government of his wife and vice-president Isabel Perón ordered \"Cabildo\" to be closed down on three occasions.\nThe magazine returned after the military coup of 1976 that started the National Reorganization Process, and became almost regularly a monthly publication. The June 1977 issue, however, was retired from circulation by the government, and the July issue was cancelled, because \"Cabildo\" had covered the kidnapping of journalist Jacobo Timerman, which the dictatorship wanted to pass as a legal detention.\n\nThe magazine was notoriously anti-Semitic and supported the idea of a global Zionist conspiracy and blamed Jews in Argentina for the violence of left-wing guerrilla insurgents, employing common stereotypes of Jews and well-known conspiracy theories to accuse Jews of funding Marxist organizations.\n\n\"Cabildo\" continued being published after the return to democratic rule in 1983. Among its frequent collaborators was General Ramón Camps, former head of the Buenos Aires Provincial Police and guilty of multiple crimes (including 32 murders), for which he was eventually amnestied.\n\nSince 1989, the critical economic situation of Argentina caused the magazine to be released irregularly. In 1991 it was discontinued, but it was restarted in 1998 with part of the original staff and some new collaborators.\n\"Cabildo\" continues being published. Its editorial line focuses on current topics, such as the reproductive health policies of President Néstor Kirchner, and his sometimes tense relations with the Argentine Catholic Church. It supports ultra-conservative (pre-Vatican II) Catholic teachings, and criticizes the human rights stance of the government with regard to the crimes committed by the armed forces during the Dirty War. The magazine also advertises courses and seminaries with a fascist ideological orientation, usually held on Catholic Church facilities. A review of a 2005 issue in the leftist newspaper \"Página/12\" claimed that \"Cabildo\" \"works like the repressed unconscious that says what the Catholic right thinks.\"\n"}

He taught, guided, and inspired thousands of disciples throughout his lifetime, by word and deed, with legendary diligence and intensity in Torah study.\n\nShmuelevitz was born on the second day of Rosh Hashana 5663 (3 October 1902) in Kovno, Lithuania, to Rabbi Refoel Alter Shmuelevitz and Ettel (née Horowitz), a daughter of Rabbi Yosef Yozel Horwitz, known as the Alter of Novhardok. The sandek at his bris milah was Rabbi Yitzchok Blazer (\"Reb Itzele Peterburger\"), a Torah and mussar luminary of the time, who was one of Rabbi Yisrael Salanter's greatest disciples.\n\nIn Chaim Leib's youth, his family moved to Stutchin. Until the age of 16, he was educated by his father, who was one of the leading yeshiva lecturers in Lithuania. In 1919 Rabbi Refoel Alter, who was then the rosh yeshiva of \"Shaarei Torah\" in Grodno, died suddenly. Within a very short time, his mother died too, orphaning Chaim Leib, his younger brother Shlomo, and two sisters.\n\nRabbi Refoel Alter's position at the yeshiva was taken up by Rabbi Shimon Shkop. Chaim Leib developed a close bond with Rabbi Shkop. At the age of 18, Chaim Leib's mentor invited him to deliver the third-level shiur in the preparatory academy at the yeshiva. Shmuelevitz held this position for a few years before transferring to the yeshiva in Mir. Many of his students of those years later became great Torah leaders, and his own four years in Grodno with Rabbi Shkop had a profound influence on his approach to Talmudic analysis.\n\nAt the age of 22, Shmuelevitz headed a group of students who transferred from Grodno to Mir. In accordance with the contemporary practice in the yeshiva world, Chaim Leib became known as Chaim Stutchiner, after the shtetl in which he grew up. The Mirrer rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Eliezer Yehuda Finkel, set his sights on Shmuelevitz as his eventual spiritual heir. He set the seal on this future appointment by offering his student the hand of his daughter in marriage.\n\nShmuelevitz married Chana Miriam, the rosh yeshiva's daughter, on the last day of Hanukkah, 3 Tevet 5690 (3 January 1930). A scant few years later, at the relatively young age of 31, Shmuelevitz was appointed as a maggid shiur, delivering regular lectures. Rabbi Shmuelevitz's lectures were modeled on the study strategy of his erstwhile mentor, Rabbi Shimon Shkop, personalized in a style of his own. The hallmark of his lectures was depth combined with a fabulous breadth; it was not uncommon for him to cite 20 or 30 different sources from far-flung corners of the Talmud and its commentaries during a single shiur. These shiurim attracted a wide audience, including some of the most advanced students in Mir.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Mir Yeshiva was forced into exile. The students and faculty fled from Mir to Vilna, where they stayed for about two months, after which they moved to Keidan, where they managed to set up the yeshiva once more in 1940. After being ordered out of Keidan seven months later by the Communist authorities, the yeshiva divided into four groups, each numbering between eighty and one hundred students. Rabbi Shmuelevitz's shiurim continued virtually without interruption throughout the early period of World War II, while when the yeshiva was continually in transit. In late 1940, hundreds of Mir yeshiva students obtained visas from Chiune Sugihara to travel via Siberia and Vladivostok to Japan.\n\nThe yeshiva stayed in Kobe, Japan, for about six months, and then relocated to Shanghai for the next five years. Although living conditions were extremely difficult, the yeshiva prospered. As Rabbi Eliezer Yehuda Finkel had gone to Palestine to obtain visas for the yeshiva and was forced to remain there, Rabbi Shmuelevitz and the mashgiach, Rabbi Yechezkel Levenstein, assumed responsibility for the day-to-day running of the yeshiva.\n\nSomehow, Rabbi Shmuelevitz became responsible for the financial needs of all Jewish learning institutions in the city, not just his own. These included contingents of the famed yeshivas of Kamenetz, Kletzk, Lubavitch, and Lublin. This was despite the fact that exchanging foreign currency in Shanghai was fraught with danger and Rabbi Shmuelevitz lived with a perpetual fear of being apprehended by the authorities.\n\nA short while after arriving in Shanghai, Rabbi Shmuelevitz received American visas only for himself and his family. He refused them, saying that he would leave only when all the students had received their visas. This ultimately meant staying in Shanghai for five and a half years.\n\nThese and other details were part of the 1966 testimony given by Rav Chaim Shmulevitz and his wife to Yad VaShem.\n\nIn 1947 the yeshiva moved again — as always, as a single unit — this time, to the United States, where Rabbi Shmuelevitz spent six months before rejoining his father-in-law, Rabbi Eliezer Yehudah Finkel, in the Mirrer Yeshiva in Jerusalem. For the next 32 years, until his death in 1978, Rabbi Shmuelevitz remained in Mir-Jerusalem, disseminating his unique wisdom and insight to thousands of disciples.\n\nHe became active in Agudath Israel in Israel, and its \"Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah\" (Council of Torah Sages) on which he served. He also became the father-in-law of Rabbi Nochum Partzovitz, his successor as \"rosh yeshiva\".\n\nRabbi Shmuelevitz was well known for his ability to become totally engrossed in his Torah study for hours at a time. His ethical discourses, many of which have been published in English, are considered classics. They offer novel interpretations and reveal his penetrating insights into human nature.\n\nBesides being regarded as a leading Torah scholar, Shmulevitz was famed for his sterling character and all-encompassing concern for his fellow Jews.\n\nRabbi Shmuelevitz's respect for his father was legendary and he quoted him often in both Torah lectures and mussar discourses. He considered his father's handwritten Torah \"chiddushim\" (new Torah insights) his most valued possessions. During the Six-Day War, when the yeshiva was within range of Jordanian artillery fire, Rabbi Shmuelevitz sent some of the manuscripts to America with his uncle, Rabbi Avraham Yoffen, with specific instructions that he carry them by hand and not put them in his luggage, because, \"\"Dos iz meyn gantze leben\" (This is my whole life).\"\n\nHis youngest son, Rav Meir Shmulevitz, lives in Kiryat Mattersdorf, Jerusalem, and R'Chaim's son Avrohom Shmulevitz is a Rosh mesivta at the Mirrer Yeshiva. Both were born in Israel.\n\nOf their older siblings, Rebbetzin Partzovitz and Rebbetzin Ezrachi, were born in Mir, as was their brother Rav Refoel, Z\"L. Their sister Rebbetzin Weiss was born in Shanghai.\n\nA few days after Sukkot 1978, Rabbi Shmuelevitz was rushed to the hospital and, for the next two months, his life hung by a thread. Even during the weeks of semi-consciousness his lips moved, and from time to time he could be heard mumbling words of Torah. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein said, \"The world rested upon Reb Chaim's shoulders.\" Jews worldwide prayed for his recovery. Two months later on the third of Tevet,\nRabbi Shmuelevitz died at the age of 76. Nearly 100,000 mourners attended his funeral. He is buried on Har HaMenuchot.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Rabbi Shmuelevitz committed to paper his every lecture and public address, leaving behind at his death thousands of handwritten pages, including \"chiddushim\" on every tractate of the Talmud.\n\n\n\n"}

There are three pillars of the religion, of which the key concept is johrei, claimed to be a method of channeling divine light into the body of another for the purposes of healing. The Art of Nature which includes nature farming, and the Art of Beauty which includes practices such as Ikebana, a form of Japanese flower arranging, are the other formal practices. In 1926, Okada claimed to have received a divine revelation that empowered him to be a channel of God's Healing Light (\"johrei\") to purify spiritual realm to remove the spiritual causes of illness, poverty, and strife from the world and inaugurate a new Messianic Age. He went on to teach Johrei to his followers allowing them also to achieve Messianity and spread the teachings across the world. Members are given permission to channel Johrei by wearing an O-Hikari pendant which contains a copy of one of Mokichi Okada's calligraphies. He is often referred to as \"Meishu-Sama\" (enlightened spiritual teacher) by his followers. \n\nOkada's teaching is represented by a number of his works, such as Foundation of Paradise and \"Johrei: Divine Light of Salvation\", which has been edited and translated by the Society of Johrei, an offshoot of COWM. \n\nThe movement currently claims 800,000 followers, including many in Brazil. \"Shinji Shumeikai\" , also known as \"Shumei\", also follows the teachings of Okada and is considered a descendant of the church by CFAR.\n\nAccording to anthropologist of religion Winston Davis, Mahikari groups are comparable to Church of World Messianity and follow basically the same healing ritual.\n\nBrazil has the largest concentration of Japanese and people of Japanese descent outside Japan. According to Hideaki Matsuoka, University of California, Berkeley, in a presentation at the Summer 2000 Asian Studies Conference Japan entitled \"Messianity Makes the Person Useful: Describing Differences in a Japanese Religion in Brazil,\" Japanese new religions have propagated in Brazil since the 1930s and they now have at least a million non-Japanese Brazilian followers. Four major religions ranked by the number of followers are Seicho-no-Ie, Messianity, Mahikari and PL Kyodan.\n\nIn Brazil, Guarapiranga is the sacred place of the Church of World Messianity ().\n\n\n"}

{"id": "92731", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92731", "title": "Disconnection", "text": "Disconnection\n\nDisconnection is the severance of all ties between a Scientologist and a friend, colleague, or family member deemed to be antagonistic towards Scientology. The practice of disconnection is a form of shunning. Among Scientologists, disconnection is viewed as an important method of removing obstacles to one's spiritual growth. In some circumstances, disconnection has ended marriages and separated children from their parents. The Church of Scientology has repeatedly denied that such a policy exists, though as of February 2012 its website acknowledged the practice and described it as a human right. In the United States, the Church has tried to argue in court that disconnection is a constitutionally protected religious practice. However, this argument was rejected because the pressure put on individual Scientologists to disconnect means it is not voluntary.\n\nAntagonists to the Church of Scientology are declared by the Church to be antisocial personalities, Potential Trouble Sources (PTS), or Suppressive Persons (SPs). The Church teaches that association with these people impedes a member's progress along the Bridge to Total Freedom.\n\nIn \"Introduction to Scientology Ethics\", L. Ron Hubbard sets out the doctrine that by being connected to Suppressive Persons, a Scientologist could become a Potential Trouble Source (PTS):\n\nA Scientologist can become PTS by reason of being connected to someone that is antagonistic to Scientology or its tenets. In order to resolve the PTS condition, he either HANDLES the other person's antagonism (as covered in the materials on PTS handling) or, as a last resort when all attempts to handle have failed, he disconnects from the person. He is simply exercising his right to communicate or not to communicate with a particular person.\n\nHubbard defined \"handling\" as an action to lessen a situation towards an antagonistic individual by means of communication, and \"disconnection\" as a decision to cut communication with another individual. Hubbard also wrote that Scientology Ethics Officers should recommend handling rather than disconnection when the antagonistic individual is a close relative. He also stated that failure, or refusal, to disconnect from a Suppressive Person is a Suppressive Act by itself. In one case cited by the UK Government, a six-year-old girl was declared Suppressive for failing to disconnect from her mother. Sociologist Roy Wallis reports that Scientologists connected to a suppressive would usually be required to handle \"or\" disconnect, although he found some \"Ethics Orders\" which ordered unconditional disconnection.\n\nAccording to Church statements, disconnection is used as a \"last resort,\" only to be employed if the people antagonistic to Scientology do not cease their antagonism — even after being provided with \"true data\" about Scientology, since it is taught that usually only people with false data are antagonistic to the Church.\n\nOriginally, disconnection involved not only ending communication with someone but also declaring it publicly. The Scientology publication \"The Auditor\" included notices of disconnection from named individuals. It was also common for Scientologists to send short letters to the suppressive person, to warn them that they were disconnected. Roy Wallis interviewed a number of people who had been declared suppressive, some of whom had received hundreds of these letters. The Scientologist was also required to take \"any required civil action such as disavowal, separation or divorce\" to cut off contact with the suppressive.\n\nThe policy was introduced in 1965 in a policy letter written by Hubbard. The \"Code of Reform\" introduced by Hubbard in 1968 discontinued Fair Game and Security Checks, and cancelled \"disconnection as a relief to those suffering from familial suppression.\" In reality, these practices were never discontinued; however, the words \"Fair Game,\" \"Disconnection,\" and \"Security Checking\" were discontinued, as the use of these words caused bad public relations. When the New Zealand Government set up a Commission of Inquiry into Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard wrote to them saying that disconnection had been cancelled and that there was no intention to bring it back. The Commission welcomed the letter, but noted Hubbard did not promise never to re-introduce the practice of disconnection.\n\nIn his book \"A Piece of Blue Sky\", Jon Atack cites an internal document dated August 1982 that, he alleges, re-introduced the disconnection policy. A belief that disconnection was being used again, and not as a last resort, led a group of British Scientologists to resign from the Church in 1984, while keeping their allegiance to the beliefs of Scientology. Their interpretation was that the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard \"encourage the unity of the family\" and therefore that the disconnection policy was \"a misrepresentation or misapplication\".\n\nIn 1966, UK newspaper the \"Daily Mail\" quoted a disconnection letter from Scientologist Karen Henslow to her mother:\nDear Mother, I am hereby disconnecting from you because you are suppressive to me. You evaluate for me, invalidate me, interrupt me and remove all my gains. And you are destroying me.\n\nI [unreadable] from this time consider myself disconnected from you and I do not want to see you or hear from you again. From now you don't exist in my life.\nHenslow, a thirty-year-old sufferer from manic depression, had been a Scientology staff member for two weeks when she disconnected. The message was accompanied by a second letter apologising for the first and saying that it had been mailed without her permission.\n\nRaymond Buckingham, a singer who ran a voice school in Manhattan, was recruited into Scientology by one of his pupils. He was asked to disconnect from a business associate who had been labelled suppressive. When he spoke out publicly against Scientology, his Scientologist pupils disconnected from him and refused to pay him. One of these was a famous singer for whom he had arranged a series of performances.\n\nRoy Wallis reproduced a \"Disconnection Order\" from 1965 which orders a Scientologist to disconnect from the publications of the Food and Drug Administration. It states, \"The FDA literature he comes in contact with is not to be read by him at all.\"\n\nDisconnection was the subject of a 1970 court case in which the Church of Scientology unsuccessfully attempted to sue Geoffrey Johnson-Smith MP over negative comments he had made on BBC television. To defend his claims that families were being alienated, he produced evidence of specific cases in court. The judge described it as \"astonishing\" that the Scientologists did not contest these allegations.\n\nIn 1969, the New Zealand government set up an official inquiry into the Church of Scientology. The ensuing Dumbleton-Powles Report quoted from a number of disconnection letters and also reproduced some \"Ethics Orders\" which identified Suppressive Persons who were \"not to be communicated with in any way.\" Teenage Scientologist Erin O'Donnell had written to her non-Scientologist aunt, \"If you try to ring me I will not answer, I will not read any mail you send, and I refuse to have anything to do with you in any way whatsoever. All communication is cut completely.\" The Commission concluded that Scientologists had been required to choose between family relationships and continued involvement in Scientology.\n\nThe 1971 UK government investigation into Scientology and ensuing \"Foster Report\" reproduced a number of internal \"Ethics Orders\". One of these, dating from November 1967, concerns a member who had asked for a refund. It declares him to be a Suppressive Person and continues, \"Any and all persons connected [to him] are declared Potential Trouble Sources and are not to be Trained or Processed before they have presented evidence in writing (...) of handling or disconnecting.\"\n\nJoe Boyd, the manager of the Incredible String Band, was a Scientologist for a time in the early 1970s. He left when he was told that friends who were hostile to Scientology were interfering with his progress and he must disassociate from them.\n\nCyril Vosper received a \"Declaration of Enemy\" in response to his violations of Scientology \"ethics\". It is reproduced in his book \"The Mind Benders\" and states, \"Anyone connected to him is not to be processed or trained until he or she has disconnected from him in writing.\"\n\nIn 1982, David Mayo and other former Church of Scientology executives were subjected to an internal \"Committee of Evidence\" for alleged transgressions. The committee issued a permanent writ of Disconnection, forbidding all other Scientologists from having contact with the accused.\n\nIn \"A Piece of Blue Sky\", Jon Atack describes being ordered to disconnect from a friend in 1983, shortly after the policy was re-introduced.\n\nIn his 1984 High Court judgment, which considered many aspects of Scientology, English judge Justice Latey wrote that \"many examples [of disconnection] have been given and proved in evidence.\" As examples, he reproduced two disconnection letters. One is written by a Scientologist to his fiancée. In the other, a man writes to his business partner and former friend, \"What you are now doing in setting yourself against the Church is not only very suppressive but also non-survival for you, your family and any group you are associated with.\"\n\nThat year, the \"Daily Mail\" brought up further examples of disconnection, including a 13-year-old boy who disconnected from his father and a woman who said her fiancé was forced to abandon her. The fiancé concerned said \"it was a personal decision\" and a Church of Scientology spokesman was quoted denying that there is a policy to split up relationships.\n\nAlso in 1984, \"The Mail on Sunday\" interviewed Gulliver Smithers, a former Scientologist who had left the group's base at Saint Hill Manor when he was 14 years old. Smithers explained that disconnection was an everyday part of life in Saint Hill, \"It goes round by word of mouth when someone is an outcast. He or she is just ignored and shunned. It was what we were brought up to do.\"\n\nIn a lengthy court case in the 1980s, ex-member Lawrence Wollersheim successfully argued that he had been coerced into disconnecting from his wife, parents, and other family members. Since the disconnection was not voluntary, it did not count as protected religious practice.\n\nIn 1995, the UK local paper \"Kent Today\" talked to Pauline Day, whose Scientologist daughter Helen had sent a disconnection letter and then dropped all contact, even changing her phone number. A spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology denied that this decision had anything to do with the Church.\n\nA \"Buffalo News\" investigation in 2005 spoke to the sisters and brother of Fred Lennox, a Scientologist who, according to them, was being manipulated and exploited financially by the group. The paper also quoted an internal so-called \"Ethics Order\" instructing him to \"handle or disconnect\" from his sister Tanya because of anti-Scientology comments she had made online. Lennox himself and Church of Scientology spokesmen denied this.\n\nEx-Scientologist Tory Christman told \"Rolling Stone\" magazine that her Scientologist husband and friends refused to talk to her after she left the Church.\n\nIn January 2008, Jenna Miscavige Hill, niece of David Miscavige, spoke out about the policy's effect on her family. She revealed that, once her parents left the Church while she remained, she had been forbidden to answer the telephone in case she spoke to them and that her parents only restored occasional access to her by threatening legal action. Another second-generation Scientologist, Astra Woodcraft, told ABC's \"Nightline\" that she had been forbidden any contact with her father once he left the Church and she was still a member. She used her weekly laundry time to secretly meet up with him.\n\nTo make the television documentary \"Scientology and Me\", the BBC \"Panorama\" team spoke to two mothers whose daughters had disconnected, one for nearly seven years. Mike Henderson, an ex-Scientologist, told \"Panorama\" how he had not spoken to his father during his time as a member. When Henderson left Scientology, he re-established communication with his father, but most of the rest of the family disconnected from Henderson as a result.\n\nActor Jason Beghe has alleged that after he left the Church of Scientology in 2008, former friends who remained in the Church disconnected from him.\n\nIn 2009, a man named Shane Clark was about to be declared a suppressive person for being employed by Marc Headley, author of \"\". Clark secretly recorded a meeting between himself and Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis and his wife Jessica Feshbach. In the tape, Davis is heard not only threatening Clark with suppressive person declaration, but telling him he will be the subject of disconnection. Clark was later declared, and his family disconnected from him. Despite the direct evidence to the contrary, Davis denied the existence of the disconnection policy in a television interview on CNN. Paul Haggis, a film director, disputed this in his 2009 resignation letter from Scientology. Haggis wrote, \"We all know this policy exists\", and said his wife had been ordered to disconnect from her ex-Scientologist parents, \"although it caused her terrible personal pain. For a year-and-a-half, [she] didn't speak to her parents and they had limited access to their grandchild. It was a terrible time.\" In response, Davis reiterated that there is no Church policy of disconnection.\n\nWhen actress Leah Remini publicly left the Church in 2013, Remini's sister, Nicole, revealed that she and the rest of Remini's family did as well to avoid being split up by the Church's disconnection policy.\n\nThe \"St. Petersburg Times\" consulted three religious scholars about disconnection in Scientology, two of whom had been recommended by the organization itself. One, F. K. Flinn of Washington University in St. Louis, said that shunning practices such as disconnection are common to young religions. He drew parallels with the dis-fellowship practiced by Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\nThis view is not shared by all religious scholars. J. Gordon Melton, of the Institute for the Study of American Religion, said that disconnection goes much further than the policies of most modern religions. Newton Maloney of Fuller Theological Seminary also described the policy as \"too extreme.\" The \"Buffalo News\" report consulted Stephen A. Kent of the University of Alberta, who said that hostility towards critics, including the member's own family, is an ingrained part of Scientology Ethics, according to which the survival of the Church is all-important.\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs, who briefly dabbled with Scientology, wrote extensively about it during the late 1960s, weaving some of its jargon into his fictional works, as well as authoring nonfiction essays about it. He uses the term \"Disconnect\" in a Scientological context in \"\" and other works. In the end, however, he abandoned Scientology and publicly criticized it in an editorial for the \"Los Angeles Free Press\" in 1970.\n\n\n"}

It is the third film based on Harry Segall's stageplay \"Heaven Can Wait\", preceded by \"Here Comes Mr. Jordan\" (1941) and \"Heaven Can Wait\" (1978). The film stars Chris Rock as Lance Barton, a comedian who is killed before his time on Earth is through. He is given another chance to continue his life, but in the body of a rich middle-aged white man.\n\nThe film was released on February 16, 2001, received generally negative reviews from critics and grossed $71 million against its $49 million budget.\n\nLance Barton (Chris Rock) is a struggling comedian who is quite funny and confident in his personality, but is unable to bring his talent across in front of an audience. After being booed off stage one night he hears about an opportunity from his manager, Whitney Daniels (Frankie Faison), at the Apollo Theater, which is having a goodbye show due to its imminent closing. He is hoping to get a chance to prove himself in front of a real audience, when on his way home riding a bike Lance is distracted by Sontee Jenkins (Regina King). Not paying attention, he is hit by a semi truck and is instantly killed. Because of this, Lance is brought up to Heaven where he meets the angels, King (Chazz Palminteri) and Keyes (Eugene Levy) who reveal that Lance has died before his time, and can help Lance return to Earth.\n\nLance and King then start searching for a body. After sorting through many, they find Charles Wellington III, (Brian Rhodes) an extremely rich businessman freshly drowned in his tub by his wife (Jennifer Coolidge) and assistant, Winston Sklar (Greg Germann). Lance wants nothing to do with the body until he discovers that Sontee, the woman he saw when he was Lance, is protesting Charles by handcuffing herself to a coffee table in his penthouse, demanding Charles' presence. Lance sees this as a chance to get to know her, but he is reluctant to permanently be Charles. Accordingly, he makes a deal with King to loan Charles' body until a more suitable body is found. Soon after, Charles returns from death, but with the witty soul of Lance Barton inside him. Only he and the angels can see him as Lance. Everybody else sees him as the middle-aged, rich, white Charles.\n\nVery unpopular in the past, the public and those closest to Charles start to notice a change in his personality. He transforms from a snobbish billionaire into a philanthropist. Despite recent events he continues to follow his comedy dreams through Charles, contacting his old manager Whitney and convincing him that he is Lance reincarnated. Through many \"humorous\" moments and issues, he gets Sontee to fall in love with him.\n\nAll too soon, Charles' wife and Sklar's plans to murder him succeed as he is shot and killed by a hired assassin. Fulfilling the deal Lance and King set up earlier, King and Keyes then send Lance to return yet again to Earth as Joe Guy, a great comedian and more acceptable candidate who will die in a car accident. Joe returns from this accident unscathed, now with Lance's soul. After pulling off a successful performance at the Apollo and reconnecting with Whitney, King and Keyes re-emerge. They inform him that after their current conversation, he will not remember them, Lance, Charles or Sontee. As said, after the angels leave he no longer remembers the previous events or his previous lives. Even though he has lost his memory of Lance, he still has the characteristics of him. As a result, he reconnects with Whitney again and proceeds in getting Sontee to fall in love with him all over again, after meeting her in the theater for the first time as Joe Guy.\n\n\n\"Down to Earth\" received negative reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 20% based on reviews from 96 critics, with the consensus: \"A toned down Chris Rock fails to bring a limp script to life as the movie moves from one gag to the next.\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 34 based on 28 reviews, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".\n\nThe film grossed $64,186,502 in the United States, plus $7,000,000 outside the USA, for a combined gross of $71,186,502.\n\nA soundtrack containing hip hop and R&B music was released on February 20, 2001 by Sony Music Entertainment.

This neologism was coined in 1979 by a group of ethnobotanists and scholars of mythology. Some authors claim entheogens have been used by shamans throughout history, with appearances in prehistoric cave art such as a cave painting at Tassili n'Ajjer, Algeria that dates to roughly 8000 BP. In 1977, José Luís Díaz noted an emerging scholarly discourse in ethnopharmacology that represented a scholarly basis for investigating these practices\n\nMaya entheogen use remains an enigma, mostly because there is little evidence available from the archaeological record. There is also little evidence from the epigraphic record and Andrew McDonald and Brian Stross note that Maya script referring to these substances may prove especially difficult to decipher At present, most of the evidence comes from ancient Maya art and rare examples of residues of substances recovered from ceramic containers.\n\nTobacco (\"Nicotiana\" spp.) contains the alkaloid nicotine, which affects the nervous system. The Maya used tobacco extensively for recreation and rituals alike. Varieties of tobacco used by the Maya differed from tobacco that used in modern cigarettes and other related products The Maya smoked the leaves to scare away snakes and spirits. Besides smoking the dried leaves, the Maya also consumed their tobacco by making tea out of it and ingesting the liquid.\n\nPsilocybe mexicana, known to the Aztecs as \"teonanacatl\" (agglutination of \"teo\" - god and \"nanacatl\" - mushroom, literally divine mushroom), is a psychedelic mushroom that has been used in Mesoamerican cultures for over 2000 years. The fungus contains two separate entheogenic compounds, psilocybin and psilocin that cause the user to experience visual hallucinations. Often cited archaeological evidence for Maya use of \"Psilocybe mexicana\" is the existence of \"mushroom stones,\" carved stone objects from highland Guatemala that have been interpreted as representations of mushrooms, some of which have anthropomorphic figures on the base or stem. (These should not be confused with the naturally occurring geological formations also known as mushroom stones.) These objects have been found at many archaeological sites and have been interpreted as being symbolic of the ritualistic use of the plant in Maya culture. However, there is a lack of consensus on interpretations of these as evidence for ritual use of \"Psilocybe\" by the Maya.\n\nNymphaea ampla, a white-flowered water lily, is another possible entheogen of significance for the Maya. Many scholars compare \"Nymphaea ampla\" to the blue lotus (\"Nymphaea caerulea\") that was used extensively by ancient Egyptians. The water lily is widely represented in Maya art, especially in its depictions with jaguars and Maya kings. The cultural importance can somewhat be seen in the Mayan naming of the plant, \"nikte’ha’\" (Mayan for \"vulva of the water\") as it would have represented life, sexual activity, fertility, birth, etc. The plant causes opiate-like effects on the user and is known to have been used as a calming sedative and mild trance inducer.\n\nKnown to the Aztecs as \"ololiuqui\", varieties of morning glory including \"Turbina corymbosa\" and \"Ipomoea tricolor\", are also thought to have been used by the Maya under the name \"xtabentún\" (thought by some to be the origin of Xtabentún liqueur). Their seeds contain ergine, or d-lysergic acid amide, which is related to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). When consumed, it is reported to give powerful hallucinogenic visions, even when only consuming small doses.\n\nSalvia divinorum is a psychoactive plant native to Mexico that is also known to have hallucinogenic effects.

He moved into the financial world at the age of 23 and by around 1908 he had already enrolled as an agent of an independent stock exchange, thus beginning a promising career.\n\nDuring the Mexican Revolution, he left the country and went to the United States, where he lived for two years, returning to Mexico in 1913. In 1920, he married Maria Antonieta de la Macorra but became a widower a few years later, having had no children. He became a Mexican citizen on 29 December 1933.\n\nFrom the 1950s, Franz Mayer had conceived the idea of donating his collection of fine and decorative arts to Mexico. Finally in 1963 he set up a trust fund, and the Bank of Mexico was chosen as the fiduciary for the establishment of an art museum in Mexico City. At the same time a sponsor was found among the people closest to him. According to the wishes of Franz Mayer, the contract established that the trusteeship would create a library, organize exhibitions, competitions and conferences.\n\nFranz Mayer died in 1975 and donated his collection to the state and people of Mexico.

Gad is also mentioned by the Book of Isaiah (Isaiah 65:11 - some translations simply call him (the god of) Fortune), as having been worshipped by a number of Hebrews during the babylonian captivity. Gad apparently differed from the god of destiny, who was known as Meni. The root verb in \"Gad\" means \"cut\" or \"divide\", and from this comes the idea of fate being \"meted out\".\n\nIt is possible that the son of Jacob named \"Gad\" is named after Gad, although the text presents a different reason, the (ketub) quotation of Zilpa (Gad's mother) giving the reason of Gad's name could be understood that way.\n\nHow widespread the cult of Gad, the deity, was in Canaanite times may be inferred from the names \"Baalgad\", a city at the foot of Mount Hermon, and \"Migdal-gad\", in the territory of Judah. Compare also the proper names \"Gaddi\" and \"Gaddiel\" in the tribes of Manasseh and Zebulun (Numbers 13:10, 11). At the same time it must not be supposed that Gad was always regarded as an independent deity. The name was doubtless originally an appellative, meaning \"the power that allots\". Hence any of the greater gods supposed to favour men might be thought of as the giver of good fortune and be worshiped under that title; it is possible that Jupiter, the planet, may have been the \"Gad\" thus honoured - among the Arabs the planet Jupiter was called \"the greater Fortune\" (Venus was styled \"the lesser Fortune\").\n\nGad is the patron of a locality, a mountain (Kodashim, tractate Hullin 40a), of an idol (Genesis Rabbah, lxiv), a house, or the world (Genesis Rabbah, lxxi.). Hence \"luck\" may also be bad (Ecclesiastes Rabbah, vii. 26). A couch or bed for this god of fortune is referred to in the Mishnaic tractate Nedarim 56a).\n\n"}
{"id": "1991315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1991315", "title": "Harem", "text": "Harem\n\nHarem ( \"ḥarīm\", \"a sacred inviolable place; harem; female members of the family\"), also known as zenana in South Asia, properly refers to domestic spaces that are reserved for the women of the house in a Muslim family and are inaccessible to adult males except for close relations. This private space has been traditionally understood as serving the purposes of maintaining the modesty, privilege, and protection of women. A harem may house a man's wife—or wives and concubines, as in royal harems of the past—their pre-pubescent male children, unmarried daughters, female domestic workers, and other unmarried female relatives. In former times, some harems were guarded by eunuchs (castrated men) who were allowed inside. Similar institutions have been common in other Mediterranean and Middle Eastern civilizations, especially among royal and upper-class families and the term is sometimes used in non-Islamic contexts. The structure of the harem and the extent of monogamy or polygamy has varied depending on the family's personalities, socio-economic status, and local customs. \n\nAlthough the institution has experienced a sharp decline in the modern era, seclusion of women is still practiced in some parts of the world, such as rural Afghanistan and conservative states of the Gulf region. \n\nIn the West, Orientalist imaginary conceptions of the harem as a fantasy world of forbidden sexuality where numerous women lounged in suggestive poses have influenced many paintings, stage productions, films and literary works. Several European Renaissance paintings dating to the 16th century defy Orientalist tropes and portray the women of the Ottoman harem as individuals of status and political significance. In many periods of Islamic history women in the harem exercised various degrees of political power.\n\nThe word has been recorded in the English language since early 17th century. It comes from the Arabic \"ḥarīm\", which can mean \"a sacred inviolable place\", \"harem\" or \"female members of the family\". In English the term harem can mean also \"the wives (or concubines) of a polygamous man.\" The triliteral \"Ḥ-R-M\" appears in other terms related the notion of interdiction such as \"haram\" (forbidden), \"mahram\" (unmarriageable relative), \"ihram\" (a pilgrim's state of ritual consecration during the Hajj) and \"al-Ḥaram al-Šarīf\" (\"the noble sanctuary\", which can refer to the Temple Mount or the sanctuary of Mecca).\n\nIn Turkish of the Ottoman era, the harem, i.e., the part of the house reserved for women was called \"haremlık\", while the space open for men was known as \"selamlık\".\n\nSome scholars have used the term to refer to polygynous royal households throughout history. In Muscovite Russia the area of aristocratic houses where women were secluded was known as \"terem\".\n\nThe idea of harem or seclusion of women did not originate with Muhammad or Islam. These practices were well established amongst the upper classes of Iraq, the Byzantine Empire, Ancient Greece and Persia for thousands of years before the advent of Islam.\n\nThe practice of secluding women was common to many ancient near eastern communities, especially where polygamy was permitted. In pre-Islamic Assyria, Persia, and Egypt, most royal courts had a harem, where the ruler’s wives and concubines lived with female attendants, and eunuchs. South Asian traditions of female seclusion, called \"purdah\", may have been influenced by Islamic customs, but the practice of segregation by gender predates the Islamic invasions of India. The practice of female seclusion is not exclusive to Islam, but the English word harem denotes the domestic space reserved for women in Muslim households.\n\nThe harem system first became fully institutionalized in the Islamic world under the Abbasid caliphate. Some scholars believe that Islamic culture adopted the custom of secluding women from the Byzantine Empire and Persia, and then read those customs back into the Quran. According to Eleanor Doumato, the practice of secluding women in Islam is based on both religious tradition and social custom.\n\nAlthough the term \"harem\" does not denote women's quarters in the Quran, some scholars point out that a number of Quranic verses discussing modesty and seclusion were held up by Quranic commentators as religious rationale for the separation of women from men. One verse in particular discusses \"hijab\". In modern usage \"hijab\" colloquially refers to the religious attire worn by Muslim women, but its original meaning was a \"veil\" or \"curtain\" that physically separates female from male space. Although classical commentators agreed that these verses referred specifically to Muhammad's wives, they usually viewed them as providing a model for all Muslim women.\n\nMoulay Ismail, Alaouite sultan of Morocco from 1672 to 1727, had over 500 concubines. He is said to have fathered a total of 525 sons and 342 daughters by 1703 and achieved a 700th son in 1721.\n\nThe practice of female seclusion witnessed a sharp decline in the early 20th century as a result of education and increased economic opportunity for women, but it is still practiced in some parts of the world, such as rural Afghanistan and conservative states of the Persian Gulf region.\n\nLeila Ahmed describes the ideal of seclusion as a \"a man's right to keep his women concealed—invisible to other men.\" Ahmed identifies the practice of seclusion as a social ideal and one of the four factors that shaped the lives of women in the Mediterranean Middle East. For example, contemporary sources from the Byzantine Empire describe the social mores that governed women's lives. Women were not supposed to be seen in public. They were guarded by eunuchs and could only leave the home \"veiled and suitably chaperoned.\" Some of these customs were borrowed from the Persians, but Greek society also influenced the development of patriarchal tradition.\n\nThe ideal of seclusion was not fully realized as social reality. One reason for this is because working class women often held jobs that required interaction with men. Women participated in economic life as midwives, doctors, bath attendants and artisans. At times they lent and invested money and engaged in other commercial activities.\n\nEventually, the norms of female seclusion spread beyond the elites, but the practice remained characteristic of upper and middle classes, for whom the financial ability to allow one's wife to remain at home was a mark of high status. In some regions, such as the Arabian peninsula, seclusion of women was practiced by poor families at the cost of great hardship, but it was generally economically unrealistic for the lower classes.\n\nHistorical records shows that the women of 14th-century Mamluk Cairo freely visited public events alongside men, despite objections of religious scholars.\n\nThe institution of the harem was widespread in the ancient Near East.\n\nIn Assyria, rules of harem etiquette were stipulated by royal edicts. The women of the harem lived in seclusion, guarded by eunuchs, and the entire harem traveled together with the king. A number of regulations were designed to prevent disputes among the women from developing into political intrigues.\n\nThere is no evidence of harem practices among early Iranians, but Iranian dynasties adopted them after their conquests in the region. According to Greek sources, the nobility of the Medes kept no less than five wives who were watched over by eunuchs.\n\nGreek historians report that Persian notables of the Achaemenid empire as well as the king himself had several wives and a larger number of concubines. The Old Persian word for the harem is not attested, but it can be reconstructed as \"xšapā.stāna\" (lit. night station or place where one spends the night). The chief consort, who was usually the mother of the heir to the throne, was in charge of the household. She had her own living quarters, revenues, and a large staff. Three other groups of women lives in separate quarters: the other legal wives, royal princesses, and concubines.\n\nThe Achaemenid harem served as a model for later Iranian empires, and the institution remained almost unchanged. Little is known about the harems of the Parthians, but the information about the Sasanian harem reveals a picture that closely mirrors Achaemenid customs. A peculiar characteristic of the Sasanian royalty and aristocracy, which was attested in later times under the Safavid and Qajar empires, was that the highest female rank was not necessarily given to the chief wife, but could be held by a daughter or a sister.\nOf all the Persian kings, Khosrow II was the most extravagant in his hedonism. He searched his realm to find the most beautiful girls, and it was rumored that about 3,000 of them were kept in his harem. This practice was widely condemned and it was counted as one of the crimes for which he was later tried and executed. Khosrow himself claimed that he sent his favorite wife Shirin every year to offer them a possibility of leaving his harem with a dowry for marriage, but that their luxurious lifestyle always prompted them to refuse his offer.\n\nEunuchs were probably introduced into Islam through the influence of Persian and Byzantine imperial courts. The Ottomans employed eunuchs as guardians of the harem. Istanbul's Topkapı Palace housed several hundred eunuchs in the late-sixteenth century. The head eunuch who guarded the entrance of the harem was known as \"kızlar ağası.\" Eunuchs were either Nilotic slaves captured in the Nile vicinity and transported through ports in Upper Egypt, the Sudan and Abyssinia, or European slaves such as Slavs and Franks.\n\nAccording to Encyclopedia of Islam, castration was prohibited in Islamic law \"by a sort of tacit consensus\" and eunuchs were acquired from Christian and Jewish traders. Al-Muqaddasi identifies a town in Spain where the operation was performed by Jews and the survivors were then sent overseas. Encyclopedia Judaica states that Talmudic law counts castration among mutilations entitling a slave to immediate release, so that the ability of Jewish slave traders to supply eunuchs to harems depended on whether they could acquire castrated males.\n\nEuropean artists and writers envisioned and presented the Oriental harem in a romanticized, albeit historically inaccurate manner. The dark eunuch was held as the embodiment of the sensual tyranny that held sway in the fantasized Ottoman palace, for he had been \"clipped\" or \"completely sheared\" to make of him the \"ultimate slave\" for the supreme ruler. In the Ottoman court, white eunuchs, who were mostly brought from castration centers in Christian Europe and Circassia, were responsible for much of the palace administration, while black eunuchs, who had undergone a more radical form of castration, were the only male slaves employed in the royal harem.\n\nThe chief black eunuch, or the Kizlar Agha, came to acquire a great deal of power within the Ottoman Empire. He not only managed every aspect of the Harem women's lives but was also responsible for the education and social etiquette of the princes and young women in the Harem. He arranged for all ceremonial events within the Harem including weddings and circumcision parties, and even notified women of death sentences when \"accused of crimes or implicated in intrigues of jealousy and corruption.\"\n\nNineteenth-century travelers accounts tell of being served by black eunuch slaves. The trade was suppressed in the Ottoman Empire beginning in the mid-19th century, and slavery was legally abolished in 1887 or 1888. Late 19th-century slaves in Palestine included enslaved Africans and the sold daughters of poor Palestinian peasants. Both Arabs and Jews owned slaves. Circassians and Abazins from North of the Black Sea may have also be involved in the Ottoman slave trade.\n\nThe Imperial Harem of the Ottoman sultan, which was also called \"seraglio\" in the West, was part of Topkapı Palace. It also housed the Valide Sultan, as well as the sultan's daughters and other female relatives. Eunuchs and servant girls were also part of the harem. During the later periods, the sons of the sultan lived in the Harem until they were 12 years old.\n\nSome women of Ottoman harem, especially wives, mothers and sisters of sultans, played very important political roles in Ottoman history, and in times it was said that the empire was ruled from harem. Hürrem Sultan (wife of Suleiman the Magnificent, mother of Selim II), was one of the most powerful women in Ottoman history.\n\nIt is being more commonly acknowledged today that the purpose of harems during the Ottoman Empire was for the royal upbringing of the future wives of noble and royal men. These women would be educated so that they were able to appear in public as a royal wife.\n\nSultan Ibrahim the Mad, Ottoman ruler from 1640 to 1648, is said to have drowned 280 concubines of his harem in the Bosphorus. At least one of his concubines, Turhan Hatice, a Rus' girl (from the area around modern Ukraine) who came into the Ottoman empire as a slave sold by Nogai slavers, survived his reign.\n\nIn Istanbul, the separation of men's and women's quarters was never practiced among the poor, and by 1920s and 1930s it had become a thing of the past in middle and upper-class homes.\n\nThe king's wives, concubines, dancing girls and slaves were not the only women of the Mughal harem. Many others, including the king's mother lived in the harem. Aunts, grandmothers, sisters, daughters and other female relatives of the king all lived in the harem. Male children also lived in the harem until they grew up. Within the precincts of the harem were markets, bazaars, laundries, kitchens, playgrounds, schools and baths. The harem had a hierarchy, its chief authorities being the wives and female relatives of the emperor and below them were the concubines.\n\nThe royal harem played an important role in the history of Safavid Persia. In the early Safavid period, young princes were placed in the care of a \"lala\" (high-ranking Qizilbash chief who acted as a guardian) and eventually given charge of important governorates. Although this system had the danger of encouraging regional rebellions against the shah, it gave the princes education and training which prepared them for dynastic succession. This policy was changed by Shah Abbas I (1571-1629), who \"largely banished\" the princes to the harem, where their social interactions were limited to the ladies of the harem and eunuchs. This deprived them of administrative and military training as well as experience of dealing with the aristocracy of the realm, which, together with the princes' indulgent upbringing, made them not only unprepared to carry out royal responsibilities, but often also uninterested in doing so. The confinement of royal princes to the harem was an important factor contributing to the decline of the Safavid dynasty.\n\nThe administration of the royal harem constituted an independent branch of the court, staffed mainly by eunuchs. These were initially black eunuchs, but white eunuchs from Georgia also began to be employed from the time of Abbas I. The mothers of rival princes together with eunuchs engaged in palace intrigues in an attempt to place their candidate on the throne. From the middle of the sixteenth century, rivalries between Georgian and Circassian women in the royal harem gave rise to dynastic struggles of an ethnic nature previously unknown at the court. When Shah Abbas II died in 1666, palace eunuchs engineered the succession of Suleiman I and effectively seized control of the state. Suleiman set up a privy council, which included the most important eunuchs, in the harem, thereby depriving traditional state institutions of their functions. The eunuchs' influence over military and civil affairs was checked only by their internal rivalries and the religious movement led by Muhammad Baqir Majlisi. The royal harem reached such proportions under Sultan Husayn (1668–1726) that it consumed a large part of state revenues. After the fall of the Safavid dynasty, which occurred soon afterwards, eunuchs were never again able to achieve significant political influence as a class in Persia.\n\nAshoka, the great emperor of the Mauryan Dynasty in India, kept a harem of around 500 women. Once when a few of the women insulted him, he had all of them burnt to death.\n\nIn Mexico, Aztec ruler Montezuma II, who met Cortes, kept 4,000 concubines; every member of the Aztec nobility was supposed to have had as many consorts as he could afford.\n\n\"Harem\" is also the usual English translation of the Chinese language term \"hougong\" (\"hou-kung\"; ). \"Hougong\" refers to the large palaces for the Chinese emperor's consorts, concubines, female attendants and eunuchs. The women who lived in an emperor's \"hougong\" sometimes numbered in the thousands. In 1421, Yongle Emperor ordered 2,800 concubines, servant girls and eunuchs who guarded them to a slow slicing death as the Emperor tried to suppress a sex scandal which threatened to humiliate him.\n\nThe institution of the harem exerted a certain fascination on the European imagination, especially during the Age of Romanticism, and was a central trope of Orientalism in the arts, due in part to the writings of the adventurer Richard Francis Burton. Images through paintings and later films were particularly powerful ways of expressing these tropes.\n\nA centuries-old theme in Western culture is the depiction of European women forcibly taken into Oriental harems—evident for example in the Mozart opera \"Die Entführung aus dem Serail\" (\"The Abduction from the Seraglio\") concerning the attempt of the hero Belmonte to rescue his beloved Konstanze from the \"seraglio\"/harem of the Pasha Selim; or in Voltaire's \"Candide\", in chapter 12 of which the old woman relates her experiences of being sold into harems across the Ottoman Empire.\n\nMuch of Verdi's opera \"Il corsaro\" takes place in the harem of the Pasha Seid—where Gulnara, the Pasha's favorite, chafes at life in the harem, and longs for freedom and true love. Eventually she falls in love with the dashing invading corsair Corrado, kills the Pasha and escapes with the corsair—only to discover that he loves another woman.\n\n\"The Lustful Turk\", a well-known British erotic novel, was also based on the theme of Western women forced into sexual slavery in the harem of the Dey of Algiers, while in \"A Night in a Moorish Harem\", a Western man is invited into a harem and engages in forbidden sex with nine concubines. In both works, the theme of \"West vs. Orient\" is clearly interwoven with the sexual themes.\n\nThe Sheik novel and the Sheik film, a Hollywood production from 1921, are both controversial and probably the best known works created by exploiting the motif. Much criticism ensued over decades, especially recently, on various strong and unambiguous Orientalist and colonialist elements, and in particularly directed at ideas closely related to the central rape plot in which for women, sexual submission is a necessary and natural condition, and that interracial love between an Englishwoman and Arab, a \"native\", is avoided, while the rape is ultimately justified by having the rapist turn out to be European rather than Arab.\n\nMany Western artists have depicted their imaginary conceptions of the harem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The song comes from the Gershwins' opera \"Porgy and Bess\" (1935) where it is sung by the character Sportin' Life, a drug dealer, who expresses his doubt about several statements in the Bible. The song's melody also functions as a theme for Sportin' Life's character. This song came under direct critique from composer Hall Johnson for depicting African Americans as unfaithful.\n\nThe first and most direct example of influence occurs at the start of the song; the melody and phrasing is nearly identical to the blessing incanted before reading from the Torah. The words \"It ain't necessarily so\" stand in place of \"Bar'chu et adonai ham'vorach\". This motif repeats multiple times in both, and both include a response from a congregation. While the phrasing of the melody in the blessing varies, it remains strictly in triplets in Gerwshin's tune. The song also seems to draw from the tonality of the Jewish prayer mode Adonai malakh (God is King) by emphasizing the minor tenth, the major third, and the minor seventh.\n\nThe role of Sportin' Life was created by John W. Bubbles. Other notable incarnations of the character include Cab Calloway on stage and Sammy Davis Jr. in the 1959 film.\n\nEarly charted versions were by Leo Reisman (1935) and by Bing Crosby (1936). The song was notably sung by Bobby Darin on his 1959 album \"That's All.\"\n\nIn 1960, Aretha Franklin recorded a cover on her debut studio album, \"Aretha (with the Ray Bryant Combo) for\" columbia records.\n\nThis song was also covered by a plethora of jazz musicians throughout the fifties and sixties. In 1952, Oscar Peterson covered it on his album \"Oscar Peterson Plays George Gershwin\". He also covered it as a duet in 1976 with Joe Pass on their album \"Porgy and Bess\". The Cal Tjader Modern Mambo Orchestra recored it in 1956 for Fantasy Records. In 1955, Ahmad Jamal released a cover on his album \"Ahmad Jamal Plays\". Peggy Lee released a cover of it on her album \"Black Coffee\" in 1955. Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald covered it their duet album \"Porgy and Bess\" in 1968. Lena Horne covered it in 1959 on her duet album with Harry Belafonte, \"Porgy and Bess\". In 1959, Sammy Davis Jr. also released a studio version of the song on his album with Carmen McRae, \"Porgy and Bess\". In 1960, Art Farmer and Benny Golson covered the song on their album \"Meet the Jazztet\". Jazz organist Freddie Roach covered the tune in his 1963 album \"Good Move\". On her 1963 album \"Black Christ of the Andes\", Mary Lou Williams made a cover of the song.\n\nIt was covered a number of times during the Rock era. The Honeycombs released a cover of it on their debut album, \"The Honeycombs\" in 1964. The next year, the song was a major Australian hit in 1965 for singer Normie Rowe, reaching number 5 on the Australian singles charts. Also in 1965 The Moody Blues covered the song for their album, \"The Magnificent Moodies\". The Moody Blues' version is notable for the fact that it was their first recording with band member Ray Thomas singing the lead vocals.\n\nIn 1984, the song was released as a single by UK band Bronski Beat with Jimmy Somerville on lead vocals. The song was taken from Bronski Beat's debut album, \"The Age of Consent\" and reached number 16 on the UK singles charts.\n\nOther versions include Cher in 1994, Jamie Cullum in 2002, Sting, Brian Wilson on his 2010 \"Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin\" album and Hugh Laurie on his 2011 album \"Let Them Talk\".

{"id": "1858132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1858132", "title": "Japanese new religions", "text": "Japanese new religions\n\nJapanese new religions are new religious movements established in Japan. In Japanese they are called or . Japanese scholars classify all religious organizations founded since the middle of the 19th century as \"new religions\"; thus, the term refers to a great diversity and number of organizations. Most came into being in the mid-to-late twentieth century and are influenced by much older traditional religions including Shinto, Buddhism, and Hinduism. Western influences include Christianity, the Bible and the writings of Nostradamus.\n\nIn the 1860s Japan began to experience great social turmoil and rapid modernization. As social conflicts emerged in this last decade of the Edo period, known as the Bakumatsu period, some new religious movements appeared. Among them were Tenrikyo, Kurozumikyo and Oomoto, sometimes called \"Nihon Sandai Shinkōshūkyō\" (\"Japan's three large new religions\"), which were directly influenced by Shinto (the state religion) and shamanism.\n\nThe social tension continued to grow during the Meiji period, affecting religious practices and institutions. Conversion from traditional faith was no longer legally forbidden, officials lifted the 250-year ban on Christianity, and missionaries of established Christian churches reentered Japan. The traditional syncreticism between Shinto and Buddhism ended and Shinto became the national religion. Losing the protection of the Japanese government which Buddhism had enjoyed for centuries, Buddhist monks faced radical difficulties in sustaining their institutions, but their activities also became less restrained by governmental policies and restrictions.\n\nThe Japanese government was very suspicious towards these religious movements and periodically made attempts to suppress them. Government suppression was especially severe during the early 20th century, particularly from the 1930s until the early 1940s, when the growth of Japanese nationalism and State Shinto were closely linked. Under the Meiji regime \"lèse majesté\" prohibited insults against the Emperor and his Imperial House, and also against some major Shinto shrines which were believed to be tied strongly to the Emperor. The government strengthened its control over religious institutions that were considered to undermine State Shinto or nationalism, arresting some members and leaders of Shinshukyo, including Onisaburo Deguchi of Oomoto and Tsunesaburō Makiguchi of Soka Kyoiku Gakkai (now Soka Gakkai), who typically were charged with violation of \"lèse majesté\" and the Peace Preservation Law.\n\nAfter Japan lost World War II, its government and policy changed radically during occupation by Allied troops. The official status of State Shinto was abolished, and Shinto shrines became religious organizations, losing government protection and financial support. Although the Occupation Army (GHQ) practiced censorship of all types of organizations, specific suppression of Shinshūkyō ended.\n\nGHQ invited many Christian missionaries from the United States to Japan, through Douglas MacArthur's famous call for 1,000 missionaries. Missionaries arrived not only from traditional churches, but also from some modern denominations, such as Jehovah's Witnesses. The Jehovah's Witnesses missionaries were so successful that they have become the second largest Christian denomination in Japan, with over 210,000 members (the largest is Catholicism with about 500,000 members). In Japan, Jehovah's Witnesses tend to be considered a Christianity-based Shinshūkyō, not only because they were founded in the 19th century (as were other major Shinshūkyō), but also because of their missionary practices, which involve door-to-door visiting and frequent meetings.\n\nDespite the influx of Christian missionaries, the majority of Shinshūkyō are Buddhist- or Shinto-related sects. Major sects include Risshō Kōsei Kai and Shinnyo-en. Major goals of Shinshūkyō include spiritual healing, individual prosperity, and social harmony. Many also hold a belief in Apocalypticism, that is in the imminent end of the world or at least its radical transformation. Most of those who joined Shinshūkyō in this period were women from lower-middle-class backgrounds.\n\nSoka Gakkai has a particular influence to politics since 1964, thanks to their affiliated party Komeito, later New Komeito. In 1999, it was estimated that 10 to 20 per cent of the Japanese population were members of a Shinshūkyō.\n\nAfter World War II, the structure of the state was changed radically. Prior to WWII, the National Diet was restricted and the real power lay with the executive branch, in which the prime minister was appointed by the emperor. Under the new Constitution of Japan, the Diet had the supreme authority for decision making in state affairs and all its members were elected by the people. Especially in the House of Councillors, one third of whose members were elected through nationwide vote, nationwide organizations found they could influence national policy by supporting certain candidates. Major Shinshūkyō became one of the so-called \"vote-gathering machines\" in Japan, especially for the conservative parties which merged into the Liberal Democratic Party in 1955.\n\nIn the 1950s, Japanese wives of American servicemen introduced the Soka Gakkai to the United States, which in the 1970s developed into the Soka Gakkai International (SGI). The SGI has steadily gained members while avoiding much of the controversy encountered by some other new religious movements in the US. Well-known American SGI converts include musician Herbie Hancock and singer Tina Turner.\n\nIn Brazil Shinshūkyō, like Honmon Butsuryū-shū, were first introduced in the 1920s among the Japanese immigrant population. In the 1950s and 1960s some started to become popular among the non-Japanese population as well. Seicho-no-Ie now has the largest membership in the country. In the 1960s it adopted Portuguese, rather than Japanese, as its language of instruction and communication. It also began to advertise itself as philosophy rather than religion in order to avoid conflict with the Roman Catholic Church and other socially conservative elements in society. By 1988 it had more than 2.4 million members in Brazil, 85% of them not of Japanese ethnicity.\n\nData for 2012 is from the Agency for Cultural Affairs.\n\n\n"}

He was a research assistant in Heidelberg and assistant professor in Bern, where he qualified as a university lecturer in 1991 with his habilitation thesis on 4th century Greek ecclesiology (Basil of Caesarea). Also during this time he held guest professorships and teaching positions in Switzerland and in Asia (foremost in Sri Lanka, 1982/3).\n\nFrom 1993 to 2013, succeeding Georg Kretschmar, he held the Chair of Church history at the University of Munich. He developed it – in addition to the treatment of classical patristic themes – into the only Chair of Church history at a Faculty of Protestant Theology in German-speaking central Europe that has specialized in the history of non-western and global Christianity. Its many projects have aimed at developing an ecumenically oriented church history that pays proper attention not only to the denominational, but also to the geographical and cultural-contextual plurality of World Christianity.\n\nKoschorke was dean of the Faculty for Protestant Theology at the University Munich from 2003-2005. Regular research stays and lecture trips led him to Asia, Africa and Latin America. He inaugurated and developed the Munich-Freising-Conferences as an international platform for interdisciplinary exchange between scholars from various fields of professional expertise and regional or denominational background and as an instrument for the further development of the new historical subdiscipline \"History of World Christianity\". Koschorke has been appointed guest professor at Liverpool Hope University (UK) in 2010 and at the University of Basel (Switzerland) and has been serving as visiting professor in Sri Lanka (since 1982), India (Madurai), China (Shanghai, Beijing), Japan (Tokyo, Kyoto), Korea (Seoul), Myanmar (Mandalay) Singapore, Pakistan (Lahore), South Africa (Pretoria), Uganda and delivered repeatedly lectures in Brazil and in the United States. Current research projects are focused on the broad spectrum of (both Western and Non-Western) \"Christian Internationalisms around 1910\".\n\nThe scholarly approach to the History of World Christianity developed by Koschorke and some of his colleagues in Munich has recently been labeled as the \"Munich School of World Christianity\". It can be characterized by its focus on three guiding principles: (1) the need for new and enlarged maps of the history of World Christianity that enable a comparative study of the different denominational, regional, and cultural expressions of Christianity; (2) an awareness of \"polycentric structures\" in the history of World Christianity - not only in the most recent period but from its very beginnings; and (3) a focus on transregional links between Christian groups and movements in different regions and continents and the resulting concept of a global history of Christianity as a history of multidirectional transcontinental interactions, including early instances of South–South connections.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Pagan Federation is a constituted voluntary organisation, registered as a private Company limited by guarantee, with exemption for use of `limited' with Companies House on 22 August 2000, with its nature listed as a Religious Organisation. The memorandum of the association lists the objects of the Pagan Federation as providing services for Pagans in the UK and abroad, providing information about Paganism to the public and all interested bodies, educating the public about Pagan beliefs and traditions, providing access to Pagan celebrations, and providing pastoral care for Pagans in the community including those in hospitals and prisons.\n\nThe Pagan Federation publishes a quarterly magazine, \"Pagan Dawn\", that features articles, reviews, and research on both modern and historic Paganism.\n\nThe Pagan Federation believes that `Paganism is the ancestral religion of the whole of humanity', according to Cole Morton who was awarded the`Pagan Federation National Journalist of the Year' in 2010. \nPagan Federation states that for someone to be Pagan, they need only believe in the following:\n\nThe Aim of the PF translates as the following core activities,\n\n\"According to the Pagan Federation Wessex website the Pagan Federation \"seeks to support all Pagans to ensure they have the same rights as the followers of other beliefs and religions.

For the 2011 Census, The Pagan Federation was asking all Pagans to put aside their reservations and to put 'Pagan' in the box for religion. This is so that a truer value of the number of pagans in the UK could be determined. The ONS reported that 56,620 people identified themselves as Pagan in the 2011 census, the eighth highest for a UK religion.\n\n\n"}

It began and largely remained a mail-order enterprise, recruiting people through advertising in popular magazines and through direct mail solicitations.\n\nThe first advertisement for Psychiana, which Robinson himself penned and took around to local publishers in Spokane, Washington in 1929, featured a picture of Robinson with the headline, \"I TALKED WITH GOD (yes I did, actually and literally).\" Those who expressed an interest in Robinson's promises of health, wealth, and happiness by responding to one of his ads were offered a series of bi-weekly lessons by mail on a subscription plan. Robinson had his own printing presses and started a small publishing company, which offered many of his own books on various spiritual themes, as well as his memoir, \"The Strange Autobiography of Frank B. Robinson\".\n\nThematically, Robinson's ideas, as expressed in Psychiana, grew out of the metaphysical tradition and can be classified under the New Thought umbrella. Robinson adopted concepts such as affirmations, positive thinking, self-help and mental healing into Psychiana's lessons and emphasized health and material prosperity as possible rewards for dedicated and hardworking Psychiana students.\n\nRobinson said that the name he chose, \"Psychiana,\" came to him in a dream. He unabashedly referred to himself as a prophet, and envisioned his movement as becoming a worldwide, revolutionary spiritual force; at the same time, he made little effort to establish any kind of organizational structure beyond his headquarters office in Idaho, preferring to keep the operation strictly on a correspondence level.\n\nPsychiana burgeoned during the Great Depression, but Robinson offended many of his contemporaries, not only by the \"businesslike\" nature of Psychiana, but also with his harsh criticisms of conventional Christianity.\n\nDeportation proceedings were initiated against him in a federal court in Idaho, his opponents claiming that he was a foreign national illegally residing in the United States. During the trial, Robinson contended that although he had been raised in England, he had been born in New York City while his father was visiting the U.S., and was therefore a U.S. citizen. Nonetheless he was ordered to leave the country. Robinson traveled to Cuba, where he stayed briefly while Idaho Senator William Borah intervened on his behalf and helped him to obtain a visa. Robinson was soon back in Idaho and became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1942.\n\nRobinson had a penchant for mink coats and other trappings of wealth, and was accused of taking financial advantage of his followers. Mitch Horowitz devotes a chapter to Robinson in his 2009 book \"Occult America\", writing that by all accounts Robinson was sincere in his devotion to Psychiana and truly believed he was offering useful guidance and advice. Additionally, writes Horowitz, Psychiana was wildly successful, but much of the movement's income went to cover postage costs for mailing thousands of Psychiana pamphlets. Robinson's annual income was estimated at the equivalent of about $130,000 in 2009 dollars—above the average income, but not outrageously so and within the reach of many white collar workers and hardly rising to the level of an opulent lifestyle.\n\nUpon Robinson's death in 1948, his wife, Pearl Robinson, and son, Alfred Robinson, tried to continue the operation of \"Psychiana\". At the end of five years, however, Alfred shut the business down, refusing a buyout offer from St. Louis and giving \"Psychiana\"'s archived materials to the University of Idaho. It is said that Alfred, a Presbyterian, did not agree with his father's theological beliefs.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52014232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52014232", "title": "Reconciliation theology", "text": "Reconciliation theology\n\nReconciliation theology or the theology of reconciliation raises crucial theological questions about how reconciliation can be brought into regions of political conflict. The term differs from the conventional theological understanding of reconciliation, but likewise emphasises themes of justice, truth, forgiveness and repentance.\n\nReconciliation is conventionally understood as a central theological concept: God reconciles himself with humanity through the atonement of Christ and, likewise, the followers of Christ are called to become peacemakers and reconcile with one another. The Greek term for reconciliation \"katallagē\" means to \"exchange enmity, wrath and war with friendship, love and peace.\" A number of theologians have developed this theological concept, such as Irenaeus (115-202), Tertullian (160-220), Augustine of Hippo (324-430), Martin Luther (1483–1546), John Calvin (1509-64), Albrecht Ritschl (1822–89), Karl Barth (1886-1968), Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906–45) and Gustavo Gutiérrez (1928).\n\nHowever, the Christian concept of reconciliation has recently been applied to political conflict zones of the world by John W. de Gruchy, Robert Schreiter and others and called \"reconciliation theology\". De Gruchy demonstrates four interrelated ways of reconciliation:\n\n\nThe understating of reconciliation theology has raised crucial questions about how this concept of reconciliation can be applicable in each context. When it attaches to political discourse and goes uncriticised, it is sometimes seen as being greatly inappropriate and even dangerous. Thus, there is a strong emphasis on the historical and contextual considerations, and a 'reflection on what is happening on the ground' in the actual process of reconciliation.\n\nDe Gruchy notes that the issue of reconciliation needs to include the understanding of \"covenant and creation, sin and guilt, grace and forgiveness, the reign of God's justice and human hope\", all of which could have political significance. Joseph Liechty and Cecelia Clegg present in their study \"Moving Beyond Sectarianism\" that a true understanding of reconciliation has to deal with \"the interlocking dynamics of forgiveness, repentance, truth, and justice.\"\n\nOne of the initial political acts in post-apartheid South Africa was the creation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), in order to establish and facilitate truth and reconciliation while acknowledging crimes committed and human rights violations during the apartheid era (1960–1994). It came as an outcome of negotiations between the contrasting political parties of Nelson Mandela (ANC) and F. W. de Klerk (NP).\n\nAs for its goal, De Gruchy explains, \"TRC did contribute to that goal in becoming a catalyst for the healing of the past and enabling at least some people to experience forgiveness and reconciliation in the present.\"\n\nArchbishop Desmond Tutu, the chairman of the TRC, demonstrates in \"No Future without Forgiveness\" the connection between telling the truth and social justice. The public storytelling for those cruelly silenced for so long, and remembering the cruelties of the past can restore an individual’s human dignity and bring healing for the nation.\n\nOne criticism Joseph Liechty raises against the TRC is that \"it lacked an emphasis on the concepts of justice and repentance\", two out of the four concepts for the true reconciliation – namely, justice, truth, forgiveness and repentance. Therefore, the concepts of truth and atoning tendencies of the TRC downplays the justice element of liberation theology. Individuals with this view, such as the theologians behind the Kairos Document, desire to \"promote truth and justice and life at all costs, even at the cost of creating conflict, disunity and dissension along the way.\"\n\nThe Korean War (1950–53) broke out not long after the Liberation of Korea in 1945 by the USA from the South and USSR from the North. During the war, at least a million Korean were killed, and more than a million were relocated and separated from their families. Since the war, the divided Koreas remain with bitter conflict against one other.\n\nDuring the 1980s the Korean Christian Federation (North Korea) and the National Council of Churches in Korea (South Korea) began to initiate conversations related to the unification of their two governments, often with the assistance of the World Council of Churches. Due to these activities, in the late 1990s, the South Korean approach towards the North changed vividly when president Kim Dae-jung announced the ‘Sunshine Policy’ (). Kim Dae-Jung, a committed Catholic, professes his belief in the saving power of Jesus Christ in his personal life and testifies to his conviction of the ultimate triumph of justice.\n\nThe \"Sunshine Policy\" is the political act of reconciliation of South Korea (ROK) towards North Korea (DRPK), aimed at \"achieving peace on the Korean Peninsula through reconciliation and cooperation\" from 1998 to 2008. Sebastian Kim notes two important dimensions of the policy: \"affirming the partnership of the nations rather than the merging of the North into the South along the lines of German reunification, and insisting that initiatives on the issue be taken by North and South Korea themselves, rather than outside interference.\" This policy brings economic cooperation between the two Koreas as follows and an increase of humanitarian aid and support from the South to the North.\n\nThe first meeting of the two heads of the Koreas in Pyongyang in June 2000 was a breakthrough moment for a long-divided Korea. The \"Sunshine Policy\" contributes to build \"shared identities\" that are very important in the process of reconciliation and creates a \"common cultural memory\". However, it is criticised as pursuing peace without considering the human rights of North Korean citizens. This view brings the point that if the South only focuses on peace on the surface while North Korean citizens are suffering from the dictatorship of the North Korean government, it can be an act of \"condoning their injustice and affirming their enmity.\"\n\nIn Northern Ireland, reconciliation theology emphasises the concepts of truth, justice, forgiveness and repentance. The discourse on reconciliation emerged in Northern Ireland during the 1990s with the beginnings of the peace process after the Troubles. It began with local academics and theologians but was picked up as an idea by politicians, policy-makers and religious leaders, who each understood it in differing ways and emphasised it for different reasons.\n\nA theology of reconciliation is practically applied by Christian reconciliation communities. However, the term reconciliation was also used by politicians who adopted a similar usage to that of the reconciliation communities.\n\n"}
{"id": "7083475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7083475", "title": "Religion in Bulgaria", "text": "Religion in Bulgaria\n\nReligion in Bulgaria has been dominated by Christianity since its adoption as the state religion in 865. The dominant form of the religion is Eastern Orthodox Christianity within the fold of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. During the Ottoman rule of the Balkans, Sunni Islam spread in the territories of Bulgaria, and it remains a significant minority today. The Catholic Church has roots in the country since the Middle Ages, and Protestantism arrived in the 19th century.\n\nIn the latest years, there has been a decline of both the historic religions of Bulgaria—Orthodox Christianity and Islam—, which shrank respectively from 86% in 1992 to 84% in 2001 to 61% in 2011 and from 13% in 1992 to 12% in 2001 to 8% in 2011. In the 2011 census, the question about the religious affiliation became optional, and thus 21.8% of the total population didn't answer. Until the census of 1992, Bulgarians were obliged to declare the historic religious belonging of their parents and/or ancestors, while since 2001 people were allowed to declare personal belief in a religion or unbelief in any religion (irreligion and atheism). After the end of the People's Republic of Bulgaria (1946–1990), the revival of Islam was stronger than Orthodox Christianity. With the international rise of Islamic terrorism in the 2000s, however, there was a growing disaffection for the Islamic religion among Bulgarians. The Bulgarian Orthodox Church has seen the most serious decline from 2001 onwards. The church's credibiliy has been undermined since the 1990s by its collaboration with the erstwhile Communist regime, fully revealed with the opening of the state's secret archives in 2012, according to which eighty percent of the clergy were members of the secret police.\n\nThe Constitution of Bulgaria designates Orthodox Christianity as the \"traditional\" religion of the country, but guarantees the free exercise of any religion. Bulgaria has not experienced any significant ethnic or religious confrontation, unlike the case in former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. The religious communities in the country coexist peacefully. In fact, the capital Sofia is known for its so-called Square of Religious Tolerance; the St Nedelya Church, St Joseph Cathedral, Banya Bashi Mosque and Sofia Synagogue are located within metres of each other in the very centre of the city.\n\nThe results of the Bulgarian census of 2011, in which the indication of answer regarding the question for confession was optional, are as follows:\nThe results of the Bulgarian census of 2001 by ethnic groups, the latest census in which the indication of identification (whether by confession or as irreligious) in the question for confession was obligatory, are as follows:\nBy far the dominant religion in Bulgaria is Eastern Orthodox Christianity, professed by the prevalent ethnic group, the Bulgarians, who are adherents of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. Approximately 60% of the Bulgarians belonged to the church as of 2011. Other Orthodox churches represented in the country by minorities are the Russian Orthodox Church, Ukrainian Orthodox Church, Romanian Orthodox Church and Greek Orthodox Church.\n\nChristianity was established in the First Bulgarian Empire under Boris I in the middle of the 9th century, although it has had its roots in the Balkans since the 1st century and the mission of Apostle Paul. The rise of the Bulgarian Empire made the Bulgarian Orthodox Church autocephalous in 919, becoming the first new Patriarchate to join the initial Pentarchy. The Bulgarian Orthodox Church is the oldest among the Slavic Orthodox churches and has considerably influenced the rest of the Slavic Orthodox world by means of its rich literary and cultural activity in the Middle Ages, as well as by the invention of the Cyrillic script in Bulgaria.\n\nCatholicism has its roots in Bulgaria and the Middle Ages. It was spread among the Bulgarians by Bulgarised Saxon ore miners in northwestern Bulgaria (around Chiprovtsi) and by missionaries among the Paulician and Bogomil sectarians, as well as by Ragusan merchants in the larger cities. The total number of the Catholics in the country accounted for 0.8% of the population in 2011.\n\nToday the bulk of the Catholic population of Bulgaria lives in Plovdiv Province, centred on Rakovski, as well as in some villages in northern Bulgaria. The Banat Bulgarians are a Bulgarian minority in Romania and Serbia adhering to Catholicism. Besides Bulgarians, among the Catholics are also many foreigners.\n\nThe Bulgarian Greek Catholic Church, a Byzantine Rite church united with Rome, was formed in the 19th century as part of the Bulgarian church struggle in order to counter the influence of the Patriarch of Constantinople, and has some 10,000 members today.\n\nProtestantism in its various forms arrived in the 19th century because of missionaries, mainly from the United States. Today it is a quickly growing confession, with membership having tripled from 1992 to 2011. They comprised 0.9% of the total population in 2011. Half of the Protestants in Bulgaria are newly converted Roma, while the other half are for the most part Bulgarians. The Union of Evangelical Congregational Churches in Bulgaria is a fruit of American missionaries in the 19th century. A 2015 study estimated 45,000 Christian believers from a Muslim background in the country, most of them belonging to some form of Protestantism.\n\nThe majority of the Armenians in Bulgaria are members of the Armenian Apostolic Church, which has an eparchy in the country based in Sofia. Most Armenian Apostolics live in Plovdiv, Sofia, Varna or Burgas.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census 21.8% of the Bulgarians did not respond to the question about religion, while a further 9.3% declared a strong stance of irreligion (atheism, agnosticism).\n\nIslam is the second largest religion in Bulgaria, representing about 8% of the population in 2011. It is professed by the Turkish minority, the Muslim Bulgarians (Pomaks) and some of the Roma. The former two are concentrated in the Rhodopes, a massif in southern Bulgaria, but are present in clusters in other parts of the country, for instance the Turks in the Ludogorie region and the Pomaks in the Rhodopes and some villages in northern Bulgaria. Today, Muslims form the majority in Kardzhali Province and Razgrad Province (mostly Turks) and Smolyan Province (mostly Bulgarians).\n\nIslam arrived with the Ottoman Turkish conquest of the Balkans in the 14th-15th century. Turkish notables settled in the larger cities (Plovdiv, Sofia, Varna, etc.), while peasants from Anatolia arrived in the Ludogorie and the Rhodopes. Many Orthodox Christians and Paulicians converted to Islam, often voluntarily due to the peculiarities of the Ottoman \"millet\" system, but sometimes forcefully. After the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878 many of the Muslims left Bulgaria, but others chose to remain.\n\nDespite its low number today, Bulgaria's Jewish population exerted considerable cultural influence on the country in the past and is still of importance today. The Jews in Bulgaria are concentrated in the larger cities, mostly in the capital Sofia.\n\n"}

{"id": "42596019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42596019", "title": "Shizi (book)", "text": "Shizi (book)\n\nThe Shizi is an eclectic Chinese classic written by Shi Jiao 尸佼 (c. 390-330 BCE), and the earliest text from Chinese philosophical school of \"Zajia\" 雜家 \"Syncretism\", which combined ideas from the Hundred Schools of Thought, including Confucianism, Daoism, Mohism, and Legalism. The \"Shizi\" text was written c. 330 BCE in twenty sections, and was well-known from the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) until the Song dynasty (960-1279) when all copies were lost. Scholars during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties reconstructed the \"Shizi\" from quotes in numerous sources, yet only about 15 percent of the original text was recovered and now extant. Western sinology has largely ignored the \"Shizi\" and it was one of the last Chinese classics to be translated into English (Fischer 2012).\n\nLittle is known about Shi Jiao or Shizi \"Master Shi\" except for references to his eponymous text. He was probably from the Warring States period state of Jin (modern Shanxi), and employed by the Legalist statesman Shang Yang (390-338 BCE), the chief minister of Qin (modern Shanxi) for Duke Xiao. When Duke Xiao died in 338 BCE, his successor King Huiwen ordered Shang Yang to be executed by dismemberment and his entire family to be exterminated. Shi Jiao fled to the state of Shu (modern Sichuan), where he wrote the \"Shizi\" in 20 sections totaling over 60,000 Chinese characters, and subsequently died.\n\nThe Chinese surname Shi is commonly written 石 \"stone\", 史 \"history\", 師 \"teacher\", 時 \"time\", or 士 \"scholar\" – but hardly ever written \"shi\" \"corpse; ceremonial 'personator' of a dead person\". Besides Shi Jiao, there are few examples other than Shi Cong 尸聰 and Shi Bo 尸帛, who served Yongle Emperor (r. 1402-1424) (\"Hanyu Da Zidian\" 1984:964). The given name Jiao or Xiao can be pronounced \"jiǎo\" \"handsome; beautiful; excellent\", \"jiāo\" \"associate; have intercourse with\", or \"xiáo\" \"imitate; false\". Although Tang dynasty scholar Sima Zhen first noted the \"jiǎo\" 佼 in Shi Jiao was pronounced like \"jiǎo\" 絞 \"twisted\" (Fischer 2012:3380), some sources (e.g., Makeham 1994:263) misspell his name as \"Shi Xiao\".\n\nThe \"Shizi\" has had a long and dynamic history. The twenty-chapter text was written around 330 BCE, became a famous classic of philosophical Eclecticism, had sections repeatedly lost and recovered from political and military destruction, until only one original chapter existed around 1060 CE, and later scholars partially reconstructed the text from quotes in over seventy Chinese classics. For example, the Syncretist \"Huainanzi\" quotes the \"Shizi\" 27 times (Le Blanc 1985:83). The Chinese Imperial Library catalogs in the standard Twenty-Four Histories inventory the \"Shizi\" text in twenty sections from the Han through Tang dynasties, and then only one section in the Song dynasty.\nThe most complete reconstruction was done in 1812, but even it only recovered about 15 percent of the original text (about 10,000 of 60,000 characters). Technically speaking, Paul Fischer (2012:417) describes the \"Shizi\" text as \"simultaneously lost and extant\".\n\nThe oldest surviving reference to Shizi is found in the (91 BCE) \"Shiji\" \"Scribal Record\" biography of Xunzi (c. 312–230 BCE). \nAnd (in addition to Xun Zi, the state of) Zhao also had Gongsun Long, who made arguments about the similarity and difference of hardness and whiteness, and the sayings of Ju Zi; (the state of) Wei had Li Kui (with his) teaching on fully using the powers of the land; (the state of) Chu had Shizi, Chang Lu, and Yu Zi from A in it. Following from Meng Zi down until Yu Zi, the world has their writings in abundance; therefore (I) will not discuss their biographies. (tr. Fischer 2012:794-797) \n\nThe (8 BCE) \"Bielu\" 別錄 \"Separate Records\" was a detailed bibliography of holdings in the Imperial Library, including the \"Shizi\". It was begun by the imperial librarian Liu Xiang, and after his death, was completed by his son Liu Xin. Although this early library catalog is no longer extant, there are two surviving \"Bielu\" fragments that mention the \"Shizi\". First, Liu Xiang's own \"Sun Qing shulu\" 孫卿書錄 \"Sun Qing Record\" says (tr. Fischer 2012:808-812): \"The state of Chu had Shizi, Chang Lu Zi, and Yu Zi, and all wrote texts, but (these) were not of the model of former kings, and none followed the methods of Kong Zi. Only Meng Zi and Xun Qing were able to respect Kong Zi.\" Second, the \"Shiji\" commentary of Pei Yin 裴駰 (fl. 438) more fully quotes it:\nLiu Xiang’s \"Bie lu\" says: \"(The \"Shi ji\" says :) 'Chu had Shizi ...' (but I) suspect (it should have) said he (lived) in Shu (not Chu). Now, according to the \"Shizi\" text, he was from Jin, (with the) given name Jiao, and was a retainer of Qin chief minister Wei Yang. (When) Wei Yang, the Shang Lord, planned things and designed strategies, and established laws to regulate the people, (he) always devised them with Jiao. (When) the Shang Lord was punished, Jiao feared (that he) also would be killed, and thereupon fled and ran away to Shu. (There he) himself created this text in twenty sections, (with) altogether more than sixty thousand words. (When he) died, (he was) accordingly buried in Shu.\" (tr. Fischer 2012:801-806) \nLiu Xin abridged the \"Bielu\" catalog into the (6 BCE) \"Qilue\" 七略 \"Seven Summaries\", and the historian Ban Gu used both catalogs to compile the \"Yiwenzhi\" “Literature Record” chapter of his (92 CE) \"Hanshu\" \"Han History\". It lists the \"Shizi\" as one of twenty texts in the Syncretist section (tr. Fischer 2012:773-778): \"\"Shizi\" in twenty sections. (His) given name was Jiao, and (he was) from Lu; the Qin chief minister, the Shang Lord, took him as a teacher, (and when Shang) Yang died, Jiao fled to Shu.\"\n\nThese earliest (91 BCE to 92 CE) references generally agree except for Shizi's home state. Was he from Chu (\"Shiji\"), Shu (\"Bielu\" author's suspicion), Jin (\"Bielu\" author's text), or Lu (\"Hanshu\")? Fischer (2012:832-834) concludes he was from Jin, primarily because the testimony of the \"Shizi\" itself, as specifically cited by Liu Xiang\".\n\nThe Tang historian Wei Zheng's (656) \"Suishu\" \"Sui History\" first described \"Shizi\" chapters being lost (tr. Fischer 2012:855-858): \"The \"Shizi\" in twenty sections, table of contents in one section. In the Liang (502–557) there were (only) nineteen sections. Authored by Shi Jiao, chief retainer of Qin chief minister Wei Yang. Nine of its sections were lost, and in the Wei (220–265) “Yellow Beginning” (reign era; 220–227), (it was) continued.\" Wei Zheng says that during the reign of Wei Emperor Cao Pi the nine lost chapters were \"continued\" (\"xu\" 續), which Fischer (2012:897-898) interprets to mean replacing an incomplete \"Shizi\" copy in the imperial collection with a complete copy from a private library.\n\nThe (445) \"Hou Hanshu\" \"Later Han History\" only mentions the \"Shizi\" once in a quotation, but Tang dynasty crown prince Li Xian's (677) \"Hou Hanshu\" commentary is informative.\nShizi was from Jin, had the given name of \"Jiao,\" and was the retainer of Qin chief minister Wei Yang. (When Wei) Yang planned strategies (he) always devised them with Jiao. (When) the Shang Lord was punished, (Shizi) feared (that he) also would be killed, and therefore fled and ran away to Shu, (where he) made a text in twenty sections: nineteen sections elaborate the threads of the Way, virtue, goodness, and propriety, and one section speaks of the nine regions, strategic passes, and the places where river springs originate. (tr. Fischer 2012:906-909) \n\nThe \"Shizi\" text was largely lost sometime between the writing of the 1060 \"New Tang History\" and 1345 \"History of Song\". The (1739) Ming and (1927) Qing dynasty imperial catalogs do not list the \"Shizi\". One private catalog, Chen Kui's (1174) \"Zhongxing Guange shumu\" 中興館閣書目 lists the text with only one section written on two bundles of bamboo strips (\"pian\" 篇) (Fischer 2012:931). Examining Chinese history between 1060 and 1174 when all full copies of the \"Shizi\" text were lost, Fischer (2012:950-951) suggests the Jingkang Incident when the invading Jurchen soldiers of the Jin Dynasty besieged and sacked Kaifeng, the Northern Song dynasty capital.\n\nDuring the Ming and Qing dynasties, Chinese scholars worked on reconstructing the \"Shizi\" text from quotations. The (c. 1691) \"Qianqingtang shumu\" 千頃堂書目 \"Thousand Acre Hall Bibliography\", written by Huang Yuji 黄虞稷, lists a \"Shizi\" in two sections that was reconstructed by Xu Yuantai 徐元太 around 1565 (Fischer 2012:953). Although it was lost, six other \"Shizi\" reconstructions are still extant; Chen Zhengxue (1640), Hui Dong (1730), Ren Zhaolin (1788), Zhang Zongyuan (1796), Sun Xingyan (1806), and Wang Jipei (1812). The version of Wang Jipei 汪繼培 is considered the most authoritative.\n\nThe sources for these reconstructions were based on over seventy texts that quoted the \"Shizi\". Those containing the most quotes are: Ouyang Xun's 604 \"Typological Collections from the Classics and Other Literature\", Yu Shinan's c. 615 \"Copied Writings from the North Hall\", Wei Zheng's 631 \"Essentials of Government from Many Books\", Li Shan's 658 \"Notes on the Anthology of Literature\", and Li Fang's 983 \"Taiping Imperial Reader\". The \"Qun shu zhiyao\" 群書治要 abridgement, comprising over 5,000 characters (out of the original 60,000), quotes 13 of the original 20 chapters, and represents almost half of the reconstructed \"Shizi\" text.\n\nFischer (2012:1159-1163) summarizes the \"Shizi\" as \"both unique and paradigmatic for being the first Syncretist text from a time when eclectic authorship—in both content and form—was the norm. We are fortunate that several Ming and Qing scholars made the effort to reconstruct it, that so much of it was quoted by Wei Zheng in the Tang dynasty, and that Wei’s work was preserved in Japan even while it was lost in China.\"\n\nThe reconstructed \"Shizi\" contains 15 of the original 20 sections or chapters, the first 13 of which primarily derive from Wei Zheng's \"Qun shu zhiyao\". The contents of are shown below, citing the Fischer's (2012) translations.\n\nIn addition to these 15 titled chapters, the reconstructed \"Shizi\" comprises 194 \"yiwen\" 佚文 \"fragments\" from source texts that quote the \"Shizi\" without specifying the chapter. Nineteen of these fragments have doubtful authenticity because they are only attested in sources later than 1127 CE when the text was probably lost.\n\nThe \"Shizi\" includes some humorous teachings, such as this anecdote about the importance of naming.\n(The state of) Qi had a person named Tian Guo who named his dog \"Riches\" and his son \"Happiness.\" (Once) when (he) was about to perform a sacrifice, the dog entered the house. Guo yelled at it saying: \"Riches, get out!\" A shamaness (heard this and) said: \"(That) was not auspicious.\" (Later,) Guo experienced misfortune: (his) eldest son died. Weeping over him, (he) cried: \"Happiness!\" and (he thus) did not seem to be sad (to those who heard him). (tr. Fischer 2012:746-751) \n\nAccording to Fischer (2012:398-402), Shizi's message is based upon four key ideas: self-cultivation, timeliness, humility, and objectivity. \"With the single exception of self-cultivation (修身 or 治身), none of these ideals appear as technical terms in the text. Unlike the more usual advice to be good (仁), proper (義), or virtuous (德), even generalized terms for timeliness, humility, and objectivity are not used; rather, the advice must be inferred from the narrative.\"\n\nSelf-cultivation. The beginning of Chapter 1 recommends self-cultivation through broad learning.\nTo learn without tiring is that by which one cultivates the self; to teach without becoming bored is that by which one cultivates the people. (If) a cocoon is abandoned and not cultivated, then it will rot away and be discarded. (But if) a female artisan extracts the silk, then this can be used to make beautiful brocade, (fit even for) a great ruler to wear to court. (Your) person is (like) a cocoon: (if) it is abandoned and not cultivated, then (your capacity to) think and act will rot away. (tr. Fischer 2012:1221-1224) \nOne \"Shizi\" fragment (188, tr. Fischer 2012:3103), \"Imitate the conch and oyster and close the door\", is apparently related to self-cultivation through Daoist meditation\n\nTimeliness. Acting in a timely manner is a recurring textual theme, frequently phrased in terms of \"shen\" \"spirit; god, deity; spiritual, supernatural\" translated as \"spiritous\". Chapter 2 says:\nMisfortunes, at the beginning, are easily dispelled. As for those which cannot be dispelled, avoid them. (Because when) they are fully manifested, (you might) desire to dispel them (but will) be unable, and (you might) desire to avoid them (but will) be unable. Those who deal with (problems) while (still) spiritous: their activities are few but (their) merit is great. ... (When) a house burns and someone saves it, then (we) know their virtue. (But) the elderly who daub chimney cracks to guard (against fire), thereby living their whole lives without the misfortune of stray flames (causing a fire): (their) virtue (remains) unknown! ... Misfortunes also have \"chimneys,\" and (if) worthies were to travel the world to aid in \"daubing\" them, then the world would have no military suffering, yet none would know their virtue. Therefore it is said: \"Sagely people rectify (things) when (they) are yet spiritous [i.e., inchoate]; stupid people contend with (things) after (they) have become obvious.\" (tr. Fischer 2012:1376-1390) \nThe following context clarifies the semantics of \"spiritous\" (tr. Fischer 2012:1407), \"This 'spiritousness' is the beginning of the myriad things, the leading thread of the myriad affairs.\"\n\nHumility. The Shizi teaches that rulers should have humility when seeking good ministers, as well as have eminence when effectively ruling. For instance, this dialogue between Confucius and his disciple Zixia, \n\"Kong Zi said: 'Zixia, do you know how rulers function as rulers?' Zixia replied: '(If) fish lose the water (they are in), then (they) will die, (but) if water loses the fish (in it, it) is still water.' Kong Zi said: 'You know it!'.\" An effective ruler needs both to practice humility and to pursue self-cultivation through study. (tr. Fischer 2012:2149-2151) \n\nObjectivity. The text recommends that rulers objectively hire, fire, promote, and demote officials based upon the verifiable results of performance, rather than upon the traditional criteria of nepotism and hereditary rank. \nThe stupid and wise (decisions) of the many ministers are daily presented before (you): choose those whom are knowledgeable about affairs and order their plans (to be carried out). Those whom the many ministers promote are daily presented before (you): choose those whom are knowledgeable about people and order their promotions (to be carried out). The orderly and disorderly (effects) of the many ministers are daily presented before (you): choose those whom are competent in undertaking tasks and order their governance (to be carried out). ... (If you) use the worthy and employ the competent, (then you) will govern without exertion. (If you) rectify names and examine reality, (then you) will be revered without (having to) punish. (If you) arrive at the facts and see (them) purely, then truth and fallacy will not be obscured. (tr. Fischer 2012:1596-1618) \nWhile many Masters texts discussed the importance of employing worthies and rectifying names, the \"Shizi\" exceptionally argued for detached objectivity through \"examining reality\" (覈實) and \"seeing purely\" (見素).\n\nThe \"Shizi\" is the oldest extant text from the \"Zajia\" 雜家 Syncretism School, which is described as the \"eclectic, discriminating, selective, and consolidating trend in philosophical literature\" (Sellmann 2012:2). Shizi's writings were popular for centuries before the comprehensive Syncretist collections (c. 239 BCE) \"Lüshi Chunqiu\" and (c. 139 BCE) \"Huainanzi\". The Han scholar Dong Zhongshu (179–104 BCE) used the Syncretic method to combine early Confucianism with Naturalist and Legalist thought, and to promote Confucianism into the new official ideology of Imperial China. Ultimately, Fischer (2012:262) describes Master Shi as \"a man of his times. His syncretism made explicit the eclecticism of other authors of his day and demonstrated that many of their ideas were not necessarily incompatible.\" Consider this statement that six \"Zi\" \"Masters\" had substantially similar doctrines: \nMo Zi valued impartiality; Kong Zi valued public-mindedness, Huang Zi valued centeredness, Tian Zi valued equanimity, Lie Zi valued emptiness, and Liao Zi valued dispelling closed-mindedness. Their schools mutually denied each other, stopping (only) after several generations: but all were trapped in selfishness. Heaven, thearch, sovereign, monarch, governor, lord: all are (words for) \"ruler.\" Immense, wide open, vast, wide, broad, large, spacious, encompassing, supreme, eminent, big: all are (words for) \"great.\" More than ten names but the actuality is one. If (you) make impartiality, public-mindedness, emptiness, equanimity, centeredness, peace, and dispelling closed-mindedness one actuality, then there will be no mutual negating. (tr. Fischer 2012:1898-1912)\nThis passage is unusual because pre-Qin masters texts typically refer to other masters with disparagement or differentiation. The \"Zhuangzi\" (33, tr. Mair 1994:337-338), for instance, describes the early schools of Mohism whose, \"divergent distortions were so different that they called each other \"aberrant Mohists.\" They reviled each other with their disputations over \"hard\" and \"white\" and over \"sameness\" and \"difference,\" as well as with their rejoinders to each other over the disparity between \"odd\" and \"even\".\" The Chinese lexicographers Yong and Peng (2008:64) identify this \"Shizi\" passage, with six synonyms meaning \"jun\" 君 \"ruler\" and 11 synonyms meaning \"da\" 大 \"great; big\", as the source for the (c. 3rd century BCE) \"Erya\" dictionary (1.2-1.3) definitions that list 10 synonyms meaning \"jun\" 君 and 39 meaning \"da\" 大.\n\nThe \"zhuzi\" 諸子 \"The Masters/Philosophers\" category of the \"Yiwenzhi\" \"Treatise on Literature\" in the \"Hanshu\" subdivided philosophical books into ten schools: Confucianism (儒家), Daoism (道家), School of Yin-Yang (陰陽家), Legalism (法家), School of Names or Designatism (名家), Mohism (墨家), Diplomatic (縱橫家), Syncretism (雜家), Agriculturalism (農家), and Miscellaneous (小說). It summarized Syncretism (tr. Fischer 2012: 3155-3161): \"Syncretists probably emerged from the Councilor office. (They) combine Ruism and Mohism, unite Designatism and Legalism, know that (proper) state formation has (all) these, and see that (proper) kingly government is entirely interconnected: these are its strengths. (But if) the dissolute practice it, then (they) become dissipated and have no foundation to (which they can) return.\" The reconstructed \"Shizi\" text refers to most of these schools of thought.\n\nConfucianism or Ruism was centered upon the teachings and principles of Kongzi or Confucius. The \"Shizi\" upholds several Confucianist concepts, including \"ren\" \"goodness; humaneness\", \"yi\" \"propriety; righteousness\", \"li\" \"ritual; courtesy\", and \"zhengming\" \"rectification of names\". The text cites Confucius 17 times, more than any other person, and several quotes are not recorded elsewhere. For instance, this story about Zichan when he was prime minister for Duke Jian簡公 (r. 564– 530 BCE) of Zheng.\nZheng Duke Jian said to Zichan: \"Joyless drinking and unsounded bells and drums are my responsibilities (to repair). A misruled state, a disordered court, and not attaining (our) aims in dealing with the state sovereigns are your responsibilities (to repair). (If) you do not meddle in my pleasure, I will not meddle in your court.\" From then on, Zichan governed Zheng and the city gates did not close, the state had no robbers or criminals, and (its) roads had no hungry people (on them). Kong Zi said: \"Even with Zheng Duke Jian’s love of pleasure, still, even if (he) had held court while hugging a bell, it would have been acceptable.\" (tr. Fischer 2012:1818-1823) \nMohism emphasized universal love and meritocracy, in which rulers employ worthy ministers regardless of their social class. The \"Shizi\" likewise stressed meritocracy, for instance,\nIn ancient times, enlightened kings in pursuit of worthies did not avoid those far or near, nor discuss (their) status or lack thereof, (but rather they) denigrated (their own) positions in order to yield to the worthy, and diminished (their own) persons in order to put the (worthy) official first. Thus, Yao followed Shun into the midst of the fields, faced north to look at him, and did not fuss about a show of ritual. This is why former kings were able to rectify heaven and earth and is the reason why (they could) benefit the myriad things. (tr. Fischer 2012:1475-1479) \nMohism repudiated warfare, and Chapter 14 \"Stopping the Chu Army\" tells a legend about how Mozi convinced the king of Chu not to use Lu Ban's newly invented \"meets-with-heaven\" mobile scaling ladder to attack the weaker state of Song (tr. Fischer 2012:2034-2036). When Mozi asked the king what sort of person would refuse his own sumptuous, decorated carriage and want to steal his neighbor's dilapidated cart, the king replied, \"He definitely has a stealing sickness\". Mozi responded, \"Chu territory is two thousand kilometers square, (while) Song territory is (only) two hundred kilometers square: these are like the decorated carriage and the dilapidated cart!\", which convinced the king to cancel the attack.\n\nSchool of Names or Logicians focused upon the relationship between words and reality. The \"Shizi\" links the Logician doctrine of \"fen\" 分 \"separation; distribution; allocation\" with the Confucian rectification of names. Joseph Needham (1954:17) says the primary meaning of \"fen\" is \"separation\", but the \"Shizi\" uses it to mean \"the allotment of duties to persons by the ruler or lord\", comparable with Greek \"Moira\" \"portion of the whole\". Chapter 5 \"Allocation\" favors explicitly allocating tasks and responsibilities to specific ministers, through the \"rectification\" of ministerial titles and \"allocation\" of the duties that accompany any given position.\nHeaven and earth produce the myriad things and sages categorize them. (They) categorize things by means of establishing allocations, and facilitate (human) affairs by means of instituting (political) offices. Ruler and minister, father and son, superior and inferior, elder and youth, honored and despised, close and distant all fulfilling their allocations is called order. Concern that fulfills (its) allocation is called good; giving that fulfills (its) allocation is called proper; contemplation that fulfills (its) allocation is called wise; action that fulfills (its) allocation is called appropriate; words that fulfill (their) allocation are called faithful. After (you) have fulfilled all (these) allocations, (you) will become a complete person. (tr. Fischer 2012:1531-1537) \n\nSchool of Yin Yang or Naturalists believed heaven and earth were composed of \"qi\", constantly transforming through \"yin-yang\" and \"wuxing\". The \"Shizi\" describes this school's correlative cosmology idea that the universe responds to the ruler's morality.\nGoodness, propriety, sageliness, and wisdom are joined with heaven and earth. If heaven did not canopy (them), (then) how could the people depend upon (it) and gaze into (it)? If the earth did not support (them), (then ) how could the people live (from it) and move (on it)? If sages did not order (them), (then) how could the people be guided and led (by them)? This is why heaven canopies them, the earth supports them, and sages order them. The person of the sage is like the sun. The sun (is only) one foot (in diameter), (but its) brightness fills heaven and earth. The person of the sage is (also) small, but it illuminates places that are distant. Sages rectify themselves and the four quadrants are (thereby) ordered. (tr. Fischer 2012:2000-2005) \n\nDaoism was based upon the universal \"Dao\" 道 \"Way\" and advocated \"wuwei\" \"effortlessnesss\", \"ziran\" \"naturalness\", and simplicity. The \"Shizi\" (tr. Fischer 2012: 2659) mentions the Daoist paradigm of a mysterious cosmic Way. \"Guard the Way firmly, (even in) extremity, then (you may) make light of kingship or dukedom.\" It also (tr. Fischer 2012:1911) refers to three Daoist masters, Tianzi (Tian Pian 田駢), Liezi, and Lao Laizi (sometimes identified as Laozi): \"Tian Zi valued equanimity, Lie Zi valued emptiness, Liao Zi valued dispelling closed-mindedness\".\n\nLegalism was based upon the idea of rule by law, through rewards and punishments. Even though Shizi was a retainer of the famous Legalist Shang Yang, his reconstructed writings rarely refer to Legalism. Two examples (tr. Fischer 2012:1548-1549 and 2921-2922): \"(If) rewards and punishments follow names (then) the people will all be respectful.\", \"(When) the vehicle is light and the road is short, then the whip and the goad are not needed. That for which the whip and goad are needed is a long road or a heavy load. Punishments and laws are the whip and goad for the people.\"\n\nAgriculturalism advocated for rulers to participate in farming activities, following the example of their culture hero Shennong \"Divine Farmer\", who invented agriculture. The \"Shizi\" does not directly refer to Agriculturalism but mentions Shennong five times. For instance, (tr. Fischer 2012:2218-2220): \"Shun personally had (some) southside acres (of farmland), (while his) wife had fields of mulberry trees; Shen Nong likewise tilled and ruled. (This) is how (they) encouraged tilling.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2331877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331877", "title": "Sikhism and sexual orientation", "text": "Sikhism and sexual orientation\n\nSikhism has no specific teachings about homosexuality and the Sikh holy scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib, does not explicitly mention heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality. \n\nThe universal goal of a Sikh is to have no hate or animosity to any person, regardless of factors like race, caste, color, creed, gender, or sexuality. Within the last few years the topic of homosexuality has become much more discussed in religions all over the world, making the once taboo topic of homosexuality now a subject for open discussion among adherents.\n\nGiani Joginder Singh Vedanti of the Akal Takht (the temporal Sikh authority in India) has condemned homosexuality. In March 2005, he told visiting Sikh-Canadian Members of Parliament (MPs) that they had a religious duty to oppose same-sex marriage: \"The basic duty of Sikh MPs in Canada should be to support laws that stop this kind of practice [homosexuality], because there are thousands of Sikhs living in Canada, to ensure that Sikhs do not fall prey to this practice\". However, these Sikh MPs voted for same-sex marriage.\n\nThe divide between supporters and opponents of LGBT rights has become increasingly clear, creating a largely generational rift between older conservatives and younger liberals. Many Sikhs believe there is nothing wrong with being LGBT or supporting LGBT rights more generally, including same-sex marriage. These Sikhs believe that the view of some preachers in the Akal Takht is flawed. \n\nThe Sikh Rehat Maryada emphasizes the importance of a family lifestyle, and many Sikhs believe that since same-sex partners can’t reproduce and make a family that homosexuality should be condemned. This heteronormative way of viewing the family is questioned by those who believe Sikhism is more tolerant of people not viewed as “normal”. Many Sikh adherents believe the Rehat Maryada is meant to be interpreted and applied to life liberally rather than treated as a binding contract.\n\nThe Sikh holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib, details what behavior is expected of all Sikhs. It is seemingly silent on the subject of same-sex sexual behaviour, while it frequently encourages a married life. Marriage in Sikhism is seen as a union of souls, and the soul is seen as genderless, with the outward appearance of human beings (man, woman) being a temporary state. Same-sex marriage advocates refer to this as support for marriage equality in Sikhism. The Laavaan, the main part of Anand Karaj, are read at Sikh weddings for the union of two souls through marriage. In these hymns there is no mention of gender, but rather the participants are regarded as souls that are genderless. Marriage is seen as a spiritual journey to achieving lasting happiness through committing to the faith.\n\nAlthough the topic of homosexuality in Sikhism is tabooed, the younger generation is looking to the internet for answers. The internet has become a new way for young Sikhs born inside and outside of India to discuss the religion and current issues anonymously through the internet. The internet allows people to get the information they need without the discomfort of talking about it within the community. The internet has become a tool for young Sikhs to get information about current issues that may not be discussed directly within their communities.\n\nThere are some individuals that are using the power of the internet to discuss issues of homosexuality in the community. Junaid Asif, also known as Sikh Knowledge, openly speaks about his queer identity. He uses his platform to discuss his experience as a sexual minority within the Sikh community and how he believes that there is conversation that needs to be had. He did an interview with Kevin Newman where he discussed the lack of discussion about homosexuality in the Sikh and Punjabi community. This is the first time homosexuality in Sikhism has ever been discussed on live television on a Western news channel, and it addressed a topic that isn’t normally discussed in the community. Another Sikh named Manjinder Singh is using YouTube to open up about his experiences as a gay Sikh man. He’s creating his own platform on YouTube to reach a wider audience and is trying to get dialogue in the community started by defining what it means to be queer. In one of his videos he has a conversation with his mom about homosexuality in Punjabi. This video defines what it means to be gay, lesbian, bisexual, and being transgender in Punjabi and is targeted to the audience that doesn't necessarily understand the different sexual and gender identities. Other famous Sikh YouTube stars such Sikh Canadian comedian Jus Reign (Jasmeet Singh), and Lilly Singh (iiSuperwomanii), have openly voiced their support for LGBT rights.\n\nBoth the Sikh identity and sexual identities affect a person’s self concept and how they relate to their community. Like other religions, Sikhism strives to cultivate a sense of identity through religious practices, but in Sikhism there is a shared common physical identity too. Through the process of identity formation people begin to build a sense of individuality that allows them to find communities of people that they identify with. Identity formation at the intersection of Sikh and sexual identities has not been a focus of many studies. As the Sikh diaspora starts forming in places like Britain, some researchers are interested in understanding how these ethnic, religious, and sexual identities affect one’s self-concept. Many queer Sikhs find it difficult to reconcile their religious identity with their sexual identity.\n\nSome research is aiming to understand how the Sikh narrative and the narrative of sexuality coincide and conflict with one another. In an article written by David Mair for the University of Birmingham, David examines the life narrative of an openly gay, practicing Sikh named Daljeet. This study aimed to understand how clashing narratives affect one’s self-concept and relationship to the community at large. After having an in-depth conversation with Daljeet, David found that many of the struggles that he faced were because of the clash of narratives in his own life. Daljeet’s narratives of Indian masculinity, ethnicity, religion, and sexuality conflicted with one another and his self-concept is deeply affected by it. Those who do not conform to heteronormative and binary definitions of gender and sexuality are tasked with creating a new narrative that incorporates all aspects of their identity in an encompassing way.\n\n\n"}

This Temple will be built in the same style as the Samye monastery, the first temple built in Tibet that was founded by Padmasambhava in the 8th century CE.\n\nThe aims of the Temple for Peace is not only to share teachings of Tibetan Buddhism but also to welcome demonstrations linked to peace: symposia, inter-religious meetings, expositions and performances. It will be a place to encounter and favor the exchanges between different schools of Buddhism, as well as Christian, Moslem, Jews, and other traditions such as those of Indians of North America and Indigenous Australians. Meetings will be organized between wise representatives of these traditions, enabling a better knowledge of their diversity as well as common values: their contributions in building a better world, mutual tolerance and the respect of others, in particular through peace and non-violence. Conferences will gather recognized personalities working to promote peace such as Nobel Peace Prize laureates, women and men involved in humanitarian projects, religious dignitaries of different confessions, artists working to promote respect and tolerance between peoples.\n\nIn 1995 and in 1998, Lama Gyurme visited Tibet in a pilgrimage and met Orgyen Trinley Dorje, the 17th Karmapa at Tsurphu.

{"id": "34227340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34227340", "title": "The Viking Way (book)", "text": "The Viking Way (book)\n\nThe Viking Way: Religion and War in Late Iron Age Scandinavia is an archaeological study of Norse paganism in Late Iron Age Scandinavia. It was written by the English archaeologist Neil Price, then a professor at the University of Aberdeen, and first published by the Department of Archaeology and Ancient History at Uppsala University in 2002. A revised second edition is due to be published in 2017 by Oxbow Books.\n\nPrice had worked on the subject of Norse paganism for his doctoral thesis, undertaken between 1988 and 2002, first at the University of York, England and then at the University of Uppsala, Sweden. Although primarily archaeological, Price took an interdisciplinary approach to the subject, drawing evidence from other disciplines such as history and anthropology.\n\nDivided into seven chapters, Price opened the book with a discussion of his theoretical approach, before providing an overview of what is known of pre-Christian Norse religion and magic from both literary and archaeological studies. He then moves into providing a deeper study of \"Seiðr\", or Norse magical practices, identifying shamanic elements within it.\n\nThe book would be widely acclaimed by archaeologists working in European archaeology, and praised as a model for both future interdisciplinary research and for understanding past religious beliefs from an archaeological perspective.\n\nThe origins of \"The Viking Way\" came from Price's doctoral research, which he undertook at the University of York's Department of Archaeology from October 1988 through to May 1992. Under the supervision of the archaeologists Steve Roskams and Richard Hall, Price had initially focused his research on the Anglo-Scandinavian tenements at 16–22 Coppergate in York, although eventually moved away from this to focus on archaeology within Scandinavia itself. Personal circumstances meant that Price was unable to finish his doctoral thesis at York, and in 1992 he emigrated to Sweden, where he spent the following five years working as a field archaeologist. Despite his full-time employment, he continued to be engaged in archaeological research in a private capacity, publishing a series of academic papers and presenting others at conferences. In 1996 joined the Department of Archaeology at the University of Uppsala as a research scholar, beginning full-time work there the following year. At Uppsala, he went on to complete his doctoral thesis and gain his PhD under the supervision of Anne-Sofie Gräslund.\n\nIn undertaking research for his doctoral thesis, Price took great interest in circumpolar shamanism, attending academic conferences on this subject and reading much published material that had been produced by anthropologists. He found that much of the data which he collected in this area was ultimately of little use for his thesis, and so he included it in an edited anthology which he put together entitled \"The Archaeology of Shamanism\" (2001).\n\nPrice opens \"The Viking Way\" with a discussion of why he chose to write the book, noting how he wanted to understand the mindset of the Scandinavians living in the Viking Age; in his own words, the book is his attempt to \"write an explicitly 'cognitive' archaeology of the Vikings\". He proceeds to explain his interdisciplinary approach to the subject of Norse paganism, drawing from textual sources as well as archaeology. Noting that this is a view that has been championed by post-processualists like Ian Hodder, he proceeds to discuss the manner in which the Scandinavian Late Iron Age is simultaneously viewed as the final period of prehistory and the first of the medieval.\n\nPrice goes on to discuss the role of cognitive archaeology and its multiple problems, but nonetheless defends his position in taking a cognitive archaeological approach within his study. He then highlights the rise of Fourth World archaeology, a sub-section of world archaeology that focuses on the histories of contemporary indigenous peoples, and notes the impact which this has on his study, in particular regarding his work with the Sami people of Northern Europe. He highlights the need to recognise that modern archaeologists have many problems facing the cognitive understandings of past people like the Norse, arguing for the need to take an approach which he terms \"odd archaeology\", recognising the \"oddness\" of societies other than our own. He contrasts this \"odd archaeology\" with queer archaeology, which focuses on the study of deviants within any given society. He then rounds off the chapter by summarising the rest of \"The Viking Way\"'s contents.\n\nAfter offering an overview of what is known about Norse mythology from surviving Scandinavian literary sources, Price continues to discuss the various research perspectives that have been adopted by past scholars investigating Norse paganism, including those of philologists and specialists in religious studies. Focusing on the pre-Christian religions themselves, he then discusses Iron Age Scandinavian beliefs regarding deities such as Óðinn and Þórr. Price moves on to look at the wide variety of other supernatural entities that existed within the Norse world-view: the servants of the gods (i.e. the \"valkyrja\" and Huginn and Muninn), the beings with cosmological purpose (i.e. the \"Nornir\"), the \"Jötnar\", the supernatural beings of nature (i.e. \"dvergr\" and elves), 'spirits' and projections of the human soul. He then discusses the evidence for temples and sacred spaces in Iron Age Scandinavia, and the various priestly figures who would have carried out cultic functions.\n\nIn the second part of the chapter, Price looks more specifically at the Norse magical practices, known as \"Seiðr\". Noting that there were specific terms applying to different forms of magical practice in the Norse context, such as \"Galdr\" and \"Gandr\", he also highlights the fact that sorcery was intricately connected to cultic practice. He then proceeds to look at the various literary sources which refer to \"Seiðr\", such as the Skaldic poetry, Eddic poetry, the sagas of the kings, sagas of the Icelanders, the \"fornaldarsǫgur\", the \"Biskupasǫgur\", law codes and also several non-Scandinavian sources. Finally, he offers an overview of earlier scholarly research into \"Seiðr\", discussing a variety of studies published from the 19th century through to the beginning of the 21st.\n\nThe third chapter is devoted to an examination of the literary and archaeological evidence for \"Seiðr\" practices in Norse society. Price starts with an examination of the god Óðinn, noting his literary associations with sorcery and shamanism, as well as identifying the shamanic and magical associations of those supernatural beings that served him, such as his horse Sleipnir and ravens Huginn and Muninn. Furthermore, he lists a total of 240 names which have been applied to Óðinn in the Norse literature, illustrating his multi-faceted role in Norse religion. Moving on to look at another deity, Freyja, Price discusses her association with magic and sorcery, before then discussing shamanistic and magical elements in pagan Norse cosmology.\n\nPrice goes on to look at the \"performers\" of \"Seiðr\", the majority of whom were apparently female. He discusses various references to female magicians in Old Norse literature, and looks into the multitude of different words used for them, arguing that some of them may have referred to different categories of magician. He then proceeds to discuss male magicians, who were a minority in the surviving literature, being viewed as deviants who had committed \"ergi\". He moves on to deal with accounts of the \"Seiðr\"-workers' assistants in the literature, before turning his attention to the burial evidence for Norse magical practitioners. Here, he notes that both inhumation and crematory burial can be interpreted as perhaps being the resting place of sorcerers if they are buried with items which likely had magical uses, such as staffs and narcotics. As evidence, Price highlights a number of Viking Age graves that have been excavated in Scandinavia and found to contain potentially magical items; this includes three inhumation burials at Birka in the town of Björkö in Uppland, and two cremation burials at Klinta in Köpings parish, Öland, all of which were in Sweden, as well as a Danish grave from the cemetery at Fyrkat in Jylland and another from the Swedish cemetery at Aska in Hagebyhöga parish, Östergötland. Looking at the Oseburg ship burial in Norway, he then looks at the burial of what appears to be an Anglo-Scandinavian individual from the Danelaw whom was discovered at Peel Castle on the Isle of Man.\n\nPrice carries on by looking at the \"performance\" of \"Seiðr\" itself, discussing the potential use of ritual architecture and space, dealing with literary and archaeological evidence for \"seiðhjaller\" platforms, chair pendants, door frames and empty ritual space (\"útiseta\"). He follows this with a study of the clothes that magical practitioners may have worn, discussing ideas regarding masks, veils and head coverings. Debating whether they made use of drums in their performance of \"Seiðr\", he then undertakes a study of the use of staffs and wands in Nordic magic, highlighting the existence of a number of metal and wooden staffs found in the archaeological record. Moving on, he looks at the evidence for the entheogenic use of narcotics and intoxicants such as alcohol, henbane and cannabis. He then rounds off this section of the chapter with a discussion of charms, songs and chants, as well as debating whether we can understand the role of trance and ecstasy in \"seiðr\". Price proceeds to deal with the gender concepts surrounding \"seiðr\", and the fact that male practitioners of sorcery were viewed as social and sexual deviants who had committed \"ergi\". Looking at the role of Óðinn as sorcerer under the lens of queer theory, Price then discusses the evidence that \"Seiðr\" practices offered involved sexual acts such as masturbation. Moving on, he looks at the Norse concept of the soul, and the idea that \"seiðr\" practitioners could command spirits known as \"gandir\". Finally, the chapter is brought to an end with a discussion of the domestic uses of \"seiðr\", including divination, healing, hunting and weather magic.\n\nProceeding to discuss evidence for shamanism in Scandinavia, Price casts a critical eye on previous scholarship that has argued for the existence of shamanistic beliefs and practices from the Paleolithic through to the Viking Age, being particularly critical of Jimmy Strassburg's work. He then looks at the arguments that have previously been put forward describing \"seiðr\" as shamanic.\n\n\"The Viking Way\" was reviewed in the journal \"Antiquity\" by Matthew Townend of the University of York's Centre for Medieval Studies. Townend was of the opinion that Price's \"exceptional\" work represented \"one of the most important contributions to Viking studies in recent years, quite possibly in recent decades\", dealing as it did with the neglected area of magic in the Viking world. Praising Price's work as being \"logical, persuasive and theoretically astute\", he found much to commend it, opining that it had much to teach archaeologists, while at the same time being \"very easy\" to read, written in a prose style which was \"lucid, and often stylish and witty\". Furthermore, praising the use of illustrations and bibliography, he did however comment that the book would have been improved by the inclusion of an index.\n\nWriting in \"Fornvännen\", the archaeologist Martin Carver of the University of York praised \"The Viking Way\" as a work of \"impeccable and comprehensive scholarship\", but noted that a better title might have been \"The Viking Mind\". He commended the interdisciplinary approach that Carver utilized, noting that very few contemporary archaeologists had successfully taken such an approach, and expressed his opinion that Price had written a \"spellbinding\" work.\n\nIn his book \"Shamanism in Norse Myth and Magic\" (2009), the English scholar Clive Tolley noted that his work overlapped with Price's \"The Viking Way\" in several respects, but that Price's work focused on an archaeological rather than a literary approach to the subject. Reviewing Tolley's work in the \"Time and Mind\" journal, historian Ronald Hutton commented that Price's study had gained \"much admiration\" for its multidisciplinary approach. Comparing Price and Tolley's research, Hutton opined that the former played up the importance of Sami shamanic elements entering southern Scandinavia, while Tolley played it down, approaches that can be balanced with one another.\n\nWriting in his opening paper, \"Agency, Intellect and the Archaeological Agenda\", published in the academic anthology \"Signals of Belief in Early England: Anglo-Saxon Paganism Revisited\" (2010), Martin Carver quoted from Price's book, before remarking that this \"remarkable\" work has \"done much to make the study of non-Christian religion once more respectable among archaeologists.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2359143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2359143", "title": "Yazata", "text": "Yazata\n\nYazata (Avestan: 𐬰𐬀𐬭𐬀𐬚𐬎𐬱𐬙𐬭𐬀) is the Avestan language word for a Zoroastrian concept with a wide range of meanings but generally signifying (or used as an epithet of) a divinity. The term literally means \"worthy of worship or veneration\", and is thus, in this more general sense, also applied to certain healing plants, primordial creatures, the \"fravashis\" of the dead, and to certain prayers that are themselves considered holy. The \"yazata\"s collectively are \"the good powers under Ohrmuzd [Ahura Mazda]\", who is \"the greatest of the \"yazata\"s\".\n\n\"Yazata\" is an Avestan language passive adjectival participle derived from \"yaz-\"; \"to worship, to honor, to venerate\", from Proto-Indo-European \"*yeh₂ǵ-\" (“to worship, revere, sacrifice”). The word \"yasna\" – \"worship, sacrifice, oblation, prayer\" – comes from the same root. A \"yaza+ ta\" is accordingly \"a being worthy of worship\", \"an object of worship\" or \"a holy being\".\n\nAs the stem form, \"yazata-\" has the inflected nominative forms \"yazatō\", pl. \"yazatåŋhō\". These forms reflect Proto-Iranian \"*yazatah\" and pl. \"*yazatāhah\". In Middle Persian the term became \"yazad\" or \"yazd\", pl. \"yazdān\", continuing in New Persian as \"izad\".\n\nRelated terms in other languages are Sanskrit \"yájati\" \"he worships, he sacrifices\", \"yajatá-\" \"worthy of worship, holy\", \"yajñá\" \"sacrifice\", and perhaps also Greek ἅγιος \"hagios\" \"devoted to the gods, sacred, holy\".\n\nThe term \"yazata\" is already used in the Gathas, the oldest texts of Zoroastrianism and believed to have been composed by Zoroaster himself. In these hymns, \"yazata\" is used as a generic, applied to Ahura Mazda as well as to the \"divine sparks\", that in later tradition are the Amesha Spentas. In the Gathas, the \"yazata\"s are effectively what the \"daeva\"s are not; that is, the \"yazata\"s are to be worshipped while the \"daeva\"s are to be rejected.\n\nThe Gathas also collectively invoke the \"yazata\"s without providing a clue as to which entities are being invoked, and—given the structure and language of the hymns—it is generally not possible to determine whether these \"yazata\"s are abstract concepts or are manifest entities. Amongst the lesser Yazatas being invoked by name by the poet of the Gathas are Sraosha, Ashi, Geush Tashan, Geush Urvan, Tushnamaiti, and Iza, and all of which \"win mention in his hymns, it seems, because of their close association with rituals of sacrifice and worship\".\n\nIn the Younger Avesta, the \"yazata\"s are unambiguously divine, with divine powers but performing mundane tasks such as serving as charioteers for other \"yazata\"s. Several \"yazata\"s are given anthropomorphic attributes, such as cradling a mace or bearing a crown upon their heads, or not letting sleep interrupt their vigil against the demons.\n\nAt some point during the late 5th or early 4th century BCE, the Achaemenids instituted a religious calendar in which each day of the month was named after, and placed under the protection of, a particular \"yazata\". These day-name dedications were not only of religious significance because they ensured that those divinities remained in the public consciousness, they also established a hierarchy among the \"yazata\"s, with specific exalted entities having key positions in the day-name dedications (see Zoroastrian calendar for details).\n\nAlthough these day-name dedications are mirrored in scripture, it cannot be determined whether these day-name assignments were provoked by an antecedent list in scripture (e.g. \"Yasna\" 16), or whether the day-name dedications provoked the compilation of such lists. Relatively certain however is that the day-name dedications predate the Avesta's \"Siroza\" (\"30 days\"), which contain explicit references to the \"yazata\"s as protectors/guardians of their respective days of the month.\n\nThe 9th–12th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition observe the \"yazata\"s (by then as Middle Persian \"yazad\"s) in much the same way as the hymns of the Younger Avesta. In addition, in roles that are only alluded to in scripture, they assume characteristics of cosmological or eschatological consequence.\n\nFor instance, Aredvi Sura Anahita (\"Ardvisur Nahid\") is both a divinity of the waters as well as a rushing world river that encircles the earth, which is blocked up by Angra Mainyu (\"Ahriman\") thus causing drought. The blockage is removed by Verethragna (\"Vahram\"), and Tishtrya (\"Tir\") gathers up the waters and spreads them over the earth (Zam) as rain. In stories with eschatological significance, Sraosha (\"Sarosh\"), Mithra (\"Mihr\"), and Rashnu (\"Rashn\") are guardians of the Chinvat bridge, the bridge of the separator, across which all souls must pass.\n\nFurther, what the calendrical dedications had begun, the tradition completed: at the top of the hierarchy was Ahura Mazda, who was supported by the great heptad of Amesha Spentas (\"Ameshaspand\"s/\"Mahraspand\"s), through which the Creator realized (\"created with his thought\") the manifest universe. The Amesha Spentas in turn had \"hamkars\" \"assistants\" or \"cooperators\", each a caretaker of one facet of creation.\n\nIn both tradition and scripture, the terms 'Amesha Spenta' and 'yazata' are sometimes used interchangeably. In general, however, 'Amesha Spenta' signifies the six great \"divine sparks\". In tradition, \"yazata\" is the first of the 101 epithets of Ahura Mazda. The word also came to be applied to Zoroaster, but Zoroastrians to this day remain sharply critical of any attempts to deify the prophet. In a hierarchy that does not include either Ahura Mazda or the Amesha Spentas amongst the \"yazatas\", the most prominent amongst those \"worthy of worship\" is Mithra, who \"is second only in dignity to Ohrmazd (i.e. Ahura Mazda) himself.\"\n\nIn the 1860s and 1870s, the linguist Martin Haug interpreted Zoroastrian scripture in Christian terms, and compared the \"yazata\"s to the angels of Christianity. In this scheme, the Amesha Spentas are the arch-angel retinue of Ahura Mazda, with the \"hamkars\" as the supporting host of lesser angels.\n\nAt the time Haug wrote his translations, the Parsi (i.e. Indian Zoroastrian) community was under intense pressure from English and American missionaries, who severely criticized the Zoroastrians for—as John Wilson portrayed it in 1843—\"polytheism\", which the missionaries argued was much less worth than their own \"monotheism\". At the time, Zoroastrianism lacked theologians of its own, and so the Zoroastrians were poorly equipped to make their own case. In this situation, Haug's counter-interpretation came as a welcome relief, and was (by-and-large) gratefully accepted as legitimate.\n\nHaug's interpretations were subsequently disseminated as Zoroastrian ones, which then eventually reached the west where they were seen to corroborate Haug. Like most of Haug's interpretations, this comparison is today so well entrenched that a gloss of 'yazata' as 'angel' is almost universally accepted; both in publications intended for a general audience as well as in (non-philological) academic literature.\n\nAmongst the Muslims of Islamic Iran, Sraosha came to be \"arguably the most popular of all the subordinate Yazatas\", for as the angel Surush, only he (of the entire Zoroastrian pantheon) is still venerated by name.\n"}
{"id": "2009102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2009102", "title": "Yin Shun", "text": "Yin Shun\n\n(Master) Yin Shun (印順導師, \"Yìnshùn Dǎoshī\") (12 March 1906 – 4 June 2005) was a well-known Buddhist monk and scholar in the tradition of Chinese Mahayana Buddhism. Though he was particularly trained in the Three Treatise school, he was an advocate of the One Vehicle (or Ekayana) as the ultimate and universal perspective of Buddhahood for all, and as such included all schools of Buddha Dharma, including the Five Vehicles and the Three Vehicles, within the meaning of the Mahayana as the One Vehicle. Yin Shun's research helped bring forth the ideal of \"Humanistic\" (human-realm) Buddhism, a leading mainstream Buddhist philosophy studied and upheld by many practitioners. His work also regenerated the interests in the long-ignored Agamas (Nikayas) among Chinese Buddhists society and his ideas are echoed by Theravadin teacher Bhikkhu Bodhi. As a contemporary master, he was most popularly known as the mentor of Cheng Yen (Pinyin: Zhengyan), the founder of Tzu-Chi Buddhist Foundation, as well as the teacher to several other prominent monastics.\n\nAlthough Master Yin Shun is closely associated with the Tzu-Chi Foundation, he has had a decisive influence on others of the new generation of Buddhist monks such as Sheng-yen of Dharma Drum Mountain and Hsing Yun of Fo Guang Shan, who are active in humanitarian aid, social work, environmentalism and academic research as well. He is considered to be one of the most influential figures of Taiwanese Buddhism, having influenced many of the leading Buddhist figures in modern Taiwan. \n\nYin Shun was born on March 12, 1906 in a village in Zhejiang Province, China. His birth name was Zhang Luqin (Wade–Giles: Chang Luch'in). At the time of Zhang's birth, it was the end of the Qing Dynasty. Eleven days after his birth, Zhang was critically ill and nearly died. He began school at age seven.\n\nIn his studies, he stumbled upon the subject of immortality—a subject that Zhang found interesting. His parents found what Zhang was doing to be very unusual, so they required him to teach at other schools.\n\nZhang turned his attention to Confucianism and Taoism, but neither of their philosophies could help him find the truth. At one point, Christianity sparked light into his heart. However, Zhang still felt empty, and could not commit himself to Christianity after two years. One day, Zhang was looking for something to read. He stumbled onto the words \"the Buddha Dharma\". This immediately sparked interest into his heart again, like what Christianity did for him, and Zhang zealously looked for anything that had to do with Buddhism.\n\nIn 1930, Zhang applied to a Buddhist college in Beijing. For many days he had traveled from his home to Beijing, with high hopes. He arrived too late for acceptance.\n\nWhile pondering where he could go next, Zhang thought of a temple called \"Tiantong Temple\". Zhang then went to Mount Putuo, where he met a young man named Wang. Both searched for an abode where they could study the Buddha Dharma. They eventually found a small place where they could do so, where their abbot who was well cultivated. They asked to study under him.\n\nThe elder monk then referred Zhang and Wang to another place called Fuzhun Monastery (福泉庵), less than a half mile from where they were. The two hurried to Fuzhun Monastery. Later, on October 11, 1930, the abbot, Master Qingnian (清念和尚), shaved Zhang Luqin's head and gave him the Dharma name of \"Yin Shun\" (印順).\n\nMaster Taixu 太虛 (1890–1947) divided Mahayana Buddhism into three types. They are: School of śūnyatā and prajña (faxing konghui zong 法性空慧宗, Madhyamaka), School of dharmalaksana and vijnaptimatra (faxiang weishi zong 法相唯識宗) and School of dharma-dhatu and perfect enlightenment (fajie yuanjue zong 法界圓覺宗). Furthermore, he states that dharma-dhatu is on the highest level, complete and the final dharma. On the following levels are Madhyamaka and Vijnaptimatra.\n\nBy contrast, Yinshun 印順 (1906–2005), Tiaxu’s disciple, took a different direction from that of his teacher. He claims that Mahayana Buddhism can be divided into three systems. They are: School of śūnyatā and name only (xingkong 性空唯名系, Madhyamaka), School of illusion and Vijñapti-mātra (weishi 虛妄唯識系, Vijñapti-mātra) and School of genuine and permanent mind (zhenchang 真常唯心系, Tathāgata-garbha).\n\nFor him, early Mahayana Buddhism is characterized by Nāgārjuna’s 龍樹 prajñapāramitā thought. Mahayana Buddhism, in its middle stage, is characterized by Vijñapti-mātra which was upheld by Asanga and Vasubandhu. Later Mahayana Buddhism is mainly characterized by Tathāgata-garbha thought 如來藏思想. Therefore, it is clear that Yinshun distanced himself from his teacher’s position. \n\nIn March 2004, he was awarded the Order of Propitious Clouds Second Class, for his contributions to the revitalization of Buddhism in Taiwan.\n\nOn February 1963, a thirty-two-day novitiate for Buddhist monks and nuns was held in Taipei. Monks and nuns came from all over Taiwan to register. All were accepted except a young female devotee from Hualien, a county in eastern Taiwan.\n\nMaster Yin Shun recalled the day he first met Master Cheng Yen:\n\n¹At the time, Yin Shun only had three disciples. All three now are teaching the Buddha Dharma in the United States.\n\nMaster Yin Shun then said to her, \"Our karmic relationship is very special. As a nun, you must always be committed to Buddhism and to all living beings.\"\n\nSince the registration for the novitiate was about to end within the hour, the venerable master quickly gave the young disciple her Buddhist name, \"Cheng Yen\", and told her to get going and begin the novitiate promptly. At that moment, the conditions for the creation of the Tzu-Chi Foundation began.\n\nIn the summer of 1979, Master Yin Shun came to Hualien. Living in this beautiful but undeveloped part of the island, Cheng Yen told Master Yin Shun about her aspiration to build a high-quality hospital for the people living in eastern Taiwan, where there were few medical facilities.\n\nAs he listened to her, he could foresee the daunting challenges lying ahead. Like a father sharing his life experiences with his daughter, he said, \"Just like the time you told me you intended to begin charity work, I reminded you to think whether you would have the strength and the money when more people came to you for help. The task can only be realized with unwavering commitment.\" \n\nSeeing his disciple's resolution, Master Yin Shun's mind was put at ease. With this talk, the hospital construction project began. Although Cheng Yen would soon face many insurmountable difficulties and challenges, Master Yin Shun's support gave Cheng Yen the strength to go on. He transferred virtually all the monetary offerings made to him by his followers to the hospital construction. The sum accumulated throughout the years was truly sizable.\n\nOn June 4, 2005, Master Yin Shun died after fighting pulmonary tuberculosis since 1954. He died in Tzu-Chi hospital in Hualien at the age of 100. In Taiwan, many were stunned to hear of his death, even though his death was expected in the coming months. Tzu-Chi, along with other Buddhist organizations and monasteries influenced by Yin Shun, joined in mourning for eight days, the length of his funeral.\n\nAmong those attending the services were Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian, ROC Premier Frank Hsieh, and other legislators. Several monastics from many parts of the world, predominantly the United States, also attended Master Yin Shun's funeral. Monastics who were disciples of Master Yin Shun also attended the funeral, including Master Cheng Yen herself.\n\nMaster Yin Shun had a simple and spartan lifestyle in the last days of his life, so his disciples decided to keep his funeral simple but solemn. His funeral was held at Fu Yan Vihara in Hsinchu, where he had lived for many years until his death. Master Yin Shun was later cremated on June 10 and his ashes and his portrait used during the services were placed inside a hall alongside the remains of other monastics.\n\n\n\n"}

When the princes had finally been both caught and hung up within the executional area, Zhao Qi would boldly tear up the executional edict sent by the king himself. Thus, Zhao Qi was seemingly the equal of Shang Rong, who as well came to elaborate the idiocy of the king. \n\nAfter Shang Rong's unfortunate death within the throne hall before the king, Zhao Qi would also speak his ultimate beliefs. Even after then being threatened of death by King Zhou, Zhao Qi would spout the words, \"I have no fear of dying. My death will let future generations know how I feel about your termination of Cheng Tang's reign! May your foul name stink for millions of years!\" Thus, Zhao Qi died with his fellow friend, Shang Rong as a bold figure that would forever serve as a loyal sword of Cheng Tang.\n\nZhao Qi was appointed as the deity of Tianshe Star (天赦星) in the end.\n\n"}
