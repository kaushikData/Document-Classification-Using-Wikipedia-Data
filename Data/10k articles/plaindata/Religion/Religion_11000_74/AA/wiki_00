He was supposed to have learned his skills in his homeland of Hyperborea, which he fled during a plague. He was said to be endowed with the gift of prophecy, and by this as well as by his Scythian dress and simplicity and honesty he created great sensation in Greece, and was held in high esteem.\n\nAccording to Herodotus he was said to have traveled around the world with an arrow symbolizing Apollo, eating no food. Heraclides Ponticus wrote that Abaris flew on it. Plato (\"Charmides\" 158C) classes him amongst the \"Thracian physicians\" who practice medicine upon the soul as well as the body by means of \"incantations\" (\"epodai\"). A temple to Persephone at Sparta was attributed to Abaris by Pausanias (9.10). Alan H. Griffiths compares Abaris to Aristeas in terms of being a \"shamanistic missionary and savior-figure\" and notes Pindar places Abaris during the time of Croesus.\n\nA particularly rich trove of anecdotes is found in Iamblichus's \"Vita Pythagorica\". Here, Abaris is said to have purified Sparta and Knossos, among other cities, from plagues (\"VP\" 92–93). Abaris also appears in a climactic scene alongside Pythagoras at the court of the Sicilian tyrant Phalaris. The two sages discuss divine matters, and urge the obstinate tyrant towards virtue (ibid. 215–221). Iamblicus also attributes to Abaris a special expertise at extispicy, the art of predicting future events through the examination of anomalies in the entrails of animals. The \"Suda\" attributes a number of books to Abaris, including a volume of \"Scythian Oracles\" in dactylic hexameter, a prose theogony, a poem on the marriage of the river Hebrus, a work on purifications, and an account of Apollo's visit to the Hyperboreans. But such works, if they were really current in ancient times, were no more genuine than his reputed correspondence with Phalaris the tyrant.\n\nA more securely historical Greco-Scythian philosopher, who travelled among the Hellenes in the early sixth century, was Anacharsis.\n\nEighteenth century Bath architect John Wood, the Elder wrote about Abaris, and put forth the fanciful suggestion that he should be identified with King Bladud.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "68591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68591", "title": "Adullam", "text": "Adullam\n\nAdullam () is an ancient ruin, formerly known by the Arabic appellation \"ʿAīd el Mâ\" (or \"`Eîd el Mieh\"), built upon a hilltop overlooking the Elah Valley, south of Bet Shemesh in Israel. In the late 19th century, the town was still in ruins. The hilltop ruin is also known by the name \"Khurbet esh-Sheikh Madkour\", named after Madkour, one of the sons of the Sultan Beder, for whom is built a shrine (\"wely\") and formerly called by its inhabitants \"Wely Madkour\". The hilltop is mostly flat, with cisterns carved into the rock. The remains of stone structures which once stood there can still be seen. Sedimentary layers of ruins from the old Canaanite and Israelite eras, mostly potsherds, are noticeable everywhere, although olive groves now grow atop of this hill, enclosed within stone hedges. The villages of Aderet, Neve Michael/Roglit, and Aviezer are located nearby. Access to the site may be obtained by passing through the cooperative small holders' agricultural villages (\"Moshavim\") of Aderet or Neve Michael (known also as Roglit). The ruin lies about 3 kilometers south of Moshav Neve Michael.\nThe \"Adullam\" mentioned in the Hebrew Bible is usually thought to be identical with \"Tell Sheikh Madkhur\", that is, the archaeological ruin referred to in this article as \"Adullam.\" \n\nAdullam was one of the royal cities of the Canaanites referred to in the Hebrew Bible. Although listed in Joshua as being a city in the plain, it is actually partly in the hill country, partly in the plain. It stood near the highway which later became the Roman road in the Valley of Elah, the scene of David's victory over Goliath. It was here that Judah, the son of Jacob (Israel), came when he left his father and brothers in Migdal Eder, where he befriended a certain Hirah, an Adullamite, and where he met his first wife (unnamed in Genesis), the daughter of Shua. It was one of the towns which Rehoboam fortified against Egypt. Micah calls it \"the glory of Israel.\"\n\nKing David sought refuge in Adullam after being expelled from the city of Gath by King Achish. I Samuel refers to the Cave of Adullam where he found protection while living as a refugee from King Saul. It was there that \"every one that was in distress gathered together, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented.\" Certain caves, grottos and sepulchres are still to be seen on the hilltop, as well as on its northern and eastern slopes.\n\nIt was in Adullam that Judas Maccabaeus retired with his fighting men, after returning from war against the Idumaeans. As late as the early 4th century CE, Adullam was described by Eusebius as being \"a very large village about ten [Roman] miles east of Eleutheropolis.\"\n\nAdullam was an inhabited village in the late 16th-century. An Ottoman tax ledger of 1596 lists \"`Ayn al-Mayyā\" () in the \"nahiya\" \"Ḫalīl\" (Hebron subdistrict), and where it is noted that it had in 1596 thirty-six Muslim heads of households. The copyist of the same tax ledger had erroneously mistaken the Arabic \"dal\" in the document for a \"nun\", and which name has since been corrected by historical geographers Yoel Elitzur and Toledano to read \"A'ïd el-Miah\" (), based on the entry's number of fiscal unit in the \"daftar\" and its corresponding place on Hütteroth's map. The Arabic name, being a corruption of \"Adullam\", is a product of popular etymology.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the hilltop ruin and its adjacent ruins were explored by French explorer, Victor Guérin, who wrote:\n\n[Upon leaving the hilltop ruin, \"Khirbet el-Sheikh Madkour\"], at 11:20 [AM], we descend to the east in the valley. At 11:25 [AM], I examine other ruins, called \"Khirbet A'id el-Miah\". Sixty toppled houses in the \"wadi\" formed a village that still existed in the Muslim period, as [proven by] the remains of a mosque there observed. In antiquity, the ruins that cover the plateau of the hill of \"Sheikh Madkour\" and which extend in the valley were probably one and the same city, divided into two parts, the upper part and the lower part. \n\nAccording to Conder, an ancient road, leading from Beit Sur to Ashdod, once passed through \"ʿAīd el Mâ\" (Adullam).\n\nFrench orientalist and archaeologist, Charles Clermont-Ganneau, visited the site in 1874 and wrote: \"The place is absolutely uninhabited, except during the rainy season, when the herdsmen take shelter there for the night.\"\n\nEarly drawings depicting the so-called \"Adullam cave\" have tentatively been identified with the cavern of \"Umm el Tuweimin\", and the cave at \"Khureitun\" (named after Chariton the ascetic), because of their immense size. Modern-day archaeologists have rejected these early hypotheses.\n\nThe Adullam Grove Nature Reserve is a nature reserve managed by the Israel Nature and National Parks Protection Authority. It was established in 1994.\n\nThe Adullam Caves park is a JNF park of 50,000 dunams () of mostly pine forests, which were planted by Jewish immigrants who settled in the Lachish region in the early years of the state. The park was prepared for public use by the Israel Antiquities Authority and the Jewish National Fund. \nToday the park sits in an area that is threatened by shale oil extraction through the CCR ground-heating process, with the Green Zionist Alliance and the grassroots group Save Adullam, among others, working to stop shale oil extraction in the region.\n\n\n\n"}

He was declared excommunicated \"latae sententiae\" by Pope John Paul II because of his unauthorized consecration by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre in 1988, deemed by the Holy See to be \"unlawful\" and \"a schismatic act\". The SSPX denied the validity of the excommunication, saying that the consecrations were necessary due to a moral and theological crisis in the Catholic Church. The automatic excommunication was remitted by the Holy See on 21 January 2009.\n\nGalarreta was born in 1957 at Torrelavega in Spain, but emigrated early in life with his family to Argentina. In 1975 he entered the seminary at La Plata, where he remained for three years. In October 1978 he entered the Society of St. Pius X's International Seminary of Saint Pius X at Écône in Switzerland.\n\nIn August 1980 he was ordained a priest by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre in Buenos Aires. After ordination he served first as a professor at the SSPX seminary in La Reja, Argentina. From 1985 to 1988 he was superior of the SSPX district of South America.\n\nIn June 1988 Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre announced his intention to consecrate de Galarreta and three other priests (Bernard Fellay, Bernard Tissier de Mallerais, and Richard Williamson) as bishops. Lefebvre did not have a pontifical mandate for these consecrations (i.e. permission from the pope), normally required by Canon 1382 of the Code of Canon Law. On June 17, 1988 Cardinal Bernardin Gantin, prefect of the Congregation for Bishops sent the four priests a formal canonical warning that he would automatically incur the penalty of excommunication if they were to be consecrated by Lefebvre without papal permission.\n\nOn June 30, 1988 de Galaretta and the three other priests were consecrated bishop by Archbishop Lefebvre and Bishop Antônio de Castro Mayer. On July 1, 1988 Cardinal Gantin issued a declaration stating that Lefebvre, de Castro Mayer, de Galaretta, and the three other newly-ordained bishops \"have incurred \"ipso facto\" the excommunication \"latae sententiae\" reserved to the Apostolic See\".\n\nOn July 2, 1988, Pope John Paul II issued the \"motu proprio\" \"Ecclesia Dei\", in which he reaffirmed the excommunication, and described the consecration as an act of \"disobedience to the Roman pontiff in a very grave matter and of supreme importance for the unity of the Church\", and that \"such disobedience — which implies in practice the rejection of the Roman primacy — constitutes a schismatic act\".\nCardinal Darío Castrillón Hoyos, head of the commission responsible for implementing \"Ecclesia Dei\", has said this resulted in a \"situation of separation, even if it was not a formal schism.\"\n\nThe SSPX denied the validity of the excommunications, saying that the consecrations were necessary due to a moral and theological crisis in the Catholic Church.\n\nFollowing his episcopal consecration Galarreta was appointed rector of the seminary of La Reja. In 1991, he assisted in the consecration of Licínio Rangel as bishop for the Priestly society of saint John Mary Vianney after the death of its founder, bishop Antônio de Castro Mayer.\n\nIn 1994 he became superior of the Society of Saint Pius X district of Spain and Portugal. In 2002 he became second assistant of the Society.\n\nBy a decree of 21 January 2009 (protocol number 126/2009), which was issued in response to a renewed request that Bishop Fellay made on behalf of all four bishops whom Lefebvre had consecrated on 30 June 1988, the prefect of the Congregation for bishops, by the power expressly granted to him by pope Benedict XVI, remitted the automatic excommunication that they had thereby incurred, and expressed the wish that this would be followed speedily by full communion of the whole of the Society of saint Pius X with the Church, thus bearing witness, by the proof of visible unity, to true loyalty and true recognition of the pope's magisterium and authority.\n\nThe canonical situation of the four bishops thus supposedly became the same as that of the other clergy of the Society, who are suspended \"a divinis\".\n\nIt was reported that bishop Galaretta had been named chairman of the SSPX commission in charge of the theological discussions with the Holy See.\n\n"}
{"id": "405374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=405374", "title": "Ali", "text": "Ali\n\nAli ( , ; 15 September 601 – 29 January 661) was the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, the last prophet of Islam. He ruled as the fourth caliph from 656 to 661, but is regarded as the rightful immediate successor to Muhammad as an Imam by Shia Muslims.\n\nBorn to Abu Talib and Fatimah bint Asad, Ali is the only person to be born in the sacred sanctuary of the Kaaba in Mecca, the holiest place in Islam. Ali was the first male who accepted Islam, and, according to some authors, the first Muslim. Ali protected Muhammad from an early age and took part in almost all the battles fought by the nascent Muslim community. After migrating to Medina, he married Muhammad's daughter Fatimah. He was appointed caliph by Muhammad's companions in 656, after Caliph Uthman ibn Affan was assassinated. Ali's reign saw civil wars and in 661, he was attacked and assassinated by a Kharijite while praying in the Great Mosque of Kufa, being martyred two days later.\n\nAli is important to both Shias and Sunnis, politically and spiritually. The numerous biographical sources about Ali are often biased according to sectarian lines, but they agree that he was a pious Muslim, devoted to the cause of Islam and a just ruler in accordance with the Qur'an and the Sunnah. While Sunnis consider Ali the fourth and final of the \"Rashidun\" (rightly guided) caliphs, Shia Muslims regard Ali as the first Imam after Muhammad due to their interpretation of the events at Ghadir Khumm. Shia Muslims also believe that Ali and the other Shia Imams (all of whom are members of the \"Ahl al-Bayt\") are the rightful successors to Muhammad. It was this disagreement that split the \"ummah\" into the Shia and Sunni branches.\n\nAli's father, Abu Talib, was the custodian of the Ka'bah and a sheikh () of Banu Hashim, an important branch of the powerful Quraysh tribe. He was also an uncle of Muhammad, and had raised Muhammad after Abdul Muttalib (Abu Talib's father and Muhammad's grandfather) died. Ali's mother, Fatima bint Asad, also belonged to Banu Hashim, making Ali a descendant of Ismā'īl (, Ishmael) the son of Ibrāhīm (, Abraham). Many sources, especially Shi'i ones, attest that Ali was born inside the Kaaba in the city of Mecca, where he stayed with his mother for three days. His mother reportedly felt the beginning of her labour pain while visiting the Ka'ba and entered it where her son was born. Some Shia sources contain miraculous descriptions of the entrance of Ali's mother into Ka'ba. Ali's birth in Ka'ba is regarded as a unique event proving his \"high spiritual station\" among Shia, while among various Sunni scholars it is considered a great, if not unique, distinction.\n\nAccording to a tradition, Muhammad was the first person whom Ali saw as he took the newborn in his hands. Muhammad named him Ali, meaning \"the exalted one\". Muhammad had a close relationship with Ali's parents. When Muhammad was orphaned and later lost his grandfather Abdul Muttalib, Ali's father took him into his house. Ali was born two or three years after Muhammad married Khadijah bint Khuwaylid. When Ali was five years old, Muhammad took Ali into his home to raise him. Some historians say that this was because there was a famine in Mecca at the time and that Ali's father had a large family to support; however, others point out that feeding Ali would not have been a burden on his father, as Ali was five years old at the time and, despite the famine, Ali's father, who was financially well-off, was known for giving food to strangers if they were hungry. While it is not disputed that Muhammad raised Ali, it was not due to any financial stress that Ali's father was going through.\n\nAli had been living with Muhammad and Muhammad's wife Khadija since he was five years old. When Ali was nine, Muhammad announced himself as the Prophet of Islam, and Ali became the first child to accept Islam. He was the second person, after Khadija, to accept Islam. According to Sayed Ali Asgher Razwy in \"A Restatement of the History of Islam & Muslims,\" \"Ali and Qur'an 'grew up' together as 'twins' in the house of Muhammad Mustafa and Khadija-tul-Kubra.\"\n\nThe second period of Ali's life began in 610 when he declared Islam at the age of 9, and ended with the Hijra of Muhammad to Medina in 622. When Muhammad reported that he had received a divine revelation, Ali, then only about nine years old, believed him and professed to Islam. Ali became the first male to embrace Islam. Shia doctrine asserts that in keeping with Ali's divine mission, he accepted Islam before he took part in any pre-Islamic Meccan traditional religion rites, regarded by Muslims as polytheistic (see shirk) or paganistic. Hence the Shia say of Ali that his face is honoured, as it was never sullied by prostrations before idols. The Sunnis also use the honorific \"Karam Allahu Wajhahu\", which means \"God's Favour upon his Face.\" The reason his acceptance is often not called a conversion is because he was never an idol worshipper like the people of Mecca. He was known to have broken idols in the mould of Abraham and asked people why they worshipped something they made themselves. Ali's grandfather, along with some members of the Bani Hashim clan, were \"Hanifs\", or followers of a monotheistic belief system prior to the coming of Islam.\n\nMuhammad invited people to Islam in secret for three years before he started inviting them publicly. In the fourth year of Islam, when Muhammad was commanded to invite his closer relatives to come to Islam he gathered the Banu Hashim clan in a ceremony. At the banquet, he was about to invite them to Islam when Abu Lahab interrupted him, after which everyone left the banquet. The Prophet ordered Ali to invite the 40 people again. The second time, Muhammad announced Islam to them and invited them to join. He said to them,\n\nAli was the only one to answer Muhammad's call. Muhammad told him to sit down, saying, \"Wait! Perhaps someone older than you might respond to my call.\" Muhammad then asked the members of Banu Hashim a second time. Once again, Ali was the only one to respond, and again, Muhammad told him to wait. Muhammad then asked the members of Banu Hashim a third time. Ali was still the only volunteer. This time, Ali's offer was accepted by Muhammad. Muhammad \"drew [Ali] close, pressed him to his heart, and said to the assembly: 'This is my wazir, my successor and my vicegerent. Listen to him and obey his commands.'\" In another narration, when Muhammad accepted Ali's eager offer, Muhammad \"threw up his arms around the generous youth, and pressed him to his bosom\" and said, \"Behold my brother, my vizir, my vicegerent...Let all listen to his words, and obey him.\" Upon hearing this, the sons of Abd al-Muttalib departed from the feast, mocking Muhammad's words, as they scoffed at Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib, \"He has ordered you to listen and obey your son!\".. In Tarikh ut-Tabari and as-Seerat ul Halabiyya, it has been recorded that Abu Talib asks his son Ali, \"What is this belief you are following?\" to which Ali replies, \"Father, I have believed in Allah and His Messenger, and have given credence to him, kept to him, and followed him.\"\n\nSir Richard Burton writes about the banquet in his 1898 book, saying, \"It won for [Muhammad] a proselyte worth a thousand sabers in the person of Ali, son of Abu Talib.\"\n\nDuring the persecution of Muslims and boycott of the Banu Hashim in Mecca, Ali stood firmly in support of Muhammad.\n\nIn 622, the year of Muhammad's migration to Yathrib (now Medina), Ali risked his life by sleeping in Muhammad's bed to impersonate him and thwart an assassination plot on Muhammad so that Muhammad could escape in safety. This night is called \"Laylat al-Mabit\". According to some \"ahadith\", a verse was revealed about Ali concerning his sacrifice on the night of Hijra which says \"And among men is he who sells his \"nafs\" (self) in exchange for the pleasure of Allah.\"\n\nAli survived the plot, but risked his life again by staying in Mecca to carry out Muhammad's instructions: to restore to their owners all the goods and properties that had been entrusted to Muhammad for safekeeping. 'Ali then went to Medina with Fatimah bint Asad (his mother), Fatimah bint Muhammad (Muhammad's daughter), and two other women.\n\nAli was 22 or 23 years old when he migrated to Medina. When Muhammad was creating bonds of brotherhood among his companions, he selected Ali as his brother, claiming that \"Ali and I belong to the same tree, while people belong to different trees.”. For the ten years that Muhammad led the community in Medina, Ali was extremely active in his service as his secretary and deputy, serving in his armies, the bearer of his banner in every battle, leading parties of warriors on raids, and carrying messages and orders. As one of Muhammad's lieutenants, and later his son-in-law, Ali was a person of authority and standing in the Muslim community.\n\nIn 623, Muhammad told 'Ali that God ordered him to give his daughter Fatimah Zahra to Ali in marriage. Muhammad said to Fatimah: \"I have married you to the dearest of my family to me.\" This family is glorified by Muhammad frequently and he declared them as his \"Ahl al-Bayt\" in events such as Mubahala and hadith like the Hadith of the Event of the Cloak. They were also glorified in the Qur'an in several cases such as \"the verse of purification\".\n\nAli had four children born to Fatimah, the only child of Muhammad to have surviving progeny. Their two sons (Hasan and Husain) were cited by Muhammad to be his own sons, honoured numerous times in his lifetime and titled \"the leaders of the youth of Jannah\" (Heaven, the hereafter.) Ali and Fatimah also had a third son, Muhsin; however, he died as a result of a miscarriage when Ali and Fatimah were attacked after Muhammad's death. Fatimah died shortly after the attack as well.\n\nAt the beginning they were extremely poor. Ali would often help Fatimah with the household affairs. According to some sources, Ali performed the work outside the house and Fatimah performed the work inside the house, a setup that Muhammad had determined. When the economic situations of the Muslims became better, Fatimah gained some maids but treated them like her family and performed the house duties with them.\n\nTheir marriage lasted until Fatimah's death ten years later and was said to be full of love and friendliness. Ali is reported to have said about Fatimah, \"By Allah, I did never anger her or force her to do something (unwillingly) until Allah took her to the better world. She also did never anger me nor did she disobey me in anything at all. When I looked at her, my griefs and sorrows were relieved.\" Although polygamy was permitted, Ali did not marry another woman while Fatimah was alive, and his marriage to her possesses a special spiritual significance for all Muslims because it is seen as the marriage between two great figures surrounding Muhammad. After Fatimah's death, Ali married other women and fathered many children.\n\nWith the exception of the Battle of Tabouk, Ali took part in all battles and expeditions fought for Islam. As well as being the standard-bearer in those battles, Ali led parties of warriors on raids into enemy lands.\n\nAli first distinguished himself as a warrior in 624 at the Battle of Badr. The battle began with Ali defeating the Meccan champion Walid ibn Utba; one historian described Ali's opening victory at the battle as \"the signal of the triumph of Islam.\" Ali also defeated many other Meccan soldiers in the battle. According to Muslim traditions Ali killed between twenty and thirty-five enemies in battle, most agreeing with twenty-seven; while all the other Muslims combined killed another twenty-seven.\n\nAli was prominent at the Battle of Uhud, as well as many other battles where he wielded a bifurcated sword known as Zulfiqar. He had the special role of protecting Muhammad when most of the Muslim army fled from the battle of Uhud and it was said \"There is no brave youth except Ali and there is no sword which renders service except Zulfiqar.\" He was commander of the Muslim army in the Battle of the Trench where he defeated the legendary Arab warrior, Amr ibn Abd al-Wud.. Muhammad made Ali commander at this battle, claiming that “I will hand the standard to a man who loves Allah and His Messenger and is loved by Allah and His Messenger. He will come back with conquest.\" Following this battle Muhammad gave Ali the name \"Asadullâh\" (), which means \"Lion of God\" and reportedly praised him, saying “Ali’s strike on Amr ibn Abd al-Wud is greater than the worship of both mankind and jinn until the Day of Judgement.” Ali also defended Muhammad in the Battle of Hunayn in 630.\n\nMuhammad designated 'Ali as one of the scribes who would write down the text of the Quran, which had been revealed to Muhammad during the previous two decades. As Islam began to spread throughout Arabia, Ali helped establish the new Islamic order. He was instructed to write down the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, the peace treaty between Muhammad and the Quraysh in 628. Ali was so reliable and trustworthy that Muhammad asked him to carry the messages and declare the orders. In 630, Ali recited to a large gathering of pilgrims in Mecca a portion of the Quran that declared Muhammad and the Islamic community were no longer bound by agreements made earlier with Arab polytheists. During the Conquest of Mecca in 630, Muhammad asked Ali to guarantee that the conquest would be bloodless. He ordered Ali to break all the idols worshipped by the Banu Aus, Banu Khazraj, Tayy, and those in the Ka'bah to purify it after its defilement by the polytheism of the pre-Islamic era. Ali was sent to Yemen one year later to spread the teachings of Islam. He was also charged with settling several disputes and putting down the uprisings of various tribes.\n\nAccording to hadith collections, in 631, an Arab Christian envoy from Najran (currently in northern Yemen and partly in Saudi Arabia) came to Muhammad to argue which of the two parties erred in its doctrine concerning Jesus. After likening Jesus' miraculous birth to Adam's creation, Muhammad called them to \"mubahala\" (conversation), where each party should bring their knowledgeable men, women and children, and ask God to curse the lying party and their followers. Muhammad, to prove to them that he was a prophet, brought his daughter Fatimah, 'Ali and his grandchildren Hasan and Husayn. He went to the Christians and said \"this is my family\" and covered himself and his family with a cloak. According to Muslim sources, when one of the Christian monks saw their faces, he advised his companions to withdraw from Mubahala for the sake of their lives and families. Thus the Christian monks vanished from the Mubahala place. Allameh Tabatabaei explains in \"Tafsir al-Mizan\" that the word \"Our selves\" in this verse refers to Muhammad and Ali. Then he narrates that Imam Ali al-Rida, eighth Shia Imam, in discussion with Al-Ma'mun, Abbasid caliph, referred to this verse to prove the superiority of Muhammad's progeny over the rest of the Muslim community, and considered it the proof for Ali's right for caliphate due to God having made Ali like the self of Muhammad. SO,\n\nAs Muhammad was returning from his last pilgrimage in 632, he made statements about Ali that are interpreted very differently by Sunnis and Shias. He halted the caravan at Ghadir Khumm, gathered the returning pilgrims for communal prayer and began to address them.\n\nAccording to Encyclopedia of Islam:\n\nShias regard these statements as constituting the designation of Ali as the successor of Muhammad and as the first Imam; by contrast, Sunnis take them only as an expression of close spiritual relationship between Muhammad and Ali, and of his wish that Ali, as his cousin and son-in-law, inherit his family responsibilities upon his death, but not necessarily a designation of political authority. \n\nBoth Shia and Sunni sources state that, after the sermon, Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman who pledged allegiance to Ali.\n\nAnother part of Ali's life started in 632, after the death of Muhammad and lasted until the assassination of 'Uthman ibn 'Affan, the third caliph in 656. During those 24 years, Ali neither took part in any battle or conquest, nor did he assume any executive position. He withdrew from political affairs, especially after the death of his wife, Fatimah Zahra. He used his time to serve his family and worked as a farmer. Ali dug a lot of wells and planted gardens near Medina and endowed them for public use. These wells are known today as \"Abar Ali\" (\"Ali's wells\").\n\nAli compiled a complete version of the Quran, \"mus'haf\", six months after the death of Muhammad. The volume was completed and carried by camel to show to other people of Medina. The order of this \"mus'haf\" differed from that which was gathered later during the Uthmanic era. This book was rejected by several people when he showed it to them. Despite this, Ali made no resistance against \"standardised mus'haf\".\n\nAfter uniting the Arabian tribes into a single Muslim religious polity in the last years of his life, Muhammad's death in 632 signalled disagreement over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. While Ali and the rest of Muhammad's close family were washing his body for burial, at a gathering attended by a small group of Muslims at Saqifah, a close companion of Muhammad named Abu Bakr was nominated for the leadership of the community. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first caliph. The choice of Abu Bakr was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that Ali had been designated his successor by Muhammad himself.\n\nLater when Fatimah and Ali sought aid from the Companions in the matter of his right to the caliphate, they answered 'O daughter of the Messenger of God! We have given our allegiance to Abu Bakr. If Ali had come to us before this, we would certainly not have abandoned him'. Ali said, 'Was it fitting that we should wrangle over the caliphate even before the Prophet was buried?'\n\nFollowing his election to the caliphate, Abu Bakr and Umar with a few other companions headed to Fatimah's house to force Ali and his supporters who had gathered there to give their allegiance to Abu Bakr. Then, it is alleged that Umar threatened to set the house on fire unless they came out and swore allegiance to Abu Bakr. Fatimah, in support of her husband, started a commotion and threatened to \"uncover her hair\", at which Abu Bakr relented and withdrew. Ali is reported to have repeatedly said that had there been forty men with him he would have resisted. Ali did not actively assert his own right because he did not want to throw the nascent Muslim community into strife. Other sources say that Ali accepted the selection of Umar as caliph and even gave one of his daughters, Umm Kulthūm, to him in marriage.\nThis contentious issue caused Muslims to later split into two groups, Sunni and Shia. Sunnis assert that even though Muhammad never appointed a successor, Abu Bakr was elected first caliph by the Muslim community. The Sunnis recognise the first four caliphs as Muhammad's rightful successors. Shias believe that Muhammad explicitly named Ali as his successor at Ghadir Khumm and Muslim leadership belonged to him which had been determined by divine order.\n\nAccording to Wilferd Madelung, Ali himself was firmly convinced of his legitimacy for caliphate based on his close kinship with Muhammad, his intimate association and his knowledge of Islam and his merits in serving its cause. He told Abu Bakr that his delay in pledging allegiance (\"bay'ah\") as caliph was based on his belief of his own prior title. Ali did not change his mind when he finally pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr and then to Umar and to Uthman but had done so for the sake of the unity of Islam, at a time when it was clear that the Muslims had turned away from him. Ali also believed that he could fulfill his role of Imam'ate without this fighting.\nAt the beginning of Abu Bakr's caliphate, there was a controversy about Muhammad's endowment to his daughter, especially Fadak, between Fatimah and Ali on one side and Abu Bakr on the other side. Fatimah asked Abu Bakr to turn over their property, the lands of Fadak and Khaybar. But Abu Bakr refused and told her that prophets did not have any legacy and that Fadak belonged to the Muslim community. Abu Bakr said to her, \"Allah's Apostle said, we do not have heirs, whatever we leave is Sadaqa.\" Together with Umm Ayman, Ali testified to the fact that Muhammad granted it to Fatimah Zahra, when Abu Bakr requested her to summon witnesses for her claim. Fatimah became angry and stopped speaking to Abu Bakr, and continued assuming that attitude until she died.\n'Aishah also said that \"When Allah's Apostle died, his wives intended to send 'Uthman to Abu Bakr asking him for their share of the inheritance.\" Then 'Aisha said to them, \"Didn't Allah's Apostle say, 'Our (Apostles') property is not to be inherited, and whatever we leave is to be spent in charity?'\".\n\nAccording to some sources, 'Ali did not give his oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr until some time after the death of his wife, Fatimah in the year 633. 'Ali participated in the funeral of Abu Bakr.\n\nHe pledged allegiance to the second caliph 'Umar ibn Khattab and helped him as a trusted advisor. 'Umar particularly relied upon Ali as the chief judge of Medina. He also advised Umar to set Hijra as the beginning of the Islamic calendar. 'Umar used 'Ali's suggestions in political issues as well as religious ones.\n\n'Ali was one of the electoral council to choose the third caliph which was appointed by 'Umar. Although 'Ali was one of the two major candidates, the council's arrangement was against him. Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas and Abdur Rahman bin Awf, who were cousins, were naturally inclined to support Uthman, who was Abdur Rahman's brother-in-law. In addition, Umar gave the casting vote to Abdur Rahman. Abdur Rahman offered the caliphate to Ali on the condition that he should rule in accordance with the Quran, the example set by Muhammad, and the precedents established by the first two caliphs. Ali rejected the third condition while Uthman accepted it. According to Ibn Abi al-Hadid's Comments on the Peak of Eloquence Ali insisted on his prominence there, but most of the electors supported Uthman and Ali was reluctantly urged to accept him.\n\n'Uthman ibn 'Affan expressed generosity toward his kin, Banu Abd-Shams, who seemed to dominate him, and his supposed arrogant mistreatment toward several of the earliest companions such as Abu Dharr al-Ghifari, Abd-Allah ibn Mas'ud and Ammar ibn Yasir provoked outrage among some groups of people. Dissatisfaction and resistance openly arose since 650–651 throughout most of the empire. The dissatisfaction with his rule and the governments appointed by him was not restricted to the provinces outside Arabia. When Uthman's kin, especially Marwan, gained control over him, the noble companions, including most of the members of elector council, turned against him or at least withdrew their support, putting pressure on the caliph to mend his ways and reduce the influence of his assertive kin.\n\nAt this time, 'Ali had acted as a restraining influence on Uthman without directly opposing him. On several occasions Ali disagreed with Uthman in the application of the Hudud; he had publicly shown sympathy for Abu Dharr al-Ghifari and had spoken strongly in the defence of Ammar ibn Yasir. He conveyed to Uthman the criticisms of other Companions and acted on Uthman's behalf as negotiator with the provincial opposition who had come to Medina; because of this some mistrust between Ali and Uthman's family seems to have arisen. Finally, he tried to mitigate the severity of the siege by his insistence that Uthman should be allowed water.\n\nThere is controversy among historians about the relationship between Ali and Uthman. Although pledging allegiance to Uthman, Ali disagreed with some of his policies. In particular, he clashed with Uthman on the question of religious law. He insisted that religious punishment had to be done in several cases such as Ubayd Allah ibn Umar and Walid ibn Uqba. In 650 during pilgrimage, he confronted Uthman with reproaches for his change of the prayer ritual. When Uthman declared that he would take whatever he needed from the fey', Ali exclaimed that in that case the caliph would be prevented by force. Ali endeavoured to protect companions from maltreatment by the caliph such as Ibn Mas'ud. Therefore, some historians consider Ali one of the leading members of Uthman's opposition, if not the main one. But Wilferd Madelung rejects their judgment due to the fact that Ali did not have the Quraysh's support to be elected as a caliph. According to him, there is even no evidence that Ali had close relations with rebels who supported his caliphate or directed their actions.\nNo one [among the Islamic nobility] was more temperate toward our master than your master.\n\n'Ali was caliph between 656 and 661, during one of the most turbulent periods in Muslim history, which also coincided with the First Fitnah. Since the conflicts in which Ali was involved were perpetuated in polemical sectarian historiography, biographical material is often biased. But the sources agree that he was a profoundly religious man, devoted to the cause of Islam and the rule of justice in accordance with the Qur'an and the Sunnah; he engaged in war against erring Muslims as a matter of religious duty. The sources abound in notices on his austerity, rigorous observance of religious duties, and detachment from worldly goods. Thus some authors have pointed out that he lacked political skill and flexibility.\n\nUthman's assassination meant that rebels had to select a new caliph. This met with difficulties since the rebels were divided into several groups comprising the \"Muhajirun\", \"Ansar\", Egyptians, Kufans and Basrites. There were three candidates: Ali, Talhah and Al-Zubayr. First the rebels approached Ali, requesting him to accept being the fourth caliph. Some of Muhammad's companions tried to persuade Ali to accept the office, but he turned down the offer, suggesting to be a counsellor instead of a chief.\nTalhah, Zubayr and other companions also refused the rebels' offer of the caliphate. Therefore, the rebels warned the inhabitants of Medina to select a caliph within one day, or they would apply drastic action. In order to resolve the deadlock, the Muslims gathered in \"Al-Masjid an-Nabawi\" (, \"The Masjid of the Prophet\") on June 18, 656, to appoint the caliph. Initially, 'Ali refused to accept it, simply because his most vigorous supporters were rebels. However, when some notable companions of Muhammad, in addition to the residents of Medina, urged him to accept the offer, he finally agreed. According to Abu Mekhnaf's narration, Talhah was the first prominent companion who gave his pledge to 'Ali, but other narrations claimed otherwise, stating they were forced to give their pledge. Also, Talhah and Az-Zubayr later claimed they supported him reluctantly. Regardless, Ali refuted these claims, insisting they recognised him as caliph voluntarily. Wilferd Madelung believes that force did not urge people to give their pledge and they pledged publicly in the mosque. While the overwhelming majority of Medina's population as well as many of the rebels gave their pledge, some important figures or tribes did not do so. The Umayyads, kinsmen of Uthman, fled to the Levant, or remained in their houses, later refusing 'Ali's legitimacy. Sa'ad ibn Abi Waqqas was absent and 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar abstained from offering his allegiance, but both of them assured 'Ali that they would not act against him.\n\nAli thus inherited the Rashidun caliphate — which extended from Egypt in the west to the Iranian highlands in the east—while the situation in the Hejaz and the other provinces on the eve of his election was unsettled. Soon after Ali became caliph, he dismissed provincial governors who had been appointed by Uthman, replacing them with trusted aides. He acted against the counsel of Mughira ibn Shu'ba and Ibn 'Abbas, who had advised him to proceed with his governing cautiously. Madelung says Ali was deeply convinced of his right and his religious mission, unwilling to compromise his principles for the sake of political expediency, and ready to fight against overwhelming odds. Muawiyah I, the kinsman of Uthman and governor of the Levant, refused to submit to Ali's orders; he was the only governor to do so.\n\nWhen he was appointed caliph, Ali stated to the citizens of Medina that Muslim polity had come to be plagued by dissension and discord; he desired to purge Islam of any evil. He advised the populace to behave as true Muslims, warning that he would tolerate no sedition and those who were found guilty of subversive activities would be dealt with harshly.\n\nA'ishah, Talhah, Al-Zubayr and the Umayyads, especially Muawiyah I and Marwan I, wanted 'Ali to punish the rioters who had killed Uthman. They encamped close to Basra. The talks lasted for many days and the subsequent heated exchange and protests during the parley turned from words to blows, leading to loss of life on both sides. In the confusion the Battle of the Camel started in 656, where Ali emerged victorious.\nSome historians believe that they used this issue to seek their political ambitions because they found Ali's caliphate against their own benefit. The rebels maintained that Uthman had been justly killed, for not governing according to Quran and Sunnah, hence no vengeance was to be invoked. \nSome say the caliphate was a gift of the rebels and Ali did not have enough force to control or punish them, while others say Ali accepted the rebels' argument or at least did not consider Uthman a just ruler. Ali himself writes in his famous work, Nahj al-Balagha, that he was blamed by the Umayyads for the assassination of Uthman.The Umayyads knowledge of me did not restrain them from accusing me, nor did my precedence in accepting Islam keep these ignorant people from blaming me. Allah's admonitions are more eloquent than my tongue. I am the contester against those who break away from Faith and the opposer of those who entertain doubts. Uncertainties should be placed before Qur'an, the Book of Allah (for clarification). Certainly, people will be recompensed according to what they have in their hearts. - \"Nahj al-Balagha: Sermon 75\"Under such circumstances, a schism took place which led to the first civil war in Muslim history. Some Muslims, known as Uthmanis, considered Uthman a rightful and just caliph till the end, who had been unlawfully killed. Some others, who are known as party of Ali, believed Uthman had fallen into error, he had forfeited the caliphate and been lawfully executed for his refusal to mend his ways or step down; thus Ali was the just and true Imam and his opponents are infidels. This was not the position of Ali himself. This civil war created permanent divisions within the Muslim community regarding who had the legitimate right to occupy the caliphate.\nThe First Fitna, 656–661, followed the assassination of Uthman, continued during the caliphate of Ali, and was ended by Muawiyah's assumption of the caliphate. This civil war (often called the \"Fitna\") is regretted as the end of the early unity of the Islamic ummah (nation).\n\nAli appointed 'Abd Allah ibn al'-Abbas governor of Basra and moved his capital to Kufa, the Muslim garrison city in Iraq. Following the Roman-Persian Wars and the Byzantine–Sasanian wars that lasted for hundreds of years, there were deep rooted differences between Iraq, formally under the Persian Sassanid Empire and Syria formally under the Byzantine Empire. The Iraqis wanted the capital of the newly established Islamic State to be in Kufa so as to bring revenues into their area and oppose Syria. They convinced Ali to come to Kufa and establish the capital in Kufa, in Iraq.\n\nLater Muawiyah I, the governor of Levant and the cousin of Uthman, refused Ali's demands for allegiance. Ali opened negotiations hoping to regain his allegiance, but Muawiyah insisted on Levant autonomy under his rule. Muawiyah replied by mobilising his Levantine supporters and refusing to pay homage to Ali on the pretext that his contingent had not participated in his election. Ali then moved his armies north and the two armies encamped themselves at Siffin for more than one hundred days, most of the time being spent in negotiations. Although Ali exchanged several letters with Muawiyah, he was unable to dismiss the latter, nor persuade him to pledge allegiance. Skirmishes between the parties led to the Battle of Siffin in 657.\n\nAfter a week of combat was followed by a violent battle known as \"laylat al-harir\" (the night of clamour), Muawiyah's army was on the point of being routed when Amr ibn al-Aas advised Muawiyah to have his soldiers hoist \"mus'haf\" (either parchments inscribed with verses of the Quran, or complete copies of it) on their spearheads in order to cause disagreement and confusion in Ali's army. Ali saw through the stratagem, but only a minority wanted to pursue the fight.\nThe two armies finally agreed to settle the matter of who should be caliph by arbitration. The refusal of the largest bloc in Ali's army to fight was the decisive factor in his acceptance of the arbitration. The question as to whether the arbiter would represent Ali or the Kufans caused a further split in Ali's army. Ash'ath ibn Qays and some others rejected Ali's nominees, 'Abd Allah ibn 'Abbas and Malik al-Ashtar, and insisted on Abu Musa Ash'ari, for his neutrality. Finally, Ali was urged to accept Abu Musa. Amr ibn al-As was appointed by Muawiyah as an arbitrator. Seven months later the two arbitrators met at Adhruh about 10 miles north west of Maan in Jordan in February 658. Amr ibn al-As convinced Abu Musa Ash'ari that both Ali and Muawiyah should step down and a new caliph be elected. Ali and his supporters were stunned by the decision which had lowered the caliph to the status of the rebellious Muawiyah. Ali was therefore outwitted by Muawiyah and Amr ibn al-As.\nWhen the arbitrators assembled at Daumet-ul-Jandal, a series of daily meetings were arranged for them to discuss the matters in hand. When the time arrived for taking a decision about the caliphate, Amr bin al-A'as convinced Abu Musa al-Ashari into entertaining the opinion that they should deprive both Ali and Muawiya of the caliphate, and give to the Muslims the right to elect the caliph. Abu Musa al-Ashari also decided to act accordingly. According to Poonawala, it seems that the arbiters and other eminent persons, with the exclusion of Ali's representatives, met in January 659 to discuss the selection of the new caliph. Amr supported Muawiyah, while Abu Musa preferred his son-in-law, Abdullah ibn Umar, but the latter refused to stand for election in default of unanimity. Abu Musa then proposed, and Amr agreed, to depose both Ali and Muawiyah and submit the selection of the new caliph to a Shura. In the public declaration that followed Abu Musa observed his part of the agreement, but Amr declared Ali deposed and confirmed Muawiya as caliph.\n\nAli refused to accept the verdict of him stepping down and for an election to be held and found himself technically in breach of his pledge to abide by the arbitration. 'Ali protested, stating that it was contrary to the Qur'an and the Sunnah and hence not binding. Then he tried to organise a new army, but only the Ansar, the remnants of the Qurra led by Malik Ashtar, and a few of their clansmen remained loyal. This put Ali in a weak position even amongst his own supporters. The arbitration resulted in the dissolution of 'Ali's coalition, and some have opined that this was Muawiyah's intention.\n\nThe most vociferous opponents in Ali's camp were the very same people who had forced Ali into the ceasefire. They broke away from Ali's force, rallying under the slogan \"arbitration belongs to God alone.\" This group came to be known as the Kharijites (\"those who leave\"). They considered everyone to be their enemy. In 659 Ali's forces and the Kharijites met in the Battle of Nahrawan. The Qurra then became known as the Kharijites. The Kharijites then started killing Ali's supporters and other Muslims. They considered anyone who was not part of their group as an unbeliever. Although 'Ali won the battle by a huge margin, the constant conflict had begun to affect his standing. While dealing with the Iraqis, 'Ali found it hard to build a disciplined army and effective state institutions. He also spent a lot of time fighting the Kharijites. As a result, 'Ali found it hard to expand the state on its eastern front.\n\nAt about the same time, unrest was brewing in Egypt. The governor of Egypt, Qais, was recalled, and Ali had him replaced with Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr (the brother of Aisha and the son of Islam's first caliph Abu Bakr). Muawiyah allowed 'Amr ibn al-'As to conquer Egypt and 'Amr did so successfully. Amr had first taken Egypt eighteen years earlier from the Romans but had been dismissed by Uthman. Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr had no popular support in Egypt and managed to get together 2000 men but they dispersed without a fight.\n\nIn the following years, Muawiyah's army occupied many cities of Iraq, which Ali's governors could not prevent, and people did not support him to fight with them. Muawiyah overpowered Egypt, Hijaz, Yemen and other areas. In the last year of Ali's caliphate, the mood in Kufa and Basra changed in his favour as the people became disillusioned with Muawiyah's reign and policies. However, the people's attitude toward Ali differed deeply. Just a small minority of them believed that Ali was the best Muslim after Muhammad and the only one entitled to rule them, while the majority supported him due to their distrust and opposition to Muawiyah.\nAli is said to have vowed and forewarned of an uncompromising campaign against financial corruption and unfair privileges in the ranks of the caliphate after he was pressed by the public to succeed the caliphate following the death of Uthman. Shias argue that his determination in pushing these reforms despite their unpopularity with the elite have been the cause of hostilities from the rich and the privileged former companions of the Prophet. In a famous letter to one of his governors, Malik Ashtar, he articulates his pro-poor anti-elitist approach:\nRemember that displeasure and disapproval of common men, have-nots and depressed persons more than overbalances the approval of important persons and displeasure of a few big will be excused by the Lord if the general public and masses of your subjects are happy with you. The common men, the poor, apparently less important sections of your subjects are the pillars of Islam….be more friendly with them and secure their confidence and sympathy.\n'Ali recovered the land granted by 'Uthman and swore to recover anything that elites had acquired before his election. Ali opposed the centralisation of capital control over provincial revenues, favouring an equal distribution of taxes and booty amongst the Muslim citizens; he distributed the entire revenue of the treasury among them. 'Ali refrained from nepotism, including with his brother 'Aqeel ibn Abu Talib. This was an indication to Muslims of his policy of offering equality to Muslims who served Islam in its early years and to the Muslims who played a role in the later conquests.\n\nAli succeeded in forming a broad coalition, especially after the Battle of the Camel. His policy of equal distribution of taxes and booty gained the support of Muhammad's companions, especially the Ansar who were subordinated by the Quraysh leadership after Muhammad, the traditional tribal leaders, and the Qurra or Qur'anic reciters that sought pious Islamic leadership. The successful formation of this diverse coalition seems to be due to Ali's charismatic character. This diverse coalition became known as \"Shi'a Ali\", meaning \"party\" or \"faction of Ali\". However, according to Shia, as well as non-Shia reports, the majority of those who supported 'Ali after his election as caliph, were shia politically, not religiously. Although at this time there were many who were counted as political Shia, few of them believed Ali's religious leadership.\n\nHis policies and ideas of governing are manifested in the letter he sent to Malik al-Ashtar after appointing him governor of Egypt. This instruction, which has historically been viewed as the ideal constitution for Islamic governance alongside the Constitution of Medina, involved detailed description of duties and rights of the ruler and various functionaries of the state and the main classes of society at that time.\nAli wrote in his instructions to Malik al-Ashtar:\n\nSince the majority of 'Ali's subjects were nomads and peasants, he was concerned with agriculture. He instructed to Malik to give more attention to development of the land than to the collection of the tax, because tax can only be obtained by the development of the land and whoever demands tax without developing the land ruins the country and destroys the people.\n\nOn 19 Ramadan AH 40, which would correspond to 27 January 661, while praying in the Great Mosque of Kufa, Ali was attacked by the Kharijite Abd-al-Rahman ibn Muljam. He was wounded by ibn Muljam's poison-coated sword while prostrating in the Fajr prayer. 'Ali ordered his sons not to attack the Kharijites, instead stipulating that if he survived, ibn Muljam would be pardoned whereas if he died, ibn Muljam should be given only one equal hit (regardless of whether or not he died from the hit). 'Ali died two days later on 29 January 661 (21 Ramadan AH 40). Al-Hasan fulfilled Qisas and gave equal punishment to ibn Muljam upon Ali's death.\n\nAfter Ali's death, Kufi Muslims pledged allegiance to his eldest son Hasan without dispute, as Ali on many occasions had declared that just People of the House of Muhammad were entitled to rule the Muslim community.\nAt this time, Muawiyah held both the Levant and Egypt and, as commander of the largest force in the Muslim Empire, had declared himself caliph and marched his army into Iraq, the seat of Hasan's caliphate.\n\nWar ensued during which Muawiyah gradually subverted the generals and commanders of Hasan's army with large sums of money and deceiving promises until the army rebelled against him. Finally, Hasan was forced to make peace and to yield the caliphate to Muawiyah. In this way Muawiyah captured the Islamic caliphate and tuned it to a secular kingdom (Sultanate). Umayyad caliphate later became a centralised monarchy by Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan.\n\nUmayyads placed the severest pressure upon Ali's family and his Shia, in every way possible. Regular public cursing of Imam Ali in the congregational prayers remained a vital institution which was not abolished until 60 years later by Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz. \nMadelung writes:\nUmayyad highhandedness, misrule and repression were gradually to turn the minority of Ali's admirers into a majority. In the memory of later generations Ali became the ideal Commander of the Faithful. In face of the fake Umayyad claim to legitimate sovereignty in Islam as God's Vice-regents on earth, and in view of Umayyad treachery, arbitrary and divisive government, and vindictive retribution, they came to appreciate his [Ali's] honesty, his unbending devotion to the reign of Islam, his deep personal loyalties, his equal treatment of all his supporters, and his generosity in forgiving his defeated enemies.\n\nIbn Abi'l-Hadid narrates the following about the Umayyad treatment towards Ali and his followers:\n\"Everybody knows that when the Umayyads held the reins of the Islamic world, they spared no single effort for extinguishing the light of Ali and inventing ﬂaws against him. Moreover, they issued the decisions of cursing him openly from the mimbars of their mosques and sentenced to death anyone who would mention any of his incalculable merits. They also prevented people from reporting any narration that might refer to any of his accolades. Finally, they even prevented people from calling their newborns by his name.\"\n\nAccording to Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid, Ali did not want his grave to be desecrated by his enemies and consequently asked his friends and family to bury him secretly. This secret gravesite was revealed later during the Abbasid caliphate by Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, his descendant and the sixth Shia Imam. Most Shias accept that Ali is buried at the Tomb of Imam Ali in the Imam Ali Mosque at what is now the city of Najaf, which grew around the mosque and shrine called Masjid Ali.\n\nHowever another story, usually maintained by some Afghans, notes that his body was taken and buried in the Afghan city of Mazar-E-Sharif at the famous Blue Mosque or Rawze-e-Sharif.\n\nAli is respected not only as a warrior and leader, but as a writer and religious authority. A numerous range of disciplines from theology and exegesis to calligraphy and numerology, from law and mysticism to Arabic grammar and rhetoric are regarded as having been first adumbrated by Ali.\n\nAccording to a \"hadith\" which is narrated by Shia and Sufis, Muhammad told about him \"I'm the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate ...\" Muslims regard Ali as a major authority on Islam. According to the Shia, Ali himself gave this testimony:\nNot a single verse of the Quran descended upon (was revealed to) the Messenger of God which he did not proceed to dictate to me and make me recite. I would write it with my own hand, and he would instruct me as to its \"tafsir\" (the literal explanation) and the \"ta'wil\" (the spiritual exegesis), the \"nasikh\" (the verse which abrogates) and the \"mansukh\" (the abrogated verse), the \"muhkam\" and the \"mutashabih\" (the fixed and the ambiguous), the particular and the general ...It has been narrated that when Abbas was a baby, Ali placed him on his lap, kissed his hands an began to weep. He foretold the tragedy of Abbas and the inevitable fate of his hands which caused his wife, Umm ul-Banin, to also weep. However, he goes on to describe Abbas's future position and great status with God, and this relieves her.\n\nAccording to Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Ali is credited with having established Islamic theology and his quotations contain the first rational proofs among Muslims of the Unity of God. Ibn Abi al-Hadid has quoted\nAs for theosophy and dealing with matters of divinity, it was not an Arab art. Nothing of the sort had been circulated among their distinguished figures or those of lower ranks. This art was the exclusive preserve of Greece, whose sages were its only expounders. The first one among Arabs to deal with it was Ali.\n\nIn later Islamic philosophy, especially in the teachings of Mulla Sadra and his followers, like Allameh Tabatabaei, Ali's sayings and sermons were increasingly regarded as central sources of metaphysical knowledge, or divine philosophy. Members of Sadra's school regard Ali as the supreme metaphysician of Islam. According to Henry Corbin, the \"Nahj al-Balagha\" may be regarded as one of the most important sources of doctrines professed by Shia thinkers, especially after 1500. Its influence can be sensed in the logical co-ordination of terms, the deduction of correct conclusions, and the creation of certain technical terms in Arabic which entered the literary and philosophical language independently of the translation into Arabic of Greek texts.\n\nIn addition, some hidden or occult sciences such as \"jafr\", Islamic numerology, and the science of the symbolic significance of the letters of the Arabic alphabet, are said to have been established by Ali through his having studied the texts of al-Jafr and al-Jamia.\n\nAli was also a great scholar of Arabic literature and pioneered in the field of Arabic grammar and rhetoric. Numerous short sayings of Ali have become part of general Islamic culture and are quoted as aphorisms and proverbs in daily life. They have also become the basis of literary works or have been integrated into poetic verse in many languages. Already in the 8th century, literary authorities such as 'Abd al-Hamid ibn Yahya al-'Amiri pointed to the unparalleled eloquence of Ali's sermons and sayings, as did al-Jahiz in the following century. Even staffs in the Divan of Umayyad recited Ali's sermons to improve their eloquence. The most famous selection of Ali's utterances and writings has been gathered in a book called \"Nahj al-Balagha\" (\"Peak of Eloquence\") by a 10th-century Shia scholar, Al-Sharif al-Radi, who selected them for their singular rhetorical beauty.\n\nOf note among sermons quoted in the book, is the undotted sermon as well as the sermon without Aleph. According to narrations, some companions of Muhammad had gathered somewhere discussing the role of letters in speaking. They concluded that Aleph had the greatest contribution in speaking and that dotted letters were also important. Meanwhile, Ali read two long impromptu sermons, one without using Aleph letter and the other without dotted letters, containing deep and eloquent concepts, according to Langroudi, a Shia author. George Jordac, a Christian author, said that sermons without Aleph and dot had to be regarded as literary masterpiece.\n\nAli is revered for the deep sympathy and support he shown for the poor and orphans, and the egalitarian policies he pursued during his caliphate with aim of achieving social justice. He is quoted as saying:\nIf God grants wealth and prosperity to any person, he should show kindness to his deserving kith and kin, should provide for the poor, should come the assistance of those are oppressed with calamities, misfortunes and reverses, should help the poor and have-nots and should assist honest people to liquidate their loans...\n\nIt is narrated in Kitab al-Kafi that Amir al-Mu'minin Ali ibn Abi Talib was presented with honey and figs from locations near Baghdad. Upon receiving the gifts, he ordered his officers to bring the orphans so that they can lick the honey from the containers while he distributed the rest himself among the people. \n\nThe compilation of sermons, lectures and quotations attributed to Ali are compiled in the form of several books.\n\nAli initially married Fatimah, who was his most beloved wife. After she died, he got married again. He had four children with Fatimah, Hasan ibn Ali, Husayn ibn Ali, Zaynab bint Ali and Umm Kulthum bint Ali. His other well-known sons were al-Abbas ibn Ali, born to Fatima binte Hizam (Um al-Banin), and Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah. Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah was Ali's son from another wife from Hanifa clan of central Arabia named Khawlah bint Ja'far. After Fatima's death, Ali married Khawla bint Ja'far of the Bani Hanifa tribe.\n\nHasan, born in 625, was the second Shia Imam and he also occupied the outward function of caliph for about six months. In the year AH 50 he was poisoned and killed by a member of his own household who, as has been accounted by historians, had been motivated by Mu'awiyah.\n\nHusayn, born in 626, was the third Shia Imam. He lived under severe conditions of suppression and persecution by Mu'awiyah. On the tenth day of Muharram, of the year 680, he lined up before the army of the caliph with his small band of followers and nearly all of them were killed in the Battle of Karbala. The anniversary of his death is called the Day of Ashura and it is a day of mourning and religious observance for Shia Muslims. In this battle some of Ali's other sons were killed. Al-Tabari has mentioned their names in his history: Al-Abbas ibn Ali, the holder of Husayn's standard, Ja'far, Abdallah and Uthman, the four sons born to Fatima binte Hizam; Muhammad and Abu Bakr. The death of the last one is doubtful.\n\nSome historians have added the names of Ali's other sons who were killed at Karbala, including Ibrahim, Umar and Abdallah ibn al-Asqar.\n\nHis daughter Zaynab—who was in Karbala—was captured by Yazid's army and later played a great role in revealing what happened to Husayn and his followers.\n\nAli's descendants by Fatimah are known as \"sharifs\", \"sayeds\" or \"sayyids\". These are honorific titles in Arabic, \"sharif\" meaning 'noble' and \"sayed\" or \"sayyid\" meaning 'lord' or 'sir'. As Muhammad's only descendants, they are respected by both Sunni and Shia.\n\nExcept for Muhammad, there is no one in Islamic history about whom as much has been written in Islamic languages as Ali. In Muslim culture, Ali is respected for his courage, knowledge, belief, honesty, unbending devotion to Islam, deep loyalty to Muhammad, equal treatment of all Muslims and generosity in forgiving his defeated enemies, and therefore is central to mystical traditions in Islam such as Sufism. Ali retains his stature as an authority on Quranic exegesis, Islamic jurisprudence and religious thought. Ali holds a high position in almost all Sufi orders which trace their lineage through him to Muhammad. Ali's influence has been important throughout Islamic history. Sunni and Shia scholars agree that the verse of Wilayah was narrated in honour of Ali, but there are differing interpretations of \"wilayah\" and the \"Imamate\". The Sunni scholars believe that the verse is about Ali but does not recognise him as an Imam while, in the Shia Muslim view, Ali had been chosen by God as successor of Muhammad.\n\nThere are many verses interpreted by Shi'a scholars as referring to Ali or other Shi'a Imams. Responding to this question that why the names of the Imams are not mentioned in Quran expressly Muhammad al-Baqir answers: \"Allah revealed Salat to his Prophet but never said of three or four Rakats, revealed Zakat but did not mention to its details, revealed Hajj but did not count its Tawaf and the Prophet interpreted their details. Allah revealed this verse and Prophet said this verse is about Ali, Hasan, Husayn and other the twelve Imams.\"\nAccording to Ali one quarter of Qur'anic verses are stating the station of Imams. Momen has listed many of these verses in his \"An Introduction to Shi'i Islam\". However, there are few verses that some Sunni commentators interpret as referring to Ali, among which are The verse of Wilayah (Quran, 5:55) that Sunni and Shiite scholars believe refers to the incident where Ali gave his ring to a beggar who asked for alms while performing ritual prayers in the mosque.\nThe verse of Mawadda (Quran, 42:23) is another verse which Shiite scholar along with Sunni ones like Al-Baydawi and Al-Zamakhshari and Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi believe that the phrase Kinship refers to Ali, Fatimah and their sons, Hasan and Husayn.\n\nThe verse of purification (Quran, 33:33) is also among the verses both Sunni and Shiite conjoined the name of Ali with it along with some other names.\nThe aforementioned verse of Mubahala, and also the verse 2:269 in which Ali is honoured with unique wisdom by both Shiite and Sunni commentators are other verses of this kind.\n\nThe Shia regard Ali as the most important figure after Muhammad and he represents a complex, legendary figure in their memory. He is a paragon of virtues, such as courage, magnanimity, sincerity, straightforwardness, eloquence and profound knowledge. Ali was righteous but suffered injustice, he was authoritative but also compassionate and humble, vigorous but also patient, learned but also man of labor. According to Shia, Muhammad suggested on various occasions during his lifetime that Ali should be the leader of Muslims after his death. This is supported by numerous hadiths which have been narrated by Shias, including Hadith of the pond of Khumm, Hadith of the two weighty things, Hadith of the pen and paper, Hadith of the Cloak, Hadith of position, Hadith of the invitation of the close families, and Hadith of the Twelve Successors.\n\nJa'far al-Sadiq narrates in hadith that whatever virtue found in Muhammad was found in Ali, turning away from his guidance would be akin to turning away from Allah and his Prophet. Ali himself narrates that he is the gateway and supervisor to reach Allah. .\nAccording to this view, Ali as the successor of Muhammad not only ruled over the community in justice, but also interpreted the Sharia Law and its esoteric meaning. Hence he was regarded as being free from error and sin (infallible), and appointed by God by divine decree (nass) through Muhammad. It is believed in Twelver and Ismaili Shīa Islam that 'aql, divine wisdom, was the source of the souls of the Prophets and Imams and gave them esoteric knowledge called \"ḥikmah\" and that their sufferings were a means of divine grace to their devotees. Although the Imam was not the recipient of a divine revelation, he had a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides the people. His words and deeds are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result it is a source of sharia law.\nShia pilgrims usually go to Mashad Ali in Najaf for Ziyarat, pray there and read \"Ziyarat Amin Allah\" or other \"Ziyaratnamehs\". Under the Safavid Empire, his grave became the focus of much devoted attention, exemplified in the pilgrimage made by Shah Ismail I to Najaf and Karbala.\n\nMany Shia Muslims also celebrate Imam Ali's birth anniversary (13th day of Rajab) as Father's Day. The Gregorian date for this changes every year:\n\nSunnis view Ali as the fourth caliph. Ali is also known as one of the greatest warrior champions of Islam. Examples include taking on the Quraish champion at the Battle of the Trench when nobody else dared. After multiple failed attempts of breaking the fort in the Battle of Khaybar, Ali was summoned, miraculously healed and conquered the fort.\n\nMuhammad ibn Idris Al-Shafi‘i, founder of the Shafi‘i school of fiqh, narrated the following when asked his opinion on Ali:\n\nAlmost all Sufi orders trace their lineage to Muhammad through Ali, an exception being Naqshbandi, who go through Abu Bakr. Even in this order, there is Ja'far al-Sadiq, the great great grandson of Ali. Sufis believe that Ali inherited from Muhammad the saintly power \"wilayah\" that makes the spiritual journey to God possible.\nEminent Sufis such as Ali Hujwiri claim that the tradition began with Ali and Junayd of Baghdad regarded Ali as the Sheikh of the principles and practices of Sufism.\nSufis recite \"Manqabat\" Ali in the praise of Ali.\n\n'Ali is known by various titles, some given due to his personal qualities and others due to events in his life:\n\nAli is recorded in some traditions as having forbidden those who sought to worship him in his own lifetime.\n\nSome groups such as the Alawites (Arabic: علوية \"Alawīyyah\") are claimed to believe that Ali was God incarnate. They are described as \"ghulat\" (, \"exaggerators\") by the majority of Islamic scholars. These groups have, according to traditionalist Muslims, left Islam due to their exaggeration of a human being's praiseworthy traits.\n\nIn Ali-Illahism, a syncretic religion centres on the belief that there have been successive incarnations of their Deity throughout history, and reserves particular reverence for 'Ali, the son-in-law of Muhammad, who is considered one such incarnation.\n\nThe Druze, a syncretic religion, believe that God was incarnated in human beings, especially Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah a descendant of Ali.\n\nThe primary sources for scholarship on the life of Ali are the Qur'an and \"ahadith\", as well as other texts of early Islamic history. The extensive secondary sources include, in addition to works by Sunni and Shī'a Muslims, writings by Christian Arabs, Hindus, and other non-Muslims from the Middle East and Asia and a few works by modern western scholars. However, many of the early Islamic sources are coloured to some extent by a positive or negative bias towards Ali.\n\nThere had been a common tendency among the earlier western scholars against these narrations and reports gathered in later periods due to their tendency towards later Sunni and Shī'a partisan positions; such scholars regarding them as later fabrications. This leads them to regard certain reported events as inauthentic or irrelevant. Leone Caetani considered the attribution of historical reports to Ibn Abbas and Aisha as mostly fictitious while proffering accounts reported without \"isnad\" by the early compilers of history like Ibn Ishaq. Wilferd Madelung has rejected the stance of indiscriminately dismissing everything not included in \"early sources\" and in this approach tendentiousness alone is no evidence for late origin. According to him, Caetani's approach is inconsistent. Madelung and some later historians do not reject the narrations which have been compiled in later periods and try to judge them in the context of history and on the basis of their compatibility with the events and figures.\n\nUntil the rise of the Abbasid Caliphate, few books were written and most of the reports had been oral. The most notable work previous to this period is \"The Book of Sulaym ibn Qays\", written by Sulaym ibn Qays, a companion of Ali who lived before the Abbasid. When paper was introduced to Muslim society, numerous monographs were written between 750 and 950. According to Robinson, at least twenty-one separate monographs have been composed on the Battle of Siffin. Abi Mikhnaf is one of the most renowned writers of this period who tried to gather all of the reports. 9th and 10th century historians collected, selected and arranged the available narrations. However, most of these monographs do not exist any more except for a few which have been used in later works such as History of the Prophets and Kings by Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari (d.923).\n\nShia of Iraq actively participated in writing monographs but most of those works have been lost. On the other hand, in the 8th and 9th century Ali's descendants such as Muhammad al Baqir and Jafar as Sadiq narrated his quotations and reports which have been gathered in Shia hadith books. The later Shia works written after the 10th century are about biographies of The Fourteen Infallibles and Twelve Imams. The earliest surviving work and one of the most important works in this field is \"Kitab al-Irshad\" by Shaykh Mufid (d. 1022). The author has dedicated the first part of his book to a detailed account of Ali. There are also some books known as \"Manāqib\" which describe Ali's character from a religious viewpoint. Such works also constitute a kind of historiography.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a part of worship service in a Gurdwara (Sikh temple), daily rituals such as the opening the \"Guru Granth Sahib\" for \"prakash\" (morning light) or closing it for \"sukhasan\" (night bedroom) in larger Gurdwaras, closing of congregational worship in smaller Gurdwaras, rites-of-passages such as with the naming of child or the cremation of a loved one, daily prayer by devout Sikhs and any significant Sikh ceremonies. \n\nAn Ardas consists of three parts. The first part recites the virtues of the ten Gurus of Sikhism from Guru Nanak to Guru Gobind Singh, starting with lines from \"Chandi di Var\" from the \"Dasam Granth\". The second part recites the trials and triumphs of the Khalsa and petition. The third salutes the divine name. The first and the third part are set and cannot be changed, while the second part may vary, be shortened and include a supplication such as seeking divine help or blessing in dealing with daily problems, but is usually in agreed form. While it is sung, the audience or the Sikh devotee typically stands, with hands clasped in the folded namaste gesture, many with bowed headed, with some typically saying \"Waheguru\" after certain sections.\n\nArdas is attributed to Guru Gobind Singh, the founder of the Khalsa and the 10th Guru of Sikhism.\n\nThe root of the word Ardas is related to the Sanskrit word \"ard\" (अर्द) which means \"request, ask, beg\". It is also related to the Persian word \"arzdasht\" which means a written \"petition made by an inferior to a superior\".\n\nThe Ardās is usually always done standing up with folded hands and is commonly preceded by the eighth stanza of the fourth ashtapadi of the bani Sukhmani, beginning \"Tu Thakur Tum Peh Ardaas\". It consists of three parts:\n\nThe end of the Ardaas (\"Nanak Nam Chardi Kala, Tere Bhane Sarbat Da Bala\", \"O Nanak, may the Nam (Holy) be ever in ascendance! in Thy will may the good of all prevail!\") is also set and may not be altered or omitted.\n\nThe \"Ardās\" of Sikhism was first composed by Guru Gobind Singh. He fixed the first eight lines and the last section, and these are considered unalterable in Sikhism. The second section has been fluid, revised extensively and particularly by Tat Khalsa in the 20th century. The Sikh Rahit Maryada has published an approved version of the entire Ardas.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "93943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=93943", "title": "Bessus", "text": "Bessus\n\nBessus, also known as Artaxerxes V (died summer 329 BC), was a prominent Persian Satrap of Bactria in Persia, and later self-proclaimed King of Kings of Persia. According to classical sources, he killed his predecessor and relative, Darius III, after the Persian army had been defeated by Alexander the Great.\n\nAt the Battle of Gaugamela (1 October 331 BC), in which Alexander defeated Darius III, Bessus commanded the left wing of the Persian army, chiefly composed of warriors from his Satrapy who had been mobilized before the Battle of Issus. The envelopment ordered by Darius failed and the Persians lost the battle after hours of fierce fighting. Bessus survived the battle and remained with his king, whose routed army eluded Alexander's forces and spent the winter in Ecbatana. The next year Darius attempted to flee to Bactria in the east. Bessus, conspiring with fellow satraps, deposed Darius and, according to sources, put him in golden chains. It is not clear whether Bessus was motivated primarily by personal ambition or by disillusionment with Darius as a leader. He may have intended to surrender the deposed king to the Macedonians, but Alexander ordered his forces to continue to pursue the Persians.\n\nAccording to sources, the panicked conspirators stabbed Darius and left him dying in a cart to be found by a Macedonian soldier. The Babylonian Chronicle known as BCHP 1 indicates this happened in July 330 BC. The site has been identified near modern Ahuan.\n\nBessus immediately proclaimed himself King of Kings of Persia and adopted the throne name Artaxerxes (V). His self-proclaimed ascension was justifiable, since the Satrap of Bactria, known as \"Mathišta\", was the Persian noble next in the line of succession to the Persian throne. But since most of the Persian Empire had already been conquered and Bessus only ruled over a loose alliance of those provinces not yet occupied by the Macedonians, historians do not generally regard him as an official King of Kings of Persia.\n\nBessus returned to Bactria and tried to organize resistance among the eastern satrapies. Alexander was forced to move his force to suppress the uprising in 329 BC, entering Bactria by way of the Hindu Kush which had been left undefended. After burning the crops Bessus fled east, crossing the river Oxus. However his own Bactrian mounted levies deserted \"en masse\", rather than abandon their homeland. Bessus was seized by several of his chieftains who handed him over to the pursuing Macedonians in an isolated village. The Macedonian vanguard was commanded by General Ptolemy who, under orders from Alexander, had the former satrap put in a wooden collar and tied naked to a stake by the road down which the main army was marching. Alexander questioned Bessus as to why he had betrayed Darius and continued to lead resistance to the Macedonians. Bessus claimed that he had been only one of several nobles who had jointly agreed on the need to dethrone their irresolute king. Unsatisfied by his responses Alexander ordered the prisoner to be whipped and taken to Balkh and then to Hamadan for trial and punishment.\n\nA fellow conspirator against Darius, Satibarzanes Satrap of Aria, had already surrendered to Alexander and had been pardoned. However, unlike Bessus, Satibarzanes had not aspired to the Persian throne. At Hamadan, Alexander ordered that Bessus's nose and earlobes be cut off, which was a Persian custom for those involved in rebellion and regicide; the Behistun inscription relates that Darius the Great punished the usurper Phraortes of Media (who was the son of Upadaranma, king of Media) in a similar manner (c. 521 BC).\n\nAncient reports contradict each other about the nature of Bessus's execution. The historian, Quintus Curtius Rufus, says he was crucified in the place where Darius had been killed, Arrian states that he was tortured and then decapitated in Ecbatana, and Plutarch suggests that he was torn apart in Bactria by recoiling trees after a Macedonian trial, a style which was according to Persian custom: two trees would have been forcibly bent towards each other, the victim tied to both, and then the trees released, causing an agonizing and drawn-out death in which the ligaments, tendons, muscles and organs would slowly come apart as the trees straightened themselves.\n\n"}
{"id": "53663368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53663368", "title": "Billy Graham rule", "text": "Billy Graham rule\n\nThe Billy Graham rule is a practice among male evangelical Protestant leaders, in which they avoid spending time alone with women to whom they are not married. It is named after Billy Graham, a proponent of the practice, although recently has also been called the Mike Pence rule. It is adopted as a display of integrity, a means of avoiding sexual temptation, and to avoid any appearance of doing something considered morally objectionable, but has been criticized as being sexist.\n\nIn 1948, Graham held a series of evangelistic meetings in Modesto, California. Together with Cliff Barrows, Grady Wilson and George Beverly Shea, he resolved to \"avoid any situation that would have even the appearance of compromise or suspicion\". The accountability agreement, which has become known as the \"Modesto Manifesto\", covered not only their interactions with women, but also commitments to integrity with respect to finances, their interactions with local churches, and publicity. Since that time, Graham made a point of not traveling, meeting, or eating alone with a woman other than his wife Ruth. Graham biographer Grant Wacker observed that \"Over the years Graham received intense media scrutiny, but hardly anyone accused him of violating any of those four principles.\" By Graham's own admission, though, he was not an absolutist in the application of the rule that now bears his name: his autobiography relates a lunch meeting with Hillary Clinton that he initially refused on the grounds that he does not eat alone with women other than his wife, but she persuaded him that they could have a private conversation in a public dining room.\n\nIn March 2017, \"The Washington Post\" noted that U.S. Vice President Mike Pence had adopted a version of this rule, in that he will not have dinner alone with any woman other than his wife Karen. Emma Green, writing for \"The Atlantic\", noted that the controversy was an example of how \"notions of gender divide American culture\": while \"socially liberal or non-religious people may see Pence's practice as misogynistic or bizarre\", for \"a lot of conservative religious people\" the \"set-up probably sounds normal, or even wise\". Employment lawyer Joanna Grossman wrote that the Pence rule, when applied to workplace dinners, could be illegal labor discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nThe rule has been criticized for viewing women merely as potential objects of lust as well as restricting opportunities for women to network with male colleagues. Tracey Bianchi argues that it means \"Women are marginalized and cut out of opportunities to network, share their ideas, and advance in the organization.\" Bianchi also argues that the rule conflicts with the practice of Jesus himself, who spent time alone with the Samaritan woman at the well.\n\nTy Grigg suggests that the rule has not been \"effective at curbing infidelity\". He argues that the rule \"has framed relating with the opposite sex with fear\", and that this leads to a diminished mutual respect, which in turn creates \"the kind of environment where inappropriate relating is more likely to occur\". Others, though, suggest that unfaithful pastors must have failed to implement the rule.\n\nMichael Brown observes that criticism against the rule has misunderstood the purposes of the rule. He argues that the rule prevents third parties from suspecting that an illicit romantic relationship exists (avoiding the appearance of evil). It also protects against any future accusations should the other party become embittered and seek to attack the innocent boss. Finally, it does protect both parties from developing natural attractions and potentially falling into adultery.\n\nAccording to a 2017 poll conducted by the Morning Consult for the New York Times, 53% of women and 45% of men believe that it would be inappropriate to have dinner alone with someone of the opposite sex who is not their spouse, compared to 35% of women and 43% of men who would consider it appropriate.\n\n"}

Criticism of the Quran has frequently occurred since western scholarship has looked to decipher, understand and verify the claims of Islamic thought as stated in the Quran. Issues relating to the authenticity and morality of the Quran are criticized. Both critics and some scholars of western, eastern and secular backgrounds claim to have discovered scientific errors adding allegations of contradictions in the Quran while questioning its interpreted moral and ethical message.\n\nAccording to F. E. Peters, Professor Emeritus of History, Religion and Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies at New York University:\n\nWhat commends it (Quran) so powerfully to the historian is its authenticity, not as the Word of God, of course, as the Muslims believe but as the secular historian cannot and should not, but rather as a document attesting to what Muhammad said at that time and place, early seventh-century Mecca. It is not a transcript, however; our present Quran is the result of an edition prepared under the orders of Uthman... but the search for significant variants in the partial versions extant before Uthman's standard edition, what can be called the sources behind our text, has not yielded any differences of great significance. Those Uthmanic clues are fragmentary, however, and large 'invented' portions might well have been added to our Quran or authentic material deleted. So it has been charged in fact by some Muslims who failed to find in the present Quran any explicit reference to the designation of a successor to the Prophet and so have alleged tampering with the original texts. But the argument is so patently tendentious and the evidence adduced for the fact so exiguous that few have failed to be convinced that what is in our copy of the Quran is in fact what Muhammad taught, and is expressed in his own words.\n\nAccording to Islamic tradition, the Quran is the literal word of God as recited to the Islamic prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel. Muhammad, according to tradition, recited perfectly what the angel Gabriel revealed to him for his companions to write down and memorize. Muslims believe that the wording of the Quranic text available today corresponds exactly to that revealed to Muhammad in the years 610–632.\n\nMaurice Bucaille, medical doctor, author and member of the French Society of Egyptology, states in \"The Bible, The Qur'an and Science\" that \"The Quranic Revelation has a history which is fundamentally different from the other two. It spanned a period of some twenty years and, as soon as it was believed to be transmitted to Muhammad by Archangel Gabriel, Believers learned it by heart.\" It is traditionally believed to have been written down during Muhammad's life.\n\nDr. Suliman Bashear, leading scholar and administrator at the University of Nablus discusses the question: which of two sons was meant to be sacrificed by Abraham; Ishaq or Ismail:\n\nThe last recensions to make an official and uniform Quran in a single dialect were effected under Caliph Uthman (644–656) starting some twelve years after the Prophet's death and finishing twenty-four years after the effort began, with all other existing personal and individual copies and dialects of the Quran being burned:\n\nIt is traditionally believed the earliest writings had the advantage of being checked by people who already knew the text by heart, for they had learned it at the time of the revelation itself and had subsequently recited it constantly. Since the official compilation was completed several decades after Muhammad's death, the Uthman text has been scrupulously preserved. Bucaille believed that this did not give rise to any problems of this Quran's authenticity.\n\nMuir's \"The Life of Mahomet\" explains the outcome of these oral tradition when researching Al-Bukhari:\n\nRegarding who was the first to collect the narrations, and whether or not it was compiled into a single book by the time of Muhammad's death is contradicted by witnesses living when Muhammad lived, several historical narratives appear:\n\nZaid b. Thabit said:\n\nIt is reported… from Ali who said:\n\nIt is reported… from Ibn Buraidah who said:\n\nThe Sana'a manuscript contains older portions of the Quran showing variances different from the Uthman copy. The parchment upon which the lower codex of the Sana'a manuscript is written has been radiocarbon dated with 99% accuracy to before 671 CE, with a 95.5% probability of being older than 661 CE and 75% probability from before 646 CE. Tests by the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit indicated with a probability of more than 94 percent that the parchment dated from 568 to 645, possibly before Muhammad's official birth year. The Sana'a palimpsest is one of the most important manuscripts of the collection in the world. This palimpsest has two layers of text, both of which are Quranic and written in the Hijazi script. While the upper text is almost identical with the modern Qurans in use (with the exception of spelling variants), the lower text contains significant diversions from the standard text. For example, in sura 2, verse 87, the lower text has \"wa-qaffaynā 'alā āthārihi\" whereas the standard text has \"wa-qaffaynā min ba'dihi\". The Sana'a manuscript has exactly the same verses and the same order of verses as the standard Qur'an. The order of the suras in the Sana'a codex is different from the order in the standard Qur'an. Such variants are similar to the ones reported for the Quran codices of Companions such as Ibn Masud and Ubay ibn Ka'b. However, variants occur much more frequently in the Sana'a codex, which contains \"by a rough estimate perhaps twenty-five times as many [as Ibn Mas'ud's reported variants]\".\n\nIn 2015, the University of Birmingham disclosed that scientific tests may show a Quran manuscript in its collection as one of the oldest known and believe it was written close to the time of Muhammad. Dr Saud al-Sarhan, Director of Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh, questions whether the parchment might have been reused as a palimpsest, and also noted that the writing had chapter separators and dotted verse endings – features in Arabic scripts which are believed not to have been introduced to the Qur'an until later. Dr Saud's criticisms was affirmed by several Saudi-based experts in Quranic history, who strongly rebut any speculation that the Birmingham/Paris Quran could have been written during the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad. They emphasize that while Muhammad was alive, Quranic texts were written without chapter decoration, marked verse endings or use of coloured inks; and did not follow any standard sequence of surahs. They maintain that those features were introduced into Quranic practice in the time of the Caliph Uthman, and so the Birmingham leaves could have been written later, but not earlier.\n\nProfessor Süleyman Berk of the faculty of Islamic studies at Yalova University has noted the strong similarity between the script of the Birmingham leaves and those of a number of Hijazi Qurans in the Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum; which were brought to Istanbul from the Great Mosque of Damascus following a fire in 1893. Professor Berk recalls that these manuscripts had been intensively researched in association with an exhibition on the history of the Quran, \"The Quran in its 1,400th Year\" held in Istanbul in 2010, and the findings published by François Déroche as \"Qur’ans of the Umayyads\" in 2013. In that study, the Paris Quran, BnF Arabe 328(c), is compared with Qurans in Istanbul, and concluded as having been written \"around the end of the seventh century and the beginning of the eighth century.\"\n\nIn December 2015 Professor of the Collège de France confirmed the identification of the two Birmingham leaves with those of the Paris Qur'an BnF Arabe 328(c), as had been proposed by Dr Alba Fedeli. Prof. Deroche expressed reservations about the reliability of the radiocarbon dates proposed for the Birmingham leaves, noting instances elsewhere in which radiocarbon dating had proved inaccurate in testing Qur'ans with an explicit endowment date; and also that none of the counterpart Paris leaves had yet been carbon-dated. Jamal bin Huwareib, managing director of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Foundation, has proposed that, were the radiocarbon dates to be confirmed, the Birmingham/Paris Qur'an might be identified with the text known to have been assembled by the first Caliph Abu Bakr, between 632–634 CE.\n\nCritical research of historic events and timeliness of eye witness accounts reveal the effort of later traditionalists to consciously promote, for nationalistic purposes, the centrist concept of Mecca and prophetic descent from Ismail, in order to grant a Hijazi orientation to the emerging religious identity of Islam:\n\nIn their book \"\", Patricia Crone and Michael Cook challenge the traditional account of how the Quran was compiled, writing that \"there is no hard evidence for the existence of the Koran in any form before the last decade of the seventh century.\" Crone, Wansbrough, and Nevo argue that all the primary sources which exist are from 150–300 years after the events which they describe, and thus are chronologically far removed from those events.\nIt is generally acknowledged that the work of Crone and Cook was a fresh approach in its reconstruction of early Islamic history, but the theory has been almost universally rejected. Van Ess has dismissed it stating that \"a refutation is perhaps unnecessary since the authors make no effort to prove it in detail ... Where they are only giving a new interpretation of well-known facts, this is not decisive. But where the accepted facts are consciously put upside down, their approach is disastrous.\" R. B. Serjeant states that \"[Crone and Cook's thesis]… is not only bitterly anti-Islamic in tone, but anti-Arabian. Its superficial fancies are so ridiculous that at first one wonders if it is just a 'leg pull', pure 'spoof'.\" Francis Edward Peters states that \"Few have failed to be convinced that what is in our copy of the Quran is, in fact, what Muhammad taught, and is expressed in his own words\".\n\nIn 2006, legal scholar Liaquat Ali Khan claimed that Crone and Cook later explicitly disavowed their earlier book. Patricia Crone in an article published in 2006 provided an update on the evolution of her conceptions since the printing of the thesis in 1976. In the article she acknowledges that Muhammad existed as a historical figure and that the Quran represents \"utterances\" of his that he believed to be revelations. However she states that the Quran may not be the complete record of the revelations. She also accepts that oral histories and Muslim historical accounts cannot be totally discounted, but remains skeptical about the traditional account of the Hijrah and the standard view that Muhammad and his tribe were based in Mecca. She describes the difficulty in the handling of the hadith because of their \"amorphous nature\" and purpose as documentary evidence for deriving religious law rather than as historical narratives.\n\nThe author of the \"Apology of al-Kindy\" Abd al-Masih ibn Ishaq al-Kindi (not the famed philosopher al-Kindi) claimed that the narratives in the Quran were \"all jumbled together and intermingled\" and that this was \"an evidence that many different hands have been at work therein, and caused discrepancies, adding or cutting out whatever they liked or disliked\". Bell and Watt suggested that the variation in writing style throughout the Quran, which sometimes involves the use of rhyming, may have indicated revisions to the text during its compilation. They claimed that there were \"abrupt changes in the length of verses; sudden changes of the dramatic situation, with changes of pronoun from singular to plural, from second to third person, and so on\". At the same time, however, they noted that \"[i]f any great changes by way of addition, suppression or alteration had been made, controversy would almost certainly have arisen; but of that there is little trace.\" They also note that \"Modern study of the Quran has not in fact raised any serious question of its authenticity. The style varies, but is almost unmistakable.\"\n\nA recent study has argued that the Quran we have today is exactly the same as the one compiled by 'Ali ibn Abi-Talib, and that the reading of Hafs from his teacher 'Asim to be the unaltered reading of 'Ali. This is because 'Asim's teacher, Abu 'Abd al-Rahman al-Sulami, had learnt the Quran from 'Ali. Furthermore, Hafs was a Companion of Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq and it is claimed that the latter had inherited 'Ali's Master Copy of the Quran. The study provides a case that it was 'Ali's Master Copy which formed the basis of the 'Uthmanic canon. As for the reading of Hafs, the study presents evidence that the latter had learnt the Quran from two sources: 'Asim who was his main teacher, and Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq who provided him with a corrective of 'Asim's reading. If future research can validate these preliminary findings, then this could very well mean that the reading of Hafs from Asim is the \"de facto\" reading of 'Ali which he inherited from the Prophet till the very last dot.\"\n\nCritics reject the idea that the Quran is miraculously perfect and impossible to imitate (2:2, 17:88-89, 29:47, 28:49). The \"Jewish Encyclopedia\", for example, writes: \"The language of the Koran is held by the Mohammedans to be a peerless model of perfection. Critics, however, argue that peculiarities can be found in the text. For example, critics note that a sentence in which something is said concerning Allah is sometimes followed immediately by another in which Allah is the speaker (examples of this are suras xvi. 81, xxvii. 61, xxxi. 9, and xliii. 10.) Many peculiarities in the positions of words are due to the necessities of rhyme (lxix. 31, lxxiv. 3), while the use of many rare words and new forms may be traced to the same cause (comp. especially xix. 8, 9, 11, 16).\" According to the \"Jewish Encyclopedia\", \"The dependence of Mohammed upon his Jewish teachers or upon what he heard of the Jewish Haggadah and Jewish practices is now generally conceded.\" Early jurists and theologians of Islam mentioned some Jewish influence but they also say where it is seen and recognized as such, it is perceived as a debasement or a dilution of the authentic message. Bernard Lewis describes this as \"something like what in Christian history was called a Judaizing heresy.\" Philip Schaff described the Quran as having \"many passages of poetic beauty, religious fervor, and wise counsel, but mixed with absurdities, bombast, unmeaning images, low sensuality.\"\n\nAccording to Professor Moshe Sharon, specialist in Arabic epigraphy, the legends about Muhammad having ten Jewish teachers developed in the 10th century CE:\n\nGünter Lüling asserts that one-third of the Quran has pre-Islamic Christian origins. Gerd Puin claims that one-fifth of the Qur'an is \"not translatable\", and \"incomprehensible\" even to Arabic speakers.\n\nScholar Oddbjørn Leirvik states \"The Qur'an and Hadith have been clearly influenced by the non-canonical ('heretical') Christianity that prevailed in the Arab peninsula and further in Abyssinia\" prior to Islam.\n\nWhen looking at the narratives of Jesus found in the Quran, some themes are found in pre-Islamic sources such as the Infancy Gospels about Christ. Much of the qur'anic material about the selection and upbringing of Mary parallels much of the \"Protovangelium of James\", with the miracle of the palm tree and the stream of water being found in the \"Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew\". In Pseudo-Matthew, the flight to Egypt is narrated similarly to how it is found in Islamic lore, with Syriac translations of the Protoevangelium of James and The Infancy Story of Thomas being found in pre-Islamic sources.\n\nJohn Wansbrough believes that the Quran is a redaction in part of other sacred scriptures, in particular the Judaeo-Christian scriptures. Herbert Berg writes that \"Despite John Wansbrough's very cautious and careful inclusion of qualifications such as 'conjectural,' and 'tentative and emphatically provisional', his work is condemned by some. Some of the negative reaction is undoubtedly due to its radicalness... Wansbrough's work has been embraced wholeheartedly by few and has been employed in a piecemeal fashion by many. Many praise his insights and methods, if not all of his conclusions.\" Gerd R. Puin's study of ancient Quran manuscripts led him to conclude that the Quran is a \"cocktail of texts\", some of which may have been present a hundred years before Muhammad. Norman Geisler argues that the dependence of the Quran on preexisting sources is one evidence of a purely human origin.\n\nIbn Ishaq, an Arab Muslim historian and hagiographer who collected oral traditions that formed the basis of the important biography of Muhammad, also claimed that as a result of these discussions, the Qur'an was \"revealed\" addressing all these arguments – leading to the conclusion that Muhammad may have incorporated Judeo-Christian tales he had heard from other people. For example, in al-Sirah an-Nabawiyyah (an edited version of Ibn Ishaq's original work), Ibn Hishām's report\n\nA study of informant reports by Claude Gilliot concluded the possibility that whole sections of the Meccan Quran contains elements from or within groups possessing Biblical, post-Biblical and other sources. One such report and likely informant of Muhammad was the Christian slave mentioned in Sahih Bukhari whom Ibn Ishaq named as Jabr for which the Quran's chapter 16: 101-104 was probably \"revealed.\" Waqidi names this Christian as Ibn Qumta, with his identity and religious affiliation being contradicted in informant reports. Ibn Ishaq also recounts the story of how three Christians, Abu Haritha Ibn `Alqama, Al-`Aqib `Abdul-Masih and Al-Ayham al-Sa`id, spoke to Muhammad regarding such Christian subjects as the Trinity.\n\nThe narration of the baby Jesus speaking from the cradle can be traced back to the \"Arabic Infancy Gospel\", and the miracle of the bringing clay birds to life being found in \"The Infancy Story of Thomas\".\n\nAccording to Ibn Warraq, the Iranian rationalist Ali Dashti criticized the Quran on the basis that for some passages, \"the speaker cannot have been God.\" Warraq gives Surah Fatihah as an example of a passage which is \"clearly addressed to God, in the form of a prayer.\" He says that by only adding the word \"say\" in front of the passage, this difficulty could have been removed. Furthermore, it is also known that one of the companions of Muhammad, Ibn Masud, rejected Surah Fatihah as being part of the Quran; these kind of disagreements are, in fact, common among the companions of Muhammad who could not decide which surahs were part of the Quran and which not. Quran is divided into two parts the seven verses (Al-Fatiha) and Quran the great.\nCases where the speaker is swearing an oath by God, such as surahs 75:1–2 and 90:1, have been made a point of criticism. But according to Richard Bell, this was probably a traditional formula, and Montgomery Watt compared such verses to . It is also widely acknowledged that the first-person plural pronoun in Surah 19:64 refers to angels, describing their being sent by God down to Earth. Bell and Watt suggest that this attribution to angels can be extended to interpret certain verses where the speaker is not clear.\n\nMany modern Muslims believe that the Quran does make scientific statements; however, many classical Muslim commentators and scientists, notably al-Biruni, assigned to the Quran a separate and autonomous realm of its own and held that the Quran \"does not interfere in the business of science nor does it infringe on the realm of science.\" These medieval scholars argued for the possibility of multiple scientific explanations of the natural phenomena, and refused to subordinate the Quran to an ever-changing science. Some modern scholars like G. A. Parwez have translated those verses in the Quran which are generally associated with \"miracles\", \"angels\" and \"jinn\" rationally as metaphors, without appealing to the supernatural.\n\nEvolution. Quranic verses , , , , , , , , and are all related to the origin of mankind. If Allah created man directly from dust, as the Quran says, then the Quran and modern evolutionary theory are not logically compatible. This has led to a contribution by Muslims to the creation vs. evolution debate. Some Muslims have pointed to certain Quranic verses (such as , , , , ) that they think are in fact compatible with evolutionary science. Hence the general agreement among most Muslims is that only creation of Adam, the first human being is supported by the Quran and the hadith.. Most muslims do not find it contradictory to believe in evolution of all other things. \n\nNaskh (نسخ) is an Arabic language word usually translated as \"abrogation\"; it shares the same root as the words appearing in the phrase \"al-nāsikh wal-mansūkh\" (الناسخ والمنسوخ, \"the abrogater and the abrogated [verses]\"). The concept of \"abrogation\" in the Quran is that God chose to reveal ayat (singular ayah; means a sign or miracle, commonly a verse in the Quran) that supersede earlier ayat in the same Quran. The abrogation means that the revelation about the stories of previous messengers cannot be used as legal basis because they are abrogated by more general verses of Quran. The central ayah that deals with abrogation is Surah 2:106:\n\nPhilip Schaff argues that the concept of abrogation was developed to \"remove\" contradictions found in the Quran:\n\nMuhammad Husayn Tabatabaei believes abrogation in Quranic verses is not an indication of contradiction but an indication of addition and supplementation. As an example he mentions 2:109 where -according to him- it clearly states the forgiveness is not permanent and soon there will be another command (through another verse) on this subject that completes the matter. He also mentions 4:15 where the abrogated verse indicates its temporariness.\n\nOther scholars; however, have translated the 'abrogation' verse differently and disagree with the mainstream view. Ghulam Ahmed Parwez in his \"Exposition of the Quran\" derived the following meaning from the verse 2:106, making it consistent with the overall content of the Quran:\n\nSome criticism of the Quran has revolved around two verses known as the \"Satanic Verses\". Some early Islamic histories recount that as Muhammad was reciting Sūra Al-Najm (Q.53), as revealed to him by the angel Gabriel, Satan tempted him to utter the following lines after verses 19 and 20: \"Have you thought of Al-lāt and al-'Uzzā and Manāt the third, the other; These are the exalted Gharaniq, whose intercession is hoped for.\" The Allāt, al-'Uzzā and Manāt were three goddesses worshiped by the Meccans. These histories then say that these 'Satanic Verses' were repudiated shortly afterward by Muhammad at the behest of Gabriel.\n\nThere are numerous accounts reporting the alleged incident, which differ in the construction and detail of the narrative, but they may be broadly collated to produce a basic account. The different versions of the story are all traceable to one single narrator Muhammad ibn Ka'b, who was two generations removed from biographer Ibn Ishaq. In its essential form, the story reports that Muhammad longed to convert his kinsmen and neighbors of Mecca to Islam. As he was reciting Sūra an-Najm, considered a revelation by the angel Gabriel, Satan tempted him to utter the following lines after verses 19 and 20:\n\nHave ye thought upon Al-Lat and Al-‘Uzzá\nand Manāt, the third, the other?These are the exalted \"gharāniq\", whose intercession is hoped for.\n\nAllāt, al-'Uzzā and Manāt were three goddesses worshipped by the Meccans. Discerning the meaning of \"gharāniq\" is difficult, as it is a \"hapax legomenon\" (i.e. only used once in the text). Commentators wrote that it meant the cranes. The Arabic word does generally mean a \"crane\" – appearing in the singular as \"ghirnīq, ghurnūq, ghirnawq\" and \"ghurnayq\", and the word has cousin forms in other words for birds, including \"raven, crow\" and \"eagle\".\n\nThe subtext to the event is that Muhammad was backing away from his otherwise uncompromising monotheism by saying that these goddesses were real and their intercession effective. The Meccans were overjoyed to hear this and joined Muhammad in ritual prostration at the end of the \"sūrah\". The Meccan refugees who had fled to Abyssinia heard of the end of persecution and started to return home. Islamic tradition holds that Gabriel chastised Muhammad for adulterating the revelation, at which point is revealed to comfort him,\n\nNever sent We a messenger or a prophet before thee but when He recited (the message) Satan proposed (opposition) in respect of that which he recited thereof. But Allah abolisheth that which Satan proposeth. Then Allah establisheth His revelations. Allah is Knower, Wise.\n\nMuhammad took back his words and the persecution of the Meccans resumed. Verses were given, in which the goddesses are belittled. The passage in question, from 53:19, reads:\n\nHave ye thought upon Al-Lat and Al-'Uzza\nAnd Manat, the third, the other?\nAre yours the males and His the females?\nThat indeed were an unfair division!\nThey are but names which ye have named, ye and your fathers, for which Allah hath revealed no warrant. They follow but a guess and that which (they) themselves desire. And now the guidance from their Lord hath come unto them.\n\nThe incident of the Satanic Verses is put forward by some critics as evidence of the Quran's origins as a human work of Muhammad. Maxime Rodinson describes this as a conscious attempt to achieve a consensus with pagan Arabs, which was then consciously rejected as incompatible with Muhammad's attempts to answer the criticism of contemporary Arab Jews and Christians, linking it with the moment at which Muhammad felt able to adopt a \"hostile attitude\" towards the pagan Arabs. Rodinson writes that the story of the Satanic Verses is unlikely to be false because it was \"one incident, in fact, which may be reasonably accepted as true because the makers of Muslim tradition would not have invented a story with such damaging implications for the revelation as a whole\". In a caveat to his acceptance of the incident, William Montgomery Watt, states: \"Thus it was not for any worldly motive that Muhammad eventually turned down the offer of the Meccans, but for a genuinely religious reason; not for example, because he could not trust these men nor because any personal ambition would remain unsatisfied, but because acknowledgment of the goddesses would lead to the failure of the cause, of the mission he had been given by God.\" Academic scholars such as William Montgomery Watt and Alfred Guillaume argued for its authenticity based upon the implausibility of Muslims fabricating a story so unflattering to their prophet. Watt says that \"the story is so strange that it must be true in essentials.\" On the other hand, John Burton rejected the tradition.\n\nIn an inverted culmination of Watt's approach, Burton argued the narrative of the \"satanic verses\" was forged, based upon a demonstration of its actual utility to certain elements of the Muslim community – namely, those elite sections of society seeking an \"occasion of revelation\" for eradicatory modes of abrogation. Burton's argument is that such stories served the vested interests of the status-quo, allowing them to dilute the radical messages of the Quran. The rulers used such narratives to build their own set of laws which contradicted the Quran, and justified it by arguing that not all of the Quran is binding on Muslims. Burton also sides with Leone Caetani, who wrote that the story of the \"satanic verses\" should be rejected not only on the basis of \"isnad\", but because \"had these hadiths even a degree of historical basis, Muhammad's reported conduct on this occasion would have given the lie to the whole of his previous prophetic activity.\" Eerik Dickinson also pointed out that the Quran's challenge to its opponents to prove any inconsistency in its content was pronounced in a hostile environment, also indicating that such an incident did not occur or it would have greatly damaged the Muslims.\n\nSome verses of the Quran are assumed to be directed towards all of Muhammad's followers while other verses are directed more specifically towards Muhammad and his wives, yet others are directed towards the whole of humanity.\n(33:28, 33:50, 49:2, 58:1, 58:9 66:3).\n\nOther scholars argue that variances in the Quran's explicit intended audiences are irrelevant to claims of divine origin – and for example that Muhammad's wives \"specific divine guidance, occasioned by their proximity to the Prophet (Muhammad)\" where \"Numerous divine reprimands addressed to Muhammad's wives in the Quran establish their special responsibility to overcome their human frailties and ensure their individual worthiness\", or argue that the Quran must be interpreted on more than one level. (See:).\n\nBritish-German professor of Arabic and Islam Joseph Schacht, in his work \"The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence\" (1950) regarding the subject of law derived from the Quran, wrote:\n\nSchacht further states that every legal tradition from the Prophet must be taken as inauthentic and fictitious expression of a legal doctrine formulated at a later date:\n\nWhat is evident regarding the compilation of the Quran is the disagreement between the companions of Muhammad (earliest supporters of Muhammad), as evidenced with their several disagreements regarding interpretation and particular versions of the Quran and their interpretative Hadith and Sunna, namely the mutawatir mushaf having come into present form after Muhammad's death. John Burton's work \"The Collection of the Quran\" further explores how certain Quranic texts were altered to adjust interpretation, in regards to controversy between fiqh (human understanding of Sharia) and madhahib.\n\nThomas Carlyle, after reading Sale's translation, called the Quran \"toilsome reading and a wearisome confused jumble, crude, incondite\" with \"endless iterations, long-windedness, entanglement\" and \"insupportable stupidity.\" He said it is the work of a \"great rude human soul\". Gerd Rüdiger Puin noted that approximately every fifth sentence of it does not make any sense despite the Qur'an's own claim of being a clear book. Salomon Reinach wrote that this book warrants little merit from a literary point of view.\n\nAccording to some critics, the morality of the Quran, like the life story of Muhammad, appears to be a moral regression, by the standards of the moral traditions of Judaism and Christianity it says that it builds upon. The \"Catholic Encyclopedia\", for example, states that \"the ethics of Islam are far inferior to those of Judaism and even more inferior to those of the New Testament\" and \"that in the ethics of Islam there is a great deal to admire and to approve, is beyond dispute; but of originality or superiority, there is none.\" William Montgomery Watt however finds Muhammad's changes an improvement for his time and place: \"In his day and generation Muhammad was a social reformer, indeed a reformer even in the sphere of morals. He created a new system of social security and a new family structure, both of which were a vast improvement on what went before. By taking what was best in the morality of the nomad and adapting it for settled communities, he established a religious and social framework for the life of many races of men.\"\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville (1805 – 1859), a French political thinker and historian, observed:\n\nThe Quran's teachings on matters of war and peace have become topics of heated discussion in recent years. On the one hand, some critics, such as Sam Harris, interpret that certain verses of the Quran sanction military action against unbelievers as a whole both during the lifetime of Muhammad and after. Harris argues that Muslim extremism is simply a consequence of taking the Quran literally, and is skeptical that \"moderate Islam\" is possible. On the other hand, other scholars argue that such verses of the Quran are interpreted out of context, and Muslims of the Ahmadiyya movement argue that when the verses are read in context it clearly appears that the Quran prohibits aggression, and allows fighting only in self-defense.\n\nThe author Syed Kamran Mirza has argued that a concept of 'Jihad', defined as 'struggle', has been introduced by the Quran. He wrote that while Muhammad was in Mecca, he \"did not have many supporters and was very weak compared to the Pagans\", and \"it was at this time he added some 'soft', peaceful verses\", whereas \"almost all the hateful, coercive and intimidating verses later in the Quran were made with respect to Jihad\" when Muhammad was in Medina .\n\nMicheline R. Ishay has argued that \"the Quran justifies wars for self-defense to protect Islamic communities against internal or external aggression by non-Islamic populations, and wars waged against those who 'violate their oaths' by breaking a treaty\". Mufti M. Mukarram Ahmed has also argued that the Quran encourages people to fight in self-defense. He has also argued that the Quran has been used to direct Muslims to make all possible preparations to defend themselves against enemies.\n\nShin Chiba and Thomas J. Schoenbaum argue that Islam \"does not allow Muslims to fight against those who disagree with them regardless of belief system\", but instead \"urges its followers to treat such people kindly\". Yohanan Friedmann has argued that the Quran does not promote fighting for the purposes of religious coercion, although the war as described is \"religious\" in the sense that the enemies of the Muslims are described as \"enemies of God\".\n\nRodrigue Tremblay has argued that the Quran commands that non-Muslims under a Muslim regime, should \"feel themselves subdued\" in \"a political state of subservience\" . He also argues that the Quran may assert freedom within religion. Nisrine Abiad has argued that the Quran incorporates the offence (and due punishment) of \"rebellion\" into the offence of \"highway or armed robbery\".\n\nGeorge W. Braswell has argued that the Quran asserts an idea of Jihad to deal with \"a sphere of disobedience, ignorance and war\".\n\nMichael David Bonner has argued that the \"deal between God and those who fight is portrayed as a commercial transaction, either as a loan with interest, or else as a profitable sale of the life of this world in return for the life of the next\", where \"how much one gains depends on what happens during the transaction\", either \"paradise if slain in battle, or victory if one survives\". Critics have argued that the Quran \"glorified Jihad in many of the Medinese suras\" and \"criticized those who fail(ed) to participate in it\".\n\nAli Ünal has claimed that the Quran praises the companions of Muhammad, for being stern and implacable against the said unbelievers, where in that \"period of ignorance and savagery, triumphing over these people was possible by being strong and unyielding.\"\n\nSolomon Nigosian concludes that the \"Quranic statement is clear\" on the issue of fighting in defense of Islam as \"a duty that is to be carried out at all costs\", where \"God grants security to those Muslims who fight in order to halt or repel aggression\".\n\nShaikh M. Ghazanfar argues that the Quran has been used to teach its followers that \"the path to human salvation does not require withdrawal from the world but rather encourages moderation in worldly affairs\", including fighting. Shabbir Akhtar has argued that the Quran asserts that if a people \"fear Muhammad more than they fear God, 'they are a people lacking in sense'\" rather than a fear being imposed upon them by God directly.\n\nVarious calls to arms were identified in the Quran by US citizen Mohammed Reza Taheri-azar, all of which were cited as \"most relevant to my actions on March 3, 2006\".\n\nVerse 4:34 of the Quran as translated by Ali Quli Qara'i reads:\n\nMany translations do not necessarily imply a chronological sequence, for example, Marmaduke Pickthall's, Muhammad Muhsin Khan's, or Arthur John Arberry's. Arberry's translation reads \"admonish; banish them to their couches, and beat them.\"\n\nThe Dutch film \"Submission\", which rose to fame outside the Netherlands after the assassination of its director Theo van Gogh by Muslim extremist Mohammed Bouyeri, critiqued this and similar verses of the Quran by displaying them painted on the bodies of abused Muslim women. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, the film's writer, said \"it is written in the Koran a woman may be slapped if she is disobedient. This is one of the evils I wish to point out in the film\".\n\nScholars of Islam have a variety of responses to these criticisms. (See An-Nisa, 34 for a fuller exegesis on the meaning of the text.) Some Muslim scholars say that the \"beating\" allowed is limited to no more than a light touch by siwak, or toothbrush. Some Muslims argue that beating is only appropriate if a woman has done \"an unrighteous, wicked and rebellious act\" beyond mere disobedience. In many modern interpretations of the Quran, the actions prescribed in 4:34 are to be taken in sequence, and beating is only to be used as a last resort.\n\nMany Islamic scholars and commentators have emphasized that beatings, where permitted, are not to be harsh or even that they should be \"more or less symbolic.\" According to Abdullah Yusuf Ali and Ibn Kathir, the consensus of Islamic scholars is that the above verse describes a light beating.\n\nSome jurists argue that even when beating is acceptable under the Quran, it is still discountenanced.\n\nShabbir Akhtar has argued that the Quran introduced prohibitions against \"the pre-Islamic practice of female infanticide\" (16:58, 17:31, 81:8).\n\nMax I. Dimont interprets that the Houris described in the Quran are specifically dedicated to \"male pleasure\". Henry Martyn claims that the concept of the Houris was chosen to satisfy Mohammed's followers.\n\nAlternatively, Annemarie Schimmel says that the Quranic description of the Houris should be viewed in a context of love; \"every pious man who lives according to God's order will enter Paradise where rivers of milk and honey flow in cool, fragrant gardens and virgin beloveds await home...\"\n\nUnder \"the Syro-Aramaic Reading of the Quran\" by Christoph Luxenberg, the words translating to \"Houris\" or \"Virgins of Paradise\" are instead interpreted as \"Fruits (grapes)\" and \"high climbing (wine) bowers... made into first fruits.\" Luxemberg offers alternate interpretations of these Quranic verses, including the idea that the Houris should be seen as having a specifically spiritual nature rather than a human nature; \"these are all very sensual ideas; but there are also others of a different kind... what can be the object of cohabitation in Paradise as there can be no question of its purpose in the world, the preservation of the race. The solution of this difficulty is found by saying that, although heavenly food, women etc.., have the name in common with their earthly equivalents, it is only by way of metaphorical indication and comparison without actual identity... authors have spiritualized the Houris.\"\n\nJane Gerber claims that the Quran ascribes negative traits to Jews, such as cowardice, greed, and chicanery. She also alleges that the Quran associates Jews with interconfessional strife and rivalry (), the Jewish belief that they alone are beloved of God (), and that only they will achieve salvation (). According to the \"Encyclopedia Judaica\", the Qur'an contains many attacks on Jews and Christians for their refusal to recognize Muhammad as a prophet. In the Muslim view, the crucifixion of Jesus was an illusion, and thus the Jewish plots against him ended in failure. In numerous verses the Qur'an accuses Jews of altering the Scripture. Karen Armstrong claims that there are \"far more numerous passages in the Qur'an\" which speak positively of the Jews and their great prophets, than those which were against the \"rebellious Jewish tribes of Medina\" (during Muhammad's time). Sayyid Abul Ala believes the punishments were not meant for all Jews, and that they were only meant for the Jewish inhabitants that were sinning at the time. According to historian John Tolan, the Quran contains a verse which criticizes the Christian worship of Jesus Christ as God, amongst other critiques of Jewish and Christian practices and doctrines. Despite this, the Quran has high praise for these religions, regarding them as the other two parts of the Abrahamic trinity.\n\nThe Christian doctrine of the Trinity states that God is a single being who exists, simultaneously and eternally, as a communion of three distinct persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. In Islam such plurality in God is a denial of monotheism (Quran 9:1–15) and thus a sin of shirk, which is considered to be a major 'al-Kaba'ir' sin.\n\nHindu Swami Dayanand Saraswati gave a brief analysis of the Quran in the 14th chapter of his 19th-century book Satyarth Prakash. He calls the concept of Islam to be highly offensive, and doubted that there is any connection of Islam with God:\n\nOn the other hand, Mahatma Gandhi, the moral leader of the 20th-century Indian independence movement, found the Quran to be peaceful, but the history of Muslims to be aggressive, while he claimed that Hindus have passed that stage of societal evolution:\n\n"}

{"id": "24700804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24700804", "title": "Dongchu", "text": "Dongchu\n\nDongchu (, 1907–1977) was a Chinese Ch'an Master in Mainland China and later in Taiwan, and also the teacher of respected modern-day Ch'an Master Sheng-yen. He is the 51st generation of Zen patriarch from the Caodong School (See Lineage Chart). He also established several monasteries and organizations in Taiwan that continue to exist and expand to this very day, including Chung-hwa Institute of Buddhist Culture(CHIBC) and Nung Chan Monastery.\n\nHe was born in Jiangsu province, China. At his early education period, he studied with various prominent monks such as Master Aiting and Master Nanting from the Zhulin Buddhist Institute in Zhenjiang. He then pursues his study further at Minnan Buddhist Institute in Xiamen, and studied under renowned scholar-monk and modernist Master Taixu. His peers in the institute include Master Yinshun, Zhumo, and Cihang (Tzuhang) – all of whom also became influential monks.\n\nAfter graduated from Minnan Buddhist Institute, Ven. Dongchu then became dean of the prestigious school Jiaoshan Buddhist Institute. At the same time, he was abbot of the Dinghui Monastery in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu province. Dinghui Monastery (\"Monastery of Samadhi and Wisdom\") was a very famous Ch'an monastery in China, it stands on an island in the Yangtze River, on a hill called \"Floating Jade Mountain\". It was first built around 194-195 CE and changed names several times before finally became Dinghui Monastery during Qing Dynasty. He also taught classes at several other Buddhist institutes, including Jingan Si(\"Quiet Calm\") Academy in Shanghai – at which young Sheng-yen, who was studying there, first encountered him. Ven. Dongchu had a reputation as a progressive thinker who, unlike most monks at his time, wouldn't hesitate to criticize others. He was also known as a fierce teacher and his students gave him the nickname the 'Big Gun'. His paradigm was much influence by his teacher, Taixu.\n\nHe also became the first permanent council member in the Buddhist Association of the Republic of China in 1947. But it didn't last long as within the next couple of years, the Communist Party drove Nationalists out of the Mainland China, and many religious leaders, in fear of the Communists' persecution, fled overseas – including Ven. Dongchu, who fled to Taiwan at 1949.\n\nHe took temporary shelter at Beitou, near Taipei, at the Fazang Monastery. Three months later, his passion for Buddhist education and culture led him to start the \"Humanity\" Magazine – the first Buddhist periodical in Taiwan. Its mission is to \"purify the minds of the people and establish Life Buddhism.\" By the early 1950s, it had grown very popular and its circulation reached Southeast Asia and East Asia, and the United States.\n\nVen. Dongchu established his first monastery in Taiwan at 1955. It was located in Beitou, near Taipei, and was completed a year later. Instead of naming it a 'monastery', he named it Chung-Hwa Institute of Buddhist Culture (CHIBC) to establish a foundation for cultural work. In 1956, he started a charity program called 'Winter Relief Drive' to collect donations to buy rice, oil, and winter clothing for poor families and orphanages in Beitou, Tamsui, Sanchong, Yilan, Taoyuan, and Xinzhuang. Therefore, they could celebrate Chinese New Year with warmth and meal.\n\nVen. Sheng-yen, who had been an active writer in the \"Humanity\" Magazine under his pen-name \"Xing Shi Jiang Jun\" (\"World Awakening General\"), became Ven. Dongchu's disciple in 1959. Ven. Sheng-yen was a soldier in the intelligence unit at that time, he joined the Army unwillingly in order to escape from Mainland China. Despite his position in the intelligence, Ven. Sheng-yen's request to be dismissed from his post was accepted by his superior with Ven. Dongchu's help.\n\nAside from his intellectual and charity activities, Ven. Dongchu didn't spend much time leading Buddhist ceremonies or rituals. In his later years, he rarely went out to focus on his writings. Thus, he didn't have many followers and disciples. However, he was persistent and in the 1960s he bought a 2.5 acres of land in the Guandu Plain, near Taipei. \nIn the beginning it only serves as a farmland cultivated by Ven. Dongchu and his two disciples – Ven. Sheng-yen was in solitary retreat at southern Taiwan by the time. Step by step, he built a farmhouse, and after four years of works, he succeeded to establish another monastery, Nung Chan Monastery in 1975. In Nung Chan, meaning \"Farming Ch'an\", the residents practice Ch'an while grow their own food. They live by the famous aphorism by Zen Master Baizhang Huaihai, \"A day without work is a day without food\". The monastery was dedicated to Bodhisattva Manjusri, which symbolizes great wisdom.\n\nIn 1976, Ven. Dongchu had a chance to visit his disciple Ven. Sheng-yen in New York. Ven. Sheng-yen was an abbot of a small monastery at the Bronx and he succeeded to gain a number of Western followers. They both had parted long before. Ven. Sheng-yen went to six-years solitary retreat in 1961. He then studied in Japan for some years and earned a doctorate degree before arriving in United States.\n\nVen. Dongchu died in 1977 in sitting position with no clear illness. In his last will he passed down the abbotship of CHIBC and Nung Chan to Ven. Sheng-yen. His ashes, which were kept in CHIBC before, were buried in the Life Memorial Garden of Dharma Drum Mountain in 2007.\n\nThe Chinese name of New York City's Ch'an Meditation Center(東初禪寺） is named after Ven. Master Dongchu by his disciple Ven. Master Sheng-yen.\n\n"}

The great chief was baptised and most of the tribe followed him. In 1966 when Botswana become independent, a Synod of the Reformed Church was formed. In the 1970s the church gained independence. The church in the following years expanded to Basarwa, Bakalanga and Bakgatla.\n\nThe denomination has 6,000 members and 13 parishes with 50 house fellowships in 2 presbyteries and one Synod.

The earthen platform served as the earth, a symbolism which endured into historic times. There are historically documented connections between additions to platforms mounds and the communal \"Green Corn Ceremony\", which celebrated the new harvest and the fertility of the earth. The quadrilateral, flat-topped design of many platform mounds may represent the Southeastern American Indian belief that the earth was a flat surface oriented towards four quarters of the world.\n\n"}

Flaming swords have existed in legend and myth for thousands of years. \n\nIn Sumerian mythology, the deity known as Asaruludu is \"the wielder of the flaming sword\" who \"ensures the most perfect safety\".\n\nAccording to the Bible, a cherub (or the archangel Uriel in some traditions) with a flaming sword was placed by God at the gates of Paradise after Adam and Eve were banished from it ( 3:24). \n\nEastern Orthodox tradition says that after Jesus was crucified and resurrected, the flaming sword was removed from the Garden of Eden, making it possible for humanity to re-enter Paradise.\n\nIn Welsh mythology the \"Dyrnwyn\" (\"White-Hilt\") is said to be a powerful sword belonging to Rhydderch Hael, one of the Three Generous Men of Britain mentioned in the Welsh Triads. When drawn by a worthy or well-born man, the entire blade would blaze with fire. Rhydderch was never reluctant to hand the weapon to anyone, hence his nickname \"Hael\" \"the Generous\", but the recipients, as soon as they had learned of its peculiar properties, always rejected the sword. Its fire would burn the man who drew it for an unworthy purpose.\n\nThe sword wielded by Surtr, a jotunn of Muspelheim is a flaming sword with immense destructive power that appears in Norse mythology.\n\nThe sword Acala holds may or may not be flaming and sometimes described only generically as a or as , which is descriptive of the fact that the pommel of the sword is in the shape of the talon-like of one type or another.\n\nDumah is an angel mentioned in Rabbinical literature. Dumah is a popular figure in Yiddish folklore. I. B. Singer's \"Short Friday\" (1964), a collection of stories, mentions Dumah as a \"thousand-eyed angel of death, armed with a flaming sword\".\n\n"}
{"id": "7079135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7079135", "title": "Forced conversion", "text": "Forced conversion\n\nForced conversion is adoption of a different religion or irreligion under duress. Some who have been forced to convert may continue, covertly, with the beliefs and practices originally held, while outwardly behaving as converts. Crypto-Jews, crypto-Christians, crypto-Muslims and crypto-Pagans are historical examples of the latter.\n\nIn general, anthropologists have shown that the relationship between religion and politics is complex, especially when viewed over the expanse of human history. While religious leaders and the state generally have different aims, both are concerned with power and order; both use reason and emotion to motivate behavior. Throughout history, leaders of religious and political institutions have cooperated, opposed one another, or attempted to co-opt each other, for purposes both noble and base, and have implemented programs with a wide range of driving values, from compassion aimed at alleviating current suffering to brutal change aimed at achieving longer-term goals, for the benefit of groups ranging from small cliques to all of humanity. The relationship is far from simple. But religion has often been used coercively, and has used coercion.\n\nForced conversions occurred under the Hasmonean Kingdom. The Idumeans were forced to convert to Judaism, by threat of exile or death, depending on the source.\nIn \"Eusebíus, Christianity, and Judaism\", Harold W. Attridge claims that \"there is reason to think that Josephus' account of their conversion is substantially accurate.\" He also writes: \"that these were not isolated instances, but that forced conversion was a national policy, is clear from the fact that Alexander Jannaeus (around 80 BC) demolished the city of Pella in Moab, 'because the inhabitants would not agree to adopt the national custom of the Jews.'\" Josephus, Antiquities. 13.15.4.\n\nMaurice Sartre has written of the \"policy of forced Judaization adopted by Hyrcanos, Aristobulus I and Jannaeus\", who offered \"the conquered peoples a choice between expulsion or conversion,\" William Horbury has written that \"The evidence is best explained by postulating that an existing small Jewish population in Lower Galilee was massively expanded by the forced conversion in c.104 BC of their Gentile neighbours in the north.\"\nIn 2009 the BBC defended a claim that in AD 524 the Yemeni Jewish Himyar tribe, led by King Dhu Nuwas, had offered Christian residents of a village in what is now Saudi Arabia the choice between conversion to Judaism or death, and that 20,000 Christians had then been massacred. The BBC stated that \"The production team spoke to many historians over 18 months, among them Nigel Groom, who was our consultant, and Professor Abdul Rahman Al-Ansary [former professor of archaeology at the King Saud University in Riyadh].\" Inscriptions documented by Yousef himself show the great pride he expressed after massacring more than 22,000 Christians in Zafar and Najran.\n\nChristianity was a minority religion during much of middle Roman Classical Period, and the early Christians were persecuted during that time. When Constantine I converted to Christianity, it became the dominant religion in the Roman Empire. Already under the reign of Constantine I, Christian heretics had been persecuted; beginning in the late 4th century, the ancient pagan religions were also actively suppressed. In the view of many historians, the Constantinian shift turned Christianity from a persecuted religion into one capable of persecution and sometimes eager to persecute.\n\nOn 27 February 380, together with Gratian and Valentinian II, Theodosius I issued the decree \"Cunctos populos\", the so-called Edict of Thessalonica, recorded in the Codex Theodosianus . This declared Trinitarian Nicene Christianity to be the only legitimate imperial religion and the only one entitled to call itself Catholic. Other Christians he described as \"foolish madmen\". He also ended official state support for the traditional polytheist religions and customs.\n\nThe \"Codex Theodosianus\" (Eng. Theodosian Code) was a compilation of the laws of the Roman Empire under the Christian emperors since 312. A commission was established by Theodosius II and his co-emperor Valentinian III on 26 March 429 and the compilation was published by a constitution of 15 February 438. It went into force in the eastern and western parts of the empire on 1 January 439.\n\nIt is Our will that all the peoples who are ruled by the administration of Our Clemency shall practice that religion which the divine Peter the Apostle transmitted to the Romans... The rest, whom We adjudge demented and insane, shall sustain the infamy of heretical dogmas, their meeting places shall not receive the name of churches, and they shall be smitten first by divine vengeance and secondly by the retribution of Our own initiative (Codex Theodosianus XVI 1.2.).\nForced conversions of Jews were carried out with the support of rulers during Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages in Gaul, the Iberian peninsula and in the Byzantine empire.\n\nDuring the Saxon Wars, Charlemagne, King of the Franks, forcibly converted the Saxons from their native Germanic paganism by way of warfare, and law upon conquest. Examples are the Massacre of Verden in 782, when Charlemagne reportedly had 4,500 captive Saxons massacred upon rebelling against conversion, and the \"Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae\", a law imposed on conquered Saxons in 785 that prescribed death to those who refused to convert to Christianity.\n\nForced conversion that occurred after the seventh century generally took place during riots and massacres carried out by mobs and clergy without support of the rulers. In contrast, royal persecutions of Jews from the late eleventh century onward generally took form of expulsions, with some exceptions, such as conversions of Jews in southern Italy of the 13th century, which were carried out by Dominican Inquisitors but instigated by King Charles II of Naples.\n\nJews were forced to convert to Christianity by the Crusaders in Lorraine, on the Lower Rhine, in Bavaria and Bohemia, in Mainz and in Worms. (see Rhineland massacres, Worms massacre (1096))\n\nPope Innocent III pronounced in 1201 that if one agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation, one nevertheless could be compelled to outwardly observe Christianity:\n\n[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...\n\nDuring the Northern Crusades against the pagan Balts and Slavs of northern Europe, forced conversions were a widely used tactic, which received papal sanction . These tactics were first adopted during the Wendish Crusade, but became more widespread during the Livonian Crusade and Prussian Crusade, in which tactics including the killing of hostages, massacre, and the devastation of the lands of tribes that had not yet submitted . Most of the populations of these regions were converted only after the repeated rebellion of native populations that did not want to accept Christianity even after initial forced conversion; in Old Prussia, the tactics employed in the initial conquest and subsequent conversion of the territory resulted in the death of most of the native population, whose language consequently became extinct. \n\nAfter the end of the Islamic control of Spain, Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492. In Portugal, following an order for their expulsion in 1496, only a handful were allowed to leave and the rest were forced to convert. Muslims were expelled from Portugal in 1497, and they were gradually forced to convert in the constituent kingdoms of Spain. The forced conversion of Muslims was implemented in the Crown of Castile from 1500–02 and in the Crown of Aragon in the 1520s. After the conversions, the so-called \"New Christians\" were those inhabitants (Sephardic Jews or Mudéjar Muslims) who were baptized under coercion and in the face of execution, becoming forced converts from Islam (Moriscos, Conversos and \"secret Moors\") or from Judaism (Conversos, Crypto-Jews and Marranos).\n\nAfter the forced conversion, when all former Muslims and Jews had ostensibly become Catholic, the Spanish Inquisition targeted primarily forced converts from Judaism, who came under suspicion of either continuing to adhere to their old religion or having fallen back into it. Jewish conversos still resided in Spain and often practised Judaism secretly and were suspected by the \"Old Christians\" of being Crypto-Jews. The Spanish Inquisition generated much wealth and income for the church and individual inquisitors by confiscating the property of the persecuted. The end of Al-Andalus and the expulsion of the Sephardic Jews from the Iberian Peninsula went hand in hand with the increase of Spanish and Portuguese influence in the world, as exemplified in the Christian conquest of the Americas and their aboriginal Indian population. The Ottoman Empire and Morocco absorbed most of the Jewish refugees, although a large majority remained as Conversos.\n\nDuring the European colonization of the Americas, forced conversion of the continents' indigenous, non-Christian population was common, especially in South America and Mesoamerica, where the conquest of large indigenous polities like the Inca and AztecEmpires placed colonizers in control of large non-Christian populations. Historians broadly agree that most native populations that converted did so under the threat of violence, often because they were compelled to after being conquered, and that the Catholic Church cooperated with civil authority to achieve this end. \nUpon converting to Christianity in the 10th century, Vladimir the Great, the ruler of Kievan Rus', ordered Kiev's citizens to undergo a mass baptism in the Dnieper river.\n\nIn the 13th century the pagan populations of the Baltics faced campaigns of forcible conversion by crusading knight corps such as the Livonian Brothers of the Sword and the Teutonic Order, which often meant simply dispossessing these populations of their lands and property.\n\nAfter Ivan the Terrible's conquest of the Khanate of Kazan, the Muslim population faced slaughter, expulsion, forced resettlement and conversion to Christianity.\n\nIn the 18th century, Elizabeth of Russia launched a campaign of forced conversion of Russia's non-Orthodox subjects, including Muslims and Jews.\n\nThe Portuguese practised religious persecution in Goa, India in the 16th and 17th centuries. The natives of Goa, most of them Hindus, were subjected to severe torture and oppression by the zealous Portuguese rulers and missionaries, and forcibly converted to Christianity.\n\nIn 1567, the campaign to destroy temples in Bardez met with success, with 300 Hindu temples destroyed. Prohibition was laid from December 4, 1567 on rituals of Hindu marriages, sacred thread wearing and cremation. All persons above 15 years of age were compelled to listen to Christian preaching, failing which they were punished. In 1583, Hindu temples at Assolna and Cuncolim were destroyed by the Portuguese army. \"The fathers of the Church forbade the Hindus under terrible penalties the use of their own sacred books, and prevented them from all exercise of their religion. They destroyed their temples, and so harassed and interfered with the people that they abandoned the city in large numbers, refusing to remain any longer in a place where they had no liberty, and were liable to imprisonment, torture and death if they worshiped after their own fashion the gods of their fathers\", wrote Filippo Sassetti, who was in India from 1578 to 1588. An order was issued in June 1684 for suppressing the Konkani language and making it compulsory to speak Portuguese, on pain of severe penalties. All non-Christian cultural symbols and books written in local languages were also ordered to be destroyed.\n\nDuring World War II, Orthodox Serbs were forcibly converted to Catholicism.\n\nIn 2009, the \"Assam Times\" reported that about fifteen armed Hmar militants, members of the Manmasi National Christian Army, tried to force Hindu residents of Bhuvan Pahar, Assam to convert to Christianity.\n\nAlthough Islamic law prohibits forced conversion, following the Quranic principle \"no compulsion in religion\" (2:256), episodes of forced conversions are recorded in the history of Islam. Historians have qualified such instances as \"rare\" or \"exceptional\".\n\nWhile scholars like Abu Hanifa and Abu Yusuf stated that jizya should be imposed all non-Muslims without distinction, some later and more extremist jurists do not permit jizya for idolators and instead only allowed the choice of conversion to avoid death. Out of the four schools of Islamic law, the Hanafi and Maliki schools allow the \"dhimmi\" status for polytheists except Arab polytheists. The Shafi'i and Hanbali school however only consider Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians to be eligible to the category.\n\nWael Hallaq states that in theory, Islamic religious tolerance applied only to monotheistic \"People of the Book\" like Christians, Jews and Magians if they paid the \"jizya\" tax, and pagans faced only two choices between conversion to Islam and fight to the death. In practice, the designation \"People of the Book\" and the dhimma status was extended even to non-monotheistic religions of conquered peoples, such as Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and other non-monotheists.\n\nIn recent times, forced conversions have been threatened or carried out in the context of war, insurgency and intercommunal violence. Cases affecting thousands of people are reported to have occurred during the Partition of India, the Bangladesh Liberation War, in areas controlled by ISIS, and in Pakistan. Disputed allegations of forced conversion of young women have generated public controversy in Egypt and the UK.\n\nThe wars of the Ridda (lit. apostasy), undertaken by the first caliph Abu Bakr against tribes who had accepted Islam but refused to recognize his caliphal authority have been described by some authors as an instance of forced conversion or \"reconversion\". The action of these tribes was less a relapse to paganism than termination of a political contract they had made with Muhammad.\n\nTwo out of the four schools of Islamic law, i.e. Hanafi and Maliki schools, accepted non-Arab polytheists to be eligible for the \"dhimmi\" status. Under this doctrine, Arab polytheists were forced to choose between conversion and death. However, according to perception of most jurists, all Arabs had embraced Islam during the lifetime of Muhammad. Their exclusion therefore had little practical significance after his death in 632.\n\nIn the 9th century, the Samaritan population of Palestine faced persecution and attempts at forced conversion at the hands of the rebel leader ibn Firāsa, against whom they were defended by Abbasid caliphal troops.\n\nThere were forced conversions in the 12th century under the Almohad dynasty of North Africa and Andalusia, who suppressed the dhimma status of Jews and Christians and gave them the choice between conversion, exile, and being killed. Christians under their rule generally chose to relocate to the Christian principalities in the north of the peninsula, while Jews decided to stay in order to keep their properties, and many of them feigned conversion to Islam, while continuing their religious practices in secrecy.\n\nDuring the Almohad persecution, the Jewish philosopher Maimonides wrote his \"Epistle on Apostasy\", in which he permitted Jews to feign apostasy under duress, though strongly recommending leaving the country instead. There is dispute amongst scholars as to whether Maimonides himself converted to Islam in order to freely escape from Almohad territory, and then reconverted back to Judaism in either the Levant or in Egypt. He was later denounced as an apostate and tried in an Islamic court, but the judge ruled that his conversion had been forced and therefore invalid.\n\nIn the late 1160s, the Yemenite ruler 'Abd-al-Nabī ibn Mahdi left Jews with the choice between conversion to Islam or martyrdom. Mahdi also imposed his beliefs upon the Muslims besides the Jews. This led to a revival of Jewish messianism, but also led to mass-conversion. The persecution ended in 1173 with the defeat of Ibn Mahdi and conquest of Yemen by the brother of Saladin and they were allowed to return to their faith.\n\nAccording to two Cairo Genizah documents, the Ayyubid ruler of Yemen, al-Malik al-Mu'izz al-Ismail (reigned from 1197-1202) had attempted to force the Jews of Aden to convert. The second document details the relief of Jewish community after his murder and those who had been forced to convert reverted to Judaism. While he didn't impose Islam upon the foreign merchants, they were forced to pay triple the normal rate of poll tax.\n\nA measure listed in the legal works by Al-Shawkānī is of forced conversion of Jewish orphans. No date is given for this decree by modern studies nor who issued it. The forced conversion of Jewish orphans was reintroduced under Imam Yahya in 1922. The Orphans' Decree was implemented aggressively for the first ten years. It was re-promulgated in 1928.\n\nA form of forced conversion became institutionalized during the Ottoman Empire in the practice of devşirme, a human levy in which Christian boys were seized and collected from their families (usually in the Balkans), enslaved, converted to Islam, and then trained as elite military unit within the Ottoman army or for high-ranking service to the sultan. From the mid to late 14th, through early 18th centuries, the devşirme–janissary system enslaved an estimated 500,000 to one million non–Muslim adolescent males. These boys would attain a great education and high social standing after their training and conversion.\n\nIn the 17th century, Sabbatai Zevi, a Sephardic Jew whose ancestors were welcomed in the Ottoman Empire during the Spanish Inquisition, proclaimed himself the Messiah and called for abolishing major Jewish laws and customs. After he attracted a large following, he was arrested by the Ottoman authorities and given a choice between execution or conversion to Islam. He chose the latter option.\n\nDuring the Persecution of Greeks in the 20th century, there were cases of forced conversion to Islam.\n\nIsmail I, the founder of the Safavid dynasty, decreed Twelver Shiism to be the official religion of state and ordered executions of a number of Sunni intellectuals who refused to accept Shiism. Non-Muslims faced frequent persecutions and at times forced conversions under the rule of his dynastic successors. Thus, after the capture of the Hormuz Island, Abbas I required local Christians to convert to Islam, Abbas II granted his ministers authority to force Jews to become Muslims, and Sultan Husayn decreed forcible conversion of Zoroastrians. In 1839, during the Qajar era the Jewish community in the city of Mashhad was attacked by a mob and subsequently forced to convert to Islam.\n\nIn an invasion of the Kashmir valley (1015), Mahmud of Ghazni plundered the valley, took many prisoners and carried out conversions to Islam. In his later campaigns, in Mathura, Baran and Kanauj, again, many conversions took place. Those soldiers who surrendered to him were converted to Islam. In Baran (Bulandshahr) alone 10,000 persons were converted to Islam including the king. Tarikh-i-Yamini, Rausat-us-Safa and Tarikh-i-Ferishtah speak of construction of mosques and schools and appointment of preachers and teachers by Mahmud and his successor Masud. Wherever Mahmud went, he insisted on the people to convert to Islam. The raids by Muhammad Ghori and his generals brought in thousands of slaves in the late 12th century, most of whom were compelled to convert as one of the preconditions of their freedom. Sikandar Butshikan (1394-1417) demolished Hindu temples and forcefully converted Hindus. Christianity thrived along the west coast during the 15th and 16th centuries following forced conversions carried out by Portuguese colonists.\n\nAurangzeb employed a number of means to encourage conversions to Islam. In a Mughal-Sikh war in 1715, 700 followers of Banda Singh Bahadur were beheaded. Every day, 100 Sikhs were executed and not even one of them apostatized from Sikhism. Banda Singh Bahadur was offered a pardon if he converted to Islam. Upon refusal, he was tortured, and was killed with his 5 year old son. Following the execution of Banda, the emperor ordered to apprehend Sikhs anywhere they were found.\n\n18th century ruler Tipu Sultan persecuted the Hindus, Christians and Mappla Muslims. During Sultan's Mysorean invasion of Kerala, hundreds of temples and churches were demolished and ten thousands of Christians and Hindus were killed or converted to Islam by force.\n\nIn Bangladesh, the International Crimes Tribunal tried and convicted several leaders of the Islamic Razakar militias, as well as Bangladesh Muslim Awami league (Forid Uddin Mausood), of war crimes committed against Hindus during the 1971 Bangladesh genocide. The charges included forced conversion of Bengali Hindus to Islam.\nIn the 1998 Prankote massacre, 26 Kashmiri Hindus were beheaded by Islamist militants after their refusal to convert to Islam. The militants struck when the villagers refused demands from the gunmen to convert to Islam and prove their conversion by eating beef.\nDuring the Noakhali riots of Hindus in 1946, several thousand Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam by Muslim mobs.\n\nThe rise of Taliban insurgency in Pakistan has been an influential and increasing factor in the persecution of and discrimination against religious minorities, such as Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, and other minorities.\n\nThe Human Rights Council of Pakistan has reported that cases of forced conversion are increasing. A 2014 report by the Movement for Solidarity and Peace (MSP) says about 1,000 women in Pakistan are forcibly converted to Islam every year (700 Christian and 300 Hindu).\n\nIn 2003 a six-year-old Sikh girl was kidnapped by a member of the Afridi tribe in Northwest Frontier Province; the alleged kidnapper claimed the girl was actually 12-years-old, and had converted to Islam so therefore could not be returned to her non-Muslim family.\n\nIn May 2007, members of the Christian community of Charsadda in the North West Frontier Province of Pakistan, close to the border of Afghanistan, reported that they had received letters threatening bombings if they did not convert to Islam, and that the police were not taking their fears seriously. In June 2009, International Christian Concern (ICC) reported the rape and killing of a Christian man in Pakistan, for refusing to convert to Islam.\n\nRinkle Kumari, a 19-year Pakistani student, Lata Kumari, and Asha Kumari, a Hindu working in a beauty parlor, were allegedly forced to convert from Hinduism to Islam. Their cases were appealed all the way to the Supreme Court of Pakistan where they said that they wanted to live with their parents and not their 'so called' husbands.\n\nSikhs in Hangu district were being pressured to convert to Islam by a government official in 2017.\n\nIn 2012, over 1000 Catholic children in East Timor, removed from their families, were reported to being held in Indonesia without consent of their parents, forcibly converted to Islam, educated in Islamic schools and naturalized. Other reports claim forced conversion of minority Ahmadiyya sect Muslims to Sunni Islam, with the use of violence.\n\nIn 2001 the Indonesian army evacuated hundreds of Christian refugees from the remote Kesui and Teor islands in Maluku after the refugees stated that they had been forced to convert to Islam. According to reports, some of the men had been circumcised against their will, and a paramilitary group involved in the incident confirmed that circumcisions had taken place while denying any element of coercion.\n\nIn 2017, many members of the Orang Rimba tribe, especially children, were being forced to renounce their folk religion and convert to Islam.\n\nThere have been a number of reports of attempts to forcibly convert religious minorities in Iraq. The Yazidi people of northern Iraq, who follow an ethnoreligious syncretic faith, have been threatened with forced conversion by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, who consider their practices to be Satanism. UN investigators have reported mass killings of Yazidi men and boys who refused to convert to Islam. In Baghdad, hundreds of Assyrian Christians fled their homes in 2007 when a local extremist group announced that they had to convert to Islam, pay the jizya or die. In March 2007 the BBC reported that people in the Mandaean ethnic and religious minority in Iraq alleged that they were being targeted by Islamist insurgents, who offered them the choice of conversion or death.\n\nAllegations of Coptic Christian girls being forced to marry Arab Muslim men and convert to Islam in Egypt have been reported by a number of news and advocacy organizations and have sparked public protests. According to a 2009 report by the US State Department, observers have found it extremely difficult to determine whether compulsion was used, and in recent years no such cases have been independently verified.\n\nIn 2006 two journalists of the Fox News Network were kidnapped at gunpoint in the Gaza Strip by a previously unknown militant group. After being forced to read statements on videotape proclaiming that they had converted to Islam, they were released by their captors.\n\nIn August 2009, International Christian Concern reported that four Christians working to help orphans in Somalia were beheaded by Islamist extremists when they refused to convert to Islam.\n\nIn the early 2010s, the Nigerian extremist group Boko Haram is reported to have forced a kidnapped Christian woman to convert to Islam at knifepoint. A Christian woman in 2018 was raped repeatedly by a Boko Haram terrorist for refusing to convert to Islam and her son was killed.\n\nAccording to the UK prison officers' union, some Muslim prisoners in the UK have been forcibly converting fellow inmates to Islam in prisons.\n\nAccording to the \"Daily Mail\", in 2007, commissioner of police Sir Ian Blair stated the police were targeting extremist members of the Muslim community who were allegedly forcing vulnerable girls to convert to Islam in response to claims made by the Hindu Forum. In 2007 a Sikh girl's family claimed that she had been forcibly converted to Islam, and they received a police guard after being attacked by an armed gang, although the \"Police said no one was injured in the incident\".\n\nIn response to these news stories, an open letter to Sir Ian Blair, signed by ten Hindu academics, argued that claims that Hindu and Sikh girls were being forcefully converted were \"part of an arsenal of myths propagated by right-wing Hindu supremacist organisations in India\". The Muslim Council of Britain issued a press release pointing out there is a lack of evidence of any forced conversions and suggested it is an underhand attempt to smear the British Muslim population.\n\nAn academic paper by Katy Sian published in the journal \"South Asian Popular Culture\" in 2011 explored the question of how \"'forced' conversion narratives\" arose around the Sikh diaspora in the United Kingdom. Sian, who reports that claims of conversion through courtship on campuses are widespread in the UK, indicates that rather than relying on actual evidence they primarily rest on the word of \"a friend of a friend\" or on personal anecdote. According to Sian, the narrative is similar to accusations of \"white slavery\" lodged against the Jewish community and foreigners to the UK and the US, with the former having ties to anti-semitism that mirror the Islamophobia betrayed by the modern narrative. Sian expanded on these views in 2013's \"Mistaken Identities, Forced Conversions, and Postcolonial Formations\".\n\nIndian Christians have alleged that \"radical Hindu groups\" in Orissa, India have forced Christian converts from Hinduism to \"revert\" to Hinduism. These \"religious riots\" were largely between two tribal groups in Orissa, one of which was predominantly Hindu and another predominantly Christian, over the assassination of a Hindu leader named Swami Lakshmanananda by Maoists operating as terrorist groups in India (see Naxalite). In the aftermath of the violence, American Christian evangelical groups have claimed that Hindu groups are \"forcibly reverting\" Christians converts from Hinduism back to Hinduism. It has also been alleged that groups have converted poor Muslims and Christians to Hinduism against their will and through allurements. Similarly Hindus claim that Christian missionaries used money and free education to lure Hindus for conversion. There are many conspiracy theories used by church for conversion of Hindus.\n\nUnder the doctrine of state atheism in the Soviet Union, there was a \"government-sponsored program of forced conversion to atheism\" conducted by Communists. This program included the overarching objective to establish not only a fundamentally materialistic conception of the universe, but to foster \"direct and open criticism of the religious outlook\" by means of establishing an \"anti-religious trend\" across the entire school. The Russian Orthodox Church, for centuries the strongest of all Orthodox Churches, was violently suppressed. Revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin wrote that every religious idea and every idea of God \"is unutterable vileness... of the most dangerous kind, 'contagion of the most abominable kind\". Many priests were killed and imprisoned. Thousands of churches were closed, some turned into hospitals. In 1925 the government founded the League of Militant Atheists to intensify the persecution.\n\nChristopher Marsh, a professor at the Baylor University writes that \"Tracing the social nature of religion from Schleiermacher and Feurbach to Marx, Engles, and Lenin...the idea of religion as a social product evolved to the point of policies aimed at the forced conversion of believers to atheism.\"\nJonathan Blake of the Department of Political Science at Columbia University elucidates the history of this practice in the USSR, stating that:\n\nAcross Eastern Europe following World War II, the parts of the Nazi Empire conquered by the Soviet Red Army, and Yugsolavia became one party Communist states and the project of coercive conversion continued. The Soviet Union ended its war time truce against the Russian Orthodox Church, and extended its persecutions to the newly Communist Eastern bloc: \"In Poland, Hungary, Lithuania and other Eastern European countries, Catholic leaders who were unwilling to be silent were denounced, publicly humiliated or imprisoned by the Communists. Leaders of the national Orthodox Churches in Romania and Bulgaria had to be cautious and submissive\", wrote Blainey. While the churches were generally not as severely treated as they had been in the USSR, nearly all their schools and many of their churches were closed, and they lost their formally prominent roles in public life. Children were taught atheism, and clergy were imprisoned by the thousands.\n\nIn the Eastern Bloc, Christian churches, Jewish synagogues and Islamic mosques were forcibly \"converted into museums of atheism.\" Historical essayist expounds upon this situation, specifically in the Socialist Republic of Romania, writing that scientific atheism was \"aggressively applied to Moldova, immediately after the 1940 annexation, when churches were profaned, clergy assaulted, and signs and public symbols of religion were prohibited\"; he provides an example of this phenomenon, further writing that \"St. Theodora Church in downtown Chişinău was converted into the city's Museum of Scientific Atheism\". Marxist-Leninist regimes treated religious believers as subversives or abnormal, sometimes relegating them to psychiatric hospitals and reeducation. Nevertheless, historian Emily Baran writes that \"some accounts suggest the conversion to militant atheism did not always end individuals' existential questions\".\n\nDuring the French Revolution, a campaign of dechristianization happened which included removal and destruction of religious objects from places of worship; English librarian Thomas Hartwell Horne and biblical scholar Samuel Davidson write that \"churches were converted into 'temples of reason,' in which atheistical and licesntious homilies were substituted for the proscribed service\".\n\nUnlike later establishments of state atheism by communist regimes, the French Revolutionary experiment was short (7 months), incomplete and inconsistent. Although brief, the French experiment was particularly notable for the influence upon atheists Ludwig Feuerbach, Sigmund Freud and Karl Marx.\n\nThe emergence of Communist states across East Asia after World War Two saw religion purged by atheist regimes across China, North Korea and much of Indo-China. In 1949, China became a Communist state under the leadership of Mao Zedong's Communist Party of China. China itself had been a cradle of religious thought since ancient times, being the birthplace of Confucianism and Daoism, and Buddhists having arrived in the first century AD. Under Mao, China became officially atheist, and though some religious practices were permitted to continue under State supervision, religious groups deemed a threat to order have been suppressed—as with Tibetan Buddhism from 1959 and Falun Gong in recent years. Religious schools and social institutions were closed, foreign missionaries expelled, and local religious practices discouraged. During the Cultural Revolution, Mao instigated \"struggles\" against the Four Olds: \"old ideas, customs, culture, and habits of mind\". In 1999, the Communist Party launched a three-year drive to promote atheism in Tibet, saying intensifying propaganda on atheism is \"especially important for Tibet because atheism plays an extremely important role in promoting economic construction, social advancement and socialist spiritual civilization in the region\".\n\nArticles 3, 5, 24, 27, and 130 of the Mexican Constitution of 1917 as originally enacted were anticlerical and enormously restricted religious freedoms. At first the anticlerical provisions were only sporadically enforced, but when President Plutarco Elías Calles took office, he enforced the provisions strictly. Calles' Mexico has been characterized as an atheist state and his program as being one to eradicate religion in Mexico.\n\nAll religions had their properties expropriated, and these became part of government wealth. There was a forced expulsion of foreign clergy and the seizure of Church properties. Article 27 prohibited any future acquisition of such property by the churches, and prohibited religious corporations and ministers from\nestablishing or directing primary schools. This second prohibition was sometimes interpreted to mean that the Church could not give religious instruction to children within the churches on Sundays, seen as destroying the ability of Catholics to be educated in their own religion.\n\nThe Constitution of 1917 also closed and forbade the existence of monastic orders (article 5), forbade any religious activity outside of church buildings (now owned by the government), and mandated that such religious activity would be overseen by the government (article 24).\n\nOn June 14, 1926, President Calles enacted anticlerical legislation known formally as The Law Reforming the Penal Code and unofficially as the Calles Law. His anti-Catholic actions included outlawing religious orders, depriving the Church of property rights and depriving the clergy of civil liberties, including their right to a trial by jury (in cases involving anti-clerical laws) and the right to vote. Catholic antipathy towards Calles was enhanced because of his vocal atheism. He was also a Freemason. Regarding this period, recent President Vicente Fox stated, \"After 1917, Mexico was led by anti-Catholic Freemasons who tried to evoke the anticlerical spirit of popular indigenous President Benito Juárez of the 1880s. But the military dictators of the 1920s were a more savage lot than Juarez.\"\nDue to the strict enforcement of anti-clerical laws, people in strongly Catholic areas, especially the states of Jalisco, Zacatecas, Guanajuato, Colima and Michoacán, began to oppose him, and this opposition led to the Cristero War from 1926 to 1929, which was characterized by brutal atrocities on both sides. Some Cristeros applied terrorist tactics, while the Mexican government persecuted the clergy, killing suspected Cristeros and supporters and often retaliating against innocent individuals. On May 28, 1926, Calles was awarded a medal of merit from the head of Mexico's Scottish rite of Freemasonry for his actions against the Catholics.\n\nA truce was negotiated with the assistance of U.S. Ambassador Dwight Whitney Morrow. Calles, however, did not abide by the terms of the truce – in violation of its terms, he had approximately 500 Cristero leaders and 5,000 other Cristeros shot, frequently in their homes in front of their spouses and children. Particularly offensive to Catholics after the supposed truce was Calles' insistence on a complete state monopoly on education, suppressing all Catholic education and introducing \"socialist\" education in its place: \"We must enter and take possession of the mind of childhood, the mind of youth.\". The persecution continued as Calles maintained control under his Maximato and did not relent until 1940, when President Manuel Ávila Camacho, a believing Catholic, took office. This attempt to indoctrinate the youth in atheism was begun in 1934 by amending Article 3 to the Mexican Constitution to eradicate religion by mandating \"socialist education\", which \"in addition to removing all religious doctrine\" would \"combat fanaticism and prejudices\", \"build[ing] in the youth a rational and exact concept of the universe and of social life\". In 1946 this \"socialist education\" was removed from the constitution and the document returned to the less egregious generalized secular education.\nThe effects of the war on the Church were profound. Between 1926 and 1934 at least 40 priests were killed. Where there were 4,500 priests operating within the country before the rebellion, in 1934 there were only 334 priests licensed by the government to serve fifteen million people, the rest having been eliminated by emigration, expulsion, and assassination. By 1935, 17 states had no priest at all.\n\n"}

This is a conclusion not only deducible from the natural law binding us to love and to assist one another, but also explicitly contained in positive precept: \"If thy brother shall offend against thee, go, and rebuke him between thee and him alone. If he shall hear thee, thou shalt gain thy brother\" (Matthew 18:15). Given a sufficiently grave condition of spiritual distress calling for succour in this way, this commandment may exact fulfilment under pain of mortal sin.\n\nThe obligation of fraternal correction, so far as private persons go, does not obtain, generally speaking, for the case of one who violates a law through invincible ignorance.\n\nNormally, the duty calls for the reproof to be administered privately. This is plainly the method appointed by Christ in the words just cited and only as a remedy for obduracy is any other contemplated by Him.

{"id": "49721724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49721724", "title": "Frederik van Leenhof", "text": "Frederik van Leenhof\n\nFrederik van Leenhof (1 September 1647 – 13 October 1715) was a Dutch pastor and philosopher active in Zwolle, who caused an international controversy because of his Spinozist work \"Heaven on Earth\" (1703). This controversy is extensively discussed in Jonathan Israel's 2001 book \"Radical Enlightenment\".\n\nLeenhof studied theology in the 1660s at Utrecht University under Voetius, and at Leiden University under Cocceius during the Voetian–Cocceian dispute. He served as pastor in Abbeville (1670–71), Nieuwvliet (1672–78) and Velsen (1680–81), before finally settling in Zwolle in 1681. During his first period of writing from 1673 until 1684, he fervently chose the side of the Cartesio-Cocceians against Voetian fundamentalism. He accused his opponents of smear tactics and straw men, denying the claim 'that out of Descartes' school come atheists and libertines'. However, a letter correspondence with Christopher Wittich (briefly his host in Leiden shortly before 1681), in which Leenhof defended Baruch Spinoza's views on substance and creation, was published after Wittich's death in 1687 without Leenhof's permission under the name \"Anti-Spinoza\". When pressed, he admitted having written them, so by 1681 Leenhof must have already been familiar with Spinoza's thought, and accepted important core concepts of it. His 1684 work \"Keten der Bybelsche Godgeleerdheit\" (\"Chain of Biblical Theology\") was later found to contain typically Spinozist views.\n\nIn his correspondence with Wittich, Leenhof argues that the universe must always have existed; a creation \"ex nihilo\" would violate God's perfect nature. Also, a pure spirit could not logically create substance, therefore God must be one with or present in the physical world, claimed Leenhof, rejecting dualism.\n\nWhilst studying his religion and exploring modern ethics during his second period of writing (1700–04), Leenhof came into contact with the early Enlightenment, which originated in the Dutch Republic around 1650. Amongst other things, he tried to formulate a Stoic and Epicurean system of ethics, with no role for Christian salvation, in his 1700 work \"Prediker\" (\"Preacher\"). Politically, it advocates the rejection of monarchy (\"without doubt the most imperfect [rule]\") and aristocracy, and argues for a republican form of government instead. Hereditary succession is worthless; only reason provides legitimacy, and true sovereignty is the common good of the community. Royal standing armies of mercenaries are to be abolished, lest they be used to oppress the king's subjects; instead, the state should train its citizens and form a militia to be able to defend the common good. Leenhof also opined that morals are universal, and knowable through the use of reason.\n\nIn agreement with Baruch Spinoza (1632–77), Leenhof eventually came to reject belief in a personal god, which was considered heresy in contemporary Christendom. Leenhof's book \"Heaven on Earth\", published simultaneously in Zwolle and Amsterdam in June 1703, is written completely in Spinozist (pantheist) thought, although he always denied being an adherent of the then hugely controversial Spinoza. In fact, the book did not 'refer explicitly to any forbidden philosopher or doctrine', but the unorthodox way in which he presented his ideas, one after the other, almost devoid of any Christian context, caused uproar amongst his readers.\n\nLeenhof opined that every human being could realise heaven on Earth, by judgeing the world according to \"God's order\" (=nature), expressed in the laws of nature, and by reading the gospel. He claimed on linguistic grounds that what Scripture means by 'heaven' and 'hell' are not places or locations, but states of mind. The former is attained when one acquires knowledge of God, which results in a state of stable, enduring happiness. 'Hell' is the feeling when a person does not have adequate knowledge of God, and is therefore unhappy; it is not a physical, divine punishment for sin, but mental suffering that they should try to avoid. The eradication of false ideas and superstitions, such as belief in witches, spirits and ghosts, is a precondition for peace of mind and joy. To achieve this, authorities need to implement a policy of freedom of thought, toleration of other people's (non)religious and philosophical views, and the freedom to express and discuss those opinions without taboo, which will allow the common people to emancipate and enlighten themselves from their ignorance.\n\nHis book was hotly debated by the Zwolle government and the States of Overijssel for quite some time, whilst both Voetians and Cocceians demanded Leenhof to retract it, because it did not refer to God as the saviour, to the Christian faith or revelation. Writings suggest the controversial book was a hot topic amongst common people, remarking that only few had not heard about it. Although a handful of laymen warmly welcomed it, the entire theological, ecclesiastical and political establishment condemned it, and not one of his former Cocceian colleagues defended him. However, an unknown Spinozist by the mysterious pseudonym of \"E. D. M.\" wrote a scathing critique of Leenhof's detractors, titled \"Redenkundige Aanmerkingen\" (\"Rhetorical Remarks\"). It alleges many of the attacks on Leenhof's work are nothing more than attempts to compare it to anything Spinoza wrote and condemn it for that reason, whilst showing even declared anti-Spinozists have adopted some of his ideas. Leenhof's greatest critic, Taco Hajo van den Honert, accused both him and his publisher Barend Hakvoord (also precentor at St. Michael's Church in Zwolle) of having written it, which they denied. During the ongoing controversy about his book, Leenhof often defended himself in writing against numerous accusations concerning his book (the most notable being \"Hemel op Aarde Opgehelderd\", \"Heaven on Earth Clarified\", or simply \"Opheldering\" or \"Clarification\").\n\nOn 20 March 1704, Leenhof took the initiative to convene the Zwolle church council to ask his colleagues' support, and declared that nothing he had written contradicted the teachings of the dominant Dutch Reformed Church, the \"Confessio Belgica\", which he acknowledged were the true path to Salvation, and formally declared that 'I reject whatever is harmful, directly or indirectly, to our teaching in the writings of Spinoza or others'. The consistory backed Leenhof, but the regional classis did not and called for his suspension. Here the burgomasters of Zwolle intervened that nobody from outside the city could decide who could or could not preach what without even having consulted the magistrate, resulting in a great conflict between secular and religious authorities. In May, it reached the provincial level, with Synod of Overijssel claiming \"Heaven on Earth\" was full of the \"soul-destroying ideas in the writings of the damned atheist Spinoza\" that the States General had previously forbidden because of their \"godlessness\", whilst the States of Overijssel stood by the burgomasters of Zwolle. Next, the controversy spread to Frisia, Guelders (in August) and especially Holland, whose synods all condemned Leenhof's work as basically a refurbishment of Spinoza. Then Anthonie Heinsius, Grand Pensionary of Holland (the \"de facto\" head of state of the Dutch Republic during the Second Stadtholderless Period), called for a ban on \"Heaven on Earth\" and Leenhof's later defences, arguing the denial of the true religion would also undermine the State.\n\nMeanwhile, the Zwolle consistory drafted, with Leenhof's help, the ten Articles of Satisfaction, published in August 1704, clarifying that his thought differed from Spinozism, that is to be utterly condemned for its incongruity with Christianity. The Articles were ratified unanimously by the consistory and government of Zwolle, and proclaimed from the pulpits of the city's largest three churches on the first Sunday of November. Again, this failed to placate his critics. The States and Synods outside of Overijssel continued to pressure Zwolle to condemn and ban Leenhof's 'Spinozistic' last three books, which the States of Holland imposed in their own province on 18 December 1706. During a meeting of the States General on 29 December 1706, the other provinces urged Overijssel to impose a similar ban on the books, but the delegates of Overijssel responded that 'this would only provide further encouragement to read them', and stressed their province's autonomy in the matter. In 1708, the Synod of Overijssel called for Leenhof to be fired and excommunicated from the Reformed Church, lest his views led his congregation and others astray, and discussed tighter controls against 'licentious books' in general. The call of censorship of radical writings was echoed by religious and sometimes secular authorities in other provinces as well, although the regenten feared this would strengthen the Church's power at their disadvantage. Sanctions against Zwolle were imposed by several provincial synods in 1708, including that of North Holland and Guelders that no preacher from Zwolle could participate in any church gathering in their regions. Finally, the deadlock in the States of Overijssel was resolved in March 1709, when the majority ruled against the wish of Zwolle that Leenhof had to sign additional Articles of Satisfaction drafted by the synod to utterly repudiate Spinozism. At a synod and States' commissioners' meeting in Deventer in June 1709, Leenhof defiantly denied having ever taught Spinozism, but only orthodoxy, and that he could not retract more than he had already done, and not recant his last three books. After this, Leenhof's books were banned in Overijssel, but the Zwolle magistrate refused to strip him from his pastoral position. In December 1710, they finally requested him to resign, which Leenhof did. However, he remained a popular figure within Zwolle, receiving both salary and sacraments and retaining his preacher's seat in church. His still favoured position led to continued debates and harsh words around the country against the consistory and magistrate of Zwolle. Eventually, a majority in the consistory of Zwolle voted to excommunicate Leenhof in 1712.\n\nAlthough discharged honourably from his pastoral position in 1710, and excommunicated disgracefully in 1712, Leenhof's ideas spread far and wide. \"Heaven on Earth\" was translated in many languages and spread all across Europe, via Germany along the Baltic Sea cities into the Baltic states, Italy, Spain and Portugal.\n\n\n"}

He is a former executive director of the Latino Union.\n\nLandaverde was born into a poor family in La Reina, Chalatenango, El Salvador. He was forced into the jungle to join Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front guerrilla. At 17, he was arrested by the military and severely beaten for organizing among the poor. He fled to Guatemala, Mexico, and ultimately, the United States, where he was given status as a political refugee.\n\nUpon seeing what he perceived as injustices perpetuated against Latinos in the United States, particularly illegal immigrants, day laborers, and those working in temporary agencies, he began working with grassroots organizations to reach out to the exploited community. His leadership led him to co-found the Latino Union in May 2000 in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nInfluenced by the role of his mother as a catechist, and inspired by the martyrdom of Archbishop Óscar Arnulfo Romero, Landaverde studied at Catholic Theological Union, and later in Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary, obtaining his master's in Divinity.\n\nAs he was obtaining his master's, the Northern Illinois Conference of the United Methodist Church appointed him as a pastor in Amor De Dios United Methodist Church in July 2003. One of Landaverde’s main goals was to promote ecumenicism by merging the gap between the Roman Catholicism of Little Village and Protestantism, inspired by the example of John Wesley, the founder of United Methodism.\n\nOne of his controversial strategies was introducing an icon of the Virgin of Guadalupe, a national symbol of patriotism and faith in Mexico. Within the Methodist Church there was support, but also opposition that sparked headlines in newspapers and magazines such as Time. Thinking of Mary as the first disciple of Jesus and keeping in mind Wesley’s view of her as a \"pure and unspotted virgin\", Landaverde ignored the cries of conservative Methodists. The practice was eventually approved by Superintendent Donald F. Guest, but was still frowned upon by many.\n\nAmor De Dios United Methodist Church at the time of his ministry continued financially unstable, at times encouraging Landaverde to donate his paycheck to the church treasury. He expressed discontent toward the Conference, feeling that it left poor churches even more economically vulnerable. His frustration peaked at the criticism displayed by conservative Methodists who insisted that his theology was too \"radical,\" or, conversely, Roman Catholic. The lack of support and resources from the Church inhibited many of his grassroots projects. Finally, in 2006 he retired from his position in the Methodist Church, leaving a trusted lay member, Ramiro Rodríguez, in charge.\n\nLandaverde transferred to the Anglican Catholic Church that same year. In the summer of 2007, he opened up a closed bar in Little Village and remodeled it to become a Spanish-speaking Anglican Catholic mission in Illinois.\n\nLandaverde is known for his grassroots organizing, particularly concerning immigrants' and workers' rights, being the first to popularize the new sanctuary movement in Illinois. He housed immigrants in danger of deportation, most notably Elvira Arellano in 2004, before she took refuge in Adalberto United Methodist church in Humboldt Park in August 2006. He worked with the day laborers of Home Depot and sent truckloads of provisions to New Orleans in 2005 and donated toys and supplies to Tabasco, México in Christmas of 2007.\n\nIn December 2014 Landaverde was arrested and accused of beating a woman in his apartment in Little Village after a night of drinking.\n"}

{"id": "65119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65119", "title": "Laozi", "text": "Laozi\n\nLaozi (; ; ; literally \"Old Master\"; also rendered as Lao Tzu ( or ) and Lao-Tze ()) was an ancient Chinese philosopher and writer. He is the reputed author of the \"Tao Te Ching\", the founder of philosophical Taoism, and a deity in religious Taoism and traditional Chinese religions.\n\nA semi-legendary figure, Laozi was usually portrayed as a 6th-century BC contemporary of Confucius, but some modern historians consider him to have lived during the Warring States period of the 4th century BC. A central figure in Chinese culture, Laozi is claimed by both the emperors of the Tang dynasty and modern people of the Li surname as a founder of their lineage. Laozi's work has been embraced by both various anti-authoritarian movements and Chinese Legalism.\n\nIn traditional accounts, Laozi's personal name is usually given as \"Li Er\"  *\"rəʔ nəʔ\",  \"Lǐ Ěr\") and his courtesy name as \"Boyang\"  *\"Pˤrak-lang\",  \"Bóyáng\"). A prominent posthumous name was \"Li Dan\" \"Lǐ Dān\").\n\nLaozi itself is a honorific title: ( *\"rˤu ʔ\", \"old, venerable\") and ( *\"tsəʔ\", \"master\"). It has been romanized numerous ways, sometimes leading to confusion. The most common present form is \"Laozi\" or \"Lǎozǐ\", based on the Hanyu Pinyin system adopted by Mainland China in 1958 and by Taiwan in 2009. During the 20th century, \"Lao-tzu\" was more common, based on the formerly prevalent Wade–Giles system. In the 19th century, the title was usually romanized as \"Lao-tse\". Other forms include the variants \"Lao-tze\" and \"Lao-tsu\".\n\nAs a religious figure, he is worshipped under the name \"Supreme Old Lord\" , \"Tàishàng Lǎojūn\") and as one of the \"Three Pure Ones.\" During the Tang dynasty, he was granted the title \"Supremely Mysterious and Primordial Emperor\" \"Tàishàng Xuānyuán Huángdì\").\n\nIn the mid-twentieth century, a consensus emerged among scholars that the historicity of the person known as Laozi is doubtful and that the \"Tao Te Ching\" was \"a compilation of Taoist sayings by many hands\". Alan Watts urged more caution, holding that this view was part of an academic fashion for skepticism about historical spiritual and religious figures and stating that not enough would be known for years – or possibly ever – to make a firm judgment.\n\nThe earliest certain reference to the present figure of Laozi is found in the 1st century BC \"Records of the Grand Historian\" collected by the historian Sima Qian from earlier accounts. In one account, Laozi was said to be a contemporary of Confucius during the 6th or 5th century BC. His surname was Li and his personal name was Er or Dan. He was an official in the imperial archives and wrote a book in two parts before departing to the west. In another, Laozi was a different contemporary of Confucius titled Lao Laizi and wrote a book in 15 parts. In a third, he was the court astrologer Lao Dan who lived during the 4th century BC reign of Duke Xian of the Qin Dynasty. The oldest text of the \"Tao Te Ching\" so far recovered was written on bamboo slips and dates to the late 4th century BC; see Guodian Chu Slips.\n\nAccording to traditional accounts, Laozi was a scholar who worked as the Keeper of the Archives for the royal court of Zhou. This reportedly allowed him broad access to the works of the Yellow Emperor and other classics of the time. The stories assert that Laozi never opened a formal school but nonetheless attracted a large number of students and loyal disciples. There are many variations of a story retelling his encounter with Confucius, most famously in the \"Zhuangzi\".\n\nHe was sometimes held to have come from the village of Chu Jen in Chu. In accounts where Laozi married, he was said to have had a son named Zong who became a celebrated soldier.\n\nThe story tells of Zong the Warrior who defeats the enemy and triumphs, and then abandons the corpses of the enemy soldiers to be eaten by vultures. By coincidence Laozi, traveling and teaching the way of the Tao, comes on the scene and is revealed to be the father of Zong, from whom he was separated in childhood. Laozi tells his son that it is better to treat respectfully a beaten enemy, and that the disrespect to their dead would cause his foes to seek revenge. Convinced, Zong orders his soldiers to bury the enemy dead. Funeral mourning is held for the dead of both parties and a lasting peace is made.\n\nMany clans of the Li family trace their descent to Laozi, including the emperors of the Tang dynasty. This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage (隴西李氏). According to the Simpkinses, while many (if not all) of these lineages are questionable, they provide a testament to Laozi's impact on Chinese culture.\n\nThe third story in Sima Qian states that Laozi grew weary of the moral decay of life in Chengzhou and noted the kingdom's decline. He ventured west to live as a hermit in the unsettled frontier at the age of 80. At the western gate of the city (or kingdom), he was recognized by the guard Yinxi. The sentry asked the old master to record his wisdom for the good of the country before he would be permitted to pass. The text Laozi wrote was said to be the \"Tao Te Ching\", although the present version of the text includes additions from later periods. In some versions of the tale, the sentry was so touched by the work that he became a disciple and left with Laozi, never to be seen again. In others, the \"Old Master\" journeyed all the way to India and was the teacher of Siddartha Gautama, the Buddha. Others say he was the Buddha himself.\nA seventh-century work, the \"Sandong Zhunang\" (\"Pearly Bag of the Three Caverns\"), embellished the relationship between Laozi and Yinxi. Laozi pretended to be a farmer when reaching the western gate, but was recognized by Yinxi, who asked to be taught by the great master. Laozi was not satisfied by simply being noticed by the guard and demanded an explanation. Yinxi expressed his deep desire to find the \"Tao\" and explained that his long study of astrology allowed him to recognize Laozi's approach. Yinxi was accepted by Laozi as a disciple. This is considered an exemplary interaction between Taoist master and disciple, reflecting the testing a seeker must undergo before being accepted. A would-be adherent is expected to prove his determination and talent, clearly expressing his wishes and showing that he had made progress on his own towards realizing the \"Tao\".\n\nThe \"Pearly Bag of the Three Caverns\" continues the parallel of an adherent's quest. Yinxi received his ordination when Laozi transmitted the \"Tao Te Ching\", along with other texts and precepts, just as Taoist adherents receive a number of methods, teachings and scriptures at ordination. This is only an initial ordination and Yinxi still needed an additional period to perfect his virtue, thus Laozi gave him three years to perfect his Tao. Yinxi gave himself over to a full-time devotional life. After the appointed time, Yinxi again demonstrates determination and perfect trust, sending out a black sheep to market as the agreed sign. He eventually meets again with Laozi, who announces that Yinxi's immortal name is listed in the heavens and calls down a heavenly procession to clothe Yinxi in the garb of immortals. The story continues that Laozi bestowed a number of titles upon Yinxi and took him on a journey throughout the universe, even into the nine heavens. After this fantastic journey, the two sages set out to western lands of the barbarians. The training period, reuniting and travels represent the attainment of the highest religious rank in medieval Taoism called \"Preceptor of the Three Caverns\". In this legend, Laozi is the perfect Taoist master and Yinxi is the ideal Taoist student. Laozi is presented as the \"Tao\" personified, giving his teaching to humanity for their salvation. Yinxi follows the formal sequence of preparation, testing, training and attainment.\n\nThe story of Laozi has taken on strong religious overtones since the Han dynasty. As Taoism took root, Laozi was worshipped as a god. Belief in the revelation of the \"Tao\" from the divine Laozi resulted in the formation of the Way of the Celestial Masters, the first organized religious Taoist sect. In later mature Taoist tradition, Laozi came to be seen as a personification of the \"Tao\". He is said to have undergone numerous \"transformations\" and taken on various guises in various incarnations throughout history to initiate the faithful in the Way. Religious Taoism often holds that the \"Old Master\" did not disappear after writing the \"Tao Te Ching\" but rather spent his life traveling and revealing the \"Tao\".\n\nTaoist myths state that Laozi was conceived when his mother gazed upon a falling star. He supposedly remained in her womb for 62 years before being born while his mother was leaning against a plum tree. (The Chinese surname Li shares its character with \"plum\".) Laozi was said to have emerged as a grown man with a full grey beard and long earlobes, both symbols of wisdom and long life. Other myths state that he was reborn 13 times after his first life during the days of Fuxi. In his last incarnation as Laozi, he lived nine hundred and ninety years and spent his life traveling to reveal the \"Tao\".\n\nLaozi is traditionally regarded as the author of the \"Tao Te Ching\" (\"Daodejing\"), though the identity of its author(s) or compiler(s) has been debated throughout history. It is one of the most significant treatises in Chinese cosmogony. As with most other ancient Chinese philosophers, Laozi often explains his ideas by way of paradox, analogy, appropriation of ancient sayings, repetition, symmetry, rhyme, and rhythm. In fact, the whole book can be read as an analogy – the ruler is the awareness, or self, in meditation and the myriad creatures or empire is the experience of the body, senses and desires.\n\nThe \"Tao Te Ching\", often called simply \"Laozi\" after its reputed author, describes the \"Dao\" (or \"Tao\") as the source and ideal of all existence: it is unseen, but not transcendent, immensely powerful yet supremely humble, being the root of all things. People have desires and free will (and thus are able to alter their own nature). Many act \"unnaturally\", upsetting the natural balance of the Tao. The \"Tao Te Ching\" intends to lead students to a \"return\" to their natural state, in harmony with Tao. Language and conventional wisdom are critically assessed. Taoism views them as inherently biased and artificial, widely using paradoxes to sharpen the point.\n\nLivia Kohn provides an example of how Laozi encouraged a change in approach, or return to \"nature\", rather than action. Technology may bring about a false sense of progress. The answer provided by Laozi is not the rejection of technology, but instead seeking the calm state of \"wu wei\", free from desires. This relates to many statements by Laozi encouraging rulers to keep their people in \"ignorance\", or \"simple-minded\". Some scholars insist this explanation ignores the religious context, and others question it as an apologetic of the philosophical coherence of the text. It would not be unusual political advice if Laozi literally intended to tell rulers to keep their people ignorant. However, some terms in the text, such as \"valley spirit\" (\"gushen\") and \"soul\" (\"po\"), bear a metaphysical context and cannot be easily reconciled with a purely ethical reading of the work.\n\n\"Wu wei\" (無爲), literally \"non-action\" or \"not acting\", is a central concept of the \"Tao Te Ching\". The concept of \"wu wei\" is multifaceted, and reflected in the words' multiple meanings, even in English translation; it can mean \"not doing anything\", \"not forcing\", \"not acting\" in the theatrical sense, \"creating nothingness\", \"acting spontaneously\", and \"flowing with the moment.\"\n\nIt is a concept used to explain \"ziran\" (自然), or harmony with the \"Tao\". It includes the concepts that value distinctions are ideological and seeing ambition of all sorts as originating from the same source. Laozi used the term broadly with simplicity and humility as key virtues, often in contrast to selfish action. On a political level, it means avoiding such circumstances as war, harsh laws and heavy taxes. Some Taoists see a connection between \"wu wei\" and esoteric practices, such as \"zuowang\" \"sitting in oblivion\" (emptying the mind of bodily awareness and thought) found in the Zhuangzi.\n\nLaozi is traditionally regarded as the founder of Taoism, intimately connected with the \"Tao Te Ching\" and \"primordial\" (or \"original\") Taoism. Popular (\"religious\") Taoism typically presents the Jade Emperor as the official head deity. Intellectual (\"elite\") Taoists, such as the Celestial Masters sect, usually present Laozi (\"Laojun\", \"Lord Lao\") and the Three Pure Ones at the top of the pantheon of deities.\n\nPotential officials throughout Chinese history drew on the authority of non-Confucian sages, especially Laozi and Zhuangzi, to deny serving any ruler at any time. Zhuangzi, Laozi's most famous follower in traditional accounts, had a great deal of influence on Chinese literati and culture.\n\nPolitical theorists influenced by Laozi have advocated humility in leadership and a restrained approach to statecraft, either for ethical and pacifist reasons, or for tactical ends. In a different context, various anti-authoritarian movements have embraced the Laozi teachings on the power of the weak.\n\nLaozi was a proponent of limited government. Left-libertarians in particular have been influenced by Laozi – in his 1937 book \"Nationalism and Culture\", the anarcho-syndicalist writer and activist Rudolf Rocker praised Laozi's \"gentle wisdom\" and understanding of the opposition between political power and the cultural activities of the people and community. In his 1910 article for the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", Peter Kropotkin also noted that Laozi was among the earliest proponents of essentially anarchist concepts. More recently, anarchists such as John P. Clark and Ursula K. Le Guin have written about the conjunction between anarchism and Taoism in various ways, highlighting the teachings of Laozi in particular. In her rendition of the Tao Te Ching, Le Guin writes that Laozi \"does not see political power as magic. He sees rightful power as earned and wrongful power as usurped... He sees sacrifice of self or others as a corruption of power, and power as available to anyone who follows the Way. No wonder anarchists and Taoists make good friends.\"\n\nThe right-libertarian economist Murray Rothbard suggested that Laozi was the first libertarian, likening Laozi's ideas on government to Friedrich Hayek's theory of spontaneous order. James A. Dorn agreed, writing that Laozi, like many 18th-century liberals, \"argued that minimizing the role of government and letting individuals develop spontaneously would best achieve social and economic harmony.\" Similarly, the Cato Institute's David Boaz includes passages from the \"Tao Te Ching\"' in his 1997 book \"The Libertarian Reader\". Philosopher Roderick Long, however, argues that libertarian themes in Taoist thought are actually borrowed from earlier Confucian writers.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "84024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=84024", "title": "Matrilineality", "text": "Matrilineality\n\nMatrilineality is the tracing of descent through the female line. It may also correlate with a societal system in which each person is identified with their matriline – their mother's lineage – and which can involve the inheritance of property and/or titles. A matriline is a line of descent from a female ancestor to a descendant (of either sex) in which the individuals in all intervening generations are mothersin other words, a \"mother line\". In a matrilineal descent system, an individual is considered to belong to the same descent group as their mother. This matrilineal descent pattern is in contrast to the more common pattern of patrilineal descent from which a family name is usually derived. The \"matriline\" of historical nobility was also called their enatic or uterine ancestry, corresponding to the patrilineal or \"agnatic\" ancestry.\n\nIn some traditional societies and cultures, membership in their groups was – and, in the following list, still \"is\" if shown in \"italics\" – inherited matrilineally. Examples include the Cherokee, Choctaw, \"Gitksan\", Haida, Hopi, Iroquois, Lenape, Navajo and Tlingit of North America; the \"Kuna people\" of Panama; the \"Kogi\" and Carib of South America; the \"Minangkabau\" people of West Sumatra, Indonesia and Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia; the \"Trobrianders\", \"Dobu\" and \"Nagovisi\" of Melanesia; the Nairs of Kerala and the Bunts and Billava of Karnataka in south India; the \"Khasi\", \"Jaintia\" and \"Garo\" of Meghalaya in northeast India; the \"Ngalops\" and \"Sharchops\" of Bhutan; \"Muslims\" and the \"Tamils\" in eastern Sri Lanka; the \"Mosuo\" of China; the \"Kayah\" of Southeast Asia, the Basques of Spain and France; the \"Akan\" including the \"Ashanti\" of west Africa; virtually all groups across the so-called \"matrilineal belt\" of south-central Africa; the \"Tuareg\" of west and north Africa; the \"Serer\" of Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania; and most \"Jewish\" communities.\n\nIn the late 19th century, almost all prehistorians and anthropologists believed, following Lewis H. Morgan's influential book \"Ancient Society\", that early human kinship was everywhere matrilineal. This idea was taken up by Friedrich Engels in \"The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State\". The Morgan-Engels thesis that humanity's earliest domestic institution was not the family but the matrilineal clan soon became incorporated into communist orthodoxy. In reaction, most 20th century social anthropologists considered the theory of matrilineal priority untenable, although during the 1970s and 1980s, a range of feminist scholars often attempted to revive it.\n\nIn recent years, evolutionary biologists, geneticists and palaeoanthropologists have been reassessing the issues, many citing genetic and other evidence that early human kinship may have been matrilineal after all. One crucial piece of indirect evidence has been genetic data suggesting that over thousands of years, women among sub-Saharan African hunter-gatherers have chosen to reside postmaritally not with their husbands' family but with their own mother and other natal kin. Another line of argument is that when sisters and their mothers help each other with childcare, the descent line tends to be matrilineal rather than patrilineal. Biological anthropologists are now widely agreed that cooperative childcare was a development crucial in making possible the evolution of the unusually large human brain and characteristically human psychology.\n\n\"Matrilineal\" surnames are names transmitted from mother to daughter, in contrast to the more familiar \"patrilineal surnames\" transmitted from father to son, the pattern most common among family names today. For clarity and for brevity, the scientific terms \"patrilineal surname\" and \"matrilineal surname\" are usually abbreviated as \"patriname\" and \"matriname\".\n\nThere appears to be some evidence for the presence of matrilineality in Pre-Islamic Arabia, in a very limited number of the Arabian peoples (first of all among the Amorites of Yemen, and among some strata of Nabateans in Northern Arabia); on the other hand, there does not seem to be any reliable evidence for the presence of matrilineality in Islamic Arabia, although the Fatimid Caliphate claimed succession from the Islamic Prophet Mohammad via his daughter Fatima.\n\nA modern example from South Africa is the order of succession to the position of the Rain Queen in a culture of matrilineal primogeniture: not only is dynastic descent reckoned through the female line, but only females are eligible to inherit.\n\nMost of the example cultures in this article are based on (matrilineal) clans. Any clan might possibly contain from one to several or many \"descent groups\" or \"family groups\" – i.e., any matrilineal clan might be descended from one or several or many unrelated female ancestors. Also, each such descent group might have its own family name or \"surname\", as one possible cultural pattern. The following two example cultures each follow a different pattern, however:\n\nExample 1. Members of the (matrilineal) clan culture Minangkabau do not even have a \"surname\" or \"family name\", see this culture's own section below. In contrast, members do have a \"clan name\", which is important in their lives although not included in the member's name. Instead, one's name is just one's given name.\n\nExample 2. Members of the (matrilineal) clan culture Akan, see its own section below, also do not have matrilineal \"surnames\" and likewise their important \"clan name\" is not included in their name. However, members' names do commonly include second names which \"are called surnames\" but which are \"not\" routinely passed down from either father or mother to all their children as a \"family name\".\n\nNote well that if a culture did include one's \"clan name\" in one's name and routinely handed it down to all children in the \"descent group\" then it would automatically be the \"family name\" or \"surname\" for one's descent group (as well as for all other descent groups in one's clan).\n\nWhile a \"mother\" normally takes care of her own children in all cultures, in some matrilineal cultures an \"uncle-father\" will take care of his nieces and nephews instead: in other words \"social fathers\" here are uncles. There is a disconnection between the role of father and genitor (who in the general case may be unknown anyway). In such matrilineal cultures, especially where residence is also matrilocal, a man will exercise guardianship rights not over the children he fathers but exclusively over his sisters' children, who are viewed as 'his own flesh'. These children's biological father – unlike an uncle who is their mother's brother and thus their caregiver – is in some sense a 'stranger' to them, even when affectionate and emotionally close. This may be true for the traditional Akan culture below, for example.\n\nAccording to Steven Pinker, attributing to Kristen Hawkes, among foraging groups matrilocal societies are less likely to commit female infanticide than are patrilocal societies.\n\nWhile men held positions of religious and political power, Spartan constitution mandated that inheritance and proprietorship pass from mother to daughter.\n\nOccupied for 10,000 years by Native Americans, the land that would become New Jersey was overseen by clans of the Lenape or Lenni Lenape or Delaware, who farmed, fished, and hunted upon it. The pattern of their culture was that of a matrilineal agricultural and mobile hunting society that was sustained with fixed, but not permanent, settlements in their \"matrilineal clan\" territories. Leadership by men was inherited through the maternal line, and the women elders held the power to remove leaders of whom they disapproved.\n\nVillages were established and relocated as the clans farmed new sections of the land when soil fertility lessened and when they moved among their fishing and hunting grounds by seasons. The area was claimed as a part of the Dutch New Netherland province dating from 1614, where active trading in furs took advantage of the natural pass west, but the Lenape prevented permanent settlement beyond what is now Jersey City.\n\n\"Early Europeans who first wrote about these Indians found matrilineal social organization to be unfamiliar and perplexing. ... As a result, the early records are full of 'clues' about early Lenape society, but were usually written by observers who did not fully understand what they were seeing.\"\n\nThe Hopi (in what is now the Hopi Reservation in northeastern Arizona), according to Alice Schlegel, had as its \"gender ideology ... one of female superiority, and it operated within a social actuality of sexual equality.\" According to LeBow (based on Schlegel's work), in the Hopi, \"gender roles ... are egalitarian ... [and] [n]either sex is inferior.\" LeBow concluded that Hopi women \"participate fully in ... political decision-making.\" According to Schlegel, \"the Hopi no longer live as they are described here\" and \"the attitude of female superiority is fading\". Schlegel said the Hopi \"were and still are matrilinial\" and \"the household ... was matrilocal\".\n\nSchlegel explains why there was female superiority as that the Hopi believed in \"life as the highest good ... [with] the female principle ... activated in women and in Mother Earth ... as its source\" and that the Hopi \"were not in a state of continual war with equally matched neighbors\" and \"had no standing army\" so that \"the Hopi lacked the spur to masculine superiority\" and, within that, as that women were central to institutions of clan and household and predominated \"within the economic and social systems (in contrast to male predominance within the political and ceremonial systems)\", the Clan Mother, for example, being empowered to overturn land distribution by men if she felt it was unfair, since there was no \"countervailing ... strongly centralized, male-centered political structure\".\n\nThe Iroquois Confederacy or League, combining five to six Native American Haudenosaunee nations or tribes before the U.S. became a nation, operated by The Great Binding Law of Peace, a constitution by which women retained matrilineal-rights and participated in the League's political decision-making, including deciding whether to proceed to war, through what may have been a matriarchy or \"'gyneocracy'\". The dates of this constitution's operation are unknown: the League was formed in approximately 1000–1450, but the constitution was oral until written in about 1880. The League still exists.\n\nSome 20 million Akan live in Africa, particularly in Ghana and Ivory Coast. (See as well their subgroup, the Ashanti, also called Asante.) Many but not all of the Akan still (2001) practice their traditional matrilineal customs, living in their traditional extended family households, as follows. The traditional Akan economic, political and social organization is based on matrilineal lineages, which are the basis of inheritance and succession. A lineage is defined as all those related by matrilineal descent from a particular ancestress. Several lineages are grouped into a \"political unit\" headed by a chief and a council of elders, each of whom is the elected head of a lineage — which itself may include multiple extended-family households. Public offices are thus vested in the lineage, as are land tenure and other lineage property. In other words, lineage property is inherited only by matrilineal kin.\n\n\"The principles governing inheritance stress sex, generation and age — that is to say, men come before women and seniors before juniors.\" When a woman’s brothers are available, a consideration of generational seniority stipulates that the line of brothers be exhausted before the right to inherit lineage property passes down to the next senior genealogical generation of sisters' sons. Finally, \"it is when all possible male heirs have been exhausted that the females\" may inherit.\n\nEach lineage controls the lineage land farmed by its members, functions together in the veneration of its ancestors, supervises marriages of its members, and settles internal disputes among its members.\n\nThe political units above are likewise grouped into eight larger groups called \"abusua\" (similar to clans), named Aduana, Agona, Asakyiri, Asenie, Asona, Bretuo, Ekuona and Oyoko. The members of each \"abusua\" are united by their belief that they are all descended from the same ancient ancestress. Marriage between members of the same \"abusua\" is forbidden. One inherits or is a lifelong member of the lineage, the political unit, and the \"abusua\" of one's mother, regardless of one's gender and/or marriage. Note that members and their spouses thus belong to different \"abusuas\", mother and children living and working in one household and their husband/father living and working in a different household.\n\nAccording to this source of further information about the Akan, \"A man is strongly related to his mother's brother (wɔfa) but only weakly related to his father's brother. This must be viewed in the context of a polygamous society in which the mother/child bond is likely to be much stronger than the father/child bond. As a result, in inheritance, a man's nephew (sister's son) will have priority over his own son. Uncle-nephew relationships therefore assume a dominant position.\"\n\nCertain other aspects of the Akan culture are determined patrilineally rather than matrilineally. There are 12 patrilineal Ntoro (which means spirit) groups, and everyone belongs to their father's Ntoro group but not to his (matrilineal) family lineage and \"abusua\". Each patrilineal Ntoro group has its own surnames, taboos, ritual purifications, and etiquette.\n\nA recent (2001) book provides this update on the Akan: Some families are changing from the above \"abusua\" structure to the nuclear family. Housing, childcare, education, daily work, and elder care etc. are then handled by that individual family rather than by the \"abusua\" or clan, especially in the city. The above taboo on marriage within one's abusua is sometimes ignored, but \"clan membership\" is still important, with many people still living in the \"abusua\" framework presented above.\n\nThe Tuareg (Arabic:طوارق, sometimes spelled Touareg in French, or Twareg in English) are a large Berber ethnic confederation found across several nations in north Africa, including Niger, Mali and Algeria. The Tuareg are \"clan\"-based, and are (still, in 2007) \"largely matrilineal\". The Tuareg are Muslim, but mixed with a \"heavy dose\" of their pre-existing beliefs including matrilineality.\n\nTuareg women enjoy high status within their society, compared with their Arab counterparts and with other Berber tribes: Tuareg social status is transmitted through women, with residence often matrilocal. Most women could read and write, while most men were illiterate, concerning themselves mainly with herding livestock and other male activities. The livestock and other movable property were owned by the women, whereas personal property is owned and inherited regardless of gender. In contrast to most other Muslim cultural groups, men wear veils but women do not. This custom is discussed in more detail in the Tuareg article's clothing section, which mentions it may be the protection needed against the blowing sand while traversing the Sahara desert.\n\nThe Serer people of Senegal, the Gambia and Mauritania are patrilineal (\"simanGol\" in Serer language) as well as matrilineal (\"tim\" ). There are several Serer matriclans and . Some of these matriarchs include Fatim Beye (1335) and Ndoye Demba (1367) — matriarchs of the Joos matriclan which also became a dynasty in Waalo (Senegal). Some matriclans or maternal clans form part of Serer medieval and history, such as the Guelowars. The most revered clans tend to be rather ancient and form part of Serer ancient history. These proto-Serer clans hold great significance in Serer religion and mythology. Some of these proto-Serer matriclans include the \"Cegandum\" and \"Kagaw\", whose historical account is enshrined in Serer religion, mythology and traditions.\n\nIn Serer culture, inheritance is both matrilineal and patrilineal. It all depends on the asset being inherited — i.e. whether the asset is a paternal asset — requiring paternal inheritance (\"kucarla\" ) or a maternal asset — requiring maternal inheritance (\"den yaay\" or \"ƭeen yaay\" ). The actual handling of these maternal assets (such as jewelry, land, livestock, equipment or furniture, etc.) is discussed in the subsection Role of the Tokoor of one of the above-listed main articles.\n\nThe Berber inhabitants of Gran Canaria island had developed a matrilineal society by the time the Canary Islands and their people, called Guanches, were conquered by the Spanish.\n\nMatrilineality among the Muslims and Tamils in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka arrived from Kerala, India via Muslim traders before 1200 CE. Matrilineality here includes kinship and social organization, inheritance and property rights. For example, \"the mother's dowry property and/or house is passed on to the eldest daughter.\" The Sinhalese people are the third ethnic group in eastern Sri Lanka, and have a kinship system which is \"intermediate\" between that of matrilineality and that of patrilineality, along with \"bilateral inheritance\" (in some sense intermediate between matrilineal and patrilineal inheritance). While the first two groups speak the Tamil language, the third group speaks the Sinhalese language. The Tamils largely identify with Hinduism, the Sinhalese being primarily Buddhist. The three groups are about equal in population size.\nPatriarchal social structures apply to all of Sri Lanka, but in the Eastern Province are mixed with the matrilineal features summarized in the paragraph above and described more completely in the following subsection:\n\nAccording to Kanchana N. Ruwanpura, Eastern Sri Lanka \"is highly regarded even among\" feminist economists \"for the relatively favourable position of its women, reflected\" in women's equal achievements in Human Development Indices \"(HDIs) as well as matrilineal and\" bilateral \"inheritance patterns and property rights\".\nShe also conversely argues that \"\"feminist economists\" need to be cautious in applauding Sri Lanka's gender-based achievements and/or matrilineal communities\", because these matrilineal communities coexist with \"\"patriarchal\" structures and ideologies\" and the two \"can be strange but ultimately compatible bedfellows\", as follows:\n\nShe \"positions Sri Lankan women within gradations of \"patriarchy\" by beginning with a brief overview of the main religious traditions,\" Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam, \"and the ways in which patriarchal interests are promoted through religious practice\" in Eastern Sri Lanka (but without being as repressive as classical patriarchy). Thus, \"feminists have claimed that Sri Lankan women are relatively well positioned in the\" South Asian region, despite \"patriarchal institutional laws that ... are likely to work against the interests of women,\" which is a \"co-operative conflict\" between women and these laws. (Clearly \"female-heads have no legal recourse\" from these laws which state \"patriarchal interests\".) For example, \"the economic welfare of female-heads [heads of households] depends upon networks\" (\"of kin and [matrilineal] community\"), \"networks that mediate the patriarchal-ideological nexus.\" She wrote that \"some female heads possessed\" \"feminist consciousness\" and, at the same time, that \"in many cases female-heads are not vociferous feminists ... but rather 'victims' of patriarchal relations and structures that place them in precarious positions... [while] they have held their ground ... [and] provided for their children\".\n\nOn the other hand, she also wrote that feminists including Malathi de Alwis and Kumari Jayawardena have criticized a romanticized view of women's lives in Sri Lanka put forward by Yalman, and mentioned the Sri Lankan case \"where young women raped (usually by a man) are married-off/required to cohabit with the rapists!\"\n\nIn the Minangkabau matrilineal clan culture in Indonesia, a person's clan name is important in their marriage and their other cultural-related events. Two totally unrelated people who share the same clan name can never be married because they are considered to be from the same clan mother (unless they come from distant villages). Likewise, when Minangs meet total strangers who share the same clan name, anywhere in Indonesia, they could theoretically expect to feel that they are distant relatives. Minang people do not have a family name or surname; neither is one's important clan name included in one's name; instead one's given name is the only name one has.\n\nThe Minangs are one of the world's largest matrilineal societies/cultures/ethnic groups, with a population of 4 million in their home province West Sumatra in Indonesia and about 4 million elsewhere, mostly in Indonesia. The Minang people are well-known within their country for their tradition of matrilineality and for their \"dedication to Islam\" — despite Islam being \"supposedly patrilineal\". This well-known accommodation, between their traditional complex of customs, called adat, and their religion, was actually worked out to help end the Minangkabau 1821-37 Padri War. This source is available online.\n\nAs further described in the same online source, their (matrilineal) \"adat\" and their Islam religion each help the other to avoid the extremes of some modern global trends: Their strong belief in and practice of \"adat\" helps their Islam religion to \"not\" adopt a \"simplistic anti-Western\" version of Islam, while their strong belief in and practice of both Islam and \"adat\" helps the Minangs to limit or avoid some undesired effects of modern global capitalism.\n\nThe Minangkabau are a prime example of a matrilineal culture with female inheritance. With Islamic religious background of complementarianism and places a greater number of men than women in positions of religious and political power. Inheritance and proprietorship pass from mother to daughter. The society of Minangkabau exhibits the ability of societies to lack rape culture without social equity of genders.\n\nBesides Minangkabau, several other ethnics in Indonesia are also matrilineal and have similar culture as the Minangkabau. They are Suku Melayu Bebilang, Suku Kubu and Kerinci people. Suku Melayu Bebilang live in Kota Teluk Kuantan, Kabupaten Kuantan Singingi (also known as Kuansing), Riau. They have similar culture as the Minang. Suku Kubu people live in Jambi and South Sumatera. They are around 200 000 people. Suku Kerinci people mostly live in Kabupaten Kerinci, Jambi. They are around 300 000 people --\n\nOriginally, Chinese surnames were derived matrilineally, although by the time of the Shang dynasty (1600 to 1046 BCE) they had become patrilineal.\n\nArchaeological data supports the theory that during the Neolithic period (7000 to 2000 BCE) in China, Chinese matrilineal clans evolved into the usual patrilineal families by passing through a transitional patrilineal clan phase. Evidence includes some \"richly furnished\" tombs for young women in the early Neolithic Yangshao culture, whose multiple other collective burials imply a matrilineal clan culture. Toward the late Neolithic period, when burials were apparently of couples, \"a reflection of patriarchy\", an increasing elaboration of presumed chiefs' burials is reported.\n\nRelatively isolated ethnic minorities such as the Mosuo (Na) in southwestern China are highly matrilineal, and use matrilineal \"family names\", i.e., matrinames. (See the General practice section of the Mosuo article.)\n\nMost ethnic groups classified as \"(Montagnards, Malayo-Polynesian and Austroasian)\" are matrilineal.\n\nOn North Vietnam, according to Alessandra Chiricosta, the legend of Âu Cơ is said to be evidence of \"the presence of an original 'matriarchy' ... and [it] led to the double kinship system, which developed there ... [and which] combined matrilineal and patrilineal patterns of family structure and assigned equal importance to both lines.\"\n\nOf communities recognized in the national Constitution as Scheduled Tribes, \"some ... [are] matriarchal and matrilineal\" \"and thus have been known to be more egalitarian.\" Several communities in South India practiced matrilineality, especially the Tiyyas and Nair (or \"Nayar\") in the state of Kerala, and the Bunts and Billava in the states of Kerala and Karnataka. The system of inheritance was known as Marumakkathayam in the \"Nair\" community or Aliyasantana in the \"Bunt\" and the Billava community, and both communities were subdivided into clans. This system was exceptional in the sense that it was one of the few traditional systems in western historical records of India that gave women some liberty and the right to property.\n\nIn the matrilineal system, the family lived together in a tharavadu which was composed of a mother, her brothers and younger sisters, and her children. The oldest male member was known as the \"karanavar\" and was the head of the household, managing the family estate. Lineage was traced through the mother, and the children belonged to the mother's family. All family property was jointly owned. In the event of a partition, the shares of the children were clubbed with that of the mother. The karanavar's property was inherited by his sisters' sons rather than his own sons. (For further information see the articles Nair and Bunts and Billava.) Amitav Ghosh has stated that, although there were numerous other matrilineal succession systems in communities of the south Indian coast, the Nairs \"achieved an unparalleled eminence in the anthropological literature on matrilineality\".\n\nThe Marumakkathayam system is not very common in Kerala and Karnataka these days for many reasons. Society has become much more cosmopolitan and modern. Men seek jobs away from their hometown and take their wives and children along with them. In this scenario, a joint-family system is no longer viable. But conceivably, there might still be a few tharavads that pay homage to this system.\n\nIn the northeast Indian state Meghalaya, the Khasi, Garo, Jaintia people have a long tradition of a largely matrilinear system in which the youngest daughter inherits the wealth of the parents and takes over their care.\n\nA culture similar to the \"Minangkabau's\", above, is present in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia, ever since West Sumatrans settled there in the 15th century (1400's).\n\nSome oceanic societies, such as the Marshallese and the Trobrianders, the Palauans, the Yapese and the Siuai, are characterized by matrilineal descent. The sister's sons or the brothers of the decedent are commonly the successors in these societies.\n\nMatrilineality in Judaism or matrilineal descent in Judaism is the tracing of Jewish descent through the maternal line. Virtually all Jewish communities have followed matrilineal descent from at least early Tannaitic (c. 10-70 CE) times to Modern times. The origins and date-of-origin of matrilineal descent in Judaism are uncertain. Orthodox Jews, who believe that matrilineality and matriarchy within Judaism are related to the metaphysical concept of the Jewish soul, maintain that matrilineal descent is an Oral Law from at least the time of the Receiving of the Torah on Mt. Sinai (c. 1310 BCE). Conservative Jewish Theologian Rabbi Louis Jacobs suggests that the marriage practices of the Jewish community were re-stated as a law of matrilineal descent in the early Tannaitic Period (c. 10-70 CE).\n\nThe law of matrilineal descent was first codified, as all Jewish Oral Law, in the Mishnah (c. 2nd century CE). The Talmud (c. 500 CE) adduces the law of matrilineal descent from Deuteronomy: you shall not intermarry with them: you shall not give your daughter to his son, and you shall not take his daughter for your son. For he will turn away your son from following Me, and they will worship the gods of others… Conservative Jewish Theologian Rabbi Louis Jacobs dismisses the suggestion that \"the Tannaim were influenced by the Roman legal system...\" and that \"even if the Rabbis were familiar with the Roman law, they might have reacted to it [instead] by preserving the patrilineal principle, holding fast to their own system.\" \n\nThe Jewish Oral Tradition cites the Book of Ezra, Chapters 9, 10, regarding the law of matrilineal descent in Judaism. The medieval French commentator, Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki (1040-1105 CE) in his commentary on Prophets references the law of matrilineal descent regarding Tamar, daughter of King David. Maimonides re-codified the law of matrilineal descent in his compilation of Jewish Law, Mishneh Torah (c. 1170-1180 CE). The law of matrilineal descent was again re-codified in the Code of Jewish Law, Shulchan Aruch (1563 CE) without mention of any dissenting opinion.\n\nThe Hellenized Jewish philosopher, Philo of Alexandria (c. 20 BCE – 50 CE) calls the child of a Jew and a non-Jew a \"nothos\" (bastard), regardless of whether the non-Jewish parent is the father or the mother.\nWhile Flavius Josephus (c. 37-100 CE), the Romanized Jewish historian, writing about events that were alleged to have occurred a century prior, has Antigonus II Mattathias (c. 63-37 BCE), the last Hasmonean king of Judea, denigrating Herod –whose father's family were Idumean Arabs forcibly converted to Judaism by John Hyrcanus (c. 134-104 BCE) and whose mother, according to Josephus, was either an Idumean Arab or Arabian (Nabatean-Arab)– by referring to him as \"an Idumean i.e. a half-Jew\" and as therefore unfit to be given governorship of Judea by the Romans. \n\nIn practice, Jewish denominations define \"Who is a Jew?\" via descent in different ways. All denominations of Judaism have protocols for conversion for those who are not Jewish by descent.\n\nOrthodox Judaism practices matrilineal descent and considers it axiomatic. The Conservative Jewish Movement also practices matrilineal descent as virtually all Jewish communities have for at least two thousand years. In 1986, the Conservative Movement's Rabbinical Assembly reiterated the commitment of the Conservative Movement to the practice of matrilineal descent. In 1983, the Central Conference of American Rabbis of Reform Judaism passed a resolution waiving the need for formal conversion for anyone with at least one Jewish parent, provided that either (a) one is raised as a Jew, by Reform standards, or (b) one engages in an appropriate act of public identification, formalizing a practice that had been common in Reform synagogues for at least a generation. This 1983 resolution departed from the Reform Movement's previous position requiring formal conversion to Judaism for children without a Jewish mother. However, the closely associated Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism has rejected this resolution and requires formal conversion for anyone without a Jewish mother. Karaite Judaism does not accept Jewish Oral Law as definitive, believing that all divine commandments were recorded with their plain meaning in the written Torah. As such, they interpret the Hebrew Bible to indicate that Jewishness can only follow patrilineal descent. In 1968, the Reconstructionist movement became the first American Jewish movement to pass a resolution recognizing Jews of patrilineal descent.\n\nCertain ancient myths have been argued to expose ancient traces of matrilineal customs that existed before historical records.\n\nThe ancient historian Herodotus is cited by Robert Graves in his translations of Greek myths as attesting that the Lycians of their times \"still reckoned\" by matrilineal descent, or were matrilineal, as were the Carians.\n\nIn Greek mythology, while the royal function was a male privilege, power devolution often came through women, and the future king inherited power through marrying the queen heiress. This is illustrated in the Homeric myths where all the noblest men in Greece vie for the hand of Helen (and the throne of Sparta), as well as the Oedipian cycle where Oedipus weds the recently widowed queen at the same time he assumes the Theban kingship.\n\nThis trend also is evident in many Celtic myths, such as the (Welsh) mabinogi stories of Culhwch and Olwen, or the (Irish) Ulster Cycle, most notably the key facts to the Cúchulainn cycle that Cúchulainn gets his final secret training with a warrior woman, Scáthach, and becomes the lover of her daughter; and the root of the Táin Bó Cuailnge, that while Ailill may wear the crown of Connacht, it is his wife Medb who is the real power, and she needs to affirm her equality to her husband by owning chattels as great as he does.\n\nThe Picts are widely cited as being matrilineal.\n\nA number of other Breton stories also illustrate the motif. Even the King Arthur legends have been interpreted in this light by some. For example, the Round Table, both as a piece of furniture and as concerns the majority of knights belonging to it, was a gift to Arthur from Guinevere's father Leodegrance.\n\nArguments also have been made that matrilineality lay behind various fairy tale plots which may contain the vestiges of folk traditions not recorded.\n\nFor instance, the widespread motif of a father who wishes to marry his own daughter—appearing in such tales as \"Allerleirauh\", \"Donkeyskin\", \"The King who Wished to Marry His Daughter\", and \"The She-Bear\"—has been explained as his wish to prolong his reign, which he would lose after his wife's death to his son-in-law. More mildly, the hostility of kings to their daughter's suitors is explained by hostility to their successors. In such tales as \"The Three May Peaches\", \"Jesper Who Herded the Hares\", or \"The Griffin\", kings set dangerous tasks in an attempt to prevent the marriage.\n\nFairy tales with hostility between the mother-in-law and the heroine—such as \"Mary's Child\", \"The Six Swans\", and Perrault's Sleeping Beauty—have been held to reflect a transition between a matrilineal society, where a man's loyalty was to his mother, and a patrilineal one, where his wife could claim it, although this interpretation is predicated on such a transition being a normal development in societies.\n\n\n"}

He later became interested in photography, cinema and theatre and at the beginning of the seventies began to write experimental fiction and produce animation cinema in Super8 and 16mm.\nIn 1981 founded Videcom, a video production house in São Paulo directed for corporate and cultural productions.\n\nIt was not until 1982 that he began to work in holography, using artisanal methods. He completed and perfected his technique in 1983 after a holography workshop with the German artist Dieter Jung (artist). In the same year he had his first holographic exhibition at the Museu da Imagem e do Som in São Paulo. In 1984 he developed a specific holographic technique for chromatic control and began the regular production of technically very elaborate works.\nAt that time in his holographic studio he began the production of commercial holograms as well as artistic works.\n\nIn some of his projects in this field he worked in collaboration with other Brazilian artists and poets interested in holography (Augusto de Campos, Décio Pignatari, Julio Plaza and José Wagner Garcia). The results of such collaboration were shown at the “Triluz” exhibition (1986) in the Museu da Imagem e do Som, and at the “Idehologia” exhibition (1987) in the Museu de Arte Contemporânea, São Paulo, amongst others.\nWith José Wagner Garcia he created the prototype of a holographic cinema projector a \"Holographic Kinetoscope\".\n\nA year after his death a retrospective of his cinema and video works was held at the 9th International “Videobrasil” Festival - 1992 in São Paulo.\n\nHolographic poems by Augusto de Campos and produced by Baumstein were purchased by the \"Centre Régional des Lettres de Basse-Normandie\" in France and in 2007, the holographic poem REVER was exhibited at the exhibition \"Concrete Poetry - O Projeto Verbivocovisual\" in Tomie Ohtake Institute (São Paulo) and at the Palácio das Artes (Belo Horizonte).\n\nVidecom kept the activities of his holographic laboratory until 2007 when all the equipment was donated to the Optical Lab from the University of Campinas Physics Institute under the responsibility of Jose Lunazzi.\n\nBetween September and November 2010 his holograms were presented at the exhibition \"TEKHNE\" (Tekhne page in English/Portuguese and Spanish) at Fundação Armando Alvares Penteado (FAAP) in São Paulo, which introduced the discussion of the importance of the convergence between art and technology.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "155380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=155380", "title": "Nachmanides", "text": "Nachmanides\n\nMoses ben Nahman ( \"Mōšeh ben-Nāḥmān\", \"Moses son of Nahman\"; 1194–1270), commonly known as Nachmanides (; \"Nakhmanídēs\"), and also referred to by the acronym Ramban () and by the contemporary nickname Bonastruc ça Porta (literally \"Mazel Tov near the Gate\", see wikt:ca:astruc), was a leading medieval Jewish scholar, Sephardic rabbi, philosopher, physician, kabbalist, and biblical commentator. He was raised, studied, and lived for most of his life in Girona, Catalonia. He is also considered to be an important figure in the re-establishment of the Jewish community in Jerusalem following its destruction by the Crusaders in 1099.\n\n\"Nachmanides\" (Ναχμανίδης) is a Greek-influenced formation meaning \"son of Nahman\". He is also commonly known by the Hebrew acronym (Ra-M-Ba-N, for \"Rabbeinu Mōšeh bēn-Nāḥmān\", \"Our Rabbi Moses son of Nahman\"). His Catalan name was Bonastruc ça Porta (also written \"Saporta\" or \"de Porta\"), literally \"Mazel Tov near the Gate\".\n\nRamban was born in Girona in 1194, where he grew up and studied (hence he is also called \"Mosheh ben Nahman Gerondi\", or \"Moses son of Nahman the Gironan\"), and died in the Land of Israel about 1270. He was a descendant of Isaac ben Reuben of Barcelona and cousin of Jonah Gerondi (Rabbeinu Yonah). Among his teachers in Talmud were Judah ben Yakar and Nathan ben Meïr of Trinquetaille, and he is said to have been instructed in Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism) by his countryman Azriel of Gerona, who was in turn a disciple of Isaac the Blind.\n\nAccording to the responsa of Shlomo ibn Aderet Nachmanides studied medicine. During his teens he began to get a reputation as a learned Jewish scholar. At age 16 he began his writings on Jewish law. In his \"Milhamot Hashem\" (Wars of the Lord) he defended Alfasi's decisions against the criticisms of Zerachiah ha-Levi of Girona. These writings reveal a conservative tendency that distinguished his later works — an unbounded respect for the earlier authorities.\n\nIn the view of Nachmanides, the wisdom of the rabbis of the Mishnah and Talmud, as well as the Geonim (rabbis of the early medieval era) was unquestionable. Their words were to be neither doubted nor criticized. \"We bow,\" he says, \"before them, and even when the reason for their words is not quite evident to us, we submit to them\" (\"Aseifat Zekkenim\", commentary on \"Ketubot\"). Nachmanides' adherence to the words of the earlier authorities may be due to piety, or the influence of the northern French Jewish school of thought. However, it is thought that it also may be a reaction to the rapid acceptance of Greco-Arabic philosophy among the Jews of Spain and Provence; this occurred soon after the appearance of Maimonides' \"Guide for the Perplexed\". This work gave rise to a tendency to allegorize Biblical narratives, and to downplay the role of miracles. Against this tendency Nachmanides strove, and went to the other extreme, not even allowing the utterances of the immediate disciples of the Geonim to be questioned.\n\nCalled upon, about 1238, for support by Solomon ben Abraham of Montpellier, who had been excommunicated by supporters of Maimonides, Nachmanides addressed a letter to the communities of Aragon, Navarre, and Castile, in which Solomon's adversaries were severely rebuked. However, the great respect he professed for Maimonides (though he did not share the latter's views), reinforced by innate gentleness of character, kept him from allying himself with the anti-Maimonist party and led him to assume the role of a conciliator.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the French rabbis, he draws attention to the virtues of Maimonides and holds that Maimonides' Mishneh Torah – his Code of Jewish Law – not only shows no leniency in interpreting prohibitions within Jewish law, but may even be seen as more stringent, which in Nachmanides' eyes was a positive factor. As to Maimonides' \"Guide for the Perplexed\", Nachmanides stated that it was intended not for those of unshaken belief, but for those who had been led astray by the non-Jewish philosophical works of Aristotle and Galen. (Note that Nachmanides's analysis of the \"Guide\" is not the consensus view of modern scholars.) \"If,\" he says, \"you were of the opinion that it was your duty to denounce the Guide as heretical, why does a portion of your flock recede from the decision as if it regretted the step? Is it right in such important matters to act capriciously, to applaud the one to-day and the other tomorrow?\"\n\nTo reconcile the two parties Nachmanides proposed that the ban against the philosophical portion of Maimonides's Code of Jewish law should be revoked, but that the ban against the study of the \"Guide for the Perplexed\", and against those who rejected allegorical interpretation of the Bible, should be maintained and even strengthened. This compromise, which might have ended the struggle, was rejected by both parties in spite of Nachmanides' authority.\n\nThe book \"Iggeret ha-Kodesh\" (אגרת הקודש - The Holy Epistle) on the topics of marriage, holiness, and sexual relations was commonly attributed to Nachmanides, who supposedly wrote it for his son as a wedding gift. However, modern scholarship attributes it to a different author, perhaps Rabbi Joseph ben Abraham Gikatilla.\n\nIn this book, the author criticizes Maimonides for stigmatizing man's sexual nature as a disgrace to man. In the view of the author, the body with all its functions being the work of God, is holy, and so none of its normal sexual impulses and actions can be regarded as objectionable.\n\nIn Nachmanides's \"Torat ha-Adam,\" which deals with mourning rites, burial customs, etc., Nachmanides sharply criticizes writers who strove to render man indifferent to both pleasure and pain. This, he declares, is against the Law, which commands man to rejoice on the day of joy and weep on the day of mourning. The last chapter, entitled \"Shaar ha-Gemul,\" discusses reward and punishment, resurrection, and kindred subjects. It derides the presumption of the philosophers who pretend to a knowledge of the essence of God and the angels, while even the composition of their own bodies is a mystery to them.\n\nFor Nachmanides, divine revelation is the best guide in all these questions, and proceeds to give his views on Jewish views of the afterlife. He holds that as God is eminently just, there must be reward and punishment. This reward and punishment must take place in another world, for the good and evil of this world are relative and transitory.\n\nBesides the animal soul, which is derived from the \"Supreme powers\" and is common to all creatures, man possesses a special soul. This special soul, which is a direct emanation from God, existed before the creation of the world. Through the medium of man it enters the material life; and at the dissolution of its medium it either returns to its original source or enters the body of another man. This belief is, according to Nachmanides, the basis of the levirate marriage, the child of which inherits not only the name of the brother of his fleshly father, but also his soul, and thus continues its existence on the earth. The resurrection spoken of by the prophets, which will take place after the coming of the Messiah, is referred by Nachmanides to the body. The physical body may, through the influence of the soul, transform itself into so pure an essence that it will become eternal.\n\nRamban's commentary on the Torah (five books of Moses) was his last work, and his most well known. He frequently cites and critiques Rashi's commentary, and provides alternative interpretations where he disagrees with Rashi's interpretation. He was prompted to record his commentary by three motives: (1) to satisfy the minds of students of the Law and stimulate their interest by a critical examination of the text; (2) to justify the ways of God and discover the hidden meanings of the words of Scripture, \"for in the Torah are hidden every wonder and every mystery, and in her treasures is sealed every beauty of wisdom\"; (3) to soothe the minds of the students by simple explanations and pleasant words when they read the appointed sections of the Pentateuch on Sabbaths and festivals. His exposition, intermingled with aggadic and mystical interpretations, is based upon careful philology and original study of the Bible.\n\nHis commentary on the creation of the world describes the heavens and the earth being created out of a noncorporeal substance:\n\nAs in his preceding works, he vehemently attacks the Greek philosophers, especially Aristotle, and frequently criticizes Maimonides' Biblical interpretations. Thus he assails Maimonides' interpretation of Gen. 18:8, asserting that Maimonides' preferred understanding is contrary to the evident meaning of the Biblical words and that it is sinful even to hear it. While Maimonides endeavored to reduce the miracles of the Bible to the level of natural phenomena, Nachmanides emphasizes them, declaring that \"no man can share in the Torah of our teacher Moses unless he believes that all our affairs, whether they concern masses or individuals, are miraculously controlled, and that nothing can be attributed to nature or the order of the world.\" See further on this debate under Divine Providence.\n\nNext to belief in miracles Nachmanides places three other beliefs, which are, according to him, the Jewish principles of faith, namely, the belief in creation out of nothing, in the omniscience of God, and in divine providence.\n\nNachmanides, in this commentary, often fiercely criticized Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, particularly regarding ibn Ezra's negative attitude towards Kabbalah. Nevertheless, he had tremendous respect for ibn Ezra, as is evidenced in his introduction to the commentary.\n\nOver time, Nachmanides updated his commentary in at least 250 places, particularly after moving from Spain to the land of Israel. These updates are attested to in different versions of his commentary which survived in manuscript.\n\nNachmanides, first as rabbi of Girona and later as chief rabbi of Catalonia, seems to have led a largely untroubled life. When well advanced in years, however, his life was interrupted by an event which made him leave his family and his country and wander in foreign lands. This was the religious disputation in which he was called upon to defend his faith in 1263. The debate was initiated by a Pablo Christiani, a Jewish convert to Christianity, who had been sent by the Dominican Master General, Raymond de Penyafort, to King James I of Aragon, with the request that the king order Ramban to respond to charges against Judaism.\n\nPablo Christiani had been trying to make the Jews convert to Christianity. Relying upon the reserve his adversary would be forced to exercise due to fear of offending the feelings of the Christians, Pablo assured the King that he would prove the truth of Christianity from the Talmud and other rabbinical writings. Ramban answered the order of the King, but asked that complete freedom of speech should be granted. For four days (July 20–24) he debated with Pablo Christiani in the presence of the King, the court, and many churchmen.\n\nThe subjects discussed were:\n\nChristiani argued, based upon several aggadic passages, that the Pharisee sages believed that the Messiah had lived during the Talmudic period, and that they ostensibly believed that the Messiah was therefore Jesus. Nachmanides countered that Christiani's interpretations were distortions; the rabbis would not hint that Jesus was Messiah while, at the same time, explicitly opposing him as such. He further said that if the sages of the Talmud believed that Jesus was the messiah then most certainly they would have been Christians and not Jews, and the fact that the sages of the Talmud were Jews is beyond dispute. Nachmanides proceeded to provide context for the proof-texts cited by Christiani, showing that they were most clearly understood differently than as proposed by Christiani. Furthermore, Nachmanides demonstrated from numerous biblical and talmudic sources that traditional Jewish belief ran contrary to Christiani's postulates.\n\nNachmanides argued that the Biblical prophets regarded the future messiah as a human, a person of flesh and blood, and not as divine, in the way that Christians view Jesus. He stated that their promises of a reign of universal peace and justice had not yet been fulfilled, that since the appearance of Jesus, the world had been filled with violence and injustice, and that among all denominations the Christians were the most warlike.\n\n[... it seems most strange that... ] the Creator of Heaven and Earth resorted to the womb of a certain Jewish lady, grew there for nine months and was born as an infant, and afterwards grew up and was betrayed into the hands of his enemies who sentenced him to death and executed him, and that afterwards... he came to life and returned to his original place. The mind of a Jew, or any other person, simply cannot tolerate these assertions. You have listened all your life to the priests who have filled your brain and the marrow of your bones with this doctrine, and it has settled into you because of that accustomed habit. [I would argue that if you were hearing these ideas for the first time, now, as a grown adult], you would never accept them.\n\nHe noted that questions of the Messiah were of less dogmatic importance to Jews than most Christians imagine. The reason given by him for this bold statement was that it was more meritorious for the Jews to observe the precepts under a Christian ruler, while in exile and suffering humiliation and abuse, than under the rule of the Messiah, when every one would perforce act in accordance with the Law.\n\nAs the disputation seemed to turn in favor of Nachmanides, the Jews of Barcelona, fearing the resentment of the Dominicans, entreated him to discontinue; but the King, whom Nachmanides had acquainted with the apprehensions of the Jews, desired him to proceed. The controversy was therefore resumed, and concluded in what was considered a complete victory for Nachmanides, who was dismissed by the King with a gift of three hundred gold pieces as a mark of his respect. The King remarked that he had never encountered a man who, while yet being wrong, argued so well for his position.\n\nThe Dominicans, nevertheless, claimed the victory, and Nachmanides felt obligated to publish the text of the debates. From this publication Pablo selected certain passages which he construed as blasphemies against Christianity and denounced to the head of his order, Raymond de Penyafort. A capital charge was then instituted, and a formal complaint against the work and its author was lodged with the King. James was obliged to entertain the charge, but, mistrusting the Dominican court, called an extraordinary commission, and ordered that the proceedings be conducted in his presence. Nachmanides admitted that he had stated many things against Christianity, but he had written nothing which he had not used in his disputation in the presence of the King, who had granted him freedom of speech.\n\nThe justness of his defense was recognized by the King and the commission, but to satisfy the Dominicans, Nachmanides was sentenced to exile for two years and his pamphlet was condemned to be burned. He may also have been fined, but this was lifted as a favor to Benveniste ça Porta, who according to some authorities was Nachmanides' brother. The Dominicans, however, found this punishment too mild and, through Pope Clement IV, they seem to have succeeded in turning the two years' exile into perpetual banishment.\n\nOther scholars believe that the identification of Bonastruc ça Porta with Nachmanides is incorrect. If so, then there were actually two people who were found to be blasphemous in the same time period and location.\n\nNachmanides left Aragon and sojourned for three years somewhere in Castille or in the southern part of the Kingdom of France. In 1267, seeking refuge from Christian persecution in Muslim lands, he made aliyah to Jerusalem. There he established a synagogue in the Old City that exists until the present day, known as the Ramban Synagogue. His re-establishment of Jewish communal life in Jerusalem (which had been interrupted by Crusader repression) is notable in that it marked the beginning of almost 700 consecutive Jewish years in Jerusalem until the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Nachmanides then settled at Acre, where he was very active in spreading Jewish learning, which was at that time very much neglected in the Holy Land. He gathered a circle of pupils around him, and people came in crowds, even from the district of the Euphrates, to hear him. Karaites were said to have attended his lectures, among them Aaron ben Joseph the Elder, who later became one of the greatest Karaite authorities (although Graetz writes that there is no veracity to that). It was to arouse the interest of the Israeli Jews in the exposition of the Bible that Nachmanides wrote the greatest of his works, the above-mentioned commentary on the Torah.\nAlthough surrounded by friends and pupils, Nachmanides keenly felt the pangs of exile. \"I left my family, I forsook my house. There, with my sons and daughters, the sweet, dear children I brought up at my knees, I left also my soul. My heart and my eyes will dwell with them forever.\" During his three-year stay in the Holy Land, Nachmanides maintained a correspondence with his native land, by means of which he endeavored to bring about a closer connection between Judea and Spain. Shortly after his arrival in Jerusalem, he addressed a letter to his son Nahman, in which he described the desolation of the Holy City, where there were at that time only two Jewish inhabitants—brothers, dyers by trade. In a later letter from Acre he counsels his son to cultivate humility, which he considers to be the first of virtues. In another, addressed to his second son, who occupied an official position at the Castilian court, Nachmanides recommends the recitation of the daily prayers and warns above all against immorality.\n\nNachmanides died in the Holy Land after having passed the age of seventy or seventy-six. Different traditions suggest that he was buried in Haifa, Acre, Hebron, or in the Cave of the Ramban in Jerusalem.\n\nNachmanides' wrote glosses on the whole Talmud, made compendiums of parts of Jewish law, after the model of Isaac Alfasi. His major work on the Talmud is referred to as \"Chiddushei haRamban\". He often provides a different perspective on a variety of issues that are addressed by the Tosefot.\n\nNachmanides' known halakhic works are:\n\nNachmanides' writings in the defense of Simeon Kayyara and Alfasi also belong in the category of his Talmudic and halachic works.

He appears to have been attached to the chapel of the Sardinian Embassy on Lincoln's Inn Fields in London. He certainly attended at the execution of the Scottish Catholic nobleman, Lord Lovat, on Tower Hill on 9 April 1747.\n\nBaker's works were mostly guides for meditation for the proper reception of the Blessed Sacrament and on the liturgical seasons of the Church year. His reputation as a writer suffered in latter years. He was one of several religious authors who developed a series of books to allow Catholics who were isolated from the celebration of the Eucharist to meditate on its focus in keeping with the liturgical year of the Catholic Church.\n\nBaker encouraged the reception of the Blessed Sacrament by the laity as often as possible but recognized that, due to the lack of Catholic clergy in Britain in that era, this could be sporadic at best. His works provided the faithful with models for worship on the various Sundays through which they could participate in the liturgical life of the universal Church. His writings also proved popular for isolated Catholics on the American frontier.\n\nAn evaluation of Baker's work in the 19th century described it as \"remarkable for unction, solidity, and moderation\".\n\nBaker died in London on 16 March 1774.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1347413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1347413", "title": "Rimé movement", "text": "Rimé movement\n\nThe Rimé movement is a movement involving the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma schools of Tibetan Buddhism, along with some Bon scholars.\n\nHaving seen how the Gelug institutions pushed the other traditions into the corners of Tibet's cultural life, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820-1892) and Jamgön Kongtrül (1813-1899) compiled together the teachings of the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma, including many near-extinct teachings. Without Khyentse and Kongtrul's collecting and printing of rare works, the suppression of Buddhism by the Communists would have been much more final. The Rimé movement is responsible for a number of scriptural compilations, such as the \"Rinchen Terdzod\" and the \"Sheja Dzö\".\n\nMost scholars of Buddhism explain Rimé as an \"eclectic movement\", however one scholar has suggested that this is an inadequate rendering, saying \"In fact this Rimé movement was not exactly eclectic but universalistic (and encyclopaedic), \"rimed (pa)\" (the antonym of \"risu ch'edpa\") meaning unbounded, all-embracing, unlimited, and also impartial.\" One of the most prominent contemporary Rimé masters, Ringu Tulku, emphasizes the message of the original Rimé founders, that it is not a new school. It is simply an approach allowing freedom of choice which was always the majority practice within the history of Tibetan Buddhism. The Karmapas, Je Tsongkhapa, the Dalai Lamas, Sakya lineage heads and major Nyingma and Kagyu figures took teachings and empowerments from various schools and lineages.\n\nThe movement's name is derived from two Tibetan words: \"Ris\" (bias, side) and \"Med\" (lack), which combined expresses the idea of openness to other Tibetan Buddhist traditions, as opposed to sectarianism. The Rimé movement therefore is often misunderstood as trying to unite the various sects through their similarities. Rather Rimé was intended to recognize the differences between traditions and appreciate them, while also establishing a dialogue which would create common ground. It is considered important that variety be preserved, and therefore Rimé teachers are generally careful to emphasize differences in thought, giving students many options as to how to proceed in their spiritual training.\n\nRingu Tulku describes these points which are often misrepresented:\n\"Ris\" or \"Phyog-ris\" in Tibetan means \"one-sided\", \"partisan\" or \"sectarian\". \"Med\" means \"No\". \"Ris-med\" (Wylie), or \"Rimé\", therefore means \"no sides\", \"non-partisan\" or \"non-sectarian\". It does not mean \"non-conformist\" or \"non-committal\"; nor does it mean forming a new School or system that is different from the existing ones. A person who believes the Rimé way almost certainly follows one lineage as his or her main practice. He or she would not dissociate from the School in which he or she was raised. Kongtrul was raised in the Nyingma and Kagyu traditions; Khyentse was reared in a strong Sakyapa tradition. They never failed to acknowledge their affiliation to their own Schools.\n\nRimé is not a way of uniting different Schools and lineages by emphasizing their similarities. It is basically an appreciation of their differences and an acknowledgement of the importance of having this variety for the benefit of practitioners with different needs. Therefore the Rimé teachers always take great care that the teachings and practices of the different Schools and lineages and their unique styles do not become confused with one another. To retain the original style and methods of each teaching lineage preserves the power of that lineage experience. Kongtrul and Khyentse made great efforts to retain the original flavor of each teaching, while making them available to many. Kongtrul writes about Khyentse in his biography of the latter... When he (Khyentse Rinpoche) taught, he would give the teachings of each lineage clearly and intelligibly without confusing the terms and concepts of other teachings.\nRimé was initially intended to counteract the novel growing suspicion and tension building between the different traditions, which at the time had, in many places, gone so far as to forbid studying one another's scriptures. Tibetan Buddhism has a long history of vigorous debate and argumentation between schools and within one's training. This can lead a practitioner to believe that one's school has the best approach or highest philosophic view and that other lineages have a lower or flawed understanding. The Rimé approach cautions against developing that viewpoint, while at the same time appreciating that the debate and discussion is important and that arguing which views are higher and lower is still valid discourse.\n\nJamgon Kongtrul pointed out the necessity of each practitioner to have a strong foundation in one school:\nThe scholars and siddhas of the various schools make their own individual presentations of the dharma. Each one is full of strong points and supported by valid reasoning. If you are well grounded in the presentations of your own tradition, then it is unnecessary to be sectarian. But if you get mixed up about the various tenets and the terminology, then you lack even a foothold in your own tradition. You try to use someone else's system to support your understanding, and then get all tangled up, like a bad weaver, concerning the view, meditation, conduct, and result. Unless you have certainty in your own system, you cannot use reasoning to support your scriptures, and you cannot challenge the assertions of others. You become a laughing stock in the eyes of the learned ones. It would be much better to possess a clear understanding of your own tradition.\n\nIn summary, one must see all the teachings as without contradiction, and consider all the scriptures as instructions. This will cause the root of sectarianism and prejudice to dry up, and give you a firm foundation in the Buddhas teachings. At that point, hundreds of doors to the eighty-four thousand teachings of the dharma will simultaneously be open to you.\nA rimé practitioner may take empowerments from numerous lineages and living masters, though it is not a requirement to do so.\n\nTwo of the founding voices of Rimé were Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and Jamgon Kongtrul, both from different schools; the epithets \"Jamyang\" (, ) and \"Jamgön\" (, ) in their name indicating that they are considered to be emanations of Manjushri. Jamgön Kongtrul was from the Nyingma and Kagyu traditions, while Wangpo had been raised within the Sakya order. At the time, Tibetan schools of thought had become very isolated, and both Wangpo and Jamgon Kongtrul were instrumental in re-initiating dialogue between the sects.\n\nRachel H. Pang has noted that non-sectarian ideals are also strongly present in the works of Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol even though he predates the movement by about three decades and never met with any of the Rimé masters from Kham.\n\nThe Rimé movement came to prominence at a point in Tibetan history when the religious climate had become partisan. The aim of the movement was \"a push towards a middle ground where the various views and styles of the different traditions were appreciated for their individual contributions rather than being refuted, marginalized, or banned.\" Many of the teachings of various schools were close to being lost and the movement set out to preserve them. However, though the Rimé movement gathered together teachings from each of the various traditions, it did not mix these, but recognised the individual integrity of each.\n\nThe movement began within a large context of increasing domination by the Gelug school. Beginning in the 17th century, the Gelug view and politics increasingly dominated in Tibet and the minority lineages were at risk for losing their traditions. At its founding, the Rimé movement was primarily non-Gelugpa teachers and at times the movement has appeared critical of Gelug views. Georges Dreyfus suggests this argumentation was less to create further division but was to bolster minority views that had been marginalized by Gelug supremacy. Nonetheless, philosophic commentaries by early Rimé writers tend to criticize Gelugpa tenets.\n\nHowever, Rimé was in its idealized presentation the reestablishment of a rule or principle that had always been present in Tibetan Buddhism, but that had been de-emphasized or forgotten: To ignorantly criticize other traditions was wrong, and that misunderstandings due to ignorance should be immediately alleviated. Ringu Tulku says:\nThe movement became particularly well-established in the Kingdom of Derge. Rimé has become an integral part of the Tibetan tradition, and continues to be an important philosophy in Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nOther notable Tibetan Lamas noted for their non-sectarian approach were Patrul Rinpoche and Orgyen Chokgyur Lingpa. Shabkar Tsodruk Rangdrol, Dudjom Lingpa and the Khakyab Dorje, 15th Karmapa Lama, who was a student of Jamgön Kongtrul. Other lineage leaders gave their blessing to the movement and its founders who were considered extremely realized.\n\nDavid Kay notes that Dorje Shugden was a key element in Pabongkhapa Déchen Nyingpo's persecution of the Rimé movement:\n\nThe Rimé movement, primarily composed of the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma schools, arose in the first place as a result of Gelug persecution.\n\nThe movement's achievements have been successful in the 20th century where taking teachings and transmissions from different schools and lineages has become the norm amongst many monastic students, lamas, yogis as well as lay practitioners. This has mainly been due to the proactive support of many lineage holders and various leaders such as the 13th and 14th Dalai Lamas, the 15th and 16th Karmapas, Sakya Trizin and Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje, following the \"eclectic\" approach of the 5th Dalai Lama \"who blurred the lines between traditions\":\n\nThe 14th Dalai Lama composed a prayer for the movement praising various historic figures and lineages of Vajrayana Buddhism from India and Tibet, part of which says:\n\nDzongsar Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö, Khunu Lama Tenzin Gyaltsen and Dilgo Khyentse are recent Rimé masters, known for their public influence and as being advisers and teachers to the 14th Dalai Lama. Other modern adherents include the late 16th Karmapa and 2nd Dudjom Rinpoche, both of whom gave extensive teachings from the works of Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro, as well as Akong Rinpoche who, with the late Chögyam Trungpa, helped establish Tibetan Buddhism in the United Kingdom. The lineage of the late Nyoshul Khenpo Rinpoche is represented today in the teachings of Surya Das.\n\nThe 14th Dalai Lama supports and encourages a non-sectarian spirit. Major Gelug figures like Shabkar in the 19th century, and the Panchen Lamas and Reting Rinpoche in the 20th century studied Nyingma teachings along with their Gelug training. The personal and hidden lake temple of the lineage of Dalai Lamas behind the Potala called Lukhang is dedicated to Dzogchen teachings. 8th Arjia Rinpoche continues the Rimé tradition in the United States.\n\nBön teacher Tenzin Wangyal cautions, however, that even this so-called non-sectarian attitude may be taken to an extreme:\n"}

In 2007, he had his first major film role in \"St Trinian's\", and the following year he landed a major role in the romantic comedy-drama \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\"; the film led to him starring in a spin off, the rock comedy \"Get Him to the Greek\", alongside Jonah Hill in 2010. He also worked as a voice actor in the animated films \"Despicable Me\" in 2010, \"Hop\" in 2011, and \"Despicable Me 2\" in 2013, and played the title character of the 2011 remake of the romantic comedy \"Arthur\". In 2013, he released the successful stand-up special \"Messiah Complex\".\n\nSince guest editing an edition of British political weekly \"New Statesman\" in 2013, Brand has become known as a public activist and campaigner, and has spoken on a wide range of political and cultural issues, including wealth inequality, addiction, corporate capitalism, climate change, and media bias. In 2014, Brand launched his political-comedy web series \"The Trews\", released a book entitled \"Revolution\", and began work on a documentary about financial inequality with Michael Winterbottom.\n\nOver the course of his career, Brand has been the subject of frequent media coverage and controversy for issues such as his promiscuity and drug use, his outrageous behaviour at various award ceremonies, his dismissal from MTV and resignation from the BBC, and his two-year marriage with singer Katy Perry. He has incorporated many of his controversial public antics into his comedic material. In 2015 a biographical documentary called \"Brand: A Second Coming\" was released.\n\nRussell Edward Brand was born in Orsett Hospital in Grays, Essex, England. He is the only child of Barbara Elizabeth (\"née\" Nichols) and photographer Ronald Henry Brand. Brand's parents separated when he was six months old, and he was raised by his mother.\n\nWhen Brand was 8, his mother contracted uterine cancer and then breast cancer one year later. While she underwent treatment, Brand lived with relatives. When he was 14, he suffered from bulimia nervosa. When he was 16, he left home because of disagreements with his mother's partner. Brand then started to use illegal drugs such as cannabis, amphetamines, LSD, and ecstasy.\n\nBrand says he had a \"strange relationship\" with his father, whom he saw sporadically and who took him to visit prostitutes during a trip to Thailand when Brand was a teenager. He made his theatrical debut at the age of 15 in a school production of \"Bugsy Malone\", and then began work as a film extra. Brand attended Grays School Media Arts College and in 1991, he was accepted to the Italia Conti Academy and had his first year of tuition funded by Essex County Council. After his first year at Italia Conti Academy, Brand was expelled for illegal drug use and poor attendance.\n\nBrand performed stand-up at the Hackney Empire New Act of the Year final in 2000. Although he finished fourth, his performance attracted the attention of \"Bound and Gagged Comedy Ltd\" agent Nigel Klarfeld. That year, he also made his Edinburgh debut as one-third of the stand-up show \"Pablo Diablo's Cryptic Triptych\", alongside ventriloquist Mark Felgate and Anglo-Iranian comic Shappi Khorsandi. In 2004, he took his first one-man show, the confessional \"Better Now\", to the Edinburgh Festival, giving what he claimed was an honest account of his heroin addiction. He returned the following year with \"Eroticised Humour\". He launched his first nationwide tour, \"Shame\", in 2006. Brand drew on embarrassing incidents in his own life and the coverage about him in the tabloid press. The show was released on DVD as \"Russell Brand: Live\". Brand appeared in a sketch and performed stand-up at Amnesty International's \"Secret Policeman's Ball\" in 2006 and again at the 2012 edition at Radio City Music Hall.\n\nIn March 2007, he co-hosted an evening of the Teenage Cancer Trust gigs with Noel Fielding. In December 2007, Brand performed for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip as an act in the 2007 Royal Variety Performance. His second nationwide tour, in 2007, was called \"Russell Brand: Only Joking\" and released on DVD as \"Russell Brand: Doin' Life\". Brand began performing in the US, and recorded a special for Comedy Central titled \"Russell Brand in New York\", which aired in March 2009. Brand began touring the UK, America and Australia from January to on a tour called \"Russell Brand: Scandalous\". In October, a further four dates that were performed in November were added to raise money for Focus 12, the drug charity for which Brand is a patron.\n\nIn 2013, Brand presented and toured his comedy show \"Messiah Complex\", in which he tackled advertising, the laws on drug addiction and the portrayal of his heroes, such as Gandhi, Guevara, Malcolm X and Jesus, and how he is, in comically contrived ways, similar to them.\n\nIn January 2017 Brand announced his new show \"Re:Birth\" which will debut in April 2017 and will run until November 2018.\n\nOver the years, Brand has named Richard Pryor, Bill Hicks, Peter Cook, Lenny Bruce, Tony Hancock, Jack Kerouac, Stewart Lee, Tenacious D, Eddie Murphy, Monty Python as his comedic influences.\n\nBrand's first presenting role came in 2000 as a video journalist on MTV. He presented \"Dancefloor Chart\", touring nightclubs in Britain and Ibiza, and hosted the tea-time request show \"Select\". Brand was fired several days after coming to work dressed as Osama bin Laden the day after the 11 September 2001 attacks and bringing his drug dealer to the MTV studios.\nAfter leaving MTV, Brand starred in \"\", a documentary and comedy television program that aimed to take a challenging look at cultural taboos. It was conceived, written, and hosted by Brand, with the help of his comic partner on many projects, Matt Morgan. The series was shown on the now-defunct digital satellite channel UK Play in 2002.\n\nIn 2004, he hosted \"Big Brother's Eforum\" on E4, a sister show to \"Big Brother 5\". The show gave celebrity guests and the public the chance to have their say on the goings-on inside the \"Big Brother\" house. For \"Big Brother 6\", the show's name changed to \"Big Brother's Big Mouth\". Following \"Celebrity Big Brother 5\", Brand said he would not return to host the \"Big Brother 8\" series of \"Big Brother's Big Mouth\". In a statement, Brand thanked all the producers for \"taking the risk of employing an ex-junkie twerp\" to front the show. Of his time presenting the show, he said, \"The three years I've spent on \"Big Brother's Big Mouth\" have been an unprecedented joy\". Brand hosted a one-off special called \"Big Brother According to Russell Brand\", in which Brand took a surreal, sideways look at \"Big Brother\" through the ages. On 8 January 2008, Brand was the fifth celebrity to \"hijack\" the Big Brother house, in the E4 show \"\".\n\nBrand next returned to MTV in the spring of 2006 as presenter of the chat show, \"1 Leicester Square\", which had its broadcast time revised to allow for a more adult-oriented theme. Guests included Tom Cruise, Uma Thurman, The Mighty Boosh, and Boy George, and a second series began in September 2006 on MTV. After \"Big Brother 7\" finished, Brand presented a debate show called \"Russell Brand's Got Issues\", on E4. The viewing figures for the first episode were seen as disappointing, being beaten by nearly all of E4's main multi-channel rivals, despite a big publicity and promotional campaign for the show. The poor ratings prompted the network to repackage the show as \"The Russell Brand Show\" and move it to Channel 4. The first episode was broadcast on on Channel 4, and it ran for five weeks.\n\nBrand presented the 2006 NME Awards. At the ceremony Bob Geldof, who was accepting an award from Brand, said at the podium, \"Russell Brand – what a cunt\", to which Brand replied, \"Really, it's no surprise [Geldof]'s such an expert on famine. He has, after all, been dining out on 'I Don't Like Mondays' for 30 years.\" Brand hosted the 2007 BRIT Awards and presented Oasis with an \"Outstanding Contribution to Music\" award at the event. He also hosted one hour of Comic Relief. On 7 July 2007, he presented at the UK leg of Live Earth at Wembley Stadium, London.\nOn 12 December 2007, BBC Four aired \"Russell Brand On the Road\", a documentary presented by Brand and Matt Morgan about the writer Jack Kerouac and his novel \"On the Road\". Brand returned to Channel 4 to host \"Russell Brand's Ponderland\", in which he discussed topics like childhood and science through stand-up comedy. The show first aired on 22 October 2007 and continued for the next five nights. A second series began on 30 October 2008. The show ran for 12 episodes over the two series. Brand was later announced as the host of the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs), which drew skepticism from the American media, as he was relatively unknown to the American public. Brand's appearance led to controversy for numerous reasons. He said the night \"marked the launch of a very new Britney Spears era\", referring to it as \"the resurrection of [Spears]\". He also said, \"If there was a female Christ, it's Britney\". Brand implored the audience to elect Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and later called then–U.S. President George W. Bush \"a retarded cowboy fella\", who, in England, \"wouldn't be trusted with scissors\". He also made several references to the purity rings worn by the Jonas Brothers, but apologized for the comments later in the show.\n\nHis comments at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards led to Brand receiving death threats from some offended viewers. Brand claimed that MTV asked him to host the 2009 awards after the ratings for the 2008 show were 20 percent higher than the previous year. Also in 2008, Brand hosted a one-off stand up comedy show called \"Comedy Live Presents: Russell Brand and Friends\", which was shown on Channel 4 on 25 January 2008. Brand returned to host the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, on 13 September 2009, at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. The ratings for the 2009 show were the best since the 2004 VMAs. On 12 February 2011, Brand guest hosted an episode of the hit American sketch comedy \"Saturday Night Live\". Brand also hosted the 2012 MTV Movie Awards.\n\nWhile still a teenager, Brand appeared in 1994 episodes of \"The Bill\" and the children's adventure series \"Mud\". In 2002, Brand appeared on the TV shows \"Cruise of the Gods\" and \"White Teeth\". In 2005, he played Tommy in the BBC sitcom \"Blessed\", which was written and directed by \"Young Ones\" co-writer Ben Elton. Brand auditioned for the part of Super Hans in the Channel 4 sitcom \"Peep Show\"; the role eventually went to Matt King. In 2007, Brand appeared in \"Cold Blood\" for ITV, playing an ex-con called Ally. Brand played a recovering crack addict named Terry in the pilot for the ITV comedy \"The Abbey\", written by Morwenna Banks. He voiced an Earth Guardian in \"Robbie the Reindeer in Close Encounters of the Herd Kind\". Brand appeared in a small role in the 2006 movie \"Penelope\"; although his first major film role was as Flash Harry in the 2007 film \"St Trinian's\".\n\nBrand achieved American fame when he starred in the 2008 film \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\", in which he played rock star Aldous Snow, the boyfriend of the title character (played by Kristen Bell). Brand received rave reviews for his performance as Snow, and he revealed the character was changed from an author to a rock star because of his audition. Brand starred alongside Adam Sandler in the Disney film \"Bedtime Stories\", which was released on 25 December 2008. He reprised the role of Aldous Snow for a buddy comedy titled \"Get Him to the Greek\", co-starring Jonah Hill. He reunited with \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\" director Nicholas Stoller and producer Judd Apatow for the film.\n\nBrand starred in Julie Taymor's 2010 version of William Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\", as Trinculo. In 2010, Brand voiced Dr. Nefario in the Universal movie \"Despicable Me\", and reprised the role in the 2013 sequel. Brand also guest starred in \"The Simpsons\" episode \"\" as himself. Brand also starred in the April 2011 live action/CGI animated film \"Hop\" with James Marsden, voicing the film's protagonist E.B. \"Hop\" opened at number one at the Friday box office in the US, earning $11.4 million. The same month, he played the title character in a remake of \"Arthur\", written by Peter Baynham, which was a box office disappointment. Brand starred as Lonny in a film adaptation of the 1980s-set musical \"Rock Of Ages\", released in cinemas in June 2012.\n\nAfter appearing as William Carr in the Diablo Cody film \"Paradise\" (2013), Brand went on hiatus from acting. His return role was as Creek in the DreamWorks animated film \"Trolls\" (2016), followed by his portrayal of God in the comedy \"Army of One\" (2016) with Nicolas Cage. He portrayed Sports X Network founder Lance Klians in a 2018 five-episode arc on the HBO series \"Ballers\". \n\nOther projects Brand has been tied to include a remake of \"Drop Dead Fred\", an Adam Sandler-produced film about a con-man posing as a priest tentatively entitled \"Bad Father\", co-written by Brand and Matt Morgan; and a film adaptation of the children's television programme \"Rentaghost\" a project that was picked up by Fox Studios in 2011 with Ben Stiller attached.\n\nAs of October 2008, Brand's own production company is called Vanity Projects. The company's most recent production, \"Russell Brand Doing Life\", was released in 2009.\nBrand also established his own production company in 2011 with friend Nik Linnen. Called 'Branded Films', the company operates from the Warner Bros. studios in Burbank, California, United States. The company's primary focus is to develop films that Brand stars in.\n\nBrand's radio career began in early 2002, when he hosted a Sunday afternoon show with Matt Morgan on London's Indie Rock station Xfm. Brand was fired from the job after reading pornographic material live on-air. Brand then co-hosted \"The Russell Brand Show\" beginning in on BBC Radio 6 Music. In November 2006, the show transferred to BBC Radio 2 and aired on Saturdays from 9–11pm. The show regularly drew about 400,000 listeners. In an episode of the show broadcast on 18 October 2008, Brand and fellow Radio 2 DJ Jonathan Ross made a series of phone calls to actor Andrew Sachs in which Brand alleged on air that he had had sex with Sachs' granddaughter. Sunday tabloid \"The Mail on Sunday\" broke the story and regarded the phone calls as obscene. Both presenters were later suspended by the BBC because of the incident, and Brand resigned from his show. The BBC was later fined £150,000 by Ofcom, Britain's broadcast regulator for airing the calls.\n\nBrand returned to radio when he and Noel Gallagher hosted a one-off football talk show on 19 April 2009 for Talksport. Brand returned to Talksport on 9 October 2010, with a Saturday night show that lasted 20 weeks. The show featured clips and back-stage recordings from his \"Booky Wook 2\" promotional tour. Brand was joined by a host of guests, including Noel Gallagher and Jonathan Ross.\n\nBrand launched a twice weekly podcast called \"The Russell Brand Podcast\" on 25 February 2015, through audioBoom. The podcast reunited Brand with his radio presenting team of Matt Morgan and poet Mr Gee. The podcast ended after 24 episodes. In 2017 Brand launched a new podcast called \"Under the Skin with Russell Brand\" which has him interviewing guests from the world of academia, popular culture and the arts.\n\nBrand's first autobiography, \"My Booky Wook\", was released on 15 November 2007 and received favorable reviews. Andrew Anthony from \"The Observer\" commented that \"Russell Brand's gleeful tale of drugs and debauchery in \"My Booky Wook\" puts most other celebrity memoirs to shame\". The second book, \"\", was released on 30 September 2010. Brand signed a £1.8 million two-book deal with HarperCollins in June 2008. The first book, \"Articles of Faith\", examined Brand's philosophy and consisted of a collection of columns from \"The Guardian\" which first appeared there in 2007 and 2008. The book was published on 16 October 2008, and also includes Brand interviewing Noel Gallagher, James Corden, and David Baddiel about football.\n\nFrom 2006 until 2009, Brand wrote a column for \"The Guardian\" that focused on West Ham United and the England national football team. A collection of the columns from 2006 and 2007 was released in a book entitled \"Irons in the Fire\". Brand continues to write articles for \"The Guardian\" that offer his perspectives on current events and pop culture, including the deaths of Amy Winehouse and Robin Williams. Following the 2011 London riots, Brand wrote a column in which he criticized the government's response to the riots in Summer 2011 as a failure to address the root causes.\n\nBrand made his children's book debut in November 2014 with \"Russell Brand's Trickster Tales: The Pied Piper of Hamelin\". It is the first installment of an intended series, featuring illustrations by Chris Riddell. In \"The Guardian\", reviewer Lucy Mangan noted: \"The on-Brand need to be noticed is there on every page, his unwillingness to get out of the way of the story tripping the reader up at every turn\" and adding that Chris Riddell’s illustrations \"give the book a beauty it does not deserve and a coherence the text does not deliver\". Nicholas Tucker, in \"The Independent\", was even less impressed, noting the book's \"wearingly offensive\" language, and writing:\nWere it not for his celebrity, this book in manuscript would surely have been returned to its author by any publisher along perhaps with some kindly advice for seeking out an anger-management course. But Brand’s take on The Pied Piper of Hamelin is the first of a series of riffs on traditional fairy and folk tales. If they are all as bad as this one, British children’s books will have hit a new low.\n\nHis book \"Revolution\", in which Brand develops his earlier ideas, was published by Random House in October 2014 and received much publicity. Nick Cohen of \"The Observer\" called Brand's writing \"atrocious: long-winded, confused and smug; filled with references to books Brand has half read and thinkers he has half understood.\" On the other hand, Steve Richards in \"The Independent\" commented: \"Brand writes and speaks with verve, words flowing effortlessly and musically. The contrast with the tame wooden prose of elected politicians is marked.\"\n\nIn September 2017 Brand published \"Recovery: Freedom from Our Addictions\".\n\nIn January 2009, Brand participated in a celebrity letter to \"The Independent\"—as a supporter of the Hoping Foundation—to condemn Israel's assault on Gaza, and the \"cruel and massive loss of life of the citizens of Gaza\". In February 2009, Brand and several other entertainers wrote to \"The Times\" in defense of Bahá'í leaders, who were on trial in Iran at the time. In April 2009, he attended the 2009 G-20 London summit protests and spoke to the press.\n\nBrand was selected by the Dalai Lama to host the Buddhist leader's 2012 youth event in Manchester. The Dalai Lama's representatives explained that Brand was selected because he had proved \"the power of spirituality to effect change in his own life\", while Brand stated to the BBC after the event: \"I said yes because he's the living incarnation of Buddha and I thought, if you're around the Dalai Lama, that can only be good for your spiritual quest through life. He's an amazing diplomat, an incredible activist, a wonderful human being and an inspiration to us all.\"\n\nIn April 2012, Brand testified in front of a parliamentary committee about drug addiction, sharing his experiences and view that drugs should be decriminalised. He said, \"I'm not a legal expert. I'm saying that, to a drug addict, the legal aspect is irrelevant. If you need to get drugs, you will. The criminal and legal status, I think, sends the wrong message. Being arrested isn't a lesson, it's just an administrative blip.\" Part of this testimony was included in a BBC Three documentary, \"Russell Brand: From Addiction to Recovery\", that aired in December 2012. Brand said he felt compelled to make the film after the 2011 death of close friend Amy Winehouse, and he used the opportunity to also question how British society \"deals with addicts and addiction.\"\n\nIn June 2013, Brand appeared in a video in support of Chelsea Manning.\n\nSince 2013, Brand has appeared more frequently as a campaigner for serious issues rather than an entertainer. On 23 October 2013, Brand was interviewed by Jeremy Paxman for the BBC's \"Newsnight\" and was challenged about his call for \"revolution\" and whether someone who had never voted could edit a political magazine. In the issue of the \"New Statesman\", published on 24 October 2013, Brand's essay explained his objection to the destruction of earth through greed and exploitation, and called for a change in consciousness to accompany political and economic measures to achieve a more sustainable future. Nick Cohen in \"The Guardian\" commented about Brand: \"He writes as if he is a precocious prepubescent rather than an adolescent: a child, born after the millennium, who can behave as if we never lived through the 20th century.\"\n\nJeremy Paxman interviewed Brand on \"Newsnight\" in 2013, in which he disparaged the British political system as ineffectual and encouraged the British electorate not to vote. When asked by Paxman what a revolution would look like, Brand replied:\nBritish commentator Joan Smith dismissed Brand as the \"canny self-publicist\" who indulges in \"waffle about 'revolution'\" as \"one celebrity, I'm afraid, who's more idiot than savant.\" Former \"Independent\" editor Simon Kelner largely defended his appearance on \"Newsnight\": \"It sounded rather attractive, even if it wasn't exactly worked through. But Brand's rhetorical flourishes made up for the lack of detail\". A few months later, documentary film maker Adam Curtis, in an interview for the \"New Humanist\" magazine, questioned Brand's advocacy of not voting in elections: \"Who benefits from that? The unelected powerful, because you’re emotionally and psychologically disempowering politicians. The only power politicians have is the collective confidence we have in them. The most radical thing is to recapture the idea you can change the world.\"\n\nIn January 2014, Brand was invited by the Cambridge Union Society to participate in an interview, held in the Union's debating chamber with Leo Kirby, the Union's 2014 Speakers' Officer. The interview ran for more than an hour and was published on the Union's YouTube channel.\n\nBrand launched his YouTube series \"The Trews: True News with Russell Brand\" on 27 February 2014, in which he \"analyses the news, truthfully, spontaneously and with great risk to his personal freedom.\" In addition to news analysis, he regularly has guests on the show, including economists, journalists and activists. By the end of the year, more than 200 episodes had been released on the channel. The show was halted for nearly a year as he decided to be away from social media to focus on his personal and professional growth.\n\nIn June 2014, he took part in the People's Assembly Against Austerity, that attracted an estimated 50,000 people marching from the BBC office to Westminster. Brand addressed the crowd, saying, \"The people of this building [the House of Commons] generally speaking do not represent us, they represent their friends in big business. It's time for us to take back our power. Power isn't there, it is here, within us. The revolution that's required isn't a revolution of radical ideas, but the implementation of ideas we already have.\"\n\nIn September 2014, Brand lent his support to the Fire Brigades Union, giving a speech at the union's rally against cuts in London and asking the public to support the firefighters.\n\nIn October 2014, at the time Brand's book \"Revolution\" was published, John Lydon (also known as \"Johnny Rotten\" of the Sex Pistols), in an interview with Polly Toynbee of \"The Guardian\", said that Brand's advocacy of non-voting is \"the most idiotic thing I’ve ever heard.\" In a November 2014 YouGov poll, involving a selection of celebrities, Brand was chosen as the one with the most negative influence on political debate (46%). The poll also found that 60% of poll participants disliked him and 28% liked him.\n\nShortly afterward, Brand appeared on \"Newsnight\" again, but was interviewed by Evan Davis on this occasion. Asked about 9/11 conspiracy theories and whether the attacks were perpetuated by the American government, Brand commented: \"[w]e have to remain open-minded to [that] kind of possibility\", although this section of the interview ended with Brand insisting that he did not \"want to talk about daft conspiracy theories.\" Hadley Freeman in \"The Guardian\" mocked the opinions he expressed in the interview: \"I’m not entirely sure where he thinks he’s going to go with this revolution idea because [SPOILER!] revolution is not going to happen.\"\nBBC Three commissioned Brand to make a documentary on the global \"War on Drugs\", which aired on 26 November 2014. The film, titled \"Russell Brand: End the Drugs War\", shows him exploring the illicit drug policies of other countries in search of a compassionate approach to people who use illicit drugs. Brand explains in the documentary, \"People think compassion is 'wet liberalism'; it's not, it's pragmatic\". Brand worked with the Matchlight Ltd production company, director Ross Wilson and executive producer Liz Hartford.\n\nOn 2 December 2014, Brand joined East London residents to protest over the increase in rents at the New Era housing estate. During a protest for the New Era residents, \"Channel 4 News\" reporter Paraic O'Brien continually pushed Brand to answer questions about the value of his own property, which is rented. The line of questioning irritated Brand, who ended up calling the reporter a \"snide\"—the short clip went viral on YouTube.\n\nLater that month, on 11 December, Brand appeared on the BBC's \"Question Time\" programme which included the UK Independence Party's leader Nigel Farage as one of the other panellists. Brand called Farage \"a pound shop Enoch Powell\" on-air, and the two men continued to trade insults after the programme had ended. In the wake of the \"Question Time\" episode, one journalist concluded that neither Brand nor Farage emerged victorious, with the former accused of \"preaching\", while a supporter of Brand wrote that the comedian was out of his element: \"I'm not saying he didn't make an impact. I agree with most of what he has to say, and I'm glad he was on \"Question Time\"—in the heart of the establishment—saying it. But in terms of his performance or identity, he looks caught between two stools.\"\nIn January 2015, during the television show \"Channel 4's Big Fat Anniversary Quiz\", Brand insulted politician Ed Balls, calling him a \"clicky-wristed snidey cunt\". Balls responded by calling Brand a \"pound shop Ben Elton.\"\n\nIn March 2015, Brand announced he would use money from his \"Revolution\" book to open a café, the Trew Era Cafe on the New Era estate in the London Borough of Hackney, which would employ recovering drug addicts. The café opened on 26 March.\n\nIn March 2015, readers of \"Prospect\" magazine voted Brand the fourth-most influential thinker in the world, behind Thomas Piketty, Yanis Varoufakis, and Naomi Klein.\n\nBrand and director Michael Winterbottom worked together to produce a documentary, \"The Emperor's New Clothes\", that had its international premiere on 24 April 2015 at the Tribeca Film Festival. The film features archival footage with appearances by Brand in London and New York City, examining the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and global economic inequality. The documentary is produced by Brand's Revolution Films company and distributed by StudioCanal UK.\n\nOn 29 April 2015, eight days ahead of 2015 UK general election, Brand published an interview with Labour leader Ed Miliband on an episode of \"The Trews\" as part of a \"Trews Politics Week\" series. Miliband claimed that he took part in order to win over people like Brand who do not vote, although his opponent David Cameron deemed the entire interview a \"joke\". The following day Brand released an interview with Green Party leader Natalie Bennett and Green MP Caroline Lucas, giving his support to Lucas in Brighton advising people there to vote Green, adding that \"In most cases it don’t matter if you don’t vote Green\". He also criticized an election \"set up not to represent people's wishes\".\n\nFollowing these interviews, three days before the election, Brand released the final episode of \"The Trews Politics Week\" entitled \"Emergency: VOTE To Start Revolution\" releasing additional material from his discussion with Ed Miliband and stating \"I think we've got no choice but to take decisive action to end the danger of the Conservative party\". He dropped his anti-voting position and \"declared the importance of voting\", backing Labour and telling his fans that \"You gotta vote Labour\", although he admitted \"that he couldn't be sure of the reality of what a Labour government would mean\". He has also stated that Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is \"a nice chap\".\n\nThis U-turn triggered a backlash from his fans as he had \"decided to endorse Labour in the eleventh hour – after registration had closed.\" and many blamed the low youth turn out in the election on Brand, claiming that it contributed to the Conservative win. Brand was not registered to vote in the 2015 election.\n\nOn 20 August 2015, Brand released episode 366 of \"The Trews\" titled \"Final Episode Of The Trews - Goodbye, Good Luck\", which he said would be the final episode of the series. The Trews returned on 12 October 2016.\n\nIn August 2015, Brand endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He said: \"Jeremy Corbyn would be a better kind of new Labour. The fear would be, can party politics ever impact the will of the people?\" In May 2017, Brand endorsed Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 general election he wrote in \"The Huffington Post\" that Corbyn \"has the qualities I want in a strong and stable leader\". He wrote: \"Whether it's the Iraq War or badger-baiting, Corbyn has been allied with common sense and compassion in pretty much every Parliamentary argument.\" He praised Corbyn for his long record of sticking to his principles and for standing up to the media's treatment of him. Regarding the 2015 election he said: \"You know I never actually said 'don't vote? I said 'There's no point in voting when the main political parties are basically indistinguishable and the relationship between government, big business and factions of the media make it impossible for the democratic will of the people to be realised, which is a more nuanced point and plainly true. Anyway, that was then and this is now.\"\n\nAs of 2018, Brand was podcasting interviews with thinkers such as Yuval Noah Harari (13/10/18).\n\nOn 16 September 2010, Brand was arrested on suspected battery charges after he allegedly attacked a paparazzo who blocked his and then-fiancée Katy Perry's way to catch a flight at Los Angeles International Airport. The paparazzo placed Brand under citizen's arrest until the police arrived and he was released from custody the next day after posting US$20,000 bail. On 15 March 2012, an arrest warrant was issued for Brand in New Orleans, U.S., because of allegations that he had thrown a photographer's mobile phone through a window. The paparazzo was taking pictures of Brand with an iPhone when Brand wrestled the device from his hands and tossed it at a law firm's window. The warrant cited \"simple criminal damage to property\", leading Brand, who offered to pay for the replacement of the window, to voluntarily appear at a police station. Brand was filming a movie in New Orleans at the time of the incident.\n\nBrand was ejected from the \"GQ\" Awards show on 3 September 2013 after receiving the \"Oracle\" award. In his acceptance speech, he mentioned sponsor Hugo Boss' former business making uniforms for the Nazi regime. Brand said, \"They [Nazis] did look fucking fantastic, let's face it\" before he goose stepped across the stage in a comical imitation of the Nazi march. Brand was eventually ejected from the event after \"GQ\" editor Dylan Jones confronted Brand with his view that the speech was \"very offensive\"—Brand replied by saying that the Nazis' treatment of the Jewish people was \"very offensive\". Brand was later given the opportunity to reflect on the award night on the \"Guardian\" website:\nNow I'm aware that this [\"GQ\" award speech] was really no big deal ... It was a daft joke by a daft comic at a daft event. It makes me wonder, though, how the relationships and power dynamics I witnessed on this relatively inconsequential context are replicated on a more significant scale ... Ought we be concerned that our rights to protest are being continually eroded under the guise of enhancing our safety? ... When you take a breath and look away from the spectacle it's amazing how absurd it seems when you look back.\n\nIn June 2015, the \"Daily Mail\" revealed that Brand was selling sweatshirts stated to be British-made, while they were in fact made in Bangladesh by workers earning under US$1 per hour. He said that he was unaware of this, and had terminated his relationship with the manufacturer as a result.\n\nBrand has been said to dress in a \"flamboyant bohemian fashion\" and has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar disorder. He also suffered from bulimia, pornography addiction, and experienced a period of self-harming. Brand has described the concept of \"fame\" \"like ashes\" in his mouth.\n\nBrand has shown interest in the Hare Krishna Movement and wrote in a 2007 \"Guardian\" column: \"I say Hare Krishna as often as possible, sometimes even when I'm not being filmed\". Additionally, during an interview on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" in October 2010, Brand talked about his love of Transcendental Meditation (TM). This love of TM was reaffirmed in a 2013 \"New Statesman\" editorial he wrote: \"Through Transcendental Meditation, twice daily I feel the bliss of the divine... I connect to a boundless consciousness that has no palpable relationship with my thoughts, fears or desires.\" He has also gravitated toward Christian spirituality and practice by daily reciting the Lord's Prayer and attempting to have Christ consciousness.\n\nIn 2011, Brand served as best man at Noel Gallagher's wedding to Sara MacDonald.\n\nBrand lives in Shoreditch, London after previously residing in a $2.2 million mansion in Los Angeles.\n\nRussell Brand is a vegetarian.\n\nBrand met singer Katy Perry in mid-2009 when she filmed a cameo for his film \"Get Him to the Greek,\" although the cameo was cut from the film. They began dating after meeting again at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards in September, when Perry threw a water bottle at his head from across the room during rehearsal. The two became engaged on New Year's Eve 2009 during a holiday in India, and married there on 23 October 2010 in a Hindu ceremony, near the Ranthambhore tiger sanctuary in Rajasthan.\n\nOn 30 December 2011, Brand filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences, which was finalized in July 2012. Perry's July 2012 autobiographical documentary, \"\", revealed that conflicting career schedules and Perry not feeling ready to have children led to the end of their marriage. In June, Perry told \"Vogue\" that Brand did not like the idea of her \"being the boss\" of things, and the last time she heard from him was 31 December 2011, when he sent her an SMS message informing her he was divorcing her.\n\nDays after his divorce was finalized, Brand told Howard Stern that he was extremely in love with Perry, but after marrying her realized \"this isn't really working out ... I was really, really in love with her, but it was difficult to see each other ... it mostly didn't work for practical reasons.\" While Stern pressed for details, Brand declined, saying, \"I don't want anything to hurt her. She’s younger than me, she’s a young woman and she’s beautiful and she’s sensitive and I care about her deeply.\" Brand, who married Perry without a prenuptial agreement, was eligible to claim half of the estimated $44 million she earned during their marriage, but declined.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2014, Brand was in a relationship with Jemima Khan, an editor of the \"New Statesman\", and a daughter of financier Sir James Goldsmith. In May 2014, Brand received libel damages from \"The Sun\" following a story the paper had printed in November 2013 alleging that he had cheated on Khan. Brand said he would be donating the unspecified damages to the Hillsborough Justice Campaign. Brand and Khan ended their relationship in September 2014.\n\nIn the October 2014 issue of \"Vanity Fair\", Brand said of the allegations of misogyny made against him: \"I have lived a life and had a frame of cultural references that make that charge quite legitimate... But as a person who’s trying to live a decent, spiritual life, misogyny is not part of my current palette of behaviors... In a way, redemption is a great part of my narrative. I’m talking about disavowing previous lives, previous beliefs, previous behaviours.\"\n\nSince 2015, Brand has been in a relationship with Scottish lifestyle blogger Laura Gallacher, whom he had dated off and on since 2007. Gallacher is the sister of television presenter Kirsty Gallacher. Brand suggested in an Instagram post in July 2016 that he and Gallacher were expecting a child. Their daughter Mabel was born in November 2016. Brand married Gallacher in Henley-on-Thames on 26 August 2017. In July 2018, Brand and Gallacher had a second daughter.\n\nThe media published articles on Brand during his drug-using period, typically in relation to incidents, and his public profile has since been associated with this era. Drug-related issues led to Brand's arrest on 12 occasions. Brand was ejected from the Gilded Balloon in Edinburgh, Scotland and following a subsequent show in the city in 2004, a reviewer stated that \"you'd rather hug him than hit him\", as he had embraced recovery by this point. Following the cessation of his use, Brand revealed through his stand-up performances that he introduced his drug dealer to Kylie Minogue during his time at MTV and masturbated a stranger in a public toilet for a television programme. In January 2014, Brand described his first experience with heroin as \"blissful\".\n\nBrand has abstained from drug use since 13 December 2002. He is a patron of the Focus 12 drug treatment programme after his own use of the service. Brand's sobriety was instigated by his agent, John Noel, after Brand was apprehended using heroin in a bathroom during a Christmas party. Brand cites his practice of transcendental meditation as a significant factor in his recovery from drug dependence. Brand organised three fundraisers for Focus 12 in London, Dublin and Belfast in 2009, and has also acted as a \"sponsor\" for numerous people during the rehabilitation stage of their treatment process.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "164070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164070", "title": "Sexual ritual", "text": "Sexual ritual\n\nSexual rituals fall into two categories: culture-created, and natural behaviour, the human animal having developed \"sex rituals\" from evolutionary instincts for reproduction, which are then integrated into society, and elaborated to include aspects such as marriage rites, dances, etc. Arguably indeed, 'sex in its more ritualized and symbolic varieties...has moulded the shape of civilization'.\n\nSometimes sexual rituals are highly formalized and/or part of religious activity, as in the cases of Hieros gamos, the hierodule and the OTO. Contemporary sacred sexual rituals have been tagged as 'structured, symbolic, manifestation, ceremonies, tradition, everyday, habit, grounding, magic, solemn'.\n\nPart of the rites of passage of growing up are what have been termed 'rites of separation from the asexual world...followed by rites of incorporation into the world of sexuality'. These may be formal or semi-formal—'for some students, going to college is partly a sexual ritual, like the ceremonial dances of the whooping crane'—or take the form of a more private induction: 'formal and artificial...the impression that a long-established rite was to be enacted, among Staffordshire figurs and \"papier-mâché\" trays, with the compelling, detached formality of nightmare'.\n\nFreud was particularly interested in Ethnological accounts of 'the \"ceremonial\" (purely formal, ritual, or official) coitus, which takes place' in connection with 'the taboo of virginity'.\n\nFreud also noted that in 'numerous examples of marriage ceremonies there can be no doubt that people other than the bridegroom, for example his assistants and companions (our traditional \"groomsmen\"), granted full sexual access to the bride'. To his followers, 'the \"wedding as orgy\", with the bride taking on all the men present, is the clear historical reality behind the modern jokes...and the climactic line-up or \"gang\"-kissing of the bride, by all the men present'.\n\nIn such a view, 'other examples of sacred or permitted public coitus of all women with all men do survive, in similarly modified \"kissing\" form', as under the mistletoe 'to revive the dying sun at the winter solstice, when the strongest human \"life-magic\", namely ritual intercourse, is to be deployed'.\n\nTo the sociologist looking upon 'sexual intercourse as interaction ritual...sexual intercourse is the ritual of love; it both creates and recreates the social tie (since Durkheimian rituals need to be repeated periodically, as solidarity runs down), and symbolizes it'. In similar fashion, Margot Anand has pointed out that 'rituals pervade our daily life and give it a sense of ceremony and celebration(...)a ritual, through your own unique symbolic gestures...will help you transform your lovemaking into a special and sacred act'.\n\nErving Goffman has noted however 'the considerable informational delicacy of this form of interaction', and how 'individuals may use darkness to ensure strategic ambiguity'.\n\nIn perversion, sexual rituals may emerge as a necessary part of sexual activity. For the criminologist, 'sexual ritual involves repeatedly engaging in an act or series of acts in a certain manner because of a sexual need'. Within a relationship, 'the Compulsive libido type takes advantages of opportunities to use the specific sexual ritual that causes intense arousal, and in its stronger form, the Compulsive lover can only arouse using the sexual object or ritual\".\n\nIn any relationship however, 'a sexual habit that becomes routine or stylised...can lead to a sexual ritual', so that 'if you don't have a way to talk to your partner about your sexual relationship, you may find yourself...stuck in sexual rituals that could be limiting your sexual enjoyment': as a wife might say, '\"Same old technique, same old Lewis. It's you all right, I'd know that old routine anywhere'. Thus one's sex life may all 'be about rituals: the ritual of sex in the morning, or the ritual of sex at night; and the ritual of sex at anniversaries, and the ritual of sex at Christmas'.\n\nIn the Buddhist art of India, Bhutan, Nepal and Tibet, yab-yum is the male deity in sexual union with his female consort. The symbolism is associated with Anuttarayoga tantra where the male figure is usually linked to compassion (\"\") and skillful means (\"upāya-kauśalya\"), and the female partner to 'insight' (\"prajñā\").\n\nThe symbolism of union and sexual polarity is a central teaching in Tantric Buddhism, especially in Tibet. The union is realised by the practitioner as a mystical experience within one's own body. Yab-yum is generally understood to represent the primordial (or mystical) union of wisdom and compassion.\n\nTantric Buddhism is itself an outcrop of Tantrism, advanced techniques of which included 'the ritual sex act (Maithuna) which was a feature of Tantric yoga'. Given that 'sex is holy to a Tantric...Tantric art, writings and religious rituals glorify sex'.\n\nA sex organ 'makes an admirable fertility symbol, and has been worshipped as such privately from time to time, or even publicly...gives dramatic promise of productivity and protection'. Such \"worship\" may only become more common in late modernity, as 'in our secular culture sexuality often replaces religion as a means of pursuing the meaning of life'.\n\nAlan Watts maintains that 'when you are in love with someone, you do indeed see them as a divine being...through a tremendous outpouring of psychic energy in total devotion and worship for this other person'. A woman may 'want someone who adores me...like he was adoring my breasts with his hands'. A man (more ambivalently) may muse on 'the white breasts he worships; adores; is scared of; detests'. For Shakespeare, 'this is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity, a green goose a goddess; pure, pure idolatry'.\n\nIn the further reaches of chick lit, ' the male organ...becomes a tower of strength, a tree trunk in girth, the pillar that sustains the universe...a Pillar of Hercules, sustaining heaven'—evidence perhaps that 'the phallic religious tendency is alive in the modern and the civilized...a compulsive fascination' with what Jung termed 'the phallus as the quintessence of life and fruitfulness'. Correspondingly, the Western adept may borrow, in the quest 'to create a Sacred Space...names given to the vagina in the East, including Valley of Joy, Great Jewel, Pearl, Lotus Blossom, Moist Cave, Ripe Peach, Enchanted Garden, and Full Moon'.\n\nIn the \"Satyricon\", the hero is throughout 'hounded by the mighty rage of Priapus of Hellespont'—almost certainly because early on he 'has offended Priapus...by impersonating him in some sexual ceremonies'.\n\n"}
{"id": "1590969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1590969", "title": "Shashti Poorthi", "text": "Shashti Poorthi\n\nShashti Poorti is a Sanskrit word meaning completion of sixty. Also known also as \"Shashti Abda Poorti\" or \"Ugraratha Santi\" or மணி விழா (mani vizha)) is a Hindu ceremony celebrating the 60th birthday of a male, akin to the renewal of marital vows.\n\nShashti Poorti is celebrated on completion of 60 years of age of the male. This term is derived from Sanskrit in which Shashti means sixty; abda–year; poorthi-completion. It marks completion of half the years of one's lifetime as in Hinduism, 120 years is considered the life span of a human being. The sixtieth year in one’s life is a significant milestone, memorable turning point, a touching reminder of the rich, mellowed life that would unfold in the years to come. In fact, the Hindu calendar has 60 years (named Prabhava, Vibhava, etc.) that repeat themselves after every 60 years in a sequence. Shashti poorthi marks the completion of one such cycle. For example, a person born in the year Pramodoota and has lived for 60 years will have seen all the 60 years in the calendar. This milestone marks celebration and gratitude for life given by God. So once his birthday arrives in Pramodootha year, he performs his Shashti poorthi. In recent days, children started doing this ritual to their parents, just as their parents performed all of their rituals in their childhood.\n\nOne more important aspect of Shashtiabdha poorthi is that all the planets in the zodiac come to the same positions or occupy the same houses of zodiac as compared to the actual date of birth of the individual. These planets take the same position as they were on the date of birth of the individual after 60 years. That is why the Celebration is performed on the same lunar day when the moon conjoins the birth star of the individual on the same month and the same year in which he was born.\n\nThe veda says \"Janmaabde, Janmamaasecha Swajanmadivase tathaa, Janmarshe chaiva kartavyaa santi rugrarathaahvayaa, Devaalaye nadeeteere swagruhe vaa subhasthale.\"\n\nThe sages and the rishis of lore have acknowledged the sanctity of the sixtieth year in one’s life and have drawn out elaborate rituals to mark this special event. They looked at it as rebirth and suggested the repetition of those rituals performed at one’s birth. Hence this celebration at this point of life is a sacred part of the hallowed Vedic culture.\n\nThe Shastipoorti Santi should be performed in the sixty first year and in the same month and day of birth according to the Indian Zodiac. This is considered to be the best option. In case it is not possible to time it exactly on the same day, allowance is given to perform it on a convenient day during and before the completion of sixtieth year. The choice of the place to carry out this tradition could be a pilgrim town, a temple, a river bank or even one's residence. As part of the celebrations the couple's children perform their parents' second wedding. This is reason for a grand family reunion to incorporate an important event in the couple's married life.\n\nThe rituals carved out as part of Shanti are also referred to as Ugraradha Santi. Ugraradha is nothing but the harsh natured time. In a hundred-year time scale of man's life, pre-sixty is a period of materialistic pursuit while the post-sixty span is slated for spiritual endeavour. The Ugraradha Shanti is a prayer sent to the heavens to make the post-sixty span a spiritually fulfilling experience.\n\nThree different ways are chiseled to carry out the Santi aspect. They are \"Sounakoktam, Bodhaayanoktam and Saivaagamoktam\".\n\nThe basic elements of these three ways remain the same, though the contents vary marginally. Of all, Saivaagamokta Shanti is very elaborate and ritual-laden. Given its exhaustive scope of rituals, only a limited few like the kings and the emperors can follow it in toto, though it is not entirely ruled out for devout householders.\n\nAfter the successful completion of the \"Shanti\" programme, the Kranthi programme follows in which \"Kalyaanam\" is very important. \"Kranthi\" means \"to step ahead\" and signifies heading towards a new life.\n\n\"Shastipoorti\" is a good bridge - builder between the householder's domestic concerns and Vaanaprasta's spiritual yearnings. During Vaanaprastha, the married couple is to fulfill their life's mission by staying together through observance of celibacy. The \"Kalyaana Veduka\" is a reminder of the unique role they are to play in the years to come. Marriage in the younger days promises physical proximity, while the one performed now brings about spiritual affinity.\n\nThus the Shanti - Kranthi aspects, which run through the \"Shastipoorthi\" celebrations provide a fusion of spiritual and social obligations which are the very bed rock the Indian culture.\n\nThis ceremony should be performed as per Guru and elderly persons instructions. Generally this ceremony is two days programme. The ceremony is commenced in Shubha Muhurutham by performing \"Yamuna Pooja\", followed by the \"Ganga Pooja\", \"Ishta Devatha Vandana\", \"Sabha Vandana\", \"Punyaha with Panchagaavya Sevana\", \"Naandi Pooja\", \"Ruthwikgvarana\" and Kalasha Sthapana\".\n\nKalasha sthapana of the deities - \"Maha Ganapathi\", \"Adithyadhi Navagraha\", \"Mrutunjaya\",\"Samvatsara-Aayana-Ruthu-Maasa-Paksha-Yoga devatha\", \"Karana devatha\", \"Raashyadhipathi (pathi and pathni)\", \"Navadurga\", \"Sapthama Maru Devatha\", \"Dwadasa Aditya - Dhata, Aryama, Mitra, Varuna, Indra, Vivasvan, Tvashtha, Vishnu, Amshuman, Bhaga, Pusha and Parjanja\", \"Ayurdevatha, Istadevatha, Kuladevatha\".

He is also known as \"the Rebbe \"nishmosei eiden\"\" (whose soul is in Eden) and as \"the Rebbe Rashab\" (for Reb Sholom Ber).\n\nHis teachings represent the emergence of an emphasis on outreach that later Chabad Rebbes developed into a major theme.\n\nHe was born in Lubavitch, on 20 Cheshvan 1860, the second son of Shmuel Schneersohn, the fourth Chabad \"Rebbe\". In 1882, when his father died, he was not quite 22 years old, and his brother Reb Zalman Aharon was not much older. A period followed, during which both brothers fulfilled some of the tasks of a rebbe, but neither felt ready to take on the title and responsibilities. Over this period he gradually took on more responsibilities, particularly in dealing with the impact of the May Laws, and on Rosh Hashanah 5643 (10 September 1892 OS) he accepted the leadership of the Lubavitch movement.\n\nHe married his cousin, Rebbetzin Shterna Sara Schneersohn. She was the daughter of Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn of Avorutch, a son of the Tzemach Tzedek. They had one son whom they named Yosef Yitzchok after Rebbetzin Shterna Sara's father. Yosef Yitzchok later succeeded his father as Rebbe.\n\nIn his early 40s he suffered a loss of sensation in his left hand, and in 1903 he spent two months in Vienna, where Sigmund Freud treated him with electrotherapy. The treatment had some success, restoring some feeling to the hand, but he was unable to stay in Vienna longer than two months. When he returned home he attempted to continue his treatment with a small machine that he had bought in Vienna, but experienced no further improvement and eventually gave up.\n\nIn 1915, as the fighting in World War I neared Lubavitch, the Rashab moved to Rostov-on-Don. As Bolshevik forces approached Rostov he considered moving to Israel, (which was under Turkish authority at the time) and prepared all the necessary paperwork; his only extant picture comes from his Turkish visa, since he usually refused to be photographed. But eventually he decided to stay in Rostov, where he died on 21 March 1920.\n\nDuring the construction of the \"Rostov Palace of Sport\" on top of the Old Jewish Cemetery in 1940, his remains were secretly moved by a devout group of chassidim to a different burial site where they are located to this day in the \"Rostov Jewish Cemetery.\" While relocating his grave, the chassidim found his body full and not decomposed even though this was a full twenty years later. His grave is visited daily by followers of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement who come from all over the world.\n\nRabbi Schneersohn established the first Chabad yeshiva, Tomchei Temimim, in 1897. In 1911 he established another yeshivah, Toras Emes, in Palestine, and in 1916 he established a yeshivah in Georgia. Avrum Erlich has argued that it was these institutions that made Lubavitch the dominant of the various Chabad Hasidic movements.\n\nHe maintained a lengthy correspondence, not only with Chabad Chasidim in other countries, but also with non-Chabad chasidim and members of other groups who wrote to him for advice. He also met with other Jewish and hasidic leaders, working with them on issues such as education, unity, policy, and strategy. He was held in high esteem by the Chofetz Chaim, so much so that the Chofetz Chaim declared of him, \"the words of the [Lubavitcher] Rebbe are holy, and anyone who argues disagrees with him [should know that] it is as if he is disagreeing with Moses.\"\n\nRabbi Schneersohn promoted Jewish agricultural settlement, and the creation of employment for Jews, particularly those displaced by the May Laws. He was a prominent opponent of Zionism, both in its secular and religious versions, and a staunch ally of Reb Chaim Brisker. In 1903 he published \"Kuntres Uma'ayan\", which contained a strong polemic against Zionism. He was deeply concerned that secular nationalism would replace Judaism as the foundation of Jewish identity. Together with Reb Chaim he joined and supported Machazikei Hadas - a union of Eastern European haredim and the forerunner of the Agudah - but in 1912, when the Agudah was formed in Katowice, Reb Chaim raised 18 objections to its constitution, and the Rashab kept Lubavitch out of the Agudah.\n\nAfter the February Revolution, elections were called for Jewish city councils and a General Jewish Assembly. The Rebbe Rashab worked tirelessly to organize a religious front with a center and a special office to deal with it all. For this reason, he called a unique conference of all the Torah giants throughout Russia. This conference was held in 1917 in Moscow, and was preceded by a meeting of the leading Rabbis, to decide the matters to be discussed there. This smaller meeting was held in Petrograd. However, because the participants in this meeting were few and in a hurry to return home, the Moscow conference failed to yield proper results. Thus, it was necessary to convene once again in Kharkiv in 1918, to discuss the elections for the General Jewish Assembly.\n\nHis worries about the Mountain Jews, or \"Berg Yidden\", led him to send a famous Mashpia, Rabbi Shmuel Levitin of Rakshik, to the Caucasus to set up institutions to bring them closer to traditional Judaism, setting a precedent for his two successors as Lubavitcher Rebbe, who conducted similar activities.\n\nDistinguished disciples of the Rebbe Rashab include Reb Itche Der Masmid, Reb Levi Yitzchok Schneerson, and Reb Zalman Moishe HaYitzchaki. The Malach \n\nKnown informally as \"Rambam (Maimonides) of Chabad Chassidus\" (from his encyclopedic work on developing Chabad Chassidic philosophy into an organized system), Rebbe Rashab was a prolific writer on Chabad theology. Much of his work has been published in Hebrew, and some of it has been translated into English, and is available online.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "64647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64647", "title": "Sultan", "text": "Sultan\n\nSultan (; ', ) is a position with several historical meanings. Originally, it was an Arabic abstract noun meaning \"strength\", \"authority\", \"rulership\", derived from the verbal noun ', meaning \"authority\" or \"power\". Later, it came to be used as the title of certain rulers who claimed almost full sovereignty in practical terms (i.e., the lack of dependence on any higher ruler), albeit without claiming the overall caliphate, or to refer to a powerful governor of a province within the caliphate. The adjective form of the word is \"sultanic\", and the dynasty and lands ruled by a sultan are referred to as a sultanate ( \"\").\n\nThe term is distinct from king ( \"\"), despite both referring to a sovereign ruler. The use of \"sultan\" is restricted to Muslim countries, where the title carries religious significance, contrasting the more secular \"king\", which is used in both Muslim and non-Muslim countries.\n\nA feminine form of \"sultan\", used by Westerners, is Sultana or Sultanah and this title has been used legally for some (not all) Muslim women monarchs and sultan's mothers and chief consorts. However, Turkish and Ottoman Turkish also uses \"sultan\" for imperial lady, as Turkish grammar—which is influenced by Persian grammar—uses the same words for both women and men. However, this styling misconstrues the roles of wives of sultans. In a similar usage, the wife of a German field marshal might be styled \"Frau Feldmarschall\" (similarly, in French, constructions of the type \"madame la maréchale\" are quite common). The female leaders in Muslim history are correctly known as \"sultanas\". However, the wife of the sultan in the Sultanate of Sulu is styled as the \"panguian\" while the sultan's chief wife in many sultanates of Indonesia and Malaysia are known as \"permaisuri\", \"Tunku Ampuan\", \"Raja Perempuan\", or \"Tengku Ampuan\". The queen consort in Brunei especially is known as \"Raja Isteri\" with the title of \"Pengiran Anak\" suffixed, should the queen consort also be a royal princess.\n\nIn recent years, \"sultan\" has been gradually replaced by \"king\" by contemporary hereditary rulers who wish to emphasize their secular authority under the [[rule of law]Alternatively they are also business owners that reside in Sidcup for example The Sultan of Sidcup.]\n\n[[File:Ralamb-2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Ottoman Sultan [[Mehmed IV]] attended by a eunuch and two pages.]]\nThese are generally secondary titles, either lofty 'poetry' or with a message, e.g.:\n\n\n\n[[File:Qabus bin Said.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|H.M.

This usage underlines the Ottoman conception of sovereign power as family prerogative.\n\nWestern tradition knows the Ottoman ruler as \"sultan\", but Ottomans themselves used \"padişah\" (emperor) or \"hünkar\" to refer to their ruler. The emperor's formal title consisted of \"sultan\" together with \"khan\" (for example, Sultan Suleiman Khan). In formal address, the sultan's children were also entitled \"sultan\", with imperial princes (Şehzade) carrying the title before their given name, with imperial princesses carrying it after. Example, [[Şehzade Mehmed|Şehzade Sultan Mehmed]] and [[Mihrimah Sultan]], son and daughter of Suleiman the Magnificent. Like imperial princesses, living mother and main consort of reigning sultan also carried the title after their given names, for example, [[Ayşe Hafsa Sultan]], Suleiman's mother and first [[valide sultan]], and [[Roxelana|Hürrem Sultan]], Suleiman's chief consort and first [[haseki sultan]]. The evolving usage of this title reflected power shifts among imperial women, especially between [[Sultanate of Women]], as the position of main consort eroded over the course of 17th century, the main consort lost the title \"sultan\", which replaced by \"kadin\", a title related to the earlier \"khatun\". Henceforth, the mother of the reigning sultan was the only person of non imperial blood to carry the title \"sultan\".\n\nIn [[Kazakh Khanate]] a Sultan was a lord from the ruling dynasty (a direct descendants of [[Genghis Khan]]) elected by clans, i.e. a kind of princes. The best of sultans was elected as [[khan (title)|khan]] by people at [[Kurultai]].

These administrations were often decimal (mainly in larger empires), using originally princely titles such as [[Khan (title)|khan]], [[malik]], [[amir]] as mere rank denominations.\n\nIn the [[Persian empire]], the rank of sultan was roughly equivalent to that of a modern-day [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]] in the West; socially in the fifth-rank class, styled '[[Ali Jah]].\n\n\n\n[[Category:Arabic words and phrases]]\n[[Category:Heads of state]]\n[[Category:Islamic honorifics]]\n[[Category:Military ranks]]\n[[Category:Royal titles]]\n[[Category:Noble titles]]\n[[Category:Positions of authority]]\n[[Category:Sultans| ]]\n[[Category:Titles]]\n[[Category:Ottoman titles]]\n[[Category:Titles of national or ethnic leadership]]\n[[Category:Titles in Afghanistan]]\n[[Category:Titles in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Titles in Iran]]\n[[Category:Filipino paramount rulers]]\n[[Category:Filipino royalty]]"}

It was the first in a series of temples built by Ramesses II in this region; its name Beit el-Wali means 'House of the Holy Man' and may indicate its previous use by a Christian hermit at some point in time. The temple was relocated during the 1960s as a result of the Aswan High Dam project and moved towards higher ground along with the Temple of Kalabsha. This move was coordinated with a team of Polish archaeologists financed jointly by a Swiss and Chicago Institute respectively. The temple was located 50 kilometres south of Aswan.\n\nThe Nubian temples of Ramesses II (i.e. Wadi es-Sebua, Beit el-Wali and Abu Simbel), were part of a state sponsored policy designed to maintain Egyptian control over this area. During the New Kingdom period of Egypt, Nubia was not only ruled by Egyptian officials but also subject to:\n\nThere is a large amount of original colour remaining in the inner part of this temple though the paint has disappeared from the historical scenes on its Forecourt. Near the middle of the south wall of the temple, Ramesses II is depicted charging into battle against the Nubians while his two young sons Amun-her-khepsef and Khaemwaset are shown being present in this relief scene. In the next relief scene,\n\n\"A painted cast from a wall relief\" in the Beit el-Wali temple then illustrates the wealth of exotic products which the Egyptians obtained in trade or tribute from the Kushites; here, the pharaoh receives \"leopard-skins, giraffe tails, giraffes, monkeys, leopards, cattle, antelopes, gazelles, lions, ostrich feathers and eggs, ebony, ivory, fans, bowls, shields made of [animal] hides, and gold.\" Some of the Nubians who are part of the tribute \"would be destined to be taken to Egypt to work on the king's building projects, act as policemen or be recruited into the army for service in Syria.\" The overriding theme of Egyptian military success is also hammered home on the opposite wall, where Ramesses II's triumphal campaigns in Libya and Syria were recorded: he is portrayed trampling his enemies and holding others \"by their hair in his left hand while smiting them with his right.\"\n\nThe theme of Ramesses' might is also carried into the temple's interior where there are further smiting scenes on the walls of the vestibule. Henceforth, Ramesses II is shown as a pious ruler who worships other deities; besides the doorway leading to the sanctuary \"are niches containing statues of the king with (on the left) Isis and Horus and (on the right) Khnum and Anuket, the gods of Elephantine and the First Cataract.\" The pharaoh is shown presenting vases of wine to Khnum. The deity Anuket offers Ramesses several jubilees. The sanctuary contains 3 rock-cut cult images perhaps that of Amun, Ptah and Ramesses II. The most touching scenes are on eitherside of the doorway where Ramesses is shown as a child being suckled by Isis and Anuket; however, the statue niche was destroyed later perhaps in the Christian era. The exquisite reliefs of Beit el-Wali and its unusual plan differentiates it from later temples by this pharaoh which are located further south in Nubia.\n\nThe temple of Beit el-Wali is small, and was built on a symmetrical level. It is made up of a forecourt, an anteroom with two columns and a sanctuary cut into the surrounding rock, with the exception of the entrance and the doorway. The temple was fronted by a pylon.\n\nAt the beginning of the Christian Coptic period, the temple was used as a church. Many early travellers visited the temple; its architectural and artistic details were published by Günther Roeder in 1938.\n\n"}

Since the 19th century in the West, it has been considered unlucky to remove a wedding ring once it has been placed on the finger in church.\n\nIt is commonly believed that the first examples of wedding rings were found in ancient Egypt. Relics dating to 6,000 years ago, including papyrus scrolls, are evidence of the exchange of braided rings of hemp or reeds between spouses. Ancient Egypt considered the circle to be a symbol of eternity, and the ring served to signify the perpetual love of the spouses. This was also the origin of the custom of wearing the wedding ring on the ring finger of the left hand, because the ancient Egyptians believed that this finger enclosed a special vein that was connected directly to the heart, denominated in Latin the \"Vena amoris\".\n\nThe Western traditions of wedding rings can be traced to ancient Rome and Greece, and were first associated with the marital dowry and later with a promise of fidelity. The modern exchange of rings derived from the customs of Europe in the Middle Ages as part of Christendom. In the United States, wedding rings were initially only worn by wives, but became customary for both husbands and wives during the 20th century.\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, European husbands bestowed a gimmel ring upon their wives. Similar to the puzzle ring, the gimmel ring consisted of two interlocking bands. The bride and groom both wore one of these bands after their engagement, and the two bands were reunited during the wedding ceremony. Subsequently, the wife wore the combined ring.\n\nThe poesy ring was a style of ring that was popular during the Renaissance era. It was a band of sterling silver inscribed with a poem or \"poesy\".\n\nDifferent cultures used many other historical styles of wedding ring. For example, see the image below of the Byzantine ring depicting Christ uniting bride and groom. Also, in the Middle East the puzzle ring was a historical custom: this ring consisted of several pieces that joined together into a cohesive band when worn properly. The object of this style of ring was to render it very difficult to put on the finger properly such that, if the wife removed it, her husband would know. The fede ring, being a band consisting of two hands clasped in betrothal, is another historical custom of Europe that ostensibly dates from antiquity.\n\nIn 1942 during the Second World War, British wartime restrictions on the manufacture of jewelry resulted in \"utility\" wedding rings that were limited to a maximum mass of two pennyweights, being slightly heavier than 3 grams, and were forged of 9 carat gold rather than the traditional 22 carat. The Regional Assayer Office hallmarked these rings, which guaranteed their gold content and compliance with the wartime regulations with a special utility mark adjacent to the mark for the year on the inside of the band; the hallmark resembled a capital \"U\" with the bottom curve absent or two parentheses enclosing a space, i. e., \"( )\".\n\nThe double-ring ceremony describes the exchange of wedding rings by and for both spouses. In several European nations such as the Nordic countries, it is common to exchange plain engagement rings of the same form for both sexes, and typically, an additional, more precious, and bejeweled wedding ring is given to the bride. In the nuptials, the groom's ring becomes a wedding ring also, and can be bestowed anew by the bride as a part of the wedding ceremony. The engagement is commonly a matter of agreement between the two, and the wedding rings are chosen together. Both engagement and wedding rings are worn on the left hand, the bride having both rings together. Occasionally, the groom receives a separate wedding ring. In Germany and Austria, both parties use engagement rings worn on the left hand. At the nuptials, a wedding ring is placed on the right hand, as in several east European nations, including Bulgaria, Poland, and Russia. This can be a new ring for the bride or both, or reusing the engagement rings. Any engagement rings can then remain on the left hand or be transferred to the right hand. In Germany, it has been customary for both the bride and the groom to wear a wedding ring since at least the 1870s and mentions of couples exchanging rings during the wedding ceremony in the Netherlands can be found at least as far back as 1815. In Brazil, Mexico and Spain both sexes also wear engagement rings, and the groom's ring often becomes a wedding ring in the nuptial exchange ceremony. In The Netherlands plain bands can be worn on either hand, left for Catholics and right for Protestants. When engaged, both bride and groom wear what will be the wedding band on the opposite hand and switch hands after the wedding.\n\nIn Western nations, wedding rings are often forged of rose, white, or yellow gold; palladium, platinum, argentium silver, or, more recently, silicone. The perpetuity of noble metals symbolizes the permanence of the marriage. Common engravings on the inside of the ring include the name of one's spouse, the names of both spouses, the date of the wedding, and/or a phrase of significance to the spouses. In many nations the engagement rings are plain while the bride's wedding ring commonly is bejeweled.\n\nSome customs include the wedding ring as the final of a series of gifts, which also may include the engagement ring, traditionally given as a betrothal present. This custom was practiced in ancient Rome and is possibly much older.\n\nIn several traditions, the best man or maid of honour has the duty of keeping track of a couple's wedding rings and to produce them at the symbolic moment of the giving and receiving of the rings during the traditional marriage ceremony. In more elaborate weddings, a ring bearer (who is often part of the family of the bride or groom) may assist in the ceremonial parading of the rings into the ceremony, sometimes on a special cushion.\n\nAmong Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Christians, the exchange of rings is not technically part of the wedding service, but rather are exchanged at the betrothal. It is always a two-ring set given to her by the priest or by the best man. The orthodox Christian Church of Greece has recently stopped performing betrothal blessings separately, as these were often non-committing, and now a betrothal ceremony is the initial part of the wedding service. In many families an informal blessing is now performed by the betrothed ones' parents in a family dinner that formalizes the betrothal. The ceremony of betrothal is now possibly performed immediately before the wedding (or \"crowning\" as it is more properly called), and the actual symbolic act of marriage is not the exchange of rings, but the crowning.\n\nHistorically, the wedding ring was connected to the exchange of valuables at the moment of the wedding rather than a symbol of eternal love and devotion, a sign of \"earnest money\". According to the 1549 edition of the Book of Common Prayer: after the words 'with this ring I thee wed' follow the words 'This gold and silver I give thee', at which point the groom was supposed to hand a leather purse filled with gold and silver coins to the bride. It is a relic of the times when marriage was a contract between families, not individual lovers. Both families were then eager to ensure the economic safety of the young couple. Sometimes it went as far as being a conditional exchange as this old (and today outdated) German formula shows: 'I give you this ring as a sign of the marriage which has been promised between us, provided your father gives with you a marriage portion of 1000 Reichsthalers' (approximately 20 kg of silver).\n\nModernly, after marriage the wedding ring is worn on the hand on which it had been placed during the ceremony. By wearing rings on their fourth fingers, married spouses symbolically declare their life-long love for and fidelity to each other. This symbol has public utility, and is presently expected as a matter of tradition and etiquette, so much so that its absence is often interpreted as meaning that the person is single. Many spouses wear their wedding rings day and night. When needed because of hygiene or to avoid damage, they commonly wear their rings on a necklace.\n\nSome cultures exchange additional rings: In some parts of India, Hindu women may wear a toe ring or \"bichiya\" instead of a finger ring, but the bichiya is increasingly worn in addition to a finger ring. In eastern India, primarily in West Bengal, women wear an iron bangle denominated a \"loha\". Increasingly, this bangle is plated with gold or silver to improve its appearance. In Romania, spouses celebrate their silver wedding anniversary, i. e., twenty-fifth anniversary, by exchanging silver wedding rings, which are worn on the fourth finger of the left hands along with their original, and usually gold, wedding rings.\n\n\nWhile most Christian Churches (such as the Catholic, Lutheran, and Anglican) have the exchange of rings within their wedding liturgies, some Christian denominations eschew the use of wedding rings. \n\nThe wearing of plain dress has historically been practiced by many Methodist Churches, in keeping with the teaching of John Wesley, who stated that people should not be \"adorned with gold, or pearls, or costly apparel\" (this clause is contained in The General Rules of the Methodist Church). The first Methodist liturgical text, The Sunday Service of the Methodists, omitted the ring ceremony. As such, members of some Methodist Churches, such as the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection and Bible Methodist Connection of Churches, do not wear wedding rings. On the other hand, other Methodist Churches contain the exchange of wedding rings within their services for Holy Matrimony. In the wedding liturgy for the Free Methodist Church, for example, the groom and bride say the following when exchanging rings: \"This ring I give you in token and pledge of our constant faith and steadfast love\". \"A Service of Christian Marriage, Rite I\" contained in The United Methodist Book of Worship states that the exchange of rings is optional but when it is done, they are blessed and prounced as \"the outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace, signifying to us the union between Jesus Christ and His Church\". Following this, the bride and groom state the following as they exchange rings: \"\"Name\", I give you this ring as a sign of my vow, and with all that I am, and all that I have, I honor you; in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\"\n\nMennonites do not wear jewelry, including wedding rings, as part of their practice of plain dress. At the time of engagement, a Mennonite man often gifts his bride to be \"a special clock as a token of their relationship\".\n\nAmong Quaker Christians, especially Conservative Friends and Holiness Friends, the wedding ring is traditionally not worn as a part of their testimony of simplicity. Among Quaker groups that do wear wedding rings, the following wording is used by the bride and groom as they are exchanged: \"With this ring, I thee wed.\" The Friends General Conference, for example, teaches that \"Although wedding rings are not necessary in a Quaker wedding, the couple may exchange them if they wish. This is often done after they speak their vows.\"\n"}
{"id": "5166007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5166007", "title": "YFZ Ranch", "text": "YFZ Ranch\n\nThe YFZ Ranch, or Yearning for Zion Ranch, was a Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS) community of as many as 700 people, located near Eldorado in Schleicher County, Texas, United States. As of April 2014, the State of Texas took physical and legal possession of the property.\n\nThe YFZ Ranch was situated southwest of San Angelo and northeast of Eldorado. The Ranch was settled by members of the FLDS Church who left Hildale, Utah and Colorado City, Arizona under increasing scrutiny from the media, anti-polygamy activists and law enforcement officials.\n\nSpeaking in Sunday church services on August 10, 2003, Warren Jeffs declared that the blessings of the priesthood had been removed from the community of Short Creek (Colorado City and Hildale). Following the sermon, Jeffs suspended all further religious meetings but continued to allow his followers to pay their tithes and offerings to him. He then turned his focus to what he called \"lands of refuge\": secret communities that he had started to build up. Jeffs referred to Yearning for Zion Ranch, one of the lands of refuge, by the code name R17.\nThe YFZ Land LLC, through its president, David S. Allred, purchased the ranch in 2003 for $700,000 and quickly began development on the property. When he purchased the property, he declared that the buildings would be a corporate hunting retreat. Allred stuck with that story even after William Benjamin Johnson, a Hildale man, was alleged to be shooting all the white-tail deer on the ranch and, after an investigation, fined for hunting without a license. Later, ranch officials disclosed that the hunting retreat description was inaccurate; the buildings were part of the FLDS Church's residential area.\n\nThe ranch was home to approximately 500 people who relocated from Arizona and Utah communities. It housed a temple, a waste treatment facility, a house for FLDS Church president Warren Jeffs, a meeting house, and several large log and concrete homes. There were generators, gardens, a grain silo, and a large stone quarry that was cut for the temple. According to preliminary tax assessments, about $3 million worth of buildings had been built. The sect was fined over $34,000 for environmental violations in connection with buildings on the ranch, mainly due to its failure to obtain the required permits for its cement-mixing operations.\n\nThe temple foundation was dedicated January 1, 2005, by Warren Jeffs.\n\nOn March 29, 2008, a local domestic violence shelter hotline took a call from a female, identifying herself as \"Sarah\", and claiming to be a 16-year-old victim of physical and sexual abuse at the church's YFZ Ranch. Investigators eventually established by tracing the calls that they were placed by a much older woman, Rozita Swinton, who had been arrested for previous hoax calls posing as abused and victimized girls. The call triggered a large-scale operation at YFZ Ranch by Texas law enforcement and child welfare officials, beginning with cordoning off of the ranch on April 3. Law enforcement officers were armed with automatic weapons, SWAT teams with snipers, helicopters, and Midland County provided an M113 armored personnel carrier as backup, but they met with no armed resistance. Authorities believed the children \"had been abused or were at immediate risk of future abuse,\" a state spokesman said. Troopers and child welfare officials searched the ranch, including the temple's safes, vaults, locked desk drawers, and beds. They found evidence leading them to believe that the beds were \"in a part of the temple where 'males over the age of 17 engage in sexual activity' with underage girls.\" A religious scholar later testified in court that he does not think sexual activity occurs in the temples of FLDS sects, and that temple service \"lasts a couple of hours, so all the temples will have a place where someone can lie down.\" Child Protective Services (CPS) officials conceded that there was no evidence that the youngest children were abused (about 130 of the children were under 5), and evidence later presented in a custody hearing suggested that teenage boys were not physically or sexually abused.\n\nCPS spokesman Darrell Azar stated, \"There was a systematic process going on to groom these young girls to become brides\", and that the children could not be protected from possible future abuse on the ranch. Interviews with the children \"revealed that several underage girls were forced into 'spiritual marriage' with much older men as soon as they reached puberty and were then made pregnant.\" After Judge Barbara Walther of the 51st District Court issued an order authorizing officials to remove all children, including boys, 17 years old and under, from the ranch, eventually a total of 462 children went into the temporary custody of the State of Texas. The children were held by the Child Protective Services at Fort Concho and the Wells Fargo Pavilion in San Angelo. Over a hundred adult women chose to leave the ranch to accompany the children. Children under the age of four were allowed to stay with their mothers until DNA testing to identify family relations was finished; once DNA testing was completed, only children under 18 months were allowed to stay with their mothers indefinitely.\n\nA former member of the FLDS Church, Carolyn Jessop, arrived on-site April 6 in hopes of reuniting two of her daughters with their half siblings. She stated that the actions in Texas were unlike the 1953 Short Creek raid in Arizona. Jessop had been in Texas the prior month at a speaking engagement, where she said, \"[i]n Eldorado, the crimes went to a whole new level. They thought they could get away with more\" but \"Texas is not going to be a state that's as tolerant of these crimes as Arizona and Utah have been.\" By April 8, authorities had removed as many as 533 women and children from the ranch. On April 10, law enforcement completed their search of the ranch, returning control of the property to the FLDS Church.\n\nRepresented by Texas RioGrande Legal Aid, mothers of the removed children sought to mandamus Judge Walther for her rulings because parents in Texas cannot simply appeal an emergency removal. A mandamus is available only when it is abundantly clear a state official abused his or her power.\nOn May 22, 2008, an appeals court issued a mandamus to Judge Walther and found that there was not nearly enough evidence at the original hearing that the children were in immediate danger to justify keeping them in state custody. The court added that Judge Walther had abused her discretion by keeping the children in state care. The court ruled, \"The department did not present any evidence of danger to the physical health and safety of any male children or any female children who had not reached puberty.\" The children were to be returned to their families in 10 days. CPS announced they would seek to overturn the decision. On May 29, the Texas Supreme Court declined to issue a mandamus to the Appeals Court, with a result that CPS must return all of the children. The court stated, \"On the record before us, removal of the children was not warranted.\" The court also noted that although the children must be returned, \"it need not do so without granting other appropriate relief to protect the children.\"\n\nOn May 12–15, 2009, a hearing was held in Tom Green County, Texas regarding the constitutionality and legality of search warrants executed in April 2008 on the YFZ Ranch in Schleicher County, Texas. On October 2, 2009, Judge Barbara Walther issued a ruling denying a defense motion to suppress the evidence seized from the YFZ Ranch, stating:\n\nThe court finds that Defendants' offer of proof of deliberate falsehoods contained within the probable cause affidavits to support the two warrants is unsupported by credible evidence.\nOn November 10, 2009, Raymond Jessop was sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $8,000 for sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl on or about November 19, 2004.\nOn December 18, 2009, Allan Keate was sentenced to 33 years in prison. He fathered a child with a 15-year-old girl.\n\nOn January 22, 2010, Michael George Emack pleaded no contest to sexual assault charges and was sentenced to seven years in prison. He married a 16-year-old girl at YFZ Ranch on August 5, 2004. She gave birth to a son less than a year later. On April 14, 2010, Emack also pleaded no contest on a bigamy charge and received a seven-year sentence that will run concurrently with the sentence he received for sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl.\n\nOn February 5, 2010, Arizona Judge Steven F. Conn approved a stipulation from the previous day between Mohave County prosecutor Matt Smith and Warren Jeffs' defense attorney, Michael Piccarreta, that evidence seized from the YFZ Ranch in Texas would not be used in any manner in Warren Jeffs' two criminal trials in Arizona. Based on the agreement of the attorneys, Judge Conn issued an order adopting the stipulation. A Utah court found Jeffs guilty of two counts of rape as an accomplice in September 2007. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years to life but while serving this sentence at the Utah State Prison, Jeffs' conviction was reversed by Utah's Supreme Court on July 27, 2010 because of a flaw in the jury instructions. Jeffs was extradited to Texas, to face trial on charges facing him there. The Texas jury found him guilty of sexual assault and aggravated sexual assault of children. He was sentenced to life in prison plus twenty years, to be served consecutively, and a $10,000 fine, for sexual assault of both 12 and 15-year-old girls.\n\nOn March 19, 2010, Merril Leroy Jessop was sentenced to 75 years in prison for one count of sexual assault of a child. Jessop was convicted of illegally marrying and then fathering a child with a 15-year-old female.\n\nOn April 15, 2010, Lehi Barlow Jeffs pleaded no contest to bigamy and sexual assault of a child, avoiding a trial that had been set for April 26. He was sentenced to eight years in prison.\n\nOn June 22, 2010, Abram Harker Jeffs was found guilty of sexual assault of a child.\n\nOn August 9, 2011, leader Warren Steed Jeffs was found guilty of one count of aggravated sexual assault of a child and one count of sexual assault of a child and sentenced to life in prison plus 20 years to be served consecutively.\n\nRozita Swinton of Colorado Springs had previously made calls pretending to be a young girl. She was under investigation for posing as the caller \"Sarah\" who complained of abuse, but she could not be found. FLDS women did not know of any such girl and assumed that it was a prank call. Sarah was considered a real person by CPS until May when her court case was dropped, effectively acknowledging that she does not actually exist. Swinton has previously been responsible for hoax calls to authorities in multiple jurisdictions, setting off large emergency responses that sometimes involved dozens of police officers. Flora Jessop recorded nearly 40 hours of Swinton's phone calls, both before and after the raid on the YFZ ranch. Swinton posed alternately as \"Sarah Barlow\" and her sister Laura. She claimed that her 50-year-old husband beat and raped her and that his other wives tried to poison her. Swinton herself was 33 at the time, unmarried, and childless.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that Texas Ranger Brooks Long called Colorado officials about two phone numbers, one of which \"was possibly related to the reporting party for the YFZ Ranch incident.\" However, the CPS acted on additional evidence gathered while investigating this complaint, and Flora Jessop and some commentators have expressed gratitude to Swinton that her tip, even if false, allowed exposure of alleged child abuses.\n\nCPS has acknowledged that some ranch residents who were removed because they appeared to be minors may be older than first assumed. On May 13, Louisa Bradshaw Jessop gave birth to a son. Louisa Jessop had been classified as 17 by CPS, although her husband had previously provided a birth certificate and driver's license to demonstrate that she was 22. A CPS lawyer explained, \"We can't just look at people and say, 'You're of age, you can go.'\" A spokesman for FLDS believed that CPS \"just wanted to keep the mother in custody until they could get the baby.\" Jessop was one of 27 \"disputed minors,\" or ranch residents about whom the CPS has inaccurate or conflicting information regarding age. Child Protective Services lawyers on May 13 told Judge Walther that Louisa and the mother of a boy born April 29 were no longer considered to be minors. On May 22, CPS declared half of the alleged teen mothers to be adults, some as old as 27. One who had been listed as an underage mother had never been pregnant.\n\nMany FLDS members and supporters see the raid and the seizure of the children from their family as religious persecution and have likened it to a witch-hunt.\n\nIn May 2008, FLDS spokesperson Willie Jessop wrote a letter to President George W. Bush, asking him to intervene, and outlining the harsh conditions that Jessop believed that the children and mothers were subjected to. In the letter Jessop claimed that, contrary to statements from authorities that the children were being placed in a safe and secure environment, the mothers and children were actually crowded by the hundreds into Fort Concho, a military facility without adequate toilets, bathing facilities, or privacy.\n\nMental health workers who worked at the shelter testified similarly to state officials, also citing lack of privacy, only military cots for sleeping and poor-quality food, with no communications and threatened arrest if mothers waved to friends. \"The CPS workers were openly rude to the mothers and children, yelled at them for trying to wave to friends ... threatened them with arrest if they did not stop waving\" Workers took notes on everything the \"guests\" said. In many of the testimonies it was compared to a prison or concentration camp. Others testified the children were \"amazingly clean, happy, healthy, energetic, well behaved and self-confident,\" while the mothers were \"consistently calm, patient and loving with their children.\"\n\nThe Christian legal group Liberty Legal Institute believes the state of Texas should be required to prove that the children taken from the ranch were actually abused or were in imminent danger, warning of possible damage to religious liberties and the rights of all Texas parents. Home-schooling families were also fearful opponents could file similarly false complaints against families to force attendance in government-run schools.\n\nUtah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff disagreed with the removal:\n\n\"Let's say you're a 6-month-old girl, no evidence whatsoever of any abuse. They're simply saying, 'You, in this culture, may grow up to be a child bride when you're 14. Therefore we're going to remove you now when you're 6 months old,'\" he said. \"Or, 'You're a 6-month-old boy; 25, 30 years, 40 years from now you're going to be a predator, so we're going to take you away now.\"\nTexas requires public education for children not in private or home schooling. Although the children have not been schooled while in state custody, a Texas Education Agency spokesman has stated that \"there's a point at which their educational input is secondary\" to their emotional well-being. CPS anticipates that the children will continue their education on the campus of their foster placement. There were no plans for the children to attend classes on any public school campus.\n\nThe ACLU maintains that the raid was prompted by a single, unsubstantiated allegation of abuse, and they allege that all children at the ranch were believed at risk solely because of exposure to FLDS beliefs regarding underage marriage. But, the ACLU contends, \"exposure to a religion's beliefs, however unorthodox, is not itself abuse and may not constitutionally be labeled abuse.\" The ACLU pointed out that parents were separated from their children without individual hearings and without particularized evidence of abuse, and that DNA testing was ordered without evidence that parentage was in dispute. Such actions, the ACLU asserts, \"should not be indiscriminately targeted against a group as a whole – particularly when the group is perceived as being different or unusual.\"\n\nAt the beginning of May, \"National Review\" columnist John Derbyshire called the raid the \"atrocity of the [previous] month\", but said he had seen only one editorial critical of the removals. The \"Los Angeles Times\" editorially endorsed the appeals court decision, saying CPS \"was overzealous in its efforts\".\n\nSeveral commentators compared the raid with the Short Creek raid of 1953, which was also a government raid on an FLDS community, and which led to a popular backlash against the raid.\n\nOn April 14, 2008, the women and children were moved out of Fort Concho to San Angelo Coliseum, where the CPS reported that the children were playing and smiling. Mothers had complained about the living conditions inside Fort Concho, sending a letter to the Texas Governor asking him to investigate the conditions. In the letter, obtained by the Associated Press, the mothers claim that their children became sick and required hospitalization. They wrote \"Our innocent children are continually being questioned on things they know nothing about. The physical examinations were horrifying to the children. The exposure to these conditions is traumatizing.\" FLDS and mental health workers complained about subjecting children to interrogation sessions, invasive physical examinations, pregnancy tests and complete body x-rays. Women staying at Fort Concho shelter told the press that the temporary housing was \"cramped, with cots, cribs, and playpens lined up side by side, and that the children were frightened.\"\n\nThe FLDS described the separation of mothers from their children as \"inhumane\". When the children under 5 realized their mothers would be taken away, the children started crying and screaming, requiring CPS workers to pry many from their mothers.\n\nThe children were placed in 16 group shelters and foster homes. Minors with children were sent to the Seton Home in San Antonio, older boys to Cal Farley's Boys Ranch in Amarillo. Some parents stated on the Today Show that they were unable to visit their boys due to a shortage of CPS staff. Newspapers released names of facilities caring for the FLDS children that have requested donations of specific items, help or cash.\n\nOn April 16, 2008, several of the mothers appeared on \"Larry King Live\" to ask for their children and tell their story from their own viewpoint. The program included a guided tour of the ranch by one of the mothers, showing where the children and families sleep and eat and stressing the loss felt with the children all now gone. The mothers declined to discuss the pending allegations of child abuse. On the 17th, a custody hearing began in the Tom Green County Courthouse to determine whether the children would remain in state custody. Judge Barbara Walther heard testimony from State officials, experts called in by the State and witnesses for ranch members over a period of 2 days while hundreds of lawyers representing the children looked on and offered objections. State officials alleged a pattern of abuse by adults, including marriages between young girls and older men, while ranch residents insisted that no abuse had taken place.\n\nOn April 18, 2008, after 21 hours of testimony, Judge Walther ordered that all 416 children seized be held in protective custody and that the DNA of the children and adults be tested to establish family relationships. Children younger than 4 were to be separated from their mothers over 18 after DNA samples were taken; older children had already been separated. Children were to be given individual hearings to determine whether they must be moved to permanent foster care or returned to their parents. DNA testing of children and adults began on the 21st.\n\nOn April 24, 2008, authorities stated that they believed 25 mothers from the YFZ Ranch were under 18. On the 28th, authorities announced that of the 53 girls aged 14–17, 31 have children or were pregnant.\n\nAfter the women regained custody of the children, one half of the families left the Yearning for Zion ranch and moved to another FLDS location.\n\nCarey Cockerell, representing Texas CPS investigators, said on April 30 that they have identified 41 children with past diagnoses of fractured bones. FLDS spokesman Rod Parker attributes the fractures to hereditary bone disease and believes that the fracture rate was low, considering the children's physically active lifestyle. Additionally, two children broke bones while they were removed from the ranch, and one girl broke a bone while in custody. CPS investigators also made new allegations of possible sexual abuse of boys, citing their diary notes.\n\nOn May 13, 2008, a San Antonio judge allowed a couple from the ranch to have daily visits with their children, and granted them a hearing in 10 days to decide their children's custody. Other challenges to the blanket order by Judge Walther were filed in courts in San Antonio, Austin, and San Angelo.\n\nIn November 2008, 12 FLDS men were charged with offenses related to underage marriages.\n\nOn December 22, 2008, The Texas Department of Family and Protective Services issued a 21-page final report on the raid entitled \"El Dorado Investigation\" The report found that \"12 girls were 'spiritually' married at ages ranging from 12 to 15, and seven of these girls have had one or more children. The 12 confirmed victims of sexual abuse were among 43 girls removed from the ranch from the ages of 12 to 17, which means that more than one out of every four pubescent girls on the ranch was in an underage marriage.\"\n\nA year after the raid, two thirds of the families were back at the ranch and sect leaders had promised to end underaged marriages. Twelve men, not all apparently from the ranch, had been indicted on a variety of sex charges, including assault and bigamy. One child, a 14-year-old girl who was married to jailed leader Warren Jeffs when she was 12, remained in foster care. The following summer, 2009, she was sent to live with a relative and ordered not to have contact with Jeffs.\n\nIn November 2012, the Texas Attorney General's Office began legal proceeding in an attempt to seize the ranch. In a 91-page affidavit filed with the 51st District Court of Texas, the Attorney General argues that Warren Jeffs authorized the purchase of the ranch property as \" ... a rural location where the systemic sexual assault of children would be tolerated without interference from law enforcement authorities\", therefore, the property was contraband and subject to seizure. Under Texas law, property that was used to commit or facilitate certain criminal conduct can be seized by law enforcement authorities. In 2012 the property was appraised to have a value of $19.96 million, according to county tax rolls.\n\nOn January 6, 2014, Judge Walther ruled that the state could seize the property, and that they could \"enter the property and take an inventory.\" The FLDS Church had 30 days to appeal. On February 6, 2014, at the close of the courthouse day, the opportunity to appeal the seizure expired; since no one had filed an appeal challenging the seizure by that time, the state of Texas became the legal owner of the YFZ Ranch. Officials did not release details about their future plans for the ranch at that time. On April 16, 2014, officials met with two representatives of the remaining eight adult residents and discussed arrangements for them to vacate the premises, and the following day (April 17) the State of Texas took physical possession of the property.\n\n\n\nCPS websites\n\nCourt Documents\n"}
