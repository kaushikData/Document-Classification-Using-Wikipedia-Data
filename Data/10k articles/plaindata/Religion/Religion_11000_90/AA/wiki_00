The aim of this teaching is to improve communication and foster unity among peoples and nations. The Bahá'í teachings state, however, that the international auxiliary language should not suppress existing natural languages, and that the concept of unity in diversity must be applied to preserve cultural distinctions.\n\nThe teachings of the Bahá'í Faith have a strong focus on the unity of humankind. The Bahá'í teachings see improved communication between peoples throughout the world as a vital part of world unity and peace. The Bahá'í teachings see the current multiplicity of languages as a major impediment to unity, since the existence of so many languages cuts the free flow of information and makes it difficult for the average individual to obtain a universal perspective on world events.\n\nThe principle of the selection and institutionalization of a Universal/International Auxiliary Language is among the Bahá'í Faith's key tenets. Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, writing in the Tablets of Ishráqát and Maqṣúd, taught that the lack of a common language is a major barrier to world unity since the lack of communication between peoples of different languages undermines efforts toward world peace due to misunderstandings of language; he urged that humanity should choose an auxiliary language that would be taught in schools in addition to one's own native language, so that people could understand one another. He stated that until an auxiliary language is adopted, complete unity between the various parts of the world would continue to be unrealized. `Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, called the promotion of the principle of the international auxiliary language \"the very first service to the world of man\" and its realization as \"the greatest achievement of the age in conferring profit and pleasure on mankind.\"\n\nBahá'u'lláh stressed, however, that the auxiliary language should not suppress existing natural languages, and that the concept of \"unity in diversity\" must be applied to languages. The Bahá'í teachings state that cultural heterogeneity is compatible with unity, and that the Bahá'í teaching of unity requires the embracing of cultural diversity since humanity is enriched by the various cultures throughout the world. The Bahá'í teachings state that having an international auxiliary language would remove the pressure from the natural aggrandizement of majority language groups and thus preserve minority languages, since each person would keep their own mother-tongue, and thus minority cultures.\n\nNeither Bahá'í literature, nor any of the various Bahá'í authorities, have specified which language should be used as global auxiliary. The Bahá'í writings state that any natural or constructed language may be selected. The predominant language of the time is not necessarily to be used as the auxiliary language by default. The Bahá'í writings stipulate that the auxiliary language is to be selected or invented by the world's parliaments and rulers, thus placing the choice of language in the hands of language planners. Bahá'u'lláh states that a \"world language will either be invented or chosen from among existing languages\" and: \n\nVarious Bahá'í leaders have made various comments to certain languages and qualities. `Abdu'l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi made occasional comments favorable to the notion that potential auxiliary languages be simple and easy to learn. `Abdu'l-Bahá also praised the ideal of Esperanto, a constructed language, and there was an affinity between Esperantists and Bahá'ís during the late 19th century and early 20th century. While `Abdu'l-Bahá encouraged people to learn Esperanto, he never stated that it should become the auxiliary language. \n\nOn February 12, 1913, `Abdu'l-Bahá gave a talk to the Paris Esperanto Society,\n\nNow, praise be to God that Dr. Zamenhof has invented the Esperanto language. It has all the potential qualities of becoming the international means of communication. All of us must be grateful and thankful to him for this noble effort; for in this way he has served his fellowmen well. With untiring effort and self-sacrifice on the part of its devotees Esperanto will become universal. Therefore every one of us must study this language and spread it as far as possible so that day by day it may receive a broader recognition, be accepted by all nations and governments of the world, and become a part of the curriculum in all the public schools. I hope that Esperanto will be adopted as the language of all the future international conferences and congresses, so that all people need acquire only two languages—one their own tongue and the other the international language. Then perfect union will be established between all the people of the world. Consider how difficult it is today to communicate with various nations. If one studies fifty languages one may yet travel through a country and not know the language. Therefore I hope that you will make the utmost effort, so that this language of Esperanto may be widely spread.\n\nAlso both Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice, the governing body of the Bahá'ís, emphasized that there is no official Bahá'í endorsement of Esperanto as the international auxiliary language. Today there exists an active sub-community of Bahá'í Esperantists; the Bahá'í Esperanto-League was founded in 1973, and Lidia Zamenhof, daughter of Esperanto creator L. L. Zamenhof, was a Bahá'í. Ehsan Yarshater, the founding editor of \"Encyclopædia Iranica\", notes how as a child in Iran he learned Esperanto and that when his mother was visiting Haifa on a Bahá'í pilgrimage he wrote her a letter in Persian as well as Esperanto. At the request of 'Abdu’l-Baha, Agnes Baldwin Alexander became an early advocate of Esperanto and used it to spread the Bahá’í teachings at meetings and conferences in Japan. James Ferdinand Morton, Jr., an early member of the Bahá'í Faith in Greater Boston, was vice-president of the Esperanto League for North America.\n\nThe selection of the existing language or the creation of a new one each have their advantages; the selection of an existing language allows for a certain portion of the world's population to have already learnt it, but using an invented language would presumably have the advantage of being emotionally neutral.\n\nThe Bahá'í teachings on an auxiliary international language does not in itself threaten living languages or cultures; they do not call for cultural uniformity. Instead, the Bahá'í teachings value and promote cultural diversity by stating that there should be \"unity in diversity\". The term \"auxiliary\" in Bahá'í scripture means that the international language will be taught in addition to first languages and that it will be secondary to those. Since the auxiliary language is meant for community-external, inter-community communication, it is functionally separate from one's primary language. While secondary to the primary language of one's culture, it establishes reliable communication between members of differing primary speech communities.\n\nThe Bahá'í teachings see minority group members as full members of the broader society, and thus see the need for unique cultural rights. Language is strongly attached to culture. In Bahá'í literature, one's mother tongue is described as \"the most profound characteristic of a people\", \"the garment of the spirit of the people\", the \"native air which we need for living and dying, which surrounds us from cradle to grave, which is and remains our most personal property.\" Whereas both cultural and linguistic change are normal and ever-greater world unity expected, the precipitous extinction of non-dominant languages and cultures is therefore undesirable. Since the Bahá'í teachings on oneness of humankind emphasize the value of both diversity and unity in the sense of harmony rather than simple sameness, minority cultural rights can be seen as a matter of cultural justice, and language rights a subset of those cultural rights.\n\n\n"}

They hold that it is difficult or impossible to be sure of anything beyond the basic tenets of the Christian faith. They believe that God or a higher power exists, that Jesus may have a special relationship with God and is in some way divine, and that God should be worshipped. This belief system has deep roots in Judaism and the early days of the Church.\n\nIn 1965 Christian theologian Leslie Weatherhead published \"The Christian Agnostic\", in which he argues:\nAlthough radical and unpalatable to conventional theologians, Weatherhead's agnosticism falls far short of Huxley's, and short even of \"weak agnosticism\":\nIn the summary chapter of \"The Christian Agnostic\", Weatherhead stated what he believed in a sort of twelve-part creed:\n\n\nAccording to Pope Benedict XVI, strong agnosticism in particular contradicts itself in affirming the power of reason to know scientific truth. He blames the exclusion of reasoning from religion and ethics for dangerous pathologies such as crimes against humanity and ecological disasters.\n\"Agnosticism\", said Ratzinger, \"is always the fruit of a refusal of that knowledge which is in fact offered to man ... The knowledge of God has always existed\". He asserted that agnosticism is a choice of comfort, pride, dominion, and utility over truth, and is opposed by the following attitudes: the keenest self-criticism, humble listening to the whole of existence, the persistent patience and self-correction of the scientific method, a readiness to be purified by the truth.\n\nThe Catholic Church sees merit in examining what it calls \"partial agnosticism\", specifically those systems that \"do not aim at constructing a complete philosophy of the unknowable, but at excluding special kinds of truth, notably religious, from the domain of knowledge\". However, the Church is historically opposed to a full denial of the capacity of human reason to know God. The Council of the Vatican declares, \"God, the beginning and end of all, can, by the natural light of human reason, be known with certainty from the works of creation\".\n\nBlaise Pascal argued that even if there were truly no evidence for God, agnostics should consider what is now known as Pascal's Wager: the infinite expected value of acknowledging God is always greater than the finite expected value of not acknowledging his existence, and thus it is a safer \"bet\" to choose God.\n\nPeter Kreeft and Ronald Tacelli cited 20 arguments for God's existence, asserting that any demand for evidence testable in a laboratory is in effect asking God, the supreme being, to become man's servant.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2317416", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2317416", "title": "Coffee Talk", "text": "Coffee Talk\n\n\"Coffee Talk with Linda Richman\" is a series of sketches performed by Mike Myers on the sketch comedy show \"Saturday Night Live\". It ran from October 12, 1991, until October 15, 1994, although Myers (who had since left the show) reprised the role once more on March 22, 1997.\n\nIn the sketches, Myers plays a stereotypical Jewish middle-aged woman, named after his ex-mother-in-law Linda Richman, with an exaggerated New York accent who sports long, painted fake nails; lots of gold jewelry; gaudy sweaters; large dark glasses; and big hair, which she constantly adjusts. This character was a spoof on his former real-life mother-in-law, Linda Richman.\n\nIntroduced on the January 19, 1991, episode, this sketch was originally called \"Coffee Talk with Paul Baldwin\", with Baldwin played by Joe Mantegna. The main joke was the use of as many words that accentuated the stereotypical New York accent as possible, particularly the low back chain shift that changes the vowels in words like \"dogs, daughters, lofts and coffee\" as Baldwin describes the show's preferred topics.\n\nStarting with the October 12, 1991, episode, Paul Baldwin was written out and replaced with the character of Richman as the substitute host. In subsequent episodes, Richman explains that Baldwin is a good friend of hers and is recuperating in Boca Raton, Florida, because \"he developed \"shpilkis\" in his \"genechtagazoink\"\".\n\nRichman's hero was Barbra Streisand. She constantly \"dedicated\" the show to her, often claiming her to be the greatest actress in all of history.\n\nIn what could be considered to be the sketch's most memorable moment, Myers was joined on February 22, 1992, by special guests Madonna and Roseanne Barr as other stereotypical Jewish women. Madonna also lampooned herself by having her character attack Madonna as a bad example for teenage Jewish girls (\"She's a tramp. Every week with the different boyfriend! And this week in the papers with no clothes on! Who needs her? Feh!!\"), referring to the hitchhiking scene from Madonna's \"Erotica\" video. They discussed Streisand's film \"The Prince of Tides\" (1991) on the show.\n\nNear the end of the sketch, the women compared Streisand to \"buttah\"and suddenly, a voice announced, \"All this talk about food, I'm getting hungry, girls.\" It was Streisand herself in a surprise appearance; none of the actors had any idea that she was to appear. All three managed to remain in character as the audience went wild. (Myers as Richman screamed, \"I can die now! That's all the time we have for this week; I have to go and die now!\") The real Richman, sitting in the audience that night to watch her then son-in-law lampoon her, has acknowledged having been \"tickled to death\" at that particular moment, as Streisand is one of her actual heroes as well.\n\nStreisand only stayed long enough to give each character a kiss and wave to the audience. Streisand later revealed that she had been giving a performance at Radio City Music Hall (which is located across West 50th Street from NBC Studios) and happened to overhear that the sketch was being done that night. In the television special \"Saturday Night Live: 101 Most Unforgettable Moments\", this particular sketch is moment number six.\n\nRichman would occasionally take callers. The number to call was always 555-4444, each \"four\" again said with the same accent (though, in some later airings, the 555 is bleeped out and covered up on screen, as 555-4444 is no longer a fictitious telephone number). \"Give a call, we'll talk, no big whoop.\"\n\nRichman occasionally added Yiddish or pseudo-Yiddish words into her speech: \"OK now, this show used to be hosted by my friend Paul Baldwin, but he developed \"shpilkis\" in his \"genechtagazoink\". So now he's in Boca Raton, Florida, recovering nicely, thank you very much.\" The catchphrase often used to describe things Linda admired was \"like butter\", which in the accent becomes \"like buttah\". A typical example is, \"Her voice, it's like buttah.\"\n\nWhenever Richman would get upset, she would put her hand on her chest and say \"I'm all \"verklempt\"\" or \"I'm a little \"verklempt.\"\" Then she would say, \"Talk amongst yourselves,\" sometimes waving her hand in a dismissive gesture toward the audience. She would often follow this with an example by saying, \"I'll give you a topic,\" which would typically have the structure of a bahuvrihi: \"\"[two- or three-part phrase]\" is neither \"[first part]\", nor \"[second part]\" (nor [\"third part\"]). Discuss.\" Richman would then recover after a beat.\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\nRichman would also make light jokes and good-natured ribbing about people raised in interfaith families, such as: someone who came from a family with Methodist and Jewish parents is called a \"Mu Shu\", whereas people who came from families with Jewish and Roman Catholic parents were called \"cashews\". In one of the final episodes of the sketch, Richman is shown with an Irish-Catholic boyfriend, who is a retired NYPD officer (played by Charlton Heston). When the boyfriend proposes marriage to her, Richman acts stunned, which prompts tremendous cheering from the female audience members.\n\nThe Fran Drescher sitcom \"The Nanny\" (1993–1999) made a direct tongue-in-cheek reference to the Richman sketches by showing brunette Fran Fine (Drescher), her blonde mother (Renée Taylor) and gray-haired grandma Yetta (Ann Guilbert) on the couch watching their respective \"Coffee Talk\" counterparts (Myers', Madonna's, and Roseanne Barr's characters) on television, all very similar in their appearance, voice and mannerisms. While fussing over their big hair in the fashion of the \"Coffee Talk\" regulars, they complain that the sketch is \"so stereotypical\".\n\nThe Richman character was inspired by Myers' then real-life mother-in-law, a woman of New York Jewish extraction who is actually named Linda Richman. During a Larry King interview of Myers, the real Richman called in and expressed good-natured amusement about the character. During his appearance on \"Inside the Actors Studio\", he claimed that his impression for the character was \"underplayed\" and that his mother-in-law actually goaded him into performing the voice of the character when they were in public together.\n\nMyers made an appearance as Richman during Streisand's '93/'94 New Year's Eve concert at the MGM Grand Las Vegas. While Streisand discussed reporting made in \"The New York Times\", Richman was heard from the audience assuring Streisand to ignore such press (\"Don't listen to that woman, Barbra; what does she know? Please! Feh!\"). Streisand then invited Richman up on stage, and they performed a comedy skit lampooning the Coffee Talk discussion topics. (Streisand: \"Now, I'm getting \"verklempt\"! [To audience:] Talk amongst yourselves. I'll give you a topic: \"The Prince of Tides\" was about neither a prince nor tidesDiscuss.\")\n\n\n"}
{"id": "181622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=181622", "title": "Contact (novel)", "text": "Contact (novel)\n\nContact is a 1985 science fiction novel by American scientist Carl Sagan. It deals with the theme of contact between humanity and a more technologically advanced, extraterrestrial life form. It ranked No. 7 on the 1985 U.S. bestseller list. The novel originated as a screenplay by Sagan and Ann Druyan (whom he later married) in 1979; when development of the film stalled, Sagan decided to convert the stalled film into a novel. The film concept was subsequently revived and eventually released in 1997 as the film \"Contact\" starring Jodie Foster.\n\nAs a child, Eleanor \"Ellie\" Arroway displays a strong aptitude for science and mathematics. Dissatisfied with a school lesson, she goes to the library to convince herself that is irrational. In sixth grade her father and role-model Theodore (\"Ted\") dies. A man named John Staughton becomes her stepfather and does not show as much support for her interests. Ellie refuses to accept him as a family member and concludes that her mother only remarried out of weakness.\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard University, Ellie receives a doctorate from Caltech supervised by David Drumlin, a well known radio astronomer. She eventually becomes the director of \"Project Argus\", a radiotelescope array in New Mexico dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). This puts her at odds with most of the scientific community, including Drumlin, who tries to have the funding to SETI cut off. To his surprise, the project discovers a signal containing a series of prime numbers coming from the Vega system 26 light years away. Further analysis reveals information in the polarization modulation of the signal. This message is a retransmission of Adolf Hitler's opening speech at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin; the first television signal powerful enough to escape Earth's ionosphere.\n\nThe President of the United States meets with Ellie to discuss the implications of the first confirmed communication from extraterrestrial beings. Ellie begins a relationship with Presidential Science Advisor Ken der Heer. With the help of her Soviet colleague Vaygay Lunacharsky, Ellie is able to set up redundant monitoring of the signal so that a telescope remains pointed at Vega at all times. A third message is discovered describing plans for an advanced machine. With no way of decoding the 30,000 pages, SETI scientists surmise that there must be a primer that they have missed.\n\nAt the President's insistence, Ellie agrees to meet with two religious leaders, Billy Jo Rankin and Palmer Joss. A lifelong religious skeptic, Ellie tries to convince Joss of her faith in science by standing near a heavy Foucault pendulum and trusting that its amplitude will not increase. Although dismissing Rankin's outbursts, Ellie is intrigued by Joss' worldview. Shortly after, Ellie travels to Paris to discuss the machine with a newly formed consortium. The participants reach a consensus that the machine is a dodecahedron shaped vehicle with five seats. At the conference, Ellie meets Devi Sukhavati, a doctor who left India to marry the man she loved, only to lose him to illness a year later. The final piece of the message is discovered when S. R. Hadden, a billionaire in multiple high-tech industries with an obsessive personal interest in the concept of immortality, suggests that Ellie check for phase modulation. This reveals the primer, thus allowing construction of the machine to begin.\n\nThe American and Soviet governments enter a race to construct identical copies of the machine. As errors in the Soviet project are discovered, the American machine becomes the only option. Ellie applies to be one of the five passengers but her spot is given to David Drumlin instead. Despite heavy security, a group of extremists is able to get a bomb into one of the fabrication plants in Wyoming. During a visit by three astronomers, the bomb explodes, killing Drumlin and postponing completion of the machine indefinitely. Ellie's family also suffers when her mother has a stroke which causes paralysis. John Staughton accuses Ellie of ignoring her own mother for years.\n\nEllie learns that S. R. Hadden has taken up residence aboard a private space station. While on board, he reveals that his company has been covertly building a third copy of the machine in Hokkaido, Japan. The activation date is set for December 31, 1999 and Ellie, Vaygay and Devi are given three of the spots. The other two are given to Abonnema Eda, a Nigerian physicist credited with discovering the theory of everything and Xi Qiaomu, a Chinese archaeologist and expert on the Qin dynasty. The five board the machine thinking that the extraterrestrials will either give them an additional task or cancel the transmission from Vega so that the signal only lasts for another 26 years.\n\nOnce activated, the dodecahedron transports the group through a series of wormholes to a massive station near the center of the Milky Way. The station contains a surreal Earth-like beach where the five are split up. Ellie meets an extraterrestrial in a form indistinguishable from Ted Arroway, who explains his people's reasons for making contact, and tells her of their ongoing project to alter the properties of the universe by accumulating enough mass in Cygnus A to counter the effects of entropy. He also tells her that the wormhole system was built by unknown precursors, and hints at the discovery of artificial messages in transcendental numbers like π. Ellie is reunited with the other four travellers who have also met simulations of their loved ones. She captures video evidence of the encounter before the dodecahedron takes them back to Earth.\n\nUpon returning, the passengers discover that what seemed like many hours took no time at all from Earth's perspective. They also find that all of their video footage has been erased, presumably by magnetic fields in the wormholes. After seeing that Hadden is apparently dead and that the transmission has somehow been stopped without a 26 year delay, government officials accuse the travellers of an international conspiracy. They blackmail Ellie and her fellow travellers into silence until more evidence can be found. Palmer Joss becomes one of the few people willing to believe her story that she can only justify on faith.\n\nActing on the suggestion of \"Ted\", Ellie works on a program to compute the digits of π to heretofore-unprecedented lengths. Ellie's mother dies before this project delivers its first result. A final letter from her informs Ellie that John Staughton, not Ted Arroway, is Ellie's biological father. When Ellie looks at what the computer has found, she sees a circle rasterized from 0s and 1s that appear after 10 places in the base 11 representation of π. This not only provides evidence of her journey, but suggests that intelligence is behind the universe itself.\n\nIn 1981, Simon & Schuster gave Sagan a $2 million advance on the novel. At the time, \"the advance was the largest ever made for a book that had not yet been written.\" The first printing was 265,000 copies. In the first two years it sold 1,700,000 copies.

Gubernaculum, like cornucopia, is really a Latin word. The English word government is related to it. The Old English word governail and the Scots word gouernaill are both derived from it. \n\nThe ancient rudder's different parts were distinguished by the following names: ansa, the handle; clavus, the shaft; pinna, the blade. The famous ship Tessarakonteres or Forty is said to have had four rudders. In the Bible, Paul's ship, which was shipwrecked on Malta, had its rudders (plural) cut loose.\n\nVarious gods such as Tritons and Venus have been shown with a gubernaculum. It is most associated with Fortuna since, along with the cornucopia, it is an item that she is often depicted as holding. The corresponding Greek god Tyche is also regularly shown with a gubernaculum. There are abundant depictions of Fortuna holding the gubernaculum on coins, in paintings, on altars and statues or statuettes.\n\nFortuna is depicted on around 1000 different Roman coins usually holding a gubernaculum.\n\nA sandstone statuette of Fortuna, the Roman god of luck, fate, fortune was found at Castlecary and can now be found at the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nIn mythology the rudder, which the goddess can steer, represents control of the changeable fortunes of life. Plato used the metaphor of turning the Ship of State with a rudder. In the Biblical book of James, the author compares the tongue with a ship's rudder which, though physically small, makes great boasts.\n"}

His family were peasant farmers of the Namasudra community and he was born in the Gopalganj area of what was then Bengal Presidency (now a part of Bangladesh). Named Harichand Bairagi at birth, he moved to Orakandi, Faridpur District.\n\nAt a very early age, Thakur accepted the path of religious reformation for giving service to and uplifting the untouchable people of Bengal. He experienced \"atmadarshan\" (self-realisation) and preached his ideologies and religious philosophy in twelve commandments and asked his followers to pursue his works.\n\nThakur, whose family were Vaishnavite Hindus, founded a sect of Vaishnavite Hinduism called Matua. This was adopted by members of the Namasudra community, who were then also known by the pejorative name of Chandalas and considered to be untouchable. The sect was opposed to Brahmanical Hinduism and, according to Sipra Mukherjee \"[inspired] the community towards education and social upliftment\". It has subsequently attracted adherents from other caste communities that were marginalised by the upper castes, including the Chamars, Mahishyas, Malis, and Telis.\n\nThakur's followers consider him as God (hence calling him \"Thakur\") Harichand and as an avatar (incarnation) of Vishnu or Krishna. Thus, he became known as \"Sri Sri Harichand Thakur\". However, adherents of mainstream Hinduism do not accept this, despite often assimilating offshoots of their faith, because, according to the Dalit activist Debendralal Biswas Thakur, to do so in this instance would be to undermine the basis of their religion.\n\nThakur was married to Jagat Mata Shanti Mata and they had two sons. He died at Orakandi in 1878.\n\nAfter his death, one of his sons, Guruchand Thakur (b. 1846), worked with C. S. Mead in a campaign to have the Chandala people recategorised as Namasudra. According to historian Sekhar Bandyopadhyay, it was under the leadership of Guruchand that the Matua sect \"achieved its doctrinal cohesion and organisational push, as it came to be associated with the Namasudra social protest movement started in 1872\".\n\nA considerable body of Dalit literature that mixes religious and secular themes has emerged around Thakur and Matua. This includes biographies, promotions of the teachings and interpretations of the relationship to later events, such as the thoughts of B. R. Ambedkar and comparisons with the situation of black people in the US.\n\n\n"}

Insight Dialogue is taught and practiced in a number of contexts—residential retreats, daylong workshops, community practice groups, and online (e.g., via Skype).\n\nInsight Dialogue has its roots in the Buddha's early teachings on the human experience (Pāli Canon) and the practice of Insight or Vipassanā meditation; however, people of all faiths and backgrounds can practice. Gregory Kramer and Terri O'Fallon co-created Insight Dialogue. Gregory Kramer, the Founder and Guiding Teacher of Metta Programs, continued developing the practice and has been teaching it worldwide since 1995.\n\nAlthough designed to work together, the Insight Dialogue guidelines are typically taught individually, in sequence.\n\nTemporal pause; stepping out of habitual thoughts and reactions into experience in the present moment; mindfulness.\n\nInvitation to calm the body and mind; receiving whatever sensations, thoughts, and feelings are present; acceptance.\n\nExtension of mindfulness from internal to include the external; spaciousness; matures to include the relational moment; mutuality.\n\nEntering the relational moment without an agenda; awareness of the impermanence of thoughts and feelings; allowing experience to unfold; \"don't know\" mind.\n\nListening mindfully, with an awareness that is relaxed and open; ripens into unhindered receptivity to the unfolding words, emotions, and presence of another.\n\nArticulation of the truth of one's subjective experience with mindfulness; discernment of what to say amid the universe of possibilities; ripens into an acute sensitivity to the voice of the moment that \"speaks through\" the meditator.\n\n"}

The constitution also declares all kinds of religious discrimination illegal, although religious minorities and atheists are conspicuously under-represented by the government and society of the country. A number of Bangladeshi atheist bloggers have been attacked and killed by fundamentalist religious groups in recent years. In a 2009 Gallup survey, more than 99% of respondents from Bangladesh replied that religion is an important part of their daily life., while another Gallup survey from 2014 found that 5% of Bangladeshi identify as non-religious.\n\nIn February 2013, protests occurred in Shahbag demanding capital punishment for the Islamist leader and war criminal Abdul Quader Molla as well as the removal of Jamaat-e-Islami from politics. Islamist groups including Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh responded by organising protests calling for the execution of \"atheist bloggers\" accused of insulting Islam, and the introduction of a blasphemy law. Many secularist bloggers who supported the Shahbag protests came under attack following the protests. Amnesty International noted with concern the rise in communal violence against religious minorities, including attacks on Hindus.\n\nIn early April 2013, the police began arresting bloggers for hurting religious sentiments. Four bloggers, Subrata Adhikary Shuvo, Russell Parvez, Mashiur Rahman Biplob and Asif Mohiuddin (who was still recovering from his wounds), were arrested within days of one another. The blog, Amar Blog, was also taken down. A religious group called Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh called for the hanging of the bloggers. Asif Mohiuddin's blog was shut down by the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, and he was jailed for posting \"offensive comments about Islam and Mohammed.\" The secular government arrested several other bloggers and blocked about a dozen websites and blogs, as well as giving police protection to some bloggers.\n\nInternational organisations, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Reporters without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the imprisonment of bloggers and the climate of fear for journalists. Worldwide protest and demonstrations were held on in 2013 to put pressure on the Bangladeshi government to free the arrested bloggers. Several humanist groups (including the IHEU, the Center for Inquiry, the British Humanist Association, American Atheists and the Secular Coalition for America) called for their release, along with intellectuals including Salman Rushdie, Taslima Nasrin, Hemant Mehta, Maryam Namazie, PZ Myers, Avijit Roy, Abu Ahammad, Ajoy Roy, Qayyum Chowdhury, Ramendu Majumdar and Muhammad Zafar Iqbal.\n\nTaslima Nasrin, an author and self-described atheist, used to criticise rising religious fundamentalism and government inaction in her newspaper columns and books. In early 1992, mobs began attacking bookstores stocking her work. The same year she was assaulted at a book fair and her passport was confiscated. In July 1993, her novel \"Lajja\" was banned by the government on the claims that it created misunderstanding among the communities. On 23 September 1993, a fatwa was issued for her death. After international pressure, her passport returned in April 1994. She travelled to France and returned via India. On 4 July 1994, an arrest warrant was issued for hurting religious feelings and Nasrin went underground. On 3 August, she was granted bail, but she fled to Sweden and remained in exile. In 1998, she visited her critically ill mother in Bangladesh. In 2005, she moved to India and applied for citizenship.\n\nIn 2003, Bangladeshi author Humayun Azad wrote a book about an Islamic fundamentalist group Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh collaborating with the Pakistani army during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. Azad received numerous death threats from fundamentalists until his assassination the next year. In May 2015, Humayun Azad's son, blogger Ananya Azad, was repeatedly threatened with death after publishing critiques of Islamist fundamentalism. He was subsequently forced into exile in Europe.\n\nOn 15 January 2013, Asif Mohiuddin, a self-styled atheist blogger (rational, gentle and Anti-Islamist), was stabbed near his office in Dhaka. He survived the attack. On 15 February 2013, Ahmed Rajib Haider, a prominent anti-Islamist blogger, was found murdered by a machete outside his Dhaka home. Mohiuddin, a winner of the BOBs award for online activism, was on an Islamist hit list that also included the murdered sociology professor Shafiul Islam.\n\nOn the night of 7 March 2013, an atheist blogger Sunnyur Rahaman was attacked by two men who swooped on him and hacked him with machetes while shouting \"Allahu Akbar\". He came under attack around 9:00 pm near Purabi Cinema Hall in Mirpur. By the support of local police he was rushed to Dhaka Medical College and Hospital with wounds in his head, neck, right leg and left hand.\n\nOn 26 February 2015, Avijit Roy, the founder of the Mukto-Mona blog, and his wife were attacked in Dhaka with machete-wielding assailants. Roy died on his way to the hospital. His wife was also seriously injured and lost a finger.\n\nOn 30 March 2015, blogger Washiqur Rahman was killed in a similar attack in Dhaka. The police arrested two suspects near the scene and recovered meat cleavers from them. The suspects said they killed Rahman due to his anti-Islamic articles.\n\nOn 12 March 2015, another blogger Ananta Bijoy Das was attacked and murdered by masked men wielding machetes.

The medieval Grand Duchy of Lithuania of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, stretching from Baltic to Black seas, included several Muslim lands in the south inhabited by Crimean Tatars. A few Muslims migrated to ethnically Lithuanian lands, now the current Republic of Lithuania, mainly under rule of Grand Duke Vytautas (early 15th century). The Tatars, now referred to as Lithuanian Tatars, lost their language over time and now speak Lithuanian; however, they maintained Islam as their religion. Due to the long isolation from all the greater Islamic world, the practices of the Lithuanian Tatars differ somewhat from the rest of Sunni Muslims; they are not considered a separate sect, however, although some of the Lithuanian Tatars practice what could be called Folk Islam. One anonymous Lithuanian Tatar who made Hajj to Mecca acknowledged in his work the Risȃle that the Lithuanian Tatars had unorthodox customs and rituals so that they could possibly be viewed as infidel (kafir) from the perspective of orthodox Muslims.\n\nIn Lithuania, unlike many other European societies at the time, there was religious freedom. Lithuanian Tatars settled in certain places, such as around Raižiai (in Alytus district municipality).\n\nMuch of the Lithuanian Tatar culture, mosques, graveyards and such were destroyed by the Soviet Union after it annexed Lithuania. After restoration of Lithuanian independence however the government supported the promotion of Lithuanian Tatar culture among those Lithuanian tatars who lost it. Three original wooden mosques remain now (in villages of Nemėžis, Keturiasdešimt Totorių (both in Vilnius district municipality) and Raižiai (Alytus district municipality), typically having relatively large Muslim populations), as well as a new brick mosque built in Kaunas during the period of interwar independence of Lithuania (in the 1930s) to commemorate the anniversary of Vytautas, the duke who brought Tatars and Islam to Lithuania. That mosque is called Vytautas Didysis Mosque after the Grand Duke Vytautas. In the capital of Lithuania, Vilnius, however, no mosque remains, as Russians destroyed the Lukiškės Mosque which was there. The Lithuanian Tatar community is trying to rebuild the mosque, but faces various problems, including lack of funds as well as certain actions by the government of Vilnius city municipality.\n\nCurrently, only several thousand Lithuanian Tatars remain, making up an estimated 0.1% of the country's population; however, with the restoration of Lithuanian independence, they are experiencing a kind of national revival with evidence to suggest there are several hundred non-Tartar converts to Islam.\n\nDuring the time of the Soviet Union, some people from other Muslim nationalities were moved in, however many of them were atheists; as well other Muslims came as immigrants after restoration of independence, but as for now this number is very small compared to similar numbers in western Europe; therefore Lithuanian Tatars remain the core of Islam in Lithuania, supported by some Lithuanians who converted. Halal meat in the country remains difficult to obtain, with more observant Muslims slaughtering animals themselves.\n\nWebsites of Lithuanian Muslims:\n"}

His father, Semon Bache [né Bach] (1826–1891), emigrated to the United States from his native Nuremberg Bavaria, settling in New York City where he started the glassmaking firm Semon Bache & Company.\n\nIn 1881, he started work as a cashier at Leopold Cahn & Co., a stockbrokerage firm founded by his uncle. In 1886, he was made a minority partner and in 1892 took full control of the business, renaming it J. S. Bache & Co. Jules Bache built the company into one of the top brokerage houses in the United States, outranked only by Merrill Lynch. In the process, he became an immensely wealthy individual, a patron of the arts, and a philanthropist.\n\nDuring World War I, Jules Bache donated money to the American Field Service in France and his wife was the honorary treasurer of the \"War Babies' Cradle,\" a charity that provided aid for mothers and children in distress in war-torn Northern France and Belgium to provide them with food, clothing, heating fuel and medical care.\n\nJules Bache was a shareholder of a number of prominent corporations and sat on the board of directors of many of them. Among his personal holdings, Bache had sizeable interests in Canadian mining companies. His equity in these companies were held by his Bahamas based corporation that allowed him to legally avoid some of the high personal U.S. surtaxes, a fact which he would be publicly criticized for as a result of the Federal investigations during the 1930s into the causes of the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Bache however believed that high taxation was a hindrance to economic growth and published a booklet titled \"\"Release business from the slavery of taxation\".\" A major shareholder in Dome Mines Limited, Bache served as company president from 1919 until 1942 and was Chairman of the Board at the time of his passing. After the brokerage firm of Dillon, Read & Co. acquired the Dodge Brothers Automobile Company in 1923, Jules Bache acquired a substantial position in Chrysler Corporation.\n\nIn addition to his high profile in the business world, Jules Bache would also become well known for his art collecting that received much press attention in 1929 when he purchased the portrait of \"\"Giuliano de Medici\",\" then attributed to Raphael. He would acquire numerous other important works including those by or attributed to Rembrandt, Titian (including \"The Bache Madonna\"), Albrecht Dürer, Diego Velázquez, Gerard David, Giovanni Bellini, and Sandro Botticelli, amongst others. In 1937 he opened his magnificent art collection to the public, and in 1943 donated some of his works to the Detroit Institute of Arts.\n\nBache was a major donor to the Department of Decorative Arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. At the time of his death in 1944, most of his picture collection – up to that time gifted to the Jules Bache Foundation, was given to the Museum; the remaining works of art from his estate from his house at 814 Fifth Avenue were sold at auction. Presumably his portrait by Austrian artist Wilhelm Viktor Krausz (1878–1959) was retained by one of Bache's daughters.\nA supporter of American theatre and Broadway, in 1941 Jules Bache helped found the New York branch of the Escholier Club.\n\nIn 1927, his daughter, Kathryn Bache Miller, married the theatrical producer Gilbert Miller, in Paris, France.\n\nJules Bache died in 1944 in Palm Beach, Florida and was interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York. His tomb is a replica of the Trajan's Kiosk at Philae.\n\nHe told \"The Literary Digest\" his name was pronounced \"Baitch\", \"A rhyme with \"aitch\".\" (Charles Earle Funk, \"What's the Name, Please?\", Funk & Wagnalls, 1936.)\n"}

He spent much of the 1930s in India, was associated with the Radha Soami Satsang Beas movement and Surat Shabd Yoga, and wrote five books (one unpublished) as a result of his experiences.\n\nJohnson grew up in a staunch Christian family in the southern United States, became a Baptist minister at age 17, graduated Bachelor of Divinity in Bolivar, Missouri, and received an appointment as a missionary to India at age 22. Johnson claimed that experiences during his three-year stay in India, however, rendered him surprised by the deep understanding possessed by Indians he had sought to convert, and urged him towards further study.\n\nBack in the United States, he earned two master's degrees (M.A. theology) at the University of Chicago, resigned his 17-year Baptist ministership, and earned an M.D. from the State University of Iowa. He served as an assistant surgeon in the United States Navy during World War I, and later went into private practice. He also owned and flew his own airplanes.\n\nOver the years, he took to studies of various religious and philosophical teachings, including Christian Science, Freemasonry, New Thought, Rosicrucianism, Spiritualism, Blavatskyan Theosophy, and world religions. His spiritual explorations culminated when he visited an old friend (Julia McQuilkin in Oregon) who was a disciple of Bābā Sāwan Singh of Beās, Pañjāb, India. Convinced that he had found his path, Johnson requested initiation, which was arranged for by Dr. Harold Brock and performed on 21 March 1931. After a year, Johnson left once more for India on 24 March 1932. (At the two-week stopover in Hawaii, he had discussions on religion with the English Jōdo Shinshū priest Ernest \"Shinkaku\" Hunt [1876–1967] of the Hongwanji.)\n\nDr. Johnson was the first American to live permanently at Derā Bābā Jaimal Singh, in Beās, where he became busy with study, writing, some medical work, meditation, and traveling with Sāwan Singh. Johnson edited Sardār Sevā Singh's English translation of Soamiji Maharaj Shiv Dayal Singh's \"Sār Bachan\". Johnson also coined the term \"Audible Life Stream\". He wrote five books at the Dera, four of which were published: \"With a Great Master in India\" (1934, autobiographical), \"Call of the East\" (autobiography), \"The Unquenchable Flame\" (biography of his wife Elizabeth, written in first person), and his magnum opus \"The Path of the Masters\".\n\nIn Kashmir, Johnson met Paul Petzoldt (the mountaineer, Outward Bound instructor, and founder of the National Outdoor Leadership School), and invited him to the Derā where Petzoldt received initiation from Johnson's guru, served as Johnson's assistant in the ashram clinic, even helping in surgical operations. Friction occurred after Petzholdt's wife moved from America to join him and then became ill and disillusioned with life at Beās. A tussle with Petzhold led to the accidental death of Johnson. Petzoldt's version of this occurrence is told in an article by Molly Absolon, \"Paul Tells His Story\" in \"The Leader\", Fall 1995, NOLS .\n\nFor a comprehensive look at how Johnson died see the book, \"The Mystery of Dr. Johnson's Death: A Scandal in the Punjab,\" published by Mt. San Antonio College, 2017.\n\nJohnson's wife Elizabeth Rose (died 1941) was an American socialite, traveler, adventurer, herbalist, and spiritual seeker. She was a faithful worker of the Rādhāsoāmī Satsang, Dayāl Bāgh, Āgrā, India, and a disciple of Sir Ānand Sarūp, Kt, but eventually left Ānand Sarūp. Johnson married her and they lived out life in Beās. Johnson wrote her \"autobiography\" \"The Unquenchable Flame\" (Beās: Five Rivers Manufacturing Company, 1935).\n\nJohnson remains the most well-known among many Western adherents of and authors on Sant Mat / Surat Shabd Yoga (IAST: Sūrat-Śabd Yoga). Possibly, no other single author in Sant Mat has more influenced North American \"Shabdism\" (—David C. Lane's term) than Johnson.\n\nJohnson's magnum opus, now published as \"The Path of the Masters: The Science of Surat Shabd Yoga: The Yoga of the Audible Life Stream\" (but originally titled \"The Path of the Masters: The Science of Sūrat Shabda Yoga: Santon kī Shikshā\") is a comprehensive, explicit, systematically organised, meticulous, and polished work on the Path of the Soundstream and Lightstream. Published in France (1939), the USA (1957) and India (slightly revised by the Radha Soami Satsang Beas Publications Committee in 1972 and 1985 to delete provocative language, and extensively revised in 1993,) it remains popular among Western adherents of Sant Mat. However, its author's blunt style and now outmoded opinions – influenced by Northern European racist notions then in vogue but now considered politically incorrect — have turned off some modern readers. The text's sheer eloquence, however, has made the work the object of plagiarism by other writers, especially in the United States, where it used to be almost totally unknown to the general reading public. The work appears to have heavily influenced the American Eckankar (ECK) religion, and its various offshoots and spin-offs, through ECK founder Paul Twitchell's alleged plagiarism – discussed at length and in depth in Prof. David C. Lane's exposé \"The Making of a Spiritual Movement\".\n\nAmong Western adherents at least, \"The Path of the Masters\" has enjoyed long-time popularity among foreign-language works on Sant Mat. A sampling of Johnson's polished prose (1985 pagination) shows the logic that has proven compelling to Western readers, even outside of Sant Mat circles:\n\nPublished photographs of Julian and Elizabeth Rose Johnson include:\n\n\n"}

He was one of the most radical critics of modernity whose work consists almost entirely of aphorisms which he called \"escolios\" (\"glosses\").\n\nGómez Dávila was a Colombian scholar who never held any university post but spent most of his life in the circle of his friends and within the confines of his library. He belonged to the upper circles of Colombian society and was educated in Paris. Due to severe pneumonia, he spent about two years at home where he was taught by private teachers and developed a lifelong love of classical literature. He never, however, attended a university. In the 1930s he went back from Paris to Colombia, never to visit Europe again, except for a six-month stay with his wife in 1948. He built up an immense library containing more than 30,000 volumes around which his literary existence centred. In 1948 he helped found the Los Andes University in Bogotá.\n\nIn 1954, Gómez Dávila's first volume of works was published by his brother, a compilation of notes and aphorisms under the title \"Notas I\" – the second volume of which never appeared. The book remained virtually unknown because only 100 copies were printed and these were presented as gifts to his friends. In 1959, he followed this with a small book of essays under the title of \"Textos I\" (again, no second volume was published). These essays develop basic concepts of his philosophical anthropology as well as his philosophy of history, often in literary language full of metaphors. In these essays, he first voices his intention to create a \"reactionary patchwork\" because reality, he said, cannot be represented in a philosophical system.\n\nAfter the collapse of the military dictatorship in 1958 Gómez Dávila was offered the post of chief advisor to the state president which he rejected as he did with respect to later offers, in 1974, to become ambassador in London. Though he supported the later president Alberto Lleras Camargo's role in bringing down the dictatorship, he refrained from any political activity himself, a decision he had already reached early on in his practice as a writer.\n\nFrom this decision resulted his strong criticism not only of left-wing but also of right-wing and conservative political practices, even though his explicitly reactionary principles show some similarities to conservative viewpoints. His skeptical anthropology was based on a close study of Thucydides and Jacob Burckhardt as well as his affirmation of hierarchical structures of order on society, state and church. Gómez Dávila emphatically criticised the concept of the sovereignty of the people as an illegitimate divinisation of man and a rejection of the sovereignty of God. He was likewise deeply critical of the Second Vatican Council which he saw as a deeply problematical adaptation to the world. He particularly deplored the destruction of the Latin liturgy in the Roman Catholic Church in the wake of the Council. Similar to Juan Donoso Cortés, Gómez Dávila believed that all political errors ultimately resulted from theological errors. That is why his thought can be described as a form of political theology.\n\nThe modern ideologies such as liberalism, democracy, and socialism, are the main targets of Gómez Dávila's criticism, because the world influenced by these ideologies appeared to him decadent and corrupt.\n\nGómez Dávila discussed a vast range of topics, philosophical and theological questions, problems of literature, art, and aesthetics, philosophy of history and the writing of history. He employed a literary method of succinct statements with a great sensibility for matters of style and tone. The literary method he developed to perfection is the gloss, the scholion, which he used to comment on the world, particularly in the five volumes of \"Escolios a un texto implícito\" (1977; 1986; 1992) that he published from the seventies to the nineties. He created \"the reactionary\" as his unmistakable literary mask and made it into a distinctive type of thinking about the modern world as such. In his later work he attempted to define the \"reactionary\" with which he identified in an affirmative way by locating him somewhere beyond the traditional position of left and right. On the basis of a Catholic traditionalism influenced by the intellectual probity of Nietzsche and others he criticized modernity and saw his work as that of a partisan for a \"truth that will not die\".\n\nGómez Dávila made no attempts to make his writings widely known. Only by way of German (and later Italian as well as French and Polish) translation beginning in the late eighties did Gómez Dávila's ideas begin to be read among poets and philosophers such as Robert Spaemann, Martin Mosebach, Botho Strauß, Reinhart Maurer, Rolf Schilling, Heiner Müller, Franco Volpi, Asfa-Wossen Asserate and Krzysztof Urbanek.\n\n"}

Rather than being banned directly, Jehovah's Witnesses had to deal with censorship of their literature during the war and the court’s refusal to recognize them as a legitimate denomination, thus rendering unable to claim the status of conscientious objectors.\n\nDuring the late 1930s, Witnesses were tried for sedition because their literature attacked the clergy and political leaders of the country.\n\nIn 1940, one year following Canada's entry into World War II, the Jehovah's Witnesses denomination was banned under the War Measures Act. This ban continued until 1943. During this period, some of their children were expelled from school; other children were placed in foster homes; members were jailed; men who refused to enter the army were sent to work camps. In 1940, twenty-nine Witnesses were convicted and sentenced to terms averaging one year.\n\nIn his book \"State and Salvation\", William Kaplan wrote:\n\nIn July 1940 the government of Canada banned the Jehovah's Witnesses. Overnight it became illegal to be a member of this sect. The law, passed under the War Measures Act, was vigorously enforced. Beatings, mob action, police persecution, and state prosecution confronted the Jehovah's Witnesses as they ignored the ban and continued to go about their work spreading the word of God... The struggle was bitter indeed. Jehovah's Witness children who refused to sing the national anthem and salute the flag during patriotic exercises in public schools were often expelled from class, and in a few cases, removed from their parents' care and placed in foster homes and juvenile detention centres. Men of military service age who refused to fight spent the war trying to get out of alternative service camps established across Canada for conscientious objectors. Jehovah's Witness spent a good deal of time in the courts during the war years; they challenged government policies with which they disagreed, and were arrested in the hundreds and charged with being members of an illegal group.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1959, Jehovah's Witnesses faced religious and civil opposition in Quebec. Historically, the Roman Catholic Church had been the dominant institution in the life of the province of Quebec and a major influence on French Canadian culture. It nurtured the young people of Quebec, in language and faith; and at the same time it endorsed the legitimacy of British rule and of the established economic order.\n\nFor generations, the Roman Catholic Church in Quebec worked with the government, schools, and the courts to maintain the values and attitudes that supported the Church. This encouraged people to vote for politicians who favoured the status quo, the existing political, economic and social order.\n\nUnder the premiership of Maurice Duplessis, politics and the Church were intertwined as the latter continued to maintain a firm and influential hold on the people of Quebec. Throughout his political career, Duplessis courted the support of the Church.\n\nAfter World War II, the Church came under attack by the Jehovah's Witnesses who challenged its doctrines. They were determined to seek Catholic converts. In response, the Duplessis regime mounted a campaign of persecution against Jehovah's Witnesses and communists. The result was a legal struggle between the Duplessis regime and lawyers such as Frank Scott and Pierre Trudeau who argued in defence of the rights of minorities.\n\nThe clash between Jehovah's Witnesses and the Church became an issue of the competing ideas of freedom of speech and the freedom of religion. Jehovah's Witnesses went to court to establish the right to distribute their literature on the streets of Quebec. They also became political dissenters because during the Duplessis era, a challenge to the Church was tantamount to challenging the government. Any limitation of the Church's authority would mean limiting Duplessis's authority.\n\nDuplessis' efforts to rid the streets of Jehovah's Witnesses took the issue all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada. The legal issues concerned freedom of speech as much as it concerned freedom of religion. The Supreme Court held that there can be no freedom of religion without freedom of speech.\n\nIn 1953 the case of \"Saumur v. The City of Quebec\" (1953) 25 CR 299 (in which a Jehovah's Witness challenged a Quebec City bylaw prohibiting public distribution of literature without a permit) left the question of religious freedom undecided, with some judges actually arguing that: \"both Parliament and the provinces could validly limit freedom of worship providing they did so in the course of legislating on some other subject which lay within their respective powers.\"\n\nThis decision was part of a series of cases the Supreme Court dealt with concerning the rights of Jehovah's Witnesses under the Duplessis government of Quebec. Previous to this there was the case of \"R. v. Boucher\" [1951] S.C.R. 265 that upheld the right to distribute pamphlets. Subsequent to \"Saumur\" was the case of \"Roncarelli v. Duplessis\" [1959] S.C.R. 121 which punished Duplessis for revoking a Jehovah's Witness liquor license.\n\nIn several other cases, including \"Chaput v. Romain\" (1955) and \"Lamb v. Benoit\" (1959), Jehovah’s Witnesses successfully sued the police for damages. In \"Chaput v. Romain\", police had raided a home where a religious service by Jehovah’s Witnesses was being conducted, seized bibles and other religious paraphernalia, and disrupted the service despite not having a warrant and no charges being laid. In \"Lamb v. Benoit\", a Jehovah’s Witness was detained for a weekend for distributing seditious pamphlets on city streets, and was offered freedom from jail if she agreed to sign a release form absolving police from charges of wrongful detention. After she refused, she was charged with sedition but later acquitted. In each case, the accused were successful in defending their rights in civil court.\n\nIn order to obtain religious freedom the Jehovah's Witnesses popularized the idea of a Canadian Bill of Rights and established numerous libertarian precedents before Canada's highest courts (see Human rights).\n\nOn June 9, 1947, they presented a petition to Parliament for the enactment of a Bill of Rights with 625,510 signatures. John Diefenbaker became an advocate of the Canadian Bill of Rights and eventually introduced the Canadian Bill of Rights to Parliament during his tenure as Prime Minister.\n\nThe Canadian Bill of Rights was the precursor of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms which is part of the Canadian constitution.\n\n"}

{"id": "560306", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=560306", "title": "Plague doctor", "text": "Plague doctor\n\nA plague doctor was a medical physician who treated victims of the bubonic plague. In times of epidemics, such physicians were specifically hired by towns where the plague had taken hold. Since the city was paying their salary, they treated everyone: both the wealthy and the poor. However, some plague doctors were known to charge patients and their families additional fees for special treatments and/or false cures. Typically they were not professionally trained nor experienced physicians or surgeons, but rather they were often either second-rate doctors unable to otherwise run a successful medical practice or young physicians seeking to establish themselves. These doctors rarely cured their patients; rather, they served to record a count of the number of people contaminated for demographic purposes.\n\nPlague doctors by their covenant treated plague patients and were known as municipal or \"community plague doctors\", whereas \"general practitioners\" were separate doctors and both might be in the same European city or town at the same time. In France and the Netherlands, plague doctors often lacked medical training and were referred to as \"empirics\". In one case, a plague doctor had been a fruit salesman before his employment as a physician.\n\nIn the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, some doctors wore a beak-like mask which was filled with aromatic items. The masks were designed to protect them from putrid air, which (according to the miasmatic theory of disease) was seen as the cause of infection. The design of these costumes has been attributed to Charles de Lorme, the chief physician to Louis XIII.\n\nThe first European epidemic of the bubonic plague dates back to the mid 6th century and is called the Plague of Justinian. The largest number of people affected by the epidemic were the people who had the Black Death in Europe in the 14th century. In medieval times, the large loss of people (due to the bubonic plague) in a town created an economic disaster. Community plague doctors were quite valuable and were given special privileges; for example, plague doctors were freely allowed to perform autopsies, which were otherwise generally forbidden in Medieval Europe, to research a cure for the plague.\n\nIn some cases, plague doctors were so valuable that when Barcelona dispatched two to Tortosa in 1650, outlaws captured them \"en route\" and demanded a ransom. The city of Barcelona paid for their release. The city of Orvieto hired Matteo fu Angelo in 1348 for four times the normal rate of a doctor of 50-florin per year. Pope Clement VI hired several extra plague doctors during the Black Death plague. They were to attend to the sick people of Avignon. Of 18 doctors in Venice, only one was left by 1348: five had died of the plague, and 12 were missing and may have fled.\n\nSome plague doctors wore a special costume. The garments were invented by Charles de L'Orme in 1620 and were first used in Naples, but later spread to be used throughout Europe. The protective suit consisted of a light, waxed fabric overcoat, a mask with glass eye openings and a beak shaped nose, typically stuffed with herbs, straw, and spices. Plague doctors would also commonly carry a cane to examine and direct patients without the need to make direct contact with the patient.\n\nThe scented materials included juniper berry, ambergris, roses (Rosa), mint (\"Mentha spicata\" L.) leaves, camphor, cloves, laudanum, myrrh, rose petals, and storax. Due to the primitive understanding of disease at the time, it was believed this suit would sufficiently protect the doctor from miasma while tending to patients.\n\nPlague doctors served as public servants during times of epidemics starting with the Black Death of Europe in the fourteenth century. Their principal task, besides taking care of people with the plague, was to record in public records the deaths due to the plague.\n\nIn certain European cities like Florence and Perugia, plague doctors were requested to do autopsies to help determine the cause of death and how the plague played a role. Plague doctors became witnesses to numerous wills during times of plague epidemics. Plague doctors also gave advice to their patients about their conduct before death. This advice varied depending on the patient, and after the Middle Ages, the nature of the relationship between doctor and patient was governed by an increasingly complex ethical code.\n\nPlague doctors practiced bloodletting and other remedies such as putting frogs or leeches on the buboes to \"rebalance the humors\" as a normal routine. Plague doctors could not generally interact with the general public because of the nature of their business and the possibility of spreading the disease; they could also be subject to quarantine.\n\nA famous plague doctor who gave medical advice about preventive measures which could be used against the plague was Nostradamus. Nostradamus' advice was the removal of infected corpses, getting fresh air, drinking clean water, and drinking a juice preparation of rose hips. In \"Traité des fardemens\" it shows in Part A Chapter VIII that Nostradamus also recommended \"not\" to bleed the patient.\n\nThe Italian city of Pavia, in 1479, contracted Giovanni de Ventura as a community plague doctor. The Irish physician, Niall Ó Glacáin (c.1563?–1653) earned deep respect in Spain, France and Italy for his bravery in treating numerous people with the plague. The French anatomist Ambroise Paré and Swiss iatrochemist Paracelsus were also famous Renaissance plague doctors.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11945328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11945328", "title": "Practical Kabbalah", "text": "Practical Kabbalah\n\nPractical Kabbalah ( \"Kabbalah Ma'asit\") in historical Judaism, is a branch of the Jewish mystical tradition that concerns the use of magic. It was considered permitted white magic by its practitioners, reserved for the elite, who could separate its spiritual source from Qliphoth realms of evil if performed under circumstances that were holy (Q-D-Š) and pure (טומאה וטהרה, \"tvmh vthrh\"). The concern of overstepping Judaism's strong prohibitions of impure magic ensured it remained a minor tradition in Jewish history. Its teachings include the use of Divine and angelic names for amulets and incantations.\n\nPractical Kabbalah is mentioned in historical texts, but most Kabbalists have taught that its use is forbidden. It is contrasted with the mainstream tradition in Kabbalah of \"Kabbalah Iyunit\" (contemplative Kabbalah), that seeks to explain the nature of God and the nature of existence through theological study and Jewish meditative techniques.\n\nAccording to Gershom Scholem, many of the teachings of practical Kabbalah predate and are independent of the theoretical Kabbalah which is usually associated with the term:\n\"Halakha\" (Jewish religious law) forbids divination and other forms of soothsaying, and the Talmud lists many persistent yet condemned divining practices. The very frequency with which divination is mentioned is taken as an indication that it was widely practiced in the folk religion of ancient Israel, and a limited number of forms of divination were generally accepted within all of Israelite society, the most common being oneiromancy. Other magical practices of Judaic folk religion which became part of practical Kabbalah date from Talmudic times and include the making of amulets and other folk remedies using the esoteric names of angels.\n\nIn Talmudic and Gaonic times, rabbinic mysticism focused around exegesis of Ezekiel's vision of the divine Chariot-Throne, and meditative introspective ascent into the heavenly chambers. This elite practical mysticism, as described in the esoteric Hekhalot literature, incorporated and merged into magical incantation elements. The Talmud and Midrash refer to this as \"using the Divine Name\" for theurgic-practical ascent, as in the story of the Ten Martyrs who enquired in Heaven of the decree. In the Hekhalot literature, angels guarding each level are meditatively bound by formulae and seals to allow entry.\n\nIn the 13th century, one problem which intrigued the Ashkenazi Hasidim (literally \"the Pious of Germany\") was the possibility of the creation of life through magical means. They used the word \"golem\" (literally, shapeless or lifeless matter) to refer to an hypothetical homunculus given life by means of the magical invocation of Divine names. This interest inspired an entire cycle of legend revolving around the \"golem\" which continued into the 18th century. The identification of the ancient Sefer Yetzirah, concerning the creative force of the Hebrew letters, as the means to create a golem was derived from interpretation of two statements in the Babylonian Talmud Tractate Sanhedrin. One relates that the Sage Rava created a person; in the second, two other Sages were studying \"the laws of \"creation\" and created a \"triple calf\" that they ate for a celebration.\n\nThe separation of the mystical and magical elements of Kabbalah, dividing it into speculative theological Kabbalah (\"Kabbalah Iyyunit\") with its meditative traditions, and theurgic practical Kabbalah (\"Kabbalah Ma'asit\"), had occurred by the beginning of the 14th century. Many traditional speculative Kabbalists disapproved of practical Kabbalah, including Abraham Abulafia, who strongly condemned it. While the great majority of historical Kabbalistic involvement, writing and development concerns the theological Kabbalah, the majority of practical Kabbalaistic writings were never published.\n\nOne important tradition of practical Kabbalah thrived in Spain during the second half of the 15th century, before the Alhambra Decree. The main text of the tradition was called \"Sepher ha-Mashiv\". The practitioners of this tradition were described by Moshe Idel as \"interested in demonology and the use of coercive incantations to summon demons, angels, and even God\" in order to hasten the Messianic Age. Joseph Della Reina's (1418–1472) failure with his students in this, was considered a warning by later Kabbalists of the potential perils of involvement with Kabbalistic practice.\n\nIn the 16th century Isaac Luria, who opposed \"Kabbalah Ma'asit\" and forbade his students from writing amulets and using other techniques of practical Kabbalah, evolved a form of exorcism which effectively transferred techniques from practical to speculative Kabbalah. While this led to the displacement of magical formulas and rites by contemplative exercises, the old forms of practical Kabbalah continued to exert broad appeal. Luria's position as the central teacher of modern Kabbalah, the foundation for later Hasidism, gives his proscription authoritative force. He taught that in our generations, without the Temple in Jerusalem and its ashes of the Red Heifer to purify, the pursuit of the realm of practical Kabbalah by a person with an impure body is very detrimental.\n\nThe traditional role of the Baal Shem healer involved accepted methods between borderline practical Kabbalah and meditative Kabbalah, such as amulets and psychic abilities. Among recorded figures from early-modern times were Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm (1550–1583) and the Baal Shem of London (1708–1782). Yisrael Baal Shem Tov began his activity as a traditional Baal Shem, before founding Hasidism. While the association of the Maharal of Prague (1520–1609) with the creation of a golem only emerged in later times, contemporary tradition records Elijah Baal Shem as creating a golem. The Sabbatean mystical heresies of Sabbatai Zevi (1626–1676) and Jacob Frank (1726–1791) led to the 1750s accusation of Jonathan Eybeschutz by Jacob Emden of being a secret Sabbatean. It was chiefly based on the interpretation of some amulets prepared by Eybeschutz, in which Emden saw Sabbatean allusions. The leader of Mitnagdic Lithuanian Judaism, the Kabbalist Vilna Gaon (1720–1797), related that in his youth he had attempted to make a golem, but stopped when he perceived a spirit of impurity involved.\n\nRabbi Aharon Yehuda of Chelm, a practitioner of practical Kabbalh, and baal shem, was said to have created a golem through use of the divine name.\n\nRabbi Yhitzak Ayhiz Halpern, a practitioner of practical Kabbalh, and baal shem, was said to have saved a ship from capsizing, and to exorcised a dybbuk.\n\nRabbi Naftali Katz of Posnan was said to have brought a dead man back to life to free his wife from agunah.\n\nRabbi Hirsch Fraenkel was sentenced to imprisonment in Germany in 1713, on the basis of having a library of books said to contain examples of sorcery, such as how to use oaths, and amulets to overcome demons, see the future, and speak to the dead.\n\nIn Hasidism, the displacement of practical Kabbalah by conceptual and meditative trends gained much further emphasis. Hasidism internalised Kabbalah through the psychology of deveikut (cleaving to God), and cleaving to the Tzadik (Hasidic Rebbe). In Hasidic doctrine, the tzaddik channels Divine spiritual and physical bounty to his followers by altering the Will of God (uncovering a deeper Will) through his own deveikut and self-nullification. Dov Ber of Mezeritch is concerned to distinguish this theory of prayer from contemplative magical process. This rendered the external methods of practical Kabbalah unnecessary and a hindrance, though some Hasidic leaders retained use of accepted amulets.\n\nThis change was manifested in the personal life of Hasidism's founder, the Baal Shem Tov (1698–1760), in his move from Baal Shem to the prototype of Hasidic leader. While a Baal Shem, he used amulets. At the end of his life, the Ba'al Shem Tov never wrote the Names of God, only his own name in amulets, Yisrael ben Sara or Yisrael ben Eliezer. A traditional story relates that on one early occasion, the Baal Shem Tov resorted to practical Kabbalistic names of God, to cross a river and save his life. Afterward, he regretted this, even though he had used it in holiness. He knew that his repentance was accepted when later, he found himself again in a similar situation. This time he did not use practical Kabbalah to perform the miracle, but instead used faith to give him the miraculous supernatural power to cross the river. He then knew that his teshuvah was complete. Hasidic thought teaches that its internalised mysticism enables the soul to affect the world through its essential connection to God, rather than Divine manifestations of Kabbalah.\n\nDespite the prohibition against divination of the future, there is no prohibition against understanding the past nor coming to a greater understanding of present and future situations through inspiration gained by the Kabbalah (a subtle distinction and one often hard to delineate). The appeal to occult power outside the monotheist deity for divination purpose is unacceptable in Judaism, but at the same time it is held that the righteous have access to occult knowledge. Such knowledge can come through dreams and incubation (inducing clairvoyant dreams), metoscopy (reading faces, lines on the face, or auras emanating from the face), \"ibburim\" and \"maggidim\" (spirit possession), and/or various methods of scrying.\nThe Midrash and Talmud are replete with the use of names of God and incantations that are claimed to effect supernatural or theurgic results. Most post-Talmudic rabbinical literature seeks to curb the use of any or most of these formulae, termed \"Kabbalah Ma'asit\" (\"practical Kabbalah\"). There are various arguments for this; one stated by the Medieval Rabbi Yaakov ben Moshe Levi Moelin is that the person using it may lack the required grounding, and the ritual would be ineffective.\n\nYet the interest in these rituals of power continued largely unabated until recently. The Talmud mentions the use of charms for healing, and a wide range of magical cures were sanctioned by rabbis. It was ruled that any practice actually producing a cure was not to be considered superstitious and there has been the widespread practice of medicinal amulets, and folk remedies \"(segullot)\" in Jewish societies across time and geography.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the most famous among the Seven True Taoists of the North. He was the founder of the Dragon Gate sect of Taoism attracting the largest following in the streams of traditions flowing from the sects of the disciples.\n\nIn 1219 Genghis Khan invited Changchun to visit him in a letter dated 15 May 1219 by present reckoning. Changchun left his home in Shandong in February 1220 and journeyed to Beijing. Learning that Genghis had gone West, he spent winter there. In February 1221, Changchun left, traversing eastern Mongolia to the camp of Genghis' youngest brother Otchigin near Lake Buyur in the upper Kerulen - today's Kherlen-Amur basin. From there he traveled southwestward up the Kerulen, crossing the Karakorum region in north-central Mongolia, and arrived at the Altai Mountains, probably passing near the present Uliastai. After traversing the Altai he visited Bishbalig - modern Ürümqi - and moved along the north side of the Tian Shan range to Lake Sutkol, today's Sairam, Almaliq (or Yining City), and the rich valley of the Ili.\n\nFrom there, Changchun passed to Balasagun and Shu River, and across that river to Talas and the Tashkent region, and then over the Syr Darya to Samarkand, where he halted for some months. Finally, through the Iron Gates of Termit, over the Amu Darya, and by way of Balkh and northern Afghanistan, Changchun reached Genghis' camp near the Hindu Kush.\n\nChangchun, had been invited to satisfy the interest of Genghis Khan in \"the philosopher's stone\" and the secret medicine of immortality. He explained the Taoist philosophy and the many ways to prolong life and was honest in saying there was no secret medicine of immortality. The two had 12 in-depth conversations. Genghis Khan honoured him with the title Spirit Immortal. Genghis also made Changchun in charge of all religious persons in the empire. Their conversations were recorded in the book \"\".\n\nThe Yenisei area had a community of weavers of Chinese origin and Samarkand and Outer Mongolia both had artisans of Chinese origin seen by Changchun. After the Mongol conquest of Central Asia by Genghis Khan, foreigners were chosen as administrators and co-management with Chinese and Qara-Khitays (Khitans) of gardens and fields in Samarqand was put upon the Muslims as a requirement since Muslims were not allowed to manage without them.\n\nReturning home, Changchun largely followed his outward route, with certain deviations, such as a visit to Hohhot. He was back in Beijing by the end of January 1224. From the narrative of his expedition, \"Travels to the West of Qiu Chang Chun\" written by his pupil and companion Li Zhichang, we derive some of the most vivid pictures ever drawn of nature and man between the Great Wall of China and Kabul, between the Aral and Yellow Seas.\n\nOf particular interest are the sketches of the Mongols and the people of Samarkand and its vicinity, the account of the land and products of Samarkand in the Ili Valley at or near Almalig-Kulja, and the description of various great mountain ranges, peaks and defiles, such as the Chinese Altay, the Tian Shan, Bogdo Uula, and the Iron Gates of Termit. There is, moreover, a noteworthy reference to a land apparently identical with the uppermost valley of the Yenisei.\n\nAfter his return, Changchun lived in Beijing until his death on 23 July 1227. By order of Genghis Khan, some of the former imperial garden grounds were given to him for the foundation of a Taoist Monastery of the White Clouds that exists to this day.\n\nQiu Chuji appears as a character in Jin Yong's \"Legend of the Condor Heroes\", \"Return of the Condor Heroes\", and the 2013 film \"An End to Killing\". In Jin Yong's work he is very different from the real persona, described as a 'bullheaded priest' who gets into fights and contests with rivals, very contrary to what his religion preaches. His deeds shape much of the future of the 2 main male characters of the first story.\n\n\n"}

Pali texts employ the Brahmanical motif of a group of three refuges, as found in Rig Veda 9.97.47, Rig Veda 6.46.9 and Chandogya Upanishad 2.22.3-4.\n\nFaith is an important teaching element in both Theravada and Mahayana traditions. In contrast to perceived Western notions of faith, faith in Buddhism arises from accumulated experience and reasoning.\n\nIn the \"Kalama Sutra\", the Buddha explicitly argues against simply following authority or tradition, particularly those of religions contemporary to the Buddha's time. There remains value for a degree of trusting confidence and belief in Buddhism, primarily in the spiritual attainment and salvation or enlightenment. Faith in Buddhism centres on belief in the Three Jewels.\n\nLay followers often undertake five precepts in the same ceremony as they take the refuges. Monks administer the precepts to the laypeople, which creates an additional psychological effect. The five precepts are:\n\n\nIn Early Buddhist Texts, the role of the five precepts gradually developed. First of all, the precepts were combined with a declaration of faith in the triple gem (the Buddha, his teaching and the monastic community). Next, the precepts developed to become the foundation of lay practice. The precepts were seen a preliminary condition for the higher development of the mind. At a third stage in the texts, the precepts were actually mentioned together with the triple gem, as though they were part of it. Lastly, the precepts, together with the triple gem, became a required condition for the practice of Buddhism, as lay people had to undergo a formal initiation to become a member of the Buddhist religion. When Buddhism spread to different places and people, the role of the precepts began to vary. In countries in which Buddhism was adopted as the main religion without much competition from other religious disciplines, such as Thailand, the relation between the initiation of a lay person and the five precepts has been virtually non-existent, and the taking of the precepts has become a sort of ritual cleansing ceremony. In such countries, people are presumed Buddhist from birth without much of an initiation. The precepts are often committed to by new followers as part of their installment, yet this is not very pronounced. However, in some countries like China, where Buddhism was not the only religion, the precepts became an ordination ceremony to initiate lay people into the Buddhist religion.\n\nA layperson who upholds the precepts is described in the texts as a \"jewel among laymen\".\n\nIn Tibetan Buddhism there are three refuge formulations, the \"Outer\", \"Inner\", and \"Secret\" forms of the Three Jewels. The 'Outer' form is the 'Triple Gem', (Sanskrit:\"triratna\"), the 'Inner' is the Three Roots and the 'Secret' form is the 'Three Bodies' or trikaya of a Buddha. These alternative refuge formulations are employed by those undertaking Deity Yoga and other tantric practices within the Tibetan Buddhist Vajrayana tradition as a means of recognizing Buddha Nature.\nThree refuge motivation levels are: 1) suffering rebirth's fear motivates with the idea of happiness, 2) knowing rebirth won’t bring freedoms motivated by attaining nirvana, while 3) seeing other’s suffering motivates establishing them all in Buddhahood. Happiness is temporary, lifetimes are impermanent and ultimately refuge is taken until reaching unsurpassed awakening.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26484", "title": "Religious pluralism", "text": "Religious pluralism\n\nReligious pluralism is an attitude or policy regarding the diversity of religious belief systems co-existing in society. It can indicate one or more of the following:\n\n\nReligious pluralism, to paraphrase the title of a recent academic work, goes beyond mere toleration. Chris Beneke, in \"Beyond Toleration: The Religious Origins of American Pluralism\", explains the difference between religious tolerance and religious pluralism by pointing to the situation in the late 18th century United States. By the 1730s, in most colonies religious minorities had obtained what contemporaries called religious toleration: \"The policy of toleration relieved religious minorities of some physical punishments and some financial burdens, but it did not make them free from the indignities of prejudice and exclusion. Nor did it make them equal. Those 'tolerated' could still be barred from civil offices, military positions, and university posts.\" In short, religious toleration is only the absence of religious persecution, and does not necessarily preclude religious discrimination. However, in the following decades something extraordinary happened in the Thirteen Colonies, at least if one views the events from \"a late eighteenth-century perspective\". Gradually the colonial governments expanded the policy of religious toleration, but then, between the 1760s and the 1780s, they replaced it with \"something that is usually called religious liberty\". Mark Silka, in \"Defining Religious Pluralism in America: A Regional Analysis\", states that Religious pluralism \"enables a country made up of people of different faiths to exist without sectarian warfare or the persecution of religious minorities. Understood differently in different times and places, it is a cultural construct that embodies some shared conception of how a country's various religious communities relate to each other and to the larger nation whole.\"\n\nReligious pluralism can be defined as \"respecting the otherness of others\". Freedom of religion encompasses all religions acting within the law in a particular region. Exclusivist religions teach that theirs is the only way to salvation and to religious truth, and some of them would even argue that it is necessary to suppress the falsehoods taught by other religions. Some Protestant sects argue fiercely against Roman Catholicism, and fundamentalist Christians of all kinds teach that religious practices like those of paganism and witchcraft are pernicious. This was a common historical attitude prior to the Enlightenment, and has appeared as governmental policy into the present day under systems like Afghanistan's Taliban regime, which destroyed the ancient Buddhas of Bamyan.\n\nGiving one religion or denomination special rights that are denied to others can weaken religious pluralism. This situation was observed in Europe through the Lateran Treaty and Church of England. In modern era, many Islamic countries have laws that criminalize the act of leaving Islam to someone born in Muslim family, forbid entry to non-Muslims into Mosques, and forbid construction of Church, Synagogue or Temples inside their countries.\n\nRelativism, the belief that all religions are equal in their value and that none of the religions give access to absolute truth, is an extreme form of inclusivism. Likewise, syncretism, the attempt to take over creeds of practices from other religions or even to blend practices or creeds from different religions into one new faith is an extreme form of inter-religious dialogue. Syncretism must not be confused with ecumenism, the attempt to bring closer and eventually reunite different denominations of one religion that have a common origin but were separated by a schism.\n\nCultural and religious pluralism has a long history and development that reaches from antiquity to contemporary trends in post-modernity.\n\nFeuerbauch and Ernst Troeltsch concluded that Asian religious traditions, in particular Hinduism and Buddhism were earliest proponents of religious pluralism and granting of freedom to the individual to choose the faith and develop a personal religious construct within it. Jainism, another ancient Indian religion, as well as Daoism have also always been inclusively flexible and have long favored religious pluralism for those who disagree with their religious viewpoints. The Age of Enlightenment in Europe triggered a sweeping transformation about religion, segregation of state and religion, with rising acceptance of religious pluralism. These pluralist trends in Western thought, particularly since the 18th century, brought mainstream Christianity and Judaism closer to the Asian traditions of philosophical pluralism, states Chad Meister.\n\nBahá'u'lláh, founder of Bahá'í Faith, a religion that developed in Persia, though not a sect of Islam, urged the elimination of religious intolerance. He taught that God is one, and has manifested himself to humanity through several historic messengers. Bahá'u'lláh taught that Bahá'ís must associate with peoples of all religions, showing the love of God in relations with them, whether this is reciprocated or not.\n\nBahá'í's refer to the concept of Progressive revelation, which means that God's will is revealed to mankind progressively as mankind matures and is better able to comprehend the purpose of God in creating humanity. In this view, God's word is revealed through a series of messengers: Abraham, Krishna, Moses, Buddha, Jesus, Mohammed, and Bahá'u'lláh (the founder of the Bahá'í Faith) among them. In the \"Kitáb-i-Íqán\" (\"Book of Certitude\"), Bahá'u'lláh explains that messengers of God have a twofold station, one of divinity and one of an individual. According to Bahá'í writings, there will not be another messenger for many hundreds of years. There is also a respect for the religious traditions of the native peoples of the planet who may have little other than oral traditions as a record of their religious figures.\n\nThe earliest reference to Buddhist views on religious pluralism in a political sense is found in the Edicts of Emperor Ashoka:\n\nAll religions should reside everywhere, for all of them desire self-control and purity of heart. Rock Edict Nb7 (S. Dhammika)\n\nContact (between religions) is good. One should listen to and respect the doctrines professed by others. Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, desires that all should be well-learned in the good doctrines of other religions. Rock Edict Nb12 (S. Dhammika)\n\nWhen asked, \"Don’t all religions teach the same thing? Is it possible to unify them?\" the Dalai Lama said:\nPeople from different traditions should keep their own, rather than change. However, some Tibetan may prefer Islam, so he can follow it. Some Spanish prefer Buddhism; so follow it. But think about it carefully. Don’t do it for fashion. Some people start Christian, follow Islam, then Buddhism, then nothing.\n\nIn the United States I have seen people who embrace Buddhism and change their clothes! Like the New Age. They take something Hindu, something Buddhist, something, something… That is not healthy.\n\nFor individual practitioners, having one truth, one religion, is very important. Several truths, several religions, is contradictory.\n\nI am Buddhist. Therefore, Buddhism is the only truth for me, the only religion. To my Christian friend, Christianity is the only truth, the only religion. To my Muslim friend, [Islam] is the only truth, the only religion. In the meantime, I respect and admire my Christian friend and my Muslim friend. If by unifying you mean mixing, that is impossible; useless.\n\nAncient Greeks employed \"Interpretatio Graeca\" whereby the gods of other religions were equated with those of their own pantheon. The Romans easily accomplished this task by subsuming the entire set of gods from other faiths into their own religion. This was done on rare occasion by adding a new god to their own pantheon; on most occasions they identified another religion's gods with their own.\n\nSome Christians have argued that religious pluralism is an invalid or self-contradictory concept based upon passages of the Bible such as:\nMaximal forms of religious pluralism claim that all religions are equally true, or that one religion can be true for some and another for others. Some Christians hold this idea to be logically impossible from the Principle of contradiction.\n\nOther Christians have held that there can be truth value and salvific value in other faith traditions. John Macquarrie, described in the \"Handbook of Anglican Theologians\" (1998) as \"unquestionably Anglicanism's most distinguished systematic theologian in the second half of the twentieth century\", wrote that \"there should be an end to proselytizing but that equally there should be no syncretism of the kind typified by the Baha'i movement\" (p. 2). In discussing 9 founders of major faith traditions (Moses, Zoroaster, Lao-zu, Buddha, Confucius, Socrates, Krishna, Jesus, and Muhammad), which he called \"mediators between the human and the divine\", Macquarrie wrote that:\n\nI do not deny for a moment that the truth of God has reached others through other channels - indeed, I hope and pray that it has. So while I have a special attachment to one mediator, I have respect for them all. (p. 12)\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also teaches a form of religious pluralism, that there is at least some truth in almost all religions and philosophies.\n\nBefore the Great Schism, mainstream Christianity confessed \"one holy catholic and apostolic church\", in the words of the Nicene Creed. Roman Catholics, Orthodox Christians, Episcopalians and most Protestant Christian denominations still maintain this belief. Furthermore, the Catholic Church makes the claim that is the one and only true Church founded by Jesus Christ, but the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches also make this claim in respect to themselves.\n\nChurch unity for these groups, as in the past, is something very visible and tangible, and schism was just as serious an offense as heresy. Following the Great Schism, Roman Catholicism sees and recognizes the Orthodox Sacraments as valid but illicit and without canonical jurisdiction. Eastern Orthodoxy does not have the concept of \"validity\" when applied to Sacraments, but it considers the \"form\" of Roman Catholic Sacraments to be acceptable, and there is some recognition of Catholic sacraments among some, but not all, Orthodox. Both generally mutually regard each other as \"heterodox\" and \"schismatic\", while continuing to recognize each other as Christian, at least secundum quid. (See ecumenicism).\n\nSome other Protestants hold that only believers who believe in certain fundamental doctrines know the true pathway to salvation. The core of this doctrine is that Jesus Christ was a perfect man, is the Son of God and that he died and rose again for the wrongdoing of those who will accept the gift of salvation. They continue to believe in \"one\" church, believing in fundamental issues there is unity and non-fundamental issues there is liberty. Some evangelicals are doubtful if Roman Catholicism or Eastern Orthodoxy are still valid manifestations of the Church and usually reject religious (typically restorationist) movements rooted in 19th century American Christianity, such as Mormonism, Christian Science, or Jehovah's Witnesses as not distinctly Christian.\n\nHinduism is naturally pluralistic. A well-known \"Rig Vedic\" hymn says: \"Truth is One, though the sages know it variously\" (\"Ékam sat vipra bahudā vadanti\"). Similarly, in the \"Bhagavad Gītā\" (4:11), God, manifesting as an incarnation, states: \"As people approach me, so I receive them. All paths lead to me\" (\"ye yathā māṃ prapadyante tāṃs tathāiva bhajāmyaham mama vartmānuvartante manuṣyāḥ pārtha sarvaśaḥ\"). The Hindu religion has no theological difficulties in accepting degrees of truth in other religions. Hinduism emphasizes that everyone actually worships the same God, whether one knows it or not. Just as Hindus worshiping Ganesh is seen as valid by those worshiping Vishnu, so someone worshiping Jesus or Allah is accepted. Many \"foreign\" deities become assimilated into Hinduism, and some Hindus may sometimes offer prayers to Jesus along with their traditional forms of God.\n\nReligious pluralism is a controversial subject in Islam. The primary sources that guide Islam, namely Quran and hadiths, offer contradictory positions on religious pluralism. Some verses support religious pluralism, while others discourage it. The acceptability of religious pluralism within Islam remains a topic of active debate.\n\nIn several Surah, Quran asks Muslims to remain steadfast with Islam, and not yield to the vain desires of other religions and unbelievers. These verses have been interpreted to imply pluralism in religions. For example, Surah Al-Ma'idah verses 47 through 49 state:\nSurah Al-Ankabut verse 45 through 47 state:\nSurah Al-E-Imran verses 62 through 66 state:\nSurah Al-Kafiroon verse 1 through 6 state:\nSeveral verses of the Quran state that Islam rejects religious pluralism. For example, Surah Al-Tawba verse 1 through 5 seems to command the Muslim to slay the pagans (with verse 9.5 called the 'sword verse'): \nHowever, this verse has been explained.\nBernard Lewis presents some of his conclusions about Islamic culture, Shari'a law, jihad, and the modern day phenomenon of terrorism in his text, \"Islam: The Religion and the People\". He writes of jihad as a distinct \"religious obligation\", but suggests that \"it is a pity\" that people engaging in terrorist activities are not more aware of their own religion:\nIn Surah Al-Tawba, verse 29 demands Muslims to fight all those who do not believe in Islam, including Christians and Jews (People of the Book), until they pay the Jizya, a tax, with willing submission.\nSome people have concluded from verse 9:29, that Muslims are commanded to attack all non-Muslims until they pay money, but Shaykh Jalal Abualrub writes:\nIn Surah Al-Nisa, verse 89 has been misquoted to seem that it says to slay the apostates. In actuality, it only commands Muslims to fight those who practice oppression or persecution, or attack the Muslims.\nIn Surah Al-Bayyina verses 6 through 7 calls People of the Book and Polytheists who reject truth revealed by Islam, the worst of creatures, but the verse has very little to do with the subject of Religious Pluralism:\nThe Sufis were practitioners of the esoteric mystic traditions within an Islam at a certain point. Sufism is defined by the Sufi master or Pir (Sufism) or fakeer or Wali in the language of the people by dancing and singing and incorporating various philosophies, theologies, ideologies and religions together (e.g., Christianity, Judaism, Paganism, Platonism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and so forth with time). Famous Sufi masters are Rumi, Shadhili, Sheikh Farid, Bulleh Shah, Shah Hussain, Shams Tabrizi, Waris Shah, Ghazali, Mian Mir, Attar of Nishapur, Amir Khusrow, Salim Chishti. See many more famous Sufis at the List of Sufis. The Sufis were considered by many to have divine revelations with messages of peace, tolerance, equality, pluralism, love for all and hate for no one, humanitarians, philosophers, psychologists and much more. Many had the teaching if you want to change the world, change yourself and you will change the whole world. The views of the Sufi poets, philosophers and theologians have inspired multiple forms of modern-day academia as well as philosophers of other religions. See also Blind men and an elephant. But undoubtedly, the most influential Sufi scholar to have embraced the world is Jalaluddin Muhammad Rumi. He was born in 1207 AD in a northern province of Afghanistan, however, he later had to seek refuge in Turkey following the invasion of Afghanistan by Mongols. Rumi, through his poetry and teachings, propagated inter-faith harmony like none other. He served as a uniting figure for people of different faiths and his followers included Muslims, Christians and Jews. Even today, Rumi’s popularity does not cease to exist within the Sufi Muslim community and his message of peace and harmony transcends religious and geographical boundaries.\n\nRumi says:\n\nI looked for God. I went to a temple, and I didn't find him there. Then I went to a church, and I didn't find him there. And then I went to a mosque, and I didn't find him there. And then finally I looked in my heart, and there he was. \nRumi also says:\n\nHow many paths are there to God? There are as many paths to God as there are souls on the Earth.\nRumi also says:\nA true Lover doesn't follow any one religion,\nbe sure of that.\nSince in the religion of Love,\nthere is no irreverence or faith.\nWhen in Love,\nbody, mind, heart and soul don't even exist.\nBecome this,\nfall in Love,\nand you will not be separated again.\n\nAhmadis recognize many founders of world religions to be from God, who all brought teaching and guidance from God to all peoples. According to the Ahmadiyya understanding of the Quran, every nation in the history of mankind has been sent a prophet, as the Quran states: \"And there is a guide for every people\". Though the Quran mentions only 24 prophets, the founder of Islam, Muhammad states that the world has seen 124,000 prophets. Thus other than the prophets mentioned in the Quran, Ahmadis, with support from theological study also recognize Buddha, Krishna, founders of Chinese religions to be divinely appointed individuals.\n\nThe Second Khalifatul Maish of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community writes:\n\"According to this teaching there has not been a single people at any time in history or anywhere in the world who have not had a warner from God, a teacher, a prophet. According to the Quran there have been prophets at all times and in all countries. India, China, Russia, Afghanistan, parts of Africa, Europe, America—all had prophets according to the theory of divine guidance taught by the Quran. When, therefore, Muslims hear about prophets of other peoples or other countries, they do not deny them. They do not brand them as liars. Muslims believe that other peoples have had their teachers. If other peoples have had prophets, books, and laws, these constitute no difficulty for Islam.\"\n\nMirza Ghulam Ahmad, founder of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community wrote in his book \"A Message of Peace\":\n\"Our God has never discriminated between one people and another. This is illustrated by the fact that all the potentials and capabilities (Prophets) which have been granted to the Aryans (Hindus) have also been granted to the races inhabiting Arabia, Persia, Syria, China, Japan, Europe and America.\"\n\nReligious pluralism is a contested issue in modern Islamic countries. Twenty three (23) Islamic countries have laws, as of 2014, which make it a crime, punishable with death penalty or prison, for a Muslim, by birth or conversion, to leave Islam or convert to another religion. In Muslim countries such as Algeria, it is illegal to preach, persuade or attempt to convert a Muslim to another religion. Saudi Arabia and several Islamic nations have strict laws against the construction of Christian churches, Jewish synagogues, Hindu temples and Buddhist stupas anywhere inside the country, by anyone including minorities working there. Brunei in southeast Asia adopted Sharia law in 2013 that prescribes a death penalty for any Muslim who converts from Islam to another religion. Other Islamic scholars state Sharia does not allow non-Muslim minorities to enjoy religious freedoms in a Muslim-majority nation, but other scholars disagree.\n\n\"Anekāntavāda\", the principle of relative pluralism, is one of the basic principles of Jainism. In this view, the truth or the reality is perceived differently from different points of view, and no single point of view is the complete truth. Jain doctrine states that an object has infinite modes of existence and qualities and they cannot be completely perceived in all its aspects and manifestations, due to inherent limitations of the humans. Only the Kevalins—the omniscient beings—can comprehend the object in all its aspects and manifestations, and all others are capable of knowing only a part of it. Consequently, no one view can claim to represent the absolute truth--only relative truths. Jains compare all attempts to proclaim absolute truth with \" andhgajnyaya \" or the \"maxim of the blind men and elephant\", wherein all the blind men claimed to explain the true appearance of the elephant, but could only partly succeed due to their narrow perspective. For Jains, the problem with the blind men is not that they claim to explain the true appearance of the elephant; the problem is doing so to the exclusion of all other claims. Since absolute truth is many-sided, embracing any truth to the exclusion of others is to commit the error of \"ekānta\" (one-sidedness). Openness to the truths of others is one way in which Jainism embodies religious pluralism.\n\nThe Mosaic law categorically warns the Jews to refrain from polytheism. First and the second commandment, you shall not have another God except me, worship your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Throughout the Hebrew Bible the sovereignty of Yahweh as the only God is the key pillar of a chosen community of Israel.\n\nThe Sikh Gurus (religious leaders) have propagated the message of \"many paths\" leading to the one God and ultimate salvation for all souls who treading on the path of righteousness. They have supported the view that proponents of all faiths, by doing good and virtuous deeds and by remembering the Lord, can certainly achieve salvation. Sikhs are told to accept all leading faiths as possible vehicles for attaining spiritual enlightenment, provided the faithful study, ponder and practice the teachings of their prophets and leaders. Sikhism had many interactions with Sufism as well as Hinduism, influenced them and was influenced by them. See Islam and Sikhism and Hinduism and Sikhism.\n\nThe holy book of the Sikhs (the Sri Guru Granth Sahib) says:\n\nDo not say that the Vedas and the Koran (semitic books i.e. Bible, Torah and Q'uran) are false. Those who do not contemplate them are false. (Guru Granth Sahib page 1350) \nAs well as:\n\nSome call the Lord \"Ram, Ram\", and some \"Khuda\". Some serve Him as \"Gusain\", others as \"Allah\". He is the Cause of causes, and Generous. He showers His Grace and Mercy upon us. Some pilgrims bathe at sacred shrines, others go on Hajj to Mecca. Some do devotional worship, whilst others bow their heads in prayer. Some read the Vedas, and some the Koran. Some wear blue robes, and some wear white. Some call themselves Muslim, and some call themselves Hindu. Some yearn for paradise, and others long for heaven. Says Nanak, one who realizes the Hukam of God's Will, knows the secrets of his Lord Master. (Sri Guru Granth Sahib Page:885) \n\nOne who recognizes that all spiritual paths lead to the One shall be emancipated. One who speaks lies shall fall into hell and burn. In all the world, the most blessed and sanctified are those who remain absorbed in Truth. (SGGS Ang 142) \n\nThe seconds, minutes, and hours, days, weeks and months and various seasons originate from One Sun; O nanak, in just the same way, the many forms originate from the Creator. (Guru Granth Sahib page 12,13)\nThe Guru Granth Sahib also says that Bhagat Namdev and Bhagat Kabir, who were both believed to be Hindus, both attained salvation though they were born before Sikhism took root and were clearly not Sikhs. This highlights and reinforces the Guru's saying that \"peoples of other faiths\" can join with God as true and also at the same time signify that Sikhism is not the exclusive path for liberation.\n\nAdditionally the Guru Granth Sahib says:\n\nFirst, Allah (God) created the Light; then, by His Creative Power, He made all mortal beings. From the One Light, the entire universe welled up. So who is good, and who is bad? ||1|| \n\nAgain, the Guru Granth Sahib Ji provides this verse:\n\nNaam Dayv the printer, and Kabeer the weaver, obtained salvation through the Perfect Guru. Those who know God and recognize His Shabad (\"word\") lose their ego and class consciousness. (Guru Granth Sahib page 67) \nMost of the 15 Sikh Bhagats who are mentioned in their holy book were non-Sikhs and belonged to Hindu and Muslim faiths, which were the most prevalent religions of this region.\n\nThe pluralistic dialogue of Sikhism began with the founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak after becoming enlightened saying the words \"Na koi hindu na koi musalman\" - \"There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim\". He recognised that religious labels held no value and it is the deeds of human that will be judged in the hereafter what we call ourselves religiously holds no value.\n\nSikhs have been considered eager exponents of interfaith dialogue and will not only accept the right of others to practice their faith but have in the past fought and laid down their lives to protect this right for others. See the sacrifice of the ninth Sikh Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadar who on the final desperate and heart-rending pleas of a pandit of the Kashmiris, agreed to put up a fight against a tyrannic Moghul empire that was forcing them to convert to Islam, in order that they might gain the freedom to practice their religion--one other than his own.\n\nThe concept of religious pluralism is also relevant to human service professions, such as psychology and social work, as well as medicine and nursing, in which trained professionals may interact with clients from diverse faith traditions. For example, psychologist Kenneth Pargament has described four possible stances toward client religious and spiritual beliefs, which he called \"rejectionist\", \"exclusivist\", \"constructivist\", and \"pluralist\". Unlike the constructivist stance, the pluralist stance:\n...recognizes the existence of a religious or spiritual absolute reality but allows for multiple interpretations and paths toward it. In contrast to the exclusivist who maintains that there is a single path \"up the mountain of God,\" the pluralist recognizes many paths as valid. Although both the exclusivist and the pluralist may agree on the existence of religious or spiritual reality, the pluralist recognizes that this reality is expressed in different cultures and by different people in different ways. Because humans are mortal and limited, a single human religious system cannot encompass all of the religious or spiritual absolute reality... (p. 167)\nImportantly, \"the pluralistic therapist can hold personal religious beliefs while appreciating those of a client with different religious beliefs. The pluralist recognizes that religious value differences can and will exist between counselors and clients without adversely affecting therapy\" (p. 168). The stances implied by these four helping orientations on several key issues, such as \"should religious issues be discussed in counseling?\", have also been presented in tabular form (p. 362, Table 12.1).\n\nThe profession of chaplaincy, a religious profession, must also deal with issues of pluralism and the relevance of a pluralistic stance. For example, Friberg (2001) argues: \"With growing populations of immigrants and adherents of religions not previously seen in significant numbers in North America, spiritual care must take religion and diversity seriously. Utmost respect for the residents' spiritual and religious histories and orientations is imperative\" (p. 182).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "239783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=239783", "title": "Salii", "text": "Salii\n\nIn ancient Roman religion, the Salii (, ) were the \"leaping priests\" (from the verb \"saliō\" \"leap, jump\") of Mars supposed to have been introduced by King Numa Pompilius. They were twelve patrician youths, dressed as archaic warriors: an embroidered tunic, a breastplate, a short red cloak (\"paludamentum)\", a sword, and a spiked headdress called an apex. They were charged with the twelve bronze shields called \"ancilia\", which, like the Mycenaean shield, resembled a figure eight. One of the shields was said to have fallen from heaven in the reign of King Numa and eleven copies were made to protect the identity of the sacred shield on the advice of the nymph Egeria, consort of Numa, who prophesied that wherever that shield was preserved, the people would be the dominant people of the earth.\n\nEach year in March, the Salii made a procession round the city, dancing and singing the \"Carmen Saliare\". Ovid, who relates the story of Numa and the heavenly \"ancilia\" in his \"Fasti\" (3.259–392), found the hymn and the Salian rituals outdated and hard to understand. During the Principate, by decree of the Senate, Augustus' name was inserted into the song (\"Res Gestae\" 10). They ended the day by banqueting. \"Saliaris cena\" became proverbial for a sumptuous feast.\n\nKing Tullus Hostilius is said to have established another collegium of Salii in fulfillment of a vow which he made in the second war with Fidenae and Veii. These Salii were also twelve in number, chosen from the Patricians, and appeared to have been dedicated to the service of Quirinus. They were called the Salii collini, Agonales, or Agonenses.\n\nIt is unclear whether the primary aim of the ritual was to protect Rome's army, although this is the traditional view.\n\nIn addition to the myth of the \"ancile\", several other explanations are offered in Greek and Latin sources for the founding of the priesthood. An origin among the Etruscans is attributed to a founding by Morrius, king of Veii. The Salii are also given an origin in connection with Dardanus and the Samothracian Di Penates, and the Salius who came to Italy with Evander and in the \"Aeneid\" competed in the funeral games of Anchises.\n\nAncient authors quoted by Maurus Servius Honoratus and Macrobius recorded that Salii had existed at Tibur, Tusculum and Veii even before their creation in Rome.\n\nThere is no single standing description of the Salii's rituals throughout the month of March from one of the ancient authors, and facts have to be reconstructed from multiple mentions in diverse works; however there are strong indications that the procession may actually have lasted a full 24 days, from March 1st which opened the festival till March 24th which closed it, with the procession moving from one station to another each day, and some revelling being held each evening; a complete assessment can be found in Smith, Wayte, & Marindin (1890). \n\nClassical philologist Georg Wissowa maintained that the ritual of the Salii is a war dance or a sword dance, with their costumes clearly indicating their military origin.\n\nGeorges Dumézil interpreted the rituals of the Salii as marking the opening and the closing of the yearly war season. The opening would coincide with the day of the Agonium Martiale on March 19, and the closing with the day of the Armilustrium on October 19. The first date was also referred to as \"ancilia movere\", \"to move the \"ancilia\",\" and the second as \"ancilia condere\", \"to store (or hide) the \"ancilia\".\"\n\nDumezil views the two groups of Salii — one representing Mars and the other Quirinus — as a dialectic relationship showing the interdependency of the military and economic functions in Roman society.\n\nBecause the earliest Roman calendar had begun with the month of March, Hermann Usener thought the ceremonies of the \"ancilia movere\" were a ritual expulsion of the old year, represented by the mysterious figure of Mamurius Veturius, to make way for the new god Mars born on March 1. On the Ides of March, a man ritually named as Mamurius Veturius was beaten with long white sticks in the \"sacrum Mamurii\", in Usener's view as a form of scapegoating. Mamurius was the mythic blacksmith who forged eleven replicas of the original divine shield that had dropped from the sky.\n\nAccording to Usener and Ludwig Preller Mars would be a god of war and fertility while Mamurius Veturius would mean \"Old Mars\". Mars is himself a dancer, and the head of the Salian dancers, patrician young men whose parents were both living (\"patrimi\" and \"matrimi\"). Wissowa compares the Salii with the noble youth who dance the \"Lusus Troiae\". The ritual dance of the Salii would thus be a coalescence of an initiation into adulthood and war with a scapegoat ritual (see also \"pharmakos)\".\n\nOther 19th-century scholars have compared the rituals of the Salii with the Vedic myths of Indra and the Maruts.\n\n\nSextus Pompeius Festus makes a perplexing reference to \"Salian virgins\" (\"saliae virgines\"). Wearing the \"paludamentum\" and pointed \"apex\" of the Salii, these maidens were employed to assist the College of Pontiffs in carrying out sacrifices in the Regia. It has been suggested that the passage in Festus describes a transvestite initiation. An earlier explanation held that the maidens played the role of absent warriors in some form of propitiation. The meaning of their being \"hired\" is unclear.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31425818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31425818", "title": "Samiri (Islamic figure)", "text": "Samiri (Islamic figure)\n\nSamiri or the Samiri () is a phrase used by the Quran to refer to a rebellious follower of Moses who created the golden calf and attempted to lead the Hebrews into idolatry. According to the twentieth chapter of the Quran, Samiri created the calf while Moses was away for 40 days on Mount Sinai, receiving the Ten Commandments. In contrast to account given in the Hebrew Bible, the Quran does not blame Aaron for the calf’s creation and instead praises him for trying to stop the worship of it.\n\nIn Ta-Ha, the Quran’s twentieth surah, Moses is informed that Samiri has led his people astray in Moses’ absence. He returns to his people to berate them, and is informed of what Samiri has done.\n\nThe Quran’s statement that Samiri’s calf made a \"lowing\" sound has resulted in much speculation. A number of Islamic traditions say that the calf was made with dust trodden upon by the horse of the angel Gabriel, which had mystical properties. Some traditions say that the calf could also move, a property granted to it by the dust of the “horse of life”. Other traditions suggest that Samiri made the sound himself, or that it was only the wind. Still others say that the calf was formed by Allah himself, as a test for the Hebrew people.\n\nLater traditions expand upon the fate of those who worshiped the calf. Works by al-Tabari include a story in which Moses orders his people to drink from the water into which the calf had been flung; those guilty of worshiping it were revealed when they turned a golden hue. Moses ordered his people to kill them, resulting in thousands of casualties, but the carnage stopped after Moses begged Allah to stop the violence.\n\nSamiri's punishment has been interpreted as total social isolation by most scholars.\n\nScholars of Islam have linked Samiri to various individuals mentioned in the Bible. Due to the fact that \"as-Samiri\" can mean the Samaritan, some believe that his character is a reference to the worship of the golden calves built by Jeroboam of Samaria, conflating the two idol-worshiping incidents into one. However, recent research reveal that the Samaritans are the direct descendants of the Joseph tribes, Ephraim and Manasseh and that until the 17th century C.E., they possessed a high priesthood descending directly from Aaron through Eleazar and Phinehas.\n\nSamiri has also been linked to the rebel Hebrew leader Zimri on the basis of their similar names and a shared theme of rebellion against Moses’ authority. Others link him to the Mesopotamian city of Samarra and suggest that he came from a cow-worshiping people, giving his name as Musa bin Zafar. There is no consensus among Islamic scholars on which, if any, of these identifications is correct.\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith portrays Samiri as a magician who led people away from the “knowledge and justice” of Moses to ignorance. He is mentioned in the “Kitáb-i-Íqán”, the primary theological work of the Baha'i religion.\n\n"}

Papak was a vassal of Gochihr, the overlord of Pars, who was himself the vassal of the Parthian king Artabanus V (r 208–224). According to Arabic-Persian sources, Shapur's brother, Ardashir I started an uprising when he was the commander of Fort Darabgerd in eastern Pars. According to the medieval historian, al-Tabari, Ardashir then asked Papak to stand against Gochihr and start a rebellion. Papak did it and rebelled against Gochihr and killed him. However, Daryaee believes that Papak dreamed of conquering Istakhr himself and was eventually able to achieve it by the help of Shapur; that means in contrast to al-Tabari's report, it was not Ardashir's request and order that caused Papak's rebellion against Gochihr, governor of Istakhr, and it can be implied from the common coins of Papak and Shapur. Later, Papak wrote a letter to Artabanus and requested permission to appoint Shapur instead of the \"overthrown\" Gochihr in power; in response, Artabanus announced Papak and Ardashir outlaws. \n\nAlthough Artabanus had defeated the Romans, he faced the problem of the defiance of Vologases VI, who had minted coins in his own name between 221 and 222; and this shows that no powerful emperor controlled the Parthian Empire then. During the time that Artabanus was dealing with a more important challenge, and thus he could not pay much attention to the rise of a newcomer in Pars. After a while, Papak died in ca. 222 and Shapur ascended to the throne; afterward, the contest and fight started between the two brothers (Shapur and Ardashir), but Shapur died in an accidental way. According to sources, Shapur stopped at a ruin while assaulting Darabgerd and a stone suddenly separated from the ceiling and hit his head and Shapur succumbed immediately. After the incident, the brothers relinquished the Persian throne and crown to Ardashir, who became the Persian Shah thereafter. Ardashir and his followers could be considered the main suspects of Shapur's mysterious death, since they \"benefitted from the accidental death\"; but the accusation is not provable. A nephew of Ardashir, Narseh, whose name is mentioned in the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, was most likely the son of Shapur.\n\n"}

The origin of the word is an adjective meaning \"noble\", \"highborn\". The feminine singular is sharifa(h) or shareefa(h) ( '). The masculine plural is Ashraf ( \"\").\n\nSunnis in the Arab world reserve the term \"sharif/sherif or shareef\" for descendants of Hasan ibn Ali, while \"sayyid\" is used for descendants of Husayn ibn Ali, Hasan's younger brother. Both Hasan and Husayn are grandchildren of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, through the marriage of his cousin Ali and his daughter Fatima. However, since the post-Hashemite era began in 1925 after the fall of the Sharif/Shareef of Mecca, the term \"sayyid\" has been used to denote descendants from both Hasan and Husayn. Shiites use the terms \"sayyid\" and \"habib\" to denote descendants from both Hasan and Husayn; see also ashraf. Sayyids having ancestry from both Imams Hasan and Husayn use the terms \"Shareefayn\", \"Sayyidayn\", \"Sayyid AlShareef,\" or \"Sheikh Assayyid\" before their names and call themselves \"Najeeb AlTarfayn\".\n\nFrom 1201 until 1925, when the Hejaz was conquered by Ibn Saud, this family (the descendants of Hasan ibn Ali) held the office of the Sharīf of Mecca, often also carrying the title and office of King of Hejaz. Descendants now rule the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the name is taken from the Banu Hashim, the sub-tribe of Banu Quraish, to which Muhammad belonged.\n\nIn Morocco, several of the regal dynasties have been qualified as \"Sharifian\", being descendants of Muhammad. Today's Alaouite dynasty has made claims to be Sharifian.\n\nThe Royal Family of Brunei, The Bolkiah Dynasty of Sultans, are also Sharifs through their ancestor Sharif Ali bin Ajlaan bin Rumayytha bin Muhammad AbuNumayy I who was the son of the Emir of Makkah Sharif Ajlaan and had migrated and settled in Borneo.\n\nThe word has no etymological connection with the English term \"sheriff\", which comes from the Old English word \"scīrgerefa\", meaning \"shire-reeve\", the local reeve (enforcement agent) of the king in the shire (county).\n\nChorfa is the Darija term for the Arabic \"Sharif\". In Morocco, the royal houses of Idrisid, Saadi and Alaouite are called Sharifian or Cherifian.\n\nThe first known Chorfa, Idris I, was the great-grandson of Ali ibn Abi Talib and Fatima Zahra, the daughter of Muhammad and his first wife Khadijah. Idris I and his people fled from Syria to Morocco in 786 from the Abbasids after losing to them in the Battle of Fakh near Mecca in which his family was massacred. In 788, he was greeted by the Amazigh people of Volubilis, a Roman city near Meknes. He got to found the Imperial City of Fes. It is believed that Idris I was poisoned in 791 by a servant sent by Caliph Harun al-Rashid, leaving his wife Kenza pregnant. His servant Rached, a freed slave, helped Kenza raise Idris II who was born 2 months later.\n\nIdris II came to the throne at the age of eleven. His tomb is located in Moulay Idriss, a village up on a mountainside near Volubilis. Idriss II's descendants ruled the country until the second half of the 10th century, when they lost their authority to the invasions of the Zenata, an Amazigh tribe under the orders of the Fatimid Caliphate, later the Caliph of Cordoba.\n\nAccording to French historians, Abdelkader El Djezairi was a descendant of Muhammad . The full name of El Amir Abdelkader is \"Abd el-Kader ibn Muhyidin, ibn Mostafa (qui s’est installé définitivement dans la plaine d’Ighriss), ibn Muhammad, ibn Ahmed, ibn Muhammad, ibn Abdel-Kaoui, ibn Ali, ibn Ahmed, ibn Khaled, ibn Yussef, ibn Ahmed, ibn Bachar, ibn Muhammed, ibn Massoud, ibn Taous, ibn Yacoub, ibn Abdelkaoui, ibn Ahmed, ibn Muhammad, ibn Idriss II, ibn Idriss I, ibn Abdallah El Kamel, ibn Hassan El Muthana, ibn Hassan Essabt, ibn Ali\".\n\nHowever other historians disputes, arguing that El Amir Abdelkader was descended from the Amazigh tribe of Banu Ifran.\n\nThe Senussi, a political-religious brotherhood, founded in Mecca by Sayyid Muhammad ibn Ali as-Senussi in 1837, came to become the Emirs of Cyrenaica in 1917 and then in 1922, the Emirs of Tripoli. The dynasty is of the Chofra descent through their sixth Senussi sultan, Ali ibn Omar. They came to be the kings of Libya.\n\nThe last king of Libya, Idris, was overthrown by a military coup in 1969. The current claimant for the Libyan throne is Sayyid Mohammed El Senussi. It is also claimed by Sayyid Idris bin Abdullah al-Senussi.\n\nThe Asharaf are from the descendants of Muhammed .\nSharif (the word of which Asharaf is the superlative). It is an Arabic word meaning 'noble' or 'respected'. It can be attached to one of a person's names or to more than one, and an individual may use it at one time but not at another. It can be used by all Ashraf, but is not necessarily and many nowadays prefer to omit it. It is not generally a personal name, and hence will not necessarily appear on documents such as identity card or passport. (It is sometimes used as a personal name, not only among the Asharaf. The most popular person with Sharif title in hadhramout, Yemen is Alsharif Mudhir bin Abdulrahman Ba Alawi who lived in Tarim and passed away in 2010\n\nThe Asharaaf elders sub-divided the Asharaaf in the following way:\n\n■ Asharaaf Hussein:\n\n● Reer sharif Magbuul\n● Sharif Ahmed\n● Sharif Ba Alawi\n\n■ Asharaaf Hassan:\n\n● Mohammed Sharif\n● Sharif Ali\n● Sharif Ahmed\n● Ashraf Sarman\n\nAsharaaf in Somalia are either related to Muhammad through his grandsons Hassan ibn Ali or Husayn Ibn Ali.\nThe Hussein branch of the Asharaf of Somalia live in the coastal towns such as Mogadishu and are part of the 'Benadiri' minority population. A few have moved to other places in order to trade or because they have bought land.\nThe Ashraf of the Hassan branch live mainly in the interior of the country (some of them of course may have gone to live in Mogadishu), and mostly are not Benadiri. However, the Asharaf al-Ahdali in Merca, who are Benadiri, are said to be Hassan.\nThe Asharaf elders indicated that they are living in Southern Somali and in Kenya and Ethiopia however they mostly like in urban locations such as Bardera, Kismayo, Baidoa, Hudur, Merca, Brava, Luuq, Jalalaqsi, Buur Ukur, Beledweyne, and Mogadishu. The largest concentration of Ashraf are found in Mogadishu the oldest Mosques are in such as the Masjidka Ahnaafta 7 Century, Masjidka (Sheikh Ahmed Sharif, Oldest Mosque in Africa) in the heart of Mogadishu, Jama Shangani, \nAll Masaajid in the District are 13. Mogadishu. Some Ashraf settled in Ethiopia after being exiled from Somali during the Ogaden war in 1977. These Asharaf are settled in Ogaden, Dire Dawa, Oromia, Harar, however many Asharaf fled Somali during the 1991-1992 Somali Civil War. Most of them are all over the World.\n\nThe Bolkiah Dynasty of Sultans of Brunei claim their Sharifian ancestry to Sharif Ali bin Ajlaan bin Rumaytha bin Muhammad AbuNumayy I who was the son of the Emir of Makkah and had migrated and settled in Borneo by marrying the daughter of the 3rd Sultan Ahmed.\n\nMany Royal Families currently and previous of Malaysia, Indonesia, Java, Sumatra, Philippines and Singapore had Sharifian lineage for examples: the Hashemite Dynasty of Sultans of Sulu whose ancestor was Sharif ul-Hāshim of Sulu and another ex-royal family is the Alsagoff Family of Singapore.\n\n"}

In 2009, nine members of Moses' extended family, all siblings of her mother or their spouses, were charged in relation to the event. One uncle and four aunts were subsequently found guilty of drowning Moses.\n\nThe mākutu lifting and subsequent trial were notable for bringing makutu into the public consciousness in New Zealand; and the large number of independent people who stepped forward to distance mākutu lifting as they knew it from the events in this case. Unprecedented media attention was paid to mākutu, mākutu lifting and Māori religion.\n\nMākutu is a Māori language word which can be either a noun or a verb depending on context. It is translated into English by church missionaries as curse, witchcraft or sorcery. In modern orthography, mākutu is written with a macron where technically possible, but in historical sources and sometimes in modern sources (such as newspapers) with limited technical capabilities it is written without the macron.\n\nHistorically, the tohunga involved in lifting mākutu were suppressed by the Tohunga Suppression Act 1907, which was repealed in 1962.\n\nIn the period prior to the mākutu lifting, Janet Moses had suffered the loss of her grandmother and relationship problems with her partner and father of her two children; the trial would later hear expert testimony that she likely had an \"underlying psychiatric or psychological disorder.\" A concrete lion was stolen from a Greytown hotel by family members, and was to become associated by family members with Moses' behaviour; the family said she was acting \"like a lion.\" The family emblem was a lion, with at least one family member having a tattoo of a lion and the words 'Family united' over it.\n\nWhen they became concerned with her behaviour, Moses' family consulted kaumatua (elder) Timi Rahi, who prayed for her and blessed her, and advised the family to return the lion, which they did. Rahi instructed the family that it was their responsibility to carry out the healing. After Rahi left, a prolonged mākutu lifting was performed by her predominantly maternal family at the Wainuiomata flat of Moses' late grandmother. There was no evidence as to who suggested that Moses was possessed or suffering from a curse, or who suggested that a mākutu lifting was required. The ceremony was improvised, as none of those involved had any knowledge of the procedure for a mākutu lifting. During the ceremony, so much water was used that the carpet had become soaked, and so a small hole in the floor had to be made for drainage. The woman's eyes were injured as people picked at the demons they saw in them, and neighbours heard rhythmic stomping and thumping throughout the night.\n\nAt or about 8:00 AM on 12 October 2007, Janet Moses died by drowning. Her father, who had travelled from Christchurch through the night to support his daughter, was not informed until his arrival at 4:30 PM. Nine hours after the death the police were called.\n\nMuch of the trial centred on the issue of consent, that is whether Moses was a willing participant in the ritual. The trial ran for 29 days and 101 witnesses, many of them giving testimony relating to cultural and religious practices. The jury deliberated for 20 hours before convicting five of the eight maternal family members facing charges (another family member was discharged by the judge mid-trial).\n\nNone of the convicted family members were sentenced to custodial sentences, the judge instead handing down community-based sentences.\n\nAt the trial, Charlie Moses (Janet's paternal grandfather) took a stance supporting the defendants: \"We've made our peace with them. They didn't know what they were doing, even though I told them not to go down that road. They chose to do it anyway. For that mistake ... they're going to pay for the rest of their lives. I wish them well all the same.\"\n\nAs is common in New Zealand court cases, a number of those connected to the case have name suppression to prevent the identification of under-age victims.\n\nThe eventual coroners inquest strongly recommended that the family consult tohunga (experts) or experienced kaumatua (elders) before taking action on suspected mākutu. Both Pou Temara, professor of Māori language and traditions at Waikato University, and Rawiri Taonui, head of Canterbury University's School of Maori and Indigenous Studies, said that the advice was sensible and that Māori would continue mākutu lifting practices.\n\n"}

In the vernacular, it is most commonly used by Muslims to indicate an Islamic saint, otherwise referred to by the more literal \"friend of God\". In the traditional Islamic understanding of saints, the saint is portrayed as someone \"marked by [special] divine favor ... [and] holiness\", and who is specifically \"chosen by God and endowed with exceptional gifts, such as the ability to work miracles\". The doctrine of saints was articulated by Islamic scholars very early on in Muslim history, and particular verses of the Quran and certain hadith were interpreted by early Muslim thinkers as \"documentary evidence\" of the existence of saints. Graves of saints around the Muslim world became centers of pilgrimage — especially after 1200 CE — for masses of Muslims seeking their \"barakah\" (blessing).\n\nSince the first Muslim hagiographies were written during the period when the Islamic mystical trend of Sufism began its rapid expansion, many of the figures who later came to be regarded as the major saints in orthodox Sunni Islam were the early Sufi mystics, like Hasan of Basra (d. 728), Farqad Sabakhi (d. 729), Dawud Tai (d. 777–781), Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya (d. 801), Maruf Karkhi (d. 815), and Junayd of Baghdad (d. 910). From the twelfth to the fourteenth century, \"the general veneration of saints, among both people and sovereigns, reached its definitive form with the organization of Sufism ... into orders or brotherhoods\". In the common expressions of Islamic piety of this period, the saint was understood to be \"a contemplative whose state of spiritual perfection ... [found] permanent expression in the teaching bequeathed to his disciples\". In many prominent Sunni Islamic creeds of the time, such as the famous \"Creed of Tahawi\" (c. 900) and the \"Creed of Nasafi\" (c. 1000), a belief in the existence and miracles of saints was presented as \"a requirement\" for being an orthodox Muslim believer.\n\nAside from the Sufis, the preeminent saints in traditional Islamic piety are the Companions of Muhammad, their Successors, and the third generation after the Prophet, often called \"the Successors of the Successors\". Additionally, the prophets of Islam are also believed to be saints by definition, although they are rarely referred to as such, in order to prevent confusion between them and ordinary saints; as the prophets are exalted by Muslims as the greatest of all humanity, it is a general tenet of Sunni belief that a single prophet is greater than all the regular saints put together. In short, it is believed that \"every prophet is a saint, but not every saint is a prophet\".\n\nIn the modern world, the traditional Sunni and Shia idea of saints has been challenged by movements such as Salafism, Wahhabism, and Islamic modernism, all three of which have, to a greater or lesser degree, \"formed a front against the veneration and theory of saints.\" As has been noted by scholars, the development of these movements has indirectly led to a trend amongst some mainstream Muslims to resist \"acknowledging the existence of Muslim saints altogether or ... [to view] their presence and veneration as unacceptable deviations\". However, despite the presence of these opposing streams of thought, the classical doctrine of saint-veneration continues to thrive in many parts of the Islamic world today, playing a vital role in daily expressions of piety among vast segments of Muslim populations in Muslim countries like Pakistan, Egypt, Turkey, Senegal, Iraq, Iran, Algeria, Tunisia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Morocco, as well as in countries with substantive Islamic populations like India, China, Russia, and the Balkans.\n\nRegarding the rendering of the Arabic \"walī\" by the English \"saint\", prominent scholars such as Gibril Haddad have regarded this as an appropriate translation, with Haddad describing the aversion of some Muslims towards the use of \"saint\" for \"walī\" as \"a specious objection ... for [this is] – like 'Religion' (\"din\"), 'Believer' (\"mu'min\"), 'prayer' (\"salat\"), etc. – [a] generic term for holiness and holy persons while there is no confusion, for Muslims, over their specific referents in Islam, namely: the reality of \"iman\" with Godwariness and those who possess those qualities.\" In Persian, which became the second most influential and widely-spoken language in the Islamic world after Arabic, the general title for a saint or a spiritual master became \"pīr\" (, literally \"old [person]\", \"elder\"). Although the ramifications of this phrase include the connotations of a general \"saint,\" it is often used to specifically signify a spiritual guide of some type.\n\nAmongst Indian Muslims, the title \"peer baba\" (पीर बाबा) is commonly used in Hindi to refer to Sufi masters or similarly honored saints. Additionally, saints are also sometimes referred to in the Persian or Urdu vernacular with \"Hazrat.\" In Islamic mysticism, a \"pīr's\" role is to guide and instruct his disciples on the mystical path. Hence, the key difference between the use of \"walī\" and \"pīr\" is that the former does not imply a saint who is also a spiritual master with disciples, whilst the latter directly does so through its connotations of \"elder.\" Additionally, other Arabic and Persian words that also often have the same connotations as \"pīr\", and hence are also sometimes translated into English as \"saint\", include \"murshid\" (, meaning \"guide\" or \"teacher\"), \"sheikh\" and \"sarkar\" (Persian word meaning \"master\").\n\nIn the Turkish Islamic lands, saints have been referred to by many terms, including the Arabic \"walī\", the Persian \"s̲h̲āh\" and \"pīr\", and Turkish alternatives like \"baba\" in Anatolia, \"ata\" in Central Asia (both meaning \"father\"), as well as \"eren\" or \"ermis̲h̲\" (< ermek \"to reach, attain\") or \"yati̊r\" (\"one who settles down\") in Anatolia. Their tombs, meanwhile, are \"denoted by terms of Arabic or Persian origin alluding to the idea of pilgrimage (\"mazār\", \"ziyāratgāh\"), tomb (\"ḳabr\", \"maḳbar\") or domed mausoleum (\"gunbad\", \"ḳubba\"). But such tombs are also denoted by terms usually used for dervish convents, or a particular part of it (\"tekke\" in the Balkans, \"langar\", 'refectory,' and \"ribāṭ\" in Central Asia), or by a quality of the saint (\"pīr\", 'venerable, respectable,' in Azerbaijan).\"\n\nAccording to various traditional Sufi interpretations of the Quran, the concept of sainthood is clearly described. Some modern scholars, however, assert that the Quran does not \"explicitly\" outline a doctrine or theory of saints. In the Quran, the adjective \"walī\" is applied to God, in the sense of Him being the \"friend\" of all believers (2:257). However, particular Quranic verses were interpreted by early Islamic scholars to refer to a special, exalted group of holy people. These included 10:62: \"Surely God's friends (\"awliyāa l-lahi\"): no fear shall be on them, neither shall they sorrow,\" and 5:54, which refers to God's love for those who love Him. Additionally, some scholars interpreted 4:69, \"Whosoever obeys God and the Messenger, they are with those unto whom God hath shown favor: the prophets and the \"ṣidīqīna\" and the martyrs and the righteous. The best of company are they,\" to carry a reference to holy people who were not prophets and were ranked below the latter. The word \"ṣidīqīna\" in this verse literally connotes \"the truthful ones\" or \"the just ones,\" and was often interpreted by the early Islamic thinkers in the sense of \"saints,\" with the famous Quran translator Marmaduke Pickthall rendering it as \"saints\" in their interpretations of the scripture. Furthermore, the Quran referred to the miracles of saintly people who were not prophets like Khidr (18:65-82) and the People of the Cave (18:7-26), which also led many early scholars to deduce that a group of venerable people must exist who occupy a rank below the prophets but are nevertheless exalted by God. The references in the corpus of hadith literature to \"bona fide\" saints like the pre-Islamic Jurayj̲, only lent further credence to this early understanding of saints.\n\nCollected stories about the \"lives or \"vitae\" of the saints\", began to be compiled \"and transmitted at an early stage\" by many regular Muslim scholars, including Ibn Abi al-Dunya (d. 894), who wrote a work entitled \"Kitāb al-Awliyāʾ\" (\"Lives of the Saints\") in the ninth-century, which constitutes \"the earliest [complete] compilation on the theme of God's friends.\" Prior to Ibn Abi al-Dunya's work, the stories of the saints were transmitted through oral tradition; but after the composition of his work, many Islamic scholars began writing down the widely circulated accounts, with later scholars like Abū Nuʿaym al-Iṣfahānī (d. 948) making extensive use of Ibn Abi al-Dunya's work in his own \"Ḥilyat al-awliyāʾ\" (\"The Adornment of the Saints\"). It is, moreover, evident from the \"Kitāb al-Kas̲h̲f wa ’l-bayān\" of the early Baghdadi Sufi mystic Abu Sa'id al-Kharraz (d. 899) that a cohesive understanding of the Muslim saints was already in existence, with al-Kharraz spending ample space distinguishing between the virtues and miracles (\"karāmāt\") of the prophets and the saints. The genre of hagiography (\"manāḳib\") only became more popular with the passage of time, with numerous prominent Islamic thinkers of the medieval period devoting large works to collecting stories of \"various\" saints or to focusing upon \"the marvelous aspects of the life, the miracles or at least the prodigies of a [specific] Ṣūfī or of a saint believed to have been endowed with miraculous powers.\"\n\nIn the late ninth-century, important thinkers in Sunni Islam officially articulated the previously-oral doctrine of an entire hierarchy of saints, with the first written account of this hierarchy coming from the pen of al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi (d. 907-912). With the general consensus of Islamic scholars of the period accepting that the ulema were responsible for maintaining the \"exoteric\" part of Islamic orthodoxy, including the disciplines of law and jurisprudence, while the Sufis were responsible for articulating the religion's deepest inward truths, later prominent mystics like Ibn Arabi (d. 1240) only further reinforced this idea of a saintly hierarchy, and the notion of \"types\" of saints became a mainstay of Sunni mystical thought, with such types including the \"ṣiddīqūn\" (\"the truthful ones\") and the \"abdāl\" (\"the substitute-saints\"), amongst others. It should be noted, however, that many of these concepts appear in writing far before al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Arabi; the idea of the \"abdāl\", for example, appears as early as the \"Musnad\" of Ibn Hanbal (d. 855), where the word signifies a group of major saints \"whose number would remain constant, one always being replaced by some other on his death.\" It is, in fact, reported that Ibn Hanbal explicitly identified his contemporary, the mystic Maruf Karkhi (d. 815-20), as one of the \"abdal\", saying: \"He is one of the substitute-saints, and his supplication is answered.\"\nFrom the twelfth to the fourteenth century, \"the general veneration of saints, among both people and sovereigns, reached its definitive form with the organization of Sufism—the mysticism of Islam—into orders or brotherhoods.\" In general Islamic piety of the period, the saint was understood to be \"a contemplative whose state of spiritual perfection ... [found] permanent expression in the teaching bequeathed to his disciples.\" It was by virtue of his spiritual wisdom that the saint was accorded veneration in medieval Islam, \"and it is this which ... [effected] his 'canonization,' and not some ecclesiastical institution\" as in Christianity. In fact, the latter point represents one of the crucial differences between the Islamic and Christian veneration of saints, for saints are venerated by unanimous consensus or popular acclaim in Islam, in a manner akin to all those Christian saints who began to be venerated prior to the institution of canonization. In fact, a belief in the existence of saints became such an important part of medieval Islam that many of the most important creeds articulated during the time period, like the famous \"Creed of Tahawi\", explicitly declared it a requirement for being an \"orthodox\" Muslim to believe in the existence and veneration of saints and in the traditional narratives of their lives and miracles. Hence, we find that even medieval critics of the widespread practice of venerating \"the tombs\" of saints, like Ibn Taymiyyah (d. 1328), never denied the existence of saints as such, with the Hanbali jurist stating: \"The miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct, by the acceptance of all Muslim scholars. And the Qur'an has pointed to it in different places, and the sayings of the Prophet have mentioned it, and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are only people who are innovators and their followers.\" In the words of one contemporary academic, practically all Muslims of that era believed that \"the lives of saints and their miracles were incontestable.\"\n\nIn the modern world, the idea of saints has been challenged by the movements of Salafism and Wahhabism, whose influence has \"formed a front against the veneration and theory of saints.\" For the adherents of Wahhabism, for example, the practice of venerating saints appears as an \"abomination\", for they see in this a form of idolatry. It is for this reason that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which adheres to the Wahhabi creed, \"destroyed the tombs of saints wherever ... able\" during its expansion in the Arabian Peninsula from the eighteenth-century onwards. As has been noted by scholars, the development of these movements have indirectly led to a trend amongst some mainstream Muslims to also resist \"acknowledging the existence of Muslim saints altogether or ... [to view] their presence and veneration as unacceptable deviations.\" At the same time, the movement of Islamic Modernism has also opposed the traditional veneration of saints, for many proponents of this ideology regard the practice as \"being both un-Islamic and backwards ... rather than the integral part of Islam which they were for over a millennium.\" Despite the presence, however, of these opposing streams of thought, the classical doctrine of saint-veneration continues to thrive in many parts of the Islamic world today, playing a vital part in the daily piety of vast portions of Muslim countries like Pakistan, Egypt, Turkey, Senegal, Iraq, Iran, Algeria, Tunisia, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Morocco, as well as in countries with substantive Islamic populations like India, China, Russia, and the Balkans.\n\nThe general definition of the Muslim saint in classical texts is that he represents a \"[friend of God] marked by [special] divine favor ... [and] holiness\", being specifically \"chosen by God and endowed with exceptional gifts, such as the ability to work miracles.\" Moreover, the saint is also portrayed in traditional hagiographies as one who \"in some way ... acquires his Friend's, i.e. God's, good qualities, and therefore he possesses particular authority, forces, capacities and abilities.\" Amongst classical scholars, Qushayri (d. 1073) defined the saint as someone \"whose obedience attains permanence without interference of sin; whom God preserves and guards, in permanent fashion, from the failures of sin through the power of acts of obedience.\" Elsewhere, the same author quoted an older tradition in order to convey his understanding of the purpose of saints, which states: \"The saints of God are those who, when they are seen, God is remembered.\"\n\nMeanwhile, al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi (d. 869), the most significant ninth-century expositor of the doctrine, posited six common attributes of true saints (not necessarily applicable to all, according to the author, but nevertheless indicative of a significant portion of them), which are: (1) when people see him, they are automatically reminded of God; (2) anyone who advances towards him in a hostile way is destroyed; (3) he possesses the gift of clairvoyance (\"firāsa\"); (4) he receives divine inspiration (\"ilhām\"), to be strictly distinguished from revelation proper (\"waḥy\"), with the latter being something only the prophets receive; (5) he can work miracles (\"karāmāt\") by the leave of God, which may differ from saint to saint, but may include marvels such as walking on water (\"al-mas̲h̲y ʿalā ’l-māʾ\") and shortening space and time (\"ṭayy al-arḍ\"); and (6) he associates with Khidr. Al-Tirmidhi states, furthermore, that although the saint is not sinless like the prophets, he or she can nevertheless be \"preserved from sin\" (\"maḥfūz\") by the grace of God. The contemporary scholar of Sufism Martin Lings described the Islamic saints as \"the great incarnations of the Islamic ideal... spiritual giants with which almost every generation was blessed.\"\n\nThe doctrine of saints, and of their miracles, seems to have been taken for granted by many of the major authors of the Islamic Golden Age (ca. 700-1400), as well as by many prominent late-medieval scholars. The phenomena in traditional Islam can be at least partly ascribed to the writings of many of the most prominent Sunni theologians and doctors of the classical and medieval periods, many of whom considered the belief in saints to be \"orthodox\" doctrine. Examples of classical testimonies include:\n\n\nThe rationale for veneration of deceased saints by pilgrims in an appeal for blessings (\"Barakah\") even though the saints will not rise from the dead until the Day of Resurrection (\"Yawm ad-Dīn\") may come from the hadith that states “the Prophets are alive in their graves and they pray”. (According to the Islamic concept of Punishment of the Grave -- established by hadith -- the dead are still conscious and active, with the wicked suffering in their graves as a prelude to hell and the pious at ease.) According to Islamic historian Jonathan A.C. Brown, \"saints are thought to be no different\" than prophets, \"as able in death to answer invocations for assistance\" as they were while alive.\n\nSaints were envisaged to be of different \"types\" in classical Islamic tradition. Aside from their earthly differences as regard their temporal duty (i.e. jurist, hadith scholar, judge, traditionist, historian, ascetic, poet), saints were also distinguished cosmologically as regards their celestial function or standing. In Islam, however, the saints are represented in traditional texts as serving separate celestial functions, in a manner similar to the angels, and this is closely linked to the idea of a celestial hierarchy in which the various types of saints play different roles. A fundamental distinction was described in the ninth-century by al-Tirmidhi in his \"Sīrat al-awliyāʾ\" (\"Lives of the Saints\"), who distinguished between two principal varieties of saints: the \"walī ḥaḳḳ Allāh\", on the one hand, and the \"walī Allāh\" on the other. According to the author, \"the [spiritual] ascent of the \"walī ḥaḳḳ Allāh\" must stop at the end of the created cosmos ... he can attain God's proximity, but not God Himself; he is only admitted to God's proximity (\"muḳarrab\"). It is the \"walī Allāh\" who reaches God. Ascent beyond God's throne means to traverse consciously the realms of light of the Divine Names... When the \"walī Allāh\" has traversed all the realms of the Divine Names, i.e. has come to know God in His names as completely as possible, he is then extinguished in God's essence. His soul, his ego, is eliminated and ... when he acts, it is God Who acts through him. And so the state of extinction means at the same time the highest degree of activity in this world.\"\n\nAlthough the doctrine of the hierarchy of saints is already found in written sources as early as the eighth-century, it was al-Tirmidhi who gave it its first systematic articulation.\nAccording to the author, forty major saints, whom he refers to by the various names of \"ṣiddīḳīn\", \"abdāl\", \"umanāʾ\", and \"nuṣaḥāʾ\", were appointed after the death of Muhammad to perpetuate the knowledge of the divine mysteries vouchsafed to them by the prophet. These forty saints, al-Tirmidhi stated, would be replaced in each generation after their earthly death; and, according to him, \"the fact that they exist is a guarantee for the continuing existence of the world.\" Among these forty, al-Tirmidhi specified that seven of them were especially blessed. Despite their exalted nature, however, al-Tirmidhi emphasized that these forty saints occupied a rank below the prophets. Later important works which detailed the hierarchy of saints were composed by the mystic ʿAmmār al-Bidlīsī (d. between 1194 and 1207), the spiritual teacher of Najmuddin Kubra (d. 1220), and by Ruzbihan Baqli (d. 1209), who evidently knew of \"a highly developed hierarchy of God's friends.\" The differences in terminology between the various celestial hierarchies presented by these authors were reconciled by later scholars through their belief that the earlier mystics had highlighted particular parts and different aspects of a single, cohesive hierarchy of saints.\n\nThe amount of veneration a specific saint received varied from region to region in Islamic civilization, often on the basis of the saint's own history in that region. While the veneration of saints played a crucial role in the daily piety of Sunni Muslims all over the Islamic world for more than a thousand years (ca. 800-1800), exactly \"which\" saints were most widely venerated in any given cultural climate depended on the hagiographic traditions of that particular area. Thus, while Moinuddin Chishti (d. 1236), for example, was honored throughout the Sunni world in the medieval period, his \"cultus\" was especially prominent in the Indian Subcontinent, as that is where he was believed to have preached, performed the majority of his miracles, and ultimately settled at the end of his life.\n\nAs has been remarked by scholars, the veneration of saints has played \"an essential role in the religious, and social life of the Maghreb for more or less a millennium,\" in other words since Islam first reached the lands of North Africa in the eighth-century. The first \"written\" references to ascetic Muslim saints in Africa, \"popularly admired and with followings,\" appear in tenth-century hagiographies. As has been noted by scholars, however, \"the phenomenon may well be older,\" for many of the stories of the Islamic saints were passed down orally before finally being put to writing. One of the most widely venerated saints in early North African Islamic history was Abū Yaʿzā (or Yaʿazzā, d. 1177), an illiterate Sunni Maliki miracle worker whose reputation for sanctity was admired even in his own life. Another immensely popular saint of the time-period was Ibn Ḥirzihim (d. 1163), who also gained renown for his personal devoutness and his ability to work miracles. It was Abu Madyan (d. 1197), however, who eventually became one of the \"Awliya Allah\" of the entire Maghreb. A \"spiritual disciple of these two preceding saints,\" Abū Madyan, a prominent Sunni Maliki scholar, was the first figure in Maghrebi Sufism \"to exercise an influence beyond his own region.\" Abū Madyan travelled to the East, where he is said to have met prominent mystics like the renowned Hanbali jurist Abdul-Qadir Gilani (d. 1166). Upon returning to the Maghreb, Abū Madyan stopped at Béjaïa and \"formed a circle of disciples.\" Abū Madyan eventually died in Tlemcen, while making his way to the Almohad court of Marrakesh; he was later venerated as a prime \"Awliya Allah\" of Tlemcen by popular acclaim.\n\nOne of Abū Madyan's most notable disciples was ʿAbd al-Salām Ibn Mas̲h̲īs̲h̲ (d. 1127), a \"saint ... [who] had a posthumous fame through his being recognised as a master and a 'pole' by\" Abu ’l-Ḥasan al-S̲h̲ād̲h̲ilī (d. 1258). It was this last figure who became \"the\" preeminent saint in Maghrebi piety, due to his being the founder of one of the most famous Sunni Sufi orders of North Africa: the Shadhiliyya tariqa. Adhering to the Maliki rite in its jurisprudence, the Shadhili order produced numerous widely honored Sunni saints in the intervening years, including Fāsī Aḥmad al-Zarrūq (d. 1494), who was educated in Egypt but taught in Libya and Morocco, and Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad al-Jazūlī (d. 1465), \"who returned to Morocco after a long trip to the East and then began a life as a hermit,\" and who achieved widespread renown for the miracles he is said to have wrought by the leave of God. Eventually, the latter was buried in Marrakesh, where he ended up becoming of the city's seven most famous \"Awliya Allah\" for the Sunnis of the area. Some of the most popular and influential Maghrebi saints and mystics of the following centuries were Muḥammad b. Nāṣir (d. 1674), Aḥmad al-Tij̲ānī (d. 1815), Abū Ḥāmid al-ʿArabī al-Darqāwī (d. 1823), and Aḥmad b. ʿAlāwī (d. 1934), with the latter three originating Sufi orders of their own. Famous adherents of the Shadhili order amongst modern Islamic scholars include Abdallah Bin Bayyah (b. 1935), Muhammad Alawi al-Maliki (d. 2004), Hamza Yusuf (b. 1958), and Muhammad al-Yaqoubi (b. 1963).\n\nThe veneration of saints in Maghrebi Sunni Islam has been studied by scholars with regard to the various \"types\" of saints venerated by Sunnis in those areas. These include:\n\n\nRegarding the veneration of saints amongst Sunni Muslims in the Maghreb in the present day, scholars have noted the presence of many \"thousands of minor, local saints whose tombs remain visible in villages or the quarters of towns.\" Although many of these saints lack precise historiographies or hagiographies, \"their presence and their social efficacity ... [are] immense\" in shaping the spiritual life of Muslims in the region. For the vast majority of Muslims in the Maghreb even today, the saints remain \"very much alive at their tomb, to the point that the person's name most often serves to denote the place.\" While this classical type of Sunni veneration represents the most widespread stance in the area, the modern influence of Salafism and Wahhabism have challenged the traditional practice in some quarters.\n\nScholars have noted the tremendously \"important role\" the veneration of saints has historically played in Islamic life all these areas, especially amongst Sunnis who frequent the many thousands of tombs scattered throughout the region for blessings in performing the act of \"ziyāra\". According to scholars, \"between the Turks of the Balkans and Anatolia, and those in Central Asia, despite the distance separating them, the concept of the saint and the organisation of pilgrimages displays no fundamental differences.\" The veneration of saints really spread in the Turkish lands from the tenth to the fourteenth centuries, and played a crucial role in medieval Turkic Sunni piety not only in cosmopolitan cities but also \"in rural areas and amongst nomads of the whole Turkish world.\" One of the reasons proposed by scholars for the popularity of saints in pre-modern Turkey is that Islam was majorly spread by the early Sunni Sufis in the Turkish lands, rather than by purely exoteric teachers. Most of the saints venerated in Turkey belonged to the Hanafi school of Sunni jurisprudence.\n\nAs scholars have noted, saints venerated in traditional Turkish Sunni Islam may be classified into three principal categories:\n\nReverence for Awliya Allah have been an important part of both Sunni and Shia Islamic tradition that particularly important classical saints have served as the heavenly advocates for specific Muslim empires, nations, cities, towns, and villages. With regard to the sheer omnipresence of this belief, the late Martin Lings wrote: \"There is scarcely a region in the empire of Islam which has not a Sufi for its Patron Saint.\" As the veneration accorded saints often develops purely organically in Islamic climates, the \"Awliya Allah\" are often recognized through popular acclaim rather than through official declaration. Traditionally, it has been understood that the \"Wali'Allah\" of a particular place prays for that place's wellbeing and for the health and happiness of all who live therein. Here is a partial list of Muslim \"Awliya Allah\":\n\n\n\n\n"}

The official nominees are presented to the Whitney Awards Committee which checks for eligibility and acts as a preliminary judging panel, reducing the number of nominees to no more than five per category.\n\nFinally, ballots are sent to the Whitney Awards Academy, an invitation-only group consisting of authors, bookstore owners/managers, distributors, critics, and other industry professionals. By a popular vote, they decide on the winners. The awards are presented at a dinner held at the conclusion of the annual LDStorymakers conference and writing \"boot camp.\"\n\nUntil the 2010 awards (presented 2011), books were not allowed to win in more than one category.\n\nThe awards are named after Orson F.

{"id": "15341211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15341211", "title": "Zilberman Method", "text": "Zilberman Method\n\nThe Zilberman Method is a system of teaching the Torah to young students, pioneered by Jerusalem rabbi Yitzhak Shlomo Zilberman, that emphasizes rote learning of the text, while leaving the more advanced study of Talmud to older students. Schools employing the method are colloquially referred to as Zilberman Schools.\n\nThe Zilberman Method draws upon traditional teaching methods as outlined by Chazal and championed by Judah Loew ben Bezalel and the Vilna Gaon. The Mishnah and the Talmud set forth halakhic guidelines for teaching Torah to children. These guidelines include the ages at which texts should be studied: \"Five years old [is the age to begin studying] Scripture; a ten year-old [learns] the Mishnah; a thirteen year-old for the \"mitzvot\" ([obligation of the] commandments); a fifteen year-old [for the study] of Talmud…\"; the times of study (including Shabbat for children; \"Hachazan roeh heichan tinokot korin\" – the chazzan observes [on Shabbat] where [in the text] the children are reading) and the manner of teaching (\"safi lei k’tura\" –stuffing the children like oxen; \"ligmar inish v’hadar lisbor\" –read the text and then explain it.\n\nThe Zilberman method has children focus exclusively on Tanakh and Mishnah in their younger years, ensuring that they know large portions of both areas by heart before they begin learning \"Gemara\" (Talmud). Indeed, graduates of such schools tend to have impressive fluency in these areas. Two key elements in Zilberman’s methodology, however, must be singled out: \"chazarah\" (review) and student participation.\n\nIn the Zilberman-styled school, a new text of Chumash (Scripture) is introduced in the following manner. On Monday and Tuesday, the teacher chants the text with the \"tropp\" (\"ta’amei ha’mikra\") and the students immediately imitate him. This is repeated several times until the students are able to read the text independently. Then the teacher introduces the translation/explanation of the text and invites students to participate in the process. New words typically need to be translated only once; subsequently, students are encouraged to call out the translation on their own. All translations are strictly literal. If the translation does not automatically yield a comprehensible meaning, the students are invited to try to find one. The class spends the rest of the week reviewing the material. Each pasuk is reviewed with the tropp at least twenty-four times. Adjustments are made for each grade level.\n\nIn Shabbat 63a it states, \"A man should recite, and only later expound.\" This is in contrast to standard procedure in the Torah world, where intense scrutiny of the text at a relatively young age is favoured over the covering and committing to memory of vast amounts of material. Zilberman also instituted that school sessions be continued on Shabbat and Jewish holidays, albeit at a reduced schedule.\n\nYitzhak Shlomo Zilberman kept the practice of donning his tefilin all day, and so encouraged his students. In normative practice, the tefilin are removed after Shacharit. Zilberman was one of the first rabbis to promote the usage of tekhelet, and encouraged his students and family to make use of the dye in their tzitzit. He encouraged his students to get married young, because it states in \"Pirkei Avot\" “An 18 year-old [enters] the \"chuppah\" (wedding canopy)\".\n\nThe Zilberman Method is not a new innovation, but rather a return to an ancient form of Torah study elucidated in the Mishna and Talmud, and favoured by both the Maharal and the Vilna Gaon.\n\nZilberman found the existing Jerusalem \"heder\"s' curriculum not suitable for his own children, so he began to teach them at home according to his method. In the beginning of the 1980s, after years of limited success with incorporating his teaching style in existing institutions, Zilberman founded, with the help of his sons, a school in the northern part of the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem. The school, Yeshivat Aderet Eliyahu – also known as \"Zilberman's Cheder\" – adopted its founder's method, and became an inspiration for many of his students, who later branched out all over Israel founding schools with the same teaching approach.\n\nZilberman's life work was favoured by rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and the Tchebiner Rav.\n\nIn addition to Yeshivat Aderet Eliyahu, numerous other schools throughout Israel adhere to Zilberman Method principles, including Talmud Torah Yishrei Lev.\n\n"}
