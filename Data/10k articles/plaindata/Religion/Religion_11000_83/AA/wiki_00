{"id": "63118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63118", "title": "Avesta", "text": "Avesta\n\nThe Avesta is the primary collection of religious texts of Zoroastrianism, composed in the otherwise unrecorded Avestan language.\n\nThe Avesta texts fall into several different categories, arranged either by dialect, or by usage. The principal text in the liturgical group is the \"Yasna\", which takes its name from the Yasna ceremony, Zoroastrianism's primary act of worship, and at which the \"Yasna\" text is recited. The most important portion of the \"Yasna\" texts are the five Gathas, consisting of seventeen hymns attributed to Zoroaster himself. These hymns, together with five other short Old Avestan texts that are also part of the \"Yasna\", are in the Old (or 'Gathic') Avestan language. The remainder of the \"Yasna\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> texts are in Younger Avestan, which is not only from a later stage of the language, but also from a different geographic region.\n\nExtensions to the Yasna ceremony include the texts of the \"Vendidad\" and the \"Visperad\". The \"Visperad\" extensions consist mainly of additional invocations of the divinities (\"yazata\"s), while the \"Vendidad\" is a mixed collection of prose texts mostly dealing with purity laws. Even today, the \"Vendidad\" is the only liturgical text that is not recited entirely from memory. Some of the materials of the extended Yasna are from the \"Yasht\"s, which are hymns to the individual \"yazata\"s. Unlike the \"Yasna\", \"Visperad\" and \"Vendidad\", the \"Yasht\"s and the other lesser texts of the Avesta are no longer used liturgically in high rituals. Aside from the \"Yasht\"s, these other lesser texts include the \"Nyayesh\" texts, the \"Gah\" texts, the \"Siroza\", and various other fragments. Together, these lesser texts are conventionally called \"Khordeh Avesta\" or \"Little Avesta\" texts. When the first \"Khordeh Avesta\" editions were printed in the 19th century, these texts (together with some non-Avestan language prayers) became a book of common prayer for lay people.\n\nThe term \"Avesta\" is from the 9th/10th-century works of Zoroastrian tradition in which the word appears as Zoroastrian Middle Persian \"abestāg\", Book Pahlavi \"ʾp(y)stʾkʼ\". In that context, \"abestāg\" texts are portrayed as received knowledge, and are distinguished from the exegetical commentaries (the \"zand\") thereof. The literal meaning of the word \"abestāg\" is uncertain; it is generally acknowledged to be a learned borrowing from Avestan, but none of the suggested etymologies have been universally accepted. The widely repeated derivation from *\"upa-stavaka\" is from Christian Bartholomae (\"Altiranisches Wörterbuch\", 1904), who interpreted \"abestāg\" as a contraction of a hypothetical reconstructed Old Iranian word for \"praise-song\" (Bartholomae: \"Lobgesang\"); that word is not actually attested in any text.\n\nThe surviving texts of the Avesta, as they exist today, derive from a single master copy produced by Sasanian Empire-era (224–651 CE) collation and recension. That master copy, now lost, is known as the 'Sassanian archetype'. The oldest surviving manuscript (\"K1\") of an Avestan language text is dated 1323 CE. Summaries of the various Avesta texts found in the 9th/10th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition suggest that a significant portion of the literature in the Avestan language has been lost. Only about one-quarter of the Avestan sentences or verses referred to by the 9th/10th century commentators can be found in the surviving texts. This suggests that three-quarters of Avestan material, including an indeterminable number of juridical, historical and legendary texts, have been lost since then. On the other hand, it appears that the most valuable portions of the canon, including all of the oldest texts, have survived. The likely reason for this is that the surviving materials represent those portions of the Avesta that were in regular liturgical use, and therefore known by heart by the priests and not dependent for their preservation on the survival of particular manuscripts.\n\nA pre-Sasanian history of the Avesta, if it had one, is in the realm of legend and myth. The oldest surviving versions of these tales are found in the ninth to 11th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition (i.e. in the so-called \"Pahlavi books\"). The legends run as follows: The twenty-one \"nask\"s (\"books\") of the Avesta were created by Ahura Mazda and brought by Zoroaster to his patron Vishtaspa (\"Denkard\" 4A, 3A). Supposedly, Vishtaspa (\"Dk\" 3A) or another Kayanian, Daray (\"Dk\" 4B), then had two copies made, one of which was stored in the treasury, and the other in the royal archives (\"Dk\" 4B, 5). Following Alexander's conquest, the Avesta was then supposedly destroyed or dispersed by the Greeks after they translated the scientific passages that they could make use of (\"AVN\" 7–9, \"Dk\" 3B, 8). Several centuries later, one of the Parthian emperors named Valaksh (one of the Vologases) supposedly then had the fragments collected, not only of those that had previously been written down, but also of those that had only been orally transmitted (\"Dk\" 4C).\n\nThe \"Denkard\" also transmits another legend related to the transmission of the Avesta. In that story, credit for collation and recension is given to the early Sasanian-era priest Tansar (high priest under Ardashir I, \"r.\" 224–242, and Shapur I, \"r\" 240/242–272), who had the scattered works collected, and of which he approved only a part as authoritative (\"Dk\" 3C, 4D, 4E). Tansar's work was then supposedly completed by Adurbad Mahraspandan (high priest of Shapur II, \"r.\" 309–379) who made a general revision of the canon and continued to ensure its orthodoxy (\"Dk\" 4F, \"AVN\" 1.12–1.16). A final revision was supposedly undertaken in the 6th century under Khosrow I (\"Dk\" 4G).\n\nIn the early 20th century, the legend of the Parthian-era collation engendered a search for a 'Parthian archetype' of the Avesta. In the theory of Friedrich Carl Andreas (1902), the archaic nature of the Avestan texts was assumed to be due to preservation via written transmission, and unusual or unexpected spellings in the surviving texts were assumed to be reflections of errors introduced by Sasanian-era transcription from the Aramaic alphabet-derived Pahlavi scripts. The search for the 'Arsacid archetype' was increasingly criticized in the 1940s and was eventually abandoned in the 1950s after Karl Hoffmann demonstrated that the inconsistencies noted by Andreas were actually due to unconscious alterations introduced by oral transmission. Hoffmann identifies these changes to be due in part to modifications introduced through recitation; in part to influences from other Iranian languages picked up on the route of transmission from somewhere in eastern Iran (i.e. Central Asia) via Arachosia and Sistan through to Persia; and in part due to the influence of phonetic developments in the Avestan language itself.\n\nThe legends of an Arsacid-era collation and recension are no longer taken seriously. It is now certain that for most of their long history the Avesta's various texts were handed down orally, and independently of one another, and that it was not until around the 5th or 6th century that they were committed to written form. However, during their long history, only the Gathic texts seem to have been memorized (more or less) exactly. The other less sacred works appear to have been handed down in a more fluid oral tradition, and were partly composed afresh with each generation of poet-priests, sometimes with the addition of new material. The Younger Avestan texts are therefore composite works, with contributions from several different authors over the course of several hundred years.\n\nThe texts became available to European scholarship comparatively late. Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron travelled to India in 1755, and discovered the texts among Indian Zoroastrian (Parsi) communities. He published a set of French translations in 1771, based on translations provided by a Parsi priest. Anquetil-Duperron's translations were at first dismissed as a forgery in poor Sanskrit, but he was vindicated in the 1820s following Rasmus Rask's examination of the Avestan language (\"A Dissertation on the Authenticity of the Zend Language\", Bombay, 1821). Rask also established that Anquetil-Duperron's manuscripts were a fragment of a much larger literature of sacred texts. Anquetil-Duperron's manuscripts are at the Bibliothèque nationale de France ('P'-series manuscripts), while Rask's collection now lies in the Royal Library, Denmark ('K'-series). Other large Avestan language manuscript collections are those of the British Museum ('L'-series), the K. R. Cama Oriental Library in Mumbai, the Meherji Rana library in Navsari, and at various university and national libraries in Europe.\n\nIn its present form, the Avesta is a compilation from various sources, and its different parts date from different periods and vary widely in character. Only texts in the Avestan language are considered part of the Avesta.\n\nAccording to the \"Denkard\", the 21 \"nask\"s (books) mirror the structure of the 21-word-long \"Ahuna Vairya\" prayer: each of the three lines of the prayer consists of seven words. Correspondingly, the \"nask\"s are divided into three groups, of seven volumes per group. Originally, each volume had a word of the prayer as its name, which so marked a volume's position relative to the other volumes. Only about a quarter of the text from the \"nask\"s has survived until today.\n\nThe contents of the Avesta are divided topically (even though the organization of the \"nask\"s is not), but these are not fixed or canonical. Some scholars prefer to place the categories in two groups, the one liturgical, and the other general. The following categorization is as described by Jean Kellens (see bibliography, below).\n\nThe \"Yasna\" (from \"yazišn\" \"worship, oblations\", cognate with Sanskrit \"yajña\"), is the primary liturgical collection, named after the ceremony at which it is recited. It consists of 72 sections called the \"Ha-iti\" or \"Ha\". The 72 threads of lamb's wool in the \"Kushti\", the sacred thread worn by Zoroastrians, represent these sections. The central portion of the Yasna is the \"Gathas\", the oldest and most sacred portion of the Avesta, believed to have been composed by Zarathushtra (Zoroaster) himself. The \"Gathas\" are structurally interrupted by the \"Yasna Haptanghaiti\" (\"seven-chapter \"Yasna\"\"), which makes up chapters 35–42 of the \"Yasna\" and is almost as old as the \"Gathas\", consists of prayers and hymns in honour of the Supreme Deity, Ahura Mazda, the Angels, Fire, Water, and Earth. The younger \"Yasna\", though handed down in prose, may once have been metrical, as the \"Gathas\" still are.\n\nThe \"Visperad\" (from \"vîspe ratavo\", \"(prayer to) all patrons\") is a collection of supplements to the \"Yasna\". The \"Visparad\" is subdivided into 23 or 24 \"kardo\" (sections) that are interleaved into the Yasna during a Visperad service (which is an extended Yasna service).\n\nThe \"Visperad\" collection has no unity of its own, and is never recited separately from the Yasna.\n\nThe \"Vendidad\" (or \"Vidēvdāt\", a corruption of Avestan \"Vī-Daēvō-Dāta\", \"Given Against the Demons\") is an enumeration of various manifestations of evil spirits, and ways to confound them. The \"Vendidad\" includes all of the 19th \"nask\", which is the only \"nask\" that has survived in its entirety. The text consists of 22 \"Fargard\"s, fragments arranged as discussions between Ahura Mazda and Zoroaster. The first \"fargard\" is a dualistic creation myth, followed by the description of a destructive winter on the lines of the Flood myth. The second \"fargard\" recounts the legend of \"Yima\". The remaining \"fargard\"s deal primarily with hygiene (care of the dead in particular) [\"fargard\" 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 19] as well as disease and spells to fight it [7, 10, 11, 13, 20, 21, 22]. \"Fargard\"s 4 and 15 discuss the dignity of wealth and charity, of marriage and of physical effort, and the indignity of unacceptable social behaviour such as assault and breach of contract, and specify the penances required to atone for violations thereof. The \"Vendidad\" is an ecclesiastical code, not a liturgical manual, and there is a degree of moral relativism apparent in the codes of conduct. The \"Vendidad\"s different parts vary widely in character and in age. Some parts may be comparatively recent in origin although the greater part is very old.\n\nThe Vendidad, unlike the Yasna and the Visparad, is a book of moral laws rather than the record of a liturgical ceremony. However, there is a ceremony called the \"Vendidad\", in which the Yasna is recited with all the chapters of both the Visparad and the Vendidad inserted at appropriate points. This ceremony is only performed at night.\n\nThe \"Yasht\"s (from \"yešti\", \"worship by praise\") are a collection of 21 hymns, each dedicated to a particular divinity or divine concept. Three hymns of the Yasna liturgy that \"worship by praise\" are—in tradition—also nominally called \"yasht\"s, but are not counted among the \"Yasht\" collection since the three are a part of the primary liturgy. The \"Yasht\"s vary greatly in style, quality and extent. In their present form, they are all in prose but analysis suggests that they may at one time have been in verse.\n\nThe \"Siroza\" (\"thirty days\") is an enumeration and invocation of the 30 divinities presiding over the days of the month. (cf. Zoroastrian calendar). The \"Siroza\" exists in two forms, the shorter (\"little \"Siroza\"\") is a brief enumeration of the divinities with their epithets in the genitive. The longer (\"great \"Siroza\"\") has complete sentences and sections, with the \"yazata\"s being addressed in the accusative.\n\nThe Siroza is never recited as a whole, but is a source for individual sentences devoted to particular divinities, to be inserted at appropriate points in the liturgy depending on the day and the month.\n\nThe five \"Nyayesh\"es, abbreviated \"Ny.\", are prayers for regular recitation by both priests and laity. They are addressed to the Sun and Mithra (recited together thrice a day), to the Moon (recited thrice a month), and to the Waters and to Fire. The \"Nyayesh\"es are composite texts containing selections from the Gathas and the Yashts, as well as later material.\n\nThe five \"gāh\"s are invocations to the five divinities that watch over the five divisions (\"gāh\"s) of the day. \"Gāh\"s are similar in structure and content to the five \"Nyayesh\"es.\n\nThe \"Afrinagan\"s are four \"blessing\" texts recited on a particular occasion: the first in honor of the dead, the second on the five epagomenal days that end the year, the third is recited at the six seasonal feasts, and the fourth at the beginning and end of summer.\n\nAll material in the \"Avesta\" that is not already present in one of the other categories falls into a \"fragments\" category, which – as the name suggests – includes incomplete texts. There are altogether more than 20 fragment collections, many of which have no name (and are then named after their owner/collator) or only a Middle Persian name. The more important of the fragment collections are the \"Nirangistan\" fragments (18 of which constitute the \"Ehrbadistan\"); the \"Pursishniha\" \"questions,\" also known as \"Fragments Tahmuras\"; and the \"Hadokht Nask\" \"volume of the scriptures\" with two fragments of eschatological significance.\n\nOnly texts preserved in the Avestan language count as scripture and are part of the Avesta. Several other secondary works are nonetheless crucial to Zoroastrian theology and scholarship.\n\nThe most notable among the Middle Persian texts are the \"Dēnkard\" (\"Acts of Religion\"), dating from the ninth century; the \"Bundahishn\" (\"Primordial Creation\"), finished in the eleventh or twelfth century, but containing older material; the \"Mainog-i-Khirad\" (\"Spirit of Wisdom\"), a religious conference on questions of faith; and the \"Book of Arda Viraf\", which is especially important for its views on death, salvation and life in the hereafter. Of the post-14th century works (all in New Persian), only the \"Sad-dar\" (\"Hundred Doors, or Chapters\"), and \"rivayat\"s (traditional treatises) are of doctrinal importance. Other texts such as \"Zartushtnamah\" (\"Book of Zoroaster\") are only notable for their preservation of legend and folklore. The \"Aogemadaeca\" \"we accept,\" a treatise on death is based on quotations from the Avesta.\n\n\n"}

The site, located on a hill, was known initially by its Arabic name Sheikh Ibreik or Sheikh Abreik, and which historical geographer Samuel Klein in 1936 identified as Talmudic Beit She'arim. Another Arabic name is \"bayt al-ġurabāʾ\" ().\n\nThe partially excavated archaeological site consists mainly of an extensive necropolis of rock-cut tombs and some remains of the town itself. The site is managed by the National Parks Authority as the Beit She'arim National Park. It borders the town of Kiryat Tiv'on on the northeast and is located five kilometres west of Moshav Beit She'arim. It is situated 20 km east of Haifa in the southern foothills of the Lower Galilee.\n\nIn 2015 it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The rationale of the committee was as follows: The town's vast necropolis, carved out of soft limestone, contains more than 30 burial cave systems. Although only a portion of the necropolis has been excavated, it has been likened to a book inscribed in stone. Its catacombs, mausoleums, and sarcophagi are adorned with elaborate symbols and figures as well as an impressive quantity of incised and painted inscriptions in Hebrew, Aramaic, Palmyrene, and Greek, documenting two centuries of historical and cultural achievement. The wealth of artistic adornments contained in this, the most ancient extensive Jewish cemetery in the world, is unparalleled anywhere.\n\nAccording to Moshe Sharon, following Yechezkel Kutscher, the name of the city was Beit She'arayim or Kfar She'arayim (the House/Village of Two Gates). The ancient Yemenite Jewish pronunciation of the name is also \"Bet She'arayim\", which is more closely related to the Ancient Greek rendition of the name, i.e. Βησάρα, \"Besara\".\n\nThe popular orthography for the Hebrew word for house, , is \"beit\", while the traditional King James one is \"beth\", the effort being now to replace both with the etymologically better suited \"bet\".\n\nPottery shards discovered at the site indicate that a first settlement there dates back to the Iron Age.\n\nBeit She'arayim was founded at the end of the 1st century BCE, during the reign of King Herod. The Roman Jewish historian Josephus Flavius, in his \"Vita\", referred to the city in Greek as Besara, the administrative center of the estates of Queen Berenice in the Jezreel Valley.\n\nBenjamin Mazar described it as a prosperous Jewish town eventually destroyed by fire in 352, at the end of the Jewish revolt against Gallus and that after some time it was renewed as a Byzantine city, but more recent research shows that the Gallus revolt had a much lesser impact on the town. The Galilee earthquake of 363 did damage Bet She'arayim, but without long-lasting effects.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, the Sanhedrin (Jewish legislature and supreme council) moved to Beit She'arayim. The town is mentioned rabbinical literature as an important center of Jewish learning during the 2nd century. Rabbi Judah the Prince (Yehudah HaNasi), head of the Sanhedrin and compiler of the Mishna, lived there. In the last seventeen years of his life, he moved to Sepphoris for health reasons, but planned his burial in Beit She'arim. According to tradition, he owned there land he received as a gift from his friend, the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. The most desired burial place for Jews was the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, but in 135 CE, when Jews were barred from the area, Beit She'arim became an alternative. The fact that Rabbi Judah was buried there led many other Jews from all over the country and from the Jewish Diaspora, from nearby Phoenicia to far-away Himyar in Yemen, to be buried next to his grave.\n\nWhile it was originally thought that Bet She'arayim was destroyed during the Jewish revolt against Gallus in the mid-4th century, recent research has revealed the destruction to be far less extensive. An earthquake in 386 caused some damage, but the town recovered and enjoyed prosperity during the era of Byzantine rule. Almost 300 inscriptions primarily in Greek, but also in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Palmyrene were found on the walls of the catacombs containing numerous sarcophagi.\n\nFrom the beginning of the Early Islamic period (7th century), settlement was sparse. Excavations uncovered 75 lamps dating to the period of Umayyad (7th-8th centuries) and Abassid (8th-13th centuries) rule over Palestine. A large Abbasid-period glassmaking facility from the 9th century was also found at the site (see below).\n\nThere is some evidence of activity in the former city area and necropolis dating to the Crusader period (12th century), probably connected to travellers and temporary settlement.\n\nA small Arab village called Sheikh Bureik was located here in the late 16th century. A map by Pierre Jacotin from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 showed the place, named as \"Cheik Abrit.\"\n\nThe village is mentioned again in The Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) citing data from 1859, and in 1875 by Victor Guérin. In 1872, the Ottoman authorities sold Shayk Abreik (together with a total of 23 villages and some seventy square miles of land) for £20,000 to the Sursuk family of Lebanon. \"The Survey of Western Palestine\", published in 1881, describes Sheikh Abreik as a small village situated on a hill with a conspicuous \"maqam\" (sanctuary, holy tomb) located to the south. The village houses were made mostly of mud, and it belonged to the Sursuk family. The population at this time was estimated to be around 150. During World War I, the \"finest oaks\" of Sheikh Bureik were \"ruthlessly destroyed\" by the Turkish Army for use as rail fuel.\n\nThe October 1922 census of Palestine recorded Sheikh Abreik with a population of 111 Muslims. At some time during the early 1920s, the Sursuk family sold the lands of the village to the Jewish National Fund, via Yehoshua Hankin, a Zionist activist who was responsible for most of the major land purchases of the World Zionist Organization in Ottoman Palestine. After the sale, which included lands from the Arab villages of Harithiya, Sheikh Abreik and Harbaj, a total of 59 Arab tenants were evicted from the three villages, with 3,314 pounds compensation paid. In 1925 an agricultural settlement also named Sheikh Abreik was established by the Hapoel HaMizrachi, a Zionist political party and settlement movement.\n\nThe archaeological importance of the site was recognized in the 1880s by the Survey of Western Palestine, which explored many tombs and catacombs but did no excavation. The Arab Palestinian village of Sheikh Bureik was located on the hill until the 1920s, when the land was purchased by the Jewish National Fund. In 1936, Alexander Zaïd, employed by the JNF as a watchman, reported that he had found a breach in the wall of one of the caves which led into another cave decorated with inscriptions. In the 1930s and 1950s, the site was excavated by Benjamin Mazar and Nahman Avigad.\n\nMost of the remains date from the 2nd to 4th century CE. A large number of individuals were buried in the more than twenty catacombs of the necropolis. Geographical references in inscriptions on the walls of the catacombs reveal that the necropolis was used by people from the town of Beit She'arim, from elsewhere in Galilee, and even from cities as far away as Palmyra and Tyre.\n\nAside from an extensive body of inscriptions in several languages, the walls and tombs have many images, engraved and carved in relief, ranging from Jewish symbols and geometric decoration to animals and figures from Hellenistic myth and religion.\n\nIn October 2009, two new caves were opened to the public whose burial vaults date to the first two centuries CE.\n\nThe Jerusalem Talmud cites Beit She'arim as the burial place of Rabbi Judah the Prince, Yehuda HaNasi in Hebrew. His funeral is described as follows: \"Miracles were wrought on that day. It was evening and all the towns gathered to mourn him, and eighteen synagogues praised him and bore him to Bet Shearim, and the daylight remained until everyone reached his home (Ketubot 12, 35a).\" The fact that Rabbi Judah was buried here is believed to be a major reason for the popularity of the necropolis in Late Antiquity. The catacomb No. 14 is likely to have belonged to the family of Rabbi Judah the Prince. A clear inscription stating the name and title of Rabbi Judah the Prince in that catacomb identifies it as his burial site. A Hebrew wall inscription from Catacomb 14 reads \"Simon [Shimon] my son shall be hakham [president of the Sanhedrin], Gamaliel my son patriarch, Hanania bar Hama shall preside over the great court\", in reference to Rabbi Judah's sons Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Gamliel, and to his student, Rabbi Hanina bar Hama. Two tombs located next to each other within the same catacomb are identified by bilingual Hebrew and Greek inscriptions as those of \"R. Gamliel\" and \"R. Shimon\", believed to refer to Judah's sons, the \"nasi\" Gamaliel III and the \"hakham\" Rabbi Shimon.\n\nIn 1937, Benjamin Mazar revealed at Beit She'arim a system of tombs belonging to the Jews of Himyar (now Yemen) dating back to the 3rd century CE. The strength of ties between Yemenite Jewry and the Land of Israel can be learnt by the system of tombs at Beit She'arim dating back to the 3rd century. It is of great significance that Jews from Ḥimyar were being brought for interment in what was then considered a prestigious place, near the catacombs of the Sanhedrin. Those who had the financial means brought their dead to be buried in the Land of Israel, as it was considered an outstanding virtue for Jews not to be buried in foreign lands, but rather in the land of their forefathers. It is speculated that the Ḥimyarites, during their lifetime, were known and respected in the eyes of those who dwelt in the Land of Israel, seeing that one of them, whose name was Menaḥem, was coined the epithet \"qyl ḥmyr\" [prince of Ḥimyar], in the eight-character Ḥimyari ligature, while in the Greek inscription he was called \"Menae presbyteros\" (Menaḥem, the community's elder). The name of a woman written in Greek in its genitive form, Ενλογιαζ, is also engraved there, meaning either 'virtue', 'blessing', or 'gratis'; however, its precise transcription remains of scholarly dispute.\n\nIn 1956, a bulldozer working at the site unearthed an enormous rectangular slab, 11×6.5×1.5 feet, weighing 9 tons. Initially, it was paved over, but it was eventually studied and found to be a gigantic piece of glass. A glassmaking furnace was located here in the 9th century during the Abbasid period, which produced great batches of molten glass that were cooled and later broken into small pieces for crafting glass vessels.\n\nAn elegy written in Arabic script typical of the 9-10th century and containing the date AH 287 or 289 (AD 900 or 902) was found in the \"Magharat al-Jahannam\" (\"Cave of Hell\") catacomb during excavations conducted there in 1956. The sophisticated and beautifully worded elegy was composed by the previously unknown poet Umm al-Qasim, whose name is given in acrostic in the poem, and it can be read in Moshe Sharon's book or here on Wikipedia.\n\nMoshe Sharon speculates that this poem might be marking the beginning of the practice of treating this site as the sanctuary of Sheikh Ibreik and suggests the site was used for burial at this time and possibly later as well. He further notes that the cave within which the inscription was found forms part of a vast area of ancient ruins which constituted a natural place for the emergence of a local shrine. Drawing on the work of Tawfiq Canaan, Sharon cites his observation that 32% of the sacred sites he visited in Palestine were located in the vicinity of ancient ruins.\n\nThe excavations at the site were resumed by Adi Erlich, on behalf of the Zinman Institute of Archaeology, The University of Haifa. Erlich is focusing her excavation on the hilltop above the necropolis, where the ancient town had existed.\n\n\n"}

The diocese only covers the Isle of Man. The Cathedral Church of St German where the bishop's seat is located, is in the town of Peel. St German's was elevated to cathedral status on 1 November 1980.\n\nThe bishop is an \"ex officio\" member of the Legislative Council of the Isle of Man (the upper house of Tynwald, the parliament of the Isle of Man) and of Tynwald Court. The bishop's residence is Thie yn Aspick (Bishop's House), Douglas.\n\nThe right to appoint the Bishop of Sodor and Man is vested in the British crown; the Monarch acts, perhaps somewhat anomalously (in view of Man's status as a Crown Dependency), on the advice of the Prime Minister. However, unlike diocesan bishops in England, who are formally elected by the canons of the cathedral church in accordance with the monarch's \"congé d'elire\", the Bishop of Sodor and Man is appointed directly by the monarch by letters patent.\n\nPeter Eagles was appointed Bishop of Sodor and Man, and was installed at the Cathedral Church of St German at Peel on 30 September 2017.\n\nThe name \"Sodor and Man\" is from an earlier diocese which included not only the Isle of Man but also the Hebrides. The name for this whole area in the original Norse was \"Suðreyjar\" (\"Sudreys\" or \"southern isles\"). In Latin, the corresponding adjective was \"Sodorensis\", later abbreviated in the English title as Sodor. \nIn the Middle Ages, the diocese was considered part of Scotland, and was under the control of neither the Archbishop of York nor the Archbishop of Canterbury. During the Great Schism, the Pope created a different line of bishops in the southern part of the diocese which became part of the Church of England. An Act of Parliament in 1542, during the reign of King Henry VIII, included the diocese in the Province of York. The termination \"and Man\" appears to have been added in the 17th century, as later generations did not realise that \"Sodor\" originally included the Isle of Man. The designation \"Sodor and Man\" had become a fixture by 1684.\n\nThe bishops of Mann and the Isles () were also styled bishops of Sodor (Old Norse: \"Suðreyjar\"; ; meaning Southern Isles, which comprised the Hebrides, the islands of the Firth of Clyde and the Isle of Man).\n\nThe Bishop of Sodor and Man is mentioned in the song \"If you Want a Receipt for that Popular Mystery\" sung by Colonel Calverley in the operetta \"Patience\" (1881) by Gilbert and Sullivan. The song lists the elements of a Heavy Dragoon, including \"Style of the Bishop of Sodor and Man\". The reference is to Rowley Hill (Bishop 1877-1887).\n\nThe Isle of Sodor (fictional island) is named after the diocese.\n\n"}

The case was filed during British rule in India by Sir Thomas Strangman, the Advocate General of Mumbai at the behest of Adamjee Pirbhai family members against Dawoodi Bohra 51st Dai Syedna Taher Saifuddin. The case was filed in 1917AD and decided in 1921AD. The claim was based on the belief of Imam as representative of the Prophet, and through him the representative of God, having withdrawn from the world, someone must represent him, and so ultimately the Deity on earth. The Dai, according to community religious belief, is that representative. The ownership of the Chandabhoy ‘Galla’( box kept for religious offerings) was challenged on the plea of improper succession. Issues raised, however, were of far greater significance than the properties included in the case. The ownership was decided in favor of Syedna, arguing succession proper.\n\nThe case was also historic in the sense that similar case was put up in the court of Mughal emperor Akbar, in year 1591AD, where representation was challenged on the legal point of proper accountability and proper succession resulting in royal farman(order) issued in favor of 27th Dai Dawood Bin Qutubshah. In 2014, similar case moved to the high court in Mumbai to decide, valid succession of 53rd Syedna (Dai) of the Dawoodi Bohra community. Sir Thomas Strangman observes in his book \"Indian Courts and Characters\", the case is remarkable not only for its length, but for the amazing claims put forward on behalf of the 'Mullaji'(Syedna Taher), the like of which have never been put forward in any Court of Law.\nIn the Chandabhoy Galla Case, It was contended that 47th Dai Syedna Abdul Qadir Najmuddin was not validly appointed as Dai al Mutlaq. If this contention was upheld by the court, then the position of all subsequent Dai al Mutlaqs would be put into question. Syedna Taher Saifuddin's claim to be the Dai al Mutlaq was dependent upon the court deciding that Syedna Najmuddin was validly appointed. The court upheld the succession of Taher Saifuddin proper. Considering all the circumstances, the judge held that all the properties in respect of which the declaration was sought were devoted to charitable purposes and that the Mullaji(Syedna Taher) was a trustee thereof.\n\nDuring the proceeding of the case, the remark of British judge Mr. Justice Marten is important on clarifying religious trust. The judge observed that \"high-ranking people could be trusted not to commit criminal breach of trust; but that did not mean that they were beyond the pale of the law. For example, His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury, could not conceivably commit a criminal offence; but he was nevertheless subject to the criminal law, and this fact involved no slur. So, too, in theory the Mullaji Saheb was amenable to the criminal and civil law of this country, though it was unthinkable that he would commit any offence. But the existence of this civil restraint is no more a slur upon an honest trustee, than the existence of criminal restraint is upon an honest citizen. The test of a trust is not whether the alleged trustee can ever commit a breach of trust, which is what the defendants' contention in effect amounts to.\"\n\nDuring testimony of Syedna Taher, he clarified about knowledge classes of 'Zahir', 'Tavil' and, 'Hakikat' present in community. First two are known to many but third one namely 'Hakikat' content some religious truths known to very few. Some of which are known to only 2 or 3 persons in community, and there is also knowledge which is available with Dai only, and he gets it from his predecessor Dai. \n"}

{"id": "43035402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43035402", "title": "Criticism of Protestantism", "text": "Criticism of Protestantism\n\nCriticism of Protestantism covers critiques and questions raised about Protestantism, the Christian tradition based on Martin Luther's Protestant Reformation. While critics praise Protestantism's Christ-centered and Bible-centered faith, Protestantism is faced with criticism mainly from the Catholic Church and some Orthodox Churches, although Protestant denominations have also engaged in self-critique and criticized one another.\n\nThe Catholic biblical critique asserts that the \"Sola scriptura\" principle of Lutheran and Reformed Churches is inaccurate according to the Catholic doctrine.\nWhile Catholic tradition agrees with Protestantism that faith, not works, is necessary for \"initial\" justification, some contemporary Protestant Scholars such as N.T. Wright affirm that both faith and works are necessary for justification. Catholic critics and revisionists also challenge the historicity of the Great Apostasy, a premise of the Protestant Reformation.\n\nWhile Catholic leaders have been seeing the positive side of the founder of Protestantism, Martin Luther, calling him \"thoroughly Christocentric\" and saying that his intention was \"to renew the Church and not to divide it\", Catholic doctrine views Protestantism as \"suffering from defects\", not possessing the fullness of truth and lacking \"the fullness of the means of salvation\".\n\nProtestants also engage in self-criticism, a special target of which is the fragmentation of Protestant denominations. In addition, due to the fact that Protestantism is not a monolithic tradition, some Protestant denominations criticize the beliefs of other Protestants. For example, the Reformed Churches criticize the Methodist Churches for the latter denomination's belief in the doctrine of unlimited atonement, in a long-term debate between Calvinists and Arminians.\n\n\"Sola scriptura\", one of the Five Principles shared by Lutheran and Reformed Churches, originated during the Protestant Reformation, is a formal principle of many Protestant denominations. Baptist Churches as well share the \"Sola scriptura\" principle and state that the Bible alone is the sole source of knowledge, truth and revelation sent directly from God, the only true Word of God, sufficient of itself to be the supreme authority of the Christian faith.\n\nIn contrast, the Anglican Communion and the Methodist Church uphold the doctrine of \"prima scriptura\", which holds that Sacred tradition, reason and experience are the sources of Christian doctrine, but are nonetheless subordinate to the authority of the Bible as well.\n\nAccording to Benedict XVI, the Catholic Church holds a very different view on the Bible and doesn't consider itself to be a \"Religion of the book\": \"while in the [Catholic] Church we greatly venerate the sacred Scriptures, the Christian faith is not a 'religion of the book': Christianity is the 'religion of the Word of God'...together with the Church’s living Tradition, [the Scripture] constitutes the supreme rule of faith.\"\n\nAt \"the crux of the disputes\" are the doctrine on justification and \"Sola fide\", two of the core principles of Protestantism.\n\nThe immediate official Catholic response to the Reformation, the Council of Trent, affirmed in 1547 the foundational importance of faith as part of its doctrinal tradition, \"we are therefore considered to be justified by faith, because faith is the beginning of human salvation, the foundation, and the root of all Justification...none of those things which precede justification --whether faith or works-- merit the grace itself of justification.\"\n\nMany centuries later, in 1999 the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity and the Lutheran World Federation have found basic doctrinal agreements in the \"Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification\", showing \"a common understanding\" of the justification: \"By grace alone, in faith in Christ's saving work and not because of any merit on our part, we are accepted by God and receive the Holy Spirit, who renews our hearts while equipping and calling us to good works.\" The document states that the Churches now share \"a common understanding of our justification by God's grace through faith in Christ.\" To the parties involved, this essentially resolves the 500-year-old conflict over the nature of justification which was at the root of the Protestant Reformation. The World Methodist Council formally recognized the \"Declaration\" in 2006.\n\nAlthough an important step forward in the Catholic–Lutheran dialogue, the \"Declaration\" continues to show the unsurpassable differences of thought that separate the Catholic Church from the Protestant tradition. Lutherans uphold Luther's doctrine that \"human beings are incapable of cooperating in their salvation ... God justifies sinners in faith alone (\"sola fide\").\" \nAccording to N. T. Wright, \"Paul, in company with mainstream Second Temple Judaism, affirms that God’s final judgment will be in accordance with the entirety of a life led — in accordance, in other words, with works.” Benedict XVI in 2006 declared that \"it is to God and his grace alone that we owe what we are as Christians.\"\n\nMethodist Churches have always emphasized that ordinarily both faith and good works play a role in salvation; in particular, the works of piety and the works of mercy, in Wesleyan-Arminian theology, are \"indispensible for our sanctification\". Methodist Bishop Scott J. Jones in \"United Methodist Doctrine\" says that faith is always necessary to salvation unconditionally. Good works are the exterior result of true faith but are necessary only conditionally, that is, if there is time and opportunity.\n\nThe Vatican's note in response to the \"Declaration\" said that the Protestant formula \"at the same time righteous and sinner\", is not acceptable: \"In baptism everything that is really sin is taken away, and so, in those who are born anew there is nothing that is hateful to God. It follows that the concupiscence [disordered desire] that remains in the baptised is not, properly speaking, sin.\"\n\nAccording to Benedict XVI, the encounter of Christianity with enlightened Greek culture and philosophy is not apostasy into Paganism, but rather a natural development in the history of the early Church; Ratzinger also states that the translation of the Old Testament in Greek and the fact that the New Testament itself was written in Greek are a direct consequence of the biblical revelation's reception by the Hellenistic world.\n\nSome Catholic critics state that Protestant acceptance of the Great Apostasy implies their non-acceptance of the apostolic succession in the Catholic Church and Orthodox Churches. At the same time, a number of Protestant Churches, including Lutheran Churches, the Moravian Church, and the Anglican Communion, affirm that they ordain their clergy in line with the apostolic succession; in 1922, the Eastern Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople recognised Anglican orders as valid.\n\nThe Catholic Church has rejected the validity of Anglican apostolic succession as well as that of other Protestant Churches, saying in regard to the latter that \"the proclamation of \"Sola scriptura\" led inevitably to an obscuring of the older idea of the Church and its priesthood. Thus through the centuries, the imposition of hands either by men already ordained or by others was often in practice abandoned. Where it did take place, it did not have the same meaning as in the Church of Tradition.\"\n\nSome Catholic critics say that Protestant Churches, including the Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Reformed traditions, each teach a different form of the doctrine of the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, with Lutherans affirming Christ's presence as a sacramental union, and Reformed/Presbyterian Christians affirming a pneumatic presence. Baptists, Anabaptists, the Plymouth Brethren, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other Restorationist Protestant denominations affirm that the Lord's Supper is a memorial of Jesus' death, and consider the belief in the real presence of Christ to be unbiblical or a misinterpretation of the Scriptures.\n\nWhile some Protestants, such as Lutherans, have retained the sacrament of confession, most Protestant denominations do not.\n\nThe Anglican and Methodist traditions along with Eastern Orthodoxy, affirm the existence of an intermediate state, Hades, and thus pray for the dead, as do many Lutheran Churches, such as the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, which \"remembers the faithful departed in the Prayers of the People every Sunday, including those who have recently died and those commemorated on the church calendar of saints\".\n\nProtestant Churches are considered by some Catholic critics as a negative force which \"protests\" and revolts against the Catholic Church. Catholic theologian Karl Adam wrote: \"The sixteenth century revolt from the Church led inevitably to the revolt from Christ of the eighteenth century, and thence to the revolt from God of the nineteenth. And thus the modern spirit has been torn loose from the deepest and strongest supports of its life, from its foundation in the Absolute, in the self-existent Being, in the Value of all values... Instead of the man who is rooted in the Absolute, hidden in God, strong and rich, we have the man who rests upon himself, the autonomous man.\"\n\nIn response to Adam's accusation towards Protestantism, the church historian and Protestant theologian Wilhelm Pauck pointed out that \"In summing up [...] the Roman Catholic criticism that the Reformation and Protestantism resulted from a revolt against the Church, we conclude that the Roman Catholic leaders of the sixteenth century are not without responsibility for the break-up of Christian unity\", therefore the Schism between Protestants and Catholics was an inevitable consequence of the Protestant Reformation for which both sides have to be considered responsible.\n\n"}
{"id": "18982948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18982948", "title": "Diet in Sikhism", "text": "Diet in Sikhism\n\nIn Sikhism, only lacto-vegetarian food is served in the Gurdwara (Sikh temple) and in it Sikhs are bound to be meat-free. The general consensus is that Sikhs , once they become Amritdhari (baptised) via the Amrit Sanchaar (baptism ceremony), are forbidden from eating Kutha or ritually-slaughtered (Halal, Kosher) meat because it transgresses one of the four restrictions in the Sikh Code of Conduct.\n\nThe Akal Takht (Central Body for Sikh Temporal Affairs) represents the final authority on controversial issues concerning the Sikh Panth (community or collective). The Hukamnama (edict or clarification), issued by Akal Takht Jathedar (head priest or head caretaker) Sadhu Singh Bhaura dated February 15, 1980, states that eating meat does not go against the code of conduct (Kurehit) of the Sikhs; Amritdhari Sikhs can eat meat as long as it is Jhatka meat.\n\nSome religious sects of Sikhism—Damdami Taksal, Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Namdharis, Guru Nanak Nishkam Sewak Jatha and the 3HO—believe that the Sikh diet should be meat-free. The reason for the disagreement with this ruling is that these sects had many Vaishnav converts to Sikhism who were staunchly vegetarian.\n\nThe Akhand Kirtani Jatha dispute the meaning of the word \"kutha\", claiming it means all meat. However, in mainstream Sikhism this word has been accepted to mean that which has been prepared according to Muslim rituals.\n\nAccording to Surjit Singh Gandhi, the \"Guru Granth Sahib\" on page 472 and Guru Nanak in early 16th century said that \"avoidance of flesh as food was impractical and impossible so long as they used water, since water was the source of all life and the first life principle\".\n\nWithin the gurdwara, the Guru ka Langar (Guru's community kitchen) serves purely lacto-vegetarian food because the Langar is open to all. Since people of many faiths with varying dietary taboos, and since Sikhs accept these restrictions and accommodate people regardless of their faith or culture, the Sikh Gurus adopt vegetarian food for Langar. Meat was included in langar at the time of Guru Angad, but was discontinued to accommodate Vashnavites. The exception to vegetarian langar today is when Nihangs serve meat on the occasion of Holla Mohalla, and call it Maha Prashad.\n\nSikhism argues that the soul can possibly undergo millions of transformations as various forms of life before ultimately becoming human. These life forms could be a rock, vegetation, or an animal. Sikhism does not see a difference between these types of existence, however the human has a privileged position compared to other life forms. In terms of the Sikh view of karma, human life is seen as being most precious, and animal, vegetable, and mineral all viewed as being equally below human life. Therefore Sikhs view eating an animal is the same as eating a plant or mineral.\n\nAccording to the Sikh code of conduct or Rehat Maryada, Sikhs are free to choose whether or not to include meat in their diet.\n\nThe \"Rehat Maryada\" states that Sikhs are bound to avoid meat that is killed in a ritualistic manner such as Halal (Muslim) or Kosher (Jewish).\n\nI. J. Singh states that throughout Sikh history, there have been many subsects of Sikhism that have espoused vegetarianism. However, this was rejected by the Sikh Gurus. Sikhs consider that vegetarianism and meat-eating are unimportant in the realm of Sikh spirituality. Surinder Singh Kohli links vegetarianism to Vashnavite behaviour. Gopal Singh, commenting on meat being served in the langar during the time of Guru Angad Gyani Sher Singh—who was the head priest at the Darbar Sahib—notes that ahimsa does not fit in with Sikh doctrine. W. Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi comment that if the Sikh Gurus had made an issue on vegetarianism, it would have distracted from the main emphasis of Sikh spirituality. H. S. Singha and Satwant Kaur comment on how ritually-slaughtered meat is considered a sin for initiated Sikhs. G. S. Sidhu also notes that ritually-slaughtered meat is taboo for a Sikh. Gurbakhsh Singh comments on how non-Kutha meat is acceptable for the Sikhs. Surinder Singh Kohli comments on the \"fools wrangle over flesh\" quotation from the Guru Granth Sahib by noting how Guru Nanak mocked hypocritical vegetarian priests. Gobind Singh Mansukhani states how vegetarianism and meat-eating has been left to the individual Sikh. Devinder Singh Chahal comments on the difficulties of distinguishing between plant and animal in Sikh philosophy. H. S. Singha comments in his book how the Sikh Gurus ate meat. Khushwant Singh also notes that most Sikhs are meat-eaters and decry vegetarians as daal khorey (lentil-eaters).\n\nThere are a number of eyewitness accounts from European travelers as to the eating habits of Sikhs. According to William Francklin in his writing about Mr George Thomas 1805: \"They are not prohibited the use of Animal food of any kind, excepting Beef, which they are rigidly scrupulous in abstaining from.\"\n\nAccording to Dabistan e Mazhib (a contemporary Persian chronology of the Sikh Gurus), Guru Nanak did not eat meat, and Guru Arjan thought that meat eating was not in accordance with Nanak's wishes. This differs from I. J. Singh's research that states that Guru Nanak ate meat on the way to Kurukshetra. According to Persian records, Guru Hargobind (the 6th Guru) ate meat and hunted, and his practice was adopted by most Sikhs.\n\nMany Sikhs keep Sarbloh Bibek. \"Sarbloh\" means all-iron and \"Bibek\" meaning conscious principles. Sikhs who follow this practice eat from iron bowls and iron plates only. According to Sarbloh Bibek, food must be cooked in iron cauldrons or other iron utensils while reciting Gurbani or Simran (meditating). Sikhs traditionally use sand to clean the iron utensils, but today Sikhs speed up the process using a mixture of dishwashing soap, sand, water, and a steel wool soap pad.\n\nAnother key aspect to maintaining Sarbloh Bibek is that Sikhs must only eat food prepared by other Amritdhari (baptized) Sikhs. Amritdhari Sikhs are also not to eat Jootha food (previously eaten food) from non-Amritdharis.\n\nSarbloh was used by Guru Gobind Singh to prepare Amrit during the Khalsa initiation ceremony in 1699. The Khanda (a double edged knife or sword) was also made of Sarbloh. To this day Amrit Sanchar ceremonies are conducted using a bata (bowl) and Khanda (sword) made of sarbloh.\n\n"}
{"id": "541701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=541701", "title": "Ember days", "text": "Ember days\n\nIn the liturgical calendar of the Western Christian churches, Ember days are four separate sets of three days within the same week — specifically, the Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday — roughly equidistant in the circuit of the year, that are set aside for fasting and prayer. These days set apart for special prayer and fasting were considered especially suitable for the ordination of clergy. The Ember Days are known in Latin as the quattuor anni tempora (the \"four seasons of the year\"), or formerly as the \"jejunia quattuor temporum\" (\"fasts of the four seasons\").\n\nThe four quarterly periods during which the ember days fall are called the embertides.\n\nEmber days have their origin in the Latin \"Quatuor Tempora\" (four times).\n\nThere are various views as to etymology. According to J. M. Neale in \"Essays of Liturgiology\" (1863), Chapter X:\nNeil and Willoughby in \"The Tutorial Prayer Book\" (1913) prefer the view that it derives from the Anglo-Saxon \"ymbren\", a circuit or revolution (from \"ymb\", around, and \"ryne\", a course, running), clearly relating to the annual cycle of the year. The word occurs in such Anglo-Saxon compounds as \"ymbren-tid\" (\"Embertide\"), \"ymbren-wucan\" (\"Ember weeks\"), \"ymbren-fisstan\" (\"Ember fasts\"), \"ymbren-dagas\" (\"Ember days\"). The word \"imbren\" even makes it into the acts of the \"Council of Ænham\" (1009): \"jejunia quatuor tempora quae imbren vocant\", \"the fasts of the four seasons which are called \"imbren'\". It corresponds also with Pope Leo the Great's definition, \"jejunia ecclesiastica per totius anni circulum distributa\" (\"fasts of the church distributed through the whole \"circuit of the year\"\").\n\nFolk etymology even cites the phrase \"may ye rem\"ember\" (the inevitability of death)\" as the source.\n\nThe term \"Ember days\" refers to three days set apart for fasting, abstinence, and prayer during each of the four seasons of the year. The purpose of their introduction was to thank God for the gifts of nature, to teach men to make use of them in moderation, and to assist the needy. \n\nPossibly occasioned by the agricultural feasts of ancient Rome, they came to be observed by Christians for the sanctification of the different seasons of the year. James G. Sabak argues that the Embertide vigils were \"...not based on imitating agrarian models of pre-Christian Roman practices, but rather on an eschatological rendering of the year punctuated by the solstices and equinoxes, and thus underscores the eschatological significance of all liturgical vigils in the city of Rome.\"\n\nAt first, the Church in Rome had fasts in June, September, and December. The \"Liber Pontificalis\" ascribes to Pope Callixtus I (217-222) a law regulating the fast, although Leo the Great (440-461) considers it an Apostolic institution. When the fourth season was added cannot be ascertained, but Pope Gelasius I (492-496) speaks of all four. The earliest mention of four seasonal fasts is known from the writings of Philastrius, bishop of Brescia (died ca 387) (\"De haeres.\" 119). He also connects them with the great Christian festivals.\n\nAs the Ember Days came to be associated with great feast days, they later lost their connection to agriculture and came to be regarded solely as days of penitence and prayer. It is only the Michaelmas Embertide, which falls around the autumn harvest, that retains any connection to the original purpose. \n\nThe Christian observance of the seasonal Ember days had its origin as an ecclesiastical ordinance in Rome and spread from there to the rest of the Western Church. They were known as the \"jejunium vernum, aestivum, autumnale and hiemale\", so that to quote Pope Leo's words (A.D. 440 - 461) the law of abstinence might apply to every season of the year. In Leo's time, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday were already days of special observance. In order to tie them to the fasts preparatory to the three great festivals of Christmas, Easter and Pentecost, a fourth needed to be added \"for the sake of symmetry\" as the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" 1911 has it.\n\nFrom Rome the Ember days gradually spread unevenly through the whole of Western Christendom. In Gaul they do not seem to have been generally recognized much before the 8th century.\n\nTheir observance in Britain, however, was embraced earlier than in Gaul or Spain, and Christian sources connect the Ember Days observance with Augustine of Canterbury, AD. 597, said to be acting under the direct authority of Pope Gregory the Great. The precise dates appears to have varied considerably however, and in some cases, quite significantly, the Ember Weeks lost their connection with the Christian festivals altogether. Spain adopted them with the Roman rite in the eleventh century. Charles Borromeo introduced them into Milan in the sixteenth century.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church, ember days have never been observed. Yet in Western Rite Orthodoxy, which is in full communion with the Eastern Orthodox, the Ember days are observed.\n\nThe Ember Weeks, the weeks in which the Ember Days occur, are these weeks:\n\nThe \"Ordo Romanus\" fixed the spring fast in the first week of March (then the first month), thus loosely associated with the first Sunday in Lent; the summer fast in the second week of June, after Whitsunday; the autumnal fast in the third week of September following the Exaltation of the Cross, September 14; and the winter fast in the complete week next before Christmas Eve, following St. Lucy's Day (Dec. 13).\n\nOther regulations prevailed in different countries, until the inconveniences arising from the want of uniformity led to the rule now observed being laid down under Pope Urban II as the law of the church, at the Council of Piacenza and the Council of Clermont, 1095.\n\nThese dates are given in the following mnemonic:\n\nOr in an old English rhyme\n\nThe ember days began on the Wednesday immediately following those days. This meant, for instance, that if September 14 were a Tuesday, the ember days would occur on September 15, 17, and 18. As a result, the ember days in September could fall after either the second or third Sunday in September. This, however, was always the liturgical Third Week of September, since the First Sunday of September was the Sunday closest to September 1 (August 29 to September 4). As a simplification of the liturgical calendar, Pope John XXIII modified this so that the Third Sunday was the third Sunday actually within the calendar month. Thus if September 14 were a Sunday, September 24, 26 and 27 would be ember days, the latest dates possible; with September 14 as a Saturday, however, the ember days would occur on September 18, 20 and 21 - the earliest possible dates.\n\nPrior to the reforms instituted after the Second Vatican Council, the Roman Catholic Church mandated fasting (only one full meal per day plus two partial, meatless meals) on all Ember Days (which meant both fasting and abstinence from meat on Ember Fridays), and the faithful were encouraged (though not required) to receive the sacrament of penance whenever possible. On February 17, 1966, Pope Paul VI's decree Paenitemini excluded the Ember Days as days of fast and abstinence for Roman Catholics.\n\nThe revision of the liturgical calendar in 1969 laid down the following rules for Ember Days and Rogation days:\n\nThey may appear in some calendars as \"days of prayer for peace\".\n\nThey were made optional by churches of the Anglican Communion in 1976. In the Episcopal Church, the September Ember Days are still (optionally) observed on the Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday after Holy Cross Day, so that if September 14 is a Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday, the Ember Days fall on the following Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday (in the second week of September) whereas they fall a week later (in the third week of September) for the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nSome Lutheran church calendars continue the observation of Ember and Rogation days, though the practice has diminished over the past century.\n\nThe rule that ordination of clergy should take place in the Ember weeks was set in documents traditionally associated with Pope Gelasius I (492-496), the pontificate of Archbishop Ecgbert of York, A.D. 732 - 766, and referred to as a canonical rule in a capitulary of Charlemagne. It was finally established as a law of the church in the pontificate of Pope Gregory VII, \"ca\" 1085.\n\nHowever, why Ember Saturdays are traditionally associated with ordinations (other than episcopal ones), by the time of at the latest 1917, major orders could also be conferred on the Saturday preceding Passion Sunday, and on the Easter Vigil; for grave reasons; on Sundays and holy days of obligation; and, for minor orders, even without grave reason, on all Sundays and double feasts (which included most saints' feasts and thus the great majority of the calendar). Present canon law prefers them to be conferred on Sundays and holy days of obligation, but allows them for pastoral reason on any day. In practice the use of Saturdays, though not necessarily Ember Saturdays, still prevails. Subsequently, Pentecost Vigil and the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul (and Saturdays around it) have come much in use as ordination days.\n\n\n"}

It is the state's oldest church camp and is also the largest youth encampment in the United States. While the center primarily serves members of the Baptist faith, attendees from other denominations use the facility as well. Falls Creek is owned and operated by the Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma (BGCO).\n\nFalls Creek was established in the summer of 1917, when J.B. Rounds and W. D. Moorer used donated land to host the meeting of the Baptist Young People's Union, with a total of 273 campers. Since then, Falls Creek has grown astronomically, now averaging 55,000 attendees each summer. In the 1920s, a large outdoor tabernacle was built and remained in use for many years. In 2004, this tabernacle was torn down and construction began on a new one, with services during the 2005 and 2006 sessions being held at an amphitheater. Benches from the old tabernacle, which had been signed by generations of campers, were sold as collector's items. In 2007, the new tabernacle was opened at the 90th Falls Creek session and was the first facility indoors and with rest rooms. Former Rep. and now US Senator James Lankford (R-OK) was Program Director for Falls Creek between 1996 and 2009.\n\nFalls Creek emanates from springs of the Arbuckle aquifer and flows over several waterfalls, the most notable being Price Falls, before dumping into the Washita River. The geologic formations surrounding Falls Creek have been dated to the Ordovician and contain many fossils of organisms that lived during that time. A large graben is present in the camp which contains the clastic materials of the Royer Dolomite which underwent karsting and was redeposited during the Pennsylvanian as the Collins Ranch Conglomerate.\n\nSince 1947, Falls Creek has hosted a special annual gathering, called \"Indian Falls Creek\", of Native American Christians from Christian churches of all denominations across and outside of the United States, and from many churches residing within the state of Oklahoma. This weeklong camp session, which is the largest Indigenous Christian camp in North America, is aimed at families and focuses on topics and activities of particular interest to the various tribes, such as native crafts and language preservation through songs. It is chaired and directed by Native American pastors Bill Barnett and Victor Cope. An annual blood drive and bone marrow registry are also held at this time to increase contributions and minority representation to the repository to provide better matches for those in need, with the blood being stored at the Oklahoma Blood Institute.\n\nMajor League Baseball umpires Ted Barrett and Rob Drake, together with Reverend Dean Esskew, founded \"Calling for Christ\", an organization ministering to professional umpires. In 2001, Barrett and Drake were introduced to Esskew at a conference in Denver where Esskew told them about Falls Creek's facilities. They decided\nto hold their first retreat at Falls Creek and have returned for several years.\n\nIn August 2010, a 20-year-old camper from Wichita, Kansas named Moses Fitchpatrick broke off from his hiking group and went missing. His body was found several days later, two miles south of the Falls Creek property, in rough terrain. The cause of death was undetermined, but likely to have been a result of heat and dehydration.\n\nFalls Creek is considered to be in Davis, Oklahoma for official matters, but many locals and attendees consider it to be an independent township or self-running town, complete with a post office and shops. It also has a lake and a natural spring.\n\nFalls Creek is an unincorporated community in Murray county in the U.S. state of Oklahoma.\n\nFalls Creek is the home of Falls Creek Baptist Conference Center. The B. B. McKinney Chapel in Falls Creek is named in honor of Baylus Benjamin McKinney, the Louisiana native and Christian singer and composer of 149 gospel hymns.\n\nMajor highways are:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1494845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1494845", "title": "Flower Communion", "text": "Flower Communion\n\nFlower Communion is a ritual service common in Unitarian Universalism, though the specific practices vary from one congregation to another. It is usually held before summer, when some congregations recess from holding services. During the ritual, congregants contribute flowers to a central location, and later the flowers are distributed among the participants. \n\nThe Flower Celebration was initiated in Prague on 4 June 1923 by Norbert Čapek, who was also the founder of the Unitarian Church in Czechoslovakia. He saw the need to unite the diverse congregants of his church, from varying Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish backgrounds, without alienating those who had left these traditions. For this reason he honored the universal beauty of nature by having a communion of flowers instead of the Eucharist. Though Unitarian Universalists often refer to the ritual as a Flower Ceremony, Festival, or Communion, Čapek's term \"Oslava Květin\" is more accurately translated as \"Flower Celebration,\" a term which continues to be preferred by Czech Unitarians today.\n\nThe ritual was brought to the United States in 1940 by the Rev. Maja Čapek, Norbert's wife, and was widely adopted by the American Unitarian churches, and their successor Unitarian Universalist congregations. Earlier Unitarian \"Flower Services,\" documented in Midwestern U.S. Unitarian congregations beginning circa 1880, were somewhat different in form from Čapek's service.\n\nIn its essentials, the ritual involves the following: each congregant brings a flower to be used in the service; congregants leave their flowers in a central location either as they enter or during the service. Early in the service the bouquets of flowers are carried in, often by children. Towards the end of the service, the flowers are distributed or congregants come forward and choose a flower different from the one they brought.\n\nThe actual order of service varies widely in different congregations, and often closely resembles the ordinary order of service. Other service elements might include a sermon, the blessing of or a prayer over the flowers, a reading by Norbert Čapek, the history of the ritual, hymns, etc.\n\nMany congregations include this blessing used by Čapek to consecrate the flowers before they are passed to or distributed among the people:\n\n\"Infinite Spirit of Life, we ask thy blessing on these, thy messengers of fellowship and love. May they remind us, amid diversities of knowledge and of gifts, to be one in desire and affection, and devotion to thy holy will. May they also remind us of the value of comradeship, of doing and sharing alike. May we cherish friendship as one of thy most precious gifts. May we not let awareness of another's talents discourage us, or sully our relationship, but may we realize that, whatever we can do, great or small, the efforts of all of us are needed to do thy work in this world.\"\n\nAs with the flaming chalice there is no one orthodox interpretation of this flower ritual. The beauty and diversity of flowers is seen as symbolic of the beauty and diversity of life. Czech Unitarian Iva Fišerová has written: \"The flower is the most beloved symbol for Czech Unitarians... The symbol of various unique beings -- flowers/people -- uniting to create a unique bouquet... Parting and being given a flower as a symbol of anybody in attendance whom I am expected to accept as my brother or sister.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "16150410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16150410", "title": "Freedom of religion in Belarus", "text": "Freedom of religion in Belarus\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion; however, the Government restricted this right in practice.\n\nRespect for religious freedom has recently worsened. The Government continued to restrict religious freedom in accordance with the provisions of a 2002 law on religion and a 2003 concordat with the Belarusian Orthodox Church (BOC), a branch of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) and the only officially recognized Orthodox denomination. Although there is no state religion, the concordat grants the BOC privileged status. Protestants in particular attracted negative attention, presumably for their perceived links with the United States. Numerous anti-Semitic acts and attacks on religious monuments, buildings, and cemeteries occurred with little discernible response from the Government. Authorities kept many religious communities waiting as long as several years for decisions about property registration or restitution. Authorities also harassed and fined members of certain religious groups, especially those that the authorities appeared to regard as bearers of foreign cultural influence or as having a political agenda. Foreign missionaries, clergy, and humanitarian workers affiliated with churches faced many government-imposed obstacles, including deportation and visa refusal or cancellation.\n\nWhile some members of society took positive actions to promote religious freedom, instances of societal abuses and discrimination occurred, including numerous acts of vandalism and arson of religious sites, buildings, and memorials.\n\nThe country has an area of and it had a population of 9,498,400 on 1 January 2016. Historically it has been an area of both interaction and conflict between Belarusian Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism, although relations between the two groups improved during the period covered by this report. January 2007 figures from the Office of the Plenipotentiary Representative for Religious and Nationality Affairs (OPRRNA) showed that approximately 50 percent of Belarusians consider themselves religious. The Government claimed that of persons professing a religious faith, approximately 80 percent belong to the BOC, 14 percent identify themselves with the Catholic Church, 4 percent are members of eastern religious groups (including Muslims, Hare Krishnas, and Baha'i), and 2 percent are Protestant (including Seventh-day Adventists, Old Believers, Jehovah's Witnesses, Apostolic Christians, and Lutherans). Of those who identify themselves as Belarusian Orthodox or Roman Catholic, only 18 percent and 50 percent, respectively, regularly attend religious services. There are also adherents of the Greek Catholic Church and of Orthodox groups other than the BOC. Jewish groups claimed that between 50,000 and 70,000 persons identify themselves as Jewish. Most Jews were not religiously active.\n\nIn January 2007 OPRRNA reported 3,103 religious organizations of 25 religious confessions and denominations in the country, including 2,953 registered religious communities and 150 national and confessional organizations (monasteries, brotherhoods, missionaries, etc.). This included 1,399 Belarusian Orthodox, 493 Evangelical Christian, 440 Roman Catholic, 267 Evangelical Christian Baptist, 74 Seventh-day Adventist, 54 Full Gospel Christians, 33 Old Believer, 29 Jewish, 27 Lutheran, 26 Jehovah's Witness, 24 Muslim, 21 New Apostolic Church, 17 Progressive Judaism, 13 Greek Catholic, 9 Apostolic Christians, 6 Hare Krishnas, 5 Baha'i, 5 Christ's Church, 4 Mormon, 2 Messianic, 1 Reform Church, 1 Presbyterian, 1 Armenian Apostolic, 1 Latin Catholic, and 1 St. Jogan Church communities.\n\nForeign clergy and missionaries attempted to operate in the country but were subject to deportation and visa refusal or cancellation.\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion; however, the Government restricted this right in practice. Although the 1996 amended Constitution affirms the equality of religions and denominations before the law, it also contains restrictive language stipulating that cooperation between the state and religious organizations \"is regulated with regard for their influence on the formation of spiritual, cultural, and state traditions of the Belarusian people.\" OPRRNA regulates all religious matters.\n\nIn 2002 President Lukashenko signed a religion law despite protests from human rights organizations, the European Union, and domestic religious groups. The law recognizes the \"determining role of the Orthodox Church in the historical formation and development of spiritual, cultural, and state traditions of the Belarusian people\" as well as the historical importance of Catholicism, Judaism, Islam, and Evangelical Lutheranism, groups commonly referred to as \"traditional faiths.\" However, the traditional faiths mentioned by the law do not include religious groups such as the Priestless Old Believers and Calvinist churches, which have historical roots in the country dating to the 17th century.\n\nDespite the law's guarantee of religious freedom, it contains a number of restrictive elements that increase the Government's control of the activities of religious groups. The law requires all religious groups to receive prior governmental approval to import and distribute literature, prevents foreigners from leading religious organizations, and denies religious communities the right to establish schools to train their own clergy. In addition, the law confines the activity of religious communities to areas where they are registered and establishes complex registration requirements that some communities, both \"traditional\" and \"nontraditional,\" have difficulty fulfilling. The law also required all previously registered groups to reregister by 2004 and bans all religious activity by unregistered groups.\n\nThe religion law establishes three tiers of religious groups: religious communities, religious associations, and republican religious associations. Religious communities, or local individual religious organizations, must include at least 20 persons over the age of 18 who live in neighboring areas. Religious associations must include at least 10 religious communities, one of which must have been active in the country for at least 20 years, and may be constituted only by a republican (national level) religious association. Republican religious associations can be formed only when there are active religious communities in the majority of the country's six regions.\n\nA religious community must submit a list of its founders' names, places of residence, citizenship, and signatures, along with copies of its founding statutes, minutes of its founding meeting, and permission from the regional authorities confirming the community's right to occupy or use any property indicated in its founding statutes. Regional executive committees (for groups outside of Minsk) or the Minsk City Executive Committee handle all registration applications. For a community practicing a religion not previously \"known\" to the Government, information about the faith must also be submitted. No previously \"unknown\" religious communities were registered during the reporting period.\n\nA religious association must provide a list of members of the managing body with biographical information, proof of permission for the association to be at its designated location, and minutes from its founding congress. Religious associations have the exclusive right to establish religious educational institutions, invite foreigners to work with religious groups, and organize cloistered and monastic communities. All applications to establish associations and republican associations must be submitted to OPRRNA. The Government registered five republican religious organizations during the reporting period. Domestic religious groups continued to call for revocation of at least part of the 2002 law. Christian communities maintained that the law heavily restricts their activities, suppresses freedom of religion, and legalizes criminal prosecution of individuals for their religious beliefs.\n\nThe 2003 concordat between the BOC and the Government guarantees the BOC autonomy in its internal affairs, freedom to perform religious rites and other activities, and a special relationship with the state. The concordat recognizes the BOC's \"influence on the formation of spiritual, cultural, and national traditions of the Belarusian people.\" It calls for the Government and the BOC to cooperate in implementing policy in various fields, including education, development and protection of cultural legacies, and security. Although it states that the agreement would not limit the religious freedoms of other religious groups, the concordat calls for the Government and the BOC to combat unnamed \"pseudoreligious structures that present a danger to individuals and society.\" In addition, the BOC possesses the exclusive right to use the word \"Orthodox\" in its title and to use the image of the Cross of Euphrosynia, the patron saint of the country, as its symbol.\n\nOn January 8, 2007, President Lukashenko honored several BOC members with \"For Spiritual Revival\" awards in recognition of their efforts to develop \"moral traditions which contribute to the spiritual values…between various nationalities and religions.\" In a meeting with BOC bishops on December 21, 2006, President Lukashenko praised the cooperation between the Government and the BOC and stressed their common goals of civil accord and national unity. The President also noted the Government's assistance to the BOC: in 2006 the Government funded $3 million (6.4 billion rubles) in BOC projects.\n\nThe Government restricted religious freedom both actively and indirectly. The Government enforced laws that limit freedom of worship, speech, and assembly. The Government was sometimes responsible for and regularly failed to condemn acts of religious insensitivity or intolerance. The Government frequently referred to groups it did not consider to be traditional as \"nontraditional,\" and government officials and state media widely used the term \"sect\" when referring to such groups, although it is not an official designation. Foreign missionaries, clergy, and charity workers faced increased government obstacles, including deportation and visa refusal or revocation. With or without official registration, some religious groups encountered difficulty renting or purchasing property to establish places of worship, building churches, or reacquiring state-controlled religious property. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is banned in Belarus.\n\nForum 18 reported that the BOC and government officials pressured the parishioners of the unregistered Russian Orthodox Church Abroad (ROCA), which split from the BOC in 1927, to withdraw their names from the ROCA's registration application. If even 1 of the 20 signatories of the application were to withdraw his or her name, ROCA would be forced to start the process again. ROCA stated that from August to October 2006, two Moscow Patriarchate priests threatened to withhold sacraments from the parishioners if they continued supporting the \"illegal and uncanonical sect.\" ROCA claimed that the two priests received the parishioners' names from local authorities.\n\nOn September 14, 2006, Pastor Sergei Heil, chair of the unregistered Independent Evangelical-Lutheran Church in the Republic of Belarus, reported that the Government refused to register it as a republic-wide association. The Church has tried since October 2004 to register as an association and held four founding sessions in Bobruysk to comply with the registration requirements. OPRRNA maintained that there were \"technical errors\" in its application.\n\nMany \"traditional\" and \"nontraditional\" religious groups continued to experience problems obtaining property or registering property, particularly when attempting to convert residential property for religious use. According to the Government, the law permits residential property to be used for religious services only after it has been converted from residential use. The housing code permits the use of such property for nonresidential purposes with the permission of local executive and administrative bodies. As a result, several Protestant churches and \"nontraditional\" groups were at an impasse: denied permission to convert their properties for religious use because they were not registered, but unable to register due to the lack of a legal address. Such groups often were forced to meet illegally or in the homes of individual members.\n\nOn March 22, 2007, the Supreme Economic Court adjourned indefinitely a case involving the New Life Church in Minsk. The New Life Church faced closure because authorities refused to register it at the cow barn it owned and wished to use for worship; its unregistered status made all its activities illegal. To protest a July 24, 2006, order by the Minsk City Economic Court to sell the church building to the city at a price far below market value and to vacate the premises by October 8, 2006, New Life Church members and sympathizers began a 23-day hunger strike, which prompted the authorities to review their decision. With the permission of Minsk local authorities, approximately 700 New Life Church parishioners and supporters rallied on Bangalore Square on October 21, 2006, to protest the forced sale. The case remained under consideration at the end of the reporting period.\n\nOn December 6, 2006, Grodno authorities granted permission for the Blessed Virgin Mary Mother of Mercy Roman Catholic community to build a church for its 8,000-member parish, which had been worshipping in a small wooden house that could accommodate only 300 persons. Twelve members of the church had launched a hunger strike on December 1, 2006, and continued it until authorities agreed to their request. The community first applied for permission to build a church in 1998.\n\nOn December 4, 2006, the Minsk Community of Krishna Consciousness (the Hare Krishnas) was forced out of its office in a vehicle service station following an inspection by the sanitary and emergency management authorities. The inspectors, however, allowed all other tenants to remain. The Minsk and Bobruysk Hare Krishna communities had searched for a legal address since being denied registration in 2004. They had attempted to register at the vehicle service station, but in November 2006 authorities denied the application.\n\nOn July 15, 2006, the Supreme Court rejected the appeal of Pastor Georgiy Vyazovskiy against the closure of his Christ Covenant Reformed Baptist Church. The Minsk City Court closed the church in May 2006 because the congregation had attempted to register at a residential building in violation of the law's mandate that all religious groups be registered at a \"legal\" address.\n\nA government decree specifies measures to ensure public order and safety during general public gatherings. Some meeting hall officials cited the decree as a basis for canceling or refusing to extend agreements with religious groups for the use of their facilities. During the reporting period it remained difficult, particularly for unregistered groups, to rent a public facility. Protestant communities suffered most from this decree, since they were less likely to own their own property and needed to rent public space when their members were too numerous to meet in private homes.\n\nOn June 25, 2007, the Minsk Tsentralniy District informed John the Baptist Church that it could not rent space at the state Trade Unions House, allegedly due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nBetween February 2006 and the end of the reporting period, the charismatic Living Word Church in Grodno tried at least seven times to rent meeting space, but state proprietors refused each attempt.\n\nOn December 28, 2006, State Ideology Officer Oleg Bobryk interrupted without explanation a seminar on family relationships held by a Protestant preacher at the Volozhyn Palace of Culture. Volozhyn authorities dismissed 15 Palace of Culture employees that same day. Vefil Evangelical Christian Baptist Pastor Sergey Yasku alleged the dismissals were an attempt by government officials to \"eliminate any cooperation of evangelical Christians with public organizations.\"\n\nThe Government restricted peaceful assembly for religious activities during the reporting period. On June 4, 2007, the Minsk City Executive Committee denied permission for the unregistered Belarus Christian Democracy party (BCD) to stage a June 8 rally protesting authorities' crackdown on freedom of conscience on Freedom Square. In April 2007 authorities similarly denied the BCD permission to stage a rally in support of religious freedom.\n\nThere were credible reports that local authorities and teachers sought to identify which children attended Baptist Sunday school. According to Forum 18, Baptist pastor Gennady Brutskiy alleged that children identified as having attended Baptist Sunday school were threatened by the head teacher. Similarly, Pastor Yasku claimed State Ideology Officer Bobryk demanded that teachers find out whether their students attended Protestant Sunday school. If children attended such a school, the teachers had to \"have a talk\" with their parents.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the Government monitored peaceful minority religious groups, especially those perceived as \"foreign\" or \"cults.\" Credible sources reported that state security officers often attended Protestant services to conduct surveillance.\n\nApproval for visits by foreign religious workers often involved a lengthy bureaucratic process. The law requires 1-year, multiple-entry \"spiritual activities\" visas for foreign missionaries and clergy. An organization inviting foreign clergy must make a written request to OPRRNA, including the proposed dates and reason for the requested visit. Even if the visit is for nonreligious purposes such as charitable activities, representatives must obtain a visa and permission from OPRRNA. OPRRNA has 20 days in which to respond, and there is no provision for appeal of its decision.\n\nObservers expressed concern that lack of uniform government guidance on implementation of February 2006 changes to visa laws affected the ability of missionaries to live and work in the country. Authorities frequently questioned foreign missionaries and humanitarian workers and the local citizens who worked with them about the sources and use of their funding. There were also credible reports that these foreign workers were followed and surveilled by security personnel.\n\nAccording to Forum 18, in September 2006 authorities refused Israeli citizen Rabbi Boruch Lamdan permission to conduct religious activity due to his alleged \"illegal commercial activity,\" although he was allowed to remain in the country. Rabbi Lamdan denied the allegations, stating that the refusal stemmed from his late tax payments on charitable donations that were sent to him personally. Lamdan departed the country in June 2007 after the Government did not renew his religious visa.\n\nIn July 2006 authorities denied permission for the unregistered Full Gospel Union to invite Nigerian pastor Anselm Madubuko to preach at three New Generation member churches. The authorities claimed that the group had \"no basis\" to invite him since it is unregistered and noted that they considered Madubuko's visit \"inexpedient\" given the New Generation's alleged \"violation of Belarusian law.\"\n\nThe Government does not permit foreign missionaries to engage in religious activity outside of their host institutions. Transferring between religious organizations, including parishes, requires prior state permission. For example, on October 13, 2006, authorities fined Polish citizen and Catholic priest Antoni Koczko $29 (62,000 rubles) for conducting an \"unauthorized\" religious service in Minsk, since he had been assigned to a church in Slutsk.\n\nInternal affairs agencies may compel the departure of foreign clergy by denying registrations and stay permits. Authorities may act independently or based on recommendations from other government entities.\n\nIn spring 2007 the founder/pastor of the Minsk-based New Testament Church and pastor of its Messianic Jewish congregation, an American citizen who had worked in the country for 10 years, was forced to leave the country. Authorities had refused to renew his work permit in spring 2006. In October 2006 authorities refused to renew visas for 12 Polish Catholic nuns and priests from the Grodno region who had been working in the country for more than 10 years, citing the need to provide local graduates of the Catholic seminaries with jobs. Despite hunger strikes, petitions, and protests by the Catholic community, the priests and nuns were told to leave the country by December 31, 2006.\n\nLegislation prohibits \"subversive activities\" by foreign organizations and the establishment of offices by foreign organizations whose activities incite \"national, religious, and racial enmity\" or could \"have negative effects on the physical and mental health of the people.\" On May 30, 2007, authorities fined Polish citizen Yaroslav Lukasik, an unofficial pastor of the John the Baptist Church, $15 (31,000 rubles) for conducting unauthorized religious services at a fellow pastor's home on May 27. At the same time, they issued him deportation papers for \"repeated violations of the regime governing the presence of foreigners,\" ordered him to leave the country by June 7, and barred him from reentry for 5 years. Lukasik denied the charges, stating that he had attended, not conducted, religious services on May 27. On May 8, 2007, authorities canceled Lukasik's residency permit due to his alleged involvement in \"activities aimed at causing damage to the national security.\" Lukasik appealed the fine and the deportation order to the local court, but the court denied the appeals on June 20 and June 27, respectively. Lukasik is married to a local citizen and has three local citizen children. Independent media reported that his family also appealed to a higher court in Minsk; however, authorities alleged that the papers related to the case were \"lost\" and could not be found before the statute of limitations for the appeal expired.\n\nForeign citizens officially in the country for nonreligious work can be reprimanded or expelled if they participate in religious activities.\n\nOn June 21, 2007, a Mogilyov judge overturned penalties involving seven U.S. citizens due to technical errors and sent the case back for a retrial. On February 16, 2007, the Government had deported the seven and banned them from the country for 2 years for two separate counts of illegal teaching and illegal religious activities. On February 13, the police charged the group with violating article 185 of the administrative code, \"Violation of Rules of Foreign Citizens' Stay in Belarus\" and fined them $15 (32,000 rubles) each for engaging in activities incompatible with the terms of their visas; according to the Government, the seven failed to obtain prior permission from the Education Ministry before they began teaching English at a house of worship in Mogilyov. The charges stemmed from a February 9 police raid on a church building; the results of the retrial were pending at the end of the reporting period.\n\nOn March 14, 2007, authorities canceled the residency permit of a U.S. Protestant humanitarian aid worker and deported him. Authorities claimed he was involved in activities \"aimed at causing damage to national security\" without explaining the alleged threat. The man had served as a charity worker and attended a Protestant church in Minsk.\n\nBaptist Union representative Gennadiy Brutskiy reported that authorities questioned a U.S. citizen who held a humanitarian work visa after he addressed a Bible college graduation ceremony in May 2006. In March 2007 authorities refused to renew the man's visa, forcing him to leave the country.\n\nBy law, citizens are not prohibited from proselytizing and may speak freely about their religious beliefs; however, in practice authorities often interfered with or punished some individuals who proselytized on behalf of registered or unregistered religious groups. Authorities regulated every aspect of proselytizing and literature distribution.\n\nThe Government continued to harass and fine Hare Krishnas for illegally distributing religious literature. In January 2007 authorities confiscated 14 books from a Hare Krishna and fined the person $15 (32,000 rubles) for illegally distributing religious material.\n\nOn June 12, 2007, police removed a sign that read \"I have the right to faith\" from a bridge in downtown Minsk within 90 minutes of its placement there by opposition activists.\n\nThe Government continued to use textbooks that promoted religious intolerance, especially toward \"nontraditional\" faiths. Leaders of Protestant communities criticized language in the textbook Basics of Home and Personal Security as discriminatory against Protestants, particularly the chapter entitled \"Beware of Sects.\" The chapter includes a paragraph informing students of such \"sects\" as Seventh-day Adventists, the Church of Maria, White Brotherhood, and Jehovah's Witnesses. The Ministry of Education continued to use the textbook Man, Society, and State, which labels Protestants and Hare Krishnas as \"sects,\" even after protests by religious groups. The authorities promised to change the language in the next edition of the books; neither book was republished by the end of the period covered by this report.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the Government took steps to \"warn\" the public of \"new\" groups and discouraged their growth. On June 15, 2007, the state newspaper Respublika published an article titled \"New Crusaders\" which compared contemporary Catholic missionary activities to the Crusades and characterized the involvement of Pope John Paul II in the fall of communism as a \"devilish enterprise,\" alleging collaboration with the CIA. The Polish community in the country denounced the article and called for criminal charges against its author and the newspaper's editor. Respublika later issued an apology. On December 12, 2006, Respublika urged government authorities to treat \"new\" religions with extreme caution because they might lead to tragedy and pose threats to society. The author alleged that new religions, including Scientology, Kabbalah, and Buddhism, are syncretic and do not teach their followers \"anything good.\"\n\nOn May 21, 2007, God's Grace Head Pastor Sergey Khomich received a letter from the state-controlled Lad television channel denying any wrongdoing in a May 12 broadcast in which a television host referred to the God's Grace community as a \"totalitarian and destructive sect.\" While broadcasting footage of a God's Grace prayer service and a conference, host Artyom Makhakeyev accused healers of swindling money out of sick people and warned that the wealthy \"frequently become the focus of sects' attention.\"\n\nOn December 8, 2006, the Government informed the New Life Church that it would not initiate a case against state-controlled Capital TV (STV). On October 14 and 15, 2006, STV made slanderous allegations against the unregistered Protestant group in a report entitled \"Strange Worshippers of a No Less Strange Religion.\" When STV would not retract its allegations, the New Life Church asked the authorities to open a criminal case against STV and to refute the station's allegations. The Government refused on the grounds that \"there was no sign of any crime in their actions.\"\n\nDespite the BOC's favored status, the Government also warned about the \"excessive influence\" of the BOC. President Lukashenko met with senior BOC bishops on December 21, 2006, to explain his \"pragmatic\" approach to the BOC after it complained about an article in a state newspaper by a presidential administration official that warned citizens against the BOC's influence and claimed that it weakens the impact of state ideology.\n\nThere were credible reports of government interference with religious travel. The Belarus-based Christian Human Rights House reported that on January 3, 2007, authorities stopped and searched a bus carrying approximately 40 young Catholics and Protestants at the Belarus-Poland border for approximately 5 hours. The group was returning to Belarus after a pilgrimage to Croatia.\n\nOn August 9, 2006, border guards took into custody and transported to Minsk 47 Baptist children and adults who were on a religious retreat at a private homestead in the western Grodno region for alleged violations of health and safety regulations. The previous day, local authorities had ordered the gathering to disperse and threatened to take the children to a police facility for juvenile delinquents and abandoned children. After their release, a senior Minsk religious affairs official publicly conceded that the retreat was legal since private individuals had organized the event. According to Forum 18, different government departments conducted up to four daily checks on a Baptist summer youth camp in the Brest region.\n\nLimited restitution of religious property occurred during the reporting period. There is no legal basis for restitution of property seized during the Soviet and Nazi occupations, and the law restricts the restitution of property being used for cultural or educational purposes. The Government did not return buildings if it had nowhere to move the current occupants. For example, most of the Jewish community's past requests for the return of Minsk synagogues, which were in use as theaters, museums, sports complexes, and a beer hall, were refused. However, during the reporting period Jewish communities did not request the return of buildings or other real estate.\n\nOn November 28, 2006, local authorities in Volozhyn threatened to rescind the Jewish community's rights to possess a restituted yeshiva building due to lack of renovation work. The Jewish community had started renovations on the yeshiva, which had been returned to the community in the 1990s, but ran out of funds before completing them. The authorities ultimately did not confiscate the 200-year-old building after a U.S.-based committee pledged in May 2007 to raise funds to finance the renovation.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, the St. Joseph Catholic community in Minsk continued a campaign for the Government to return former Bernardine church and monastery buildings, home to the state archives and slated to be converted into a hotel and entertainment center. The community has held regular prayer services at the site since first learning of reconstruction plans in 2004, but in March 2007 the Government announced new conversion plans, after which the community launched the petition drive. As of June 4, 2007, the petition had more than 10,000 signatures. Previously, the OPRRNA chairman said that since the Government did not have funds to construct new archive buildings, the church and monastery could not be handed back. On June 7, authorities prevented the community from gathering to pray, stating that they needed permission to assemble, but did not detain any worshippers. On June 16, approximately 90 persons gathered outside the church and lit candles while police watched.\n\nThe Government continued to abuse the religious freedom of several religious groups. As in the past, the most common charge against religious leaders was organizing or hosting an unauthorized meeting, a charge that arises from a law circumscribing freedom of assembly.\n\nThe law allows persons to gather to pray in private homes; however, it imposes restrictions on holding rituals, rites, or ceremonies in such locations and requires prior permission from local authorities. During the reporting period, Protestant and non-BOC Orthodox communities were fined or warned for illegally conducting religious services, carrying out unsanctioned religious activities, or illegally gathering without prior government permission.\n\nOn June 26, 2007, the Minsk Central District Court rejected a complaint by Antony Bokun, pastor of the registered John the Baptist Church, that police mistreated him following his arrest earlier in the month. On June 4, 2007, a Minsk District Court Judge sentenced Bokun to 3 days in prison for organizing an unauthorized religious service in his home on June 3. On that day, 10 officials raided Bokun's home during church services and took him and Polish Protestant pastor Yaroslav Lukasik to a police station. The police released Lukasik after a few hours but held Bokun overnight despite his cardiovascular condition. He became ill and needed medical attention. On June 27 and June 20, 2007, respectively, the Minsk City Court dismissed Bokun's appeals of a jail sentence and fine stemming from a separate incident. On May 28, the court had found Bokun guilty of conducting an illegal religious service and fined him $290 (620,000 rubles). Police officers had arrested Bokun on May 27 after entering his house and videotaping the service.\n\nOn May 8, 2007, police detained and warned youth activist Ivan Shutko that his participation in the campaign to prevent the Roman Catholic monastery in Minsk from being transformed into a hotel and casino might result in \"great problems.\"\n\nOn April 11, 2007, authorities issued an official warning to Sergey Nesterovich of the unregistered God's Transfiguration Brotherhood for regularly conducting illegal religious meetings in his apartment and collecting funds. In March 2007 KGB secret police had conducted a 3-hour raid of Nesterovich's apartment during a prayer meeting. The police searched the apartment, confiscated written materials, and questioned and photographed the attendees. Nesterovich appealed the warning, but authorities denied the appeal.\n\nIn December 2006 authorities issued Pastor Nikolay Borichevskiy of the Grace of Jesus Church in Krupki village a written warning for violating residence permit regulations; he ignored the warning and remained in Krupki. When Borichevskiy asked what had brought on the charge, the officials responded that his repeated criticism of the regime drew their attention.\n\nOn August 30, 2006, Union of Evangelical Christians Salvation Church (UECSC) pastor Sergey Poznyakovich was fined $2,170 (4.65 million rubles) for performing a baptism ceremony in a nearby lake. In July 2006 UECSC Bishop Nikolay Kurkayev was fined $75 (160,000 rubles) for holding an unauthorized religious service. On July 28, 2006, authorities fined New Life Church Pastor Vyacheslav Goncharenko $470 (1 million rubles) for having conducted an unsanctioned religious service earlier that month. During the previous reporting period, there were at least 13 reported instances of the Government imposing fines ranging from $13 to $2,600 (26,000 to 5.3 million rubles) for illegal religious activity.\n\nThere were no reports of forced religious conversion.\n\nThe number of individual anti-Semitic incidents increased during the reporting period. Anti-Semitism is tolerated by the state. Anti-Semitic acts were only sporadically investigated, and the Government allowed state enterprises to freely print and distribute anti-Semitic material.\n\nUnlike in previous reporting periods, state-owned periodicals did not attack Jewish religious groups; however, the sale and distribution of anti-Semitic literature through state press distributors, government agencies, and stores affiliated with the BOC continued. During the reporting period, anti-Semitic and Russian ultranationalist newspapers and literature, DVDs, and videocassettes continued to be sold at Pravoslavnaya Kniga (Orthodox Bookstore), which sells Orthodox literature and religious paraphernalia. The store was part of the Khristianskaya Initsiativa company, whose general director often wrote xenophobic articles. The store continued to distribute the anti-Semitic and xenophobic newspaper Russkiy Vestnik despite a 2003 order by the Prosecutor General and the Ministry of Information to remove copies from the store. The official BOC website honors Gavril Belostokskiy, a young child allegedly murdered by Jews near Grodno in 1690, as one of its saints and martyrs. A memorial prayer to be said on the anniversary of his death alleges the \"martyred and courageous\" Gavril \"exposed Jewish dishonesty.\" The book Demons on the Russian Land: Globalism as a Product of Evil, by Belarusian National Academy of Sciences (BNAS) researcher Valeriy Zelenevskiy, was also available at Pravoslavnaya Kniga. Published in Minsk at the end of 2006, the book contains numerous anti-Semitic statements, such as \"the Jews still adhere to pro-slavery views.\" Since the state-run BNAS approved publishing of the book, Jewish leaders and human rights activists considered the book to be a reflection of certain segments of the regime's ideology.\n\nSeveral Jewish religious sites were vandalized during the reporting period.\n\nOn June 28, 2007, local Jewish leaders reported that four gravestones in a Jewish cemetery were knocked down by vandals in Mogilyov earlier in the week. Relatives of those buried in the graves appealed to the police, one of whom theorized that the heavy tombstones may have been knocked down by a wind storm, despite the fact that there were no strong storms around the time of the incident.\n\nOn May 9, 2007, vandals set fire to flowers laid at the monument to the victims of the Brest Jewish ghetto. Police opened a criminal case but did not identify any suspects. This was the eighth act of vandalism at the monument since it was erected in 1992 and the third during this reporting period. In February 2007 vandals desecrated the monument, but no suspects were identified. On November 29, 2006, an explosion occurred at the same monument. The blast caused minor damage to the memorial. The Jewish community protested the local authorities' refusal to open a criminal investigation into the November incident, which police described as petty hooliganism. According to a local Jewish community leader, police were still investigating the February incident at the end of the reporting period.\n\nOn May 4, 2007, vandals drew a picture of a Star of David hanging from a gallows on the foundation of a bridge in Brest. The graffiti was removed not long after it appeared and the local Jewish community did not file a report with the police.\n\nOn March 1, 2007, independent media reported that vandals removed part of a metal plaque attached to a monument built on the site of an old Jewish cemetery in remembrance of the killing of the Minsk ghetto Bremen Jews. Also in early March 2007, a bronze memorial plaque on a residential building in central Minsk placed in remembrance of the killing of the Bremen Jews disappeared. An unidentified man claimed to have found the plaque and returned it to the Jewish community following announcements that the German ambassador would pay a $1,350 (2.9 million rubles) reward for the plaque's return. At the end of February 2007, vandals damaged the Star of David on a memorial plaque in Kurapaty honoring Jewish victims of Stalinism.\n\nOn May 3, 2007, police in Borisov opened a criminal case in connection with vandalism at the Jewish cemetery. Vandals had removed and damaged 16 tombstones at the end of April. The case remained open at the end of the reporting period; no suspects were identified.\n\nIn late February 2007, neo-Nazi activists attacked Larissa Shukailo, the head of the Mogilyov branch of the Belarusian Association for Victims of Political Repression. Two young persons threw a bottle at Shukailo, shouting \"Get away to your Israel!\" Shukailo filed a complaint with the authorities, but no suspects were identified by the end of the reporting period.\n\nOn November 12, 2006, vandals desecrated the Yama Holocaust memorial in central Minsk with white paint and swastikas. Despite a number of neo-Nazi anti-Semitic leaflets signed by the \"Belaya Rus Aryan Resistance Front\" found at the site, authorities dismissed the incident as a case of teenage hooliganism. The same day swastikas and \"Beat the Jews!\" graffiti were painted on the Israeli Information and Cultural Center. State-controlled STV's coverage of the vandal attacks referred to Jewish culture as \"alien to Belarus.\" Despite government officials' promises to prosecute offenders, on March 16, 2007, police closed the criminal cases, citing lack of suspects.\n\nIn early October 2006, unidentified vandals damaged a concrete fence surrounding a Jewish cemetery and destroyed 10 tombstones in the northern city of Orsha; 17 gravestones were vandalized at a Christian cemetery. Police refused to open criminal cases, calling the acts minor civil offenses.\n\nIn September 2006 vandals damaged five graves in an old Jewish cemetery in the eastern village of Sverzhan. Police opened an investigation, but no suspects were identified by the end of the reporting period.\n\nThe Jewish community continued to express concern over the concept of a \"greater Slavic union\" popular among nationalist organizations active in the country, including the Russian National Union (RNU), which still existed despite being officially dissolved in 2000. Throughout the reporting period, Jewish leaders petitioned the authorities to investigate neo-Nazi activities, citing continued vandalism, anti-Semitic graffiti, and threats to civil society and religious congregations. Authorities responded with empathetic letters but did not open any criminal cases in connection with these complaints.\n\nOn August 10, 2006, independent newspaper Vitebskiy Kuryer received a letter from the neo-Nazi group RNU threatening to close the newspaper if it continued publishing articles discrediting the Belarusian president and his policies aimed at making \"Slavonic nations superior in comparison with Jews.\" The letterhead contained the slogan \"To clean Russia!\" and a picture of a soldier holding a strangled man with the Star of David painted on his breast and U.S. dollars in his pocket. Law enforcement agencies did not investigate the threat, maintaining that since the RNU was not registered in the region, it was impossible to track down the letter's authors.\n\nThere have been some positive developments in respect for religious freedom.\n\nAuthorities granted the St. John the Baptist Catholic Community permission to build a church in Minsk and gave the community a plot of land for the building. Construction began on June 15, 2007. This was the first Catholic church to be built in Minsk since the 1917 Revolution.\n\nIn 2007 authorities returned a building in Grodno to the St. Pokrovskiy Orthodox Cathedral.\n\nIn August 2006 civil society activists in Orsha managed to save the remains of an 18th-century church. The activists sent letters and petitions to local government officials protesting the construction of a detention center on the site. In early August construction was suspended, and on August 31 officials agreed to alter the project in an effort to prevent the construction from damaging the church's foundation.\n\nOn July 20, 2006, the Prosecutor's Office repealed a warning to preschool teacher Lyudmila Izakson-Bolotovskaya for the \"illegal and deliberate dissemination of religious dogma to young children\" following her appeal. In April 2006 authorities had issued an official warning to Izakson-Bolotovskaya after she and her children's Jewish musical group were shown on local television celebrating a Jewish holiday at a state-run kindergarten. Authorities had claimed that she violated the law by holding a religious celebration in a government building and illegally propagated Judaism. Izakson-Bolotovskaya maintained that this was a cultural event for nonreligious educational purposes. The authorities forced Izakson-Bolotovskaya to remove \"Jewish symbols\" from the classroom and threatened her with future prosecution if she continued such activities. The group reconvened in September 2006 to continue studying Jewish history and traditions.\n\nOn July 5, 2006, President Lukashenko issued a directive to return the Holy Trinity Church (St. Roch Church) in Minsk and property inside to the Roman Catholic Church. For the previous 15 years, the church was used as the music hall for the Belarusian State Philharmonic Society.\n\nSeveral religious memorials were unveiled during the reporting period. Although most were privately funded, local government officials participated in most dedication ceremonies.\n\nWhile some members of society tried to promote religious freedom, societal abuses and discrimination based on religious beliefs occurred, and anti-Semitism and negative attitudes toward minority religious groups persisted.\n\nAs in previous years, unknown vandals destroyed crosses, both Orthodox and non-Orthodox, erected at Kurapaty, an area used by the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs to murder more than 300,000 people in the 1930s. In April 2007 vandals attacked the Stalin-era massacre memorial site at Kurapaty, knocking over and breaking six crosses. No criminal investigation took place by the end of the reporting period.\n\nOn May 30, 2007, unidentified burglars broke into the St. George Church in Vardomichy, stealing five icons. This was the latest in a string of unsolved church burglaries that resulted in the theft of 16 icons from 3 different churches in 2007. Police did not report any breakthroughs in their investigations of these crimes, which they attributed to a ring of experienced criminals.\n\nThere were several incidents of arson during the reporting period. On March 27, 2007, vandals set fire to the Roman Catholic St. Michael Church in Mozyr and drew satanic graffiti on the exterior walls. Ten days earlier, vandals broke a sculpture, crosses, and a window at the church. On March 28, police arrested four members of the satanic group Bloody Moon; the suspects remained in jail, and the investigation was ongoing at the end of the reporting period.\n\nOn December 25, 2006, vandals set fire to the Orthodox St. George Church in Mozyr, completely destroying its roof and interior walls. The remaining external walls were covered with graffiti. This was the second time the church had been set on fire in 6 weeks; on November 13, vandals drew satanic symbols on the outside of the church and set it on fire. The four members of the Bloody Moon satanic group who were detained for vandalizing the St. Michael Church in Mozyr pleaded guilty to setting fire to the St. George Church. They remained in police custody and the investigation was ongoing at the end of the reporting period.\n\nOn July 13, 2006, there was a suspicious fire at the Roman Catholic St. Francis Xavier (Farny) Church in Grodno. The fire destroyed part of the main altar and four 18th-century sculptures. Police opened a criminal case, but no further information was available at the end of the reporting period.\n\nSeveral cemeteries and burial grounds were attacked or damaged during the reporting period. On April 27, 2007, police charged a man with damaging historical property after five 10th- and 11th-century burial mounds were vandalized in Zaslavl on March 10 and 16, 2007. No further information was available by the end of the reporting period.\n\nOn February 13, 2007, police suspended a criminal investigation into a January 15, 2007, attack on a Muslim cemetery in Slonim that contains the graves of Russian Muslim soldiers killed in World War I due to failure to find suspects. Vandals overturned six gravestones, destroying two. This was the third attack on the cemetery since 1996.\n\nIndependent media reported that on November 20, 2006, unidentified vandals painted \"Don't Believe Sects!\" on a billboard in Baranovichi that directed persons to the Salvation Church, an affiliate of the Union of Evangelical Faith Christians in the Republic of Belarus. Officials and media opined that drunken teenagers might have been the vandals. The church claimed that this was an organized action.\n\nOn November 17, 2006, the New Life Church reported that police refused to institute criminal proceedings in connection with the defacing of their church on the night of October 31, 2006. Alleged members of the National Bolshevik Party, a Russian extremist group, splashed black paint on the church and painted in red \"No to Totalitarian Sects!\" and the party's symbol.\n\nDuring the reporting period, there were some positive actions undertaken by private actors to promote greater respect and tolerance among different religions and to promote religious freedom.\n\nOn June 18, 2007, the General Secretaries of Catholic Bishops' Conferences of Europe concluded a 4-day forum held in Minsk. It was the first time in the contemporary history of the country that the secretaries gathered in Minsk. They discussed migration, ecumenism, pastoral care, relations with Muslim communities, and the issues facing the Roman Catholic communities in the country, including difficulties with building new churches. On June 15, the secretaries had a successful meeting with BOC Head Metropolitan Philaret.\n\nOn May 28, 2007, BOC Head Metropolitan Philaret expressed support for the public organizing committee for the commemoration of the victims of Stalinist repressions.\n\nIn February 2007 Roma and Baptist communities worked together to provide the Roma population with gospels in Romany at no charge.\n\nOn April 19, 2007, the NGO Christian Human Rights House, in cooperation with the BCD, released \"Monitoring of the Violations of Christians' Rights in Belarus,\" which chronicled repression against Christians during 2006. Christian Human Rights House was created in the summer of 2006 to monitor religious freedom violations and to work to alleviate the repression of freedom of conscience in the country.\n\nOn June 17, 2007, more than 500 Protestant communities across the country gathered at churches to conduct prayer services calling for changes in the religion law that they see as discriminatory against Protestant congregations. On April 22, Christian communities, including Protestants and Catholics, some individual Orthodox priests, and the BCD launched a campaign to collect 50,000 signatures on a petition calling for the revocation of the 2002 law on religions and religious organizations. On May 8, the Belarusian Exarchate of the ROC urged believers not to sign the petition, claiming that the law helps maintain peace among religious communities and stability in the country. By the end of the reporting period, the campaign reported collecting thousands of signatures.\n\nOn June 4, 2007, independent news services reported that approximately 5,000 Protestants gathered at the Church of Grace in Minsk to pray for persecuted religious activists and for freedom of religion, including the right to pray in private homes. The crowd adopted an appeal to President Lukashenko requesting a review of the 2002 religion law and an end to the arrests of ministers.\n\n\n"}

The Republic of Colombia has an area of 439,735 square miles (1,138,908 square kilometers) and its population is estimated at 46 million. Although the Government does not keep official statistics on religious affiliation, a 2001 poll commissioned by the country's leading newspaper, El Tiempo, indicated that the religious demography is as follows:\n\n\nThe National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) does not collect religious statistics, and accurate reports are difficult to obtain. However, based on various studies and a survey, about 90% of the population adheres to Christianity, the majority of which (70.9%) are Roman Catholic, while a significant minority (16.7%) adhere to Protestantism (primarily Evangelicalism). Some 4.7% of the population is atheist or agnostic, while 3.5% claim to believe in God but do not follow a specific religion. 1.8% of Colombians adhere to Jehovah's Witnesses and Adventism and less than 1% adhere to other religions, such as Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Mormonism, Hinduism, Indigenous religions, Hare Krishna movement, Rastafari movement, Orthodox Catholic Church, and spiritual studies. The remaining people either did not respond or replied that they did not know. In addition to the above statistics, 35.9% of Colombians reported that they did not practice their faith actively. \n\nWhile Colombia remains a mostly Roman Catholic country by baptism numbers, the 1991 Colombian constitution guarantees freedom and equality of religion.\n\nThe Colombian Constitution of 1991 abolished the previous condition of the Roman Catholic Church as state church, and it includes two articles providing for freedom of worship:\n\n\nCurrently, there seem to be no social controversy or problem arising from religious conflict.

The money was used to established 200 Islamic colleges, 210 Islamic centers, 1500 mosques, and 2000 schools for Muslim children in Muslim and non-Muslim majority countries. \nThe schools were \"fundamentalist\" in outlook and formed a network \"from Sudan to northern Pakistan\". \nBy 2000 Saudi Arabia had also distributed 138 million copies of the Quran worldwide.\nIn the 1980s, religious attaches in the Kingdom's ~70 embassies around the world worked to \"get new mosques built in their countries and to persuade existing mosques to propagate the \"dawah wahhabiya\"\".\nThe Saudi Arabian government funds a number of international organizations to spread fundamentalist Islam, including the Muslim World League, the World Assembly of Muslim Youth, the International Islamic Relief Organization, and various royal charities. Supporting proselytizing or preaching of Islam (\"da'wah\"), has been called \"a religious requirement\" for Saudi rulers that cannot be abandoned \"without losing their domestic legitimacy\" as protectors and propagators of Islam.\n\nIn the words of journalist Scott Shane, \"when Saudi imams arrived in Muslim countries in Asia or Africa, or in Muslim communities in Europe or the Americas, wearing traditional Arabian robes, speaking the language of the Quran — and carrying a generous checkbook — they had automatic credibility.\"\n\nIn addition to the Wahhabi interpretation of Islam, other strict and conservative interpretations of Sunni Islam directly or indirectly assisted by funds from Saudi Arabia and Arab states of the Persian Gulf include those of the Muslim Brotherhood and Jamaat-e-Islami Islamist organizations. Wahhabism and forms of Islamism are said to have formed a \"joint venture\", sharing a strong \"revulsion\" against western influences, a belief in strict implementation of injunctions and prohibitions of sharia law, an opposition to both Shiism and popular Islamic religious practices (the cult of `saints`), and a belief in the importance of armed jihad.\n\nLater the two movements are said to have been \"fused\", \nor formed a \"hybrid\", particularly as a result of the of the 1980s against the Soviet Union, and resulted in the training and equipping of thousands of Muslims to fight against Soviets and their Afghan allies in Afghanistan in the 1980s. (The alliance was not permanent and the Muslim Brotherhood and Osama bin Laden broke with Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War. Revivalist groups also disagreed among themselves -- Salafi Jihadi groups differing with the less extreme Muslim Brotherhood, for example.)\n\nThe funding has been criticized for promoting an intolerant, fanatical form of Islam that allegedly helped to breed terrorism. \nCritics argue that volunteers mobilized to fight in Afghanistan (such as Osama bin Laden) and \"exultant\" at their success against the Soviet superpower, went on to fight Jihad against Muslim governments and civilians in other countries. And that conservative Sunni groups such as the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan are attacking and killing not only non-Muslims but fellow Muslims they consider to be apostates, such as Shia and Sufis.\n\nAccording to Hind Fraihi, a Moroccan-Belgian journalist, Saudi-trained imams and literature from Saudi Arabia glorifying jihad and advocating Islam versus non-Muslims thinking was “part of the cocktail” (other factors being \"economic frustration, racism, a generation that feels it has no future”) leading to the ISIL terror cell in Belgium committing terrorist acts in Paris and Brussels in 2015 and 2016. (Altogether 162 people were killed in the attacks.) .\nIn the capital Brussels, as of 2016, 95 percent of the courses offered on Islam for Muslims used preachers trained in Saudi Arabia, according to European Network Against Racism. In February 2017 the Belgium Coordination Unit for Threat Analysis (OCAD/OCAM, which evaluates terrorist and extremist threats in and to Belgium) voiced concerns over the spread of Saudi-backed Wahhabism in Belgium and the rest of Europe, stating “An increasing number of mosques and Islamic centres in Belgium are controlled by Wahhabism. This is the Salafist missionary apparatus.”\n\nA 2017 proposal to construct a large mosque in Helsinki to \"unite all Finnish Muslims\", has met with resistance from among others the incoming mayor of the capital (Jan Vapaavuori). This was because it is being funded by Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and may introduce \"Sunni-Shia hate politics into Finland\", as both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia are Sunni ruled and have cracked down on Shia protestors.\n\nThe German government has expressed concern that religious organizations from the Middle East may be supporting German Salafists through the construction of mosques, training facilities, and the utilization of radical preachers. A large number of radical mosques in Germany have reportedly been funded by Saudi investors. Angela Merkel has raised this matter directly with the Saudis.\n\nIn Reykjavík, the capital of Iceland where plans to build a new, larger mosque had been under way for more than a decade, there has been controversy over funding of the mosque. Following the 2015 Paris terror attacks, the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson announced that he was \"shocked to the point of paralysis\" to learn from Saudi Arabian Ambassador, that Saudi Arabia planned to donate $1 million to the building of a mosque. Grímsson expressed concern that Saudi Arabian financing of the mosque would fuel radical Islam in Iceland.\n\nAccording to a report by Anthony Glees, extremist ideas being spread allow with donations from Saudi and Arab Muslim sources to British universities. Eight universities, \"including Oxford and Cambridge\", accepted \"more than £233.5 million from Saudi and Muslim sources\" from 1995 to 2008, \"with much of the money going to Islamic study centres\".\n\nA 2012 article in Arab News reportedOver the past decade, Saudi Arabia has been the largest source of donations from Islamic states and royal families to British universities, much of which is devoted to the study of Islam, the Middle East and Arabic literature.\nA large share of this money went toward establishing Islamic study centers. In 2008, Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal donated £8 million (SR 48.5 million) each to Cambridge and Edinburgh for this purpose, \"Al Eqtisadiah\" business daily reported yesterday.\nOxford has been the largest British beneficiary of Saudi support. In 2005, Prince Sultan, the late crown prince, gave £2 million (SR 12 million) to the Ashmolean Museum. In 2001, the King Abdul Aziz Foundation gave £1 million (SR 6.1 million) to the Middle East Center.\nThere are many other donors. Oxford’s £75 million (SR 454.6 million) Islamic Studies Center was supported by 12 Muslim countries. Ruler of Oman, Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said, gave £3.1 million (SR 18.8 million) to Cambridge to fund two posts, including a chair of Arabic.\nRuler of Sharjah [in the UAE], Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi, has supported Exeter’s Islamic studies center with more than £5 million (SR 30 million) since 2001. Trinity Saint David, part of the University of Wales, has received donations from the ruler of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.\n\nIn June 2017, following the London Bridge terror attack, opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn stated that the \"difficult conversations\" Prime Minister Theresa May called for should start with \"Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states that have funded and fuelled extremist ideology\".\n\nA July 2017 report by the Henry Jackson Society, commissioned by the government of the UK, stated that Middle Eastern nations are providing financial support to mosques and Islamic educational institutions, which have been linked to the spread of extremist material with \"an illiberal, bigoted Wahhabi ideology\". The report said that the number of Salafi and Wahhabi mosques in Britain had increased from 68 in 2007 to 110 in 2014.\n\nHistorically parts of the Balkans were introduced to Islam while under the domination of the Ottoman Empire and have majority or large minority Muslim populations. The fall of Communism and breakup of Yugoslavia, provided an opportunity for international Islamic charities to Islamization (or re-Islamization) people who had been living under an irreligious Communist government. Islamic charities—often with the backing of oil-rich Gulf kingdoms—built mosques and madrassas in Albania and other Balkan countries. In Bosnia, Wahhabism is being established particularly in the remote villages. In Kosovo, Wahhabism is being freely preached and supported by the Saudi government.\n\nA Muslim majority country, Albania had been under anti-clerical communist control for 45 years when the Eastern bloc fell in 1991. The pro-Islamic Democratic Party was elected to power in 1992, and the government of Sali Berisha \"turned to Saudi Arabia for financial support,\" and for assistance in \"re-Islamizing\" the country. Thirty NGOs and Islamic associations worked toward re-Islamization of Albania, including thirteen of the organizations formed a `Coordination Council of Arab Foundations.` Saudi Arabia sponsored `Al Haramein` and `Musafaq` (which were based in Britain) foundations which \"vied\" with Islamic organizations from Libya, Sudan, Iran and Turkey in \"instumentalization of humanitarian aid as a means of proselytization.\" At least the Saudi and Sunni Islamist groups preached for creation of an Islamic society \"based principally on Wahhabism.\" Saudi NGOs built 200 mosques and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia donated one million copies of an Albanian language version of the Quran.\n\nAccording to Olivier Roy and Antoine Sfeir, the \"organized project undertaken by preachers and Islamic NGOs\" was to \"expunge indigenous Albanian ideas about Islam, before replacing it with a version of the faith more in conformity with the Wahhabi model. ... Islam in its most radical form was taught as the only true faith, while tolerance was seen as an indication of weakness. ... Hatred of the West was raised to the status of a creed.\"\n\nOne of the first Islamists to come to Albania was Muhammad al Zawahiri, (the brother of Ayman al Zawahiri, the leader of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad movement and Osama Bin Laden's key lieutenant) as an accountant for the International Islamic Relief Organization (IIRO). (Unbeknownst to Albanians, in addition to helping with relief and spreading correct Islam, IIRO was charged with the task of helping other members of Islamic Jihad find jobs within \"charitable organizations building mosques, orphanages and clinics.\" By the mid-1980s, the Tirana cell of Islamic Jihad numbered 16 members, including a specialist in false identity documents, a recruit wanted on suspicion of involvement in the attempted assassination. This was later exposed during an investigation carried out by the American and Albanian secret services, In June 1998 three Egyptian Islamist accused of terrorist activities were arrested in Albania, with further arrests in September after the 1998 United States embassy bombings. )\n\nHow successful the proselytizing has been is unclear. Roy and Sfeir believe that with NGO work in the 1990s \"Islamists gained an important foothold\", however, a 2012 Pew Research study found that only 15% of Muslims surveyed considered religion \"a very important factor\" in their lives—the lowest percentage in the world amongst countries with significant Muslim populations.\n\nDuring the 1992-1995 Bosnian War, the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina (where the approximately 43% of the population that was Muslim formed the largest religious group) received aid from Saudi groups — International Islamic Relief Organization, Saudi High Commission for Relief, Muwaffaq Foundations — as well as from non-Saudi Islamic groups. A 1996 report by the CIA stated that \"all of the major and most of the minor Islamic charities are significant players in the former Yugoslavia\", particularly in aiding Bosnian Muslims, delivering food, clothing, and medicine; supporting orphanages, schools, hospitals, agricultural, and refugee camps; and constructing housing, infrastructure. According to the Saudi Embassy to the US, the Saudi Joint Committee for Collection of Donations for Bosnia donated $500 million in aid to Muslims for medical care, refugee camps, education during the Bosnian War, and later reconstruction projects for mosques and religious schools.\nIn just one year (1994) Saudi nationals alone gave $150 million through Islamic NGOs for aid to Bosnia. However, a \"growing body of reporting indicates that some of these charities are being used to aid Islamic extremist groups that engage in terrorism.\"\n\nAid to the local Bosnian Islamist party (the SDA) gave it leverage to undermined competing local secular and more traditional Muslim groups. The SDA prohibited consumption of alcohol and pork, \"brought Muslim religious instruction into the schools, opened up prayer rooms, and used the leverage of its distribution of aid to pressurize the population to adopt Muslim names, to wear the veil, and grow beards.\" A 1992 conference on the protection of human rights in Bosnia brought together representatives from 30 Muslims countries. It passed resolutions declaring \"without ambiguity that the aim of the Bosnian conflict was the extermination of Bosnia's Muslims.\"\n\n\"Afghan Arab\" veterans fighting Serbs in Bosnia as volunteers took upon themselves \"Hisbah\" (\"enjoin good and forbid wrong\") including attempting to impose the veil on women and the beard on men. In addition they engaged in \ncausing disturbances in the ceremonies of [Sufi] brotherhoods they deemed to be deviant, ... smashing up cafes, and ... [organizing] sharia marriages to Bosnian girls that were not declared to the civil authorities. \nRather than spreading strict Islamic practice, these activities were so unpopular with the Bosnian public and media they were condemned by the SDA. According to Gilles Kepel, as of 2003, the only thing left of their presence were \"a few naturalized Arab subjects married to Bosnian women.\"\n\nFrom the end of the Bosnian War to 2007, Saudi-financed organizations spent about $700 million in Bosnia, \"often in mosques\", according to analysts quoted by the New York Times. \"More than half a dozen new madrasas\", (religious secondary schools), have been built throughout the country, as have dozens of mosques. In the capital and largest city Sarajevo, Saudi Arabia financed the King Fahd Mosque, a $28 million complex including a sports and cultural center. According to a former Bosnian intelligence agent (Goran Kovacevic) interviewed by a public television network in the US, (PBS), the mosque is well financed and \"the most radical mosque in the whole Bosnia-Herzegovina. ... All those guys that actually performed some kind of terrorist activity in Bosnia-Herzegovina were part of that mosque\". In October 2008, eight people were injured when men in hoods attacked participants at a gay festival in Sarajevo, dragging some people from vehicles and beating others while they chanted, “Kill the gays!” and “Allahu Akbar!”\n\nWahhabi aid organizations also physically influenced Bosnian religious culture following the war. Saudis have helped restore some of the hundreds of mosques and monuments Serb nationalist forces destroyed during the war. While this assistance was badly needed, it involved removing the Islamic calligraphy that adorned many Balkan Muslim tombstones, which Wahhabis considered idolatrous and unIslamic. Critics complain that the graveyards were \"often all that was left\" of the local Bosnian heritage, and Wahhabis took advantage of Bosnian's desperation.\n\nOne country where Saudi Arabia has been particularly successful in spreading strict and conservative Wahhabism where once tolerant local Islam held sway is Kosovo. \nFollowing the NATO bombing campaign of 1999 that helped Muslim Kosovo gain independence from Orthodox Christian Serbia, the Saudi government \nand private sources began to provide aid. \nSaudi citizens donated $20 million to Kosovo in cash as well as food and medical supplies, and the Saudi Red Crescent sent medical volunteers. \nThe Saudi Joint Committee for Collection of Donations for Kosovo and Chechnya sent $45 million for humanitarian relief services (medical care, refugee camps, education, and later reconstruction of mosques and schools) to Kosovo according to the Embassy of Saudi Arabia in the US.\n\n240 mosques have been built in Kosovo since the 1999 war. The Saudi Joint Committee for Relief of Kosovo and Chechnya built approximately 100 mosques in rural areas, some with Quranic schools adjacent, and sent 388 foreign teachers to spread \"their interpretations of Islam\".\n\nSaudi-sponsored charities sponsored education, classes not only in religion but English and computers, often paying salaries and overhead costs. Families were given monthly stipends. All this was appreciated in the \"poor and war ravaged\" country but local Kosovar imams complained that stipends were given \"on the condition that they attended sermons in the mosque and that women and girls wore the veil\". “People were so needy, there was no one who did not join,” according to one Kosovo politician (Ajnishahe Halimi).\n\nAccording to a critical article by journalist Carlotta Gall, \ncorps of extremist clerics and secretive associations funded by Saudi Arabia and other conservative Arab countries in the Persian Gulf region using an obscure, labyrinthine network of donations from charities, private individuals and government ministries ... [They] transformed this once-tolerant Muslim society at the hem of Europe into a font of Islamic extremism and a pipeline for jihadists.\nConservatives came to dominate the Islamic Community of Kosovo, the national Islamic organization.\n\nPart of the Wahhabi influence can be found in more strict practices, such as the refusal by some women to shake hands with or talk to male relatives. But threats — or acts — of violence against academics, journalists and politicians have also occurred. One imam in the city of Gjilan, Enver Rexhepi, was \"abducted and savagely beaten by masked men\" in 2004 after clashing with a Saudi trained student (Zekirja Qazimi) over whether to continue the long-standing practice of displaying the Albanian flag in his (Rexhepi's) mosque. (Qazimi believed the depiction of the dragon on the flag idolatrous.)\nKosovo also had \"the highest number\" of Muslims per capita of any country in Europe leave to fight for ISIL in the two years from 2014-2016. Kosovar police have identified 314 people who have left Kosovo to join the Islamic State, \"including two suicide bombers, 44 women and 28 children\".\n\nAfter two Muslims from Kosovo killed themselves in suicide bombings in Iraq and Turkey, Kosovo intelligence began an investigation of \"sources of radicalism.\" The Saudi charity Al Waqf al Islami and twelve other Islamic charities were shut down, and 40 people arrested.\n\nSaudi aid has also affected the architecture of Islam in Kosovo, leading to the dismantling of centuries-old Ottoman mosques whose ornamentation was offensive to Wahhabism, including the Hadim Suleiman Aga mosque and Library in Djakovica, Kosovo. \nAmong the destroyed buildings are \"a historic library in Gjakova and several 400-year-old mosques, as well as shrines, graveyards and Dervish monasteries\".\n\nAccording to Carlotta Gall, as of 2016 \"Kosovo Central Bank figures show grants from Saudi Arabia averaging €100,000 a year for the past five years\", a reduction from the decade earlier, (although payments can be diverted through another country\" to obscure their origin and destination\"). Picking up the slack in financing \"hard-line\" Islam have been Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates — each of which average \"approximately €1 million a year\" in donations.\n\nAlthough the majority Catholic country has an Islamic population of roughly only 0.1%, it's indigenous Muslim population of Lipka Tatars (1,916 per 2011 census) only nominally adheres to Sunni Islam. However, together with an immigration of refugees and foreign students from Muslim majority countries, the ideology of Wahhabism/Salafism started taking roots in the country, whilst coming in conflict with the Tatar's tolerant and inclusive view of the faith. A Saudi donor Shaykh Abdullatif al Fozan (ranked 51 in 2013 on the Forbes' list of richest Arabs) sponsored (4,000,000 euro) the construction of the \"Center of a Muslim Culture\" in Warsaw. The building is fully equipped; has a store, a restaurant, library, prayer hall and even a gym. While officially promoting (Sunni) Islam, the Center spreads Wahhabism/Salafism. Originally, it was meant to be built as a \"Centre of Arabic Studies\" adjacent to the University of Warsaw, but the University's staff refused the offer due to the Saudi funding and the Wahhabi message it would propagate.\n\nSaudi leaders have endeavoured to influence, trade, resources in Sudan, Kenya and Ethiopia which has also resulted in a regional rivalry between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shia Muslim Iran. The spread of Wahhabism, is a, \"key concern of the west, and of many local players as well\".\n\nSudan, a poor country with a majority Muslim Arab population whose coastline lies just across the Red Sea from the Hijaz province of Saudi Arabia, has had close relations with the kingdom since the Arab Oil Embargo. However, the dominant interpretation of Islam in Sudan was very different from that of Saudis or Muslim Brotherhood. Traditional popular Islam of the Sufi or mystical brotherhoods (the Ansar and the Khatmiya) who were each attached to a political party, had great influence among the masses of Muslims. Saudi funding, investment, and labor migration from Sudan has all worked over time to change that.\n\nSaudi provided funding for the Muslim Brotherhood whose local leader, Hassan al-Turabi, enjoyed \"close relations\" with \"some of the more conservative members of the Saudi royal family\".\n\nIn the fall of 1977, an Islamic bank with 60% of its start up capital coming from Saudi Arabia opened a branch in Sudan. By the mid-1980s this bank (Faisal Islamic Bank of Sudan) was second biggest in Sudan in terms of money held on deposit. Shortly after another similar bank (Al Baraka Bank) was founded. Both provided rewards for whose affiliated with Hassan al-Turabi's Islamist National Islamic Front—employment and wealth as a reward for young militant college graduates and low interest loans for investors and businessmen unable to find loans elsewhere.\n\nIn 1983 Saudis persuaded then-President Gaafar Nimeiry to institute sharia law including interest-free Islamic banking. The traditional Sudanese banking system was abolished and afterwards\nany enterprise that needed capital had to be part of Turabi's network to gain access to financial markets. Over time, this has concentrated economic power in the old families from the \"Three Tribes\" who were loyal to the new regime\"and who have \"transformed themselves into Islamists.\"\n\nThe influx of Sudanese labor migrants to Saudi as truck drivers, electricians, factory workers and sales clerks, was also significant. By 1985, according to one source, about 2/3 of the professional and skilled Sudanese workers were employed outside the Sudan, many in the Gulf States. (As of 2013 there were 900,000 Sudanese migrant workers in Saudi Arabia.)\n\nLooking at the change in religious practices of a village in northern Sudan over a five-year period from 1982 to 1988, anthropology researcher Victoria Bernal found labor migration of villagers to Saudi Arabia \"were catalysts for change, stimulating the rise of `fundamentalist` Islam in the village\". Returning migrants \"boldly\" critiqued the Islamic authenticity of local practices such as \"mourning rituals, wedding customs and reverence for holy men in particular.\" More well-to-do villagers were \"building high brick or cement walls around their homes\", women began wearing ankle-length robes. Traditional wedding rituals with singing and mixing of genders were called into question.\n\n\"Adopting fundamentalist practices\" had become a \"way to assert one’s sophistication, urbanity and material success.\" Migrant workers also formed connections with, and helped finance, the Muslim Brotherhood affiliated National Islamic Front political party which could remit their salaries back home to families in Sudan evading taxation in exchange for a percentage (that was less than the taxation). Saudi helped found the African Islamic Center (later the International University of Africa) to help train African Muslim preachers and missionaries \"with the Salafist view of Islam.\"\n\nAs Hassan al-Turabi and his National Islamic Front grew in influence and in 1989 a coup d'état by Omar al-Bashir against an elected government negotiating to end the war with the animist and Christian South established Sudan as the first Sunni Islamist state. Al-Turabi became the \"power behind the throne\" of the al-Bashir government from 1989-1999. The revivalist tenure in power was not as successful as its influence on banking or migrant workers. International organizations alleged war crimes, ethnic cleansing, a revival of slavery, torture of opponents, an unprecedented number of refugees fleeing country, and Turabi and allies were expelled from power in 1999. The jihad in the south ended unsuccessfully with the south seceding from Sudan (forming South Sudan) taking with it nearly all of Sudan's oil fields. Turabi himself reversed earlier Islamist positions on marriage and inequality in favor of liberal positions, leading some conservatives to call him an apostate. Al Jazeera estimates that as of 2012 10% of Sudanese are tied to Salafi groups, (more than 60% of Sudanese are affiliated with Sufism), but that number is growing.\n\nMuslim Brethren who became wealthy in Saudi Arabia became key contributors to Egypt's Islamist movements. Many of Egypt's future \"ulama\" attended the Islamic University of Madinah in Saudi which was established as an alternative to the Egyptian government-controlled Al-Azhar University in Cairo. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy, who later became the grand mufti of Egypt, spent four years at the Islamic University. Tantawy demonstrated his devotion to the kingdom in a June 2000 interview with the Saudi newspaper Ain al-Yaqeen, where he blamed the \"violent campaign\" against Saudi human rights policy on the campaigners' antipathy towards Islam. \"Saudi Arabia leads the world in the protection of human rights because it protects them according to the \"sharia\" of God.\"\n\nSaudi funding to Egypt's al-Azhar center of Islamic learning, has been credited with causing that institution to adopt a more religiously conservative approach.\n\nPolitical Islam and/or salafist \"Islamic revivalism\" became dominant and the indigenous \"popular\" or Sufi Islam found in much of North Africa greatly weakened, in large part because of the 1954-1962 Algerian War—despite the fact the victorious National Liberation Front (FLN) was interested in socialism and Arab nationalism, not political Islam.\n\nDiminishing indigenous Islam was the dismantling of Sufi mystical brotherhoods and the confiscation and redistribution of their land in retaliation for their lack of support for the FLN during the fight against the French. Strengthening revivalism was a campaign of Arabization and Islamization by the government (FLN) to suppress the use of the French language (which was still dominant in higher education and the professions), to promote Algerian/Arab identity over residual French colonial culture. To do this Egyptians were recruited by the Algerian state to Arabize and de-Frenchify the school system. Like Saudi Arabia, Algeria saw an influx of Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood members hired to teach Arabic and eager to escape government suppression. While the leftist FLN Algerian government was totally uninterested in Islam as a foundation for conducting worldly affairs (as opposed to building a national identity), the Muslim Brotherhood teachers very much were, and many of the generation of \"strictly Arabphone teachers\" trained by the Brothers adopted the beliefs of their teachers and went on to form the basis of a \"Islamist intelligentsia\".\n\nIn addition, in the 1980s, as interest in Islam grew and devotion to the ruling National Liberation Front (FLN) party and secular socialism waned in Algeria, the government imported two renowned Islamic scholars, Mohammed al-Ghazali and Yusuf al-Qaradawi, to \"strengthen the religious dimension\" of the \"nationalist ideology\" of the FLN. This was less than successful as the clerics supported \"Islamic awakening\", were \"fellow travelers\" of the Muslim Brotherhood, supporters of Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf monarchies, and had little interest in serving the secularist FLN government.\n\nAlso in the 1980s, several hundred youth left Algeria for the camps of Peshawar to fight jihad in Afghanistan. As the FLN government was a close ally of the jihadists' enemy, the Soviet Union, these fighters tended to consider the fight against the Soviets a \"prelude\" to jihad in Algeria.\n\nWhen the FLN followed the example of post-Communist Eastern European government and held elections in 1989, the main beneficiary was the massively popular Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) political party which sought to establish sharia law in Algeria. \"Islamist intelligentsia\" formed its leadership, FIS second in command, Ali Belhadj, was a state school teacher and a prime example or this. The Saudis supporting the party, and the Front's other co-leader Abbassi Madani received much aid from Saudi Arabia and other oil monarchies. (This did not prevent him from coming out in support of Sadam Hussein—along with most other Islamists—when Saddam invaded Kuwait, despite the adamant fear of and opposition to Saddam Hussein by the Gulf oil states.)\n\nAfter the FLN saw how unpopular it was and canceled the elections, a bloody civil war broke out. The Salafist-jihadis returning to Algeria supported the FIS and later provided military skill in the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria (GIA).\n\nThe Algerian Civil War ended badly with an estimated 200,000 Algerians, many of them civilians, killed. FIS did not recover from the war, but by 2002 another strict/conservative Islamic force—Salafism—began to emerge. To end the war, the government needed help disarming the Islamists fighters and were able to enlist the Salafis—apolitical and nonviolent—as a religious counterweight and to use their religious influence to persuade the Islamists to stop fighting. In return the government has shown tolerance towards the Salafis. Culturally, as of 2010 Salafis have exerted \"a growing influence over society and how people dress, deal with the state and do business\" in Algeria. Their putative quietism notwithstanding they have protested a government plan to make women remove their headscarves for passport photographs, pressuring shopkeepers to stop selling tobacco and alcohol. In June 2010, a group of Salafist clerics attending an official function along with the minister of religious affairs showed their rejection of modern political systems as an illegitimate innovation or \"bid‘ah\" by refusing to stand for the national anthem. Salafist Sheikh Abdelfettah Zeraoui explains criticism of Salafism as the work of Western powers who have pressured Muslim governments \"to crack down on the Salafi current because it represents the pure Islam.\" The Salafis connection with Saudi Arabia includes Saudi Grand Mufti, Sheikh Abdul-Aziz al-Sheikh who has endorsed opposition to international regulations requiring photographs for passports show a person's forehead and ears even if they are a woman. Abdelmalek Ramdani—the most prominent Salafist imam in Algeria—lives in Saudi Arabia, and prominent Salafist preachers—including Ali Ferkous, Azzedine Ramdani and Al Eid Cherifi—received religious training in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Izala Society—a Wahhabi missionary group established 1978—has become one of the largest Islamic societies in Nigeria, Chad, Niger, and Cameroon. Izala is funded by Saudi Arabia and led by the World Muslim League. It fights what it sees as the \"bid’a\", (innovation), practiced by the Sufi brotherhoods, specifically the Qadiri and Tijan Sufi orders. It is very active in education and Da‘wa (propagation of the faith) and in Nigeria has many institutions all over the country and is influential at the local, state, and even federal levels.\n\nScholar Vitaliĭ Vi͡acheslavovich Naumkin argues that even before the fall of Communism, Saudi Arabia had substantial influence on Islam in Central Asia because of its prestige as the location of the holy places of Hejaz, its financial resources and because of the large number of Central Asian pilgrims (and their descendants) who had gone to Saudi on hajj and decided to stay.\n\nDuring the Soviet–Afghan War, thousands of Soviet Central Asians were drafted into the Soviet Army to fight their co-religionists (and sometimes fellow ethics), the Afghan Mujahideen. As Islam and Central Asian peoples had been repressed by the Soviets—often brutally—many were \"deeply affected by the dedication\" of their putative enemies. \"Hundreds of Uzbek and Tajik Muslims travelled secretly to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to study in madrasahs or to train as guerrilla fighters against the Soviets in Afghanistan.\" Many of these were influenced by the idea of armed jihad taught at Deobandi madrasahs in Pakistan where \"places specifically for Central Asian radicals, who arrived without passports or visas and received a free education and a living allowance.\" Wahhabism also made headway thanks to Saudi funding and Saudi-trained preachers.\nIn the late 1980s, as the same time the Soviets were starting to withdraw from Afghanistan there was \"an explosion of interest\" in Islam in Central Asia. \"Thousands of mosques were built, Qurans and other Islamic literature were brought in from Saudi Arabia and Pakistan and distributed free among the population.\"\n\nIn Central Asia the term \"Wahhabism\" has evolved from its original meaning of followers of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, to become 'agitprop invective' and a ‘polemic foil in sectarian arguments' used against Islamic \"reformists and ‘troublesome Muslim opponents’\", or even against \"any and all expressions of nontraditional Islam’.\n\nSaudi and Islamist forces helped the Afghan Mujahideen in their struggle against the Soviets, with Saudi Arabian government providing approximately $4 billion in aid to the mujahidin from 1980-1990.\nSaudi Arabia and other Arab states of the Persian Gulf became \"important backers\" for Islamic schools (\"madrassas\") for Afghan refugees in Pakistan which appeared in the 1980s near the Afghan-Pakistan border. In 1988, the Muslim World League stated that it had opened 150 Quran study centers and 85 Islamic schools for Afghan refugee students in Peshawar, a short distance across the border in Pakistan.\n\nMany were radical schools sponsored by the Pakistan JUI religious party and became \"a supply line for jihad\" in Afghanistan. According to analysts the ideology of the schools became \"hybridization\" of the Deobandi school of the Pakistani sponsors and the Salafism supported by Saudi financers.\n\nMany of the Taliban were graduates of these schools. (Eight Taliban government ministers came from one school, Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqania.) While in power, the Taliban implemented the \"strictest interpretation of Sharia law ever seen in the Muslim world.\"\n\nAfter the Taliban came to power the Saudis helped them in a number of ways. Saudi Arabia was one of only three countries (Pakistan and United Arab Emirates being the others) officially to recognize the Taliban as the official government of Afghanistan before the 9/11 attacks, (after 9/11 no country recognized it). King Fahd of Saudi Arabia “expressed happiness at the good measures taken by the Taliban and over the imposition of shari’a in our country,\" During a visit by the Taliban’s leadership to the kingdom in 1997.\n\nSaudi Wahhabism practices, influenced the Taliban. One example was the Saudi religious police, according to Rashid. \n`I remember that all the Taliban who had worked or done hajj in Saudi Arabia were terribly impressed by the religious police and tried to copy that system to the letter. The money for their training and salaries came partly from Saudi Arabia.` The taliban also practiced public beheadings common in Saudi Arabia. Ahmed Rashid came across ten thousand men and children gathering at Kandahar football stadium one Thursday afternoon, curious as to why (the Taliban had banned sports) he \"went inside to discover a convicted murderer being led between the goalposts to be executed by a member of the victim's family.\" \n\nThe Taliban's brutal treatment of Shia Muslims, and the destruction of Buddhist statues in Bamiyan Valley may also have been influenced by Wahhabism, which had a history of attacking and takfiring Shia, while prior to this attack Afghan Sunnis had never persecuted their Shia minority. (see Abdur Rahman Khan and 1888–1893 Uprisings of Hazaras).\n\nAnother activity Afghan Muslims had not engaged in before this time was destruction of statues. In 2001, the Taliban dynamited and rocketed the nearly 2000-year-old statues Buddhist Bamiyan Valley, which had been undamaged by Afghan Sunni Muslim for centuries prior to then. Mullah Omar declared \"Muslims should be proud of smashing idols. It has given praise to Allah that we have destroyed them.\"\n\nThe leadership of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) has been influenced by the Wahhabi and Deobandi traditions. IMU head, Juma Namangani, (who was killed in November 2001) was indirectly influenced by outside Islamic revival when serving in the Soviet army in Afghanistan fighting Afghan mujahideen. He was radicalized by the experience and returning to his home in the Fergana Valley wanting to fight on the side of the Islamic revival not against it. He associated with local Islamists of the Islamic Renaissance Party (IRP) and the local Islamic revolutionary party \"Adolat\" (), and became a founder of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.\nIn 1995, Namangani traveled to Saudi Arabia to undergo \"religious and intelligence training from Saudi intelligence\". \nAccording to journalist Ahmed Rashid, the IMU is believed to have been funded by Saudis, Pakistanis, Turks, Iranians, and Osama bin Laden. Namangani was one of the most important “foreign Taliban” commanders in northern Afghanistan during the recent fighting there. He led a pan-Islamic force of Uzbeks, Tajiks, Pakistanis, Chechens, and Uighurs from Xinjiang province in China. They fought on the side of the Taliban in Afghanistan, but their long-range goal was to establish an Islamic state throughout Central Asia.\n\nWahhabism or Salafism has been particularly successful in the ex-Soviet Muslim-majority areas such as Dagestan and Chechnya for a number of reasons, according to Robert Bruce Ware.\nAlthough two-thirds of Azerbaijanis are members of the Shiite branch of Islam, (which Wahhabis/Salafis strongly oppose), and Muslims in Azerbaijan have a tradition of secularism, Wahhabism/Salafism has made headway among the one third of the country that identify themselves as Sunni Muslims and primarily inhabit the northern and western regions, specifically those of Dagestani ethnicity (Avars, Lezgins, Tsakhurs, Rutuls) in areas bordering Dagestan.\n\nWahhabism/Salafism was introduced and catalyzed starting with the dissolution of the Soviet Union by missionaries and funds from Arab countries such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, and Salafists mainly from Chechnya and Dagestan. In 1997, the Azerbaijani branch of the Kuwaiti Revival of Islamic Heritage society, built the Abu Bakr mosque in Baku, the capital. It became \"one of the most successful mosques\" in Azerbaijan, with 5000 people typically attending Friday prayer (compared to 300 for an average Azerbaijan mosque) and the \"myriad\" of social opportunities it provided created an \"attractive network for its relatively young believers,\" and was \"a great impetus for the Salafi movement\". Its Imam for many years (Gamat Suleymanov) was a graduate of the Islamic University of Madinah of Medina Saudi Arabia.\n\n Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has said, that the spread of Wahhabism must be contained noting the need to, \"crack down on the ideology of Wahhabism\" in mosques, on TV, on social networks, through mobile devices. \nWahhabi or Islamist insurgency in the North Caucasus is \"particularly intense\" in Dagestan. As of 2011, Suicide bombers were killing an average of three policemen per week, with numerous civilians also becoming casualties. From January to June 2011, Police claimed to have killed 100 \"rebels\" according to Russian Interior Ministry officials.\nAlthough Georgia is predominantly Christian, it has Muslim minorities. In the Pankisi Gorge, home to the Kists, a small Muslim ethnic group, the older generation of Sufis is gradually giving away to younger Wahhabis who \"scorn\" the old practices and pray in \"new, gleaming mosques\". Wahhabism entered into \"a dozen Pankisi villages in the 1990s, popularized by young people educated in Arab countries\". (The \"Wahhabis\" do not use the term but agree they are practicing a form of Sunni Islam \"similar to that which prevails in Saudi Arabia.) \nAccording to a 2015 report, \"a year ago, about 70 per cent\" of the younger generation were Wahhabis and \"now almost 90 per cent of them are.\"\n\nWahhabism is being exported into South Asia through the funding of mosques, Islamic schools, cultural institutions and social services. With \"public and private Saudi funding\", Wahhabism has \"steadily gained influence among Muslim communities\" in South Asia since the late 1970s, \"significantly\" changing \"the nature\" of South Asian Islam, and bringing an increase in \"Islamist violence\" in \"Pakistan, Indian Kashmir, and Bangladesh\". According to Jammu and Kashmir Police and Indian Central intelligence officers, in 2005 the House of Saud approved a $35-billion (Rs 1,75,000 crore) plan to build mosques and madrassas in South Asia.\n\nBangladesh has the forth or fifth largest population of Muslims of any country and about a 30% poverty rate. Since the late 1970s, Saudi Arabia has funded the construction of thousands of radical mosques and madrasas in Bangladesh. Hefazat-e-Islam, controls over 14,000 mosques and madrasas where up to 1.4 million students get an Islamic education without any state supervision. individuals radicalized in Wahhabi-funded mosques have coalesced under Hefazat-e-Islam, which was implicated in a January 2014 incident when its members took to the streets in violent protests and demanded the implementation of Islamic law in Bangladesh.\n\nIn 2013 when the Bangladeshi government cracked down on Jamaat-e Islami for war crimes during the Bangladesh liberation war, Saudi Arabia expressed its displeasure by cutting back on the number of Bangladeshi guest workers allowed to work in (and sent badly needed remittances from) Saudi Arabia.[55]\n\nBangladesh also receives a concession from Saudi on the price of oil imports. With the concession has come changes in religious practices, according to Imtiyaz Ahmed, a religious scholar and professor of International Relations at University of Dhaka. \"Saudi Arabia is giving oil, Saudi Arabia would definitely want that some of their ideas to come with oil.\" The Milad, the celebration of the Prophet Muhammad’s birthday and formerly \"an integral part of Bangladeshi culture\" is no longer popular, while black burqas for women are much more so . In Saudi Arabia Milad is officially ignored, while for women in public places all-covering black (or similar dark, dull color) hijab is required.\n\nOne way conservative Saudi religious practices are spread is through schools. Nearly 6 million Bangladeshi children attend schools at (private) Quomi madrassas. Unlike regulated state schools these madrasses are free and entirely supported by private donations, which come from both inside and outside Bangladesh.\n\nQuomi madrassas syllabus follows \"orthodox Islamic teaching\", being \"restricted to study of Hadith and Tafsir-e-Quran (understanding and interpretation of Hadith and Quran) with emphasis on aspects of Jihad\"\n\nOne burka-wearing Bangladeshi told the DW journalist who interviewed Imtiyaz Ahmed that she started wearing a burqa because at her son's school (a Quomi madrassas) \"the teachers scold the students whose mothers don’t wear burqas. So, I asked my nephew who works in the Middle East to get me one.\" While rising crime and desire to feel safe are factors in the popularity of burkas, religious pressure is also. \nBetween 2011 and 2013, 25,000 Saudi clerics arrived in India with $250 million to build mosques and universities and to hold seminars. There is concern regarding the increasing Saudi-Wahhabi influence in the North West and in the East of India.\n\nAccording to Saudi diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks in 2015, 140 Muslim preachers are listed as on the Saudi Consulate’s payroll in New Delhi alone.\n\nIn the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir (a majority-Muslim state that has been the site of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the 1999 Kargil War, and the ongoing insurgency), 1.5 of the 8 million Muslims \"affiliate with Wahhabi mosques\" thanks to Saudi influence. The Saudi-funded Jamiat Ahl-e-Hadith has built 700 mosques and 150 schools in JK and claims that 16 percent of Kashmir’s population are members. Police in Jammu and Kashmir believe this is the result of a $35 billion plan approved by Saudi Arabia’s government in 2005 to build mosques and madrassas in South Asia.\n\nIn the late 1990s Wahhabism challenged more tradition moderate practices of Islam in the Maldives. After the 2004 tsunami, Saudi funded preachers gained influence. Within a short period of a decade fundamentalist practices dominated the culture. It is reported that Maldives has a, \"growing Wahhabist majority and an autocratic government . . . or, according to the Maldivian opposition, a pliant ally where few questions are asked and fewer are allowed\". In 2017, Members of the Maldivian Democratic Party have raised concerns that the decision by the government of President Abdulla Yameen to \"sell\" one of Maldives 26 atolls, to Saudi Arabia will aggravate Wahhabism in the Maldives.\n\nAccording to Azra Naseem, a Maldivian researcher on extremism at Dublin City University, “you can’t say all of Salafism is radical Islam, but it’s a form of Islam that’s completely brought into the Maldives from Saudi Arabia and other places. Now, it’s being institutionalized, because everybody in the universities, in the Islamic Ministry, they are all spreading this form of Islam.” In April 2017, Yameen Rasheed, a liberal blogger and \"a strong voice against growing Islamic radicalization\", was stabbed to death \"by multiple assailants\". According to a study by the Soufan Group, the islands supply 200 fighters to extremist outfits in Syria and Iraq—the world’s highest per-capita number of foreign fighters.\n\nPakistan has the third largest Muslim population in the world and approximately 30% of its people living below the poverty threshold. Over decades, Saudi has spent billions of dollars in Pakistan, while the $ billions in remittances from the almost one million Pakistanis living and working in Saudi Arabia (as of 2010) are a vital source of income for Pakistan. Many of the madrassas funded by Saudis groups combine Deobandi and other ideologies with Wahhabism.\n\nAccording to a \"Pew Research Center\" survey, Pakistanis hold the most favorable perception of the desert kingdom in the world, with 95 percent Pakistanis surveyed viewing Saudi Arabia favorably. Support is also high for strict/traditional Islamic law favored by Saudi rulers in Pakistani opinion polls — stoning as punishment for adultery (82%), whippings and cutting off of hands for crimes like theft and robbery (82%), death penalty for those who leave the Muslim religion (76%). A major source of Saudi/Wahhabi impact in Pakistan has been through the Pakistani religious parties Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) (Jamaati Ulama Islam before 1988), Jamiat Ahle Hadith and in particular the Jamaat-e-Islami. Saudis have helped fund Jamaat-e-Islami's educational networks since the 1960s. The party has been active in the Saudi-founded Muslim World League and \"segments of the party \"came to accept Wahhabism.\"\n\nThe constituent council of the Muslim World League included Abul A'la Maududi (founder of Jamaat-e-Islami).\n\nWith the help of funding from Saudi Arabia and other sources, thousands of religious schools (madrasses) were established during the 1980s in Pakistan, usually Deobandi in doctrine and often sponsored by Jamaati Ulama Islam. \"This rapid expansion came at the expense of doctrinal coherence as there were not enough qualified teachers to staff all the new schools. Quite a few teachers did not discern between tribal values of their ethnic group, the Pushtuns and the religious ideals. The result was an interpretation of Islam that blended Pushtun ideals and Deobandi views, precisely the hallmark of the Taliban.\" Another source describes the madrasses as combining Deobandi ideology with \"Wahhabism as reflected in the education imparted to students in Saudi Arabia\", the country providing of much of the schools funding. Critics (Dilip Hiro) complained of intolerance teachings as reflected in the chant at the morning student assembly at radical madrassas: \"When people deny our faith, ask them to convert and if they don't destroy them utterly.\"\n\nAnother complaint about religious schools leading to extremism comes from a 2008 US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks concerning southern Punjab (specifically the Multan, Bahawalpur, and Dera Ghazi Khan Divisions there),\ngovernment and non-governmental sources claimed that financial support estimated at nearly $100 million USD annually was making its way to Deobandi and Ahl-e-Hadith clerics in the region from \"missionary\" and \"Islamic charitable\" organizations in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ostensibly with the direct support of those governments.But the diplomat complained many of the students ended up in terrorist training camps.\nThe network reportedly exploited worsening poverty in these areas of the province to recruit children into the divisions' growing Deobandi and Ahl-eHadith madrassa network from which they were indoctrinated into jihadi philosophy, deployed to regional training/indoctrination centers, and ultimately sent to terrorist training camps in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).One militant who has fought for Wahhabi-style Islam in Pakistan is Sufi Mohammad. Originally an activist of Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), he fought in the Afghan jihad and founded Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi (Movement for the Enforcement of Islamic Law) in 1992. Described as \"an ardent believer in the Wahhabi school of thought\" who has \"remained associated with Saudi-sponsored groups from the Afghan theater of 1980-88\". He was imprisoned on January 15, 2002, but the group has gone on to bomb girls schools, video and CD shops, and the statues of Buddhas in Bamiyan. It has also forced the closure of some development organizations, accusing them of spreading immorality by employing female staff.\n\nAn example of the conflict between Wahhabi influence and supporters of the traditional popular and (more tolerant) Islam has been described (and criticized) by Pakistani journalist Sayyed Shah. In Shah's home village (in northwest Pakistan), the villagers \"were Sunni, but our culture, our traditions were a mixture of Shia and Barelvi and Deobandi,” and included handing \"out sweets and water” during Shia public self-lashings at a local Barelvi shrine. A preacher trained in a Saudi-funded seminary came to the village and denounced the Barelvi and Shiite beliefs as false and heretical. By 2010 “everything had changed.” Some women began wearing full burqas. Militants began attacking \"kiosks where merchants sold secular music CDs\". Two attempts were made to destroy the Barelvi shrine with bombs. The village, including families, were divided between those who wanted Saudi Wahhabi religion and those who did not. (Other scholars argue that outside influences are not alone in generating sectarianism and jihadist violence in Pakistan, which has roots in the country’s origins in the partition of India in 1947.)\n\nSaudi Arabia is strengthening its links with Brunei particularly relation to its Islamic-status and its oil-leverage in the region.\n\nSince 1980, Saudi government, individual Saudis, and Saudi religious foundations and charities has devoted millions of dollars to exporting Salafism to Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim country, historically religiously tolerant and diverse. It has built more than 150 mosques (albeit in a country that has about 800,000), a huge free university in Jakarta, and several Arabic language institutes; supplied more than 100 boarding schools with books and teachers; brought in preachers and teachers; and disbursed thousands of scholarships for graduate study in Saudi Arabia. Kuwait, and Qatar have also \"invested heavily\" in building religious schools and mosques throughout Indonesia. Salafi radio stations, TV channels and website in Indonesia (and Southeast Asia) have undergone a \"rapid rise\". The conservative funding sources are eager to strip traditional Indonesian Islam of local customs containing elements of Hindu ritual and Sufi mysticism.\n\nSaudi influence began around 1988, when President Suharto, encouraged a Saudi presence in Indonesia. \nThe \"primary conduits\" of Saudi Islamic funding in Indonesia are the \"Dewan Dakwah Islamiyah Indonesia\" (the Indonesian Society for the Propagation of Islam, or DDII founded in 1967) and \"Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Islam dan Arab\" (the Institute of Islamic and Arabic Studies, or LIPIA, a branch of the Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University in Riyadh Saudi Arabia). The Saudi embassy's Religious Attache Offices provides scholarships for students to go to Saudi Arabia and pays for \"Attache preachers\" to give Friday \"Khutbah\" sermons \"across Indonesia\" as well as Arabic teachers. The LIPIA, an all-expenses paid Salafist university in Jakarta, has produced tens of thousands of graduates since its founding in 1980. h\n\nBoth affluent and poor schools, in both Java and more remote islands are beneficiaries of Saudi largess. As of 2016, the number of \"pesantren\" (religious boarding schools) following the Salafi \"manhaj\" (path) had grown to about 100. The libraries of other pesantren — including the prestigious Gontor pesantren in East Java — are filled with books from Saudi Arabia. The Saudi religious affairs office in Jakarta provides about one million Arabic religious books translated into Indonesian every year. The titles include \"Questions and Answers about Islamic Principles,\" by Bin Baaz, one of Saudi Arabia's most venerated interpreters of Islam. As of 2003, a pew poll found Crown Prince Abdullah, was rated as one of the three leaders Indonesians trusted the most.\n\nAs the Wahhabism/Salafism has expanded, some Indonesia have become alarmed at what they call the \"arabization\" of their country and called for an Islam with freedom of opinion and tolerance, that does not reject pluralism and democracy. A graduate of LIPIA (Farid Okhbah) helped found the National Anti-Shia Alliance (ANNAS) of Indonesia (the founder of Wahhabism believed Shia to be heretics and a series of attacks on Shia have occurred in East Java). Although Shia make up only about 1% of the population of the country, Okhbah has called Shia Islam a bigger threat to Indonesia than communism in the 1960s and urged the sect be banded.\n\nAccording to Sidney Jones, the director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict in Jakarta, Saudi influence “has contributed to a more conservative, more intolerant atmosphere,” and may be behind campaigns against Shia and Ahmadi Islam, (both of which Wahhabis consider heretics) but very few of the Indonesians arrested on terrorism charges in Indonesia since 2002, have any ties to \"Wahhabi or Salafi institutions\".\n\nHowever, according to a 2003 article in the New York Times, Saudis have also discretely provided funds for \"militant Islamic groups\". The Saudi foundation Al Haramain financed educational institutions with the approval of the Indonesian Ministry of Religion, and \"served as a conduit\" for money to Jemaah Islamiyah, a Southeast Asian Islamist organization that aims to build Islamic states in the region and has bombed many civilian targets. (The spiritual guide of Jemaah Islamiyyah (Abu Bakar Bashir) has now pledged his allegiance to ISIS.)\n\nIn 1980 Prince Muhammad al-Faysal of Saudi Arabia offered that Malaysia $100 million for an interest-free finance corporation, and two years later the Saudis helped finance the government-sponsored Bank Islam Malaysia. In 2017 it was reported that Wahhabism is spreading among Malaysia’s elite, and that the traditional Islamic theology currently taught in Government schools is gradually being shifted to a view of theology derived from the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia.\n\nAustralia has approximately 600,000 Muslim among its population of about 25 million. Within Australia, Saudi funds have used to build and/or operate mosques, schools, charities, a university and Australian Islamic institutions, with estimates up to US$100 million. This funding has generated tensions between Australian Muslim organizations. In 2015, it was uncovered by WikiLeaks, that the Saudi Government has provided finance to build mosques, to support Islamic community activities and to fund visits by Sunni clerics to counter Shiite influence.\n\nCanada has approximately one million Muslim out of a population of 35 million. Among the institutions in Canada Saudis have funded include mosques in Ottawa, Calgary, Quebec City. In Toronto the Salaheddin Islamic Centre was funded by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia himself with a \"US$5 million capital grant\" and a further \"US$1.5 million per year for operations\", according to author Lawrence Solomon.\nAccording to the \"National Post\" the Salaheddin Islamic Centre received substantial funding from donors in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE in 2009 and 2010. One of the founders of the Centre (Hassan Farhat), left Canada to join an al-Qaeda-linked group in Iraq, where he allegedly commanded a squad of suicide bombers. The centre's imam (Aly Hindy) is known for his \"controversial comments\" on homosexuality and Canadian law, and for refusing to sign a statement condemning the 2005 London bombings.\n\nAccording to a report in \"The Globe and Mail\" the Saudi government has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to private Islamic schools in Canada. Saudi diplomatic cables from 2012 and 2013 disclosed by WikiLeaks contain conversations \"about a $211,000 donation to a school in Ottawa and $134,000 to a school in Mississauga\", according to the report. (The schools confirmed that they had sought the donations to help expand their facilities but denied the money came with conditions.)\n\nNew Zealand has approximately 46,00 Muslim out of a population of 4.6 million. In Christchurch (the largest city on New Zealand's South Island) the local mosque was \"funded largely from private Saudi sources\". As of 2006 the management the mosque's association (the Canterbury Muslim Association or MAC) is \"commonly labelled ‘Wahhabi’ by its opponents\" (following \"serious and sometimes well-publicised divisions since the early 1990s\", stemming from issues including interpretation of Islamic practice). In 2003 it sought \"to turn the mosque property over to a trust dominated by the Saudi al-Haramain Foundation in return for money to establish a school, and still evidently wants to establish some sort of a trust\". \n\nFrom 2006 to 2013, conservative Islamic preachers associated in some way with Saudi Arabia or Wahhabi Islam—such as Bilal Philips, Sheikh Khalid Yasin, Siraj Wahhaj, Yahya Ibrahim—held workshops in mosques and university student halls \"up and down New Zealand\". The conservative Investigate Magazine complains that works by some of the preachers include books that urge \"followers to kill Jews, Christians, pagans and Hindus\".\n\nIslamic youth camps were held in 2001 on the North Island (at the Kauaeranga Forest Education Camp on the Coromandel Peninsula), where the \"theme\" was the restoration of the Islamic caliphate (\"The Khilafah and man’s role as Khalifah\"); and on the South Island (Muslim students camp near Mosgiel) where the theme was ‘Islam is the Solution’ (a slogan of the Muslim Brotherhood). The Saudi supported World Assembly of Muslim Youth held a 10-day Intensive Islamic course for \"more than 300 brothers and sisters\" in 2003.\n\nIn November 2016 Mohammad Anwar Sahib, Imam of At-Taqwa mosque in New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, and a religious advisor for the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand (FIANZ), created controversy when he was videoed saying, \"The Christians are using the Jews, and the Jews are using everybody, because they think that their protocol is to rule the entire world...\", in a speech at the mosque. In reply he stated that his statement was taken out of context and demanded an apology. He was later terminated as Secretary for the Ulama Board of the FIANZ.\n\nIn January 2017 Taie bin Salem bin Yaslam al-Saya'ari, a Saudi citizen who is \"believed to have lived and studied in New Zealand between 2008 and 2013\" and become radicalized there, was killed by Saudi security forces. Bin Yaslam al-Saya'ari is thought to have planned a July 2016 attack on the mosque where the Prophet of Islam Muhammad is buried (\"Al-Masjid an-Nabawi\") which killed four Saudi security force members. He is said to have been inspired by another student studying in New Zealand who went to Syria to fight for the Islamic State and was also killed.\n\nIn the US, where Muslims make up an estimated 1% of the population, Saudi Arabia funds, at least in part, an estimated 80 percent of all mosques. According to an official Saudi weekly, \"Ain al-Yaqeen\", Saudi money helped finance 16 American mosques. According to Yvonne Haddad, (a professor of the history of Islam at the Georgetown center), records of the Muslim World League show that during a two-year span in the 1980s, the League spent about $10 million in the United States on mosque construction. The Saudi royal family directly contributed to the construction of a dozen mosques, including the $8.1 million King Fahad Mosque in Culver City, California.\n\nThe Saudi embassy's \"Department of Islamic Affairs\" was founded in 1982 and was directed by Prince Muhammad ibn Faysal ibn Abd al-Rahman for many years. At its height in the late 1990s, the department had 35-40 diplomats and an annual budget of $8 million according to a Saudi official contacted by author Zeyno Baran. The department provided regular financial support \"to radical mosques and madrassas (religious schools)\" in the United States, \"including several attended by the 9/11 hijackers and otherwise linked to terrorist activities\" according to author Harry Helms.\n\nAs in the UK and some other countries, universities in America have received funding from petroleum exporting Muslim states. Harvard and Georgetown universities both received $20 million in 2005 from a Saudi businessman (Prince Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz Alsaud). \nOther Saudi gifts reportedly included $20 million to the Middle East Studies Center at the University of Arkansas; $5 million to the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of California, Berkeley; $11 million to Cornell University in Ithaca, New York and a half million dollars to University of Texas; $1 million to Princeton University; $5 million to Rutgers University. Academic chairs for Islamic Studies were donated at Harvard Law School and the University of California Santa Barbara. Islamic research institutes at American University (in Washington), Howard University, Duke University, and Johns Hopkins University were supported by the Saudis. These donations to academia have been described as aimed more at influencing Western public opinion than Muslims. Donors (such as Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin-Talal) have described them as intended to \"promote peace and help bridge the gap between East and West\"; Critics (primarily Western political conservatives such as Daniel Pipes) believe they are incentive for \"Middle East researchers, instructors and center directors\" in Western countries to \"behave\" and \"say the things the Saudis like\" in exchange for large donations.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3778367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3778367", "title": "Islam in Iceland", "text": "Islam in Iceland\n\nIslam in Iceland is a minority religion. The Pew Research Center estimated that less than 10,000 people in Iceland were Muslim in 2010.In 2011 the Muslims of Iceland attracted the interest of Al Jazeera, which planned a documentary dealing with Muslims in Iceland and New Zealand. Al Jazeera was interested in how Ramadan is honored in the higher latitudes where the night can be of unusual length when compared to the majority-Muslim lands.\n\nThe earliest mention of Iceland in Muslim sources originates in the works of Muhammad al-Idrisi (1099–1165/66) in his famous \"Tabula Rogeriana\", which mentions Iceland's location in the North Sea.\n\nThe long-distance trading and raiding networks of the Vikings will have meant that various Icelanders, like the Norwegians Rögnvald Kali Kolsson or Harald Hardrada, came into direct contact with the Muslim world during the Middle Ages; indirect connections are best attested by finds of Arabic coins in Iceland, as also widely in the Viking world.\n\nFollowing Iceland's conversion to Christianity around 1000, some Icelanders encountered the Islamic world through pilgrimage, for example to Jerusalem, of the kind described by Abbot Nikulás Bergsson in his \"Leiðarvísir og borgarskipan\".\n\nFrom around the late thirteenth century, a fantastical version of the Islamic world is prominent in medieval Icelandic romance, partly inspired by Continental narratives influenced by the Crusades. Although this image generally characterises the Islamic world as 'heathen', and repeats the misconceptions of Islam widespread in the medieval West, it also varies substantially from text to text, sometimes, for example, associating the Islamic world with great wealth, wisdom, or chivalry. Romance continued to serve as a medium for Icelanders to contemplate Islam in the post-medieval period, for example in Jón Oddsson Hjaltalín's eighteenth-century romance \"Fimmbræðra saga\", which combined traditional storytelling with Continental Enlightenment scholarship.\n\nPerhaps the earliest known example of Muslims coming to Iceland occurred in 1627, when the Dutch Muslim Jan Janszoon and his Barbary pirates raided portions of Iceland, including the southwest coast, Vestmannaeyjar, and the eastern fjords. This event is known in Icelandic history as the \"Tyrkjaránið\" (the \"Turkish Abductions\"). An estimated 400-800 Icelanders were sold into slavery.\n\nIslam started to gain presence in Icelandic culture around the 1970s, partly through immigration from the Islamic world (for example Salmann Tamimi) and partly through Icelanders' exposure to Islamic culture while travelling (for example Ibrahim Sverrir Agnarsson). Some of the immigrants simply came of their own accord; others came as refugees, including groups from Kosovo. The Koran was first translated into Icelandic in 1993, with a corrected edition in 2003.\n\nSalmann Tamimi estimates that when he came to Iceland in 1971 there were perhaps seven Muslims living there. As of 2013, however,\n\n\nThe first generation of Muslims born in Iceland probably began with people like Salmann's own children, such as Yousef Ingi Tamimi (b. 1988). Iceland's Muslim population is of diverse origins, including people born in the Arab world, Albania, Africa, and Iceland.\n\nThe Muslim Association of Iceland (\"Félag múslima á Íslandi\") was founded in 1997 by Salmann Tamimi, a Palestinian immigrant; it was officially recognised on February 25. Since 2010 the chair has been Ibrahim Sverrir Agnarsson. As of 2014, the association has 465 members. More than half were born in Iceland; perhaps 40-50 were born to non-Muslim parents.\n\nThe Muslim Association of Iceland currently runs the Reykjavík Mosque, a Sunni mosque on the third floor of an office building in Ármúli 38, Reykjavík. It has two imams and offers daily and nightly prayers attended by a mix of local Icelanders and visiting Muslims. It also offers weekly Friday prayers for Jumu'ah. In 2000 the Muslim Association applied to purpose-build a mosque in Reykjavík; after a long process, permission for building was granted on July 6, 2013.\n\nPrayers are said in Arabic, but English and Icelandic are also widely used due to the diverse nature of the congregation. The Association regularly runs courses in both Arabic and Icelandic.\n\nThe Islamic Culture Centre of Iceland (\"Menningarsetur múslima á Íslandi\") was founded in 2008 by Karim Askari, originally from Morocco, and as of 2014 has 305 members.

Many public expressions of Islamophobia have in the second decade of the twenty-first century been focused on opposition to the creation of a purpose-built Reykjavík mosque. Opposition to Islam is often presented in terms of support for gender equality, a discourse which in Kristín's assessment is 'used as a way to dwell on the criticism of Muslims in general, and to the glory of European societies'. Óttar M.

The Comorians are a blend of settlers from many areas: Iranian traders, mainland Africans, Arabs and Malagasy. Comorian communities can also be found in other parts of the Comoros chain as well as in Madagascar.\n\nAlthough young people wear Western style clothing, traditional clothing is still common among adults. While in town, a Comorian man will typically wear a white cotton garment and a knee-length shirt, sometimes with a white jacket and white skull cap. Out of town, a long cloth sarong (colorful skirt) is worn. Most women wear long, colorful cotton dresses with bright shawls as face coverings. Others prefer black robes that cover their heads.\n\nPolygamy has been an acceptable practice among the Comorians.

The state was established in 1808 in wake of the partition between the rulers in the Royal House of Kedah. The partition witnessed the territory being seceded to the cadet branch of the royal family. The sovereignty of the kingdom effectively ended in 1916, following the dissolution by the Siamese government. Her borders was largely inherited to her successive province, the present-day Satun, Thailand.\n\nSetul derived its name from \"Buah Setul\", a local name for Cottonfruit native to the area, while its honorific title - \"Mambang Segara\" is a Malay variant of the Sea Deity, potentially tied from the ancient Malay mysticism due to its location off the western seaboard of the Malay Peninsular. The state was also colloquially referred to Setoi, a Kedahan Malay cognate of the territory. In the Thai language, the state was known as \"Satun\" (), the Thai pronunciation was later adopted to the present-day name of the province.\n\nOnce located in the heartland of Kedah Kingdom, Setul rise to prominence following the death of Abdullah Mukarram Shah, the 20th Sultan of Kedah in 1797. The demise of the monarch resulted the crowning of Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah II as the new Sultan. The election was endorsed and recognised by the Rattanakosin Kingdom of Siam, who perceived Kedah as their vassal. The appointment however, rapidly erupted into a severe secession crisis in the Royal House after it was contested by the crown prince, Tunku Bisnu. Aiding to reconcile the two rivalling parties, the Siamese appointed Tunku Bisnu as the ruler of Setul, signifying the birth of Kedah into two separate realms.\n\nTunku Bisnu spends most of his reign in Kedah over Setul, with local affairs was mainly administrated by his aide, Dato' Wan Abdullah. Nonetheless, as recorded by \"Syair Sultan Maulana\", it was narrated that Tunku Bisnu was a capable ruler that led the Kedahan troops during the war against Konbaung Dynasty forces in Salang.\n\nBy 1833, the royal courts of Kedah entered another crisis between Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Syah II and Tunku Embun (Tunku Yaakub), the crown price. The crisis was predominantly derived from the sultan's refusal to appoint the crown prince to be the King of Kayang (Perlis) and Setul. This resulted Tunku Embun to request military assistance from the Governor of Ligor to overthrow the Kedahan government, falsely claiming that the Sultan has allied with the British. The armed conflict was known locally as \"Perang Musuh Berbisik\" (War of the whispering enemies).\n\nDuring the War of 1833, the geographical location provided in Setul was used for the advantage by the Kedahan militia led by Dato Wan Mad Ali (Dato Setia Sengkara), to launch an attack against the Siamese in Terang, Ayer Kelubi dan Pulau Panjang. Following the fall of Kedah, Dato Wan Mad Ali was forced to move to Langkawi along with an exodus of 100 Malay families from Setul.\n\nThe coup d'état led by Tunku Yaakob was proven to be successful, as the sultan was forced to retreat in the British-backed Penang and later exiled in Malacca. Nonetheless, Tunku Yaakob's request to be appointed as the Sultan of Kedah was refused. He and his son, Tunku Sulaiwan were later brutally executed by the order of the Siamese King after he was found guilty of spreading malicious news of the previous sultan.\n\nFollowing the victory, the Siamese then formed a border reformation that divide Kedah into 4 separate territories and appointing Tunku Muhammad Akib, the prince of Tunku Bisnu as the new King of Setul. The border reformation was parallel to the Partition of Pattani made by the Siamese earlier in 1809, the earlier partition witnessed the birth of Malay state of Pattani into 7 separate kingdoms.\n\nThe partition was ratified by 1843, when Zainal Rashid, the Sultan of Kedah bought a royal entourage to the Siamese government in Bangkok. The royal entourage consist of Tunku Anum, the ruler of Kubang Pasu; Syed Hussein, the ruler of Perlis and Tunku Muhammad Akib, the ruler of Setul. They pledged their loyalty to the Siamese crown, together with a Bunga Mas as a sign of tributary from each of the respective territories. Signifying the birth of the state into four separate dominion.\n\nDespite the fact that Kedah was officially partitioned into 4 distinct kingdoms, all of the states maintained a close economic and kinship ties. Several exemplification can be witnessed during this era, the royal marriage between Tunku Jahara, the member of Kubang Pasu Royalty with Tunku Ahmad the prince of Kedah; and in 1904, between Tunku Jura, a Kedahan princess with Syed Zahir, a royal member of the Setul Kingdom.\n\nTunku Ismail seceded to the throne of Setul in 1876 after the death of Tunku Muhammad Akib. The king was alleged to be an incompetent leader for the administration of the state. Internal strife in the Royal House of Setul caused a relative of Tunku Ismail, Tunku Muhammad to established a kingdom in Langu, north of Setul in 1882. Both of the territories managed to be reunified afterwards after a consolidation by the Siamese government.\n\nThere were several infrastructure developments can be witnessed during the reign of Tunku Ismail, including the construction of several roads, fort, the town hall and managing the rivers in Setul. Tunku Ismail also ordered the construction of a brick prison, enlarging the court, improving the telegram network and introducing the postal service. His rule also witnessed a closer relationship with the Siamese, with the kingdom sends 260 individuals to subdue the Chinese rebellion of Phuket in 1878 together with the troops from Kedah and Perlis. He was awarded the Order of the White Elephant for his active role in aiding the Siamese during the revolt.\n\nTunku Abdul Rahman replaced Tunku Ismail as the king upon his death in 1888, with Tunku Muhammad appointed as the crown prince. He managed to further develop various infrastructures centred around the capital. Towards the end of his 10-year reign, he became permanently insane.\n\nThe vacant seat of the king has led Kedah to appoint Tunku Baharuddin bin Ku Meh as a Governor for the administrative works in Setul. Better known as Ku Din, he was a commander in the Alor Setar prison. Ku Din was known to be a capable leader, nonetheless he doesn't received much approval from the general public since he is not a member of the Setul royalty.\n\nThe appointment of Ku Din as the Governor of Setul also angered Tunku Muhammad, the crown prince as he was supposed to rule the kingdom. As the crown prince doesn't received much recognition from the Royal Courts of Kedah, he tried to sought assistance in Bangkok. His efforts proved to be vain since Ku Din was far more influential compared to the crown prince. Tunku Muhammad however, was absorbed into the Satun administration after several months since the appointment of Ku Din.\n\nKu Din rapidly forged closer ties to the Siamese central government upon his appointment as the Governor. He began to send Bunga Mas tributaries separately from Kedah. The separate Bunga Mas caused a severe strain in the Kedah-Setul diplomatic relationship, as the possession from the state was historically sent via Kedah, since both the Siamese and Kedah perceived Setul as a Kedahan principality. The link between the two kingdoms only began to be restored after a reconciliation by Che Ampuan Manyalara, the Queen of Kedah.\n\nKu Din widely emulated many similar features from the Kedahan administration system, including the introduction of the Head of Education Department, Malay School Headmaster, Chinese Kapitan, Royal Officer Service, Head of the Judicial Court, \"Kadzi\", Head of Medical Department, Head of the Police Force, Auditor, Translator and various other departments. He also improved the police department by recruiting 36 armed-force from Punjab. Ku Din was also known to introduce uniforms for the government servant.\n\nTowards the end of his rule, he launched many rules and regulations that accommodate his pro-Siamese ideals. He started to introduce the Siamese language as the language of the courts and administration, replacing Malay. This led to the resignation of many government officials who are not familiar with the language. His pro-Siamese leadership also resulted to a resistant movement by the native Malays in the territory, although the movement was later being subdued by the Siamese government.\n\nBy 1902, he was proclaimed as the King of Setul, bearing the regnal name of Tunku Baharuddin bin Ku Meh. The proclamation was affirmed by the Governors of southern Siam and the Siamese government.\n\nIn 1892, Setul was returned to Kedah. Nonetheless, the Kedahan sovereignty over Setul was gradually being eroded by the Siamese. By 1902, it is evident that Ku Din holds a full-autonomous power over Setul against Kedah.\n\nThe Kedahan jurisdiction in Setul was officially ended by 1909 in wake of the Anglo-Siamese Treaty. The British had planned for an inclusion of Setul together with Kedah and Perlis due to the strong ties between the states, but did not managed to succeeded in its claim due to the reluctance of the Siamese King.\n\nTengku Din was officially abdicated in its position in 1916, 6 years after the consolidation of Setul in Siam. He was awarded as \"The Devoted King\" by the Siamese central government for his efforts in developing Setul. He was however, perceived as a traitor in Kedah for his role in dividing the sultanate.\n\nThe Siamese decided to discontinued the Malay kingship system in Setul. The King was replaced by a Governor from Bangkok, Prak Khoja Ishak. It was recorded that Setul continued to be developed under his leadership. It was during his rule that the role of Islam continued to flourish and the position of \"Khadi Besar\" (Head Khadi) was introduced, a position filled by Dato’ Yutilamdilantik.\n\nThe Prak Khoja Ishak administration marked the end of the full Malay-medium of education in the area. The education system was reformed and incorporated the Thai language as the medium of instruction. This resulted a gradual language and identity shift among the Malay community in Setul. Today, only a small percentage of Thai Muslim in Satun that are conversant in the language, a far-cry for her historical sister states down south. Presently, the Thai government has already reintroduced Malay language lesson in the curricula in some schools in the province, an act to help preserving the culture and identity of the modern Thai Malays in Satun.\n\n\n"}

The Catholic Church nevertheless is concerned with it because \"Some theologians consider this to be a replacement of the marital act, and therefore immoral.\"\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \"strongly discourages the donation of sperm\" and likewise strongly discourages in vitro fertilization \"using semen from anyone but the husband or an egg from anyone but the wife\". However, official church policy also notes that such decisions are personal matters and, as such, \"must be left to the judgment of the husband and wife\". No disciplinary action is advised for LDS married couples who make use of such in vitro fertilization.\n\nSome of the more liberal Protestant denominations support ART. Many Evangelicals, however, especially Calvinists, position themselves similarly to Catholics. \n\nThere are several Hindus who have been claimed to be born without intercourse including Karna & Five Pandavas.\n\nThe Islamic community, after the fatwa on ART by Gad El-Hak Ali Gad El-Hak of Egypt's Al-Azhar University, largely accepted ART.\n\nIVF and similar technologies are permissible as long as they do not involve any form of third-party donation (of sperm, eggs, embryos, or uteruses). Regarding third-party donation there is a debate between the Sunni and Shia streams of Islam. The Sunni community, following the Al-Azhar fatwa, does not allow third-party donations. In 1999, Ayatollah Khamenei, the authority for the Shi'a Muslims, issued a fatwa stating that it was permitted to use third-party donors.\n\nThe conclusions of Gad El-Hak Ali Gad El-Hak's ART fatwa are as follows:\n\nDefining Jewish views on assisted reproductive technology based solely on branches of Judaism is problematic since there is substantial overlap in opinions and moral authority.\n\nWithin the Orthodox Jewish community the concept is debated as there is little precedent in traditional Jewish legal textual sources. Non-legal sources such as medrash and aggadah provide stories that have been used to draw conclusions regarding ART by modern Jewish legal decisors. In general, traditional Judaism views medical intervention positively. Regarding ART, the positive view of medicine is challenged by the Jewish religious legal system which has numerous laws regarding modesty and sexuality and a strong emphasis on verifiable lineage.\n\nIn Orthodox Judaism, insemination with the husband’s sperm is permissible if the wife cannot become pregnant in any other way.\n\nRegarding laws of sexuality, religious challenges include masturbation (which may be regarded as “seed wasting”), laws related to sexual activity and menstruation (niddah) and the specific laws regarding intercourse. Additional issues arise regarding the restrictions of the Sabbath (Shabbat) and Jewish holidays.\n\nAn additional major issue is that of establishing paternity and lineage. For a baby conceived naturally, the father’s identity is determined by a legal presumption (chazakah) of legitimacy: \"rov bi'ot achar ha'baal\" - a woman's sexual relations are assumed to be with her husband. Regarding an IVF child, this assumption does not exist and as such Rabbi Eliezer Waldenberg (among others) requires an outside supervisor to positively identify the father. Doctors or laboratory workers present at the time of the fertility treatment are not considered supervisors due to a conflict of interest and their pre-occupation with their work.\n\nAs such, supervisory services are required for all treatments involving lab manipulation or cryopreservation of sperm, ovum or embryos.\n\nWhile a range of views exist, both egg donation and surrogacy are permitted according to many Orthodox decisors, pending religious fertility supervision. (In Israel, the \"Embryo Carrying Agreements Law\" was formulated to ensure that surrogacy agreements between Jewish Israelis do not conflict with Jewish laws concerning incest and adultery and that the child born of the arrangement will be recognized as a Jew.)\n\nThose interested are recommended to contact their local Orthodox or Hasidic Rabbi, as these laws are obviously complicated, and as is customary.\n\nThe official halachic legal authority for American Conservative Judaism is the Rabbinical Assembly's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards. They vote on proposed responsa. A responsa may be approved by either a majority or a minority vote, and individual Rabbis may rely on even minority-approved responsa for their rulings.\n\nArtificial insemination: AI is permitted whether the donor is the husband of the woman to be impregnated or not, although it is preferable to use the husband's sperm whenever possible. The sperm donor is considered the father for purposes of determining the child's tribal status and for issues of ritual consanguinity, therefore, the use of anonymous donors is strongly discouraged.\nEgg donation/Surrogacy: Surrogacy and egg donation are permissible and the birth mother, rather than the genetic mother, is considered the mother of the child, therefore conversion may be necessary if a non-Jewish woman acts as a gestational surrogate. A maximum of 3 embryos may be implanted at a time. Freezing and donation of embryos is permitted.\n\nThe Conservative movement's position on \"family purity\" practices, reducing the amount of time after a woman's period during which she is prohibited to have sex, may also work as a pro-fertility measure. As part of its treatment of Tohorat HaMishpahah, the Conservative Assembly in 2006 accepted a position of eliminating the requirement for seven white days after the cessation of menses and establishing this as an optional custom. This is offered as a solution for women dealing with ovulation before mikvah by reducing the number of days with sexual relations being forbidden from an average of 12 to 5. Mid-cycle staining during ovulation, while ordinarily would prevent sexual relations by being considered \"zavah\", is to be considered a result of ancillary circumstances (diet, medical treatment, physical exertion, or illness) and as such the emission is considered permissible, and the woman would not become a zavah. Drug therapies to avoid mid-cycle staining are deemed unnecessary with the risks of the drug side-effects outweighing the prohibition of zavah due to the commandment of \"hai bahem\", (\"[you shall] live by them\").\n\nReform Judaism has generally approved artificial insemination by donor, in-vitro fertilization and surrogate motherhood.\n\n"}

It is jointly organised by the Research Centre Vergelijkende Cultuurwetenschap (Ghent University, Belgium), the Centre for the Study of Local Cultures (Kuvempu University, India) and the Karnataka Academy of Social Sciences and Humanities (KASSH).\n\nIndia is home to hundreds of different traditions and virtually all the religions of the contemporary world. The interaction and dialogue among them has produced highly creative cultural forms and ways of living together. Yet, increasingly, scholars have begun to feel that the current knowledge about the Indian culture and its traditions is unsatisfactory at best or erroneous at worst. In the current theoretical paradigm, Indian traditions are conceived of in terms of their respective beliefs, doctrines, holy texts, religious strife, etc. This does not appear to allow for an adequate understanding of the Indian traditions. Not only does this framework determine our understanding of the religions in India, but it also has consequences for the Indians, experiencing their own traditions.\n\nIn the domain of religious studies, in postcolonial studies and in the field of comparative science of cultures, scholars have begun to argue that the questions and conceptual framework for the study of India and its religions are firmly embedded within the Western cultural history, namely within the theological framework of Christianity. Therefore, Rethinking Religion in India aims at interrogating the newly emerging attempts to study the religions and traditions of India differently.\n\nDuring the first conference year the central questions that were explored are the following: Are there religions in India? Is it possible to say that the descriptions of Indian culture and its religions are the products of the Western experience of India? These questions will be explored in different formats in the three modules: (1) In the Platform sessions the different theoretical approaches to the study of religion in India will be discussed. (2) The Roundtable sessions will take up the debate about the construction of Hinduism and investigate the impact of colonialism on our understanding of India. (3) The Parallel Paper sessions will prepare the ground for Platform and Roundtable sessions of the following years. They take up the following themes: Evolutionary explanations of religion; Indians are Aryans, so what?; The caste system and Indian religion.\n\nThe 5-year conference cluster Rethinking Religion in India forms an integrated whole, with each conference building on the previous one. Each year the issues and problems to be addressed will get delineated more sharply. In between conferences, intermediary activities are planned, which will feed into the formulation of the subsequent conference themes and questions.\n\nTo achieve the overall objective of developing a new paradigm for the study of religion in India, a conference format with distinct conference modules and recurring conference themes will be adopted. Each module will approach the ten themes and questions from different angles: (1) Platform sessions; (2) Roundtable sessions; (3) Parallel Paper sessions; (4) \"How to...?\" workshops.\n\nPlatform: Each year, there will be three plenary Platform sessions. These address one particular theme from Rethinking Religion in India. In the Rethinking Religion in India II, the Platform Sessions will consist of a one-on-one debate between representatives of these two positions. Both participants will have the opportunity to select a fellow advocate of their position, who can be requested to take over the task of developing a particular argument or countering an argument of the opponent, in the midst of the debate. The debate will be held according to the principles of reasonable discussion or rational dialogue. These have been conveniently summarised in the “ten commandments” of reasonable discussion by the pragma-dialectical school of argumentation theory.\n\nRoundtable: The Roundtable participants will consist of two groups: (1) an expert group of representatives from the opposing sides of a controversial debate in the religious studies will defend their respective standpoints in the form of a short presentation. (2) A group of respondents will challenge these different positions. The aim of the Roundtable is to generate fresh and novel questions. The main part of the session will be dedicated to discussions among the participants of the Roundtable, but there will be sufficient room for questions and reactions from the audience.\n\nParallel Papers: The Parallel Paper sessions provide young and promising Indian and international scholars a place to actively participate in the conference, and to present and discuss innovative research results. The number of parallel paper sessions has been kept limited so as to ensure the possibility of focused and qualitative discussions. They also intend to foster the academic study of religion in Indian contexts.\n\nThe Parallel Paper sessions form an integrated whole with the Platform and Roundtable sessions and a cross-fertilisation between the different modules will take place: On the one hand, these sessions prepare the grounds for the Platform and Roundtable sessions of the subsequent year. On the other hand, they also provide a space to continue the discussions of the previous year and of the intermediary activities.\n\nThis edited volume crystallises the ideas generated during the inaugural conference of the five-year conference cluster Rethinking Religion in India (New Delhi, 2008): Esther Bloch, Marianne Keppens and Rajaram Hegde (eds.), 978-0-415-54890-8 Rethinking Religion in India: the colonial construction of Hinduism (London: Routledge, 2010). \n\nThe book critically engages with recent debates about the construction of Hinduism. Contributors are S.N. Balagangadhara, Sarah Claerhout, Jakob De Roover, Timothy Fitzgerald, Richard King, David N. Lorenzen, Geoffrey A. Oddie, Laurie L. Patton, Sharada Sugirtharajah, and John Zavos.\n\n"}

The vow is a form of Hindu Tapa (or Tapasas), a self-inflicted corporal punishment intended to help bring spiritual enlightenment. Khareshwari are primarily found in India, but are not limited to that country.\n\nThe length of the vow is unclear from available references. One source says that the vow lasts for twelve years. Other sources do not attach a specific time frame. \n\nKhareshwari traditionally stood under a tree. This may be connected to the Yoga position known as Vrikasana, the Tree Position. A seventeenth-century engraving shows some images of what may be Standing Baba.\n\nMore recently Khareshwari seem to stand inside. Author Gregory David Roberts places Babas inside in his description of Khareshwari in the novel Shantaram. Additionally, two online photos of Khareshwari both show men inside, not under a tree. \n\nThe Standing Baba have a swing-like device that allows them to rest their arms during the day. During the night, a Khareshwari will support his torso on the swing as he sleeps. The swing usually has a sling beneath it. The sling can hold one of the Khareshwari's legs at a time. It is unclear if this is intended to rest one leg or to increase the pressure on the other leg. While Khareshwaris may walk about, they usually just stand/hang in their swing. \n\nStanding for years at a time causes swollen legs and ulcerated feet. Roberts and others describe the Khareshwari tapa as extremely painful and even permanently disabling.\n"}

Thich Nhat Tu urges monks, nuns, and lay people to practice the original teachings of the Buddha, in which The Four Noble Truths (sufferings, origin of sufferings, cessation of sufferings, and path leading to cessation of sufferings) and The Noble Eightfold Paths are the central doctrine of all Buddhist traditions, a conceptual framework for all of Buddhist thoughts, instead of being influenced by the Chinese Buddhism.\n\nAccording to Ven Thich Nhat Tu, there is no such of 84,000 Dharma doors as stated by Chinese schools. In original Buddhism, there is no second Dharma door except threefold learning Discipline, Meditation, and Wisdom. Chinese Dharmas only focus on a few sutras, and tend to ignore all other teachings of the Buddha, as a consequence it is not comprehensive enough to help people cure sufferings completely. To him, 10 Dhamma Doors of China, 14 Dhamma Doors of Japan, and 4 of Tibet are only two parts of The Noble Eightfold Paths which are Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration. Dharma doors propagators have ignored Right View, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, and Right Effort. That is why none of the Dharma Doors is comprehensive.\n\nHe urges Vietnamese Buddhist monks, nuns and lay followers to come back to the traditional Buddhism, maintain and propagate Vietnamese Buddhist culture in Vietnam, not to let it be influenced by Chinese traditions which have rooted in Vietnam in the past 2,000 years. He calls for a traditional Vietnamese chanting and writing. In Vietnam, all should be chanted and written in Vietnamese language so that everyone understands and follows the Buddha’s teaching appropriately, as the full transition of Chinese tradition has deteriorated the initiatives and growth of Vietnamese Buddhism.\n\nThe greatest contribution of Ven. Thich Nhat Tu to the public relation of Vietnam Buddhist Sangha is successfully calling for the celebration of UN Day of Vesak (UNDV) (United Nations Day of Vesak 2008) 2008 and 2014 in Vietnam. As the Deputy Secretary of International Organising Committee (IOC) of United Nations Day of Vesak in Bangkok, he drafted Charter of UNDV, and introduced Prof. Dr. Le Manh That to IOC of UNDV. As a result, in late 2007, Prof.Dr Le Manh That was appointed by IOC as Chairman and Ven. Thich Nhat Tu as Secretary General of UNDV in 2008, hosted by the Government of Vietnam at National Conference Center, Hanoi, Vietnam.\n\nUNDV 2008 has attracted 550 Buddhist leaders and representatives from 78 countries to attend, while UNDV 2014 attended by 1100 international participants from 95 countries. In 2008, it was one of the 10 biggest events of the country, also a historical record in Vietnam.\n\nUNDV in 2008 and 2014 proved an amazing spectacle of religious and spiritual festivity, with thousands of Buddhists from the world to spread Buddha's message of peace, love and harmony.\n\nHe successfully called for the celebration of World Buddhist Summit in Vietnam in 2010, in the Millennial Anniversary of Hanoi. Unfortunately, it was cancelled due to conflicted views between VN Buddhist Sangha and World Buddhist Summit Organisation. It is believed that Thich Nhat Tu is of Vietnamese Monks who has been able to being a bridge between National Vietnam Buddhist Sangha and international Sanghas. Thanks to that VN Buddhist Sangha has gained its reputation internationally.\n\n\n"}

Modern archaeologists identify the ancient site with \"Tel Batash\" (alt. sp. \"Tell Butashi\") (), a tel lying on a flat, alluvial plain, located in the Sorek Valley ca. north-west of Beit Shemesh, near moshav Tal Shahar in Israel. The site is not to be confused with the copper-smelting site of Timna in the Arabah near Eilat.\n\nThe \"Tel Batash\" mound was discovered in the 19th-century by C. Clermont-Ganneau who identified it as a Roman military camp. In subsequent years, the site was uncovered through 1977–1989, in 12 seasons of excavations, by Amihai Mazar and George L. Kelm while Kelm was serving as professor of Biblical Backgrounds and Archaeology at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, on a dig sponsored by the Seminary. The town of Timnath, Colorado in the United States is named for the city.\n\nThe \"Tel Batash\" site is strategically located in the Sorek Valley, an access point from the Coastal Plain through the Shephelah and into the Central Judean Mountains.\n\nThe \"Tel Batash\" site was first settled in the Middle Bronze Age by creating an earthen rampart that enclosed the 10 acre (4 hectare) site. Excavations under the leadership of Mazar and Kelm during the 1980s-1990s uncovered twelve strata of continuous settlement at the site through the Hellenistic period, with sparse settlement nearby during the Byzantine period. It included fortifications and buildings from the Kingdom of Judah period, dating to the 7th and 8th centuries BCE. In one of the buildings, a ceramic potsherd bearing a written LMLK seal was found. Tel Batash during the Philistine era (Late Bronze Age to Iron Age) was a fortified city with dense mud-brick construction. Not far from the tel, on the edge of Nahal Sorek are the remains of a Roman road as well as settlement dating to the Chalcolithic and Canaanite-periods.\n\nTimnah (Timnath) is mentioned in in the context of the story of Tamar and in in the Samson saga, although some place the episode of Judah and Tamar in a different Timnah (Timnath), now called \"Khirbet et-Tibbaneh\". Samson went down to Timnah in order to find a wife. On his way there, he rent open a lion. Samson married a \"girl of the Philistines\" from Timnah and posed a riddle for the men of Timnah, which they were only able to resolve following the intervention of his wife.\n\"Khirbet Tibna\" is a ruin situated ca. south-west of Bet Shemesh, Israel. In the Survey of Palestine Map of 1928–1947 (Pal 1157), preserved at the National Library of Israel, it is listed in map section 14-12, at Grid reference 144.1 / 127.9, under coordinates 3144'36.587\" N / 3456'12.72\"E. The ruin lies ca. 2 kilometers north-east of Moshav Sdot Micha and about south-west of \"Bîr el-Leimûn\". Access to the site is now restricted, as it sits in a military area, at an elevation of 225 metres (740 ft) above sea-level. Early explorers and historical geographers identified the ruin \"Kh. Tibna\" with the biblical town of Timnah, thought to be associated with stories of the biblical Samson (Judges 14:1-5). French orientalist Clermont-Ganneau also thought \"Tibna\" to be a corruption of the Hebrew word Timnah. \n\nEdward Robinson visited the immediate area in 1838, and Tibna was already a deserted village. Archaeologist W.F. Albright visited the site in the winter of 1924–25, which he described as \"Khirbet Tibneh, the Timnath of the Samson story.\" He wrote that the site was covered with \"masses of Græco-Roman and Byzantine débris,\" although he was unable to come-up with Jewish potsherds. In the 1940s, archaeologist Benjamin Mazar conducted a surface survey in the region - including \"Tell Butashi\", without digging. Some think that the Hebrew patriarch, Judah, may have gone to this Timnah (\"Tibna\") to shear his sheep, when he met his daughter-in-law in passing, while others suggest that this would have happened in the Timnath now known as \"Khirbet et-Tibbaneh\".\n\nToday, modern archaeologists think the biblical Timnath (Timnah) associated with the saga of Samson to have been situated where \"Tell Butashi\" is now located, a few kilometers to its north, along the Sorek valley, where extensive archaeological excavations have been conducted during the 1980s–1990s and where they have uncovered Middle Bronze Age artifacts. With the town's demise, the name \"Timnah\" is thought to have migrated to the site now known as \"Khirbet Tibna\", owing to its fame and popularity.\n\nIn , the city is mentioned as a point on the border of the Tribe of Judah. refers to Timnah's vineyards.\n\n"}

(November 4, 1904 – December 8, 1984) was a Polish-American Jesuit priest who conducted clandestine missionary work in the Soviet Union between 1939 and 1963.\n\nFifteen of these years were spent in confinement and hard labor in the Gulag, plus five preceding them in Moscow's infamous Lubyanka prison. He was released and returned to the United States in 1963, after which he wrote two books, including the memoir \"With God in Russia\", and served as a spiritual director.\n\nSince 1990, Ciszek's life has been under consideration by the Roman Catholic Church for possible beatification or canonization. His current title is Servant of God.\n\nCiszek was born on November 4, 1904, in the mining town of Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, to Polish immigrants Mary (Mika) and Martin Ciszek, who had emigrated to the United States in the 1890s. A former gang member, he shocked his family by deciding to become a priest. Ciszek entered the Jesuit novitiate in Poughkeepsie, New York in 1928. The following year, he volunteered to serve as a missionary to Russia, which had become the Soviet Union after the Bolshevik Revolution 12 years before. Many religious rights for Soviet residents were curtailed, the religious believers were openly persecuted, and few religious believers had access to the services of a priest. Pope Pius XI made an appeal to priests from around the world to go to Russia as missionaries.\n\nIn 1934, Ciszek was sent to Rome to study theology and Russian language, history and liturgy at the Pontifical Russian College (or 'Russicum'). In 1937, he was ordained a priest in the Byzantine Rite in Rome taking the name of Vladimir (see Russian Greek Catholic Church).\n\nIn 1938, Ciszek was sent to the Jesuit mission in Albertyn in eastern Poland. With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the Soviet Union occupied eastern Poland and forced Ciszek to close his mission. Arriving in Lviv, he realized that it would be very easy for a priest or two to enter the Soviet Union amid the streams of exiles going East. After securing the permission of Metropolitan Andrei Sheptytsky, he crossed the border in 1940 under the assumed identity of \"Władymyr Łypynski\". With two of his fellow Jesuits, he travelled 2400 km (1500 mi) by train to the logging town of Chusovoy, in the Ural Mountains. For one year, he worked as an unskilled logger, while discreetly performing religious ministry at the same time.\n\nCiszek was arrested in 1941 under accusations of espionage for the Vatican and sent to the Lubyanka prison in Moscow, operated by the NKVD (internal security agency). There he spent a total of five years, most of which in solitary confinement. In 1942, he signed a confession under severe torture. He was convicted of espionage; he was sentenced to 15 years hard labor in the GULAG.\n\nCiszek was to remain in Lubyanka for four more years. In 1946, he was sent by train to Krasnoyarsk then 20 days by boat to Norilsk in Siberia. There, he was to shovel coal onto freighter vessels, and later transferred to work in coal mines. A year later, he was sent to work in construction at an ore processing plant. From 1953 to 1955, he worked in mines. His memoirs provide a vivid description of the revolts that spread through the GULAG in the aftermath of Joseph Stalin's death (see Norilsk uprising).\n\nThroughout his lengthy imprisonment, Ciszek continued to pray, to celebrate Divine Liturgy, hear confessions, conduct retreats and perform parish ministry. Until he was allowed to write to America in 1955, he was presumed dead by both his family and the Jesuit Order.\n\nBy April 22, 1955, Ciszek's hard labor sentence was complete, and he was released with restrictions in the city of Norilsk. At this time, he was finally able to write to his sisters in the United States.\n\nCiszek was ordered by the KGB to move in 1958 to Krasnoyarsk, where he secretly established mission parishes. After the KGB learned of this, he was forcibly transferred to Abakan, 160 km (100 mi) to the south, where he worked as an automobile mechanic for four more years. In 1963, he finally received a letter from his sisters in the U.S. Several months later, the Soviet Union decided to return him (and an American student Marvin W. Makinen) to the United States in exchange for two Soviet agents. He was not informed of this until he was delivered to an official of the U.S. State Department and told he was still an American citizen.\n\nAfter nearly 23 years of imprisonment, Ciszek was released on October 12, 1963, in exchange for two Soviet agents (Ivan Egorov, a Soviet U.N. functionary, and his wife Alexandra, arrested for espionage in July). After his return, he is quoted as stating, \"I am an American, happy to be home; but in many ways I am almost a stranger.\" In 1965, he began working and lecturing at the John XXIII Center at Fordham University (now the Center for Eastern Christian Studies at the University of Scranton in Scranton, Pennsylvania), counseling and offering spiritual direction to those who visited him, until his death.\n\nOn December 8, 1984, Ciszek died after many years of declining health, and was buried at the Jesuit Cemetery in Wernersville, Pennsylvania.\n\nNine audio tapes of interviews conducted with Ciszek (ca. 1964) remain at Georgetown University.\n\nIn 1985, a Carmelite nun, Mother Marija, who was the mother superior of a Ruthenian Rite Carmelite monastery which Fr. Ciszek helped found, and formerly under his spiritual direction, began to petition for official recognition of Fr. Ciszek and his work within the Catholic Church. In 1990, Bishop Michael J. Dudick of the Eparchy of Passaic, New Jersey, opened an official diocesan process of investigation for official recognition on the road to beatification, a step toward possible canonization as a saint. His case is currently being handled by the Diocese of Allentown, Pennsylvania.\n\nCiszek Hall at Fordham University in New York City is named after Fr. Ciszek. It currently houses Jesuit scholastics in the first stage of formal study for the priesthood. Additionally, a small room has been set aside in honor of Fr. Ciszek. It contains the (Latin) altar, sacred vessels, candle sticks, and crucifix Fr. Ciszek used, as well as a copy (in his own hand) of his final vows and a photocopy of a letter to a friend containing spiritual advice. There is also a Ciszek Hall at the University of Scranton. Shenandoah, Pennsylvania also commemorated his legacy by the founding of a Catholic elementary school named Father Walter J. Ciszek School, later renamed Trinity Academy at the Father Walter J. Ciszek Education Center.\n\n\n\n"}

Okada, who studied with Prince Chichibu (Yasuhito) and others who came from prominent Japanese families, graduated from the Japanese Army Officer Training School in 1922 and was commissioned a lieutenant in the Japanese Imperial Guard. After serving in military campaigns in China and Indochina, Okada retired from the army in 1941 due to a back injury with the rank of lieutenant colonel. \n\nYoshikazu Okada established the Mahikari organization in 1959, which became known as \"Sekai Mahikari Bunmei Kyodan\" in 1963, and assumed the name of \"Kōtama\" (\"Sphere of Light\"). \n\nIn 1974, with Okada's passing, there were court hearings held over several years. An amicable settlement was reached (wakai). Sakae Sekiguchi assumed leadership of Sekai Mahikari Bunmei Kyodan, and in 1978, Keishu Okada established Sukyo Mahikari.\n\n"}
