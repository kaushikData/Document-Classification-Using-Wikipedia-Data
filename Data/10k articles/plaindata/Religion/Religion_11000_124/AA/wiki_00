He became a social democrat in 1900 while still in high school, formally joining the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party in 1903. In 1904 Joffe was sent to Baku, which he had to flee to avoid arrest. He was then sent to Moscow, but had to flee again, this time abroad. After the events of Bloody Sunday on January 9, 1905, Joffe returned to Russia and took an active part in the Russian Revolution of 1905. In early 1906 he was forced to emigrate and lived in Berlin until his expulsion from Germany in May 1906.\n\nIn Russia, Joffe was close to the Menshevik faction within the Russian Social Democratic Party. However, after moving to Vienna in May 1906, he became close to Leon Trotsky's position and helped Trotsky edit \"Pravda\" from 1908 to 1912 while studying medicine and with Alfred Adler, psychoanalysis. He also used his family's fortune to support \"Pravda\" financially. During the course of his underground revolutionary activity Joffe adopted the party name \"V. Krymsky,\" the surname meaning \"The Crimean.\"\n\nIn 1912 Joffe was arrested while visiting Odessa, imprisoned for 10 months and then exiled to Siberia.\n\nIn 1917, Joffe, freed from the Siberian exile by the February Revolution, returned to the Crimea. Crimean social democrats sent him to the capital, Petrograd, to represent them, but he soon moved to an internationalist revolutionary position, which made it impossible for him to remain in an organization dominated by less radical Mensheviks. Instead, he joined forces with Trotsky, who had just returned from abroad.\n\nIn May 1917, Joffe and Trotsky temporarily joined Mezhraiontsy who merged with the Bolsheviks at the VIth Bolshevik Party Congress held between 26 July and 3 August 1917 (all dates are Old Style until February 1918). At the Congress, Joffe was elected a candidate (non-voting) member of the Central Committee, but two days later, on August 5, the Central Committee, some of whose members were in prison, in hiding or lived far from Petrograd and couldn't attend its meetings, made Joffe a member of its permanent (\"narrow\") bureau. On August 6, Joffe was made an alternate member of the Central Committee Secretariat and on August 20 made a member of the editorial board of the Bolshevik newspaper \"Pravda\" which was then temporarily called \"Proletary\" (\"Proletarian\") for legal reasons.\n\nJoffe headed the Bolshevik faction in the Petrograd Duma (city government) in the fall of 1917 and was one of the Duma's delegates to the Democratic Conference between September 14 and 22. Although Joffe, along with Lenin and Trotsky, opposed the Bolsheviks' participation in the consultative Pre-parliament created by the Democratic Conference, the motion was carried by the majority of Bolshevik deputies at the Democratic Conference and Joffe was made a Bolshevik member of the Pre-parliament. Two weeks later, on October 7, once the more radical Bolshevik faction gained the upper hand, Joffe and other Bolsheviks walked out of the Pre-parliament.\n\nIn October 1917, Joffe supported Lenin's and Trotsky's revolutionary position against Grigory Zinoviev's and Lev Kamenev's more moderate position, demanding that the latter be expelled from the Central Committee after an apparent breach of party discipline. Joffe served as the Chairman of the Petrograd Military Revolutionary Committee which overthrew the Russian Provisional Government on October 25–26, 1917. Immediately after the revolution, he supported Lenin and Trotsky against Zinoviev, Kamenev, Alexei Rykov and other Bolshevik Central Committee members who would have shared power with other socialist parties.\n\nFrom November 30, 1917, until January 1918, Joffe was the head of the Soviet delegation that was sent to Brest-Litovsk to negotiate an end to the hostilities with Germany. On December 22, 1917, Joffe announced the following Bolshevik pre-conditions for a peace treaty:\n\n\nAlthough Joffe had signed a ceasefire agreement with the Central Powers on December 2, 1917, he supported Trotsky in the latter's refusal to sign a permanent peace treaty in February. Once the Bolshevik Central Committee decided to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on February 23, 1918, Joffe remained a member of the Soviet delegation only under protest and in a purely consultative capacity. Grigori Yakovlovich Sokolnikov, leader of the signatory team, signed on behalf of Russia.\n\nRemembering Joffe's presence with the Bolshevik delegation at Brest-Litovsk, Count Ottokar Czernin, the Austro-Hungarians' representative would later write:\n\nThe leader of the Russian delegation is a Jew, named Joffe, who has recently been released from Siberia [...] after the meal I had a first conversation with Mr. Joffe. His whole theory is simply based on the universal application of the right of self-governance of nations in the broadest form. The thus liberated nations then have to be brought to love each other [...] I advised him that we would not attempt to imitate the Russian example and that we likewise would not tolerate a meddling in our internal affairs. If he continued to hold on his utopic viewpoints the peace would not be possible and then he would be well advised just to take the journey back with the next train. Mr. Joffe looked astonishedly at me with his gentle eyes and was silent for a while. Then he continued in a – for me, ever unforgettable – friendly, or I would even nearly say suppliant, tone: 'I very much hope that we will also be able to raise the revolution in your country...'\n\nAt the VIIth Extraordinary Congress of the Bolshevik Party between March 6 and March 8, 1918, Joffe was re-elected to the Central Committee, but only as a candidate (non-voting) member. He remained in Petrograd when the Soviet government moved to Moscow later in March and worked as a member of the Petrograd Bureau of the Central Committee until he was appointed Soviet representative to Germany in April. He signed the Soviet-German Supplementary Treaty on August 27, 1918. On November 6, 1918, literally days before the Armistice and the German Revolution, the Soviet delegation in Berlin headed by Joffe was expelled from the country on charges of preparing a Communist uprising in Germany.\n\nIn 1919–1920, Joffe was a member of the Council of Labor and Defense and People's Commissar (minister) of State Control of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic. He wasn't re-elected to the Central Committee at the VIII Party Congress in March 1919 and would never again occupy a major leadership position. He negotiated a ceasefire with Poland in October 1920 and peace treaties with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in late 1920. In 1921 he signed the Peace of Riga with Poland ending the Polish-Soviet War and was made deputy chairman of the Turkestan Commission of the VTsIK and Sovnarkom.\n\nJoffe was one of the Soviet delegates at the Genoa Conference in February 1922, an experience he described in a short book published later that same year. After the Soviet walkout, he was made ambassador to China, as the Soviet troubleshooter (or Kuznetsov) of those days. In 1923, Joffe signed an agreement with Sun Yat-Sen in Shanghai on aid to Kuomintang on the assumption that the latter would cooperate with Chinese Communists, presumably with Lenin's approval. While in China, Joffe traveled to Japan in June 1923 to settle Soviet-Japanese relations. The negotiations proved long and difficult and were aborted when Joffe became gravely ill and had to be sent back to Moscow. After a partial recovery, he served as a member of the Soviet delegation to Great Britain in 1924 and as Soviet representative in Austria in 1924–1926. \n\nIn 1926 his declining health and disagreements with the ruling Bolshevik faction forced his semi-retirement. He tried to concentrate on teaching, but it also proved difficult due to his illness.\n\nJoffe remained a friend and loyal supporter of Leon Trotsky through the 1920s, joining him in the Left Opposition. By late 1927, he was gravely ill, in extreme pain and confined to his bed. After a refusal by the Stalinist leadership of the Communist Party to send him abroad for treatment and Trotsky's expulsion from the Communist Party on November 12, 1927, he committed suicide on November 16. He left a farewell letter addressed to Trotsky, but the letter was seized by Soviet secret police agents and later quoted by Stalinists to discredit both Joffe and Trotsky. Trotsky's eulogy at Joffe's funeral was his last public speech in the Soviet Union.\n\nJoffe's wife Maria Joffe was arrested as a left-oppositionist Trotskyist by Stalin's security forces, yet she survived to write her memoirs \"One Long Night – A Tale of Truth\".\nJoffe's daughter, Nadezhda Joffe, also an active Trotskyist, survived Stalin's prisons and labor camps and published a memoir, \"Back in Time: My Life, My Fate, My Epoch\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "78363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=78363", "title": "Agdistis", "text": "Agdistis\n\nAgdistis () was a deity of Greek, Roman and Anatolian mythology, possessing both male and female sexual organs. She is closely associated with the Phrygian goddess Cybele. Her androgyny was seen as symbolic of a wild and uncontrollable nature. It was this trait which was threatening to the gods and ultimately led to her destruction.\n\nAccording to Pausanias, on one occasion Zeus unwittingly begot by the Earth a superhuman being which was at once man and woman, and was called Agdistis. In other versions, there was a rock, called \"Agdo\", on which the Great Mother slept. Zeus impregnated the Great Mother (Gaia), which brought forth Agdistis.\n\nThe gods were afraid of the multi-gendered Agdistis. One deity (in some versions Liber, in others Dionysus) put a sleeping draught in Agdistis's drinking well. After the potion had put Agdistis to sleep, Dionysus tied Agdistis's foot to his own male genitalia () with a strong rope. When Agdistis awoke and stood, Agdistis ripped his penis off, castrating himself. The blood from his severed genitals fertilized the earth, and from that spot grew an almond tree. Once when Nana, daughter of the river-god Sangarius, was gathering the fruit of this tree, she put some almonds (or, in some accounts, a pomegranate) into her bosom; but here the almonds disappeared, and she became pregnant with Attis. In some versions, Attis was born directly out of the almond.\n\nAttis was of such extraordinary beauty that when he had grown up Agdistis fell in love with him. His relatives, however, destined him to become the husband of the daughter of the king of Pessinus, and he went accordingly. In some versions, the king betroths Attis to his daughter to punish Attis for his incestuous relationship with his mother. At the moment when the marriage song had commenced, Agdistis appeared, and all the wedding guests were instantly driven mad, causing both Attis and the king of Pessinus to castrate themselves and the bride to cut off her breasts. Agdistis now repented her deed, and obtained from Zeus the promise that the body of Attis should not become decomposed or disappear. This is the most popular account of an otherwise mysterious affair, which is probably part of a symbolical worship of the creative powers of nature. A hill of the name of Agdistis in Phrygia, at the foot of which Attis was believed to be buried, is also mentioned by Pausanias.\n\nA story somewhat different is given by Arnobius, in which Attis is beloved by both Agdistis and Cybele.\n\nAccording to Hesychius and Strabo, Agdistis is the same as Cybele, who was worshiped at Pessinus under that name. In many ancient inscriptions, Agdistis is clearly distinct from Cybele, but in many others she is listed as merely an epithet of Cybele.\n\nAlthough primarily an Anatolian goddess, the cult of Agdistis covered a good deal of territory. By 250 BC it had spread to Egypt, and later to Attica: notably it could be found in Piraeus as early as the 3rd or 4th century BC, Rhamnus around 80 BC (where there was a sanctuary of Agdistis), and Lesbos and Panticapeum some time later on. Inscriptions honoring her have been found at Mithymna and Paros. In the 1st century BC, her shrine in Philadelphia in Asia Minor required a strict code of behavior. At that location and others she is found with \"theoi soteres\". Inscriptions found at Sardis from the 4th century BC indicate that priests of Zeus were not permitted to take part in the mysteries of Agdistis.\n\nScholars have theorized that Agdistis is part of a continuum of androgynous Anatolian deities, including an ancient Phrygian deity probably named \"Andistis\" and one called \"Adamma\", stretching all the way back to the ancient kingdom of Kizzuwatna in the 2nd millennium BC. There is also some epigraphic evidence that in places Agdistis was considered a healing goddess of wholly benevolent nature.\n\n\n"}

Her book, \"The Shaman In Stilettos\", chronicles her journey from celebrity interviewer, to apprentice to a Peruvian shaman in the High Andes, to becoming a London-based shaman in her own right.\n\nHunt was born into a small family in a village outside Southampton, England, and went to school at Cheltenham Ladies’ College. She read History at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where she was awarded an MA.\n\nHunt started her journalism career making television documentaries for the UK’s Channel 4, before moving into newspapers. She began as PA to the editor of \"The Daily Express\" and was promoted to launch editor of a weekend supplement that added one million readers to the paper’s circulation. Hunt left to establish herself as a celebrity interviewer, writing for \"The Daily Mail\", \"The Mail On Sunday\", \"The Independent On Sunday\", \"The Sunday Express\" and the BBC’s \"Radio Times\". By age 27, she was working full-time as features editor of \"The Mail On Sunday’s\" 'Night & Day' magazine, the highest-selling quality newspaper supplement in the UK.\n\nStress-induced health challenges that she says allopathic medicine couldn’t cure led Hunt to take a three-month sabbatical to Peru in 2003. There she met the shaman Maximo Morales, a former archeologist turned medicine man. Despite Hunt’s initial cynicism, Morales appeared to restore her health with a range of techniques that included the use of the entheogenic plants San Pedro and ayahuasca. The work was transformative for Hunt, and Morales invited her to study with him as his apprentice – an extraordinary invitation, as the ancient healing arts are traditionally passed down only from shaman to shaman, orally and in strict secrecy.\n\nTwo years later, Hunt returned to Peru to accept the offer. She spent six months studying with Morales and interviewing over forty shamans, travelling from the high Andes to the depths of the Amazon rainforest. She then returned to London to practise independently. In 2012, Penguin published an account of her experiences, \"The Shaman In Stilettos\", which the \"Daily Mail\" described as \"the English \"Eat Pray Love\"\".\n"}

The two are a couple, and possibly different aspects of the same being. They are supernatural shamans of the forest. In the Nepali language, \"ban\" means \"wilderness\", \"jhākri\" means \"shaman\", and \"jhākrini\" means \"shamaness\". Banjhākrini is also known as Lemlemey.\n\nBanjhākri is a short, wild, simian trickster who is a descendant of the Sun. His ears are large and his feet point backward. Long, matted hair covers his entire body, except for his face and palms, and he plays a golden dhyāngro. The dhyangro is the frame drum played by Nepali jhākri.\n\nBanjhākri finds human children who have the potential to be great shamans, and takes them back to his cave for training. There, the children are in danger of being eaten whole by Banjhākrini. Banjhākrini is both ursine and humanoid, with long hair on her head, long, pendulous breasts, and backward-pointing feet. She is usually described as bloodthirsty and brutal. She carries a symbolic golden sickle.\n\nAlthough Banjhākri abducts boys (and, by some accounts, girls), he does not do so out of malice. He trains the children who pass Banjhākrini's initiation. When the children return home with their shamanic training, they can become more powerful than the shamans trained by people.\n\nLike the yeti, Banjhākri and Banjhākrini can be seen in our world, and not just in the spirit world. However, only powerful shamans can see them. Although both Banjhākri and yeti are apelike, yeti are taller than humans, whereas Banjhākri is only about 1–1.5 metres (3–5 feet) tall.\n\nA scholar has suggested that Banjhākri is a therianthrope; a humanoid who changes into a non-human animal form.\n\nSome legends say that there are numerous ban-jhākri and ban-jhākrini. In any case, the shamans of Nepal regard the original Banjhākri as the founder of Nepali shamanism. Banjhākri is revered and celebrated as a teacher and as the god of the forest.\n\n"}

Their timber was used by the Phoenicians, Israelites, Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Romans, and Turks. The wood was prized by Egyptians for shipbuilding; the Ottoman Empire used the cedars in railway construction.\n\nThe mountains of Lebanon were once shaded by thick cedar forests and the tree is the symbol of the country. After centuries of persistent deforestation, the extent of these forests has been markedly reduced.\n\nIt was once said that a battle occurred between the demigods and the humans over the beautiful and divine forest of Cedar trees near southern Mesopotamia. This forest, once protected by the Sumerian god Enlil, was completely bared of its trees when humans entered its grounds 4700 years ago, after winning the battle against the guardians of the forest, the demigods. The story also tells that Gilgamesh used cedar wood to build his city.\n\nOver the centuries, cedar wood was exploited by the Phoenicians, Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Romans, Israelites and Turks. The Phoenicians used the Cedars for their merchant fleets. They needed timbers for their ships and the Cedar woods made them the “first sea trading nation in the world”. The Egyptians used cedar resin for the mummification process and the cedar wood for some of “their first hieroglyph bearing rolls of papyrus”. In the Bible, Solomon procured cedar timber to build the Temple in Jerusalem. The emperor Hadrian claimed these forests as an imperial domain, and destruction of the cedar forests was temporarily halted.\n\nConcern for the biblical \"cedars of God\" goes back to 1876, when the grove was surrounded by a high stone wall, paid for by Queen Victoria, to protect saplings from browsing by goats. Nevertheless, during World War I, British troops used cedar to build railroads.\n\nTime, along with the exploitation of the Cedars’ wood, has led to a decrease in the number of cedar trees in Lebanon. However, Lebanon is still widely known for its cedar tree history, as they are the emblem of the country and the symbol of the Lebanese flag. The remaining trees survive in mountainous areas, where they are the dominant tree species. This is the case on the slopes of Mount Makmel that tower over the Kadisha Valley, where the Cedars of God are found at an altitude of more than . Four trees have reached a height of , with their trunks reaching .\n\nIn 1998, the Cedars of God were added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.\n\nThe forest is rigorously protected. It is possible to tour it escorted by an authorized guide. After a preliminary phase in which the land was cleared of detritus, the sick plants treated, and the ground fertilized, the \"Committee of the Friends of the Cedar Forest\" initiated a reforestation program in 1985. These efforts will only be appreciable in a few decades due to the slow growth of cedars. In these areas the winter offers incredible scenery, and the trees are covered with a blanket of snow.\n\nThe Cedar Forest of ancient Mesopotamian religion appears in several sections of the Epic of Gilgamesh.\n\nThe Lebanon Cedar is frequently mentioned in the Bible. Example verses include:\n\nAlphonse de Lamartine visited the place during his travel in Lebanon (1832–33), and mentioned the cedars in some texts. Henry Bordeaux came also in 1922 and wrote, \"Yamilé\", a story about the place.\n\n\n"}

She is a popular goddess in the city of Pekalongan, Central Java. Her name \"Lanjar\" means a woman who is divorced but still have no children.\n\nThe people of Pekalongan in particular still have a strong belief of Dewi Lanjar. For example, if a child goes missing at the beach, people believe that the child was taken by Dewi Lanjar. It is said that her palace is located on the beach of Pekalongan, next to the Slamaran river. \n\nIn ancient times in Pekalongan there lived a beautiful princess named Dewi Rara Kuning. She has been a widow at a very young age because her husband died some time after their marriage. That is why Dewi Rara Kuning is then known as Dewi Lanjar. Because of this, Dewi Lanjar decided to leave his hometown to avoid being constantly consumed with grief.\n\nOn arrival at the river Opak, she met the King of Mataram Panembahan Senopati together with Mahapatih Singaranu. Dewi Lanjar expressed her heart and said she would never marry again. Panembahan Senopati and Mahapatih Singoranu, both feeling pity, advised her to go to the South Beach and face the Queen of the Southern Sea. Then they parted. Dewi Lanjar headed towards the South Beach. He meditated diligently then moksa and met with Queen of the Southern Sea.\n\nDuring the meeting, Dewi Lanjar begged the Queen to be her child which she did not mind. One day, Dewi Lanjar with the jinn troops was commanded to disrupt and prevent Raden Bahu from opening Gambiren forest (now located around the bridge of Pekalongan and Sorogenen village). However, Raden Bahu was unaffected by the temptations of Dewi Lanjar and the jinn. Unable to fulfill the task, Dewi Lanjar decided not to return to the South Beach, but requested permission to Raden Bahu to be able to reside in Pekalongan. It is approved by both Raden Bahu and even the Queen of Southern Sea. Dewi Lanjar was allowed to stay and rule the North Beach especially in Pekalongan, Central Java.\n"}

Among scholars, the earlier cuneiform reading of this name, \"Ensuhgirana\", still enjoys currency alongside the more recent reading of it as \"Ensuhkeshdanna\". The introduction also gives the name of Ensuhkeshdanna's chief minister, \"Ansigaria\", and Enmerkar's chief minister, \"Namena-tuma\". Enmerkar is the Lord of both Unug and Kulaba, described as the \"city which rises from heaven to earth\" [sic].\n\nFollowing this introduction, the plot opens with Ensuhkeshdanna dictating a message to his envoy, to be taken to Unug, demanding Enmerkar submit to Aratta, and boasting that his connections with the goddess Inanna are superior to those of Enmerkar.\n\nThe envoy having traveled to Unug and delivered this message, Enmerkar responds that Inanna stays at the temple with him, and that she will not even go to Aratta for five or ten years; he responds to Ensuhkeshdanna's boasts with a number of creative sexual taunts of his own (\"even though she is not a duckling, she shrieks like one.\")\n\nWhen the messenger returns to Aratta with this message, Ensuhkeshdanna is perplexed and feels defeated. His counselors advise him to back off from confrontation with Enmerkar. However, he vows never to submit to Enmerkar, even if Aratta be utterly destroyed.\n\nAt this point, a sorcerer named Urgirinuna comes to Aratta, after his homeland of Hamazi has been vanquished. Urgirinuna promises the chief minister, Ansigaria, that he can make Enmerkar submit to Aratta. Ansigaria agrees to fund this mission, and the sorcerer then proceeds to Eresh, the city of Nisaba, where he somehow manages to sabotage the dairy livestock of Enmerkar.\n\nThis act of the sorcerer's sabotage was observed by the livestock keepers, Mashgula and Uredina, who then pray to Utu, the sun god, for help. A sorceress of Eresh called \"Wise Woman Sagburu\" then appears, and outperforms Urgirinuna's sorcery in a series of contests: each time Urgirinuna magically brings an animal from the water by casting in fish eggs, she brings a predator from the water in the same way, which then eats the animals he produces. Having defeated him with superior magic, she refuses to spare his life, and casts him into the Euphrates.\n\nWhen Ensuhkeshdanna hears of this, he admits defeat and submits to Enmerkar. The remainder of the text is too fragmentary to interpret.\n\n"}
{"id": "16147996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16147996", "title": "Freedom of religion in Lebanon", "text": "Freedom of religion in Lebanon\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion and the freedom to practice all religious rites provided that the public order is not disturbed. The Constitution declares equality of rights and duties for all citizens without discrimination or preference but establishes a balance of power among the major religious groups. The Government generally respected these rights; however, there were some restrictions, and the constitutional provision for apportioning political offices according to religious affiliation may be viewed as inherently discriminatory. There were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice. There were, however, periodic reports of tension between religious groups, attributable to competition for political power, and citizens continued to struggle with the legacy of a 15-year civil war that was fought largely along sectarian lines. Despite sectarian tensions caused by the competition for political power, churches, mosques, and other places of worship continued to exist side-by-side, extending a centuries-long national heritage as a place of refuge for those fleeing religious intolerance.\n\nThe country, founded as a modern state in 1943, has a population of over 6 million. Because parity among confessional groups remains a sensitive issue, a national census has not been conducted since 1932. However, the most recent demographic study conducted by Statistics Lebanon, a Beirut-based research firm, found that approximately Lebanon's population is estimated to be 54% Muslim (27% Shia; 27% Sunni), 5.6% Druze, who do not consider themselves to be Muslims but under the Lebanese political division (Parliament of Lebanon Seat Allocation) the Druze community is designated as one of the five Lebanese Muslim communities (Sunni, Shia, Druze, Alawi, and Ismaili); 40.4% Christian (21% Maronite, 8% Greek Orthodox, 5% Melkite, 1% Protestant and 4 percent Armenian, 1 percent other Christians. There are also very small numbers of Jews, Bahá'ís, Mormons, Buddhists, and Hindus.\n\nOf the 18 officially recognized religious groups, 4 are Muslim, 12 Christian, 1 Druze, and 1 Jewish. The main branches of Islam are Shi'a and Sunni. The smallest Muslim communities are the Shia offshoots like Alawites and the Ismaili (\"Sevener\") Shi'a order. The Maronite community, by far the largest Christian group, has had a centuries-long affiliation with the Roman Catholic Church but has its own patriarch, liturgy, and ecclesiastical customs. The second largest Christian group is the Greek Orthodox Church who maintain a Greek-language liturgy. Other Lebanese Christians are also Melkite Catholics, Protestant Christians like evangelicals (including Protestant groups such as the Baptists and Seventh-day Adventists), and Latins (Roman Catholic). Other non-native to Lebanon Christian groups are divided among Armenian Orthodox (Gregorians), Armenian Catholics, Syriac Orthodox (Jacobites), Syriac Catholics, Assyrians (Nestorians), Chaldean, and Copts. The Lebanese Druze, who refer to themselves as al-Muwahhideen, or \"believers in one God,\" are concentrated in the rural, mountainous areas east and south of Beirut. Divisions and rivalries between various groups date back many centuries, and while relationships between religious adherents of different confessions were generally amicable, group identity was highly significant in most aspects of cultural interaction.\n\nForeign missionaries present in the country operated missions, schools, hospitals, and places of worship.\n\nMany persons fleeing religious mistreatment and discrimination in neighboring states have immigrated to the country, including Kurds, Shi'a, and Assyrians/Chaldeans from Iraq, as well as Copts from Egypt, Sudan and Libya. Precise figures were unavailable due to the lack of census data and the tendency of these groups to assimilate into the culture.\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion and the freedom to practice all religious rites provided that public order is not disturbed. The Constitution requires the state to respect all religions and denominations and guarantee respect for the personal status and religious interests of persons of every religious sect. The Constitution declares equality of rights and duties for all citizens without discrimination or preference but stipulates a balance of power distributed among the major religious groups. The Government generally respected these rights in practice; however, there were some restrictions, and the constitutional provision for apportioning political offices according to religious affiliation may be viewed as inherently discriminatory.\n\nThe Government permits recognized religious groups to exercise authority over matters pertaining to personal status, such as marriage, divorce, child custody, and inheritance. The \"Twelver\" Shi'a, Sunni, Christian, and Druze confessions have state-appointed, government-subsidized clerical courts that administer family and personal status law.\n\nThe Constitution provides that Lebanese Christians and Lebanese Muslims be represented equally in Parliament, the Cabinet, and high-level civil service positions, which include the ministry ranks of Secretary General and Director General. It also provides that these posts be distributed proportionally among the recognized religious groups. The constitutional provision for the distribution of political power and positions according to the principle of religious representation is designed to prevent a dominant position being gained by any one confessional group. The \"National Pact\" of 1943 stipulates that the president, prime minister, and speaker of parliament be Maronite Christian, Sunni Muslim, and Shi'a Muslim, respectively. This distribution of political power functions at both the national and local levels of government.\n\nThe 1989 Taif Agreement, which ended the country's 15-year civil war, reaffirmed this arrangement but, significantly, mandated increased Muslim representation in Parliament so that it would be equal to that of the Christian community and reduced the power of the Christian Maronite presidency. In addition, the Taif Agreement, which concluded the country's 15-year civil war, endorsed the constitutional provision of appointing most senior government officials according to religious affiliation. This practice is operative in all three branches of government. The Taif Agreement also stipulated a cabinet with power equally allocated between Muslims and Christians. The political establishment has been reluctant to change this \"confessional\" system, because citizens perceive it as critical to the country's stability.\n\nFormal recognition by the Government is a legal requirement for religious groups to conduct most religious activities. A group that seeks official recognition must submit a statement of its doctrine and moral principles for government review to ensure that such principles do not contradict popular values or the Constitution. The group must ensure that the number of its adherents is sufficient to maintain its continuity.\n\nAlternatively, religious groups may apply for recognition through recognized religious groups. Official recognition conveys certain benefits, such as tax-exempt status and the right to apply the religion's codes to personal status matters. An individual may change religions if the head of the religious group the person wishes to join approves of this change. Refusal is not reported to occur in practice. Religion is encoded on national identity cards and noted on ikhraaj qaid (official registry) documents, and the Government complies with requests of citizens to change their civil records to reflect their new religious status.\n\nSome religious groups do not enjoy official recognition, such as Bahá'ís, Buddhists, Hindus, and unregistered Protestant Christian groups. They are disadvantaged under the law in that their members do not qualify for certain government positions, but they are permitted to perform their religious rites freely. For example, a Bahá'í cannot run for Parliament as a Bahá'í candidate because there is no seat allocated for the confession, nor could such an individual hold senior positions in the Government, as these are also allocated on a confessional basis. However, a number of members of unregistered religious groups are recorded under the recognized religions. For example, most Bahá'ís are registered under the Shi'a sect. As such, a member of the Bahá'í community can run for office and fill a seat allocated to the Shi'a sect. Similarly, Mormons are registered under the Greek Orthodox faith. Government decisions on granting official recognition of religious groups do not appear to be arbitrary.\n\nThe Government permits the publication in different languages of religious materials of every registered religion.\n\nThe Government recognizes the following holy days as national holidays: Armenian Christmas, Eid al-Adha, St. Maroun Day, Islamic New Year, Ashura, Good Friday, Easter (both Western and Eastern rites), the birth of the Prophet Muhammad, All Saints' Day, Feast of the Assumption, Eid al-Fitr, and Christmas. The Government also excuses Armenian public sector employees from work on St. Vartan Day.\n\nThe 1989 Ta'if Agreement called for the eventual elimination of political sectarianism in favor of \"expertise and competence;\" however, little progress has been made in this regard.\n\nUnrecognized groups, such as Bahá'ís, Buddhists, Hindus, and some evangelical denominations, may own property and assemble for worship without government interference; however, they are disadvantaged under the law because legally they may not marry, divorce, or inherit property in the country. Protestant evangelical churches are required to register with the Evangelical Synod, a nongovernmental advisory group that represents those churches with the Government. It is self-governing and oversees religious matters for Protestant congregations. Representatives of some churches have complained that the Synod has refused to accept new Protestant groups into its membership since 1975, thereby crippling their clergy's ability to minister to the members of those communities.\n\nMany families have relatives who belong to different religious communities, and intermarriage is not uncommon; however, intermarriage is difficult to arrange in practice between members of some groups. Shari'a, which applies to personal status matters of Muslims, forbids the marriage of a non-Muslim male to a Muslim woman. Druze religious leaders will perform marriages only of Druze couples. There are no procedures for civil marriage; however, the Government recognizes civil marriage ceremonies performed outside the country.\n\nProselytizing (or converting people to another religion), while it is not punishable by law, it is strongly discouraged by religious leaders and communities, sometimes with the threat of violence. The respective sect's leadership councils make appointments to senior clerical posts. For example, the nomination of Sunni and Shi'a muftis is officially endorsed by the Government's Council of Ministers, and they receive monthly salaries from the Government. The Government appoints and pays the salaries of Muslim and Druze ecclesiastical judges. The leaders of other religious groups, such as Roman Catholics and Greek Orthodox, do not receive salaries from the Government.\n\nThe Government does not require citizens' religious affiliations to be indicated on their passports; however, religious affiliation is encoded on national identity cards and noted on ikhraaj qaid documents. The ikhraj qaid, a civil document that indicates personal status information, can be presented by citizens instead of an identity card when they apply for various purposes, such as to obtain government employment or to enroll in or be employed at a university.\n\nIn most cases religious groups administer their own family and personal status laws. Many of these laws discriminate against women. For example, Sunni inheritance law provides a son twice the inheritance of a daughter. Although Muslim men may divorce easily, Muslim women may do so only with the concurrence of their husbands.\n\nArticle 473 of the Penal Code of Lebanon stipulates a maximum prison term of 1 year for anyone convicted of \"blaspheming God publicly.\" There were no prosecutions reported under this law during the reporting period.\n\nStudents and teachers found to be working while on tourist visas are deemed to have violated their visa status and are consequently deported. The same sanction applies to religious workers not working under the auspices of a government-registered religious organization.\n\nThere were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country.\n\nThere were no reports of forced religious conversion within Lebanon.\n\nA permanent search warrant remained in effect for the 2002 killing of an American citizen missionary affiliated with the Christian and Missionary Evangelical Alliance in Sidon, although the case was officially closed in April 2004. Investigations at the time of the killing suggested that Sunni extremists, possibly operating from the nearby Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp, were responsible.\n\n\n"}

It was released on 16 June 2016 as the lead single from their second studio album, \"Wild World\" (2016). The song was written by Dan Smith, who handled the production along with Mark Crew. It is their first single released to feature new touring member Charlie Barnes.\n\nOn 16 June 2016, Annie Mac debuted \"Good Grief\" on her BBC Radio 1 show as the \"hottest track.\" Following the debut, the band released the single to radio and as a digital download.\n\nGeorgia Ivey of \"Clash\" said that the song was \"surprisingly upbeat considering its reflection on the grieving process.\" Sarah Jamieson of \"DIY\" called the track a tone-appropriate album opener, saying that its \"pomp and grandeur juxtaposed perfectly with Dan Smith’s dark-tinged tale of coping with life after death.\" \"NME\" writer Charlotte Gunn described it as \"a euphoric pop track about death and funerals and being sad, but done Bastille-style, with a massive chorus and an X Factor-worthy key change.\" In his review of the album, Andy Baber of musicOMH felt the song was a \"misleading introduction\" to the record's various political themes, but said that it establishes the band's \"move towards the more eclectic approach favoured on their mixtapes – as evidenced by the sampling of Kelly Le Brock from ‘80s movie \"Weird Science\".\"\n\nThe video for \"Good Grief\" debuted on 22 June 2016. In addition to Smith's disembodied head, the video also features a burning house, a bank robbery, a running man, a teddy bear, rollerskating girls, a red car, a payphone, a game show, and scenes depicting nudity.

{"id": "9903486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9903486", "title": "Governmental lists of cults and sects", "text": "Governmental lists of cults and sects\n\nThe application of the labels \"cults\" or \"sects\" to (for example) religious movements in government documents usually signifies the popular and negative use of the term \"cult\" in English and a functionally similar use of words translated as \"sect\" in several European languages. Government reports which have used these words include ones from Austria,\nBelgium,\nCanada, China, France, Germany, and Russia. While these documents utilize similar terminology they do not necessarily include the same groups nor is their assessment of these groups based on agreed criteria. Other governments and world bodies also report on new religious movements but do not use these terms to describe them.\n\nThe Austrian government does not always distinguish sects in Austria as a separate group. Rather, religious groups are divided into three legal categories: officially recognized religious societies, religious confessional communities, and associations. In 2010, the most recent year for which sects were officially distinguished in Austria, the groups included the Church of Scientology, the Unification Church, the Divine Light Mission, Eckankar, Hare Krishna, Osho movement, Sahaja Yoga, Sai Baba, Sri Chinmoy, Transcendental Meditation, Fiat Lux, Universal Life, and The Family International.\n\nA Canadian Security Intelligence Service report of 1999 discussed \"Doomsday Religious Movements espousing hostile beliefs and having the potential to be violent..\" Groups classified as \"Doomsday Religious Movements\" included:\n\n\nIn 2005, the Hate Crimes Unit of the Edmonton Police Service confiscated anti-Falun Gong materials distributed at the annual conference of the American Family Foundation by staff members of the Calgary Chinese Consulate (Province of Alberta, Canada). The materials, including the calling of Falun Gong a \"cult,\" were identified as having breached the Criminal Code, which bans the wilful promotion of hatred against identifiable religious groups.\n\nThe General Office of Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China maintains a list of \"heterodox teachings,\" (邪教) entitled \"Information Regarding the Organizations Already Identified as Cults.\"\n\nAmong the Christian-based groups listed one of the best known is Zhao Weishan's Eastern Lightning. The followers of Watchman Nee (the Local Churches, or original Shouters) are said to be the first group put on the list, in 1983. Other Christian-based groups on the list include: The splinter groups of Li Changshou's original Difang Jiaohui, known as the Huhanpai (He Enjie's Changshouzhu jiao, Chinese Shouters), include Zhao Weishan's Eastern Lightning (also Actual God, Shijishen, 实际神), Wu Yangming's Beili Wang (Established King), and Liu Jiaguo's Lord God Sect. Other groups unrelated to the Shouters include Hua Xuehe's Lingling Sect, Xu Yongze's All Scope Church or Born Again Movement (BAM) and its offshoot Gong Shengliang's Huanan jiaohui South China Church, Li Sanbao's Mentuhui or Tudihui (Disciples Church), Xu Wenku's Sanban Puren Pai (Three Ranks of Service), Wu Huanxing's Cold Water Sect (Lengshui jiao), Liang Jiangye's Commune Sect (Fanwugongyongpai), the New Testament Church (China) founded by Hong Kong movie actress Jiang Duanyi then led by Zhang Lude and Zuo Kun as the Taiwan Apostles Faith Church (Shitu Xinxinhui), the Resurrection Way Fuhuodao of Guo Guangxu and Wen Qiuhui, as well as offshoots of Korean Christian new religious movements:The Unification Church of Rev. Moon, Dami Evangelism Association, and the World Elijah Evangelism Association.\n\nBuddhist-based proscribed sects include Lu Shengyan's Taiwan-based Lingxian Zhenfozong (灵仙真佛宗, True Buddha School), Ching Hai's Guanyin Famen, and Yuandun Famen.\n\nIn 1995, a parliamentary commission of the National Assembly of France on cults produced its report (in French: compare an unofficial English translation). The report included a list of purported cults based upon information which may have been provided by former members, the general information division of the French National Police (\"Renseignements généraux\" — the French secret police service) and cult-watching groups.\n\nThe criteria chosen by the French Renseignements généraux to establish the potential dangers of a movement were criticized since they were considered vague and may include many organizations, religious or not. One of the first criticisms came from bishop Jean Vernette, the national secretary of the French episcopate to the study of cults and new religious movements, who stressed that these criteria can be applied to almost all religions. Moreover, sociologists such as Bruno Étienne emphasized that the mental manipulation should not be defined by the policemen of the Renseignements généraux. The list of cults was based on the criteria defined by the Renseignements généraux, but without specifying which of their practices are specifically criticized. In addition, the secrecy of the work made by the RG led to questions about the presence or absence of certain organizations in the list. Étienne questioned the presence of the CEDIPAC SA company, formerly known as European Grouping of Marketing Professionals (GEPM), as its activity is not in the religious field. The absence of Opus Dei or the Freemasons also raised questions. In 2007, Yves Bertrand, General Director of the Renseignements généraux from 1992 to 2003, spoke about his collaborative work with the parliamentary reports on cults, and said: \"Alongside genuine and dangerous cults practicing removal of school, abuse of weakness or pedophilia, some groups have been a bit quickly dress up of the word cult\". Furthermore, on 27 May 2005, the 1995 list of cults of the French report was officially cancelled and invalidated by Jean-Pierre Raffarin's circulaire.\n\nIn France, Antoinism was classified as a cult in the 1995 parliamentary reports which considered it one of the oldest healer groups. However, in a 1984 letter, the French Minister of the Interior wrote that the movement was considered, from an administrative point of view, as having for exclusive purpose the exercise of a religion, thus complying with the 18th and 19th Articles of the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State. He added that antoinism had always been allowed to receive bequests or donations, which meant that its religious nature was never challenged. In addition, many anti-cults activists, associations or watchers said they had not noticed cultic deviances in this group. For example, when heard by the Belgian commission on cults, philosopher Luc Nefontaine said that \"the establishment of a directory of cult movements (...) seems to him dangerous, because it would also give a bad image of quite honourable organizations such as (...) Antoinism\". Eric Brasseur, director of Centre for information and advice on harmful cultish organizations (Centre d'information et d'avis sur les organisations sectaires nuisibles, or CIAOSN) said: \"This is a Belgian worship for which we have never had a complaint in 12 years, a rare case to report\". Similarly, in 2013, the Interministerial Mission for Monitoring and Combatting Cultic Deviances (Mission interministérielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les dérives sectaires, or MIVILUDES) made this comment: \"We have never received reporting from Antoinists. They heal through prayer, but as long as they do not prevent people from getting proper treatment by legal means...\" In addition, the Renseignements généraux stopped monitoring the religion given the absence of any problem. In 2002, the national service \"Pastoral, sects and new beliefs\" (\"Pastorale, sectes et nouvelles croyances\"), which analyses new religious movements from a catholic point of view, wrote about Antoinism: \"Although listed among the cults in the 1995 Parliamentary Report, it has no cultish feature.\" Similarly, the French sociologist Régis Dericquebourg, who deeply studied the religion, concluded that Antoinism is not a cult: it \"has no totalitarian influence on its members, and do not dictate their behaviour to get in the world; it is not exclusive [and] shows no hostility towards social systems\".\n\nIn France, the 1995 parliamentary report listed the Shri Ram Chandra Mission. This has been criticized by lawyer Lawrence Hincker, who said that \"this system of meditation, called Sahaj Marg, does not lead to a life away from the world. It integrates all aspects of man, whether physical, mental or spiritual, without charge or austerity or penance or self-negation\". According to the sociologist Bruno Étienne, an expert on religious issues, the SRCM publishes books as any other group but does not proselytize, and has never been convicted: \"To us, it is fully a NMR (new religious movement), modern religious group, although based on an ancient tradition, and subject to serious arguments advanced by others more knowledgeable, we do not understand why it is criticized on the list of the damned\". Raphaël Liogier, Director of the Observatory of religious and university professor at the Institut d'Études Politiques in Aix-en-Provence, said he did not understand the inclusion on the cult list of an association that is fully recognized in India.\n\nIn May 2005 the then Prime Minister of France, in a \"circulaire\", which stressed that the government must exercise vigilance concerning the cult phenomenon, said that the list of movements attached to the Parliamentary Report of 1995 had become less pertinent, based on the observation that many small groups had formed: scattered, more mobile, and less-easily identifiable, and that the government needed to balance its concern with cults with respect for public freedoms and laïcité (secularism).\n\nThe French Parliamentary report of 1999 on cults and money concentrated its attention on some 30 groups which it judged as major players in respect of their financial influence. It underlined the non-exhaustive character of its investigations, seeing them as a snapshot at a point in time and based on information available.\n\nThe groups examined included:\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and International Development has officially described the Auvers-sur-Oise-based People's Mujahedin of Iran as an organization with \"cultic nature\".\n\nAn official report of a Senate Committee of the city and state of Berlin in Germany listed and discussed cults (), emphasizing with its sub-title their categorization as \"entities espousing a world view and new religions\". The 1997 Berlin Senate report — entitled \"Cults: Risks and Side-effects: Information on selected new religious and world-view espousing Movements and Psycho-offerings\" — subdivided \"selected suppliers\" (\"ausgewählte Anbieter\") of its objects of interest as:\nIn 1996 the Parliament of the Russian Federation published analytical information on cults in \"О национальной угрозе России со стороны деструктивных религиозных организаций\" [Concerning the national threat to Russia from destructive religious organizations].\n\nIn 2008 the Russian Interior Ministry prepared a list of \"extremist groups\". At the top of the list appeared Islamic groups outside of \"traditional Islam\", which is supervised by the Russian government. Next listed were \"Pagan cults\".\n\nIn 2009 the Russian Ministry of Justice set up a council which it named \"Council of Experts Conducting State Religious Studies Expert Analysis\". The new council listed 80 large sects which it considered potentially dangerous to Russian society, and mentioned that there were thousands of smaller ones.\nLarge sects listed included: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Jehovah's Witnesses, and what were called \"neo-Pentecostals\".\n\n"}
{"id": "4649794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4649794", "title": "Helatrobus", "text": "Helatrobus\n\nAccording to Church of Scientology doctrine, Helatrobus was an \"interplanetary nation\", now extinct, which existed trillions of years ago.\n\nIn his \"State of OT\" lecture, Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard described them as:\n\"a little pipsqueak government, didn't amount to very much.\" \nThis same description also appears in the \"Dianetics and Scientology Technical Dictionary\" (first edition, pg. 196). The official insignia of Helatrobus was a gold cross, \"like the American Red Cross or something of the sort.\"\n\nIn the HCO Bulletin of April 17, AD13 (\"Aircraft Door Goals\"), Hubbard states that the total life span of the Helatrobus government was between 52 trillion and 38 trillion years\nago.\n\nDespite Hubbard's description of them as small and insignificant, he attributed to the Helatrobans a set of \"implants\", including the Heaven Implants, given 43 trillion years before the present, (SHSBC tapes 294, 295 and 300 - #s 6305C21, 6305C23\nand 6306C11) and the Gorilla Goals, created \"between about 319 trillion years ago to about 256 trillion trillion years ago\" (or 89 trillion trillion years ago, according to a different lecture). (\"Routine 3N: Line Plots\", HCOB 14 July 1963).\n\nHubbard also discoursed on another set of \"Helatrobus Implants\", located \"382 trillion years ago to 52 trillion years ago\". In a series of lectures, Hubbard gives further detail:\nPlanets were surrounded suddenly by radioactive cloud masses. And very often a long time before the planet came under attack from these implant people, waves of radioactive clouds, Magellanic clouds, black and gray, would sweep over and engulf the planet, and it would be living in an atmosphere of radioactivity, which was highly antipathetic to the living beings, bodies, plants, anything else that was on this planet.\nAnd so planetary systems would become engulfed in radioactive masses, gray and black. And the earmarks of such a planetary action was gray and black – gray towering masses of clouds. These Magellanic clouds would not otherwise have come anywhere near a planetary system.(\"State of OT\")\n\nWhen a planet was engulfed, the Helatrobans attacked it with \"little orange-colored bombs that would talk\", and the clouds themselves would speak: \"And here you'd have a gray cloud going by and it'd be saying, 'Hark! Hark! Hark!' you see? 'Watch out! Look out! Who's there? Who's that?'\".\n\nPeople on the planet's surface would be kidnapped using a small capsule \"placed at will in space. It shot out a large bubble, the being would grab at the bubble or strike at it and be sucked at once into the capsule. Then the capsule would be retracted into an aircraft.\" A victim was implanted for up to six months and the Helatrobans would \"fix him on a post in a big bunch of stuff ... put him on a post and wobbled him around and ran him through this implant of goals on a little monowheel [sic]. Little monowheel pole trap. And it had the effigy of a body on it.\" (\"State of OT\").\n\nRalph Hilton, a Free Zone Scientologist, has been researching Hubbard's teachings about the Helatrobus implants and publishes information about them. The Free Zone Scientologists seek to make Scientology's inner teachings public, and to bypass control of this information by the Church as run today by David Miscavige. Hilton lists the Helatrobus Implant goals on his website and they include such fundamental things as \"To forget\", \"To remember\", and \"To Know\", but also such specific things as \"To be dead\", \"To be God\", \"To have entities\", and \"To be a vampire\".\n\nCritics have noted many scientific implausibilities connected with the story of Helatrobus. Peter Forde's paper \"A Scientific Scrutiny of OT III\" (which also covers Scientologists' belief in the ancient galactic ruler Xenu) analyzes the matter in detail.\n\nContrary to Hubbard's statements, the Magellanic Clouds are dwarf galaxies seemingly orbiting our own Milky Way, and are not clouds at all in any atmospheric sense.

Most of these settlers arrive in Fiji via Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe population of Fiji is 905,949 (July 2006 estimate) with approximately 60 Jews. In addition, there are close to 300 people of Jewish descent living in the Fiji Islands, principally in the capital city of Suva. There are currently three cemeteries in Fiji, located in Momi (private cemetery), Ovalau Island (Levuka), and Suva (old cemetery) with Jewish inscriptions on the tombstones, dating back to the first Jewish settlers in the 19th century.\n\nOne of the early settlers was a merchant by the name Alexander Schmerrill Bowman (Hebrew name Alexander ben Shmuel) who was born on 9 Jan 1847 in Schneidemuhle, Prussia,(modern day Pila in Poland) and died 1909 in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Bowman was of the firm Bowman and Abrahams of Levuka and Lomaloma. When he settled in Levuka, the former Capital of Fiji, he married Sara Annette Solomon on 25 July 1877 in Levuka, Fiji. She was the daughter of Phillip Solomon and Catherine Cohen. She was born 27 September 1857 in Auckland, New Zealand, and died 1915 in Sydney.\n\nAnother well-known figure was a 20-year-old Henry Marks who arrived in 1881 from Australia. Marks laid the foundation of what became one of the most extensive commercial enterprises in the Western Pacific.\n\nUntil the recent establishment of the Fiji Jewish Association there was little organized activity among the Jewish population. There remains limited religious life among these Jews. The Israeli Embassy holds an annual Passover Seder, which accommodates 50 to 60 people.Kosher food is imported from Australia.\n\nIsrael and Fiji enjoy full diplomatic relations. In May 2002, the then Fiji Prime Minister, Laisenia Qarase, himself of partial Jewish ancestry, agreed with the Israeli Ambassador, H. E. Ruth Kahanoff that the two countries should strengthen their ties though they are so far apart geographically. While there is an Israeli Embassy in Fiji, the Israeli Ambassador in Canberra, Australia represents Israeli interests in Fiji.\n\n\n"}

He is known for playing himself in the sitcom \"Seinfeld\", which he created and wrote with Larry David. As a stand-up comedian, Seinfeld specializes in observational comedy; in 2005, Comedy Central named Seinfeld the \"12th Greatest Stand-up Comedian of All Time.\"\n\nSeinfeld produced, co-wrote and starred in the 2007 film \"Bee Movie\". In 2010, he premiered a reality series called \"The Marriage Ref\", which aired for two seasons on NBC. He is the creator and host of the web series \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee\".\n\nSeinfeld was born in Brooklyn, New York City. His father, Kálmán Seinfeld (1918–1985) was of Hungarian Jewish descent, and collected jokes that he heard while serving in World War II. His mother, Betty (née Hosni; 1915–2014), was of Syrian Jewish descent; her parents, Selim and Salha Hosni, were from Aleppo. His second-cousin is musician and actor Evan Seinfeld. Seinfeld grew up in Massapequa, New York, and attended Massapequa High School on Long Island. At the age of 16, he spent time volunteering in Kibbutz Sa'ar in Israel.\n\nHe attended State University of New York at Oswego, transferring after his second year to Queens College, City University of New York, graduating with a degree in communications and theater.\n\nSeinfeld developed an interest in stand-up comedy after brief stints in college productions. He appeared on open-mic nights at Budd Friedman's Improv Club while attending Queens College. After graduation in 1976, he tried out at an open-mic night at New York City's Catch a Rising Star, which led to an appearance in a Rodney Dangerfield HBO special. In 1980, he had a small recurring role on the sitcom \"Benson\", playing Frankie, a mail-delivery boy who had comedy routines that no one wanted to hear. Seinfeld was abruptly fired from the show due to creative differences. Seinfeld has said that he was not actually told he had been fired until he turned up for the read-through session for an episode and found that there was no script for him.\n\nIn May 1981, Seinfeld made a successful appearance on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\", impressing Carson and the audience and leading to frequent appearances on that show and others, including \"Late Night with David Letterman\".\n\nOn September 5, 1987 his first one-hour special \"Stand-Up Confidential\" aired live on HBO.\n\nSeinfeld created \"The Seinfeld Chronicles\" with Larry David in 1988 for NBC. The show was later renamed \"Seinfeld\" to avoid confusion with the short-lived teen sitcom \"The Marshall Chronicles\". By its fourth season, it had become the most popular and successful sitcom on American television. The final episode aired in 1998, and the show has been a popular syndicated re-run.\n\nAlong with Seinfeld, the show starred \"Saturday Night Live\" veteran Julia Louis-Dreyfus and experienced actors Michael Richards and Jason Alexander. Alexander played George, a caricature of Larry David. Seinfeld is the only actor to appear in every episode of the show.\n\nSeinfeld has said that his show was influenced by the 1950s sitcom \"The Abbott and Costello Show\". In the \"Seinfeld Season 6\" DVD set, commenting on the episode \"The Gymnast\", Seinfeld cited Jean Shepherd as an influence, saying, \"He really formed my entire comedic sensibility—I learned how to do comedy from Jean Shepherd.\"\n\nFrom 2004 to 2007, the former \"Seinfeld\" cast and crew recorded audio commentaries for episodes of the DVD releases of the show. Seinfeld provided commentary for multiple episodes.\n\nAfter he ended his sitcom, Seinfeld returned to New York City to make a comeback with his stand-up comedy rather than stay in Los Angeles and continue his acting career. In 1998 he went on tour and recorded a comedy special, titled \"I'm Telling You for the Last Time\". The process of developing and performing new material at clubs around the world was chronicled in a 2002 documentary, \"Comedian\", which also featured fellow comic Orny Adams and was directed by Christian Charles. Seinfeld has written several books, mostly archives of past routines.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Apple Computer came up with the advertising slogan \"Think different\" and produced a 60-second commercial to promote the slogan. This commercial showed people who were able to \"think differently\", such as Albert Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., and many others. It was later cut short to 30 seconds and altered such that Seinfeld was included at the end, whereas he had not been in the original cut. This shorter version of the commercial aired only once, during the series finale of \"Seinfeld\".\n\nOn November 18, 2004, Seinfeld appeared at the National Museum of American History to donate the \"puffy shirt\" he wore in the \"Seinfeld\" episode of the same name. He also gave a speech when presenting the \"puffy shirt\", saying humorously that \"This is the most embarrassing moment of my life.\"\n\nOn May 13, 2006, Seinfeld had a cameo appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\" as host Julia Louis-Dreyfus' assassin. Louis-Dreyfus in her opening monologue mentioned the \"Seinfeld curse.\" While talking about how ridiculous the \"curse\" was, a stage light suddenly fell next to her. The camera moved to a catwalk above the stage where Seinfeld was standing, holding a large pair of bolt cutters. He angrily muttered, \"Damn it!\" upset that it did not hit her. Louis-Dreyfus continued to say that she is indeed not cursed.\n\nOn February 25, 2007, Seinfeld appeared at the 79th Academy Awards as the presenter for \"Best Documentary.\" Before announcing the nominations, he did a short stand-up comedy routine about the unspoken agreement between movie theater owners and movie patrons.\n\nOn October 4, 2007, Seinfeld made a brief return to NBC, guest-starring as himself in the \"30 Rock\" episode \"SeinfeldVision.\"\n\nOn February 24, 2008, at the 80th Academy Awards, Seinfeld appeared as the voice of his \"Bee Movie\" animated character Barry, presenting \"Best Animated Short.\" Before announcing the nominees, he showed a montage of film clips featuring bees, saying that they were some of his early work (as Barry).\n\nOn June 2, 2008, amidst his spring 2008 tour, Seinfeld performed in his hometown of New York City for a one-night-only show at the Hammerstein Ballroom to benefit \"Stand Up for a Cure\", a charity aiding lung cancer research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.\n\nIn August 2008, the Associated Press reported that Jerry Seinfeld would be the pitchman for Windows Vista, as part of a $300-million advertising campaign by Microsoft. The ads, which were intended to create buzz for Windows in support of the subsequent \"I'm a PC\" advertisements, began airing in mid-September 2008. They were cut from television after three installments; Microsoft opted to continue with the \"I'm a PC\" advertisements and run the Seinfeld ads on the Microsoft website as a series of longer advertisements.\n\nIn March 2009, it was announced that Seinfeld and the entire cast of \"Seinfeld\" would be appearing for a reunion in Larry David's HBO series \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\". The fictional reunion took place in the seventh season's finale.\n\nSeinfeld appeared on an episode of the Starz original series \"Head Case\". As was the case in many of his previous guest appearances on sitcoms, he played himself.\n\nIn Australia, Seinfeld appeared on a series of advertisements for the Greater Building Society, a building society based in New South Wales and southeastern Queensland. His appearance in these ads was highly publicized and considered a coup for the society, being the third time Seinfeld had appeared in a television commercial. The advertisements were filmed in Cedarhurst, Long Island, with the street designed to emulate Beaumont Street in Hamilton, where the Greater's head offices are located. Seinfeld also wrote the scripts for the 15 advertisements that were filmed. The ads largely aired in the Northern New South Wales television market, where the society has most of its branches.\n\nSeinfeld was the first guest on Jay Leno's talk show, \"The Jay Leno Show\", which premiered on September 14, 2009.\n\nSeinfeld was featured on \"Saturday Night Live\"s Weekend Update sketch to do the \"Really!?!\" segment with Seth Meyers. He executive produced and occasionally starred as a panelist in \"The Marriage Ref\". On August 30, 2010, Seinfeld made a surprise guest appearance on \"The Howard Stern Show\", mending the feud the two had in the early '90s.\n\nSeinfeld toured the U.S. in 2011 and made his first stand-up appearance in the UK in 11 years. In July 2011, he was a surprise guest on \"The Daily Show\", helping Jon Stewart to suppress his urge to tell \"cheap\" \"Michele Bachmann's husband acts gay\" jokes. Seinfeld also launched a personal archives website at JerrySeinfeld.com and appeared in the HBO special \"Talking Funny\" with fellow comedians Chris Rock, Louis C.K., and Ricky Gervais in the same year.\n\nIn 2012 Seinfeld started a Web series, \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee\", in which he would pick up a fellow comedian in a different car each episode and take them out for coffee and conversation. The initial series consisted of ten episodes lasting from 7 to 25 minutes each. Season 2 (2013) had six episodes, with guests including Don Rickles and David Letterman.\n\nIn June 2013, he appeared on rapper Wale's album \"The Gifted\", on the song \"Outro About Nothing.\"\n\nSeinfeld received coverage for his speech at the 2014 Clio Awards ceremony, where he received an honorary award, as media reporters said that he \"mocked\" and \"ripped apart\" the advertising industry; his statement of \"I love advertising because I love lying\" received particular attention.\n\nOn February 15, 2015, Seinfeld made a special appearance as a presenter on \"SNL 40\", the 40th anniversary special of \"Saturday Night Live\".\n\nIn January 2017, Seinfeld signed a comedy deal with Netflix. As part of the deal, all episodes of \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee\" would be made available on the streaming service, in addition to a new twenty-four episode season. The deal also included two new Seinfeld stand-up specials and the development of scripted and non-scripted comedy programming for Netflix. On September 19, 2017, Netflix released the standup comedy special \"Jerry Before Seinfeld\".\n\nSeinfeld wrote the book \"Seinlanguage\", released in 1993. Written as his television show was first rising in popularity, it is primarily an adaptation of his stand-up material. The title comes from an article in \"Entertainment Weekly\" listing the numerous catchphrases for which the show was responsible.\n\nIn 2002, he wrote the children's book \"Halloween\". The book was illustrated by James Bennett.\n\nSeinfeld wrote the forewords to Ted L. Nancy's \"Letters from a Nut\" series of books and Ed Broth's \"Stories from a Moron\". Seinfeld also wrote the foreword to the \"Peanut Butter & Co. Cookbook\".\n\nSeinfeld has cited as his influences the humorist Jean Shepherd, and the comedians Jerry Lewis, Bill Cosby, George Carlin, Jay Leno, Robert Klein, and Abbott and Costello, and the actor Ricardo Montalban. Performers and producers influenced by Seinfeld include Judd Apatow, Kevin Hart, and Dennis Miller.\n\nYears before \"Seinfeld\" was created, Seinfeld dated Carol Leifer, a fellow comedian and one of the inspirations for the \"Seinfeld\" character of Elaine. On national TV with Dr. Ruth Westheimer, he explained how, in 1984, he was engaged but called it off. When he was in his late 30s, Seinfeld had a four-year romantic relationship with high school student Shoshanna Lonstein who was 17 years old when they began dating.\n\nIn August 1998, Seinfeld met Jessica Sklar at the Reebok Sports Club and they began dating. Sklar, a public relations executive for Tommy Hilfiger, had just returned from a three-week honeymoon in Italy with Eric Nederlander, a theatrical producer and scion of a theater-owning family. Sklar divorced Nederlander—she explained in a 2007 interview that they had been engaged in couples' therapy sessions prior to their marriage—and married Seinfeld on December 25, 1999. Comedian George Wallace was the best man at the wedding.\n\nAfter the nuptials, Jerry and Jessica Seinfeld bought Billy Joel's house in Amagansett, Long Island, for US$32 million after news of the couple's interest in the property became public in 2000.\n\nThe Seinfelds have one daughter and two sons. Their daughter Sascha was born on November 7, 2000; their first son Julian Kal was born on March 1, 2003; and their second son Shepherd Kellen was born on August 22, 2005—all in New York City. Julian's middle name, Kal, relates to the first name of Seinfeld's father, Kalman, and that of Seinfeld's hero Superman, aka Kal-El.\n\nAmong Seinfeld's best friends are fellow comedians George Wallace, Larry Miller, and Mario Joyner.\n\nIn 2000, Jessica Seinfeld launched Baby Buggy, a charity that provides clothing and gear for underprivileged women and children. She is the author of the best-seller \"Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food\", released by HarperCollins in October 2007.\n\nSeinfeld has made several political contributions, including George W. Bush's and Al Gore's presidential campaigns in 2000, and subsequently to four Democratic Party primary candidates in 2000 and 2004.\n\nSeinfeld stated that he dabbled in Scientology during his 30s, although he says he was never in the organization. The association came to light in 1992.\n\nA fan of the New York Mets, Seinfeld periodically calls Steve Somers' show on WFAN-AM, a sports talk radio station, as \"Jerry from Queens.\" Seinfeld called four innings of a Mets game on SportsNet New York on June 23, 2010, reuniting with analyst Keith Hernandez, who appeared in the \"Seinfeld\" two-part episode, \"The Boyfriend.\"\n\nIn December 2012, Seinfeld said that he had been practicing Transcendental Meditation (TM) for 40 years. He promoted the use of the technique in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder with Bob Roth of the David Lynch Foundation in December 2012 on the \"Good Morning America\" television show, and also appeared at a 2009 David Lynch Foundation benefit for TM, at which Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr appeared.\n\nOn November 5, 2015, the David Lynch Foundation organized a benefit concert at New York City's Carnegie Hall called \"Change Begins Within\" to promote transcendental meditation for stress control. \"It's been the greatest companion technique of living that I've ever come across, and I'm thrilled to be part of this movement that seems to have really been reinvigorated by Bob [Roth] and David Lynch\", Seinfeld said. \"I would do anything that I could to promote it in the world, because I think it's the greatest thing as a life tool, as a work tool and just making things make sense.\"\n\nAccording to \"Forbes\" magazine, Seinfeld's cumulative earnings from \"Seinfeld\" as of 2004 was $267 million, placing him at the top of the celebrity \"money rank\" that year. He reportedly turned down $5 million per episode, for 22 episodes, to continue the show for a 10th season.\n\nSeinfeld earned $100 million from syndication deals and stand-up performances in 2004, and $60 million in 2006. He also earned $10 million for appearing with Bill Gates in Microsoft's 2008 advertisements for Windows.\n\nBetween June 2008 and June 2009, Seinfeld earned $85 million, making him the world's highest-paid comedian during that 12-month period. In 2013, \"Forbes\" documented Seinfeld's annual income as $32 million. In mid-2013, Seinfeld disputed \"Forbes\"' claims regarding his income and net worth on the radio show of Howard Stern.\n\nSeinfeld was ranked by \"Forbes\" the highest-paid comedian for 2015, the second-highest paid in 2016 and the highest-paid again in 2017. Seinfeld's income between June 2016 and June 2017 was $69 million.\n\nSeinfeld, an automobile enthusiast and avid collector, owns a collection of about 150 cars which includes a large Porsche collection. He rented a hangar at the Santa Monica Airport, in Santa Monica, California, for an extended period of time during the 1990s for storage of some of the vehicles in the collection. In 2002, Seinfeld purchased property on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City where he built a $1.4 million two-story garage to store part of his Porsche collection on the East Coast.\n\nOne tally has Seinfeld owning 43 Porsches. Paul Bannister has written that Seinfeld's collection includes Porsche 911s from various years, 10 Porsche Boxsters each painted a different color, and the 1955 Porsche 550 Spyder, the same model and pearl-grey color that actor James Dean was driving when he crashed and died.\n\nThe Discovery Channel television show \"Chasing Classic Cars\" claims that Seinfeld owns the first and last air-cooled Porsche 911s produced. The centerpiece is a $700,000 Porsche 959, one of only 337 built. He was not allowed to drive it, because the car was \"not street legal\", which is because U.S. emissions and crash tests were not performed for the model since Porsche refused to donate four Porsche 959s for destruction tests. He imported the car \"for exhibition purposes\", on the stipulation that it may never be driven on U.S. roads. The car was made U.S. street legal in 1999 under the \"Show and Display\" federal law. Seinfeld wrote an article for the February 2004 issue of \"Automobile\", reviewing the Porsche Carrera GT.\n\nIn 2008, Seinfeld was involved in a car accident when the brakes on his 1967 Fiat 500 failed and, to avoid an intersection, he pulled the emergency brake while turning sharply, ultimately causing the car to come to a stop on its side. Seinfeld was unhurt.\n\nIn an episode of \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee\", Seinfeld stated that he believes that the Lamborghini Miura is \"the most beautiful car ever designed.\"\n\nThe list below only includes episodes mainly written by Seinfeld, as he (and Larry David in Seasons 1 through 7) rewrote the drafts for each episode.\n\nSeason 1\n\nSeason 2\n\nSeason 3\n\nSeason 4\n\nSeason 5\n\nSeason 6\nSeason 7\n\n\n"}

It is located on the China—Kyrgyzstan—Kazakhstan border, east of lake Issyk Kul. Its geologic elevation is , but its glacial cap rises to . For this reason, in mountaineering circles, including for the Soviet Snow Leopard award criteria, it is considered a 7,000-metre peak. The name \"Khan Tengri\" literally means \"King Heaven\" in Kazakh and possibly references the deity Tengri. In some other local languages, it is known as \"Khan Tangiri Shyngy\", \"Kan-Too Chokusu\", \"Pik Khan-Tengry\", and \"Hantengri Feng\".\n\nKhan Tengri is the second-highest mountain in the Tian Shan, surpassed only by Jengish Chokusu (means \"Victory peak\", formerly known as Peak Pobeda) (7,439 m). Khan Tengri is the highest point in Kazakhstan and the third-highest peak in Kyrgyzstan, after Jengish Chokusu (7,439  m) and Avicenna Peak (7,134 m). It is also the world's most northern 7,000-metre peak, notable because peaks of high latitude have a shorter climbing season, generally more severe weather and thinner air.\n\nKhan Tengri is a massive marble pyramid, covered in snow and ice. At sunset the marble glows red, giving it the Kazakh/Kyrgyz name \"Кантау/Кан-Тоо\" (blood mountain). Located just across the South Engilchek (or Inylchek) glacier, 16 km north of Jengish Chokusu, Khan Tengri was originally thought to be the highest peak in the Tian Shan because of its dramatic, steep shape, compared to the massive bulk of Jengish Chokusu. This perception was probably also due to Khan Tengri's visibility across the plains of southern Kazakhstan while Jengish Chokusu remains out of view of civilization. Khan Tengri is the highest peak in the rugged Tengri Tag subrange, also known as the Mustag, that also contains Chapayev Peak (6371 m) and Gorky Peak (6050 m). Anatoli Boukreev considered Khan Tengri perhaps the world's most beautiful peak because of its geometric ridges and its symmetry.\n\nAlthough it is almost 430 m (1,500 ft) lower than its neighbor, Khan Tengri was believed to be the highest peak in the range until Jengish Chokusu was surveyed in 1943 and determined to be higher.\n\nPeter Semenov was the first European to see the Tengri Tag and its peak, the colossal Khan Tengri (in 1857).\n\nThe first ascent of the peak was made in 1931 by Mikhail Pogrebetsky's Ukrainian team by a route from the south (Kyrgyzstan side), then along the west ridge. M. Kuzmin's team made the first ascent from the north (Kazakhstan side) in 1964. Khan Tengri is one of five peaks that a Soviet mountaineer needed to scale to earn the prestigious Snow Leopard award.\n\nAustrian mountaineer and expedition leader Toni Dürnberger died while descending after having climbed Khan Tengri on 17 August 1992.\n\nThe peak appears on the Kyrgyz 100 som bill. In 2004, more than a dozen mountaineers were killed in a large avalanche on the Pogrebetsky route, the most popular route on the mountain.\n\n\n"}

As Pope John Paul II, he elevated ten of his compatriots to cardinalate, the largest number of Polish cardinals created by a single pope.\n\nRoughly one out of two Polish cardinals was a bishop of one of Poland's historically two most important episcopal sees: Gniezno, the capital city of Poland until 1034, and Kraków, Poland's capital from 1038 to 1596. All bishops of Kraków since 1890, as well as all primates of Poland (an honorific title traditionally bestowed on the archbishop of Gniezno), since 1919 have been created cardinals.\n\nCardinals are sorted in chronological order by date of elevation to cardinalate, indicated in the \"Elevated\" column. Cardinals elevated during the same century are marked by the same color on the bar on the left-hand side of the table. The date of elevation is the date of the consistory during which a given person was officially proclaimed cardinal by the pope. In some cases, especially in former times, a cardinal may have received the red hat after the consistory or never. Those, whose elevation was intended by a pope, but died before the consistory, as well as pseudocardinals elevated by antipopes, are listed in \"italics\".\n\nTwo of the cardinals listed here, Jan Olbracht Waza and Marian Jaworski, were elevated \"in pectore\", which means that their names were kept secret by the pope and revealed only on later consistories. In these cases, the date of elevation is the date of the \"in pectore\" elevation, not the date of the subsequent publication.\n\nCardinals are technically deacons or priests of Roman churches known as \"tituli\". Their ranks (cardinal deacon or cardinal priest; there have been no cardinal bishops of Polish origin) and titular churches are indicated in the \"Cardinal title\" column. The \"Other titles\" column shows other, especially episcopal, titles held by the given person during his cardinalate.\n\nThe \"Conclaves\" column lists all conclaves, that is papal elections, that took place during a person's cardinalate and indicates whether he participated in a given conclave or not. Since Ingravescentem aetatem in 1970, cardinals who are 80 years or older at the beginning of a conclave are ineligible to participate.\n\nThe \"Ref.\" column provides links to external online references.\n\n, five of the living Polish cardinals listed above are less than 80 years old and hence eligible to participate in a conclave. They are listed below by date of birth.\n\n"}

Wrede suggested that this theme was not historical but was an addition by the author of Mark. Wrede's broad concept of the Messianic Secret also involved the use of parables by Jesus.\n\nWrede's theory had an inherent inter-relationship with the hypothesis of Markan priority, which Wrede eventually abandoned, but some of his followers accepted. The theory was strongly criticized in the first years of the 20th century, then gained acceptance in the 1920s; but eventually began to lose support and by the 1970s it no longer existed as Wrede had proposed it.\n\nIn the New Testament, Jesus commands silence in many instances. An example is :\n\n29\nAnd he asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter said to him in reply, “You are the Messiah.”\n30\nThen he warned them not to tell anyone about him.\n\nJesus also issues commands of silence after miracles and healings, e.g. in in the cleansing of a leper:\n\n43\nThen, warning him sternly, he dismissed him at once.\n44\nThen he said to him, “See that you tell no one anything, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses prescribed; that will be proof for them.”\n45\nThe man went away and began to publicize the whole matter. He spread the report abroad so that it was impossible for Jesus to enter a town openly. He remained outside in deserted places, and people kept coming to him from everywhere.\n\nThe concept, as Wrede used it, also included parables and secrets of the Kingdom of God as in :\n\n11\n\nWrede proposed that the author of Mark invented the notion of secrecy to reduce the tension between early Christian beliefs about Jesus being the Messiah, and the non-Messianic nature of his ministry. However, Wrede's notion of secrecy did not simply rely on the commands of Jesus but also involved the \"Markan parable theory\" of why Jesus spoke in parables.\n\nWrede recognized the inherent inter-relationship of his approach with the hypothesis of Markan priority – namely that Mark was written first and influenced the other Gospels. However, after re-examining his initial theory, Wrede suggested that his theory would work best if the Markan priority hypothesis turned out to be false and wrote: \"it would be 'most highly desirable' if such a gospel as Mark were not the oldest gospel\". Yet, the followers of the Messianic Secret hypothesis were later forced to assume Markan priority – an issue that has resulted in various forms of criticism by other scholars.\n\nSoon after the appearance of the theory in 1901, theologians such as William Sanday and Albert Schweitzer reacted negatively to it. Initially, scholarship was strictly divided, although suggestions to bridge a gap between the opposing views were made. Wrede's broad concept of the Messianic Secret also involved the use of parables by Jesus, and in his criticism Albert Schweitzer called it the weakest element of Wrede's approach.\n\nWrede's theory enjoyed its highest level of acceptance in the 1920s, and support for it began to decline thereafter as criticisms of the theory were provided based on multiple new arguments. In the 1960s Ulrich Luz demonstrated that the commands of silence which Jesus gave to healed persons belonged to a different category from those issued to his disciples. By the mid-1970s the Messianic Secret theory no longer existed as Wrede had proposed it.\n\nLate in the 20th century, criticism of both the motif and the theory continued from a number of other perspectives, e.g. Daniel J. Harrington, a former professor at the Weston Jesuit School of Theology, argued that even the term \"Messianic Secret\" is a misnomer, has lumped together multiple issues and some of the Biblical terms used have been confused. G. E. Ladd , a former Baptist professor at Fuller Theological Seminary, stated that: \"The 'Messanic Secret' is a clever theory, but utterly lacking in evidence\".\n\nOther explanations regarding the commands of secrecy issued by Jesus have been proposed, e.g. philological explanations based on mistranslations. An example is the explanation suggested by the Exegetic School of Madrid based on the Aramaic primacy that Jesus never expressed those ideas, and that they were added as a result of mistranslation of what Jesus said. However, there is no extant copy of this alleged Aramaic original to support this proposal.\n\nThe historical explanations generally assume that the Gospel of Mark is historical and that Jesus issued the commands. Based on that assumption, various additional theories have been proposed, e.g. that Jesus issued the commands in order not to become a \"celebrity\" and be able to move about with ease.\n\nThe theological explanation was proposed by Wrede: it was not yet the proper time for him to be revealed as such. He knew when he had to go to the court and then be crucified. In Mark 8:30 Jesus, \"Then strictly warned them that they should tell no one about Him.\" Jesus' messianic mission cannot be understood apart from the cross, which the disciples did not yet understand (vs. 31–33 and ch. 9 vs. 30–32). This theological explanation is supported by Matthew's explicit link between Pharisaic conspiracy to \"destroy\" Jesus and the latter's command to his followers \"not to make him known.\" Aware of the plot against him, Jesus \"withdrew from there\" and continued his healing ministry. Matthew goes one step ahead and claims that Jesus' conscious decision to fulfil his ministry by avoiding untimely conflict was a fulfilment of Isaiah's prophecy, Behold, my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased. ... He will not quarrel or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets; a bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not quench, until he brings justice to victory; and in his name the Gentiles will hope.The literary explanation theory has it that Mark made a conscious effort to identify Jesus with Odysseus, a Greek hero with whom Mark's gentile audience would certainly have been familiar. Odysseus, on his return home, has to disguise his identity to avoid his enemies, and in Mark the messianic secret could serve the same purpose for Jesus.\n\n"}

They speak the Mundari language, which belongs to the Munda subgroup of Austroasiatic languages. The Munda are found in the northern areas of east India concentrated in the states of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal. Munda also reside in adjacent areas of Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Arunachal Pradesh as well as in portions of Bangladesh. The group is one of India's largest scheduled tribes.\nMunda people in Tripura are also known as Mura, and in Madhya Pradesh they are often called Mudas.\n\nThe prehistory of the Munda peoples is obscure. Although how they got to the Chota Nagpur Plateau is disputed, it is agreed upon that the ancestors of speakers of the modern-day Munda languages migrated westward from the Austroasiatic homeland of continental Southeast Asia.\n\nAccording to R.S. Sharma, a historian of ancient and early medieval India, many Munda, Dravidian and non-Sanskrit terms occur in Vedic texts ascribed to 1500-500 BCE. They indicate ideas, institutions, products and settlements associated with peninsular and non-Vedic India. Similarly, many Pali and Sanskrit terms, signifying ideas and institutions developed in the Indo-Gangetic Plain, appear in the earliest Tamil texts called the Sangam literature, which was created from 300 BCE to 600 CE. The eastern region, inhabited by the Munda, people made its own contribution. Several terms that signify the use of cotton, navigation, digging, sticks, etc. in the Indo-Aryan languages have been traced back to the Munda languages. It is held that changes in the phonetics and vocabulary of the Vedic language can be explained by contact with both Munda and Dravidian languages.\n\nIn the late 1800's, the British Raj and many non-Mundas were grabbing land traditionally occupied by Mundas, forcing the Mundas to work as bonded labourers. Munda freedom fighter Birsa Munda began the first protest marches calling for remission of forest dues. He worked to unify the Adivasis of Chota Nagpur resist British rule of India. Millenarianism in the tribal belt started with him, and he is still revered in Jharkhand, with villagers in his home village worshipping him as Birsa Bhagawan.\n\nThe Munda people probably descended from Austroasiatic migrants from Southeast Asia. Nomadic hunters in the India tribal belt, they became farmers who were employed in basketwork and weaving. With the listing of the Munda people as Scheduled Tribes (Adivasis), many are employed in various governmental organizations (particularly Indian Railways).\nMunda religion is a blend of Sarnaism and Christianity, and they are not part of the Indian caste system. Although the Mundas have preserved much of their pre-Christian culture, they have absorbed a number of Christian traditions. They have many folk songs, dances, tales and traditional musical instruments. Both sexes participate in dances at social events and festivals. The naqareh is a principal musical instrument.\n\nThe Munda people have elaborate rituals to celebrate birth, death, engagement and marriage. The birth of a boy is celebrated as an earner for the family, and the birth of a girl is celebrated as a family caretaker. \"Lota-pani\" is the engagement ceremony. \"Dali Takka\", a monetary gift to paternal guardians, is generally paid before the marriage. Marriage, considered one of the main rituals of life, is a week-long festivity.\n\nAn ointment of scented oil and turmeric is applied to the face and body after death. Widow marriage is common. The Munda people are patrilineal, patrilocal and patriarchal.\n\nInvolved in agriculture, the Munda people celebrate the seasonal festivals of Mage Parab, Phagu, Karam (festival), Baha parab, Sarhul and Sohrai. Some seasonal festivals have coincided with religious festivals, but their original meaning remains.\n\nMunda people of Jharkhand also follow the old age tradition of Patthalgari i.e. stone erection in which the tribal community residing in the village buries a large inverted u shaped dressed headstone on the head side of grave or entrance of village in which is inscribed the family tree of the dead persons. There are some other types of patthalgari also:-\n\n\nJesuit priest John-Baptist Hoffmann (1857–1928) studied the language, customs, religion and life of the Munda people, publishing the first Mundari language grammar in 1903. With the help of Menas Orea, Hoffmann published the 15-volume \"Encyclopaedia mundarica\". The first edition was published posthumously in 1937, and a third edition was published in 1976. \"The Mundas and Their Country\", by S. C. Roy, was published in 1912. \"Adidharam\" (Hindi:आदि धर्म) by Ram Dayal Munda and Ratan Singh Manki, in Mundari with a Hindi translation, describes Munda rituals and customs.\n\n\n\n"}

These figures need to be used with caution, especially those for the population that is categorised as having no religion, a significant section of whom is likely to practice traditional animist beliefs.\n\nReligious communities are dispersed throughout the country. The northern provinces are predominantly Muslim, particularly along the coastal strip, but some areas of the northern interior have a stronger concentration of Protestant or Catholic communities. Protestants and Catholics are generally more numerous in the southern and central regions, but Muslim minority populations are also present in these areas.\n\nThe National Directorate of Religious Affairs in the Ministry of Justice states evangelical Christians represent the fastest growing religious group in the country. Generally religious communities tend to draw their members from across ethnic, political, economic, and racial lines.\n\nThere are 732 religious denominations and 144 religious organizations registered with the Department of Religious Affairs of the Ministry of Justice. During the reporting period 10 denominations and 20 religious organizations were registered. Major Christian religious groups include Anglican, Baptist, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Congregational, Christadelphians, Methodist, Nazarene, Presbyterian, Jehovah's Witnesses, Roman Catholic, Seventh-day Adventist, and Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, as well as evangelical, apostolic, and Pentecostal churches. Many small, independent Protestant and Catholic churches that have split from mainstream denominations fuse African traditional beliefs and practices within a Christian framework.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of Muslims are Sunni belonging to Shafi school of jurisprudence influenced with Sufism, with a tiny Shi'a minority (a few families) principally of South Asian origin. The growing South Asian immigrant population is predominantly Sunni Muslim and follows the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence. The three principal Islamic organizations are the Islamic Congress, the Islamic Council, and the [Asian] Muslim Community. The Kuwaiti-funded and Sudanese-managed nongovernmental organization (NGO) African Muslim Agency conducted humanitarian work, as did the Muslim development agency Aga Khan.\n\nJewish, Hindu, and Bahá'í Faith groups are registered and constitute a very small percentage of the population.\n\nThe country's leading mosques and the Catholic Church have tried to eliminate some traditional indigenous practices from their places of worship, instituting practices that reflect a stricter interpretation of sacred texts; however, some Christian and Muslim adherents continue to incorporate traditional practices and rituals, and religious authorities have generally been permissive of such practices.\n\nForeign missionary groups operate freely in the country. Some groups offer religious teaching centers to their local communities, while others provide scholarships for students to study in their respective countries.\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respects this right in practice.\n\nThe ruling party of Mozambique since independence, known as Frelimo, became predominantly Marxist during the liberation war. After independence, it declared state atheism and it nationalized all schools and health facilities, until then owned and run in their majority by religious institutions. Faced by resistance, the new state imprisoned some clerics in 1975 and 1976 and banned all Jehovah's Witnesses to a district in Zambezia in 1977.\n\nIn response to the changes in the social and religious situation after Mozambique, the Roman Catholic Church vented public criticism. Catholic bishops condemned a godless society and criticized the death penalty and re-education camps. In 1978 it decided to transform into a church of communities, something the state understood as a move towards resistance to Socialism, rather than the collaboration stated by some Bishops. The result was an outright attack on all religion on the part of the state.\n\nFrom early 1979, the regime attempted to discredit the church on the basis of the history of the colonial church, and it began a campaign to close churches, prevent religious activities and restrict the movements of religious staff. Catholic and other religious institutions resisted, more or less openly. By 1980, resistance was often open and bad international criticism was rife, something which convinced Frelimo to change its stance.\n\nSeveral Protestant groups in Mozambique had strong allegiance to the Frelimo government, potentially because many in the Frelimo leadership (including the late national hero Eduardo Mondlane) had been trained in Protestant schools and the World Council of Churches had supported the Mozambique institute in Dar es Salaam during the war of liberation. But many non-Catholic churches suffered much nonetheless, not least the Jehovah's Witnesses who were all deported to Zambezia and the Nazarene Church which saw many of its missionaries imprisoned.\n\nIslam suffered probably the most during the Anti-religious campaign, because of the plain misunderstanding or prejudice of the Frelimo leadership. Ministers thought, for example, that raising pigs was a good idea to combat underdevelopment and they genuinely did not understand resistance on the part of Muslims in the north of the country. Some long-lasting trauma was thus created.\n\nRenamo benefitted from Frelimo's anti-religious attack. Some campaigning was done nationally and internationally by the rebel movement on the subject of religion already in 1978, but with little long-lasting impact - only some radical American and English Pentecostal groups openly sided with Renamo. The guerilla stance was indeed eventually ambiguous in relation to religious institutions, and the movement did not hesitate to take religious hostages or kill missionaries, national priests, pastors or nuns.\n\nThe anti-religious campaign of Frelimo formally ended in 1982 when the party in power held a meeting with all the main religious institutions. On that occasion, it claimed mistakes had been made and national unity needed to prevail. State control of religious institutions continued after 1982, but the state attack on faith had come to an end.\n\n"}

Section 116 also provides that no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth. The product of a compromise in the pre-Federation constitutional conventions, Section 116 is based on similar provisions in the United States Constitution. However, Section 116 is more narrowly drafted than its US counterpart, and does not preclude the states of Australia from making such laws.\n\nSection 116 has been interpreted narrowly by the High Court of Australia: while the definition of \"religion\" adopted by the court is broad and flexible, the scope of the protection of religions is circumscribed. The result of the court's approach has been that no court has ever ruled a law to be in contravention of Section 116, and the provision has played only a minor role in Australian constitutional history. Among the laws that the High Court has ruled not to be in contravention of Section 116 are laws that provided government funding to religious schools, that authorised the dissolution of a branch of the Jehovah's Witnesses, and that enabled the forcible removal of Indigenous Australian children from their families.\n\nFederal Governments have twice proposed the amendment of Section 116, principally to apply its provisions to laws made by the states. On each occasion—in 1944 and 1988—the proposal failed in a referendum.\n\nSection 116 states:\n\nThe Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.\n\nSection 116 has four limbs. The first three limbs prohibit the Commonwealth from making certain laws: laws \"for establishing any religion\"; laws \"for imposing any religious observance\"; and laws \"for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion\". The fourth limb proscribes the imposition of religious tests to qualify for any Commonwealth office or public trust. Only the \"establishing religion\" and \"prohibiting free exercise\" limbs have been the subject of cases before the High Court.\n\nThe section sits in Chapter V of the Constitution, which deals with the states of Australia. However, Section 116 does not apply to the states. Each state has its own constitution, and only Tasmania's has a provision similar to Section 116. Commentators attribute the erroneous location of Section 116 to a drafting oversight caused by the weariness of the committee charged with finalising the draft Constitution.\n\nThe Constitution was the product of a series of constitutional conventions in the 1890s. The issues of religious freedom and secularism were not prominent in the convention debates, which focused on the economic and legislative powers of the proposed Commonwealth parliament. The first draft of Section 116, approved by the Melbourne Convention of 1891, would have prohibited the states from passing laws prohibiting the free exercise of religion. The Commonwealth was not mentioned because it was assumed that the Commonwealth parliament would have no power to make such laws. At the Melbourne Convention of 1897, Victorian delegate H. B. Higgins expressed concern about this assumption and moved to expand the provision to cover the Commonwealth as well as the states. The amendment was initially defeated, but Higgins later succeeded in having the eventual version of Section 116 adopted by the convention in a 25–16 vote. Higgins feared opposition to the provision from convention delegates concerned that the provision would impede the states' legislative powers, so the version passed by the convention did not mention the states.\n\nThe proposed inclusion of Section 116 in the Constitution was the subject of some dissent in the 1897 Melbourne Convention and the final convention in 1898. Protestant churches in New South Wales argued that the Constitution should state that divine providence is the \"ultimate source of law\", while convention delegates John Quick and Patrick Glynn moved to have God explicitly recognised in the Constitution. The Seventh-day Adventist Church campaigned for a strict separation of church and state, being concerned that the Commonwealth might prohibit its members from working on Sundays. Both sides to some extent achieved their objectives: Section 116 was approved by the final convention, while Glynn successfully moved for the symbolic mention of \"Almighty God\" in the preamble to the British statute that was to contain the Constitution. The Constitution was then approved by popular referendums in each of the six colonies and took effect on 1 January 1901 (the colonies thus became the states of Australia).\n\nSection 116 reflects two provisions of the United States Constitution: the First Amendment, which prohibits the making of laws for the establishment of religion and guarantees the free exercise of religion; and Article VI, Section 3, which prohibits the imposition of religious tests for public offices. Academic Clifford L. Pannam, writing in 1963, called Section 116 a \"fairly blatant piece of transcription\" of its US counterparts. However, in practice, Section 116 has been interpreted more narrowly than the US provisions.\n\nThe High Court's consideration of Section 116 has generally been limited to three areas: the definition of \"religion\"; the meaning of \"law for establishing any religion\"; and the meaning of \"law for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion\". The two other elements of the provision—the clauses prohibiting the Commonwealth from imposing of religious observance and from prescribing religious tests for public offices—have not been the subject of any cases before the court. The court has never ruled a legislative provision to be in contravention of Section 116. As a result of the court's narrow and literal interpretation of Section 116, the provision has played a minor role in Australian constitutional history.\n\nA threshold test considered by courts applying Section 116 is whether a belief seeking constitutional protection is a \"religion\". The leading authority on the question is the 1983 judgment of the High Court in \"Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic)\". The court found that Scientology was a religion, despite some justices commenting that its practices were \"impenetrably obscure\". In reaching this finding, the court argued that the definition of religion needed to be flexible but should recognise the need to be sceptical of disingenous claims of religious practice. Justices Anthony Mason and Gerard Brennan held:\n\n... the criteria of religion [are] twofold: first, belief in a supernatural, Being, Thing or Principle; and second, the acceptance of canons of conduct in order to give effect to that belief.\n\nJustices Ronald Wilson and William Deane were less prescriptive, setting out five \"indicia\" of a religion: a belief in the supernatural; a belief in ideas relating to \"man's nature and place in the universe\"; the adherence to particular standards, codes of conduct or practices by those who hold the ideas; the existence of an identifiable group of believers, even if not a formal organisation; and the opinion of the believers that what they believe in constitutes a religion.\n\nThe courts have taken a narrow approach to the interpretation of the prohibition against \"establishing any religion\", deriving from the 1981 case of \"Attorney-General (Vic) (Ex rel Black) v Commonwealth\" (the \"DOGS\" case), in which the High Court held that Commonwealth funding of religious schools did not contravene Section 116. Chief Justice Garfield Barwick held that a law would only contravene the provision if establishing a religion was its \"express and single purpose\", while Justice Harry Gibbs argued that the section only prohibits the establishment of an official state religion. Each justice in the majority contrasted Section 116 with its equivalent in the US Constitution to find that Section 116 is narrower. The court noted that the US Constitution prohibits laws respecting \"establishment of religion\" generally, whereas the prohibition in Section 116 is against the establishment of \"\"any\" religion\": this meant that Section 116 did not encompass laws that benefit religions generally; it only proscribed laws that established a particular religion. The approach of the High Court to the establishment limb of Section 116 thus largely reflects the views expressed by Constitutional scholars John Quick and Robert Garran in 1901, that establishment means \"the erection and recognition of a State Church, or the concession of special favours, titles, and advantages to one church which are denied to others.\"\n\nThe protection of the free exercise of religion was also interpreted narrowly in early High Court judgments. In 1912, the court in \"Krygger v Williams\", held that a person could not object to compulsory military service on the ground of religious belief. The court considered that Section 116 would only protect religious observance from government interference; it would not permit a person to be excused from a legal obligation merely because the obligation conflicted with his or her religious beliefs. In a 1929 case, Higgins, then a Justice of the High Court, suggested (as \"obiter dictum\") that a person could lawfully object to compulsory voting on the grounds of religious belief. However, in 1943, the court continued the narrow approach it took in \"Krygger v Williams\", upholding war-time regulations that caused the Adelaide branch of the Jehovah's Witnesses to be dissolved and have its property acquired by the Commonwealth government. The government had declared the branch to be an organisation whose activities were \"prejudicial to the defence of the Commonwealth\": one of the branch's professed beliefs was that the government was an \"organ of Satan\". Chief Justice John Latham held that the Constitution permitted the court to \"reconcile religious freedom with ordered government\".\n\nIn a 1997 case known as the \"Stolen Generations Case\", the court upheld an ordinance issued in 1918 that enabled the forcible removal of Indigenous Australian children from their families. The court reasoned that the purpose of the ordinance was not to prohibit the free exercise of religion even though the ordinance may have had that effect. Peter Edge, an academic specialising in religion and the law, thus concludes that Section 116 will only \"prevent legislation that has a prohibited purpose, rather than a prohibited effect\". In her judgment, Gaudron J, while finding that the provision 'cannot be construed as impliedly conferring an independent or free-standing right which, if breached, sounds in damages at the suit of the individual whose interests are thereby affected' left open the possibility that it might nonetheless, in limiting Commonwealth legislative power, apply to a provision that has the effect, as opposed merely to the purpose, of limiting free exercise.\n\nWhen the Constitution took effect in 1901, Quick and Garran argued that Section 116 was redundant as the Commonwealth had not been given the legislative power under Section 51 to establish a religion or prohibit its free exercise. In 1963, Pannam wrote that the provision was regarded \"by all as having little practical value\". Pannam considered the provision would only become significant if the High Court held that it applied to laws made by governments of the territories.\n\nConstitutional scholar George Williams, writing in 1994, criticised the court's literal interpretation of the provision and others in the Constitution, saying the court has \"transformed the Constitution into a wasteland of civil liberties\". Williams argues that as an \"express guarantee of personal freedom\", the provision should be interpreted broadly and promote \"individual liberty over the arbitrary exercise of legislative and executive power\". Academics Gonzalo Villalta Puig and Steven Tudor have called for the court to broaden Section 116 by finding in it an implied right to the freedom of thought and conscience. In their view most Australians correctly \"believe that the Constitution protects the right to freedom of thought and conscience just like it protects other civil and political freedoms\", and that the court should give effect to that belief. They argue there is precedent for the court finding implied constitutional rights, such as the 1992 case of \"Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth\", where the court found that the Constitution guaranteed the freedom of political communication.\n\nIn defence of Section 116 and the High Court's interpretation of it, Joshua Puls argues that the provision is appropriately limited, suggesting that a rigid \"wall of separation\" between religion and the state is undesirable, and that the stronger Constitutional protection of religion in the United States has become overly politicised. Fellow academics Jennifer Clarke, Patrick Keyzer and James Stellios argue that the court's narrow interpretation of the provision is consistent with the intention of the Constitution's drafters, who never intended for it to be a protection of individual rights, while Kevin Booker and Arthur Glass say the provision has \"symbolic value\". Booker and Glass defend the court's interpretation of the provision and other Constitutional rights, saying \"the High Court can only work with the constitutional provisions before it\".\n\nFederal governments have twice proposed referendums to expand the scope of Section 116: in 1944 and in 1988. In 1944, John Curtin's Labor government put a package of measures, known as the \"Fourteen Powers referendum\", to the Australian public. The purpose of the package was mainly to widen the Commonwealth's legislative powers for the purposes of post-war reconstruction. The widening of powers would sunset after five years. One of the measures in the package was to extend Section 116 so that it prohibited the states, not merely the Commonwealth, from making the laws proscribed by the section. The package's 14 measures—which included diverse matters such as powers to provide family allowances and legislate for \"national health\"—were bound together in a single question. H. V. Evatt, the Labor Attorney-General, argued that freedom of religion was \"fundamental to the whole idea of democracy\" and that the suppression of civil rights by dictatorships in Europe demonstrated the need for Australia to have a strong Constitutional guarantee of the freedom. The conservative United Australia Party, then in opposition and led by Robert Menzies, campaigned against the package. Arthur Fadden, leader of the Country Party, claimed a \"yes\" vote would permit the government to implement a \"policy of socialisation\". The package was rejected: the national \"yes\" vote was less than 46 per cent, and there was majority support for the package only in South Australia and Western Australia. One reason for the rejection was the bundling of multiple controversial proposals into one question: voters could not vote in favour of the measures they supported and against those they opposed, giving them reason to vote against the entire package.\n\nA similar proposal to amend Section 116 was put to the Australian people in a referendum in 1988. The referendum contained four questions, the last of which sought to amend Section 116 and other constitutional \"rights and freedoms\". Again, the proposal was initiated by a Labor government (under Bob Hawke); again, the proposal was opposed by the conservative parties; and again, multiple controversial proposals were bound into one question, being \"to alter the Constitution to extend the right to trial by jury, to extend freedom of religion, and to ensure fair terms for persons whose property is acquired by any government.\" The proposal in respect of Section 116 was to extend its operation to the states, and expand the protection to cover any government act (not just legislation) that established a religion or prohibited its free exercise. Some church officials objected to the proposal, fearing that funding of religious schools by the states could become unlawful. The question failed to pass, being opposed by a majority of voters in each of the states. The 70 to 30 per cent nationwide vote against the proposal was the largest margin by which a proposal to amend the Constitution had ever been defeated at a referendum. Williams attributes the failure of the proposal mainly to the absence of bipartisan support for it, highlighting the \"determined and effective\" opposition of senior Liberal Party politician Peter Reith. Williams also points to the \"notorious reluctance\" of Australians to support Constitutional referendums: of the 44 proposals to amend the Constitution, only eight have succeeded.\n\n"}

{"id": "18749849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18749849", "title": "Totenpass", "text": "Totenpass\n\nTotenpass (plural \"Totenpässe\") is a German term sometimes used for inscribed tablets or metal leaves found in burials primarily of those presumed to be initiates into Orphic, Dionysiac, and some ancient Egyptian and Semitic religions. The term may be understood in English as a \"passport for the dead\". The so-called Orphic gold tablets are perhaps the best-known example.\n\n\"Totenpässe\" are placed on or near the body as a phylactery, or rolled and inserted into a capsule often worn around the neck as an amulet. The inscription instructs the initiate on how to navigate the afterlife, including directions for avoiding hazards in the landscape of the dead and formulaic responses to the underworld judges.\n\nThe Getty Museum owns an outstanding example of a 4th-century BC Orphic prayer sheet from Thessaly, a gold-leaf rectangle measuring about . The burial site of a woman also in Thessaly and dating to the late 4thcentury BC yielded a pair of \"Totenpässe\" in the form of \"lamellae\" (Latin, \"thin metal sheets\", singular \"lamella\"). Although the term \"leaf\" to describe metal foil is a modern metaphorical usage, these \"lamellae\" were in this case cut in the shape of cordate leaves probably meant to represent ivy; most \"Totenpässe\" of this type are rectangular. The Greek lettering is not inscribed in regular lines as it is on the rectangular tablets, but rambles to fit the shape. The leaves are paper-thin and small, one measuring and the other . They had been arranged symmetrically on the woman's chest, with her lips sealed by a gold \"danake\", or \"Charon's obol\", the coin that pays the ferryman of the dead for passage; this particular coin depicted the head of a Gorgon. Also placed in the tomb was a terracotta figurine of a maenad, one of the ecstatic women in the retinue of Dionysus.\n\nAlthough the meandering and fragile text poses difficulties, the inscriptions appear to speak of the unity of life and death and of rebirth, possibly in divine form. The deceased is supposed to stand before Persephone, Queen of the Dead, and assert \"I have been released by Bacchios himself.\"\n\nGünther Zuntz made the most complete survey of gold tablets discovered up to 1971 (at Thurii, Crete, and elsewhere), categorizing them into three groups that have become the typological standard. Zuntz presented transcribed text coupled with a reconstruction, and interpreted their religious foundation as Pythagorean rather than Orphic. Philologist Richard Janko proposed that GroupB from Zuntz's collection derived from a single archetype, for which he offered a hypothetical Greek text and the following English translation while attempting, he emphasized, not to rely on preconceptions about underlying theology:\n\nThe most widely available source that discusses the Orphic gold tablets is the classic (if superseded in some aspects) \"Orpheus and Greek Religion\" by W. K. C. Guthrie. Since the 1990s, the usefulness of the term \"Orphic\" has been questioned by scholars, as has the unity of religious belief underlying the gold tablets. More recently the association of the tablets with Orphism has been defended.\n\n\"Totenpässe\" have also been found in tombs from Palestine dating from the 2ndcentury BC and later. These tiny gold sheets employ a formulaic consolation that appears regularly on funerary steles in the area: , (here the name of the deceased is inserted), (\"Take courage, [name], no one is immortal). In one instance, the inscribed tablet was shaped like a funerary headband, with holes to bind it around the forehead.\n\n"}
{"id": "31079386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31079386", "title": "Vegetalismo", "text": "Vegetalismo\n\nVegetalismo is a term used to refer to a practice of \"mestizo\" shamanism in the Peruvian Amazon in which the shamans — known as \"vegetalistas\" — are said to gain their knowledge and power to cure from the \"vegetales\", or plants of the region. Many believe to receive their knowledge from ingesting the hallucinogenic, emetic brew ayahuasca.\n\nThe term \"vegetalismo\" is used to distinguish \"vegetalistas\" from other such healers as \"oracionistas\" (prayer healers) and espiritistas (spiritist healers). The term is used by followers of Brazilian new religious movements to refer to both indigenous and mestizo ayahuasca shamanism in contrast to their practices. However, among mestizos in the Peruvian Amazon, the term \"vegetalismo\" is used to distinguish \"mestizo\" shamanism from the traditional shamanism practiced by indigenous peoples. Related religious movements include the more formal União do Vegetal and Santo Daime.\n\nThe \"vegetalismo\" practice combines deep Catholic elements with the animistic religious beliefs common to indigenous tribes throughout the region. Though many vegetalistas declare themselves to be Catholics, they receive their knowledge and power to heal from their special relationship with the spirits of the Amazon rainforest. \"Vegetalistas\" maintain relationships with two types of spirits: the spirits of the healing plants, often appearing in human form, and protective spirits, often appearing as powerful animals, birds, or humans. There are other spirit-beings (non-human entities) that exist in the visionary world that can assist the shaman; beings that come from other planets and galaxies, beings that come from infinite labyrinths of crystal rooms, and beings who live in the deep rainforest and beneath the dark waters. In contrast to indigenous shamanism in the upper Amazon, which is based within a rural environment and whose focus is to maintain or restore social balance, mestizo shamanism is based within an urban environment and is focused on individual healing. Many of these mestizo shamans have \"consultarios\" (clinics), where they provide consultations and healing ceremonies for patients, as well as other services such as massages and general, simple healing sessions, which usually involve the shaman sucking out the sickness from the patient's body, protecting the body with shacapa and tobacco smoke, and then prescribing an herbal remedy to help the patient in their recovery from the sickness.\n\nAlthough \"vegetalismo\" is strongly influenced by indigenous Amazonian cosmology, and to become a \"vegetalista\" one must abide by prescriptions that conform closely to those found among Indian tribes of the upper Amazon, \"vegetalistas\" do not associate themselves with any specific tribe, therefore there is no community to support the initiation and recognize that the individual has become a \"vegetalista\". One becomes a \"vegetalista\" out of personal choice or vocation, and their shamanic powers become recognized gradually as they build up their reputation in the community in which they live.\n\nIn order to \"dominar\", or \"master\" the plants, one must first prove to the plants that he or she is worthy of their trust. They must show the spirits that they are strong and faithful individuals, and in order to do this they must spend generally a minimum of six months in isolation, living deep in the \"monte\" (the wilderness) in order to take on the odor of the jungle and take in the gifts of the spirits, while following \"la dieta\", the restricted diet in order to become a very powerful shaman. La dieta is key to forming a relationship with the plants, for the plants will not reveal themselves, their uses, and their icaros (sacred songs) to those not following the restricted diet. While a neophyte is undertaking \"la dieta\", he or she must abstain from sugar, salt, and sex, and often oil and fat as well. Generally, human beings smell bad to the spirits, so one must go on this long diet in order to purify oneself from this bad odor. One must practice abstinence while on la dieta in order to eliminate the smell of human sex, for to the spirits this smell is vile and repulsive. However, one must do more than the restricted diet in order to learn the plants, one must also ingest the plant, stay loyal to the plant while taking it into his or her body and allowing it to teach from within. Once the neophyte has undergone la dieta and has won the love of the plants, the spirits of the plants will appear to the neophyte either in visions or dreams. It is then that the plants begin to teach the neophyte their magical healing and protective songs, or \"icaros\".\n\nAn icaro is the magic chant or melody that the novice receives from the plant spirits after he or she has been purified by the restricted diet. The word \"icaro\" may come from the Quechua verb \"ikaray\", blow smoke for healing, or it may come from the Shipibo term \"ikarra\", shaman song. For indigenous tribes throughout the Amazon, songs are a key component in a healing ritual\n\nOnce a neophyte's initiation is near completion, either the spirits or a senior shaman will give him or her a magic phlegm, a magical saliva-like substance which is also called \"yachay\", \"llausa\", or \"la flema\". This substance is known to be the materialization of the shaman's \"fuerza\", or power, and it stored within the shaman's body, usually in the chest or stomach. This phlegm grows as a result of smoking \"mapacho\" and drinking ayahuasca. Both healers and sorcerers store \"virotes\" (magic darts) in \"la flema\", and within the sorcerer's phlegm one may also find creatures such as toads, scorpions, snakes and insects. A rarefied form of this phlegm, known as \"mariri\", is what makes it possible for the shaman to extract harmful magical darts or a sickness from the patient's body while protecting the shaman from the sorcery and sickness that he/she sucks out. The \"mariri\" is said to be air-like and its power often comes out in the act of \"blowing\", which can both cure and kill depending on its use.\n\nThe term \"virote\", originally the Spanish name for a very strong arrow, is a term used in \"vegetalismo\" to refer to the magical darts that the shamans and sorcerers store in their phlegm. Poet César Calvo describes a \"virote\" as a \"very small poisoned dart, capable of abandoning and resuming its material shape in order to transverse any distance; any time; any wall, shield, or protection; to nail itself in enemy flesh and to reach the target selected by the sorcerer who gave it form and then animated that form, endowing it with destiny and transcendence.\" Depending on the culture and various circumstances, these pathogenic projectiles can be materialized as a number of different things, including the thorns of spiny palm trees, insects, tiny stones, stingray stings, snake fangs, scorpions, toads, monkey hair, among other menacing things. In the practice of shamanism among indigenous groups like the Shuar, these \"virotes\" are often referred to as \"tsentsak\".\n\nMagic stones, \"piedras encantadas\", are an important tool in the practice of \"vegetalismo\". The appearance of the stone varies, some have a striking appearance which indicates that they are \"encantada\", for example the stone may be shaped like a person or animal, have an unusual color, or just be rare. Crystals are particularly prized as \"piedras encantadas\", as they are thought to be of a celestial origin. These magical stones are used to help those patients who appear to be victims of sorcery, the shaman will place the stone on the body where the sorcery has struck and the magic stone will stick there for several hours, sucking out the dart, phlegm, scorpion, or whatever harm has been inflicted there by the sorcerer. In order to master the use of these enchanted stones, the shaman must drink them while following \"la dieta\", just as he does the plants. Before the shaman drinks the water, the stone is left in water for a day, and the shaman blows tobacco smoke over it while telling the stone what it is he wants to know. It is only after this that the spirit of the stone will appear to the shaman in a dream.\n\nThe ayahuasca ceremony is a widespread practice among \"vegetalistas\", one that has gained a lot of attention in recent years due to the success of the industry of \"ayahuasca tourism\", in which people from all over the world travel to places such as Peru to partake in an ayahuasca session led by a \"vegetalismo\" shaman. These sessions vary greatly depending on the vegetalista conducting the ceremony, and there are significant differences between an ayahuasca session held in an urban setting and one held in a rural setting. In urban settings a shaman will usually hold one of these sessions several times a week, and they usually draw crowds of about twenty people or more, many of whom don't know each other. In rural settings the groups are much smaller, usually less than ten people, and the people involved often know each other or have kindred ties. Generally in the urban setting the shaman will meet and speak briefly to everyone in attendance for the ceremony, gathering information on their illnesses and what it is their seeking to find from ingesting \"ayahuasca\". Some people attend these ceremonies regularly as a purge, to cleanse themselves.\n"}
{"id": "45042068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45042068", "title": "World Religion Day", "text": "World Religion Day\n\nWorld Religion Day is an observance initiated in 1950 by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States, celebrated worldwide on the third Sunday in January each year. Though initiated in the United States, World Religion Day has come to be celebrated internationally.\n\nDescribed as a \"Bahá'í-inspired idea that has taken on a life of its own\", the origins of World Religion Day lie in the Bahá'í principles of the oneness of religion and of progressive revelation, which describe religion as evolving continuously throughout the history of humanity. The purpose of World Religion Day is to highlight the ideas that the spiritual principles underlying the world's religions are harmonious, and that religions play a significant role in unifying humanity.\n\nInitially a Bahá'í observance, World Religion Day was inspired by the Bahá'í principles of the oneness of religion and of progressive revelation, which describe religion as evolving continuously throughout the history of humanity. It promotes these principles by highlighting the ideas that the spiritual principles underlying the world's religions are harmonious, and that religions play a significant role in unifying humanity.\n\nAs a means of clarifying the nature and purpose of World Religion Day, the Universal House of Justice, the elected council that serves as the head of the Bahá'í Faith noted in a 1968 message that, rather than providing a \"platform for all religions and their emergent ecumenical ideas,\" the observance serves as \"a celebration of the need for and the coming of a world religion for mankind, the Bahá'í Faith itself.\"\n\nIn April 2002, the Universal House of Justice published a letter, \"To the World’s Religious Leaders\", in which it stated:\n\n...interfaith discourse, if it is to contribute meaningfully to healing the ills that afflict a desperate humanity, must now address honestly ... the implications of the over-arching truth ... that God is one and that, beyond all diversity of cultural expression and human interpretation, religion is likewise one.\n\nWorld Religion Day has been described as a \"Bahá'í-inspired idea that has taken on a life of its own\", because its observance is no longer confined to the Bahá'í community, where it originally took shape. Although observances of World Religion Day are still sponsored and supported by Bahá'í communities worldwide, Baha'i institutions such as the Universal House of Justice or the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States no longer play active roles in the promotion of events, apart from reporting on them. Instead, an increasing number of observances are independently organized by interfaith or multi-faith coalitions.\n\nThe earliest observation entitled \"World Peace Through World Religion\" was in Portland, Maine at the Eastland Park Hotel in October 1947 with a talk by Firuz Kazemzadeh. In 1949 observances in various communities in the United States made the local newspapers in December called \"World Religion Day\". It was standardized across the United States by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States in December 1949 to be held January 15. It also began to be observed internationally starting as early as in Australia in 1950 in two cities and Bolivia in 1951. By 1958 Bahá'ís had gathered notices of events in a number of countries—sometimes attracting hundreds of people and sometimes overlapping with race amity priorities. In Laos, for example, meetings were noted in 1958, 1959, and 1960, among many countries activities. In the Netherlands in 1962 it was noted in several cities.\n\nThe observance has grown in some scale of recognition beginning in the 1950s.\n\nIt was noted on various AM radio stations in the 1950s and 1960s:\n\nVarious noted speakers have given talks in the 1950s to the 1970s:\n\nA number of locales have seen Mayoral proclamations in the United States and Canada in the 1960s and 1970s:\n\nIn 1968 the proclamation was issued by Warren E. Hearnes, Governor of Missouri.\n\nIn 1985 Sri Lanka issued the first World Religion Day postage stamp. This was followed by a stamp issued by the Republic of the Congo in 2007. The Congo stamp showed a globe with the symbols of 11 religions surrounding it, and the text (in French) read, \"God is the source of all religions.\"\n\nThere is a long tradition of hosting panels and symposia with representatives of many religions at World Religion Day observances.\n\nAfter years of activity since 2000 in 2011 Ottawa city government hosted an event that was video taped. It was subsequently noted in 2014 on CTV Television Network.\n\nSince 2013 participants have gathered at a virtual presentation in Second Life at the UUtopia Center for an observance. The 2014 observance had screenshots taken. The 2015 event of talks of a panel of speakers was recorded.\n\nIn 2013 the Parliament of Religions noted it. The Oxford University Press' blog noted it in 2015.\n\n"}

Flunder (born July 29, 1955) is an American singer and senior pastor of the City of Refuge United Church of Christ in Oakland, California and Presiding Bishop of The Fellowship of Affirming Ministries.\n\nFlunder was born in San Francisco, California and raised in the Church of God in Christ. In 1984 she began singing and recording with Walter Hawkins and the Love Center Choir, where she was the lead singer. She was later ordained by Hawkins.\n\nIn 1986, Flunder was moved to begin working with and ministering to people with HIV/AIDS in response to the epidemic of the 1980s. She founded several not-for-profit enterprises in the San Francisco Bay Area, providing services for people affected by HIV: Hazard-Ashley House, Walker House and Restoration House, through the Ark of Refuge, Inc., which later became the Y. A. Flunder Foundation. In 1991, she founded the City of Refuge under the United Church of Christ, \"in order to unite a gospel ministry with a social ministry\". She describes the City of Refuge UCC as an effort to \"create a spiritual community that will embrace our collective cultures, faith paths, gender expressions, and sexual/affectional orientations while simultaneously freeing us from oppressive theologies that subjugate women, denigrate the LGBT community, and disconnect us from justice issues locally and globally\".\n\nFlunder earned a Certificate of Ministry Studies and a Master of Arts in 1997 from the Pacific School of Religion, before earning her Doctor of Ministry degree from the San Francisco Theological Seminary in 2001. In 2000 she founded the Fellowship of Affirming Ministries, a trans-denominational coalition of Christian churches who \"desire to celebrate and proclaim the radically inclusive love of Jesus Christ\", and was appointed its Presiding Bishop in 2003.\n\nFlunder identifies as a womanist and a reconciling liberation theologian. In 2005 she authored a book, \"Where the Edge Gathers: Building a Community of Radical Inclusion\". Carlton Pearson cites her among the first religious leaders to embrace and encourage him after he was declared a heretic due to coming out in support of universal reconciliation.\n\nIn 2013 she was named as a Distinguished Alumna of the Pacific School of Religion. On December 1, 2014, Flunder was a keynote speaker in the White House for World AIDS Day, where she described the harmful effects of stigma and homophobia on those living with HIV and on AIDS education in general. The following year she was a guest speaker at the American Baptist College's Garnett-Nabrit Lecture Series.\n\nSince 2015 Flunder has been a member of the board of trustees of the Starr King School for the Ministry and also served as a member of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS.\n\nFlunder's spouse is Shirley Miller, the cousin of Walter Hawkins; they have been committed partners since the mid-1980s.\n\nFlunder was portrayed by actress Phylicia Rashad for the final 3-part episode as part of the Dustin Lance Black mini-series \"When We Rise\" on March 3, 2017 on the major television network ABC. The Bishop's role in the show highlights the compassion of the church, the commitment of its leadership and the loving home the church provides to minister in the tough, primarily African-American community in San Francisco.\n\nFlunder was also depicted by Joni Bovill in the Joshua Marston drama film \"Come Sunday\", which premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival and was released on Netflix in April 2018.\n\n"}
