{"id": "18951262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18951262", "title": "Anne Rice", "text": "Anne Rice\n\nAnne Rice (born October 4, 1941) is an American author of gothic fiction, Christian literature, and erotic literature.\nShe is perhaps best known for her series of novels, \"The Vampire Chronicles\", revolving around the central character of Lestat. Books from \"The Vampire Chronicles\" were the subject of two film adaptations, \"Interview with the Vampire\" in 1994, and \"Queen of the Damned\" in 2002.\n\nBorn in New Orleans, Rice spent much of her early life there before moving to Texas, and later to San Francisco. She was raised in an observant Catholic family, but became an agnostic as a young adult. She began her professional writing career with the publication of \"Interview with the Vampire\" in 1976, while living in California, and began writing sequels to the novel in the 1980s. In the mid-2000s, following a publicized return to Catholicism, Rice published the novels \"\" and \"\", fictionalized accounts of certain incidents in the life of Jesus. Several years later she distanced herself from organized Christianity, citing disagreement with the Church's stances on social issues but pledging that faith in God remained \"central to [her] life.\" However, she now considers herself a secular humanist.\n\nRice's books have sold nearly 100 million copies, placing her among the most popular authors in recent American history. While reaction to her early works was initially mixed, she became more popular with critics and readers in the 1980s. Her writing style and the literary content of her works have been deeply analyzed by literary commentators. She was married to poet and painter Stan Rice for 41 years, from 1961 until his death from brain cancer in 2002 at age 60. She and Stan had two children, Michele, who died of leukemia at age five, and Christopher, who is also an author.\n\nIn addition to her vampire novels, Rice has authored books such as \"The Feast of All Saints\" (adapted for television in 2001) and \"Servant of the Bones\", which formed the basis of a 2011 comic book miniseries. Several books from \"The Vampire Chronicles\" have been adapted as comics by various publishers. Rice has also authored erotic fiction under the pen names Anne Rampling and A. N. Roquelaure, including \"Exit to Eden\", which was later adapted into a 1994 film.\n\nBorn on October 4, 1941 in New Orleans, Rice is the second of four daughters of parents of Irish Catholic descent, Howard O'Brien and Katherine \"Kay\" Allen O'Brien. Her father, a Naval veteran of World War II and lifelong resident of New Orleans, worked as a Personnel Executive for the U.S. Postal Service, and authored one novel, \"The Impulsive Imp\", which was published posthumously. Her older sister, Alice Borchardt, later became a noted author of fantasy and horror fiction.\n\nRice spent most of her childhood and teenage years in New Orleans, a city that forms the backdrop against which many of her works are set. Her early years were marked by coping with the family's poverty and her mother's alcoholism. She and her family lived in the rented home of her maternal grandmother, Alice Allen, known as \"Mamma Allen,\" at 2301 St. Charles Avenue in the Irish Channel, which Rice says was widely considered a \"Catholic Ghetto\". Allen, who began working as a domestic shortly after separating from her alcoholic husband, was an important early influence in Rice's life, keeping the family and household together as Rice's mother sank deeper into alcoholism. Allen died in 1949, but the O'Briens remained in her home until 1956, when they moved to 2524 St. Charles Avenue, a former rectory, convent, and school owned by the parish, to be closer to both the church and support for Katherine's addiction. As a young child, Rice studied at St. Alphonsus School, a Catholic institution previously attended by her father.\n\nAbout her unusual given name, Rice said:\n\nHowever, according to the authorized biography \"Prism of the Night\", by Katherine Ramsland, Rice's father was the source of his daughter's birth name: \"Thinking back to the days when his own name had been associated with girls, and perhaps in an effort to give it away, Howard named the little girl Howard Allen Frances O'Brien.\" Rice became \"Anne\" on her first day of school, when a nun asked her what her name was. She told the nun \"Anne,\" which she considered a pretty name. Her mother, who was with her, let it go without correcting her, knowing how self-conscious her daughter was of her real name. From that day on, everyone she knew addressed her as \"Anne\", and her name was legally changed in 1947. Rice was confirmed in the Catholic Church when she was twelve years old and took the full name Howard Allen Frances Alphonsus Liguori O'Brien, adding the names of a saint and of an aunt, who was a nun. \"I was honored to have my aunt's name,\" she said, \"but it was my burden and joy as a child to have strange names.\"\n\nWhen Rice was fifteen years old, her mother died as a result of alcoholism. Soon afterward, she and her sisters were placed by their father in St. Joseph's Academy. Rice described St. Joseph's as \"something out of Jane Eyre ... a dilapidated, awful, medieval type of place. I really hated it and wanted to leave. I felt betrayed by my father.\"\n\nIn November 1957, Rice's father married Dorothy Van Bever. On the subject of the couple's first meeting, Rice recalled, \"My father wrote her a formal letter inviting her to lunch which I hand-delivered to her house ... I was so nervous. In the note he enclosed a pin which she was to wear if she accepted the invitation. The next day she had the pin on.\" In 1958, when Rice was sixteen, her father moved the family to north Texas, purchasing their first home in Richardson. Rice first met her future husband, Stan Rice, in a journalism class while they were both students at Richardson High School.\n\nGraduating from Richardson High in 1959, Rice completed her freshman year at Texas Woman's University in Denton and transferred to North Texas State College for her sophomore year, but dropped out when she ran out of money and was unable to find employment. She soon decided to move to San Francisco, and received permission from her friend, Dennis Percy, to stay with his family there until she found work as an insurance claims processor. She persuaded her former roommate from Texas Woman's University, Ginny Mathis, to join her, and they found an apartment in the Haight-Ashbury district. Mathis acquired a job at the same insurance company as Rice. Soon after, they began taking night courses at University of San Francisco, an all-male Jesuit school that allowed women to take night courses. For Easter vacation Anne returned home to Texas, rekindling her relationship with Stan Rice. After her return to San Francisco, Stan Rice came for a week-long visit during summer break. He returned to Texas, Rice moved back in with the Percys, and Mathis left San Francisco in August to enroll in a nursing program in Oklahoma. Some time later, Anne received a special delivery letter from Stan Rice asking her to marry him. They married on October 14, 1961, in Denton, Texas, soon after she turned twenty years old, and when he was just weeks from his nineteenth birthday.\n\nThe Rices moved back to San Francisco in 1962, experiencing the birth of the Hippie movement firsthand as they lived in the soon-to-be fabled Haight-Ashbury district, Berkeley, and later the Castro District. \"I'm a totally conservative person,\" she later told \"The New York Times\", \"In the middle of Haight-Ashbury in the 1960s, I was typing away while everybody was dropping acid and smoking grass. I was known as my own square.\" Rice attended San Francisco State University and obtained a B.A. in Political Science in 1964. Their daughter Michele, later nicknamed \"Mouse\", was born to the couple on September 21, 1966, and Rice later interrupted her graduate studies at SFSU to become a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Berkeley. However, she soon became disenchanted with the emphasis on literary criticism and the language requirements. In Rice's words, \"I wanted to be a writer, not a literature student.\"\n\nRice returned to San Francisco State in 1970 to finish her studies in Creative Writing, and in 1972 graduated with an M.A. Stan Rice became an instructor at San Francisco State shortly after receiving his own M.A. in Creative Writing from the institution, and later chaired the Creative Writing department before retiring in 1988. In 1970, while Rice was still in the graduate program, her daughter was diagnosed with acute granulocytic leukemia. Rice later described having a prophetic dream, months before Michele became ill, that her daughter was dying from \"something wrong with her blood.\" On August 5, 1972, Michele died at Stanford Children's Hospital in Palo Alto.\n\nRice's son Christopher was born in Berkeley, California, in 1978; he would become a best-selling author in his own right, publishing his first novel at the age of 22. In mid-1979, Rice, an admitted alcoholic, and her husband, Stan Rice, quit drinking so their son would not have the life that she had as a child.\n\nRice has stated that Charles Dickens, Virginia Woolf, John Milton, Ernest Hemingway, William Shakespeare, the Brontë sisters, Jean-Paul Sartre, Henry James, Arthur Conan Doyle, and H. Rider Haggard are writers who have influenced her work.\n\nIn 1973, while still grieving the loss of her daughter, Rice took a previously written short story and turned it into her first novel, the bestselling \"Interview with the Vampire\". She based her vampires on Gloria Holden's character in \"Dracula's Daughter\": \"It established to me what vampires were—these elegant, tragic, sensitive people. I was really just going with that feeling when writing \"Interview With the Vampire\". I didn't do a lot of research.\" After completing the novel and following many rejections from publishers, Rice developed obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). She became obsessed with germs, thinking that she contaminated everything she touched, engaged in frequent and obsessive hand washing and obsessively checked locks on windows and doors. Of this period, Rice says, \"What you see when you're in that state is every single flaw in our hygiene and you can't control it and you go crazy.\"\n\nIn August 1974, after a year of therapy for her OCD, Rice attended the Squaw Valley Writer's Conference at Squaw Valley, conducted by writer Ray Nelson. While at the conference, Rice met her future literary agent, Phyllis Seidel. In October 1974, Seidel sold the publishing rights to \"Interview with the Vampire\" to Alfred A. Knopf for a $12,000 advance of the hardcover rights, at a time when most new authors were receiving $2,000 advances. \"Interview with the Vampire\" was published in May 1976. In 1977, the Rices traveled to both Europe and Egypt for the first time.\n\nFollowing the publication of \"Interview with the Vampire\", while living in California, Rice wrote two historical novels, \"The Feast of All Saints\" and \"Cry to Heaven\", along with four erotic novels (\"The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty\", \"Beauty's Punishment\", and \"Beauty's Release\") under the pseudonym A. N. Roquelaure, and two more under the pseudonym Anne Rampling (\"Exit to Eden\" and \"Belinda\"). Rice then returned to the vampire genre with \"The Vampire Lestat\" and \"The Queen of the Damned\", her bestselling sequels to \"Interview with the Vampire\".\n\nShortly after her June 1988 return to New Orleans, Rice penned \"The Witching Hour\" as an expression of her joy at coming home. Rice also continued her popular \"Vampire Chronicles\" series, which later grew to encompass ten novels, and followed up on \"The Witching Hour\" with \"Lasher\" and \"Taltos\", completing the \"Lives of the Mayfair Witches\" trilogy. She also published \"Violin\", a tale of a ghostly haunting, in 1997.\n\nRice calls \"Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt\", published in 2005, the beginning of a series chronicling the life of Jesus. The second volume, \"\", was published in March 2008. The third book in the series, \"Christ the Lord: Kingdom of Heaven\", has been postponed.\n\nAfter moving to Rancho Mirage, California, in December 2005, Rice wrote \"Christ the Lord: The Road to Cana\", \"Angel Time\", and \"Of Love and Evil\" (the latter two being the first two books in her \"Songs of the Seraphim\" series), in addition to her memoir, \"Called Out of Darkness: A Spiritual Confession\".\n\nOn March 9, 2014, Rice announced on her son Christopher's radio show, \"The Dinner Party with Christopher Rice and Eric Shaw Quinn\", that she had completed another book in the \"Vampire Chronicles\", titled, \"Prince Lestat\", a \"true sequel\" to \"Queen of the Damned\". The book was released on October 28, 2014. In 2015, a sequel to the Beauty trilogy, \"Beauty's Kingdom,\" was released.\n\nFollowing its debut in 1976, \"Interview with the Vampire\" received many negative reviews from critics, causing Rice to retreat temporarily from the supernatural genre. When \"The Vampire Lestat\" debuted in 1985, reaction—both from critics and from readers—was more positive, and the first hardcover edition of the book sold 75,000 copies. Upon its publication in 1988, \"The Queen of the Damned\" was given an initial hardcover printing of 405,000 copies. The novel was a main selection of the Literary Guild of America for 1988, and reached the #1 spot on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list, staying on the list for more than four months.\n\nRice's novels are popular among many members of the LGBT community, some of whom have perceived her vampire characters as allegorical symbols of isolation and social alienation. Similarly, a reviewer writing for \"The Boston Globe\" observed that the vampires of her novels represent \"the walking alienated, those of us who, by choice or not, dwell on the fringe.\" On the subject, Rice herself commented, \"From the beginning, I've had gay fans, and gay readers who felt that my works involved a sustained gay allegory ... I didn't set out to do that, but that was what they perceived. So even when Christopher was a little baby, I had gay readers and gay friends and knew gay people, and lived in the Castro district of San Francisco, which was a gay neighborhood.\"\n\nRice's writings have also been identified as having had a major impact on later developments within the genre of vampire fiction. \"Rice turns vampire conventions inside out,\" writes Susan Ferraro of \"The New York Times\". \"Because Rice identifies with the vampire instead of the victim (reversing the usual focus), the horror for the reader springs from the realization of the monster within the self. Moreover, Rice's vampires are loquacious philosophers who spend much of eternity debating the nature of good and evil.\"\n\nIn addition, Rice's writing style has been heavily analyzed. Ferraro, in a statement typical of many reviewers, describes her prose as \"florid, both lurid and lyrical, and full of sensuous detail\". However, others have criticized Rice's writing style as both verbose and overly philosophical. Author William Patrick Day comments that her writing is often \"long, convoluted, and imprecise\".\n\nIn June 1988, following the success of \"The Vampire Lestat\" and with \"The Queen of the Damned\" about to be published, the Rices purchased a second home in New Orleans, the Brevard-Rice House, built in 1857 for Albert Hamilton Brevard. Stan took a leave of absence from his teaching, and together they moved to New Orleans. Within months, they decided to make it their permanent home.\n\nRice returned to the Catholic Church in 1998 after decades of atheism. On December 14, 1998, she fell into a coma, later determined to be caused by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and nearly died. She was later diagnosed with Diabetes mellitus type 1, and is now insulin-dependent. In 2003, following the recommendation of her husband and shortly after his death, Rice underwent gastric bypass surgery and shed 103 pounds.\n\nIn 2004, Rice nearly died again from an intestinal blockage or bowel obstruction, a common complication of gastric bypass surgery. In 2005, \"Newsweek\" reported, \"[Rice] came close to death last year, when she had surgery for an intestinal blockage, and also back in 1998, when she went into a sudden diabetic coma; that same year she returned to the Roman Catholic Church, which she'd left at 18.\" Her return did not come with a full embrace of the Church's stances on social issues; Rice remained a vocal supporter of equality for gay men and lesbians (including marriage rights), as well as abortion rights and birth control, writing extensively on such issues. In October 2005, while promoting her book, \"\", she announced in \"Newsweek\" that she would now use her life and talent of writing to glorify her belief in God, but did not renounce her earlier works.\n\nIn the Author's Note from \"Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt\", Rice states:\n\nI had experienced an old-fashioned, strict Roman Catholic childhood in the 1940s and 1950s ... we attended daily Mass and Communion in an enormous and magnificently decorated church... Stained-glass windows, the Latin Mass, the detailed answers to complex questions on good and evil—these things were imprinted on my soul forever...\n\nI left this church at age 18... I wanted to know what was happening, why so many seemingly good people didn't believe in any organized religion yet cared passionately about their behavior and value of their lives... I broke with the church... I wrote many novels that without my being aware that they reflected my quest for meaning in a world without God.\n\nIn her memoir \"Called Out of Darkness: A Spiritual Confession\", Rice also states:\n\nIn the moment of surrender, I let go of all the theological or social questions which had kept me from [God] for countless years. I simply let them go. There was the sense, profound and wordless, that if He knew everything I did not have to know everything, and that, in seeking to know everything, I'd been, all of my life, missing the entire point. No social paradox, no historic disaster, no hideous record of injustice or misery should keep me from Him. No question of Scriptural integrity, no torment over the fate of this or that atheist or gay friend, no worry for those condemned and ostracized by my church or any other church should stand between me and Him. The reason? It was magnificently simple: He knew how or why everything happened; He knew the disposition of every single soul. He wasn't going to let anything happen by accident! Nobody was going to go to Hell by mistake.\n\nOn January 18, 2004, Rice announced on her website that she had made plans to leave New Orleans. She cited living alone since the death of her husband and her son moving to California as the reasons for her move. On January 30, 2004, Rice put the largest of her three homes up for sale and moved to a gated community in Kenner, Louisiana. \"Simplifying my life, not owning so much, that's the chief goal\", said Rice. \"I'll no longer be a citizen of New Orleans in the true sense.\" She sold her New York City condominium on January 20, 2005. In 2005, after completing \"Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt\", Rice left New Orleans, shortly before the events of Hurricane Katrina in August. None of her former New Orleans properties were flooded, and Rice remains a vocal advocate for the city and related relief projects.\n\nAfter leaving New Orleans, Rice settled first in La Jolla, California. In November 2005, she described the weather in La Jolla as \"like heaven.\" However, she left La Jolla less than a year after moving there, stating in January 2006 that the weather was too cold. She purchased a six-bedroom home in Rancho Mirage, California, in December 2005, allowing her to be closer to her son in Los Angeles.\n\nOn July 18, 2010, Rice auctioned off her large collection of antique dolls at Thierault's in Chicago. Beginning in mid-2010 and continuing through early 2011, Rice also began auctioning off her household possessions, collectibles featured in her many books, jewelry, and wardrobe on eBay. She also sold a large portion of her library collection to Powell's Books.\n\nOn July 28, 2010, Rice publicly announced her disdain for the current state of Christianity on her Facebook page, stating, \"Today I quit being a Christian... I remain committed to Christ as always but not to being 'Christian' or to being part of Christianity. It's simply impossible for me to 'belong' to this quarrelsome, hostile, disputatious, and deservedly infamous group. For ten years, I've tried. I've failed. I'm an outsider. My conscience will allow nothing else.\" Shortly thereafter, she clarified her statement: \"My faith in Christ is central to my life. My conversion from a pessimistic atheist lost in a world I didn't understand, to an optimistic believer in a universe created and sustained by a loving God is crucial to me. But following Christ does not mean following His followers. Christ is infinitely more important than Christianity and always will be, no matter what Christianity is, has been, or might become.\"\n\nFollowing her announcement, Rice's critique of Christianity was commented upon by numerous journalists and pundits. In an interview with the \"Los Angeles Times\", Rice elaborated on her view regarding being a member of a Christian church: \"I feel much more morally comfortable walking away from organized religion. I respect that there are all kinds of denominations and all kinds of churches, but it's the entire controversy, the entire conversation that I need to walk away from right now.\" In response to the question, \"how do you follow Christ without a church?\" Rice replied: \"I think the basic ritual is simply prayer. It's talking to God, putting things in the hands of God, trusting that you're living in God's world and praying for God's guidance. And being absolutely faithful to the core principles of Jesus' teachings.\" In 2011, Rice participated in the \"I Am Second\" project, with a short documentary about her spiritual journey. On April 14, 2013, Rice stated in a Facebook post that she was a secular humanist. On July 28, 2014, Rice stated in a Facebook post that Christ is still central to her life, but not in the way he is presented by organized religion.\n\nIn 1994, Neil Jordan directed a motion picture adaptation of \"Interview with the Vampire\", based on Rice's own screenplay. The movie starred Tom Cruise as Lestat, Brad Pitt as the guilt-ridden Louis, and a young Kirsten Dunst in her breakout role as the deceitful child vampire Claudia.\n\nA second film adaptation, \"Queen of the Damned,\" was released in February 2002, starring Stuart Townsend as the vampire Lestat and singer Aaliyah as Akasha. The movie combined plot points from both the novel \"The Queen of the Damned\", as well as from \"The Vampire Lestat\". Produced on a budget of $35 million, the film recouped only $30 million at the U.S. box office. On her Facebook page, Rice distanced herself from the film, and has stated that she feels the filmmakers \"mutilated\" her work in adapting the novel.\n\nThe 1994 film \"Exit to Eden,\" based loosely on the book Rice published as Anne Rampling, starred Rosie O'Donnell and Dan Aykroyd. The work was transformed from a BDSM-themed love story into a police comedy, and was widely considered a box-office failure, receiving near-universal negative reviews.\n\nA film adaptation of \"Christ the Lord\" was reported to be in the early stages of development in February 2012. It was reported that Chris Columbus had signed on to produce, and that Cyrus Nowrasteh had already completed the script. On November 8, 2014, during an interview with her long-time editor, Victoria Wilson, at the Chicago Humanities Festival, Rice revealed that filming had finished on the movie and was going into post-production. The film, titled \"The Young Messiah\", was released in 2016.\n\nIn August 2014, Universal Pictures had acquired the rights to Rice's \"Vampire Chronicles\". However, in November 2016, when Universal Pictures did not renew the contract, the film and television rights reverted to Rice, who began developing \"The Vampire Chronicles\" into a television series with her son, Christopher.\n\nIn 1997, Rice wrote the story for a television pilot entitled \"Rag and Bone\", featuring elements of both horror and crime fiction. Screenwriter James D. Parriott penned the screenplay, and the pilot ultimately aired on CBS, starring Dean Cain and Robert Patrick.\n\n\"The Feast of All Saints\" was made into a Showtime original miniseries in 2001, directed by Peter Medak and starring James Earl Jones and Gloria Reuben. As of 2002, NBC had plans to adapt Rice's \"Lives of the Mayfair Witches\" trilogy into a miniseries, but the project never entered production.\n\nOn November 26, 2016, Rice announced in a personal statement on her Facebook page that the film and television rights to the entire \"Vampire Chronicles\" franchise had reverted to her and that she and her son, novelist Christopher Rice, would be \"developing a pilot script and a detailed outline for an open-ended series faithfully presenting Lestat’s story as it is told in the books, complete with many situations that readers expect to see.\" \n\nOn April 28, 2017, Rice released on her Facebook page the press released stating that the Vampire Chronicles have been optioned by Paramount Television and Anonymous Content.\n\nOn April 25, 2006, the musical \"Lestat\", based on Rice's \"Vampire Chronicles\" books, opened at the Palace Theatre on Broadway after having its world premiere in San Francisco, California, in December 2005. With music by Elton John and lyrics by Bernie Taupin, it was the inaugural production of the newly established Warner Brothers Theatre Ventures. Despite Rice's own overwhelming approval and praise, the show received disappointing attendance and largely negative reviews from critics. \"Lestat\" closed a month later on May 28, 2006, after just 33 previews and 39 regular performances. The release of the cast recording of the show is reportedly on hold indefinitely.\n\nSeveral of Anne Rice's novels have been adapted into comic books. Below is a list of adaptations to date, along with their publishers and years of publication.\n\n\nRice initially expressed an adamant stance against fan fiction based on her works, and particularly in opposition to such fiction based on \"The Vampire Chronicles\", releasing a statement on April 7, 2000, that disallowed all such efforts, citing copyright issues. She subsequently requested that FanFiction.Net remove stories featuring her characters. In 2012, \"Metro\" reported that Rice developed a milder stance on the issue. \"I got upset about 20 years ago because I thought it would block me,\" she said. \"However, it's been very easy to avoid reading any, so live and let live. If I were a young writer, I'd want to own my own ideas. But maybe fan fiction is a transitional phase: whatever gets you there, gets you there.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The woman later known as Táhirih, who played a central role in the religion of the Báb, was from an influential clerical family from Azerbaijan, which was then ruled by Russia. Russian diplomats later protected Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, before and after his exile from Persia. Around 1884, the religion began to spread into the Russian Empire, where the Bahá'í community in Ashgabat built the first Bahá'í House of Worship, elected one of the first Bahá'í local administrative institutions and became a center of scholarship. The Bahá'í Faith also attracted the attention of several Russian scholars and artists. During the Soviet period, Russia adopted the Soviet policy of oppression of religion, leading the Russian Bahá'í community to abandon its administration and properties in accordance with its principle of obedience to legal government, though Bahá'ís across the Soviet Union were nevertheless sent to prisons and camps or abroad. Before the dissolution of the Soviet Union Bahá'ís in several cities were able to gather and organize as Perestroyka spread from Moscow through many Soviet republics. The Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly of the Russian Federations was ultimately formed in 1995. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated the number of Bahá'ís in Russia at about 18,990 in 2005.\n\nIn the beginning of the earliest phase, the religion had strong connections with Azerbaijan during the Russian rule in Azerbaijan in the Russian Empire. Among the most notable facts is a woman of Azerbaijani background who would play a central role in the religion of the Báb, viewed by Bahá´ís as the direct predecessor of the Bahá'í Faith – she would be later named Tahirih, though her story would be in the context of Persia. She was among the Letters of the Living of the Báb.\n\nIn 1847, the Russian ambassador to Tehran, Prince Dimitri Ivanovich Dolgorukov, and other diplomats became aware of the claims of the Báb and seeing the fleeing of Bábís across the border requested that the Báb, then imprisoned at Maku, be moved elsewhere; he also condemned the massacres of Iranian religionists. Dolgorukov wrote some memoirs later in life but much of it has been shown to be a forgery. But his dispatches show that he was afraid of the movement spreading into the Caucasus.\n\nIn 1852, after a failed assassination attempt against the Shah of Persia for which the entire Bábí community was blamed, many Bábís, including Bahá'u'lláh, who had no role in the attempt and later severely condemned it, were arrested in a sweep. When Bahá'u'lláh was jailed by the Shah, his family went to Mírzá Majid Ahi who was married to a sister of Bahá'u'lláh, and was working as the secretary to the Russian Legation in Tehran. Bahá'u'lláh's family asked Mírzá Majid to go to Dolgorukov and ask him to intercede on behalf of Bahá'u'lláh, and Dolgorukov agreed however this assistance was short lived and again the memoirs are known to have many impossible dates in them. In addition, Bahá'u'lláh refused exile in Russia. In God Passes By, Shoghi Effendi alludes to the protection the Russian ambassador gave Bahá'u'lláh on different occasions, first after the attempted assassination of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar and again after the decision to exile Bahá’u’lláh from Iran, expressing his \"desire to take Bahá’u’lláh under the protection of his government, and offered to extend every facility for His removal to Russia.\"\n\nStarting in 1866, while in Adrianople, Bahá'u'lláh started writing a series of letters to world rulers, proclaiming his station as the promised one of all religions. His letters also asked them to renounce their material possessions, work together to settle disputes, and endeavour towards the betterment of the world and its peoples. Czar Alexander II of Russia was among them.\n\n“O Czar of Russia! Incline thine ear unto the voice of God, the King, the Holy, and turn thou unto Paradise, the Spot wherein abideth He Who, among the Concourse on high, beareth the most excellent titles, and Who, in the kingdom of creation, is called by the name of God, the Effulgent, the All-Glorious. Beware that nothing deter thee from setting thy face towards thy Lord, the Compassionate, the Most Merciful.”\n\nIn his Súriy-i-Haykal, Bahá’u’lláh included the Lawh-i-Malik-i-Rús, praising Czar Alexander II of Russia in these terms: \"when this Wronged One was sore-afflicted in prison, the minister of the highly esteemed government (of Russia)—may God, glorified and exalted be He, assist him!—exerted his utmost endeavor to compass My deliverance. Several times permission for My release was granted. Some of the ‘ulamás of the city, however, would prevent it. Finally, My freedom was gained through the solicitude and the endeavor of His Excellency the Minister. …His Imperial Majesty, the Most Great Emperor—may God, exalted and glorified be He, assist him!—extended to Me for the sake of God his protection—a protection which has excited the envy and enmity of the foolish ones of the earth.\"\n\nThe text of the letter from Bahá'u'lláh to the Shah carried by Badí‘ was sent to Russian scholars by Russian diplomats and a catalog of works made its way to E.G. Browne awakening his interests. A few scholars in St. Petersburg reviewed Babí activities including the arrest and banishment of a Bábí to Smolensk.\n\nWhile the Bahá'í Faith spread across the Russian Empire in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and attracted the attention of scholars and artists, the Bahá'í community in Ashgabat built the first Bahá'í House of Worship, elected one of the first Bahá'í local administrative institutions and was a center of scholarship.\n\nEarly 1900s Russian Orthodox missionaries shared warnings against the religion, asserting that it violated 'the feelings of loyalty towards the Russian White Czar' and the law of the land made it illegal for Russians to convert from Christianity to another religion.\n\nThere are several references to translations being undertaken of works into Russian in 1927 as well as correspondence with Bahá'ís in Moscow and Ashgabat.\n\nA group of Bábís formed in Nakhchivan and spread before 1850 largely of Persian expatriates who were fleeing persecution in Persia. This group was attacked by the Russian army, under the command of General Vasili Bebutov.\n\nFrom 1850 on, small communities established themselves in elsewhere in Azerbaijan. Soon the community of Baku counted the largest number of believers in the region and in 1860 obtained official recognition from the authorities. The community recognized the newly announced position of Bahá'u'lláh. Soon there was more public awareness and some favor from leaders of the broader community and at the same time the Bahá'í community of Baku broadened its communication with other Bahá'í communities in Russia, Turkey and Ashkhabad and did much work printing materials in Turkish. The most publicly recognized member of the community approaching 1900 was Musa Nagiyev, one of Azerbaijan's richest citizens of the times though there were many public figures before and after who seem to have admired the religion or even been members of it.\n\nSimilarly there were developments in to the north of Russian control. In Finland, contact began between traveling Scandinavians with early Persian believers of the religion led to published accounts in 1869, and the first mentions of Bahá'u'lláh were made in 1896 while Finland was politically part of the Russian Empire. In and during the Third Partition of Poland The first may have been in the 1870s when Polish writer wrote several articles covering its early history in Persia. This interaction was succeeded by writer Isabella Grinevskaya who joined the religion as well as interest by Leo Tolstoy (see below.)\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith in Turkmenistan begins before Russian advances into the region when the area was under the influence of Persia. By 1887 a community of Bahá'í refugees from religious violence in Persia had made something of a village in Ashgabat. Several years later — by 1894 — Russia made Turkmenistan part of the Russian Empire.\n\nInitially Russian diplomats observed the community as distinct from the Moslem one but being “closely knit community of honest, law-abiding people, somewhat reminiscent of the early Christian churches in the first century after Christ.”\n\nDuring that narrow period of time between 1887 and 1894, a court case was held following the assassination of a Bahá'í that for a time would vindicate the Bahá'ís. The Bahá'ís were represented by Mirza Abu'l-Fadl Gulpaygani along with Shaykh Muhammad-'Alí, each an Apostle of Bahá'u'lláh, individuals who played a vital role in the development in the early stages of the religion comparable to the apostles of Jesus. Gulpaygani lived in Ashgabat off and on from 1889 to 1894. A short time after moving there, the assassination of one of the Bahá'ís there, Haji Muhammad Rida Isfahani occurred and Gulpaygani helped the Bahá'í community to respond to this event and later he was the spokesman for the Bahá'ís at the trial of the assassins was initiated by Czar Alexander III through a military commission from St. Petersburg. This event established the independence of the Bahá'í Faith from Islam both for the Russian government and for the people of Ashgabat. Under the protection and freedom given by the Russian authorities, the number of Bahá'ís in the community rose to 4,000 (1,000 children) by 1918 and for the first time anywhere in the world a true Bahá'í community was established, with its own hospitals, schools, workshops, newspapers, and a cemetery. This first Bahá'í House of Worship was constructed inside the city of Ashgabat. The design of the building was started in 1902, and the construction was completed in 1908 and was supervised by Vakílu'd-Dawlih, The city's general population was between 44 and 50 thousand at this time.\n\nWithin the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh, the religion was established in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, then under Russian control. While in Samarkand in 1892 Gulpaygani wrote a book, \"Fassl-ul-Khitab\" (Conclusive Proof), in response to the questions of Mirza Haydar-Ali of Tabriz. It was in Samarkand, too, that he debated a Protestant preacher. In 1910 the Samarkand Bahá'í community elected its first assembly in addition to having a school, and built a center which held four meetings a week.\n\nIn Tashkand, a community of Bahá'ís had expanded to about 1900 members, supporting a library, Persian and Russian language schools, and large meetings were being advertised with the permission of government authorities. Bahá'í literature published in Tashkand included several works of `Abdu'l-Bahá, the next head of the religion.\n\nAfter the death of Gulpaygani, his papers, including several unfinished works, were taken to Ashqabat, where his nephew lived; many of these papers were, however, lost after the Russian Revolution of 1917.\n\nAbout nine Russian intellectuals or artists investigated the religion to varying degrees. Among the more well known and closest to the religion are Alexander Tumansky, Isabella Grinevskaya, and Leo Tolstoy. Lidia Zamenhof also was active towards the end of the period and into the Soviet era. Among the lesser known but more substantive in gathering original materials and from an earlier dates from the 1860s would be Jean-Albert Bernard Dorn and Nicolai Vladimirovich Khanykov both from St. Petersburg. Together their work was collected and published in Russian by Viktor Rosen and another book beginning to include works written by Bahá'u'lláh was done by Alexander Kasimovich Kazembek.\n\nAn early translation of the Kitab-i-Aqdas into Russian was done by orientalist Alexander Tumansky published in about 1899. He befriended the Bahá'ís in Ashgabat during the trial where Gulpaygani wrote a treatise for him on the \"Risáliy-i Iskandaríyyh\" as a summary of the life of the founder. Later Tumansky was a professor of Arabic language at Tiflis.\n\nIsabella Grinevskaya was the pen name of a very early Russian Bahá'í born in Grodno. Grodno was sometimes part of Poland and Belarus but during her entire lifetime was part of Russia. She is well known because of a play she wrote called \"Báb\" which was performed in St. Petersburg in 1904 and again in 1916/7, translated into French and Tatar, and later wrote a play \"Bahá'u'lláh\" though it was never staged.\n\nLeo Tolstoy corresponded on the Bábí and Bahá'í Faiths from 1894 until shortly before his death in 1910. His correspondents, who also sent him translations of Bahá'í writings, include Bahá’ís such as , Isabella Grinevskaya, Dr. Yúnis Khán-i-Afrúkhtih, and ‘Ali-Akbar Nakhjavání (father of Alí-Yulláh Nakhjavání.) In the fall of 1902 Mirza 'Azizu'llah visited Tolstoy with a personal message from `Abdu'l-Bahá and discussed the history and teachings of the religion during a period of house arrest that followed his excommunication from the Orthodox church. Elsewhere `Abdu'l-Bahá suggests that Tolstoy was a well-wisher of humanity but that he was still caught up in politics and opinion. Luigi Stendardo’s thesis “Tolstoj et la Foi Bahá’íe” (later revised and published in English as \"Leo Tolstoy and the Bahá’í Faith\") provides an excellent analysis of Tolstoy’s changing views on the religion. Tolstoy ended life feeling that he could possibly subscribe to the religion but at the same time had major reservations with regard to the Bahá’í doctrine of the Manifestation of God, which insists that God is knowable only through his Manifestations, that these Manifestations are in essence different from and above other humans and that they are infallible. In sum Tolsoy, despite his inability to accept some Bahá’í doctrines, was able to declare that “the teachings of the Bábís which come to us out of Islam have through Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings been gradually developed and now present us with the highest and purest form of religious teaching”.\n\nLidia Zamenhof, the youngest daughter of Ludwig Zamenhof, was born in 1904 in Warsaw, then in the Russian Empire. She was an active promoter of Esperanto and around 1925 she became a member of the religion. Through her efforts and a Russian translation of \"Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era\" the first Ukrainian joined the religion in 1939.\n\nSince its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socioeconomic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. However, only in the brief period before the 1930s in the Soviet Union were Bahá'ís able to provide services based on their teachings. After that Soviet member states adopted the Soviet policy of oppression of religion, so the Bahá'ís, strictly adhering to their principle of obedience to legal government, abandoned its administration and properties. For example, in 1924 Bahá'ís in Turkistan had schools and a special committee for the advancement of women. All such developments were dissolved in the face of advances of policies on religion in the Soviet era.\n\nIn 1922 early Bahá'í Wellesley Tudor Pole began a long association with a project aimed at relieving the oppression the Bolsheviks imposed on religionists in Russia.\n\n`Alí-Akbar Furútan, born 1905, moved with his family to Ashgabat in what was then Russian Turkestan and, through his years of school and university, he took an active part in the work of the Bahá'í communities of Ashgabat, Baku, Moscow, and other parts of Russia. He attended secondary school in Ashgabat and later graduated from Moscow University with a degree in psychology and child education. In 1930 he was expelled from the Soviet Union during the Stalinist persecution of religion, and, from that time on, played an ever more significant role in the work and administration of the Iranian Bahá'í community. Other tales of arrests and forced deportations are noted as early as March. Nevertheless, the head of the religion personally covered the costs of translating the Hidden Words into Russian in 1933.\n\nRules against the religion began in 1922 of a general nature. Then in 1926 Bahá'ís in Moscow were detained, printed materials confiscated and some homes seized. Communist anit-Bahá'í pamphlets had been produced and encyclopedic articles were published in 1930 and 1933 partially reacting to the success of the religion reaching those who rejected by Islam and Communism.\n\nQueen consort Marie of Romania had received a brooch from her royal relatives in Russia in previous decades. Circa 1926 she joined the religion and gave this brooch to Martha Root who in turn sent it as a gift to the first Bahá'í House of Worship of the West where it was sold to raise money for the contraction to a Willard Hatch. In 1931 he took it with him when he went on Bahá'í pilgrimage where with approval of Shoghi Effendi it was placed in the archives of the religion.\n\nIn 1938 \"monstrous accusations\" accusing Bahá'ís of being 'closely linked with the leaders of Trotskyite-Bukharinist and Dashnak-Musavat bands'. Following this numerous arrests and oppression of the religion, Bahá'ís across the Soviet Union were being sent to prisons and camps or sent abroad. Bahá'í communities in 38 cities across Soviet territories ceased to exist. In Tashkent Bahá'ís were interrogated and imprisoned. Aqa Habibullah Baqiroff of Tashkent was sentenced to ten years imprisonment \"in the neighbourhood of the North Sea and the polar forests.\" Many were sent to Pavlodar in northern Kazakhstan. (See Bahá'í Faith in Kazakhstan.)\n\nBy 1946 in all Turkestan only Ashgabat, Samarkand and Tashkand communities continued. Bahá'ís had managed to re-enter various countries of the Eastern Bloc through the 1950s, following a plan of the head of the religion at the time, Shoghi Effendi. But by 1956 there is a vague mention of an operating community of Bahá'ís in Uzbekistan. In 1955 a delegation of Russian journalists to America were forbidden to visit the North American Bahá'í House of Worship. The 1957 letter of the head of the religion challenged Bahá'ís to find a way to have one Bahá'í in each Soviet Republic on the European continent: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, White Russia, Moldavia and Ukraine.\n\nIn 1962 in \"Religion in the Soviet Union\", Walter Kolarz notes: \"Islam…is attacked by the communists because it is 'reactionary', encourages nationalist narrowmindness and obstructs the education and emancipation of women. Baha'iism(sic) has incurred communist displeasure for exactly the opposite reasons. It is dangerous to Communism because of its broadmindness, its tolerance, its international outlook, the attention it pays to women's education and its insistence on equality of the sexes. All this contradicts the communist thesis about the backwardness of all religions.\"\n\nA pair of small communities are listed in 1963 - Tashkand and an isolated Bahá'í in Fergana. The Universal House of Justice, the head of the religion since 1963, then recognized small Bahá'í presence across the USSR of about 200 Bahá'ís.\n\nIn 1973 two aides and their wives from the Russian delegation to Panama went on a brief tour of the House of Worship built there. There are reports of sporadic arrests and interviews in Ashgabat by the KGB as late as 1982. However, in November 1987 the second Secretary in the Russian Embassy to India escorted the USSR's Ambassador-at-Large to the Bahá'í Lotus Temple and later a group of 120 performing artists from the Bolshoi Theatre of Russia visited it too. And the Bahá'í Publishing Trust of Germany was able to have a booth at the sixth International Book Fair in Moscow. Russian diplomats in India as well as ballet dancers again visited the Indian House of Worship in 1988 and 1989 this time including Orthodox Church leaders, film personalities, poets and intellectuals. Also in 1989 twenty-six Bahá'ís from Finland took part in a \"Peace and Environmental Festival\" in Murmansk.\n\nAs Perestroyka approached, the Bahá'ís began to organize and get in contact with each other.\n\nBefore the Dissolution of the Soviet Union Bahá'ís in several cities were able to gather and organize. The Bahá'í community of Ashgabat was the first to re-form its Local Spiritual Assembly approximately in 1987 and had doubled its numbers from 1989 to 1991 and had successfully registered with the city government of Ashgabat. From 1988 the Bahá'ís in Moscow and then in Baku became active (see also Bahá'í Faith in Ukraine.) Bahá'ís in Azerbaijan sought recognition from the State Department of Religion of Azerbaijan. By the end of 1990, after 50 almost years, the election for the Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Baku was held followed by other communities before 1992.\n\nIn this brief time `Alí-Akbar Furútan was able to return in 1990 as the guest of honor at the election of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the Soviet Union. Continuing the popularity of the Indian Bahá'í House of Worship, individuals from multiple cities of Russia and former Soviet republics, as well as groups of researchers, reporters, and their families went in winter 1989 and spring 1990.\n\nHowever, as the nations established themselves they began drawing up laws regulating religions to the point all the Bahá'í communities were de-established. In 1995 in Turkmenistan, 500 adult religious adherent citizens were required in each locality in order for a religious community to be registered. Thus by 1997 the Bahá'ís were unregistered by the government along with several other religious communities, and more than just being unable to form administrative institutions, own properties like temples, and publish literature, perform scholarly work and community service projects -their membership in a religion is simply unrecognized, the religion is considered banned, and homes are raided for Bahá'í literature. As of 2007, under these harsh conditions, the Bahá'í community in Turkmenistan has still been unable to reach the required number of adult believers to be recognized by the government as a religion.\n\nIn 1992 the Parliament of Azerbaijan adopted the law of religious liberty and Bahá'ís gained an opportunity to officially register communities and the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Azerbaijan was elected, effectively disbanded since 1938. In 1993 the Governing Board of the Ministry of Justice of the Azerbaijan Republic gave official permission for the functioning of the Bahá'í Community of Baku.\n\nThe Bahá'ís of Baku are seeking the return of property confiscated during the Soviet era—especially a house that served as the Bahá'í Center.\n\nIn the case of Russia proper the situation was similar. From 1990 to 1997 Bahá'ís had operated in some freedom, growing to 20 groups of Bahá'ís registered with the federal government, but the Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations passed in 1997 is generally seen as unfriendly to minority religions though it hasn't frozen further registrations.\n\nBecause of the quick pace of the Dissolution of the Soviet Union simultaneously with the religious freedoms initially achieved, local, regional and national assemblies formed and evolved in parallel. The first Local Spiritual Assembly of Moscow was elected in 1990 followed by a summer Bahá'í school attended by some 60 Bahá'ís from across the region and followed by a public concert. The National Spiritual Assembly (NSA) of the USSR was elected in 1991 which in 1992 became the NSA of Russia, Georgia & Armenia, and then in 1995 became NSA of the Russian Federation, while over the same period various Soviet republics formed their own NSAs from 1992 through 1994.\n\nIn the late summer of 1992, members of the Marion Jack Teaching Project who were working mostly within Russia at the time, came to Mongolia to participate in a concerted effort to share the religion with a wider range of Mongolians.\n\nUlaanbaatar was the gathering place for more than 1,800 Bahá'ís from Mongolia and Russia in 2008.\n\nAfter Liudmila St. Onge (Luda) was interested in the religion while in America she mentioned she was on her way to Russia. She was encouraged to seek out the Baha'is in Moscow and in Russia officially joined the religion. Luda’s trip to Russia lasted much longer than anticipated, as she decided to introduce her new business of scrapbooking to Russia. This has proven very successful. She returned to New Hampshire in July 2010, and informed the local Baha'is that she had joined the religion and was eager return.\n\nFiruz Kazemzadeh is a noted scholar on Russian history, born in Moscow, and an active Bahá'í in the United States. He has published several works on Russian history.\n\nThe Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated about 18,990 Bahá'ís in 2005.\n\nBoth Soviet and Iranian governments produced trumped up charges against the religion as an excuse to pursue a violent oppression of the religion. In the case of the Soviets in 1938 \"monstrous accusations\" accusing Bahá'ís of being 'closely linked with the leaders of Trotskyite-Bukharinist and Dashnak-Musavat bands'. Following this numerous arrests and oppression of the religion, Bahá'ís across the Soviet Union were being sent to prisons and camps or sent abroad. Bahá'í communities in 38 cities across Soviet territories ceased to exist.\n\nIn the case of modern Iran it used the history of conflict between Iran and Russia as a circumstance to find Bahá'ís blameworthy. During the 19th century Russia had been expanding south and east into Central Asia toward India where Britain held power at the time. A rivalry started between Britain and Russia over territorial and political control in Central Asia followed. The middle zone of land was where both Russia and Britain worked to gain influence. Struggles in the region lead to Persian antagonism to both foreign powers. Muslim clerics and other anti-Bahá'í groups connected the Bahá'í Faith, and its predecessor the Bábí movement, to the external governments of Britain and Russia to project the mistrust of these two latter groups onto the Bahá'ís.\n\nIn addition to government and clergy-led persecution of the Bahá'ís, Iranian government officials and others have claimed that Bahá'ís have had ties to foreign powers, and were agents of Russian imperialism and more. These accusations against the Bahá'ís have been disputed, and described as misconceptions, with no basis in historical fact. Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, taught that Bahá'ís are to be loyal to one's government, not be involved in politics, and to obey the laws of the country they reside in.\n\nThe foundation of much of the propaganda relating the Bahá'í Faith to Russian influence is a memoir attributed to Dimitri Ivanovich Dolgorukov who was the Russian ambassador to Persia from 1846 to 1854. The memoir states that Dolgorukov created the Bábí and Bahá'í religions so as to weaken Iran and Shi'a Islam. The memoir was first published in 1943 in Persian in Mashhad, and shortly thereafter published again in Tehran with some of the most glaring errors corrected. The book still, however, contains so many historical errors that it is inconceivable that it is genuine.\n\nAnd for all the assistance that may have come from Russian diplomats they neither intervened, nor voiced opposition, when thousands of Bahá'ís were killed later even when other Europeans did. In addition, Bahá'u'lláh refused exile in Russia.\n\n\n\n"}

In the Roman Catholic Church it remains a separate title, but in the Church of Ireland it has been united with other bishoprics.\n\nThe see of Kilmore was originally known as Breifne (Latin: \"Tirbrunensis\", \"Tybruinensis\" or \"Triburnia\"; Irish: \"Tír mBriúin\", meaning \"the land of the descendants of Brian\", one of the kings of Connaught) and took its name after the Kingdom of Breifne.\n\nThe see became one of the dioceses approved by Cardinal Giovanni Paparoni at the synod of Kells in 1152, and has approximately the same boundaries as those of the ancient Kingdom of Breifne. In the Irish annals, the bishops were recorded of \"Breifne\", \"Breifni\", \"Breifny\", \"Tir-Briuin\", or \"Ui-Briuin-Breifne\".\n\nIn the second half of the 12th century, it is likely the sees of Breifne and Kells were ruled together under one bishop. In 1172, Tuathal Ua Connachtaig took the oath of fealty to King Henry II of England as bishop of Kells. Soon after 1211 the see of Kells was incorporated into the diocese of Meath.\n\nIn 1454, Pope Nicholas V gave permission for the then bishop, Aindrias Mac Brádaigh (Anglicised: Andrew McBrady), to have the ancient church at Kilmore, founded in the 6th century by Saint Felim (or Feithlimidh), to be the cathedral church of the diocese. This building passed into the hands of the Church of Ireland at the Reformation, and, following the construction of a new cathedral, is now used as a parochial hall.\n\nAfter the upheavals of the Reformation, there were parallel apostolic successions: one of the Church of Ireland and the other of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn the Church of Ireland, the title was intermittently held with Ardagh until they were finally united in 1839. In 1841, the sees of Kilmore and Ardagh were amalgamated with Elphin to form the united bishopric of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh. The current incumbent is The Right Reverend Samuel Ferran Glenfield M.A. M.Th. (Oxon.) M.Litt. He was elected, consecrated, and installed in 2013.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic, the title continues as a separate bishopric. The current Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kilmore is the Most Reverend Philip Leo O'Reilly, who succeeded as the diocesan bishop on 16 October and installed at the Cathedral Church of Saints Patrick and Felim, Cavan on 15 November 1998. He had been appointed coadjutor bishop of Kilmore by the Holy See on 20 November 1996 and received episcopal ordination on 2 February 1997.\n\nDuring the Reformation, Edmund Nugent and John MacBrady were at one time or another bishops of either the Church of Ireland or Roman Catholic succession. They were each appointed as Roman Catholic bishops, but later accepted or recognized as Anglican bishops.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3060479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3060479", "title": "Brahma Kumaris", "text": "Brahma Kumaris\n\nThe Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University (Prajapita Brahma Kumaris Ishwariya Vishwa Vidyalaya or BKWSU) is a new religious movement that originated in Hyderabad, Sindh, during the 1930s. The Brahma Kumaris (, \"People of Brahma\") movement was founded by Dada Lekhraj Kripalani, who later took the name Brahma Baba. It is distinctly identified by the prominent role that women play in the movement.\n\nIt teaches a form of meditation that focuses on identity as souls, as opposed to bodies. They believe that all souls are intrinsically good and that God is the source of all goodness. The university teaches to transcend labels associated with the body, such as race, nationality, religion, and gender, and it aspires to establish a global culture based on what it calls \"soul-consciousness\".\n\nIn 2008, the movement claimed to have more than 825,000 regular students, with over 8,500 centres in 100 countries.\n\nThe Brahma Kumaris, originally called \"Om Mandali\", started in Hyderabad, Sindh in north-west India. It received this name because members would chant \"Om\" together, before having discourse on spiritual matters in the traditional satsang style. The original discourses were closely connected to the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nThe founder, Dada Lekhraj Khubchand Kripilani (who became known in the group as \"Om Baba\") was a wealthy jeweller who was respected in the community for his piety. He reported what he said were a series of visions and other transcendental experiences that commenced around 1935 and became the basis for the discourses. He said he believed there was a greater power working through him and that many of those who attended these gatherings were themselves having spiritual experiences. The majority of those who came were women and children from the Bhaibund caste - a caste of wealthy merchants and business people whose husbands and fathers were often overseas on business.\n\nAfter about three years of meetings it became clear that \"Om Mandali\" was giving very special importance to the role of women, and was not adhering to the caste system. The group had named a 22-year-old woman, Radhe Pokardas Rajwani (then known as \"Om Radhe\") as its president, and her management committee was made up of eight other women. People from any caste were allowed to attend meetings. The group also advocated that young women had the right to elect not to marry and that married women had the right to choose a celibate life. In tradition-bound patriarchal India, these personal life decisions were the exclusive right of men. A committee headed by a number of important male members of the Bhaibund community began to form in opposition and became known as the 'Anti-Om Mandali Committee'. On 21 June 1938 this group picketed Om Mandali's premises preventing members from entering. This caused considerable upheaval in the community. Women attending were verbally abused, there was an attempt to burn the premises down and the police made several arrests. Many women and girls were later victims of domestic violence in their homes. The picketing resulted in criminal proceedings being taken against both groups, and on 16 August 1938 the local District Magistrate ordered that Om Mandali be prevented from meeting. This ban was reversed on 21 November 1938 after an appeal to the Court of the Judicial Commissioner of Sind. In an unusual move the judges directly criticised the District Magistrate for trying to punish the victims for the disturbance caused by the perpetrators and for trying to apply the law according to his own personal bias. Nevertheless, in an increasingly sour atmosphere, \"Om Mandali\" had decided to leave Hyderabad and gradually relocated its activities to Karachi in the latter half of 1938. Approximately 300 members moved.\nOn 31 March 1939 the government appointed a tribunal to inquire into the activities of \"Om Mandali\". When the Tribunal made its findings, Om Radhe responded by compiling a book titled \"Is this Justice?\" criticising the tribunal, which did not have a constitutional basis and made its findings without taking evidence from \"Om Mandali\". In May 1939 the government used the tribunal's findings to effectively reinstate the ban, declaring \"Om Mandali\" an \"unlawful association\" under section 16 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1908. Nevertheless, \"Om Mandali\" continued to hold their Satsangs, and the government did not enforce it. Possibly because of this the committee then hired someone to kill Om Baba, but the attempt was unsuccessful.\n\nIn May 1950 Om Mandali moved to Mount Abu in Rajasthan India. From the beginning, the organization's focus had been on education, not worship, and for this reason it renamed itself as Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University.\nIn 1952, after a 14-year period of retreat, a more structured form of teaching began to be offered to the public by way of a seven lesson course.\n\nAfter an unpromising beginning when it almost ran out of funds, from the mid 1950s the Brahma Kumaris began an international expansion programme. Since the 1970s it first spread to London and then to the West. The most visible manifestations of the religion are its \"Spiritual Museums\" located in most major Indian cities.\n\nIn 1980 the Brahma Kumaris became affiliated to the United Nations Department of Public Relations as a Non-Governmental Organisation. In 1983 the Brahma Kumaris achieved consultative status with the Economic and Social Council at the United Nations. The Brahma Kumaris now has a permanent office space in New York for their work with the United Nations.\n\nThe leadership and membership of the BK movement remains primarily female, for example, in the UK only one-third of the 42 centres are run by males and 80% of the membership are women. , centres are mostly in followers' own homes with a tendency toward middle or upper class membership. Estimates for its worldwide membership ranges from 35,000 in 1993 to 400,000 in 1998 to 450,000 in 2000, however, it is reported that many were probably not completely committed to the group's worldview.\n\nThe movement has distinguished itself from its Hindu roots and sees itself as a vehicle for spiritual teaching rather than as a religion.\n\nThe Brahma Kumaris see humans as being made up of two parts; an external or visible body (including extensions such as status and possessions) and a subtle energy of the soul whose character structure is revealed through a person's external activity - but always this is created by the inner soul -whether actions are done with love, peacefully, with happiness or humility is an aspect of one's soul. The group teaches that the soul is an infinitesimal point of spiritual light residing in the forehead of the body it occupies, and that all souls originally existed with God in a \"Soul World\", a world of infinite light, peace and silence.\n\nThe Brahma Kumaris teach that souls enter bodies to take birth in order to experience life and give expression to their personality. Unlike other Eastern traditions, the Brahma Kumaris do not believe that the human soul can transmigrate into other species.\n\nThe Brahma Kumaris use the term \"Supreme Soul\" to refer to God. They see God as incorporeal and eternal, and regard him as a point of living light like human souls, but without a physical body, as he does not enter the cycle of birth, death and rebirth. God is seen as the perfect and constant embodiment of all virtues, powers and values and that He is the unconditionally loving Father of all souls, irrespective of their religion, gender, or culture.\n\nThe Brahma Kumaris believe God's purpose to be the spiritual re-awakening of humanity and the removal of all sorrow, evil and negativity. They do not regard him as the creator of matter, as they consider matter to be eternal.\n\nPratibha Patil, the UPA-Left candidate and former President of India said on camera during the Indian presidential election, 2007, that she spoke to \"Baba\" (a term the BKs use for God) of the Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University at their headquarters in Mount Abu, Rajasthan. Patil stated that when she met Baba He had indicated great responsibility was coming her way.\n\nThe Brahma Kumaris believe that every action performed by a soul will create a return accordingly, and that the destiny of the soul’s next body depends on how it acts and behaves in this life. Through meditation, by transforming thinking patterns and eventually actions, the Brahma Kumaris believe that people can purify their \"karmic account\" and lead a better life in the present and next birth. \n\nIn contrast to linear theories of human history that hypothesize an ancient point of origin for the universe and a final destruction, the BKs do not posit a start, end or age for the universe, believing such concepts to be an erroneous application of the human life cycle to the universe. BKs believe the universe to follow an eternal, naturally occurring 5,000 year cycle, composed of four ages (\"yugas\"): the Golden Age (\"Sat Yuga\"), the Silver Age (\"Treta Yuga\"), the Copper Age (\"Dwapar Yuga\"), the Iron Age (\"Kali Yuga\") and each represents 1250 years of the cycle. The present period of this cycle is sometimes described as a fifth age or \"Confluence age\" as it is considered to be the confluence (the junction or meeting) between the Iron Age and the Golden age.\n\nThe first half of the cycle (the Golden and Silver ages) is considered to be the age of \"soul conscious living\". The Brahma Kumaris see this as a time of \"heaven on earth\" or as a version of the Garden of Eden when human beings are fully virtuous, complete, self-realised beings who lived in complete harmony with the natural environment. The primary enlightenment was the innate understanding of the self as a soul.\nshiv baba\n\nThe present time is believed to bring great global transformation as the world is transitioning from its present Iron Age to begin a new Golden age. The Brahma Kumaris believe that modern civilization is unsustainable and that economic and environmental pressures will ultimately boil over into civil and global conflict, coupled with natural calamities. They believe that there will always be a human population on Earth and that cataclysmic events form part of a natural and cathartic cyclic process.\n\nWhen the organisation began, emphasis was placed on the physical destruction of the world as seen in the cataclysmic visions of Dada Lekhraj. As the organisation developed, it witnessed World War II, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Cold War, and the destructive aspects of its teachings were reframed as a process of transformation. The students of the organization had also made many failed predictions of the violent destruction of the world, between 1987 and 2008 and the original teachings also referred to a particular date 1976\n, aspects which are now downplayed.\n\nThe Brahma Kumaris teaches a form of meditation through which students are encouraged to purify their minds. This may be done by sitting tranquilly, then making affirmations regarding the eternal nature of the soul, the original purity of one's nature, and the nature of God. The aim of the BK meditation is also to learn to hold meditative states while being engaged in everyday life.\n\nFlowing on from the BK belief that everyone is a spiritual being, is the practice of \"Shubhawna\" (pure feelings) and \"Shubkamna\" (good wishes). For BKs, all prejudices and ill-feelings are seen as arising from identifying the self and others based on external labels like race, religion, gender, nationality, beauty (or lack of), etc. However, when there is the practice of finding the intrinsic goodness in each one, the prejudice based on those labels is replaced by the vision of one Spiritual Parent, one Human family, and universal spiritual values such as respect, love, peace and happiness. A flagship slogan for the BKs has been \"When we change, the world changes\". It is for this reason that BKs consider bringing about this kind of change within the self as an important form of \"world service\".\n\nBrahma Kumaris' students study the murli. The Hindi word \"murli\" literally translates to \"flute\". It is an oral study, read to the class early each morning in most BK centres on the world. The murlis are derived from mediumship and spirit possession.\n\nThere are two types of murli: \n\nAvyakt murlis are still being spoken at the BKs headquarters in India. Students must complete the Brahma Kumaris foundation course and start by attending morning Murli class before visiting the headquarters.\n\nBrahma Kumaris recommend a specific lifestyle in order achieve greater control over physical senses. However, many participate in a casual way, electing to adopt whichever beliefs and lifestyle disciplines in the following list they wish:\n\n\nThe Brahma Kumaris at the United Nations is an international non-governmental organisation (NGO) in general consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. and UNICEF. It is associated with the UN Department of Public Information. It was granted International Peace Messenger Initiative status by the UN for the Global Co-operation for a Better World campaign and has permanent office space in New York City for their work at the United Nations.\n\nIt is one of over 1600 accredited observer organizations to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change,\n\nTraditionally, the Brahma Kumaris conducted an \"introduction to meditation\" consisting of seven one-hour-long sessions. The sessions include their open-eyed meditation technique and philosophy. The organisation also offers courses in \"positive thinking\", \"self management leadership\" and \"living values\". They also have a number of voluntary outreach programs in prisons.\n\nWith the support of Vicente Fox, the Brahma Kumaris introduced their meditation practice and philosophy to the government of Mexico through the \"Self Management Leadership\" (SML). The SML course is closely related to the Brahma Kumaris philosophy and is the backbone of Brahma Kumaris management philosophy. 90 trained facilitators ran programs through which 25,000 people at the top level of government have passed.\n\nThe Brahma Kumaris have launched several environment initiatives. Their work in solar energy and sustainable energy has included the 2007 development of the world's largest solar cooker, and a solar thermal power plant in Talheti at the base of Mount Abu, where the international headquarters is located. The 25-acre site is projected to produce 22000 kwh of electricity daily. The project was made financially possible with the support of the Indian and German governments.\n\nThe Brahma Kumaris expansion in size has led to a greater participation in more mainstream community services.\n\nSustainable Yogic Agriculture (SYA) is a program started in Northern India in 2009. The program has been a collaboration between Sardarkrushinagar Dantiwada Agricultural University in Gujarat India and the Brahma Kumaris Rural Development wing. The program has now been publicly backed by the Indian Government. A key member of Narendra Modi's Cabinet, Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh announced the governments support for the program. With the governments support the program has been redesigned into Akhil Bharatiya Krushak Sashakatikaran Abhijan (ABKSA), and was launched in December 2015. ABKSA extends the initial scope of the SYA program to include teaching meditation and self empowerment to the farmers themselves. This is possibly a response to the problem of farmer suicides in India. ABKSA now comprises three main elements:\nOne basic premise of the Brahma Kumaris environmental initiative is that thoughts and consciousness can affect the natural environment. More esoteric approaches to plant development are nothing new, perhaps most widely known is Findhorn Ecovillage. \nIn 2012, experiments were being conducted in partnership with leading agricultural universities in India to establish if the practice of Brahma Kumaris meditation in conjunction with implementing more traditional organic farming methods could be shown to have a measurable and positive affect on crop development. An article published in the Journal of Asian Agri-History reviews two separate studies on SYA. One study was conducted by G.B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology (GBPUAT), Pantnagar, Uttarakhand and the other by Sardarkrushinagar Dantiwada Agricultural University (SDUAT) of Gujarat. The review reports that the Brahma Kumaris meditation techniques used enhanced seed growth, seed germination rates and increased the level of microbes present in the soil.\n\nAdherents have been criticised by nonmembers for hiding or downplaying their prophesied physical destruction of the world particularly as they still believe that such an event will happen \"soon\". However, they maintain that their primary purpose is to teach meditation and peace of mind, not to push their views about the different challenges the world is facing on nonmembers who may be visiting the group to learn about meditation or values based living.\n\nIn the \"Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion\", Howell reported that the Brahma Kumaris protected itself from the practice of families \"dumping\" their daughters with the organisation by requiring a payment from the families of those wishing to dedicate their daughters to the work and services of the organisation. The payment is intended to cover the living expenses incurred during the trial period.\n\nJohn Wallis wrote a book examining the status of tradition in the contemporary world, which used the religion as a case study, focusing on recruitment methods, the issue of celibacy, reinterpretation of religious history. He reported the rewriting of the revelatory messages (Murlis) by the Brahma Kumari. They have been accused of breaking up marriages.\n\nWhen the organisation started, empowering women to assert their right to remain celibate, particularly in marriage, was a prime factor in the controversy that arose in 1930s Sind, as it directly challenged the dominance of men over women in patriarchal Indian subcontinent. Overlooking the organisation's predominantly-female leadership and that this practice was adopted by both men and women equally, feminist commentator Prem Chowdry has criticised the practice of celibacy within the organisation as being a form of patriarchal control.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

From then on he ministered to people with spiritual oppression. He said of exorcisms that, \"when one experiences it face-to-face -- when one sees evil, smells it, feels it, has things thrown in his face, encounters evil prowling around like a lion -- then you know there's a spiritual warfare going on all around us.\"\n\nIn 1998, after twenty-seven years as a pastor at Southern Baptist churches in Maryland and South Carolina he left his ministry to become a full-time exorcist and run his deliverance ministry. Connor believed that spiritual oppression is a real part of biblical metaphysics, which includes angels, demons and Satan.\n\nConnor stated that even people who go to church regularly or minister can still be oppressed. \"By belonging to Jesus Christ, we are forgiven in terms of salvation,\" he explained. \"We can still make wrong choices which open doors within us to satanic oppression by dabbling in the occult, attempting to communicate with the dead, using crystals, accepting New Age beliefs, following spirit guides, participating in rituals.\" \"Anytime someone reaches out to an evil spirit, that spirit puts down roots and will torment and oppress that person,\" Connor stated.\n\nOn November 13, 2001, he appeared on \"Dateline NBC\" casting demons out of an American baptist.

{"id": "21234688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21234688", "title": "Brownie (folklore)", "text": "Brownie (folklore)\n\nA brownie or broonie (Scots), also known as a brùnaidh or gruagach (Scottish Gaelic), is a household spirit from British folklore that is said to come out at night while the owners of the house are asleep and perform various chores and farming tasks. The human owners of the house must leave a bowl of milk or cream or some other offering for the brownie, usually by the hearth. Brownies are described as easily offended and will leave their homes forever if they feel they have been insulted or in any way taken advantage of. Brownies are characteristically mischievous and are often said to punish or pull pranks on lazy servants. If angered, they are sometimes said to turn malicious, like boggarts.\n\nBrownies originated as domestic tutelary spirits, very similar to the Lares of ancient Roman tradition. Descriptions of brownies vary regionally, but they are usually described as ugly, brown-skinned, and covered in hair. In the oldest stories, they are usually human-sized or larger. In more recent times, they have come to be seen as small and wizened. They are often capable of turning invisible and they sometimes appear in the shapes of animals. They are always either naked or dressed in rags. If a person attempts to present a brownie with clothing or if a person attempts to baptize him, he will leave forever.\n\nAlthough the name \"brownie\" originated as a dialectal word used only in northern England and Scotland, it has since become the standard term for all such creatures throughout Great Britain. Regional variants in England and Scotland include hobs, silkies, and ùruisgs. Variants outside England and Scotland are the Welsh Bwbach and the Manx Fenodyree. Brownies have also appeared outside of folklore, including in John Milton's poem \"L'Allegro\". They became popular in works of children's literature in the late nineteenth century and continue to appear in works of modern fantasy. The Brownies in the Girl Guides are named after a short story by Juliana Horatia Ewing based on brownie folklore.\n\nBrownies originated as domestic tutelary spirits, very similar to the Lares of ancient Roman tradition, who were envisioned as the protective spirits of deceased ancestors. Brownies and Lares are both regarded as solitary and devoted to serving the members of the house. Both are said to be hairy and dress in rags and both are said to demand offerings of food or dairy. Like Lares, brownies were associated with the dead and a brownie is sometimes described as the ghost of a deceased servant who once worked in the home. The Cauld Lad of Hilton, for instance, was reputed to be the ghost of a stable boy who was murdered by one of the Lords of Hilton Castle in a fit of passion. Those who saw him described him as a naked boy. He was said to clean up anything that was untidy and make messes of things that were tidy.\n\nThe family cult of deceased ancestors in ancient times centred around the hearth, which later became the place where offerings would be left for the brownie. The most significant difference between brownies and Lares is that, while Lares were permanently bound to the house in which they lived, brownies are seen as more mobile, capable of leaving or moving to another house if they became dissatisfied. One story describes a brownie who left the house after the stingy housewife fired all the servants because the brownie was doing all the work and refused to return until all the servants had been re-hired.\n\nTraditions about brownies are generally similar across different parts of Great Britain. They are said to inhabit homes and farms. They only work at night, performing necessary housework and farm tasks while the human residents of the home are asleep. The presence of the brownie is believed to ensure household prosperity and the human residents of the home are expected to leave offerings for the brownie, such as a bowl of cream or porridge, or a small cake. These are usually left on the hearth. The brownie will punish household servants who are lazy or slovenly by pinching them while they sleep, breaking or upsetting objects around them, or causing other mischief. Sometimes they are said to create noise at night or leave messes simply for their own amusement. In some early stories, brownies are described as guarding treasure, a non-domestic task outside of their usual repertoire.\n\nBrownies are almost always described as solitary creatures who work alone and avoid being seen. There is rarely said to be more than one brownie living in the same house. Usually, the brownie associated with a house is said to live in a specific place, such as a particular nearby cave, stream, rock, or pond. Some individual brownies are occasionally given names. Around 1650, a brownie at Overthwaite in Westmorland was known as \"Tawny Boy\" and a brownie from Hilton in County Durham was known as \"Cauld Lad\". Brownies are said to be motivated by \"personal friendships and fancies\" and may sometimes be moved to perform extra work outside of their normal duties, such as, in one story of a brownie from Balquam, fetching a midwife when the lady of the house went into labour.\n\nIn 1703, John Brand wrote in his description of Shetland that:\nBrownies are virtually always male, but female brownies, such as Meg Mullach (or \"Hairy Meg\"), have occasionally been described as well. They are usually envisioned as ugly and their appearances are sometimes described as frightening or unsettling to members of the houses in which they reside. They received their name from the fact that they are usually described as brown-skinned and completely covered in hair. In the earliest traditions, brownies are either the same size as humans or sometimes larger, but, in later accounts, they are described as \"small, wizened, and shaggy\". They are often characterized as short and rotund, a description that may be related to mid-seventeenth-century Scottish descriptions of the Devil. Two Scottish witchcraft confessions, one by Thomas Shanks in 1649 and another by Margaret Comb in 1680, both describe meetings with a \"thick little man\". The man in these descriptions may have been conceived as a brownie.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, the Irish folklorist Thomas Keightley described the brownie as \"a personage of small stature, wrinkled visage, covered with short curly brown hair, and wearing a brown mantle and hood\". Brownies are usually described as either naked or clothed in rags. Brownies of the Scottish Lowlands were said not to have noses, but instead had merely a single hole in the centre of their face. In Aberdeenshire, brownies are sometimes described as having no fingers or toes. Sometimes brownies are stated to appear like children, either naked or dressed in white tunics.\n\nLike the Phooka in Irish folklore, brownies are sometimes described as taking the forms of animals. As a rule, they can turn invisible, but they are supposed to rarely need this ability because they are already experts at sneaking and hiding. A story from Peeblesshire tells of two maids who stole a bowl of milk and a bannock that had been left out for the brownie. They sat down together to eat them, but the brownie sat between them invisibly and whenever either of them tried to eat the bannock or drink the milk, the brownie would steal it from them. The two maids began arguing, each accusing the other of stealing her milk and bannock. Finally, the brownie laughed and cried out: \"Ha, ha, ha! Brownie has't a'!\"\n\nIf the brownie feels he has been slighted or taken advantage of, he will vanish forever, taking the prosperity of the house with him. Sometimes the brownie is said to fly into a rage and wreck all his work before leaving. In extreme cases, brownies are even sometimes said to turn into malicious boggarts if angered or treated improperly. A brownie is said to take offence if a human observes him working, if a human criticizes him, or if a human laughs at him. Brownies are supposedly especially angered by anything they regard as contempt or condescension. The brownie at Cranshaws in Berwickshire is said to have mown and thrashed the grain for years. Then someone commented that the grain had been poorly mown and stacked, so, that night, the brownie carried all the grain to Raven Crag two miles away and hurled it off the cliff, all the while muttering:\n<poem>\nIt's no' weel mow'd! It's no' weel mow'd!—\nThen it's ne'er be mow'd by me again;\nI'll scatter it owre the Raven Stane\nAnd they'll hae some wark ere it's mow'd again!\n</poem>\nA brownie can also be driven away if someone attempts to baptize him. In some stories, even the manner in which their bowls of cream are given is enough to drive the brownie away. The brownie of Bodsbeck, near the town of Moffat in Scotland, left for the nearby farm of Leithenhall after the owner of Bodsbeck called for him after pouring his cream, instead of letting him find the cream himself.\n\nSometimes giving the brownie a name was enough to drive him away. A brownie who haunted Almor Burn near Pitlochry in Perthshire was often heard splashing and paddling in the water. He was said to go up to the nearby farm every night with wet feet and, if anything was untidy, he would put it in order, but, if anything was tidy, he would hurl it around and make a mess. The people of the area feared him and did not go near the road leading up from the water at night. A man returning from the market one night heard him splashing in the water and called out to him, addressing him by the nickname \"Puddlefoot\". Puddlefoot exclaimed in horror, \"I've gotten a name! 'Tis Puddlefoot they call me!\" Then he vanished forever and was never heard again.\n\nIf the family the brownie works for gives him a gift of clothing, he will leave forever and refuse to work for the family. The first mention in English of a brownie disappearing after being presented with clothes comes from Book Four, Chapter Ten of Reginald Scot's \"The Discoverie of Witchcraft\", published in 1584. Sometimes brownies are reported to recite couplets before disappearing. One brownie from Scotland is said to have angrily declared:\n<poem>\nRed breeks and a ruffled sark!\nYe'll no get me to do your wark!\n</poem>\nAnother brownie from Berwickshire is said to have declared:\n<poem>\nGie Brownie a coat, gie Brownie a sark,\nYe'se get nae mair o' Brownie's wark.\n</poem>\nExplanations differ regarding why brownies disappear when presented with clothes, but the most common explanation is that the brownie regards the gift of clothing as an insult. One story from Lincolnshire, first recorded in 1891, attempts to rationalize the motif by making a brownie who is accustomed to being presented with linen shirts become enraged upon being presented with a shirt made of sackcloth. The brownie in the story sings before disappearing:\n<poem>\nHarden, harden, harden hamp,\nI will neither grind nor stamp;\nHad you given me linen gear,\nI have served you many a year.\nThrift may go, bad luck may stay,\nI shall travel far away.\n</poem>\nThe Cauld Lad of Hilton seems to have wanted clothes and to have been grateful for the gift of them, yet still refused to stay after receiving them. At night, people were supposed to have heard him working and somberly singing:\n<poem>\nWae's me! Wae's me!\nThe acorn is not yet\nFallen from the tree,\nThat's to grow to the wood,\nThat's to make the cradle,\nThat's to rock the bairn,\nThat's to grow a man,\nThat's to lay to me.\n</poem>\nAfter the servants presented him with a green mantle and hood, he is supposed to have joyfully sung before disappearing:\n<poem>\nHere's a cloak, and here's a hood!\nThe Cauld Lad of Hilton will do no more good!\n</poem>\nIt is possible that the Cauld Lad may have simply thought himself \"too grand for work\", a motif attested to in other folk tales, or that the gift of clothing may have been seen as a means of freeing him from a curse. A brownie from Jedburgh is also said to have desired clothing. The servants are reported to have heard him one night saying, \"Wae's me for a green sark!\" The laird ordered for a green shirt to be made for the brownie. It was left out for him and he disappeared forever. People assumed he had gone to Fairyland.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, the pothook used to hang pots over the fire was made with a crook in it, which was known in Herefordshire as the \"brownie's seat\" or \"brownie's sway\". If the hook did not have crook on it, people would hang a horseshoe on it upside-down so the brownie would have a place to sit. The brownie at the Portway Inn in Staunton on Wye reportedly had a habit of stealing the family keys and the only way to retrieve them was for the whole family sit around the hearth and to set a piece of cake on the hob as an offering to the brownie. Then they would all sit with their eyes closed, absolutely silent, and the missing keys would be hurled at them from behind.\n\nAlthough the name \"brownie\" originated in the early sixteenth century as a dialect word used only in the Scottish Lowlands and along the English border, it has become the standard name for a variety of similar creatures appearing in the folklores of various cultures across Britain. Stories about brownies are generally more common in England and the Lowlands of Scotland than in Celtic areas. Nonetheless, stories of Celtic brownies are recorded.\n\nThe Welsh name for a brownie is \"Bwbach\". Like brownies, Bwbachs are said to have violent tempers if angered. The twelfth-century Welsh historian Gerald of Wales records how a Bwbach inflicted havoc and mischief upon a certain household that had angered him. The nineteenth-century folklorist Wirt Sikes describes the Bwbach as a \"good-natured goblin\" who performs chores for Welsh maids. He states that, right before she goes to bed, the maid must sweep the kitchen and make a fire in the fireplace and set a churn filled with cream by the fire with a fresh bowl of cream next to it. The next morning, \"if she is in luck\", she will find the bowl of cream had been drunk and the cream in the churn has been dashed. Sikes goes on to explain that, in addition to being a household spirit, the Bwbach is also the name for a terrifying phantom believed to sweep people away on gusts of air. The Bwbach is said to do this on the behalf of spirits of the restless dead, who cannot sleep because of the presence of hidden treasure. When these spirits fail to succeed in persuading a living mortal to remove the treasure, they have the Bwbach whisk the person away instead. Briggs notes that this other aspect of the Bwbach's activities make it much more closely resemble the Irish Phooka.\n\nJohn Rhys, a Welsh scholar of Celtic culture and folklore, records a story from Monmouthshire in his 1901 book \"Celtic Folklore\" about a young maid suspected of having fairy blood, who left a bowl of cream at the bottom of the stairs every night for a Bwbach. One night, as a prank, she filled the bowl with stale urine. The Bwbach attacked her, but she screamed and the Bwbach was forced to flee to the neighboring farm of Hafod y Ynys. A girl there fed him well and he did her spinning for her, but she wanted to know his name, which he refused to tell. Then, one day when she pretended to be out, she heard him singing his name, Gwarwyn-a-throt, so he left and went to another farm, where he became close friends with the manservant, whose name was Moses. After Moses was killed in the Battle of Bosworth Field, Gwarwyn-a-throt began behaving like a boggart, wreaking havoc across the whole town. An old wise man, however, managed to summon him and banish him to the Red Sea. Elements of this story recur throughout other brownie stories.\n\nThe Manx name for a brownie is \"Fenodyree\". The Fenodyree is envisioned as a \"hairy spirit of great strength\", who is capable of threshing an entire barn full of corn in a single night. The Fenodyree is regarded as generally unintelligent. One Manx folktale tells of how the Fenodyree once tried to round up a flock of sheep and had more trouble with a small, hornless, grey one than any of the others; the \"sheep\" he had so much difficulty with turned out to be a hare. The exact same mistake is also attributed to a brownie from Lancashire and the story is also told in western North America. Like other brownies, the Fenodyree is believed to leave forever if he is presented with clothing. In one story, a farmer of Ballochrink gave the Fenodyree a gift of clothes in gratitude for all his work. The Fenodyree was offended and lifted up each item of clothing, reciting the various illnesses each one would bring him. The Fenodyree then left to hide away in Glen Rushen alone.\n\nEspecially in Yorkshire and Lancashire, brownies are known as \"Hobs\" due to their association with the hearth. Like brownies, Hobs would leave forever if presented with clothing. A Hob in Runswick Bay in North Yorkshire was said to live in a natural cave known as the \"Hob-Hole\", where parents would bring their children for the Hob to cure them of whooping cough. The Holman Clavel Inn in Somerset is also said to be inhabited by a mischievous Hob named Charlie. The story was recorded by the folklorist R. L. Tongue in 1964 immediately after he heard it from a woman who lived next door to the inn. Everyone in the locality knew about Charlie and he was believed to sit on the beam of holly wood over the fire, which was known as the \"clavvy\" or \"clavey\". Once, when the woman was having dinner with a local farmer, the servants set the table at the inn with \"silver and linen\", but, as soon as they left the room and came back, Charlie had put all the table settings back where they had come from because he did not like the farmer she was meeting with.\n\nHobs are sometimes also known as \"Lobs\". Lob-Lie-by-the-Fire is the name of a large brownie who was said to perform farm labour. In Scotland, a similar hearth spirit was known as the Wag-at-the-Wa. The Wag-at-the-Wa was believed to sit on the pothook and it was believed that swinging the pothook served as an invitation for him to come visit. He was believed to pester idle servants, but he was said to enjoy the company of children. He is described as a hideous, short-legged old man with a long tail who always dressed in a red coat and blue breeches with an old nightcap atop his head and a bandage around his face, since he was constantly plagued by toothache. He also sometimes wore a grey cloak. He was often reported to laugh alongside the rest of the family if they were laughing, but he was strongly opposed to the family drinking any beverages with more alcohol content than home-brewed ale. He is said to have fled before the sign of the cross.\n\nA female spirit known as the Silkie, who received her name from the fact that she was always dressed in grey silk, appears in English and Scottish folklore. Like a ghost, the Silkie is associated with the house rather than the family who lives there, but, like a brownie, she is said to perform chores for the family. A famous Silkie was reported to haunt Denton Hall in Northumberland. Briggs gives the report of a woman named Marjory Sowerby, who, as a little girl, had spoken with the last remaining Hoyles of Denten Hall, two old ladies, about the Silkie and its kindness to them. They told her that the Silkie would clean the hearth and kindle fires for them. They also mentioned \"something about bunches of flowers left on the staircase\". Sowerby left the area in around 1902 and, when she returned over half a century later after World War II, the Hoyles were both long dead and the house was owned by a man who did not believe in fairies. The stories about the Silkie were no longer told and instead the house was reputed to be haunted by a vicious poltergeist, who made banging noise and other strange noises and pulled pranks on the man. The man eventually moved out. Briggs calls this an example of a brownie turning into a boggart.\n\nSilkies were also sometimes believed to appear suddenly on roads at night to lonely travellers and frighten them. Another Silkie is said to haunt the grounds of Fardel Hall in Devonshire. This one is said to manifest in the form of a \"beautiful young woman with long, golden hair, wearing a long silken gown\" and supposedly guards a hoard of treasure buried on the grounds. Few people have seen the spirit, but many claim to have heard the rustling of her silk dress. She is believed to quietly strangle anyone who comes near finding the treasure.\n\nThe folklorist John Gregorson Campbell distinguishes between the English brownie, which lived in houses, and the Scottish \"ùruisg\" or \"urisk\", which lived outside in streams and waterfalls and was less likely to offer domestic help. Although brownies and ùruisgs are very similar in character, they have different origins. Ùruisgs are sometimes described as half-man and half-goat. They are said to have \"long hair, long teeth, and long claws\". According to M. L. West, they may be Celtic survivals of goat-like nature spirits from Proto-Indo-European mythology, analogous to the Roman fauns and Greek satyrs. Passersby often reported seeing an ùruisg sitting atop a rock at dusk, watching them go by. During the summer, the ùruisg was supposed to remain in the solitude of the wilderness, but, during the winter, he would come down and visit the local farms at night or take up residence in a local mill.\n\nWild ùruisgs were troublemakers and vandals who perpetrated acts of butchery, arson, and ravaging, but, once domesticated, they were fiercely loyal. Wealthy and prominent families were said to have ùruisgs as household servants. One chieftain of the MacFarlane clan was said to have been nursed and raised by the wife of an ùruisg. The Graham clan of Angus told stories of an ùruisg that had once worked for one of their ancestors as a drudge. The Maclachlan clan in Strathlachlan had an ùruisg servant named \"Harry\", possibly shortened from \"the hairy one\". The MacNeils of Taynish and the Frazers of Abertarff also claimed to have ùruisg servants. Ùruisgs were also known as \"ciuthachs\" or \"kewachs\". A story on the island of Eigg told of a ciuthach that lived in a cave. In some parts of Scotland, similar domestic spirits were called Shellycoats, a name whose origin is uncertain.\n\nA figure named \"Billy Blind\" or \"Billy Blin\", who bears close resemblances to both the brownie and the Irish banshee, appears in ballads of the Anglo-Scottish border. Unlike brownies, who usually provide practical domestic aid, Billy Blind usually only provides advice. He appears in the ballad of \"Young Bekie\", in which he warns Burd Isbel, the woman Bekie is pledged to marry, that Bekie is about to marry another woman. He also appears in the ballad of \"Willie's Lady\" in which he also provides advice, but offers no practical aid.\n\nBriggs notes stories of other household spirits from British folklore who are reputed to haunt specific locations. The \"cellar ghost\" is a spirit who guards wine in cellars from would-be thieves; Lazy Lawrence is said to be protect orchards; Awd Goggie scares children away from eating unripe gooseberries; and Melch Dick guards nut thickets. The Kilmoulis is a brownie-like creature from the Scottish Lowlands that is often said to inhabit mills. He is said to have no mouth, but an enormous nose that covers most of his face. He is fond of pranks and only the miller himself is able to control him.\n\nBrownies have traditionally been regarded as distinct and different from fairies. In 1777, a vicar of Beetham wrote in his notes on local folklore, \"A Browny is not a fairey, but a tawny color'd Being which will do a great deal of work for a Family, if used well.\" The writer Walter Scott agreed in his \"Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border\", in which he states, \"The Brownie formed a class of beings distinct in habit and disposition from the freakish and mischievous elves.\" Modern scholars, however, categorize brownies as household spirits, which is usually treated as a subcategorization of fairy. Brownies and other household spirits differ significantly from other fairies in folklore, however. Brownies are usually said to dwell alongside humans in houses, barns, and on farms; whereas other fairies are usually said to reside in places of remote wilderness. Brownies are usually regarded as harmless, unless they are angered; other types of folkloric fairies, however, are typically seen as dark and dangerous. Finally, brownies are unusual for their solitary nature, since most other types of fairies are often thought to live in large groups.\n\nBriggs notes that brownies are frequently associated with the dead and states that, like the banshee in Irish folklore, \"a good case\" could be made for brownies to be classified as ghosts. Nonetheless, she rejects this idea, commenting that the Brownie has \"an adaptability, individuality and a homely tang which forbids one to think of him as merely a lingering and reminiscent image.\"\n\nIn seventeenth-century Scotland, brownies were sometimes regarded as a kind of demon. King James VI and I describes the brownie as a demon in his 1597 treatise \"Daemonologie\":\nThe folklorist L. F. Newman states that the image of the brownie fits well into a Functionalist analysis of the \"old, generous rural economy\" of pre-Industrial Britain, describing him as the epitome of what a good household servant of the era was supposed to be. Belief in brownies could be exploited by both masters and servants. The servants could blame the brownie for messes, breakages, and strange noises heard at night. Meanwhile, the masters of the house who employed them could use stories of the brownie to convince their servants to behave by telling them that the brownie would punish servants who were idle and reward those who performed their duties vigilantly. According to Susan Stewart, brownies also resolved the problem that human storytellers faced of the unending repetition and futility of labour. As immortal spirits, brownies could not be worn out nor revitalized by working, so their work became seen as simply part of \"a perpetual cycle that is akin to the activities of Nature herself.\"\n\nAn entity referred to as a \"drudging goblin\" or the \"Lubbar Fend\" is described in lines 105 to 114 of John Milton's 1645 pastoral poem \"L'Allegro\". The \"goblin\" churns butter, brews drinks, makes dough rise, sweeps the floor, washes the dishes, and lays by the fire. According to Briggs, like most other early brownies, Milton's Lubbar Fend was probably envisioned as human-sized or larger. In many early literary appearances, the brownie turns out to be an ordinary person. The Scottish novelist James Hogg incorporated brownie folklore into his novel \"The Brownie of Bodsbeck\" (1818). The novel is set in 1685, when the Covenanters, a Scottish Presbyterian movement, were being persecuted. Food goes missing from the farm of Walter of Chaplehope, leading villagers to suspect it is the \"brownie of Bodsbeck\". In the end, it turns out that the \"brownie\" was actually John Brown, the leader of the Covenanters.\n\nHogg later wrote about brownies in his short story \"The Brownie of Black Haggs\" (1828). In this story, the evil Lady Wheelhope orders that any of her male servants who openly practices any form of religion must be given over to the military and shot. Female servants who practiced religion are discretely poisoned. A single mysterious servant named Merodach stands up to her. Merodach is described as having \"the form of a boy, but the features of one a hundred years old\" and his eyes \"bear a strong resemblance to the eyes of a well-known species of monkey.\" Characters in the novel believe Merodach to be a brownie, although others claim that he is a \"mongrel, between a Jew and an ape... a wizard... a kelpie, or a fairy\". Like folkloric brownies, Merodach's religion is overtly pagan and he detests the sight of the Bible. He also refuses to accept any form of payment. Lady Wheelhope hates him and attempts to kill him, but all her efforts mysteriously backfire, instead resulting in the deaths of those she loves. The novel never reveals whether Merodach is actually of supernatural origin or if he is merely a peculiar-looking servant. Charlotte and Emily Brontë were both familiar with Hogg's stories and his portrayal of Merodach may have greatly influenced Emily's portrayal of her character Heathcliff in \"Wuthering Heights\" (1847). Brownies are also briefly referenced in Charlotte's novel \"Villette\" (1853).\n\nThe late nineteenth century saw the growth and profusion of children's literature, which often incorporated fantasy. Brownies in particular were often thought of as especially appealing to children. Juliana Horatia Ewing incorporated brownie folklore remembered from her childhood into her short story \"The Brownies\", first published in 1865 in \"The Monthly Packet\" and later incorporated into her 1871 collection of short stories \"The Brownies and Other Tales\". In the story, a selfish boy seeks a brownie to do his chores for him because he is too lazy to do them himself. A wise old owl tells him that brownies do not really exist and the only real brownies are good little children who do chores without being asked. The boy goes home and convinces his younger brother in join him in becoming the new household \"brownies\". Ewing's short story inspired the idea of calling helpful children \"brownies\".\n\nThe Canadian American children's writer Palmer Cox helped promote brownies in North America through his illustrated poems about them published in \"St. Nicholas Magazine\". Cox portrayed brownies as \"tiny elf-like figures who often took on tasks en masse\". These poems and illustrations were later collected and published in his book \"The Brownies: Their Book\" in 1887, which became the first of several such collections. In the 1890s, so-called \"brownie-mania\" swept across the United States. Cox effectively licensed out his brownie characters rather than selling them, something which he was among the first to do. He and his many business collaborators were able to market brownie-themed tie-in merchandise, including boots, cigars, stoves, dolls, and silverware.\n\nThe popularity of Cox's poems, illustrations, and tie-in products cemented brownies as an element of North American children's literature and culture. Meanwhile, Cox could not copyright the name \"brownie\" because it was a creature from folklore, so unauthorized \"brownie\" products began to flood the market as well. The widespread \"brownie\" merchandise inspired George Eastman to name his low-cost camera \"Brownie\". In 1919, Juliette Gordon Low adopted \"Brownies\" as the name for the lowest age group in her organization of \"Girl Guides\" on account of Ewing's short story.\n\nA brownie character named \"Big Ears\" appears in Enid Blyton's Noddy series of children's books, in which he is portrayed as living in a mushroom house just outside the village of Toytown. In Blyton's \"Book of Brownies\" (1926), a mischievous trio of brownies named Hop, Skip, and Jump attempt to sneak into a party hosted by the King of Fairyland by pretending to be Twirly-Whirly, the Great Conjuror from the Land of Tiddlywinks, and his two assistants.\n\nGeorge MacDonald incorporated features of Scottish brownie lore in his nineteenth-century works \"The Princess and the Goblin\" and \"Sir Gibbie\"—his brownies have no fingers on their hands. Warrior brownies appear in the 1988 fantasy film \"Willow\", directed by Ron Howard. These brownies are portrayed as only a couple inches tall and are armed with bows and arrows. Though they are initially introduced as the kidnappers of a human infant, they turn out to be benevolent. Creatures known as \"house elves\" appear in the \"Harry Potter\" series of books by J. K. Rowling, published between 1997 and 2007. Like the traditional brownies of folklore, house elves are loyal to their masters and may be released by a gift of clothing. House elves also resemble brownies in appearance, being small, but they have larger heads and large, bat-like ears. Rowling's books also include boggarts, which are sometimes traditionally described as brownies turned malevolent.\n\nA brownie named Thimbletack plays an important role in the children's fantasy book series \"The Spiderwick Chronicles\", written by Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi and published in five volumes from May 2003 to September 2004 by Simon & Schuster. He lives inside the walls of the Spiderwick estate and is only visible when he wishes to be seen. He is described as \"a little man about the size of a pencil\" with eyes \"black and beetles\" and a nose that is \"large and red\". When angered, Thimbletack transforms into a malicious boggart. The series became an international bestseller and was translated into thirty languages. A film adaptation of the same name was released in 2008.\n\n"}
{"id": "3382322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3382322", "title": "Chaitanya Bhagavata", "text": "Chaitanya Bhagavata\n\nThe Chaitanya Bhagavata () is a hagiography of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (b.1486), the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna incarnation in Kaliyuga, written by Vrindavana Dasa Thakura (1507-1589 CE). It was the first full-length work regarding Chaitanya Mahaprabhu written in Bengali language and documents his early life and role as the founder of the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition. The text details Chaitanya's theological position as a combined Avatar of both Radha and Krishna within the belief of his close associates and followers. The writing of Chaitanya Bhagavata was commissioned by Nityananda, who was the guru of Vrindavana Dasa Thakura and close friend of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.\n\nInitially, the Chaitanya Bhagavata was named \"Chaitanya Mangala\". Krishnadasa Kaviraja also mentioned this work by this name. According to the \"Premavilasa\" of Narottama Dasa, when it was discovered that the poet Lochana Dasa had also written a work with this title, the leading members of the Vaishnava community in Vrindavan met and decided that Vrindavana Dasa's book would be known as the Chaitanya Bhagavata with Lochana Dasa's book remaining as the Chaitanya Mangala.\n\nThe Chaitanya Bhagavata is divided into three parts: the \"Adi-khanda\", \"Madhya-khanda\" and \"Antya-khanda\":\nThe Adi-khanda consists of fifteen \"adhyaya\"s (chapters). It deals with the socio-religious situation of Bengal before the advent of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, his birth, education, and marriage to Lakshmi-priya; his defeating opposing scholars, his visit to East Bengal, the passing of Lakshmi-priya, his marriage to Vishnupriya and his trip to Gaya and subsequent initiation from Ishvara Puri.\n\nThe Madhya-khanda consists of twenty-seven \"adhyaya\"s (chapters). It narrates Chaitanya's growing external displays of devotion, the disciples which join his devotional creed, the conversion of the debauchees Jagai and Madhai, and Chaitanya's civil disobedience movement against the Muslim Chand Kazi who tries to stop the congregational chanting of the names of Krishna.\n\nThe Antya-khanda consists of ten \"adhyaya\"s (chapters). It portrays Chaitanya's acceptance of sannyasa (the renounced order), his mother Saci-Mata's lamentation, his travels to Puri, his meeting with the logician Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya and his relationships and interactions with different devotees.\n\nIn two of the manuscripts of the \"Chaitanya Bhagavat\", three additional chapters are found at the end of the \"Antya-khanda\", which are not accepted as the part of the original text by most of the modern scholars.\n\nThe Chaitanya Bhagavata (similarly to the Chaitanya Charitamrita) asserts that Chaitanya was not simply a saint or even a \"regular\" Avatar, but was instead the direct incarnation of Krishna as Bhagavan, or the Supreme God himself. The text gives Chaitanya's mission as one for the benefit of mankind, through beginning the \"yuga-dharma\" (harinam-sankirtana) for the present age of Kali Yuga. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is quoted within as saying \"My holy name will be sung (preached) in every town and village of earth\". The author, Vrindavana Dasa, has been considered by Gaudiya Vaishnavas to be the Vyasa of Chaitanya's pastimes because of revealing his true nature and mission.\n\nThe Bhagavata has been praised for its simplicity in that is does not cross into the ontological nuances that are found in Krishna Dasa Kaviraja's Chaitanya Charitamrita. The Charitamrita of Krishna Dasa gives a more sophisticated and theological view of the life of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and provides more information on his years in Puri as an ascetic. Together, the texts of the Chaitanya Bhagavata and the Chaitanya Charitamrta provide a complete picture of the life and teachings of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu although there are many more of his biographies and other writings about him.\n\nScholars are of the opinion that Vrindavana Dasa wrote the Chaitanya Bhagavata somewhere in the mid-1540s.\n\n"}

{"id": "9978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9978", "title": "Essenes", "text": "Essenes\n\nThe Essenes (; Modern Hebrew: , \"Isiyim\"; Greek: Ἐσσηνοί, Ἐσσαῖοι, or Ὀσσαῖοι, \"Essenoi, Essaioi, Ossaioi\") were a sect of Second Temple Judaism which flourished from the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century CE.\n\nThe Jewish historian Josephus records that Essenes existed in large numbers, and thousands lived throughout Roman Judaea, but they were fewer in number than the Pharisees and the Sadducees, the other two major sects at the time. The Essenes lived in various cities but congregated in communal life dedicated to voluntary poverty, daily immersion, and asceticism (their priestly class practiced celibacy). Most scholars claim they seceded from the Zadokite priests.\n\nThe Essenes have gained fame in modern times as a result of the discovery of an extensive group of religious documents known as the Dead Sea Scrolls, which are commonly believed to be the Essenes' library. These documents preserve multiple copies of parts of the Hebrew Bible untouched from possibly as early as 300 BCE until their discovery in 1946. Most scholars dispute the notion that the Essenes wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls. Rachel Elior questions even the existence of the Essenes.\n\nThe first reference to the sect is by the Roman writer Pliny the Elder (died ) in his \"Natural History\". Pliny relates in a few lines that the Essenes possess no money, had existed for thousands of generations, and that their priestly class (“contemplatives”) do not marry. Unlike Philo, who did not mention any particular geographical location of the Essenes other than the whole land of Israel, Pliny places them somewhere above Ein Gedi, next to the Dead Sea.\n\nJosephus later gave a detailed account of the Essenes in \"The Jewish War\" (), with a shorter description in \"Antiquities of the Jews\" () and \"The Life of Flavius Josephus\" (). Claiming firsthand knowledge, he lists the \"Essenoi\" as one of the three sects of Jewish philosophy alongside the Pharisees and the Sadducees. He relates the same information concerning piety, celibacy, the absence of personal property and of money, the belief in communality, and commitment to a strict observance of Sabbath. He further adds that the Essenes ritually immersed in water every morning, ate together after prayer, devoted themselves to charity and benevolence, forbade the expression of anger, studied the books of the elders, preserved secrets, and were very mindful of the names of the angels kept in their sacred writings.\n\nPliny, also a geographer, located them in the desert near the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea, where the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered.\n\nJosephus uses the name \"Essenes\" in his two main accounts but some manuscripts read here \"Essaion\" (“holding the Essenes in honour”; “a certain Essene named Manaemus”; “to hold all Essenes in honor”; “the Essenes”).\n\nIn several places, however, Josephus has \"Essaios\", which is usually assumed to mean \"Essene\" (“Judas of the \"Essaios\" race”; “Simon of the \"Essaios\" race”; “John the \"Essaios\"”; “those who are called by us \"Essaioi\"”; “Simon a man of the \"Essaios\" race”). Josephus identified the Essenes as one of the three major Jewish sects of that period.\n\nPhilo's usage is \"Essaioi\", although he admits this Greek form of the original name, that according to his etymology signifies “holiness”, to be inexact. Pliny's Latin text has \"Esseni\".\n\nGabriele Boccaccini implies that a convincing etymology for the name Essene has not been found, but that the term applies to a larger group within Palestine that also included the Qumran community.\n\nIt was proposed before the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered that the name came into several Greek spellings from a Hebrew self-designation later found in some Dead Sea Scrolls, \"'osey hatorah\", “observers of torah”. Although dozens of etymology suggestions have been published, this is the only etymology published before 1947 that was confirmed by Qumran text self-designation references, and it is gaining acceptance among scholars. It is recognized as the etymology of the form \"Ossaioi\" (and note that Philo also offered an O spelling) and \"Essaioi\" and \"Esseni\" spelling variations have been discussed by VanderKam, Goranson, and others. In medieval Hebrew (e.g. Sefer Yosippon) \"Hassidim\" (“the pious ones”) replaces “Essenes”. While this Hebrew name is not the etymology of \"Essaioi\"/\"Esseni\", the Aramaic equivalent \"Hesi'im\" known from Eastern Aramaic texts has been suggested. Others suggest that Essene is a transliteration of the Hebrew word \"chitzonim\" (chitzon=outside), which the Mishna (e.g. Megila 4:8) uses to describe various sectarian groups. Another theory is that the name was borrowed from a cult of devotees to Artemis in Asia Minor, whose demeanor and dress somewhat resembled those of the group in Judaea.\n\nFlavius Josephus in Chapter 8 of “The Jewish War” states:\n\nAccording to Josephus, the Essenes had settled “not in one city” but “in large numbers in every town”. Philo speaks of \"more than four thousand\" \"Essaioi\" living in “Palestine and Syria”, more precisely, “in many cities of Judaea and in many villages and grouped in great societies of many members”.\n\nPliny locates them “on the west side of the Dead Sea, away from the coast... [above] the town of Engeda”.\n\nSome modern scholars and archaeologists have argued that Essenes inhabited the settlement at Qumran, a plateau in the Judean Desert along the Dead Sea, citing Pliny the Elder in support, and giving credence that the Dead Sea Scrolls are the product of the Essenes. This theory, though not yet conclusively proven, has come to dominate the scholarly discussion and public perception of the Essenes. Part of the Dead Sea Scrolls that have been discovered is a small fragment known as the “Son of God text” or 4Q246.\n\nThe accounts by Josephus and Philo show that the Essenes led a strictly communal life—often compared to later Christian monasticism. Many of the Essene groups appear to have been celibate, but Josephus speaks also of another “\"order\" of Essenes” that observed the practice of being engaged for three years and then becoming married. According to Josephus, they had customs and observances such as collective ownership, electing a leader to attend to the interests of the group, and obedience to the orders from their leader. Also, they were forbidden from swearing oaths and from sacrificing animals. They controlled their tempers and served as channels of peace, carrying weapons only for protection against robbers. The Essenes chose not to possess slaves but served each other and, as a result of communal ownership, did not engage in trading. Josephus and Philo provide lengthy accounts of their communal meetings, meals and religious celebrations.\n\nAfter a three-year probationary period, newly joining members would take an oath that included the commitment to practice piety towards God (το θειον) and righteousness towards humanity, to maintain a pure lifestyle, to abstain from criminal and immoral activities, to transmit their rules uncorrupted and to preserve the books of the Essenes and the names of the angels. Their theology included belief in the immortality of the soul and that they would receive their souls back after death. Part of their activities included purification by water rituals, which was supported by rainwater catchment and storage. According to the Community Rules, repentance was a prerequisite to baptism: “They shall not enter the water... for they will not be cleansed unless they have turned from their evil.” \n\nRitual purification was a common practice among the peoples of Judea during this period and was thus not specific to the Essenes. (Ritual baths are found near many Synagogues of the period.) Purity and cleanliness was considered so important to the Essenes that they would refrain from defecation on the Sabbath.\n\nAccording to Joseph Lightfoot the Church Father Epiphanius (writing in the 4th century CE) seems to make a distinction between two main groups within the Essenes: “Of those that came before his [Elxai, an Ossaean prophet] time and during it, the Ossaeans and the Nazarean.” Epiphanius describes each group as following:\n\nIf it is correct to identify the community at Qumran with the Essenes (and claim that the community at Qumran are the authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls), then according to the Dead Sea Scrolls the Essenes' community school was called “Yahad” (meaning “community”) in order to differentiate themselves from the rest of the Jews who are repeatedly labeled “The Breakers of the Covenant”.\n\nJosephus and Philo discuss the Essenes in detail. Most scholars believe that the community at Qumran that allegedly produced the Dead Sea Scrolls was an offshoot of the Essenes. However, this theory has been disputed by some; for example, Norman Golb argues that the primary research on the Qumran documents and ruins (by Father Roland de Vaux, from the \"École Biblique et Archéologique de Jérusalem\") lacked scientific method, and drew wrong conclusions that comfortably entered the academic canon. For Golb, the number of documents is too extensive and includes many different writing styles and calligraphies; the ruins seem to have been a fortress, used as a military base for a very long period of time—including the 1st century—so they therefore could not have been inhabited by the Essenes; and the large graveyard excavated in 1870, just east of the Qumran ruins, was made of over 1200 tombs that included many women and children; Pliny clearly wrote that the Essenes who lived near the Dead Sea \"had not one woman, had renounced all pleasure... and no one was born in their race\". Golb's book presents observations about de Vaux's premature conclusions and their uncontroverted acceptance by the general academic community. He states that the documents probably stemmed from various libraries in Jerusalem, kept safe in the desert from the Roman invasions. Other scholars refute these arguments—particularly since Josephus describes some Essenes as allowing marriage.\n\nAnother issue is the relationship between the \"Essaioi\" and Philo's \"Therapeutae\" and \"Therapeutrides\". He regarded the \"Therapeutae\" as a contemplative branch of the \"Essaioi\" who, he said, pursued an active life.\n\nOne theory on the formation of the Essenes suggests that the movement was founded by a Jewish high priest, dubbed by the Essenes the Teacher of Righteousness, whose office had been usurped by Jonathan (of priestly but not of Zadokite lineage), labeled the “man of lies” or “false priest”. Others follow this line and a few argue that the Teacher of Righteousness was not only the leader of the Essenes at Qumran, but was also identical to the original Messianic figure about 150 years before the time of the Gospels. Fred Gladstone Bratton notes that\n\nThe Saint Thomas Christians (“Nasrani”) of southwestern India may have connections with the Essenes, according to the Manimekalai, one of the great Tamil epic poems, which refers to a people called “Issani”.\n\n\n"}

The term \"extraordinary\" distinguishes such a person from the ordinary (ordained) minister of Holy Communion, namely a bishop, priest or deacon.\n\nCanon law permits that \"[w]here the needs of the Church require and ministers are not available, lay people, even though they are not lectors or acolytes, can supply certain of their functions, that is, exercise the ministry of the word, preside over liturgical prayers, confer baptism and distribute Holy Communion, in accordance with the provisions of the law.\" The term \"lay people\" does not distinguish between men and women.\n\nThe extraordinary minister's function is to distribute Holy Communion, either within Mass or by taking it to a sick person, when an ordained minister (bishop, priest or deacon) is absent or impeded.\n\nIn order to avoid confusion about this function, an extraordinary minister of Holy Communion is not to be called a \"special minister of Holy Communion\", nor an \"extraordinary Minister of the Eucharist\", nor a \"special minister of the Eucharist\".\n\nTen years before publication of the present Code of Canon Law, some of these expressions were used in the instruction of the Sacred Congregation of the Sacraments \"Immensae caritatis\" of 29 January 1973. They are now reprobated.\n\nThe only minister of the Eucharist is the priest.\n\nAn instituted acolyte is an extraordinary minister of Holy Communion by virtue of his institution. Such acolytes are in practice seminarians or former seminarians, or those in deacon formation, although canon law allows the ministry to be conferred on any lay men (\"viri laici\") who have the age and qualifications that the episcopal conference is to lay down. The local bishop, pastor, or priest celebrant may delegate other lay Catholics for the function of extraordinary minister of Holy Communion either for a single occasion or for a specified period of time, if there are reasons of real necessity. The commissioning need not take a liturgical form, but an appropriate blessing, which should in no way resemble ordination, may be imparted. In special cases of an unforeseen nature, the priest celebrating Mass may grant permission for a single occasion.\n\n\"If there is usually present a sufficient number of sacred ministers for the distribution of Holy Communion, extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion may not be appointed. Indeed, in such circumstances, those who may have already been appointed to this ministry should not exercise it. The practice of those priests is reprobated who, even though present at the celebration, abstain from distributing Communion and hand this function over to laypersons.\"\n\nThe extraordinary minister of Holy Communion may administer Communion only when the priest and deacon are lacking, when the priest is prevented by weakness or advanced age or some other genuine reason, or when the number of faithful coming to Communion is so great that the very celebration of Mass would be unduly prolonged. ... A brief prolongation, considering the circumstances and culture of the place, is not at all a sufficient reason.\"\n\nFor a time, extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion in the United States were allowed to purify the Communion vessels (such as ciboria and chalices), an action that the present General Instruction of the Roman Missal expressly reserves for priest, deacon and instituted acolyte. The special indult authorizing that practice for three years, beginning in 2002, was not renewed.\n\n"}
{"id": "40189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40189", "title": "Founding of Rome", "text": "Founding of Rome\n\nThere is archaeological evidence of human occupation of the Rome area from about 14,000 years ago. In addition, traditional stories handed down by the ancient Romans themselves explain the earliest history of their city in terms of legend and myth.\n\nThe most familiar of these myths, and perhaps the most famous of all Roman myths, is the story of Romulus and Remus, the twins who were suckled by a she-wolf. This story had to be reconciled with a dual tradition, set earlier in time, the one that had the Trojan refugee Aeneas escape to Italy and found the line of Romans through his son Iulus, the namesake of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.\n\nThe national epic of mythical Rome, the \"Aeneid\" of Virgil, tells the story of how Trojan prince Aeneas came to Italy. The \"Aeneid\" was written under Augustus, who claimed ancestry through Julius Caesar from the hero and his mother Venus. According to the \"Aeneid\", the survivors from the fallen city of Troy banded together under Aeneas and underwent a series of adventures around the Mediterranean Sea, including a stop at newly founded Carthage under the rule of Queen Dido, eventually reaching the Italian coast. The Trojans were thought to have landed in an area between modern Anzio and Fiumicino, southwest of Rome, probably at Laurentum or, in other versions, at Lavinium, a place named for Lavinia, the daughter of King Latinus whom Aeneas married. This started a series of armed conflicts with Turnus over the marriage of Lavinia. Before the arrival of Aeneas, Turnus was betrothed to Lavinia, who then married Aeneas, starting the war. Aeneas won the war and killed Turnus. The Trojans won the right to stay and to assimilate with the local peoples. The young son of Aeneas Ascanius, also known as Iulus, went on to found Alba Longa and the line of Alban kings who filled the chronological gap between the Trojan saga and the traditional founding of Rome in the 8th century BC.\n\nToward the end of this line, King Procas was the father of Numitor and Amulius. At Procas' death, Numitor became king of Alba Longa, but Amulius captured him and sent him to prison; he also forced Numitor's daughter Rhea Silvia to become a virgin priestess among the Vestals.\n\nThe myth of Aeneas was of Greek origin and had to be reconciled with the Italian myth of Romulus and Remus, who would have been born around 771 BC if taken as historical figures. They were purported to be sons of Rhea Silvia and either Mars, the god of war, or the demi-god hero Hercules. They were abandoned at birth, in the manner of many mythological heroes, because of a prophecy that they would overthrow their great-uncle Amulius, who had overthrown Silvia's father Numitor. The twins were abandoned on the river Tiber by servants who took pity on the infants, despite their orders. The twins were nurtured by a she-wolf until a shepherd named Faustulus found the boys and took them as his sons. Faustulus and his wife Acca Larentia raised the children. When Remus and Romulus became adults, they killed Amulius and restored Numitor. They decided to establish a city; however, they quarreled, and Romulus killed his brother. Thus, Rome began with a fratricide, a story that was later taken to represent the city's history of internecine political strife and bloodshed.\n\nAnother story told how Romos, a son of Odysseus and Circe, was the one who founded Rome. Martin P. Nilsson speculates that this older story was becoming a bit embarrassing as Rome became more powerful and tensions with the Greeks grew. Being descendants of the Greeks was no longer preferable, so the Romans settled on the Trojan foundation myth instead. Nilsson further speculates that the name of Romos was changed by the Romans to the native name Romulus, but the name Romos (later changed to the native Remus) was never forgotten by the people, and so these two names came to stand side by side as founders of the city.\n\nThe ancient Romans were certain of the day Rome was founded: April 21, the day of the festival sacred to Pales, goddess of shepherds, on which date they celebrated the \"Par ilia\" (or \"Palilia\"). However they did not know, or they were uncertain of, the exact year the city had been founded; this is one reason they preferred to date their years by the presiding consuls rather than using the formula A.U.C. or Ab Urbe Condita. Several dates had been proposed by ancient authorities, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus records these: The Greek historian Timaeus, one of the first to write a history to include the Romans, stated that Rome was founded in the 38th year prior to the first Olympiad, or 814/3 BC; Quintus Fabius Pictor, the first Roman to write the history of his people, in Greek, stated Rome was founded in the first year of the eighth Olympiad, or 748/7 BC; Lucius Cincius Alimentus claimed Rome was founded in the fourth year of the twelfth Olympiad, or 729/8 BC; and Cato the Elder calculated that Rome was founded 432 years after the Trojan War, which Dionysius states was equivalent to the first year of the seventh Olympiad, or 752/1 BC. Dionysius himself provided calculations showing that Rome was founded in 751 BC, starting with the Battle of the Allia, which he dated to the first year of the ninety-eighth Olympiad, 388/7 BC, then added 120 years to reach the date of the first consuls, Junius Brutus and Tarquinius Collatinus, 508/7 BC, then added the combined total of the reigns of the Kings of Rome (244 years) to arrive at his own date, 751 BC. Even the official Fasti Capitolini offers its own date, 752 BC.\n\nThe most familiar date given for the foundation of Rome, 753 BC, was derived by the Roman antiquarian Titus Pomponius Atticus, and adopted by Marcus Terentius Varro, having become part of what has come to be known as the Varronian chronology. An anecdote in Plutarch where the astrologer Lucius Tarrutius of Firmum provides an argument based on a non-existent eclipse and other erroneous astronomical details that Rome was founded in 753 BC suggests that this had become the most commonly accepted date. Through its use by the third-century writer Censorinus, whose \"De Die Natali\" was the ultimate influence of Joseph Justus Scaliger's work to establish a scientific basis of ancient chronology, it became familiar.\n\nRecent discoveries by Andrea Carandini on Rome's Palatine Hill have also yielded evidence of a series of fortification walls on the north slope that can be dated to the middle of the 8th century BC. According to the legend, Romulus plowed a furrow (\"sulcus\") around the hill in order to mark the boundary of his new city.\n\nThere is no consensus on the etymology of the city's name. Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778) suggested Greek \" (\"), meaning \"strength, vigor\". A modern theory of etymology holds that the name of the city is of Etruscan origin (and perhaps the city itself, though this cannot be proven), derived from \"rumon\", \"river\".\n\nThere is archaeological evidence of human occupation of the Rome area from about 14,000 years ago, but the dense layer of much younger debris obscures Palaeolithic and Neolithic sites. Several excavations support the view that Rome grew from pastoral settlements on the Palatine Hill built above the area of the future Roman Forum. Between the end of the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron age, each hill between the sea and the Capitol was topped by a village (on the Capitol Hill, a village is attested since the end of the 14th century BC).\n\nIn any case, the location that became the city of Rome was inhabited by Latin settlers from various regions, farmers and pastoralists, as evidenced by differences in pottery and burial techniques. The historical Latins were originally an Italic tribe who inhabited the Alban Hills. They later moved down into the valleys, which provided better land for agriculture. The area around the Tiber was particularly advantageous and offered notable strategic resources: the river was a natural border on one side, and the hills could provide a safe defensive position on the other side. This position would also have enabled the Latins to control the river and the commercial and military traffic on it from the natural observation point at Isola Tiberina. Moreover, road traffic could be controlled, since Rome was at the intersection of the principal roads to the sea coming from Sabinum (in the northeast) and Etruria (to the northwest).\n\nThere is a wide consensus that the city developed gradually through the aggregation (\"synoecism\") of several villages around the largest one on the Palatine. This aggregation, signalling the transition from a proto-urban to an urban settlement, was made possible by the increase in agricultural productivity above the subsistence level, which allowed the establishment of secondary and tertiary activities: in turn, these boosted the development of trade with the Greek colonies of southern Italy (mainly Ischia and Cumae). All these events, which according to the archeological excavations occurred around the mid 8th century BC, can be considered as the origin of the city.\n\nRecent studies suggest that the Quirinal hill was very important in ancient times, although the first hill to be inhabited seems to have been the Palatine (thus confirming the legend), which is also at the centre of ancient Rome. Its three peaks, the minor hills \"Cermalus\" or \"Germalus\", \"Palatium\", and \"Velia\", were united with the three peaks of the Esquiline (\"Cispius\", \"Fagutal\", and \"Oppius\"), and then villages on the Caelian Hill and Suburra.\n\nRecent discoveries revealed that the \"Germalus\" on the northern part of the Palatine was the site of a village (dated to the 9th century BC) with circular or elliptical dwellings. It was protected by a clay wall (perhaps reinforced with wood), and it is likely that this is where Rome was really founded.\n\nThe territory of this federation was surrounded by a sacred border called the \"pomerium\", which enclosed the so-called Servian expansion of Rome.\n\nFestivals for the \"Septimontium\" (literally \"of the seven hills\") on December 11 were previously considered to be related to the foundation of Rome. However, April 21 is the only date for Rome's foundation upon which all the legends agree, and it has recently been argued that Septimontium celebrated the first federations among Roman hills. A similar federation was, in fact, celebrated by the Latins at Cave or at Monte Cavo (in \"Castelli\").\n\nDuring the Italian Renaissance, a group of humanists affiliated with the Roman Academy formed a sodality to pursue antiquarian interests, celebrating the \"birthday of Rome\" annually on April 20. In 1468, the Academy was suppressed by Pope Paul II for fomenting \"republicanism, paganism, and conspiracy\", but the sodality was reinstated about ten years later under Sixtus IV as the \"Societas Literatorum S. Victoris in Esquiliis\" (\"Literary Society of Saint Victor on the Esquiline\"). The reformed group placed itself under the new patronage of saints Victor, Fortunatus, and Genesius, \"whose feast day was conveniently proven to coincide with the Palilia\". Their \"Palilia\" was organized by Pomponio Leto and featured speeches, a communal meal, and a poetry competition.\n\n\n"}

His father Julius Neugass (1869-1939) was an ear, nose and throat specialist in Mannheim. Neugass took part in World War I in 1917, but was released in 1918 after being seriously injured. Influenced by the Wandervogel youth movement, he temporarily turned to Protestantism. \n\nFrom 1919 he studied art history and archeology in Munich, Berlin and Bonn and completed his doctorate in 1924, writing a thesis on Gothic choir stalls, supervised by art historian Carl Neumann (1860-1934) in Heidelberg.\n\nIn 1925 he was a volunteer at the Deutschen Archäologischen Institut (German Archaeological Institute) in Rome and then in Florence and participated in excavations on Sicily. \n\nIn 1926 he settled in Paris and became a photographer and correspondent for numerous German and international newspapers. He reported for the \"Berliner Tageblatt\", the \"Vossische Zeitung\", Cicerone, \"Kunst\", and especially Weltkunst. He became known for his reviews for world art and reports on the current Paris art scene. In addition to exhibition reports and essayistic works he wrote knowledgeable monographs on artists including de Chirico, Matisse, Pissarro, and Cézanne. In autumn 1933 he was romantically involved with , first wife of Max Ernst (m. 1918–1927), who had fled to Paris. From 1933-39, he set out as a photographer and correspondent traveling widely and reported for English, American, French and Swiss newspapers mainly on travel and politics in Mediterranean countries.\n\nShortly after the outbreak of the Second World War Neugass was interned in the camp Fort Carré in Antibes. In November 1939 he was transferred to Les Milles near Aix-en-Provence. There he met amongst others Max Ernst, Walter Hasenclever and Lion Feuchtwanger. In 1939, under the pseudonym \"François Neuville\" he wrote the novel \"Das Geheimnis um die Venus\" (‘The Mystery about Venus’), originally planned as a movie starring the actor Raimu, which appeared in two separate Swiss newspapers. In the spring of that year he joined the French army.\n\nAs a journalist, he was accused by the Vichy regime in 1941 of distributing enemy propaganda and sentenced. In order to forestall the impending expulsion to Germany, he emigrated in late 1941 via Casablanca and Cuba to the United States. \n\nFrom 1942 to 1947 Neugass worked in various bookstores and for the Red Cross. In 1944 he married librarian Lotte Labus, who had earned her own Ph.D in Berlin, and was granted American citizenship in 1947 and freelanced for several magazines, including articles illustrated with his own photographs ’Window Shopping With Your Camera’ for \"Popular Photography.\" and 'Portraiture with Match and Candle' for \"The American Annual of Photography\" In the 1950s he wrote for various European newspapers \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\", \"Handelsblatt\", \"Aufbau\", and \"Art News\" and was the American correspondent to the Swiss \"Camera\" magazine in which, in writing on 'The photographers of the United Nations' he expressed the opinion that “The aim of the United Nations is identical with that which lies closest to the hearts of photographers: to bring the nations closer together through mutual understanding,”\n\nNeugass became a member of the American Society of Magazine Photographers and was exhibited in the Village Camera Club. He traveled to Mexico to make ethnological photographic documentation of rural life in 1953 which was shown in an exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History in 1954. His photography was featured by Edward Steichen in two exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art; \"Abstraction in Photography\", May 1–July 4, 1951 which featured his photographs of New York skyscrapers reflected in puddles, windows and on car duco, and \"The Family of Man\" January 24–May 8, 1955, his contribution to the latter being made on Coney Island of swimsuit-clad couples embracing on the beach. The photograph later illustrated a 1979 book on body language. \n\nNeugass' late work as a journalist included critical evaluations of the buying policy of the museums and strategies of the art market. Due to failing health, in January 1979, Neugass turned down their offer to be American editor for the German magazine \"Kunst\". He passed away in June. A memorial exhibit of Neugass' work was held on the 15th of October 1979 at Goethe House in New York City.\n\nHis estate is kept in the University at Albany, New York and was compiled by Lotte Neugass (née Labus) prior to their deposit there in the M.E.

Among these is the 9th century Laguna Copperplate Inscription found in 1989, deciphered in 1992 to be Kavi script (Pallava alphabet) with Sanskrit words; the golden Agusan statue discovered in another part of Philippines in 1917 has also been linked to Hinduism.\n\nThere is some growth in the religion as of late, although most temples cater to the same communities. Actual adherents of Hinduism are mostly limited to communities that include indigenous and native peoples, expatriate communities, as well as new converts. There are various ISKCON groups and popular Hindu personalities and groups such as Sathya Sai Baba, and Paramahansa Yogananda (SRF) that can be found. Hindu based practices like Yoga and meditation are also popular. The Personal Representative on Earth of the Supreme Divine Person, Swāmī Mahāprabhu, has been residing in Quezon City since September 2011. There are also notable archery ranges named after characters in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata called \"Kodanda Archery Range\" (named after Lord Rama's bow Kodanda) and \"Gandiva Archery\" (named after Arjuna's bow Gandiva).\nOne source estimated the size of the Indian community in the Philippines in 2008 at 150,000 persons.Most of whom are hindus and christians.\n\nAt present, however, it is limited primarily to the immigrant Indian community, though traditional religious beliefs in most parts of the country have strong Hindu and Buddhist influences.\nOver the last three decades, a large number of civil servants and highly educated Indians working in large banks, Asian Development Bank and the BPO sector have migrated to Philippines, especially Manila. Most of the Indian Filipinos and Indian expatriates are Hindu, Sikh or Muslims, but have assimilated into Filipino culture and some are Catholic . The community regularly conducts philanthropic activities through bodies such as the Mahaveer foundation, The SEVA foundation and the\nSathya Sai organization. Most Hindus congregate for socio-cultural and religious activities at the Hindu Temple (Mahatma Gandhi Street, Paco, Manila), the Indian Sikh Temple (United Nations Avenue, Paco, Manila), and the Radha Soami Satsang Beas center (Alabang, Muntinlupa City, Metro Manila). The late \"priest\" (scripture reader in Sindhi and Gurumukhi) of the Hindu Temple, Giani Joginder Singh Sethi, was active in interfaith affairs, accepted visits by school students, and organised the first major translation of Guru Nanak's Jap Ji into Filipino (Tagalog), translated by Usha Ramchandani and edited by Samuel Salter (published 2001).\n\nThere are two Hindu temples in Manila city-Hari Ram Temple (Paco) and Saya Aur Devi Mandir Temple (Paco).\n\nThe archipelagos of Southeast Asia were under the influence of Hindu Odisha and Indonesian traders through the ports of Malay-Indonesian islands. Indian religions, possibly an amalgamated version of Hindu-Buddhist arrived in Philippines archipelago in the 1st millennium, through the Indonesian kingdom of Srivijaya followed by Majapahit. Archeological evidence suggesting exchange of ancient spiritual ideas from India to the Philippines includes the 1.79 kilogram, 21 carat gold Hindu goddess Agusan (sometimes referred to as Golden Tara), found in Mindanao in 1917 after a storm and flood exposed its location. The statue now sits in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, and is dated from the period 13th to early 14th centuries.\n\nJuan Francisco suggests that the golden Agusan statue may be a representation of goddess Sakti of the Siva-Buddha (Bhairava) tradition found in Java, in which the religious aspect of Shiva is integrated with those found in Buddhism of Java and Sumatra. The Rajahnate of Butuan, in present-day Agusan del Norte and Butuan City, used Hinduism as its main religion along with indigenous Lumad nature-worships. A Hindu Tamil King of the Rajahnate of Cebu was also recorded.\n\nAnother gold artifact, from the Tabon Caves in the island of Palawan, is an image of Garuda, the bird who is the mount of Vishnu. The discovery of sophisticated Hindu imagery and gold artifacts in Tabon Caves has been linked to those found from Oc Eo, in the Mekong Delta in Southern Vietnam. These archaeological evidence suggests an active trade of many specialized goods and gold between India and Philippines and coastal regions of Vietnam and China. Golden jewelry found so far include rings, some surmounted by images of Nandi – the sacred bull, linked chains, inscribed gold sheets, gold plaques decorated with repoussé images of Hindu deities.\n\nIn 1989, a laborer working in a sand mine at the mouth of Lumbang River near Laguna de Bay found a copper plate in Barangay Wawa, Lumban. This discovery, is now known as the Laguna Copperplate Inscription by scholars. It is the earliest known written document found in the Philippines, dated to be from the 9th century AD, and was deciphered in 1992 by Dutch anthropologist Antoon Postma. The copperplate inscription suggests economic and cultural links between the Tagalog people of Philippines with the Javanese Medang Kingdom, the Srivijaya empire, and the Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms of India. Hinduism in the country declined when Islam was introduced by traders from Arabia which was then followed by Christianity from Spain. This is an active area of research as little is known about the scale and depth of Philippine history from the 1st millennium and before.\n\nMany fables and stories in Filipino Culture are linked to Indian arts, such as the story of the monkey and the turtle, the race between deer and snail (slow and steady wins the race), and the hawk and the hen. Similarly, the major epics and folk literature of Philippines show common themes, plots, climax and ideas expressed in the Mahabharata and the Ramayana.\n\nAccording to Indologists Juan R. Francisco and Josephine Acosta Pasricha, Hindu influences and folklore arrived in Philippines by about 9th to 10th century AD. The Maranao version is the \"Maharadia Lawana\" (King Rāvaṇa of Hindu Epic Ramayana).\n\nWith the advent of Spanish colonialism in the 16th century, the Philippines became a closed colony and cultural contacts with other Southeast Asian countries were limited, if not closed. In 1481, the Spanish Inquisition commenced with the permission of Pope Sixtus IV and all non-Catholics within the Spanish empire were to be expelled or to be \"put to the question\" (tortured until they renounced their previous faith). With the re-founding of Manila in 1571, the Philippines became subject to the King of Spain, and the Archbishop of New Galicia (Mexico) became the Grand Inquisitor of the Faithful in Mexico and the Philippines. In 1595, the newly appointed Archbishop of Manila became the Inquisitor-General of the Spanish East Indies (i.e.,the Philippines, Guam, and Micronesia), and until 1898 was active against Protestants, Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims. As was the case in Latin America and Africa, forced conversions were not uncommon and any refusal to submit to Church authority was seen as both rebellion against the Pope and sedition against the Spanish Crown, which was punishable by death.\n\nLinguistic influence left lasting marks on every Philippine language. Below are some borrowed terms, which were often Buddhist and Hindu concepts, with the original Sanskrit; some of the words in many Philippine languages are loaned from Sanskrit and Tamil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23134828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23134828", "title": "Historical Sabbatical Years", "text": "Historical Sabbatical Years\n\nVarious attempts have been made to reconstruct when Sabbatical years actually fell using clues in the Biblical text and events clearly dated in fixed historically understood calendars. This is important because the system of Jubilee and Sabbatical (Shmita) years provides a useful check in deciding between competing reconstructions of the histories of the First Temple period and earlier and the history of the Second Temple period and later. There are explicit mentions of a Sabbatical year found in Josephus, 1 Maccabees, and in various legal contracts from the time of Simon bar Kokhba. In contrast, no direct statements that a certain year was a Sabbatical year have survived from First Temple times and earlier.\n\nAnother public reading of the Law, suggesting a Sabbatical year, took place in the third year of Jehoshaphat (2 Chronicles 17:7-9). According to the widely accepted Biblical chronology of Edwin Thiele, Jehoshaphat began a coregency with his father Asa in 872/871 BCE, and his sole reign began in 870/869. The passage about the reading of the law in Jehoshaphat's third year does not specify whether this is measured from the beginning of the coregency or the beginning of the sole reign, but since the two synchronisms to Jehoshaphat's reign for the kings of Israel (1 Kings 22:51, 2 Kings 3:1) are measured from the start of the sole reign, it would be reasonable to determine Jehoshaphat's third year in the same way. In Thiele's system, this would be 867/866. However, Thiele's years for the first few kings of Judah has come under criticism as being one year too late, because of problems that appear in the reign of Ahaziah and Athaliah that Thiele never solved. Therefore, in 2003, an article by Rodger Young showed that the texts that Thiele could not reconcile were in harmony when it was assumed that Solomon died before Tishri 1 in the (Nisan-based) year in which the kingdom divided, rather than in the half-year after Tishri 1 as assumed, without explanation, by Thiele. In 2009 Leslie McFall, who is recognized in Finegan's \"Handbook of Biblical Chronology\" as the foremost living interpreter of Thiele's work, agreed with Young’s correction that moved dates for Jehoshaphat and the preceding kings of Judah up one year, as have some other recent works by evangelicals and creationists studying this the field. With this resolution to Thiele’s problem, the year in which Jehoshaphat had the Law read to the people was 868/867. This is 294 years, or 42 Sabbatical cycles, before Ezekiel's Jubilee. The 42 Sabbatical cycles would make six Jubilee cycles, so it was also a Jubilee year. It is of some passing interest that in 1869, long before the breakthroughs of Valerius Coucke and Thiele that solved the basic problems of how the biblical authors were measuring the years, Ferdinand Hitzig stated that the occasion for Jehoshaphat’s proclamation was because it was a Jubilee year.\n\nIf 574/573 marked a Jubilee, and if the Sabbatical cycles were in phase with the Jubilees, then 700/699 BCE, the year often mentioned as a possible Sabbatical year because of the land lying fallow during that year (Isaiah 37:30, 2 Kings 19:29), was also a Sabbatical, 126 years or 18 Sabbatical cycles before Ezekiel's Jubilee. Assuming a 49-year cycle, the nearest Jubilee would have been in 721 BC, inconsistent with attempts to place a Jubilee after the Sabbatical year at this time. If a 50-year Jubilee cycle is assumed, the nearest Jubilee would be 724/723, and then assuming that a Sabbatical cycle began in the year following a Jubilee, neither 701/700 nor 700/699 would be a Sabbatical year.\n\nCould the passages in Isaiah 37 and 2 Kings 19 be referring to two voluntary fallow years? This might be possible if the Jubilee year was a 50th year separate from the seventh Sabbatical/Shmita year. Young presents a linguistic argument against this interpretation, as follows: \nOthers have imagined that Isa 37:30 and its parallel in 2 Kgs 19:29 refer to a Sabbatical year followed by a Jubilee year, since the prophecy speaks of two years in succession in which there would be no harvest. But the first year could not be a Sabbatical year, because in it the people were allowed to eat “what grows of itself,” for which the Hebrew word is ספיח . In Lev 25:5 the reaping of the ספיח is forbidden during a Sabbatical year. Whatever the exact meaning is for this word, its use in Isaiah’s prophecy and its prohibition in Lev 25:5 means that the first year of the Isaiah and Second Kings passages could not have been a Sabbatical year. This rules out the possibility that the passage is dealing with a Sabbatical year followed by a year of Jubilee. The proper understanding of the passage is that the harvest of the first year had been destroyed by the Assyrians, and the defeat of the Assyrian army came too late in the year to allow sowing that year. The destruction of the Assyrian host came the night after the giving of the prophecy (2 Kgs 19:35), so the reason that sowing and reaping were forbidden for the next year must have been because that year, the second year of the prophecy, was going to be a Sabbatical year.\n\nIt has already been mentioned that the Babylonian Talmud (\"Megillah\" 14b) and the \"Seder Olam\" (ch. 24) mentioned a Jubilee in Josiah's 18th year, 623/622 BCE. With the proper assumption of a 49-year cycle for the Jubilee, the Jubilee would be identical to the seventh Sabbatical year, so that the Jubilee and Sabbatical cycles would never be out of synchronization. 623/622 BCE would therefore also have been a Sabbatical year. In Sabbatical years, the Mosaic code specified that the Law was to be read to all the people (Deuteronomy 31:10-11). Although this commandment, like so many others, was probably neglected throughout most of Israel's history, it was observed in Josiah's 18th year (2 Kings 23:1,2). \n\nVarious scholars have conjectured that Zedekiah's release of slaves, described in Jeremiah 34:8-10, would likely have been done at the start of a Sabbatical year. Although the original Mosaic legislation stated that an indentured servant's term of service was to end six years after the service started (Deuteronomy 15:12), later practice was to associate the Sabbatical year, called a year of release (\"shemitah\") in Deuteronomy 15:9, with the release of slaves. Based on a chronological study of Ezekiel 30:20-21, Nahum Sarna dated Zedekiah's emancipation proclamation to the year beginning in Tishri of 588 BCE. Although Zedekiah's release of slaves could have occurred at any time, the occurrence of a Sabbatical year at just this time provides some insight into the background that probably influenced Zedekiah's thinking, even though the release was later rescinded.\n\nThe year 588/587 BCE was also the year that Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians, consistent with the Babylonian records for the reign of Amel-Marduk and the Scriptural data regarding Jehoiachin and Zedekiah. This is in keeping with the statement in Seder Olam chapter 30, properly translated as discussed above, that put the burning of the First Temple, as well as the Second, in the \"latter part\" of a Sabbatical year. The statement of the Seder Olam in this regard is repeated in the Tosefta (\"Taanit\" 3:9), the Jerusalem Talmud (\"Ta'anit\" 4:5), and three times in the Babylonian Talmud (\"Arakin\" 11b, \"Arakin 12a\", \"Ta'anit\" 29a). An example of the caution that must be exercised when consulting English translations is shown by the Soncino translation in \"Arakin\" 11b, that the Temple was destroyed \"at the end of the seventh [Sabbatical] year\", compared to Jacob Neusner's translation of the corresponding passage in the Jerusalem Talmud, that it was \"the year after the Sabbatical year.\"\n\nA convenient starting place for the study of Sabbatical years in the time of the First Temple is the Jubilee that the Babylonian Talmud (tractate \"Arakin\" 12a), and also the Seder Olam (chapter 11), say was the 17th and which began at the time that Ezekiel saw the vision the occupies the last nine chapters of his book. Although many of the chronological statements of the two Talmuds, as well as in the Seder Olam that preceded them, have been shown to be unhistorical, this particular statement has considerable evidence to support its historicity. One of these evidences is the consistency of this reference with the other Jubilee mentioned in the Talmud and the \"Seder Olam\" (ch. 24), which is placed in the 18th year of Josiah (\"Megillah\" 14b). Ezekiel's vision occurred in the 25th year of the captivity of Jehoiachin (Ezekiel 40:1). Babylonian records state that Amel-Marduk (the Biblical Evil-Merodach) began to reign in October 562 BCE, and 2 Kings 25:27 says that it was in the twelfth month of this accession year (Adar, 561 BCE) and in Jehoiachin's 37th year of captivity that Jehoiachin was released from prison. By Judean reckoning, Jehoiachin's 37th year would then be 562/561 BCE. His 25th year, the year in which Ezekiel saw his vision, is therefore determined as 574/573 BCE, i.e. the year that began in Tishri of 574. Josiah's 18th year, at which time the Talmud says there was another Jubilee, began in 623 BCE, as can be determined from Babylonian records dating the Battle of Carchemish, which occurred shortly after Josiah was slain in his 31st year (2 Kings 22:3, 23:29). This is 49 years before Ezekiel's Jubilee, providing evidence that the Jubilee cycle was 49 years, not 50 years as is accepted by many interpreters, but which has been challenged by recent work such as the study of Jean-François Lefebvre. Zuckermann also held that the Jubilee cycle was 49 years, as did Robert North in his notable study of the Jubilees. A fuller discussion of the reasons that the Jubilee cycle was 49 years can be found in the Jubilee article, where it is pointed out that the known chronological methods of the Talmuds and the Seder Olam were incapable of correctly calculating the time between Josiah's 18th year and the 25th year of the captivity of Jehoiachin, indicating that these remembrances of Jubilees were historical, not contrived.\n\nThat Ezekiel saw his vision at the beginning of a Jubilee year is also shown by his statement that it was \"in the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, on Rosh Hashanah, on the tenth day of the month…;\" (Ezekiel 40:1). It was only in a Jubilee year that Rosh Hashanah (New Year's Day) came on the tenth of Tishri (Leviticus 25:9), the Day of Atonement. The Seder Olam, in relating that Ezekiel's vision was at the beginning of a Jubilee, does not cite the part of Ezekiel 40:1 that says it was Rosh Hashanah and the tenth of the month, indicating that the fact that a Jubilee was commencing was based on historical remembrance, not on just the textual argument regarding Rosh Hashanah being on the tenth of the month. Ezekiel also says it was 14 years after the city fell; 14 years before 574/573 BCE was 588/587 BCE, in agreement with \"the 25th year of our captivity.\"\n\nThe first modern treatise devoted to the Sabbatical (and Jubilee) cycles was that of Benedict Zuckermann. Zuckermann insisted that for Sabbatical years after the Babylonian exile \"it is necessary to assume the commencement of a new starting-point, since the laws of Sabbatical years and Jubilees fell into disuse during the Babylonian captivity, when a foreign nation held possession of the land of Canaan . . . We therefore cannot agree with chronologists who assume an unbroken continuity of septennial Sabbaths and Jubilees.\" The Seder Olam (ch. 30) is explicit that this was the case, i.e. that the returned exiles had a renewed start of tithes, Sabbatical years, and Jubilee years. The first instance of a Sabbatical year treated by Zuckermann was Herod the Great's siege of Jerusalem, as described by Josephus. Zuckermann assigned this to 38/37 BCE, i.e. he considered that a Sabbatical year started in Tishri of 38 BCE. Next, he considered John Hyrcanus's siege of Ptolemy in the fortress of Dagon, which is described both in Josephus (\"Ant\". 13.8.1/235; \"Wars of the Jews\" 1.2.4/59-60) and 1 Maccabees (16:14-16), and during which a Sabbatical year started; from the chronological information provided in these texts, Zuckermann concluded that 136/135 BCE was a Sabbatical year. The next event to be treated was Antiochus Eupator's siege of the fortress Beth-zur (\"Ant\". 12.9.5/378, 1 Maccabees 6:53), dated by Zuckermann to 163/162 BCE. However, he also remarked on the difficulties presented to this figure by the text in 1 Maccabees, which would seem to date the siege one year later, and so he decided to leave it out of consideration. The final text considered by Zuckermann was a passage in the Seder Olam that relates the destruction of the Second Temple to a Sabbatical year, an event that is known from secular history to have happened in the summer of 70 CE. Zuckermann interpreted the Seder Olam text as stating that this happened in a year after a Sabbatical year, thus placing a Sabbatical in 68/69 CE.\n\nAll these dates as calculated by Zuckermann are separated by an integral multiple of seven years, except for the date associated with the siege of Beth-zur. Furthermore, his chronology is consistent with that accepted by the \"geonim\" (medieval Jewish scholars) and the calendar of Sabbatical years used in present-day Israel. All of this would seem to be strong evidence in favor of Zuckermann's scheme. Nevertheless, some problems have been recognized, beyond just the question of the siege of Beth-zur, which was one year too late for Zuckermann's calendar. A consistent problem has been the ambiguity alleged in some of the passages, notably of Josephus, where it has been questioned, for example, when Josephus started the regnal years of Herod the Great. In a study the chronology of all Herod’s reign, Andrew Steinmann presents arguments in favor of dating Herod’s capture of Jerusalem in 10 Tishre of 37 BCE, i.e. just after the Sabbatical year of 38/37, based on references to the activities of Mark Antony and Sossius, Herod’s helpers, in Cassius Dio (49.23.1–2) and also on other considerations. This date is in agreement with Ben Zion Wacholder’s chronology. Therefore, many modern scholars have adopted a Sabbatical year calendar for the Second Temple period that is one year later, although there are many prominent scholars who still maintain a cycle consistent with Zuckermann's conclusion of a 38/37 BCE Sabbatical year.\n\nAmong those who have advocated an adjustment to Zuckermann's chronology, the most extensive studies in its favor have been those of Ben Zion Wacholder. Wacholder had access to legal documents from the time of the Bar Kokhba revolt that were not available to Zuckermann. The arguments of Wacholder and others to support the calendar one year later than that of Zuckermann are rather technical and will not be presented here, except for two items to which Zuckermann, Wacholder, and other scholars have given great weight: 1) the date of Herod’s capture of Jerusalem from Antigonus, and 2) the testimony of the Seder Olam relating the destruction of the Second Temple to a Sabbatical year. Wacholder gives the dates of post-exilic Sabbatical years in the following table:\n\nThe principal author of the Seder Olam, Rabbi Jose, was a pupil of the famous Rabbi Akiva. Jose was a young man when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and burned the Temple. On such an important issue as the year in which the Temple was destroyed, it would be logical that Jose's ideas were taken from his mentor and his mentor's contemporaries.\n\nChapter 30 of the Seder Olam gives the year that both Temples were destroyed as \"ve-motsae sheviit\" (ומוצאי שבעית). Heinrich Guggenheimer's recent translation renders this phrase as \"at the end of a Sabbatical year,\" thus unambiguously supporting the Wacholder calendar that starts a Sabbatical year in the fall of 69 CE. The problem, however, is that many translations of the Seder Olam render the phrase as \"in the year after a Sabbatical year\" or its equivalent. This was the sense adopted by Zuckermann when citing the Seder Olam as supportive of his calendar of Sabbatical years. The same Hebrew phrase is used in the Babylonian Talmud when citing this passage from the Seder Olam, and some modern translations of the Talmud into English translate the phrase in the sense given by Guggenheimer, while others translate it in the sense of \"the year after.\" The Seder Olam uses the same phrase regarding a Sabbatical year for the destruction of both Temples, so that its testimony in this regard is important for dating the \"shemitot\" in both pre-exilic and post-exilic times. Therefore, it would seem necessary to closely examine the phrase in the original Hebrew when making chronological decisions. Unfortunately, this was not done, either by Zuckermann, Wacholder, or Finegan, when citing the Seder Olam's testimony as decisive for their particular calendars of Sabbatical years. Most interpreters have simply relied on an existing translation, and that translation may have been unduly influenced by an attempt to make the translation consistent with the chronology of the geonim that placed the end of the Second Temple in a post-Sabbatical year.\n\nAt least one study has addressed this problem, arguing from both a linguistic standpoint and from a study of related texts in the Seder Olam that the phrase \"ve-motsae sheviit\" should be translated as something close to \"and in the latter part of a Sabbatical year,\" consistent with Guggenheimer's translation and Wacholder's calendar. This recent study argues that a comparative study of the word \"motsae\" (literally, \"goings-out\") does not support any sense of \"after\" (\"after a Sabbatical year\"). Further, the reference of the Seder Olam to a Sabbatical year associated with Jehoiachin is in keeping with a Sabbatical year when the First Temple was burned a few years later, but the Seder Olam would be in conflict with itself if the phrase in chapter 30 was interpreted as saying that the burning was in a post-Sabbatical year.\n\nThe Jubilee and Sabbatical year provided a long-term means for dating events, a fact that must have become obvious soon after the legislation was put into effect. It is of some interest, then, that the Babylonian Talmud (tractate \"Sanhedrin\" 40a,b) records that in the time of the judges, legal events such as contracts or criminal cases were dated according to the Jubilee cycle, the Sabbatical cycle within the Jubilee cycle, and the year within the Sabbatical cycle. The Samaritan community apparently used this method of dating as late as the 14th century CE, when an editor of one of the writings of the Samaritans wrote that he finished his work in the sixty-first Jubilee cycle since the entry into Canaan, in the fourth year of the fifth Sabbatical of that cycle. These cases of usage of the Jubilee/Sabbatical cycles make no provision for the possibility of the Sabbatical cycles being out of phase with the Jubilee cycles, which is additional evidence that the Jubilee was contemporaneous with the seventh Sabbatical year.\n"}

He was the son of Chullakalinga, the youngest son of Kalinga I who had married a virtuous princess from Sagala (Madra) . Kalinga II ascended the throne of the ancient state of Kalinga after the death of his paternal uncle Mahakalinga. Kalinga II finds mention in early Buddhist Jataka records of Chullakalinga Jataka (named after his father) and Kalingabodhi Jataka. He had spent most of his young life in the forests of Himavat where his father lived in exile. Trained with qualities of a king by his father and maternal grandfather, he was asked by Chullakalinga to go back to take the charge of his ancestral kingdom.\n\nOn the request from his father, Kalinga II arrived at Kalinga with the three tokens (a ring with a seal, coverlet and sword) from his father to be shown as symbols of his identity to the courtier Kalinga Bharadvaja who helped his father escape arrest by Mahakalinga. The new king was taught ceremonial and ritualistic rights by Kalinga Bharadvaja and ascended the throne inheriting many precious gifts on the fifteenth day of his coronation.\n\nThe Jatakas narrate that after becoming the king, Kalinga II wished to visit his parents in the forest and rode on his royal elephant towards the forest. He encountered the Bodhi Tree circuit obstructing his way where Buddha had meditated and had got rid of all the worldly desires of the flesh. Out of impatience and unawareness, Kalinga II tries to make his elephant break through the tree repeatedly. Due to pain endured by repeated hitting of the holy Bodhi Tree, the elephant died while the tree stood at its place without moving. Kalinga Bharadvaja made the king aware of the tree's magical and spiritual power eventually and hence the king gave up imparting force. For seven days Kalinga II worshiped the Bodhi tree circuit with fragrance filled ingredients only after which he was able to pass through the place.\n\nChullakalinga Jataka narrates about the war affairs between Assaka and Kalinga kingdoms in the final decades of the 7th Century B.C.E. Also corroborated by Kalingabodhi Jataka, the nature of Kalinga II is depicted as warring and beholding the high dignity for his royal status. Pertaining to this Kalinga II declared that he would marry off his four beautiful daughters to any warrior royalty who can defeat him and his army in the battle. To challenge other kingdoms on this declaration, he sent out his daughters on a well decorated chariot with escorts to surrounding kingdoms on which none dared to stop due to his power until it entered Assaka kingdom. There the king Aruna who was equally powerful and also jealous of Kalinga's glory stopped the chariot and took the four princess as captive. With the helpful advises from his minister Nandisena, he was able to defeat the overpowering forces of Kalinga in a long stretched battle though the initial efforts had taken Kalinga II close to victory. This war is believed to be fought at the frontier areas of Assaka and Kalinga according to the Jatakas where the two forces met up at the cross roads of the Deccan but initially only stalked at each other without crossing the boundary between the two empires. Kalinga II had to give up his daughters hand in marriage to Aruna along with a large amount of dowry after the defeat.\n\nKalinga II was a powerful king and did maintain military superiority over other kingdoms. Though defeated in the battle with Assaka, the ability to march up his forces to its frontiers in the Deccan region shows the territorial extent of his empire could very well be large and not confined to the regions of Odisha and Northern Andhra (the heart land of ancient Kalinga kingdom). Kalinga II was also lenient towards Buddhist ideals as it is found in the narration relating to his encounter with the divine powers of the Bodhi tree.\n"}

The community split nearly evenly—about 700 people continue to follow Blackmore, while about 500 follow Jeffs.\n\nUnder Leroy Johnson's leadership, Marion Hammon and Alma Timpson were dismissed from the Short Creek community in 1983; they went on to create the Centennial Park group (or \"Second Ward\") in Centennial Park, Arizona. \"Second Ward\" distinguishes it from the FLDS Church, which is known as the \"First Ward\".\n\n\nThis group (also known as the Nielsen/Naylor group) primarily resides in the Salt Lake Valley.

Peterson went on to found the Righteous Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the following year.\n\nThe Church of the Firstborn of the Fulness of Times has its headquarters in northern Mexico. It was founded in 1955 by Joel LeBaron and members of his family. LeBaron claimed his priestly line of authority from his father Alma (who was ordained by Alma's grandfather Benjamin F.

Crossfield published revelations he had received in the \"Book of Onias\", which (among other things) chastised certain LDS Church leaders; he was excommunicated in 1972. In 1982 Crossfield established a School of the Prophets, overseen by a president and six counselors. Ron and Dan Lafferty (convicted of the July 1984 murder of their brother Allen's wife and infant daughter) served in March 1984 as counselors in the School of the Prophets in Provo, Utah.

With three mountain ranges to the front and one range to the rear, it appears like a cock's foot, hence its common name Mount Cock's Foot or Mt. Cock's Claw. Yet another name for this mountain is Nine Strata Cliffs.\n\nHaicheng Ling \"et al.\" (2005: p. 40) relate the experience of Xu Xiake (1586-1641):\n\"On the top of Tianzhu Peak, people can admire sun-rise in the east, sea of auspicious clouds in the south, the Cangshan Mountain and the Erhai Lake in the west, and the Yulong Snow Mountain in the north. Xu Xiake (1586-1641), a famous traveller and writer of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), marvelled that on the top of a single peak, people could see the \"Four Scenes\" - sun, lake, cloud and snow. \"\n\nThe mountain is now not only a center of Zen, Pureland, and Tibetan Buddhism, but also a popular weekend getaway for Chinese tourists. A cablecar whisking visitors to the summit was installed above Tangyuan Street (汤圆街) in 2011.\n\n'Mount Jakang Chen' () (alternate names: Riwo Jakang, Mount Jizu, Jizu Shan, Jizushan Mountain)\n\nTan Chung (1998: p. 136) states that:\n\"Among the legends of Yunnan, there is one recorded in the \"Gazetteer of Yunnan Province\" compiled during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). A \"Cock's Foot Hill\" (\"Jizushan\") at Binchuan County in the province was obviously christened after the Sanskrit Kukkatapadagiri - the name of the hill only 50 kilometres away from the bodhi tree under which Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment.\" \n\nDuring the Three Kingdoms period, small nunneries were built, to be later expanded in the Tang dynasty. Most of the temple construction was during the Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty. Temples of note are the: Xitang Temple, Shizhong Temple, Huayan Temple and Jinding Temple (Golden Top) which had been relocated from Kunming. Later, many temples fell into ruins, and now, only Zhushengsi Temple, the gate tower of Jinding Temple and Lengyan Pagoda are maintained.\n\nAs Haicheng Ling \"et al.\" (2005: p. 40) hold:\n\"The first temple on Mount Jizu was built during the Tang dynasty (AD 618-907). Later, more temples were added in the Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties, covering a long period from 960 to 1911. In the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (1662-1722) of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), there were 42 big or small temples, 65 nunneries and more than 170 abodes for peace, with more than 5,000 monks and nuns. Existing temples on Mount Jizu are the Zunsheng Tower Temple, the Xitan Temple, the Zhusheng Temple, the Jiguang Temple, the Shizhong Temple and the Dajue Temple.\"\n\nZunsheng Tower Temple, Xitan Temple, the Zhusheng Temple, the Jiguang Temple, the Shizhong Temple and the Dajue Temple.\n\nLegend and folklore holds it that Mount Jizu was a bodhimandala of Mahakasyapa, one of the foremost disciples of Shakyamuni.\n\nMonica Esposito (1993: vol2., p. 389-440; 1997: p. 67-123) mentions the 'Longmen' (lóngmén) Tantric branch of Mount Jizu a regional example of the tradition that yielded the Longmen Grottoes.\n\nThe Upa-yoga tantra scriptures first appeared in 'Mount Jakang Chen' (; alternate names: Riwo Jakang, Mount Jizu) and the charnel ground of 'Cool Grove' (). Cool Grove is also known as 'Śītavana' (Sanskrit).\n\nYinxiang Temple 迎祥寺 (present day Zhusheng Temple ) on Jizu mountains became the field of activity of the famous monk Xu Yun (? - 1959). The story was recently popularized in the TV-series 百年虚云 (PRC, 2009, cf. ).\n\n\n"}

Organized religion is typically characterized by an official doctrine (or dogma), a hierarchical or bureaucratic leadership structure, and a codification of rules and practices. \n\nOrganized religion, or institutional religion, is religion in which belief systems and rituals are systematically arranged and formally established. Organized religion is typically characterized by an official doctrine (or dogma), a hierarchical or bureaucratic leadership structure, and a codification of rules and practices.\n\nOrganized religion is distinguished from the broader idea of religion especially in anthropology, sociology and philosophy. American philosopher William James states that Religion... shall mean for us the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude... in relation to whatever they may consider the divine. Since the relation may be either moral, physical, or ritual, it is evident that out of religion in the sense in which we take it, theologies, philosophies, and ecclesiastical organizations may secondarily grow. James further comments that the essential elements of \"institutional religion\" are \"worship and sacrifice, procedures for working on the dispositions of the deity [i.e.] theology, and ceremony and ecclesiastical organization\".\n\nOrganized religion seems to have gained prevalence since the Neolithic era with the rise of wide-scale civilization and agriculture. Organized religions may include a state's official religion, or state church. However, most political states have any number of organized religions practiced within their jurisdiction. Due to their structured, standardized, and easily proliferated form, organized religions comprise many of the world's major religious groups. The Abrahamic religions are all largely considered organized (including Christianity, Islam, Judaism and the Bahá'í Faith), as well as some schools of thought within Indian religions (for example, some schools of Hinduism and Buddhism).\n\nReligions that are not considered organized religions, or only loosely so, include many indigenous and folk religions, such as traditional African religions, Native American religions and prehistoric religions, as well as personal religions including some strands of Hinduism.\n\nIn the modern era, the definition of the term 'religion' is becoming increasingly opaque, making the task of defining 'organised religion' difficult. Anthropologists, theologians and scholars have thus attempt to embed the idea of an 'organisation' into the definition of religion itself. Some examples of this are found in the definition provided by Clifford Geertz, who defines religion as a \"Cultural system.\" Furthermore, Max Weber's prominent definition of a religion includes the idea of a 'Church,' not necessarily in the Christian formulation, but insisting on the notion of an organised hierarchy constituting a palpable religious body. Therefore, it becomes apparent that 'organised religion' has also been considered as part of the definition of religion itself, which in the modern era has caused a degree of controversy with the prominence of aforementioned personalized faith systems.\n"}

Two other men also noticed a white figure on the top of the church and the sighting was reported to the police. A crowd gathered on the site and the police attempted to disperse it. According to the police, the sighting was just a reflection of the light from the street lamps. However, the crowds reportedly viewed the sighting as a clear apparition of the Virgin Mary, and so, the attempts by the police to disperse the crowd were unsuccessful. The event itself ended after a few minutes.\n\nOne week later on April 9 the phenomenon reoccurred, again lasting for only a few minutes. After that time apparitions became more frequent, sometimes two-three times a week, for several years, ending in 1971. According to Coptic tradition, the site is one of the locations where the Holy family stayed during their flight into Egypt.\n\nThe head of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, Pope of Alexandria, Kyrillos VI appointed a committee of high-ranking priests and bishops to investigate the matter, headed by Bishop Gregorios, bishop of postgraduate studies, Coptic culture and scientific research. On May 4 Kyrillos VI issued an official statement confirming the apparitions.\nNuns of the Society of the Sacred Heart also witnessed the apparitions and sent a detailed report to the Vatican, resulting in the arrival of an envoy on April 28 who also saw the apparitions and sent a report to Pope Paul VI. As the apparition appeared over a Coptic church, the Vatican left the investigation to the Coptic authorities. On May 5, 1968, Coptic Orthodox Pope Kyrillos VI approved the apparition.\nThe apparitions were also witnessed by President Gamal Abdel Nasser, and captured by newspaper photographers and Egyptian television. Investigations performed by the police could find no explanation for the phenomenon. No device was found within a radius of fifteen miles capable of projecting the image, while the sheer number of photographs from independent sources suggests that no photographic manipulation was involved. Having been unable to produce an alternative explanation for the luminous sightings, the Egyptian government accepted the apparitions as true.\n\nEstimates of the number of observers of the event vary greatly. Thousands were said to have flocked to the Church after the first announced occurrences of the phenomenon. Some claim the apparitions were seen by millions. Other sources estimate the figure at around 250,000 in total. Cynthia Nelson was a professor of anthropology at AUC (American University in Cairo) and the founding director of the Institute of Gender and Women's Studies. She visited the church site on several occasions including April 15, 1968, another week later near the end of April and on June 1, 1968. Despite the accounts of ongoing, if irregular, visitations by the Marian apparition, Cynthia Nelson documents seeing nothing other than a few 'intermittent flashes of light'.\n\nSome authors suggest that the sightings must be considered in context. The appearances came at a period of crisis in Egyptian history and, echoed \"a widespread feeling that the defeat of Egypt in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war was the result of having abandoned faith in favor of human-made ideas and belief systems.\"\n\nSociologists Robert Bartholomew and Erich Goode offer the Zeitoun apparitions as a prominent case of mass hysteria: “It appears that the Marian observers were predisposed by religious background and social expectation to interpreting the light displays as related to the Virgin Mary.”\n\nOn 12 May 2018, the Coptic Church celebrated the golden Jubilee of the event., Pope Tawadros II held the four Holy Mass. A large number of priests and Christians from all over Egypt attended the celebration, Sub-celebrations have been held from May 10 to May 13.\n\n\n\n"}

It holds that in the absence of certainty, probability is the best criterion. It can also refer to a 17th-century religious thesis about ethics, or a modern physical-philosophical thesis.\n\nIn ancient Greek philosophy, probabilism referred to the doctrine which gives assistance in ordinary matters to one who is skeptical in respect of the possibility of real knowledge: it supposes that though knowledge is impossible, a man may rely on strong beliefs in practical affairs. This view was held by the skeptics of the New Academy (see Academic skepticism and Carneades).\n\nAcademic skeptics accept probabilism, while Pyrrhonian skeptics do not.\n\nIn modern usage, a probabilist is someone who believes that central epistemological issues are best approached using probabilities. This thesis is neutral with respect to whether knowledge entails certainty or whether skepticism about knowledge is true.\n\nProbabilist doctrines continue to be debated in the context of artificial general intelligence, as a counterpoint to the use of non-monotonic logic, as the proper form for knowledge representation remains unclear.\n\nIn moral theology, especially Catholic, it refers especially to the view in casuistry that in difficult matters of conscience one may safely follow a doctrine that is probable, for example is approved by a recognized Doctor of the Church, even if the opposite opinion is more probable.\n\nThis view was advanced by the Spanish theologian Bartolomé de Medina (1527–1581) and defended by many Jesuits such as Luis Molina (1528–1581). It was heavily criticised by Blaise Pascal in his \"Provincial Letters\" and by St. Alphonsus Ligourí in his \"Theologia Moralis\", as leading to moral laxity. Opposed to probabilism is probabiliorism (Latin \"probabilior\", \"more likely\"), which holds that when there is a preponderance of evidence on one side of a controversy one is obliged to follow that side, and tutiorism (Latin \"tutior\", \"safer\"), which holds that in case of doubt one must take the morally safer side. A more radical view, \"minus probabilissimus\", holds that an action is permissible if a single opinion allowing that action is available, even if the overwhelming weight of opinion proscribes it.\n\nThe doctrine became particularly popular at the start of the 17th century, as it could be used to support almost any position or council any advice. By mid-century, such thinking, termed Laxism, was recognized as scandalous.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1421241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1421241", "title": "Pushkaram", "text": "Pushkaram\n\nPushkaram is an Indian festival dedicated to worshiping of rivers. It is also known as \"Pushkaralu\" (in Telugu), \"Pushkara\" (in Kannada) or \"Pushkar\".\n\nIt is celebrated at shrines along the banks of 12 major sacred rivers in India, in the form of ancestor worship, spiritual discourses, devotional music and cultural programmes. The celebration happens annually, once in 12 years along each river. Each river is associated with a zodiac sign, and the river for each year's festival is based on which sign Jupiter is in at the time. Due to regional variations, some of the zodiac signs are associated with multiple rivers.\n\nAccording to a legend mentioned in astrology treatises such as \"Jataka Parijata\" (1426), a Brahmin was granted a boon from Shiva after severe penance. The boon was that he would be able to live in water and purify the holy rivers. The Brahmin came to be known as \"Pushkara\" (\"the one who nourishes\"). On a request from Bṛhaspati (Jupiter), he decided to enter one of the 12 sacred rivers when Bṛhaspati traveled from one zodiac sign to another.\n\nEach river is associated with a zodiac sign, and the river for each year's festival is based on which zodiac sign the planet Jupiter (Bṛhaspati) is in at that time. There are periods when Jupiter is in retrograde motion, resulting in entry into the same Zodiac sign twice in a year. On such occasions, the second entry of Jupiter is reckoned for celebrating the first part of the festival.\n\nThe \"Pushkaram\" tradition is not mentioned in the early Hindu texts; it is part of the medieval Hindu astrological lore. Therefore, the names of 12 rivers may vary depending on the regional traditions. For example, in Maharashtra, Bhima is associated with Scorpio sign, while in Tamil Nadu, Tamraparni is associated with it. The sacred rivers include:\n\nPushkaram celebrations include reverence of ancestors, spiritual discourses, devotional music and cultural programmes. The devotees engage in activities such as \"snana\" (bath in the river), \"dāna\" (charity), \"japa\" (recitation of mantras), \"archana\" and \"dhyana\" (meditation).\n\nTheoretically, the festival lasts as long as Jupiter remains in the corresponding zodiac sign (generally, for one year). However, it draws major crowds only during the first 12 days. The first 12 days when the Jupiter enters the zodiac sign and the last 12 days when it exits the zodiac sign are considered as most auspicious. A dip in the sacred river is believed to erase all sins. The first twelve days are known as \"Adi Pushkaram\", and the last twelve days are called \"Anthya Pushkaram\". It is believed that during the above period of twenty-four days, \"Pushkar\", imbued with the power to make any river holy, will travel with Jupiter as Jupiter moves from one Zodiac house to another. Planets that fall in the \"Pushkara navamsa\" or \"Puskara bhaga\" of a birthchart are considered to be very beneficial and auspicious in jyotish astrology. \n\nIn Telugu-speaking states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, Pushkaralu are celebrated for Godavari, Krishna, Tungabhadra, Pranahita and Bhima (near Bhima-Krishna Sangam) rivers. The major towns and cities to easily reach out by train and extensive bus services for pushkaralu in Telugu states are Godavari: Rajahmundry (Airport also), Bhadrachalam, Mancherial, Basara; Krishna: Vijayawada/Amaravati (Airport also), Nagarjuna Sagar, Srisailam, Beechupalli, Repalle; Tungabhadra: Mantralayam, Kurnool, Alampur; Pranahita: Kaleswaram-Sironcha (of Chattisgarh), Korisini, and Vemanpally; Bhima: Khalhalli. All these places can be reached by direct bus services from Hyderabad and all local district headquarters. \n\nIn Tamil Nadu, Pushkaram is celebrated in Tamraparni River when Jupiter is in Scorpio. In the four places where River Tamraparni flows from south to north, Banathirtham, Papanasam, Thirupudaimaruthur and Sinthupoondurai, the festival is celebrated in accordance with tradition. The Tamraparni temple at Suthamalli is also a place of religious celebration during the Pushkaram year.\n\n\n"}

Islam is the second largest religion in Kenya, practiced by about 9.7% of the total population. Other faiths practiced in Kenya are Baha'i, Buddhism, Hinduism and traditional religions.\n\nRoman Catholicism was first brought to Kenya in the fifteenth century by the Portuguese, and was spread rapidly during the 20th century by missionaries. Today, the main Christian denominations in Kenya are Protestant confessions, which make up about 47.4% of the country's religious composition. They include the Anglican Church of Kenya, Africa Inland Church, and the Presbyterian, Reformed, Methodist, Baptist, Lutheran, and Pentecostal churches. The Roman Catholic Church represents 23.3% of the population.\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church has over 650,000 members in Kenya (2010), making it the largest Orthodox Church in Africa (after the Oriental Orthodox Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church). In 2016 two new dioceses were created within the Orthodox Archdiocese of Kenya, namely the Diocese of Nyeri and Mount Kenya, as well as the Diocese of Kisumu and West Kenya, both falling under the Archdiocese of Nairobi, which is since 2001 presided by Archbishop Makarios (Tillyrides).\n\nOther statistically significant non-Catholic and non-Protestant movements include the New Apostolic Church, Seventh-day Adventist Church, Jehovah's Witnesses, United Pentecostal Church International, and Branhamism. The non-Protestant and non-Catholic groups make up about 11.8% of the population.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has more than 10,000 members in 39 congregations in Kenya. They also have 2 family history centres in Kenya, and an employment resource center in Nairobi.\n\nA 2015 study estimates some 70,000 Christian believers from a Muslim background in the country, most of them belonging to some form of Protestantism.\n\nIslam is the religion of approximately 11.1% of the Kenyan population. Islamic organisations dispute the figures suggested. Some sources suggest the number of Muslims in Kenya between 35% and 45%. Most Muslims in Kenya are Sunni, mostly of the Shafii rite. Approximately 7% percent identify themselves as Shia and about 4% identify themselves as Ahmadi Muslims. Muslims are concentrated mainly in the Coastal and North Eastern Regions. Nairobi has several mosques and a notable Muslim population. There are large and historically significant populations of Swahili Muslims on the coast (most notably in Mombasa, Lamu and Malindi), in the Western Province, and smaller numbers of Somali, Arab and South Asian Muslims.\n\nReligious Shari'ah courts, called Kadhi courts, are given jurisdiction over certain civil matters such as divorce and inheritance under the constitution of Kenya. Muslims have complained that they are targeted and discriminated against by the government, particularly since the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Nairobi and elsewhere. The religions subsiding in Kenya do not display the distinctions between the 42 cultures. They mainly display the traditions of the larger \"umbrella\" cultures.\n\nAfrican religions are typically based on natural phenomena and reverence to ancestors. The dead are presumed to merely transform into another state of being and capable of bringing good fortune or calamity to the living. Most religious rites are therefore centred on appeasing the dead through sacrifices and proper burial rites. The dead's wishes must also be followed to the letter. \nFollowers of traditional Kikuyu religion believe Ngai resides on Mt. Kenya and say their prayers facing the mountain. Followers of traditional Mijikenda religion have their holy shrines in the forests where they offer sacrifices and pray.\n\nThe Maasai, Turkana, Samburu and Pokot tribes also have significant numbers of persons adhering exclusively to traditional African religions.\n\nThere are Hindus living in Kenya. The numbers are estimated to be around 0.14% of the population. They are mainly located in the capital of Kenya, Nairobi, and other urban areas such as Mombasa, Eldoret, Thika and Kisumu.\n\nIn the 2009 Census, 922,128 people reported themselves as having \"no religion\". This is 2.4% of the total, making this group larger than the groups reporting themselves as traditionalists, Hindu or other religion. 61,233, 0.2%, reported that they did not know their religion. There is a stigma against people who are atheists in Kenya. A Gallup poll conducted in 2012 found that 88% of Kenyans considered themselves \"a religious person\", 9% consider themselves \"a non religious person\", while 2% define themselves as \"a convinced atheist\", placing Kenya in top 10 religious populations in the world.\n\nSince 1999, Buddhism has grown in Kenya. There are more than 1000 Buddhists in Kenya. Buddhism is also one of the fastest growing religions in Kenya.\n\nNairobi Buddhist Vihara/Temple is the main centre of Buddhism in Kenya .Nairobi Vihara conducts missions and meditation programs to promote Buddhism in Kenya.\n\nPresent in Kenya from 1945, the religion grew to an estimated 308,000 people in 2005 or about 1% of the population. In the 1990s the Bahá'ís in Kenya participated in a nationwide community health project including vaccinations, maintaining latrines and developing clean water sources.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "54182604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54182604", "title": "Sexual differences in Jainism", "text": "Sexual differences in Jainism\n\nAccording to the \"Tattvārtha-sūtra\", all beings - save for infernal beings, one-sensed beings, or gods - possess one of three genders: female, male, or hermaphroditic. These genders are produced by a specific \"body-making karma\" that is attached to the soul of an individual being. In the process of achieving spiritual liberation, this karma is shed in order to free the soul from the cycle of rebirths known as \"saṃsāra.\" As such, all beings that have the potential to achieve spiritual liberation can do so, regardless of gender. This point, however, has been hotly debated amongst Śvetāmbara and Digambara Jains, so much so that a major sectarian difference between the two rests on the issues of female mendicants and female salvation.\n\nJain literary traditions also reveal an ambiguous perception of non-males. Women are sometimes portrayed as virtuous mothers and learned teachers, while at other times, they, and other-gendered beings, are seen as temptresses and evildoers.\n\nThus, despite the fact that Jainism offers an \"almost unique insistence upon women [and others] as legitimate soteriological agents,\" there is a preponderance of characterizations, sources, and references that negatively influence the perception of women and other-gendered beings within the tradition.\n\nOne of the most fundamental distinctions between Śvetāmbara and Digambara Jains is their respective views on women as mendicants, or nuns, that originated over their debates regarding nudity. The general consensus between the two sects is that the Jinas, and especially the last Tīrthaṅkara Mahāvīra, practiced naked asceticism. Digambara Jains claims that it is necessary for all mendicants to conduct their renunciation without clothing. For them, this represents the idealized practice of \"aparigraha,\" in which a mendicant renounces all property and possessions, including clothing. Śvetāmbara Jains, however, claim that nudity as the exemplary mode of asceticism is impossible in this period of the cosmic age, and as such, it is \"deemed inappropriate.\" For the Śvetāmbaras, the white robes commonly associated with them are interpreted as mere tools that enhance religious life.\n\nThe debate on nudity would translate into a concern about the renunciant and soteriological potential of women. For Digambaras, women cannot become ascetics as they could not be naked, which was seen as \"an essential component of the path to liberation.\" Women were also seen as essentially immoral - and therefore unsuited to become a mendicant - because their bodies \"generate and destroy life-forms within their sexual organs... thus repeatedly infringing nonviolence.\" Women, then, were exempt from spiritual liberation because their bodies consistently broke the cardinal rule of \"ahiṃsā.\" The Śvetāmbaras accepted the premise that naked nuns would be inappropriate; however, because they viewed clothing as auxiliary to religious pursuits, the issue of female mendicants was resolved as they would be clothed. Additionally, Śvetāmbara Jains argued that women were not exempt from spiritual liberation, given that there is nothing within Jain scriptures that precludes such.\n\nThe debates haunt the discussion of gender, and particularly women, in Jainism, as the mendicant tradition is seen as one of the most significant features of Jain religious practice. Yet, it is important to note that simply because the \"liberal\" Śvetāmbaras do not preclude spiritual liberation for women, women are still viewed in various ways - both positively and negatively - as shown by the Jain literary tradition.\n\nAs Manisha Sethi observes, \"[T]here is no single archetype but a heterogeneity of ideals that appear sometimes to buttress women's claim to independent spiritual life, and at other times, to erode this pursuit.\" Her point brings to bear the fact that the broader Jain literary tradition has stories that both inspire and demonize Jain nuns and laywomen. For example, there are goddess beings such as the \"yakṣī\" Padmāvatī, who can intercede on behalf of \"the non-salvational needs of their Jaina devotees, needs which cannot be met by the aloof, unresponsive, and totally-transcendent Tīrthaṅkaras.\" There are also stories about early Jain women whose chastity and righteousness eventually lead to their liberation, such as Rājīmatī, wife of the 22nd Tīrthaṅkara Neminātha.\n\nYet at the same time, women - be they laywomen or nuns - are viewed as sexual agents with potentially nefarious goals. Indeed, while Jain monks are meant to control their sexual desires via their ascetic practices, the \"Sūtṛakrtāṅga-sūtra \"details how \"a woman will tempt [a monk] to a comfortable couch or bed\" by seductive means. Women are seen as cat-like predators who prevent Jain monks from achieving their lofty spiritual goals. Unlike their lay counterparts, references to Jain nuns within the texts about monastic conduct are notably absent. This lack of representation, argues Sethi, is an act of erasure: denying women equal opportunity in renunciate activities and leaves the Jain spiritual worldview solely within the domain of male practitioners. However, nuns are not exempt from being characterized as dangerous sexual agents, as a Jain nun needs to both protect her own chastity from \"potential molesters and rapists \"as well as her own self\".\"\n\nWhile representations of women as goddesses or chaste liberators within the literary tradition offers an alternative, and positive, vision of women within Jainism, at the same time, the negative depictions nonetheless \"create[s] virulently misogynist cultural roles for women.\"\n\nAmong the numerous figures within Jain texts, an important discussion is to be had regarding the 19th Tīrthaṅkara Mallinātha, who represents a unique case study in the debates and figurations of Jain women. For Śvetāmbara Jains, Mallinātha represents the capacity of women to achieve spiritual liberation, given that Mallinātha is depicted as a woman known as Mallī Devi. Mallī was a king in her previous life known as Mahā-bala, who, along with his six friends, decided to become a mendicant after hearing an ascetic preach. They all agreed to fast together, but Mahā-bala secretly desired to outperform his friends in their fasts. After they completed the life-ending fast known as \"sallekhanā,\" Mahā-bala's friends were reborn as gods and then kings; however, Mahā-bala was reborn as a woman because of his deceitful passion, which is considered to be a characteristic of women. Thus, despite the fact that Mallī rises to the occasion of Tīrthaṅkara, her gender is still a karmic defect or failure unlike the case of male Tīrthaṅkaras. Digambara Jains review the view that Mallinātha was a woman, as this would mean that he would have developed breasts and menstruated; both of these signs are deemed as paradoxical and too worldly for an enlightened Jina, who is meant to have shed all his karmas. The exact gender of Mallinātha is more complicated than this, as all but one Śvetāmbara image - \"The 'Meditating Female,'\" which is a 10th – 11th century image from Uttar Pradesh, actually represents Mallī as an \"asexual being with the absence of the diacritical marks of her sex.\" In terms of Mallinātha's presence in the lives of Jain nuns and laywomen, Sethi observes that very few view Mallinātha as a role model for women, and in the Śvetāmbaras' case, \"her presence in the Tīrthaṅkara pantheon [was] 'an exception and a wonderment'... likely to be never repeated again.\"\n\nAccording to the \"Kalpa-sūtra,\" after the death of the Tīrthaṅkara Mahāvīra, the community that he organized \"contained a body of female ascetics two and half times as large as the number of male ascetics.\" Further, the respected Candanbālā, a Jain female renouncer during the time of Mahāvīra, is said to have led a sangha of 36,000 female ascetics. These annotations highlight the fact that, while there was lively discussion and debate regarding female mendicants, women have been a part of the Jain monastic tradition for a long time. This has continued even unto modern times, where Sethi observes that the number of female ascetics within Jainism is far greater than that of male ascetics. Arguably, given that Jainism offers the possibility of liberation to women, women are seen as \"legitimate aspirants and agents of salvation,\" where in other traditions - such as Hinduism - they may not. Despite the propensity of female ascetics in Jainism, this does not ignore the fact that they may still find themselves within a hierarchical system wherein male ascetics are viewed more positively. This is to say, the Jain monastic hierarchy \"is structured through the gendered ideology of domesticity, with the patriarchal authority, consolidated in the figure of the ācārya/gacchādhipati, presiding over\" the various mendicant orders. Thus, the highest rank of female monastics fails to have the same prestige or recognition as the highest rank of male monastics, the ācārya. Female ācāryas are a theoretical possibility, and two mendicant groups in the 1970s are known to be the exceptional cases where women have been given this status rank.\n\nOne of the consequences of debating whether or not women could be mendicants was an inquiry made by the Jains regarding who was a part of their larger community. To wit, the Jains accepted the pan-Indian idea of a third sex, who existed on the fringes of larger Indian society; however, given that the Jains were investigating whether or not women could become mendicants or attain spiritual liberation, they were simultaneously concerned about what it meant to be a man, woman, or neither/both.\n\nThe Jains rejected the Brahamanical view of gender as indicated by \"the presence or absence of certain primary and secondary characteristics\" and instead, \"revalorized\" the term \"veda\", which referred to both biological sex and sexual feelings. What became important to the Jains was less the features or markers of gender, but rather, sexual behavior itself as seen by one's role in intercourse. This sexual behavior can be focused toward men, women, or both, and it is exactly this bisexual quality of the third sex that was accepted by Śvetāmbara and Digambara Jains. However, the bisexuality of a third-sex sexuality became accepted not as a third-sex identity itself, but rather, a sexuality, that can be possessed by male, female, or third-sex gendered people. Thus, by the 5th century, the Jains distinguished what they viewed as biological sex and psychological gender and sexuality, which allowed the possibility of \"a biological male (\"dravyapuruṣa\") [that] need not necessarily be a male psychologically (\"bhāvapuruṣa\"), that is, endowed with male sexuality, but he may in fact experience female or third-sex sexuality, and the same will be true, mutatis mutandis, for the two other sexes as well.\"\n\nThe third-sex, known as \"napuṃsaka\"s, were an important consideration because there was a social stigma attached to them. As Zwilling and Sweet explain, the fear was that the broader populace would assume things wrongly of Jain mendicants if the \"napuṃsaka\"s were ordained as monks or even if mendicants accepted alms from them. Thus, another reason why it was important to determine who was a part of the third-sex was to enforce monastic conduct and public opinion. However, over time, this ban grew lax, especially if third-sex people were especially well-connected to local people or they were seen as being especially able to control their sexuality.\n\n"}

{"id": "152833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=152833", "title": "Sitting Bull", "text": "Sitting Bull\n\nSitting Bull ( in Standard Lakota orthography, also nicknamed \"Húŋkešni\" or \"Slow\") was a Hunkpapa Lakota leader who led his people during years of resistance to United States government policies. He was killed by Indian agency police on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation during an attempt to arrest him, at a time when authorities feared that he would join the Ghost Dance movement.\n\nBefore the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Sitting Bull had a vision in which he saw many soldiers, \"as thick as grasshoppers,\" falling upside down into the Lakota camp, which his people took as a foreshadowing of a major victory in which a large number of soldiers would be killed. About three weeks later, the confederated Lakota tribes with the Northern Cheyenne defeated the 7th Cavalry under Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer on June 25, 1876, annihilating Custer's battalion and seeming to bear out Sitting Bull's prophetic vision. Sitting Bull's leadership inspired his people to a major victory. In response, the US government sent thousands more soldiers to the area, forcing many of the Lakotas to surrender over the next year. But Sitting Bull refused to surrender, and in May 1877 he led his band north to Wood Mountain, North-Western Territory (now Saskatchewan). He remained there until 1881, at which time he and most of his band returned to US territory and surrendered to U.S. forces.\n\nAfter working as a performer with \"Buffalo Bill's Wild West\" show, Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency in South Dakota. Because of fears that he would use his influence to support the Ghost Dance movement, Indian Service agent James McLaughlin at Fort Yates ordered his arrest. During an ensuing struggle between Sitting Bull's followers and the agency police, Sitting Bull was shot in the side and head by Standing Rock policemen Lieutenant Bull Head (\"Tatankapah\", ) and Red Tomahawk (\"Marcelus Chankpidutah\", ) after the police were fired upon by Sitting Bull's supporters. His body was taken to nearby Fort Yates for burial. In 1953, his Lakota family exhumed what were believed to be his remains, reburying them near Mobridge, South Dakota, near his birthplace.\n\nSitting Bull was born on land later included in the Dakota Territory. In 2007, Sitting Bull's great-grandson asserted from family oral tradition that Sitting Bull was born along the Yellowstone River, south of present-day Miles City, Montana. He was named Jumping Badger at birth, and nicknamed Hunkesi, or \"Slow,\" said to describe his careful and unhurried nature. When the boy was fourteen years old he accompanied a group of Lakota warriors (which included his father and his uncle Four Horns) in a raiding party to take horses from a camp of Crow warriors. Jumping Badger displayed bravery by riding forward and counting coup on one of the surprised Crow, which was witnessed by the other mounted Lakota. Upon returning to camp his father gave a celebratory feast at which he conferred his own name upon his son. The name, Tȟatȟáŋka Íyotake, which in the Lakota language means \"Buffalo Bull Who Sits Down\", would later be abbreviated to \"Sitting Bull\". Thereafter, Sitting Bull's father was known as Jumping Bull. At this ceremony before the entire band, Sitting Bull's father presented his son with an eagle feather to wear in his hair, a warrior's horse, and a hardened buffalo hide shield to mark his son's passage into manhood as a Lakota warrior.\n\nDuring the Dakota War of 1862, in which Sitting Bull's people were not involved, several bands of eastern Dakota people killed an estimated 300 to 800 settlers and soldiers in south-central Minnesota in response to poor treatment by the government and in an effort to drive the whites away. Despite being embroiled in the American Civil War, the United States Army retaliated in 1863 and 1864, even against bands which had not been involved in the hostilities. In 1864, two brigades of about 2200 soldiers under Brigadier General Alfred Sully attacked a village. The defenders were led by Sitting Bull, Gall and Inkpaduta. The Lakota and Dakota were driven out, but skirmishing continued into August.\n\nIn September, Sitting Bull and about one hundred Hunkpapa Lakota encountered a small party near what is now Marmarth, North Dakota. They had been left behind by a wagon train commanded by Captain James L. Fisk to effect some repairs to an overturned wagon. When he led an attack, Sitting Bull was shot in the left hip by a soldier. The bullet exited out through the small of his back, and the wound was not serious.\n\nFrom 1866 to 1868, Red Cloud as a leader of the Oglala Lakota fought against US forces, attacking their forts in an effort to keep control of the Powder River Country of Montana. In support of him, Sitting Bull led numerous war parties against Fort Berthold, Fort Stevenson, and Fort Buford and their environs from 1865 through 1868. Sitting Bull also made guerrilla attacks on emigrant parties and smaller forts throughout the upper Missouri River region.\n\nBy early 1868, the U.S. government desired a peaceful settlement to Red Cloud's War. It agreed to Red Cloud's demands that the US abandon forts Phil Kearny and C.F. Smith. Gall of the Hunkpapa (among other representatives of the Hunkpapa, Blackfeet, and Yankton Dakota) signed a form of the Treaty of Fort Laramie on July 2, 1868 at Fort Rice (near Bismarck, North Dakota). Sitting Bull did not agree to the treaty. He told the Jesuit missionary, Pierre Jean De Smet, who sought him out on behalf of the government: \"I wish all to know that I do not propose to sell any part of my country.\" He continued his hit-and-run attacks on forts in the upper Missouri area throughout the late 1860s and early 1870s.\n\nThe events of 1866–1868 mark a historically debated period of Sitting Bull's life. According to historian Stanley Vestal, who conducted interviews with surviving Hunkpapa in 1930, Sitting Bull was made \"Supreme Chief of the whole Sioux Nation\" at this time. Later historians and ethnologists have refuted this concept of authority, as the Lakota society was highly decentralized. Lakota bands and their elders made individual decisions, including whether to wage war.\n\nSitting Bull's band of Hunkpapa continued to attack migrating parties and forts in the late 1860s. When in 1871 the Northern Pacific Railway conducted a survey for a route across the northern plains directly through Hunkpapa lands, it encountered stiff Lakota resistance. The same railway people returned the following year accompanied by federal troops. Sitting Bull and the Hunkpapa attacked the survey party, which was forced to turn back. In 1873, the military accompaniment for the surveyors was increased again, but Sitting Bull's forces resisted the survey \"most vigorously.\" The Panic of 1873 forced the Northern Pacific Railway's backers (such as Jay Cooke) into bankruptcy. This halted construction of the railroad through Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota territory.\n\nAfter the 1848 finding of gold in the Sierra Nevada and dramatic gains in new wealth from it, other men became interested in the potential for gold mining in the Black Hills. In 1874, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer led a military expedition from Fort Abraham Lincoln near Bismarck, to explore the Black Hills for gold and to determine a suitable location for a military fort in the Hills. Custer's announcement of gold in the Black Hills triggered the Black Hills Gold Rush. Tensions increased between the Lakota and whites seeking to move into the Black Hills.\n\nAlthough Sitting Bull did not attack Custer's expedition in 1874, the US government was increasingly pressured by citizens to open the Black Hills to mining and settlement. Failing in an attempt to negotiate a purchase or lease of the Hills, the government in Washington had to find a way around the promise to protect the Sioux in their land, as specified in the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. It was alarmed at reports of Sioux depredations (encouraged by Sitting Bull). In November 1875, President Grant ordered all Sioux bands outside the Great Sioux Reservation to move onto the reservation, knowing full well that not all would comply. As of February 1, 1876, the Interior Department certified as \"hostile\" those bands who continued to live off the reservation. This certification allowed the military to pursue Sitting Bull and other Lakota bands as \"hostiles\".\n\nBased on tribal oral histories, historian Margot Liberty theorizes many Lakota bands allied with the Cheyenne during the Plains Wars because they thought the other nation was under attack by the US. Given this connection, she suggests the major war should have been called \"The Great Cheyenne War\". Since 1860, the Northern Cheyenne had led several battles among the Plains Indians. Before 1876, the U.S. Army had destroyed seven Cheyenne camps, more than those of any other nation.\n\nOther historians, such as Robert M. Utley and Jerome Greene, also use Lakota oral testimony, but they have concluded that the Lakota coalition, of which Sitting Bull was the ostensible head, was the primary target of the federal government's pacification campaign.\n\nDuring the period 1868–1876, Sitting Bull developed into the most important of Native American political leaders. After the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) and the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation, many traditional Sioux warriors, such as Red Cloud of the Oglala and Spotted Tail of the Brulé, moved to reside permanently on the reservations. They were largely dependent for subsistence on the US Indian agencies. Many other chiefs, including members of Sitting Bull's Hunkpapa band such as Gall, at times lived temporarily at the agencies. They needed the supplies at a time when white encroachment and the depletion of buffalo herds reduced their resources and challenged Native American independence.\n\nIn 1875, the Northern Cheyenne, Hunkpapa, Oglala, Sans Arc, and Minneconjou camped together for a Sun Dance, with both the Cheyenne medicine man White Bull or Ice and Sitting Bull in association. This ceremonial alliance preceded their fighting together in 1876. Sitting Bull had a major revelation.\n\nAt the climactic moment, \"Sitting Bull intoned, 'The Great Spirit has given our enemies to us. We are to destroy them. We do not know who they are. They may be soldiers.' Ice too observed, 'No one then knew who the enemy were – of what tribe.'...They were soon to find out.\"(Utley 1992: 122–24)\n\nSitting Bull's refusal to adopt any dependence on the US government meant that at times he and his small band of warriors lived isolated on the Plains. When Native Americans were threatened by the United States, numerous members from various Sioux bands and other tribes, such as the North Cheyenne, came to Sitting Bull's camp. His reputation for \"strong medicine\" developed as he continued to evade the European Americans.\n\nAfter the January 1st ultimatum of 1876, when the US Army began to track down as hostiles those Sioux and others living off the reservation, Native Americans gathered at Sitting Bull's camp. He took an active role in encouraging this \"unity camp\". He sent scouts to the reservations to recruit warriors, and told the Hunkpapa to share supplies with those Native Americans who joined them. An example of his generosity was Sitting Bull's taking care of Wooden Leg's Northern Cheyenne tribe. They had been impoverished by Captain Reynold's March 17, 1876 attack and fled to Sitting Bull's camp for safety.\n\nOver the course of the first half of 1876, Sitting Bull's camp continually expanded, as natives joined him for safety in numbers. His leadership had attracted warriors and families, creating an extensive village estimated at more than 10,000 people. Lt. Col. Custer came across this large camp on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull did not take a direct military role in the ensuing battle; instead he acted as a spiritual leader. A week prior to the attack, he had performed the Sun Dance, in which he fasted and sacrificed over 100 pieces of flesh from his arms.\n\nCuster's 7th Cavalry advance party attacked Cheyenne and Lakota tribes at their camp on the Little Big Horn River (known as the Greasy Grass River to the Lakota) on June 25, 1876. The U.S. Army did not realize how large the camp was. More than 2,000 Native American warriors had left their reservations to follow Sitting Bull. Inspired by a vision of Sitting Bull's, in which he saw U.S. soldiers being killed as they entered the tribe's camp, the Cheyenne and Lakota fought back. Custer's badly outnumbered troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. The tribes led a counter-attack against the soldiers on a nearby ridge, ultimately annihilating them.\n\nThe Native Americans' victory celebrations were short-lived. Public shock and outrage at Custer's death and defeat, and the government's knowledge about the remaining Sioux, led them to assign thousands more soldiers to the area. Over the next year, the new American military forces pursued the Lakota, forcing many of the Native Americans to surrender. Sitting Bull refused to surrender and in May 1877 led his band across the border into the North-Western Territory, Canada. He remained in exile for four years near Wood Mountain, refusing a pardon and the chance to return. When crossing the border into Canadian territory, Sitting Bull was met by the Mounties of the region. During this meeting, James Morrow Walsh, commander of the North-West Mounted Police, explained to Sitting Bull that the Lakota were now on British soil and must obey British law. Walsh emphasized that he enforced the law equally and that every person in the territory had a right to justice. Walsh became an advocate for Sitting Bull and the two became good friends for the remainder of their lives.\n\nWhile in Canada, Sitting Bull also met with Crowfoot, who was a leader of the Blackfeet, long-time powerful enemies of the Lakota and Cheyenne. Sitting Bull wished to make peace with the Blackfeet Nation and Crowfoot. As an advocate for peace himself, Crowfoot eagerly accepted the tobacco peace offering. Sitting Bull was so impressed by Crowfoot that he named one of his sons after him.\nSitting Bull and his people stayed in Canada for 4 years. Due to the smaller size of the buffalo herds in Canada, Sitting Bull and his men found it difficult to find enough food to feed his people, who were starving and exhausted. Sitting Bull's presence in the country led to increased tensions between the Canadian and the United States governments. Before Sitting Bull left Canada, he may have visited Walsh for a final time and left a ceremonial headdress as a memento.\n\nHunger and desperation eventually forced Sitting Bull, and 186 of his family and followers, to return to the United States and surrender on July 19, 1881. Sitting Bull had his young son Crow Foot surrender his Winchester lever-action carbine to Major David H. Brotherton, commanding officer of Fort Buford, Sitting Bull said to Major David H. Brotherton, \"I wish it to be remembered that I was the last man of my tribe to surrender my rifle.\" To the Oglala Lakotas, Dakotas and Nakota, \"to surrender my rifle\" in this context meant \"We have killed enough white men with your own rifles so I give this rifle back to you, for Tunkasila Wakantanka (Grandfather Great Mystery) will use a different way to help us overcome the white man.\" In the parlor of the Commanding Officer's Quarters in a ceremony the next day, he told the four soldiers, 20 warriors and other guests in the small room that he wished to regard the soldiers and the white race as friends but he wanted to know who would teach his son the new ways of the world. Two weeks later, after waiting in vain for other members of his tribe to follow him from Canada, the Army transferred Sitting Bull and his band to Fort Yates, the military post located adjacent to the Standing Rock Agency. This reservation straddles the present-day boundary between North and South Dakota.\n\nSitting Bull and his band of 186 people were kept separate from the other Hunkpapa gathered at the agency. Army officials were concerned that he would stir up trouble among the recently surrendered northern bands. On August 26, 1881, he was visited by census taker William T. Selwyn, who counted twelve people in the Hunkpapa leader's immediate family. Forty-one families, totaling 195 people, were recorded in Sitting Bull's band.\n\nThe military decided to transfer Sitting Bull and his band to Fort Randall, to be held as prisoners of war. Loaded onto a steamboat, the band of 172 people was sent down the Missouri River to Fort Randall (near present-day Pickstown, South Dakota) on the southern border of the state. There they spent the next 20 months. They were allowed to return north to the Standing Rock Agency in May 1883.\n\nIn 1883, rumors were reported that Sitting Bull had been baptized into the Catholic Church. James McLaughlin, Indian agent at Standing Rock Agency, dismissed these reports, saying that \"The reported baptism of Sitting-Bull is erroneous. There is no immediate prospect of such ceremony so far as I am aware.\"\n\nIn 1884 show promoter Alvaren Allen asked Agent James McLaughlin to allow Sitting Bull to tour parts of Canada and the northern United States. The show was called the \"Sitting Bull Connection.\" It was during this tour that Sitting Bull met Annie Oakley in Minnesota. He was so impressed with Oakley's skills with firearms that he offered $65 (equal to $ today) for a photographer to take a photo of the two together. The admiration and respect was mutual. Oakley stated that Sitting Bull made a \"great pet\" of her. In observing Oakley, Sitting Bull's respect for the young sharpshooter grew. Oakley was quite modest in her attire, deeply respectful of others, and had a remarkable stage persona despite being a woman who stood only five feet in height. Sitting Bull felt that she was \"gifted\" by supernatural means in order to shoot so accurately with both hands. As a result of his esteem, he symbolically \"adopted\" her as a daughter in 1884. He named her \"Little Sure Shot\" – a name that Oakley used throughout her career.\n\nIn 1885, Sitting Bull was allowed to leave the reservation to go Wild Westing with Buffalo Bill Cody's \"Buffalo Bill's Wild West\". He earned about $50 a week (equal to $ today) for riding once around the arena, where he was a popular attraction. Although it is rumored that he cursed his audiences in his native tongue during the show, the historian Utley contends that he did not. Historians have reported that Sitting Bull gave speeches about his desire for education for the young, and reconciling relations between the Sioux and whites. The historian Edward Lazarus wrote that Sitting Bull reportedly cursed his audience in Lakota in 1884, during an opening address celebrating the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway.\n\nSitting Bull stayed with the show for four months before returning home. During that time, audiences considered him a celebrity and romanticized him as a warrior. He earned a small fortune by charging for his autograph and picture, although he often gave his money away to the homeless and beggars.\n\nSitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency after working in \"Buffalo Bill's Wild West\" show. Tension between Sitting Bull and Agent McLaughlin increased and each became more wary of the other over several issues including division and sale of parts of the Great Sioux Reservation.\nDuring that period, in 1889 Indian Rights Activist Caroline Weldon from Brooklyn, New York, a member of the National Indian Defense Association \"NIDA\", reached out to Sitting Bull, acting to be his voice, secretary, interpreter and advocate. She joined him, together with her young son Christy at his compound on the Grand River, sharing with him and his family home and hearth.\nA Paiute Indian, named Wovoka, spread a religious movement from Nevada eastward to the Plains in 1889 that preached a resurrection of the Native. This was a time of severe conditions of harsh winters and long droughts impacting the Sioux Reservation. It was known as the \"Ghost Dance Movement\", because it called on the Indians to dance and chant for the rising up of deceased relatives and return of the buffalo. When the movement reached Standing Rock, Sitting Bull allowed the dancers to gather at his camp. Although he did not appear to participate in the dancing, he was viewed as a key instigator. Alarm spread to nearby white settlements as the Sioux added a new feature to the dance – shirts that were said to stop bullets.\n\nIn 1890, James McLaughlin, the U.S. Indian Agent at Fort Yates on Standing Rock Agency, feared that the Lakota leader was about to flee the reservation with the Ghost Dancers, so he ordered the police to arrest him. On December 14, 1890, McLaughlin drafted a letter to Lt. Henry Bullhead (noted as Bull Head in lead), an Indian agency policeman, that included instructions and a plan to capture Sitting Bull. The plan called for the arrest to take place at dawn on December 15, and advised the use of a light spring wagon to facilitate removal before his followers could rally. Bullhead decided against using the wagon. He intended to have the police officers force Sitting Bull to mount a horse immediately after the arrest.\n\nAround 5:30 a.m. on December 15, 39 police officers and four volunteers approached Sitting Bull's house. They surrounded the house, knocked and entered. Lt. Bull Head told Sitting Bull that he was under arrest and led him outside. Sitting Bull and his wife noisily stalled for time, the camp awakened and men converged at the house. As Lt. Bullhead ordered Sitting Bull to mount a horse, he said the Indian Affairs agent needed to see the chief, and then he could return to his house. When Sitting Bull refused to comply, the police used force on him. The Sioux in the village were enraged. Catch-the-Bear, a Lakota, shouldered his rifle and shot Lt. Bullhead, who reacted by firing his revolver into the chest of Sitting Bull. Another police officer, Red Tomahawk, shot Sitting Bull in the head, and he dropped to the ground. He died between 12 and 1 p.m.\n\nA close-quarters fight erupted, and within minutes several men were dead. The Lakota killed six policemen immediately and two more died shortly after the fight, including Lt. Bullhead. The police killed Sitting Bull and seven of his supporters at the site, along with two horses.\n\nSitting Bull's body was taken to Fort Yates, where it was placed in a coffin (made by the Army carpenter) and buried. A monument was installed to mark his burial site after his remains were reportedly taken to South Dakota.\n\nIn 1953 Lakota family members exhumed what they believed to be Sitting Bull's remains, transporting them for reinterment near Mobridge, South Dakota, his birthplace. A monument to him was erected there.\n\n\nSitting Bull was the subject of, or a featured character in, several Hollywood motion pictures and documentaries, which have reflected changing ideas about him and Lakota culture in relation to the United States. Among them are:\n\nAs time passed, Sitting Bull has become a symbol and archetype of Native American resistance movements as well as a figure celebrated by descendants of his former enemies:\n\nSitting Bull is a major character in Sharon Pollock's play \"Walsh\" (1973), in which he is depicted as a wise and tragic figure during the Lakota nation's time at Fort Walsh in Saskatchewan. The play is sympathetic to the character of Sitting Bull and hostile to the legend of George Armstrong Custer, re-presenting the General from the perspective of Native Americans as a butcher of women and children.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12694418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12694418", "title": "Somapura Mahavihara", "text": "Somapura Mahavihara\n\nSomapura Mahavihara ( \"Shompur Môhabihar\") in Paharpur, Badalgachhi Upazila, Naogaon District, Bangladesh is among the best known Buddhist viharas in the Indian Subcontinent and is one of the most important archaeological sites in the country. It was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985. It dates from a similar time period to the nearby Halud Vihara and to the Sitakot Vihara in Nawabganj Upazila of Dinajpur District.\n\nA number of monasteries grew up during the Pāla period in ancient India in the eastern regions of the Indian subcontinent, comprising Bengal and Magadha. According to Tibetan sources, five great Mahaviharas stood out: Vikramashila, the premier university of the era; Nalanda, past its prime but still illustrious; Somapura Mahavihara; Odantapurā; and Jaggadala. The monasteries formed a network; \"all of them were under state supervision\" and there existed \"a system of co-ordination among them ... it seems from the evidence that the different seats of Buddhist learning that functioned in eastern India under the Pāla were regarded together as forming a network, an interlinked group of institutions,\" and it was common for great scholars to move easily from position to position among them. Xuanzang of China was a noted scholar who resided at the Somapura Mahavihara (the largest monastery in ancient India), and Atisa traveled from Bengal to Tibet to preach Buddhism. The earliest form of the Bengali language began to the emerge during the eighth century.\n\nThe excavation at Paharpur, and the finding of seals bearing the inscription \"Shri-Somapure-Shri-Dharmapaladeva-Mahavihariyarya-bhiksu-sangghasya\", has identified the Somapura Mahavihara as built by the second Pala king Dharmapala (\"circa\" 781–821) of Pāla Dynasty. Tibetan sources, including Tibetan translations of \"Dharmakayavidhi\" and \"Madhyamaka Ratnapradipa\", Taranatha's history and \"Pag-Sam-Jon-Zang\", mention that Dharmapala's successor Devapala (\"circa\" 810–850) built it after his conquest of Varendra. The Paharpur pillar inscription bears the mention of 5th regnal year of Devapala's successor Mahendrapala (\"circa\" 850–854) along with the name of Bhiksu Ajayagarbha. Taranatha's \"Pag Sam Jon Zang\" records that the monastery was repaired during the reign of Mahipala (\"circa\" 995–1043 AD).\n\nThe Nalanda inscription of Vipulashrimitra records that the monastery was destroyed by fire, which also killed Vipulashrimitra's ancestor Karunashrimitra, during a conquest by the Vanga army in the 11th century.\n\nOver time Atisha's spiritual preceptor, Ratnakara Shanti, served as a sthavira of the vihara, Mahapanditacharya Bodhibhadra served as a resident monk, and other scholars spent part of their lives at the monastery, including Kalamahapada, Viryendra and Karunashrimitra. Many Tibetan monks visited the Somapura between the 9th and 12th centuries.\n\nDuring the rule of the Sena dynasty, known as \"Karnatadeshatagata Brahmaksatriya\", in the second half of the 12th century the vihara started to decline for the last time. One scholar writes, \"The ruins of the temple and monasteries at Pāhāpur do not bear any evident marks of large-scale destruction. The downfall of the establishment, by desertion or destruction, must have been sometime in the midst of the widespread unrest and displacement of population consequent on the Muslim invasion.\"\n\nA copperplate dated to 159 Gupta Era (479 AD) discovered in 1927 in the northeast corner of the monastery, mentions donation of a Brahmin couple to Jain Acharya Guhanandi of Pancha-stupa Nikaya at Vata Gohli, identifiable as the neighbouring village of Goalapara\n\nThe quadrangular structure consists of 177 cells and a traditional Buddhist stupa in the centre. The rooms were used by the monks for accommodation and meditation. In addition to the large number of stupas and shrines of various sizes and shapes, terracotta plaques, stone sculptures, inscriptions, coins, ceramics etc. have been discovered.\n\nThe site houses the architectural remains of a vast Buddhist monastery, Somapura Mahavihara, covering . It was an important intellectual centre for Dharmic Traditions such as Buddhists (Buddha Dharma), Jains (Jaina Dharma) and Hindus (Sanatana Dharma) alike. The 21 acre (85,000 m²) complex has 177 cells, viharas, numerous stupas, temples and a number of other ancillary buildings. The outside walls with ornamental terracotta palques still display the influence of these three religions.\n\nIn acreage, Somapura was the largest of the mahaviharas. Its architecture was unusual. As one scholar described, the complex was dominated by a temple, which was not typical, and further, the temple had \"none of the characteristic features of Indian temple architecture, but is strongly reminiscent of Buddhist temples of Burma, Java and Cambodia, reproducing the cruciform basement, terraced structure with inset chambers and gradually dwindling pyramid form ... during the age of the Palas some sort of intercourse between eastern India and south-east Asia existed ... but how this temple type, represented in India by this solitary example, became the standard of Buddhist temple architecture is not known.\" Another commented, \"there can be no doubt that this style of architecture has most profoundly influenced that of Burma, Java and Cambodia. The nearest approximation to the plan and the superstructure of the Paharpur temple is afforded by the temples known as Chandi Loro Jongrang and Chandi Sevu of Prambanam in Central Java.\"\n\nThe purpose of this central structure at the midst of the courtyard remains unsolved since its discovery. Hence, most of the debates generated hitherto on the architecture of Sompur Mahavihara are cantered on the identification its missing superstructure. The reason may be manifold, but the most important one is the non-availability of substantial amount of first-hand resource including a comprehensive architectural documentation at the disposal of the researchers. There are different arguments regarding the terminating top of the central structure of Sompur Mahavihara.\n\nConsequently, most of works done so far are mainly based on the findings of the archaeological excavation and studying the artefacts from the archaeological perspective. The first study on this monument with documentation was by archaeologist K.N. Dikhist in his \"Paharpur, Memoirs of Archaeological Survey in India\" (1938). Dikhsit was concerned with documentation of the archaeological findings and concentrated on their interpretation and analysis. He attempted to suggest a probable architectural treatment of the missing parts of the structure through studying the archaeological remains. Till today, this study is considered as the most authentic record of the Sompur Mahavihara.\n\nPrudence R. Myer published the first of such studies in 1969 as a journal paper, in which he proposed the missing superstructure as a stupa and illustrated the possible three-dimensional articulations. Myer embarked on his proposal through a diachronic study of the stupa and stupa shrines in India. He took Sompur Mahavihara as an example to elaborate his study and did a conjectural restoration of the central structure in support of his analysis.\n\nThe second work was published around thirty years after Myer's proposition. A team of architects from Khulna University led by Mohammed Ali Naqi has proposed another theoretical reconstruction of the central structure as well as some parts of the peripheral block (mainly the entrance hall) in 1999. This work was also presented in the \"International Seminar on Elaboration of an Archaeological Research Strategy for Paharpur World Heritage Site and Its Environment\" jointly organised by UNESCO and Department of Archaeology of Bangladesh in 2004. Muhammad Ali Naqi proposed a temple-like spire at the top by considering the central mound as a 'Stupa-Shrine' with a 'Shikhara' type stupa in his reconstruction.\n\npopular Media By Paharpur Bihar\n\nMany videos Documentary have been Paharpur Bihar, 2016 Eid special Teli film Chader shohor] Onair By Channel i. directed By Razib Hasan Cast By Satabdi owudut, mithila, tarq shopon, full of stories and cinematography of around Paharpur Bihar.\n\nThe statues are reserved in the adjacent museum for display.

An image of Hara-Gouri, a standing naked Jaina and the bronze figures of Kubera and Ganesha were discovered at Paharpur from pre-Bangladesh period excavations. During post-liberation excavation (1981–82 precisely) the torso of a large and important bronze Buddha image was found.\n\nSomapura was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985. Since then, a series of UNESCO missions has regularly visited the site and helped with the project. Moreover, the UN body prepared a master plan, involving US$5.6 million.\n\nThe terracotta artworks in the site have suffered from serious damage as a result of \"lack of proper maintenance, shortage of manpower, fund constraint and heavy rainfall And the major problem is the corruption of Bangladesh.\" Furthermore, poor water drainage accompanied by high levels of salinity in the soils has contributed to decay the terracotta sculptures. Other threats include uncontrolled vegetation, vandalism, climate conditions, and public trespassing and encroachment.\n\n\n"}

The spirit house is normally in the form of small roofed structure, and is mounted on a pillar or on a dais. They can range in size from small platforms to houses large enough for people to enter. Spirit houses are intended to provide a shelter for spirits that could cause problems for the people if not appeased. The shrines often include images or carved statues of people and animals. Votive offerings are left at the house to the spirits. More elaborate installations include an altar for this purpose.\n\nIn Indochina, most houses and businesses have a spirit house placed in an spot, most often in a corner of the property. The location may be chosen after consultation with a Brahmin priest. spirit houses are known as နတ်စင် နတ်ကွန်း in Burmerse; ศาลพระภูมิ (\"san phra phum\", \"house of the guardian spirit\") in Thai; and \"rean tevoda\" (\"place for the tevoda-spirit\") or \"pteah phum\" in Khmer.\n\nIn maritime Southeast Asia, spirit houses are connected to the various traditional animistic rituals involving spirits. In the Philippines, spirit houses are dedicated to ceremonies or offerings involving the \"anito\" spirits. They are known \"magdantang\" in Visayan; \"ulango\" or \"simbahan\" in Tagalog; \"tangpap\", \"pangkew\", or \"alalot\" (for various small roofed altars), and \"balaua\" or \"kalangan\" (for larger structures) in Itneg; \"maligai\" in Subanen; \"tenin\" in Teduray; and \"buis\" (for those built near roads and villages) and \"parabunnian\" (for those built near rice fields) in Bagobo.\n\nIn Thailand, it is a long-standing tradition to leave offerings of food and drink at the spirit house. Rice, bananas, coconuts, and desserts are common offerings. Most ubiquitous is red, strawberry-flavoured Fanta. The idea seems to be that friendly spirits will congregate to enjoy free food and drink and their presence will serve to keep more malign spirits at bay. The popularity of red Fanta offerings has existed for decades. Opinions as to \"why Fanta?\" vary. Most point to the significance of the colour red, reminiscent of animal sacrifice, or perhaps related to the practice of anchoring red incense sticks in a glass of water which promptly tints the water red. Sweetness is explained by the observation that sweet spirits naturally have sweet tooths.\n"}

Attached to the rural community of Ngayokhem, it is located in the area of the pre-colonial Kingdom of Sine, west of Senegal. The population is overrun by the Serers. As of 2006 to 2007, the population was estimated at 3000. Ndokh, which was a colony of Tukar, is now a separate village.\n\nAccording to Serer tradition Tukar was founded by Lamane Jegan Joof (French spelling in Senegal: Lamane Djigan Diouf). There are various versions of the tradition, but the basic story has a hero-migrant, Jegan Joof migrating from Lambaye looking for land to exploit. When he arrived at Tukar, it was nothing more than an inhospitable forest. In accordance with the complex land law system of the Serer people, he was the one who cleared the fields and founded Tukar. His paternal descendants (the Joof family) reigned there for several centuries.\n\nIn 1937, Biram Diouf (English spelling in the Gambia: Biram Joof), a descendant of Lamane Jegan Joof, was short of money and decided to pawn his family's estate (a form of mortgage known in the Serer language as \"taile\") to Waly Sene, the Jaraff of Tukar (representative of the local king). The Joof family of Tukar almost lost their ancestral land. It took 50 years for a great-grandson of Biram Diouf called Djignak Diouf to eventually repay the descendants of Waly Sene and reclaimed his family's estate.\n\nThe name Tukar consists of two Serer words: \"tuuk\" (\"shut up\") and \"kar-kar\" (\"just kidding\"). According to Serer oral tradition, an adventurer by the name of Fassamane Thiaw (or \"Chaw\") paid a visit to Lamane Jegan Joof during the harvest season. Lamane Jegan Joof was to have a very good harvest of millet that year and Fassamane Thiaw is reported to have exclaimed, \"Ooh, you're going have quite bit of millet!\" The Lamane was so surprised he immediately replied: \"Tuuk!\" - which means \"shut up!\" in Serer language. He then ordered Fassamane Thiaw to say \"kar-kar\" (\"just kidding\"). This is said to be the origin of the name Tukar.\n\nAccording to historians, Lamane Jegan Joof had certainly been very shocked by the remark of Fassamane Thiaw about his promising harvest, but, above all, the bad spirits could be listening and decide to take revenge as a result of jealousy and introduce plague or locusts. This ancient superstition still prevails in Senegambia. The Serers and other ethnic groups of Senegambia forbid drawing attention to success or good fortune, because they fear that the bad spirits may become jealous and take revenge. If one mistakenly offers a compliment or comment on someone's good harvest, one is expected to quickly add \"kar-kar\" (just kidding), to ward off bad luck.\n\nThe foundation of Tukar by Jegan Joof is occasionally taught to young children at the local school of Kane Faye. In the Serer religious calendar, the \"Raan festival\" is held in Tukar once a year on the second Thursday after the new moon in April. The Pangool of Tukar of is Lunguñ Joof (or \"Lunguñ Juuf\" in Serer).\n\nFounded in 1986, the Association of Peasants of Tukar (APT) (French: l'Association des Paysans de Tukar) is a rural association that promotes community cohesion and self-sufficiency. However in the mid-2000s, it had some difficulties and a new organization \"Bug Saax Of\" (Serer for \"those who love their town\") was born.\n\n\n"}

In rank, Guangfa Tianzun is seemingly an elite superiorman—even greater than that of Nezha's teacher Taiyi Zhenren.\n\nAfter a fine duel had ensued between Muzha and Nezha and Li Jing attempted his first suicide, Guangfa Tianzun would appear. Once Guangfa Tianzun had ordered Li Jing to enter his cave for safety, he would personally settle things with the \"spoiled brat\" Nezha. Once Nezha's temper raged and he thrust his spear continuously at Guangfa Tianzun, Guangfa Tianzun would side step and throw his legendary Seven Treasure Golden Lotus over Nezha's head. Nezha would lose consciousness quickly following this and would find himself tied to a large gold post while cuffed by golden rings. Soon enough, Guangfa Tianzun would order Jinzha, his student, to flog Nezha. Following the arrival of Nezha's teacher, Taiyi Zhenren, it would be revealed that the whole event between Li Jing and Nezha had been set by Taiyi Zhenren as a chance to teach Nezha some discipline. After Nezha greeted Guangfa Tianzun and his master - who was sitting to Guangfa Tianzun's right - Nezha would have a great level of inner resent.\n\nFollowing the leave of Nezha and Li Jing upon Guangfa Tianzun's order, Guangfa Tianzun would not be seen again for quite some time.\n\n"}

It can refer to Judaism or forms of Orthodox Judaism when used by religious or Orthodox Jews. In a more general sense it has come to mean the \"Jewishness\" or \"Jewish essence\" of Ashkenazi Jews in general and the traditional Yiddish-speaking Jews of Eastern and Central Europe in particular. \n\nFrom a more secular perspective it is associated with the popular culture or folk practices of Yiddish-speaking Jews, such as popular religious traditions, Eastern European Jewish cuisine, Yiddish humour, shtetl life, and klezmer music, among other things. \n\nBefore the Haskalah and the Jewish emancipation in Europe, central to Yiddishkeit were Torah study and Talmudical studies for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. Among Haredi Jews of Eastern European descent, who compose the majority of Jews who still speak Yiddish in their everyday lives, the word has retained this meaning.\n\nBut with secularization, Yiddishkeit has come to encompass not just traditional Jewish religious practice, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and retained their sense of \"Jewishness\". Yiddishkeit has been identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association, in culture and education. Another quality often associated with Yiddishkeit is an emotional attachment and identification with the Jewish people. In these latter exceptions of the term, the most common Latinate spelling is \"yiddishkayt\".\n\n\n"}

Ancient commentary on this passage suggests that those engaging in sodomy could be killed without permission from the dastūr, the high priest.\n\nZoroastrianism has been said to have a \"hatred of male anal intercourse\" that is reflected in at least one mythological tale. When Ahriman, the \"Spirit of Aridity and Death\" and \"Lord of Lies\", sought to destroy the world, he engaged in self-sodomy. That caused an \"explosion of evil power\" and resulted in the birth of a host of evil minions.\n\nApart from the Vendidad, the Pahlavi scriptures, later religious Persian books considered sacred by many Zoroastrians, also strongly forbid sodomy.\n\n"}
