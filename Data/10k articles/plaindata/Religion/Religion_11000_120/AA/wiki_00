The Basel pamphlet of 1566 describes unusual sunrises and sunsets. Celestial phenomena were said to have \"fought\" together in the form of numerous red and black balls in the sky before the rising sun. The report is discussed among historians and meteorologists. The phenomenon has been interpreted by some ufologists to be a sky battle between unidentified flying objects. The leaflet written by historian Samuel Coccius reported it as a religious event. The Basel pamphlet of 1566 is not the only one of its kind. In the 15th and 16th centuries, many leaflets wrote of \"miracles\" and \"sky spectacles\".\n\nThe event is reported to have taken place in Basel, Switzerland in 1566. According to Samuel Coccius, on 27-28 July and 7 August, many local witnesses in Basel reported seeing three celestial phenomena. The first is described as an unusual sunrise, the second as a total eclipse of the moon with a red sun rising, and the third like a cloud of black spheres in front of the sun.\n\nThe text of the broadsheet can be translated as giving the following description of the event:\n"}

Multiple contacts with prominent saints such as Sri Ramana Maharshi, Sri Gnanananda Giri and Sri H.W.L. Poonja, led him to profound advaitic experience as well as to final recognition of the truth of \"advaita\" during the last years of his life.\n\nHenri Le Saux was born on 30 August 1910 in St Briac, a small town on the north coast of Brittany. He was the first child of Alfred Le Saux and Louise Sonnerfaud, who gave him the names Henri Briac Marie. In 1921 his parents sent him to the minor seminary at Châteaugiron, from which in 1925 he went to the major seminary at Rennes. From his boyhood he had felt a monastic vocation: “\"What has drawn me from the beginning and what still leads me on, is the hope of finding there the presence of God more immediately than anywhere else….\"” At the age of 19 he was admitted as a postulant to the Benedictine monastery at Sainte-Anne de Kergonan where he spent another nineteen years (with a short break between the years 1939 and 1941 when he was required to participate in the World War II as a sergeant of the French Army).\n\nThe call to India was heard by Le Saux at Kergonan as early as 1934, within five years of entering the monastery. It was closely related to his vocation to a more radical contemplative life that he lacked within the existing framework of western monasticism. He expressed this feeling in his characteristic phrase that became his motto: “\"Beyond, always beyond.\"” In May 1947 he wrote to the Bishop of Tiruchirappalli, asking his help in “settling somewhere in the neighborhood of Tiruchi so that, living in some hermitage, he might there lead the contemplative life…in the closest possible conformity with the traditions of Indian sannyasa.” The letter was eventually replied by a French priest, Jules Monchanin, who had left for India in 1939 at the age of 44. The latter did his best to help Le Saux in arranging his arrival to India. In his correspondence of 7 August 1947, Monchanin advised his future partner: “Learn as much English as you can. You will have no objection to a purely vegetarian diet (essential for the life of a sannyasi). You will need unshakable courage…complete detachment from the things of the West, and a profound love for India….”\n\nLe Saux arrived to Colombo on 15 August 1948 and a few days later joined Jules Monchanin in Kulittalai (Tamil Nadu). In January 1949 the two seekers visited the ashram of one of the greatest sages of modern India, Sri Ramana Maharshi (1879 – 1950), at the foot of Arunachala mountain in Tiruvannamalai (Tamil Nadu). Le Saux's meeting with the sage had a profound effect on his life as he recounted it in his diary: “I consider this stay at Tiruvannamalai as a real retreat and at the same time as an initiation into Hindu monastic life. I want to…enter into the great silence and peace which, as I have read and also been told, is to be found at the ashram….” The \"darshana\" of Sri Ramana Maharshi became for him the first introduction into the wisdom of \"advaita\": “In the contemporary Sage of Arunachala it was the unique Sage of eternal India that appeared to me… it was a call which pierced through everything, rent it in pieces and opened a mighty abyss.” \n\nIn 1950 Le Saux and Monchanin following their monastic vocation and emerging spiritual ideal, established the Saccidananda Ashram (Shantivanam) on the banks of the holy river Kaveri (Cauvery), with the aim of allowing monks of different traditions to live together in contemplation, sharing the “\"silent communion in the quest of the Unique\"”. In accordance with Indian tradition they adopted new names for themselves: Le Saux became Abhishikteshvarananda (“Bliss of the Anointed Lord”), later shortened to Abhishiktananda, and Monchanin as Parama Arubi Ananda (“Bliss of the Supreme Formless One”). The daily routine in the \"ashram\" was based on the three \"sandhyavandanam-s\" (prayers at the meeting points of day and night and at midday), enriched with Sanskrit and Tamil texts and hymns. Much time was given to spiritual and indological study, although the two monks remained in silence for the greater part of the day.\n\nFrom 1952 to 1955, Abhishiktananda made several visits to the sacred mountain of Arunachala, of which this account can be found in his book \"The Secret of Arunachala\" (published posthumously in 1975). During these visits he experienced lengthy stays in the mountain’s caves, dedicating most of his time to contemplation. In 1953 he met a well known teacher of \"advaita\", Sri H.W.L. Poonja (also known later as \"Papaji\"), who had a deep impact on his spiritual quest. In 1955 in Tirukoilur, his first meeting with the contemporary sage Swami Sri Gnanananda Giri took place: “I could not resist making the great prostration of our Hindu tradition, and to whom I believe I might give myself over completely…. I now know what India means by the term guru….”. Further on Sri Gnanananda became Swamiji’s \"guru\" and his teachings are eloquently described in Swami Abhishiktananda’s publication \"Guru and Disciple\" (1970). Sri Gnanananda’s message was focused on the practice of \"dhyana\" (meditation):\n\nAbhishiktananda’s deep devotion to the \"guru\" is clearly seen in his letters of that period: “Here for a fortnight with my Guru. I have been totally “caught”…. If that man were to ask me tomorrow to set out on the roads naked and silent like Sadasiva Brahmendra, I would be unable to refuse…. In him I have felt the truth of advaita….”\n\nLater in the 1960s, Abhishiktananda commenced regular pilgrimages to Northern India and in 1968 he left Shantivanam forever having passed it to Bede Griffiths OSB Cam (1906–1993) for the ongoing development of the \"ashram\".\n\nIn October 1968, Abhishiktananda settled in a small \"kutiya\" at Gyansu (a kilometre away from Uttarkashi), where he would spend six to eight months in solitude during the years 1969 to 1971. His main purpose was to lead a contemplative life, of which he wrote to a close friend, Odette Baumer-Despeigne: “… To be living here as a rule is going to be a new experience. I can scarcely hope to be that acosmic being of whom I wrote in Gangotri, but at least I might be able to be something of that sort….” During this period he was also participating in a series of interreligious meetings, conferences and study sessions, including participation in the All-India Seminar in Bangalore (15 May–20 June 1969), etc.\n\nHowever, one of the main events of his final years was the meeting with a young Frenchman who later became his one true and prominent disciple, Marc Chaduc. Their correspondence commenced in the late 1960s. In one of his first letters Abhishiktananda, replying to Marc’s questions regarding the possibility of a permanent stay in India, states: “…\"The essential thing is to penetrate the interior mystery to which India bears witness so intensely…. Without a contemplative sense, to come to India is absolutely useless….\"” Chaduc arrived in India on 29 September 1971 at the age of twenty-seven and met Abhishiktananda a few weeks later in Delhi on 21 October. The first ten days spent together in Delhi led to an unparalleled \"guru\"-disciple relationship between the two which brought about a revolutionary change in Abhishiktananda’s life: “I have found in him (Chaduc) a truly total disciple. With him and two young Hindus I experience from the other end what the guru is. It is really the chela (disciple) who makes the guru, and you have to have lived it, in order to grasp this relationship “beyond words….” Abhishiktananda subsequently sent Chaduc on a pilgrimage, including to Sri Ramana’s Ashram and Arunachala, where Abhishiktananda had previously encountered a profound spiritual experience: “There is no question that Arunachala is a powerful magnet. How I should like to lead you round from cave to cave….” During the last twenty months of his life Abhishiktananda’s \"advaitic\" experience deepened and he realizes the truth of the Upanishads with utter clarity: “The mantra Om Tat Sat sings all day long… That madhu (honey) which everything is to everything else, that constant take-off into the Beyond, the golden Purusha full of glory – you know it so well….”\n\nOn 30 June 1973, Abhishiktananda, along with the then President of the Divine Life Society, Swami Chidananda Saraswati, arranged on the banks of the Ganga in Rishikesh, a very simple rite of \"sannyasa-diksha\" (initiation into \"sannyasa\") for Chaduc, after which he became known as Swami Ajatananda Saraswati. Abhishiktananda was deeply moved by this experience which he considered to be the very culmination of his own life. He had a clearer vision of the fact that the truth is not conditioned by any concepts, myths or symbols and lies beyond them all: “We have to descend into the ultimate depths to recognize that there is no common denominator at the level of \"namarupa\" (name and form). So we should accept \"namarupa\" of the most varied kinds…. We should penetrate the depth of each other’s mystery…. Take off from each of them as from a springboard, towards the bottomless ocean….”\n\nHis posthumous book, \"The Further Shore\", which he wrote several months before his \"mahasamadhi\", reflects his last experiences and his disciple Swami Ajatananda draws attention in the book's foreword to the fact that “…nothing that Swamiji wrote had not been lived by him, realized in himself. This is the beauty of his written work, which was the fruit of his silence.” \n\nOn 14 July 1973, Abhishiktananda was struck by a heart attack that he himself described as a “spiritual awakening”. The remaining several months of his life were spent in a state of bliss and realization, expressed by himself in his writings: “O I have found the Grail…. The quest for the Grail is basically nothing else than the quest for the Self…. It is yourself that you are seeking through everything. And in this quest you are running about everywhere, whereas the Grail is here, close at hand, you only have to open your eyes…. There is only the Awakening.”\n\nIn the evening of 7 December 1973 in Indore, Abhishiktananda underwent another brief heart attack and at about 11 pm he died. His last words were “God’s will be done.”\n\nIn order to foster the message and the writings of Abhishiktananda through the publication of his books and unpublished manuscripts, Raimon Panikkar, Patrick D'Souza, Jacques Dupuis, Sita Ram Goel, Ram Swarup, N. Shanta and James Stuart, founded the Abhishiktananda Society (Delhi) in 1978. The society was dissolved in 2008 after thirty years of contribution to Hindu-Christian dialogue and the publishing rights for his books in English and various Indian languages, were transferred to the Delhi Brotherhood Society (DBS). As a result, a new section named the Abhishiktananda Centre for Interreligious Dialogue, was formed to carry on the task of promoting Abhishiktananda's writings in India and abroad in English. This work is also being continued in the West by the Monastic Interreligious Dialogue (DIMMID), which holds the world rights in all languages with the exception of the English and Indian languages. This centre also stores the Abhishiktananda Archives, where handwritten or typed manuscripts written by Abhishiktananda date between approximately forty to sixty-three years of age. It is planned to digitally scan the archives and make them available under specific conditions for scholars and researchers in India and abroad.\n\n\"Saccidananda: A Christian Approach to Advaitic Experience\", Delhi, ISPCK, 1974.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Between 1942 and 1947 he acted as reviewer of mostly mystery fiction for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\". In addition to \"Anthony Boucher\", White also employed the pseudonym \"H. H. Holmes\", which was the pseudonym of a late-19th-century American serial killer; Boucher would also write light verse and sign it \"Herman W. Mudgett\" (another of the murderer's aliases).\n\nIn a 1981 poll of 17 detective story writers and reviewers, his novel \"Nine Times Nine\" was voted as the ninth best locked room mystery of all time.\n\nWhite was born in Oakland, California, and went to college at the University of Southern California. He later received a master's degree from the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nAfter a friend told him that \"William White\" was too common a name, he used \"H. H. Holmes\" to write and review mysteries and \"Anthony Boucher\" for science fiction. He pronounced \"Boucher\" phonetically, \"to rhyme with voucher\".\n\nBoucher (as he was more commonly known) wrote mystery, science fiction, and horror writing. He was also an editor, including science fiction anthologies, and wrote mystery reviews for many years in \"The New York Times\". He was one of the first English translators of Jorge Luis Borges, translating \"The Garden of Forking Paths\" for \"Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine\". He helped found the Mystery Writers of America in 1946 and, in the same year, was one of the first winners of the MWA's Edgar Award for his mystery reviews in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\". He was a founding editor (with J. Francis McComas) of \"The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\" from 1949 to 1958, and attempted to make literary quality an important aspect of science fiction. He won the Hugo Award for Best Professional Magazine in 1957 and 1958. Boucher also edited the long-running \"Best from Fantasy and Science Fiction\" anthology series, from 1952 to 1959.\n\nAmong Boucher's critical writing was also contributing annual summaries of the state of speculative fiction for Judith Merril's \"The Year's Best SF\" series; as editor, he published the volumes in E. P. Dutton's \"The Best Detective Stories of the Year\" annual volumes published in 1963-1968, succeeding Brett Halliday and followed, after his death, by Allen J. Hubin in that task.\n\nBoucher wrote short stories for many fiction magazines in America, including \n\"Adventure\", \"Astounding\", \"Black Mask\",\n\"Ed McBain's Mystery Book\", \"Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine\", \"Galaxy Science Fiction\", \"The Master Detective\", \"Unknown Worlds\" and \"Weird Tales\".\n\nHis short story \"The Quest for Saint Aquin\" was among the stories selected in 1970 by the Science Fiction Writers of America as one of the best science fiction short stories of all time. As such, it was published in \"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 1929–1964\".\n\nBoucher was the friend and mentor of science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick and others. His 1942 novel \"Rocket to the Morgue\", in addition to being a classic locked room mystery, is also something of a \"roman à clef\" about the Southern California science fiction culture of the time, featuring thinly veiled versions of personalities such as Robert A. Heinlein, L. Ron Hubbard and rocket scientist/occultist/fan Jack Parsons.\n\nBoucher also scripted for radio and was involved in many other activities, as described by William F. Nolan in his essay \"Who Was Anthony Boucher?\":\nWith respect to his scripting of the Sherlock Holmes radio dramas, Nigel Bruce, who played Dr. Watson, said that Boucher \"had a sound knowledge of Conan Doyle and a great affection for the two characters of Holmes and Watson.\"\n\nBoucher left dramatic radio in 1948, \"mainly because I was putting in a lot of hours working with J. Francis McComas in creating what soon became \"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\". We got it off the ground in 1949 and saw it take hold solidly by 1950. This was a major creative challenge and although I was involved in a lot of other projects, I stayed with \"F&SF\" into 1958.\"\n\nThroughout his years with the magazine, Boucher was involved in many other projects. He wrote fiction for the SF and mystery markets (primarily short stories). He taught an informal writing class from his home in Berkeley. He continued his Sunday mystery columns for the \"New York Times Book Review\", while also writing crime-fiction reviews for \"The New York Herald Tribune\" as Holmes (he also reviewed SF and fantasy (as H. H. Holmes) for the \"Herald Tribune\") and functioning as chief critic for \"Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine\". He edited \"True Crime Detective\", supervised the Mercury Mystery Line and (later) the Dell Great Mystery Library; hosted \"Golden Voices\", his series of historical opera recordings for Pacifica Radio, and served (in 1951) as president of Mystery Writers of America.\n\nAs part of his reviews of mystery novels, he published a list of Best Crime Fiction of the Year from 1949 to 1967, listing from 12 to 15 titles each year. He published his list as Anthony Boucher.\n\nBoucher was a devoted poker player, a political activist, a rabid sport fan (football, basketball, track, gymnastics and rugby), an active Sherlockian in The Baker Street Irregulars and a spirited chef.\n\nIn the years 1964-65 Boucher worked as a story consultant for the Kraft Suspense Theatre.\n\nBoucher died of lung cancer on April 29, 1968, at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Oakland.\n\nBouchercon, the \"Anthony Boucher Memorial World Mystery Convention,\" was named in his honor.

{"id": "99563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99563", "title": "Asura", "text": "Asura\n\nAsuras () are a class of divine beings or power-seeking deities related to the more benevolent Devas (also known as Suras) in Hindu mythology. \n\nAsuras are sometimes considered nature spirits. They battle constantly with the devas. Asuras are described in Indian texts as powerful superhuman demigods with good or bad qualities. The good Asuras are called \"Adityas\" and are led by Varuna, while the malevolent ones are called \"Danavas\" and are led by Vritra. \nIn the earliest layer of Vedic texts Agni, Indra and other gods are also called Asuras, in the sense of them being \"lords\" of their respective domains, knowledge and abilities. In later Vedic and post-Vedic texts, the benevolent gods are called \"Devas\", while malevolent Asuras compete against these Devas and are considered \"enemy of the gods\".\n\nAsuras are part of Indian mythology along with Devas, Yakshas (nature spirits) and Rakshasas (ghosts, ogres). Asuras feature in one of many cosmological theories in Hinduism.\n\nMonier-Williams traces the etymological roots of \"Asura\" (असुर) to \"Asu\" (असु), which means life of the spiritual world or departed spirits. In the oldest verses of the Samhita layer of Vedic texts, the \"Asuras\" are any spiritual, divine beings including those with good or bad intentions, and constructive or destructive inclinations or nature. In later verses of the Samhita layer of Vedic texts, Monier Williams states the \"Asuras\" are \"evil spirits, demons and opponents of the gods\". Asuras connote the chaos-creating evil, in Hindu and Persian (collectively, Aryan) mythology about the battle between good and evil.\n\nBhargava states the word, Asura, including its variants, asurya and asura, occurs \"88 times in the Rigveda, 71 times in the singular number, four times in the dual, 10 times in the plural, and three times as the first member of a compound. In this, the feminine form, asuryaa, is included twice. The word, asurya, has been used 19 times as an abstract noun, while the abstract form asuratva occurs 24 times, 22 times in each of the 22 times of one hymn and twice in the other two hymns\".\n\nAsura is used as an adjective meaning \"powerful\" or \"mighty\". In the Rigveda, two generous kings, as well as some priests, have been described as asuras. One hymn requests a son who is an asura. In nine hymns, Indra is described as asura. Five times, he is said to possess asurya, and once he is said to possess asuratva. Agni has total of 12 asura descriptions, Varuna has 10, Mitra has eight, and Rudra has six. Bhargava gives a count of the word usage for every Vedic deity. The Book 1 of Rig Veda describes Savitr (Vedic solar deity) as an Asura who is a \"kind leader\".\n\nIn later texts, such as the Puranas and the Itihasas with the embedded Bhagavad Gita, the Devas represent the good, and the Asuras the bad. According to the Bhagavad Gita (16.6-16.7), all beings in the universe have both the divine qualities (\"daivi sampad\") and the demonic qualities (\"asuri sampad\") within each. The sixteenth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita states that pure god-like saints are rare and pure demon-like evil are rare among human beings, and the bulk of humanity is multi-charactered with a few or many faults. According to Jeaneane Fowler, the Gita states that desires, aversions, greed, needs, emotions in various forms \"are facets of ordinary lives\", and it is only when they turn to lust, hate, cravings, arrogance, conceit, anger, harshness, hypocrisy, cruelty and such negativity- and destruction-inclined that natural human inclinations metamorphose into something demonic (Asura).\n\nAsko Parpola traces the etymological root of \"Asura\" to *asera- of Uralic languages, where it means \"lord, prince\".\n\nScholars have disagreed on the nature and evolution of the \"Asura\" concept in ancient Indian literature. The most widely studied scholarly views on \"Asura\" concept are those of FBJ Kuiper, W Norman Brown, Haug, von Bradke, Otto, Benveniste, Konow, Rajwade, Dandekar, Darmesteter, Bhandarkar and Raja, Banerji-Sastri, Padmanabhayya, Skoeld, SC Roy, kumaraswamy, Shamasastry, Przyluski, Schroeder, Burrows, Hillebrandt, Taraporewala, Lommel, Fausboll, Segerstedt, Thieme, Gerschevitch, Boyce, Macdonnell, Hermann Oldenberg, Geldner, Venkatesvaran, and Jan Gonda.\n\nKuiper calls \"Asuras\" a special group of gods in one of major Vedic theories of creation of the universe. Their role changes only during and after the earth, sky and living beings have been created. The sky world becomes that of \"Devas\", the underworld becomes that of \"Asuras\". Deity Indra is the protagonist of the good and the Devas, while dragon Vrtra who is also one of asuras is the protagonist of the evil. During this battle between good and evil, creation and destruction, some powerful Asuras side with the good and are called Devas, other powerful Asuras side with the evil and thereafter called Asuras. This is the first major dualism to emerge in the nature of everything in the Universe. Hale, in his review, states that Kuiper theory on Asura is plausible but weak because the Vedas never call Vrtra (the central character) an Asura as the texts describe many other powerful beings. Secondly, Rigveda never classifies Asura as \"group of gods\" states Hale, and this is a presumption of Kuiper.\n\nMany scholars describe Asuras to be \"lords\" with different specialized knowledge, magical powers and special abilities, which only later choose to deploy these for good, constructive reasons or for evil, destructive reasons. The former become known as Asura in the sense of \"Devas\", the later as Asura in the sense of demons. Kuiper, Brown, Otto and others are in this school; however, none of them provide an explanation and how, when and why Asura came ultimately to mean demon. Asuras are non-believers of god and believed in their own powers.\n\nAnanda Coomaraswamy suggested that Devas and Asuras can be best understood as Angels-Theoi-Gods and Titans of Greek mythology, both are powerful but have different orientations and inclinations, the Devas representing the powers of Light and the Asuras representing the powers of Darkness in Hindu mythology. According to Coomaraswamy, \"the Titan [Asura] is potentially an Angel [Deva], the Angel still by nature a Titan\" in Hinduism.\n\nIn the 19th century, Haug pioneered the idea that the term \"Asura\" is linguistically related to the Ahuras of Indo-Iranian people and pre-Zoroastrianism era. In both religions, Ahura of pre-Zoroastrianism (Asura of Hinduism), Vouruna (Varuna) and Daeva (Deva) are found, but their roles are on opposite sides. That is, Ahura evolves to represent the good in pre-Zoroastrianism, while Asura evolves to represent the bad in Vedic religion, while Daeva evolves to represent the bad in pre-Zoroastrianism, while Deva evolves to represent the good in Vedic religion. This contrasting roles have led some scholars to deduce that there may have been wars in proto-Indo-European communities, and their gods and demons evolved to reflect their differences. This idea was thoroughly researched and reviewed by Peter von Bradke in 1885.\n\nThe relationship between \"ahura\"s/\"asura\"s and \"daeva\"s/\"deva\"s in Indo-Iranian times, was discussed at length by F.B.J. Kuiper. This theory and other Avesta/Assyrian-driven hypotheses developed over the 20th century, are all now questioned particularly for lack of archaeological evidence. Asko Parpola has re-opened this debate by presenting archaeological and linguistic evidence, but notes that the links may go earlier to Uralic languages roots.\n\nSome scholars such as Asko Parpola suggest that the word \"Asura\" may be related to proto-Uralic and proto-Germanic history. The Aesir-Asura correspondence is the relation between Vedic Sanskrit \"Asura\" and Old Norse \"Æsir\" and Proto-Uralic *\"asera\", all of which mean 'lord, powerful spirit, god'. Parpola states that the correspondence extends beyond Asera-Asura, and extends to a host of parallels such as Inmar-Indra, Sampas-Stambha and many other elements of respective mythologies.\n\nIn the earliest Vedic literature, all supernatural beings are called Devas and Asuras.. A much studied hymn of the Rigveda states \"Devav asura\" (Asuras who have become Devas), and contrasts it with \"Asura adevah\" (Asuras who are not Devas). Each Asura and Deva emerges from the same father (\"Prajapati\"), share the same residence (\"Loka\"), eat together the same food and drinks (\"Soma\"), and have innate potential, knowledge and special powers in Hindu mythology; the only thing that distinguishes \"Asura who become Deva\" from \"Asura who remain Asura\" is intent, action and choices they make in their mythic lives.\n\n\"Asuras who remain Asura\" share the character of powerful beings obsessed with their craving for ill-gotten \"Soma\" and wealth, ego, anger, unprincipled nature, force and violence. Further, when they lose, miss or don't get what they want because they were distracted by their cravings, the \"Asuras who remain Asuras\" question, challenge and attack the \"\"Asuras who become Devas\" to loot and get a share from what Devas have and they don't, in Hindu mythology. The hostility between the two is the source of extensive legends, tales and literature in Hinduism; however, many texts discuss their hostility in neutral terms and without explicit moral connotations or condemnation. Some of these tales are the basis behind major Hindu Epics and annual festivals, such as the story of Asura Ravana and Deva Rama in the Ramayana and the legend of Asura Hiranyakashipu and Deva Vishnu as Narasimha, the latter celebrated with the Hindu spring festival of Holika and Holi.\n\nEdelmann and other scholars state that the dualistic concept of Asura and Deva in Hinduism is a form of symbolism found throughout its ancient and medieval literature. In the Upanishads, for example, Devas and Asuras go to Prajāpati to understand what is Self (Atman, soul) and how to realize it. The first answer that Prajāpati gives is simplistic, which the Asuras accept and leave with, but the Devas led by Indra do not accept and question because Indra finds that he hasn't grasped its full significance and the given answer has inconsistencies. Edelmann states that this symbolism embedded in the Upanishads is a reminder that one must struggle with presented ideas, learning is a process, and Deva nature emerges with effort. Similar dichotomies are present in the Puranas literature of Hinduism, where god Indra (a Deva) and the antigod Virocana (an Asura) question a sage for insights into the knowledge of the self. Virocana leaves with the first given answer, believing now he can use the knowledge as a weapon. In contrast, Indra keeps pressing the sage, churning the ideas, and learning about means to inner happiness and power. Edelmann suggests that the Deva-Asura dichotomies in Hindu mythology may be seen as \"narrative depictions of tendencies within our selves\".\n\nThe god (Deva) and antigod (Asura), states Edelmann, are also symbolically the contradictory forces that motivate each individual and people, and thus Deva-Asura dichotomy is a spiritual concept rather than mere genealogical category or species of being. In the Bhāgavata Purana, saints and gods are born in families of Asuras, such as Mahabali and Prahlada, conveying the symbolism that motivations, beliefs and actions rather than one's birth and family circumstances define whether one is Deva-like or Asura-like.\n\nAsuri is the feminine of an adjective from asura and in later texts means \"belonging to or having to do with demons and spirits\". Asuri parallels Asura in being \"powerful beings\", and in early Vedic texts includes all goddesses. The term Asuri also means a Rakshasi in Indian texts.\n\nThe powers of an Asuri are projected into plants offering a remedy against leprosy.\n\nIn Book 7, \"Asuri\" is a powerful female with the special knowledge of herbs, who uses that knowledge to seduce Deva Indra in Atharva Veda. A hymn invokes this special power in \"Asuri\", and this hymn is stipulated for a woman as a charm to win over the lover she wants.\n\nSimilarly, in the Atharva Veda, all sorts of medical remedies and charms are projected as Asuri manifested in plants and animals. Asuri Kalpa is an \"abhichara\" (craft) which contains various rites derived from special knowledge and magic of Asuri.\n\nAccording to the Vishnu Purana, during the Samudra manthan or \"churning of the ocean\", the daityas came to be known as \"asuras\" because they rejected Varuni, the goddess of \"sura\" \"wine\", while the devas accepted her and came to be known as suras.\n\nAlain Daniélou states that Asuras were initially good, virtuous and powerful in Indian mythology. However, their nature gradually changed and they came to represent evil, vice and abuse of power. In Shiva Purana, they evolved into anti-gods and had to be destroyed because they threatened the gods.\n\nThe asuras (anti-gods) were depicted to have become proud, vain, to have stopped performing sacrifices, to violate sacred laws, not visit holy places, not cleanse themselves from sin, to be envious of devas, torturous of living beings, creating confusion in everything and challenging the devas.\n\nAlain Daniélou states that the concept of \"asuras\" evolved with changing socio-political dynamics in ancient India. Asuras gradually assimilated the demons, spirits, and ghosts worshipped by the enemies of Vedic people, and this created the myths of the malevolent \"asuras\" and the \"rakshasa\". The allusions to the disastrous wars between the \"asuras\" and the \"suras\", found in the Puranas and the epics, may be the conflict faced by people and migrants into ancient India.\n\nAsuras (Tib: \"lha ma yin\", Chi: \"Axiuluo\", Jap: \"Ashura\") are a type of supernatural being (anti-gods, demigods or non-god titans) in traditional Buddhist cosmology and a realm of rebirth based on one's karma in current or past lives. They are described in Buddhist texts as creatures who live in lower levels of mount Sumeru, obsessed with sensuous aspects of existence, living with jealousy and endlessly engaged in wars against the creatures who are \"Devas\" (gods). As Buddhism spread into East Asia, the Asura concept of Indian Buddhism expanded and integrated local pre-existing deities as a part of regional Buddhist pantheon.\n\n\n"}

The first Bahá'ís arrived in Niger in 1966 and the growth of the religion reached the point of the election of its National Spiritual Assembly in 1975. Following a period of oppression, making the institutions of the Bahá'í Faith illegal in the late 1970s and '80s, the National Assembly was re-elected starting in 1992. The Bahá'í community in Niger has grown mostly in the south-west of the country where they number in the low thousands. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 5,600 Bahá'ís in 2005.\n\nDuring the late colonial period of French West Africa the Bahá'í Faith entered the region in 1953. Wide scale growth in the religion across Sub-Saharan Africa was observed to begin in the 1950s and extend in the 1960s. There were over 1000 Bahá'ís across North-West Africa resulting in a regional National Spiritual Assembly including French West Africa in 1956. Following the death of Shoghi Effendi, the elected Universal House of Justice was head of the religion and began to re-organized the Bahá'í communities of Africa by splitting off national communities to form their own National Assemblies from 1967 though the 1990s. Following the independence of Niger in 1960, the first pioneers arrived in Niger in 1966. From January to March 1970 Hand of the Cause Rúhíyyih Khanum crossed Africa from east to west visiting many country's communities including Niger, meeting with individuals and institutions both Bahá'í and civic.\n\nThe National Spiritual Assembly of Niger, splitting off from the North West African Assembly, was elected in 1975.\n\nAs part of a sweep across several Sub-Saharan countries, the Bahá'í Faith was banned in the 1970s in Burundi (1974), Mali (1976), Uganda (1977), Congo (1978) and Niger in 1978, during the government established by the military coup of Seyni Kountché.)\n\n\"This was principally the result of a campaign by a number of Arab countries. Since these countries were also by this time providers of development aid, this overt attack on the Baha'is was supported by covert moves such as linking the aid money to a particular country to the action that it took against the Baha'is. This was partially successful and a number of countries did ban the Baha'is for a time. However, the Baha'is were able to demonstrate to these governments that they were not agents of Zionism nor anti-Islamic and succeeded in having the ban reversed in all of these countries except Niger.\" The Nigerien government made changes by instituting a multi-party democratic system called for by union and student demands. Following this there was a waning of military coup successor Col. Ali Saibou's power and widespread changes in laws. In 1991, all legal restrictions of the Bahá'í Faith had been ended. though political instability persisted. The National Spiritual Assembly was elected again at Niger's Bahá'í Convention in 1992.\n\nSince its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. The Nigerian community has participated in literacy project initiatives.\n\nThe Bahá'ís of Niger number a few thousand and are located primarily in Niamey and on the west side of the Niger River bordering Burkina Faso. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia) estimated some 5,600 Bahá'ís in 2005.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22405036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22405036", "title": "Bahá'í Faith in Pakistan", "text": "Bahá'í Faith in Pakistan\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith in Pakistan begins previous to its independence when it was part of India. The roots of the Bahá'í Faith in the region go back to the first days of the Bábí religion in 1844, with Shaykh Sa'id Hindi who was from Multan. During Bahá'u'lláh's lifetime, as founder of the religion, he encouraged some of his followers to move to the area that is current-day Pakistan.\n\nIn 1921 the Bahá'ís of Karachi elected their first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly. In 1923, still as part of India, a regional National Spiritual Assembly was formed for all India and Burma which then included the area now part of Pakistan. By 1956 Bahá'í local assemblies spread across many cities, and in 1957, East and West Pakistan elected a separate National Bahá'í Assembly from India and later East Pakistan became Bangladesh with its own national assembly. Waves of refugees arrived in 1979 due to the Soviet Union invasion of Afghanistan and the Iranian Revolution in Iran.\n\nThe Bahá'ís in Pakistan have the right to hold public meetings, establish academic centers, teach their faith, and elect their administrative councils. However, the government prohibits Bahá'ís from travelling to Israel for Bahá'í pilgrimage. \n\nThe roots of the Bahá'í Faith in the region go back to the first days of the Bábí religion in 1844. Four Babis are known from India in this earliest period — it is not known from what sub-region most of them came from but at least some of them were known as Sufis and some termed Sayyid. The first was Shaykh Sa'id Hindi — one of the Letters of the Living who was from Multan then in India. Basir-i-Hindi was a member of the Jalalia sect who also converted in this early period from the region which later became Pakistan. After embracing the Babí religion, Hindi set out to Iran but learned that the Báb had been confined to the hills of Azerbaijan and made his way to Fort Tabarsi where he was one of four Indians listed among the 318 Bábís who fought at the Battle of Fort Tabarsi. After that he went to Nur and met Bahá'u'lláh and later moved to Luristan where he worked in the court of the governor of Luristan, Yaldram Mirza. When the governor learned he was a Babí he was killed.\n\nDuring Bahá'u'lláh's lifetime, as founder of the Bahá'í Faith, he encouraged some of his followers to move to India. After first visiting Mumbai, India, Jamal Effendi visited Karachi in 1875 on one of his trips to parts of Southern Asia. His trips included Lahore, Sialkot, Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh. Following the passing of Bahá'u'lláh, the leadership of the religion fell to `Abdu'l-Bahá and he in turn sent further representatives to the region — followers who travelled to the region included both Persians and Americans and included Sydney Sprague and Mirza Mahmood Zarghaní.\n\nOn instructions from `Abdu'l-Bahá, Zarghaní stayed in Lahore for most of 1904 and subsequently travelled to nearby regions. During his stay Zarghaní became acquainted with Muhammad Iqbal. There is information that an American Bahá'í was in Lahore about 1905; little is known except that he became sick with cholera but recovered under care from a Bahá'í, Mr. Kaikhosru, who came from (then named) Bombay to nurse him but himself died of the disease.\n\nThe first Bahá'í to settle in current-day Pakistan may have been Muhammad Raza Shirazi who became a Bahá'í in Bombay in 1908 and settled in Karachi. As early as 1910 the national community in India/Burma was being urged to visibly distinguish itself from Islam by the Bahá'í institutions of America. Jamshed Jamshedi moved from Iran to Karachi in 1917 and Mirza Qalich Beg translated the Hidden Words into Sindhi. National coordinated activities across India began and reached a peak with the first All-India Bahá'í Convention which occurred in Mumbai for three days in December 1920. Representatives from India's major religious communities were present as well as Bahá'í delegates from throughout the country. In 1921 the Bahá'ís of Karachi elected their first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly.\n\nIn 1923, while what is now Pakistan was part of British India, a regional National Spiritual Assembly was formed for India and Burma - which then included the area now part of Pakistan. Martha Root, an American Bahá'í, visited Karachi and Lahore in 1930 and again in 1938 when she stayed for three months and supervised the publication of her book titled \"Tahirih — the Pure\". She died about a year later. The Bahá'ís of Karachi obtained land for a cemetery in 1931. Mirza Tarazullah Samandari, later appointed as a Hand of the Cause — a distinguished rank in the religion —, visited the area several times; he first visited the region in 1930, and then again in 1963, 1964, 1966, and in 1993 travelling to many cities. From 1931 to 1933, Professor Pritam Singh, the first Bahá'í from a Sikh background, settled in Lahore and published an English language weekly called \"The Baha’i Weekly\" and other initiatives. A \"Bahá'í publishing committee\" was established in Karachi in 1935. This body evolved and is registered as the \"Baha’i Publishing Trust\" of Pakistan. In 1937, John Esslemont's \"Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era\" was translated into Urdu and Gujarati in Karachi. The Committee also published scores of Bahá'í books and leaflets in Urdu, English, Arabic, Persian, Sindhi, Pushtu, Balochi, Gojri, Balti and Punjabi and memorials including those marking the centenaries of the declaration of the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh.\n\nThe Local Spiritual Assembly of Quetta was formed in 1943 by Bahá'ís from Mumbai and Iran while the Local Spiritual Assembly of Hyderabad was also formed in 1943 by Bahá'ís from Karachi. A spiritual assembly was elected for the first time in Jammu in 1946. Bahá'ís from Karachi were among those to help elect the local spiritual assemblies in Sukkur and Rawalpindi in 1948. Further local assemblies were formed in Sialkot in 1949, Multan, Chittagong, and Dhaka in 1950, Faisalabad in 1952, Sargodha in 1955, and Abbottabad, Gujranwala, Jahanabad, Mirpurkhas, Nawabshah, and Sahiwal by 1956 thus raising the number of local spiritual assemblies to 20. Hand of the Cause Dorothy Beecher Baker spoke at a variety of events in India extending her stay twice to speak at schools – her last public talk was in Karachi in early 1954. Meanwhile, a Muslim émigré from near Lahore, Fazel (Frank) Khan, moved to Australia where he was asked to present the teachings of Islam at a Bahá'í school and was so affected by the class that he and his family converted to the Bahá'í Faith in 1947. On two later occasions Fazel visited his home village and endeavoured to teach them his new religion. On the first visit there was no response, but during the second visit a cousin converted in the town of Sialkot. On the other hand, a fatwa was issued in Sialkot against the Bahá'ís.\n\nPlans for an independent national assembly for Pakistan began as early as spring 1954. A regional convention in Karachi in 1956 had 17 delegates. With independence from India proceeding, the Bahá'ís of East and West Pakistan elected a separate Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly from India in 1957, witnessed by Hand of the Cause Shu'á'u'llah 'Alá'í. The Bahá'ís elected to this first national assembly included Isfandiar Bakhtiari, Chaudhri Abdur Rehman, Faridoon Yazameidi, A.C. Joshi, M.H. IImi, Abdul Abbas Rizvi, M.A. Latif, Nawazish Ali Shah, and Mehboob Iiahi Qureshi. Joshi in particular was then the Chairman of the national assembly and had been elected to assemblies since 1947 and eventually in other institutions. The new national assembly saw to the publishing of a history of the Bahá'í Faith in Pakistan in 1957. In 1960 when Mason Remey made his unsuccessful claims for leadership, a small group of Bahá'ís in Pakistan accepted his claims and published some materials from 1965 through 1972 but have not been active since then. This \"Hereditary\" group never formed a significant group around the world. In 1961 the national assembly held a reception to honor the dedication of the Bahá'í House of Worship in Australia by inviting Australian and other diplomats as well as judges of Pakistani courts, business leaders and college professors while the local assembly of Sukkur hosted a regional summer school. In 1962 one was hosted by the local assembly of Quetta. In 1963 the Universal House of Justice, the international governing body of the Bahá'ís, was elected and all nine members of the Pakistani National Spiritual Assembly participated in the voting. In 1964 Hand of the Cause Tarázu'lláh Samandari visited Bahá'ís and social leaders in Dacca, East Pakistan at the time. From 1946 through the 1980s the Bahá'í publishing trust published a variety of works oriented to youth.\n\nSince its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. In Pakistan 1967 was a year of multiplying activities. The Bahá'í youth of Karachi sponsored a youth symposium on world peace, the community at large elected a woman to the national assembly, for the first time elected a local assembly in Rahim Yar Khan, and held a reception for a Bahá'í from the Sokoine University of Agriculture in Morogoro with guests including executive engineers, attorneys, businessmen and industrialists, doctors, press representatives, bankers and university students. In 1972 the assembly of Karachi held an observance of United Nations Day which over one hundred people attended. Talks presented dealt with the elimination of racial discrimination. Also in 1972 the government of Pakistan invited the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís to send a delegate to participate in a Conference of the Religious Minorities. By 1974 there were Bahá'ís that were members of the Bhil tribe in Thatta. In 1975 Bahá'ís held meetings for the International Women's Year and a seminar on \"Education in Pakistan.\" In 1976 Bahá'ís were invited to participate in a week long celebration of minorities. Later Bahá'ís and non-Bahá'ís gathered to commemorate Letter of the Living Táhirih and a Bahá'í was acknowledged as part of the delegation from Pakistan to an Asian conference on religion and peace by the chief Muslim delegate late in the conference. In 1977 membership of the Bahá'ís reached the state of Kalat and Tharparkar. The 1977 winter school gathered 250 Bahá'ís while 1978's gathered 350. In 1978 conditions in Afghanistan, including the Soviet invasion, lead to many Afghan Bahá'ís being arrested in that country and many fled to Pakistan. Iranian Bahá'ís also fled to Pakistan from Iran in 1979 due to the Iranian Revolution. In 1979 the New Day Montessori School was established with ten students but would grow in time to three hundred and most of the students were not Bahá'ís. At this time Bahá'ís report there were 83 assemblies amongst many hundreds of places Bahá'ís lived which included three district centers and there were 47 delegates to the national convention. In winter 1979–80 Zahida Hina gave a speech on the life and works of Táhirih at a women's conference. In spring 1980 for the International Year of the Child the local assembly of Hyderabad organized an event that showcased children's art, essays, singing and quiz competitions, and the topic of the elimination of racial prejudice was a theme in Bahá'í gatherings in several cities. In the summer an institute and a seminar were held for children and youth covering a variety of topics including \"The Role of Baha'i Youth during Political Upheavals.\" That fall and winter further gatherings were held, this time commemorating the United Nations Day (which highlighted the Commission for Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities) and a talk by a professor of Superior Science College (see Government Colleges affiliated with the University of Karachi) which encouraged discussion on the elimination of prejudices. Before spring 1981 the youth of Karachi organized a conference recapitulating many of the same themes of games, quizzes, a poster contest and round of prayers. Come April and May there was a broad attempt at engaging several interest groups from primary and secondary schools, universities and colleges, professional publishers and the general public through a radio broadcast. Still that spring, president of Pakistan, Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, wrote an executive order categorizing the Bahá'í Faith as a non-Muslim religion. That December the Bahá'ís again held an observance of United Nations Day in several cities that received press coverage from print and radio. Representatives of the Muslim, Christian, Hindu, Zoroastrian and Bahá'í communities gathered for a symposium in the fall of 1982 with the theme, \"The Increasing Social Unrest in the World Today and its Solution\" while presentations were made to judges and lawyers about the Persecution of Bahá'ís in Iran. Still in the fall a women's conference brought together sixty non-Baha'i women who were wives of judges, university professors, headmistresses and teachers to hear talks. And in January 1983 a multi-faith presentation covered \"the need of religion\" on World Religion Day held in Karachi. In February and April Bahá'ís gathered for regional school sessions in Karachi, Quetta, Rawalpindi and Sibi. In August assemblies were formed for the first time in Sialkot, near Lahore, and Multan, the birthplace of Letter of the Living, Sa'id-i-Hindi. In September a symposium on Táhirih was held with presentations including Sahar Ansari, a professor of Urdu at the University of Karachi and Zahida Hina with the attendance of noted Pakistani poet, Jon Elia. Also in September a Bahá'í women's group decided to provide treats to students at a government school for physically and mentally handicapped children which evolved into the first set of volunteers helping in the school ever had. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. From December 1984 through July 1985 more than ten vocational or tutorial schools had been set up in several cities and run by Bahá'ís or Bahá'í assemblies. Also in the early 1980s, Bahá'ís in Pakistan started social and economic development projects like small-scale medical camps. In the middle 1980s Iranian Bahá'í refugees who had come to Pakistan began to arrive in other countries. The office attending to the refugees attracted visitors from governments and institutions including members of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (LSHCR) in Islamabad and Lahore; an official from the Ministry of Justice of the Nelherlands; a delegation from Finland that included the Ambassador from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ambassador of the Embassy of Finland in Tehran, and three senior officials of the Finnish government; and the Australian Immigration Officer from Canberra. In 1985 the Universal House of Justice published \"The Promise of World Peace\" and in 1986 and the assembly of Hyderabad used the occasion of the International Year of Peace to sponsor a symposium on world peace and present the document to attendees. In 1989 Bahá'ís from Karachi moved to and elected the first local assembly in Muzaffarabad while Bahá'ís from Quetta sponsored a week long series of student competitions that were run in 11 schools in Baluchistan – each day different activities were run; \"The Elimination of Prejudice\", national songs, a quiz game, and a drama contest were among the events held. In 1998, when the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan arrested many Bahá'ís, many fled to Pakistan but many were able to return by 2002.\n\nThe religion has continued to grow – in 1990 several individuals converted from Ahmadiyyah to the Bahá'í Faith and formed an assembly. The Pakistani Bahá'í community currently had the right to hold their public meetings, establish academic centres, teach their religion, and elect their administrative councils. Indeed, government officials have occasionally attended events at Bahá'í centres. However, the government prohibits Bahá'ís from travelling to Israel for Bahá'í pilgrimage. The government of Pakistan also voted against the United Nations resolution \"Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran\" on 19 December 2001 raised in response to the Persecution of Bahá'ís in Iran. In 2003 a series of youth collaborations highlighted internal developments in the community using the Ruhi Institute process. Indeed, nearly 1000 individuals have participated in Ruhi training by 2004, and classes have continued through 2007. In 2004 the Bahá'ís of Lahore began seeking for a new Bahá'í cemetery.\n\nAccording to Bahá'í sources, the Bahá'í population in Pakistan was around 30,000 in 2001. According to the Government of Pakistan's National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), there were 33,734 Bahá'ís registered in Pakistan in 2012. There were 31,543 Bahá'í voters in 2017.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21287249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21287249", "title": "Ben Zion Abba Shaul", "text": "Ben Zion Abba Shaul\n\nBen Zion Abba Shaul () (31 July 1924 – 13 July 1998; on the Hebrew calendar: 29 Tammuz 5684 – 19 Tammuz 5758) (first name also spelled Ben Sion) was one of the leading Sephardic rabbis, Torah scholars and halakhic arbiters of his day, and the rosh yeshiva of Porat Yosef Yeshiva in Jerusalem for the last 15 years of his life. He was responsible for a religious revival among Sephardic Jews with his founding of Ma'ayan HaChinuch HaTorani, a network of Torah schools for Sephardic children in Israel, and was widely known for his ability to give blessings that were fulfilled.\n\nHe was born in Jerusalem to Eliyahu and Benaya Abba Shaul, immigrants from Iran. A shoemaker by trade, Eliyahu was also a Torah scholar and kabbalist; he was Ben Zion's first teacher. Eliyahu served as \"gabbai\" (caretaker and fundraiser) for the Ohel Rachel synagogue in the Bukharim Quarter of Jerusalem for 50 years. In his old age, his son Ben Zion became the rabbi of the synagogue and another son, Yaakov, became the hazzan.\n\nAbba Shaul was the eldest boy in a family of sixteen children. Despite their poverty, his parents were committed to raising a family of Torah scholars, even as many other families from Oriental and Sephardi backgrounds were lured into sending their children to Zionist schools. The family kept many halakhic stringencies, including grinding and baking their own matzot before Passover and avoiding all processed foods — even sugar — during the holiday itself. Abba Shaul continued to keep these stringencies even after he established his own family.\n\nAt the age of 11, Abba Shaul entered Porat Yosef, the pre-eminent Sephardic yeshiva in Jerusalem. His first teacher was Rabbi Yehuda Tzadka (who was only 21 at the time) and his classmates included the future Chief Rabbi of Israel, Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef. Later, Abba Shaul advanced to the highest \"shiur\", taught by the rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Ezra Attiya, with whom he developed a close bond. Abba Shaul abided by his rosh yeshiva's opinions on all matters and displayed the same approach to learning and to issuing halakhic directives as his mentor.\n\nAbba Shaul displayed great dedication to Torah study. He learned and reviewed each subject dozens of times until he knew most of \"Shas\" and \"poskim\" (halakhic commentaries) by heart.\n\nWhen Abba Shaul was 20 years old, Attiya selected him to be tested by Rabbi Eliezer Silver, a prominent American rabbi who was visiting Israel together with a prospective donor. Attiya had heard that in another yeshiva which this philanthropist had visited, only one boy was able to answer the rabbi's question, and only after 20 minutes. Silver asked Abba Shaul a difficult question in the obscure Talmudic order of Tohorot (laws of ritual purity). When Abba Shaul gave his answer, Silver remarked in astonishment that he had asked the same question of Rabbi Meir Simcha of Dvinsk (author of \"Ohr Sameach\" and \"Meschech Chochma\") 40 years earlier, and that that sage had given the same answer. Abba Shaul later confided to Attiya that he had had a second answer to the question as well, but since the first answer secured the donation, he didn't want to show off.\n\nIn 1948, Abba Shaul married Hadassah, the daughter of Rabbi Yosef Shaharbani, a Torah scholar and son of the kabbalist Rabbi Yehoshua Shaharbani, who was a student of the Ben Ish Chai. Abba Shaul studied one-on-one with his father-in-law, and his new wife attended his public lectures every Shabbat. She also tape-recorded his general lecture at the yeshiva; many of his written works come from those tapes.\n\nThe couple was childless for many years. After ten miscarriages, Abba Shaul visited the Chazon Ish and the Belzer Rebbe, refusing to leave until each gave him a blessing for a child. Their only son, Eliyahu, was named after Abba Shaul's father.\n\nAfter his marriage, Abba Shaul became a teacher at Talmud Torah Bnei Zion, which he had attended in his youth. He continued to study at Porat Yosef Yeshiva. In time, Attiya asked him to serve as rosh yeshiva, but he refused to accept that position as long as his first teacher, Tzadka, was still alive. He did agree to serve as a lecturer at the yeshiva. After Tzadka's death in 1983, Abba Shaul acceded to the position of rosh yeshiva of Porat Yosef.\n\nIn his capacity as rosh yeshiva, Abba Shaul maintained a heavy teaching schedule. For four hours each morning, he lectured to students in the yeshiva; in the afternoons, he taught the laws of Shulchan Aruch to \"dayanim\" (rabbinical judges). On Friday afternoons, he gave a \"halakha\" class and question-and-answer session to a packed audience in the Ohel Rachel synagogue, and on Shabbat day he delivered a three-hour discourse in the synagogue. His diligence in Torah study was legendary; it is said that when he finished delivering a \"shiur\", he was soaked with perspiration.\n\nAbba Shaul was also well-versed in kabbalah. At first he learned privately on Friday nights. In the 1960s, however, seeing that the knowledge of kabbalah study was waning, he gathered a group of kabbalists and founded the Emet VeShalom Yeshiva for learning kabbalah at night. Once a year, on the yahrtzeit of the Rashash, he joined the group and showed his fluency in this esoteric wisdom.\n\nHe also penned thousands of halakhic responsa in response to queries from the public at large, covering a broad range of topics. Some of his responsa are printed in his \"sefer\", \"She'eilot U'Teshuvot Ohr LeZion\", and he is quoted in the responsa of Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef, who remained his good friend.\n\nAbba Shaul cared about his students as a father for his sons. He tried to make sure that all his students married; his rebbetzin would suggest shidduchim from the many girls who helped her in her house. Seeing that married students were unable to manage on a kollel stipend, he established a special Friday kollel and traveled to the United States to raise money for it.\n\nAbba Shaul helped to launch a religious revival among Sephardi Jews in Israel as the founder of Ma'ayan HaChinuch HaTorani, a network of Sephardi schools which is the equivalent of Chinuch Atzmai. He promised to fund the first year of operation for any Talmud Torah that was opened in a city that did not already have one. He also worked to strengthen Sephardi communities in other countries. He traveled to England, France, Italy, Iran, Mexico, Panama, Colombia and the United States to establish rabbinical courts and to arrange for \"shochtim\" (ritual slaughterers), \"mohelim\" (ritual circumcisers), and rabbis.\n\nAbba Shaul joined other Torah leaders in Israel to fight against edicts that threatened the Torah way of life. These included the battle to preserve the sanctity of Shabbat, the fight to close mixed-sex swimming pools, and the battle against autopsies for religious individuals.\n\nIn 1972, he assumed a prominent stand in opposition to the government's proposal of mandatory army service for girls. Together with Rabbi Yehuda Tzadka, he drafted a halakhic ruling which stated that mandatory army service for girls was in the category of \"yehareg ve'al yaavor\" (\"be killed and do not transgress\"). The text of his ruling was signed by 400 Torah leaders throughout Israel.\n\nHe was also known for giving blessings that were fulfilled. Once a woman who had had three Caesarean sections was told that her next child would be born by Caesarean as well. She went to Abba Shaul and demanded, \"I won't leave until the Rav guarantees me that I'll have a natural birth.\" He agreed. After the woman left, Abba Shaul's brother asked him, \"How can you guarantee that?\"\n\n\"I can't guarantee anything,\" he replied, \"but what should I do? She wouldn't leave!\"\n\nSure enough, the woman had a natural birth. When her husband came to the synagogue to announce the \"miracle,\" Abba Shaul complained, \"They are making me into an Admor!\"\n\nWhen his \"shamash\" (assistant) asked him why his blessings were always effective, he replied, \"If you love everyone in Klal Yisrael, you can do it, too.\" To someone else, he explained, \"God told Abraham, 'I will bless those who bless you.' When people come to me, they kiss my hand. They are blessing me. If someone blesses a Jew, they are blessed in return.\"\n\nIn 1983, while delivering a eulogy at the funeral of Rabbi Yaakov Mutzafi, he suddenly felt ill and suffered a stroke a short while later. Half his body was paralyzed and his speech was slurred. Over the next 15 years, he suffered a series of mini-strokes that eventually made him a wheelchair user. Nevertheless, he continued to teach Torah and to involve himself in community affairs.\n\nHis vast knowledge from years of learning became evident in his later years. As his eyesight dimmed, he asked students to come and to read the Talmud to him. One boy recalled being corrected on a Rashi in the tractate of Nazir; another on a Tosafot in Gittin. His son said that Abba Shaul corrected him while he read the words of the Rambam to him.\n\nHe died in Jerusalem on 13 July 1998 (19 Tammuz 5758). An estimated 200,000 people of all denominations — Sephardic, Hasidic, Ashkenazic — attended his funeral. He and his wife are buried in the Sanhedria Cemetery in Jerusalem.\n\nHe is survived by his only son, Eliyahu, who is rosh yeshiva of Ohr LeZion Yeshiva in Jerusalem.\n"}

Born into a Hindu family, he was given the name Ramji Das as a child. Later, while still a child, he chose to become a Sikh. Though he never finished his basic schooling, he became a writer, a (self) publisher, an environmentalist, and a philanthropist. He is perhaps best remembered for the home he founded in Amritsar, India, named Pingalwara, a home which long after his death, is still tending to the castaways of society: the sick, disabled and abandoned forlorn people.\n\nAs a young man he decided to dedicate his life to the 'selfless service of humanity'. He founded Pingalwara in 1947 with only a few patients, the neglected and rejected of the streets of Amritsar. An early advocate of what we today refer to as the 'Green Revolution', Bhagat Puran Singh was spreading awareness about environmental pollution, and increasing soil erosion long before such ideas became popular. Pamphlets with his writings on various subjects, such as environmental awareness, were printed on re-used paper and freely distributed.\n\nHe was honoured in 1981 by the Government of India with the Padma Shri award, given for exceptional and distinguished service in any field. (See List of Padma Shri award recipients (1980–89)) He was among the citizens of India who returned their awards and medals after the Indian army's attack on the Golden Temple in 1984. He died on 5 August 1992 in Amritsar.\n\nAfter the death of his father, his mother encouraged him to finish the matric level of education, which would allow him to fill a Government job. His mother worked as a domestic help in the house of a doctor at Montgomery (Sahiwal), in part to earn the money for her son's education. Later, she moved to Lahore where she cleaned utensils in households. Puran Singh was sent to a hostel where he was sent ten rupees every month by his mother.\n\nUnfortunately, he failed his class tenth examination. Later, he was called back to Lahore and admitted in a local school, but he was not interested in studying his course books, which he felt were filled with hypothetical and theoretical knowledge with absolutely no connection or applications to everyday life. He, however, would spend hours browsing books in the Dyal Singh Library, trying to gain as much knowledge as he could.\n\nWhile in Lahore, he would often visit the Gurdwara Dehra Sahib, where he would provide water for the visitors to the gurdwara to do the necessary cleaning before entry, and help in managing the cattle that provided milk for the Gurudwara's Langar, the common kitchen, in which he helped by cleaning the utensils, making roti or distributing food to the sangat (people coming to the Gurdwara). He even cleaned the floor of the Gurudwara in the evening.\n\nOne day, someone fell from the roof of the Gurdwara and was badly injured. Bhagat Puran Singh immediately rushed him to the local 'Mu Hospital'. Experiencing inner joy after helping the patient, he took a man with badly bleeding leg, full of vermin, to a hospital where he expressed his thanks to Ramjidas telling him, \"Son! Now I can die a peaceful death.\" With this incident, the service of humanity became the mission of his life. Now he would wander here and there finding the injured, physically handicapped persons, taking them to the hospital. He also took care of them as his pocket and capability allowed. Once, he even washed the clothes of an old, poor beggar who was suffering from diarrhoea.\n\nOn a moonless night in 1934, someone left a four-year-old child, a boy stricken with leprosy at the door of Gurdwara Dehra Sahib. After performing prayers for the child's wellbeing, the then Head Granthi of the Gurudwara, Jathedar Acchar Singh, handed him over to Ramjidas, who named the boy Piara Singh. Rather than handing the child over to a centre for lepers, if any existed, Bhagat Puran Singh decided to care for and raise him himself. This incident was to completely transform the face of his life.\n\nAfter the partition of India in 1947, Bhagat Puran Singh reached a refugee camp in Amritsar which housed over 25 000 refugees with just 5 annas(0.3 rupees) in his pocket. A large number of refugees were critically wounded and incapable of nursing themselves. The government didn't make any arrangements to take care of these refugees. Bhagat Puran Singh took the initiative, he took some chloroform and turpentine oil and started treating the wounds of these refugees. He would often go in the nearby colonies to get food for the hungry and medicine for the ill.\n\nBhagat Puran Singh was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, for his selfless work, feeding, clothing, and tending sick and dying people.\n\nFrom 1947 till 1958, Bhagat Puran Singh did not get a permanent dwelling. He could be seen outside the chief Khalsa Diwan, post offices, railway stations or under the tree outside the office of the Civil Surgeon. He would wander in the streets, asking for donations to help the needy. Some people offered to help him, but most of the others kept themselves from donating towards the noble needy. But at that time only one person stand with him to serve humanity whose name was des Raj bindra. \n\nAt last, he and des Raj bindra founded 'The All India Pingalwara Charitable Society' whose annual budget at that time was 12.5 million rupees and got it registered. Even today, this institution, headquartered at Tehsilpura, Grand Trunk road, Amritsar, works for helping the poor, the diseased and the physically and mentally handicapped. He died in 1992.\n\nBorn to a Hindu father and Hindu mother who named him \"Ram ji dass\", he embraced Sikhism and took up the name Puran Singh. He was greatly inspired by the teachings of Sri Guru Granth Sahib and the Sikh Gurus.\n\nBhagat Puran Singh, was born a Hindu, though he realised Sikhism via a simple observation. Whilst he was a child his family used to travel, from village to village. They took up residence in Mandirs (Hindu temples) and Gurdwaras (Sikh temples) in each village. In the Mandir, the high-caste priest (Brahman) ordered him to clean the temple, whilst the priest ate food in front of him without offering any. Whilst in the Gurdwara, the priest (Giani) gave the boy (Puran Singh) food without asking for anything in return. It is these subtle observations that changed his life.\n\nHe was a mature environmentalist and visionary. He initiated tree plantation drives, organised talks and lectures on various issues concerning the environment and social life, and also wrote a large number of books regarding the same. Some of his famous works include \"Education of man\",\"Righteousness alone exalts a nation\",\"Plant or Perish\", \"The Way,\" \"The Increasing Population\", and many others. Along with Davinderpal Sandhu, he founded Spring Dale Senior School in 1980.\n\nHe distributed free pamphlets and books to make the people aware of the impending dangers to the environment and society through the Pingalwara Society.\n\n\nBhagat Puran Singh Chair for Studies in Selfless Service to Humanity was established at Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar in year 2005. Objective of this chair was to highlight the contribution of Bhagat Puran Singh Ji in the betterment of our society and how his philosophy can be used for a healthy and prosperous future.\n\nCommemorative postage stamps on Bhagat Puran Singh, as a mark of paying tribute to a great self-regulated person was released by Ministry of Communications & Information Technology in year 2004. The stamp is in the denomination of Rs five.\n\nBhagat Puran Singh was portrayed in a movie named Eh Janam Tumhare Lekhe with Pavan Malhotra in leading role.The Movie was released on 30 January 2015\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1906868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1906868", "title": "Black Hebrew Israelites", "text": "Black Hebrew Israelites\n\nBlack Hebrew Israelites (also called Black Hebrews, African Hebrew Israelites, and Hebrew Israelites) are groups of Black Americans who believe that they are descendants of the ancient Israelites. Black Hebrews adhere in varying degrees to the religious beliefs and practices of both Christianity and Judaism. With the exception of a small number of individuals who have formally converted to Judaism, they are not recognized as Jews by the greater Jewish community. Many choose to identify themselves as Hebrew Israelites or Black Hebrews rather than Jews in order to indicate their claimed historic connections.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, Frank Cherry and William Saunders Crowdy both claimed that African Americans are descendants of the Hebrews in the Bible; Cherry established the Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations in 1886 and Crowdy founded the Church of God and Saints of Christ in 1896.\n\nConsequently, Black Hebrew groups were founded in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, from Kansas to New York City, by both African Americans and West Indian immigrants. In the mid-1980s, the number of Black Hebrews in the United States was between 25,000 and 40,000. In the 1990s, the Alliance of Black Jews (which is no longer operating) estimated that there were 200,000 African-American Jews; this estimate was based on a 1990 survey conducted by the Council of Jewish Federations. The exact number of Black Hebrews within that surveyed group remains unspecified.\n\nTraditionally, Black Christians in the United States have identified themselves spiritually with the Israelites. In the late 19th century, some of them also began to claim that they were the biological descendants of the Israelites. This identification with the Israelites was a response to the sociopolitical realities of their situation in the United States, including slavery and racial discrimination. For African-Americans, appropriating Jewish history was part of a rebellion against the American racial hierarchy that deemed Africans inferior. It was also a means of fulfilling their desire to know their origins and regain their lost history.\n\nThe origins of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement are found in Frank Cherry and William Saunders Crowdy, who both claimed that they had revelations in which they believed that God told them that African Americans are descendants of the Hebrews in the Christian Bible; Cherry established the Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations in 1886 and Crowdy founded the Church of God and Saints of Christ in 1896. The Church of God and Saints of Christ, originating in Kansas, retained elements of a messianic connection to Jesus. During the following decades, many more Black Hebrew congregations were established, and some of them had no connection to Christianity. After World War I, for example, Wentworth Arthur Matthew, an immigrant from Saint Kitts, founded another Black Hebrew congregation in Harlem, claiming descent from the ancient Israelites. He called it the Commandment Keepers of the Living God. Similar groups selected elements of Judaism and adapted them within a structure similar to that of the Black church. He incorporated it in 1930 and moved the congregation to Brooklyn, where he later founded the Israelite Rabbinical Seminary, where Black Hebrew rabbis have been educated and ordained.\n\nThe beliefs and practices of Black Hebrew groups vary considerably. The differences are so great that historian James Tinney has suggested the classification of the organizations into three groups:\n\nBlack Hebrew organizations have certain common characteristics. Anthropologist James E. Landing, author of \"Black Judaism\", distinguishes the Black Hebrew movement, which he refers to as Black Judaism, from normative Judaism practiced by people who are Black (\"black Judaism\"). Significantly, it does not depend on a documented lineage to Jewish ancestors nor does it require recognized Orthodox or Conservative conversions:\n\nLanding's definition, and its underlying assumptions about race and normative Judaism, have been criticized.\n\nDuring the late 19th and early 20th centuries, dozens of Black Hebrew organizations were established. In Harlem alone, at least eight such groups were founded between 1919 and 1931. The Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations is the oldest-known Black Hebrew group and the Church of God and Saints of Christ is one of the largest Black Hebrew organizations. The Commandment Keepers, founded by Wentworth Arthur Matthew in New York, are noted for their adherence to traditional Judaism. The African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem are widely known for having moved from the United States, primarily Chicago, to Israel in the late-20th century.\n\nThe oldest known Black Hebrew organization is the Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations. The group was founded by F. S. Cherry in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1886, and it later moved to Philadelphia. Theologically, the Church of the Living God mixed elements of Judaism and Christianity, counting the Bible — including the New Testament — and the Talmud as essential scriptures.\n\nThe rituals of Cherry's flock incorporated many Jewish practices and prohibitions alongside some Christian traditions. For example, during prayer the men wore skullcaps and congregants faced east. In addition, members of the Church were not permitted to eat pork. Prayers were accompanied by musical instruments and gospel singing. After Cherry's death, members of the church believed that he had left temporarily and would soon reappear in spirit in order to lead the church through his son.\n\nThe Church of God and Saints of Christ was established in Lawrence, Kansas, in 1896 by African-American William Saunders Crowdy. The group established its headquarters in Philadelphia in 1899, and Crowdy later relocated to Washington, D.C., in 1903. After Crowdy's death in 1908, the church continued to grow under the leadership of William Henry Plummer, who moved the organization's headquarters to its permanent location in Belleville, Virginia, in 1921.\n\nIn 1936, the Church of God and Saints of Christ had more than 200 \"tabernacles\" (congregations) and 37,000 members. Howard Zebulun Plummer succeeded his father and became head of the organization in 1931. His son, Levi Solomon Plummer, became the church's leader in 1975. The Church of God and Saints of Christ was led by Rabbi Jehu A. Crowdy, Jr., a great-grandson of William Saunders Crowdy, from 2001 until his death in 2016. Since 2016, it has been led by Phillip E. McNeil. As of 2005, the church had fifty tabernacles in the United States and dozens more in Africa.\n\nThe Church of God and Saints of Christ describes itself as \"the oldest African-American congregation in the United States that adheres to the tenets of Judaism\". Founded by American William Saunders Crowdy in Kansas in 1896, it teaches that all Jews were originally black, and that African Americans are descendants of the lost tribes of Israel. Members believe that Jesus was neither God nor the son of God, but rather an adherent of Judaism and a prophet. They also consider William Saunders Crowdy, their founder in Kansas, to be a prophet.\n\nThe Church of God and Saints of Christ synthesizes rituals from both Judaism and Christianity. They have adopted rites drawn from both the Old and New Testaments. Its Old Testament observances include the use of the Jewish calendar, the celebration of Passover, the circumcision of infant males, the commemoration of the Sabbath on Saturday, and the wearing of yarmulkes. Its New Testament rites include baptism (immersion) and footwashing, both of which have Old Testament origins.\n\nWentworth Arthur Matthew founded the Commandment Keepers Congregation in Harlem in 1919. Matthew was influenced by the non-black Jews he met as well as by Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League. Garvey used the Biblical Jews in exile as a metaphor for black people in North America. One of the accomplishments of Garvey's movement was to strengthen the connection between black Americans and Africa, Ethiopia in particular. When Matthew later learned about the Beta Israel—Ethiopian Jews—he identified with them.\n\nToday the Commandment Keepers follow traditional Jewish practices and observe Jewish holidays. Members observe kashrut, circumcise newborn boys and celebrate Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, and their synagogue has a mechitza to separate men and women during worship.\n\nThe Commandment Keepers believe that they are descendants of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. Matthew taught that \"the Black man is a Jew\" and \"all genuine Jews are Black men\", but he valued non-black Jews as those who had preserved Judaism over the centuries. Matthew maintained cordial ties with non-black Jewish leaders in New York and frequently invited them to worship at his synagogue.\n\nMatthew established the Ethiopian Hebrew Rabbinical College (later renamed the Israelite Rabbinical Academy) in Brooklyn. He ordained more than 20 rabbis, who went on to lead congregations throughout the United States and the Caribbean. He remained the leader of the Commandment Keepers in Harlem, and in 1962 the congregation moved to a landmark building on 123rd Street.\n\nMatthew died in 1973, sparking an internal conflict over who would succeed him as head of the Harlem congregation. Shortly before his death, Matthew named his grandson, David Matthew Doré, as the new spiritual leader. Doré was 16 years old at the time. In 1975, the synagogue's board elected Rabbi Willie White to be its leader. Rabbi Doré occasionally conducted services at the synagogue until the early 1980s, when White had Doré and some other members locked out of the building. Membership declined throughout the 1990s and by 2004, only a few dozen people belonged to the synagogue. In 2007 the Commandment Keepers sold the building, while various factions among former members sued one another.\n\nBesides the Harlem group, there are eight or ten Commandment Keeper congregations in the New York area, and others exist throughout North America as well as in Israel. Since 2000, seven rabbis have graduated from the Israelite Rabbinical Academy founded by Matthew.\n\nBen Ammi Ben-Israel established the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem in Chicago, Illinois, in 1966, at a time when black nationalism was on the rise as a response to the Civil Rights Movement. In 1969, after a sojourn in Liberia, Ben Ammi and about 30 Hebrew Israelites moved to Israel. Over the next 20 years, nearly 600 more members left the United States for Israel. As of 2006, about 2,500 Hebrew Israelites live in Dimona and two other towns in the Negev region of Israel, where they are widely referred to as Black Hebrews. In addition, there are Hebrew Israelite communities in several major American cities, including Chicago, St. Louis, and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Black Hebrews believe they are descended from members of the Tribe of Judah who were exiled from the Land of Israel after the Romans destroyed the Second Temple in 70 CE. The group incorporates elements of African-American culture into their interpretation of the Bible. They do not recognize rabbinical Jewish interpretations such as the Talmud. The Black Hebrews observe Shabbat and biblically ordained Jewish holidays such as Yom Kippur and Passover.\n\nMen wear \"tzitzit\" on their African print shirts, women follow the niddah (biblical laws concerning menstruation), and newborn boys are circumcised. In accordance with their interpretation of the Bible, the Black Hebrews follow a strictly vegan diet and only wear natural fabrics. Most men have more than one wife, and birth control is not permitted.\n\nWhen the first Black Hebrews arrived in Israel in 1969, they claimed citizenship under the Law of Return, which gives eligible Jews immediate citizenship. The Israeli government ruled in 1973 that the group did not qualify for automatic citizenship because they could not prove Jewish descent and had not undergone Orthodox conversion. The Black Hebrews were denied work permits and state benefits. The group accused the Israeli government of racist discrimination. In 1981, a group of American civil rights activists led by Bayard Rustin investigated and concluded that racism was not the cause of the Black Hebrews' situation. No official action was taken to return the Black Hebrews to the United States, but some individual members were deported for working illegally.\n\nSome Black Hebrews renounced their American citizenship to try to prevent more deportations. In 1990, Illinois legislators helped negotiate an agreement that resolved the Black Hebrews' legal status in Israel. Members of the group are permitted to work and have access to housing and social services. The Black Hebrews reclaimed their American citizenship and have received aid from the U.S. government, which helped them build a school and additional housing. In 2003 the agreement was revised, and the Black Hebrews were granted permanent residency in Israel.\n\nIn 2009, Elyakim Ben-Israel became the first Black Hebrew to gain Israeli citizenship. The Israeli government said that more Black Hebrews may be granted citizenship.\n\nThe Black Hebrews of Israel have become well known for their gospel choir, which tours throughout Israel and the United States. The group owns restaurants in several Israeli cities. In 2003 the Black Hebrews garnered much public attention when singer Whitney Houston visited them in Dimona. In 2006, Eddie Butler, a Black Hebrew, was chosen by the Israeli public to represent Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nIn late 2008, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) described as black supremacist what it called \"the extremist fringe of the Hebrew Israelite movement\". It wrote that the members of such groups \"believe that Jews are devilish impostors and ... openly condemn whites as evil personified, deserving only death or slavery\". The SPLC also said that \"most Hebrew Israelites are neither explicitly racist nor anti-Semitic and do not advocate violence\".\n\nThe Black Hebrew groups characterized as black supremacist by the SPLC include the Nation of Yahweh and the Israelite Church of God in Jesus Christ. Also, the Anti-Defamation League has written that the \"12 Tribes of Israel\" website, maintained by a Black Hebrew group, promotes black supremacy.\n\nA 1999 FBI terrorism risk assessment report stated that \"violent radical fringe members\" of the Black Hebrew Israelite movement hold \"beliefs [that] bear a striking resemblance to the Christian Identity theology practiced by many white supremacists.\" It also said that \"the overwhelming majority of [Black Hebrew Israelites] are unlikely to engage in violence.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

He became an evangelist travelling throughout the Holy Land. By the end of account in Acts he was living in Caesarea Philippi where he had four daughters. \nThe Bible tells us only that The next day we left and came to Caesarea; and we went into the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the seven, and stayed with him. 9 He had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy.\n\nFurther details of these women are given in various early histories including Eusebius and Papius. It is possible that they were informants for both Luke in their youth and the early Christian historian Papius in their latter years.\nEusebius quoting Papias tells us that two daughters remained with Philip in his old age, when he had moved to the Phrygian city of Hierapolis and even relates a tale where one was miraculously rose from the dead.” Eusebius' source for these tales was Papias, who he extensively quoted, and who was a young Bishop of Hierapolis. It is plausible that Papias knew these women. \n\nEusebius held the women as examples of the right living and refers to them as “great lights” or “mighty luminaries” People would travel long distances to consult them.\nFurthermore, Eusebius regarded Philip’s daughters and their ministry as the benchmark for prophetic ministry in the early church.\nA later Greek Menaon, an annual calendar equivalent to a Catholic missal, which preserves the memory of martyrs and saints, claims that two of the daughters were called Hermione and Eutychis. \n\nHermione and her sister Eutychis travelled to Ephesus. An early \"vita\" of Hermione also survives, and recounts much of her life.\n\nTradition tells that two daughters were buried in Hierapolis. and their names were Irais and Chariline. \n\nEusebius writes “After him there were four prophetesses, the daughters of Philip, at Hierapolis in Asia. Their tomb is there and the tomb of their father.”\n\nOther sources however, say all four were buried in Caesarea.\n"}

The earliest girih dates from around 1000 AD, and the artform flourished until the 15th century. Girih patterns can be created in a variety of ways, including the traditional compass and straightedge; the construction of a grid of polygons; and the use of a set of girih tiles with lines drawn on them: the lines form the pattern. Patterns may be elaborated by the use of two levels of design, as at the 1453 Darb-e Imam shrine. Square repeating units of known patterns can be copied as templates, and historic pattern books may have been intended for use in this way.\n\nThe 15th century Topkapı Scroll explicitly shows girih patterns together with the tilings used to create them. A set of tiles consisting of a dart and a kite shape can be used to create aperiodic Penrose tilings, though there is no evidence that such a set was used in medieval times. Girih patterns have been used to decorate varied materials including stone screens, as at Fatehpur Sikri; plasterwork, as at mosques and madrasas such as Hunat Hatun, Kayseri; metal, as at Sultan Hassan mosque, Cairo; and in wood, as at the Great Mosque of Cordoba.\n\nThe girih style of ornamentation is thought to have been inspired by 2nd century AD Syrian Roman knotwork patterns. These had curvilinear interlaced strapwork with three-fold rotational symmetry. The Umayyad Mosque (709–715) in Damascus, Syria has window screens made of interlacing undulating strapwork in the form of six-pointed stars. Early examples of Islamic geometric patterns made of straight strap lines can be seen in the architecture of the surviving gateway of the Ribat-i Malik caravanserai, Uzbekistan, built in 1078.\n\nThe earliest form of girih on a book is seen in the frontispiece of a Koran manuscript from the year 1000, found in Baghdad. It is illuminated with interlacing octagons and thuluth calligraphy.\n\nIn woodwork, one of the earliest surviving examples of Islamic geometric art is the 13th-century minbar (pulpit) of the Ibn Tulun Mosque in Cairo. Girih patterns can be created in woodwork in two different ways. In one, a wooden grille with polygons and stars is created; the holes can be left as they are, or filled with some material. In the other, called \"gereh-chini\" small wooden panels of geometric shapes are created individually, and combined to create an elaborate design.\n\nThe term \"girih\" was used in Turkish for polygonal strap patterns in architecture as early as the late 15th century. In the same period, artisans compiled girih pattern books such as the Topkapı Scroll.\n\nWhile curvilinear precedents of girih were seen in the 10th century, fully developed girih patterns were not seen before the 11th century in Iran. It became a dominant design element in the 11th and 12th centuries, as in the carved stucco panels with interlaced girih of the Kharraqan towers (1067) near Qazvin, Iran. Stylized plant decorations were sometimes co-ordinated with girih.\n\nAfter the Safavid period, the use of girih continued in the Seljuk and Ilkhanid periods. In the 14th century, girih became a minor element in the decorative arts; it was largely replaced by vegetal patterns during the Timurid era, but continued to be important in decorative arts in Central Asian monuments after that time.\nGirih consists of geometric designs, often of stars and polygons, which can be constructed in a variety of ways. Girih star and polygon patterns with 5- and 10-fold rotational symmetry are known to have been made as early as the 13th century. Such figures can be drawn by compass and straightedge. The first girih patterns were made by copying a pattern template on a regular grid; the pattern was drawn with compass and straightedge. Today, artisans using traditional techniques use a pair of dividers to leave an incision mark on a paper sheet that has been left in the sun to make it brittle. Straight lines are drawn with a pencil and an unmarked straightedge. Girih patterns made this way are based on tessellations, tiling the plane with a unit cell and leaving no gaps. Because the tiling makes use of translation and rotation operations, the unit cells need to have 2-, 3-, 4- or 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\nOne of the early Western students of Islamic patterns, Ernest Hanbury Hankin, defined a \"geometrical arabesque\" as a pattern formed \"with the help of construction lines consisting of polygons in contact.\" He observed that many different combinations of polygons can be used as long as the residual spaces between the polygons are reasonably symmetrical. For example, a grid of octagons in contact has squares (of the same side as the octagons) as the residual spaces. Every octagon is the basis for an 8-point star, as seen at Akbar's tomb, Sikandra (1605–1613). Hankin considered the \"skill of the Arabian artists in discovering suitable combinations of polygons ... almost astounding.\"\n\nBy the 15th century, some girih patterns were no longer periodic, and may have been constructed using girih tiles. This method is based on a set of five tiles with lines drawn on them; when used to tile the plane with no gaps, the lines on the tiles form a girih pattern. It is not yet known when girih tiles were first used for architectural decoration instead of compass and straightedge, but it was probably at the start of the 13th century. Methods of ornamentation were extremely diverse, however, and the idea that one method was used for all of them has been criticised as anachronistic.\n\nThe girih patterns on the Darb-e Imam shrine built in 1453 at Isfahan had a much more complex pattern than any previously seen. The details of the pattern indicate that girih tiles, rather than compass and straightedge, were used for decorating the shrine. The patterns appear aperiodic; within the area on the wall where they are displayed, they do not form a regularly repeating pattern; and they are drawn at two different scales. A large-scale pattern is discernible when the building is viewed from a distance, and a smaller-scale pattern forming part of the larger one can be seen from closer up.\n\nAlthough there is evidence that some ancient girih tilings used a subdivision rule to draw a two-level pattern, there are no known historic examples that can be repeated an infinite level of times. For example, the pattern used in the spandrel of the Darb-i Imam shrine (see figure) consists only of decagons and bowties, while the subdivision rule uses an elongated hexagon tile alongside these two shapes. Therefore, this design lacks self-similarity between the two levels.\n\nA periodic tiling of the plane is the regular repetition of a \"unit cell\", in the manner of a wallpaper, without any gaps. Such tilings can be seen as a two-dimensional crystal, and because of the crystallographic restriction theorem, the unit cell is restricted to a rotational symmetry of 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold. It is therefore impossible to tile the plane periodically with a figure that has five-fold rotational symmetry, such as a five-pointed star or a decagon. Patterns with infinite perfect quasi-periodic translational order can have crystallographically forbidden rotational symmetries such as pentagonal or decagonal shapes. These quasi-crystalline tilings contain shapes with five-fold symmetry that repeat periodically, in between other shapes that do not repeat.\n\nOne way to create quasi-periodic patterns is to create a Penrose tiling. Girih tiles can be subdivided into Penrose tiles called \"dart\" and \"kite\", but there is no evidence that this approach was used by medieval artisans. Another way to create quasiperiodic patterns is by subdividing girih tiles repeatedly into smaller tiles using a subdivision rule. In the limit the plane would be divided into girih tiles that repeat with frequencies that are aperiodic. The use of such a subdivision rule would serve as evidence that Islamic artisans of the 15th century were aware that girih tiles can produce complex patterns that never exactly repeat themselves. However, no known patterns made with girih tiles have more than a two-level design. There would have been no practical need for a girih pattern with more than two levels of design, as a third level would be either too large or too small to be perceived. It appears that medieval Islamic artisans were using a tool that had the potential of creating highly complex patterns, but they never realized it. As E. Makovicky argues,\n\nThe Topkapı Scroll, from the late 15th century, documents the use of girih tiles to create girih patterns. The drawings in this pattern book show the girih lines superimposed on the tiles used to generate the pattern, making the construction fully evident.\n\nOnce a repeating pattern has been constructed, regardless of the method used, the pattern can be recreated by copying a repeating unit of it, like the pattern of a wallpaper, as a paper template. The pattern can then simply be pricked through on to the surface to be decorated. The Topkapı Scroll grids may well have been meant for use as such templates. The \"Anonymous Compendium\" contains square repeat units for many girih patterns. Ibn al-Razzaz al-Jazari's \"Compendium of Science and Useful Practice in the Mechanical Arts\" contains explicit templates for special purposes such as cast bronze doors.\n\nGirih has been widely applied on the architecture. The patterns on the Persian geometric windows meet the need of the Persian architecture, as the ornateness of windows indicated the social and economic status of the owner. A good example is Azad Koliji, a Dowlatabad Garden in Iran. With the girih patterns on its window, the architects manage to demonstrate multiple layers. The first layer is the actual garden which people can see when they open the window. And the second layer is the artificial garden as the girih patterns are on the outside of the window is the carved pattern and a colorful glass is below it which creates an illusion of a beautiful garden. The multi-colour layer create a sense of a mass of flowers. The artificial layer is abstract which forms a clear contradiction with the real layer outside the window and gives the audience enough space of imagination.\n\nIn addition to plain platforms like the windows, girih patterns on the domes are very popular as well. However, due to the curve shapes of the domes, they need special techniques. One of the most important techniques is called “Dast-Garden” method. This method refers to that the number of star polygons applied to the pattern are highly dependent on the change of the dome curvature. Decreasing the curvature of a dome surface leads to the decreasing of the number of points on a star polygon. Thus, the shapes of the girih pattern are heavily relying on the dome. The same method can be applied to other surfaces, even irregular surface.\n\nGirih patterns are very likely to be all over the walls of some Islamic architectures. The decorating lines connect to each other and form a continuous network across the entire tiling with edges combine together. In addition, girih patterns vary a lot on the surface, with different geometric shapes including decagons, hexagons, bowties and rhombuses. Among all these patterns, a special technique is shared: \"self-similar transformation\". The mapping is completed by using this freedom to eliminate the edge difference of these patterns and reduce the edge mismatches to the lowest degree.\n\n"}

{"id": "2842461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2842461", "title": "Heroides", "text": "Heroides\n\nThe Heroides (\"The Heroines\"), or Epistulae Heroidum (\"Letters of Heroines\"), is a collection of fifteen epistolary poems composed by Ovid in Latin elegiac couplets and presented as though written by a selection of aggrieved heroines of Greek and Roman mythology in address to their heroic lovers who have in some way mistreated, neglected, or abandoned them.\nA further set of six poems, widely known as the \"Double Heroides\" and numbered 16 to 21 in modern scholarly editions, follows these individual letters and presents three separate exchanges of paired epistles: one each from a heroic lover to his absent beloved and from the heroine in return.\n\nArguably some of Ovid's most influential works (see below), one point that has greatly contributed to the mystique of the \"Heroides\"—and to the reverberations they have produced within the writings of later generations—is directly attributable to Ovid himself. In the third book of his \"Ars Amatoria\", Ovid argues that in writing these fictional epistolary poems in the personae of famous heroines, rather than from a first-person perspective, he created an entirely new literary genre. Recommending parts of his poetic output as suitable reading material to his assumed audience of Roman women, Ovid wrote of his \"Heroides\": \"vel tibi composita cantetur Epistola voce: | ignotum hoc aliis ille novavit opus\" (\"Ars Amatoria\" : \"Or let an Epistle be sung out by you in practiced voice: unknown to others, he [\"sc.\" Ovid] originated this sort of composition\"). The full extent of Ovid's originality in this matter has been a point of scholarly contention: E. J. Kenney, for instance, notes that \"\"novavit\" is ambiguous: either 'invented' or 'renewed', cunningly obscuring without explicitly disclaiming O[vid]'s debt to Propertius' \"Arethusa\" (4.3) for the original idea.\" In spite of various interpretations of Propertius 4.3, consensus nevertheless concedes to Ovid the lion's share of the credit in the thorough exploration of what was then a highly innovative poetic form.\n\nThe exact dating of the \"Heroides\", as with the overall chronology of the Ovidian corpus, remains a matter of debate. As Peter E. Knox notes, \"[t]here is no consensus about the relative chronology of this [\"sc.\" early] phase of O[vid]'s career,\" a position which has not advanced significantly since that comment was made. Exact dating is hindered not only by a lack of evidence, but by the fact that much of what is known at all comes from Ovid's own poetry. One passage in the second book of Ovid's \"Amores\" (\"Am.\") has been adduced especially often in this context:\nKnox notes that \"[t]his passage ... provides the only external evidence for the date of composition of the \"Heroides\" listed here. The only collection of \"Heroides\" attested by O[vid] therefore antedates at least the second edition of the \"Amores\" (c. 2 BC), and probably the first (c. 16 BC) ...\" On this view, the most probable date of \"composition\" for at least the majority of the collection of single \"Heroides\" ranges between c. 25 and 16 BC, if indeed their eventual \"publication\" predated that of the assumed first edition of the \"Amores\" in that latter year. Regardless of absolute dating, the evidence nonetheless suggests that the single \"Heroides\" represent some of Ovid's earliest poetic efforts.\n\nQuestions of authenticity, however, have often inhibited the literary appreciation of these poems. Joseph Farrell identifies three distinct issues of importance to the collection in this regard: (1) individual interpolations within single poems, (2) the authorship of entire poems by a possible Ovidian impersonator, and (3) the relation of the \"Double Heroides\" to the singles, coupled with the authenticity of that secondary collection. Discussion of these issues has been a focus, even if tangentially, of many treatments of the \"Heroides\" in recent memory.\n\nAs an example following these lines, for some time scholars debated over whether this passage from the \"Amores\"—corroborating, as it does, only the existence of \"Her.\" 1–2, 4–7, 10–11, and very possibly of 12, 13, and 15—could be cited fairly as evidence for the \"in\"authenticity of at least the letters of Briseis (3), Hermione (8), Deianira (9), and Hypermnestra (14), if not also those of Medea (12), Laodamia (13), and Sappho (15). Stephen Hinds argues, however, that this list constitutes only a \"poetic\" catalogue, in which there was no need for Ovid to have enumerated every individual epistle. This assertion has been widely persuasive, and the tendency amongst scholarly readings of the later 1990s and following has been towards careful and insightful literary explication of individual letters, either proceeding under the assumption of, or with an eye towards proving, Ovidian authorship. Other studies, eschewing direct engagement with this issue in favour of highlighting the more ingenious elements—and thereby demonstrating the high value—of individual poems in the collection, have essentially subsumed the authenticity debate, implicating it through a tacit equation of high literary quality with Ovidian authorship. This trend is visible especially in the most recent monographs on the \"Heroides\". On the other hand, some scholars have taken a completely different route, ascribing the whole collection to one or two Ovidian imitators (the catalogue in \"Am.\" 2.18, as well as \"Ars am.\" 3.345–6 and \"Epistulae ex Ponto\" 4.16.13–14, would then be interpolations introduced to establish the imitations as authentic Ovid).\n\nThe paired letters of the \"Double Heroides\" are not outlined here: see the relevant section of that article for the double epistles (16–21). The single \"Heroides\" are written from the viewpoints of the following heroines (and heroes). The quotations highlighted are the opening couplets of each poem, by which each would have been identified in medieval manuscripts of the collection:\n\nThe \"Heroides\" were popularized by the Loire valley poet Baudri of Bourgueil in the late eleventh century, and Héloïse used them as models in her famous letters to Peter Abelard. A translation, \"Les Vingt et Une Epistres d'Ovide\", was made of this work at the end of the 15th century by the French poet Octavien de Saint-Gelais, who later became Bishop of Angoulême. While Saint-Gelais' translation does not do full justice to the original, it introduced many non-Latin readers to Ovid's fictional letters and inspired many of them to compose their own Heroidean-style epistles. Perhaps the most successful of these were the \"Quatre Epistres d'Ovide\" (c. 1500) by André de La Vigne, a friend and colleague of Saint-Gelais. Later translations and creative responses to the \"Heroides\" include Jean Lemaire de Belges's \"Premiere Epître de l'Amant vert\" (1505), Fausto Andrelini's verse epistles (1509–1511; written in the name of Anne de Bretagne), 's \"Contrepistres d'Ovide\" (1546), and Juan Rodríguez de la Cámara's \"Bursario\", a partial translation of the \"Heroides\".\n\nClassics scholar W. M. Spackman argues the \"Heroides\" influenced the development of the European novel: of Helen's reply to Paris, Spackman writes, \"its mere 268 lines contain in embryo everything that has, since, developed into the novel of dissected motivations that is one of our glories, from \"La Princess de Clèves, Manon Lescaut\", and \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\", to Stendhal and Proust.\"\n\nThe Loeb Classical Library presents the \"Heroides\" with \"Amores\" in Ovid I. Penguin Books first published Harold Isbell's translation in 1990. Isbell's translation uses unrhymed couplets that generally alternate between eleven and nine syllables. A translation in rhymed couplets by Daryl Hine appeared in 1991.\n\nAll notes refer to works listed in the \"Bibliography\", below.\nFor references specifically relating to that subject, please see the relevant bibliography of the \"Double Heroides\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on April 4, 2012. In this episode, South Park's big Easter egg hunt is in jeopardy when there are rumors of a dangerous beast lurking in the woods nearby. Cartman tries to warn everyone that their lives are at risk if they participate in the egg hunt. No one believes him until he produces video evidence of the mysterious being.\n\nWhen Kyle finds his mother educating Cartman on Passover, because of a claimed interest in Jewish culture on Cartman's part, Kyle is suspicious. Cartman tells Kyle and his other schoolmates of a blood-sucking creature called \"Jewpacabra\" that preys on children, and mentions reports of incidents that he implies are the result of the creature. Kyle denounces this idea, and accuses Cartman of spreading lies, as there is no such creature. Cartman does not relent in his efforts, taking Butters with him to hunt the Jewpacabra, and showing video tape of their efforts to the executives of Sooper Foods, in an attempt to convince them to cancel their Easter egg hunt. \n\nThe executives show the video to a team of experts at the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO), who confirm that it is evidence of an actual Jewpacabra, and tell Cartman that the creature will come after him because he exposed its existence. This frightens Cartman into hiding in a church with Token, Craig and Butters, whom Cartman pays $20 to protect him. Cartman is nonetheless abducted by the Sooper Foods executives, who dress him in an Easter bunny costume and chain him to a cement block in a field in order to sacrifice him to the Jewpacabra, which will make the Easter egg hunt possible. When Kyle appears before Cartman, Cartman pleads with him to help him escape, but when Kyle says he will only do so if Cartman admits he lied about the Jewpacabra, Cartman's inability to be honest about what caused his predicament causes Kyle to abandon him. BFRO then see Cartman and think he is a real life \"Bunny-Man\", so they shoot him with a tranquilizer and hope to make an Animal Planet program documenting their capture, but instead of taking Cartman as their evidence, they take the gun with which they shot him.\n\nCartman then experiences a tranquilizer-induced dream. He awakes in Ancient Egypt amidst a and . He asks \"his Hebrew friend\" Kyle about it, who tells him the Plagues of Egypt are the result of a cruel and capricious God.

In abject religious terror, Cartman swears to God that if he is spared, he will become Jewish.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyle has a change of heart and frees the delirious Cartman from his captivity, takes him home, and puts him to bed. When Cartman awakens with no knowledge of how he got home, he classifies the experience as a religious epiphany, and announces to everyone at the Easter egg hunt that he has converted to Judaism. When he tells everyone that they should convert too by recognizing Jehovah as their true God and denying Christ, the assembled Christians label Cartman as a heathen and return to their hunt. Cartman apologizes to Kyle, saying he now knows what he feels like to be mocked by others for being Jewish, and the two wish each other a Happy Passover. The camera then pans up to a Star of David shining at the center of the Sun.\n\nJacob Kleinman of the \"International Business Times\" thought the episode was generally \"solid\", though not as funny as the previous week's episode. Kleinman singled out the ancient Egypt sequence as his favorite, and also thought that the manner in which Cartman's Jewpacabra stories backfired on him were \"hilarious, historic and extremely shocking\".\n\n"}

Although he ruled during peaceful times, Khety boasted his ability as a warrior and ordered the organization of a provincial defence militia.\n\nAfter his death Khety was buried in Asyut (tomb V) and his titles passed to his son Tefibi, who is likely to have lived during the reign of Wahkare Khety and Merykare.\n\n"}

Among the Maya, the central world tree was conceived as or represented by a ceiba tree, and is known variously as a \"wacah chan\" or \"yax imix che\", depending on the Mayan language. The trunk of the tree could also be represented by an upright caiman, whose skin evokes the tree's spiny trunk.\n\nDirectional world trees are also associated with the four Yearbearers in Mesoamerican calendars, and the directional colors and deities.

By 2030, Muslims will make up more than a quarter of the global population.\n\nGlobally, Muslims have the highest fertility rate, an average of 2.9 children per woman—well above replacement level (2.1) and also a younger age profile (median age of 24) compared to other religious groups. Hindu fertility (2.4) is similar to the global average (2.5). Worldwide, Jewish fertility (2.3 per woman) also is above replacement level. Most of the religious groups have fertility levels too low to sustain their populations and would require converts to grow or maintain their size: indigenous and tribal religions (1.8 children per woman), other religions (1.7), the unaffiliated (1.7) and Buddhists (1.6).\n\nThis significant projected growth is largely due to the young age, high fertility rate of Muslims. According to Pew Research, religious conversion has no net impact on the Muslim population as the number of people who convert to Islam is roughly similar to those who leave Islam. It is often reported from most recent various sources in 2010, including the German domestic intelligence service, that Salafism is the fastest-growing Islamic movement in the world.

The Spanish shrine rose to prominence following the Battle of Covadonga c.720, at which the Moorish invasion of Spain was first resisted. \nA statue of the Virgin Mary, secretly hidden in one of the caves, was believed to have miraculously aided the Christian victory. \n\nOur Lady of Covadonga is the patron of Asturias, and a basilica was built to house the current statue. Pope John Paul II visited the shrine at Covadonga to honour the Virgin Mary. The feast of our Lady under this title is 7 September.\n\nCovadonga is a mountainous region in the province of Asturias in the extreme north west of Spain. Following the Islamic Arab invasion of Spain in 711, Roderic, the Christian Visigoth King of Spain was defeated and killed at the Battle of Guadalete. The battle was decisive and led to the swift conquest of most of Visigothic Spain.\n\nThe remnant of the Visigoth nobility retreated to the remote mountains of northern Spain. According to texts written in northern Iberia during the ninth century, they elected in 718 a man named Pelayo, or Pelagius, as their leader. Pelayo's father had been a dignitary at the court of the Visigoth King Egica. Pelayo gathered a band of warriors to resist Islamic encroachment. When in 722 the Arab commander of Spain sent an army to eliminate this resistance, the Christian army made its stand at a place of many caves known as Covadonga.\n\nAccording to tradition Pelayo retreated to a cave where a hermit had secreted a statue of the Virgin Mary, saved from the Muslim conquest. He prayed to the virgin for victory. In the subsequent battle the Christians made use of the natural defences. The moorish commander fell in the battle, and his soldiers fled.

Pythagoras established the first Pythagorean community in Croton, Italy. Early-Pythagorean communities lived throughout Magna Graecia. They espoused a rigorous life of the intellect and strict rules on diet, clothing and behavior. Following Pythagoras’ death, disputes about his teachings led to the development of two philosophical traditions within Pythagoreanism. The practitioners of \"akousmatikoi\" were superseded in the 4th century BC as significant mendicant school of philosophy by the Cynics. The Pythagorean \"mathēmatikoi\" philosophers were in the 4th century BC absorbed into the Platonic school. \n\nFollowing the political instability in the Magna Graecia, some Pythagorean philosophers fled to mainland Greece while others regrouped in Rhegium. By about 400 BC the majority of Pythagorean philosophers had left Italy. Pythagorean ideas exercised a marked influence on Plato and through him, on all of Western philosophy. Many of the surviving sources on Pythagoras originate with Aristotle and the philosophers of the Peripatetic school.\n\nAs a philosophic tradition, Pythagoreanism was revived in the 1st century BC, giving rise to Neopythagoreanism. The worship of Pythagoras continued in Italy and as a religious community Pythagoreans appear to have survived as part of, or deeply influenced, the Bacchic cults and Orphism.\n\nPythagoras was already in ancient times well known for the mathematical achievement of the Pythagorean theorem. Although the Babylonians had used this formula for centuries, Pythagoras had discovered that \"in a right-angled triangle the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the squares of the other two sides\". In ancient times Pythagoras was also noted for his discovery that music had mathematical foundations. Antique sources that credit Pythagoras as the philosopher who first discovered music intervals also credit him as the inventor of the monochord, a straight rod on which a string and a movable bridge could be used to demonstrate the relationship of musical intervals. \n\nMuch of the surviving sources on Pythagoras originate with Aristotle and the philosophers of the Peripatetic school, which founded histographical academic traditions such as biography, doxography and the history of science. The surviving 5th century BC sources on Pythagoras and early Pythagoreanism are void of supernatural elements. While surviving 4th century BC sources on Pythagoreas' teachings introduced legend and fable. Philosophers who discussed Pythagoreanism, such as Anaximander, Andron of Ephesus, Heraclides and Neanthes had access to historical written sources as well as the oral tradition about Pythagoreanism, which by the 4th century BC was in decline. Neopythagorean philosophers, who authored many of the surviving sources on Pythagoreanism, continued the tradition of legend and fantasy.\n\nThe earliest surviving ancient source on Pythagoras and his followers is a satire by Xenophanes, on the Pythagorean believes on the transmigration of souls. Xenophanes wrote of Pythagoras that:\n\nIn a surviving fragment from Heraclitus Pythagoras and his followers are described as follows:\n\nTwo other surviving fragments of ancient sources on Pythagoras are by Ion of Chios and Empedocles. Both were born in the 490s, after Pythagoras' death. By that time he was known as a sage and his fame had spread throughout Greece. According to Ion, Pythagoras was:\n\nEmpedocles described Pythagoras as \"a man of surpassing knowledge, master especially of all kinds of wise works, who had acquired the upmost wealth of understanding.\" In the 4th century BC the Sophist Alcidamas wrote that Pythagoras was widely honored by Italians. \n\nToday scholars typically distinguish two periods of Pythagoreanism: early-Pythagoreanism, from the 6th till the 5th century BC, and late-Pythagoreanism, from the 4th till the 3rd century BC. The Spartan colony of Taranto in Italy became the home for many practitioners of Pythagoreanism and later for Neopythagorean philosophers. Pythagoras had also lived in Crotone and Metaponto, both were Achaean colonies. Early-Pythagorean sects lived in Croton and throughout Magna Graecia. They espoused to a rigorous life of the intellect and strict rules on diet, clothing and behavior. Their burial rites were tied to their believe in the immortality of the soul. \n\nEarly-Pythagorean sects were closed societies and new Pythagoreans were chosen based on merit and discipline. Ancient sources record that early-Pythagoreans underwent a five year initiation period of listening to the teachings (\"akousmata\") in silence. Initiates could through a test become members of the inner circle. However, Pythagoreans could also leave the community if they wished. Iamblichus listed 235 Pythagoreans by name, among them 17 women who he described as the \"most famous\" women practitioners of Pythagoreanism. It was customary that family members became Pythagoreans, as Pythagoreanism developed into a philosophic traditions that entailed rules for everyday life and Pythagoreans were bound by secrets. The home of a Pythagorean was known as the site of mysteries.\n\nPythagoras had been born on the island of Samos at around 570 BC and left his homeland at around 530 BC in opposition to the policies of Polycrates. Before settling in Croton, Pythagoras had traveled throughout Egypt and Babylonia. In Croton, Pythagoras established the first Pythagorean community, described as a secret society, and attained political influence. In the early 5th century BC Croton acquired great military and economic importance. Pythagoras emphasized moderation, piety, respect for elders and of the state, and advocated a monogamous family structure. The Croton Council appointed him to official positions. Among others Pythagoras was in charge of education in the city. His influence as political reformer reputably extended to other Greek colonies in southern Italy and in Sicily. Pythagoras died shortly after an arson attack on the Pythagorean meeting place in Croton. \n\nThe anti-Pythagorean attacks in c. 500 BC were headed by Cylon of Croton. After these initial attacks and the death of Pythagoras, Pythagorean communities in Croton and elsewhere continued to flourish. At around 450 BC attacks on Pythagorean communities were carried out across Magna Graecia. In Croton, a house were Pythagoreans gathered was set on fire and all but two of the Pythagorean philosophers burned alive. Pythagorean meeting places in other cities were also attacked and philosophic leaders killed. These attacks occurred in the context of widespread violence and destruction in Magna Graecia. Following the political instability in the region, some Pythagorean philosophers fled to mainland Greece while others regrouped in Rhegium. By about 400 BC the majority of Pythagorean philosophers had left Italy. Archytas remained in Italy and ancient sources record that he was visited there by young Plato in the early 4th century BC. The Pythagorean schools and societies died out from the 4th century BC. Pythagorean philosophers continued to practice, albeit no organized communities were established.\n\nAccording to surviving sources by the Neopythagorean philosopher Nicomachus, Philolaus was the successor of Pythagoras. According to Cicero (de Orat. III 34.139), Philolaus was teacher of Archytas. According to the Neoplatonist philosopher Iamblichus, Archytas in turn became the head of the Pythagorean school about a century after the Pythagoras' death. Philolaus and Eurytus are identified by Aristoxenus as teachers of the last generation of Pythagoreans.\n\nFollowing Pythagoras’ death, disputes about his teachings led to the development of two philosophical traditions within Pythagoreanism in Italy: \"akousmatikoi\" and \"mathēmatikoi\". The practitioners of \"mathēmatikoi\" recognized practitioners of \"akousmatikoi\" as fellow Pythagoreans, but because the \"mathēmatikoi\" allegedly followed the teachings of Hippasus, the \"akousmatikoi\" philosophers did not recognise them. Despite this, both groups were regarded by their contemporaries as practitioners of Pythagoreanism. \n\nThe \"akousmatikoi\" were superseded in the 4th century BC as significant mendicant school of philosophy by the Cynics. Philosophers of the \"mathēmatikoi\" were in the 4th century BC absorbed into the Platonic school of Speusippus, Xenocrates and Polemon. As a philosophic tradition, Pythagoreanism was revived in the 1st century BC, giving rise to Neopythagoreanism. The worship of Pythagoras continued in Italy in the two intervening centuries. As a religious community Pythagoreans appear to have survived as part of, or deeply influenced, the Bacchic cults and Orphism.\n\nThe practitioners of \"akousmatikoi\" believed that humans had to act in appropriate ways. \"Akousmata\" (translated as \"oral saying\") preserved all sayings of Pythagoras as divine dogma. The \"akousmatikoi\" tradition resisted any reinterpretation or philosophic evolution of Pythagoras' teachings. Individuals who by their actions attained the most \"akousmata\" were regarded as wise. The \"akousmatikoi\" philosophers refused to recognize that the continuous development of mathematical and scientific research conducted by the \"mathēmatikoi\" practitioners was in line with Pythagoras's intention. Until the demise of Pythagoreanism in the 4th century BC, the \"akousmatikoi\" continued to engage in a pious life by practicing silence, dressing simply and avoiding meat, for the purpose of attaining a privileged afterlife. The \"akousmatikoi\" engaged deeply in questions of Pythagoras' moral teachings, concerning matters such as harmony, justice, ritual purity and moral behavior.\n\nThe practitioners of \"\" acknowledged the religious underpinning of Pythagoreanism and engaged in \"mathēma\" (translated as \"learning\" or \"studying\") as part of their practice. While their scientific pursuits were largely mathematical, they also promoted other fields of scientific study in which Pythagoras had engaged during his lifetime. A sectarianism developed between the dogmatic \"akousmatikoi\" and the \"mathēmatikoi\", who in their intellectual activism became regarded as increasingly progressive. This tension persisted until the 4th century BC, when the philosopher Archytas engaged in advanced mathematics as part of his devotion to Pythagoras' teachings. \n\nToday, Pythagoras is mostly remembered for his mathematical ideas, and by association with the work early Pythagoreans did in advancing mathematical concepts and theories on harmonic musical intervals, the definition of numbers, proportion and mathematical methods such as arithmetic and geometry. The \"mathēmatikoi\" philosophers claimed that numbers were at the heart of everything and constructed a new view of the cosmos. In the \"mathēmatikoi\" tradition of Pythagoreanism the Earth was removed from the center of the universe. The \"mathēmatikoi\" believed that the Earth, along with other celestial bodies, orbited around a central fire. This, they believed, resembled a celestial harmony.\n\nPythagoreanism was a philosophic tradition as well as an religious practice. As a religious community they relied on oral teachings and worshiped the Pythian Apollo, the oracular god of Delphic Oracle. Pythagoreans preached an austere life. They believed that the soul was buried in the body, which acted as a tomb for the soul in this life. The highest reward a human could attain was for the soul to join in the life of the gods and thus escaped the cycle of reincarnation in another human body. Like the practitioners of Orphism, a religious tradition that developed in parallel to Pythagorean religious practice, Pythagoreanism believed that the soul was buried in the body as a punishment for a committed offense and that the soul could be purified. Aside from conducting their daily lives according to strict rules Pythagorean also engaged in rituals to attain purity. The 4th century Greek historian and sceptic philosopher Hecataeus of Abdera asserted that Pythagoras had been inspired by ancient Egyptian philosophy in his use of ritual regulations and his belief in reincarnation.\n\nEarly Pythagoreanism was based on research and the accumulation of knowledge from the books written by other philosophers. Pythagoras' philosophic teachings made direct reference to the philosophy of Anaximander, Anaximenes of Miletus and Pherecydes of Syros. Of the Pythagorean philosophers Hippasus, Alcmaeon, Hippon, Archytas and Theodorus written sources have survived.\n\nPythagoras in his teachings cultivated mathematics and numbers, engaging in a combination of philosophic theorizing and deductive provable methodology. \"Numbers\" were in the Greek world of Pythagoras' days \"natural numbers\" - that is positive integers. But unlike their Greek contemporaries, the Pythagorean philosophers represented numbers graphically, not symbolically through letters. Pythagoreans used dots, also known as \"psiphi\" (pebbles), to represent numbers in triangles, squares, rectangles and pentagons. This enabled a visual comprehension of mathematics and allowed for a geometrical exploration of numerical relationships. Pythagorean philosophers investigated the relationship of numbers exhaustively. They defined \"perfect numbers\" as those that were equal the sum of all their divisors. For example: 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. The theory of odd and even numbers was central to Pythagorean arithmetic. This distinction was for the Pythagorean philosophers direct and visual, as they arranged triangular dots so that the even and odd numbers successively alternate: 2, 4, 6, ... 3, 5, 7, ...\n\nEarly-Pythagorean philosophers such as Philolaus and Archytas held the conviction that mathematics could help in addressing important philosophical problems. In Pythagoreanism numbers became related to intangible concepts. The \"one\" was related to the intellect and being, the \"two\" to thought, the number \"four\" was related to justice because 2 * 2 = 4 and equally even. A dominant symbolism was awarded to the number \"three\", Pythagoreans believed that the whole world and all things in it are summed up in this number, because end, middle and beginning give the number of the whole. The triad had for Pythagoreans an ethical dimension, as the goodness of each person was believed to be threefold - prudence, drive and good fortune.\n\nThe Pythagoreans engaged with geometry as a liberal philosophy which served to establish principles and allowed theorems to be explored abstractly and mentally. Pythagorean philosophers believed that there was a close relationship between numbers and geometrical forms. Early-Pythagorean philosophers proved simple geometrical theorems, including \"the sum of the angles of a triangle equals two right angles\". Pythagoreans also came up with three of the five regular polyhedra: the tetrahedron, the cube and the dodecahedron. The sides of a regular dodecahedron are regular pentagons, which for Pythagoreans symbolized health. They also revered the pentagram, as each diagonal divides the two others at the golden ratio. When linear geometrical figures replaced the dots, the combination of Babylonian algebra and Pythagorean arithmetic provided the basis for Greek geometric algebra. By attempting to establish a system of concrete and permanent rules, Pythagoreans helped to establish strict axiomatic procedures of solving mathematical problems.\n\nPythagoras pioneered the mathematical and experimental study of music. He objectively measured physical quantities, such as the length of a string and discovered quantitative mathematical relationships of music through arithmetic ratios. Pythagoras attempted to explain subjective psychological and aesthetic feelings, such as the enjoyment of musical harmony. Pythagoras and his students experimented systematically with strings of varying length and tension, with wind instruments with brass discs of the same diameter but different thicknesses, and with identical vases filled with different levels of water. Early Pythagoreans established quantitative ratios between the length of a string or pipe and the pitch of notes and the frequency of string vibration.\n\nPythagoras is credited with discovering that the most harmonious musical intervals are created by the simple numerical ratio of the first four integer numbers which derive respectively from the relations of string length: the eighth (1/2), the fifth (2/3) and the fourth (3/4). The sum of those numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 was for Pythagoreans the perfect number, because it contained in itself \"the whole essential nature of numbers\". Werner Heisenberg has called this formulation of musical arithmetical as \"among the most powerful advances of human science\" because it enables the measurement of sound in space.\n\nPythagorean tuning is a system of musical tuning in which the frequency ratios of all intervals are based on the ratio 3:2. This ratio, also known as the \"pure\" perfect fifth, is chosen because it is one of the most consonant and easiest to tune by ear and because of importance attributed to the integer 3. As Novalis put it, \"The musical proportions seem to me to be particularly correct natural proportions.\"\n\nThe fact that mathematics could explain the human sentimental world had a profound impact on the Pythagorean philosophy. Pythagoreanism became the quest for establishing the fundamental essences of reality. Pythagorean philosophers advanced the unshakable belief that the essence of all thing are numbers and that the universe was sustained by harmony. According to ancient sources music was central to the lives of those practicing Pythagoreanism. They used medicines for the purification (\"katharsis\") of the body and, according to Aristoxenus, music for the purification of the soul. Pythagoreans used different types of music to arouse or calm their souls.\n\nFor Pythagoreans harmony signified the \"unification of a multifarious composition and the agreement of unlike spirits\". In Pythagoreanism numeric harmony was applied in mathematical, medical, psychological, aesthetic, metaphysical and cosmological problems. For Pythagorean philosophers the basic property of numbers was expressed in the harmonious interplay of opposite pairs. Harmony assured the balance of opposite forces. Pythagoras had in his teachings named numbers and the symmetries of them as the first principle, and called these numeric symmetries harmony. This numeric harmony could be discovered in rules throughout nature. Numbers governed the properties and conditions of all beings and were regarded the causes of being in everything else. Pythagorean philosophers believed that numbers were the elements of all beings and the universe as a whole was composed of harmony and numbers.\n\nThe philosopher Philolaus, one of the most prominent figures in Pythagoreanism, was the precursor of Copernicus in moving the earth from the center of the cosmos and making it a planet. According to Aristotle's student Eudemus of Cyprus, the first philosopher to determine quantitatively the size of the known planets and the distance between them was Anaximander, a teacher to Pythagoras, in the 6th century BC. Historic sources credit the Pythagorean philosophers with being the first to attempt a clarification of the planet sequence. The early-Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus believed that limited and unlimited things were the components of the cosmos and these had existed ever since. The center of the universe, according to Philolaus, was the number one (\"hēn\"), which equated to the unity of Monism. Philolaus called the number one an \"even-odd\" because it was able to generate both even and odd numbers. When one was added to an odd number it produced an even number, and when added to an even number it produced an odd number. Philolaus further reasoned that the fitting together of the earth and the universe corresponded to the construction of the number one out of the even and the odd. Pythagorean philosophers believed that the even was unlimited and the odd was limited. \n\nAristotle recorded in the 1st century BC on the Pythagorean astronomical system: \n\nIt is not known whether Philolaus believed Earth to be round or flat, but he did not believe the earth rotated, so that the Counter-Earth and the Central Fire were both not visible from Earth's surface, or at least not from the hemisphere where Greece was located. But the conclusion of Pythagorean philosophers that the universe is not geocentric was not based on empirical observation. Instead, as Aristotle noted, the Pythagorean view of the astronomical system was grounded in a fundamental reflection on the value of individual things and the hierarchical order of the universe.\n\nPythagoreans believed in a musica universalis. They reasoned that stars must produce a sound because they were large swiftly moving bodies. Pythagoreans also determined that stars revolved at distances and speeds that were proportional to each other. They reasoned that because of this numerical proportion the revolution of the stars produced a harmonic sound. The early-Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus argued that the structure of the cosmos was determined by the musical numerical proportions of the diatonic octave, which contained the fifth and fourth harmonic intervals.\n\nPythagoreans equated justice with geometrical proportion, because proportion ensured that each part receives what it is due. Early-Pythagoreans believed that after the death of the body, the soul would be punished or rewarded. Humans could accomplish, through their conduct, that their soul was admitted to another world. The reincarnation in this world equated to a punishment. In Pythagoreanism life in this world is social and in the realm of society justice existed when each part of society received its due. The Pythagorean tradition of universal justice was later referenced by Plato. For Pythagorean philosophers the soul was the source of justice and through the harmony of the soul, divinity could be achieved. Injustice inverted the natural order. According to the 4th century BC philosopher Heraclides Ponticus, Pythagoras taught that \"happiness consists in knowledge of the perfection of the numbers of the soul. A surviving fragment from the 3rd century BC by the late-Pythagorean philosopher Aesara reasoned that:\n\nPythagoreans believed that body and soul functioned together, and a healthy body required a healthy psyche. Early Pythagoreans conceived of the soul as the seat of sensation and emotion. They regarded the soul as distinct from the intellect. However, only fragments of the early Pythagorean texts have survived and it is not certain whether they believed the soul was immortal. The surviving texts of the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus indicate that while early Pythagoreans did not believe that the soul contained all psychological faculties, the soul was life and a harmony of physical elements. As such the soul passed away when certain arrangements of these elements ceased to exist. However, the teaching most securely identified with Pythagoras is \"metempsychosis\", or the \"transmigration of souls\", which holds that every soul is immortal and, upon death, enters into a new body.\n\nSome Medieval authors refer to a \"Pythagorean diet\", entailing the abstention from eating meat, beans or fish. Pythagoreans believed that a vegetarian diet fostered a healthy body and enhanced the search for Arete. The purpose of vegetarianism in Pythagoreanism was not self-denial, instead it was regarded as conductive to the best in a human being. Pythagoreans advanced a grounded theory on the treatment of animals. They believed that any being that experienced pain or suffer, should not have pain inflicted on it unnecessarily. Because it was not necessary to inflict pain on animals for humans to enjoy a healthy diet, they believed that animals should not be killed for the purpose of eating them. The Pythagoreans advanced the argument that unless an animal posed a threat to a human, it was not justifiable to kill an animal and that doing so would diminish the moral status of a human. By failing to show justice to the animal, humans diminish themselves.\n\nPythagoreans believed that human beings were animals, but with an advanced intellect and therefore humans had to purify themselves through training. Through purification humans could join the psychic force that pervaded the cosmos. Pythagoreans reasoned that the logic of this argument could not be avoided by killing an animal painlessly. The Pythagoreans also thought that animals were sentient and minimally rational. The arguments advanced by Pythagoreans convinced numerous of their philosopher contemporaries to adopt a vegetarian diet. The Pythagorean sense of kinship with non-humans positioned them as a counterculture in the dominant meat-eating culture. The philosopher Empedocles is said to have refused the customary blood sacrifice by offering a substitute sacrifice after his victory in a horse race in Olympia. \n\nLate-Pythagorean philosophers were absorbed into the Platonic school of philosophy and in the 4th century AD the head of the Platonic Academy Polemon included vegetarianism in his concept of living according to nature. In the 1st century AD Ovid identified Pythagoras as the first opponent to meat-eating. But the fuller argument Pythagoreans advanced against the maltreatment of animals did not sustain. Pythagorean had argued that certain types of food arouse the passions and hindered spiritual ascent. Thus Porphyry would rely on Pythagorean's teachings when arguing that abstinence from eating meat for the purpose of spiritual purification should be practiced only by philosophers, whose aim was to reach a divine state.\n\nThe biographical tradition on Pythagoras holds that his mother, wife and daughters were part of his inner circle. Women were given equal opportunity to study as Pythagoreans and learned practical domestic skills in addition to philosophy. \n\nMany of the surviving texts of women Pythagorean philosophers are part of a collection, known as \"pseudoepigrapha Pythagorica\", which was compiled by Neopythagoreans in the 1st or 2nd century. Some surviving fragments of this collection are by early-Pythagorean women philosophers, while the bulk of surviving writings are from late-Pythagorean women philosophers who wrote in the 4th and 3rd century BC. Female Pythagoreans are some of the first female philosophers from which texts have survived. \n\nTheano of Croton, the wife of Pythagoras, is considered a major figure in early-Pythagoreanism. She was noted as distinguished philosopher and in the lore that surrounds her, is said to have taken over the leadership of the school after his death. Text fragments have also survived from women philosophers of the late-Pythagorean period. These include Perictione I, Perictione II, Aesara of Lucania and Phintys of Sparta.\n\nScholars believe that Perictione I was an Athenian and contemporary of Plato, because in \"On the Harmony of Woman\" she wrote in Ionic and used the same terms of virtues as Plato had done in his \"Republic\" - \"andreia\", \"sophrosyne\", \"dikaiosyne\" and \"sophia\". In \"On the Harmony of Woman\" Perictione I outlines the condition that enable women to nurture wisdom and self-control. These virtues will, according to Perictione I, bring \"worthwhile things\" for a woman, her husband, her children, the household and even the city \"if, at any rate, such a woman should govern cities and tribes\". Her assertion that a wife should remain devoted to her husband, regardless of his behavior, has been interpreted by scholars as pracmatic response to the legal rights of women in Athens. The woman Pythagorean philosopher Phyntis was Spartan and is believed to have been the daughter of a Spartan admiral killed in the battle of Arginusae in 406 BC. Phyntis authored the treatise \"Moderation of Women\", in which she assigned the virtue of moderation to women, but asserted that \"courage and justice and wisdom are common to both\" men and women. Phyntis defended the right of women to philosophize.\n\nPythagoras' teachings and Pythagoreanism influenced Plato’s writings on physical cosmology, psychology, ethics and political philosophy in the 5th century BC. However, Plato adhered to the dominant Greek philosophy, and the Platonic philosophy suppressed the combination of experimental method and mathematics which was an inherent part of Pythagoreanism. The influence of Pythagoreanism extended throughout and beyond antiquity because the Pythagorean doctrine of reincarnation was recounted in Plato's \"Gorgias\", \"Phaedo\", and \"Republic\", while the Pythagorean cosmology was discussed in Plato's \"Timaeus\". The possible influence of Pythagoreanism on Plato's concept of harmony and the Platonic solids has been discussed extensively. Plato's dialogues have become an important surviving source of Pythagorean philosophic arguments. Plato referenced Philolaus in \"Phaedo\" and wrote an Platonic adaptation of Philolaus' metaphysical system of limiters and unlimiteds. Plato also quoted from one of the surviving Archytas fragments in the \"Republic\". However, Plato's views that the primary role of mathematics was to turn the soul towards the world of forms, as expressed in \"Timaeus\", is regarded as Platonic philosophy, rather than Pythagorean.\n\nAristotle in the 4th century BC rejected mathematics as a tool for investigation and understanding of the world. He believed that numbers constituted simply a quantitative determinant and had no ontological value. Aristotle's discussion of Pythagorean philosophy is difficult to interpret, because he had little patience for Pythagorean philosophic arguments and Pythagoreanism does not fit with his philosophic doctrine. In \"On the Heavens\", Aristotle refuted the Pythagorean doctrine on the harmony of the spheres.\n\nThe Neopythagoreans were a school and a religious community. The revival of Pythagoreanism has been attributed to Publius Nigidius Figulus, Eudorus and Arius Didymus. In the 1st century AD Moderatus of Gades and Nicomachus of Gerasa emerged as leading teachers of Neopythagoreanism. The most significant Neopythagorean teacher was Apollonius of Tyana in the 1st century AD, who was regarded as a sage and lived as ascet. The last Neopythagorean philosopher was Numenius of Apamea in the 2nd century. Neopythagoreanism remained an elite movement which in the 3rd century merged into Neoplatonism.\n\nNeopythagoreans combined Pythagorean teachings with Platonic, Peripatetic, Aristotelian and Stoic philosophic traditions. Two tendencies within Neopythagorean philosophy emerged, one that owed much to Stoic monism and another that relied on Platonic dualism. Neopythagoreans refined the idea of God and located him beyond the finite so that God could not come into contact with anything corporeal. Neopythagoreans insisted on a spiritual worship of God and that life had to be purified through abstinence.\n\nNeopythagoreans manifested a strong interest in numerology and the superstitious aspects of Pythagoreanism. They combined this with the teachings of Plato's philosophic successors. Neopythagorean philosophers engaged in the common ancient practice of ascribing their doctrines to the designated \"founder\" of their philosophy and by crediting their doctrines to Pythagoras himself, they hoped to gain authority for their views.\n\nChristianity in the 1st century was influenced by a Christianized form of Platonism, which had been set out in the four books of the \"Corpus Areopagiticum or Corpus Dionysiacum\" - \"The Celestrial Hierarchy\", \"The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy\", \"On Divine Names\" and \"The Mystical Theology\". Having been attributed to Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, the books explained the relationship among celestrial beings, humans, God and the universe. At the heart of the explanation were numbers. According to \"The Celestrial Hierarchy\" the universe consisted of a threefold division - heaven, earth and hell. Sunlight lit up the universe and was proof of God’s presence. In the Middle Ages this numerological division of the universe was credited to the Pythagoreans, while in the 1st century it was regarded as an authoritative source of Christian doctrine by Photius and John of Sacrobosco. The \"Corpus Areopagiticum or Corpus Dionysiacum\" was to be referenced in the late Middle Ages by Dante and in the Renaissance a new translation of it was produced by Marsilio Ficino.\n\nEarly Christian theologians, such as Clement of Alexandria, adopted the ascetic doctrines of the neopythagoreans. The moral and ethical teachings of Pythagorean influenced early Christianity and assimilated into early Christian texts. The \"Sextou gnomai\" (\"Sentences of Sextus\"), a Hellenistic Pythagorean text modified to reflect a Christian viewpoint, existed from at least the 2nd century and remained popular among Christians well into the Middle Ages. The \"Sentences of Sextus\" consisted of 451 sayings or principles, such as injunctions to love the truth, to avoid the pollution of the body with pleasure, to shun flatterers and to let one’s tongue be harnessed by one’s mind. The contents of the \"Sentences of Sextus\" was attributed by Iamblichus, the 1st century biographer of Pythagoras, to \"Sextus Pythagoricus\". The assertion was repeated subsequently by Saint Jerome. In the 2nd century many of the \"Sentences of Sextus\" were cited by Plutarch as Pythagorean aphorisms. The \"Sentences of Sextus\" were translated into Syriac, Latin and Arabic, then the written language of both Muslims and Jews, but only in the Latin world did they become a guide to daily life that was widely circulated.\n\nIn the 1st century treatises of Philo and Nicomachus popularised the mystical and cosmological symbolism Pythagoreans attributed to numbers. This interest in Pythagorean views on the importance of numbers was sustained by mathematicians such as Theon of Smyrna, Anatolius and Iamblichus. These mathematicians relied on Plato’s \"Timaeus\" as source for Pythagorean philosophy.\n\nIn the Middle Ages studies and adaptations of \"Timaeus\" solidified the view that there was a numerical explanation for proportion and harmony among learned men. Pythagoreanism, as mediated in Plato’s \"Timaeus\", spurned increasingly detailed studies of symmetry and harmony. Intellectuals pondered how knowledge of the geometry in which God had arranged the universe could be applied to life. By the 12th century Pythagorean numerological concepts had become a universal language in Medieval Europe and were no longer recognized as Pythagorean. Writers such as Thierry of Chartres, William of Conches and Alexander Neckham referenced classical writers that had discussed Pythagoreanism, including Cicero, Ovid and Pliny, leading them to believe that mathematics was the key to understanding astronomy and nature. Another important text on Pythagorean numerology was Boethius’s \"De arithmetica\", which was widely reproduced in the West. Boethius had relied on Nicomachus’s writings as a source of Pythagoreanism.\n\nIn the Byzantine world the influential professor of philosophy Michael Psellus in the 11th century popularised Pythagorean numerology in his treatise on theology, arguing that Plato was the inheritor of the Pythagorean secret. Psellus also attributed arithmetical inventions by Diophantus to Pythagoras. Psellus thought to reconstruct Iamblichus’ 10 book encyclopedia on Pythagoreanism from surviving fragments, leading to the popularisation of Iamblichus' description of Pythagorean physics, ethics and theology at the Byzantine court. Psellus was reputably in the possession of the Hermetica, a set of texts thought to be genuinely antique and which would be prolifically reproduced in the late Middle Ages. Manuel Bryennius introduced Pythagorean numerology to Byzantine music with his treatise \"Harmonics\". He argued that the octave was essential in attaining perfect harmony.\n\nIn the Jewish communities the development of the Kabbalah as esoteric doctrine was periated with numerology. It was only in the 1st century that Philo of Alexandria, developed a Jewish Pythagoreanism. In the 3rd century Hermippus popularised the belief that Pythagoras had been the basis for establishing key dates in Judaism. In the 4th century this assertion was further developed by Aristobulus. The Jewish Pythagorean numerology developed by Philo held that God as the unique One was the creator of all numbers, of which seven was the most divine and ten the most perfect. The medieval edition of the Kabbalah focused largely on a cosmological scheme of creation, in reference to early Pythagorean philosophers Philolaus and Empedocles, and helped to disseminate Jewish Pythagorean numerology.\n\nNicomachus' treatises were well known in Greek, Latin and the Arabic worlds. In the 1st century an Arabic translation of Nicomachus’ \"Introduction to Arithmetic\" was published. The Arabic translations of Nicomachus' treatises were in turn translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona, making them part of the Latin tradition of numerology. The Pythagorean theorem was referenced in Arabic manuscripts. Scholars in the Arabic world displayed a strong interest in Pythagorean concepts. In the 1st century Abu al-Wafa' Buzjani discussed multiplication and division in a treatise on arithmetic for business administrators in reference to Nicomachus. However, the primary interest of Islamic arithmeticians was in solving practical problems, such as taxation, measurement, the estimation of agricultural values and business applications for the buying and selling of goods. There was little interest for the Pythagorean numerology that developed in the Latin world. The primary arithmetical system used by Islamic mathematicians was based on Hindu arithmetic, which rejected the notion that the relations between numbers and geometrical forms were symbolic.\n\nBesides the enthusiasm that developed in the Latin and Byzantine worlds in the Middle Ages for Pythagorean numerology, the Pythagorean tradition of perfect numbers inspired profound scholarship in mathematics. In the 13th century Leonardo of Pisa, better known as Fibonacci, published the \"Libre quadratorum\" (\"The Book of Squares\"). Fibonacci had studied scripts from Egypt, Syria, Greece and Sicily, and was learned in Hindu, Arabic and Greek methodologies. Using the Hindu-Arabic numeral system instead of the Roman numerals, he explored numerology as it had been set forth by Nicomachus. Fibonacci observed that square numbers always arise through the addition of consecutive odd numbers starting with unity. Fibonacci put forward a method of generating sets of three square numbers that satisfied the relationship first attributed to Pythagoras by Vitruvius, that . This equation is now known as the Pythagorean triple.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, from the 5th till the 15th century, Pythagorean texts remained popular. Late antique writers had produced adaptions of the \"Sentences of Sextus\" as \"The golden verses of Pythagoras\". The \"Golden Verses\" gained popularity and Christian adaptations of it appeared. These Christian adaptations were adopted by monastic orders, such as Saint Benedict, as authoritative Christian doctrine. In the Latin medieval western world, the \"Golden Verses\" became a widely reproduced text.\n\nAlthough the concept of the quadrivium originated with Archytas in the 4th century BC and was a familiar concept among academics in the antiquity, it was attributed as Pythagorean in the 5th century by Proclus. According to Proclus, Pythagoreanism divided all mathematical sciences into four categories - arithmetic, music, geometry and astronomy. Boethius developed this theory further, arguing that a fourfold path led to the attainment of knowledge. Arithmetic, music, geometry and astronomy went on to become the essential parts of curriculums in medieval schools and universities. In the 12th century Pythagoras was credited by Hugh of Saint Victor with having written a book on quadrivium. The role of harmony had its roots in the triadic thinking of Plato and Aristotle and included the trivium of grammar, rhetoric and dialectic. From the 9th century onwards, both the quadrivium and the trivium were commonly taught in schools and the newly emerging universities. They came to be known as the Seven liberal arts.\n\nIn the early 6th century the Roman philosopher Boethius popularized Pythagorean and Platonic conceptions of the universe and expounded the supreme importance of numerical ratios. The 7th century Bishop Isidore of Seville expressed his preference for the Pythagorean vision of a universe governed by the mystical properties of certain numbers, over the newly emerging Euclidean notion that knowledge could be built through deductive proofs. Isidore relied on the arithmetic of Nicomachus, who had fashioned himself as heir of Pythagoras, and took things further by studying the etymology of the name of each number. The 12th century theologian Hugh of Saint Victor found Pythagorean numerology so alluring that he set out to explain the human body entirely in numbers. In the 13th century the fashion for numerology dwindled. The Christian scholar Albertus Magnus rebuked the preoccupation with Pythagorean numerology, arguing that nature could not only be explained in terms of numbers. Plato’s \"Timaeus\" became a popular source on the mystical and cosmological symbolism Pythagoreans attributed to numbers. The preoccupation for finding a numerical explanation for proportion and harmony culminated in the French cathedrals of the 11th, 12th and 13th century. \n\nArabic translations of the \"Golden Verses\" were produced in the 11th and 12th centuries. In the Medieval Islamic world a Pythagorean tradition took hold, whereby spheres or stars produced music. This doctrine was further developed by Ikhwan al-Safa and al-Kindi, who pointed to the similarity between the harmony of music and the harmony of the soul. But Islamic philosophers such as al-Farabi and Ibn Sina vehemently rejected this Pythagorean doctrine. in \"Kitab al-Musiqa al-Kabir\" Al-Farabi rejected the notion of celestial harmony on the grounds that it was \"plainly wrong\" and that it was not possible for the heavens, orbs and stars to emit sounds through their motions.\n\nThe four books of the \"Corpus Areopagiticum or Corpus Dionysiacum\" - \"The Celestrial Hierarchy\", \"The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy\", \"On Divine Names\" and \"The Mystical Theology\", by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, became enormously popular during the Middle Ages in the Byzantine world, were they had first been published in the 1st century, but also the Latin world when they were translated in the 9th century. The division of the universe into heaven, earth and hell, and the 12 orders of heaven were credited as Pythagoras’ teachings by an anonymous biographer, who was quoted in the treatise of the 9th century Byzantine patriarch Photius. The 13th century astronomer and mathematician John of Sacrobosco in turn credited Pseudo-Dionysius when discussing the twelve signs of the zodiac.\n\nIn the Middle Ages various classical texts that discussed Pythagorean ideas were reproduced and translated. Plato’s \"Timaeus\" was translated and republished with commentary in the Arab and Jewish worlds. In the 12th century the study of Plato gave rise to a vast body of literature explicating the glory of God as it reflected in the orderliness of the universe. Writers such as Thierry of Chartres, William of Conches and Alexander Neckham referenced not only Plato but also other classical authors that had discussed Pythagoreanism, including Cicero, Ovid and Pliny. William of Conches argued that Plato was an important Pythagorean. In this medieval Pythagorean understanding of Plato, God was a craftsman when he designed the universe.\n\nIn the 16th century Vincenzo Galilei challenged the prevailing Pythagorean wisdom about the relationship between pitches and weights attached to strings. Vincenzo Galilei, the father of Galileo Galilei, engaged in an extended public exchange with his former teacher Zarlino. Zarlino supported the theory that if two weights in the ratio of 2 to 1 were attached to two strings, the pitches generated by the two strings would produce the octave. Vincenzo Galilei proclaimed that he had been a committed Pythagorean, until he \"ascertained the truth by means of experiment, the teacher of all things.\" He devised an experiment which showed that the weights attached to the two strings needed to increase as the square of the string length. This public challenge to prevailing numerology in musical theory triggered an experimental and physical approach to acoustics in the 17th century. Acoustics emerged as a mathematical field of music theory and later an independent branch of physics. In the experimental investigation of sound phenomena, numbers had no symbolic meaning and were merely used to measure physical phenomena and relationships such as frequency and vibration of a string. \n\nMany of the most eminent 17th century natural philosophers in Europe, including Francis Bacon, Descartes, Beeckman, Kepler, Mersenne, Stevin and Galileo, had a keen interest in music and acoustics. By the late 17th century it was accepted that sound travels like a wave in the air at a finite speed and experiments to establish the speed of sound were carried out by philosophers attached to the French Academy of Sciences, the Accademia del Cimento and the Royal Society.\n\nAt the height of the Scientific Revolution, as Aristotelianism declined in Europe, the ideas of early-Pythagoreanism were revived. Mathematics regained importance and influenced philosophy as well as science. Mathematics was used by Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, Huygens and Newton to advance physical laws that reflected the inherent order of the universe. Twenty-one centuries after Pythagoreas had taught his disciples in Italy, Galileo announced to the world that \"the great book of nature\" could only be read by those who understood the language of mathematics. He set out to measure whatever is measurable, and to render everything measurable that is not. The Pythagorean concept of cosmic harmony deeply influenced western science. It served as the basis for Kepler's \"harmonices mundi\" and Leibniz's \"pre-established harmony\". Einstein believed that through this \"pre-established harmony\", the productive unison between the spiritual and material world was possible.\n\nThe Pythagorean belief that all bodies are composed of numbers and that all properties and causes could be expressed in numbers, served as the basis for a mathematization of science. This mathematization of the physical reality climaxed in the 20th century. The pioneer of physics Werner Heisenberg argued that \"this mode of observing nature, which led in part to a true dominion over natural forces and thus contributes decisively to the development of humanity, in an unforeseen manner vindicated the Pythagorean faith\".\n\n"}

One of its founders was the Taoist Wang Chongyang, who lived in the early Jin. When the Mongols invaded the Song dynasty (960–1279) in 1254, the Quanzhen Taoists exerted great effort in keeping the peace, thus saving thousands of lives, particularly among those of Han Chinese descent.\n\nThe meaning of Quanzhen can be translated literally to \"\"All True\" and for this reason, it is often called the \"All Truth Religion\" or the \"Way of Completeness and Truth.\" In some texts, it is also referred to as the \"Way of Complete Perfection.\"\"\nKunyu mountain in Shandong province Weihai city is the birthplace of Quan Zhen Taoism. \nWith strong Taoist roots, the Quanzhen School specializes in the process of \"alchemy within the body\" or \"Neidan\" (internal alchemy), as opposed to \"Waidan\" (external alchemy which experiments with the ingestion of herbs and minerals, etc.). The Waidan tradition has been largely replaced by Neidan, as Waidan was a sometimes dangerous and lethal pursuit. Quanzhen focuses on internal cultivation of the person which is consistent with the pervading Taoist desire for attaining Wu Wei, which is essentially unconscious action.\n\nLike most Taoists, Quanzhen priests were particularly concerned with longevity and immortality through alchemy, harmonising oneself with the Tao, studying the Five Elements, and ideas on balance consistent with Yin and Yang theory. The school is also known for using Buddhist and Confucian ideas.\n\nAccording to traditional legend, Wang Chongyang met two Taoist immortals in the summer of 1159 CE. The immortals, Zhongli Quan and Lü Dongbin taught him Taoist beliefs and trained him in secret rituals. The meeting proved deeply influential, and roughly a year later, in 1160, Wang met one of these men again. In this second encounter, he was provided with a set of five written instructions which led to his decision of living by himself in a grave he created for himself in Zhongnan Mountain for three years.\n\nAfter seven years of living in the Mountain (three inside the grave and another four in a hut he later called \"Complete Perfection Hut\"), Wang met two of his seven future disciples, Tan Chuduan and Qiu Chuji. In 1167, Wang traveled to Shandong Province and met Ma Yu and Ma's wife Sun Bu'er who became his students. These and others would become part of the seven Quanzhen disciples, who were later known as the Seven Masters of Quanzhen.\n\nAfter Wang's departure, it was left to his disciples to continue expounding the Quanzhen beliefs. Ma Yu succeeded Wang as head of the school, while Sun Bu'er went on to establish the Purity and Tranquility School, one of the foremost branches of Quanzhen.\n\nAnother notable disciple of Wang was Qiu Chuji who founded the famous White Cloud Monastery in Beijing. Qiu Chuji was the founder of the school called Dragon Gate Taoism. Qiu was on good terms with the Mongol monarch Genghis Khan who put him in charge of religious affairs in Mongol-controlled China. As a result, the Quanzhen School of Taoism continued to flourish long after Wang's death, right through to the present.\n\nThe seven disciples of Wang Chongyang continue expounding the Quanzhen beliefs. The seven Masters of Quanzhen established the following seven branches.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2196828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2196828", "title": "Rehabilitation Project Force", "text": "Rehabilitation Project Force\n\nThe Rehabilitation Project Force, or RPF, is the Church of Scientology's program for members of its Sea Organization who have allegedly violated expectations or policies. This may include members who are deemed to have hidden evil intentions towards Scientology, members who are unproductive in their work or who produce poor-quality work.\n\nThe program includes manual labor tasks and the study of L. Ron Hubbard's works. The rehabilitation program may take more than a year to complete, and the Church has been accused of overworking and mistreating its participants. Critics have characterized the RPF as a forced labor and re-indoctrination program comparable to the Soviet gulag system.\n\nThe Rehabilitation Project Force developed out of a predecessor group, the Mud Box Brigade, which was formed aboard L. Ron Hubbard's private fleet in the late 1960s. The mud box is a small perforated screening box fitted to the suction pipe in the bilge of a ship, and is designed to catch larger solid waste before it can choke the pipeline and potentially damage the pump. The Mud Box Brigade was assigned to clean out the mud box as well as fuel lines, water hues, bilges and other parts of the fleet's ships.\n\nHubbard defined the role as being essentially a punishment duty for unsatisfactory workers: \"More candidates will be appointed regularly and promptly every time I find a freeloader who is loafing on post and drifting with the wind.\" Hubbard later clarified that \"(T)his group is the most downstat [unproductive] and one gets assigned to it by being a freeloader, invisible on post, loafing and really goofing up on one's job.\" Religious scholar J. Gordon Melton, however, suggested that \"Hubbard understood it in terms of making retribution to the people who had been harmed by the nonperformance or incorrect performance of one's assigned tasks.\"\n\nIn 1969, Hubbard replaced the Mud Box Brigade with the Rehabilitation Unit, again intended for those removed or disciplined \"as ineffective or trouble.\" Following an evaluation, the individual was to receive a set of \"specific recommendations which if followed will rehabilitate the individual as a highly effective and worthwhile Sea Org member.\" Hubbard instructed that \"(T)he unit is [to be] worked hard during the day on a rigorous schedule on jobs assigned by the Review Chief handling corrective areas and jobs needing remedy and repair. The Unit itself is thus made into an effective ship's review team. It works on a one job, one time, one place formula completing each job before moving into the next. Each individual thus earns the right to the remedial services he or she will receive.\"\n\nFinally, the Rehabilitation Unit was replaced in January 1974 with the Rehabilitation Project Force, or RPF. According to Hubbard, \"the RPF has been created by the Commodore [Hubbard] so that redemption can occur. That is basically its only purpose.\" He identified four categories of people who were to be assigned to the RPF: \"rockslammers\" (people deemed to have hidden evil intentions, as detected by the E-meter); people who were unproductive and scored poorly on the Oxford Capacity Analysis personality test; \"repeated stat crashers\", people who were held responsible for declines in Scientology organizations' productivity; and \"overt product makers\", people who produced poor-quality work. As before, the unit was to work on \"one job, one place, one time.\" A five-hour study period was to be implemented each day to improve the individuals' knowledge of Scientology. According to David G. Bromley and Douglas E. Cowan, the RPF involves a daily regimen of five hours of auditing or studying, eight hours of work, often physical labor, such as building renovation, and at least seven hours of sleep.\n\nThe RPF was originally intended to last no more than a couple of months, where the assignee would learn Scientology auditing, if he or she was not already an auditor, by the \"read it, drill it, do it\" method. RPF members would then co-audit each other to better themselves and make each other more ethical and productive.\n\nAs punishment, RPF members are often made to wear black boiler suits.\n\nCritics of Scientology, including former Scientologists, have compared the RPF with the gulag system of the Soviet Union. Leaving the Sea Org, even from the RPF, results in what Scientology calls \"freeloader debt\" or a \"freeloader's bill\": retroactive billing for any auditing received or any Scientology training received while in the Sea Org, which can run into tens of thousands of dollars. While this \"freeloader debt\" is not legally binding, many former Scientologists have reported that they felt trapped by the \"freeloader debt\" policy.\n\nIn his book \"\", ex-Scientologist John Duignan describes RPF members living in a rat-infested basement, engaging in degrading jobs for years at a stretch, while denied visits with spouses or children.\n\nDouglas E. Cowan and David G. Bromley state that various scholars and observers have come to radically different conclusions about the RPF and whether it is \"voluntary or coercive, therapeutic or punitive\".\n\nOne location, known as the Castile Canyon School or \"Happy Valley\", has been identified as a former RPF facility. It was located east of San Jacinto, California and southeast of Gold Base, near the reservation of the Soboba Band of Luiseño Indians. This site was sold by the Church in 2002 to the Soboba Band, who turned it into a resort.\n\n"}

Smith through unknown circumstances. William Gates acquired it soon after, and gave it the name by which it is known by today. Athlete Robert Garrett purchased it from Gates in 1930. In 1942, Garrett gave it to Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study. It would later join Garrett's other contributions to the Princeton University Library in 1949, where it remains today.\n\nThe text was first described by Alfred M. Tozzer in a publication from 1921. The first, and so far only, translation of the work was completed by Ralph L. Roys in 1965. Roys made his translation using photocopies provided by an employee of the Newberry Library of Chicago.\n\n\"Ritual of the Bacabs\" includes some forty-two main incantations, with fragmentary supplements throughout. Most of the manuscript is written in the same hand. In his translation, Roys referred to this main writer as the \"Bacabs hand.\"\n\nThere are intrusive passages written in a different hand on pages 20, 21, 62, and 63. Page 70 includes a medical prescription in a different hand. Of the last twenty-four pages, eighteen discuss medicine and plant lore (pp. 215–227, 229–230, and 236–237), three include fragmentary incantation (pp. 231, 233, and 235), and three are blank (pp. 228, 232, and 234). These final parts of the text and the first three pages have never been translated. It is unknown if these last twenty-four pages are written in the same hand as the bulk of the manuscript or in another. In translating the work, Roys wrote \"I do not feel competent to comment on the handwriting.\"\n\nThe incantations make several references to Can Ahau, which is either the day 4 Ahau or an alternate spelling of Caan Ahau (\"Sky Lord\"). Other \"proper names\" may really be titles. The name Hun-pic-ti-ku (\"Eight-Thousand Gods\"), which appears in the eighth incantation, may be derived from the Tahdziu deity Hunpic Dziu (\"Eight Thousand Cowbirds\") or the Izamal deity Hunpic Tok (\"Eight Thousand Flints\"), or it may be a collective term for all Maya gods.\n\nDiseases and the diseased are also personified in the incantations. In the seventeenth incantation, dealing with the \"snake-pulsation-of-the abodomen,\" the affliction is described as the son of Ix Hun Tipplah Can (\"Lady Unique Pulsating Sky\").\n\nThere are a few references to Christianity in the text. Almost every incantation ends with \"Amen,\" and the thirty-ninth uses \"Jesus Mary\" (\"Jesuz Maria\") as an exclamation.\n\n\"Ritual of the Bacabs\" is filled with symbolism that has long since lost its significance and meaning. In his \"Maya History and Religion\", J. Eric S. Thompson wrote: \"The only parallel which comes to mind of the Book of Revelation. Many plants, birds, and insects, all clothed in symbolism and allusions to lost mythology, are important features...even in translation the incantations are very hard to comprehend.\"\n\n"}

These violations include those outside the Church as well as within it.\n\n\"The Scientology Handbook\", a compilation of texts by founder L. Ron Hubbard, says \"When the individual fails to put in his own ethics, the group takes action against him and this is called justice\" and also notes that \"Man cannot be trusted with justice. The truth is, man cannot really be trusted with 'punishment'.\" \n\nA \"Committee of Evidence\", abbreviated as \"Comm Ev\", is a tribunal that deals with serious offenses. According to Scientology policy, the Committee of Evidence is only convened at a church member's request or when there is evidence of serious wrongdoing by a church member.\n\nAdministratively, the Committee of Evidence is initiated by a convening authority, usually the LRH Communicator of the organization. This person does so at the request, usually, of another church executive who makes formal accusations of violations of church ethics codes. A chairman, a secretary, and two to five other members are chosen by the convening authority who must be \"senior\" to the accused. Their task is to read and hear evidence for and against the accused church member. They have two weeks to complete the Committee of Evidence. Committee of Evidence policy explicitly bars any legal representation for the accused.\n\nAfter reviewing evidence, the secretary and members vote on whether they think the accused church member is guilty or not guilty of each of the presented charges. Conviction on a charge is by majority vote. The Committee of Evidence then recommends punishment, which in principle, must be done in accordance with L. Ron Hubbard's policies. The outcome of a Committee of Evidence is issued in a document called the \"Findings and Recommendations\". All Committee of Evidence members must sign this document whether they agree with it or not. The only means of recourse are: A review Committee of Evidence, where the committee is supposed to just listen to the recordings and review the documents of the original Committee of Evidence, then issue new Findings and Recommendations, a petition by the accused church member to have the Committee of Evidence cancelled, which is directed to an executive highly placed in the church hierarchy or a Board of Review in which the charges are reviewed by newly appointed Committee of Evidence members. Both the Board of Review and the Review Committee of Evidence have the option of making new recommendations.\n\nIn a lecture given on 2 August 1970, Hubbard admitted that Committees of Evidence were very unpopular with Scientologists: \"..This, of course, requires something that is very unpopular, which is a Committee of Evidence.\"\nCommittee of Evidence members face being investigated and prosecuted by a Committee of Evidence themselves if the convening authority believes they were not aggressive enough in pursuit of the Committee of Evidence findings.\n\nA court of ethics is convened by an ethics officer or church executive senior to the church staff member being charged. The offenses being accused are of non-serious nature and the sentences are at the discretion of the person who convened the court of ethics. The court is not supposed to engage in investigation, but rather operate only on known evidence.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13050685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13050685", "title": "Siddhayoga", "text": "Siddhayoga\n\n\"This article concerns only the Tirtha lineage of Siddhayoga. For other uses see Siddha Yoga (disambiguation)\"\n\nThe Tirtha lineage of Siddhayoga is a mystical sect of Shaivite Hinduism that relies on direct experience of life-force or Kundalini Shakti and understanding of Tantric scriptures (shastras). It holds the guru-disciple relationship to be of primary importance. Shakti is said to be automatically infused into the disciple (shisya) by the Guru in a process called Shaktipat. (\"see also\" Satguru)\n\nThere are many Siddhayoga lineages and many other groups not using the name that speak in terms of the infusion of kundalini shakti. Some lineages originated from the same source, others are completely unrelated. Siddhayoga is similar to sahajayoga, mahayoga or siddhamahayoga. Similar teachings may be traced back at least to the Tantric masters such as the scholar Abhinavagupta. Shakti is held to be the energy of a universal soul, of which direct experience is available regardless of religion; thus siddhayoga is sometimes considered a universal rather than a strictly Hindu practice.\n\nSiddhayoga aims to uncover an eternal source of abundance for all to share – peace, creativity, spiritual energy and eternal soul. The guru makes this happen for the disciple. Its most important text is the \"Yoga Vani\".\n\nThe siddhayoga guru prepares the kundalini shakti which automatically gets infused in the disciple at the muladhara chakra, awakening and raising spiritual energy up the Sushumna \nVarious ancient texts discuss this effect of nearness to the guru. The \"Kularnava Tantra\" has; \"An intelligent person should regard this teacher as their preceptor by whose contact inexpressible bliss is produced in the disciple.\" and the \"Yoga Vasistha\" confirms; \"A real preceptor is one who can produce blissful sensation in the body of the disciple by their sight, touch, or instructions.\"\n\nSiddhayoga is said to be an internal transformation, allowing a person to grow more into their nature regardless of their outer path, rites and rituals; what they do and how they do it in the outer world is unique to their own individual path (dharma). One who yearns to connect with their soul or God, who strives for mental peace and harmony with all people, animals, and nature, who tries to live in balance with nature's rhythms and who aims to live purposefully will find these higher desires fulfilled in experiencing of soul and developing of inner divine love.\n\nSwami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha descended from two monastic lines. He was first initiated into Siddhayoga by Swami Narayana Dev Tirtha [born circa 1879], whose own spiritual lineage was through Swami Gangadhara Tirtha. Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha then took sannyas under Jagadguru Shankaracharya Swami Bharati Krsna Tirtha in Puri. During Jagadguru Shankaracharya Swami Bharati Krsna Tirthaji's visit to America, Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha was asked to maintain the holy seat of Shankaracharya of Puri Govardhan Mutt. Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirthaji was not keen to be bound by the obligations pertaining to the office of Shankaracharya, including administrative responsibilities. His greater objective was to spread the thought of God among all people. As a result, brushing aside the honour of and fascination for the position of Shankaracharya, he set out, proceeding to the north in the direction of the Himalayas, always an attraction to yogis, seers, and sages as the ideal place for sadhana. The King of Tehri Garhwal, appreciative of the blessings he received from Swamiji, expressed his desire to donate a vast stretch of land by the Ganga, but Swamiji accepted only a modest plot after repeated entreaties of the king. Thus, the ashrama named \"Shankar Math\" Uttarkashi was established in 1933. Later, another Math in Varanasi's Chhoti Gaibi, named \"Siddhayogashram\" was founded in 1934. Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha wrote several books such as Yogavani, Japa Sadhana, and Guruvani which were originally written in Bengali, later translated into Hindi. He also wrote a short treatise in English, entitled Who Am I?\n\nSwami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha [1888-1958] was the guru of Swami Narayana Tirtha [ -2001]. Swami Vishnu Tirtha was another disciple of Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha. He was initiated in 1939. Swami Shivom Tirtha, a disciple of Swami Vishnu Tirtha, has a website dedicated to him that explains the Tirtha Siddhayoga lineage tree in more detail.\n\nThe Tirtha lineage of Jagadguru Shankaracharya Swami Bharati Krsna Tirtha [1884-1960] traces itself back to Sri Adi Shankaracharya. In legend the lineage (parampara) began when Lord Narayana passed the eternal Vedic wisdom to Brahma, Brahma to Vasishtha, onto Shakti, to Parashara, to Veda Vyasa, and to Shuka. Thus far the lineage was from father to son. From Shuka it was passed on from guru to shishya, to Patanjali, then to Gaudapada, Govinda, Chandra Sharma and so to Adi Shankara. This began the tradition of wandering monks. Vyasa told Govinda of the advent of the incarnation of Shiva as Adi Shankara, to meet and give him sanyas diksha, Shankara's purpose in incarnating was to comment on the Brahma Sutras. Shankaracharya set up four religious seats in the north, south, east and west of India to act as a lighthouse to guide religious seekers towards the truth for the millennia to come and also set up the ten monastic orders. 1) Tirtha, 2) Ashrama, 3) Vana, 4) Aranya, 5) Giri, 6) Parvata, 7) Sagara, 8) Saraswati, 9) Bharati, 10) Puri.\n\nAs with much Hindu or Vedic mysticism, Siddhayoga's goal of life is to realize one is eternal soul and not this body. Suffering is said to be caused by identifying with body, emotions, or thoughts, rather than with true nature.\n\nThe rules of a discipline may become unnatural because they are artificially imposed: even when doing one's best to remain balanced and free one often finds oneself once again bound. Siddhayoga says that through the grace of a Siddhayoga guru all the work is done for you. You do not force anything; you are not charged anything or asked for anything by the guru – so there is no conflict of interest. One gains peace through direct experience of peace, not from intellectual knowledge of peace. Once peace is felt, the intellect confirms it.\n\nThis does not suggest people get a 'free ride' by following a Siddhayoga guru. Siddhayoga is said to be for those people who take responsibility for their lives, who are self-reliant, whose focus in life is to help others, the creatures, and Mother Nature, who aim for inner and outer balance in life, eat sensibly and healthfully, live a life of moderation and seek to be purposeful in life.\n\nOn 2 March 2001, Swami Narayana Tirtha died at Siddhayogashram in Varanasi.\n\nSwami Atmananda Tirtha, who is a disciple and successor of Swami Narayana Tirtha, is the current Mathadhyaksha of all the ashrams in India – including the Siddhayoga Ashram in Varanasi and the Shankar Math in Uttar-Kashi. He speaks and writes fluently in Bengali, Hindi, and English.\n\n\"Shankar Math\" is located in Uttarkashi, in the Himalayas (State: Uttaranchal). It was donated to Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha by the raja (king) of the region, who received blessings from Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha. \"Siddhayogashram\" is located in Chhoti Gaibi, Varanasi, and was built by Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha's disciples who wished him to live closer to them, since, in those days, a visit to Shankar Math in Uttarkashi required one to walk for 2 weeks from Rishikesh.\n\nSwami Narayana Tirtha's successor in America is Swami Sadashiva Tirtha. He speaks English, Hindi and Bengali and has studied Ayurveda, Jyotish, and Vastu shastras. He is the author of \"Bhagavad Gita for Modern Times\", and the \"Ayurveda Encyclopedia\". Swami Narayan Tirtha Math was founded by Swami Sadashiva Tirtha in New York, USA.\n"}

He was named Chhagan. His parents Deepchand and Ichhabai died in his early years.\n\nHe met Vijayanandsuri at Janiseri Jain Upashray, Vadodara. At the age of 17 years, he was initiated as a Jain monk Muni Vallabhvijay on 5 May 1887 (Jayesth Vad 9, Vikram Samvat 1944) by Vijayanandsuri and became disciple of Muni Harshvijay at Radhanpur. In Vikram Samvat 1981, he was conferred the title of Acharya on Magshirsh Sudi 5 by Sumtivijay at Lahore. He also had the title of \"Pattadhar\" conferred on him by Jain sangha.\n\nVallabhsuri was in Gujranwala for Chaturmas in 1947. Due to the partition of India, Gujaranwala fell in Pakistan. There was widespread communal violence across both nations. He refused travel by plane which was arranged by the Government of India as Jain monks do not use vehicles. He travelled by foot along with other Jains of Gujaranwala and entered India via the Wagah Border unharmed and reached Amritsar in September 1947.\n\nThroughout his life, Vallabhsuri placed emphasis on education and inspired Jains to build more educational institutions. He is well known as the founder of Shree Parshwanath Jain Vidyalaya in 1927 at Varkana Village in Pali district of Rajasthan. The seed which he sowed has taken shape of a dense tree in Godwad area of Rajasthan. He founded Mahavir Jain Vidyalaya (at Mumbai, Vadodara, Pune), Parshwanath Umed Mahavidyalaya (at Falna), Atmanand Jain College (at Ambala, Malerkotla), Atmanand Jain High School (Ludhiana, Ambala, Malerkotla, Bagwada, Hoshiarpur, Jandiala Guru) and other educational institutes. He wrote some books and religious texts in Hindi, Gujarati, Punjabi Languages. He also established Atmanand Jain Sabha. He was also instrumental in establishing Jain unity and accessibility of Jain literature.

Adam Jones made a video for the song using stop-motion animation that appears on \"Salival\". The song reached number twenty-five on the U.S. Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in August 1997.\n\nThe song makes extensive use of hemiola, a musical technique in which the emphasis in a triple meter is changed to give the illusion that both a duple and a triple meter occur in the song.\n\nThe song is cast in terminally climactic form, in which two verse/chorus pairs give way to a climactic ending on new material.\n\nKeenan incorporates into the lyrics part of comedian Bill Hicks' sketch \"Goodbye You Lizard Scum\" from his album \"Arizona Bay\" by stating the line \"learn to swim, see you down in Arizona Bay.\" Hicks appears in the liner notes/sleeve as a doctor, and a lenticular image below the case tray illustrates a large portion of California disappearing leaving only the Pacific Ocean, as is mentioned in the song. California falling into the sea is a prediction made by Edgar Cayce, also known as \"The Sleeping Prophet,\" about the end of days in which California and New York are to sink into the ocean among a plethora of other devastating weather changes.\n\n<poem>\nHere in this hopeless fucking hole we call LA\nThe only way to fix it is to flush it all away\nAny fucking time, any fucking day\nLearn to swim, I'll see you down in Arizona bay.\n</poem>\n\nIn general the song is a diatribe against celebrity culture, particularly around Los Angeles. This includes everything from the Church of Scientology (with the line \"Fuck L. Ron Hubbard and fuck all his clones\"), to possibly rappers (\"gun-toting hip gangster wannabes\"), to drug addicts, Hollywood executives and actresses whom Maynard views as scum and wishes would all be flushed down the proverbial toilet.\n\nThe title of the song is an amalgam of the words \"Anima\" and \"Enema\". \"Anima\", Carl Jung's concept of the female persona found in males, is evoked by Keenan in the lines:\n\n<poem>\nMom's gonna fix it all soon.\nMom's comin' round to put it back the way it ought to be.\n</poem>\n\nAlso:\n\nLearn to swim.\n\nIn addition to being a humorous aside, this line can be seen as a metaphoric command to abandon the materialism Keenan sees in Angeleno culture and learn to navigate the 'feminine' unconscious. The ocean is a traditional symbol for the 'feminine' (mother ocean, etc.) and also for the vast latent psychological energies postulated in the models of Freud and Jung:\n\n<poem>\nCause I'm praying for rain\nAnd I'm praying for tidal waves\nI wanna see the ground give way.\nI wanna watch it all go down.\nMom, please flush it all away.\nI wanna see it go right in and down.\nI wanna watch it go right in.\nWatch you flush it all away.\n</poem>\n\nIn this sense the 'ground' can be seen as the 'Ego' in Freud's terminology. Here the 'Ego' has become hopelessly corrupted and needs to be subsumed, drowned and absorbed by the unconscious so it can be resurrected in a new form on the shores of 'Arizona Bay'.\n\nThe occult use of the word \"Enema\" in the title again poetically communicates what Keenan believes to be the 'fecal' nature of the culture of Los Angeles that can only be cured by destructive and ultimately transformative 'feminine' energy.\n\nJust at the point where no lyrical interpretation is possible but that of a prayer for an old-testament-scale destruction of a modern-day Sodom by a great Goddess, Keenan gives the listener a hint to the metaphorical nature of the language:\n\n<poem>\nDon't just call me pessimist.\nTry and read between the lines.\nI can't imagine why you wouldn't\nWelcome any change, my friend.\n</poem>\nDuring the period the song was written, Keenan abandoned Los Angeles for Arizona – ironically a landscape with even less literal water/rain/tidal forces than Los Angeles – which is perhaps another hint that Keenan's apocalyptic deluge is symbolic: the ending of one consciousness/value system/Weltanschauung and the emergence of a new one. One possible interpretation is that the lyrics are nothing more than a description of a purely internal drama during a transitional time in the author's life.\n\nAdam Jones directed the video for \"Ænema\" which features stop-motion animation with art design by Cam de Leon. The video revolves around a humanoid figure with alien-like features. Throughout the video the character ventures through an aquatic world. A hose-like organ (resembling an umbilical cord) which squirts out water protrudes from its abdomen and fills the room in which the figure stands. Towards the end of the video a human character wearing business attire tosses the figure in a water-filled box.\n\nTool received the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance for \"Ænema\", at the 40th Grammy Awards in 1998.\n"}
