The Window forms a band encompassing Saharan and Northern Africa, as well as almost all of Asia (West Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, East Asia and much of Southeast Asia). Roughly two-thirds of the world population lived in the 10/40 Window, and it is predominantly Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, animist, Jewish, or atheist. Many governments in the 10/40 Window are officially or unofficially opposed to Christian work of any kind within their borders.\n\nThis region of the world was previously known to Christians as the \"resistant belt\", as noted by Luis Bush at the 1989 Lausanne II Conference in Manila. In 1990, Bush's research led to a meeting with Pete Holzmann, a leader of the team developing the first PC-based GIS software. They analyzed the region using a box between 10 and 40 degrees north latitude and called it the \"10/40 box\". A few weeks later, Bush and his wife Doris were inspired to rename it the \"10/40 Window\", stating that this region ought to be seen as a \"window of opportunity\". The analysis and concept was a generalization that focuses on a region, not a sharp boundary defining what is a priority, and what is not. For this reason, many missiologists prefer to use the phrase \"10/40 Window region\".\n\nBefore being called the \"resistant belt\", the Islamic portions of this region, as well as selected unreached Buddhist and Hindu areas, were referred to as the \"unoccupied fields\" by Samuel Zwemer, in his book by that same title, published in 1911.\n\nSome have objected to such a broad-brush term which seems to imply a unifying characteristic of the 10/40 Window when in fact no large area of the planet is completely homogenous in cultural attributes.\n\nThe 1990 research data states:\n\nThis research deals in overall population characteristics. The \"10/40 Window\" is a term that helps people visualize the general area of the analysis, where the above characteristics are generally true, but with exceptions proving it is only a generalization. Some examples of the exceptions:\n\nOver the years, the 10/40 Window has evolved from a specialist term used by Christian missiologists to assumed vocabulary for Christians in the West. It is an emerging term in the secular press and can be found in press style glossaries. Non-western writers and organizations also refer to the 10/40 Window. In addition, those opposed to the idea of evangelism make use of the term. \n\nThe original 1990 GIS 10/40 Window analysis produced several insights, among them showing that the nations of the 10/40 Window represented (as of the research date):\n\nThe GIS analysis utilized country-level data from the Operation World almanac, the World Christian Encyclopedia, and the World Factbook.\n\nThe first edition GIS analysis maps highlighted the three major religious blocks in the 10/40 Window, specifically the majority Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist nations. Population estimates at the time for the year 2000 (from Operation World) were given as:\n\nLater updates have been based more on census data and other estimates rather than forward-looking population estimates. The cited reference provides the following estimate of \"unreached\" non-Christian populations in the 10/40 Window:\n\nThe 10/40 Window originally encompassed the following 57 countries. An expanded list including some important nearby nations is offered by the Joshua Project:\nThese were all Old World nations (mostly in the eastern hemisphere) with at least 50 percent of their land area falling within 10 to 40 degrees latitude as of 1990.

{"id": "39709452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39709452", "title": "Acceptance of evolution by religious groups", "text": "Acceptance of evolution by religious groups\n\nAlthough biological evolution has been vocally opposed by some religious groups, many other groups accept the scientific position, sometimes with additions to allow for theological considerations. The positions of such groups are described by terms including \"theistic evolution\", \"theistic evolutionism\" or \"evolutionary creation\". Theistic evolutionists believe that there is a God, that God is the creator of the material universe and (by consequence) all life within, and that biological evolution is a natural process within that creation. Evolution, according to this view, is simply a tool that God employed to develop human life. According to the American Scientific Affiliation, a Christian organization of scientists:\n\nAccording to Eugenie Scott, Director of the US National Center for Science Education, \"In one form or another, Theistic Evolutionism is the view of creation taught at the majority of mainline Protestant seminaries, and it is the official position of the Catholic church\".\n\nTheistic evolution is not a scientific theory, but a particular view about how the science of evolution relates to religious belief and interpretation. Theistic evolution supporters can be seen as one of the groups who reject the conflict thesis regarding the relationship between religion and sciencethat is, they hold that religious teachings about creation and scientific theories of evolution need not contradict. Proponents of this view are sometimes described as Christian Darwinists.\n\nThis view is generally accepted by major Christian churches, including the Catholic Church, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Episcopal Church USA, and some other mainline Protestant denominations; virtually all Jewish denominations; and other religious groups that lack a literalist stance concerning some holy scriptures. Various biblical literalists have accepted or noted openness to this stance, including theologian B.B. Warfield and evangelist Billy Graham. A 2007 poll showed that acceptance among American Buddhists, Hindus and Jews was higher than among any Christian groups (graph below). One recent survey, conducted by physicist Max Tegmark, on \"of how different US faith communities view origins science, particularly evolution and Big Bang cosmology.\" Although \"Gallup reports that 46% of Americans believe that God created humans in their present form less than 10,000 years ago\", it found \"only 11% belong to religions openly rejecting evolution.\"\n\nWith this approach toward evolution, scriptural creation stories are typically interpreted as being allegorical in nature.\nBoth Jews and Christians have considered the idea of the creation history as an allegory (instead of a historical description) long before the development of Darwin's theory. An example in Christianity would be the earlier writings by St. Augustine (4th century), though he later rejected allegory in favor of literal interpretation. By this Augustine meant that in Genesis 1 the terms \"light\", \"day\", and \"morning\" hold a spiritual, rather than physical, meaning, and that this spiritual morning is just as literal as physical morning. Augustine recognizes that the creation of a spiritual morning is as much a historical event as the creation of physical light. [In later work, Augustine said that \"there are some who think that only the world was made by God and that everything else is made by the world according to his ordination and command, but that God Himself makes nothing\".] Three noted Jewish examples are that of the writings of Philo of Alexandria (1st century), Maimonides (12th century) and Gersonides (13th century).\n\nTheistic evolutionists argue that it is inappropriate to use Genesis as a scientific text, since it was written in a pre-scientific age and originally intended for religious instruction; as such, seemingly chronological aspects of the creation accounts should be thought of in terms of a literary framework. Theistic evolutionists may believe that creation is not literally a week-long process but a process beginning in the time of Genesis and continuing through all of time, including today. This view affirms that God created the world and was the primary causation of our being, while scientific changes such as evolution are part of \"creatio continua\" or continuing creation which is still occurring in the never ending process of creation. This is one possible way of interpreting biblical scriptures, such as Genesis, that seem otherwise to be in opposition to scientific theories, such as evolution.\n\nMany religious organizations accept evolutionary theory, though their related theological interpretations vary. Additionally, individuals or movements within such organizations may not accept evolution, and stances on evolution may have adapted (or evolved) throughout history. There is considerable variance in overall acceptance of evolution between different countries, with studies showing that acceptance of evolution is lower in the United States than in Europe or Japan (only Turkey had a lower rate in the 34 countries sampled), and attitudes within religious groups may differ somewhat between counties.\n\nIn the Bahá'í Faith, `Abdul-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote about the origin of life. A fundamental part of `Abdul-Bahá's teachings on evolution is the belief that all life came from the same origin: \"the origin of all material life is one...\" He states that from this sole origin, the complete diversity of life was generated: \"Consider the world of created beings, how varied and diverse they are in species, yet with one sole origin\" He explains that a slow, gradual process led to the development of complex entities:\n\nEvolution contradicts a literalistic interpretation of Genesis; however, according to Catholicism and most contemporary Protestant denominations, biblical literalism in the creation account is not mandatory. Christians have considered allegorical interpretations of Genesis since long before the development of Darwin's theory of evolution, or Hutton's principle of uniformitarianism. A notable example is St. Augustine (4th century), who, on theological grounds, argued that everything in the universe was created by God in the same instant, and not in six days as a plain reading of Genesis would require. Modern theologians such as Meredith G. Kline and Henri Blocher have advocated what has become known as the literary framework interpretation of the days of Genesis.\n\nAll of the traditional mainline Protestant denominations support or accept theistic evolution. For example, on 12 February 2006, the 197th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birth was commemorated by \"Evolution Sunday\" where the message that followers of Christ do not have to choose between biblical stories of creation and evolution was taught in classes and sermons at many Methodist, Lutheran, Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Unitarian, Congregationalist, United Church of Christ, Baptist and community churches.\n\nAdditionally, the National Council of Churches United States has issued a teaching resource to \"assist people of faith who experience no conflict between science and their faith and who embrace science as one way of appreciating the beauty and complexity of\nGod's creation.\" This resource cites the Episcopal Church, according to whom the stories of creation in Genesis \"should not be understood as historical and scientific accounts of origins but as proclamations of basic theological truths about creation.\"\n\nThe positions of particular denominations are discussed below.\n\nAnglicans (including the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, the Church of England and others) believe that the Bible \"contains all things necessary to salvation,\" while believing that \"science and Christian theology can complement one another in the quest for truth and understanding.\" Specifically on the subject of creation/evolution, some Anglicans view \"Big Bang cosmology\" as being \"in tune with both the concepts of creation out of nothing and continuous creation.\" Their position is clearly set out in the \"Catechism of Creation Part II: Creation and Science\". In an interview, the Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams expressed his thought that \"creationism is, in a sense, a kind of category mistake, as if the Bible were a theory like other theories. Whatever the biblical account of creation is, it's not a theory alongside theories... My worry is creationism can end up reducing the doctrine of creation rather than enhancing it.\" His view is that creationism should not be taught in schools.\n\nThe United Methodist Church affirms a Creator God and supports the scientific study of evolution.\n\n\"We recognize science as a legitimate interpretation of God's natural world. We affirm the validity of the claims of science in describing the natural world and in determining what is scientific. We preclude science from making authoritative claims about theological issues and theology from making authoritative claims about scientific issues. We find that science's descriptions of cosmological, geological, and biological evolution are not in conflict with theology.\" \n\nThe Church of the Nazarene, an evangelical Christian denomination, sees \"knowledge acquired by science and human inquiry equal to that acquired by divine revelation,\" and, while the church \"'believes in the Biblical account of creation' and holds that God is the sole creator, it allows latitude 'regarding the \"how\" of creation.'\"\n\nWhile Richard G. Colling, author of \"Random Designer\" and professor at Olivet Nazarene University, received criticism from elements within the denomination in 2007 for his book (published in 2004), Darrel R. Falk of Point Loma Nazarene published a similar book in 2004, and Karl Giberson of Eastern Nazarene, the first Nazarene scholar to publish with Oxford University Press, has published four books since 1993 on the tensions between science and religion, including his most recently published \"Saving Darwin\".\n\nTheologians of note in the denomination whose work on science and religion shows the promise of cooperation include Thomas Jay Oord (\"Science of Love\", \"The Altruism Reader\", \"Defining Love\"), Michael Lodahl (\"God of Nature and of Grace\"), and Samuel M. Powell (\"Participating in God\"). These theologians see no major problem reconciling theology with the general theory of evolution.\n\nThe Nazarene \"Manual\", a document crafted to provide Biblical guidance and denominational expression for Church members, states: \"The Church of the Nazarene believes in the biblical account of creation (\"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth . . .\"—Genesis 1:1). We oppose any godless interpretation of the origin of the universe and of humankind. However, the church accepts as valid all scientifically verifiable discoveries in geology and other natural phenomena, for we firmly believe that God is the Creator. (Articles I.1., V. 5.1, VII.) (2005)\n\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church is divided in two large categories, which might be labeled as compatibilism and dualism.\n\nOn the one hand, compatibilists hold that evolutionary science and theology are compatible and view them as complementary revelations of God. As God is the source of both his specific revelation of himself in the Christian faith and the source of the general revelation of himself in nature, the findings of science and theology cannot really contradict; the contradictions must be merely apparent and a resolution possible which is faithful to the truth of God's revelation.\nNicozisin (Father George) is a compatibilist.\n\nOn the other hand, dualists hold that evolution can be incompatible with faith. They usually argue either that evolutionary science is philosophically based on a kind of naturalism or that God's specific revelation is infallible and therefore trumps the findings of human reason in the case of any conflict between them. This is often based on a suspicion of human reason to arrive at reliable conclusions in the first place. Their stance is somewhat similar to Averroism, in that there is one truth, but it can be arrived at through (at least) two different paths, namely Philosophy and Religion.\nBufeev, S. V, is a dualist, preferring to see the spiritual level above the mechanical, physico-chemical, or biological levels; he attributes discrepancies between spiritual matters and scientific matters to be because of the purely naturalistic views of evolutionists.\n\nThe position of the Roman Catholic Church on the theory of evolution has changed over the last two centuries from a large period of no official mention, to a statement of neutrality in the early-1950s, to limited guarded acceptance in recent years, rejecting the materialistic and reductionist philosophies behind it, and insisting that the human soul was immediately infused by God, and the reality of a single human ancestor (commonly called monogenism) for all of mankind. The Church does not argue with scientists on matters such as the age of the earth and the authenticity of the fossil record, seeing such matters as outside its area of expertise. Papal pronouncements, along with commentaries by cardinals, indicate that the Church is aware of the general findings of scientists on the gradual appearance of life. Indeed, Belgian priest Georges Lemaître, astronomer and physics professor at the Catholic University of Louvain, was the first to propose the theory of expansion of the universe, often incorrectly credited to Edwin Hubble. In the 1950 encyclical \"Humani generis\", Pope Pius XII confirmed that there is no intrinsic conflict between Christianity and the theory of evolution, provided that Christians believe that the individual soul is a direct creation by God and not the product of purely material forces. , many members of the Church supports theistic evolution(ism), also known as \"evolutionary creation\", Under Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the International Theological Commission published a paper accepting the big bang of 15 billion years ago and the evolution of all life including humans from the microorganisms that formed approximately 4 billion years ago. The Vatican has no official teaching on this matter except for the special creation of the human soul. The Pontifical Biblical Commission issued a decree ratified by Pope Pius X on June 30, 1909, stating that special creation applies to humans and not other species.\n\nDeism is belief in a God or first cause based on reason, rather than on faith or revelation. Most deists believe that God does not interfere with the world or create miracles. Some deists believe that a Divine Creator initiated a universe in which evolution occurred, by designing the system and the natural laws, although many deists believe that God also created life itself, before allowing it to be subject to evolution. They find it to be undignified and unwieldy for a deity to make constant adjustments rather than letting evolution elegantly adapt organisms to changing environments.\n\nOne recent convert to deism was philosopher and professor Antony Flew, who became a deist in December 2004. Professor Flew, a former atheist, later argued that recent research into the origins of life supports the theory that some form of intelligence was involved. Whilst accepting subsequent Darwinian evolution, Flew argued that this cannot explain the complexities of the origins of life. He also stated that the investigation of DNA \"has shown, by the almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which are needed to produce [life], that intelligence must have been involved.\" He subsequently clarified this statement in an interview with Joan Bakewell for BBC Radio 4 in March 2005: \"What I was converted to was the existence of an Aristotelian God, and Aristotle's God had no interest in human affairs at all.\"\n\nHindu views on evolution include a range of viewpoints with regard to evolution, creationism, and the origin of life within the traditions of Hinduism. The accounts of the emergence of life within the universe vary, but classically tell of the deity called Brahma, from a Trimurti of three deities also including Vishnu and Shiva, performing the act of \"creation\", or more specifically of \"propagating life within the universe\". with the other two deities responsible for \"preservation\" and \"destruction\" (of the universe) respectively. Some Hindu schools do not treat the scriptural creation myth literally and often the creation stories themselves do not go into specific detail, thus leaving open the possibility of incorporating at least some theories in support of evolution. Some Hindus find support for, or foreshadowing of evolutionary ideas in scriptures, namely the Vedas.\n\nScience writers Carl Sagan and Fritjof Capra have pointed out similarities between the latest scientific understanding of the age of the universe, and the Hindu concept of a \"day and night of Brahma\", which is much closer to the current known age of the universe than other creation myths. The days and nights of Brahma posit a view of the universe that is divinely created, and is not strictly evolutionary, but an ongoing cycle of birth, death, and rebirth of the universe. According to Sagan:\nCapra, in his popular book \"The Tao of Physics\", wrote that:\nThe British geneticist and evolutionary biologist J B S Haldane observed that the Dasavataras (ten principal avatars of Lord Vishnu) provide a true sequential depiction of the great unfolding of evolution. The avatars of Vishnu show an uncanny similarity to the biological theory of evolution of life on earth.\n\nLord Rama, Lord Krishna and Lord Buddha were the seventh, eighth and ninth other avatars of Lord Vishnu. It indicates the physical and mental changes and evolution in the man from its time of appearance.\n\nSome literalist Muslims reject origin of species from a common ancestor by evolution as incompatible with the Qur'an. However, even amongst Muslims who accept evolution, many believe that humanity was a special creation by God. For example, Shaikh Nuh Ha Mim Keller, an American Muslim and specialist in Islamic law has argued in \"Islam and Evolution\" that a belief in macroevolution is not incompatible with Islam, as long as it is accepted that \"Allah is the Creator of everything\" (Qur'an 13:16) and that Allah specifically created humanity (in the person of Adam; Qur'an 38:71-76). Shaikh Keller states in his conclusion however:\n\n\"As for claim that man has evolved from a non-human species, this is unbelief (kufr) no matter if we ascribe the process to Allah or to \"nature,\" because it negates the truth of Adam's special creation that Allah has revealed in the Qur'an. Man is of special origin, attested to not only by revelation, but also by the divine secret within him, the capacity for ma'rifa or knowledge of the Divine that he alone of all things possesses. By his God-given nature, man stands before a door opening onto infinitude that no other creature in the universe can aspire to. Man is something else.\"\n\nThe Ahmadiyya movement also universally accepts the principle of the process of evolution with divine guidance.\n\nIn general, three of the four major denominations of American Judaism (Reconstructionist, Reform, and Conservative) accept theistic evolution. Within Orthodoxy, there is much debate about the issue. Most Modern Orthodox groups accept theistic evolution and most Ultra-Orthodox groups do not. This disagreement was most vociferous in the Natan Slifkin controversy which arose when a number of prominent Ultra-Orthodox Rabbis banned books written by Rabbi Natan Slifkin which explored the idea of theistic evolution within Jewish tradition. These Rabbis forming part of Jewish opposition to evolution considered that his books were heresy as they indicated that the Talmud is not necessarily correct about scientific matters such as the age of the Earth.\n\nAdvocates of theistic evolution within Judaism follow two general approaches. Either the creation account in the Torah is not to be taken as a literal text, but rather as a symbolic work, or, alternatively, that the 'days' do not refer to 24-hour periods. The latter view, called day-age creationism, is justified by how the first day in the biblical account actually precedes the creation of the sun and earth by which 24 hour days are reckoned and by how the seventh day of rest has no evening and morning. In the day-age view, Jewish scholars point out how the order of creation in Genesis corresponds to the scientific description of the development of life on Earth—the sun, then earth, then oceans, then oceanic plant life, fish preceding land-based life, with mammals and finally humans last—and in no way specifies the method of creation in a manner prohibitive of evolution.\n\nKaraite Judaism is a Jewish a movement which is distinct in that they do not accept the Talmud (a series of Rabbinic commentaries) as law and follow the Hebrew scriptures as they are written. Karaites are currently divided on the question of evolution with many or most Karaite Jews leaning in favor of Theistic Evolution.\n\nThe Samaritans, a divergent branch of the Israelites (the other being the Jews), generally accept Theistic Evolution. Samaritans do not consider themselves to be Jewish, but hold similar beliefs. The Jews, however, hold the Tanakh (consisting of the Torah or Pentateuch, plus Nevi'im, and Ketuvim) as canonical scripture in conjunction with the Oral Law as compiled in the Talmud, while the Samaritan's canonical scriptures consists only of the Torah (a slightly differing Pentateuch, i.e. the Five Books of Moses), but exclude both Nevi'im and Ketuvim, as well as excluding the Talmud.\n\nPantheists (for instance in Naturalistic Pantheism) may view natural processes, including evolution, as work or emanations from the impersonal, non-anthropomorphic deity.\n\nAlthough evolutionary biologists have often been agnostics (most notably Thomas Huxley and Charles Darwin) or atheists (most notably Richard Dawkins), from the outset many have had a belief in some form of theism. These have included Alfred Russel Wallace (1823–1913), who in a joint paper with Charles Darwin in 1858, proposed the theory of evolution by natural selection. Wallace, in his later years, was effectively a deist who believed that \"the unseen universe of Spirit\" had interceded to create life as well as consciousness in animals and (separately) in humans. Darwin had a longstanding close friendship with the American botanist Asa Gray who was a leading supporter of Darwin's theory, and a devout Presbyterian. Gray wrote a series of essays on the relationship of natural selection to religious belief and natural theology, and supported the views of theologians who said that design through evolution was inherent in all forms of life. Darwin had Gray and Charles Kingsley in mind when he wrote that \"It seems to me absurd to doubt that a man may be an ardent theist & an evolutionist\".\n\nAn early example of this kind of approach came from computing pioneer Charles Babbage who published his unofficial \"Ninth Bridgewater Treatise\" in 1837, putting forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator, making laws (or programs) which then produced species at the appropriate times, rather than continually interfering with \"ad hoc\" miracles each time a new species was required.\n\nPierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881–1955) was a noted geologist and paleontologist as well as a Jesuit Priest who wrote extensively on the subject of incorporating evolution into a new understanding of Christianity. Initially suppressed by the Roman Catholic Church, his theological work has had considerable influence and is widely taught in Catholic and most mainline Protestant seminaries.\n\nBoth Ronald Fisher (1890–1962) and Theodosius Dobzhansky (1900–1975), were Christians and architects of the modern evolutionary synthesis. Dobzhansky, a Russian Orthodox, wrote a famous 1973 essay entitled \"Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution\" espousing evolutionary creationism:\n\nIn the realm of biology and theology, the saying coined by Thomas Jay Oord is perhaps appropriate: \"The Bible tells us how to find abundant life, not the details of how life became abundant.\"\n\nContemporary biologists and geologists who are Christians and theistic evolutionists include:\n\nPhilosophers, theologians, and physical scientists who have supported the evolutionary creationist model include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In particular, the Council of Trent defined a dogma that it is forbidden to baptize a person who is already baptized, because the first baptism would make an indelible mark on the soul. Likewise, \"Methodist theologians argued that since God never abrogated a covenant made and sealed with proper intentionality, rebaptism was never an option, unless the original baptism had been defective by not having been made in the name of the Trinity.\" Therefore, in cases where the validity of a baptism is in doubt, a \"conditional\" baptism may be performed.\n\nSuch uncertainty may result from questions about whether the Triune name of God was used by the person administering the baptism. In some cases, there are doubts about whether a church from which someone is converting baptizes in a valid manner. For example, the Catholic Church has said that the validity of baptisms in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (which does not practice conditional baptism) and in some other communions is doubtful. It is an issue where an infant is a foundling, and it is not known whether the child had been baptized before abandonment. Another example of a case requiring conditional baptism is when an emergency baptism has been performed using impure water. Then, the validity of the baptism is in question. In that case, a conditional baptism is later performed by an ordinary minister of the sacrament with certainly valid matter.\n\nIn a typical baptism, the minister of the sacrament (in the Catholic Church usually a deacon or a priest, but sometimes, especially when the baptized is in imminent danger of death, a lay person or even a non-Christian) says\n\nwhile pouring water upon the head of the one being baptized, or immersing him or her in water. In a conditional baptism, the minister of the sacrament says\n\nOnly the living can be recipients of Sacraments. Thus, if it is uncertain whether the baptizand is dead (\"i.e.\", his soul has parted from the body; this is the case for the first few hours or so after death in the modern sense), the formula is \"If you are alive, I baptize [...]\". In severe cases of birth anomaly, the (practically, always emergency) baptism formula is \"If you are a human being, I baptize [...]\".\n\nLikewise, if an emergency baptism has been performed over a part of the body other than the head (practically: during birth), or on a pregnant woman's womb (for the unborn child), the child is to be conditionally rebaptized (with the usual \"if you are not baptized\") even though the emergency baptisms \"should\" be performed in this way if necessary.\n"}

The palms or the fingertips (if the palms don't reach) should be rested on either side of the body. The upper-body should be extending upward through the crown of the head, and the back should be completely perpendicular to the ground (as though sitting against a wall). If this is not possible, one may want to use a block underneath one's sitting bones to reduce the intensity in the hamstring muscles. The entire core should be engaged and ujjayi breath active throughout this asana. The legs should be squeezing together, and the toes should be pointing inwards toward the body. It may even be possible to create space between the heels and the ground by activating the leg muscles.\n\nThis asana is usually followed by Paschimottanasana (forward fold).\n\nThis asana is believed to help improve digestion, prevent sciatic pain, stretch and activate the muscles of the legs, and prevent tiredness in the feet and calf-muscles.\n\n\n\n"}

The symbiotic relationship between an egregore and its group has been compared to the more recent, non-occult concepts of the corporation (as a legal entity) and the meme.\n\nThe first author to adapt \"egregore\" in a modern language seems to be the French poet Victor Hugo, in \"La Légende des siècles\" (\"The Legend of the Ages\"), First Series, 1859, where he uses the word \"égrégore\" first as an adjective, then as a noun, while leaving the meaning obscure. The author seems to have needed a word rhyming with words ending in the sound \"or\". It would not be the only example of word creation by Victor Hugo. However, the word is the normal form that the Greek word ἑγρήγορος (Watcher) would take in French. This was the term used in the Book of Enoch for great angel-like spirits.\n\nEliphas Lévi, in \"Le Grand Arcane\" (\"The Great Mystery\", 1868) identifies \"egregors\" with the tradition concerning the \"Watchers\", the fathers of the nephilim, describing them as \"terrible beings\" that \"crush us without pity because they are unaware of our existence.\"\n\nThe concept of the egregore as a group thoughtform was developed in works of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the Rosicrucians and has been referenced by writers such as Valentin Tomberg, notably in his anonymously-penned book \"Meditations on the Tarot.\"\n\nA well known concept of the egregore is the GOTOS of the Fraternitas Saturni.\n\nGaetan Delaforge, in \"Gnosis\" magazine in 1987, defines an egregore as a kind of group mind that is created when people consciously come together for a common purpose.\n\nThe concept was featured in \"Corporate Metabolism\" series of articles by Paco Xander Nathan, which were published in 2001.\n\nThe notion of \"egregor\" also appears in Daniil Andreyev's \"Roza Mira\", where it represents the shining cloud-like spirit associated with the Church.\n\nEgregore is also used in relation to the Montreal Surrealists, best known as Les Automatistes, in Ray Ellenwood's \"Egregore: a history of the Montréal automatist movement\".\n\nEgregore is also the term for the spiritual personification of each nation in the UK LRP game Empire, run by Profound Decisions.\n\n\n"}

The Constitution declares that Islam is the state religion, and that Shari'a (Islamic law) is the source of all legislation. Government policy continued to contribute to the generally free practice of religion; however, there were some restrictions. Muslims and followers of religious groups other than Islam are free to worship according to their beliefs, but the Government prohibits conversion from Islam and the proselytization of Muslims. Although relations among religious groups continued to contribute to religious freedom, there were some reports of societal abuses and discrimination based on religious belief or practice. There were isolated attacks on Jews and some prominent Zaydi Muslims felt targeted by government entities for their religious affiliation. Government military reengagement in the Saada governorate caused political, tribal, and religious tensions to reemerge in January 2007, following the third military clash with rebels associated with the al-Houthi family, who adhere to the Zaydi school of Shi'a Islam.\n\nVirtually all citizens are Muslims, either belonging to the Zaydi order of Shi'a Islam (45%-50%) or to the Shafa'i order of Sunni Islam (55-50%).\nJews are the only indigenous religious minority. Nearly all of the country's once-sizable Jewish population has emigrated. Fewer than 500 Jews remain in the country. There are 3,000 Christians throughout the country, most of whom are refugees or temporary foreign residents.\n\nThe Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice; however, there were some restrictions. The Constitution declares that Islam is the state religion and that Shari'a is the source of all legislation. Followers of religious groups other than Islam are free to worship according to their beliefs and to wear religiously distinctive ornaments or dress; however, Shari'a forbids conversion and prohibits non-Muslims from proselytizing, and the Government enforces this prohibition. The Government requires permission for the construction of new places of worship and prohibits non-Muslims from holding elected office.\n\nThe Government issues residence visas to priests so that they may provide for their community's religious needs. Christian clergy, who ministered to the foreign community, were employed in teaching, social services, and health care.\n\nThe country maintains regular diplomatic relations with the Vatican.\n\nThe Government does not maintain records of an individual's religious identity, and there is no law that requires religious groups to register with the state; however, the General Election Committee has adopted a policy barring all non-Muslims from running for Parliament. Chapter 2, Article 106 of the Constitution further notes that the President of the Republic must \"practice his Islamic duties.\"\n\nPublic schools provide instruction in Islam but not in other religions; however, Muslim citizens can attend private schools that do not teach Islam. Almost all non-Muslim students in the country are foreigners and attend private schools.\n\nThe Muslim holy days of Eid al-Adha, Muharram, and Eid al-Fitr are public holidays.\n\nPublic schools provide instruction in Islam but not in other religions, although Muslim citizens are allowed to attend private schools that do not teach Islam. In an effort to curb ideological and religious extremism in schools, the government does not permit any courses outside of the officially approved curriculum to be taught in private and national schools. Because the government is concerned that unlicensed religious schools deviate from formal educational requirements and promote militant ideology, it has closed more than 4,500 of these institutions and deported foreign students studying there.\n\nGovernment policy and practice contributed to the generally free practice of religion; however, there were some restrictions.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the Government engaged in efforts to ease religious tension between it and some members of the Zaydi-Shi'a establishment; however, public tension reemerged in January 2007, most notably in the media, as a result of government action against the al-Houthi group's armed insurrection. The Government maintains that the al-Houthis are adherents of Twelver Shi'ism, a variant of Shi'ism which differs from that of the country's predominant Zaydi-Shi'a. The al-Houthis and the Shabab follow the teachings of the late rebel cleric Hussein Badr Eddine al-Houthi, who was killed during a ten-week rebellion that he led in June 2004 against the Government in Saada. Some Zaydis reported harassment and discrimination by the Government because they were suspected of sympathizing with the al-Houthis. However, it appears the Government's actions against the group were probably politically, not religiously, motivated.\n\nGovernment actions to counter an increase in political violence in Saada restricted some practice of religion. In January 2007, for the third year, the Government banned the celebration of the Shi'a holy day Eid al-Ghadeer in parts of the Saada governorate. During the reporting period, the Government also reportedly intensified its efforts to stop the growth of the al-Houthis' popularity by limiting the hours that mosques were permitted to be open to the public. The Government closed down what it claimed to be extremist Shi'a religious institutes, reassigning imams who were thought to espouse radical doctrine, and increasing surveillance of mosque sermons. The Government abolished the Zaydi-affiliated al-Haq political party in March 2007, reportedly for not meeting political party law requirements. Many members of the party, however, believed the party was inappropriately dissolved because of its links to the al-Houthis and Shabab movement.\n\nThe Government prohibits the proselytization of Muslims. During the period covered by this report, there were reports of persons being temporarily detained for possession of religious materials with the intent to proselytize.\n\nUnder Shari'a, as applied in the country, the conversion of a Muslim to another religion is considered apostasy, which the Government interprets as a crime punishable by death. During the period covered by this report, there were no reported cases in which persons were charged with apostasy or prosecuted for it by government authorities.\n\nThe Government did not allow the building of new public places of worship without previous authorization. Roman Catholic officials at the end of this reporting period, like last year, were still waiting for a decision from the Government on whether it would allow an officially recognized Roman Catholic establishment to be built in Sana'a. Church officials did not attribute government inaction to discrimination.\n\nWeekly services for Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Ethiopian Orthodox Christians were held throughout Sana'a, Aden, and other cities without government interference. Throughout the country, Christian and Jewish services were held regularly in private homes or facilities, such as schools, without harassment, and such facilities appeared adequate to accommodate the small numbers involved.\n\nThe ruling General People's Congress (GPC) and the Islah opposition party both drew on Islam as a basis for law in their platforms. The ruling GPC did not exclude members of any religion from its membership. Islah required that a member must be \"committed\" to Islamic teachings. There were other minor political parties that were said to be Islamic in nature, although it was not clear if they restricted their membership to Muslims.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the Government continued its efforts to prevent the politicization of mosques and schools, and to curb extremism, and increase tolerance. The Government's efforts concentrated on monitoring mosques for sermons that incite violence or other political statements that it considered harmful to public security. Private Islamic organizations could maintain ties to international Islamic organizations; however, the Government sporadically monitored their activities through the police and intelligence authorities.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the Government also continued efforts to close unlicensed schools and religious centers. By the end of the period covered by this report, more than 4,500 unlicensed religious schools and institutions were closed. The Government expressed concern that these schools deviated from formal educational requirements and promoted militant ideology. The Government also deported some foreign students found studying in unlicensed religious schools. The Government prohibited private and national schools from teaching courses outside of the officially approved curriculum. The purpose of these actions was to curb ideological and religious extremism in schools.\n\nThere were reports that both the Ministry of Culture and the Political Security Office (PSO) monitored and sometimes removed books that espoused Zaydi-Shi'a Islamic doctrine from store shelves after publication. There were also credible reports from Zaydi scholars and politicians that authorities banned the publishing of some materials that promoted Zaydi-Shi'a Islam. The Government denied that the media was subject to censorship by any security apparatus.\n\nGovernment policy does not prohibit or provide punishment for the possession of non-Islamic religious literature; however, on occasion there were credible reports that persons were harassed by members of the PSO, an organization which reports directly to the president's office, and by police for possessing such literature. There were also reports that some members of the PSO monitored, harassed, and occasionally censored the mail of missionary groups and those associated with them, ostensibly to prevent proselytizing.\n\nFollowing the unification of North and South Yemen in 1990, owners of property expropriated by the communist government of the former People's Democratic Republic of Yemen were invited to seek restitution of their property; however, implementation has been extremely limited, and very few properties have been returned to previous owners. In exchange for its confiscated property, the Catholic Church requested from the Government a small plot of land in Sana'a on which to build a Catholic establishment. The Church was awaiting action on the request at the end of the period covered by this report.\n\nThe Constitution declares that Islamic Shari'a is the source of all legislation. Some local customs, believed to be part of Shari'a as practiced in the country, are codified in various laws and policies. Some of these laws discriminate against women and persons of other religious groups.\n\nAccording to the Government's interpretation of Shari'a, Muslim women are not permitted to marry outside of Islam. Under 1992 Personal Status Law No. 20, men are permitted to marry as many as four wives, although very few do so. The law also forbids men from marrying non-Muslims (except for Jews and Christians) or apostates (those who have renounced Islam).\n\nDuring the reporting period, security officials arbitrarily arrested and detained some individuals suspected of proselytizing and looking for H.A.Lutf Alshabi for the same reason. There was also a credible newspaper report that claimed security officials harassed and detained a Muslim carrying missionary publications in Taiz. Unconfirmed reports attributed such incidents to followers of conservative Salafi Islamic doctrine within the security apparatus.\n\nSince 2001 the Government has detained several hundred Islamists who returned to Yemen from Afghanistan and/or Iraq \"for questioning.\" Although most persons were released within days, some reportedly continued to be detained beyond the maximum detention period as terrorist or security suspects.\n\nIn May 2006 President Ali Abdullah Saleh pardoned two imams, Yahia Hussein al-Dailami, who was sentenced to death, and Muhammed Ahmad Miftah, who was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment. The two were originally convicted of establishing contacts with Iran for the purpose of harming the country. The two men publicly opposed the Government's action in Saada and formed the Sana'a Youth Organization, a Zaydi religious-based group that supported the al-Houthis. Both men maintained that they only advocated peaceful dissent against government action in Saada.\n\nDuring the same month, the Government released more than 200 al-Houthi rebel detainees in an amnesty. It was unclear how many of those detained participated in the renewed March 2005 rebellion against the Government. Although some of those detained were held for their support of the al-Houthis' religious teachings, the arrests appeared to have been more politically than religiously motivated.\n\nThere were no reports of forced religious conversion, including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such children to be returned to the United States.\n\nAs part of its campaign against religious extremism, the Government also took action to improve conditions that affected societal attitudes on religious freedom. In May 2006 the Ministry of Endowment and Religious Guidance conducted a six-day training course for 500 imams to promote principles of moderation and religious tolerance. The Government continued to support this campaign and planned for similar programs in the future, under the Ministry of Endowment and Religious Guidance.\n\nThere were some reports of societal abuses and discrimination based on religious belief or practice, but a general sense of religious freedom persisted. Religious minorities generally lived in harmony with their Muslim neighbors.\n\nIsolated attacks in recent years by anti-Jewish extremists have convinced most of the country's Jews to relocate to the town of Raida for safety and to sustain their community. The Saada Jewish community was displaced by fighting to Sana'a.\n\nThere were no reported incidents of violence or discrimination between the adherents of Zaydi and Shafa'i Islam, the two main orders of Islam practiced in the country.\n\nReligiously motivated violence was neither incited nor tolerated by the Islamic clergy, except for a small, politically motivated clerical minority, often with ties to foreign extremist elements.\n\nDuring the reporting period, there were sporadic reports of violence initiated by Salafi elements attempting to take control of moderate and Sufi mosques around the country. There were also unconfirmed reports that followers of Ismaili Islamic teachings were occasionally harassed and forbidden entry to mosques affiliated with Salafi followers.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1310058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1310058", "title": "Islam in Mali", "text": "Islam in Mali\n\nMuslims currently make up approximately 95 percent of the population of Mali. The majority of Muslims in Mali are Malikite Sunni, influenced with Sufism. Ahmadiyya and Shia branches are also present.\n\nDuring the 9th century, Muslim Berber and Tuareg merchants brought Islam southward into West Africa. Islam also spread in the region by the founders of Sufi brotherhoods (tariqah). Conversion to Islam linked the West African savannah through belief in one God and similar new forms of political, social and artistic accoutrements. Cities including Timbuktu, Gao and Kano soon became international centers of Islamic learning.\n\nThe most significant of the Mali kings was Mansa Musa (1312–1337), who expanded Mali influence over the large Niger city-states of Timbuktu, Gao, and Djenné. Mansa Musa was a devout Muslim who was reported to have built various major mosques throughout the Mali sphere of influence; his gold-laden pilgrimage to Mecca made him a well-known figure in the historical record.\n\nIslam as practiced in the country until recently was reported to be relatively tolerant and adapted to local conditions. Women participated in economic and political activity, engaged in social interaction, and generally did not wear veils. Islam in Mali has absorbed mystical elements, ancestor veneration and the African Traditional Religion that still thrive. Many aspects of Malian traditional society encourage norms consistent with democratic citizenship, including tolerance, trust, pluralism, the separation of powers and the accountability of the leader to the governed.\n\nRelations between the Muslim majority and the Christian and other religious minorities—including practitioners of African Traditional Religion were reported to be generally stable until recently, although there have been several cases of instability and tension in the past. It is relatively common to find adherents of a variety of faiths within the same family. Many followers of one religion usually attend religious ceremonies of other religions, especially weddings, baptisms, and funerals.\n\nSince the 2012 imposition of Sharia rule in northern parts of the country, persecution of Christians in the north increased significantly and was described as severe by Open Doors which publishes the Christian persecution index; Mali appears as number 7 in the 2013 index list.\n\nImplementation of Sharia in the rebel-controlled north included banning of music, cutting off of hands or feet of thieves, stoning of adulterers and public whipping of smokers, alcohol drinkers and women who are not properly dressed. In 2012, several Islamic sites in Mali were destroyed or damaged by vigilante activists linked to Al Qaeda which claimed that the sites represented \"idol worship\".\n\nThere are foreign Islamic preachers that operate in the north of the country, while mosques associated with Dawa (an Islamist group) are located in Kidal, Mopti, and Bamako. The organization Dawa has gained adherents among the Bellah, who were once the slaves of the Tuareg nobles, and also among unemployed youth. The interest these groups have in Dawa is based on a desire to dissociate themselves from their former masters, and to find a source of income for the youth. The Dawa sect has a strong influence in Kidal, while the Wahabi movement has been reported to be steadily growing in Timbuktu. The country's traditional approach to Islam is relatively moderate, as reflected in the ancient manuscripts from the former University of Timbuktu.\n\nIn August 2003, a conflict erupted in the village of Yerere in Western Mali when traditional Sunni practitioners attacked Wahhabi Sunnis, who were building an authorized mosque.\n\nOther foreign missionary groups are Christian groups that are based in Europe and engaged in development work, primarily the provision of health care and education.\n\nThe constitution provides for freedom of religion and does not permit any form of religious discrimination or intolerance by the government or individual persons. There is no state religion as the constitution defines the country as a secular state and allows for religious practices that do not pose a threat to social stability and peace.\n\nThe government requires that all public associations, including religious associations, register with the government. However, registration confers no tax preference and no other legal benefits, and failure to register is not penalized in practice. Traditional indigenous religions are not required to register.\n\nA number of foreign missionary groups operate in the country without government interference. Both Muslims and non-Muslims are allowed to convert people freely.\n\nThe family law, including laws pertaining to divorce, marriage, and inheritance, are based on a mixture of local tradition and Islamic law and practice.\n\nDuring presidential elections held in April and May 2002, the Government and political parties emphasized the secularity of the state. A few days prior to the elections, a radical Islamic leader called on Muslims to vote for former Prime Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta. The High Council of Islam, the most senior Islamic body in the country, severely criticized the statement and reminded all citizens to vote for the candidate of their choice.\n\nIn January 2002, the High Council was created to coordinate religious affairs for the entire Muslim community and standardize the quality of preaching in mosques. All Muslim groups in the country currently recognize its authority.\n\nExtremist worshippers of Islam have been responsible for some reprehensible acts in Mali, most notably what has been nicknamed the Battle of Gao, in which an extremist Muslim group, Ansar Dine began to destroy various World Heritage Sites. The most significant of these was the mausoleum of Sidi Mahmoud Ben Amar and in mausoleums around the capital, including that of Sidi Yahya, militants broke in and destroyed tombs.\n\nMany towns in Mali are falling victim to extremist groups’ implementation of Sharia law, by which many African cultures and enjoyments have been denied. A recent report in The Guardian revealed that extremist groups have banned music in certain regions and were known to turn up randomly in villages, armed with weaponry, to burn musical instruments and musical items on bonfires. One guitarist was threatened that his fingers would be chopped off if he ever showed his face in one town again.\nOn 18 May 2017, a man and a woman were stoned to death for living maritally without being married. According to officials, the extremists first dig two holes, one for man and other for women, and the couple were buried up to their necks and then four extremists started throwing stones on them and continued throwing until they died from their wounds. Public were invited to take part in this stoning. The couple were accused of violating Islamic law by living together without marriage.\n\n"}

{"id": "11554928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11554928", "title": "Jnana Vigraham", "text": "Jnana Vigraham\n\nJñāna Vigraham is a distinctively styled statue of the revered saint Sree Nārāyana Guru. In Sanskrit, the word \"Jñāna\" means knowledge, and \"Vigraham\" is the common term for statue (or embodiment). The name Jñāna Vigraham signifies \"embodiment of knowledge\". The first such statue was carved in wood and portrays facial likeness to Nārāyana Guru. \n\nThe overall iconography incorporates aesthetic design elements, Sanskrit words of reverence, and symbolic depiction of the Guru’s spiritual reform initiative, concepts of human equality and knowledge universe \"arivu.\" The aesthetic elements of the design of a Jñāna Vigraham conform to ancient Eastern philosophic and religious iconography and carvings commonly seen across Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism.\n\nThe first Jñāna Vigraham was designed and commissioned by a private art collector and researcher of Nārāyana Guru’s philosophy and teachings. It was primarily intended as a trendsetter to improve the quality of Nārāyana Guru’s statues, kept in homes and in small chapel-like places of reverence and worship called \"Guru Mandirams'. These shrines dot the length and breadth of Kerala, the south-western part of India where Nārāyana Guru was born and lived during the period 1856 to 1928.\n\nThe Jñāna Vigraham was sculptured in wood by the sculptor Artist Mani Mesthiri of Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, during 2006-2007. The work signified the period commemorating one and a half centuries since the Guru’s birth, as well as the 75th anniversary of the annual pilgrimage to Sivagiri, the chosen spiritual abode and eternal resting place of saint Nārāyana Guru.\n\nThe design of Jñāna Vigraham incorporates three parts of its structure - the anatomical statue, the pedestal and the radiance board (\"Prabha\").\n\nThe core anatomical statue is devoid of any decorative elements. It is a lifelike figure of Nārāyana Guru, supposedly in his mid-life, in a seated posture and with hands in the ‘dharmachakra mudra’, the gesture of teaching usually interpreted as turning the wheel of righteousness. The hands are held level with the heart, the thumbs and index fingers form circles, symbolising the teachings of the Nārāyana Guru. The legs are placed in ‘vajrāsana’ an iconographic yoga posture (also referred to as ‘padmasana’), symbolising that Narayana Guru had mastered various yoga practices and endorsed Raja Yoga, which is yoga of meditation and also incorporates Hatha Yoga.\n\nThe pedestal has three front-facing panels with relief carvings. The centre panel depicts the conch and lotus, the traditional Eastern symbol of dharma. One of the side panels illustrate the historic consecration of the Sivalinga in 1888 at Aruvippuram; an action of Nārāyana Guru that broke the centuries-old tradition of such spiritual practices that was reserved as a prerogative of orthodox priests of those days. The third panel depicts the eastern proverbial blind men and an elephant as represented by Nārāyana Guru in verse 44 of the Guru’s philosophical masterpiece and scripture Atmopadesa Satakam (one hundred verses of self-instruction).\n\nThe radiance board providing the backdrop and halo for the statue incorporates decorative elements and symbolism. The overall structure of the backdrop displays likeness to the Sarnath Buddha. The lower portion of the board figures the relief carvings of two elephants in outward facing and welcoming posture signifying Nārāyana Guru’s openness to the views and beliefs of other religions and philosophies. The radiance board also has relief carvings of fluttering birds representing the Guru’s words in verse 8 of the scripture Atmopadesa Satakam. The six fluttering birds represent the five senses and the sixth sense of philosophical intuition as visualised by the designers to venerate the Guru. The relief carvings of the birds are intertwined with creepers and flowers signifying the growth and fruition of wisdom.\n\nThe Jñāna Vigraham incorporates the citation of a befitting Sanskrit verse from the ancient Indian scripture Bhagavata Purana to revere Nārāyana Guru as follows:\n\neke tvākhila-karmāni\nsannyasyopaśamaḿ gatāḥ\njñānino jñāna-yajñena\nyajanti jñāna-vigraham\n\n\"Translation: In pursuit of spiritual knowledge, some persons renounce all material activities and, having thus become peaceful, perform the sacrifice of philosophic investigation to worship You, the embodiment of knowledge.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2299263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2299263", "title": "Jon Hopkins", "text": "Jon Hopkins\n\nJonathan Julian Hopkins (born 15 August 1979) is an English musician and producer who writes and performs electronic music. He began his career playing keyboard for Imogen Heap, and has produced or contributed to albums by Brian Eno, Coldplay, David Holmes and others.\n\nHopkins composed the soundtrack for the 2010 film \"Monsters\", which was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award for Best Original Score. His third studio album, \"Insides\", reached no. 15 on the US Dance/Electronic Albums chart in 2009. His collaborations on \"Small Craft on a Milk Sea\" with Brian Eno and Leo Abrahams and \"Diamond Mine\" with King Creosote both reached no. 82 on the UK Albums Chart. In 2011 \"Diamond Mine\" was nominated for a Mercury Prize, which is annually awarded for best album from the United Kingdom and Ireland. \"Immunity\" was also nominated for the 2013 Mercury Prize.\n\nJon Hopkins was born in 1979 in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey and grew up in nearby Wimbledon. He first became aware of electronic music after hearing early house music on the radio at the age of seven or eight, and also became a fan of Depeche Mode and the Pet Shop Boys. These records inspired an early fascination with synths.\n\nAt the age of 12 Hopkins began studying piano at the Junior Department of the Royal College of Music in London, where he continued until age 17. The composers that were greatly influential to him whilst studying were Ravel and Stravinsky, and he eventually won a competition to perform a concert of Ravel's Piano Concerto in G with an orchestra. For a time Hopkins considered becoming a professional pianist, only to decide classical performance was too formal and unnerving to pursue full-time.\n\nAs a teenager he also listened to acid house, early hardcore, grunge, as well as electronica artists such as Acen, Seefeel, and Plaid. When Hopkins was 14 he got his first computer, an Amiga 500, and started programming MIDI material. By the age of 15 he had saved up enough money from winning piano competitions to buy a low-level professional Roland synth, and on this he began creating his first full-length electronic compositions.\n\nAfter finishing his final exams at age 17, Hopkins accompanied his friend Leo Abrahams to an audition for Imogen Heap's backing band. Hopkins decided to audition as well, and was hired to handle both keyboard and samples, while Abrahams was hired as guitarist. He toured with the new band for the entirety of 1998.\n\nIn 1999 Hopkins signed with boutique London label Just Music as a solo artist, and began recording his debut album \"Opalescent\". At the time he was also working part-time as a studio session musician. \"Opalescent\" attracted positive press attention upon its release, and several tracks were licensed to \"Sex and the City\". \"The Guardian\" reviewed it as \"a beautifully realized debut. Using synth oozes, phased and echoed guitars and pianos and chilled beats, his wonderful tunes drift from calm to eerie power like a restless sea. It will delight any lovers of beautiful music.\" \"DJ Magazine\" gave it 4/5 stars, and stated \"Piano, guitar strings and slow beats blend like the clouds at sunset (or an opiate smoothy) filtering in and out like elegantly wasted beauty. Darker drums add a further depth.\"\n\nHopkins released his second album, \"Contact Note\", on Just Music in 2004 while still working as a studio musician. The album slowly gained an underground following but failed to take off, and led Hopkins to become disillusioned with his solo career, and take a break from writing to learn how to become a producer.\n\nBy 2004, Abrahams had been collaborating for some time with ambient musician and producer Brian Eno. Abrahams played some of Hopkins' second record for Eno, and Eno invited him to join them for a jam session. On the first day of their collaboration they came up with some of the music for Eno's upcoming album \"Another Day on Earth\", and Hopkins became a long-term collaborator. Shortly afterwards Hopkins produced King Creosote's album \"Bombshell\", which initiated his relationship with the Fence Collective. He also co-wrote tracks with DJ and composer David Holmes for Holmes' \"Holy Pictures\" album, and remixed for James Yorkston.\n\nIn 2007, Hopkins was invited by Eno, who was producing Coldplay's upcoming album \"Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends\", to join the band in the studio for a day. Hopkins ended up staying and contributing to the album for the next year, co-producing several tracks and playing organs, harmoniums, and other keyboard instruments on others. The intro to the track \"Violet Hill\" came from an improvisation with Hopkins and Davide Rossi, the album's string arranger. Throughout this period Hopkins was periodically creating his own solo tracks, and his song \"Light Through the Veins\" was adapted to serve as the introduction to the album's first track \"Life in Technicolor\". \"Light Through the Veins\" was also picked by the band to serve as the backing for the track \"The Escapist\", which is hidden at the end of the album. \"Viva la Vida\" was released in 2008, and won Best Rock Album at the 2009 Grammy Awards and became the best-selling album of 2008. Coldplay asked Hopkins to serve as the pre-show DJ and opening act for their 2008 world tour. Hopkins toured with the band for six months through England, the United States, and Japan. He performed at venues including Madison Square Garden and the London O2 Arena, with crowds as large as 20,000 people.\n\nIn 2008 Hopkins was commissioned by choreographer Wayne McGregor to compose music for \"Entity\", a production of McGregor's \"Random Dance\" group. \"Entity\" was performed live at Sadler's Wells in April 2008 to critical acclaim. A world tour followed throughout 2008 and 2009.\n\nHopkins also has co-writing or producing credits on albums by artists such as David Holmes and Dan Arborise. He is also known for remixing a variety of artists, including Wild Beasts, Nosaj Thing, Imogen Heap, Four Tet, and James Yorkston. He was also one of the few producers chosen by Radio 1's Rob Da Bank to remix film director David Lynch's first electronica release, \"Good Day Today\" / \"I Know\", which was released on Sunday Best Records.\n\nHopkins signed to Domino Recording Company in late 2008. Hopkins's third album, \"Insides\", was released by Domino Records on 5 May 2009. It included the track \"Light Through the Veins\", which had previously been used on the Coldplay album, \"Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends\". Some of the tracks had been written by Hopkins sporadically since his last release, while others were based on the music he had composed for the \"Entity\" production. Hopkins developed an intense live show to support the release, resulting in club and festival performances across Europe and the United States. He secured supporting slots with The xx, Röyksopp, and Four Tet. Many of his live shows used background visuals featuring the animations of Vince Collins.\n\n\"Insides\" charted at no. 15 on the \"Billboard\" Dance/Electronic Albums chart. \"PopMatters\" listed the album as one of the top ten electronic albums of 2009. According to reviews, the album \"takes its cues from ambient electronica, but uses strings and piano, along with some very tasty beats and dubstep-influenced bass on some tracks.\" \"TinyMixTapes\" stated the albumstrikes me as his single most aggressive release yet. His sense of timing, the clarity of his production, and the variety of effects he employs draw you into the story that each instrumental tells. Jon Hopkins is not a button-pushing man of presets; he is a bona fide composer and a trained pianist. Craftsmanship sets him apart, and allows \"Insides\" to be as incredibly moving as it is and always will be. It will easily be one of the best electronic albums of 2009. Paul Clarke of the BBC wrote thatHopkins [is] capable of producing music as epic, soaring and emotional as any power ballad in his own way. Take \"Light Through The Veins\" for example ... a close relative of Ulrich Schnauss' \"In All The Wrong Places\", it's a majestic piece of widescreen shoegazing which grows ever more expansive throughout its entire ten-minute duration ... no amount of reflected glory could ever fully illuminate \"Insides\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> mysterious depths.\n\nIn June 2009 Hopkins was invited by Brian Eno to play some solo shows at the Luminous Festival at the Sydney Opera House. A few weeks prior to leaving, Eno asked Hopkins to join with himself, Underworld's Karl Hyde, Leo Abrahams, and the Sydney-based improv trio The Necks in the group \"Pure Scenius\", the planned finale for the Luminous Festival. They then improvised music based on pre-planned themes, putting on three 1½-hour shows in the Opera House with Hyde on vocals. Pure Scenius was repeated a year later in Brighton, when Eno was curating the Brighton Festival.\n\nIn 2009, Hopkins collaborated with Brian Eno and Leo Abrahams to score the Peter Jackson film \"The Lovely Bones.\" In early 2010, Hopkins composed the score for the short film \"Rob and Valentyna in Scotland\" directed by Eric Lynne, which won an honourable mention for the short film-making award at Sundance. Also in 2010 Hopkins was commissioned to create the soundtrack for the British science fiction film \"Monsters\", which was directed by Gareth Edwards. To create the score, Hopkins partly used string parts performed by arranger Davide Rossi and guitar by Leo Abrahams. The soundtrack album was released on 29 November 2010 on Domino Records. In 2011 the score was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award for Best Original Score.\n\nHopkins collaborated with Tunng on the EP \"Seven Gulps of Air\" in 2009, which was commissioned by designer Christopher Kelly for London Fashion Week. \"Seven Gulps of Air\" was listed as one of \"Drowned in Sound\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s singles of the year.\n\nIn 2010 Hopkins collaborated with Leo Abrahams and Brian Eno to create the album \"Small Craft on a Milk Sea\". Released on Warp Records in late 2010, the album is based on a three-week session of improvisation wherein the artists recorded about six hours of material a day.\n\nIn 2011 Hopkins collaborated with Scottish musician King Creosote to create the album \"Diamond Mine\", which featured lyrics and vocals by Creosote sung over musical backdrops arranged and recorded by Hopkins. The album was a culmination of about seven weeks of work spread over seven years of recording and collaboration, from whenever the two artists had the opportunity to get together. The album was released on 28 March 2011 to acclaim, which included a glowing review from NPR. On 19 July 2011 Hopkins and Anderson were announced as nominees for the 2011 Barclaycard Mercury Prize, which is annually awarded for best album from the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n\nAlso in 2011, the EP \"Honest Words\", a Hopkins collaboration with King Creosote, was released on Domino Records. In April 2012, this was followed by another collaboration with King Creosote: \"The Jubilee\", also on Domino.\n\nHopkins wrote the score for the 2013 film by Kevin Macdonald, \"How I Live Now\".\n\n\"Immunity\" is Hopkins' fourth studio album, released on 4 June 2013, by Domino Records. Among the artists that contributed vocals were long-time collaborator King Creosote, and Corin Roddick and Megan James of the band Purity Ring. It was recorded and produced in Hopkins' London studio, with Hopkins often using homemade sound effects or the natural sound of the room. Stated \"MixMag\", \"\"Immunity\" is an album of organic techno and exquisite mini-symphonies.\"\n\n\"Immunity\" peaked at no. 13 on Top Electronic Albums by \"Billboard\" in the United States. In Britain it was nominated for the 2013 Mercury Prize for best album. The album met with a largely positive reception among critics, receiving perfect scores from \"Mixmag\" and MusicOMH, and 4/5 from \"The Guardian.\" Pitchfork Media described \"Immunity\" as a \"remarkably visceral, sensual, confident electronic record,\" and MusicOMH called it a \"modern classic\".\n\nThe video for the single 'Open Eye Signal' directed by Aoife McArdle won best cinematography at the UK Music Video Awards.\n\nIn 2014 Hopkins co-produced the song \"Midnight\" for Coldplay's 2014 album \"Ghost Stories\", and released an EP titled \"Asleep Versions\" on 10 November. The EP includes (according to Domino Records) \"four decelerated, dreamlike re-imaginings\" of four tracks featured on his album \"Immunity\". The EP has additional vocals from Raphaelle Standell-Preston of the band Braids & regular collaborator King Creosote, and artwork from Robert Hunter.\n\nHopkin's 5th studio album, titled \"Singularity\", was released on Domino Records on May 4, 2018.\n\nHopkins has performed at music festivals such as Moogfest, Mutek, Beacons Festival, and Electric Zoo, and at venues such as Madison Square Garden and the London O2 Arena. As of 2014 he maintains a regular touring schedule both in England and internationally, playing at the Glastonbury Festival in June, with upcoming dates at the Pitchfork Music Festival, Electric Picnic and Time Music Festival and in 2015 at Wonderfruit in Thailand for the premiere of the iy_project, a collaboration with light artist, Chris Levine.\n\nAccording to reviews, \"Hopkins's aesthetic is perpetually intriguing. He transcends genres, melding digital coldness with subtle, bucolic textures; veering from skewed elegance to strange, unsettling depths.\" \"He makes powerfully emotive, instrumental music that consistently crosses genres, ranging from solo acoustic piano to explosive, bass-heavy electro.\" Also, he \"meticulously constructs lush, downtempo arrangements, blending digital beats and soothing ambience.\"\n\nAs of September 2010 his studio setup relies on a Logic system, though all his previous releases were on Cubase VST, used in conjunction with an old version of SoundForge. He began using Logic because his old system was not powerful enough to include the video for film soundtracks. His live setup includes Ableton and a chain of up to five Kaoss Pads.\n\nHopkins practices autogenic training and Transcendental Meditation, of which he says, \"For me, it's not about relaxing. It can get music flowing in a way that's really uninhibited, and I want to spend as much time in that place as possible.\"\n\nStudio albums\n\n\n"}

Josef Paul Hodin wrote that she \"worked in an Expressionist style reminiscent of Käthe Kollwitz' social pathos\". An artist at the time of the Weimar culture, she was tortured and imprisoned by the Nazis in the early 1930s, and her work was destroyed. She escaped in 1939, arriving in Manchester, England, not long before the outbreak of the World War II; she lived and worked there until her death in 1958.\n\nKäthe Fanny Schuftan was born on 12 January 1899 in Breslau, now Wrocław, Poland; her father was the chemist Dr. Georg Schuftan, her mother Else née Mugdan. The chemist Paul Schuftan was her older brother. Käthe Schuftan studied at the art academy in Breslau and in Munich; one of her teachers was the graphic designer Hans Leistikow. She then worked in Breslau and became a close friend of Ernst Eckstein, one of the leading figures in the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany, SAP, who apparently committed suicide after his arrest by the Nazis in May 1933. Schuftan subsequently moved to Berlin.\n\nIn Berlin, Käthe Schuftan and her younger sister Lotte were involved in underground activities of the SAP. In November 1933, she was detained and tortured by the SA at the former Volkshaus (People's House) in Berlin-Charlottenburg, and all the pictures in her flat were destroyed. In proceedings against 24 SAP members in late 1934, the Volksgerichtshof sentenced her to two years in prison (minus the time she had been on remand) for planning high treason, i.e. an overthrow of the government by violence. In 1937, Margot Riess described Käthe's works as expressing a \"primarily tragic, accusing attitude towards the world, with all its stark misery, agony and hardship\". In December 1933, some of her works had been included in a Breslau exhibition of what the Nazis considered \"Degenerate art\"; three of her watercolours and a drawing were confiscated from Breslau museums in September 1937. She left Berlin shortly before the outbreak of World War II.\n\nSchuftan arrived in Manchester, England in June 1939. During the war years she worked in a munitions factory. Her obituary stated that after the war she earned her living at commercial art. She had two one-person shows of her work and exhibited in group exhibitions in Manchester. Schuftan befriended the young John Milne who later went on to work as an assistant to Barbara Hepworth before making his own career. Her work was selected for the annual exhibition of the Manchester Academy of Fine Arts three times between 1940–1942. She exhibited with the Manchester Group, which included L. S. Lowry, Emmanuel Levy, Jose Christopherson (a member of the Society of Women Artists) and Emmeline Boulton at the Mid-Day Studios and other galleries. Schuftan died on 21 February 1958, sadly only a short time after the German government awarded her financial compensation for her suffering under the Nazis. A retrospective exhibition of her work was held at the Salford Museum and Art Gallery in June 1958. Her obituary in \"The Manchester Guardian\" was written by Margo Ingham, founder of the Mid-Day Studios, the Manchester Group and the Manchester Arts Club.\n\n"}

{"id": "829939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=829939", "title": "Michel de Certeau", "text": "Michel de Certeau\n\nMichel de Certeau (; 17 May 1925 – 9 January 1986) was a French Jesuit and scholar whose work combined history, psychoanalysis, philosophy, and the social sciences.\n\nMichel Jean Emmanuel de La Barge de Certeau was born in 1925 in Chambéry, Savoie. Certeau's education was eclectic, following the medieval tradition of \"peregrinatio academica\". After obtaining degrees in classics and philosophy at the universities of Grenoble, Lyon, he studied the works of Pierre Favre (1506–1546) at the École pratique des hautes études (Paris) with Jean Orcibal. He undertook religious training at a seminary in Lyon, where he entered the Jesuit order (Society of Jesus) in 1950 and was ordained in 1956. Certeau entered the Society of Jesus hoping to do missionary work in China. In the year of his ordination, Certeau became one of the founders of the journal \"Christus\", with which he would actively be involved for much of his life. In 1960 he earned his doctorate (\"thèse de 3e Cycle\") at the Sorbonne with a study of co-founder of the Society of Jesus Pierre Favre (the Sorbonne is a secular state university where theology may not be taught) before embarking on his celebrated study of Jean-Joseph Surin.\n\nCerteau was greatly influenced by Sigmund Freud and was, along with Jacques Lacan, one of the founding members of \"École Freudienne de Paris\", an informal group which served as a focal point for French scholars interested in psychoanalysis. He came to public attention after publishing an article dealing with the May 1968 events in France. He also took part in Robert Jaulin's department of ethnology at the University of Paris-VII after May 68.\n\nCerteau went on to teach at several universities in locations as diverse as Geneva, San Diego, and Paris. Through the 1970s and 1980s he produced a string of works that demonstrated his interest in mysticism, phenomenology, and psychoanalysis. He died in Paris, aged 60.\n\nCerteau's most well-known and influential work in the United States has been \"The Practice of Everyday Life\", cited in fields such as rhetoric, performance studies, and law. In \"The Practice of Everyday Life\", Certeau combined his disparate scholarly interests to develop a theory of the productive and consumptive activity inherent in everyday life. According to Certeau, everyday life is distinctive from other practices of daily existence because it is repetitive and unconscious. Certeau’s study of everyday life is neither the study of “popular culture”, nor is it necessarily the study of everyday resistances to regimes of power. Instead, he attempts to outline the way individuals unconsciously navigate everything from city streets to literary texts.\n\n\"The Practice of Everyday Life\" has been a subject of study for its distinction between the concepts of strategy and tactics. Certeau links \"strategies\" with institutions and structures of power who are the \"producers\", while individuals are \"consumers\" or \"poachers,\" acting in accordance with, or against, environments defined by strategies by using \"tactics\". In the chapter \"Walking in the City\", Certeau asserts that \"the city\" is generated by the strategies of governments, corporations, and other institutional bodies who produce things like maps that describe the city as a unified whole. Certeau uses the vantage from the World Trade Center in New York to illustrate the idea of a synoptic, unified view. By contrast, the walker at street level moves in ways that are tactical and never fully determined by the plans of organizing bodies, taking shortcuts in spite of the strategic grid of the streets. Certeau's argument is that everyday life works by a process of poaching on the territory of others, using the rules and products that already exist in culture in a way that is influenced, but never wholly determined, by those rules and products.\n\nAccording to Andrew Blauvelt who relies on the work of Certeau in his essay on design and everyday life:\n\n\"Certeau's investigations into the realm of routine practices, or the \"arts of doing\" such as walking, talking, reading, dwelling, and cooking, were guided by his belief that despite repressive aspects of modern society, there exists an element of creative resistance to these strictures enacted by ordinary people. In \"The Practice of Everyday Life\", de Certeau outlines an important critical distinction between strategies and tactics in this battle of repression and expression. According to him, strategies are used by those within organizational power structures, whether small or large, such as the state or municipality, the corporation or the proprietor, a scientific enterprise or the scientist. Strategies are deployed against some external entity to institute a set of relations for official or proper ends, whether adversaries, competitors, clients, customers, or simply subjects. Tactics, on the other hand, are employed by those who are subjugated. By their very nature tactics are defensive and opportunistic, used in more limited ways and seized momentarily within spaces, both physical and psychological, produced and governed by more powerful strategic relations.\"\n\nHis work \"The Writing of History\", translated into English after his death, deals with the relationship between history and religion. De Certeau makes a point in linking the history of writing history to the legitimization of political power and that \"Western\" traditions of history involve using the act of writing as a tool of colonialism; writing their own histories while un-writing the embodied traditions of native peoples.\n\nIn French:\n\nIn English:\n\n"}
{"id": "707122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=707122", "title": "Monsignor", "text": "Monsignor\n\nMonsignor (; ) is an honorific form of address for those members of the clergy of the Roman Catholic Church including bishops, honorary prelates and canons. In some cases, these ecclesiastical honorific titles derive from the pope, but in other cases it is simply a customary or honorary style belonging to a prelate or honorary prelate. These are granted to individuals who have rendered valuable service to the Church, or who provide some special function in Church governance, or who are members of bodies such as certain chapters. Although in some languages the word is used as a form of address for bishops, which is indeed its primary use in those languages, this is not customary in English. \"Monsignor\" is the apocopic form of the Italian \"monsignore\", from the French \"mon seigneur\", meaning \"my lord\". It is abbreviated Mgr, Msgr, or Mons.\n\n\"Monsignor\" is a form of address, not an appointment: properly speaking, one cannot be \"made a monsignor\" or be \"the monsignor of a parish\". The title or form of address is associated with certain papal awards, which Pope Paul VI reduced to three classes: those of Protonotary Apostolic, Honorary Prelate, and Chaplain of His Holiness.\n\nApart from those working in the Roman Curia and the diplomatic service of the Holy See, it is usually on the proposal of the local bishop that the Pope grants this title to Catholic diocesan clergy. The grant is subject to criteria of the Holy See that include a minimum age.\n\nSoon after his election in March 2013, Pope Francis suspended the granting of the honorific title of Monsignor except to members of the Holy See's diplomatic service. In December of the same year he communicated his definitive decision to accept no further requests from bishops for appointments to any class but that of Chaplain of His Holiness, the lowest of the three classes, and that candidates presented must be at least 65 years old. He himself, during his 15 years as archbishop of Buenos Aires, never asked that any of his priests receive the title, and he was understood to associate it with clerical \"careerism\". Grants already made were not revoked.\n\nAppointments to all three classes of awards continue to be granted to officials of the Roman Curia and the diplomatic service of the Holy See, and there was no revocation of privileges granted to certain bodies such as chapters of canons whereby all their members or some of them have the rank of Protonotary Apostolic, Honorary Prelate or Chaplain of His Holiness.\n\nAlso unaffected is the association of the style with the office of vicar general, an appointment made by the bishop of the diocese, not by the Pope. Without necessarily being a protonotary apostolic, a diocesan priest has that titular rank as long as he remains in office.\n\nAlthough in some languages, \"Monsignore\", \"Monseigneur\", \"Monsenyor\", \"Monseñor\", and the like are normal forms of address for all higher prelates of the Catholic Church below the rank of cardinal or patriarch, including bishops and archbishops, in English bishops are not usually addressed as \"Monsignor\", a title reserved in English for diocesan priests who have received certain specific honorary awards or who hold certain offices.\n\nThe written form of address for such a priest is \"Monsignor (first name) (last name)\" or \"The Reverend Monsignor (first name) (last name)\". The spoken form of address is \"Monsignor (last name)\".\n\nBefore the simplification of ecclesiastical titles in 1969, those of the lowest class were addressed in English as \"The Very Reverend Monsignor\" (in Latin, \"Reverendissimus Dominus\"; in Italian, \"Reverendissimo Monsignore\") and those belonging to the higher classes were addressed as \"The Right Reverend Monsignor\" (in Latin, \"Illustrissimus et Reverendissimus Dominus\"; in Italian, \"Illustrissimo e Reverendissimo Monsignore\").\n\nThe 1969 Instruction of the Secretariat of State indicated that the title of \"Monsignor\" may be used for bishops. This is normal practice in Italian, French, Catalan, and Spanish, but not in English. The same instruction indicated that, in the case of bishops, \"Reverendissimus\" (usually translated in this case as \"Most Reverend\", rather than \"Very Reverend\"), may be added to the word \"Monsignor\", as also in the case of prelates without episcopal rank who head offices of the Roman Curia, judges of the Rota, the Promotor General of Justice and the Defender of the Bond of the Apostolic Signatura, the Protonotaries Apostolic \"de numero\", and the four Clerics of the Camera. The (in meaning identical) predicate \"His Lordship\" or \"Your Lordship\" is, in English, used as a clerical title only for bishops.\n\nUntil 1968 there were at least 14 different grades, including domestic prelates, four kinds of protonotaries apostolic, four kinds of papal chamberlains, and at least five types of papal chaplains.\n\nPope Paul VI in his \"motu proprio\" \"Pontificalis Domus\" of 28 March 1968 reduced the grades to three. Since then, protonotaries apostolic have been classified either \"de numero\" or supernumerary. Most of the former classes of chamberlains and chaplains were abolished, leaving only a single class of \"Chaplains of His Holiness\", a specifically priestly-sounding category.\n\nThe three ranks established by Pope Paul VI are, in descending order of precedence:\n\nBefore 1968 the appointment of a Privy Chamberlain expired at the death of the Pope who granted it. This no longer holds. Those listed in the index of the \"Annuario Pontificio\" as Chaplains of His Holiness continue to be listed in the edition that follow the death of the Pope, as after the deaths of Popes Paul VI and John Paul I in 1978 and after that of Pope John Paul II in 2005.\n\nIn 2014, Pope Francis abolished the practice of granting priests under the age of 65 the title of \"monsignor\". However, existing members of all three ranks established by Pope Paul VI retain their membership. Higher ranks are still attained by virtue of membership of certain chapters of canons or because of being a vicar general, and new appointments continue to be made for officials of the Roman Curia and the diplomatic service of the Holy See.\n\nThe 1969 Instruction of the Secretariat of State also simplified the dress of monsignori.\n\n\nUnder legislation of Pope Pius X, vicars general and vicars capitular (the latter are now called diocesan administrators) are titular (not actual) Protonotaries \"durante munere\", i.e. as long as they hold those offices, and so are entitled to be addressed as Monsignor.\n\nThe only privileges of dress that Pope Pius X granted them were a black silk fringed sash (fascia), black piping on the biretta with a black tuft, and a black mantelletta. As a result of this they were in some countries referred to as \"black protonotaries\". However, \"Pontificalis domus\" of Paul VI removed this position (titular protonotaries) from the Papal Household, even though the title of \"monsignor\", which is to be distinguished from a prelatial rank, has not been withdrawn from vicars general, as can be seen, for instance, from the placing of the abbreviated title \"Mons.\" before the name of every member of the secular (diocesan) clergy listed as a vicar general in the \"Annuario Pontificio\".\n\nUnder Paul VI, the Secretariat of State set minimum qualifications of age and priesthood for the appointment of Chaplains of His Holiness (35 years of age and 10 of priesthood), Honorary Prelates (45 of age and 15 of priesthood) and Protonotaries Apostolic Supernumerary (55 of age and 20 of priesthood). However, it waived the minimum age limit for vicars general proposed for appointment as Honorary Prelates, in view of the fact that, as long as they hold the office of vicar general, they also held the still higher rank of Protonotary Apostolic Supernumerary. For the same reason, the Secretariat of State did not consider it appropriate that someone who was already a vicar general be appointed only a Chaplain of His Holiness. All these criteria have been superseded by the 2013 decision of Pope Francis to grant only the title of Chaplain of His Holiness and to require even for this a minimum age of 65 years.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2174623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2174623", "title": "Pantheon (religion)", "text": "Pantheon (religion)\n\nA pantheon (from Greek πάνθεον \"pantheon\", literally \"(a temple) of all gods\", \"of or common to all gods\" from πᾶν \"pan-\" \"all\" and θεός \"theos\" \"god\") is the particular set of all gods of any polytheistic religion, mythology, or tradition.\n\nA pantheon of gods is a common element of polytheistic societies, although not all polytheists have such a pantheon, and not all pantheons require a polytheistic worldview. The nature of a society's pantheon can be considered a reflection of that society:\n\nSome well-known historical polytheistic pantheons include the Sumerian gods and the Egyptian gods, and the classical-attested pantheon which includes the ancient Greek religion and Roman religion. Post-classical polytheistic religions include Norse Æsir and Vanir, the Yoruba Orisha, the Aztec gods, and many others. Today, most historical polytheistic religions are referred to as \"mythology\", though the stories cultures tell about their gods should be distinguished from their worship or religious practice. For instance, deities portrayed in conflict in mythology would still be worshipped sometimes in the same temple side by side, illustrating the distinction in the devotees mind between the myth and the reality.\n\nScholars such as Jaan Puhvel, J. P. Mallory, and Douglas Q. Adams have reconstructed aspects of the ancient Proto-Indo-European religion, from which the religions of the various Indo-European peoples derive, and that this religion was an essentially naturalist numenistic religion. An example of a religious notion from this shared past is the concept of \"*dyēus\", which is attested in several distinct religious systems.\n\nIn many civilizations, pantheons tended to grow over time. Deities first worshipped as the patrons of cities or places came to be collected together as empires extended over larger territories. Conquests could lead to the subordination of the elder culture's pantheon to a newer one, as in the Greek Titanomachia, and possibly also the case of the Æsir and Vanir in the Norse mythos. Cultural exchange could lead to \"the same\" deity being renowned in two places under different names, as seen with the Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans, and also to the cultural transmission of elements of an extraneous religion into a local cult, as with worship of the ancient Egyptian deity Osiris, which was later followed in ancient Greece. Max Weber's 1922 opus \"Economy and Society\" discusses tendency in the ancient Greek philosophers to interpret gods worshiped in the pantheons of other cultures as \"equivalent to and so identical with the deities of the moderately organized Greek pantheon\".\n\nIn other instances, however, national pantheons were consolidated or simplified into fewer gods, or into a single god with power over all of the areas originally assigned to a pantheon. For example, in the ancient Near East during the first millennium BCE, Syrian and Palestinian tribes worshiped much smaller pantheons than had been developed in Egypt and Mesopotamia. Weber also identified the link between a pantheon of gods and the development of monotheism, proposing that the domination of a pantheon by a particular god within that pantheon was a step towards followers of the pantheon seeing that god as \"an international or universal deity, a transnational god of the entire world\". The first known instance of a pantheon being consolidated into a single god, or discarded in favor of a single god, was with the development of the short-lived practice of Atenism in ancient Egypt, with that role being accorded to the sun god. A similar process is thought to have taken place with respect to the Israelite deity Yahweh, who, \"as a typical West Semitic deity... would have four or five compatriot gods in attendance as he became the national high god\".\n\nThe concept of a pantheon of gods has been widely imitated in Twentieth-century fantasy literature and role-playing games like \"Dungeons & Dragons\". These uses tend to borrow heavily from historical patterns. In these contexts, it is considered important for the writer to construct pantheon of gods that fits the genre, where the characteristics of the gods are in balance so that none of them is able to overwhelm the story, and so that the actions of the characters are not overwhelmed by the machinations of the gods.\n\nIn order to avoid the difficulty of giving an exhaustive list of deities when devoting a temple or sacred building, a structure explicitly dedicated to \"all deities\" also came to be referred to as a \"Pantheon\". The best known of such structures is the Pantheon of Rome, first built between the years 27 BCE and 14 CE. The building standing today was constructed on the same site around 126 CE. It was dedicated to \"all gods\" as a gesture embracing the religious syncretism in the increasingly multicultural Roman Empire, with subjects worshipping gods from many cultures and traditions. The building was later renovated for use as a Christian church in 609 under Pope Boniface IV.\n\nSince the 16th century, \"pantheon\" has also been used in a secular sense to refer to the set of a society's exalted persons—initially including heroic figures, and later extending to celebrities, generally. This practice is hinted at in previous references; for example, Jove of the proto-Indo-European pantheon (whose other linguistic forms are \"deus\" and \"divus\") meant 'god, rich man'. Lord Byron drew this connection after viewing the busts of famous historical figures in the Roman Pantheon, writing in \"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage\" of how he wished to be at the center of an English Pantheon, and thereby associated with divinity. The Pantheon \"thus imbues the modern with the aura of the divine\", and \"models the interplay of ancient and modern forms of fame\". This trend continued into modern times, with the word \"pantheon\" 'of or for the gods' being reflected in the journalistic meme that refers to financial titans as \"Masters of the Universe\". For example: Francis Ford Coppola has been described as a member of \"that revered pantheon of independent movie directors, which broke the standard Hollywood studio mould as the 1960s expired\".\n\n"}

He was hanged by British rulers on 20 March 1943 in the Central Jail Hyderabad, Sindh. His burial place remains unknown, despite requests to the British from people in Sindh.\n\nAccording to Lutaf Mangrio and Nadeem Wagan, the Hur movement began with Sibghtullah Shah Badshah I [1831-1779]. It reached its peak in the time of Sibghtullah Shah Shaheed Suraih Badshah when the Hurs became aggressive against British rule. Many were imprisoned in the Vasarpur district Ahmed Nagar.\n\nSibghatullah Shah I provided forces to Syed Ahmed Shaheed to fight the Sikhs. Since that time these people have been called \"Hurs\" [free people]. The independence struggle was started by Syed Sibghtullah Shah Shaheed Awal in 1246 [Hijri].\n\nPagaras' and their followers fought against the British for 108 years, from 1843 to 1951.\n\nIn 1922, Sibghtullah Shah II (Soreh Badshah) became Pir Pagara at age 12. He believed that British officers' behaviour towards Hur Jamat and the Sindhi people was insulting and humiliating. He resented their behaviour and raised his voice against British rule. He organised the struggle against British rulers and encouraged others to do the same. As a result, martial law was imposed to control the Hur movement. Pir Sahib established Gring Bungalow as his general headquarters. He recruited and trained followers to continue an armed struggle. Their slogans were \"homeland or death\" and \"freedom or death\".\n\nThe \"Lahore mail\" railway train was derailed by Hurs on 16 May 1942.\nWhen Hurs attacked the army and police they raised the slogan of \"Bhej Pagaara\". In an effort to rush the Hurs, their center Gring Bungalow was bombarded and destroyed on 26 May 1943. Pir Soreh Badshah was arrested on 24 October 1941 and imprisoned in Seoni in India.\n\nThe Hurs intensified their activities against the colonial government by attacking police stations, government buildings and railway stations as well as telephone and irrigation systems to paralyse society and to pressure the British to release their spiritual leader.\n\nDargah Sharif and the bungalow in Pir Jo Goth were destroyed in 1943.\n\nIn 1942 important leaders in Sindh Prant were arrested. Pir Sahib Pagara was brought from Seoni to Sindh in January 1943 and was detained in the central jail in Hyderabad. The Hurs established the Makhi forest as their base.\n\nThe Government then began air bombing Gring Bungalow, Makhi Forest and Dargah Sharif. They arrested thousands of Hur leaders along with their families and kept them in concentration camps until 1952.\n\nJail employees told the writer Nasir Jamal that they had heard from the ancestors that Soreh Badshah was buried outside of Phasi Ghat (place of execution) in the central jail at Hyderabad, Sindh, Pakistan. Because they anticipated an extreme reaction by the Hur Mujahid. The British authorities did not disclose the place of burial. They also flattened the surrounding land.\n\nDuring British rule (according to \"Voice of Sureh\" by Lutaf Mangrio and Nadeem Wagan), Pir Pagaro declared his community \"Hur\" (free from British slavery). The British tried to crush the uprising and that resulted in an armed resistance by Hurs. Ultimately the British passed the Hurs Act, where the entire Hur community was declared criminals and were ordered to be shot on sight.\n\nThe Hurs continued their struggle even after the hanging of Pir Sahib, right up to the time of Pakistan's independence.\n\nPir Pagaro Syed Sibghatullah Shah II was hanged on 20 March 1943 and the British left the South Asia four years later on 14 August 1947. After the end of British rule, Pir Pagaro's two sons, who were in British custody in England, were released and came back to lead their community. Sindh was a province in the newly independent Pakistan. The sons of Sibghatullah Shah Shaheed, Pir Syed Shah Mardan Shah Rashdi-II alias Pir Syed Sikandar Ali Shah Rashidi and Pir Syed Nadir Ali Shah Rashidi were brought to Pakistan in December 1951 after long negotiations. The elder son, Pir Syed Shah Mardan Shah-II became the new Pir Pagara on 22 February 1952.\n\n"}

The Ravidassia community began to take on more cohesion following 1947, and the establishment of successful Ravidassia communities in the diaspora.\n\nRavidassias, states Ronki Ram, accept present \"sants\" of Ravidass Deras as \"Guru\" whereas the Sikhs do not. A new Ravidassia religion was launched following the murder of their cleric Ramanand Dass in Vienna in 2009 by some radical, where the movement declared itself to be a religion fully separated from Sikhism.\n\nPrior to their break from Sikhism, the Dera Bhallan revered and recited the Guru Granth Sahib of Sikhism in Dera Bhallan. However, following their split from mainstream Sikhism, the Dera Bhallan compiled their own holy book based exclusively on Ravidas's teachings, the Amritbani Guru Ravidass Ji, and these Dera Bhallan Ravidassia temples now use this book in place of the Guru Granth Sahib.\n\nRavidas was born on 15 January 1377 CE (Indian calendar Sunday Sukhal Falgin Parvithta 1433) to the untouchable chamar community\n. His birthplace was a locality known as Mandhuadhe in the city of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh state, India. The birthplace is now marked by the Shri Guru Ravidass Janam Asthan (Begampura), and is a major place of pilgrimage for the followers of Guru Ravidas today. Ravidassia believe that Ravidas died in Benares at the age of 126.\n\nTeachings of Ravidas represent an offshoot of the \"bhakti movement\" of the fifteenth century, a religious renaissance in India. Ravidas taught the following principles:\n\nThe Shri Guru Ravidas Mission states that the conditions on being a member of the community are:\n\nDera Sach Khand Ballan of Jallandhar, Punjab on 30 January 2010 at the 633rd birth anniversary of Ravidas announced the objectives of Ravidassia religion as, \"to propagate the Bani and teachings of Satguru Ravidass. Besides, the teachings and thought of Maharishi Bhagwan Balmiki, Satguru Namdev, Satguru Kabir, Satguru Trilochan, Satguru Sain and Satguru Sadna would also be propagated\".\n\nThe Ravidassia place of worship is called a \"Bhawan\", \"Sabha\", \"Gurdwara\" or \"Darbar\". It is considered respectful towards Guru Ravidas if one covers his head and takes off his or her shoes while entering the place of worship. It is believed that everyone must follow it as a respect to Guru Ravidas.\n\nOutside the Sabha there is always a flag upon which is written the \"Nishaan\", and above it the \"Harr\" symbol which symbolising enlightenment from Guru Ravidas's teachings.\n\n\"Langar\" takes place inside the \"sabha\" continuously as a practice, all are free to partake of it.\n\nIn some Ravidassia \"sabhas\" the Sri Guru Granth Sahib is still installed as the focal point in the main worship room. The Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji is respected at all times. However most Ravidassia Sabhas have replaced it with the new holy book, the Guru Ravidass Amrit Bani.\n\n\"Aarti\" and \"kirtan\" of all saints and gurus takes place daily at the closing of the day's formal services, this consists of the famous \"Arti\" written by Guru Ravidas in which he tells God is one and equality is among all in the eyes of God.\n\nSome saints which Ravidassias refer to while at the end of every prayer is Satguru Kabir, Satguru Sain, Satguru Sadhna, Satguru Trilochan, Meera Bai, Baba Farid and Bhagwan Valmik.\n\nThe Ravidassia temples \"Sabha\" contain the holy book \"Amritbani Guru Ravidass Ji\" which contains all the hymns by Guru Ravidas. This book contains the following hymns: Raga – Siri (1), Gauri (5), Asa (6), Gujari (1), Sorath (7), Dhanasari (3), Jaitsari (1), Suhi (3), Bilaval (2), Gaund (2), Ramkali (1), Maru (2), Kedara (1), Bhairau (1), Basant (1), and Malhar (3). The book contains 140 shabads, 40 pade, and 231 salok. There are 177 pages in all of the book.\n\nA version of the holy book \"Amrit Bani\" containing 240 hymns of Guru Ravidas was installed at the Guru Ravidas temple in Jalandhar, Punjab, on 1 February 2012 on the occasion of birth anniversary of Guru Ravidass. The Dera Sach Khand Ballan religious community had announced the formation of the new Ravidassia religion and separation from Sikhism at Varanasi. The split from Sikhism was triggered after the killing of its deputy head Ramanand Dass in May 2009 at a temple in Vienna by some Sikh radicals.\n\nPresident of newly formed Begumpura Lok Party and a supporter of the new religion, Satish Bharti, said that the copies of the new Bani were put on display during the religious processions in order to assert that the community members are firm believers of the new religion.\n\nRavidassias are aligned with a \"sant\" who mentors them on their spiritual path, providing personalised \"mantras\" and advice. The head of the Ravidassia Dharam, known as the \"sadhus\" are present mainly in Punjab and the Dera Sach Khand Ballan consists of \"sadhus\", also known as Sant Samaj who in turn lead and are heads of all Ravidassias \"deras\" around the world. The leader of the Ravidassia religion, known as the Gaddi Nashin is Sant Niranjan Dass alongside Sant Surinder Dass Bawa. Former leaders include Sant Hari Dass, Sant Sarwan Dass, Sant Garib Dass and Sant Baba Pippal Dass.\n\nThe Ravidassia employ the greeting \"ਜੈ ਗੁਰੂਦੇਵ\" (\"Jai Gurdev\") \"जय गुरुदेव \" the motto of the religion.\n\nThe Ravidassia religious symbol is known as the Harr Nishaan (\"sign of God\"). The Gurmukhi transliteration of the name Harr is the main symbol of the Ravidassia religion. It is also called as \"Koumi Nishan\".\n\nThe religion is also represented by a flag, with the insignia \"Har\" which, states Ronki Ram, includes:\n\nThe insignia Har, states Ram, represents the \"very being of Ravidass and his teachings\". It is chosen after the name of their Guru, as \"ravi\" means \"illumination\" and \"dass\" \"servant of god\".\n\nDera Bhallan Ravidasis claim that their religion was created after they were excluded from Sikh gurdwaras in Punjab. There are many similarities with mainstream Sikhism and indeed temple worship is almost identical. The primary difference is the reverence of Ravidas as their main prophet or teacher.\n\nThe Dera Bhallan community insists they are separate from Sikhism as Guru Ravidas and not the Guru Granth Sahib is their spiritual Satguru.\n\nThe birthday of Ravidas is celebrated every year at the Seer Gowardhapur village temple in the state of Uttar Pradesh in January or February and the government of India has declared it a gazetted holiday.\n\nEvery year more than 1 million devotees from India and abroad visit the Seer Goverdhanpur temple. In India, devotees pour in from Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat, MP, Bihar, UP and Uttarakhand while foreign devotees from the US, Canada and UK throng the village.\n\nOn the day there is a Path of Amritbani Guru Ravidas read, the Harr(i) nishaan sahib is changed ceremonially, and there is a special \"Ravidassia Arti\" and a \"Nagar Kirtan\" procession bearing Shri Guru Ravidas' portrait are taken out to the accompaniment of music through the streets of the temple locality.\n\nSpecial pilgrim trains have been run to and from Varanasi for the last 12 years on the occasion of Parkash Ustav of Guru Ravi Dass. A special train is run from Jalandhar to Varanasi and back every year on Guru Ravidass Jyanti Purb for the convenience of the pilgrims since 2000.\n\n\n"}

After a period, the relics were lost to civilisation.\n\nIn 1851, the British archaeologist Sir Alexander Cunningham was excavating at the Asokan Buddhist complex in Sanchi, near Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh in India, which dated to the 3rd century BCE. In the famous Third Stupa, he uncovered the bodily relics of Sariputra and Mahammoggallana. At approximately the same time, more relics of the two arahants were found in a stupa at Satadhara, about ten kilometres from Sanchi.\n\nAfter sinking a shaft in the centre of the stupa on Sanchi Hill, Cunningham unearthed a large stone slab, more than five feet in length, lying in a north-south axis. Beneath the slab were two boxes of gray sandstone, each with a brief inscription in Brāhmī characters on the lid. The box at the southern end was inscribed \"Sariputtasa\" meaning \"(Relics) of Sariputra,\" while that to the north bore the inscription \"Maha-Mogalanasa.\" \"(Relics) of Maha Moggallana\".\n\nSariputra's box contained a large flat casket of white steatite, more than six inches wide and three inches in height. The surface was polished and hard, and the box, which is believed to have been turned on a lathe, was an elaborate piece of workmanship. Surrounding the casket were some fragments of sandalwood believed to have been from the funeral pyre, while inside it, in addition to the relics, were various precious stones. The casket also contained a single bone relic of Sariputra, shorter than one inch in length.\n\nMahamoggallana's stone box enclosed another steatite casket, similar to that of Sariputra but slightly smaller and with a softer surface. Inside it were two bone relics of Mahamoggallana, smaller than those of Sariputra, the larger of them being less than half an inch long.\n\nEach of the caskets had a single ink letter inscribed on the inner surface of the lid: \"Sa\" for Sariputra on the southern and \"Ma\" for Mahamoggallana on that to the north. Cunningham analysed the situation thus: \"Sariputra and Mahamoggallana were the principal followers of the Buddha, and were usually styled his right and left hand disciples. Their ashes thus preserved after death the same positions to the right and left of Buddha which they had themselves occupied in life.\" This is explained by the fact that Gautama Buddha customarily sat facing east, and thus Sariputta and Mahamoggallana were aligned south and north respectively.\n\nIn the Satadhara stupa, one of a group which Cunningham noted was locally referred to as \"Buddha Bhita\" or \"Buddha Monuments,\" he discovered two caskets of pale mottled steatite. These were inscribed, like those at Sanchi, \"Sariputtasa\" and \"Maha Mogallanasa\". This stupa showed signs of tampering by burglars, but the bone relics appeared to have been undisturbed. Cunningham, left a detailed account of everything his excavations brought to light in these and other stupas, and the authenticity of the relics was established among scholarly ranks.\n\nThe relics from both locations were taken to England and placed in the Victoria and Albert Museum, but some discrepancies between Cunningham's description of the caskets and the actual boxes in which the relics were deposited led to speculation that someone transferred the relics from Sanchi to the caskets discovered at Satadhara, and thus what became of the Sanchi steatite caskets is not concretely known.\n\nThe Sacred Relics were preserved there until 1939, when the Maha Bodhi Society approached the British government to request their return to India. The request was granted, but the implementation was delayed due to the Second World War. As a result, the actual transfer did not occur until 24 February 1947, to ensure safe passage.\n\nBefore returning to India, the relics were taken to Sri Lanka, where they were received with fanfare. For two and a half months in 1947, they were displayed for public viewing at the Colombo Museum, where it was estimated that more than two million people of all faiths paid homage to them. The relics were then taken to Calcutta, where they were displayed for public viewing at the [Dharmarajika Vihara],headquarters of the Maha Bodhi Society of India. Long queues existed for the two weeks of display, and although most of the pilgrims were Hindus, but there was also a large number of Muslims among them.\n\nThis was followed by a tour of Burma. In order that a wide cross section of Burmese society had an opportunity to view the relics, a marine tour along the Irrawaddy from Mandalay to Rangoon was commissioned, drawing vast crowds of people from the adjacent villages to hear sermons and the recitation of sutras which accompanied the tour. This was followed be tours of Nepal and Ladakh.\n\nAfter the end of the international tour, the relics were returned to India. However the Burmese government requested a portion of the relics should be given to Burma. The Maha Bodhi Society of India agreed to this, and the then Prime Minister of Burma went in person to Calcutta to receive them. The Burmese portion was ceremonially transferred to him in October 1950, and was later enshrined in the Kaba Aye Pagoda (World Peace Pagoda), built on the site of the Sixth Buddhist Council, close to Rangoon. Extensive ceremonies connected with the crowning of the pagoda and the installation of the relics lasted from the 5th to 11 March 1952.\n\nAnother portion was given to Sri Lanka to be enshrined in a new stupa built by the Maha Bodhi Society of Sri Lanka to receive them. They are currently housed in the temple of the Maha Bodhi Society, Colombo, awaiting the completion of the building.\n\nOn 30 November 1952, the remaining relics were enshrined at Sanchi on completion of the new Chetiyagiri Vihara built to store them.\n\n\n"}

Jesus' teachings and the retelling of his life story have significantly influenced the course of human history, and have directly or indirectly affected the lives of billions of people, even non-Christians. He is considered to be the most influential person to have ever lived by many, finding a significant place in numerous cultural contexts.\nChristianity teaches that Jesus is the Messiah (Christ) foretold in the Old Testament and the Son of God Incarnate. Christians believe that through his death and resurrection, humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of eternal life. These teachings emphasize that as the willing Lamb of God, Jesus \"chose to\" suffer in Calvary as a sign of his full obedience to the will of his Father, as an \"agent and servant of God\". Christians view Jesus as a role model, whose God-focused life believers are encouraged to imitate.\n\nIn Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as \"Isa\") is one of God's highest-ranked and most-beloved prophets. Islam considers Jesus to be neither the incarnation nor the Son of God. Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism (\"tawhid\") and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry (\"shirk\").\n\nThe Bahá'í Faith considers Jesus to be a manifestation of God, who are a series of personages who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world. Bahá'ís reject the idea that divinity was contained with a single human body.\n\nApart from his own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus' day generally rejected him as the Messiah, as do the great majority of Jews today. Mainstream Jewish scholars argue that Jesus neither fulfilled the Messianic prophecies in the Tanakh nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah.\nSikhism views Jesus as a high-ranked Holy man or saint. \n\nOther world religions such as Buddhism have no particular view on Jesus, and have but a minor intersection with Christianity. For non-religious perspectives on Jesus, see historical Jesus.\nChristian views of Jesus are based on the teachings and beliefs as outlined in the Canonical gospels, New Testament letters, the Christian creeds, as well as specific denominational teachings. These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life, and that he is the Christ and the Son of God.\n\nAlthough Christian views of Jesus vary, it is possible to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their catechetical or confessional texts. Generally speaking, adhering to the Christian faith requires a belief that Jesus is the Son of God and the \"Messiah\" or \"Christ\". Jesus refers to himself as the Son of God in the New Testament.\n\nChristians consider Jesus to be the Messiah (Christ) and believe that through his death and resurrection, humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of eternal life. These teachings emphasize that as the willing Lamb of God, Jesus \"chose to\" suffer in Calvary as a sign of his full obedience to the will of his Father, as an \"agent and servant of God\". The choice Jesus made thus counter-positions him as a new man of morality and obedience, in contrast to Adam's disobedience.\n\nThe five major milestones in the gospel narrative of the life of Jesus are his Baptism, Transfiguration, Crucifixion, Resurrection and Ascension. These are usually bracketed by two other episodes: his Nativity at the beginning and the sending of the Paraclete at the end. The gospel accounts of the teachings of Jesus are often presented in terms of specific categories involving his \"works and words\", e.g. his ministry, parables and miracles. The words of Jesus include several sermons, in addition to parables that appear throughout the narrative of the Synoptic Gospels (the gospel of John includes no parables).\n\nChristians not only attach theological significance to the works of Jesus, but also to his name. Devotions to the Holy Name of Jesus go back to the earliest days of Christianity. These devotions and feasts exist both in Eastern and Western Christianity.\n\nMost Christians believe that Jesus was both human and the Son of God. While there have been theological debate over the nature of Jesus, Trinitarian Christians generally believe that Jesus is God incarnate, God the Son, and \"true God and true man\" (or both fully divine and fully human). Jesus, having become fully human in all respects, suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, yet he did not sin. As fully God, he defeated death and rose to life again. According to the Bible, God raised him from the dead. He ascended to heaven, to the \"right hand of God,\" and he will return again for the Last Judgment and the establishment of the Kingdom of God.\n\nIn Islam, Jesus (\"Isa\") is considered to be a messenger of God (\"Allah\") and the Messiah (\"al-Masih\") who was sent to guide the Children of Israel (\"Bani Isra'il\") with a new scripture, the Gospel.\n\nThe Quran mentions Jesus by name 25 times—more often than Muhammad—and emphasises that Jesus was a mortal human who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. Unlike Christian writings, the Quran does not describe Jesus as the son of God, but as one of four major human messengers (out of many prophets) sent by God throughout history to guide mankind. Jesus is said to have lived a life of piety and generosity, and abstained from eating flesh of swine (or of any animals, according to some Muslim authors, even some who were not vegetarians themselves).\n\nMuslims also believe that Jesus received a Gospel from God, called the \"Injil\". However, Muslims hold that Jesus' original message was lost or altered and that the Christian New Testament does not accurately represent God's original message to mankind.\n\nDespite some major differences, the Quran and New Testament overlap in other aspects of Jesus' life; both Muslims and orthodox Christians believe that Jesus was miraculously born without a human biological father by the will of God, and that his mother, Mary (\"Maryam\" in Arabic), is among the most saintly, pious, chaste and virtuous women ever. The Quran also specifies that Jesus was able to perform miracles—though only by the will of God—including being able to raise the dead, restore sight to the blind and cure lepers. One miracle attributed to Jesus in the Quran, but not in the New Testament, is his being able to speak at only a few days old, to defend his mother from accusations of adultery. It also says that Jesus was a 'word' from God, since he was predicted to come in the Old Testament.\n\nMost Muslims believe that he was neither killed nor crucified, but that God made it appear so to his enemies. With the noteworthy exception of Ahmadi Muslims who believe that Jesus was indeed put on the cross, survived the crucifixion and was not lifted bodily to the heaven, majority of Muslims believe that Jesus ascended bodily to heaven and is alive. Majority of the Muslim population does not consider Ahmadi Muslims to be Muslims and consider them as Infidels due to their unorthodox perspectives. Some Muslim scholars maintain that Jesus was indeed put up on the cross, but did not die on it; rather, he revived and then ascended bodily to heaven. Others say that it was actually Judas Iscariot who was mistakenly crucified by the Romans. Regardless, Muslims believe that Jesus is alive in heaven and will return to the world in the flesh to defeat the Antichrist, once the world has become filled with sin, deception and injustice, and then live out the rest of his natural life.\n\nIslam rejects the Trinitarian Christian view that Jesus was God incarnate or the son of God, that he was ever crucified or resurrected or that he ever atoned for the sins of mankind. The Quran says that Jesus himself never claimed any of these things, and it furthermore indicates that Jesus will deny having ever claimed divinity at the Last Judgment, and God will vindicate him.\n\nJudaism rejects the idea of Jesus being God, or a person of a Trinity, or a mediator to God. Judaism also holds that Jesus is not the Messiah, arguing that he had not fulfilled the Messianic prophecies in the Tanakh nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah. According to Jewish tradition, there were no more prophets after Malachi, who lived centuries before Jesus and delivered his prophesies about 420 BC/BCE.\n\nAccording to Conservative Judaism, Jews who believe Jesus is the Messiah have \"crossed the line out of the Jewish community\". Reform Judaism, the modern progressive movement, states \"For us in the Jewish community anyone who claims that Jesus is their savior is no longer a Jew and is an apostate\".\n\nThe Babylonian Talmud include stories of \"Yeshu\" ; the vast majority of contemporary historians disregard these as sources on the historical Jesus. Contemporary Talmud scholars view these as comments on the relationship between Judaism and Christians or other sectarians, rather than comments on the historical Jesus.\n\nThe \"Mishneh Torah\", an authoritative work of Jewish law, states in \"Hilkhot Melakhim\" 11:10–12 that Jesus is a \"stumbling block\" who makes \"the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God\".\nThe Bahá'í Faith consider Jesus to be a manifestation of God, who are a series of personages who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization. In Bahá'í belief, the Manifestations have always been sent by God, and always will, as part of the single progressive religion from God bringing more teachings through time to help humanity progress. The Manifestations of God are taught to be \"one and the same\", and in their relationship to one another have both the station of unity and the station of distinction. In this way each Manifestation of God manifested the Word of God and taught the same religion, with modifications for the particular audience's needs and culture. Bahá'u'lláh wrote that since each Manifestation of God has the same divine attributes, they can be seen as the spiritual \"return\" of all the previous Manifestations of God. In this way, Bahá'ís believe that Bahá'u'lláh is, in both respects, the return of Jesus.\n\nTraditionally, Buddhists as a group take no particular view on Jesus, and Buddhism and Christianity have but a minor intersection. However, some scholars have noted similarities between the life and teachings of Gautama Buddha and Jesus. These similarities might be attributed to Buddhist missionaries sent as early as Emperor Ashoka around 250 BCE in many of the Greek Seleucid kingdoms that existed then and then later became the same regions that Christianity began. Jesus was seen as the savior and bringer of gnosis by various Gnostic sects, such as the extinct Manichaeism. In the Ahmadiyya Islamic view, Jesus survived the crucifixion and later travelled to India, where he lived as a prophet (and died) under the name of Yuz Asaf.\n\nIn Scientology, the teachings of Jesus are included among belief systems comprising those \"earlier forms\". Jesus is classified as below the level of Operating Thetan, but as a \"shade above\" the Scientology state of \"Clear\".\n\nIn Raëlism, Jesus and several other religious figures are considered prophets sent by an extraterrestrial race called the Elohim. Followers of Religious Science consider Jesus to be a teacher of Science of Mind principles, but reject his unique divinity, arguing that every person is equally divine.\n\nIn Hinduism Jesus is an avatar of the God Vishnu.\n\n"}

This is a Hindu ritual performed by the sects like the Bunts and Nairs, and all castes hold the Sarpa Kavu in reverence, with access forbidden to the area unless for due ceremonies.\n\nMythology says that Kerala was created from the Arabian Sea and given to the Brahmins (Namboothiris) as a \"donation\" by Parasurama to save himself from the sins of killing numerous kshathriya kings. The land was full of forests and poisonous snakes were found in plenty. So the Brahmins refused to stay there. Parasurama requested Lord Shiva to provide a solution. Shiva told Parasurama to start worshipping Anantha and vasuki the kings of snakes. Parasurama did so and Anantha advised him to start snake worship in Kerala and provide some forest especially for snakes in the form of Sarppakkavu (Snake forests). Parasurama later installed the idols of Anantha and Vasuki at Vettikkottu (near Kayamkulam in Alappuzha district) and Mannarassala(near Harippadu in Alappuzha district) and started worshipping them.

She was from the village Raipur Rani which is 2 km from the famous town of Chamkaur.\n\nGuru Gobind Singh escaped the fort of Chamkaur on the night of December 22, 1705. He briefly stopped at Raipur on his way to Machhiwara. Here he asked a lady by the name of Bibi Sharan Kaur Pabla to perform the last rites of the martyred Sikhs, which included two of Guru Gobind Singh's own sons, Sahibzada Ajit Singh and Sahibzada Jujhar Singh . Bibi Sharan Kaur Pabla performed the last rites of the two elder Sahibzadas and other Sikh warriors who had laid down their lives in the battle. According to one account, Bibi Sharan Kaur Pabla was so grief-stricken that she herself jumped in the funeral pyre and ended her life. According to another view she did not self-immolate but was slain by Moghul soldiers and thrown in the funeral pyre of Sahibzadas, when she and her other accomplices from Raipur, were caught cremating the bodies of Sahibzadas.\n\nA third account says that she indeed jump into funeral pyre in a Jauhar style self-immolation. Her own husband Bhai Pritam Singh, who was one of Guru Gobind Singh's warriors, was with the 10th Guru inside the Chamkaur fort resisting the Moghul attack. She discovered her husband among the dead. In total she is said to have collected bodies of thirty two stormtroopers of the Guru, including two Sahibzadas. She tried to cremate them in a single funeral pyre. As soon as the funeral pyre was lit she was discovered by Moghul and Ranghar soldiers who wanted the bodies of the soldiers - martyrs according to Sikh tradition- to rot in open air in order to terrorise non-Muslim population who refused to apostasize or give out the whereabouts of Guru Gobind Singh. It is said that understanding the intentions of the Moghul soldiers to outrage her modesty, she jumped into the funeral pyre of Sikh warriors, which included her own husband, to save her honour.\n\nSharan Kaur was a Saini and Raipur has considerable Saini population. She is also sometimes linked as a possible ancestor with Sikh nobleman of Phulkiyan, Sardar Nanu Singh Saini, whose family later owned sizeable land in the village Raipur. This village also has the funerary shrines or 'smadhs' of the following Sikh martyrs: Jathedar Naunihal Singh, Mastan Singh, Santokh Singh and Malkiat Singh. In 1945 a Gurudwara was built in village Raipur to commemorate Bibi Sharan Kaur Pabla.\n\nOnce she was sent to find out the strength of the Pathan forces that were conspiring to ambush Jamrud. She kept a concealed identity. She had some very secret information regarding the attack for the Pathan chief and was arranging a meeting in which she explained him the conspiracy and her brother brutal killing. The chief thanked her and assured her against the Sikhs. She managed to use her handkerchief to press it to his nose. She killed him with dagger very silently and managed to escape from the sword of soldiers.\n\nHari Singh Nalwa, the Sikh ruler, became serious due to ailment at Jamrud. Pathans took advantage of the situation and revolted and surrounded the fort to attack. It was pretended that he was healing and taken to fort top where he was shown walking to demoralise the rebels. But on 30 April 1837, he died. His demise was still a secret. Sharan Kaur showed her bravery by disguising herself as a Pathan woman and got to Pashawar to inform Maharaja Ranjit Singh about this incident.\n\nBy her such information Maharaja Ranjit Singh took hold of the situation and squelched the rebel with his large force. She saved the fort.\nSharan Kaur was later awarded and thanked for her bravery. She will always be remembered for her selfless service and excellent espionage in the pages of history. \n\n"}
{"id": "1870665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870665", "title": "Shinbutsu-shūgō", "text": "Shinbutsu-shūgō\n\nShinbutsu-shūgō (, \"syncretism of kami and buddhas\"), also called Shinbutsu-konkō (, \"jumbling up\" or \"contamination of kami and buddhas\"), is the syncretism of Buddhism and kami worship that was Japan's only organized religion up until the Meiji period. Beginning in 1868, the new Meiji government approved a series of laws that separated Japanese native kami worship, on one side, from Buddhism which had assimilated it, on the other.\n\nWhen Buddhism was introduced from China in the Asuka period (6th century), rather than discarding the old belief system, the Japanese tried to reconcile the two, assuming both were true. As a consequence, Buddhist temples (, \"tera\") were attached to local Shinto shrines (, \"jinja\") and vice versa and devoted to both kami and buddhas. The local religion and foreign Buddhism never quite fused, but remained however inextricably linked all the way to the present day, always interacting. The depth of the resulting influence of Buddhism on local religious beliefs can be seen for example in the fact that much of Shinto's conceptual vocabulary and even the types of Shinto shrines we see today, with a large worship hall and religious images, are themselves of Buddhist origin. The formal separation of Buddhism from Shinto took place only as recently as the end of the 19th century; however, in many ways, the blending of the two still continues.\n\nThe term \"shinbutsu shūgō\" itself was coined during the early modern era (17th century) to refer to the amalgamation of kami and \"buddhas\" in general, as opposed to specific currents within Buddhism which did the same, e.g. Ryōbu Shintō and Sannō Shintō. The term may have a negative connotation of bastardization and randomness.\n\nThere is no agreement among specialists as to the exact extent of fusion between the two religions.\n\nAccording to some scholars, for example Hirai Naofusa, in Japan, and Joseph Kitagawa, in the US, Shinto is the indigenous religion of Japan, has existed as such continuously since pre-history, and consists of all the peculiarly Japanese rituals and beliefs shaped by Japanese history from prehistory to the present. The term \"Shinto\" itself was coined in the 6th century to differentiate the loosely organized local religion from imported Buddhism.\n\nThe opposing view belongs to Japanese historian Toshio Kuroda (and his supporters) who, in a famous article (\"Shinto in the History of Japanese Religion,\" published in English in 1981), has argued that Shinto as an independent religion was born only in the modern period after emerging in the Middle Ages as an offshoot of Buddhism. Kuroda's main argument is that Shinto as a distinct religion is a Meiji era invention of Japanese nationalist ideologues (see the section The two religions after the Separation Order below). He points out how the state formalization of \"kami\" rituals and the state ranking of shrines during the Heian period were not the emergence of Shinto as an independent religion, but an effort to explain local beliefs in Buddhist terms. He also says that, while it is true that the two characters for \"Shinto\" appear very early in the historical record, for example in the Nihon Shoki, this does not mean today's Shinto already existed as a religion because they were originally used as a name for Taoism or even for religion in general. Indeed, according to Kuroda, many features of Shinto, for example the worshiping of mirrors and swords or the very structure of the Ise Shrine (Shinto's holiest and most important site) are typical of Taoism. The term Shinto in old texts therefore does not necessarily indicate something uniquely Japanese.\n\nStill according to this view, Shinto's rise as an autonomous religion was gradual and started to become evident with the emergence of Yoshida Kanetomo's Yoshida Shintō. The term Shinto started to be used with today's meaning of \"kami\" worship only later during the Edo period. During the same era, Kokugaku theorists like Motoori Norinaga tried to separate it intellectually from Buddhism, preparing the ground for the final schism of the Meiji Restoration.\n\nAccording to the first view, then, the two religions were at the time of their first meeting already formed and independent and thereafter just coexisted with non-essential exchanges. According to the second, Buddhism, meeting local kami beliefs in Japan, actually produced today's Shinto.\n\nThe fusion of Buddhism with the local kami worship started as soon as the first arrived in Japan. Mononobe no Okoshi wrote, \"The kami of our land will be offended if we worship a foreign kami.\" Mononobe saw Gautama Buddha as just another kami. Foreign kami were called or , and understood to be more or less like local ones. Initially, therefore, the conflict between the two religions was political, and not religious, in nature, a struggle between the progressive Soga clan, that wanted a more international outlook for the country, and the conservative Mononobe clan, that wanted the contrary.\n\nBuddhism was not passive in the assimilation process, but was itself ready to assimilate and be assimilated. By the time it entered Japan it was already syncretic, having adapted to and amalgamated with other religions and cultures in India, China, and the Korean Peninsula. For example, already while in India, it had absorbed Hindu divinities like Brahma (\"Bonten\" in Japanese) and Indra (\"Taishakuten\"). When it arrived in Japan, it already had a disposition towards producing the combinatory gods that the Japanese would call . Searching for the origins of a kami in Buddhist scriptures was felt to be nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nHowever, if monks didn't doubt the existence of kami, they certainly saw them as inferior to their buddhas. Hindu gods had already been treated analogously: they had been thought of as un-illuminated and prisoners of \"saṃsāra\". Buddhist claims of superiority encountered resistance, and monks tried to overcome them by deliberately integrating kami into their system. Several strategies to do this were developed and deployed.\n\nThe process of amalgamation is usually divided into three stages.\n\nThe first articulation of the difference between Japanese religious ideas and Buddhism, and the first effort to reconcile the two is attributed to Prince Shōtoku (574 - 622), and the first signs that the differences between the two world views were beginning to become manifest to the Japanese in general appear at the time of Emperor Tenmu (673 - 86). Accordingly, one of the first efforts to reconcile Shinto and Buddhism was made in the 8th century during the Nara period founding so-called , that is \"shrine-temples\", complexes comprising both a shrine and a temple.\n\nBehind the inclusion in a Shinto shrine of Buddhist religious objects was the idea that the kami were lost beings in need of liberation through Buddhism like any other sentient beings. Kami were thought to be subject to karma and reincarnation like human beings, and early Buddhist stories tell how the task of helping suffering kami was assumed by wandering monks. A local kami would appear in a dream to the monk, telling him about his suffering. To improve the kami's karma through rites and the reading of sutras, Buddhist monks would build temples next to kami shrines. Such groupings had been created by the 7th century, for example at Usa Jingū in Kyūshū, where Hachiman was worshiped together with Maitreya. The building of temples at shrines produced shrine-temple complexes, which in turn accelerated the amalgamation process. As a result of the creation of shrine-temple complexes, many shrines that had until then been just an open-air site became Buddhist style groupings of buildings.\n\nAt the end of the same century, in what is considered the second stage of the amalgamation, the kami Hachiman was declared a dharmapala and, later, a bodhisattva. Shrines for him started to be built at temples (the so-called \"temple-shrines\"), marking an important step ahead in the process of amalgamation of kami and Buddhism. When the great buddha at Tōdai-ji in Nara was built, there was also erected within the temple grounds a shrine for Hachiman – according to the legend because of a wish expressed by the kami himself. Hachiman considered this his reward for having helped the temple find the gold and copper mines from which the metal for the great statue had come. After this, temples in the entire country adopted tutelary kami (.\n\nThe third and final stage of the fusion took place in the 9th century with the development of the theory according to which Japanese kami are emanations of buddhas, \"bodhisattvas\" or devas who mingle with human beings to lead them to the Buddhist Way. This theory was the keystone of the whole \"shinbutsu shūgō\" edifice and therefore the foundation of Japanese religion for many centuries. Because of it, most kami changed from potentially dangerous spirits to be improved through contact with the Buddhist law to local emanations of buddhas and bodhisattvas which possess a wisdom of their own. Buddhas and kami were now indivisible twins.\n\nThe status of kami however changed dramatically according to the sect. At one extreme one was Shingon Buddhism's Ryōbu Shintō thinkers, who considered kami and buddhas equivalent in power and dignity. However, not all kami were emanations of some buddha. Some, often called , usually dangerous and angry, had no Buddhist counterpart. Among them were the \"tengu\", or animals possessing magic, as the fox (\"kitsune\") or . Even these unholy and inferior \"true kami\" however attracted the attention of Ryōbu Shinto thinkers, which resulted in theories which declared them to be manifestations of Vairocana and Amaterasu.\n\nOn the other hand, Pure Land Buddhism was somewhat different because it at first renounced kami-worship due to the notion that kami were inferior to the buddhas. However, the largest Pure Land branch, Jōdo Shinshū, still encouraged the worship of kami despite the fact that faith in Amida Buddha should be the primary practice. Furthermore, under the influence of Rennyo and other leaders, Jōdo Shinshū accepted the mainstream honji suijaku beliefs and the spiritual relationship between kami and the buddhas and bodhisattvas. \n\nThe two religions however never fused completely and, while overlapping here and there, kept their particular identity within a difficult, largely un-systematized and tense relationship. This relationship existed, rather than between two systems, between particular kami and particular buddhas. The two were always perceived as parallel but separate entities. Besides \"shinbutsu shūgō\" there was always the other side of the coin of continued separation.\n\nIn fact, the term in Japanese Buddhist terminogy refers to the tendency that existed in Japan to keep some kami separate from Buddhism. While some kami were integrated in Buddhism, others (or at times even the same kami in a different context) were kept systematically away from Buddhism. This phenomenon had significant consequences for Japanese culture as a whole. It must not be confused with \"shinbutsu bunri\" (\"separation of kami and buddhas\") or with \"haibutsu kishaku\" (\"abolish buddhas and destroy Shākyamuni\"), which are phenomena recurrent in Japanese history and usually due to political causes. While the first assumes the acceptance of Buddhism, the second and third actually oppose it.\n\nThe practice had in any case important consequences, among them the prevention of the complete assimilation of kami practices into Buddhism. Also, the prohibition of Buddhism at the Ise and Kamo Shrines allowed them to freely develop their theories about the nature of kami.\n\nDuring the \"Shinbutsu bunri\", the attempt to separate Shinto from Buddhism, temples and shrines were forcefully separated by law with the of 1868.\n\nHowever, in spite of more than a century of formal separation of the two religions, temples or shrines that do not separate them are still common, as proven for example by the existence of some important Buddhist Inari shrines. During the Meiji period, in order to help the spread of Shinto, shrine-temples (\"jingū-ji\") were destroyed while temple-shrines (\"chinjusha\") were tolerated. As a result, shrine-temples are now rare (an extant example is Seiganto-ji), but temple-shrines are common, and most temples still have at least a small one.\n\nProminent religious institutions in both camps still give evidence of integration of the two religions. The great Kenchō-ji temple, number one of the Kamakura's great Zen temples (the Five Mountain System) includes two shrines. One of the islands in the right-side pond of Tsurugaoka Hachimangū in Kamakura hosts a subshrine dedicated to goddess Benzaiten, a form of Saraswati. For this reason, the sub-shrine was removed in 1868 at the time of the \"Shinbutsu Bunri\", but rebuilt in 1956.\n\nShinto and Buddhism still have a symbiotic relationship of interdependence, particularly concerning funeral rites (entrusted to Buddhism) and weddings (usually left to Shinto or sometimes Christianity). The separation of the two religions is therefore considered only superficial, and \"shinbutsu shūgō\" is still an accepted practice.\n\nStill, the separation of the two religions is felt to be real by the public. Scholar Karen Smyers comments, \"The surprise of many of my informants regarding the existence of Buddhist Inari temples shows the success of the government's attempt to create separate conceptual categories regarding sites and certain identities, although practice remains multiple and nonexclusive\".\n\n\n"}

The temple is filled with the smoke of burning incense and a variety of pit vipers. The vipers are believed to be rendered harmless by the sacred smoke, but as a safety precaution, the snakes have also been de-venomed but still have their fangs intact. Visitors are warned against picking up the reptiles and placing them on their bodies to take pictures. Local devotees believe the temple's snake population comes there of its own accord.\n\nThe temple was built about 1850 in memory of Chor Soo Kong (祖師公), by a Buddhist monk. Chor Soo Kong (also known as Qingshui) was born in China with the surname Tan (陳昭應 or Tan Chhiau-eng) in China during the Song Dynasty (960-1279). He was serious about seeking spiritual attainment and was ordained at an early age. According to legend, Chor Soo Kong was also a healer and sometimes gave shelter to the snakes of jungle. When he died at age 65 after a lifetime of good deeds, he was awarded the honorific title Chor Soo, that of an eminent figure revered generation after generation. After the construction of the temple, snakes reportedly appeared by themselves. The temple was originally called the \"Temple of the Azure Cloud\" in honor of the beauty of Penang's sky.\n\nBelievers from as far away as Singapore and Taiwan come to pray in the temple on Chor Soo Kong's birthday (the sixth day of the first lunar month).\n\nThe temple was featured during the 8th leg of The Amazing Race 16.\n\nThe temple is a location in Tan Twan Eng's novel \"The Gift of Rain\" (book 1, chapter 4).\n\n"}

Stephane Mallarmé described him as \"the offspring of an old sea-dog and a Brittany cow\". He was educated at the \"Lycée Pierre Corneille\" in Rouen.\n\nDujardin became editor of the journal \"Revue Indépendente\" in 1886, and it was in this journal that his first works were published. His association with this journal resulted in it being termed an \"important voice for the symbolists\" (Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center 2004).\n\nWhen his parents died, Dujardin was the sole heir to their fortune, and he used some of this money to finance the plays \"Antonia\" in 1891 and \"Le Chevalier Du Passé\" in 1882.\n\nHis literary works are extensive and include numerous plays, poems and novels. Dujardin also produced works of literary and social criticism and reminiscence. James Joyce claimed his style of interior monologue owed its influence to works by Dujardin. He continued his involvement with journalism throughout his life and this resulted in numerous disputes with authorities, including charges of treason, though he was never convicted.\n\nDujardin had expensive and lavish tastes for clothing which was deemed \"dandyish\" for his time, and was known to frequent Parisian night life. His many dalliances with women were noted and he had had numerous relationships with actresses, models and other glamorous women. Dujardin was also known to have many female friends involved in the arts and he supported some of them financially.\n\nHis frivolous lifestyle eventually reduced his finances so he began numerous financial ventures, including gambling and real estate. He also offered his services to periodicals for marketing and advertising campaigns. It was here that the police noticed an article compiled by Dujardin which resulted in a jail sentence, though it was later remitted.\n\nIn 1885 Dujardin and Téodor de Wyzewa initiated the \"Revue Wagnérienne\", imitating Félix Fénéon and his \"Revue Indépendante\" which had first been published the year before. This annual journal, dedicated to the work of the German composer Richard Wagner, ran for three issues, from 1885 to 1887. In 1886 Dujardin and Fénéon joined forces under the banner of a new improved \"Revue Indépendante\". One of the innovations at this time was that the \"Revue\" started having small exhibitions in its rooms.\n\nDujardin married a woman named Germaine in 1893 and they later separated in 1901. They did not divorce until 1924 when he married Marie Chenou, a woman thirty years his junior. \n\nIn May 1922 he attended the International Congress of Progressive Artists and signed the \"Founding Proclamation of the Union of Progressive International Artists\".\n\nDujardin was an advocate of the Christ myth theory. He wrote the book \"Ancient History of the God Jesus\" (1938). He fathered two children, lived a peaceful life during his old age and died aged 88 years old on 31 October 1949.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
